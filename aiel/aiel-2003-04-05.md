When last we left our intrepid heros, they had found a group of goblins. The goblinoids' voices echo through the cave, and the sounds of screams-human screams-are heard in the distance.

Gabriel regards the Elf and his remaining companions with wary eyes, turning toward the sound. "We must go," he says quietly but decisively, and action follows words.

Ghost smoothly wipes his axes on the back of the last fallen goblin, cleaning the dark blood from the edge. He follows close, eager to rid these woods of the strangely aggressive goblin horde.

Proceeding down the cavern is easy enough. The goblin horde seems to be busy elsewhere in the caverns. Or so the sounds of picks hitting rocks and goblin grunts might lead you to believe. Although as you draw closer to the source of the screams... two goblins are seen. One stands with his back to you, whip in hand as he snaps it at a group of three humans. The other is similarly facing away, though what precisely he is doing, is difficult to say.

Gabriel directs commands to Matthew in whispered tones, then begins to creep forward..

Ghost pauses for a moment, watching the second goblin curiously...

Ghost waits in the shadows, letting Gabriel sneak forward. He waits, ready to charge, his axes at the ready.

Gabriel rushes forward, already chanting the mystic words, and runes flow like flame from his outstretched hands, forming a burst of red at both Goblins. Unfortunately the wizard is less than stealthy, and in telegraphing his approach warned the foul beasts.

Ghost charges forward, screaming piercingly as he charges towards the goblin with the whip in his hand. He swings his battle axe too early, missing, but the hand axe follows burying itself in the goblin's forehead as he turns around to meet the assault.

The Goblins, yes, goblins, turn then. The one with the axe in his head slumps to the ground, but there are three remaining. The one with the key, and two others. The one with the key steps back, while his comrades rush up to try and hit Ghost.

The two goblin's rusty maces take a good chunk out of Ghost's hide. Thud. Thud. The goblins snarl and spit shouting out curses in their own language. "Stupid hyoooomon!"

Matthew swoops past, but the flurry of axes and other weapons makes the poor bird reluctant to carry out his master's instructions just yet, and he flurries away in a shower of feathers, to try again soon.

Again the wizard invokes his mystic attack, the strain showing on his face as power courses through him unchecked by his day's preparations. He almost stumbles as another brilliant explosion of flame leaps from his fingers.

Ghost swings mightily, his axe flashing in the torchlight, forcing his opponent to skip back out of the way. Holding them at arm's length, he misses his strokes, but so do they, their smaller arms unable to penetrate the defense.

The goblins swing their mighty maces at Ghost, knowing full well that as they're smaller than the broadside of a barn, the odds of them getting hit are infinitessimal. Or at least that's what they think. They swing... and one of them goes wide, while the other brought his mace around so hard he spins about in circles! The Raven goes after the Goblin, trying to snatch the key once more, "Get back! Pesky bird!"

Gabriel pursues the fleeing keymaster, swinging his quarterstaff wildly - but the distraction is enough to allow his ebony companion to swoop down and at last rescue the all-important key from the creature's grasp.

And the goblins try once more to swing at Ghost. The barely notice the way Ghost's swings go over their heads. Must've forgotten that they're smaller than him. Try swinging downwards next time! This is advice they should've taken, as one of them swings his mace up and goes flying back about a foot, while the other brings his mace down **hard** on Ghost's toe. Well... hard for a goblin.

The wizard swings his staff around again, taking advantage of the goblin's surprise at the theft, and connects solidly against the side of his head. The wood reverberates in his hand as he connects, and crisply he directs Matthew, "Key to the prisoners!"

The goblin Gaberiel swings at looks stunned one more moent, before he slumps to the ground, looking rather dead. The other two goblins don't notice yet, and while one recovers and tries to hit Ghost, the other takes the initiative, whirling his mace around and smacking into Ghost's kneecaps...

As Gabriel returns to assist his newfound ally, but not all that well, his avian familiar wings its way toward the gathered prisoners, letting drop the key into outstretched hands.

Ghost swings wildly with his axe, barely paying attention to the swing as he lines up the goblin now trapped between himself and Gabriel. With a grunt his axe comes down...and through. Split in half, the goblin falls to the ground, spraying gore.

Gabriel swings his staff again, and fortunately avoids being dodged or parried this time. The retreating goblin is struck soundly on the back as it tries to scurry away, and the beast ends up tumbling forward to strike its head on an outcropping of stone. "That's that," says the wizard, tiredly, then looks over at the prisoners.

Ghost sighs, sinking to his knees, bleeding slightly from where the goblins managed to connect solidly, breaking and brusing the skin. "Dammit..."

The prisoners seem relieved, though they don't seem all that comfortable. They've managed to free themselves, with Matthews help, and one says, "Who... who are you? What're you doing all the way out here..." Then, "You... you're from the order aren't you? Come to rescue us?"

Gabriel nods quickly, as Matthew resumes his customary perch on the man's shoulder. "That's right..." He gives an eye to Ghost for a moment, then talks quickly. "Are there any more? We're not in much shape to take on more guards.."

Ghost nods, rising, leaning heavily on his axe. "There certainly are a lot of the little vermin."

"There are a few more, but they've gone deeper. The sounds you're hearing now are from where they broke into an underground network of tunnels. They're trying to break through a solid stone door... they had us trying to break through this wall to go around and over it..."

Gabriel sighs and nods. "Let's get you out of here at least," he says after a moment. "We'll rest up as best we can, then try to do something for the others.."

"Aye. That one there... he built himself a little yurt just down this tunnel." One of the prisoners gestures back a bit, "They stole our healing potions and have them hidden there. Perhaps you could use them... your friend looks very injured..."

They'll make it out safely. In the yurt you'll find four potions labeled Heal on them. As well as one unlabeled vial of blue liquid. There's a small chest in here as well. It seems rather locked, at the moment.

Ghost joins Gabriel, and they quickly find the healing potions. A deep draught later, and Ghost is feeling much better. A nod, and they continue, taking the potions but leaving the chest behind.

The tunnel is easy enough to find. It's just back and to the left of where the prisoners were. It's perhaps 20 feet to the bottom, but there're stairs that've been built here recently. The sounds of picks striking stone can be heard from up ahead.

As Gabe begins hiding his footfalls, Ghost stomps forwards with all the grace of a barbarian who's had a few too many grogs. Clomp clomp clang clang... the sounds of the picks have stopped then...

Ghost turns to the sneaking Gabe. "Oh. Are we trying to be subtle? It's not like letting them prepare will matter."

Gabriel sighs, and freezes, hoping to avoid detection despite all sense and reason.

Ghost moves forward, knowing the futility of moving quietly unarmored, but is at least cautious enough to peek around the corner before charging in.

When Ghost goes up to peek around the corner, he finds three goblins waiting there with crossbows pointed at the corner. The three of them let bolts fly, though the bolts strike the stones and clatter to the ground, harmlessly.

Ghost charges in swinging as the bolts clatter harmlessly aside...but he's tired, his axes swinging wild, and wide, no where near the target.

The Goblins step back five feet a piece, dropping their crossbows and readying Maces. They snarl then, and one of them glances back towards the wall for a moment. "Yargh!"

Gabriel coughs weakly as the runes of fire again blaze from his outstretched hands, the power coursing painfully through his body. "Take that," he spits, and indeed one goblin is burned badly enough to perish.

Ghost's axes move a little more slowly, and become more accurate, less wild. One buries itself into the singed goblin, finishing him, while the other slides just over the head of the second, millimeters away.

The goblin falls dead, after having lost a disagreement with the edge of Ghost's axe. A bit of blood pools around his wounds, and Matthew squawks eagerly about something or another.

"Something fleeing, in there," Gabriel explains, pointing at the hole in the wall behind the three now-dead goblins. He deposits his quarterstaff against the wall, stooping to retrieve and examine the crossbows for usability.

Ghost hmms, and quickly sheathes his axe, and pulls out his longbow. "Shall I?"

Gabriel shakes his head. "Not unless we can identify it, I think.. Our priority is the remaining captives."
