# View layer

* Set the view layer dimensions to approximate the panel dimensions, e.g. 8.5" x 11" for a full page
* If the whole panel has a background, set the world background accordingly. If this panel will overlay others, set the background to transparent

# Camera

* Add an empty, parent it to the camera. You'll parent your word balloons to this empty
