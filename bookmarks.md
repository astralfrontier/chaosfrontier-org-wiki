## Fonts
1. http://www.typeconnection.com/index.php - the first crucial step, identifying a specific font based on the "feel" I want to achieve.2
2. http://joelcrawfordsmith.com/closest-font/  - avoiding paying $100 for a font is helpful on a small non-profit project like this, so if I can find a comparable font, great.
3. https://fonts.google.com/ - the site itself, where I can download web fonts.
