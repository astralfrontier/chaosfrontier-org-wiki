Game Log: Chapter 5 - A Lady in the Town


--------------------------------------------

When last we left the intrepid, chewed up, spit out band of roving private investigators, Andreth was sitting on Father Pesci's table, while Brother Starguard was abjured to stop moaning; no upsetting the patients, after all. Then in walked this blonde dame, swinging her hips ...

She smiled toothily at the group of blood spattered adventurers. "I must say, lads, you've seen better times, haven't you? But ... have you found the right stuff yet?"

Starguard stretched. "We found swords alright," he admitted. "The problem is we found them point first."

_Brother Starguard is a tall man, strangely dressed in the brown work clothes of the acolyte cleric. The strange part is because he seems too old to be an student in the church. His thick, bushy, mustache and beard, once black, is now salt and pepper, the darkness interspersed with star-like flecks of white. His face is light and lively, blue eyes sparkling, though with a few hard wrinkles, a few laugh lines. His nose is a bit hawkish, giving him a bit of an intense look. His body seems in decent shape, if not particularly strong, but most of his form is hidden beneath the cloth of his clothes. He wears a midnight blue robe, short, with easy release clips so that he doesn't get caught by it in a fight. Depending on the situation, he may also wear his studded leather armor, but always has his morning star at his hip, in case of trouble. He walks more like a soldier than a priest...but the wooden symbol of the two stars entwined hung on the leather strap states otherwise._

The dame chuckled at Brother Starguard. "Point first indeed; didn't your mother ever teach you always to offer a blade hilt first?

"It wasn't _our_ mothers who were at fault," Tilara replied.

_Tilara is a young woman both pretty and possessing that indefinable presence that transforms mere attractiveness into beauty. She has bright red-gold hair and laughing emerald eyes in a tanned face. Her graceful and athletic figure is partially hidden by the practical traveling clothes she wears, dark green tunic and brown leggings with black boots and a dark grey cloak. She carries a quarterstaff, and her tortoise-shell cat is usually either riding her shoulder or twining about her feet._

"Depends on who you're offering it to, anyway," Starguard gruffly agreed. But who might you be, milady?"

Father Pesci glared at the woman. "Come to find some new victims for your **charm** school?"

Yuri mumbled to Father Pesci, "Father, would you introduce us, please?"

_Yuri is a young man of average height and wiry build, with sandy blonde hair and an easy, fluid demeanor. He has a ready smile and a glimmer in his eye. He is dressed in a leather jerkin, light wool trousers, soft boots, and a fine wool cloak, all in subdued grey tones. The hilt of a rapier is visible at his belt; otherwise, he seems rather lightly equipped._

The dame chuckled. "Indeed. Well, Father Pesci, will you introduce me to these enterprising young men and woman? Or should I introduce myself? Yes, myself, I think." She smiled lazily, and seated herself on the table, legs crossed, one leg swinging. "It's like this, lads. I came in last night to see my brothers ... and they're all crankier than a three legged bull with a herd of cows in heat."

Starguard blinked, quickly searching the lady's face for Gerroldsdottir family resemblance.

Father Pesci looked sour, and gave in with poor grace. "Yuri, Tilara, Andreth, I would like you to meet Berina. Gerrold's oldest daughter. She left town about thirty five years ago, to seek her fortune in Citadel, which is where I met her." He gestured to Starguard. "And this is Brother Starguard. Remember I wrote to you about accepting him as student?"

"To the capital?" Starguard asked, curious. "What are you doing back in Woolwich after that?"

Berina smiled lazily at Starguard, one eye half winking closed. "Why, to visit old daddy dearest. It's time to collect on a few ... debts."

Tilara looked more interested. "And why would your brothers be in an uproar, then? Your sister is, of course..."

Berina chuckled. "With all their security, and all their apprentices, and all their piddly little wards, daddy dearest got robbed ..."

There was a collective blink. "You're kidding." "Gerrold... got robbed..."

Tilara sighed. "Oh, dear... Jane will be disappointed. She was hoping to prove they were behind the theft on her stock."

"Doesn't mean that they weren't," Yuri noted.

"Now..." Tilara cautioned. "Remember the first pair of highwaymen? Her weapons, his armor. Something interesting is going on."

Berina chuckled again, still swinging her leg. As she leaned back her breasts showed to perfect advantage, her eyelids sinking to half mast. "Jane did mention she hired a few bright lads and lasses. So ... " She slowly licked her lips. "How goes your progress?

"It ... progresses. Why?" Tilara asked, suspicious.

Starguard trod over Tilara's caution. "Poorly. We've been to where we thought the swords were, but were chased off with tail firmly between legs."

Berina nodded at that, but Yuri's curiousity had been raised. "So what is your interest in this... Lady? Misfortune befalls your kin, but I'm sure that Gerrold can afford much better help than us. Why, all he need do is plead his case to the mayor! The good folk of this town will not stand for such a slight on the cornerstone of their economy!" Yuri's sarcasm was easily heard in the comment.

Berina chuckled dryly, but her tone turned bitter. "I'm not helping daddy dearest. He has sons a plenty to do that. No; I'm here on my own business. A small matter of some mail. But as you say, pretty boy ... as you say. So tell me, will you accept a little freelance contract on the side?" The dame tilted her head, her lips forming a perfect rose colored little bow...

"What kind of mail, milady?" Starguard asked. "Chain or paper?" He pauses, and tried to grab his wits from where they had fled from the perfect pursing of lips. "And you're going about this all backwards. First you tell us what you want us to do, then we tell you if we'll do it or not."

Berina sighed, her chest expanding accordingly. "Such ... business men. So forthright, and specific. Very well; I had left a small knife with Jane to be repaired. I would like it back. Is that succinct enough?"

Starguard shrugged, sullen as being chastised. "I'm sorry milady. Too many years in the army has blunted what little sense of social play I had. Since we're already after the weapons stolen from Jane anyway, any particular reason you felt the need to approach us about this knife?"

Yuri watched the chest expand and contract, before his mind returned to the conversation. "Well, we do our best to be accommodating, Madame. This could be within the scope of our current contract."

Tilara nodded. "Seems to be. I don't think it requires a separate contract, though... we're already contracted to retrieve anything we can for your sister, and if we find it, you'll get it back from her, right?"

"That's the point," Yuri agreed with Tilara. "How is this different from asking us to do our present job?"

Berina shrugged delicately. "If it must go through Jane, I suppose it must. Although I think I would prefer it to stay officially ... shall we say .. 'lost'?" She looked over at Father Pesci. "Vouch for me, will you, darling? The lads should know I'll stand good for any payments due."

Father Pesci turned beet red and began to stammer something about her gold always being brighter than Brother Sun himself...

"Aaaah..." Yuri nodded with understanding. "So if the dagger stayed lost, that state of affairs would suit you better?"

Tilara blinks at Pesci's reaction, then narrowed her eyes. "Officially, with regards to whom? As long as Jane knows about it, I don't see a problem at all."

"Why darling child, with regards to **everybody**, of course. If it stays lost, no one will hunt it, now will they?" Berina smiled, one eyebrow raised.

Tilara locked her attention to Berina. "It seems somehow dishonest - had you already paid your sister for the work?"

Berina smiled, that eyebrow still raised. "Naturally; the work was not trivial and required a great deal of time. You can ask her yourselves, if you choose, she'll not tell you otherwise."

"In that case, _I_ don't see a problem with returning it directly to you, as long as we get our finder's fee - but I think we need to discuss this. Could you excuse us for a moment?" Tilara asked.

Starguard shrugged. "All of this is moot at the moment anyway. Once we have the dagger, then we can decide if it should stay lost or not."

Yuri covered a wince as Berina smiled gently at Brother Starguard. "I see," Berina murmured.

"One thing at a time," Starguard rolled on, missing Yuri's wince completely. "We need to talk about it anyway. Is there somewhere we can contact you?"

The dame's expression was ... blank. "I see. Certainly. I'll be at daddy dearest's house. Please do join me for ... tea, some afternoon."

"We'll contact you straight away, Madame." Yuri came in smoothly. "I'm sure you can understand that we require some time to relieve our ...tensions... before resuming our investigation."

Starguard nodded, his eyes steady. Well, they slipped a little around curves, but fairly steady, considering the distractions.

The dame chuckled earthily. "Tensions, eh. So I'll see you tonight at the Stuffed Codpiece?"

Starguard noted there were innocent ways to say the name of that inn. That wasn't one of them. Starguard managed to keep control.

Yuri frowned slightly. "My price is not paid in that coin, Madame. But it seems we understand each other."

The dame raised an eyebrow into her hairline. "I do not **sell** that coin, stripling. I merely ... entertain it."

Yuri hmmed. "Then it seems I have more to learn." Tilara grinned and nodded behind Yuri's back.

The dame slowly rose to her feet, stretching catlike. "Well, Brother Starguard, do drop by and let me know what you decide, hmmm? I do **so** look forward to serving you some ... tea."

Father Pesci was immediately at her side, looking strained. "Please, Berina, may I walk you to your Father's house?" Opening the door for her, he followed her out, and walked down the road with her.

---

"What a thoroughly fascinating woman," Yuri commented. "I think we'll make fantastic adversaries."

Tilara watched the retreating figures of Berina and Father Pesci. After they've turned the corner, she sighed. "I've _got_ to learn how she does that."

Starguard gazed wistfully after the retreating figure, "Now _there's_ a story there that the Father hasn't told me..."

"Starguard, he had all he could do to avoid passing out. Or possibly throwing up. Or both," Yuri said. "And by the way... you're not supposed to tell the client that you'll decide later if you're going to screw them during a deal or not. It takes all the fun out of the game. And I think it was rather a strained suggestion for a man of the cloth."

Starguard nodded and shrugged. "I noticed the Father's reaction. I'm old enough that my mind isn't completely locked on curves. Granted, I'll admit those were some \_nice\_ curves... But bah. If she's got a good reason, she'll come forth on it. I'm just hoping she doesn't hire another group to get in our way."

"That's a serious consideration, Starguard. If we don't agree to let her sneak that knife away, she probably will hire someone else. As long as Jane confirms that she's been paid for the work.... why not?" Tilara asked.

"Because I don't trust her farther than I could throw her." Starguard admitted. "Let's talk about this tonight. We should all rest for a while anyway."

Yuri sighed. "I just **know** we're getting in over our heads here. And guys... she doesn't like us. I think she's irritated that we didn't just fall over in a swoon at the sight of her and thereby make this easy for her."

Starguard chuckled. "If she expected Tilara to swoon..."

"Like Pesci did," answered Tilara to Yuri. "I think he knows what she can do - maybe she teaches it - but he fell for it anyway. I suspect that if she'd managed to snare the three of you, I would've had little choice."

"And what is this 'charm school', anyway?" Yuri wondered, then had a thought. "Hey, Tilara? Is she... uh... magic?"

"I'm not sure," Tilara admitted. "I didn't have a chance to check discreetly."

"Ooh. If that was magic..." Yuri trailed off. "Oh, dear. I don't know if I should be fascinated or offended! What power! What gall!"

"She's fat," Tilara delcared.

Starguard grinned at the memory, "Only in the right places..."

Yuri turned and looked at Tilara. "I do hope you're not jealous!"

Tilara sniffed. "Certainly not. I just want to know the spell she uses."

"I personally don't think that was magic as much as experience," Starguard said.

Yuri sighs. "Anyway, we better find out what the Father knows. In the meantime, I'm going to hit the streets and see what the rumor mill is brewing.

Yuri starts towards the door, then stops and turns back.

Yuri says, "And anybody who goes to tea with this woman... well, just take a cold bath before and after, please? And don't sign anything while you're there."

Tilara raises an eyebrow at Yuri. "Maybe you'd better let me go."

Yuri grins. "But my dear... I don't 'let' you do anything. I just stay out of the line of fire!"

Tilara giggles. "That line _did_ work very well, didn't it? We'll have to do it again sometime."

Tilara says, "I think I'll talk to Jane. Andreth, you want to carry that club and the arrows we found over there for me?"

Andreth nods absentmindedly.

Yuri says, "You want to stay here, Brother? You've been through a lot. Perhaps you should rest, and have a _good long chat_ with Father Pesci."

Starguard nods. "Mind if I dream about a nice long something else with sister Berina there?" He grins at the looks he gets. "What, I'm an old priest. I'm not dead."

Tilara just shakes her head as she heads out. The mutter might be something like "Not yet..."

Yuri raises his eyebrows. "You're not dead TODAY, brother. Honestly, we need to come out with a better way to do these things."

---

Half an hour later, Father Pesci returns. Sinking down on his chair, he pulls out the bottle of medicinal brandy and takes a long hard satisfying swallow. "You young swot, you really can be an idiot sometimes."

Starguard nods. "I know, Father. I should have let Yuri handle things a bit more. But...who the heck was she?"

"Berina?" Father Pesci groans, and takes another swig. "She runs a charm school in Citadel. Every one of the princes' children has attended that school ..."

Starguard says, "That explains about three things. One of the major ones remaining is how \_you\_ know her."

Father Pesci shudders. "They sent me to teach religious knowledge to the little ... ruffians."

Starguard says, "Oh dear. Nobles are much like officers, so I heard..."

Father Pesci nods once, eloquently. "Only worse. These children brought all the feuds with them ..."

Starguard says, "Anyway, I gathered she's someone to stay clear of...if possible. Do you have any ideas what she's going to do after my faux pas?"

Father Pesci shrugs. "No. If you're lucky, she'll remember you're my student."

Starguard says, "Why would that be lucky?"

Father Pesci takes one last pull from the bottle before looking long, hard, and thoughtfully at Brother Starguard. Sighing, he stands up and unlocks a small chest he pulls from underneath the pallet. "Here. Take these. If she serves Lap Sang tea, you'll be fine. Oo Chong, drink this vial before you take a single sip." With that, he hands three vials to Brother Starguard.

Starguard says, "Lap Sang? Oo Chong?"

Father Pesci holds up one finger. "Now drink it all the way down; it tastes vile. But don't let her know you drank it, and above all, **don't** complain about the tea."

Father Pesci sighs again, deeply. "Guard them well; they're my last three."

Starguard says, "What would Oo Chong tea do without these vials?"

Father Pesci looks very tired all of a sudden. And kind of sad. "Just ... don't ask?"

Starguard sighs. "Yes, Father. Sometimes I forget that in some things, you have more experience than I do."

Father Pesci stumbles into his bedroom. "I think I ... need ... a nap." Moments later he keels over into bed. "Brother Starguard ... we ... need ... more ... medishinal ... brandy ... Go ... get ... shome ..."

Starguard sighs, and pulls a sheet over the young Father. And makes no movement to head for brandy.

---

Tilara and Andreth wander out the door first, Andreth carrying a double handful of weapons. Andreth sneaks out shortly thereafter, heading for gin soaked inhabitants with loose lips and potential future sunken ships ...

Tilara heads over toward Jane's shop, keeping an eye open for any of the bandits they've already seen, but arrives without noticing anything untoward. Andreth brings the weapons that they've found so far - a pathetic collection, compared to what's missing, but at least it shows they're on the track.

Jane smiles, as Tilara enters the shop. "Ah, my hunters. How goes it?"

Tilara sighs. "Not a complete bust, but we haven't found much yet. A few bandits by the roadside were carrying a few things that had your maker's mark on them. Andreth's got them..."

Jane nods, accepting the club and arrows, and efficiently stowing them away in the shop. "Well, it's a decent start, at least. You look like you've had a tough time of it in recovering just these; care to tell me what's been happening?"

Tilara says, "I don't think it's your brothers behind this after all. Kiel seems to have stolen it as his entry to a bandit gang - we mixed it up with a couple of them on the road, and got the information we needed to find their lair. Unfortunately, we got chewed up there, and just barely got away. Starguard is with Father Pesci at the moment, on orders to rest."

Jane looks disappointed. "Damn. You're sure about those thieving bastards not being involved? Which reminds me; would you prefer to be paid now or when you've brought back all you can?"

Tilara shrugs. "I'm not sure, but that's the way things are leaning. How's Angiers?"

Jane smiles. "He'll be back at the anvil in a week's time, Father Pesci tells me. He's in the back room doing some polishing now. Only light work, and we've little enough of that, but with Kiel gone ... "

Tilara says, "That's good to hear. I'm glad he's able to do something to keep busy while he heals. As for being paid? I think we'd prefer getting paid as we retrieved things, all things considered.""

"That's perfectly fine, Tilara. So one great club, 7 arrows ... That will be ... here, 5 silver, and 3 copper. Let me just get that out of the strongbox." With that Jane pulls out a small key and opens up a locked chest, carefully counting out the coins before handing them to Tilara.

Yuri wanders into Jane's, looking thoughtful.

Jane looks up. "Ah, Yuri! Have you seen your father yet?"

Yuri looks up, wide-eyed. "No! Not at all! Haven't seen hide nor hair of him, nor he of me!"

Jane tsks at Yuri. "He **is** looking for you, you know. Should I let him know you're back in town?

Yuri digs out a few gold coins. "I'm here to make a purchase, miLady. Do you have any daggers?"

Yuri shakes his head at Jane. "No, I'm sure that won't be necessary. We'll find each other soon enough."

Jane nods at Yuri, and pulls out three daggers. "Daggers? Certainly. We have a nice simple pair of silver throwing daggers, and a fine strong steel dagger. 8 gold for the trio?"

Yuri nods, slowly... "Hmm. That reminds me. Do you know a Mariana?"

Tilara puts the coins in her pouch, waiting until Yuri's done with his purchases.

"Mariana ... Mariana ... No, I can't say the name rings a bell, Yuri. Sorry." Jane shrugs. "Anything I can help you with, Tilara?"

Tilara says, "How about Berina?"

Yuri forks over 8 gold.

Jane smiles. "My sister? She's visiting daddy dearest; making his life a right wonderful hell."

Yuri says, "Nobody seems to be sure if Gerrold is more upset over being burgled or over the presence of his eldest daughter."

Jane laughs happily. "He's been burgled, too? Oh, this is just too wonderful."

Tilara chuckles. "Sounds about right. She paid us a visit - said that you had a dagger of hers in for repairs that got stolen with the rest, and asked if we'd just give it back to her if we found it."

Yuri nods. "It appears that he wasn't involved in the robbery of your shop, miLady Jane. If that's the case, I'm guessing that you wouldn't want us to find any evidence to that effect."

Jane sobers up immediately. "She said ... " Thunderclouds gather, as she visibly reins in her temper. "I see." Her voice could cause Hell to freeze over.

Yuri shivers, involuntarily.

Tilara suppresses her own reaction as Jane's anger becomes obvious. "I take it she was ... less than entirely truthful?"

Jane glares. "You tell her from me that the next time ... no, don't tell her. You're not getting paid enough to carry **that** message. Just make sure you return the dagger to me, and nobody will get hurt."

Tilara nods. "We will, then. I gathered that for some reason she thought this would be an opportunity for it to become 'lost'... is there anything we should know about it?"

Jane shrugs. "You're better off not knowing. Safer, in any case."

Tilara shrugs. "Not if we end up going up against someone using it, perhaps."

Jane hmmmms. "You may have a point, Tilara. Let me say this; it has a flat green stone in the hilt. If you see someone wielding it, leave. Don't fight, don't argue, don't try to make a point. Just leave. And tell me about it, please."

Tilara nods, then. "Green flat stone, avoid at all costs. Got it. Anything else, Yuri?"

Yuri says, "Did we tell her that some of the bandits were wearing Gerrold's armor?"

Tilara says, "I think you just did. Confirms that they got robbed, too, I think. It wasn't nearly as good as your gear, either..."

Yuri grins. "Well... after you got done with it, no."

Jane smiles. "They are, are they. Well, bring 'em here. I'll pay you 10 percent on those too. It's time I was branching out ..."

Tilara grins, and does her best to look innocent.

Yuri says, "Excuse me, I have more digging to do. Signs point to the Middens. It seems a gang of thugs is getting organized, and I'm trying to learn the hows and wheres."

Yuri leaves by the front door, carefully inspecting the street outside first for signs of spies. Or Moshi.

Tilara says, "Hmm. What did happen to those two bandits we caught, Andreth? You gave 'em to a caravan, which way were they headed?"

Andreth ahs ... "Headed to town. Merchant promised he'd give 'em to the town guard."

Tilara says, "Let's go check if they did, then, shall we?"

Tilara grins and sweeps a bow to the blacksmith. "By your leave, milady Jane?"

Jane smiles. "Certainly. Good hunting."

---

Tilara and Andreth leave Jane's and head for the town guard. At the front door of the compound a single guard is standing, leaning on his pike. "Yes?"

Tilara smiles as sunnily as she can at the fellow. "Did a caravan turn over a couple bandits to the guard a few days ago?"

The guard nods. "Sure did. We sold 'em to temple. That way they could pay for the healing and their crimes at the same time."

Tilara continues to grin. "D'you know what happened to the equipment they had when they were brought in?"

The guard nods again. "Yep. Went into our coffers. Captain was pleased as punch; them was fine armor. Almost new."

Tilara grins. "A bit scorched, I'm afraid. Okay, thank you. We wanted to make sure they weren't on the loose somewhere."

The guard shakes his head. "No miss, they're all locked up nice and tight. And say, miss, did you know that there's a wonderful public bath house in the Artisans' Quarter? You look like you could use with a little freshing up. Ask for Martha; she's my sister, she'll do you up right and tight."

Tilara chuckles. "We just got in from hunting bandits, ourselves. And yes, I know where it is.. I grew up here. Thanks!" She heads off in that direction, at least until she's out of the fellow's sight, and then returns to Father Pesci's little shrine.

---

Starguard stands on the porch, his armor off as he sweeps, the lawn clipped back a bit already. A little light work.

Tilara is busily watching Starguard sweep when Yuri comes in. "Anything of interest besides what we told Jane?"

Yuri nods.

Yuri says, "I found a few things out."

Yuri says, "I think something's going on around the Tannery. There was a fire a little while ago and it's been closed since while they wait for new hides. Also, someone bought the Old Goat, near the tannery, and there's been a lot of comings and goings there."

Tilara says, "Big Joe?"

Yuri shakes his head. "Nobody named any names. Speaking of tanning hides, Moshi wants to tan mine."

Tilara chuckles. "No surprise, is it? We'll just avoid that part of town, then."

Yuri says, "Ilya's got a few obstacles to marrying Elena, but that seems like it's best dealt with another time."

Tilara says, "Your father doesn't think she's good enough, or something?"

Yuri says, "Thuggery is down in the middens, for whatever reason. The last caravan left bigger than it came, and they only left one man behind... supposedly for stealing from them. He's disappeared. "

Starguard nods. "Um, Father Pesci gave me a few vials for if we go to tea. We're supposed to secretly drink them before...Oo Chong? Oo Chang? Something like that.

Tilara says, "How are we supposed to secretly drink something in front of Berina?"

Starguard says, "Sit on different sides of her works. Make her unable to watch all of us."

Tilara nods to Starguard. "Good thought, that should work."

Yuri says, "Ah. Berina. Not a lot about her floating around, except that she's well-known in the Citadel. What for, exactly, nobody can say."

Starguard says, "Actually, the charm school is what it is. Royalty goes through it to learn manners, etiquette, and vamping, apparently."

Tilara giggles. "Vamping? To learn how, or to recognize it so they can avoid it?"

Starguard says, "Both is my guess. You have to admit she's \_very\_ good."

Yuri says, "Oh. I thought it was a euphemism for something else."

Yuri says, "Gerrold's either mad or busy or both. He hammers day and night. Whether it's because he got robbed, or because Berina's here, or because he has a big order to fill... he's not saying."

Yuri says, "I think the Old Goat would be worth a look. And maybe the Tannery."

Yuri says, "Does the name 'Ferg' mean anything to anyone? It sounds familiar."

Starguard says, "I'll go with you tomorrow. For tonight, let's rest. Terg? Hmm..."

Yuri says, "No, Ferg. Somebody's said that name to me recently."

Tilara says, "He's the fellow in charge of the bandit camp."

Yuri says, "He was the guy that got discharged from the caravan for theft."

Tilara says, "How long back? That's who the guards were taking us to see when you ... interrupted them."

Yuri says, "Just this last market, it seems."

Tilara says, "Interesting..."

Yuri nods.

Starguard says, "I'm beginning to think that there's a lot of forces at work here. And not just the Red Lint Faction."

Tilara says, "Wheels within wheels within wheels...."

Yuri says, "Well... he's out there, but we're here."

Yuri says, "What shall we do tonight?"

Starguard says, "Poker?"

Yuri says, "I had something more productive in mind, but all things considered, we've gotten our carcii trod on enough this week. Poker sounds like an excellent idea."

Yuri says, "I have rooms at the boarding house, if you'd prefer something slightly softer than the temple's pallats."

Starguard says, "Not me. I need to stay tonight."

Tilara grins. "Ooooo. They have rocks there?"

Starguard says, "And they're not that bad! I've slept on them for a year!"

Yuri sighs. "Well, Andreth's run off. Would you like the other room, Tilara? I paid for two and it would be good that they get used.

Tilara grins and gives Starguard a peck on the cheek. "Take care of yourself, you young swot." She nods to Yuri. "Certainly. I'll play poker with you, if you want, too."

---

In the morning, the party reassembles at the temple, where Brother starguard keeps shushing everyone. Father Pesci, it appears, woke up with a monster of a hangover. And he's out of hangover cures.

Yuri says, "Right... we've got leads. Which shall we follow?"

Starguard says, "I think we should go to the Old Goat. It should be quiet around now. After all the patrons should all be _suffering from hangovers_."

Starguard says that last bit \_just\_ loud enough to make Pesci wince.

Yuri says, "How about the Tannery, first?"

Tilara says, "Might as well. Mirra?"

Mirra meows happily, sneaking around Tilara's legs. Someone fed her some meat this morning.

Yuri says, "But first... breakfast?"

Starguard nods. "There's a place just going into the middens where you can pick up a deadly sausage in a bun...

Yuri winces. "On second, thought, maybe not.

Tilara grins, touching noses with her familiar. "Someone's already had two breakfasts, but I'm game. Though not for something like a sausage in a bun."

_Second breakfast?_ Mirra bats at Tilara playfully.

Starguard smiles. "Lets go into the Middens while everyone's still groggy then."

The Tannery isn't hard to find; even when the vats are empty the stench still carries deep into the middens. So early in the morning, the streets are mostly lined with urchins, most of which avoid the party like the plague.

Yuri scowls.

Yuri says, "It's a good thing I'm getting these clothes replaces when we're done. I'll never get the stench out."

The Tannery itself looks thoroughly deserted.

Yuri murmurs to the others, "Want me to case the place?"

Starguard stays to the back, letting Mirra and Yuri scout ahead... "Not me. I'll watch our back."

Tilara nods. "How are we thinking of getting in?"

Tilara notices the kids avoiding the group. "Yuri, why aren't the kids begging for money? They usually mob anyone who looks like they might have something for them."

Yuri says, "Whatever way, it will be the hard way, I'm sure."

Yuri looks around.

The Tannery is a large-ish complex, especially in a place like the Middens where land is dearly come by. The doors are boarded up, and the shutters closed. The store on the side is nearly empty, and manned by a single young boy.

Yuri says, "I think it's just that we don't look like easy marks, Tilara."

One of the braver kids, a kid who looks familiar, sidles up to Starguard, and tugs on his sleeve. The kid smiles. "Sell you news for another silver, sir?"

Yuri blinks down at the kid. "You again?"

Tilara nods to Yuri, then grins. "Hey, look who's back."

Yuri says, "How about half-now and half if it's worth hearing, hmmm?"

The kid snickers. "I don't sell bad news, sir. Big Joe's been getting his come-uppance, he has. Lost three of his recruits already. And I know where he's training now."

Starguard huhs. "No news there, lad. We know all that."

Tilara scowls. "Just three? We're slipping." She digs out a silver. "Sounds like it's on the level, though. Where?"

Yuri looks bemused. "Yeah. I mean, we sorta were there, you know?"

The kid ohs, belligerently. "Well, how'm I s'posed to know what you knows?" Snatching the coin, he points back up the street. "They're at the old Goat. And Big Joe's got this fire torch kid; they're trying to keep him from burning anything else down. Silly kid."

Yuri says, "Hold on a minute. This kid - did he set the fire that closed the tannery?"

The kid looks slyly up at Yuri. "Cost you a silver, that will."

Starguard says, "No need for that lad. If we need to pay you to tell us that there are 10 coppers in a silver, we'll let you know."

Yuri narrows his eyes at the kid, and fishes out ten coppers. "Just remember that we're doing business here because it's cheaper than arguing."

The kid grins at the copper. "Easier to spend at that. Yeah, the kid was trying to learn to control his inner flame, or something like that, and he accidentally burnt the untanned leather past repair. So they're waiting on old Stumpy Stan to come up with more."

Tilara twitches an eyebrow. "Sounds like me, a few years back. I wonder...."

Yuri says, "You have a name, young swot?"

Starguard gives Yuri a look...

Yuri nods at Tilara. "That's not lost on me, either. This could be tricky."

The kid nods eagerly. "I'm Templar, cuz on account I was born on the temple steps. You can ask any of my mates; they'll find me if you need more knowledge, cuz, like, I sell knowledge."

Tilara blinks at that image. _**Born** on the temple steps? His mother was in that much of a hurry?_

Yuri forks over the copper. "Alright. Stay out of trouble, Templar, 'cause a lot a people would be upset to know that we know what you told us and that is was you what told us, right?"

The kid shrugs. "They'll have ta catch me first. Happy hunting." With that, he disappears between two buildings.

Yuri says, "Right. Shall we check out the Old Goat? We should be careful here. This is like stepping on an adder's den."

Starguard nods. "Careful, folks. I'd rather not get skewered again."

The Old Goat lies just beyond the Tannery, a few feet deeper into the Middens. It's a large warehouse, and it seems odd that it's lain empty for so very many years. Even if it **is** right behind the Tannery, with all that that implies about stench.

The Goat has been built up to two stories, with huge doors opening on the street, and large windows on the second to provide natural light on the inside. Around the building a natural alley has formed, as nobody has built up against it.

Yuri looks up at it, and motions the party to keep still for a moment. "If we just waltz up there, I know we're gonna die.

Two kids are playing a game involving pebbles, a stick, and a straw doll dressed in red, in the street in front of the front doors.

Yuri says, "Tilara? Can you ask Mirra to have a look-see for us?"

Tilara nods. "As long as the kids don't decide she's there to play with her. Mirra?" She nuzzles the cat for a moment, telling her what is needed.

Starguard looks up at the windows for a moment, then focuses on making sure that no-one's following.

Mirra meows, and set off around the building. It doesn't take her long to return. _doors closed_ .

Mirra butts Tilara in the knee. _Metal strikes metal_

Yuri looks around for an easy way up onto a roof.

Tilara and the others keep walking slowly down the street. Mirra returns, and she passes on the information. "Nothing open - and she hears metal striking metal. We may want to get out of here."

Yuri murmurs to the others, "Do you maybe want to re-try what we did at the barn? I'll go see what I can find out, and everyone else hangs back?

Starguard nods. "Sounds alright. Though this time, I'll watch our backs. Take Mirra with you?"

Yuri says, "You're gonna need somewhere to hide."

Yuri looks around for somewhere - anywhere - that the others won't be standing in the middle of the street looking obvious.

Just across from the warehouse, and a little north, a small alley leads to what looks like ... just possibly ... a tavern of sorts. Several men lie passed out.

Yuri says, "That will do. You can see the warehouse from there and you won't stand out."

Andreth follows everyone into the alley, keeping quiet, and watching the drunks warily.

Starguard trails behind, carefully watching the party's back.

Yuri crawls quickly up a few plaster walls, crumbling chimneys, eaves, roofs, and gutters, quickly gaining the third story of a roof next to the warehouse.

The drunks groan occasionally, but don't otherwise move. Not a one of them is dressed in natty, or clean, clothes.

Yuri doesn't want to make noise... he looks for a plank or something he can use as a bridge.

Starguard puts his back to a wall, making sure that Tilara's out of harm's way.

Yuri takes a deep breath and a short running start, hoping he doesn't punch right through the roof on the other side.

Yuri says, "Scheist."

Yuri steps back about twenty feet and runs at the edge of the roof. As he's about to lift off into space, he notices the ledge crumbling beneath him. Frantically, he twists trying to catch himself, as he falls down three stories in midair.

Within seconds, Yuri lands in a tangled sprawl on the ground. Blood spreads out beneath him, and his arm is twisted at an unnatural angle.

Yuri is still falling when Tilara stands up. "Uh-oh. C'mon, Starguard..."

Mirra comes streaking into the tavern. _Falling Yuri!_

Starguard blinks, and looks confused. "What's going on?"

Tilara says, "Yuri fell. C'mon."

Andreth looks alarmed, and follows behind the others.

Starguard blinks, and hurries, running after Tilara and Mirra.

Yuri's body is easily found in the alley, where it lies sprawled in an ungainly pile.

Starguard blinks, and flashes to the young man's side. Quickly, he attempts to staunch the wounds...

Yuri moans. "I give up."

Yuri says, "We should get out of here."

Starguard nods. "Here. Let me get you mobile." He lays his hands on the worst of the wounds. "Aid me heavenly guardians, let this man's injuries close. Heal Minor!"

Tilara says, "Before you attract any more attention? Why'd you jump off the building?"

Yuri says, "I just couldn't resist the ground..."

Yuri says, "It called to me.."

Andreth says, "Let's just get outta here. We ain't gonna get anything done this mornin'."

Tilara says, "No doubt... let's go before anyone else shows up. I didn't want any rat-flavored beer, anyway."

Slowly Yuri drags himself to his feet. Slowly the party returns to Father Pesci's temple, to recuperate and ponder what they'd seen.
