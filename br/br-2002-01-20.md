Game Log: Chapter 6 - Joe's Hideout


---------------------------------------

_Brother Starguard is a tall man, strangely dressed in the brown work clothes of the acolyte cleric. The strange part is because he seems too old to be an student in the church. His thick, bushy, mustache and beard, once black, is now salt and pepper, the darkness interspersed with star-like flecks of white. His face is light and lively, blue eyes sparkling, though with a few hard wrinkles, a few laugh lines. His nose is a bit hawkish, giving him a bit of an intense look. His body seems in decent shape, if not particularly strong, but most of his form is hidden beneath the cloth of his clothes. He wears a midnight blue robe, short, with easy release clips so that he doesn't get caught by it in a fight. Depending on the situation, he may also wear his studded leather armor, but always has his morning star at his hip, in case of trouble. He walks more like a soldier than a priest...but the wooden symbol of the two stars entwined hung on the leather strap states otherwise._

_Tilara is a young woman both pretty and possessing that indefinable presence that transforms mere attractiveness into beauty. She has bright red-gold hair and laughing emerald eyes in a tanned face. Her graceful and athletic figure is partially hidden by the practical traveling clothes she wears, dark green tunic and brown leggings with black boots and a dark grey cloak. She carries a quarterstaff, and her tortoise-shell cat is usually either riding her shoulder or twining about her feet._

_Yuri is a young man of average height and wiry build, with sandy blonde hair and an easy, fluid demeanor. He has a ready smile and a glimmer in his eye. He is dressed in a leather jerkin, light wool trousers, soft boots, and a fine wool cloak, all in subdued grey tones. The hilt of a rapier is visible at his belt; otherwise, he seems rather lightly equipped._

Yuri sits on a pallet in the Temple to the Stars, looking battered and surly.

Father Pesci sits hunched over his desk, his head cradled in both hands. When he hears the door open, he looks up, and whimpers. Seeing Starguard, he lowers his head again, and moans.

Tilara nods to the good Father and goes over to sit beside Yuri. "Feeling better?"

Starguard sighs. Herbalist. Right. Bur first things first: "Here Yuri, lay down for a second and we'll get you improved."

Yuri says, "A little. I can't believe that happened."

Yuri obediently lies down.

Father Pesci looks up, his face strained and white. "What happened to Yuri? I **just** patched him up ...

Starguard says, "Did you trip or something?" He places his hands on the young man's chest. "Healing stars, aid me and mend these wounds. Heal Light!""

Yuri's injuries heal, but his mood remains sullen.

Yuri says, "Thanks. I feel better."

Tilara says, "Good. Next time, don't be so stubborn and eat the nice spider. It's much easier when you can stick to the walls."

Father Pesci looks over at Starguard, and grumbles, sighing deeply. "Right. Go save the world, Starguard. I'm going shopping."

Starguard says, "Actually, just relax father. I'll go see my mother about hangover cures."

Yuri says, "We need a different approach. We can't just barge in, nor does sneaking in appear to have worked that well. Andreth, you grew up in the Middens. What would YOU do?"

Andreth promptly responds, "Stay away." He gives a wry grin, and rubs his stubbly chin.

Starguard sighs. "Well, you young 'uns plan, and I'll go get the herbs I'll need if it's a bad plan. Be back shortly?"

Father Pesci snorts. "I'll keep them here, young un. Off you go. Oy veh; I'm never drinking again."

Starguard nods, and heads out.

Tilara stares after the departing cleric. "You'd think we made bad plans a lot..."

Yuri sighs. "If we could steal back most of Jane's stolen weapons, we'd be all set. It doesn't even have to turn into a standup fight.

Tilara says, "Hmm. Good point, that."

Andreth says, "Seriously... dunno. Them's some tough bastards is working for Big Joe... even if he has gone into hidin' right now, I hear."

Tilara says, "Oh, really? The rumors have any idea why?"

Andreth shakes his head. "And it ain't just him. Everyone seems to be layin' low right now, have been for the past couple weeks."

Yuri says, "That was before we got involved in this mess. What's wrong, the thieves in the Middens go on strike or something?"

Andreth scratches his head. "It don't add up, true. Oh, I do recall where Big Joe's supposedta been promisin' money to anyone who signs up. Guess he's plannin' somethin' big and needs more muscle than normal."

Yuri says, "Oh, dear. We're going to derail the plans of a medium-scale crime boss with large-scale ambitions?"

Yuri says, "That's not going to make him happy."

Yuri says, "If they're training at the Old Goat, what's the best time to catch them unawares? Do you think they'll sleep at night?"

Tilara says, "That's what we've contracted to do.. though nobody realized it at the time."

Andreth says, "Well, this is prob'ly how come he wants all them swords 'n stuff." He rubs his chin some more, making a rasping sound. "There's more. Someone said there's some kinda plan to tear down some 'a the slums to put up new buildin's. And the Goat's on the list, they do say."

Tilara says, "They had guards at the farm, they'll probably have guards there, too. It should be quieter, though. Easier to avoid one guard than a whole slew of highwaymen-in-training."

Andreth says, "Nuh uh. They stay up late in the middens. You wanna hit 'em when they're sleeping, do it in the mornin' when they're a-sleepin' off their hangovers."

Tilara says, "So, then.. maybe a couple hours before dawn?"

Yuri says, "We could just try again tomorrow."

Yuri says, "If they really were that baked, they probably didn't notice me falling outside their windows."

The door opens to admit old Starguard. Quickly, he tosses the packet of herbs that make up the hangover cure to Pesci. "So, have you decided?"

Father Pesci gingerly picks up the herbs, and disappears into the other room to steep them. He closes the door very quietly and very firmly behind him.

Starguard holds up the two glass vials. "I decided to get these, as well. Cure Minor potions for emergencies. Would two of you like to carry them?"

Tilara looks out the window at the sun. "I'm thinking that they'd be getting up by now. Probably not a good idea to go back until tomorrow."

Yuri says, "So... what are we going to do today, Tilara?"

Tilara says, "Dunno yet. We could visit your parents..." She gives a totally unrepentant grin at Yuri's reaction. "Or maybe not."

Yuri's eyes widen in only partially-mock horror.

Starguard says, "I think we should apply as muscle and see what kind of resources they have."

Tilara says, "What, all of us? And if they recognize us from that last fight?"

Yuri says, "That thought had crossed my mind, but I don't really think we're subtle enough for that."

Tilara says, "We don't look desperate enough, either."

Yuri says, "Maybe Andreth?"

Andreth mmphs. "They'd know me straight off, if they saw me before." He traces the scar on his face.

Starguard shrugs. "We've never actually left survivors. No-one knows what we look like..."

Andreth says, "Some of the bigger boys are sporting some awfully shiny lookin' new stuff, by the way."

Yuri says, "The first two guttersnipes survived. Didn't Tilara say they got their penal contract sold to the temple or something?"

Tilara nods. "So the fellow at the gaol said. I'm not sure I'd trust that they haven't had a chance to talk to one of their old colleagues."

Starguard ahs. "I'd forgot about them. We could disguise ourselves. Or do something really dangerous."

Yuri says, "We could always go in the front door."

Tilara just raises an eyebrow. "What, more dangerous than getting you and Yuri nearly killed twice?"

Starguard says, "Going for tea."

Yuri says, "How about we go back and spend the rest of the day just keeping our eyes on the place? I'm sure something will come up."

Yuri says, "Alternatively, we could go and find out what's got Old Man Gerrold so riled up."

Tilara sighs. "And I was hoping not to have to drink any more rat-flavored beer..." She perks up at the mention of Gerrold. "Good point. D'you think we can persuade the good Father Pesci to tell us more about Berina when he's done having his cure?

Yuri says, "Ah, Berina. Fascinating woman. I do so hope to never meet her again."

Starguard says, "I think our best bet is to disguise ourselves and infiltrate. It's the best way to get information on them."

Tilara nods. "Could be. We've got several leads, now. Berina and old Gerrold himself - we could infiltrate the highwaymen and find out first hand what's going on. Well, probably not, but we could find out where the weapons are. Any other ideas?

Andreth grunts a little at Starguard. "Guess so."

Starguard shakes his head. "But where could we get disguise materials? I mean, Andreth's scar could be covered up with a little work...

Tilara grins. "A little makeup, perhaps? You think you'd look good in rouge, Andreth?"

Andreth winces most dramatically at Tilara.

Starguard grins. "I mean, he is small... I bet with a little work..." He smirks at his friend.

Tilara says, "Hmm... and a nice wig, and a pair of cantaloupes, maybe?"

Andreth's jaw drops. "You two gotta be kidding me."

Starguard grins. "Be glad to help, Tilara. I'll hold him down."

Yuri looks bemused.

Andreth shakes his head. "Wouldn't work, anyhow. Women don't go into thuggery, anyway. Usually it's more like..." He catches Tilara's eye, and stutters. "...well, they don't go into thuggery."

Tilara giggles. "No, I don't think he'd like it too well. And he'd smear it."

Yuri says, "Want me to go hit up Gerrold for info while you're at it?"

Tilara says, "Sounds like a good idea. We've found some of his armor on these guys and he's complaining about something. Let's find out."

As the morning turns to afternoon in discussion, Father Pesci finally opens the door again to reclaim his desk. "So; you have all your plans prepared now?"

Yuri nods, and levers himself off the palette. "So it would seem. Tilara, where shall I find you when I'm done at Gerrold's?

Tilara says, "Why not meet here?"

Yuri says, "Okee. Best of luck!"

Yuri wanders out towards the Forge.

Andreth says, "And I'm gonna get disguised up to see 'bout bein' a recruit." He glares at Tilara. "No rouge."

Starguard grins. "We'll have to incorporate the cantaloupes into Yuri's disguise."

Father Pesci looks worriedly at his former student. "Disguise? Cantaloupes? Out of season, where will you find those?"

Tilara says, "We could always just have them for breakfast... just kidding, Father."

Yuri reaches the Smithy after ambling along for some minutes. From outside the yard he can already hear the hammers ringing, and smoke is belching skywards. The gate is open, and people are moving at fast but controlled speeds inside.

Yuri slowly moves in through the open gate, sliding to one side. For the first time that he can remember, all the anvils are in use at the same time, and there are two **wives** manning the large bellows. To the side apprentices are carrying around gleaming red lumps of metal. Nobody notices Yuri.

Starguard frowns. "That's no good at all. You still look like you, Andreth."

Tilara sighs. "It's going to be tough to cover that scar. Let's try this..."

Andreth glances in a nearby mirror, and nods ruefully. It still looks like him. Only with a streak of makeup down his face.

Yuri looks around, and sees the forge the busiest it's ever been... two young men pounding what appears to be extra-heavy plate armor, but for someone very short... and several women working the bellows.

Yuri hears unfamiliar names, numbers that might be sizes, and armor types... and decides he wants a copy of that list.

Starguard says, "You just don't...you move like you always do, Andreth. We could make you look like Berina, and everyone would know it was you after a step."

Andreth manages a slight smile at the mental image. "Yeah... this disguise idea just ain't workin' out."

Tilara says, "Well... how well disguised does he need to be? Andreth, how well known are you over in the middens?"

Starguard says, "Just try to...look, bend over a little, and try to move less smoothly. You're a lunkheaded thug who doesn't know the first thing about hitting anything unless they have something sharp and pointy at hand."

Andreth tries, but it's difficult. Brother Oak's training goes pretty deep...

Andreth says, "Mmm... nah, they prob'ly don't know me all /that/ well."

Starguard's disguise is simpler. He doesn't shave, and removes his robes, showing his leather armor. He tries to glare, and look...weathered.

Starguard ahs. He hides his holy symbol beneath his shirt.

Tilara says, "Your trouble is, you look like a soldier anyway, Starguard."

Tilara says, "Better..."

Starguard sighs. "What can I do, Tilara? I'm used to fighting scum, not being them."

Tilara says, "At least you can look dangerous while disguised. The only thing I can think of is to do the trollop route. And then they might not notice you because they'll all be trying to paw me."

Andreth hmms. "Well... if I'm s'posed to not be able to hit stuff without a sharp pointy thing, maybe I oughtta be holding a sharp pointy thing. Could I have... er, gimme a dagger, Tilara."

Andreth remembers in mid-sentence that he's also not supposed to be polite.

Starguard shakes his head. "Go the cloak route. A thick enough cloak, and nobody can tell anything about you."

Tilara says, "That'll do it. A cloak and a dagger."

Tilara says, "Now... let's see..." She digs around in her makeup, overdoing it on her eyes, and combing back her hair. "Have to change clothes, too...""

As Yuri slides into the business office, he notices how quiet it is in here. There's no apprentice, waiting to serve him, and hardly any goods to be sold; both the bins and the shelves are empty, and only a single piece of armor; studded leather, and fresh studs at that, hangs from a display rack.

Tilara steps out of the room and comes back wearing a too-small blouse that she's half falling out of, a different hair style, and a convincing sway to her hips very much unlike her usual determined stride. "Like this, boys..."

Andreth stands up as Tilara re-enters the room after changing her clothes. "Hey! Who are you, and how'd you get in there?"

Starguard whistles. "That's \_very\_ impressive, Til.

Yuri looks around to see if anyone's left the books or the till unattended.

Father Pesci just smiles, sitting down behind his desk and steepling his fingers together in front of him. "You are well-armored now."

The moneybox is carefully locked, the books left closed beside it. There's a quill, still sharp, and a pot of ink, waiting.

Tilara winks at Andreth, and shifts her stance back to normal. "You see? As long as you cover anything really distinctive, it's all in the way you walk." She goes back to the slatternly pose. "Shall we go, honey?"

Starguard shakes his head. "What will we do with Yuri?"

Andreth recovers from his initial surprise. "...Damn, that's somethin' else. I'd never 'ave known it were you."

Tilara says, "We'll surprise him later. Shall we go see what's what with the folks down in the Middens?"

Starguard nods, and takes a position at Tilara's shoulder, glowering, and trying to look dangerous.

Carefully opening the top book, Yuri leafs through it, one eye and ear still focused on the door. _Now is not a good time to ... hmmm._ Checking the last page - dated more than a week ago - Yuri checks again. No sales have been recorded since two days before the Spring Fair.

Andreth follows on her other side, his hand constantly near the dagger on his belt as if he'd be utterly lost without it.

Mirra follows Tilara, mimicking her stance by swaying her hindquarters from side to side in a pseudo-slatternly fashion.

Tilara snickers at the commentary from her cat. _You're just being silly, love. Keep an eye on things for me, and don't stay too close, okay?_

Starguard hmms. "How about on my shoulder, Mirra? And look a bit mangy if you can?

Checking the other book, Yuri sees more sales, dated earlier. This book is filled, from cover to cover; he never knew the profit margins were so wide.

Tilara snorts. "Mirra is _not_ mangy. She just needs to be out ahead of us so we're not connected."

Mirra jumps up on to the desk, and from there jumps and claws her way to Starguard's shoulder. Having arrived, she drapes herself and looks hungrily at his pack.

Starguard pops open his pack. "In there, if you'd like. There's a bit of chicken I was saving for supper, but..."

Turning back to the new book, Yuri reads the entries more carefully, looking for anomalous payments. Everything seems aboveboard, although the smith is apparently incredibly fond of mead.

Mirra meows pitifully.

Yuri makes a note about the mead orders (who from, how much), then closes and resets the books.

Yuri returns to the temple, still being slightly sneakier than usual, and slips in the front door.

The party clomps through the middens, the trollop with two mean looking guards...

Father Pesci looks up at Yuri. "You just missed the trollop and the louts."

Yuri looks confused. "Huh? Do you mean Berina came back?

"Hey, babe, wanna meet a **real** man?"

"Hey, honey! You come in triplets? Wanna ... " A violent hipthrust accompanies this catcall.

Father Pesci smiles beatifically. "They never went to Berina; they spent the past hour playing dressup, and left for the middens ... less than five minutes ago."

Starguard grins. "Get lost. She's got 'er customers for now. You couldn't afford her any way, slackwit."

Andreth favors the onlooker with a glare.

Yuri says, "I'd better catch up, then. Gerrold looks like he's trying to armor a regiment. I don't think he's doing it at any thug's request. Even so, I should be with the others."

Tilara just laughs at the comments, occasionally getting in a dig back at one of them. "You think you could do me better than these two, honey? I don't think you've got the purse or the codpiece for it."

One of the louder louts steps forward. "Yeah, and who's gonna pay her after yer dead, old man? What's better; stroke or heart attack? Come on, mates, we found ourselves some prime meat today, and we're planning a party tonight ..." He looks at the offers Tilara makes. "And man; you could service all of us, I'd wager ..."

Yuri says, "Oh, wait... Dressup? What do they look like now?"

Yuri waves to Father Pesci and hustles out the door... he weaves his way through alleys and sidestreets, not skulking, but not out in the open, either.

The man puts his hands on hips, and surveys Tilara thoroughly, before motioning some of his friends over. "Skinny hips, but nice boobs. And good lips. We like good lips, don't we, lads. And such a nice voice ..."

Father Pesci grins. "Dressup? Just look for the tart and the mincemeat ..."

Starguard growls. "Surely you'd be too tired from bleeding to do much, friend? Why don't you go hire another?"

Tilara says, "What kind of party were you plannin', then? Or did you just come up with the idea?"

Andreth grunts, and subtly tries to hustle his friends along.

Yuri thinks, _Not sure that will narrow it down..._

Andreth turns his face toward Starguard (and away from the large lout) and hisses between his teeth, "just keep moving."

The man turns slightly, letting the afternoon sunlight ripple off his toned and bronzed muscles. "Why, honey, every night's a party for a man like me. And tonight we'll be celebrating our new friends." The man pauses, looking at Starguard and Andreth. "Or at least, new friend. You two can sod off."

Some of the man's friends begin to loiter more closely ...

Starguard growls. "C'mon, let's go. I paid good coin."

Yuri slows to a walk as he comes upon the scene, and angles to come up behind the thugs... invisible to them, but hopefully apparent to Tilara.

Tilara grins at the big fellow. "He did, too. I'll come back this evening if you're really having a party, honey. Can't disappoint the customers, though, or you won't have any." She lets Andreth move her along.

The man puts his hand on Tilara's arm. "Now, now, honey; we don't want **them** fouling the sugar pot. Come along; we'll even let you eat before you work."

Starguard finally decides enough is enough and goes to slug the impertinent lout. Unfortunately, his move must have been telegraphed as he's already moving.

The lout growls at the impertinent and incapable fist, taking one step back so he has room to loosen his very large club, which he swings comfortably into Starguard's nose, staggering him, collapsing the cleric to the ground.

Yuri sees Starguard get his block knocked off and decides that this isn't a time to be nice. He pulls a dagger and makes to backstab the nearest ruffian.

Tilara screams and crouches down beside Starguard, shielding him from onlookers in case he wants to cast a spell. She slips a dagger out of her sleeve as she does so... this is escalating too rapidly for her tastes.

Yuri leaps ahead and sticks his dagger firmly into the back of Mr. Happy-go-Ugly... who, surprisingly, doesn't keel over. The thug howls more in rage than pain, and Yuri begins to look nervous.

Andreth has been nervous about the big lout ever since he came on the scene. When he sees Starguard go down, he throws caution to the winds and, with an earsplitting "KIAI!", drives a fist right into the man's solar plexus. The thug makes a surprised gurgle, and topples over.

The louts look on, wide-eyed, and then slowly begin to back away, trying very hard to look as though they had nothing to do with the toppled man. Nothing at all. no way. Nu-huh ...

Yuri turns to look at the nearest thug, before he bolts. "Hold on, you. Where do you think YOU'RE going?"

Starguard grumbles, wiping his eyes. "So that's how you do that punching thing." With a heavy sigh, he mutters, "Healing Stars, help this old fool. Cure Light!"

The man looks pale. "We're ... just ... ummm ... hi. Sorry; late for work! Gotta run!" With that the man turns off his heels and runs.

Tilara fusses over Starguard, acting all weepy and melodramatic, and distracting the onlookers with cleavage so that they won't notice the cleric's spellcasting. "Are you okay? Did that nasty thug hurt you?" She gets up when the others run, and kicks the one who's down. "Idiot."

Yuri quickly asks Andreth, "I'll go for that one, you try for the other?"

Tilara murmurs, "Let them go. They're not important, and we didn't break cover."

The now much paler muscles barely clench as the thug gets kicked in a sensitive area. A little blood runs out of his mouth.

Yuri nods. "Well, what are we gonna do with Seamus McBeef here?

Andreth grunts, and stares at the bigger thug, trying to get a closer look at him.

Starguard bahs, wiping his nose of blood. "I'm fine. It was just a lucky shot."

Yuri fades back into the shadows of a nearby eave, to keep his face hidden from anyone who might be around.

Tilara checks the greatclub for a maker's mark.

The thug looks a lot smaller when he's all doubled over like this. He looks familiar, mind you, and that's some spectacular muscular development ... and really heavy brows. And a nice shining great club ....

Yuri says, "Brother, can we make sure this guy doesn't die? Jane will want to talk to him."

Tilara looks to Starguard. "You're the healer... is he in danger?"

Andreth says quietly, "Be careful with 'im when 'e wakes up. I t'ink..." He swallows. "I t'ink I just took down Big Joe."

Starguard blinks at Andreth. "Beg pardon?"

Yuri's face goes slack, and he takes off his belt to bind Big Joe's hands behind his back.

Yuri says, "Anyone else got anything we can use on his feet? Starguard, we need him alive."

Starguard places his hands on Big Joe. "Stars above, heal a scratch or two. Heal minor.

Andreth nods to Starguard. "I'm pretty sure this is Big Joe."

The man opens one eye, and moans for a moment. "What ... what hit me?"

Andreth says, simply, "Me."

The man looks up at Andreth. "Who ... the ... hell ... are you?"

Andreth keeps mum, glancing at Starguard, as if to indicate who'll be doing the asking.

Yuri mumbles to Tilara, "Do you have anything for his feet? We can't have him getting lose."

The man looks over at Starguard, his breathing still labored. "And why does ... this old ... weakling ... speak for ... you?"

Tilara grins. "Cause he's the brains of our little outfit, sugar.."

Starguard considers kicking Big Joe, but manages to avoid it. "I'm sure not the brawn or the beauty or the sneaky person.

"That must mean ... sugar pot ... that you're ... ugh. The money maker ..."

Tilara just grins, staying in character. "Sometimes, sugar. Sometimes."

The man's face brightens; barely, considering he's hunched over in pain and drenched in sweat due to like causes, but brighter just the same. "See ... sugar pot ... we should have left ... these ... thugs behind. I could ... ugh ... offer you a good ... job." He gasps, falling back a little, and clasping his ribs.

Tilara says, "You were being rude, sugar. I told you they'd paid me for today. Never interrupt a working girl with her customers."

"We could have ... made it worth ... your while. Still can ... in fact. You would make ... an excellent ... aaaaah." He lies back, clearly exhausted. "I need a drink."

Yuri says, "Perhaps we should get him a drink and discuss business."

Tilara says, "An excellent what? You do make it sound interesting. Shall we go somewhere to talk a bit less... open?""

Starguard smiles. "There's a thought... We could let him rest a bit while we..." He waggles his eyebrows at Tilara.

The man remains where he is. "The spirit ... sugar pot ... is willing ... but the body is a little ... tattered."

Yuri looks around at the faces in the party, trying to gauge what everyone is thinking.

Andreth has no idea what to do at this point... this is far more than he'd ever counted on at this stage.

Yuri removes his belt from Big Joe's hands, carefully watching to see if he tries anything funny.

Starguard is smiling a little. This turned out well. His pack is moving a little as Mirra finds the chicken.

Yuri rethreads his belt.

Yuri murmurs to Starguard, "Spell?"

Starguard shrugs. "He's going to be fine. I'd rather not waste the effort."

Yuri looks around for somewhere nearby that might sell him a drink, and pulls his hat low to conceal his face.

Andreth says, "We oughta get him out of the road, at least."

The street; much quieter now than it was before; contains two small pub like buildings. The placards outside seem to indicate that one is the Frothing Hogshead, and the other is the Pissing Kestrel.

Yuri goes to the closer pub, he doesn't care which, and quickly gets a big flagon of whatever qualifies as their top ale.

Yuri points at the Pissing Kestrel. "Let's get him in there."

"A ... drink, sugar pot? This is ... not ... the way to treat ... a business ... associate." The man struggles, trying to sit up. "And ... perhaps ... a massage?"

Yuri sighs.

Yuri murmurs to Starguard, "Can we at least bandage him so that he won't fall over on his way to the gin shop?

Tilara chuckles. "You do have a one-track mind, sugar. I don't think a massage would be good for you with all the damage my quiet friend did you."

The man winks, very slowly and carefully; obviously moving his eyelids hurt. "Ah ... sugar pot ... just do not ... rub quite ... so high ..."

Starguard nods, and fishes a bandage out of his pack, to bind the worst of it. After a few moments, frowning, he nods, and scoops the great club. "There. Let's get in the inn."

Tilara says, "Or whatever they are..."

Slowly Tilara and Andreth lift Big Joe to his feet, dragging him to the Frothing Hogshead. Everybody has to duck under the lintel to make it inside, where little light penetrates. There are no windows, ony a few scattered benches, and a single table up against the far wall. The bartender, an old fat man, stands behind two plans stretched over two upright barrels, polishing clumps of clay. Big Joe smiles, trying to cop a feel, as he is dragged over to a bench up against the wall, where he can sag gracelessly.

Yuri makes sure that everyone else makes it inside, then goes back for Joe's club. He hides it in a convenient place until later.

Yuri wanders up to the bartender and orders flagons all around - weak ale for everyone except Big Joe, who gets something stronger.

Yuri fishes in his pocket for a few battered coppers to pay - no sense flashing cash.

The bartender looks suspiciously at Yuri. "Flagons? Ye can take yer mugs, or ye can take yer barrels. I have no size in between. And I'll be seeing the coins first ..."

Big Joe sags up against the wall. "So ... sugar ... pot. Is ... he ..." Big Joe turns slowly to look at Andreth, "... for sale? We can ... use ... a few ... more ... boys ..."

Yuri scowls at the bartender, and quickly changes his mind. He throws a silver (an older one) down on the bar, and barks, "Mugs. Don't try my patience. We have business to discuss with our big friend and you'll not be interfering.

Starguard stows the club out of site. We won, we won't give it back unless he asks for it.

Andreth nods slowly. "Maybe," he says in a low gravelly voice.

The bartender snaps up the coin, making it disappear, before pouring out a frothing pale yellow liquid into five somewhat misshapen clay mugs. He moves out from behind the bar, and carries the mugs to the table himself, after moving the singular table over to stand in front of big Joe. "Is there anything else I can do for you?"

Starguard frowns. "Bugger off?" he suggest, throwing a couple of coppers toward the tender.

The bartender dexterously catches all four copper coins, and carefully hides them, too, before retreating behind the planked bar and studiously ignoring the party. There are, as yet, only two other drinkers in the bar, and they're ignoring you too.

Starguard offers the beer to Big Joe. "You said you had a proposition for us, then?"

Big Joe slowly raises the mug to his lips, wincing as blood in his mouth mixes with the barely palatable drink. "We ... are ... oh, this is good. We are starting ... a new endeavor ... and we need ... associates."

Starguard says, "I don't bullshit around about jobs, you'll find. What's the dangers, what's the pay, what's the perks, and what else do we need to know?"

Big Joe grimaces. "We offer ... weapons ... training ... and supplies ... and reasonable shares ... of the profits ... The only danger ... is the gallows, and sugar pot ... we pay well for our ... perks ... and our perks ... are well ... compensated ... and "

Starguard says, "We've got weapons, the boy kicked your arse, so training won't help. Anything else?"

Yuri hides his reaction behind a poker face. _Oi, Starguard, that's laying it on a bit TOO thick..._

"We offer ... a safe ... haven ... where you can ... enjoy ... our ... sugar pots ... honey. And as we expand ... we expect ... our profits ... to soar. Perhaps you would ... like to meet ... our leader?" Big Joe leans back, plainly exhausted.

Tilara shrugs. "Gallows ain't adding any new dangers on, either." She looks at Starguard. "Might want to see if they've got nicer weapons than what we've got. And it sounds like there might be a bit of cash in it."

Starguard nods. "Good points, dear." He allows himself to be encouraged. "Sure. Who's the leader?"

Big Joe slowly opens one eye. "More ... beer?"

Yuri silently gets up and fetches a... hmm, what's better than beer?

Yuri murmurs to the Bartender, "Something stronger. What have you got?"

The bartender turns around very very slowly, looking at Yuri. "We have Potapkan Ale ... in abundance. A gold a mug."

Starguard nods. "He's gone to get some. Here, have mine in the meantime." He offers his untouched mug.

Yuri just looks at the bartender, mild disbelief on his face, and waits a few beats.

Big Joe shrugs philosophically, draining the second mug. He's slowly regaining a little color, even if he's not looking healthy yet. "Our ... Leader? We ... can not ... I can take ... you ... to him ..."

The bartender looks back, waiting for several moments, before shrugging. "Or you can pay the usual two silver for a single portion."

Starguard frowns. "And we don't come in at ground level, obviously. Your grunts ran away. We don't do that.

Yuri nods, and slides over two (worn) silver. He gives the shot to Joe, and follows Starguard's lead and also hands over his untouched ale.

"Of ... course ... not. We can make ... the scarred ... boy the ... weapons master ... and I ... can go back to ... leading raids ..." Big Joe eyes the small cupful of translucent liquid longingly.

Big Joe leans over, grasping the small cup before Starguard can take it. With one grunt, he swallows the entire contents. Moments later he keels over, unconscious.

Yuri says, "Scheist."

Andreth stares. "I guess that was too much for him."

Yuri says, "He's not going to die, is he?"

Starguard sighs. "Unless it's a ruse."

Andreth lifts Big Joe's head carefully. "You okay in there, mister?"

Tilara mutters, "Ach, scheiss... He doesn't look good, does he?"

Yuri says, "Maybe if we carry him back to the Goat?"

Andreth says, "How'd we know to take 'im there?"

Yuri shrugs. "It's where all the other meat goes to hang."

Starguard says, "God dammit! Alcohol plus internal injuries. >.< He lays hands on Joe. "Heal this drunk lout please, I beg the Stars above. Heal Light!""

Andreth smacks his forehead. "Oh, right. We was headed there anyway."

Tilara says, "Yes, we know that. But why would we know it without him telling us, eh?"

Andreth hmms quietly, and shrugs.

Yuri says, "It's no big secret. Everyone else in the Middens knows that something is up."

Yuri says, "And they know it's up at the Goat."

Big Joe begins to sit up, as the color comes back to his ruddy cheeks. He rubs his ribs carefully, listening intently.

Yuri shuts up when he comes too.

Starguard says, "A little healing potion in the drink. Feel better?"

Tilara adds, for Joe's benefit, "Yah, but is his group the one there, or not? Wouldn't do it at all to take him to the wrong place."

Big Joe nods. "Much better. I can breathe much easier now."

Yuri says, "I'm just here to keep your clients honest, Lady. That's what they tells me."

Starguard frowns. "Quiet. He's feeling better."

Big Joe looks at Tilara, slowly and carefully. "So ... sugar pot ... will you be mine? You'll get your own room, and access to baths ... and all the bumble bees you like ..."

Starguard's expression deepens into a scowl. "We're a team, pal. You don't just get her for your money."

Big Joe shrugs. "And the boy can be our weaponsmaster; he moves well. And you, old man, we do need a cook."

Starguard growls. "Cook?"

Yuri keeps quiet.

Tilara giggles. "You're tempting me, you are... bumblebees, indeed. Let's see how it goes, first. The boys here have been taking care of me for a long time, and I don't want them insulted."

Yuri murmurs to Starguard, "There's worse jobs."

Big Joe nods. "We can head out tomorrow; I'll send a runner tonight."

Yuri says, "We're new in town. Where we gonna wait?"

Big Joe smiles. "Come, we've got spare bunk beds. I can put you up tonight."

Yuri nods. "Up to you, Lady."

Tilara thinks about it. "Well... okay. But I'm sleeping with _my_ boys tonight. You still need to recover."

Big Joe nods, standing up. He throws a copper at the bartender, and then stands by the door. "Come, follow me. We'll stay at the Goat tonight, I'll send the last trainee off to warn the leader, and we can follow him comfortably tomorrow."

Starguard smiles. "Sounds good enough to me."

Andreth nods, and stands up along with Big Joe.

Leading the party to the Goat, he opens up the main doors on the street wide. "Step right in! Bunk beds are on the second floor." You see a large warehouse, with a loft forming the second floor. On the main floor are several large barrels, carefully arranged, standing in a corner, while crates are spread out in the middle of the room. A staircase leads to the upper floor, right behind a large pile of splintered wood.

There is only one other person in the warehouse, and he is soon sent on his way by Big Joe.

Starguard says, "Where is everyone? I thought this was a big organization."

Yuri looks around for anything that might be hidden.

Big Joe smiles. "Oh, we are. And growing every day. But this here is just the local warehouse."
