Game Log: Chapter 25 - Road Stories


---------------------------------------

The bandits sit resting in the cart, having enjoyed a wonderful breakfast, and after commmunication has been established with Stormy and the rest of the party. Stormy eyes Tormel's chest, containing that wonderful atlas, longingly, but finally shrugs.

Ash asides to Yuri, in a free moment. "Keep that scum away from me, unless you really need me around. I won't talk to \`em, I won't get near \`em."

Yuri says softly, "I'll do what I can, but I'm surprised. I don't think they're a threat to us now."

Tilara continues to watch the Andvari, still unsure how they will eventually react to losing one of their group in the initial attack. She absently pets her familiar while she does so.

Ash explains. "They're crazies. Berzerkers. Heard all about \`em from my dad. Can't be trusted. That sort.. they'll snap in a moment."

Yuri says, "You think they're going to take it personally that we killed one of them?"

Ash shrugs a little. "I dunno. The stories I heard when I was young, though... hordes of strange people, more like animals, that'd attack travelers for no reason other than bloodshed."

Starguard says, "Alright, folks. Time to get going. The Capitol isn't getting any closer with us standing here. Warm beds in Glencorgan tonight!"

Yuri says, "Well, they're just as likely to leave us at Glencorgan. They want to move faster than we can. We'll see what happens then."

Stormy turns to look at Ash. "You sure those weren't the Stormwinds?"

Ash shrugs. "They're all crazies. What does it matter where they come from?"

Tilara nods, coming over behind Stormy. "Aye. Doesn't sound like the Andvari, really. If nothing else, there aren't that many of them."

The camp is quickly broken, the merchants still eyeing the three bandits - now no loner captives - thoughtfully. Masci moves closer to Yuri, to seek his attention, but then pauses, shrugs, and resumes harnessing his horses. But he's moved a filled scabbard from under the seat to beside him. Engeran and Gerard quickly follow suit, while Ymbert is as oblivious as he always is.

_Glencorgan, from the top of a small hill, lies quietly soaking up the sunshine. There are no obvious walls, although nearer the center the buildings rise taller and look more fortified. Still, there's enough traffic on the streets, and even the roads._

Some of the farmers are staring intently at Karlsefnir and his friends, as they walk alongside the cart. Karlsefnir glowers back, before trading speaking looks and grunts with Arnlaug and Thord.

Ash steps high, a smile on his face, reflecting his satisfaction at being back in his element - whatever that might be.

Starguard says, "Erm, Stormy? Could you ask them not to fight if they can avoid it? We want them to get to the Capitol to tell their story. And this crowd looks...less than friendly."

Tilara says, "I think we should have given them cloaks before we got this far..." She moves to a position between the Anvardi and the locals and breaks out her juggling kit.

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "I hope they don't force us to make our point."

Tilara nods. "Well, let's see how distracting I can be..." She starts into a short version of her act.

The farmers, seeing Tilara, stop to watch her. More travelers gather, until eventually the caravan becomes almost a procession. One in which the Andvarri have tactfully stepped to the side, with Stormy in town. Stormy leans over: "Ingen slassing, behager? Vi vil at De nar Citadel sikkert." Karlsefnir nods, once, moving his hand away from his axe. "Vi blir enig, ingen slassing."

As the caravan progresses apace, so does Tilara's audience grow, until they reach the outskirts of Glencorgan, where the houses begin to crowd the street. There are no walls or guards, though, to impede progress here. The crowd stops, letting Tilara segue into the final portion of her act while Stormy, grinning, whips off his cap and goes round the crowd, collecting money.

Yuri looks around for a likely place to stop the caravan, or a town guard, or the like.

Ash nods approvingly and grins. "You get them every time, milady."

Tilara smiles and waves to the crowd, bowing after she finishes her routine. "Thank you, thank you!"

Starguard sticks close with Andvarri, watching the crowd, making sure it focuses on Tilara. He nods to Yuri, tilting his head towards the inn.

Tilara nods to Ash. "It's always a good idea to have a distraction on call..."

Yuri murmurs to Ash, "Keep an eye on things for a moment. I'm going to try and arrange lodging."

Yuri slips into the inn.

Ash loiters about, suppressing his carefree demeanor and adopting that stern and expressionless mask so commonly needed among his type.

The inn, a non-descript building identifiable only by a small shingle containing what looks like a carrot and two grapes, is currently near empty, as its customers have joined the masses outside. The innkeeper, standing in the doorway, greets Yuri civilly enough.

Masci watches, bemused, hand now on scabbard. "Say, Ash! What madness is this? Shouldn't we get to the caravanserai, the better to keep our horses?"

Ash gives a momentary shrug, still keeping his face impassive. "It's his money, let him find lodging where he can. He'll realize in a few.. there he goes."

After a brief conversation, amidst gesturing on the side of the innkeeper, Yuri steps aside. The customers are returning to the inn, and Yuri has a much better idea as to where to go ...

Yuri returns to the party. "He told me where the caravan grounds are, although if anyone wants to come back here to spend some time in more pleasant surroundings, I don't think he'll argue."

Taking the lead, Yuri looks about him as he follows the road towards the town centre. As the innkeeper pointed out, all roads lead to the caravanserai. Except of course the ones that lead to citadel, and the one leading to the cisterns, and the one leading to ... anyways. Other people on the road courteously move aside to let the caravan pass, a few following in your wake. Not many, though. 'Tis obvious they're used to bigger caravans than five measly carts.

_The caravanserai, a large walled field with stables along the one side, is accessible through but a single gate guarded by the Caravan master himself. The gate stands open, and allows you clear view of the well, and the cooking circles, and the sleeping platforms beyond._

Tilara says, "Not too bad. Quiet, this time of year."

Yuri says, "It will be easier this way. We'll only have to watch ourselves and not the other caravans."

The caravan master, spotting Yuri, spits absently, then counts the carts and horses. And humans. He snorts. "Right; two copper a horse including hay, silver a cart. And a copper for each of youse. That'll fetch ye water and firewood; ye'll fix yer own food, I'm thinkin'."

Yuri nods, and hands over a gold piece to the serai. "Sounds reasonable. Are we the only ones here?"

The caravan master nods. "Aye; you'll have it all to yourselves tonight. How long will ye be stayin'?"

Yuri looks at the nearest of the merchants, probably Masci. "Think you'll want to do any trading while you're here, or do you want to move fast?"

Masci shakes his head. "We're bound straight for Citadel."

Yuri turns back to the serai. "Looks like it's just tonight, then."

The carts are led into the caravanserai proper, where the horses are unharnessed. Karlsefnir leads his men to the sleeping platform, and soon they're curled up underneath, asleep. The merchants, watching the carts, turn to Ash and Yuri. "We'll be visiting friends this afternoon; we trust you'll watch the carts?"

Ash nods.

Yuri nods to the merchants. "Yes. We'll rotate ourselves through watches, just like on the road. And it looks like our new friends aren't going to be causing much trouble, either."

Stormy, holding a bulging cap, pulls Tilara aside. "You were very popular, m'Lady." He carefully counts the change into her hand. "Twentyfive coppers, and thirteen silvers too. And four pins!"

Tilara chuckles. "Pins, eh? Well, put them in my sewing kit. You never know when you might need them."

Masci nods, once, at Yuri, before leading his friends out the main gate. Soon they're lost from sight. Only Ymbert remains, sitting morosely in his cart. And Tormel, of course, who is carefully writing in his journal.

Stormy nods, carefully handing the pins over. "Sometimes the poor folks ... they don't have copper, but they have pins. Ten pins to a copper ..."

Tilara nods. "I know. I was that poor for a while myself."

Starguard slips over to talk with Ymbert as he sees to camp, the fire, and the like, talking about nothing in particular, just trying to get a sense of the man.

Stormy looks impressed. "I didn't know."

Tilara nods. "Aye. Had to leave my family when I was just 15. I was lucky... didn't find anyone like Ferg to take me in. Had to make my own way, and it was rough for a while. But I got better at juggling, and developed my magic, and now... here I am."

Yuri hmms. _Ymbert must have drawn the short straw, and gets to watch us to make sure we don't leave the roost unguarded. Still, it's a good sign that they only leave one to be our watchdog._

Stormy watches, spellbound.

Ymbert, a man of few words, mostly grunts answers. Well, taken a certain way, they could be understood to be answers. He's quiet, and not prone to sharing confidences. It's hard, in fact, to imagine him as a seller of perfumes.

Yuri taps Stormy on the shoulder. "Hey, Stormy, got a moment? I wanted to thank you for translating with the Andvari for us. You may well have saved someone's life; if we hadn't been able to talk to them, who knows what would have happened."

Stormy turns around, beaming. "I'm glad I could help; honestly, it was nothing."

Starguard pipes in as he begins to clatter pots and bring out his chopping board. "It was more than nothing. You fought fairly well, too. Not the best judgement yet, but there's still time for that."

Stormy basks in all the praise ... and then wanders off to bug Tormel about his daily lessons.

Tilara chuckles to Yuri as she watches the boy walk away. "He's a good lad, he is. How about a quick bout? I'm feeling in need of a bit of exercise."

The afternoon passes slowly and lazily; the caravan master's men guard the gate so that nobody is disturbed by the urchins. The sun, overhead, bakes the field as gently as Starguard bakes his supper creations, and the others relax. And it's not until well into the evening that Masci, leaning on the shoulders of his two best friends, comes stumbling back into the compound. "It's a bonny night, friends, and foes, and all alike! we've _hic_ brought you some _hic_ friendmakers to _hic_ drink together!"

Yuri nods to Tilara. "OK... we don't have any wooden weapons, perhaps we can use some of the larger sticks from the firewood." Then he murmurs, "And if anyone watches the demonstration at least it will advertise our competence."

Tilara chuckles and readies her quarterstaff, safing it by tieing pads to the ends. "Speak for yourself. Mine is wooden."

Ash chuckles at Masci and friends. "That, gentlemen, is the secret to good caravaning. Solid ground by day, plenty of liquid at night."

Yuri finds a stick about the right size and shape to match his rapier, and squares off against Tilara. "Well, I guess we can write them out of any guard rotations tonight. En garde, m'dear!"

Masci waves a pungent flask at Ash. "Have a ... a ... a whatchamacallit? A ... take a slug! Ish good."

Ash waves his hand a little, half-dismissively. "That mead'll do fine. I don't feel like getting.. inebriated tonight, thanks."

Tilara sighs. _Get them away from supervision, and look what happens..._

Gerard fehs, falling forward to lean on Ash, and swinging his own bottle around. "No _hic_ Marshter to frown at ush tonight! No dish ... dish ... glaring and no spee ... speeshus. Have a ... Have a ship!" He offers the bottle up, and the fumes hit Ash full in the faint, making him feel slightly tipsy from that alone.

Ymbert, leaning up against his cart, looks disgusted. Pointedly turning his back on the whole sorry spectacle, he checks his horses one last time before retiring for the night. Tormel, too, looks a little disgusted.

Ash shakes his head a little. "I... hmm, I've been.... wow." Once again the vigorous head-shake, attempting to rattle everything back into place. "I've just been thinking that I shouldn't umm, lose control so much. Drink more sparingly, you know.. Just seems classier to sip wine than to chug beer."

Gerard hahs! "We don't _hic_ ever get allowed to be classhy when our ... our ... whatchamacallitsh? When they watsch and frownsh and ..." He collapses to the ground, and hugs Ash's leg for a while, perfectly content where he is.

Tilara says, "Besides, we're still on duty, even if they aren't. They'll learn in the morning, I think." Mirra pointedly wanders away, eventually ending up on the wall of the caravanserai.

Yuri continues sparring with Andreth. "Quite so, Ash. We're responsible for their safety. We'll have a lot more time to do ourselves harm in Citadel."

Starguard chuckles, and offers food to the boys, shaking his head. Lads will be lads, after all.

Ash patpats Gerard, half-sympathetically, and shrugs at Yuri. "I guess...."

Engeram, spotting the food, falls to ravenously, dragging Masci along. Both now proclaim Bother Sharker as their besht ever friend, before eventually falling asleep half under their carts.

Ash stares down at the drunk at his leg, but remarks conversationally into the air, "try anything, Scarface, and you die on my blade."

Stormy turns at Ash's comment, and then shrugs. His face is mostly clear of blemishes, and Tilara hasn't noticed the one pimple yet and if he can get to Brother Starguard in time, maybe he'll be able to help and ...

Yuri catches Tilara's eye, and flicks his head over towards where the Andvari are sleeping. _They're awake now..._

Tilara nods, and points to where Mirra is patrolling the wall.

Yuri returns from working the rumormill with a young man named Aedrin. He brings him to Tormel. "It seems that someone in town was attacked by a giant hawk, just as there have been giant wolf attacks near Red River town. This is Aedrin and he saw it happen. I'd like you to listen to his story."

Yuri goes to tell the others, and also asks Stormy to tell the Andvarri, in case they want to listen.

The Andvarri shake their heads at Stormy, and quickly indicate they don't speak the language. Stormy nods, and promises to tell them about it afterwards. And so the Andvarri resume watching.

Aedrin, suddenly sobering up a little, looks around the field. His eyes rest, for a moment, on the Andvarri underneath the platform, and then again on the sleeping merchants. Finally he turns to Tormel. "A giant hawk, it was. Stooped down and grabbed our little Kedruin, right off the ground." His hands spread wide. "We've never seen a wingspan like this, sirrah, never! If it wasn't for a rock thrown by his friend, Kedruin woulda died, we're sure, like any lambkin. Aye, and broke his arm in the fall too."

Tilara says, "When did this happen?"

Yuri says, "It is fortunate that he survived. Was there anything unusual about the way the hawk looked, besides being really big?"

Aedrin shudders theatrically. "Aye, three, nae four, weeks back now. And still the arm is sore for the bones splintered and wouldnae set well. And the hawk ... why, it looked evil, I tells ya. Pure evil. 'Is eyes glinted all red. Nae lord has ever flown a hawk tha' big."

Yuri says, "Tormel, how does this compare to the wolf attacks? Hawks aren't generally given to attacking random people on the street."

Tormel, writing furiously quickly, bites his lips. "I ... I don't know. It's certainly not normal behaviour for hawks; most hunt far smaller creatures than this. Although if the hawk was larger the prey could be too. Aedrin; how old is Kedruin?"

Aedrin counts on his fingers. "Seven, and a strappin' lad already."

Tilara says, "That is most certainly not normal prey for a hawk. Or even an eagle."

Aedrin shrugs. "We've seen no more hawks, since, though the lord hisself gave permission to shoot the birds out of hand. He's keepin' his huntin' birds hooded and locked up, for now."

Yuri says, "And the hawk - how wide would you say the wings were? Wider than a man is tall? Two men?"

Starguard shakes his head. "Interesting times we live in."

Ash mutters darkly, "Bad omens. We're being surrounded by \`em."

Tilara says, "Starguard... d'you think you could help the boy?"

Aedrin pauses. "Aye, I'd make it about two men, m'self. We still argue bout that, sometimes ..."

Yuri nods. "In order to try to carry off a boy, it would have to have been that big."

Yuri says, "You mentioned that his arm isn't healing right - is it because of the break, or something else?"

Aedrin shakes his head. "The priests have looked at him, and say the scarrin'll be permanent. It's the break itself, see; it's where the hawk grabbed him, and fair pulverized the bone."

Starguard says, "I'll take a look at it. I'm a fair healer, maybe I can recommend something. But for that kind of injury," Starguard shrugs. "Not much to be done."

Aedrin nods, eagerly. "He'll no say nae tae that; we're not rich. I'll bring him in the morning."

Yuri says, "Was there anything about the hawk that seemed to be oddly shaped? Like the claws or the head?"

Aedrin looks troubled. "I ... I don't know. It all happened so fast, we only noticed the size."

Yuri looks to Starguard and Tormel. "Could either of you tell anything about the kind of claws that made a scar, if you saw the scar?"

Tormel nods. "I could try."

Yuri says, "OK. Aedrin, thanks for your time; I think it would be worth some of Brother Starguard's time to look at that injury, if we stand a chance of figuring out where it came from."

Yuri says, "So if you'd like to bring the boy by, I'm sure Starguard will see what he can do."

Starguard nods. "Never hurts to look at something."

Aedrin nods again, eagerly. "We'll be here, sir, at first dawn. I should go tell his parents the good news."

Tilara waits until Aedrin has left. "First wolves, now hawks. Strange things are happening. Stormy, can you tell our friends about this, and see what they have to say?"

Yuri says, "I'll go with you, Stormy. My A-isian is different from yours, so I think I'd like some practice. Or at least to hear the differences."

Stormy steps aside, to confer with the Andvarri, Yuri following behind him. They mutter together, with much waving of hands. Finally, Stormy rejoins the main group, looking very troubled. "They ... they weren't surprised by the giant hawk. And they're more keen on talking to Zamua than before, but they also want to stay with the caravan. They say it's safer."

Yuri says, "It's hard to tell what 'Zamua' might mean, if it's a name or a title. It might well be both. I suspect it's a label for a role that a person plays, but also possibly a name, like we call Starguard 'Brother'. For example, if it means 'Princess' or something similar then perhaps it refers to Potapka, but it could as easily mean 'Spymaster' and refer to Berina."

Starguard's eyebrows raise. "Berina?"

Yuri says, "I'm just making an example. I hope that's not the lady they're looking for. This mission is strange enough already."

Yuri says, "In any case... Ash, I know it's not your preference, but will you tolerate them as far as Citadel? They know who - " Yuri stops short, to avoid saying anything the Andvari might object to - "They know something about who we're looking for, and if we can keep them around long enough to fill in the missing pieces, we may be able to get out of our obligation earlier."

Ash says, "If you travel with them, I either tolerate them - or I leave. It's simple as that."

Yuri says, "Yes, well, I'd rather have you with me than them, so I'm asking you if you think you'll do it."

Ash shrugs helplessly. "You trusted me, and I was just a thug. I'll.... I'll trust them."

Yuri nods. "Thank you. I'll remember that trust."

That evening the snores of the young drunks perpetuate the snapping of the fire - the wood is a trifle green. Come the morning the horses, having eaten their fill, are hitched back up to the carts and the caravan continues. Most of the hitching has been done by the guards, and Harry suggests to Yuri that he and his do the driving today. Masci and his friends look decidedly the worse for wear. And very green. And they've already hung out in the outhouse for a while. They're not very keen on breakfast either. Just pints and pints of water.

Aedrin is waiting, just outside the walls, with his young nephew Kedruin. The boy eyes the emerging caravan cautiously, his hand holding his other arm where it hangs loosely by its side.

When he spots Starguard, Aedrin steps forward. "Sir? I've brought the boy."

Yuri nods to Harry. "Yes, I think they'll thank you to take the reigns. Farbeit from me to tell someone that they should have listened to their masters; I'm sure that learning that indulgence has its cost, is a lesson that can only be learned from experience."

Starguard quickly notices, and drops down to move over to the young lad. "Hello there. You'd be Kedruin, wouldn't you?" Starguard kneels down to be on the same level as the lad. "I'm Starguard. Mind if I have a look at that arm?"

Yuri goes to roust Tormel; this is the part we're paying him for.

Kedruin nods, dumbfounded, and moves his hand off the arm. Tormel, grumbling at the rousting, leans over behind Starguard to take a close look. The arm looks as though someone had tightened a ring around the upper arm, crushing bones, arteries, and all the rest. When asked, the boy can barely make a fist.

Yuri winces, and walks away slowly. _I've led a shelterd life. Even after the past few months... such violence to youth just makes no sense to me._

Starguard smiles. "Hmm. Well, is that your throwing arm, or your catching one?" he asks, looking over the elbow. He nods, finger gently touching the damaged. Squeezed bad, and it's old...

Tormel shakes his head. "That must have been a truly large hawk. I wonder if he wanted the child for food, or for other ... reasons."

Tilara stays back, but can't resist taking a look at the injury. She inhales sharply at the extent of the damage. _I hope he can do something. Poor kid..._

The boy giggles. "It's my shield arm. I'm gunna be a soldier when I grows up."

Starguard hmms. "That's good then. You'll never be all that good at the shield rush, but you should be able to defend yourself. A soldier's not much of a life, though. I was up on the lines for twenty years, so I should know. Hold still a moment, please..."

Aedrin watches quietly, then takes Yuri aside. He presses the three coppers back into Yuri's hand. "We can't take this; we'd give more, but ... we spent all we had on the priests, and they just told us to apprentice him to the seamstresses. Fat lot of good they did."

Starguard places his hands around the lad's upper arm loosely, and begins to murmur a prayer to the stars, his eyes closing for a moment while his hands glow blue...

Yuri waves it back at Aedrin. "Keep them. You need it more than we do."

The kid holds still, eyes wide open. "You wuz? I will? I allus wanted to be a soldier, like Unca and Dad. Oooooo, that feels funny, that does. Unca, unca, look, he made me all glow!"

Tilara holds her breath. _I hope this works..._

Aedrin nods. "Thank you. We will not forget."

Slowly the arm begins to fill out, looking less unnatural, less compressed. The hand is still a pale pale white but after a moments it looks a little more lifelike. Kedruin pulls his arm up with his other hand, marveling. "Ooooh, that feels all fizzy, that does!"

Starguard smiles, and takes the lad's hand in his. "There, grasp my hand. That's a good lad." He smiles, the grip a bit stronger. "Feel a little more there?" The arm seems...a little less crushed, but the signs of scarring are still there, just faded a little. "Hmm. Better. I'll be honest with you lad. It'll never be as good as your other arm, but it should do well enough, **if** you exercise it. I want you to find something like a big jar at home, and fill it with as much water as you can handle, and trying curling it, holding it, making your arm work until you get tired. Every day, before chores."

Kedruin nods, almost dancing. "Gotta go show mum! Thank you thank you gotta go show mum!" He darts off, Aedrin trailing behind him.

Starguard holds Aedrin back for a moment. "Don't you let him forget it. Exercise that arm every morn, or it'll waste away. He's got to strength it." With that, he gets back to the wagons

Tilara calls after the departing farmer. "Aedrin! A moment, if you would..." She hurries over to him.

Aedrin stops, one eye still on the charging Kedruin. "Yes?"

Tilara says, "You mentioned the priests who took your money and did nothing... did they even try a spell?"

Aedrin shakes his head. "They fed him foul brews, but said spells would not help. Not the few spells we could afford."

Tilara snorts. "As if they pay for them. Lazy creatures. Who do they worship, then?"

Aedrin holds up his hands. "Mostly Lurithain, and they're as bull-ish as he is, ma'am, if you'll not mind me sayin' so."

Tilara chuckles. "I'll not mind it a bit, nor will I tell them you said so. I was curious... thank you." She hands him another pair of coppers. "You've been helpful, and as Yuri said, you need this more than we do. Take care of the boy."

Aedrin stammers his thanks. "We ... we will **not** forget, m'lady. I must make sure the boy reaches home safely."

Tilara nods. "Be well, then." She turns and hurries after the caravan, catching up in a few minutes and settling back down to a walk.

After that interlude, the caravan resumes its slow progress out of town. Once back on the open road the horses begin to pull more strongly. Karlsefnir, Thord, and Arnlaug walk alongside the White Hat wagon, watching the surroundings carefully. The road is no busier or emptier than expected. After three days of steady travel, the party is within a half day or so of Perfirin, which sits at the split of the roads.

Ash will spend the intervening days talking to Tormel, learning whatever can be taught of nature - hawks and wolves, and what other sorts of animals prowl the wild. What to look for, what to expect, and what might arouse suspicion.

Tormel, having settled into his role as teacher, is perfectly happy lecturing every morning on whatever topics people ask about. In the afternoon he rides on the cart, working on his own notes.

Starguard settles down with a extra pot on the fire, setting herbs bubbling gently as he adds to it. Cooking, potion-making...it's all in the spicing.

Ash stands well away, on general principle. "Best of luck, Brother.."

Tormel watches too, mumbling something under his breath about overeager students.

Starguard nods. "Luck should have nothing to do with it..." He stirs the soup, eyes on his potion. Supper might be a bit subpar tonight...

Supper is served, and is edible as Starguard occupies himself with his work. Carefully he adds ingrediants, timing with the sun and an egg timer, a little nervous...

The Andvarri take their cue from Ash, watching from a distance. And Harry takes advantage of the lull to tour the perimeter and secure camp.

Stormy smells appreciatively. "Supper smells wonderful, Starguard. And the brew looks ... interesting."

Starguard grins, adding a bit of citrus zest to it. "Hopefully it will be enough to stop bleeding, and save someone's life." He pauses, then grins. "Possibly my own."

Stormy nods. "I ... see. It's a wonderful idea, for when m'Lady gets hurt again."

Starguard nods. "That's the idea. I need it to turn out, first."

Slowly the potion reduces until at last Starguard is left holding a small pill. Still moist, it will dry overnight and become much like the ones his nephew produced in Woolwich.

In the morning, while Starguard marvels over his first success, the horses are hitched up and the wagons get back on the road. What with all the delays, the party doesn't reach Perfirin until late in the afternoon.

_Perfirin is a walled town, with guards at the three major gates, and all the minor gates too. In the center of town, two towers rise high up into the sky. At six, the famed carillon rings out, as it does at noon and at dawn, calling the citizens to wake, to break their fast, and to say their prayers._

Reaching the main gates, the guards inspect the caravan carefully, and then deliver a fairly standard warning about the penalties for brawling in the streets. It must be standard, there's absolutely no inflection in their voices as they rattle off the rules. After which they give directions to the caravanserai.

The caravanserai, nestled up against the outer wall, consists of a somewhat smaller field this time. The walls, however, are high, with the added benefit that the city guards will keep an eye on the caravans, too. The caravan master, before opening the gate, collects his fee, and then assigns you a small corner, out of the way of the main crowd.

The field is filled with wagons, many of them gaily decorated, and with young folk of many stripes. There are jongleurs, and minstrels, and dancing prancing ponies, as well as more sober merchants. And a full cadre of guards.

Ash makes his way about, once settled in, and as per usual does a bit of socializing and gossiping with the guards.

Yuri organizes a rotation of the guards (including himself and the four lads from Red River Town). He'll take the first block himself, and then the second for working the rumor mill.

Ash soon runs into some old acquaintances, who invite him over to their fire to catch up.

Tilara grins and makes sure that she's on a later guard shift, then takes Stormy along and heads off toward the other entertainers.

Ash will gratefully accept, going into a guardedly patchy version of his recent experiences, and listening in turn to whatever interests the others enough to relate.

Stormy, towed along, looks everywhere at once. These minstrels and jongleurs, and dancers ... they're all so cheerful. And they greet Tilara expansively, though none of them recognize her.

One of the guards, introducing himself as Theo, begins to tell a long and involved tale about a wolf. This wolf followed their caravan for weeks, before finally slinking off. And then another, Kerron, told a taller tale about the wolf who came, one night, and talked with the guard captain. And a third, snorting, tells the tale of a hawk, who flew overhead for a full day.

Starguard waves everyone off, and sets up camp. The kids need their release.

Masci, looking at his mates, decides to stick close to camp. That way they can sit on their wagons and ogle the wimmin. And get fewer hangover, besides.

Ash will answer, with his own tale of wolves and the third-hand account of the bird as well, though he's cautious about the exact results of the former battle. "Also," he remarks conversationally, "whereabouts exactly were you when these things happened?" The idea of mapping out the various animal encounters has just started to occur to him.

Tilara smiles and waves back to the other entertainers, looking around for anyone doing juggling, anyone she recognizes, or anyone playing a fiddle or viola. _Still can't believe the boy bought that..._

Theo grins. "We were up near Agla's Falls; we had ship duty at first, but the wolf followed us from Agla's Harbour, right down the river. Jest followin' down the river shore. And it must have swum across at least once, when we saw him on the other shore." Kerron nods. "We saw the wolf up by Agla's Falls."

Ash nods and notes these facts down. "And how long ago..?"

At the far end of the campground, music is struck up, a few fiddlers scraping their bows as others begin to dance.

Theo hmmmms. "Wolf left us about six weeks ago. Never came back on the way up, either." Kerron nods. "We saw ours 'bout seven weeks ago."

Tilara turns at the sound of the music. "Ah-hah. Go get your instrument, Stormy... these folks can teach you something about how to play it." She waits for the boy to return, then wanders down that way with him, practicing a bit of her own trade as she does.

Yuri sits down heavily near Starguard. "At least we'll have a cheerful camp tonight. Everything has been so serious lately. It's going to make an old man of me."

Starguard chuckles. "Don't let it, Yuri. I'm the old man around here."

Ash will continue chatting in a more light-hearted vein, but in the back of his mind, questions are struggling to form. He'll make a resolution to approach the city guards about a question, either tonight or in the morning..

Nearer the music, the crowds thicken. Soon someone else is juggling, and tossing the occasional ball at Tilara in invitation. Stormy, carrying his instrument along, was dragged into the shadows for a quick lesson or two. And the first lesson they taught him involved muting the viola, so that he could practice quietly.

Tilara grins and joins in the joint effort, tossing balls back and forth with other performers. She keeps an eye on her protege, but doesn't object when they show him how to mute the instrument...

Theo, too, relaxes into chatting, as the circle of guards exchanges stories, and tall tales, and basic newss about the roads. Kerron, frowning at Theo's tale, is a little quieter.

Ash nudges goodnaturedly at the dour bravo. "What ails you, Kerron?"

Kerron shrugs. "These wolves, they bother me. There's too many tales. And that captain, over at the keep, as insisted on changing his fortress's name. I just don't like it."

Andreth nods grimly. "Deadly dangerous times. Something's gone amiss in the world."

Ash grows likewise grim. "Neither do I," he confesses in a tone counter to his earlier raconteur's demeanor. "Frankly, I think there's some hand behind these seeming beasts, and I intend to find whatever I can - well, once my own \`quest' is over with," he mumbles, jerking a thumb backwards to the caravan.

Kerron nods at Andreth. "Exactly. I don't mind risking my life fighting men; it's what we're paid to do. But we're not paid for these wolves. And they're not natural."

Theo looks up, grinning. "A quest? I smell a tale, good friend. Tell! Tell!"

Ash laughs. "Ha! I'm just a wagon-guard, like yourselves. Maybe I've been charged by the gods to stick to these people, though, hmm?"

The instrument, muted as it is, still sounds atrocious. So atrocious, in fact, that noone there can make it sound good. It's almost as though it were cursed.

Tilara doesn't expect Stormy to be good at the instrument, but when no one else can play it, her curiousity is piqued. "What the heck is wrong with the thing?"

One of the musicians, holding it up, just grimaces. "The sound box is warped, the neck is warped, the bridge is warped, and none of the warps harmonize. Feh, lad, you've been robbed." Stormy, hearing this, looks heartbroken.

Tilara sighs. "Never mind, Stormy. Live and learn. Next time, you buy an instrument from someone who can prove that it sounds good."

Stormy nods, sadly. "But it was all the money I had."

Theo looks curiously at Ash. "Charged by the gods? You're a believer, then?"

Ash intones ominously, "Seeing is believing." And he'll say no more on the matter.

Tilara grins. "Lesson two. Spending what you have isn't always the best bet. Sometimes you want to save what you've got until you can afford something good."

Andreth nods in agreement with Ash, but otherwise is just as taciturn.

Stormy nods, crestfallen. "I will."

A third guard, watching the interplay, shrugs and breaks into a bawdy song about a druid's staff ...

Tilara says, "That's all right, then. You got off fairly cheaply for that lesson, I'd say." She turns back to the other musicians. "Can you give the lad a tryout, see if it's worth buying a good instrument for him?"

Andreth seems eager for the lightening of the tone, and hums along, even though he doesn't know the words.

One of the men in the crowd nods. The same man who had condemned Stormy's instrument, in fact. He hands Stormy a violin, and shows him how to hold the bow. Stormy takes up the instrument, and manages to coax a simple tune from it. "The lad has talent, Tilara. He should have an instrument."

Tilara says, "Very well, then. He sings, too. Would you recommend a fiddle, or maybe something he can accompany himself with?"

"Well, you can sing with a fiddle, once you get used to the motion. And it's easier to keep the toes tapping than with a lute or a mandolin. Easier on the fingers." The man shrugs. "But each of those will take as much work as the other."
