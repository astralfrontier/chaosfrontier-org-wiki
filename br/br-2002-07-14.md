Game Log: Chapter 31 - the Master of the Foramen


----------------------------------------------------

\-- (OOC) Log "Birthright-11-August-2002" started by GM at 03:16:45 PM Sun Aug 11, 2002 (OOC) -->

After a relaxing night at the Olde Knight and the Older Dragon, the party gathers in the common room for breakfast. Tormel looks happy to see them, and Harry briefly updates Yuri and Ash on the merchant's plans. To wit, to hold a small fair tomorrow.

Masci slides in next to Yuri. "What will be the cost if we add a wagon or two to the caravan? We've had some requests. And thus far you've done a masterful job."

Yuri says, "I'd have to consult the other members of the Company; more carts might mean more guards, we'd have to see if we can find them first."

Yuri says, "Also, we're still unsure about the road ahead. We caught a couple of brigands this morning but I don't know if they were the ones we're after."

Masci nods. "Very well. I have promised them a decision this afternoon, after the faire. Will that suit?"

Yuri says, "I think we can know by then, yes."

Tilara says, "They didn't seem to be particularly ordinary brgiands, but I don't think we managed to get all of them."

Engeram looks up. "Brigands, eh? What was so odd about the thieving bastards?"

Yuri says, "They looked pretty feral. Almost bestial."

Shuddering, Engeram nods. "Well, we'll just stay in Thorpenhow until you've cleared the roads then, shall we?"

Meanwhile, Tormel listens intently, taking notes. He nudges Stormy, asking about appearances, and the two are soon deep in conversation.

Yuri says, "I don't think that we can completely clear them, but perhaps we can give the local bandits a hint that this would be a good week to stay home and leave us alone."

Tilara says, "That'd be my recommendation, yes. The locals told us about a couple places that are the centers for some weird goings-on, and I think we ought to check them before taking the wagons through."

Engeram chews on his lip. "The decision, of course, is yours. But a few days stop here won't ruin on, so please don't feel obliged to cut short your investigations on our account."

Yuri nods to Engeram. "Well, we thought we'd be a week and we were only gone two days. So I think we're going to go have another look."

Tilara says, "We only came back because we ended up with those prisoners... shall we go see what the Major has found out?"

Tormel looks up. "May I join you?"

Yuri says, "Of course. Everyone else can catch up on sleep, or whatever."

Starguard nods. "I can come along too. I may be able to help."

At the barracks, the guard immediately recognizes you, and a private is detailed to escort you around. The prisoners, shackled to the wall, look sullenly up when the door is opened. The room is small, and square, and soon crowded. There is no furniture, however, which helps. Merely a little straw, and a bucket in one corner. The private clears his throat. "We just locked them up, and sent the healer in to tend to the worst of their wounds."

Tilara says, "Has anyone been able to talk to them?"

Yuri says, "Anybody figure out who they are? They don't exactly look like taxpaying subjects of the Emperor."

The prisoners look up, glowering. Their wounds have been field dressed, though they have not been cleaned up in any other way. The private shakes his head. "We think ... they understand. But they won't speak. Sarge suggests they're beastmen, from the forests."

The private steps to the side, and holds the door open. "You could try to question them. The Major said you were to have full access."

Yuri nods to the Private. "We will. If we can get them to open up, this may got a lot easier for all of us."

Ash says, "Have they been fed?"

The private shakes his head. "No; healer says they're on broth for a few days yet, and the cook hates making broth."

One of the prisoners rattles his chains at the mention of food.

Yuri murmurs to Tormel, "You got any ideas?"

Tilara blinks. "So... they do understand. I'd suggest that we get the healer to discuss this with the cook."

Ash's eyes turn sideways for a moment, glancing into the enclosure. "I say we start feeding them after they start proving they can communicate. No sense wasting good food on someone you can't question."

Tilara follows that glance, and grins. "True... no use riling the cook if they're not going to be useful."

Yuri narrows his eyes at the foramen. "You talk. Then food."

Yuri nudges Ash and Tilara, and motions at the Prisoners. _Watch them, they're listening to us._

The prisoner looks up, then speaks in a guttural trade dialect. "Talk. Food." Tormel, flipping through his journal, shakes his head. "Nothing useful, Yuri."

The private grins. "That'll do it. I'll stay out here, with the keys. They're shackled, so as long as you watch yourselves ..." Starguard nods. "Before they start talking, though, should we ensure they speak only truth?"

Yuri scratches his head. "What do you mean, Starguard?"

Tilara says, "A very good idea, Starguard." She looks to Yuri. "A spell."

"It's a simple spell; it forces all those who step within its reach to tell the truth." Starguard looks in the room, consideringly. "Although it may catch you, as well. And it doesn't always work."

Yuri shrugs. "I always tell the truth anyway. True masters of deception never need to lie."

Starguard nods. "It will last only a few minutes." He bows his head, praying to the Stars for vision. The prisoners begin to glow, briefly, the glow settling into the marrow of their being.

Starguard nods. "They'll speak only truth; I believe it worked."

Yuri says, "If we can get them to speak at all... OK, here goes."

Yuri steps into the cell and sits down.

The prisoners look attentively at Yuri.

Yuri points to himself. "I'm Yuri. You talk, you tell me what I want, you eat. Maybe you go free. You help me, I help you. You don't help me..." He shrugs. "You know better than me."

The prisoner grunts. "We talk, we eat. What should we say?"

Yuri says, "We want the people who change. Where are they?"

"Grikugra say, if captured, admit nothing. Hawkman say, admit nothing. We say admit nothing." The other prisoner grunts his assent.

Yuri says, "Is Grikugra your chief?"

"Grikugra mightiest of mighty. Grikugra rule us. Grikugra have good plans. Hah." The prisoner smirks, his lips pulling a little from wounds.

Ash smirks in return. "Grikugra is not here. So where and when were you told not to admit anything?"

"They say, in council, admit nothing. Admit not where war bands gather, where troops train, where plans made. Admit nothing." The prisoner grins. "Now food?"

Ash muses. "Well we know troops are being trained and plans are being made, which is more than we had. So you've already failed."

Yuri says, "Where is the hawkman now? Where do they camp?"

The prisoner shrugs. "Hawkman come, hawkman go. He send instruction. Always the same. Attack caravan here, or attack caravan there, and admit nothing. He not warn us you sneaky."

Yuri says, "Why? Why should you do what he says? What do you gain? Surely Grikurga is mightier than the hawks."

Yuri says, "Why would Grikurga's people take orders from those who are weaker?"

The other prisoner glares at the first one. "You not lie! Tell truth! We not told attack this caravan." He spits on the ground. "Was not even caravan. Was stupid!"

Tilara says, "So why did you attack us?"

The first one glares back, then stares balefully at Yuri. "Not admit take orders. Admit take advice. Grikugra rule Hawkman. Grikugra rule Wolfman. Grikugra rule pack. Grikugra rule all packs. Grikugra mighty; will burn down town if we not freed."

The second one shrugs. "Was two of you. Was three of us. Liked odds. Was bored."

Yuri looks at the other one. "Oh ho. So he - " pointing at the chatty prisoner " - nearly got you killed for nothing?"

Andreth tilts his head. "What's so special about you? They're gonna fight the whole town just for you?"

The prisoner shrugs. "Not dead. Freed soon, or Grikugra kill town."

Ash coughs loudly. "Yuri.."

Yuri says, "Why attack us? Why now? Why does Samaela come for us now?"

Yuri hmms?

Ash makes a beckoning gesture.

Yuri waits a moment to see if they react to Samaela.

"Samaela? Not know Samaela. Grikugra packleader." The prisoner looks confused, then shrugs. "Grikugra save us. We in his pack."

Yuri goes to speak to Ash.

Tilara says, "What does Grikugra look like?"

Ash comes round the corner before speaking, and even then does so in hushed tones. "We ain't the besta' scouts, an they spotted jes' two," he grins, lapsing into his old habitual dialect as his mind works in preference on this new problem. "What's sayin we let them go an' just have em tailed by one of the scouts the Major got to have?"

The prisoner grins. "Grikugra look like us. Only ..." He pauses. "Little smaller, little shorter. But he powerful. He teach us about packs."

Yuri grins at Ash. "Meesa likes how youse think."

Ash scowls. "Don't be makin' funname. I learned how to speak properly."

Yuri goes back to the prisoners. "I ask again. Why? What do we have that you'd kill us for it?"

The prisoners shrug in unison. "Nice crossbows. Grikugra like good weapons, we get promoted."

Yuri nods to Ash, and whispers, "Sorry. It's a brilliant idea. Maybe there's a way we can mark them."

Yuri says, "We want to speak to Grikurga. We want to know who leads the hawks and wolves. You help us, it goes faster. You don't help us, we find Grikurga ourselves." Yuri narrows his eyes. "I'm not afraid of Grikurga. You want to live in the woods, fine. You want to give caravans trouble, fine. That's peace. Even giving trouble to caravans is peace. You make war... you make children die... we find you. We find your leaders. We find your families. We'll kill you and everyone who looks like you. You die, Grikurga dies, the Foramen die. Every story you ever told, forgotten."

Yuri stands up. "You think that over. I don't need your help. You want to help me, we deal. You don't, I spare nobody who does us harm."

The prisoners turn, and begin arguing. Finally, the bigger one wins the argument. "We take small group. No more than single patrol."

Yuri says, "We'll do that. We want to talk to the hawks and wolves. That happens, we have a truce. You lead us into a trap, you die first."

Yuri gets up and looks around at the rest of the company, and murmurs, "Anything we should add, here? I think we got all the important points."

Tilara says, "I think so. Get them some food now?"

The prisoner nods, and spits in his hand, the shackles clanking. Then he holds it out. "We take to Grikugra. He decide Wolfman, Hawkman."

Yuri turns back, and shakes. "Good enough for now. Now you eat. You like beer?"

Both prisoners nod, looking up at the mention of beer. The private sticks his head in. "Should I get the armourer to free these people?

Tilara says, "Not yet... get them some food, though."

Yuri turns to the private. "No. But do get them some beer. I think they're entitled to a goodwill gesture."

The private nods, and moves down the hallway to pass a message on. A few minutes later, he returns. "Cook's making them breakfast now."

The party heads straight for the Lady major's mansion, where they are quickly admitted into her drawing room. As before, the Lady Major is bent over a ledger, writing careful notes, but she stands as the party enters. "Gentlemen, lady. How do you fare?"

Tilara says, "Well, we've got a name..."

Yuri says, "Perhaps not the one we were looking for... but it's a start. The things we have learned do not give me cause to be at ease."

The Lady Major nods. "A name?"

Yuri nods. "Grikurga. We brought back two prisoners - Foramen, we think they're called, and they say that he's their chief."

Tilara says, "They also implied that they're allied with wolf and hawk shapechangers and take orders from a hawk."

The Lady Major looks perplexed. "Foramen? I thought ... I thought those were extinct."

Yuri says, "If there was any doubt before, it seems obvious now that the Changers are preparing a war, in secret. Tribes like these - possibly like the bandit group we broke up near Woolwich - the Changers make deals with them to harrass local travellers."

Tilara sighs. "Unfortunately, they're not."

Yuri says, "I don't think it's fortunate or unfortunate. It just is. Another tribe, inclined to violence."

"Please, won't you have a seat? Let me ring for tea." Lady San puts word to deed, summoning the butler and the tea tray. Then she herself sits down at her desk, and pulls out her journal. She opens it to a fresh page. "Grikurga, you say? What do they want?"

Yuri says, "We've presuaded the two we caught to take a small group of us to meet Grikurga. But I think that there's no easy answer to this problem. Whatever is happening is too big for us to resolve with quickly or locally."

Yuri wastes no time in taking a seat. "Thank you."

Lady San nods, as the butler pours and passes around seed cakes. "Will you go in person? To date, you've made more progress than we have, somewhat to my lieutenant's chagrin."

Tilara says, "I think we should... though I, at least, wouldn't object to backup."

Yuri says, "We take different risks for different results. Your lieutenant need feel no shame; we're unsuited to the defense of more than a caravan, let alone a generations-old town and its traditions."

Tilara grins at the comment on progress. "We don't have to worry about leaving our best people behind to guard the town, either."

Andreth rubs his chin, looking unusually contemplative, as if something's nagging at him. Finally he speaks up. "How come you thought they was extinct?"

"Very well. I can ask some of my scouts to trail. But they're not combat hardened." Lady San looks pensive. "How many will go?"

Lady San turns to Andreth. "The first Majors wrote of their extinction in the earliest journals. After the great Mage War, the foramen. the beastmen servants of Methilwillani, roamed free in the woods. But generation after generation, fewer of them were seen, so that when the Emperor sent out his call for troops, no foramen answered."

Andreth nods. "Guess maybe they just didn't wanna answer. Or maybe they was too deep in the woods to hear him callin'."

Yuri says, "If they'd heard, would they have answered? What reason would they have to serve the Emperor?"

Tilara says, "Or ... these may be from another area, and only moved in recently."

"Perhaps, Andreth. And perhaps ... we don't know, Yuri. When the emperor assumed power, they were already thought extinct." She shakes her head. "The stories are shifting again."

Yuri says, "One wonders if the walls of Jordah's labyrinth are indeed etched in stone..."

Tormel looks up. "The servants of Methilwillani? Then they really did exist?" he looks fascinated.

Yuri murmurs to Starguard, "Which one is Methilwillani?"

Starguard shakes his head. "He's not a god ..."

Yuri says, "I don't think that I've heard of this. Who was Methilwillani?"

Tormel jumps in. "He was a magnificent scholar, a mage of great repute. A bit oversensitive about his height, apparently. He ..." Lady San interrupts. "He founded Thorpenhow, raising the tower in one night. And then, one afternoon, he was summoned by Krillani to combat. For three days and three nights we could see the fires flash, from the tower. For three days and three nights a pall of smoke hung thick on the air." She pauses, and Tormel takes up the refrain. "And only three servants returned to Thorpenhow, on the ninth day. Jem Barton, Garth Greer, and Aloisius Eloy."

Tilara says, "Krillani? Who was he?"

Lady San looks irritated at the interruption from Tormel. "In any case, once the servants had recovered, a small party was formed to retrace their steps. And all that was left to do was to bury the dead that had fallen on both sides. And to this day, only bindweed grows in the barrows. And all this because Krillani had decided that he would rule these forests. History suggests, Tilara, that he was a most unpleasant war-mage."

Yuri says, "Well... one of the Foramen did indicate that Grikulga was... shorter than average."

Tilara says, "Barton, Greer and Eloy? The ancestors of the three farming syndics?"

Lady San raises an eyebrow. "How odd. But ... are you suggesting that Grikugra is in fact Methilwillani?"

Tormel nods at Tilara. "That's quite possible. The three servants, legend has it, inherited the mage's tower. He had no family."

Yuri shakes his head. "Not at all. Just possibly that they've got a tradition of having shortish leaders."

Lady San hmmms. "Perhaps. I don't know. The journals aren't even entirely clear on what was odd about Methilwillani's height."

Tilara snorts. "Of course... because when it was written, everyone knew."

Yuri sighs. "Well, if they were his servants, then left to their own devices, they've become somewhat troublesome. Their old master would not appreciate them attacking the people of his town."

Lady San nods. "Will you go as my emissaries? I give you leave to make first treaties, that we may parley."

Tilara looks to Yuri.

Yuri looks a bit worried.

Andreth says, "Dunno if they're _interested_ in a treaty. But can't hurt to try."

Yuri says, "Well... maybe we should tell you how the interrogation went."

Tilara nods. "Have to agree with Andreth. We'd be happy to negotiatie, but ..."

The Company summarizes the events of the past three days, including the visits to the Syndics, meeting the wolf, and the ambush and counter-ambush by the Foramen. They finish with a complete account of the interrogation - including Yuri's threat..

Yuri says, "I didn't say anything that was untrue. I'm quite sure that if it comes to war, the Emperor will spare no expense in hunting down traitorous tribes. And I'll personally go after anyone I see harming the innocent. However, Grikurga may expect the threat to be somewhat more immediate."

Lady San finishes taking notes. "Thank you, Yuri. Thank you, all of you. And yes ... he may. When you return, may we keep the Andvarri?"

Tilara chuckles. "You'd probably do better to ask Karlsefni himself. I suspect he has his own plans." She turns serious again. "And they have business of their own in Citadel, which parallels our own, I suspect."

Lady San stops herself. "I'm sorry; I misspoke. Until you return, rather. If we must gird ourselves for war, these are good warriors to have on the wall."

Tilara shrugs. "The same applies, really. They may want to go along, or not."

Yuri says, "They have their own mission, to deliver a message to someone in Citadel. They're not too clear to us on who it is, except that it's a warning about the war. They may not be able to stay for long."

"Will you ask them for me, Yuri?" Lady San sips from her tea.

Yuri says, "The best I can do is to bring them your message. Perhaps when they're done with their current mission they will return. I can say no more than that."

"Surely these few days will not count so heavily, Yuri. I worry about attacks before the parleys have properly started." Lady San sighs. "And I have so few veterans."

Yuri nods. "I see. Well, they're travelling with us, and they're always up for a fight, so they'll probably agree to help you in our absence."

"Thank you. I'll send along two scouts. They'll be behind you; you won't see them, but they'll always keep you in sight." Lady San writes a short note. "Just take this to the barracks."

Yuri chews his lower lip. "I hope they come back safe."

Yuri accepts the note.

"So do I. I, we, have very few scouts." Lady San stands up. "Thank you again, for your aid."

Yuri stands, and nods. "We save who we can."

Tilara stands up and bows slightly. "You've been more than generous with your time and equipment, milady. We will do what we can."

Lady San summons the butler, who escorts the party to the front door. After some discussion with the Andvarri, Karlsefni agrees that they will stay for three days, before they must press on alone if need be. The prisoners have been unshackled, and Starguard has prayed over their wounds, and now they're waiting in the courtyard.

Two young people are presented to the group as Frankie and Johny. They both look to be about sixteen years, and look as much like one another as a boy and a girl can. Frankie takes the lead. "We'll stay in your shadow, we will. You'll never see us." Johnny nods. Informed that Andreth will travel with them, they look troubled at first, then shrug. "If we're seen, we run. Lady's orders. We'll teach you simple sign on the way out, Andreth." She seems supremely confident in her abilities.

The party sets out, reduced to just the White Company, with Andreth following with the scouts. Before the main party leaves town, the scouts fade into the fields, and disappear from sight. They take great care not to be seen by the prisoners. The prisoners set off cross country, heading roughly south south west, and angling towards the forest.

By late afternoon the party has reached the stream that will also meander through the first campsite. The crossing is swift, and on the far side two wolves pace the party as the foramen turn towards the forest.

Yuri says, "Those wolves... how did they know to wait for us?"

The prisoner shrugs his shoulder. "Don't know. They come, they go."

Yuri nods. _Well... I'm sure we can get ourselves out of whatever mess we're walking into._

The party reaches the forest by nightfall, and the bigger foraman stops. "Camp or keep going?"

Tilara says, "How far yet?"

"Hour? Two? Maybe camp moved." The man shrugs. "We go last camp, check sign."

Yuri says, "I think we keep going. Time is short."

Tilara nods. "I concur."

The foramen grin, and lead the party into the forest. After an hour, they get challenged by a guard. A brief conversation ensues, and four more wolves come loping up to form an honour guard for the party. The bigger foraman turns to Yuri. "Grikugrah will see you." Behind them, Andreth and the scouts follow, careful to stay far enough back that anyone following the party won't notice them.

Yuri nods, and looks carefully at the wolves.

Tilara looks around. "There's more of them. Let's hope we don't have to fight our way out."

Yuri murmurs, "We're here to make peace. Only a fool would force us to kill them."

Soon the party enters a clearing. A large fire in the centre provides all the light there is. There's one large tent, straight ahead, guarded by two foramen. To the left, three long tents stand guarded also, although from the cries and laughter it's quite obvious that the tent contains women and children. On the right there are no tents, though there are rows of bedrolls.

A short, squat foraman dressed in shiny, ivory coloured platemail, steps out of the tent. He looks the party over, pursing his lips, then ignores you to talk with the foramen. Their report is apparently short and unsatisfactory, and after a few moments they fade into the surrounding trees. He turns to face the party. "I Grikugrah."

Yuri quickly counts the visible guards and wolves. _Outnumbered more than five to one..._

From where they're hidden in the forest, Frankie, Johnny, and Andreth can't make out the conversation, tohugh they can see a faint glare off the campsite. Twice, a foraman on patrol passes within feet of Andreth's hiding place.

Yuri says, "Yuri." He points at the other members of the Company. "Tilara. Ash. Firestorm. Starguard." He turns back to Grikugrah. "We come from the Major at Thorpenhow. We want to talk about wolfmen and hawkmen."

Grikugrah spits on the ground in front of you. "Why talk?"

Yuri says, "Less people die if we talk now. Less of your people. Less of my people. There are more of mine than there are of yours. You've lived close to dying out for a very long time."

Yuri says, "You want power for yourself. You want your people to live again. You help the hawks and wolves, you risk all their lives."

Four more foramen come out of the tent, and stand two to a side behind Grikugrah. He turns around, counting the foramen. "I count; more of us than of you. I think you weak. I think you afraid. I think you speak with voice of woman."

Grikugrah begins to look impatient, and more foramen file out behind him.

Yuri scowls. "We come to your camp. There are four of you to one of us, not counting the wolves. If we feared you we wouldn't be here."

A single shrug is all Grikugrah offers in reaction. Then a man steps out of the tent, and bends over to whisper something in his ear. Grikugrah nods, smiling. "I not impressed. I say prove yourself. Then maybe I listen."

Yuri says, "Fine. Who fights who?"

The foramen break into laughter. "Fight? You not proved worthy of fight. You prove self; go to great clearing. Travel through the bindweed. Bring sword from barrow. Then, you may use sword in combat." Grikugrah grins. "Grargh show you clearing."

Yuri stops speaking to Grikurgah.

Yuri says, "So. You're the one we really came to see. Can we skip dealing with the lackeys now?"

Grargh steps forward, then looks puzzled, wondering who Yuri is talking to.

Yuri gestures to the human. "You."

The man raises an eyebrow, from where he stands behind Grikugrah. "Surely, sir, you jest. I am but a humble servant. And I think, Grikugrah, that now he should fetch two swords. From two barrows."

Tilara says, "You fear to let us speak with anyone else, Grikurgrah?"

Grikugrah, his hands still shifting, narrows his eyes. "Speak, little woman. Speak. But we listen only to those who have proven themselves. And we kill those who speak unproven. So ... " His hand swings wide in invitation. "Speak freely. My men hunger."

Yuri says, "I doubt it. I know how the lines of power go. But fine. We'll play this game for now. We'll get your swords from the barrows. But it would save a whole lot of time if we'd cut to the chase."

Some of the foramen begin to crowd forward, surrounding the party. For now, they're still coming no closer than a man's length, but several men are obviously measuring Tilara's curve, and one man has disappeared behind the great tent, returning with a large cauldron.

Grikugrah grins. "No. No chase. Just swords. Then fight. Then ... then if still alive, speak." Grargh coughs. "Come."

Tilara whispers to Yuri as Grik smiles. "Watch it. He's a spellcaster of some sort."

Grargh leads the party into the forest. As you travel deeper into the forest, wolves press close upon you until you're surrounded by at least eight wolves.

Yuri whispers back to Tilara, "Which one? Ugly, or the human?"

Andreth, Frankie, and Johnny slowly trail the pack of wolves, and the party too. Nobody else seems to be trailing the party.

Tilara whispers, "Grikurgrah himself. He was angry when you talked to the other fellow, and tried to cast a spell on you when you did. Silently, too, so he may be very good at it."

After many hours, when the sky is beginning to grow brighter and the Mother Star is making ready to set, Grargh stops. Ahead of him is a clearing, covered in matted ground cover. Barrows lie in concentric circles. He points. "Two swords from two hills." He sits down, leaning against a tree, and closes his eyes. The wolves loll around him, settling down for naps.

Yuri whispers back to Tilara, "I gotta wonder why that man is here at all."

Tilara shrugs. "I think you're right... he's awfully free with advice for an emissary. But he may have got Grik buffaloed into thinking he's in charge."

Yuri whispers to Tilara, "Even if he's pretty good, he failed to do anything to me. Points in our favor, eh? The little toad is no better than Ferg and I'd love to take his head off."

Tilara nods. "Understood. Let's hope you do."

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "I think you might be right about that 'servant'. I can't figure on the Changers being dependant on Grik. He's just another pawn."

Yuri says, "Well... shall we dive right in, or wait a bit first?"

The party looks at the barrows, which look daunting in the poor light. They decide to follow Grargh's lead, and take a comfortable nap while waiting for sunlight. Andreth, for now, stays with the scouts who hide a short distance away.
