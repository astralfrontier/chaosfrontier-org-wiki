The entrance of the cave looms unpromisingly in the early morning light. Tilara, back at the camp, is being entertained by Tormel, while the others - with the aid of Karlsefnir and the larger hunting cat - move forward to investigate. As before, the cave looks empty, and undisturbed. Or swept clean; it's not obvious which.

At the far end there are three passages. Previously, the party explored the rightmost passage.

Much like the rightmost passage, the middle passage is rough, and highly likely the result of natural forces. With Stormy holding the lantern, Yuri carefully and cautiously makes his way down the passage, prodding the floor regularly. All seems perfectly normal until the rapier sinks about three inches into the floor.

Yuri holds up his hand for a halt, and checks the floor, ceiling, and walls in this area. _Another illusion, I bet._

Yuri says, "OK, we've got another pit here."

Yuri says, "Without Tilara, we're going to have to do this the slow way."

Yuri breaks out the rope.

Yuri says, "Someday we're going to have to come up with a better way of traversing pits..."

Starguard says, "Like levitation? Not my department."

Working gingerly with the rope, the party lowers itself into the expected pit. The illusion fades as Yuri is the first to slide through it, revealing yet another pit. The bottom is rocky, and full of shadows. But at the far end there doesn't seem to be a further tunnel.

Yuri says, "Two short planks would be good, but they're kind of hard to fit in your pockets."

Ash coughs. "Yuri," he hisses, trying to get the lead man's attention unobtrusively. His head nods, quickly and sharply, toward a shadow at the far end.

The bottom of the crevasse spreads perhaps thirty feet, width wise, and is perhaps eight feet long. The floor is uneven, as are the walls, throwing up many and varied shadows.

Yuri assumes a defensive stance behind any convenient rocks, and tosses his candle in the direction Ash indicated.

The candle flies through the air in a low arc, the breeze of its passage extinguishing it before it falls to the ground with a wet thump.

Yuri thinks, _I'm beginning to hate holes in the ground almost as much as canines._

Yuri murmurs, "I can't see it, but I'll keep looking."

Ash follows Yuri down, cautious and ready. The party is expecting trouble, but he seems almost to anticipate it.

After everyone else has gingerly climbed down, Yuri moves towards the shadow Ash has pointed out. It's a spur of rock, and around the end of it there's a slim passage, less than five feet wide, with a ceiling little more than five feet. This tunnel, though, looks somewhat worked; in places there are obvious tool marks accounting for the width of the passage.

Starguard follows, frowning. "I hate caves. Too closed in."

Yuri says, "You'd probably prefer somewhere that you can see your Stars. I don't blame you."

It is, at times, a squeeze working through the passage, and there is no hope of marching two abreast. Even fighting in these quarters would be uncomfortable. The passage turns, and twists, before it finally begins to widen. First the ceiling rises, and then the passage opens into a large irregularly shaped cave. An occupied cave, to judge by the barrels that stand here and there.

And, of course, the small hunched creature that steps in to the light of your lantern and holds out his morning star. "Passwords", it hisses. "The passwordss ..."

Yuri steps forward so that the others can get out of the tunnel, and narrows his eyes at the thing. "What about the passwords? Don't you already know them?"

The creature backs up a step, his hands fondling his morning star. "Passwordss ... you givesses the passwordssss ..." Behind him, two more creature step into the gap between the barrels. Each is holding a javelin in the ready position ...

Starguard frowns. "No, it's supposed to work the other way. We say Password? and you answer. Right. Password?"

The creature hisses at Starguard. "You ... not knowing ... " The creatures take cover behind the barrels, yelling something incomprehensible.

Starguard says, "It's a joke! Of course we know the password."

One of the creatures jumps up, flinging a javelin at the party, and then ducking again. Pity he forgot to take time to aim.

Stormy leaps over one of the other barrels, swinging his club over his head. But the enthusiasm gets the better of him, and he misses quite soundly.

Leaping atop the barrels, Ash's head ducks low and his two-hander flashes forward - confining in the space available, but at an advantage as he half-falls off the barrel and impales one of the trio on its point.

Yuri, in an uncharacterestically competent move, jabs his rapier over some barrels and through a creature standing behind, in a neat but fatal blow.

Barreling ahead, Karlsefnir ducks and jumps over the barrel, following his morning star which lands squarely in the side of the head of the last critter standing. The creature screams, and then sinks to the ground.

Deeper in the cave, behind more barrels, there is the sound of people - or creatures - grabbing weapons.

Starguard sighs, his crossbow waiting for a target that's already dead. "No one talks out their problems anymore," he sighs, then turns towards the sounds of scrambling.

As Andreth moves forward through the second line of barrels, he sees more of these creatures. Two of them immediately swing at him, one clipping him on the thigh.

Yuri says, "Some people just don't appreciate diplomacy, Starguard."

Starguard's shot fires at a popping head, which ducks, the bolt skittering over the top of the barrels harmlessly.

Starguard says, "Yeah, well, careful, they're fast little buggers."

Andreth roars as his opponent's weapon clips him on the thigh, the edge of his palm scything into the side of the creature's neck, and it collapses with a gurgle. Leaning forward with the force of the blow, he lashes out with a foot, and the other one sprawls out behind the barrel, unmoving.

Two of the creatures, uttering battle cries, jump up from behind the barrels long enough to fling their javelins at Andreth, catching him in thigh and arm. Vlood slowly begins to flow.

Stormy moves into the room, running to the far corridor. Peering down it, he keeps one eye on the combat behind him, and the other on the corridor.

Running forward, his sword held tight and braced along his forearm, Ash lets it swing out in an arcing downward swing. The sudden red warmth of blood on skin as his armor is punctured stops him only a little, and again his weapon makes an unstoppable finish to another of the party's assailants.

Yuri misses his opportunity to strike a remaining creature over a moral dilemma about giving them an opportunity to surrender first.

As one of the remaining creatures targets Yuri, Karlsefnir concentrates on the other exit. The one Stormy isn;t guarding. He looks down the passage, his back to the combat here, so as to keep others from ambushing the party from behind.

Starguard shouts, "Surrender or die, villians!" His crossbow twangs, sending another bolt clattering harmlessly by the ducking heads, as the creatures scramble for cover and to attack.

Andreth ducks under Starguard's errant crossbow bolt and swings a fist heavily into the chest of the nearest creature, but the force of the blow is so great that it throws him off balance for a moment, so that the follow-up swing whistles through the air a foot away from the next one's face.

Backed into corners and tight corners, it's harder to fight; Yuri and one of the creatures trade jabs without scoring any touches.

One of the remaining pair thrusts its javelin forward, and Ash's offense turns to a quick improvised defense as his sword changes direction to bat aside the weapon. His own attack spoiled, he nevertheless grins. "Give up yet?"

"Eeek! Ack! Eeeeeek!"

Starguard tries to aim a little more carefully, but still misses, a bolt winging just between Andreth and the creature. "Stormy! What're you looking at?"

Stormy turns back. "Ambush! Just in case! And the corner is too crowded for me to burn anything!"

Yuri says, "Good thinking! Umm... where's the cat?"

Stormy points. "With Karl!"

Andreth's fists fly as he wades into the corner, going into a _kata_ taught to him by Brother Oak that the party's seen before... though the effect is somewhat spoiled when the second blow whiffs over the head of the creature as it's felled by the very first blow. But he handles it masterfully, turning the swing into a spinning strike that slams the other one into the wall with a crunching sound.

Starguard moves to Andreth, quickly calling down the stars help to heal his wounds, blue hands glowing. "Any more o them?"

Starguard gahs, noting that he's losing the creatures, and quickly turns to healing them, stabilizing...

Andreth shakes his head, looking more relaxed as the healing energies wash through him. "Not round here. I bet there's more down them tunnels, o' course."

Yuri moves to check the contents of the barrels.

While Starguard moves to heal Andreth's scratches, the cat moves into the room, sniffing each bleeding body carefully. But at no point does the cat hiss to indicate a lack of smell.

Ash takes up guard duty, letting Karl oversee one passage while he keeps a keen eye trained on the other.

Yuri opens up the barrels carefully. Those closest to the entrance contain basic food stuffs. Cured hams, cheeses, and one of them is definitely an untapped beer keg. The barrels by the wall contain straw, and rags, with the exception of the one chest, where Yuri strikes paydirt. Wrapped in a grubby blanket he finds a golden necklace, lying on top of three pouches.

Starguard manages to stabilize four of the creatures; alas, he had to choose who to save and whom to let die. And the other five have slowly but surely bled to death.

Andreth watches Starguard in obvious bemusement, but shrugs. Technically, we're the intruders here, after all. "What the heck are they, anyhow?"

Starguard sighs, shaking his head, and turns to Ash. "Pity... I hate to see lives end." He turns to Ash, shrugging. "Need some help?"

Yuri dumps the pouches and neckalce into his pack. _If we have time, maybe we should come back for the food... and the keg. I could use a few drinks after this._

Ash pats his side, smiling cheerfully. "Just lost a little blood. I've got plenty more, but sure, if you want."

Checking the creatures' pouches, Yuri's haul is much smaller. A double handful of coppers, three silvers, and six dice. The leather armour the creatures wear is badly stained, poorly patched, and generally damaged by now. Not really worth keeping. The workmanship on the weapons isn't much better.

Yuri regards the former guards carefully, and moves to bind the hands and feet of the survivors with rags from the others.

Yuri says, "You'd think that with money like that, they wouldn't be sitting in a dump like this."

Starguard says, "I suspect there were the guards, and not the owners," remarks Starguard as he sees to Ash's wounds.

Yuri says, "Let's move on. Those rags will keep them bound while we're finishing here. After that, their survival is up to the mercy of the Gods."

Ash lets a brief chill run through him as his wounds are closed. "This isn't at all what I expected when I started this life," he murmurs. "All that loot there? Give you good odds it was stolen.. "

Starguard says, "Unlikely that the pervious owners could claim it though. Some groups aren't nearly as competent."

Stormy looks down the far tunnel. "It smells down here. These people aren't big on hygiene, are they?"

Andreth says, "Ain't surprisin'. They ain't exactly dressed in high fashion from Citadel either."

Stormy shrugs. "I wonder what they are. They remind me of the bogeymen Sister Jane used to tell me about."

Swinging back into formation down the narrow passage, the party travels east slowly and cautiously. At one point Yuri stops, as water flows across the passage, but it's only a shallow stream.

A few steps further, the passage opens up into a roomy tear shaped cave. Chests are arranged to form barricades, but they all look abandoned.

Stormy whispers, "Careful. I can hear 'em breathing."

Cautiously fanning out into the larger cave, the party hears nothing beyond a light breathing.

As Andreth moves behind the chests, he can see past the crates. Lying on a pallet is a woman. A blonde woman. One hand dangles off the edge, as she sleeps peacefully.

The woman does not wake as Andreth and Yuri move closer. Her other hand is holding the blankets, while her head lies on a thick pillow. More blanket is shading her face, making her hard to recognize, but she looks familiar.

Andreth gives Yuri a questioning look... it's clear the young monk is puzzled by the situation. He makes as if to advance further, to see if there's any other surprises waiting for us...

Starguard moves up behind the two, using his crossbow to cover.

Stormy gestures to Karlsefnir, and whispers, _Bring the cat here. She might be a shapechanger._"

The cat slowly pads forwards, following Stormy's lead. As they come within a few feet of the sleeping woman, the smell of perfume is overpowering. Where Berina's perfume was subtle in Woolwich, this perfume is ... dense. The cat looks unhappy, going so far as to rub it's nose against its leg, before retreating.

Andreth scratches his head, sniffing. "Whew. Can't tell _what_ she s'posed to smell like," he whispers.

Stormy whispers, "Can we make her take a bath?"

Andreth comes up closer, and his eyes pop, nearly crying out with surprise. "Whuh... what's _she_ doin' here?"

Slowly the lady wakes, her eyes opening. She spots Andreth, standing over her, and gasps softly, before sitting up. One hand clasps the blanket to her bosom, but it's obvious she's not wearing much.

Yuri murmurs quietly, "Everyone back off. Miss... who are you, and what are you doing in this place?"

Stormy moves along the wall to join Karlsefnir at the other exit. He glances at Berina for a moment, then blushes and looks away.

Andreth blushes himself, taking a step back as Yuri advances.

Starguard's crossbow never wavers in the slightest, frowning heavily.

Berina straightens, her eyes narrowing as she notices the other people moving around. "You! What do you want?" Her voice is simultaneously sinuous, caressing Andreth's ear drums even as the words command him to explain himself.

Yuri says, "We're here to get our friends back. Someone from this cave kidnapped them yesterday. Who are you, and what are you doing in this place?"

Berina raises one eyebrow. "Why, I'm Berina. You look familiar, young lad. I'm sure I remember that impertinence from somewhere ..."

Starguard says, "Would you mind telling us where? We've been dealing with dopplegangers of late. Besides, considering the goblins in the next room haven't attacked you, we're a mite suspicious."

Berina turns to look at Starguard. "Is this interrogation really necessary? Could I at least have a little privacy to get dressed? Honestly ... the manners of today." Her blanket droops a little, unintentionally to be sure, revealing most of one gloriously naked breast.

Starguard says, "Ma'am, I'm not even moving this crossbow an inch."

Yuri says, "I don't think that the Berina we know would be hiding in a hole in the ground on the road to Citadel. That's not her style. Perhaps you can elaborate? We've told you what we're doing here. It would be courteous for you to do the same."

Yuri says, "And before you ask again, yes, this is necessary. Two men in my care have vanished. Another is dead. We can't trust the faces we see."

The lady nods. "I see." Wrapping the blanket more securely around herself, she stands up from the pallet and bends over, opening one of the crates. Pulling out a loose tunic she holds it out. "May I?" She turns to look at Yuri. "Impertinence, lad. It's a deadly sin."

Andreth blushing, mutters, "or anything else"

Yuri says, "So is carelessness, milady. My Father Pesci taught me that."

Berina smiles. "Father Pesci taught many lessons. Now, if I may?" She drops the blankets, proving that she's not wearing a stitch of clothing, before shimmying into the tunic. The tunic falls mid thigh, and creeps up higher when she bends over the chest again to retrieve a belt.

Andreth shuffles his feet and coughs, his gaze flickering aside to the far exit for a moment.

Yuri says, "I'm disappointed that you don't remember us. Nor have you told us what you're doing here. These really don't seem like your class of people at all."

Starguard says, "Not to mention that you smell like a cheap whore, which I think Berina would never do."

Yuri frowns. _My, that was crude..._

Berina raises her eyebrow again at Yuri. "Yes. You are definitely memorable. Such impertinence is ... rare ... in a whelp so young." She shrugs. "But should I remember every youth who fails in his commission?" She turns to Starguard. "You are familiar, I presume, with the creatures who inhabit the other caves? And, perhaps, with their personal hygiene habits? Or lack thereof? It may be overkill, but it's less painful than the alternative." She place one hand on her hip, using the other to flip back her hair. "Now. Really. A woman alone is always abused, isn't she. Is that why ... what was her name? Tilara? Tilara joined you?"

Andreth shakes his head. "Dunno, ma'am. What _are_ you doin' here?" he asks. Subtle he ain't.

Yuri says, "We didn't fail in our commission. You wanted us to find that dagger, didn't you?"

Heaving a big sigh, Berina sits down on one of the crates. "Well, lad, a few moments ago, I was sleeping. I'm ... " She sighs breastfully, and nods absently at Yuri. "I'm enroute to Citadel. I have an urgent message for Zamua."

Stormy peeks back, and looks relieved when he sees she's dressed. "When did you meet Tilara, ma'am?"

Karlsefnir looks up at the mention of Zamua, his eyes narrowing.

Starguard says, "Considering we've been on the road all the time, and the fact that you started out of Woolwich heading the other way, I'm rather curious how you got by us."

Yuri says, "Hold a moment, Starguard."

Berina shrugs delicately. "Why ... Starguard, wasn't it? I rode a horse for much of the way. It died two days ago, so I'll be on foot until I reach Cairnstoke."

Yuri says, "What makes you think we failed in our commission? You hired us to find a dagger, with a gem in the hilt."

Yuri says, "Really, you can't have forgotten that so quickly."

Yuri does his best to look like he's hiding indignance. "We get good results, milady. I'm hurt that you don't remember."

Berina turns to Yuri. "I haven't. But I don't recall you _delivering_ the dagger." For a moment her eyes close to mere slits, as she almost hisses. "I _needed_ that dagger."

Berina pulls out a necklace from the chest, and fingers its beads thoughtfully. "Now, if you're quite done, you impertinent child?"

Andreth sighs, rubbing his head. This is all too much for the lad. "So, what happened t'ya anyway? Road to Citadel's back that way," he says, pointing down the tunnel the party entered from.

Ash stays quiet, standing as sentinel near the stream. Wiser heads than his seem to be prevailing.

"I was taking a nap, child. The road was long, and I was tired." She looks around. "These may not be the best rooms on the road, but it beats sleeping onder a bush. That does nothing for my complexion." She stretches lazily, emphasizing the long fine muscles in her long long legs ...

Yuri pulls several inches on his rapier. "No. I'm not done. Put that down. I don't know who you are, but you aren't Berina. She was the most amazing women I'd ever met. She'd remember us, because we didn't fall for her charms. You're as subtle as a cart of tin bells, and a lousy liar. If we were able to control our passions around her, you'll not sway us with lesser tricks."

Yuri says, "I want to know who you are. If you're Berina, I want to know why you needed that dagger. You never told us. And if you're not Berina, we have a bone to pick with you. Either way, you're a dangerous lady and the only way you're getting out of here is under guard."

Berina puts down the beads. "Boy, you weary me. Shall we fence? Shall we sue for peace? Will you feel better if you tie me up all nice and tight?" She wriggles thoughtfully. "Although I'd prefer clean ropes. The ones they have here are past their due dates." She smiles for a moment. "As for the dagger; let me say that it is a private matter. We need the dagger for a small ceremony that would seem meaningless to you."

Karlsefnir moves to Stormy's side. _Zamua? She mentioned Zamua?_

Starguard says, "I would assume it has to do with Samaela?"

Berina shakes her head. "No. Nothing so earth shattering."

Stormy nods. _She says she needs to deliver a message to Zamua. But she's not said why she's down here in a hole in the ground._

Yuri says, "We don't have time for this."

Karlsefnir nods. _Zamua is lady of many talents. Is why we bring warning._

Berina smiles, holding out her hands. "Tie me up then, while you explore. I won't mind."

Stormy nods. _You are warning her, or warning against her?_

Yuri says, "I think you should come with us, and yes, I think you should be bound. Whoever you are, we can't afford to turn our back to you."

Berina nods. "Very well, young man. Tie me up carefully then."

After carefully tying Berina's wrists together, she is given in to Andreth's care while Yuri examines the chests. Most of the chests turn out to be empty, although there are a few more interesting ones. One contains a fortune in silverware, with elaborately carved handles. Another, the one from which Berina pulled her short tunic, contains a collection of similarly coloured tunics. Experience suggests to Yuri that these tunics may comprise a livery of sorts, although no final badge has been affixed as yet. And nestled in a small pouch are two intensely blue gemstones.

Starguard looks. "Your stuff?"

Berina shakes her head. "No. I lost most of my pack in an accident. What I have now is all loaned." She sighs mournfully. "My favourite dress."

Yuri leaves them. "If we secure this place, we can come back for it. If not, we're going to need to move in a hurry."

Yuri says, "We have to get moving. Andreth, please take care of our guest. Make sure that no damage is dealt to or by her."

Andreth nods to Yuri. "Yessir."

Yuri takes a moment to examine the livery.

The livery is made up in rich velvets, coloured grass green and carmine red. The colours are ... evocative of Potapka, but ... this livery could belong to anyone until the final badges are attached. And those seem to be missing.

Ash muses to himself, considering the situation in the chamber beyond. _If she's a shapechanger or something equally bad, it means Perf and Jermiah might be close at hand.. and if she's really who she claims, she might have some information.. either way, it feels like we're on the right track._

Yuri casts a glance over 'Berina'. _Really not bad... if she'd take a bath..._

Yuri says, "So, milady... you said you know how to fence?"

Starguard stays in the rear, his crossbow pointed at Berina's back, quiet.

Berina smiles. "Isn't that what you've been trying to do, young man?"

Andreth laughs. "She's got ya there."

While Andreth keeps a close eye on the bound Berina, Yuri moves a few chests out of the way and leads the way. His gaze roams around the passage as he walks, and he inspects the floor intensely. Eventually he reaches another cave. This one definitely shows signs of habitation. Weapons lie piled up along the left wall, while chests have been used to cordon off one area into a sort of room. Where a man sits, meditating, on the rug.

Yuri shrugs. "I may be young, but I've learned that subtlety saves lives. The lives of my allies, and even the lives of our opponents. My allies will tell you the extents that we go to, to spare our opponents, even when rapid dispatch would be easier."

Yuri hushes as he catches sight of the meditating man.

Berina leans forward to answer Yuri. "Does that mean, young man, that you will spare my life?" She raises one eyebrow. "An interesting conceit."

The man looks up, at the sound of voices, and flows to his feet. "Greetings." He sounds unperturbed, as though used to being interrupted at all hours by strangers.

Ash brings up the rear, looking rather perturbed by something. He seems to be studying the blood of the creatures he dispatched as it dries on his weapon, eyeing it with consuming interest.

Yuri glances back at Berina. "If you are Berina, your life is not mine to take our spare. Rather, I suspect that the situation would be the reverse."

Yuri says, "Umm... good day to you, sir. We come seeking our lost comrades. Have you seen them?"

Chuckling, Berina looks at her ropes. "Shall I kill you now, to prove who I am?" She looks up at the man. "They captured me, Fernando. See? They bind my wrists." She holds her wrists up, and grins.

Yuri notices her bonds, and starts. "Andreth!", he barks!

Andreth reaches out as fast as he can, to catch her on the wrist.

Starguard twitches behind Berina. "Would you mind? I almost let the bolt go."

Andreth then glances at Yuri. "Eh? What's up?"

Yuri turns to Berina for a moment, and glowers. "Don't give me an excuse."

Andreth says, "Then we need to retie the bonds - maybe someone else could have a turn this time, while Yuri chats with Fernando."

Yuri turns back to Fernando. "Do you two know each other?"

Fernando raises one eyebrow. "Of course. She is my guest. I really think you should untie her."

Starguard says, "We're having problems believing she's Berina and not a doppleganger, and we don't know who you are, so we think we shouldn't."

Yuri says, "Perhaps. Shapeshifters took two men from my camp outside. Another was killed by giant mosquitos in these caves. My only concern is to get my two men back safely. Do you happen to know where they are?"

Fernando tsk tsks. "Honestly. I think you should." His hand moves to a pouch on his belt, fingers slipping inside.

Stormy raises his hands into the firing arc of his fire spell. "Don't, please."

Andreth growls. "Look, Mister, whoever you are, we got our own business with this woman. Now, if you got a good reason why we should let her go, we wanna hear it. And don't try 'n scare us into it, neither."

Fernando, as urbane as ever, pulls his hand back out of the pouch. He is holding a single, dried rose. "Why, lad, I think you should let her go for she is my guest, and hospitality demands that you release her.

Yuri says, "Very well. You tell me where I can find my men, you can have her."

Yuri grins.

Yuri says, "That's a trade of hospitality."

Yuri says, "If these are your caves, then either you, or another one of your guests has been making trouble for me, and I demand satisfaction."

Fernando nods. "Very well. Who are your men?"

Yuri says, "They are named Perf and Jemiah. Two shapeshifter, of some kind, came into our camp with their appearance."

Yuri says, "They took a third of their kind into these caves with them. That man had been impersonating a merchant we were guarding. That merchant was found dead, from mosquito bites, in the upper galleries."

"And these two young men are healthy? Robust?" Fernando nods. "I do believe my friend Gregorio is hosting them. You can find him down the passage."

Stormy looks a little bothered. "Should we split up? Tilara was rather insistent that we shouldn't..."

Yuri frowns. "Then perhaps you would be so good as to escort us to your friend, and introduce us. I see no need to be more rude than we already have been." He grins again. "I really do try to be civilized. But out here on the lawless road, there is so little true authority, yes."

Andreth nods a little to Stormy. "Yeah, true..." He glances between Yuri and Fernando.

Fernando gently sits back down again, placing the rose in front of him. "I regret; I must finish my meditations. Tell Gregorio that I have sent you, and all will be well."

Yuri leads the Company towards the far tunnel.

The passage extends perhaps a hundred feet before opening up into the largest cavern yet. Inside, the party can see seven critters huddled in the corner, intent on a dice game. In the far corner a man is sitting, feet up on the barrel. He looks up when the party enters.

Yuri says, "Fernando sent us. We've come for our missing guards. This lady" - he indicates Berina - "was good enough to escort us."

The man looks up. "Who do you seek?"

Yuri says, "Perf, and Jemiah. The real Perf and Jemiah, if you please."

As Yuri speaks, the creatures cease their dice game and grab weapons. It looks precautionary.

Berina speaks up. "It's alright, Gregorio. Fernando sent these people to you." Gregorio stands up, his face pale.

Yuri looks at the creatures, blinks, and the scowls. "You gonna rush us? Then get on with it. I don't have time for games."

Yuri says, "Otherwise, give me my men."

The creatures stare unblinkingly. Meanwhile, Gregorio pulls a throwing knife from his sleeve.

Andreth sees the throwing knife leave its sheath, and immediately turns his attention to the would-be prisoner, lunges for her and tries to pinion her... and gets two fists in the ribs for his trouble. He coughs, a bit of blood dripping from his cheek, and he yells, "Ugh! Sonova... Yuri, she ain't normal!"

Karlsefnir advances on the creatures, his morning star in hand, and tries to catch one under the chin. But as he swings, they duck and jab him from below, catching him in the upper legs and staggering him for a moment.

Yuri swears. "Nobody ever listens...." He draws his rapier and charges at Gregorio, dodging away from the other man's clumsy punch.

Starguard's finger is almost cramped, but he finally gets the shot off, right into the middle Berina's back, causing her to cry out!

Yuri shouts back to Andreth, "Don't kill her! We can't take that chance!"

As Karlsefnir swings his morning star around, two more of the creatures crowd around him, one nicking him in the waist.

Ash rushes out, his sword ready to aid an unlikely ally. In a single sweep of his blade, the fate of one of Karlsefnir's enemies is decided. He spits a curse whose recipient is unclear - the downed vermin, Karl or even himself.

Berina tries to clobber Andreth again, with her hands tied together. But now, expecting the blow, he bends out of the way. Her face contorts with pain.

Gregorio, seeing Yuri right in front of him, slams out with his fists. Yuri manages to duck the one, and leans straight into the other. Now his ribs, like Andreth's, feel a smidge sore. Meanwhile, the two creatures concentrate on Stormy, ut both miss.

Stormy shouts as the creatures attack, and bashes one with his quarterstaff as the room degenerates into melee. His target collapses at the blow, and he glares at the other one attacking him.
