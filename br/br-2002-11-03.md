The fight rages; Andreth and Starguard crowd Berina, after her sneak attack on Andreth's ribs, while Yuri once again finds himself heroically and possibly fatally squaring off against the dangerous Gregorio. Meanwhile, Ash, Karl, and Stormy are making short work of the misshapen runts masquerading as guards.

Andreth, his ribs still aching, is done playing around. His foot whistles through the air with deadly intent, and only a last-minute dodge from Berina spares her from its force.

Yuri, after getting solidly smashed by Gregorio, returns the blow with his rapier, drawing a significant amount of blood.

Karl swings his morningstar, chanting under his breath. His morning star smashes through the creature's head, spraying pulp everywhere, and crashes into a second creature, who falls flat to the ground.

Starguard curses, and fires at Berina, but alerted, the shot goes over her shoulders, thunking into the ground.

Dodging nimbly away from one of the creatures' mad swipes, Ash growls menacingly and charges across the crude floor in the direction of Gregorio. The sound alerts the other, though, and Ash's weapon won't connect - this time.

Stormy yells and swings his quarterstaff again, caving in the side of his opponent's head. "Take that!"

Berina, saving her breath, swings her tied together hands like a club, once again catching Andreth in the ribs. He expels a breath of air, and there's an audible crack.

Eyes intent on the posturing Yuri, Gregorio brings his fists up like mighty piledrivers, driving the second fist into Yuri's abdomen, and possibly even through. Yuri would know, if he wasn't too winded to care.

Focusing on Karlsefnir, two of the remaining creatures swing their morning stars in perfect harmony. Alas, where one strikes a solid blow, the other in a perfect mirror image misses about two feet to the left. Still, the blow leaves karl bleeding from another wound.

Andreth draws a deep breath, focuses through the pain, and his fist lashes out, this time flying straight and true into Berina's gut, earning a pained grunt.

Karl swings his morningstar again, but the creatures are getting wise to him, and manage to dodge out of the way.

Yuri crawls off a bit and fishes out one of Starguard's healing potions. _This is going... badly..._

Starguard fires again, but the chaos of the fight between Berina and Andreth is difficult, and in an effort to make sure he misses Andreth, he also misses Berina, the bolt shooting harmlessly away.

Ash swings wide a few times, his attention diverted to Yuri. "Starguard!" he barks, "Yuri's hurting!" He scowls, pulling his weapon back in a defensive posture with moments to spare.

Berina turns to face Starguard, her eyes glowing wild. Her face looks drawn and stretched, but her fists look as servicably clublike as ever. Still, she only manages to clip Starguard on the shoulder, and his mail cushions the blow.

Stormy turns to assist Karlsefnir, and realizes that if he aims carefully, he can hit both of the things attacking him with burning hands without hurting him. He concentrates, shifting position slightly, and calls out the words of the spell.

Turning to face Ash, Gregorio smiles wolfishly, his fists swinging at the extension of surprisingly long arms to land a painful one-two shot on Ash's ribcage. Once from the left, and then again with feeling from the right. Pity it's not the good kind of feelings.

Andreth sees Starguard grunt in pain as Berina slams a fist into him, and his eyes flare. He bellows, "Leave..." and a fist slams into Berina's side, "him..." a kick flashes out and sends her sprawling to the cave floor, "alone!" he yells, gasping.

Karlsefnir, watching the creatures burn to death in front of him, grunts his approval at Stormy and moves to deal with Gregorio. It's getting crowded in that corner, and Karl's morning star fails to connect.

Yuri feels better after drinking the potion, and realizes that Gregorio isn't aware that he's still conscious. He lines up to stick the point of his rapier neatly through Gregorio's liver, but his shot is spoiled when Gregorio moves, and he misses. _Oh, dammit._

Starguard charges in with his morning star, wanting to keep his spells, and swings at Greg, forcing him to duck down, but Ash's sword is coming up...

The wounded warrior lets out a bestial snarl, his massive blade propelled by muscled arms and fueled by anger - frustration at a situation beyond his comprehension, angry at the harm done to his friends, and ready simply to come to a solution by levelling everyone he does not trust. The sword-swing bites into Gregorio, hard, and comes away stained red.

Stormy tries to find an opening in the melee around Gregorio, but doesn't see one. He moves to guard the unconscious Berina instead, ready to pummel her if she so much as twitches.

Gregorio follows the sword right back in on its back swing. His fists punish Ash for the damage he's done, one hitting him straight on the nose, the other hitting him in the abdomen.

Andreth groans, wincing at the pain in his ribs. "Someone's comin'. I think Fernando musta heard all the commotion. Get behind some cover," he warns Stormy, as he hauls Berina (with at least _some_ care) behind a crate-barricade.

Stormy moves to cover, ready to blast anyone who comes through the doorway.

Yuri finally manages to get his rapier to pierce Gregorio's carcass. "Shoulda paid better attention... we could have done this a lot easier."

Gregorio stumbles, finally fatally pierced. He collapses to his knees, but even as he goes down he's fumbling at his belt, trying to open a pouch.

Starguard notices the hands going for the pouch. "I don't **think** so." Stargaurd's thick boot comes up, smashing into Gregori's jaw, knocking him unconcious.

Yuri pants. "Nice touch, Merciful Brother. Who else is hurt?"

Ash appears to be breathing hard and heavy, and isn't in that great shape.

Andreth turns to his companions. He's looking quite sore, but even more worried. "Guys, we've got more company comin'," he remarks, his slingshot dangling from a hand as he pulls a potion out of his backpack.

Karl leans over Gregorio, tugging at his pouch. Opening it up, he pulls out two potions, and wordlessly hands them to Starguard.

Starguard says, "Andreth, take the potion, I'll see to Ash. Everyone with a Cure Minor, give it to Yuri, and then I'll heal big Karl. Quickly!"

Starguard tosses his remaining 'asprin' to Yuri, and turns to Ash, chanting under his breath.

Ash nods, breathing more easily. His hand, clutched to his chest, falls away and gives a jaunty wave of thanks.

Starguard's hands glow as Ash looks a little better under starlight, then turns to Karl, a worried look on his brow as he uses his last spell until tomorrow.

Yuri drinks the small potion, feeling much better than he did a minute ago, but still pretty awful.

Andreth sighs happily as the potion's healing energies course through him. His breathing is a little labored from his sore ribs, but he's looking a _lot_ better.

Yuri says, "Starguard, those two potions Karl pulled out... are they healing? Can we use them now?"

Starguard ha-has! "Cure lights, by the stars! Praise the Gods and pass the potions." He hands one each to Ash and Yuri.

Yuri doesn't hesitate. He drinks the potion quickly, then motions for everyone to get behind cover.

Ash moves behind cover, following Yuri's example. His face is set in a hard mask as he silently contemplates whatever may be next.

Andreth quietly puts a lead ball into his slingshot, and cocks his ears again, listening carefully.

Yuri drags 'Berina' behind cover and ties her again, ignoring any considerations for freedom of mobility. _She's as strong as an ox. I don't want her getting loose again._

Starguard moves to grab his crossbow before quickly leaping over the barrels, loading and waiting.

Andreth hmms quietly, and leans over to Yuri, whispering. "Whoever it is, they're still some ways off yet... we got time to set up."

Yuri says, "We could try shoving some boxes in front of the entrances."

Andreth nods to Yuri. "Just tell me where you want 'em."

Yuri drags the false Berina behind a pile of barrels near the place where Gregorio was sitting, so he can see both entrances.

As Yuri drags Berina behind the crates, he sees two other lumps, lying on the ground. They're immobile, and thoroughly tied. Also unconscious. Both of them sporting two large lumps on the backs of their heads.

Yuri checks on the condition of the 'lumps'.

The lumps, when unwrapped, appear to be Perf and Jermiah, in all their glory. The cat, when asked to investigate, sniffs carefully and then licks Perf's face clean.

Yuri phews. "We've found our men."

Everyone hunkers down, waiting for the footsteps to manifest. They sound closer and closer, then pause. Slowly, a chanting sound begins.

Starguard acks! "Sleep spell! Brace yourselves!"

Yuri says, "Dammit! Get him!"

Even as Starguard yells, Karlsefnir falls gently to the ground.

Andreth curses, and gives the snoring Karl a emphatic nudge with his foot. Grumbling, he lights a torch, and throws it to the floor near the entrance, to try to shed a little light on the situation.

Karlsefnir rolls over, slowly waking up. His eyes narrow as he grips his morning star more firmly.

Stormy peers down the passageway, trying to decide if the shadowy figure is close enough to reach with the spell. He shifts position, then gestures to the others as he moves forward. When he's close enough, he casts the spell, flinging fire down the tunnel.

Over the crates and down the once-dark confines of the tunnels, Ash and his greatsword race to strike the Burning Man down, his own eyes flashing, his blade catching the yellow glitter of flames and the crimson red of blood.

Starguard holds his fire, aiming, hoping that he gets a clean shot.

Face to face with the maniacal Ash, Fernando pulls his own greatsword up and over his shoulder. But it's still a little hot to the touch, throwing off his aim, so that the sword swings harmlessly past Ash.

Ash lets out a second telling blow, his inarticulate battlecry ricocheting through the tunnel as he strikes and then backs away - clearing the path for more attacks.

As Ash backs out of the way, Andreth spots an opening, and whirls his sling round, sending the lead shot hurtling through the air and whizzing right past Fernando and clattering down the passage beyond.

Stormy frowns as Andreth's shot misses, and concentrates on the spell again. Flames leap out from his hands again as he growls out the arcane words.

Starguard fires off a bolt into the melee, but misses high, heads flinching down a little as the bolt whistles overhead.

Fernando moves forward, a death's head smile on his face. His greatsword sweeps up, and over, and catches Ash on the side, cutting open a nasty slice.

Ash lets himself be cut open, crouched down in the tunnel. Suddenly his blade juts forward, flashing through the air like a tongue of flame as it reflects the lanterns and lights of the cavern. The shimmer of light shining off the blade is marred, bit by bit, by the stream of blood pouring down the length of the greatsword, jutting from Fernando's chest. "No more of your tricks, no more games," murmurs Ash, falling heavily to his knees. "That's right.."

Stormy hurries forward. "Ash, are you all right? That was really brave!"

Yuri says, "That was really effective. I'd like to see the son of a bitch shapeshift his way out of that."

Ash waves a hand slowly, and his attention seems captured by the stain of blood on his fingers. "I'm just fine," he says cheerfully, smiling as he regards his own life's essence on his fingertips and palm.

Andreth puts his slingshot away, and breathes a sigh of relief. "Glad yer on _our_ side, Ash."

Yuri murmurs to Starguard, "See what you can do. I'm going to search some of these barrels. I suggest we figure out what we're going to do with these other two, then work our way backwards, collecting anything of value, and then get out of this hole in the ground."

Starguard looks over at the fallen man, shaking his head. His healing isn't an option, there. Sighing, he moves to get a bucket of water, and takes it over to Berina, beginning to wash her, and bind her more obvious wounds.

Searching the barrels and crates reveals various foodstuffs. Stormy holds the cat's leash as Starguard washes the fallen Berina, and leads it to sniff at Gregorio and Fernando, while he waits. The cat hisses at the two, and when Starguard is finished, the cat hisses at Berina as well. Stormy looks wide-eyed. "That means they're all shapeshifters, right?"

Starguard nods. "Yes. Not really much of a surprise, but it does make me feel better about shooting her in the back."

Andreth nods grimly. "She's gonna wake up in a couple hours..." he observes. "I pulled the punch when I took 'er down."

Yuri says, "That's probably all of them. There were three that came to our camp last night, and three here, and I think we've seen all the inhabited parts of the cavern. Fernando's done for... but we have to decide what we're going to do with the other two."

Starguard says, "Interrogate them, for one thing. And we'll go from there. Finding out what they are would be nice, too."

Once collected, the pile of loot looks very impressive. There are chests with silverware and chests with livery. In Fernando's cave there were two chests filled with fine brocades and silks. And then there was the chest with pouches of coin. Not to mention the chests containing hams, cheeses, and less identifiable foodstuffs, and the two kegs of beer. And then there's the gems and jewellery: a golden necklace with moss green stones, a silvered circlet Fernando was wearing, and a ring on his finger, as well as two blue gems and two yellowish smaller stones. The great sword Fernando used on Ash, of course, and Gregorio's throwing dagger. And the morningstars the guards were using, but those hardly seem worth your while.

Andreth shakes his head. "Why? Seems simple to me. They just rob people, their stuff _and_ their faces too. Leave 'em down here to rot, says I."

Yuri sighs. "The problem is... we leave them down here... they might come back to haunt us."

Starguard says, "We can't just kill them in cold blood. Turning them into the authorities, perhaps?"

Yuri says, "Any other enemy I wouldn't care, but these two can change faces. And they're powerful, which means they're probably not going to be too happy that we turned the tables and robbed them."

Andreth looks troubled, but nod. "Not just us... but other folks too. Look at all this stuff they've got." He scratches his head. "Why'd they leave Perf and Jermiah alive, though?"

Yuri says, "You're right, Andreth."

Ash scowls. "Fine. Whoever wants to guard them can let them live, as far as I'm concerned. But I for one have no problem compensating myself for the trouble they caused us." He gestures to the assembled loot.

Yuri says, "Maybe we should wake up Per and Jermiah and find out."

Starguard says, "Because they were going to bring in others, and copy these two too."

Yuri says, "Oh, we're taking their stuff, Ash. I just want to know what options we have for keeping them out of our hair in the future."

Yuri says, "Because as loathe as I am to kill them in cold blood... they've seriously pissed me off."

Stormy waits until everything has been gathered into one room, and then tells the others, "I can check them for magic if you want. Should I?"

Yuri says, "Yes, Stormy, please do."

Stormy concentrates, murmuring the cantrip to detect the presence of magic. He points out the sword, the circlet, and a ring. "The rest seems to be just ordinary stuff."

Ash begins checking around for bags, boxes and other means to hold the load. _They got it all down here somehow,_ he muses, _and we'd better hurry in getting it back._

Yuri says, "Those silks and clothes are worth a fortune."

Yuri says, "We can get it all, if everyone takes a chest."

Yuri says, "All the stuff that's not food. If we're feeling ambitious we can come back for those, too."

After considering the pile of loot carefully, the decision is made to bring as much as possible. Chests are collected, and laboriously worked through the pit to the cave entrance. From there the rest of the path is all down hill, and though moving everything takes a little extra time, the party has finished moving everything back to camp in time for lunch. The two doppelgangers, still tied up and unconscious, are dumped on the ground where Stormy can keep an eye on them, while Perf and Jermiah are carefully tended by their friends. But other than nasty headaches from the knocks on the heads they sustained, the two young guards are in pretty good condition.

Yuri sees to securing the two shapeshifters as securely as possible, and consults with Tormel about them. "We need something they can't get out of. Any ideas?"

Tormel shakes his head slowly. "Keep them unconscious?"

The party sets off after lunch, Ash now guiding Gerard's wagon. All the wagons are a little heavier now, it seems, with Gerard lying in the back of his, and Perf and Jermiah invited to sit with Masci and Ymbert. The cats range loosely. By night fall that evening the party hasn't reached the next campsite yet, and camp that evening is an impromptu affair. But it's quiet in them that hills, and by pushing on as hard as they can, the party reaches Cairnstoke by nightfall.

Cairnstoke is a busy town, with low earthenwork ramparts running around the outside. Challenged by the guard, the caravan is directed to the ever present caravanserai. This one is a larger than the others, with a tall wall extending from the ramparts. A guard patrols the wall, and there are barns below. And there is another caravan camping there now, preparing to leave for CairnTor in the morning.

Yuri ponders. "What was Gerard's religion? Which temple would he want us to deliver his mortal remains to?"

Yuri gets no response. "Well... which God is the most... umm... generic?"

Andreth spots the crest of Merial on a new-looking building on the way to the town square, and attracts Yuri's attention. "I think we oughta give Gerard a proper funeral..." he says, indicating the temple.

Yuri sees, understands, and nods. "OK. So it will be. Anyone want to come with us for the ceremony? And to speak to the town's leaders?"

Starguard says, "I should. He was under my care." Starguard frowns deeply. He hates losing men.

Yuri nods.

Ash props himself back on the wagon. "I'll see about warning the other caravan, and maybe ask them for news," he volunteers.

Andreth says, "I'll come."

Yuri says, "Ash... I'd like it if you keep an eye on our prisoners, too, until we can arrange to get rid of them. And if they give you any shit... don't bother pulling your punches. We've given them more than enough chances to co-operate. I'm sick of people taking advantage of our goodwill. Next time they give us an excuse, take it."

Ash nods and grins, readying his newly-acquired sword in apparent anticipation.

Yuri says, "OK. The four of us, then." He retrieves the letters from the company wagon, and helps Starguard and Andreth carry the body. Tilara joins as well.

The two doppelgangers remain unremarkably docile, given their lack of consciousness. After inquiring at the gate, Yuri, Andreth, Starguard and Tilara are given directions to both the temple and the town's mayor. They set out first for the temple, since the mayor probably won't receive them at this time of night, and the body is heavy.

Merial's temple is indeed small, and but newly established. It reminds Starguard a little of Father Pesci's temple. As Andreth crosses the doorway, he feels a momentary touch, on his cheek. The scar warms up momentarily. And Starguard, too, feels ... something.

Yuri looks around for someone to talk to.

Starguard blinks, rubbing his head. a little. "Feels like home. This is a place of the Gods."

Yuri looks at Starguard, a little puzzled, but says nothing.

Andreth nods, his hand to his cheek. "Yes..." he whispers softly to Starguard. "Gerard will be safe with the Lady, till his family can come to claim him."

Starguard smiles. "I mean...can't you almost hear Father Pesci about, Yuri? But we're a long way from home." He nods to Andreth solomnly. "We'll leave him here."

Yuri shakes his head. "I thought that all temples were places of the Gods... is this one unusual in some way?"

Yuri continues looking for someone here... a priest, an altar boy, someone.

A fat little priest bustles forward. Seeing the dead Gerard, he directs that the body be placed in the makeshift little morgue. "We'll see him buried with all the rites in the morning, gentlemen. Will you be attending?"

Tilara says, "They're all supposed to be..." She stops as the priest shows up.

Yuri says, "I will. He was under my protection. I think I owe him that."

Andreth nods wordlessly to the priest in assent.

Tilara nods. "I will, as well." She's had two days to recover, but she's still pale from blood loss. "I brushed a little too close with mortality that time, myself."

The priest nods. "We'll be burying him at dawn. Best time of day, really. Well, return here a half hour before Brother Sun rises, and you'll not miss a thing. In the meanwhile, I'll see him prepared."

Starguard says, "This is a new chapel, I see. What donation would be appropriate for such a young man?"

The little priest rubs his hands together. "Tis kind of you to ask. Tis kind, tis kind. We ask you to donate what you can; we use it to support the temple and the people around us."

Starguard turns to Yuri, explaining things. He's got the pocket strings, which are heavy at the moment...

Yuri fishes in his pockets. _We got a lot, from those caves. I think it's the right thing to see that Gerard gets a good burial._ He hands three gold over to the priest. "He was a journeyman merchant. We don't know a lot about him, but he deserves proper honors."

Yuri says, "You don't have to overdo it. Just do it right."

The priest nods. "Aye. And his name?"

Yuri says, "Gerard... Gerard Lupos of Red River Town."

The priest nods, and bustles off, returning after a few moments with a basket of tools. He begins to clean the corpse.

Meanwhile, back at the serai, Ash is chatting with Piotr, the captain of the outbound caravan. The caravan is well guarded, a fact that makes Piotr even happier after Ash's tales. Piotr does manage to mention that there have been damned few inbound caravans coming from anywhere this year. Almost as if they've been vanishing.

The two compare notes on the road, and after standing Ash a few drinks from his own stash, Piotr goes to rally the troops. He has some last minute planning to do. Shrugging, Ash wanders off to commiserate with the caravanserai master, who does indeed confirm that so far this year he's only seen outgoing caravans. And usually there's at least a few small caravans come from CairnTor by now.

There's a cloth merchant, see, in CairnTor. Buys his fabrics late in the year, when prices are low, and sells them in spring, when caravans are still scarce and prices are correspondingly high.

As to the doppelgangers; the mayor has a jail that should hold them for now. They only need to last the night; they'll probably be strung up in the morning. Bandits are not tolerated in these parts. Especially murderin' thievin' bandits.

Come the painfully early morning, the caravan turns out to pay their last respects to Gerard. All three of the other merchant journeymen have come, as has Tormel. The Andvarri, in fact, are the only ones to stay behind. And that to guard the caravan whose value has suddenly increased drastically.

Gerard is buried in a solemn rite that sees his corpse interred in a small cemetery just outside of town. Merial is invoked, and seeing Starguard's presence, the little priest invokes Wilthorwen and Kenilthwen too, so that the Mother and Father Star may guide the young soul to Merial.

Yuri sighs. _You kept your secrets well from us. In part, that let us identify your killers. I hope that they serve you well in the Underworld._

After the funeral, the merchants decamp to ready their wagons. They're eager to press on, now that the scent of profit is strong. At the mayor's house, which is located right on the town square, the party is admitted immediately. Word of the party's exploits has spread, and the mayor is waiting for them. "Come in, come in. Will you join me for breakfast?"

Yuri grins broadly. "That's a very generous offer, yerhonor. Of course we will."

The mayor is an older man, obviously gone to fat, and he's receiving the party in the breakfast room. Along one wall, tables hold large plates with food, still steaming hot. Eggs, kippers, mushrooms, cheese, hams ... there's a whole buffet. And the smell of fresh bread permeates the room.
