When last we left our intrepid party, they were facing a newly risen column, and a single door. A door that has just fallen open, leaving darkness behind. The party's prisoner, Elisandra de Dios de Muertos y Veneno, looks intently at the door, while fidgeting with her bonds.

Tilara reaches through the opening in the column, intending to feel around the edges.

Beyond the door, Tilara can feel normal rock, or so it seems. As she moves closer, she sees a long tunnel, sloping downwards at roughly a 45 degree angle, after first dropping six feet to clear the column.

Tilara says, "Well, here goes nothing." She steps into the opening.

Starguard keeps an eye on Elisandra as he follows cautiously...

Yuri says, "I don't see any stairs down there, Til. Without climbing gear it's going to be a one way trip. Be sure to come back before the spell wears off."

Past the opening, Tilara can easily move through the tunnel, which leaves enough headroom. Those first six feet straight down could be inconvenient, but with her feet as sticky as they are, she encounters nary a problem. Once she reaches the top of the slope, she looks around.

The tunnel, steeply sloping, disappears into shadows, further than Tilara can see.

Starguard calls down. "See anything down there, Tilara?"

Tilara pauses for a moment to let Yuri pass down a candle, and starts down the sloping passageway, moving slowly to keep it from blowing out.

Yuri sits and listens carefully.

The passageway continues in a straight line for about thirty feet, before opening into another much deeper pit.

Ash waits patiently, not making much more sound than breathing. His burning impatience from earlier has faded; he seems almost another man now, calmly remaining still until Til's return.

At the lip of the pit, Tilara spots a hairline crack, almost as though there were some kind of pressure plate right at the very edge.

Tilara looks more closely, carefully checking the floor as she moves closer to the edge. She doesn't want to trip the plate by accident.

After handing Ash one end of the company rope, Yuri carefully braces himself against the steep slope and slowly walks down, down the first pit and then down to the tunnel, until he stops just behind Tilara. Spotting the hairline crack, he bends down, one hand still on the rope, and examines it carefully.

After a few moments of scrutiny he concludes that the hairline crack is part of a trigger of some sort. However, he can't see any other part of the mechanism.

Yuri hmms. "Dunno what this does. It could retract the pillar, or it could do something fiendish. Knowing Jurdah, it's more likely to be irritating than fatal."

Starguard waits impatiently, frowning, wondering what's taking so long...

Yuri says, "We could trip it and see what happens. I don't know if we could possibly disarm it."

Tilara sighs. "I hate depending on a practical joker's sense of fair play. What if it cuts us off from the others?"

Yuri says, "Then you get out first. No sense risking both of us."

Tilara nods and starts back up the slope.

After Tilara makes her way back to the party, Yuri gingerly presses the pressure plate. At first nothing seems to be happening. But as the seconds tick by in ominous silence, Yuri can see that the tunnel is beginning to twist, and shape, as slow waves of rock begin to build up.

Over a time span of about 10 minutes, the waves solidify into rounded steps.

Tilara comes carefully back down the passage as it turns into steps. "This looks like a good thing. What's happened down here at the pit?"

Yuri sighs. "Nothing. It looks like down is the only way to go."

Tilara says, "Irritating. I'm going to have to redo my spell if I'm going to be climbing down pits much longer."

Starguard frowns. "Not like we have a lot of directional options, though."

Yuri says, "I get the feeling we're being tested. And I don't like it. This is getting in the way of our mission and I'm apt to throttle the responsible parties."

Starguard says, "Not to mention if Stormy isn't alive at the end of this."

Yuri crawls back out of the hole. "The stone's re-forming into stairs down to the pit, but there's no other way up, down, or out, so I'm not sure that helps us much. It looks like down is our only choice."

Ash shrugs, and makes for the stairs. He seems fairly intent on walking down, regardless of what anyone else does.

Starguard follows. "Enough waiting around. We're being herded, yes, but it's not like we have a choice in the matter. Other than stay here and starve."

Andreth rubs his chin and peers at Yuri. "It's gonna be hard for alla us to climb down. And what about her?" he asks, indicating Elisandra.

Tilara follows along, getting ready to cast another spider-climb spell. "Let's find out how deep this thing is."

After walking gingerly yet confidently down the stairs, Ash stops at the edge of the second pit and looks down. The pit extends quite far ... father than his light source. It seems to house a slob, based on the amount of dust bunnies and dead insects trapped in the flards of webs ...

Yuri sees Ash walking, and belays the other end of the rope he's holding, swapping roles from bait to anchor.

Ash turns to Yuri. "Gimme rope and light," he directs laconically.

Yuri says, "I guess we turn her loose, then."

Tilara nods. "No choice. She's not been a problem so far."

Yuri passes the rope to Ash, and trades candles for lanterns. "Best we have."

Andreth nods. "Sounds good ta me," he says, moving to untie the prisoner. "Sorry 'bout this, ma'am," he apologizes as he works on the knots.

Ash supplies one end of the rope to his comrades, then securely knots it about himself. "Right, I'm going in," he mumbles.

Elisandra smiles at Andreth, as she flexes her fingers. "No offense taken, I'm sure ..."

Yuri turns to Elisandra. "Well. We're going to trust you. It's not the most prudent thing, but I don't see any way you can make this worse, so we might as well be friends."

Starguard holds the rope, anchoring himself best he can.

Slowly climbing down into the pit, Ash looks around intently. There has to be some other route, doesn't there? One that doesn't descend into ... As he moves down lower, he finds his movements slowed. The webs are both dusty and yet ... very very sticky. Obviously they haven't been fully coated yet.

Yuri crawls back down to the edge of the pit to watch Ash's progress.

Starguard blinks, feeling eyes on him, and looks up... At the same time, Yuri looks up, suddenly.

The pit also extends about 10 feet up, although that wasn't at first obvious: a netting of webs camouflages the darkness above. But there's the glint of ... of something. And when Starguard's eyes drift upwards, something comes falling down. Fresh webbing, it looks like. Aimed directly at Starguard.

The webbing drifts aimlessly by, narrowly missing Ash, before coating the walls of the pit.

Ash climbs as swiftly as he's able up the rope, letting the excess length alone for now - it won't hinder him in these close quarters just yet, and should someone get knocked in.. He greets Andreth very briefly as that worthy assists him to the top, and his hands are already going for his weapon.

Andreth picks up the rope and hauls on it as fast as he can as soon as he hears the cries of alarm. Breathing a sigh of relief as his comrade in arms reappears over the edge of the pit, he reaches to his belt for his sling.

Tilara starts as the fresh webbing slithers down from above. Muttering under her breath, she climbs along the wall to get back to the edge of the pit, then braces herself and spreads her hands upward. A muttered spell, a flash of flame, and the webs burn off revealing a spider ten feet up on the wall of the shaft. "We have company."

Yuri ducks back up the stairs, since there's not enough room for everyone to fight, but he readies his bow anyway.

As the web burns away, and the spider twitches, he looks down at Tilara, before spitting a fresh gob of sticking webbing at her, effectively anchoring her fast to the wall.

Starguard returns fire, bringing up his light crossbow and loosing a bolt. "Bloody bug!"

The bolt digs a groove into the exo-skeleton, but the spider seems barely to notice, not really hurt at all.

Ash draws his blade, unslinging it clumsily in the close quarters. His first attempt to skewer the beast goes awry, as he adjusts to his surroundings, but nevertheless the magic blade connects.

Andreth squeezes in next to Ash and lashes out with a foot against his arachnid foe, but the kick swings wide of the monster's hide.

Tilara swears as the sticky stuff glues her arms to the wall, and tries to shift her feet to push against the wall to get loose, but with no luck.

The spider spits out another glob, aiming it straight at the two fighters in the mouth of the tunnel. And as close as they are together, hitting them is apparently not hard at all, for the web manages to cover both fighters, effectively gluing them to the floor as though attached by super-glue.

Yuri sees half the company is webbed and immobile, and does the only thing he can to keep the fight going... he comes up behind the wall of webbed people, and shoots over their shoulders.

Yuri barely scratches the spider and adds 'things that spit web' to his list of least favorite things, right after 'shapeshifters'.

Starguard tries to use the stairs for cover as he shoots again, another gouge into the thing, a bolt lodging in it's shell.

Andreth writhes and struggles, but can't even twist an arm free of the sticky strands covering him. He calls out, "Yuri! Burn us out of this stuff!"

Tilara realizes that the webbing is stronger than she is, and will not tear easily. She tries to work her hands free of the stuff instead, but doesn't get very far. "Yes, do it! The stuff burns too fast to cause much damage, and I don't think the spider is too happy."

Now ponderously climbing down from the ceiling, the spider perches right over the mouth of the tunnel, front legs and mouth flashing out, trying to suck the blood out of Ash. Only one claw manages to make contact, slashing through the webbing.

Yuri uses his candle to burn the webbing off, saying a small prayer to whatever Gods are listening that this not be a fatal mistake.

With a growl of unrestrained rage, Ash's arms and body burst free of the ignited webbing. The fire seems to only heighten his actions, and his arms drive that great weapon of his straight up into the fiend's belly. He pulls it back after a second, watching the beast fall toward the depths disdainfully.

Tilara grins. "I'd applaud, but I'm still a bit tied up. Very nicely done, Ash."

Andreth brushes burnt bits of webbing off his arms, wincing a little. "Want us to burn you free, Til, or should we cut you out? Burnin's faster, but it does sting a bit."

Ash turns, eyes burning as he notes Tilara's words. The rage leaves him after a moment, and he finally nods, though his sword remains out.

After about 2 seconds, you hear a very solid splat as the spider impacts on something solid.

Starguard moves from the doorway. "Hmm, two seconds, what's that, about a hundred feet or so?"

Yuri moves to a clear area and sits down. "Hard to tell. Long enough to kill someone, I think."

Ash shrugs, already looking upward at the spider's hiding-place. "It's dead," he says absentmindedly, but with conviction. "I'm following it down."

Yuri stands again, and goes looking for Elisandra.

Tilara says, "I'd just as soon have it cut off since we're no longer in a hurry."

Following the spider's trail through the debris, Ash eventually finds himself dangling about seven feet above the bottom of the pit, which is covered in the assorted debris of ages. There's a rusty spear here, and a pointy crown there, and some rags covering something that looks remarkably skeletal.

Looking more closely, Ash sees three tunnels, leading out of the pit, each of them closed by a doorhanging of webbing.

Elisandra sits on the top step of the tunnel, waiting for the furor to die down. She greets Yuri as he finds her, and asks if anyone was hurt.

Ash unties himself, holding onto the rope with one hand to give himself at least a little slack, and drops as agilely as he can into the room. "Hold fast!" he calls up. "I'm looking down here... come down if you want, there's three tunnels."

Andreth scratches his head at the rope. "Who's goin' last?"

Starguard says, "Well, if it's anyone but Til goes last, they won't be able to go down..."

Starguard heads down the rope next, sliding down to the pit.

As everyone else makes their way down to the bottom of the pit, Ash picks through the rubble. Most of what he finds is either worthless, or simply crumbles at his touch. But he does find a few promising pouches holding coins, as well as a single vial holding some kind of potion and a shiny, simple crown.

Starguard hmms, looking at the crown and the potion. "May I look at those, Ash?"

After putting everything else away, Ash holds out the crown. "Yuri, do you recognize this?" Yuri pauses, looking carefully at the crown, but stepping aside so that Starguard can look too.

Ash offers the potion to Starguard, as well, letting each do what they can.

Tilara anchors the rope as the last of her compatriots climb down, then recasts her dweomer and carries it down the wall herself. She arrives at the bottom and watches as Starguard tries to figure out what the potion is.

Ash is meanwhile heading for the tunnels, curious about what might lie down them and leaving identification to his better-trained colleagues.

Starguard hmms, looking at the crown. "It's a ladies' crown. And there's a shield on it... Hmm..." He thinks, trying to remember anything that he might have heard...

Ash notes, correctly, that there are three tunnels. Each of them looks fairly similar: five feet wide, seven feet tall, and otherwise indistinguishable. Although two of them do appear to slope a little, one up, and one down.

Andreth likewise loses interest quickly in curious but mysterious artifacts, and studies the tunnels with Ash. "Up, down, or level?" he muses.

Ash shrugs, then starts whistling tunelessly. He points to the left-most tunnel, then starts walking, cradling his sword in his arms casually.

Walking down the tunnel, lips shaped in a tuneless whistle, Ash follows the tunnel which continues long past the forty feet he is willing to go.

Starguard hmms, handing the crown to Tilara. "You don't have a Detect Magic left kicking around, do you?"

Ash nods to himself, then begins moving back toward the trash pit. He seems intent on nothing more complex than just examining the tunnels, one at a time, until his light goes too far.

Each of the three tunnels is remarkably similar. At least for the first forty feet. The webbing tears away easily from each tunnel mouth, the walls are wholly unmarked and smooth, the floor is flat and easy to walk on. And each of them obviously extends far further, running in what feels like parallel.

Tilara asks, "Anything magical in the garbage?"

Starguard smells the potion gingerly. "I think it's a protection potion of some sort."

Tilara says, "Always useful. Anything else of interest? Or didn't you check yet?"

Andreth blinks at Starguard, and steps forward in alarm as Starguard uncorks the potion. "What the _hell_ are you doin', Starguard?"

Starguard says, "I didn't, Til. Didn't think to ask for one of those potions this morning. And checking the potion. Just smelling it to get a clue."

Andreth deflates a little, his shoulders slumping. "All right, all right. Just so long as you ain't drinkin' it. You don't know where it's been."

Starguard hands the potion to Andreth. "I think it's protection, really. It's likely beneficial."

Ash flags Andreth with one hand, then jerks a thumb toward the left-most tunnel. "Nothing else here," he remarks impatiently, again aflame to move, it seems. "Let's check further in."

Andreth stares at the vial for a moment, then shrugs. "Well, okay. But we shouldn't go round drinkin' it till you're _sure_," he says, stowing it away in a pouch.

Tilara says, "Ah... just a moment." She murmurs the cantrip, and looks at the booty again, magic now giving off a soft glow in her sight. "Hmm. That appears to be it."

Starguard raises an eyebrow. "Not the crown?"

Starguard hmms, and brings out the strange book for Til. "Does this glow?"

Tilara says, "Just the potion. Nice bit of money, though..." She glances at the book. "Like a balefire."

Andreth falls into line behind Ash. "You guys comin'?" he asks, turning back to his companions.

Starguard nods, putting the book away. "I'm coming, I'm coming."

As the company moves down the tunnel they are enveloped in a feeling of serenity. Nobody is trying to kill them. They're merely walking along, enjoying the light breeze and the tang of the salty air ...

After about ten minutes, the breeze begins to really pick up, turning into a stiff wind.

Andreth sniffs the air a little skeptically. "Where's this tunnel go, anyway? And how come it smells o' salt?"

Ash says, "Probably the sea, or something like it."

Starguard says, "In the middle of the continent? How do you think we could get here?"

Tilara says, "I'm wondering how the wind is picking up in a tunnel. Where's it blowing to?" She snickers at Starguard. "Who says we're still in the middle of the continent?"

Ash nods, walking ahead. "We vanished and reappeared, remember? Who knows how far we went."

Starguard huhs.

Eventually the tunnel begins to head up more steeply, before opening out into a wide ledge. Or rather, as everyone looks around, something that looks like the top of a tower. There's a pentagram inscribed in the roof, and all around the tower is a large lake. This must be where the breeze is coming from; there's a stiff wind here, bringing up the smell of salt water. And yet visibility is less than it could be; you're definitely still underground, in some very large cavern.

As Ash looks down, along the edge of the tower, he sees a single window, perhaps twenty feet down. There's an orange glow shining through the window.

Ash points down, then turns his attention to the others. "We can either check this out, or check another tunnel," he says needlessly. "I say we look here. Less walking."

Tilara says, "Can't hurt to check this place before we backtrack..."

Starguard says, "Well, it can hurt, but let's check it out anyway."

Ash nods, then beckons for the rope again. "I'll go, unless somebody else wants to risk their neck."

Starguard grins. "After you, good sir. No-one seems to want me to risk mine."

Andreth, however, volunteers in his place. He is carefully lowered down to the window, and looks inside, where sees a cheerful fire burning, heating a cauldron in which an old man appears to be cooking stew, based on the ingredients he's just adding into the pot. The old man is oblivious, as Andreth peers into the room, which contains 17 bookcases, large piles of scrolls, a small table, and a single pallet. Andreth looks again, non-plussed. No, he doesn't spot a door.

Andreth scratches his head for a moment, then waves to be let up while slowly climbing up the rope. Once back, he describes what he saw.

Starguard blinks. "That's...bizarre."

Ash nods. "Someone to talk to, even if he's hostile, is an improvement."

Starguard looks over at Elisandra for a moment. "For the record, you don't know the way out, do you?"

Andreth nods. "Well, talkin's not what I'm best at. S'posin he takes a dislike to me ugly mug?" He looks around. "Anyone else wanna try?"

Elisandra shakes her head. "I do not know where we are.'

Starguard hmms, and turns away, pulling out the black book. Turning away from the party, he begins to write questions, hoping to get an answer.

After Starguard carefully writes his questions, he turns the page, curiously reading. "How many roads to Babylon? Three score and ten. Can I get there by candle light? Yes and back again ..."

Starguard reads aloud. "Now what does that have to do with anything, you suppose? Candlelight..."

Yuri says, "Well, I'll just nip down and introduce myself, then. Nice old man, living out in the middle of nowhere like this, must have an awful lot to talk about."

Ash fidgets with his weapon. "He may not like my way of talking," the warrior explains with a cold fire in his eyes.

Yuri says, "That's alright. He doesn't have to know how many of us there are, yet."

Andreth says, "He din't seem ta notice me, though o'course he mighta been pretendin' not to."

Now Yuri, in turn, shinnies down the tower's wall, before perching just above the window. He smiles, disarmingly, when he gets the old man's attention. And the old man, in turn, raises on eyebrow and waggles a few fingers at the window, causing it to swing open slowly.

Yuri speaks in the trade tongue of the Empire. "Good afternoon, good sir. I am a traveller, and I seem to be lost. Might you be able to tell me where I am?"

The old man tilts his head, waiting for something. Finally he shrugs, and Yuri feels a strong tugging on his clothes, pulling him into the room.

Yuri says, "Oh... umm... well, alright then. I'll come inside." He allows himself to be pulled inside.

The old man stands, watching, utterly immobile.

Meanwhile, on top of the tower, Andreth watches Yuri disappear into the window, and rubs his chin worriedly. "Think someone else oughta climb down n' listen?"

Ash thinks a moment, then nods to Andreth. "Send Elisandra down," he suggests.

Andreth blinks in mild surprise, then glances at Elisandra questioningly, wordlessly asking what she thinks of this plan.

Yuri says, "I'm not alone. I don't know what you're waiting for..." He points back up towards the tunnel. "We came from the spider's lair, and from the maze beyond that. We're looking for a lost friend, a mage with red hair."

Elisandra nods, stepping forward, after licking her lips nervously. Moments later she, too, climbs in through the window and says hello to the old man, who remains immobile. She tries again, speaking a few words in several other languages, but to no effect.

Yuri fishes around in his pockets, looking for a scrap of red cloth, or anything red.

The old man's eyes twinkle, as he gravely observes the scrap of red that Yuri is showing him. His expression gentles a little, as he tilts his head sideways, but beyond that there's no reaction.

Yuri says, "We had to solve a puzzle to get here; it involved the color red. Cerise, rouge, solferino, gules?"

The old man waits, patiently ...

Yuri tries the same phrase in every language he knows - Trade, Maran, A-isian, and finally Lurinese. "I am Yuri, and we seek a Red Mage."

The old man waits, patiently ...

Yuri sighs, and rubs his forehead, like he saw the Andvarri do. "Well, at least you're not trying to kill us. But I sure wish you'd say something. It's not every damn day that you have your mage snatched, get teleported across a continent, dumped in one of Jurdah's damn puzzle-boxes. You'd think someone living in such an out-of-the-way place would react more to strangers."

One eyebrow raises approximately one sixteenth of an inch at the mention of Jurdah's name.

Yuri stands for a second, no particular expression on his face. "Umm... please?"

The old man waits, patiently ...

Yuri leans out the window and shouts up, "Guys? He's not talking. I could try telling him our story, if you want to wait."

Elisandra watches the old man watching them, then moves towards a bookcase. He shakes his head, once, a bare two inches. She stops.

Andreth leans over the edge, and calls out, "Go for it!" He then moves to help Starguard support Ash on the rope.

Ash follows his way down the rope, then slips into the room..

Yuri sits down on the floor, and gathers his breath, and tells the story of the White Company, as it has been told to the Emperor.

The old man waits, patiently, as Yuri talks.

Ash thumps Yuri on the shoulder as he arrives, hoping for a more expedient approach. "mind if I...?" he asks.

Yuri finishes the story with an addendum about pursuing Samaela for the Emperor, and getting sidetracked by Firestorm's abduction.

Yuri sighs. "Guy's a mystery, Ash. If you've got any other ideas that don't involve bloodletting, fire away."

The old man waits, patiently, as Yuri talks, and then turns to look at Ash when the silence returns.

Ash squats on the floor, then, making sure his sword is out of the way. He begins to sketch with his fingers, diagramming a pentacle, then letting his finger lift off the stone floor and land in another spot. He boxes out five rooms, and a few numbers, gesturing slowly. "Jurdah's labyrinth," he says aloud, looking up at the old man.

The old man leans over the diagram, then smiles, offering Ash a piece of chalk.

Yuri raises an eyebrow a bare 16th of an inch at the mention of Jurdah's Labyrinth.

Ash begins sketching out the labyrinth as he remembers it, although the complex geometry eludes his crude art skills. He finishes with a rather good pit, three tunnels, and an illustration of the tower they are now in at the end of one.

The old man smiles, fingers twitching, and an orange window appears in the illustration of the tower. Inside, four figures appear to be moving in the glow of a warm fire.

Ash nods in agreement. For the next step he takes a crack at something more abstract, drawing a doorway surmounted by sunshine well away from his other work. He points at it, once, then looks up at the old man.

The old man smiles, and one hand sketches a complex rune in the air. Soon a small three dimensional arch stands over Ash's sketched arch.

Ash nods once and smiles. Finally, he begins to work out something that (he hopes) resembles the party's younger mage. He doesn't bother with facial details, concentrating only on obvious details or accessories.

The old man holds up one hand, suggesting Ash should pause, and then motions him closer.

Ash nods, and approaches willingly. If death comes next, so be it - what could be tried has been, and he's feeling brave.

The old man places his fore and middle finger on Ash's forehead, and closes his eyes. A feeling of warmth spreads from the fingers, healing Ash's wounds and pulsing behind his eyeballs. There's something ancient about this touch.

Ash blinks and pulls back. Perhaps the old man misunderstood, or maybe this is merely a part of this strange process. Nevertheless he persists, pointing down at the chalk sketch and saying the boy's name - "Firestorm". He waits, unsure of what to try next.

The old man steps back and snaps his fingers. A mirror appears in his hand, and in it Ash and Yuri, and Elisandra, can see Stormy, half asleep, tied to a chair.

Yuri says, "Yes, that's him..."

Ash nods quickly, hoping his recognition shows clearly on his face.

Yuri points at the parts of the map, and at the image of Firestorm, waiting to see if the mage reacts to any particular part. "Is he in any of these places?"

The old man hands the mirror to Ash, inclining his head, and raises an eyebrow. Then he resumes his waiting pose, arms held perfectly relaxed.

Ash kneels down once again, sketching another door on the ground, along with six figures, one bearing a greatsword. He points to the door, then to the mirror, and waits patiently.

The old man looks at the mirror, and then at the six people. And then he looks at Ash again, eyes half closed. Finally he shrugs, and waves his hands. Above, on the roof, the pentagram begins to glow.

Andreth looks around in growing worry at the light coming from the lines, and calls down, sounding agitated. "Hey! It's starting to glow up here! What'd he just do?"

Tilara steps back, startled as the pentagram starts to glow. "Yikes!" She leans over the parapet. "What's going on down there?"

Ash leans out the window, to yell up. "We're moving out shortly," he explains, then looks back in, pondering one last order of business..

Ash retrieves a handful of gold coins from the pouch he still carries, then offers two hands. In one is almost 20 coins, in the other is the entire pouch. Whether the gift will be accepted or merely appreciated remains to be seen, but the man has to see.

The old man gestures at the window, almost shooing the three youngsters out. He does not appear to notice the gold at all.

Ash nods and piles the gold back into the pouch, wasting no time. Privacy outweighs the worth of gold here, and if that gift is what can be given in return for service, Ash is willing to give it in full.

The old man waits, patiently.

Elisandra, watching, smiles, and quickly climbs up the rope.

Yuri says, "Think it's time to go."

Meanwhile, on the roof, a glowing golden arch has formed, with a burning vortex of bright white light in the center. The arch stands six feet tall, easily tall enough for any member of the party to pass through.

Andreth feels the weight on the line as the parley team climbs back up, and gives Elisandra a brief nod as she reappears over the ledge. "What happened down there?" he asks, and glances at the arch.

Starguard looks up. "Is that our exit? The way to Stormy?"

Tilara glances back as Elisandra comes over the parapet. "What he said. This thing activated just now."

Ash nods as he climbs up, turning to Yuri. "Not everyone hears so well," he explains. "So sometimes you need to try something beyond speech." He points ahead to the portal. "Stormy... should be somewhere past there."

Tilara says, "Let's give it a shot, then."

Yuri pauses at the rope, and turns back. "Someday we're going to find out who you are, and we're going to kick ourselves for not realizing it before. No matter. Perhaps someday we'll repay the favor, or perhaps we already do." He sketches three crossed lines, making a six-pointed asterisk, on the wall with his finger, and then encircles it with the shape of a kite shield. "Let this be our sign, if you need one to make to us."

Yuri makes his way up the rope.

The old man looks, curiously, at the sign, which is suddenly carved into the wall.

Yuri startles at the mark on the wall, but says nothing further as he climbs out.

Ash doesn't wait long, and is satisfied with Yuri's appearance as a sign that the party is, for the moment, intact. He passes through the arch, unwilling to wait much longer for whatever destiny awaits him.

After passing through the arch, Ash finds himself in a dark room; the arch behind him is the only source of light, but provides enough light to show him Stormy, who is sagging against his bonds, tied as Stormy is to a chair. There's a faint snore, emanating from Stormy's mouth.

Andreth begins, "So, what happened down th-" then stops when Ash walks through the arch. "Guess we'll haveta talk bout it later. Let's go," he says, following behind Ash.

Yuri says, "Yes. He's got the right idea. We're not in danger here, but we still shouldn't stay longer than we have to."

Finally the entire party has passed through the arch, which collapses shut behind them.
