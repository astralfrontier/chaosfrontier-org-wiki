Slowly Brother Sun comes to the end of his day's journey, and the sky begins to dim. A slight breeze sweeps across the promontory, and Keorn turns back to the party. "We'll skip the fire, tonight, I think." He smiles wryly. "I carry no firewood."

Starguard nods. "Besides which, no need to make us easier to find than necessary, this close. Cold rations tonight, people."

"Fair enough," grunts Ash. "Keorn, if you have a few minutes, I have some questions. And the more informed we are, the more apt we are to stay out of your hair."

Stormy stands by the horses, who are all huddled together. After a moment he starts removing saddles, and tack, and putting halters on. After offering each of them a portion of grain, he turns to the circle of people, listening carefully.

Keorn smiles drily. "Ask. You have been accepted as my Companions."

Ash smiles, and bows deeply to offer mute gratitude for this unexpected pronouncement. "We were told by Jarnen and Tiornel, the mercenaries I told you about yesterday, that the children of Samaela would have someone called 'Hawk' as their grandfather. What can you tell us about this, and especially this - is it significant that there is also a \`Hawk Clan' of Changers?"

Keorn hmmms. "That's ... ancient history. Our forefather, Samaela's father, was the first Changer. He could change into the shape of a hawk at will and was named for that ability. Unlike us, he could change as soon as he was born. The other Changer tribes ... were born of Samaela. She gave birth to four daughters; each was the Mother of one of the tribes." He chuckles wrily. "The hawks hold themselves higher, for the age of their clan will always exceed ours.

Tilara says, "Ah. So it's figurative, not literal, then."

Keorn nods. "Yes, and no. Samaela is the ... " He pauses, looking for the right word. "The reincarnation of the first Samaela. The ClanKeepers consider them one and the same, in a sense. Their children are considered blessed."

Tilara sits up at that. "Truly? How is this possible?"

Keorn raises a shoulder at Tilara. "I ... don't know. Samaela is always a descendant of Samaela; when the portents are right, the ClanKeepers declare who she is. Usually just in time to start preparing her for the Courtship. She's usually caught as much off guard as the rest of us."

Tilara says, "Ah. She doesn't remember her previous lives, then? Or not when she's a child, at least?"

Keorn nods. "Not when she's a child. When she's older ..." He shrugs again. "We have not had a Samaela in my lifetime. I do not know. But ... do broodmares need memories?"

Starguard snorts. "Broodmares? Something tells me that your odds of being the one of four just dropped a little..."

Tilara frowns at that comment. "Brood mares?" Mirra stalks back to her mistress, somehow disdainful.

"Who carries the knives then?" asks Ash, resuming his thread of interrogative. "Is the choice a matter of family decision, as though they were heirlooms? Or is it the business of all the Changers of a particular shape, or even all of 'em at once?"

Keorn looks around the circle, pondering the order in which to answer the questions. "If I win, Starguard, I abandon my foster sister, so that I can mate with a woman I've never met, to produce children who will belong to the entire tribe. As for the dagger, Ash ... it chose me. When the previous Wolf was getting old, and worn, we were all called for a Circling at the Hall. I made the mistake of winning the contest."

Ash nods slowly. "Would a missing dagger need to choose its bearer likewise? Or could someone strong of will or lore force it to submit to them?"

"Well ... forcing it won't work. But it must choose from the changers present at the Circling. If there are few Changers, I imagine its choice will be rather restricted. I don't know that the dagger can refuse the Bonding." He bites his lip. "I rather hope it can."

Ash nods slowly. "I see." He withdraws into silence for a few moments, thoughfully considering the options..

Tilara says, "What's the minimum needed for this ... Circling? Can a single Changer perform the ceremony to force a choice?"

Starguard huhs to Keorn. "Before you pass the dagger to someone else, make sure you see who holds the other three. And consider carefully who you'd pass it to. If you can."

Starguard chuckles. "Granted, you wishes might change considerably once you meet. I've seen many a young soldier..."

Keorn shakes his head at Starguard. "I don't choose the next carrier. The dagger sets the contest, and the ClanKeepers oversee it. And the poor saps often don't know what they're competing for." He looks at Tilara. "You must have at least one ClanKeeper; he decides if the Circle is complete. If he accepts a Circle with one Changer in it ..."

Tilara nods. "And the Clankeeper is not part of the Circle, I assume? So it would take at least two..."

"One more question," breaks in Ash, quickly. "Will the Wolf Dagger, for example, only accept Wolf Clan Changers?"

Keorn looks at Ash. "I don't know. It accepts only people who are in the Circle, but the ClanKeeper is the gatekeeper of the Circle ..."

Ash blinks for a moment. "Circle... I need to call the Abbot," he announces, then rises and makes for where the crystal and wand are kept.

Tilara nods. "This is important new data."

Andreth looks up briefly from his musing. "Think he's still up?"

"He'll be up for this," says Ash absentmindedly.

The swordsman invokes the crystal's power reverently, somewhat away from Keorn and his fellows. After a time he begins relaying in low tones the briefest sketch of the latest information and surmises he can, without losing detail. He follows with a request: "Berina maintained a school in Citadel, it was said. Observation of it for presence of feather-portal magic or unusual absense may be sensible."

The request is acknowledged, and will be forwarded to the emperor via their speediest messenger.

Keorn watches curiously. "Berina's school? Where does that come in?"

Tilara says, "We don't know. But she seems to have had custody of the missing dagger for a while."

"Ferg was connected to Berina in some fashion," explains Ash. "And if she were coming and going from Citadel via obscure and arcane means, I can think of no better place to be doing so than an institution she controls."

Keorn looks surprised. "Ah ... " Then he stops, dead. "Do you have a way of getting news to the emperor fast?"

Andreth gestures to the crystal ball. "That's what we got..."

Keorn looks at the ball. "Call the abbott back. Tell him to send as many pigeons as he can. Zamua ... was hired from her school."

Ash does so.

After the message has been passed on, and received with a firm promise to send that news to the emperor **immediately**, the crystal dims once more. Keorn bites his lip, and looks around the party. If the hawks return, as Illath hinted he would ... will one of you consent to be carried back to Citadel?"

Keorn looks around the circle. "If the ClanKeepers are running true to form we have a little time yet to wait. Any other questions?"

Ash shakes his head. "This has been very informative, actually," he replies quietly. "I guess at this point, we wait and see."

Starguard says, "Yes. If it comes down between someone who is bad to lead the Changers and yourself, Keorn, will you fight for the position?"

Tilara looks to Keorn, very interested in his answer.

Keorn pauses a moment, caught by the question. "I will. Will you?"

Starguard says, "I will. I've had enough of fighting. Too many to heal."

Ash looks around at those assembled, then levelly gazes back at Keorn. "Our loyalties lie with the Emperor. And you bear his trust. I at least will fight."

Andreth straightens up. "We been warned not to mess with the Courtship. But outside o' that... yes."

Starguard shrugs. "Of course we can't disobey the word of the Emperor. But inside that..."

Tilara chuckles. "The needs of the Empire outweigh the needs of the few. I think any of us would, though I obviously cannot participate. Let's hope it doesn't come to that."

Keorn nods slowly, looking at each of you in turn. "Yuri will return to Citadel; I will bring as my companions a healer, a noble, a lady, a man twice born, and a boy. These are ... good Companions." He chuckles a moment, looking at Andreth. "Twice born; the emperor knew, when he sent you, that you might be accepted as my Companions. You're not meddling any more; you're part of it now."

Stormy looks worried, biting his lip, and bridles when he finishes counting out the roles. He nudges Tilara. "I'm too old to be a boy."

Tilara ruffles Stormy's hair. "S'okay, it's just an allegory. I'm no lady, for that matter. And I'm not sure how Ash fits the 'noble' category, either."

Ash shrugs a little. "I inherited the title of \`you brainless fool' from my father, who got it from HIS father," he grins.

Starguard chuckles. "No one questions my role, I note. Anyway, we should sleep."

"A title, Ash, is what you make of it. These were the titles the Emperor gave me, for you." Keorn smiles whimsically, watching the skies. "I don't think, Starguard, we should plan on sleeping very long. Why don't you sleep; I'll keep watch."

Tilara says, "Hmm. That does seem to fit some of 'em, from what we saw in the Citadel." She grins at Starguard. "No need - nor Andreth's."

Tilara pauses in the act of spreading her bedroll. "_Do_ you sleep, Keorn?"

Starguard smiles at Keorn. "When he can, I wager."

Keorn nods at Tilara. "Yes. When time permits. But you, I wager, need sleep more than I do. The first tests will be borne by you, and not by me."

Tilara pauses again. "Oh, now _that_ sounds encouraging."

Starguard says, "Sounds like a reason to sleep. And I suspect if Keorn had more information, he'd have given it to us."

Andreth grins. "His Lordship never said it was gonna be easy," he comments to Tilara as he unfurls his bedroll.

Keorn smiles at Tilara. "Yes, it does, doesn't it. And the Emperor choose _you_." He sighs.

With the round of questions over, the party communally beds down for sleep.

Shortly after midnight, Keorn moves between the bedrolls, shaking everyone awake. "We have company." Six forms stand in the darkness, on the cliff's edge. Five appear to be human. One is the largest hawk anyone has ever seen. Keorn turns to Yuri. "You will be carried by a ClanKeeper. You should be in Citadel by nightfall. Tell the emperor that his plans have come to fruition, and you were accepted. Tell him I think he's a fool. Tell him to investigate Zamua; he should have known where she used to work. Tell him to watch the man who recommended her. And tell him the dagger remains missing." He hands Yuri his bedroll. "The ClanKeeper waits."

Stepping forward hesitantly, Yuri approaches the hawk, who mantles, flapping his wings. There's a harness, hanging from the hawk's chest, and the five humans step forward, efficiently strabbing Yuri in. Then the hawk flings himself off the cliff, using the air currents to eventually gain altitude. Soon, he and Yuri both are gone from sight.

Then the five humans step forward, and one chants under his breath, causing a light to appear in his palm. "These are the chosen ones, Keorn?" On Keorn's nod, the man looks each of you in the face. "You have been chosen. Do you accept the choice, knowing what it entails?"

Starguard says, "We do not know what it entails."

The man smiles, wryly. "Most companions don't. Otherwise ... they would not be here." He looks around at the group. "It is this. Keorn will compete for Samaela's hand. His first test is leadership. He brings together a group of people, who are his Companions. They will carry his dagger for three days, from here to the Hall. If they - or rather, you - fail, then he shall enter the ritual as a corpse." The man, or rather Illath, as you can see now, smiles widely. "And we will guard him while you travel. We have set the tests."

Keorn sighs, pulling out the dagger, and placing it in front of the Company. "And your first test ... is choosing who will carry the dagger."

Ash turns and looks at Andreth, almost immediately.

Stormy looks at the dagger and shudders.

Andreth rubs his chin for a moment, and then feels Ash's eyes on him. He raises an eyebrow and gives a half-smile.

Illath looks at the party. "Keorn, as always, is too eager. First, you must accept. _Then_ you can face the first test."

Starguard nods to Ash, letting him speak for the party.

Tilara gives a sharp glance to Keorn, but nods formally. "I accept it." _And we're going to have a loooong talk afterward, aren't we?_

Ash turns his eyes back to Keorn for a moment, then studies the faces of each of his companions, nodding slowly to each and watching their reactions. He faces Illath. "Yeah, it's us or nothing," he says, stating a simple truth. "Andreth is my choice to carry the dagger, and if he declines, I'll bear it." He turns to face the young monk, explaining. "You're probably the best of any of us at defending yourself, come what may. And you've got history with the Clan, however red-stained it may be. If you'd rather not, I'll take it."

Andreth bows to Illath. "I accept the challenge." He then nods to Ash. "And the dagger, as well."

Keorn nods. "A good choice." He smiles at Illath. "And so, I have passed my first test; I have gathered companions who will carry the dagger, and who are willing to die for me." He smiles ironically. "And I am honoured that the Hawks will test the Wolves."

Illath steps forward. "We will carry the Companions to their first test. We will leave you the horses, Keorn. That's nice horse flesh. Looks tasty." He licks his lips, then turns to the Companions. "You have ... this light to pack. When it goes out, we will take you. Choose wisely, and travel light. Carry too much, and we will have to drop you." The other four move forward. "I will carry the dagger's bearer myself. You may ask us what you will; the test requires that we answer honestly."

Ash ponders for a moment. "First. Who was Hawk, that witnessed Lifall's death, as I am told happened, and what is his relation to the Hawk Clan?"

Ash's bearer grins. "Hawk was our Father, first of the Changers, child of Celidan and Luriel, when she did entrap him and catch his seed. Named Far Seer at first, he is now simply the Hawk."

Starguard says, "How much can you carry comfortably? I weigh nearly 200 lbs. on my own..."

Starguard's bearer smiles. "I was chosen for strength; I can carry you, and I can carry your mail. Or I can carry your healing supplies and your weapons."

Tilara says, "How long are we going to be on this trial?"

Tilara's bearer smiles. "Three days."

Starguard sighs. "Leave the 'kit. Keeping me upright to use my spells is more important, I think."

Ash thinks a moment, then comes up with his next question. "What is the relationship between the Changers and the Stormwinders, if any?"

Ash's bearer grins. "Luriel dislikes his son; he visits the sins of the mother on the son, and the son's sons."

Tilara nods. "Fair enough..." She rummages through her pack, sorting out three days of food and changes into her warmest clothing. The rest of her gear she packs up and puts on her horse. "Keorn, you'll be leading the horses out, I assume?"

Keorn nods at Tilara. "Of course."

Andreth fishes the healer's kit from his pack. "I agree. I've seen ye work near miracles without this, Starguard - I think we can survive a few days wi'out it," he says, as he hands it over to Keorn.

Ash asks again. "What dangers are we likely to face?"

Ash's bearer looks at the pile of equipment Ash is proposing to take with him, and sighs. "You will slip out of my hands when we are but halfway there ..."

Illath looks up, and grins. "The dangers will all be natural. You will face the living, and the dead, and the forces that do not care. You will learn the perils of flying, and the safety of falling."

Tilara chuckles at Ash. "Falling appears to be high on the list. Take your favorites - I'm taking the half-spear and the crossbow, and leaving the rest of mine."

Illath looks around. "And for the first test, you will learn the perils of flying and the safety of falling." He motions over the edge of the cliff. "In the meadow, there is a hut. In the hut, there is an old man. Gain, from him, your music."

Ash nods. "Okay then.."

The light begins to dim a little. "You have but a few minutes; have you packed all you care to carry?"

Keorn looks on, face set, watching the party cautiously. His lips are sealed now; his was the choosing, so he can't offer any further hints.

Tilara says, "How ... cryptic. I'm set. Mirra, come here." The cat leaps into her arms, and she settles her familiar on her shoulder.

Starguard huhs. "The meadow is down there..." He points down the cliff face. Do we have that much time?

Andreth blinks, and looks over the cliff. "The meadow, you say? That down there?"

Starguard's bearer looks at him. "Time? You have until night falls to reach the meadow, and get the music." He nods back at Andreth. "Yes; we carry you to the base of the cliff."

Andreth cracks a bit of a smile again. "Tilara? How many spiders you got?"

Tilara says, "Enough, if need be. They're really not bad, it's the pitch that tastes nasty."

Starguard packs quickly, rolling up the company's sleeping gear, cooking stuffs, everything other than weapons and armor, really. "Hurry up, folks. We don't have much time."

Andreth glances at the cliff. "Well, I think I'll take my chances with good Illath, but some of us..." he says, nodding toward Starguard and Ash, "may want to take a different way."

Starguard hmms, holding his weapons, wearing his chain and clothes. "Still a lot of weight..."

Ash directs a question at the carriers. "Will you need to carry us any further than the base of the cliff, to complete the trials?"

Illath shakes his head. "No."

Starguard says, "So it would be wise to 'fall' then."

Illath grins at Starguard. "By all means, jump."

Ash ropes Starguard into assisting him, knotting together the supply of rope the party has. Armor, weapons (sheathed of course) and other essentials are quickly dumped into a spare blanket, which itself is knotted and tied. "Better go down first, Andreth," suggests the warrior as he works. "We'll be right after you.."

Andreth nods to Ash. "Good luck," he says, then nods to Illath. "I'm ready."

Illath steps forward, his form shimmering. Soon, a huge hawk awaits Andreth's attention. In one foot, the hawk holds a strap, for Andreth to hold. No safe harness for him.

Andreth grasps the strap firmly with both hands.

Illath jumps off the cliff, dragging Andreth with him. Wide wings flap, creating a strong downdraft, and the hawk descends in slow circles, riding the winds. Eventually, when Andreth can see the bushes below him, the hawk opens it's foot and lets go of the strap. Andreth plummets the remaining ten feet or so and finds himself in a bramblebush. The cliff is less than 20 yards away.

Meanwhile, the gear is quickly lowered to the base of the cliff far below.

Andreth scrambles out of the bushes as best he can, and heads for the edge of the cliff, to protect the gear until his companions arrive to reclaim it.

The other hawks now transform, each holding out a strap. Stormy grasps his, palefaced, and is dragged off the cliff. He, too, lands in a bramble bush. The cliff face is less than thirty yards away.

Ash follows suit, armed and equipped with nothing more than his alleged wits, and the clothes on his back.

Heading straight for the cliff, it takes Andreth some time to find the gear. While he was deposited close to the cliff's face, he was apparently deposited somewhat off course.

In turn, each of the others grasps a strap. Tilara is swung down easily, light as she is. The hawks carrying Ash and Starguard, even though they're the largest, are obviously having more trouble. They flap they wings, rather than merely soaring, and even so, they drop both men at a height of about twenty feet.

Andreth waits by the gear, hoping everyone will find him. Slowly, the party reassembles, at the edge of the cliff. Most of them are scratched up by the brambles; the hawks apparently took great and sadistic pleasure dropping each of you in a bramble patch.

As the company assembles, you hear the barking of wild dogs ...

Tilara arrives, still picking brambles out of her hair. "Somehow, I think they did that on purpose. Now what?"

Ash replies, "now we move, doubletime. Starguard and I will suit up. Can you three head forward, and yell if you need anything?"

Andreth says, "Maybe we best wait till you suit up. No point getting separated."

Tilara nods. "Got it. You don't suppose the dogs are this fellow's musicians, do you?"

Stormy rearms himself, carefully, and looks around worriedly, before turning to Ash to see what way to go.

Starguard suits up, ready to go. "Let's move folks. We've got a long way to go, and a time limit."

Ash says, "'in the meadow is a hut'. We split five ways, with the people on the ends andin the center carrying our light sources. Shutter and re-open your lanterns when you find something, or if you need help." He points in the direction the sound of dogs came from. "Centered there. Let's get armored up and begin as quick as we can."

The party slowly moves out, lights bobbing up and down uncertainly as people move through and around the bushes. Someone seems to have planted a lot of brambles here. Later in the season there's going to be a berrying party, to be sure. As the night passes, people slowly make their way further into the meadow; once the first few hundred yards or so have passed, the bushes fade away leaving only grass.

The barking of the dogs has faded, and as the Mother Star appears in the night sky, her light above is rivaled by a light appearing in what might be a window.

Converging on the light, the party reaches a small hut as Brother Sun begins to ascend the sky. In the growing light, the party can see that the hut is small, with but a single window, and a door. And a small path leading away across the meadow. Two dogs sleep in front of the door, under an overhanging eave. A third stands, watching the party.

"We're here in connection with the Trials," calls out Ash forcefully, trusting this to either provide results or spark a fight. Either way, he'll be well satisfied.

The other two dogs wake, and all three begin to bark.

Inside the hut, something is moving. And then the door opens, to show a figure dressed all in old worn rags, its face covered. "Trials?"

Ash steps forward. "We were told to seek music here," he explains carefully, uncertain as of yet how to approach this situation.

The figure nods, and then a chuckle issues forth from under its face covering. "Music. Ye come seeking music. Do ye not know what the music is?"

Ash hmms. "We're willing to learn, but we haven't much time."

The figure nods. "Come; I have breakfast on the fire. Enter and be welcome." From inside, the scent of fresh porridge, liberally spiced with berries and other spices, wafts out.

Tilara says, "Somehow, they left out that little detail." She sniffs. "It does smell good."

Starguard says, "The music... I've heard a story about that..."

Starguard says, "Of how the music of people's lives are recorded in the Book of the Dead..."

The man looks intently at Starguard. "Ah; ye _do_ know what the music is, then."

Ash steps in, nodding politely in silent thanks. "Speak on, Brother?"

Andreth's eyes widen. "Is that the music we've been sent for?"

The man turns to Andreth. "These are the tunes ... I play."

Starguard says, "The question becomes, then, who's music do we need?"

Ash says, "Ours. Or the music of one of us. Preferably someone who's died."

The man turns to Ash. "Yes. I cannot play the life of the living. The song is not yet finished."

Tilara almost glances at Andreth. _I wonder..._

Starguard says, "We were told to gain, from you, our music. Do you know what that might mean?"

The man shrugs. "If one of you is dead, I can teach you his - or her - song." He bows to Tilara, as he shares out bowls of porridge. "Or I can teach the songs of the ancients. But there is danger in that."

Andreth rubs his chin. "What of one who has died and lives again? Would there be a song for his first death, or only for the second?"

The man looks up. "I haven't been asked that question before." He ponders, pulling out an old, worn flute, and running a questioning rill up it. "I think ... I think there would be a song for his first life, but I am not certain of the second."

The man shrugs. "But what man lives twice?"

Andreth closes his eyes. A feeling of apprehension washes over him for a moment - to hear one's own past life played... He straightens again and addresses the figure. "I am such a man," he says, revealing the scar at his throat. "My second life is not yet over, but we will hear the first... if we can."

Tilara chuckles wryly, but waits for Andreth to speak.

The man blinks. Then he nods. "First; we shall eat. Then, young man, you and I will go outside, and under the light of the Brother, I shall play your music." He smiles. "And then we will see if the gods will punish us for our daring."

The porridge is amazingly tasty, and disappears rapidly. And then the man leads his way outside, and down into a small dell where a lady sits, watching a bitch giving birth.

Andreth follows behind the man and his flute, as he was told...

She watches you approach out of the corner of her eyes, but refuses to make eye contact.

The man sits down, pulling out his flute, and smiles at the woman. "He's safe. Already dead. Just doesn't know it yet." She looks up, and tilts her head. "Welcome. Rialna is giving birth today. We will have puppies weaned in six weeks." Then she turns away, ignoring everyone once more.

Soon the flute begins to emit a melody. Sad, melancholy, and harsh, it begins with a moment of terror, blood flowing, metal swinging, harsh calls of anger and of pain. Then a long passage of haunting hunger, and cold, and loneliness. Finally, a moment of sheer terror which leads into a quiet passage of peace. Now, the music begins to build, becoming strong and more powerful and more at peace at the same time, reaching a crescendo as the music is intertwined around tunes suggesting others. Then, suddenly, a cry, a growl, and the music stops, midnote.

Tilara watches the byplay curiously, then sidles over to Starguard and murmurs to him, "Who _are_ these people?"

The man watches Andreth intently, after lowering his flute back to his lap. "You have an interesting melody." He smiles wryly. "And now you know your song, oddling man."

Starguard whispers back. "Priests of Merial, I believe."

Andreth trembles at the notes... especially the early part of the song, as it evokes memories he'd barely known he had, and the nearly-forgotten harsh life of the Middens. At length, finally he nods, catching his breath. "Indeed," he says, his voice quavering a little.

Tilara twitches an eyebrow. "Priests?"

Ash rubs his chin thoughtfully, silent as stone and mindful of the music that emanates from his friend's soul by way of the flute.

Starguard shrugs. "Descendants of Siar, at any rate."

The lady looks up. "Yes." Then she watches the bitch lick her children clean. As the last puppy squirms and finds a mother's teat, she looks over her shoulder again. "Yes." Then she stands up and walks away.

The man looks at Andreth. "You will keep that music, lad. Keep it safe. It gives others much power over you. The dead hear their music, and feel no fear, for they are dead. No longer can they be harmed. You, oddling, are not. Or if you are, you hide it well."

Ash murmurs, "We'll have to work harder to keep Keorn's music out of the hymnal for awhile," to no one but himself.

Andreth nods to the man. "That song... stops at my first death, I think." He nods to his companions. "And I trust them to hear my music. But... I will keep it safe else. I thank you, sir."

The man smiles. "Not at all. A lesson learned ..." He looks up at the skies. "And nobody to strike us down. How pleasant." He stands up, turning to head back to his hut. "Some day I will play the next tune, I think, andthen I will know why you would hear your music so early."

Ash stirs from his thoughts. "Sir, we need to continue the Trials of the Courtship. If you know where we must go from here, please say on. If not, we're very grateful for your help."

The man smiles. "If you were sent by young Illath, he'll wait for you by the spring. Just head north, and it's about an hour's walk."

Andreth bows. "I'd tell you what I could, but time presses now. Since I'm still living," he adds with a little smile.

The man nods. "Yes. Normally the dead are far more talkative. But they only speak once." He sighs, then shoos. "Off you go, younglings. Guard your oddling well."

In short order, the company heads north, looking for the spring. Spotting the spring, they approach, and see Illath sitting on a stone, chewing on a stalk of grass. He smiles when he spots the Companions, then pauses. "There are ... still five of you. What music did you learn?"

Ash smiles, mindful of the roundabout riddles the party has faced in connection with the Changers. "'One whose hand still bears the tooth, learned his own melodic sooth, though he fell in far off lands, his killer's kin's life rests in his own hands'."

Illath raises an eyebrow. "Ah; a ClanKeeper." He tilts his head, and consults a small medallion in his hand. Then he shrugs. "But you've mastered the test. And early, too. Sleep, now, and I will watch. In darkness we will send you forth."

Ash wonders about the following test, causing Illath to smile. "Well, first we asked one of you to die. Now, one of you must live, and endure, trusting to his companions to save him. When you have slept, you will nominate one of you, and we will take him ... or her ... and take him away. The others will be given a map, of course, and you will have until nightfall to find him. After nightfall he will be dead, and you will have failed."

Stormy looks up at this, and blinks.

Ash says, "Either the challenge is to discover the hiding place of the taken friend, or to overcome the defenses or defenders of the place. Which, or in what proportion?"

Illath shrugs. "Both." He looks at the party. "You will have your weapons, and a map." He smiles for a moment. "And of course, you must choose someone who will survive until nightfall."

Ash nods, after several moments of thought. "Best that someone volunteers for this, and best to do so after a night's rest and contemplation," he suggests to his fellows.

Andreth nods to Ash.

Illath nods. "Of course. Sleep. I will wake you, then, with an hour or two to spare before the separation."

Ash ponders the tactfulness of his question, then plunges ahead. "Illath.. what would it take to convince a ClanKeeper to attempt to influence the Courtship for the worse? Not that we intend to," he adds quickly, "but... how involved would it be?"

Illath pauses. "A true ClanKeeper ... observes. He does not influence." He pauses for even longer. "But ClanKeepers have turned traitor before; they are ClanKeeper, but they are also Changer. And sometimes ..." He shrugs. "Sometimes they do not do as they should, but as they would. When we find those,they die. But their motivations always vary."

Ash nods. "Like every other mortal in our world," he replies with a half-smile. "We fear it may happen, or may already have happened, but we have no firm proof. We're no great friend to the Changer clans, but we'll stand with them before we aid those who might seek to disrupt or overpower the Courtship."

Tilara nods. "We are .... concerned about the Elk Clan. We were hoping that our fears were unfounded."

Starguard hmmph, readying for what sleep he can get. "I'm worried about the dagger not showing up at all."

Illath nods. "We fear for the missing dagger. It should not be lost. But the Courtship must continue, the ClanKeepers tell us. Already, the Wolves seek the Elk Dagger; they have their tests readied and wait only to find the Suitor."

Ash thinks for a moment. "How hard would the Elk Dagger, itself, try to return itself to the Courtship when the time was right?"

Illath shrugs. "I don't carry a dagger; I don't know if or how it thinks. Keorn ... Keorn will not speak of this. Nor will the carrier of the Hawk dagger. I do not know, even now, who carries the cat. But the Elk have begun their tests in earnest. Already one Cat Companion is dead."

Starguard says, "And if we are going to not follow their example, I suggest that we get to bed while we can."

When the Mother Star rises, Illath wakes the party. "It's time to choose." He looks at each of you in turn. "Choose wisely; let him who can endure, endure. But the way to reach him is hard, and full of turmoil."

Starguard hmms. "Endurance? Ash, or myself, I think."

Ash looks from face to face, curious if any have resolved themselves to this duty. His lips quiver now and then as though preparing to speak, but still he waits to see if any value this role more than he.

Illath smiles again. "So choose also to keep the group as strong as possible."

Starguard says, "I'm not vital, really. You all have potions."

Tilara says, "Stormy? Will you trust us again?"

Stormy gulps, once, then nods. "If ... Ummmm."

Tilara says, "What do you mean by 'endure'? Will he be in danger while he waits? Or just if we cannot find him?"

Illath smiles. "Each of you will be tested. The one, alone, will be tested for his endurance, his strength, and his loyalty. And his faith. And you ... you will prove that his faith is worthwhile, his loyalty is steadfast, and his endurance is sufficient."

Starguard says, "Ash... I think that should be me."

Tilara says, "It's up to you, Stormy. You endured once already while we tracked you down. Are you willing to do it again? If not, I'll trust you this time."

Stormy heaves a huge gulp. "You've ... you've never let me down. Any of you. I know ... I know you'll come for me. So if ... if I have to, I will." He doesn't look particularly thrilled at the thought, mind you.

Ash smiles at Starguard for just a moment. "I trust that you and Firestorm both are resilient, Brother. But I trust your skills to be more necessary than his in this venture." He claps a hand heavily on the boy's shoulder, looking at him intently. "We'll be there soon. Remember that. We'll come."

Starguard nods. And studies Stormy for a moment, picking out a clasp on his cloak, carefully locking it in his mind.

Tilara nods, and holds the young sorcerer in a tight hug. "We'll be there as soon as we can."

Stormy nods, and clasps hands with each of the other companions after hugging Tilara, before turning to Illath. "I'll come with you." Illath, in turn stands up, and drops a bow. "The boy ... becomes a man. Keorn knows not what he's wrought."

With that, Illath pulls a map out of his tunic. "This will aid you. Do not leave the spring until Brother Sun touches the horizon. The lad and I will ride."

The Hawk Clan emissary, and the party's youngest member, disappear into the distance. The party, each with their own thoughts, watches. Again, Firestorm will be taken away from the party. Again, his life will be in question, ringed with danger. Again, the party will rush headlong into the unknown to try and rescue him. Perhaps, again, they'll succeed.
