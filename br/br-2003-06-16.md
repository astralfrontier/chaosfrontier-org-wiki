Anne, the little hovering cloud, is an able navigator, and soon brings the company back to the self same spot from which they set out this morning. She looks a little faded, in direct sunlight, as the sun beats down from overhead. It's already noon, and there's still a long way to go.

Standing there where they camped, just a few short hours ago, the Company takes stock. Then they retrace their steps, past the hummocks where they recovered the chest, and past the point where they turned aside this morning. Still they continue forwards. The web marks a spot just passed ... Starguard pauses, and points out the turn in the river. Beyond, a copse of trees grows, the stream swinging around it.

A single scream rends the air.

Ash grimly studies the gathering woods beyond. "If that's it... we'd best be prepared for anything.." His words are cut off by the sound, and without waiting he dashes forward, toward the source.

Andreth draws the wolf dagger, eyeing the hilt, and waves it in the air. "This seemed to have somethin' to say back at the barrows..." As the scream rings out, he turns in that direction. "But I think we better see 'bout that first!" he says, following close on Ash's heels.

Starguard is close behind Andreth, readying his crossbow for whatever may come.

Tilara stays with the group, grumbling. "This time I'm not taking point, though." It's just an act, though, she's moving as quickly as anyone.

The dagger glows faintly, catching the hovering cloud's attention, as it zips after Andreth. Within moments the trees become more clearly visible. Standing, held at bay, trapped against a tree, a very pregnant woman looks around; while three extremely scruffy looking men surround her.

Tilara stops just long enough to slap a quarrel into her crossbow.

Ash's hands are on the grip of his sword, withdrawing it from its sheath in a lethal whistle. He doesn't attack just yet, but as he draws close his posture is very much an aggressive one. "Hold and explain this!" he bellows. To his ex-bandit's sensibilities this is a clear-cut and obvious situation. But some other part of him is urging caution, inciting him to not attack until he has learned something.

The men turn, visibly surprised by this interruption. Each carries a different weapon: the tallest carries a long sword which he now points at Ash, while the other two carry a falchion and quarterstaff respectively. The woman looks hopefully at Ash, her hands now cradling her very pregnant belly, until she moans ...

Ash waits patiently, confidently grinning as he hefts his own blade. "It's dangerous here," he says aloud, directing his speech to the three men, though his eyes stay on the woman. "What is your business?"

Tilara keeps her eyes on the men, for her part. The first one that moves towards the woman gets a quarrel.

The tallest man grins, displaying a disturbing lack of teeth. "She's ours, see, and we're 'avin' a bit of sport, like. Just a bit a huntin' ta get the juices flowin' ..."

Starguard frowns at the apparent leader, his crossbow held just short of an insult. "Doesn't look too sporting to me," he says grimly. Andreth says nothing, but nods in agreement, his knuckles whitening.

Tilara purrs, her voice dangerously soft. "Yours?" Her familiar hisses his own opinion of this. "She does not seem to be enjoying it, and she has other concerns at the moment."

Ash smiles a little. "Madam, how did YOU come to be here?" he asks, more gently. Though an odd question, it comes from the very heart of that suspicious voice in his mind, the voice that wonders how a very pregnant woman would come to be in such a strange and demonstrably hostile area without visible escort.

The man spits on the ground, his long sword still held with the pointed end up. "Awwww ... she ran fast enough. Fleet of foot, weren't ya, dearie?" He looks over his shoulder, winking at the woman. "Ran fast for a fallow little doe, she did. Jumped, and ran, and led us a long way. But we gots her now ..." Behind him, the woman shakes her head, eyes as wide open as they can be.

Her hair, half caught in a kerchief that's slipping off her back, is thik, and scraggly, and soaked through with sweat. Her clothes are torn, the rents suggesting that the men have almost caught her before ...

Overhead, Anne hovers, flying forward then retreating to hide behind Tilara ...

Ash nods and smiles. "You may have thought a single doe was easy to catch. Try your luck with a pack of wolf's friends, if you like," he says, raising a hand from his sword-hilt in a mocking, inviting gesture.

Tilara sighs, glancing at the sun. "We do not have _time_ for this." She addresses the woman, though her eyes do not leave the males. "How did you get here, goodwife?"

The woman looks at Tilara, and then at the crossbow in her hand. "I ... I ran", she gasps, before doubling over. "Oooooh ..."

Ash turns his head to the side. "Starguard, attend!" he barks. "We'll take care of this."

Starguard glances briefly at Anne's shade, then at Tilara. "On the contrary, I think this is what we have time _for_..." As the woman doubles over, his healer's instincts cry out, and he makes as if to circle round past the men to go to her side...

Andreth moves to cover his friend's advance, staying roughly between him and the ruffians...

The men circle, spreading out to deny him access to the woman, who now half sits half crouches against the tree. "We'll not be sharin'", says the one who is covered in loose poorly cured hides. "She's ours now. Git yer own."

Tilara says, "She is not yours, ruffian. She is her own person, and we will enforce it on your carcasses if you force us to it. Don't interfere with our healer."

Ash advances without hesitation, his weapon ready to strike or parry. "Move or die where you stand," he jerks out, through gritted teeth.

The man spits again, then lifts his falchion, pointing it at Starguard. "One step, old man, and I'll bash yer head in." Meanwhile, the leader looks at Ash. His face grim, he pauses.

Ash keeps coming, changing course for the man with the falchion. The time for words is over now; his blade carries his message for him, ready to strike.

Looking at Ash, the man waves his falchion about. But already he looks a little less certain. A little intimidated even. Twice, he looks over his shoulder, measuring the distance between him and his mates.

Ash steps up into striking distance. His greatsword is ready, the magical edge unnaturally sharp. "Back.. Off," he grates, eyes fixed forward.

Andreth advances to Ash's side and takes up the fighting stance of the Oak, wordlessly supporting his companion's threat.

Tilara simply aims her crossbow at their spokesman.

The men begin to back up, just a little, before the combined might of those two threats. As they move past the tree, Starguard's path is clear.

Starguard takes the opportunity to rush to the young woman's side. "Take deep breaths, lass... try to relax..." he says in as soothing a tone as he can manage.

Ash suddenly smiles. "Hey, you lot. What is it that you see, when you look there?" he asks, tipping his head sideways at the pregnant woman.

The woman looks up at Starguard, as she crouches, and then moans again ... Her hands cradle her belly, and he can see her muscles ripple with every contraction. They're only a few minutes away apart now. Less.

The men look at Ash. "Why, a fine pregnant little doe; cooks fer us, cleans fer us, does fer us. But she got all uppity last night, and started runnin'. Can't 'ave that; who'd cook the porridge?"

Ash nods slowly. "You from around here, then?"

The man shrugs. "Around ... aye. A sort." He looks around. "She ran a fair bit ... almost like she wanted ta lose us." He looks at the woman. "And she's no daft enough for that, now are ye, Anniekin?"

Starguard mops the young lass's brow with a folded cloth. "Easy there, dear... now _push..._" he says, nature's most unlikely midwife - but his time in the Temple of the Stars serves him well. The name, however, gives him pause, and his eyes flit to the cloud floating behind Tilara.

Ash is a little more blunt this time. "Are you men, or are you more like her, those who change their skins?"

"Change our skins? We dinnae change ..." He pauses. "Hell, you think she's one of them blasted Changers, doncha? Bah. No. Anniekin's a good little girl, always has been. Why, I had her mother, and her grandmother ... "

Ash nods again. He seems almost content by this proclamation. "And who is the father of her child now, if you know?" he asks.

Tilara's face goes completely still at that name, though her eyes meet Starguard's. _Indeed. The key to his birth..._

The men all grin. "Why, lad, it coulda bin any one of us. Hell, we dinnae care." The smallest steps forward, smirking, his hands in his belt. "Pool says she's carryin' mine. Pool says the red hair'll tell the tale."

Ash nods. "And your name?"

The man smiles. "Me? Randy. Named for me appetites." He spits on the ground. Amazingly, how well these men can aim flying gobs of drool. "An' ere's Charlie, and there's old Eddie. E's one wit' stick." He looks at Starguard, who is fussing over the woman. "Now, now, yer gonna help her get healthy, are ya? She'll be cookin' again tonight? Cave's an awful mess, with her disappearance ..."

Ash smiles gently, then nods and begins stepping forward. "Andreth? Him, we need alive." He carries his massive weapon handily, confidently.

Starguard spares a brief glare toward Randy. "Can't say for sure," he says in tones of pure business. "She's in an awful state, the way you've been running her about..." he says, returning his attention to the young woman's labor pains.

Andreth's scarred face creases in an unpleasant grin. "My pleasure," he says, advancing once more.

Andreth takes two swift strides, draws back his fist, and deals a haymaker to Randy's chin before he can bring up his weapon in defense, sending the man staggering back.

Ash follows up with a swing of his greatsword, barely scratching near the skin with his first swing, and connecting well with his second. Steel cuts flesh, and Ash nods grimly, satisfied that his target won't be much of a threat for the moment...

Behind him, the falchion whistles through the air, catching the young monk off guard for a mere moment, as it connects solidly withhis shoulder.

Andreth calls out, "Starguard! We need 'im alive!" Starguard pats the young Anniekin's hand briefly. "Hang on, lass, I won't be a moment..." he says, before rushing to the side of the fallen thug, swiftly bandaging the worst of his wounds.

Seeing his own chance, the long sword is quickly swung at Ash's head, but quickness does not make for good aim. It makes, in fact, for rather poor aim. Which may prove fatal to the lanky fighter.

From above, a chanting suddenly comes up, and within moments a ball of fire flies, hitting Starguard from behind.

Tilara fires her crossbow at the tall swordsman, but his sudden move causes her to miss. The fireball gets her attention, and she's scanning for the mage even as she reloads.

Andreth winces briefly as the club bounces off his shoulder, but he gives a grim smile. No longer pulling his punches, he pummels the unfortunate falchion-wielder mercilessly, sending the man to the ground with a skull that probably shouldn't be that shape.

Ash strikes his would-be assailant, carving a long and bloody line, Ash's unfortunate calling card in difficult situations. The warrior turns as the momentum of his swing carries him, and his eyes immediately dart into the leaves above.

Tilara aims at the fellow in the tree. "You're involved with these ... persons, too?"

"Truce! Truce!" The man calls out, both hands empty.

Starguard cries out as the fireball singes his shoulder. "Up in the tree!" he calls, grabbing for his crossbow and firing up into the branches, the wooden shaft whistling past harmlessly.

Tilara says, "Come down then, and don't try anything fancy. I'm a sorceress myself, so I'll know it before you can finish the spell."

The man nods, looking down. "Will they put their weapons down first?"

Tilara says, "Probably not. But we won't kill you if you behave."

Ash sheathes his greatsword readily, careless of the blood on the blade for now. More important matters take precedence. "A moment to attend to these men," he calls. "Now come down from there and let's talk."

The man sighs. "Best I can hope for, I suppose." Grasping a tree bough, he swings down easily, quickly descending until at last he lands on the ground. His hands he holds away from his sides, palms forward.

Starguard sets down his crossbow and attends to the other two fallen. He whistles briefly and shakes his head as he inspects the crushed skull. "I'm afraid he's beyond my help, Andreth. This other fellow, though..." Moving on to the other, he soon has him bandaged and stable. This taken care of, he promptly returns to Anniekin's side and returns to what he sees as the more important task.

Ash is busy pouring some of the old priest's home-made remedy down the throat of Randy, all the while gripping the man's collar with one hand, as though restraining himself from certain more violent actions. "What's your story, sir?" he asks as he slowly pours, directing the question to the magician.

Tilara nods. "You'd seem to be a bit brighter than these fellows."

The man looks around. "Why, here I was, napping up in this tree, waiting for dusk, when these galoots came along, chasing this lovely lady ..."

Anniekin begins to moan more loudly as the labour pains come only moments apart.

Ash thinks for a moment, reflecting on the strange twists and turns of fate that he and his companions have experienced. "Honesty comes fitfully among strangers," he asks in a slow, almost hesitant tone. "But.. witnessing what you did, what WOULD you have done?"

The man looks around. "Three of them, and one of me? Waited, I suppose. And watched." He shrugs. "When the wild dogs fight, the tame ones know to stay inside."

Ash says, "You live around here as well?"

"Here?" He smiles. "No. but I prefer to travel at night, when the dogs sleep."

Ash nods again, smiling. "What's your name, sir?"

The man sweeps a shallow bow. "I hight Arnan, of Lirinidariel. I've gotten turned about a bit, I fear."

Tilara says, "Apparently. Why'd you try to flame Starguard, here?"

Starguard says, "That's it, dear. I know it hurts, but you'll be alright. Don't push yet, you need to just try to wait..."

The man looks at Starguard. "I assumed you ran with the same band. They've been arguing for the past two hours, both about who gets the lady first, and what they'll do with the kid. There's even odds on sellin' or eatin'."

Starguard says, "I don't think much of either option, myself. Andreth, could you get a cloth damp in the river? I'd just like to see them both get through this."

Andreth nods to Starguard, and soon has returned with a damp cloth. This having been tended to, he satisfies a personal curiosity of his. Shielding the wolf dagger with his body so that no one feels threatened, he points it at the various people we've just met, noting that it glows faintly when it's aimed at each of the four men.

Stepping aside, Ash engages Arnan in a conversation that is intended to produce maximal amounts of information in minimal time. Soon, he has learned that Arnan is a man of Fallon, Prince of Fallon. He's a simple man, and knows not the Emperor, nor indeed his own prince. For now, he travels in search of learning ...

Starguard counts the time between the contractions, coming quick and hard. "That's it dear. You're getting close..."

Seeing that the fighting has died down, the cloud slowly lowers, until at last she hovers over the labouring woman ...

Starguard swears loudly. "She's hemorrhaging. The kids might be wrapped in the cord too. Come on, dear, this may be a little uncomfortable..."

Ash observes softly, "There may be nothing even you can do, Starguard... but let's see how much elbow room Fate left us."

Having nothing better to do, Andreth stretches, and watches the childbirth nervously, with a curious glance on the hovering shade. His nervousness increases as Starguard sounds more agitated, but feels helpless - here, there is nothing he can do at all...

Tilara says, "This is ... foreordained, I fear. What has already happened is fated to happen again. But let's see if we can fix it this time around."

Ash shakes his head. "And if not fix, at least observe. But saving Stormy's life may be more than simply rescuing him from an imposed and temporary threat.."

Grumbling under his breath, Starguard pauses a moment. The labour pains now ripple non-stop, and the woman can't help but push. But nothing is coming out. Placing one hand carefully, he feels not the hairy crown of a babe, but the sleek skin of a child's buttocks. Breech, bedamned. He looks up at the party. "We can't help the babe until it's out, and it can't be born this way.

Taking out his sharpest knife, and cleaning it carefully, Starguard looks at the woman. He catches her eye, as she looks fearfully at the knife, and tries to reassure her, before handing her a handful of herbs to chew on, to numb the pain. Quickly, before she can move, he leans over and with two simple cuts, slices through her abdomen to the womb below. Catching the child, he hands it to Tilara, asking her to wrap it, before turning back to the woman, who is now bleeding very badly.

Tilara does her best, remembering what the midwives did with her younger siblings. She cleans the baby, makes sure it's breathing well, and tries to figure out something for it to suckle.

The babe nuzzles at her knuckles, suckling greedily. Its red hair glows in the sunlight, even under the discolouring tinge of the blood still clotted in the hair.

Starguard quickly stitches up the cuts, using a orison to heal the stitch, to stop the bleeding. "Red hair on the child. Is it a boy or a girl, Tilara? It's done now. Rest..."

Tilara says, "Male, of course. As we expected. Will she make it?"

Ash is more nervous than he shows; life and death have played themselves out before his eyes, but never before in a manner quite like this queerly personal and uncomfortably familiar tableau. "Starguard.. ?"

Starguard sighs. "She will be in a moment." Calling upon the Stars, he uses one of his precious spells, letting his healing magic flow into her.

Slowly, the wounds close, the blood fading. The clothes remain rent, but her face glows with love as she accepts the babe, wrapping it close in her shirt, cradling it against her breast where it immediately tries to suckle.

Ash squats down near the woman, frowning a little bit. "Madam.. I know this is ... an odd time, but.. do you understand my speech?" he asks.

The woman looks at Ash, her hands still stroking the babe, unsure of her good fortune. She nods, then speaks slowly, haltingly. "Aye ... aye ..."

Starguard washes his hands. "She'll be alright, but I don't think we can take her with us unless we carry her. And we can't leave her here."

Arnan smiles. "Well, at least you don't need to mind me. I'll be on my way then, shall I?"

Ash shakes his head at Starguard. "We don't have to." He rises to look at Arnan. "A moment, sir," he says politely. "I ask of you a boon, in the name of the Prince and the Emperor, Glia-Gulmeshki, who is his father and sovereign."

Arnan looks at Ash. "A boon? Speak on, good man. Perhaps I can be of assistance?"

Ash continues. "Take this woman, and her child, to Citadel. You will have no trouble finding it, I think, in any civilized land. Protect them for as long as they are in your charge. In Citadel you will find the Emperor, who will either know of the White Company, or who can learn of them. And if you are of a mind to be a teacher as well as scholar, teach this woman's child all that you know of your arcane craft." He turns again, his attention now focused on Randy.

Pausing a moment, Arnan looks at Anniekin. Then he smiles, wryly. "I accept the charge. You did what I ... could not."

Ash hunkers down, looking at Randy with narrowed eyes. "You will do obeisance to this woman," he says in a calm, level voice. "You will beg her forgiveness for the indignity you have rendered, or I will do to you what our priest did to her, that her child would live." He fingers the knife at his belt. "You, however, will not receive healing. Make your choice."

Andreth breathes a sigh of relief, as Starguard, with the Stars' blessing, has saved both the child and the mother. Kneeling beside the lass, he smiles at the newborn babe. "He's a beautiful lad..." he whispers as gently as he can manage. "What's his name?"

Paling, Randy scurries backwards, trying to stay as far away from Ash as he can, while he stutteringly makes his apologies and begs for forgiveness. Forgiveness she does not seem, at first, inclined to give. But then she pauses, and looks down at her red haired child, and back at Randy. "Don't come near me. Ever." She turns away from him, snubbing him, and turns to Andreth. "I ... I don't know. I've never named a child before." She looks at the babe. "What are your names?

Starguard says, "Starguard, lady. But don't name him that. He'd have a tough childhood."

Andreth nods. "M'name's Andreth, miss," he says, for himself, and nods toward Ash and Tilara, that they may introduce themselves... and grins briefly at Starguard's comment.

Ash gives no further thought to Randy; his role in this is over, as far as the warrior is concerned. Though he attends to the man's presence or absence as a tactical threat, his mind is focused now on the fate of this woman. "Ash, lady. We're on our way to see a wedding."

Tilara chuckles. "And I'm Tilara, but you certainly don't want to name him after me. Give the boy his own name, and take good care of him."

Looking at each of them, Anniekin nods. Then she looks down at the babe, and smiles. "I ... may never marry. But I will always have this lad. I'll not name him for you, then. But if I may borrow syllables ... Anstar Astil, son of Anniekin." She looks up, timorously, while Arnan moves to support her by the shoulder. He, too, looks down on the babe ...

Ash rises, nodding again to Arnan. "Thank you, for all that you've done, and all that you will do," he says gravely. Then, facing each companion in turn, he smiles. "White Company.. we have one more wedding guest to find. Shall we?"

Starguard nods. "Double time, if we can at that. Stormy's life is at stake."

Arnan nods, and climbs back into the tree, returning with a plain bedroll and a warm cloak, which he wraps around Anniekin. He smiles at her, and then turns to the Company. "I wish you well, in all your wedding plans. We shall camp ... a little ways from here. Anniekin needs sleep."

Andreth nods to his companions. "Let's go. But first..." he says, opening the chest and taking out the first scroll case. Opening it, he finds that it is no longer empty, but contains a scroll... with two words. He shows it to Ash. "Does this say what I think it says?" he murmurs, grinning.

The four wanderers - Companions to the Wolf, rescuers of a friend and witnesses of his life - stare down at the scroll that was described as "the key to Stormy's past". On it is written the name "Anstar Astil".
