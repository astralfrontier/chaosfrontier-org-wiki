One scroll has appeared, leaving only two missing. Stormy's childhood, and his future. The map suggests another hike, slightly shorter than this one. A hike that leaves the stream, and includes a jaunt into a small cave. Well, the cave mouth looks small from this distance, where the party pauses, looking up at the trail.

"Some of what we are about to see, we may already know, or suspect," grunts Ash. "Some will be new to us. Whatever happened to him, though, was uniformly bad. And.. there may be other surprises, beyond simply a recital of his history."

Tilara says, "It ... might even be different, if we affected things before."

Andreth looks down the path, toward the cave entrance. "Well, whatever's there, is there. Let's go 'n find out what."

Ash nods, reaching back to gently pat the handle of his greatsword. "There's no time like the present," the brawny bravo agrees, loping toward the cave.

As Ash moves closer, he smells smoke, and sees a thin spiral coming out of the cave mouth and whimsically moving upwards. Behind him, Anna follows slowly. She seems a lot more hesitant, since the previous encounter. Perhaps even a trifle thinner, although given her current form, that's hard to tell.

Nobody seems to notice Ash as he steps up to the cave mouth, hand still on his greatsword. Inside, there's a small fire that gives off more smoke than heat or flame. A child, dressed in a ragged tunic, is roasting a spitted rabbit over the flames, wincing when the grease spatters and burns him. Beyond, deep in the cave, by the light of a lantern, three men are playing cards. Two of them look like the usual thug, so reminiscent of Ferg's gang. The third ... looks like Ferg.

Tilara says nothing, but her scowl is eloquent.

Starguard draws in a quiet breath as he spots Ferg, and chokes back a remark, but his hand tightens around the haft of his mace, his eyes narrowing. _Ferg, again? ...No, for the first time._

Ash thinks a moment, then tugs the hood of his cloak up over his face, tilting his head downward. _If we move in and do what we done to them others,_ the warrior reasons to himself, thinking in the way he's accustomed, _this'll be a memorable face. No tellin' just what changes we might end up with, if this really is.._ Words fail his thought, but his brain understands vaguely the nagging fear that plagues it. The warrior waits, glancing back after a moment out of curiosity, and the motion is rewarded by the sight of his companions. He gestures with one hand, signalling restraint for the moment. _Let's see what he does._

Andreth's own fists tighten as well, and he glances at the map for guidance. The path's course still leads into the cave, as best he can tell, and he looks up at his companions, pointing at the map and into the heart of the cave.

Tilara looks more carefully at the boy, wondering if this is what happened _because_ we intervened, or in spite of it.

The boy turns the rabbit on the spit one last time, before pullit it off the fire. Putting it on a stone slab, he cuts it somewhat inexpertly into three pieces, and brings those to the card players. They barely look up as he serves the food, and he's loosely cuffed by Ferg, and commanded to bring another wineskin. He nods, head bowed, and darts deeper into the cave, returning with three wineskins, which he hands to the card players.

Time passes, as the card play resumes, the cards now somewhat greasier. Ferg's fortune has certainly improved, as he begins to win round after round. The other two are beginning to scowl, and when the boy is sent hither and yon on errands, the cuffs he gets become less playful and ringingly more painful. His head sinks deeper between his shoulders, and his hunch increases. When he isn't running errands, the boy sits by the fire, feeding it wood.

He runs his hand through the flame, testing it, watching as the fire licks his hand but causes no obvious damage. Looking furtively back at the players, he moves his hand, stretching fingers through the flame, almost as though he were trying to conduct the flames in a dance all their own.

Andreth grimaces at the mistreatment of the young lad, remembering his own harsh childhood. His fists clench and unclench, and as one especially stinging slap resounds inside the cave, he even takes a step forward. But... for the moment he restrains himself, and merely gives Ash an urgent look, as if to say, "We have to do _something..._"

Ash draws back a little, signalling his friends to do the same, then beckons Tilara forward. He whispers in a hushed voice, barely daring to speak. "You lead in. We're hunters, after a large scary man. We need shelter." He jerks his head toward the group inside as a silent cue to get going.

Tilara thinks about it a second, then grins. She calls out, "Haloo the cave! Can we join you?" Her crossbow is notched and loaded, but aimed away from the trio.

The boy looks up, his eyes wide. Ferg, too, turns around. His eyes, though, are narrowed into thin slits, as one hand caresses the other forearm. Behind him the other cardplayers have laid hands on notched loaded crossbows of their own. But let us turn to ferg, who is surely the focal point. The only one of all these men to be dressed in clean, neat clothes, he looks Tilara over approvingly, a smile passing across his lips, chased by the demons beyond no doubt.

Then he rises easily to his feet, still smiling, and sweeps a bow. "My lady, be welcome. Will you join us for a little repast? A simple feast?" He barely looks at the boy. "Our urchin will be pleased to serve you drink, and make you fresh oatcakes. We will be pleased to play with you ..."

Ash steps in as well, face covered, body language neutral. He carries himself in a familiar way - the bearing of a bodyguard, ready to step in place of his charge to receive a crossbow or parry a blade. But he says nothing.

Tilara chuckles. "We're bounty hunters, actually. Just need a place to rest for a bit. No need to get up on my account."

Ferg's eyebrow raises as he spies Ash, and then his eyes narrow as he watches the man's stance. His hands now hang loosely by his side, his cards having been dropped aimlessly on the ground. Then he turns away from Ash, his eyes fixed once more on Tilara. "Wine, boy", he snarls, and the boy disappears into the depths of the cave, running back with a smaller fresh wineskin which he hands to Tilara. Ferg waits impatiently until the boy returns. "Bounty hunters? Who do you hunt, so far from civilization?"

Andreth follows close behind, on Tilara's other side. His own stance is one of relaxed readiness, his eyes watching the errand-lad, with the occasional glance at the three adults. Starguard brings up the rear, his jaw working slowly as he contains his feelings toward Ferg - especially given the look that the man just gave Tilara. A predatory look, if he's any judge.

Tilara says, "A fellow by the name of Bull. He's wanted for murder back in Woolwich, as it turns out. Big fellow...." She describes him, then, using Big Joe as a template. "Tall, a bit bigger than my partner here. Blond, strong as an ox and about as bright. He knew enough to leave town, and we've tracked him to the vicinity. I don't know how good he is in the wilderness, to be honest - I'd like to catch him before he manages to get himself killed. The reward for alive is bigger. They want to hang him proper." She thanks the boy when he brings the wineskin, but notes the different size and doesn't drink right away.

Ferg smiles again. Or rather, a second smile runs across his lips, chased by demons incarnate. Behind him, the other two men snicker. Then he gestures at the wineskin. "Drink, milady. Share our hospitality." He lifts his own wineskin to his lips, expertly squirting some red wine into his mouth, before lowering it again. "Fresh stock; _purchased_ only a few days back."

Tilara murmurs a few words and makes a few gestures over the wineskin after she uncorks it. "Can't be too careful, y'know."

As Tilara opens the wineskin, she can feel the wrongness seeping upwards. There are things wrong with this wine, but she isn't entirely certain which.

Tilara pauses and sniffs, a bit ostentatiously. "I think this one's gone bad. Doesn't smell right."

Ferg holds out his own wineskin. "Ah, well, won't you try mine then? 'Tis inhospitable, not to share a spot of wine on a day so fine?" He turns, looking at the boy, his affable voice turning into a snarl. "You! Dispose of that fouled wine immediately!"

Tilara says, "Well, don't mind if I do." She accepts his wineskin and takes a sip, but frowns as he growls at the young Firestorm. "No need to yell at the boy, how would he know it's bad while it's sealed up, eh?"

Tilara wasn't expecting this wineskin to be drugged, but he slipped it in somehow. She yawns, hugely, and realizes what's happened, but too late to do much good. Her fingers close on the crossbow trigger while it's only halfway raised to point at Ferg and the bolt caroms harmlessly off the floor of the cave as she slumps in on herself.

Ash is already reaching for his great blade, his face still hidden under the shadows of the hood. "You guys, wake the lady up," he grunts gruffly. "If she doesn't wake up... " He holds off on unsheathing his weapon for the moment, but his intention is obvious, though he tries to mask his anticipation as best he can.

Starguard rushes forward as soon as Tilara begins to slump over, bearing her gently to the ground as he hurriedly checks her vital signs. Andreth, meanwhile, steps forward and raises his fists, jumping to the conclusion on his own. "You bastard!" he snarls. "What've you done to her?"

Ferg smiles, watching Tilara crumple, his lips opening just a little so that he can lick them. Behind him, the two men straighten, crossbows now aimed directly at Ash and Andreth. Ferg, however, holds up his hand to halt the men behind him. "Now, let's not be hasty, lads. We all know who has the antidote." He chuckles coldly.

"We'll trade your life for it, then," says Ash genially. His voice grows cold and grave. "Now."

Ferg shakes his head. "I wouldn't, lads. I really wouldn't." He gestures smilingly at the thugs behind him. "Those bolts? Dipped, of course." He smiles coldly. "and I only have a few antidotes left ..."

Starguard looks up, his face pale, and stands up to whisper in Ash's ear what her symptoms indicate, in tones too low for the others to hear. "The sleeping sickness. Death in twenty-four hou..." he begins, then starts at Ferg's words. "Antidote?" he says aloud. "What antidote?"

Tilting his head at Starguard, Ferg tsk-tsks. "You don't know about the antidote, old man? Why ... what a pity. Such a waste, really, if your friends will die for your ignorance." He shrugs one shoulder. "This we learned from the boy. Useful lad, that boy. He'll take us far."

"Must be a useful asset, then," grates Ash. He feels powerless, as Ferg's presence has always made him feel, and possibly always will. "Does he have a name?"

The boy looks worriedly at Ferg, his head almost completely buried between his shoulders, as he scuttles backwards deeper into the cave, still carrying a burning brand in his hand. Ferg watches him go, thoughtfully, then turns back to Ash. "The boy? What use does a boy have for a name? Let him earn it, first."

Andreth's eyes flit back and forth toward the two men, almost visibly calculating the odds. But he's never been much of a gambling man, and so far, judging from his immobility, the odds are coming up... just a little too low.

Ash thinks for long seconds, then smiles. "If you just wanted to rob us, you could shoot us now, if your claims were true. So... either you lie, or there's something else you want. What is it?"

Ferg smiles widely, for the first time. "Your surrender. If you fight, you might get damaged. Our patron will pay good coin for you ... as long as we deliver you intact. And as I said, our antidote supply is ... limited."

Ash blinks. "And what are we worth? We'll sell our services to anyone, there's no need for this nonsense. So... again, why?"

Ferg shrugs. "Ours not to question why, ours but to poison, yours to die ..." He's obviously quoting a scrap of some old, long forgotten poem. One that sounds unfamiliar to you. Still, it's all the answer he seems willing to give. Then he speaks up once more. "We will detain you for a single day, no more. Our patron asks no more than that."

Starguard, meanwhile, has been moving his lips, thinking aloud about his calling from the stars, and what Andreth has told him of his training. Suddenly, he breaks out in a broad grin, and raises his crossbow, pointing at the nearest armed thug. "Andreth, get 'em! Ash, behind me!"

Ash ducks and weaves, staying behind the priest as ordered, his weapon wailing its steel song as it leaves the sheath. He isn't sure just what strategy this is, but he's willing to work with it.

Reacting to Starguard's words and Ash's movement, Ferg whips a throwing knife out of his sleeve, whips it towards the cleric, and smiles ferally, eyes narrowed, as the knife slides easily into flesh. Almost curiously he watches for the reaction ...

Slowly, the cleric, too, sinks back down to the ground, falling half over Tilara's prone body.

Andreth gasps as Starguard slumps to the ground, and cries out, "Starguard!" His eyes narrow, and he leaps forward, one of the thugs' crossbow bolts whizzing behind him as he brings his hand round, palm flat, and curses as the crossbowman swerves out of the way of the scything blow.

Ash leaps over the falling body of the priest with a bestial growl, and as the bowman lets loose his first shot the warrior is upon him. One strike is enough to tear open a gash of flesh in the man's abdomen, and as he takes in a rattling breath the big blade is thrust through his belly.

The second thug pulls his trigger, the arrow firing at point blank range into Andreth's belly. Smiling, the man waits for his opponent to drop. But as the seconds pass, the man begins to look worried.

Ash spins on one foot, launching himself at the other man and striking once, cutting a crimson canyon into the bowman's chest. He falls forward a moment later, the faint smile of satisfaction etched on his face as he too meets the cave floor in a slumber.

Behind him, Ferg grins, before turning to look at Andreth. "Shall we make it ..."

Andreth whirls round as Ash falls, his palm whistling through the air and landing smack on the side of Ferg's head, sending the man staggering back. Andreth looks dismayed, however, as the man shakes his head but remains alert.

Ferg smiles, looking around. Then he looks at Andreth. "Surrender, and we will have enough antidotes to go around. Or die. Your choice."

Andreth shakes his head and lets his fists do the talking, the second catching Ferg a solid blow in the gut. The man coughing but still smiling at Andreth, a third dagger emerges from a hidden sheath and whistles through the air, but Andreth seems to see it coming before it even clears the sheath and is simply... not in its path.

Andreth takes advantage of Ferg's delay in drawing the weapon to take another swing at the man, the blow glancing harmlessly off his shoulder. The monk spins round, though, with another haymaker that resounds off Ferg's jaw, and the follow-up kick whistles over Ferg's head as he staggers to the ground.

Andreth glares grimly at his fallen foe, then kneels beside him, wrapping a hand easily around Ferg's throat, his callused thumb applying just enough pressure to the man's larynx to restrict his breathing without stopping it altogether. "The antidote. Now. And no sudden moves or you die."

Ferg looks up at Andreth, and smiles weakly. "Ask the boy. He knows ..."

Andreth keeps his hand where it is, and without looking up, calls out, "Lad! You back there? Come up here - we need you."

The boy scuttles forward, looking scared. He steps carefully around the other two men, as they slowly bleed to death ...

Andreth tries to calm himself as the lad comes into the light. "We need the antidotes, lad," he says, as gently as he can manage. "The ol' man there and the guy with the armor," he says, inclining his head toward Starguard and Ash, "got the daggers, and you know what happened t'the lady. This man here says you know where the antidotes are. Will y'help us? Please?"

Looking pale white, the boy looks around at the carnage. Then he looks at Ferg, still gripped by Andreth. Ferg nods, slightly, and winks at the boy. Scuttling backwards, the boy nods at Andreth, and pulls backwards. His entire posture betrays guilt, and shame, however, as he moves into the other cave, and returns with a small bottle.

Andreth shakes his head sadly. Slow as the monk may be in some ways, this young lad clearly just hasn't learnt how to lie. "Now lad, it's not that I don't trust ya, but... it's that I don't trust this Ferg here," he says, tightening his grip on the man's throat for just a moment. "Now as it happens, we could use some help on our journey oursel's. I seen the way these guys was smackin' you around. We don't do that sort of thing. What d'you say about comin' with us?"

Looking up, the boy shines at Andreth. "Yes? Please?" He looks at the corked bottle, and then thrusts it at Andreth. "Keep this?" The boy smiles whimsically. "It's the only poison he brews that doesn't kill." Then, running backwards, he sprints into the back cave again, and comes out with a much smaller bottle. "Three doses, though. Please, be careful with them." he stops, holding the bottle, suspicion running through his face. "And first! Swear, swear on the goddess whose mark you bear, that you'll protect me from him!"

Andreth looks into the urchin's eyes. "I swear by the the Lady Merial, and by the Book and the Flame," he intones reverently, and brings his free hand down on Ferg's head - not a killing blow, just hard enough to ensure the man gets a few hours of poorly-deserved rest.

As Ferg sighs into deep unconsciousness, the boy nods once more, and offers up the vial. "Shall I administer it?"

Andreth nods, smiling warmly at the lad. "Please do." He breathes a deep sigh of relief. "Thank you."

The boy nods, and then moves over each of the three sleepers, dropping a few drops between their lips, massaging their throats to help them swallow. He's counting the drops carefully, three for each person. And the last drop, that goes to Tilara, is also the last drop in the bottle.

Andreth nods quietly. "How long does it take ta work?" he asks the lad, watching his friends with concern.

"Only moments, sir. Only moments." The boy watches anxiously for the first signs of stirrings.

Ash grumbles and groans, then reaches behind him, tugging Ferg's dagger free with a pained sound. "A... Andreth! What's going on?"

Starguard gasps, suddenly, and shudders all over, then sits up, touching the hilt of the dagger that went into him. "Ugh. D-did we win?" he mutters muzzily.

Andreth chuckles softly, looking a lot more relaxed. "We got us a new travelin' companion, Ash. Ain't that right, lad?" he says, resting a callused hand lightly on the boy's shoulder.

The boy nods, his entire face lighting up. "Yes sir!" He crowds closer to Andreth, whom he seems to admire already.

Ash shakes his head, still a little groggy and out of sorts. He winces as he stands. "Hey... these guys," he says, gesturing vaguely at the bleeding men. "We oughtta probably patch \`em up a bit.."

Starguard staggers to his feet, quickly regaining his strength, and spies the two thugs, who're clearly bleeding out. He kneels beside one, and looks up at Ash, shaking his head. "Sorry, Ash, it's too late for these two."

Tilara's eyelids flutter as she awakens, and she rolls to one side. She calms down when she realizes she's not bound or worse, and she looks around. "That sunnuvabitch was drinking _poisoned wine_! Can we kill him?"

Ash chuckles a little. "I'll drink to that," he replies flippantly. "Anyway..... hmm, guess we're too late for that," he observes, glancing again at the two ex-thugs. "Andreth, the scroll?"

Tilara looks hopeful at that and strides over to Ferg's unconscious form, checking his pulse. "Drat. He's still breathing." She glances at the others. "You didn't promise to spare him or something, did you?"

Andreth looks up at Ash. "Just a moment, m'friend. Lemme introduce ourselves. Me name's Andreth, the young lady's Tilara, the guy with the armor and the big sword's Ash, and our healer there is Starguard. Now... what's yer name, lad? Ferg 'ere said you didn't have one, but we like to have names for our friends..."

Andreth looks up at Tilara, shaking his head. "In fact, I promised ta protect th'lad from 'im." He sighs, looking conflicted. "I admit that'd be easier if'n he was dead, but... I just couldna bring meself to kill a man who's down. Not e'en him."

Biting his lip, the boy shrugs wordlessly. "Dunno."

Andreth nods. "'sokay lad. We'll think o' somethin. Oh, I know, hang on a minnit..." he says, pulling out the scroll cases, and opening one. It's not the one he intended to open, though, for this one only has two words on it. His eyes open wide and he calls out to Ash. "'ere! I think we got the second one!" he says, holding out a scroll with its inscription: "Bought" and "Promised".

Ash blinks a little, walking over to peer at it. "How did you come into this man's service, lad?" he asks gently.

The boy looks at Ferg, lying unconscious on the ground. "When Pa died, my uncle took us in. He lost me, in a card game, and he lost her in the city; sold her to pay his debts." The boy looks up. "When I'm grown up, I'm going to buy her free."

Ash thinks a moment. "How would you find her?" he asks.

The boy bites his lip. "I don't know." He looks at Andreth. "But there's gotta be a way!"

Ash smiles. "Perhaps even a name? Or the name of your uncle?"

Andreth nods to the lad. "That's the spirit. Never give up." He sighs a little. "Sometimes I wish I could find out what happened ta _my_ parents..."

"Mum?" He nods. "Anniekin." He bites his lip. "And perhaps Pa's folks; if they'd known, they would help. I'm sure of it. Pa had ... Pa had _good_ family." He looks at Ferg. "Uncle ... he wasn't so nice."

Tilara says, "A worthy goal, lad. Maybe we can speed it up." She sticks her tongue out at Andreth. "You're too soft-hearted. I'll do it for you." She pulls her dagger out and leans over to stick it into the unconscious poisoner. "Good riddance to bad rubbish."

Ash dives for it, bodily interposing himself between Tilara and Ferg, glowering. "He needs to live... for now," he grunts.

Watching Ash dive forward, the boy looks confused, and huddles closer to Andreth, pulling for his hand.

Tilara sighs. "He does? Why? Are you afraid we'll change what's already happened?" She grumbles, but lets herself be persuaded.

Ash nods emphatically. "YES," he exclaims, pointing at the scroll-cases Andreth has. "You saw that... and...."

Andreth squeezes the lad's hand gently and kneels beside him, letting him close. "Don't worry. We got our own business with Ferg, but we still ain't gonna let him get to you. Never ever."

Tilara contents herself with planting a good solid kick in Ferg's side, instead. "Oh, all right. But we're taking the boy with us. That'll change things, too, won't it? It's worth trying, I think."

Ash shrugs a little. "We'll do as you see fit, Andreth," he says in a more measured voice, regaining some of his customary poise.

Tilara wanders over to smile at the boy. "We've got places to be, young feller. Is there anything you want to bring along? Make it quick."

Starguard inspects Ferg's wounds, for the sake of his curiosity. The man's clearly in bad shape, and thoroughly stunned. "This man isn't getting up any time soon, and even then he's going to need a _lot_ of healing up before he's fit to travel. We'll be long gone before he can even walk."

The boy looks up at Tilara and nods. He darts into the back room, returning with a dagger, a sling, and a small pouch. And a very threadbare cloak.

Tilara nods. "We'll have to call you something, young fire-mage." She grins, expecting a surprised look from the boy. "Aye, I mean you. I saw you playing with the fire. I got started the same way, years back. Come along and I'll teach you the way of it."

Ash smiles a little. "Think, Tilara. Did our Stormy ever exhibit a knowledge of poison?"

Tilara twitches an eyebrow at Ash. "Did we ever ask? I wonder if our Stormy will be the same boy we left..."

Ash shakes his head. "I doubt it. But at Ferg's encampment.. no suggestion of it was ever made. So..." He turns his head, looking significantly at the lad.

The wisp of cloud darts down, playing with the boy's hair, ruffling his cloak, nipping through his surprised hands ... Before once again taking up her station, up above the group.

Andreth chuckles at Tilara. "Who knows? We got his whole future ahead of us, right?" He smiles down at the lad. "Is that everythin'?" He looks up at Ash and shakes his head. "Bought 'n Promised, it says. I promised 'im, so 'e's comin' with us." He looks over as the shade of Anne cavorts around the lad, and laughs. "An' it looks like _she_ knows who 'e is. So I think we're set."

The boy, watching the cloud and listening to Ash's words, looks confused. "Ferg's encampment, sir? But I've never seen ... ummmm ..." He swallows, worriedly. "What should I know, sir?"

Ash looks down at the youth. "What you should know, you will learn," he replies. "Alright... let's get going then, to seek the great perhaps."

Starguard smiles down at the lad as well. "I think I know a good name for you, lad." Gesturing to Andreth, he takes the first scroll case from the monk's hands and reads out the name therein. "Anstar Astil. Can you remember that?"

The boy tries the syllables out, slowly and carefully. "Anstar ... Astil ... Anstar ... Astil." He nods. "Yes sir. They feel ..." He pauses, as his face stills. Then he smiles. "They feel _right_, sir!"

Tilara grins. "They should, Anstar. It's the name your mother gave you."

Anstar shines. "She did?" He looks around, then runs out into the open, running around in quick dizzying circles, chanting his name over and over and over with joy.

Andreth laughs merrily. "Well done, Starguard." He squares up his shoulders and nods to Ash. "Well, let's get movin'. We still got a lot of ground to cover before nightfall."

Ash sheathes his sword at last, wincing a little at the injury in his back. It's a flesh wound at the worst, at least. He waves a hand to Anstar, smiling inwardly, then beckons to the rest.

As the party leaves the cave, the bodies left behind them, the boy capers on ahead, still chanting his name over and over and over. Above, Anne flutters along, and there's a sense of indulgent joy emanating from that paler cloud. She's definitely losing substance though. It's ever more obvious as the sun shines more brightly through her ... Still, she doesn't seem to mind in the slightest.

Only one test awaits; only Stormy's future. Only a short hike, and then a circle of stones?

The White Company has dealt with a trio of assorted riff-raff, when Stormy was born. In his early years, they faced off against a comparatively unprepared Ferg. But the party has also witnessed, first-hand, the power of their unseen enemies, of which Ferg is only one lieutenant. And, too, they have seen how easily these unseen forces have dealt with threats to them. If Stormy's destiny is bound to this man's, and if his power has grown and grown over the year, then what truly will the White Company face in their final challenge? Ash muses over this as he watches the lad gambol ahead, and his face darkens.
