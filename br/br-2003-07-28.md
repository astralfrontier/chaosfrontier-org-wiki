The evening passes pleasantly. Keorn, having met Anstar, looks a lot more relaxed. Somehow, he seems a lot more reconciled to his position as Suitor now. Especially after meeting the Elk suitor, who was still young enough to share information without charging a price. In short, a _very_ young Suitor. Pity about his impending death, really.

The evening passes languorously, as questions wander through the air, followed by the occasional digression and longwinded answer. The companions have much, after all, that they hope to learn about. Old traditions, new traditions, and the entire matter of what happens next. A pity, really, that Illannan is so young; he shared freely with Keorn, but had little to share. But Keorn did manage to shake loose a few acorns.

Tilara grins to herself. _Which is fine, if you're a squirrel..._

The next step is fairly simple, really. An old-fashioned King of the Hill contest. Four Suitors go in, and with them the children who carry the daggers. Keorn looks worried for a moment, unsure who will carry the Elk dagger if Ellinor refuses. Then he shrugs. The Suitors descend down the pit in the centre of the hall. Hours later, one dagger carrier will return. That dagger is presented to Samaela. If she accepts, the Suitor will ascend.

Unfortunately, that's all the boy knows. Keorn smiles, philosophically. He's seen the other suitors, and doesn't seem particularly worried.

Ash's advice on this note is simple, to Keorn. If a fight is what's involved, surviving Suitors, even if they aren't victorious in the Courtship, might go a long way toward encouraging cooperation among the Clans.

Tilara says, "Don't jump to conclusions. It may be more complex than that. I can't tell you why, but I have the feeling that there's more to it than a simple brawl."

At this point Andreth wonders what happens to the other Suitors. Keorn, looking particularly wolfish, raises a single eyebrow and shrugs, before pointing out that the other Suitors are usually never seen again. After all, only one clan can be ascendant at any time.

Ash has a simple response to that assertion: "Why?"

Keorn shrugs at Ash. "I'm not sure. The traditions, the rites ... they all seem to be based on the notion of one alpha male, one alpha tribe, and one alpha clan." He looks thoughtful. "I've never understood why three of the four Gods' Children get discarded so ruthlessly."

Ash shrugs. "Well, look at the Emperor and his sons, then. If you discard the Emperor from your calculations, you have seven men who rule their own territories as they see fit. And the Changers aren't strictly beasts, nor strictly men. Why must they be forced to conform to either dictate?"

Tilara says, "Maybe because someone screwed up the traditions back at the beginning... just keep an open mind about it."

Keorn smiles at Tilara. "Perhaps. Although Far Hawk, you would have thought, would have kept a closer eye on things." He looks into the fire, suddenly pensive, and his gaze keeps sliding to Stormy and Anstar, who are sitting in the corner, huddled over a piece of paper and happily arguing quietly.

Tilara clears her throat as the silence stretches out. "Everyone mentions these prophecies, and how they're worried that changing the traditions is a bad omen, but no one has actually told us what they say. Do you know, Keorn?"

Keorn nods at Tilara. "I ... have listened much these past few days." He smiles grimly. "The emperor did not, perhaps, fully know what mission he sent me on. To observe is ... hah! To observe is to die, unless one wins." He pauses. "These are the prophecies; a man will come, bearing a dagger, lacking the Changer blood, and when he marries the Maiden, she will bear no Changer children. A man will come, bearing a dagger not of his clan, and win the Suitor, and the children she bears will all be of his clan. A man will come, bearing a dagger that is not a dagger, and kill the Maiden. In each of these prophecies, the Changers will cease ... " He smiles wryly. "So I shall win. I bear the Wolf dagger, I am a wolf, and a changer man. And the prophecies will come to naught once more."

Looking at his companions, Keorn looks intently. "There's one last prophecy. One that seems a lot more relevant to this courtship. Let me see if I can remember the exact words:"

Tilara nods. "Different prophecies, and the last at least is mutually exclusive to the others. I think. Hmmm. Prophecies, or warning?"

In a sing song voice, Keorn begins to chant. "A Man will come, and bear a dagger. His companions will come, and some will stagger. None shall fall, and none shall Change, And all that comes to them be strange, For the lack of wisdom left unshared, Have left this party unprepared." He pauses, slowly, looking aorund and smiling wryly. "Poor doggerel, I'm afraid. One of their simpler Seers." he continues, once more chanting. "Let the Maiden choose, Let the Suitors loose, Children should not suffer. The elders are tougher." He shakes his head. "And _still_ it makes no sense to me."

Tilara's eyes are wide. "You don't see it?"

Keorn smiles wryly. "Oh, I know it applies to you. It's the second verse that makes no sense to me."

Andreth rubs his chin, making a rasping sound, and smiles. "Least this 'un don't sound like it means the end of the Changers."

Keorn grins at Andreth. "Oh, there's also the usual prophecies that boil down to 'Doom upon all who muck with the rites and rituals'. They add a little spice."

Tilara says, "I'd think it's obvious. Don't fight to the death to claim Samaela. Let _her_ choose, and all of the God-children will live. I don't quite get the last line, though."

"But how can she choose until a child returns with a dagger?" Keorn shrugs.

Tilara says, "Bah. That's not a choice. That's an imposition. Send all the children out, and let her choose which Suitor she prefers."

Keorn hmmms. Then he looks at Tilara. "This ... " He pauses, then looks at Stormy. "We would have to get the other Suitors to agree tonight, before the pit tomorrow."

Ash makes to rise. "You have something else to do at the moment?" he asks, half in challenge.

Keorn shakes his head. "But before we go to change minds, I ask you this. In times past, the Suitors could at least hope to survive by being the one whose Child was chosen. If all the children go out ... that leaves the Suitors no way to survive." He pauses. "Or at least, no way to fight for their own survival."

Tilara says, "Does anyone know what happens in the pit? From what I've seen so far, it may well be that fighting with each other is not what happens."

Andreth blinks. "No way t'survive what? Each other? Or is there summat else?"

Keorn shrugs. "The last Suitor is dead. His fellow Suitors ... never returned. We don't know."

Andreth rubs his chin. "So who brings out the other three daggers, after it's all over?"

Tilara sighs. "Well, keep an open mind, then. And watch out for treachery, if Ferg is anywhere around. Maybe we should drift around and meet the other suitors."

Ash nods. "Keorn, if this disappearance is handed down by mortal elders, they can be convinced. Or dealt with," he says with conviction. "And if it is some higher power, then... we will see what we can see."

Keorn nods at Ash. "Well, then ... we will need to convince Illannan, and Morunin of the hawks, and Kalaecian of the Cats." He looks around at the group. "Illannan will be the easiest. He knows - or expects rather - to die tomorrow."

Ash smiles. "Then let's not waste any more time."

Tilara says, "Illanan isn't a problem. He'll agree if the others do. It's the cats and the hawks we need to convince."

Starguard frowns, raises a hand. "Keorn... you said 'a man would come bearing a dagger that is not a dagger, and kill Samaela.' How _could_ that happen? Surely your people would know a true dagger when you saw one?"

Keorn shrugs. "I know my dagger, and it knew me, until it choose Anstar." He shakes his head. "But the Wolves do not know me, so ... they are not currently very happy. I had assumed that the elks would have had their dagger confirmed by a shaman; it's how I proved myself, that night that I left you alone in camp."

Starguard nods. "The dagger chose Anstar..." His brow wrinkles, and he looks more troubled. "But Ellinor _rejected_ the Elk dagger, did she not? I know that... after all that happened to her..." says the cleric, stumbling briefly over the words... "she might be bitter about her brother. But what if that wasn't the only reason?" He sighs. "I'd feel better... if she could tell me why she refused the dagger."

Tilara nods to Starguard. "A very telling point. Let's go see."

---

The campsite is quiet, most of the Changers having long since laid head on pillow for a spot of rest. Illannan's tent, too, is dark, although it's the work of only moments to slip inside, where a minuscule amount of illumination is provided by a single candle.

Just enough to see a group of people much divided. On one side Illannan sleeps, with the young boys who were his Companions, all piled together for warmth. Huddled against the far tentwall Jellin and Ellinor lie, Jellin's arms wrapped protectively around the young girl. A girl who is even now audibly - though very softly - sobbing.

Starguard raises a hand to his lips as he beholds the young girl he'd brought back from the edge of death just this afternoon. "Ellinor..." he whispers softly - the name torn from his lips as he witnesses the poor child's suffering. For the moment, he can do no more than watch her cry.

Hearing the sound, Jellin looks up, her eyes narrowing as she spots the group of Companions standing in the entranceway. A hand slides to the dagger on her hip as she watches warily.

Starguard bows respectfully, his eyes shining. "Hello, Jellin..." he says. "I... I know that poor Ellinor there needs her sleep... but there's a question I need to ask her. I'd never trouble the lass, but that it may be a matter of the utmost importance." He nods to his companions. "Also, my friends have something to discuss with Illannan - which may be equally important, in its way."

Gently gripping Ellinor's shoulder, Jellin nudges her, letting her know of the new people in the tent. The girl looks up, eyes smudged and dark in the low light. She spots Starguard, and smiles tremulously. Behind her, Jellin crouches, still looking angry and wary.

The cleric steps forward, kneeling beside Ellinor, pointedly leaving himself open to Jellin - acknowledging the Elk's role as her unusual sibling's protector. "Ellinor..." Starguard murmurs. "I am sorry to disturb your sleep, I truly am. But... there is a question I need to ask you."

Ellinor looks up, hands clasping at Jellin behind her, before carefully placing one hand on his sleeve. "I ... I wasn't sleeping." Expressions chase one another across her face. "What would you know?"

The old man pauses, fearing that he might tear open the still-fresh wounds in the young girl's soul. But... "They tell me that you refused the Elk dagger." Starguard hesitates once more, and then lays his hand atop Ellinor's gently, and in the most compassionate tones he can muster, he asks: "Can you tell me, Ellinor... why that was?"

Ellinor blinks. This was not the question she had expected, obviously. She turns back to look at Jellin, and then looks at Starguard. "I ... I ..." Her voice shrinks to near inaudible levels. "I won't represent those who betray me ... you can't make me ... Jellin says I don't have to ... she says she'll carry the knife for me ..."

Tilara sighs. "I don't think she _can_. Illanan is young, and he made a foolish blunder. Don't hold that against the rest of the Elk clan."

Ellinor's lips begin to tremble. "I don't ... I'm not ... I don't want to die." Jellin's arms wrap around her, and she glares at Tilara. "Betrayers should not lead. I chose to protect; I will carry the dagger."

Starguard looks up at the sorceress, frowning. "Be hush, Tilara. Ellinor has made her decision, and 'twould be wrong of us to force it upon her." He sighs. "Whatever the cause of it may have been." He squeezes Ellinor's hand. "Don't worry about it, lass. You're doing the right thing."

Jellin looks over Ellinor's shoulder, her hand sliding back down to the dagger on her hip. A large dagger, with a gemmed pommel. "Guard her well, cleric. I leave her in your hands."

Tilara says, "As for dying... that's what we want to ask the boy about. D'you remember this?" She quotes the last prophecy Keorn gave them. "A Man will come, and bear a dagger. His companions will come, and some will stagger. None shall fall, and none shall Change, And all that comes to them be strange, For the lack of wisdom left unshared, Have left this party unprepared."

Jellin shrugs. "Aye. I remember. Makes no difference; we lost a man."

Tilara says, "_We_ didn't."

Jellin peers at Tilara. "So? That prophecy is doggerel, pure and simple. Recited by a simple boy, who died of his headwound in hours."

Tilara says, "And we're none of us changers, and we're running roughshod over the traditions because we're outsiders - but it saved Ellinor and Illanan and Kiernan."

Tilara shrugs. "But the elders remember it. Either it's as important as the rest, or the traditions mean nothing more than it does."

Starguard, meanwhile, nods to Jellin. "I'll protect her in any way I can," he tells Jellin, reaffirming his promise to Ellinor. He glances down at Jellin's hip. "That's the Dagger, then, that you bear... with the green gem in the pommel, am I right? Bear it well, Jellin... I don't know for sure if they'll let you be the Child, but don't let that stop you from trying." He smiles wryly. "We haven't let anything like that stop us."

Jellin shrugs. "So you did." Her expression is cold. Icy. Bleak. Chilling. The face of a girl who has looked at Death and chosen it willingly. She turns away from Tilara, concentrating once more at Ellinor. At Starguard's words she twitches. "Guard her **well**, old man. Keep her from the hunters. Keep her alive for a full day. Do that, old man, and your vow is kept."

Tilara says, "Hunters?"

Andreth frowns. "The hunters..." he says, realizing that, if Starguard's role is to protect Ellinor, his own lies with Anstar. "What hunters're these? They're part o' the final test?"

Jellin shrugs. "The Elders, the Hunters. We have our roles to play; they keep us playin' our part." She stares defiantly at Tilara and Andreth. "Tomorrow I will play her role, carryin' the Elk dagger. We all know Illannan can't possibly win. But at least ..." Her voice breaks. "... at least I can save her."

Tilara nods. "And the second half of that one... Let the Maiden choose, Let the Suitors loose, Children should not suffer. The elders are tougher. It starts to make more sense."

Ash steps in, formerly quiet and attentive, now confused. "Why is it, exactly, that ANY must die?" he says, softly. "This is a half-understood tradition. Why must it be done that way? We believe... we believe that there is another way. But it requires the assent of those who will participate."

Jellin looks at Ash. "I ... I would hear of it." She looks down at the girl in her arm. "I would prefer not to die ..."

Tilara says, "The second half of that prophecy. Let the Maiden choose. Rather than present her with a single survivor and a _fait accompli_. All that needs to be done is to have the Suitors agree to abide by her choice."

Ash nods slowly in the dim light, a candle's flame in the everpresent darkness giving rise to a momentary smile of reflection. One small flicker of hope... "Whatever comes in the trials, swear that you will spare your fellows, unless it means your very life, then. Swear that you will find a way to live with your fellow Changers, of whatever breed."

Jellin smiles bitterly. "I have no fellow Changers." She looks down at the girl. "But I will live with them, of all breeds, for as long as I may. So I swear."

Ash nods, satisfied. "We will speak to all who carry a dagger. Keorn, too, has no wish to live or die according to the whims and traditions laid down by those long-dead or uncaring."

Jellin nods, then looks at Illannan. "You will want to warn our ... our admired Suitor." Her lips twist. "Hand picked, he lacks fear. And wits."

Tilara chuckles. "He knows fear, now. Let's see if we can impart some wits as well."

Starguard smiles. "And that's why I wanted to ask about the dagger, Jellin. Because if _all_ the Children bring their daggers to Samaela... well, we also heard tonight a prophecy of what would happen if a 'dagger that is not a dagger' were brought to the Courtship. And far to the north, we heard rumours of non-Changers seeking the green-gemmed dagger - people who..." Starguard's own mouth twists... "should not possess such a thing." He smiles apologetically. "Forgive us our foolish fears, lass."

Stepping to the other side of the tent, Tilara leans over the pile of jumbled bodies. Placing a hand on the Suitor's arm, she tugs lightly, and then more strongly, finally tugging him awake. His arms flail for a moment, and he sits up, looking completely disoriented. Still, he catches the last of Starguard's words, and looks across the tent at the girls. Then he looks back at Tilara. "Yes?

Tilara repeats the prophecy to Illanan. "We think it means us, and we think the second half means you should let the Maiden choose instead of fighting to the death. Will you agree not to fight unless attacked?"

Illannan smiles. "I had not planned on fighting, in any case." He looks around the tent. "The Elk will not win this round. Keorn has explained my odds quite thoroughly." He shrugs. "The Elk have not won in many generations; we expect no change."

Tilara nods ."Fair enough. Keorn agrees, as well - let's see if we can locate the others."

On that reassurance, the party leaves the Elk's to their sleep once more. Or what will pass for sleep tonight. Morunin's tent is at the far end of the site, and they stumble slowly and carefully between the tents. Coming closer, however, they see that his tent is well lit from within, and without a sentry challenges.

Ash steps forward, hands out in a gesture of peaceful intent. "We wish to speak to the Suitor. We do not expect solitude, only attention to what we have to say. We are the White Company, Companions of Keorn of the Wolf Clan."

The sentry looks intently at Ash, then shrugs and steps aside holding up the tent flap, and announcing the Companions. "Morunin? We've got some people want to parley for Keorn's life." After a grunt from inside, the guard smiles and stands aside. "Go on in. We were expecting you."

Ash shakes his head. "You weren't expecting this," he chuckles as he passes, though he's careful with those words to make no threatening motions whatsoever.

Inside the tent, Morunin sits comfortably ensconced on a thronelike chair, his Companions standing behind him. Each carries a long sword, each has one hand on the pommel of his sword. Morunin, a dark, lanky man, scowls a cold welcome. "Well. We expected Keorn would send a parley. Cowards often do."

"We aren't here on Keorn's behalf," says Ash smoothly, looking from face to face, his conviction written on his own weatherbeaten features. "We are here to request an oath from you, regarding the upcoming trials. It is one that will benefit the Changers as a whole. If I am not mistaken, that includes you," he adds with a smile.

"Speak on, young man. You intrigue me." The words still sound cold, but the eyes twinkle with a light wholly their own.

Andreth rolls his eyes, and snorts. "Cowards, he says," he mutters under his breath, but gives no other sign. He knows Keorn too well to feel stung by the insult on Keorn's behalf... he is merely mildly exasperated at the Hawk suitor's seeming arrogance.

Tilara says, "There is a prophecy among your people which we think is appropriate to the moment. 'A Man will come, and bear a dagger. His companions will come, and some will stagger. None shall fall, and none shall Change, And all that comes to them be strange, For the lack of wisdom left unshared, Have left this party unprepared. Let the Maiden choose, Let the Suitors loose, Children should not suffer. The elders are tougher.'"

"Whatever comes up, I wish you to swear on your honor that you will not raise a hand against another Suitor, nor Companion, nor other being, in the trials that follow, except to defend your very life. Keorn will swear this, as will the Elks." Ash stiffens, drawing up his courage and bravery to speak the next words. "Tradition is a shackles, when it is followed blindly. A brave man will not hesitate to step beyond it when he sees the wisdom of doing so. Nor will a wise man step forward blindly on the advice of strangers and the companions of a rival. I ask you to consider my words." He gestures to the assembled weapon. "Your strength is not in those swords. Your strength is in the men who wield them. Changers who bicker and slay each other are weak. Changers who cooperate, who inspire their fellows to follow them, are strong." And with this, he waits.

Behind Morunin, the youngest of the men steps forward, one hand on sword, the other one his dagger. He looks intently at Andreth, and caresses both pommels. His eyes are black as night, matched by his hair and palest features. When Tilara speaks he looks at her in turn. "Drivel", he snorts. "Drivel spoken by a child."

Tilara says, "Is it? Then why do the Elders preserve it?"

Holding up a hand, Morunin stills the young man behind him. He looks thoughtfully at Ash. "What will this gain me? What wisdom do you offer?" He looks around his tent. "My dagger bearer will surely present his dagger to Samaela. What risks should I accept; I need but survive until he has dealt with the children."

"You will gain respect," answers Ash. "You will gain respect you cannot earn with shows of power or prowess in war. Rather than merely being a successful Suitor, you will become one who has EARNED the right to be ruler of the Changers - should you be chosen. You will demonstrate bravery and compassion, two qualities that make the Emperor of the Flatlands a beloved ruler to his people. And," he adds with a smile, "a man of bravery asks not of the risks he might face. He asks of the rewards, which you did first and foremost."

Morunin looks intently at Ash. "You speak well, young man. You must have a gift." His lips twist. "What will this wisdom cost? Will you seek to rule from behind the throne?" He looks at the men behind him. "We will not agree to that, youngling. We ... I ... will brook no interference from outsiders."

Ash shakes his head. "What we gain is... not power. It is satisfaction." He says nothing more, letting the Suitor puzzle this through.

Tilara shakes her head. "We have no interest in trying to rule the Changers through their chief. We offer advice - the first half of that prophecy could easily mean us, and the second half seems to suggest cooperation rather than conflict as a way to improve on your traditions. We have had ... some small success by breaking with tradition. It may be beneficial to the Changers as well." She grins. "Besides, being the power behind the throne here would seem to be a rather frustrating task even if we wanted to."

Morunin looks intently at Tilara ... then smiles very very slowly. "We will not strike the first blow." He looks at the man behind him. "We will however strike the second, and the third. And the last."

Ash nods. "As long as none begin hostilities, we are satisfied. We do not ask you to sacrifice your life for our ideals. We have not earned the right to demand such a thing."

Tilara grins, and bows. "If it comes to that, may the best man win, and your traditions will continue as they have. We do not ask for more." She straightens up. "By your leave, then? We needs must talk to the Cats yet tonight."

Morunin nods. "Enjoy. Kalaecian is ever a ... gracious host."
