The party confers, gathering together in whispered discussion. Winds blow and breath is taken and released as the White Company speaks within its own membership. At last, Tilara rises, clearing her throat and addressing the crone, and Samaela. "We're ready."

The crone looks at Tilara. "Speak, then, and pose your test." Samaela, behind her, looks attentive, her head cocked to one side as the young woman studies the party intently.

Tilara walks over to the crone, beckoning her closer and speaking softly. "Do the tests need to be witnessed by all, or can they be done privately?"

The crone pauses. "The tests must be announced publicly. They are performed privately. The results are presented to all, that all may know, and all may hear."

Tilara nods. "Part of the test is that the suitors must not know all of it ahead of time... I think we can do this. Your mages can cast sleep spells, of course?"

The crone chuckles. "Yes. Of course." She looks at the party. "The lady speaks for all of you? If so, step forward, and state the public portion of the test that all should know. And then come, and we will confer with the shamans who shall make it come to pass, and with Samaela, who will be the judge."

The exact parameters of the test are, of course, a secret for only Samaela and the administrator of the Trial. What the Suitors are told is this: they will have a certain time limit in which to speak to Samaela, in an isolated area. They will be put to sleep beforehand and awaken when it is time, and finally, they are told that a good Suitor will try to understand what his proposed mate wishes to hear about, for her choice is what will decide this test.

Three of the suitors glower, as they slowly absorb the unclear parameters of the test. Only the youngest, the Elk Suitor, seems relieved. Atfer all, only recently has he reached the stage where he can speak, rather than being reduced to a simple listener, so this test sounds not too onerous to him. And the more tests he passes, the longer ... the longer he lives.

The secret of the trial is further explained, in strictest confidence, after every assurance against eavesdropping (whether mundane or arcane) has been provided. Each of the Suitors is to be put to sleep, and awakened only after an illusion has been placed on him - an illusion that will suggest to him that he has been bodily switched with another Suitor. For example, Keorn may look at his own hands and listen to his own voice and conclude that he has switched bodies with (for example) the Elk Suitor. For Samaela's part, the task is easy - convince the Suitor that Samaela too sees the body that the illusion projects, rather than the man himself, and to almost casually mention that she wishes to hear about the man she sees.

The Suitor who presents himself as the illusion dicates, and convinces Samaela of the worthiness of himself and his advances, will emerge the winner in this contest. The Suitor who presents himself as who he knows himself to be will be laughed at; if he refuses to accept what his bride-to-be insists on telling him, and presses his own suit, he loses. And the reason? In Ash's words, "Wits is you and the world coming to an agreement. The sooner you and it settle up, the faster you get your real business done."

The four Suitors are led away, into four separate alcoves, where the murmur of spellcasting can be heard momentarily. Samalea and the crone retreat to a fifth, larger alcove. One with a curtain. Nothing can be heard from beyond the alcove, but as time passes each of the Suitors is lead into this fifth alcove. The more observant spectators notice that the Suitors seem to have switched alcoves, but no comments are made by the crowd, who remain unnaturally silent.

After the last Suitor emerges from the fifth alcove, and is lead back to his own, the four carriers are summoned to Samaela's alcove. All four enter, the two older ones frowning at Anstar and Jellin. After a few minutes, three emerge. Only Jellin stays behind, and again, more time passes. Platters are sent around with cakes, and flagons of wine are passed along the ranks; the crone herself presents food and wine to the company.

Tilara waits nervously, even though things seem to be going well. She's not pacing, but Mirra is doing it for her.

Starguard eyes the larger alcove nervously, as he notes that Jellin still hasn't emerged. As the crone passes by and offers refreshment, he can contain his worry no longer, and asks: "Why is it that Jellin has not left the tent? Can you tell us?"

The crone smiles. "Jellin ... No. Wait and see." Even as she answers, Jellin exits the alcove, his (her) hand in Samaela's, the other holding the Elk dagger high. The crone looks at Samaela as she approaches, then turns back to the White Company. "The Elk Suitor has carried the first test."

Ash nods slowly, not entirely surprised. Though his natural loyalties lie with Keorn, the big man can't envision the gruff woodsman as being the fastest-thinking man alive. Still, a smile does creep over his face as he imagines the various hypothetical reactions of the Cat Clan Suitor.

Tilara's eyebrows climb up toward her scalp. "I wasn't sure he had it in him," she mutters to her companions. "I would've thought that the Cat would've known more about his opponents, at least." She grins, even though she was feeling a bit partisan toward Anstar and Keorn.

The four Suitors look stunned, each in their own way. Keorn looks surprised, while the Cat Suitor looks furious. His face pale, his lips pulled back in the merest imitation of a smile - or perhaps a smile - he holds out his hand to the young lad, to wish him luck. "Still," Kalaecian is quick to proclaim, "this is but one test of three." The cat looks around at the other three, and snarls. "Oaths notwithstanding, the pit beckons."

Starguard breathes a deep sigh of relief, and nods to Jellin with a smile. Next to him, Andreth says nothing, his face impassive, but his eyes flicker in the direction Anstar went. Then the young monk's expression relaxes somewhat. Only one could win the Courtship, he knew that - and it is not yet decided what will happen to the losers.

The crone turns to the assembled company. "You have set the first test. The second and the third shall be as Far Hawk decrees; the Suitors and the carriers shall now enter the pit; those whom the pit releases Samaela will judge."

Ash inclines his head. "We thank you for your trust in our judgement in tests," he says, stiffly and formally.

The crone tilts her head. "We do as the prophecies command, youngling, and Far Hawk himself approved of your test. It was a worthy one." Behind her, the four Suitors, their carriers beside them, descend into the pit. Hours pass, as the crone and Samaela sit, crosslegged, waiting for someone to emerge.

Teh crowd is more restive now, as people are debating the merits of the first test, as well as arguing the likelihood of the different Suitors winning. Obviously, the lad's victory has come as a complete surprise, and murmured alliances are being reformed everywhere.

Tilara chuckles softly to herself. When the crone has left them alone again, she murmurs, "You realize that trust had little to do with it. They were testing _us_ with that request. I wonder what they thought of our solution."

Ash shrugs a little, replying calmly in turn. "They let it stand," he says softly. "Nor have we been ejected, attacked, or ensorcelled. That I know of, at least.. So, I suppose everything's as well as can be expected." He sits back in silence, smiling to himself.

Andreth eyes the pit uncertainly, shifting in his seat. "It's the waitin' that gets me," he mutters. "What's goin' on in there? I dunno, 'n I don't think anyone'll tell us. If _anyone_ knows but them as went into the pit 'emselves." He sighs heavily, and returns to watching.

As the early evening approaches, the crowd grows ever more restive. Arguments become more heated. Occasionally a fight breaks out, and is squashed by one or more of the shamans. Already several sleeping forms have been carted out of the Hall to sleep off their combativeness somewhere else.

Shortly after the sun sets, after torches have been lit, Jellin and Anstar emerge from the pit, carrying the Hawk carrier between them. The crone blinks, as she watches three emerge from the pit, but then shrugs, and signals two men forward to catch the bleeding man, and tend his wounds. Once bound up, the three are escorted to Samaela's alcove.

Tilara nods as the trio emerges, especially when the crone seems surprised. "So. We _did_ have an affect on things, I think. She wasn't expecting that. And it looks like Kalaecian may have broken his promise after all."

Ash rises instinctively, only to restore himself to his seat again as reason overcomes instinct by the barest margin. These people know what they are doing; the lessons of the White Company have been learned well, and Ash too knows that the Company has learned from the Changers. _Their ways are not our ways,_ he reflects. _They know what they will do..for our part, we must wait._

Starguard's eyebrows raise, as the three youths emerge. "So they did send more than one after all..." he remarks, smiling at the fact that both Jellin and Anstar are among them. "And they're cooperating too... well, those three are, at any rate." He glances at his companions, nodding to Tilara. "Yes... I wonder what happened to the Hawk's bearer..."

The crowd grows more restive still, several larger fights breaking out. Slower to subdue, these fights eventually end with masses of sleeping Changers, who are carried outside, leaving mangy areas in the audience, as alliances that formed were tested, and found ... overly combative.

Tilara does pace now, Mirra watching the pit for her when she isn't begging for food. "I wonder if it's supposed to take this long."

Finally the carriers emerge. Or at least, the hawk's carrier does. Jellin and Anstar are held back at the alcove door, before stepping out, each holding Samaela's hand. Samaela, in turn, raises the hand of both children, after escorting them to the center of the Hall. "Today we have two new Children. I give you my firstborn, Anstar and Jellin." Behind her, a shaman whispers in the crone's ear, and the crone pales, running frantically to reach Samaela before the Maiden finishes her pronouncement. Runs, but fails.

Andreth rubs his chin. "Well, there's a thing. Bet there's never been _two_ firstborn before. No wonder the crone's so nervous."

Tilara murmurs, "You've got that right. What d'ya think happened to the hawk boy? I believe we've just introduced the Changers to polyandry. I wonder if Samaela knows that yet."

Ash is smiling broadly as he sees just what he expected - the triumph of reasonable men over hidebound and foreign tradition. Though an avid listener of stories in his youth, up until this moment he's been convinced of the rightness of these changes, the value of the White Company's 'education' on these weird animal-men. Then his smile turns, like a waxing moon, into a look of shocked dismay as he realizes just what has been wrought here.

Starguard shakes his head, his forehead furrowing intensely. "Oh Stars... what are they going to do about _this_? She's not the dagger-bearer that was supposed to..." Then his own eyes widen in dismay to match Ash's. "S-she isn't even a Changer!" he whispers hoarsely. "The prophecy..."

Tilara looks at Ash's face, grinning - and then her face pales as well. "But - the other one is. Does this even -match- a prophecy?" Ever practical, her mind continues on with a more personal concern. "And d'you think they'll blame us for it?" She starts looking for escape routes.

The crowd stills, every eye on Samaela, even as the crone reaches her and begins to whisper frantically in her ear. Finally, samaela shrugs. Behind her, three suitors emerge from the pits. Illanan, the Elk Suitor comes first, his face battered and torn, one arm hanging awkwardly from his side. Behind him, Keorn carries new scars, still red and livid, that cross his face from brow to chin, transecting an eye that can no longer see. And on his shoulders, Keorn carries the Hawk, who lies limp, and pale, breathing but barely.

Ash doesn't hold back this time, but rises to his feet. "Starguard," he barks, "let's go." And with that, he begins moving forward, prepared if necessary to ford a sea of bodies to reach the wounded.

Starguard nods, as he watches the suitors emerge. "Still... the suitor himself is an Elk, at least, even if the bearer..." As Keorn's voice rings out, though, the needs of his new patient take precedence over all politics, and he follows close behind Ash, his healer's kit clutched tightly.

There are no bodies to ford, as the audience stills, surprise spreading in a great wave of silence through the remaining Changers. Samaela watches, here eyes narrow, as Starguard and Ash approach the wounded Suitors. Illanan sinks to one knee, and then cradles the head of the hawk, as Keorn lowers him to the ground. The three wait, watching Starguard approach.

As Starguard commences his work, Ash nods slowly. At least divinely granted health has not been withdrawn; how angry could the gods be at this deed? He directs his attention to Keorn. "Tell me this tale, friend," he says in a low voice.

Keorn looks at the White Company. "Betrayal. Kalaecian struck no blow, and threw no knife, but his magics enveloped us as we descended. His dagger struck at us from behind, as Far Hawk spoke to us. Even before the tests began, we were wounded. Kalaecian is now ... dead." He looks at the Hawk, his remaining eye narrowed in puzzlement. "He suffered the most, shielding Illanan from harm." Starguard, bending over the pale Suitor, prays quietly to his gods, before placing both hands on the Hawk's chest. Light begins to suffuse the Hall. A soft, glowing light. A healing light, that encompasses all in its warmth.

Slowly, the blood ceases to pool beneath the hawk. Illanan's arm straightens, with a pop, and the scars over Keorn's face age, and become pale, rather than the angry bleeding welts they were. Samaela watches, her hands still clutching the youngsters' hands. Then she drops Anstar's hand, and holds that of the Hawk carrier. Turning back to the audience, she holds up his hand in turn. "And now I present ... my Second born!"

Tilara nods. "He did say something about a long tradition of winning. I wonder if something was interfering with these tests all along." She grins. "I can't _wait_ to get back to the Citadel and see what the Spire's got on it now."

Andreth looks entirely non-plused by this turn of events. "_Three_ children of Samaela?" he mutters to himself. "By the Candle, I wonder what they'll make of _this_..."

Samaela catches the three carriers in her arms for a moment, before directing them to sit at her feet. The three daggers she now carries in her hand. She stoops over the wounded Suitors. To the Hawk, she returns his dagger, and kisses him on the brow. "Will you stand with me, at the wedding?" He looks up, nodding in confusion. She turns to Keorn, and looks at him for a long moment.

Tilara starts to answer, then shuts her mouth and watches the young woman. _This should be **most** interesting._

Ash blinks, then shrugs, returning his attention to the healing, and to Keorn. These things - life and death, betrayal and trust - he understands. The Courtship has always been beyond him, in some phase or aspect, and so he wait for wiser minds to convey the truth of the affair's conclusion. "Those among the Changers who value honor should be told of this," he grates. "I will offer whatever compensation tradition demands for this pain," he adds, nodding toward the downed Suitor. "This was our boon, asked of each Clan. Be it on my head, if you desire."

Keorn looks at Ash. "It will be on Kalaecian's head; if he still has one, and on the Clan of the cats." His eyes narrow. "Far Hawk was ... much bemused by your oaths." Samaela looks down at Keorn, and smiles. She leans over, and kisses him, too, on the brow as she returns his dagger. "Will you stand with me, at the wedding?" Gaining his assent, too, she turns to Illanan.

Her eyes soften, as she holds the last dagger, her hand caressing the green gem in the hilt. "Illanan; will you gift me with your dagger at the wedding?"

Gasps rise from the audience; obviously this is the most unexpected outcome of all.

Tilara grins, and Mirra purrs, leaping up to her arms to watch the proceedings with approval. _Not all three toms for her, then? Boring._

With assurances that the Suitors (and others) are in no danger of immediate death, the White Company gathers off in privacy, while the mass of Changers gathered here try to reassemble themselves into some semblance of order. A fireball dropped into the camp probably would have not caused a greater commotion, and Ash takes advantage of it as he delicately performs the ritual of calling via crystal, waiting for the Brothers of the Waters to respond.

A short pause, before the crystal activates. Not the abbot himself, of course, but his secretary, who sounds quite unamused at the lateness of the call. Certainly, his greetings are at best perfunctory.

Ash nods. "Liowen," he begins. He stops, then, bringing one callused hand to his face as he silently considers. Everything that's happened; death, life, resurrection, danger, the Emperor, the wolves and hawks... The big man's voice trembles softly as he speaks. "The Courtship is concluded, except for the wedding itself. May I trust... assume.... Is our geas lifted?" He shivers a little as the memory of blood and travel sweeps over him in waves. "Are we done?"

Liowen's voice rings out from the crysatal. "Yes. The geas is lifted. We expect a full report. Preferably written and delivered by hand, but if you call back tomorrow I can have scribes ready to transcribe your oral report."

Ash lets out a long sigh, replete with satisfaction. "It would be inconvenient for us to leave yet, so we will contact you tomorrow," he says, after a long moment. Smiling, almost boyishly, he turns to look at his fellows in the Company, making eye contact with each and sharing his unspoken satisfaction at having completed this enterprise. Though a casual matter of investigation to the testy Liowen, to him, and he suspects to those with him, it has been a much deeper chapter of life. "We'll be in touch," he says softly, and cuts communication.
