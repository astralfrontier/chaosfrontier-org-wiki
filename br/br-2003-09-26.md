Andreth crouched, completely motionless, trying to see into that faint glow of light. He didn't even waste breath cursing when the light suddenly went out, freezing instead. Moments passed. More moments. He strained to hear, but hears nothing. There's a faint musky odour, as of dogs who have laboured long and hard, and the silence is deafening.

Andreth brings himself into a fighting stance - if the kobolds can see in the dark, he wouldn't have been able to conceal himself long anyway. The lack of noise from the direction of the light is suspicious - either they are too quiet for him to hear, or they too are listening for someone's advance.

However, Andreth doubts that the kobolds will be the ones to make the first move. Instead, he suspects that the first sound he hears will be from behind - his own party members will have seen the light go out and realize that the element of surprise is lost.

The musky odour grows stronger, as though a slight breeze were carrying it to Andreth.

As Andreth begins, slowly, to retrace his steps, the odour weakens for a moment, caught in an eddy, a veritable gust almost, of air. In front of him he hears a single piece of rock skitter against a stalactite. Right behind him, almost underneath his heels, he hears the baying of a hundred wolves.

Andreth calls out in alarm, "Lights!", his voice ringing out at the top of his lungs, hoping to drown out the sound, and turns sideways, holding his ground, fully expecting to be borne down before any help arrives. Whatever is going on, he's been spotted... and he no longer trusts his ears to guide him.

Ash quickly unshutters the magic lantern he carries, setting it down and readying the Elk bow he carries. Is something there, or is this another illusion, he wonders.

Tilara mutters something pungent under her breath, and checks her equipment. "This does not bode well." She's already got her crossbow armed, and moves forward, searching for targets.

Andreth cries out again. "White Company! I been spotted!" He continues to turn in a circle, waiting for his friends to catch up to him - the wolves, if wolves they were, could be anywhere by now, as could the kobolds, if he can't hear them coming.

Ash moves forward as well, though warily enough. Trusting Tilara to observe forward, he concentrates his attention to the rear, should someone approach that way.

Andreth shakes his head. "Curses..." he says, and as he turns to rejoin the party...

... three small rocks come flying out of the darkness, hitting him about the arm and head. They land hard.

As Andreth runs back towards the rest of the company, more rocks fly out of the darkness. Most miss, but one hits him right in the middle of the chest.

Andreth skids onto his face as something goes under his foot. Barely holding onto the lantern, he scrambles to his feet. "They're between us! Watch your step!" he calls out. He slows his pace, wondering why he went so far ahead of the party without going back to bring them closer first.

Suddenly, all is silent around Andreth once more. His companions, who up until this point have been anything but quiet as the charge is on to join him, now seemingly have vanished. He can't hear them, and from his vantage point all he sees are the bobbing lights.

Ash fishes out a flask of lantern oil, shows it to Tilara briefly, then chucks it forward with all his might, aiming for the general area the rocks are coming from. "Tilara, your fire-magic!" he directs, crisply.

Starguard covers his eyes, stopping to shield from the blast of light...

Tilara stops when she sees the greasy patch, and sends a bouncing flame-ball after the flask of oil. "On it. Let's see where the little buggers are hiding."

Andreth goes off at an angle now, still at a cautious pace. No doubt the little critters have trapped the whole cave in the few minutes it took for him to leave and come back, but he hopes they'll have focused their attention on his original route.

The flask of oil explodes into a fiery nova, still in mid air, but far enough, or close enough to where Ash was aiming, that he can clearly see four small creatures. They look up at the incoming fire, and cringe away from the light, and one of them shouts out a number of crisp orders before the four split away into the darkness.

Starguard overhears the barked orders and smiles, recognizing the language. He looses a crossbow bolt at one of the fleeing figures, missing wide. "They're scattering! Probably going to try an regroup and come at us again!"

Ash fires a pair of arrows into the retreating pack, barely catching one.

The creatures fade into the darkness, disappearing almost immediately. A single yelp admits Ash's competency with the bow, but beyond that ... silence. Only the White Company is making noise now, and Andreth is moving incredibly silently.

As the party slowly moves closer to one another, Andreth moving parallel to the route he'd followed before, there's a complete lack of attacks. It's as though the entire thing had never happened. Or would be, if Andreth wasn't feeling so bruised. That sternum is really beginning to hurt. But after a few more moments the party is within visual range.

Andreth cups his hands around his mouth, and his companions can see his lips move. Then, "...some kinda silence! Don't come a... oh..." he says, shaking his head, and walking forward. "Damn' li'l buggers work fast, don't they?" he says, as he approaches. "Last time I go off that far ahead, I tell you."

Starguard frowns, whispering to the party what he overheard. "They said something about regrouping in 'the tunnel', whereever that is. They're smart little buggers."

Tilara says, "I wish they were smart enough not to have annoyed that giant." She walks past where Andreth had been, to see if the silence spell is still active.

Andreth mutters. "That light musta been a trap inna first place, I'll bet," he says, quietly now that his companions are close enough to hear. "Next time, we all get a lot closer afore I go off alone. I ain't havin' half a huge cave between me 'n my support again." He sighs. "Brother Starguard, you got an idea where we should go next?"

Tilara whistles as she tests the zone of silence, but there is no sudden interruption. "Quick spell, whatever it was. It's already gone. So, let's go find where their escape route is, shall we?"

Tilara says, "Mirra, can you follow them?"

Starguard grumbles. "I hate walking into a trap, though. Perhaps we could lay our own ambush?"

Mirra sidles up close to her mistress, the scent of sweating dogs clear in her mind. There's a mild overlay of a coppery smell, probably blood. She looks quite satisfied though, and projects the conviction that she can easily trap at least the one.

Tilara says, "No good laying an ambush if we don't know their patterns. Mirra says she can track the wounded one easily. Shall we?"

Andreth nods. "Yeah, but take it slow. Their bolt hole'll be solid traps by t'time we get to it."

Starguard says, "Alright. Just nervous and all. They've got terrain and home advantages."

Tail in the air, her bearing proud, Mirra leads the way. Her nose wrinkles, a little, and her whiskers quiver, but the occasional drop on the cavern floor seems to suggest she's on the right track. A track that circles back, and around the party, finally leading to a blank cavern wall. Mirra stops, confused. The trail suddenly vanishes.

Tilara looks up and around. "So, did they have a rope to climb? Or is this an illusion?"

Andreth sighs, grumbling, as a few minutes of groping around on the wall turn up nothing. Then he winces and turns to Starguard. "Brother, those little critters gave me quite the beatin' out there. Think y'could help me out a bit?"

Starguard nods, embaressed that he let the healing pass so long, and lays his hands on Andreth's form, dealing with part of his wounds. "Sorry. It's a deep bruise. They're tough to heal completely."

Turning back to the trail's end, Starguard takes a second, closer, longer look. It takes a while to find what he's looking for, but finally, he spots the finest of fine lines in the rock. A small barely natural niche, at about the height of his knee. He slides his knife in, carefully, and jiggles it, and the rock pivots away from him, perfectly counterbalanced so that his eating knife alone can control the motion.

Slowly and carefully, Starguard pushed the secret door all the way open. He has to bend low to do this, the door is only three feet hight, and about as wide. The tunnel beyond is no bigger, and seems to curve sharply almost immediately, making it difficult to see what lies beyond. Still, there's one drop of blood visible on the tunnel's floor ...

Mirra nudges Tilara. _More dogs. Stronger smell._

Ash reaches down to touch the blood, intent on ascertaining whether it's fresh enough to come from the creature he winged.

Starguard shakes his head. "No way," he mutters quality. "We'd be sitting ducks."

Tilara says, "Aye. They're down there, though, Mirra can smell 'em."

Ash nods in agreement. "They went this way. We must not."

Stormy looks at Tilara and Ash. "But then ... how?"

Tilara says, "Close it up, let them think we didn't find it. Or seal it so it can't be opened. No point in doing anything else."

Ash nods. "Mirra will stay here, to warn us should it open again. If this is the only way beyond, then we are safe enough with this warning. And if it is not the only way, then we have found what we seek. So let's look."

Starguard says, "Sounds good. Let's get the little buggers."

Tilara says, "Doesn't sound all that good to _us_. This place is too open to leave her behind like that."

Ash shrugs. "Then Mirra survives, and we are stabbed in the back instead. As you like. But let's look anyway."

Starguard says, "I hate this. We never had to look for the Lurinorians on the front. They'd find us..."

Tilara says, "We definitely need to look around." She grins at Starguard. "What, you never scouted for ambushes or set one yourself?"

Starguard says, "Well, it was a rather formal war. They raided, we counter attacked."

Moving away from the one secret door the party has found, and moving around the periphery of the cave, the going is not easy. There are no obvious paths here, and the floor of the cavern is anything but even. Even so, some of the rocks jutting up seem a little more regular than they should. As Andreth puts his hand on one, he feels it shift the smallest bit.

Andreth coughs, and waves over his allies, indicating the moving rock. "This thing moves. Could be a trap, o'course. Anyone got any ideas how we c'n tell?"

Starguard says, "Ten foot pole would work. Too bad we don't have one."

Andreth hrms. "Not if the trap's more'n ten feet wide." He turns to Starguard. "Hey, didn't ya summon a badger back when we saw Stormy get stuck in that trap back in Citadel?"

Starguard nods. "I can do it again...though the poor badger..."

Tilara says, "Hardly seems nice. Why not just pitch a rock at it?"

Ash sighs. "Fine. Cats and badgers, let's all protect them." He waves everyone back, and just moves the rock himself, impatiently.

The rock slides easily out of the way, pivoting horizontally. Beneath it, a hole, perhaps two, three feet wide stretches downwards, small rungs set along one side.

Ash nods, satisfied, and begins to descend, a light-source kept at the ready.

Starguard heys. "Wait a sec, Ash. Now's the time for an animal."

Moving slowly but steadily, ash soon disappears into the hole, which drops straight down for some distance. At least forty of the rungs, before his foot touches ground once more and he finds himself standing in a smaller cave, lichens on the walls glowing brightly by his light.

Slowly turning around, Ash finds himself in what looks like a central hallway. There are six openings, two of them open, showing black tunnels beynd, the others covered by hanging lichens.

Ash dutifully crawls back up, beckoning without speaking once he sees a friendly face. Once the message is passed on, he carefully descends once more, and draws his blade at the bottom.

Andreth wriggles down the passage after him, and waves for silence after everyone is down, listening hopefully for a moment for the sounds of our quarry - or indeed anything that would help us choose one tunnel over another.

Tilara follows Ash down, with Mirra riding in her pack as usual. Once down, she mrrs at her familiar. _Smell anything interesting?_

The cat sneezes once, daintily, as she strays a little close to one of the curtains. _Musty. Is all musty._

Tilara takes her half-spear from its carrying sling and pokes at one of the vines. "Air coming through here," she whispers.

The vines part easily. Upon closer observation, they form a curtain, the lichenous appearance created by the lichen growing down the length of the rope. Behind it, a tunnel stretches, turning a little ...

Ash carefully parts the lichens with the tip of his weapon, apparently intent on heading forward to investigate the air flow. He keeps his own light shining, not yet willing to abandon sight for the sake of stealth.

Moving past the curtain, Ash finds that the tunnel extends quite some way, twisting a little as though following a natural fissure. The lichen grows thickly on the wall. Eventually, the tunnel widens, into a circular room where mushrooms grow in banks of earth. A whistle of air comes from a vent overhead.

Moving back to the central hallway, Ash leads the way through the curtain into the next tunnel. Again, lichen grows in profusion, until eventually they reach another circular room. More mushrooms. Bigger ones. Much bigger ones.

Ash nods appraisingly, eyeing the familiar features of this tunnel. "Starguard," he murmurs, as low as he can manage and still carry words through the slick air of the caverns. "As a healer, what do you make of these?"

Starguard hmms. "They're edible. But they're be some side effects."

Tilara says, "Side effects?"

Starguard says, "Yeah. Like seeing colors and lights. Very funky mushrooms."

Starguard says, "Not the same type as before, though. These might be shaman mushrooms, or something similar."

Moving into the third tunnel, one of the two that lacks a curtain, the passage begins to widen quickly, and soon turns into another similar little hall, with curtained tunnels on both sides.

The curtained tunnels hide more mushrooms, a different variety in each room. The further tunnel leads to a third hallway.

Tilara says, "Definitely someone's farm, here. The little fellows, d'you think? Or something else?"

Ash shrugs. "Who else would be here? This is accessed via a mechanism of sophistication, like the doors."

Andreth rubs his chin. "Seems their kinda food too, I guess. Lessee what else they got down here."

Starguard says, "I'm beginning to think they were here long before the giant family."

Ash says, "I'm beginning to agree with you."

Moving further down the tunnel, the party reaches yet another wider area. This time, though, there are the usual four curtained tunnels, a continuation of the current tunnel, and a small wooden door. From behind it, the party can hear a faint moan.

Ash shrugs, walking forward with his weapon out. He balances the greatsword carefully using one arm, and opens the door cautiously with the other.

Beyond, in a small room, two of the smaller creatures lie on pallets. The one is bandaged from head to toe, recognizable mostly by his size, while the other has one eye covered, and its hand keeps gripping spasmodically at its blanket. It's the one that moaned.

Ash puts his weapon down slowly, then points back at Starguard and beckons quickly.

Starguard moves forward, listening. His eyes go to Ash, wondering if conversation or listening is in order.

Ash hunkers down in the doorway, enough that another could pass him by, but obviously intending to act as a sort of warden for the moment. "Heal them," is his only directive.

Starguard enters, coming in front of the two...and places his hands on the less wounded one, ready to call the healing power of the Stars.

Slowly, the moaning comes to a halt, the hand relaxing on the cover, as the creature slips into a natural healing sleep, the glow of Starguard's magic encasing it for a few moments more ...

Moving to the second creature, Starguard concentrates, calling on all the gifts his gods have given him. Slowly, the glow spreads from his hands, encasing the creature. The bandages slowly begin to seep, nasty yellow liquids pushing through the gaps. The smell of gangrene intensifies.

Starguard says, "Yuck. Pretty bad..."

Andreth, being unfamiliar with the nature of healing serious and old wounds, wrinkles his nose, and glances at Starguard. "Did you make him better or worse?" he asks.

Starguard says, "Well, it was a healing spell, so I assume so..."

Tilara gags. "Either it's not working on him, or that sort of thing is pushed out of the body as the spell works. That's rank."

Unwrapping the bandages, Starguard notices that the pus and other liquids seem to lie on top of healthy looking skin. Amazingly healthy looking skin, all things considered. Completely pink. As the bandages are removed, the stench moves with them. Moving to wipe away the worst of it, Starguard finds that his magic has worked its usual healing, but ... the creature is still extremely weak. It was only a few hours away from Ungfallen's Hall, it appears ...

Ash glances back to inspect the situation and nods, apparently satisfied. "Now we wait," he says, simply.

Starguard cleans up what he can, discarding the bandages, tossing it out into the hall.

An hour passes, and more, the time moving slowly while the two creatures sleep. Both are now obviously in the grip of a healing sleep; a natural reaction to the sudden removal of the pain they must have been feeling pretty constantly. Everything is quiet, everyone still waiting, when a light shines down one of the tunnels. A small, timorous light, carried by a small creature carrying a large sack. She steps into the hallway, and then stops, surprised by the rags. She doesn't scream, she just looks for a moment, completely confused.

Ash smiles, but doesn't show teeth. He asides to Starguard, "say this: Your friends have been healed by us."

Starguard nods, and repeats it, switching into the correct language, voice calm, steady.

The creature looks up, noticing Starguard. It jumps back about a foot, holding the sack behind its back. "You ... they ..." Then it straightens, pulling the bag forward. "You are a healer, tall one?"

Starguard nods. "I am. A good thing. Your friends have good aim with a rock."

The creature shrugs. "We defend ourselves from tall ones."

Starguard says, "We didn't come looking for a fight. Just to talk, first. We were ambushed."

The creature looks at Starguard. "You don't look hurt. We didn't do much damage?"

Starguard says, "You did. I'm a very good healer." He shrugs, turning to Ash, switching languages. "It's listening. What do you want to say?"

Ash frowns in thought. Then he nods, as though settling on a plan. "Tell that .. creature... to come see with its own eyes what we have done, and that we will stand where it wishes, in sight, without interference. Then tell it we wish to parlay, and learn."

Starguard says, "It's ready to parlay as it is. But I will invite it to come look." He turns back to the creature. "Do you want to check your wounded? We will go where you ask while you do."

The creature nods, sliding past everyone, almost insanely certain that nobody will try to hurt it. Almost as if it's a medic, and knows that no sane creature hurts the medic. Once inside the room, it checks both creatures, checking for non-existent fevers, sniffing at the wounds, and taking their pulse. Then it steps back outside the room again, bundling the fouled bandages in a spare bandage. "They are both healing well. I thought Irinon would not last the candle."

Starguard says, "He wouldn't have, I think. The infection had set in."

The creature nods. "Yes. It set in too deep. You must have ... powerful herbs." Its eyes narrow. "Or powerful magic."

Starguard shrugs. "Both. The stars show favour on me. But we come to talk, not ensorcel."

The creature nods, still holding the bundle. "So I ... see. I thank you for Irinon and Trinurinon." It looks at Starguard. "But why do you wish to talk to me?"

Starguard says, "Not so much you specifically, as who makes the decisions for your group."

The creature nods, shrugging. "Very well. Ir will want to speak to you." It turns around, and heads back down the tunnel.

Starguard follows behind, relating the conversation to the group. "I find it odd that these creatures speak Firstborn," he says at the end. "They're as smart as we are."

Following the creature, the party retraces its steps, passing through a number of the mushroom farm hallways. Finally it turns into a wider tunnel, where the ceiling is noticeably higher. Beyond, the sound of voices, all speaking the language of the Firstborn, Then the tunnel turns one last time, and the creature stops at the threshold of a large cave, where dozens of the creatures obviously live. Some are gathered in rooms - narrow shelves cut out of the rock wall - while others are turning mushrooms, lichen, and the like into meals near a camp fire.

Silence slowly spreads outwards from the threshold, as the White Company is spotted. The creature shrugs, and steps forward to speak to an older much larger creature, that stands easily four feet tall. Or would, if it wasn't missing both legs below the knee. "Ir. They healed Irinon and Trinurinon, who now sleep."

Ash observes the hesitation, then steps closer to Starguard, directing him again in translation duties: "We healed the two we found to show our intention. We wish to speak, and learn. We were asked by the two tall creatures who live above in the cave to come kill you. But it is not clear that you are in the wrong, so we wish to learn."

Ir nods, once, and motions the medic to step aside, and for Starguard to take a step closer. Then he points at Ash, motioning him forward too. He subjects both fighters to a long and thorough appraisal, before nodding once, slowly. "We have more wounded," he points out. "Will you heal them too?"

Ash turns to Starguard, shrugging a little. "That's between you and them."

Starguard translates, but is already nodding. "To the best of my abilities."

Ir nods at the creature, who tugs at Starguard's sleeve, before leading the way into a smaller cave beyond the large one. Here a number of pallets lie, with patients in every one of them. Large numbers of very pregnant mothers, a few children with high fevers and broken bones, and a number of warriors, who look as though theyve been gored and trampled. No smell of gangrene though.

Starguard is shocked by the number of patients. "So many...what happened here? How many are you total?"

The creature shrugs. "Birth is hard. Fever struck. And the tunnels ... Something in the tunnels."

Starguard translates both halves to Ash, before asking he be taken to the worst patient. "I will attempt to translate as I work, but you Ir, and Ash here are the ones who need to talk."

Ash hums in thought, then addresses Tilara. "Can Mirra take a message back to the kids?"

The worst of the patients is actually a small group of creatures, all cuddled up together, all of them feverish. They seem almost bonded, each crying out if it becomes even barely separated from the others. The medic sighs. "Litter fever."

Tilara says, "If you can write it and tie it to her, sure."

Ash nods in reply to Tilara. "We ought to do so. I should wonder if their hosts will think favorably of us consorting with the enemy, so advise them to be discreet."

Moving from bed to bed, Starguard calls upon the Stars time and again, calling forth their healing power. When his magics are drained, he digs into his herbs, seeking to reduce fevers, staunch wounds, prevent the onset of gangrene. At the creature's side he spends a long time, steadily working his way down the infirmary, dealing with the kids.

Tilara says, "I didn't have the impression that the giants were all that bright. Discretion should be adequate."

Finally, the creature leads Starguard b ack to Ir, who has spent the intervening time offering drink and food to the other members of the party. Much of this offering has happened via the ancient art of pantomime, of course.

Ash greets the returning combat-medic cordially enough. "If you aren't too tired," he says, "eat something, then translate for us? There's a lot we have to learn, still."

Tilara says, "I'm picking up a few words, I think... but it's not going to do much more than get me directions to the privy."

Starguard nods. "I can wait for food and water. You two talk, and I'll translate back and forth." He says the same to Ir, perhaps a little more formally, in Firstborn.

Ir pauses, looking at Ash, and then at Starguard, who looks quite tired, and a tad worn out. Then he calls out to a creature, who shambles for us. "Urnan has the gift of tongues. If you will permit, she will teach you Firstborn, though the effect will not last."

The creature turns to each of the company in turn; a laying of the hand on brow, after the company member stoops down to her reach, and the mumbling of a few words. There is power in her touch, power in her words, and power charging through the air as the spell settles into the minds of the company.

Ash nods his assent.

Ir smiles, as the spell catches hold. "Now we can talk, and eat, and be merry. Our children, healer, thank you."

Ash nods, and opens with his first few, and perhaps the most obvious questions: "How long have your people been here? And from where did they have the knowledge of stonework and magic?"

Starguard nods. "I'm glad to be of help," he says, before taking a bit of the food and drink for himself to relax, his mind still on some of the patients.

Ir shrugs. "We have been here since my father's mother's father's earliest memories. Possibly longer than that. We have always known the ways of stone, and some of us have known the ways of magic. Sometimes, teachers come, and share with us their wisdom, and sometimes our younglings go out, to share with others."

Ash nods slowly. "Teachers of your own kind, not strangers like us?"

Tilara says, "Or perhaps both?" She sighs. "The giants are not at all civilized, I fear. Have you been dealing with them for a long time?"

Ir nods. "Of course. We do not travel with the tall ones ... Not very often." He turns to Tilara. "They have been here since my father's mother's time. But we must move up, or die, and he hunts us. So ... we will hunt him."

Ash asks a slightly more direct question, "what is it your people need most, that you do not have?"

Ir shrugs, then pauses. "We have always lived down below, where the tallest ones did not notice our existence. but now that our bottom most tunnels are fouled by great monsters ..."

Tilara says, "Ah. _That_ is the problem, then."

Ash nods slowly, listening. "Describe them as best you can?"

Ir pauses, collecting his thoughts. "We know little; few of our people survive the encounters. They carry great tusks in their mouths, and they run like the wind, carrying death before them. They hunt us, and feast on our flesh."

Ash nods slowly. "We are already obligated to two young ones, and we must guide them to a holy place. But we must resolve this matter between you and the giant before we leave. Will you indulge us a few minutes? We will speak in your tongue amongst yourselves, so that you know our counsel."

Ir nods. "Certainly. For the tall one who has healed our children, we can do no less."

The party debates heavily for several minutes, dutifully speaking in the acquired (or in Starguard's case, second) language that they share with their unusual hosts. Minutes of silent prayer from the warrior-priest follow. At last Starguard, Ash and Tilara present the bulk of their offer to Ir: In half a week, the worship of the Stars can be spread throughout the community of creatures here, provided that the recipients of the divine blessing agree to an oath, sworn on the Stars to whom worship will be given: That they respect the giant family above, working when it will not be disruptive, and respecting boundaries of consideration just as the stars disappear at the boundary of morning, and reappear at dusk.

Ir pauses, his head tilted, as he listens to internal voices. Then he nods, once. "If we can regain our homes, we will work where the tallest ones do not even know we exist. All will be as it always was, though we will speak more of the Brother and the Sister than we have in generations past."

Ash requests a guide from Ir, then invites Tilara and Stormy to join him in returning to the uppermost caves, leaving Andreth and Starguard behind to briefly explain the rudiments of tall-one religion. Perhaps they in turn will learn a few surprising things from these strangely knowledgeable creatures. But whatever they might find out, muses Ash to himself, only half of the party's obligation has been satisfied. The giant's assent, and the safety of the two children, now rise to occupy his thoughts, as he and the others begin walking.
