Hiding in the shadows, taking advantage of the dark, the invisible adventurers waited as the door slipped open under Tilara's deft work with lockpicks. The door opened outwards a foot, allowing her to slip inside.

The silence broken by a whispered cuss, Tilara growled about the tripwire that she had just tripped.

Tilara whispers, "Real quick decision. Do we go on and try to close it up so it looks like the thread broke on its own, or do we back off?"

Tilara checks the back of the door and notes that the lock can be used from either side. "I say we go on. Quickly, before someone comes to investigate."

A rough sigh in the darkness sounds like Andreth's voice. "They'd be expectin' someone inside, d'you think? Mebbe we should hide near th'door an' wait for the guard to check. But we'd haveta reset the lock first."

Zinzer mutters, "We have to go now. It will only be harder next time."

Zinzer mutters, "But let's do it fast, it won't take long for someone to investigate."

Tilara says, "We don't have that much time left on the spells, Andreth. We've used up about half of the duration as it is. Everyone, go through, quick. I'll lock the door behind us."

Thinking carefully, Ash recalls caravaners, guards and others, who would slip away and have a drink when none were paying attention. "Leave a wineskin here," he hisses. "Splash a bit around, then set the skin down. Let them conclude what they will."

Zinzer takes out his precious flask of whiskey and spills some on the ground, dropping the flask just inside the door. "We should still get moving," he mutters.

Tilara says, "It's worth a try." She works on the lock while Ash arranges the scene. "Let's get going."

Scouting ahead, Mirra moves slowly into the darkness while everyone crowds around the door. _Large room. Open. Staircase._ She sniffs a little. _No humans._

Tilara listens to her familiar, and nods, though no one can see her. "Light."

The company is standing in a large room, the base of a tower. The staircase is circling both upwards and downwards, and a few shelves line the walls, most holding small chests. The room feels deserted; there are no windows, and no evidence that anyone has been here in some time.

Zinzer mutters, "This doesn't look right..."

Moving towards the dustfree staircase, the party quickly makes its way downwards, reaching the first floor which consists solely of a narrow hallway, with a door on either side, before continuing downwards again.

Tilara whispers, "I heard a chain rattling. Quietly, folks."

The locks on the doors are simple bolts here. Secured from the outside, and unreachable from the inside.

Zinzer mutters, "Tripwire on the left door, about a foot up. I think that's our cue. Can we gimmick it?"

Tilara says, "I can give it a shot..."

After carefully sliding the bolt to the side, Tilara nudges the door open, keeping a careful eye open for further traps but spotting none. She does spot a man lying on a comfortable pallet, his eyes open as he watches the moving door intently.

The man is dressed in clothes that were once rich, and while torn, are still warm and fine. His eyes are narrowed, the scar across his face pulling his expression off kilter and making him look more cynical than he might be. Then again, perhaps not. After all, he is a prisoner, with chains around his wrists and ankles. He pushes himself to a sitting position. "Greetings. Welcome to Changer's Bane."

As Zinzer crowds into the doorway, he looks intently around the room. There's no distinct magical aura; no magical objects to detect. And yet, the man himself is glowing in a way Zinzer has never encountered before.

Tilara's voice comes out of the open air. "The -real- Marrinen, I presume?"

A short smile. "Yes."

Zinzer mutters, "Tilara... his aura..."

Tilara says, "Hmm?" She casts her own cantrip, comparing what she sees to what her own aura looks like under her own spell of changed appearance.

Looking down at herself, Tilara saw the waving glow of the invisibility glamour; a definite aura, and a far cry from the glow that surrounds this Marrinan.

Another voice breaks the stillness of confinement; Ash comes up near Tilara, speaking over what he guesses is her shoulder. "Marrinan, we need to leave with you. Is there anything barring us from doing so? And, should you know, why are you and your boy free of the plague?"

Tilara moves to the chains, inspecting them quickly - she's hoping there's a lock to open, not a bolt or a forged link.

Marrinan looks up at the second voice. "We may find our way somewhat hampered by Firion and his compatriots. They have found your whiskey ... a waste of a good year ... and while Firion has sent for the captain, his two commanders keep watch by the door." He leans forward a little, anticipating Tilara's moves, and holding up his wrists. "Locks, but good ones. I haven't been able to pick them yet, and that's with years of practice."

Zinzer flattens himself against the wall and crouches, watching back up the stairwell towards the door where the first tripwire was.

The warrior makes a quick deduction. "You're aware of troop movements and the fort's layout," he concludes. "You'll guide us out, and help us avoid the soldiers."

Zinzer yelps, "Hey, how can he know all of that?"

Marrinan nods. "I will, but only after we've defeated Firion. If we can bring those three down, then my men will recapture the fort. But while those three roam free, I am better off here where they think me harmless."

Andreth's voice whispers softly. "An' Firion may have the key on 'im, too. Prob'ly easier to get the key offa him than pick these locks." He pauses. "Which ain't sayin' much."

Tilara fumbles at the lock, quite unsuccessfully. "Well, crap. Here..." She hands the fellow her lockpicks. "Maybe you can do better than I can, with proper tools... Firion and which other two? We can try, if we know where we're looking."

"Tell us where Firion is, then," asks Ash softly. "We'll do what we can, but I'm afraid we're ill-equipped to deal with a superior sorcerer."

Andreth has another thought. "What o' his wizard? Where's 'e? Or can 'e hide himself from... from whatever it is ye see with."

Zinzer says, "Let's make the question simpler - if you're not going to help us take them out, how do you propose we proceed?"

Marrinan pauses, intent. "His compatriots. A mage and a cleric. They're both at the top of the staircase, outside the door. They're debating, I think. Firion has just stalked off." He smiles. "Must be something the captain drank, again." He smiles. "I will always be glad they locked me up in _this_ cell. If you act now, you can ambush them; decoy them down here, then ambush them. That leaves only Firion, and you'll have advance warning of his arrival, too."

Zinzer says, "Why? What's in the other cell, we could hide in it."

Marrinan nods. Some of you should hide in the other cell; this one would be too crowded otherwise."

A brief dry chuckle. "Luckily, I'm Firion's only guest, now that Marlin has flown the Fort, so you won't find much company in the other cell."

Andreth coughs softly. "I think I should go get their attention. I bet I c'n outrun 'em, and they'll have a harder time pegging me wi' a spell than they will any of the rest of ya."

"We do this thing for you," he begins, "Do you promise to explain to us what in Hades is going on?"

Marrinan nods at the disembodied voice. "Come the morning, when Firion lies shackled, I will have your answers for you."

Zinzer says, "One last question, then. Do you know who we are, and why we are here?"

Marrinan shakes his head. "I do not know who you are, no. You are not Firion, which is a start, and Marlin has sworn to you."

"Lend me your lantern, then, Tilara." hisses Andreth. "An' get yerself ready. We'll have company soon." The hooded lantern rests on the floor but a moment, before the hood closes of its own accord, and then the whole vanishes again. Quiet footsteps head toward the staircase, headed back toward the entrance to the tower.

As he approaches the door, Andreth checks his footsteps, using the Walk of the Oak Leaves so that he'll not give himself away before he's ready. Taking a quiet breath to center himself, Andreth reaches out to the door's lock. The lock grinds metallically as the bolt slides back, and Andreth waits for just a breath... then, as if he'd heard something outside, his footsteps resound, audible now, headed back for the stairwell...

Behind him, a cry, as a young female hears the bolt slide back. Swearing, she slams the door open, and runs straight into the stairwell, her partner behind her. "Quick!"

Tilara hears the running feet. "Is he luring the right people, Marrinen?"

Marrinan nods. "They're coming down now."

Tilara nods to herself and readies her sword. _I've got one shot at this..._

Tilara waits as Andreth's footsteps go past the cells, and moves to the door. When she hears him yell "NOW!" she swings it open and stabs her sword at the nearest opponent!

Zinzer places a hand on Ash and mutters an incantation, mystically increasing the warrior's strength. "There. Bring them your reaper!"

Tilara swears as she blinks back into visibility, having merely glanced her blade off armor. "You owe us our crystal back."

Ash's strike is more effective; he comes through the door, crouched low, chopping down once and up after with his greatsword, using the "tunnel tactics" he learned from his father's half-brother, half a lifetime ago. His gauntlets give him power; Zinzer's spell gives him more.

As the cell doors burst open and Tilara and Ash set upon their foes, the glowing lantern pauses at the foot of the stairwell, then bobs swiftly back toward the melee. Footsteps rush forward, and suddenly a gnarled fist appears from thin air, whistling through the air directly toward the robe-garbed woman in front of the now-visible Andreth.

The cleric leans out of the way just in time, but she still finds herself face-to-face with an angry-looking, ugly-looking, bescarred monk of the Oak. "I hate bein' double-crossed," Andreth growls.

Tilara finds a chink in the woman's armor as she dodges the monk, and slides her sword into it. "That goes double for me."

Zinzer quickly steps out of the cell and flattens himself against the wall in the room with the melee, preserving his invisibility, waiting for an opportunity to support with sorcery or skullduggery.

The greatsword is a weapon made to hack through plate armor. It's a weapon of the battlefield, used against armored knights - like the cleric, with her full plate. Ash strikes once, then draws back quickly and striking a hard and telling blow against her arcane companion.

Andreth watches, stoically with a slight twinge of regret, as the woman of the gods falls lifelessly to the floor before for him. But he doesn't let it stop him from stepping past her lifeless body and swinging a _ki_\-charged fist toward her still-standing companion.

Taking a single step back, the mage disengages from the combat. Not that he was actively engaged, after all. Other than as a target. A little distance is a good thing. He seems to follow up on that. A little more distance is a little better thing. He keeps back up, slowly, cautiously, his hands up, and empty ...

Ash presses the space, moving closer. Should the man begin the incantations of magic, they will be his last. His greatsword waves threateningly.

Tilara says, "That's quite far enough, sirrah. We're not letting you get away. Surrender or die."

Zinzer steps out of the shadows behind the mage. He slips a dagger up against the man's throat with one hand, and catches one of his wrists with the other. "No words or funny gestures either, please. I'm very high-strung. Don't make me nervous."

Zinzer says, "Someone gag, bind, and blindfold him. Quickly, please."

_Marrinan_ Mirra's voice is urgent in Tilara's mind, calling out to her, as the old man suddenly stiffens, and then collapses on his pallet while the combat rages outside.

Zinzer feels the wind blow through his hair as a morning star sweeps overhead, missing completely. A slim, angry man winks into visibility.

Tilara swears and spins around as Mirra sounds the alarm. "Mirranen? What's happening?" She goes to his side, trying to figure out what's wrong with him. "Gods above, we don't have our healer with us... Mirranen!"

Tilara swears again... by what little she knows of healing, giving liquids to an unconscious patient is bad. _But it's a healing potion - it can't possibly **hurt** him, can it?_ She pours the bottle into the unconscious man's mouth. "C'mon, wake up..."

Zinzer, surprised very nearly out of his skull, tosses the captive mage aside and ducks back. He utters a curse in an arcane language and a sheet of electric power springs from his fingertips, narrowly missing Firion. The magical energy shatters in a wave against the far wall.

With a growl, Ash rushes forward, ignoring the downed mage's feeble attempt to trip him up. Even in the close confines of the hall, the fighter knows his weapon; the massive blade always stays forward, going for a "passing cut" rather than the long swings it's normally used for. It strikes true, and its blade comes back wet with the other man's blood. Ash is close, growling.

Pulling a large bauble from his neck, Firion glares at Andreth, and then throws the bauble at the midpoint between the two cell doors, where it explodes in a huge fireball.

Andreth flattens himself against the wall as Firion throws the exploding bauble, and although his face and the front of his clothes are blackened by soot, he escapes unharmed. "Duck!" he yells to his companions, as he pulls a tanglefoot bag from his belt and throws it in Firion's direction.

Ash shakes his head, looking a little dazed, then turns his attention on Firion. "Now you listen to me, you gutless, back-stabbing, vermin," he spits, his eyes fairly burning with fury. "You're going to tell us what you did to Marrinan, and where our crystal is, and what is going on, or you are going to start losing limbs."

Zinzer carefully examines Marrinan, after determining he's not going to immediately expire. "I'm for him losing limbs anyway, Ash. No need to be too cautious with that one."

Firion swallows once, and then swallows again, looking at the sad remains of his followers. "Marrinan is ... he is sleeping. When he is awake, he knows where I am." He tries to shrug, weakly. "As for your crystal? We left it in the Hall."

"Now, the story of what happened here," the fighter continues, his teeth gritted.

Firions blinks. "Well. Looking at the evidence, I would surmise that you ambushed us, and that my friends died quick and painless deaths."

Tilara limps out of the side chamber, looking scorched and extremely annoyed. "Which will _not_ be your fate if you persist in being clever."

Ash puts his sword over one shoulder carefully, then strikes Firion across the face with the strength-enhancing gauntlet, forged in Changer lands. "Don't be stupid," he warns the trapped man.

Ash continues. "The fort. Why did you attack us? Why is this man in the cell?"

Firion shrugs. "You'll kill me now, in any case." He looks at his friends. "At least they died quickly." He glares at Ash. "With the fort and the boy, I hold the pass, and the wars won't touch me and mine. Old Marrinan, he'll never bow the knee or open the fort, but the boy is only a boy. In time, he'll bow the knee. Or would have, if he hadn't escaped."

"You'll die when Marrinan commands it," says Ash, softly, turning to look at Tilara for a silent read on the man's condition. "For now, we're going to remove those troublesome trinkets.."

"First, verify Marrinan's condition. After that, Zinzer, search.. what's left of the mage. Andreth, get up here and help me. Tilara, the cleric. She may have additional potions, scrolls, something to help us out here," commands Ash.

Tilara murmurs the words of the cantrip again, and makes a quick search of Firion and the dead cleric. "I think Marrinan will be all right - I was just pouring a healing potion into him when that fireball hit. Let's see what's survived out here..."

Zinzer steps out of Marrinan's cell. "The wars won't touch you and yours? The wars we're trying to prevent? How do you know that they are coming?" He steps to within a foot of the mage, his face a blackened mask of soot and anger. "This war will only happen if fools like you make it happen. 'You and yours?' What about me and mine? What about everyone else in the Flatlands, or in the mountains for that matter? What of them?"

Zinzer pulls his dagger from his sheath. "It's a mistake to spare this one, for any amount of time. His kind would put us all in chains, or in the grave."

Carefully, Ash and Andreth begin to strip Firion of his most accessible baubles, rings, or anything else that holds even a hint of danger. The fighter would prefer that nothing within easy reach be present once the slippery fellow is freed further from the tangler that gloms him.

Andreth nods quietly as Zinzer's words echo his emotions, but he says nothing, instead heading up to help Ash make sure that the erstwhile foe is rid of any other gimmicks and gewgaws that might threaten the White Company or aid Firion's escape.

Tilara says, "Marinnan wanted to see him in chains, remember? We'll let him make the call."

Zinzer stands for a moment and resheathes his weapon, and then searches the blackened corpse of Firion's magician. "Insofar as my opinion counts, for him, I say, the grave."

As Tilara leans over the two corpses she strikes gold; there are a small number of potions, a magical stone and a flask of some kind of odd glue like substance, and two small scroll cases.

Firion, too, is a treasure trove of magical baubles, sporting an amulet, this interesting necklace - now missing one bead - as well as some exquisitely crafted armour, and some fine throwing knives.
