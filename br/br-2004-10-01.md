Octavian headed back to his flat, to tend the needs of Kitsi. He had a long night convincing the young fox that being nocturnal was not such a good idea, then cleaned up and struck out for the school the next morning.

The Noble House looked deserted. The front gates were closed, but a knock quickly brought a young girl, who carefully, slowly, wrestled on of the gates open. Vacantly looking at Octavian, she waited for his reaction. His request for Mistress Berina resulted in a longer vacant stare, followed by a headwave. After his entry, the gate was carefully wrestled shut again before the young Master Locke was led into the building.

Berina's office was located on the ground floor. A single knock on the door, and then the door was held open for Master Locke to pass through. Stepping into the room, he found himself in what was definitely an office. As he entered, Berina rose from her chair behind the desk and smiled.

Octavian smiled in return and tried not to be rude about gazing at the figure behind the desk.

Octavian says, "Good morning. I'm sorry to disturb you so early."

Octavian says, "I'm Octavian Locke of the Artificer's Guild."

"Greetings, young man." The voice is soft, and gentle, and matches her innocent appearance perfectly. As Berina examines the young man in front of her, she smiles. "Greetings, Octavian Locke. I don't believe I requested your presence. Please, will you have a seat? Alice can fetch us some wine." Behind him, Octavian hears the door close, and footsteps recede rapidly.

Octavian says, "Actually, one of my current patron's other servants suggested you might be able to help with our current commision. I'd be happy to compensate you for your time and advice, if you can assist me in this matter. "

Berina looks thoughtful. "Indeed. Who is your patron?"

Octavian blushes slightly, "I'm afraid I can't reveal that at this time... you see, I specialize in devices intended to secure residences and objects of value. Knowledge that someone has retained my services could, in itself, be valuable to unscrupulous people."

A long pause. Finally Berina resumes her seat, pulling out a sheet of paper. With a shake of her head she encourages the locksmith sit down as Alice returns carrying a tray with two glasses and a decanter. Berina, herself, pours the wine and offers one of the filled glasses.

Octavian says, "In any case. What is called for is a knowledge of certain... substances that can render a person ill. Or worse."

Octavian says, "I was told you were familliar with such things."

Octavian says, "In return for your help I can offer either my services, or a percentage of my commision."

Berina pauses a moment longer. "I see. You speak perhaps of our herbal course, where we discuss the appearance and effects of certain herbs, and their effects on the human body?" She sips from her wine, slowly. "Now it is true that I sometimes teach that course, when our herbalogist is ... indisposed." Dipping a quill into her ink, she writes a single word at the top of the sheet. Then she looks up again. "I think, young man, that you should tell me more. We will discuss your services at a later date. After all, young man, your fame has spread to the Noble House."

Octavian smiles in pleasure, "I'm happy to hear it. I do take pride in my craft."

Berina smiles. "We may, perhaps, make use of you as a teacher. But for now, perhaps you could be more forthcoming? You give me too few details to work with."

Octavian says, "I need a list of substances which would be most effective when mixed in water. This particular device involves a fountain that can be made perfectly safe.... or rendered unwise to drink from, depending on the desires of the patron. He feels wine is overused as a method of delivering such substances, and believes clear water is more likely to be trusted by unwanted guests."

A short pause, and then the quill begins to speed across the paper, with brief darts to the inkpot to refill. After scribbling a dozen or so lines, Berina pauses. "Are you interested in the simpler herbs." She looks at the list. "I assume that price is no object, but perhaps I am wrong?"

Octavian says, "Well, naturally my patron hasn't listed his assets for me, yet he can certainly afford my services, and I feel that I should offer him a choice of herbs and such. Letting him make his own selection. It would be most helpful if you could provide a short description with each of your recommendations."

A smile. "I think perhaps, young man, that I will lend you a copy of our text book. I will expect you to return it, in person, once your patron has made his choice. I would advise against showing the book to him, of course." Turning around, Berina picks a slim volume from the shelves behind her. "Now, here is a list of the herbs and preparations you wish to consider. You will find all of them in this book." She pauses, delicately.

Octavian says, "Most kind of you, Mistress Berina. I assure you I value books quite highly, and will take great care of this one."

"I certainly do hope so, young man. Our patron becomes quite ... incensed when these books disappear." Berina smiles, innocently, her entire posture radiating innocent helpfulness.

Octavian says, "Would returning it in three or four days be sufficient?"

Berina nods. "Indeed. And ... I offer one warning. Please do not attempt to copy the entire book. Use the index, and read only those pages that match the list I gave you."

Octavian nods, "Just as you say. Thank you for your help. I am intrigued by the possibility of teaching here. Perhaps we can discuss it when I return the book."

Octavian smiles as he takes the book and list in one hand, and extends the other to Berina.

A second nod. "Indeed. Once our pupils return, I will send a message to the Artificer's Guild, Master Locke." Berina looks down at the papers on her desk. Then, noticing the extended hand, she stands and shakes it politely.

Octavian gently draws Berina's hand closer, bowing over it and kissing it.

Berina's hand rests serenely in the young locksmith's, as she looks on, a small bemused smile appearing for a moment. Behind him, the locksmith hears footsteps, and the door open once more. "Ah, Alice. The young man, charming as he is, would appreciate your escort to the front gate."

Octavian grins, then turns to Alice, "Yes indeed. I'd be lost without your guidance. "

Octavian winks at Alice, when he's turned so Berina can't see.

Alice blushes, stammering something unintelligible, before leading the way back to the front gate. Once again, she wrestles the gate open, allowing the young locksmith to pass through, while smiling and blushing.

Octavian made his way back to his flat for a short nap, before rejoining his companions and discussing the morning's events.

Harald listens to the recount of the interview and asks to see the book. He mutters a brief cantrip, looking for the presence of magic.

As he holds the book, Harald sees a faint glowing aura surround it.

Harald nods as the minor spell picks up the tell-tale traces. "Ja. Thought as much... I'd advise sticking to the suggested pages for now. There's magic on the book, and it might be magical traps."

Leaving behind the locksmith and his book, the party heads to Ungfallen's temple under Yuri's expert guidance - him having spent the entire winter in Citadel. The temple is small, and easily missed, not to mention completely deserted.

Yuri says, "Sonja, would you please lead us in here? This is a Temple of the Lord of the Underworld. A breach of protocol here could have consequences beyond mere embarrassment."

Sonja says, "Okay okay, though this aint my part of the pantheon."

Sonja says, "Now where are we, front door, side vestibule? Or the way the cooks enter?"

Sonja stands a few feet from the front door of this smallish temple. It seems very quiet in its smallness. Looking about at her companions, then she straightens herself up and closes the distance to the closed door. She firmly raps several times on the door, an echo is heard with each rap. But after waiting a few minutes, there is still no answer.

Sonja looks at her companions again. "No answer. Shall we see if anyone is in there who needs help?"

Yuri says, "You don't think the plague took him, do you?"

Sonja looks scandalized, a priest of the dead falling dead?

Yuri shrugs. "I guess we go in? It won't make it worse if we do."

Sonja places the palm of her left hand on the door and pushes gently to see if it opens.

The door creaks, as it opens inwards. Beyond, the small room is seemingly deserted. There is an altar, containing a small brazier on a simple, barely embroidered cloth. The room is dark, due to the lack of windows, and smells musty.

Sonja keeps pushing at the door until it is open fully to let light in and for fresh air to chase the odors away. Sonja sniffs the stale air anyway, hoping not to smell death.

As the fresh air rushes in, unpleasant odours come wafting out.

Sonja takes another careful sniff of the fetid breeze, hoping there is nothing to cause her to gag.

Sonja carefully walks more fully into the room, peering around to the backside of the altar to see what is there while quietly praying.

Behind the altar, a young man lies, eyes open and staring forever upwards. Hands half crossed on his chest. Flies wonder across his skin, undisturbed.

Sonja covers the lower half of her face with a hand, thinking it may stem some of the smell, while trying to study the cause of demise. Her prayers are now for this honorable servant who died doing his duty.

Harald takes a quick look at the skin lesions and backs off. "That's the plague symptoms, Sonja. Best not touch him."

A moment's glance is enough to confirm; this young man died from the plague. The lesions are visible on his hands and throat, and disappear under his clothes.

Sonja takes a few steps back, pivots and makes her way quickly to the light and fresh air coming in through the open door. She walks out into daylight and takes a deep lungful of clean air before turning back to her companions. "We got to bury him."

Yuri follows Sonja out. "I was thinking that, but... it's probably not safe to handle him. How would we do it?"

Harald says, "There are burial details. We can tell them they're needed here, no need for us to do it ourselves."

Sonja looks at the open doorway, still imagining that priest laying in there. "I think there are details the Chamberlain organised for burials. Need to tell them." Sonja then shivers and wonders what may be crawling in her attire and wishes for a bath.

Yuri pulls the door shut. "Then maybe we should leave here."

Sonja gets easily lost in a city, "Which way to find sucha detail?"

Yuri guides the way. "And then you wanted to go to the Temple to Oak?"

Sonja says, "I think on the morrow. After this encounter I think I need to bathe and thoroughly clean my attire, just to be safe."

Harald says, "Might as well. Though how well one can wash when the water itself is tainted..."

Sonja says, "Lets get that detail here. I feel uneasy the longer he lies there unburied."

Sonja chides herself on her lack of faith, takes another deep breath before she says, "On second thought, lets keep going to Oak."

Yuri leads the way towards the city wall, crossing through the city square and leaving word with the burial details that the anonymous Priest of Ungfallen has succumbed to the plague. The Company continues towards the outer wall of the city, where many proud oaks surround the Temple to Oak, their top boughs rising high above the surrounding buildings.

The temple itself, if it can be recognized as such, seems to nestle in the boughs of the largest oak. A kind of staircase has been constructed around the tree's trunk, leading upwards to a platform some thirty feet above the ground.

Sonja walks amidst the various oak trees, she feels Harald and Yuri coming with her though her vision is filled with that commanding oak tree and its high platform. As she walks towards the tree, the city noises drop away behind her. Finally she and her companions reach the foot of the stair case. Pausing she looks for some way to announce their arrival.

An acorn falls out of the tree, landing in front of Sonja.

Sonja looks up and smiles. "Thank you."

The branches sway in the non-existent breeze.

Sonja says, "Gentlemen, that is our invitation to ascend to a higher platform."

Harald says, "If you say so." He follows Sonja up the stairs.

Yuri looks around. _Either the priests here are sneakier than I am, or... the tree has a will of its own._ He follows.

The stairs are open to the air, and not even a handrail mars the tree's trunk. As the group climbs, and climbs, and climbs time and space seem to drop away, leaving them in a cocoon of quiet. Citadel is soon hidden behind the leaves and branches that sweep out from the trunk. Coming at last to the top of the stairs, the party finds itself on a plain wooden platform. There are obvious paths leading along branches.

There is an air of quiet desolation; not a single soul awaits.

Yuri says, "No priests? I hope this isn't an indication of a trend."

Sonja bobs her head in acknowledgement "I think the priests are busy and hence I must await their return. This is a very good place to pray and to think."

Harald says, "Merial's people were still there. Maybe they're hiding somewhere. What does the tree say?"

The branches bend, leaves rustling against one another in a quiet susurration of welcome. Two more acorns fall, near the trunk.

Sonja smiles and picks up the acorns before they are squashed underfoot, she looks for a safe place to put them.

Moving around the platform, Sonja spots a small branch, almost a shelf, that seems to extend from the trunk, and then fold back in.

Harald says, "I guess we're supposed to wait here, then?"

Sonja carefully nestles the two green acorns in that branch and ponders the sirrustations of the branches and the acorns. "I think I have much to think on if so much effort is being spent to communicate something to us."

Sonja looks up in the branches. "Are the priests busy right now?"

A brief moment of silence, and then a small girl comes tumbling out of the branches. She's wearing only a tunic, a rope twisted around her waist, and her hair floats loose and free, following her movements. Here eyes are green, and her hair is a dark russet brown. She smiles widely as she comes to a stop in front of Sonja. "Hi!"

Sonja is startled for a second before the smile captivates her. "Hello there, I am Sonja and these are my companions: Harald, Yuri, and Andreth. Who pray tell are you?"

Andreth bows to the young girl. "Do... do I know you, miss?" he asks, on an instinctive whim.

Yuri gets over his utter surprise and nods politely.

"I'm Ingrid!" The girl speaks in confident, cheerful tones. She bounces around, looking at each adult in turn, and pausing a moment longer to look at Andreth. "Nope! My mum didn't slap you on the cheek!"

Harald raises an eyebrow, looking back and forth between Andreth and Ingrid, mind whirling with inchoate surmises. "Indeed. Are you here to speak for your mother?"

Sonja decides to sit down before the next surprise carts her off.

Andreth chuckles ruefully, rubbing the spot that bears Merial's mark. "Aye, I s'pose not... tho' I guess the story's been gettin' round."

Ingrid shakes her head from side to side, hair flinging in all directions. "Nope! I'm just ... Oh! I forgot! I'm supposed to welcome you! All of you! Even if some of you got slapped around a little by the Listener!" She bounces over to where Sonja sits. "We can sit in chairs if you like! And at a table! And I have cider, and there's a pie almost ..." She pauses, sniffing the air. "Quick! Follow me! No time to waste!" With that, she runs along one of the boughs, skipping at top speed.

Yuri follows, murmuring to Sonja, "Isn't she a little young for a priestess?"

Andreth rubs his cheek again. "I wonder... mebbe she's a bit more'n a priestess." He shakes his head. "Dunno why I said that. Guess I'm seein' shadows."

Sonja says, "Yuri, who are we to questions the motves of deities. If Ingrid has been called at her age then she has been called. And I do smell something delicious in the air."

The path leads the length of the branch, narrowing as the branch thins. Finally it seems to come to an end, but just below, you can hear the laugh and skip of the young girl, as she's evidently jumped to a lower branch. "Ooooh! No burns!" The words come wafting up, alongside the smell of fresh apple pie.

Yuri grins. "Let's wash the bad odors of the morning from our nostrils thusly!"

Sonja pretends not to hear Yuri's reminded of earlier in the morning as she follow Ingrid across the bough to a nicely set place where the wonderful aroma emenates.

Harald says, "A good idea. Let us partake of the young one's hospitality, shall we?"

Andreth chuckles, and hops down along with them. "I still think there's more to ye than meets the eye, Ingrid," he says. "But I'll not press ye, an' I thank ye for yer welcome."

A short hop and a skip later, a second platform is reached. This one has a small brazier, now filled with glowing coals, on which a small cast iron pot sits. Ingrid is already lifting the lid off, and smelling appreciatively, before hanging the pot from a handy tripod. Bouncing back up, she holds out two hands' full of goblets. "Pick! Pick! We have bronze and beech, gold and oak, silver and aspen ..." Some of the goblets are made of metals, others of varnished wood. "Welcome! Welcome! Choose your goblets, and let the apple pie cool! There's cider to soothe your throat, and the tree will sing for us! Listen! Can you hear it?" For a moment, Ingrid is completely motionless.

Andreth falls quiet - anything that would still this child's motions must be significant. After a while, he nods. "The song of nature..." he says in a reverential whisper. "Been too long since I stopped ta listen."

Harald listens to the leaves rustle, and remembers that the day was dead calm when they started up the stairs. "What does she say, Ingrid?" He takes a goblet and chivvies his familiar out of the carrying pouch where he spends the day. "Be polite, B.T."

Yuri thinks, _Guess I don't speak the language. Better to be silent for those that do._

Sonja says to Ingrid, "May I have one of the oak goblets please?"

Yuri considers for a moment, and asks for an aspen goblet.

Sonja says, "Harald, being amidst these oaks makes me kinda homesick. What about you?"

Andreth listens for a while longer. Whatever he hears, he does not speak of it, instead requesting an oaken goblet for himself, bowing once more to Ingrid.

Harald lets Andreth take the other oak goblet if he wishes, and reaches for one of the beech pair. "Ja, a bit. I don't know how they live down here with so few trees."

Yuri says, "'Tis not so hard. We climb buildings instead."

But only for a moment. Leaves rustle more energetically in her wake as Ingrid begins to rush about again. Sonja gets an oaken goblet, Yuri an aspen. She bounces back to the pot to sniff, and returns. Her second oaken goblet is given to Andreth, and she pauses curiously in front of Harald. "A beech! A veritable beech!" She dances, and selects the bronze goblet for herself, before whirling away. Mere moments later she returns, now carrying a small keg. "Come! Let us pour and be merry! Drink from the guesting cup! Eat of my ..." She pauses. "Well, I don't have bread, but I have pie!"

Sonja holds out her cup to Ingrid. "Please?" Ingrid does pour a libation for Sonja. Sonja then borrows from Ingrid the small cask and passes it to Harald. She lifst up her goblet and waits for the casket to be passed around.

Harald smiles. "That's certainly close enough, Ingrid." He waits until the cider is poured, then lifts his goblet. "To the Empire. May her health be restored. And to the Oak."

Sonja lifts her goblet in toast and adds her own. "May the land be restore."

Yuri ponders the path that brought him to this moment, and states, "May those who choose to pen the story of history through deeds, be inspired to write well."

Ingrid holds up her goblet. "The land, the empire, and our Oak! Our beautiful oak! She sees! She remembers!" Ingrid drains her goblet in two long gulps, her body stretched and rigid. Then she holds the cup upside down, and not a drop falls out. "Greetings, guests, and be welcome!" Putting her goblet down, she serves small bowls of apple pie, soft crust below the apples, a crumbly topping above. Taking the last bowl herself, she digs in enthusiastically.

Harald joins in... it's been a hungry day already, and this is the first food they've had since breakfast. "Delicious." His familiar seems unimpressed by apple pie and cider, merely sitting on his shoulder, occasionally blinking.

Ingrid jumps up after finishing her bowl and notices the toad. "Ooooh! Is she friendly! May I pet her! Does she like acorns?" Ingrid bounces up and down in front of Harald, her feet barely touching the platform.

Sonja follows Ingrid's lead and downs her full goblet in but two swallows. Leaving nary a drop when she too turns upside down her goblet.

Harald says, "She's not unfriendly, you may pet her if you like, and she eats worms and insects."

"Worms! Worms?" Ingrid bounces gleefully! "And here I had a wormy apple! Found it right in the bottom of the pile! I saved the worm! Must feed all my guests!" Gone for but a moment, she's soon back carefully holding a worm cupped in her hands. "Guest and be welcome Miss Toad! Guest and be welcome!"

Andreth enjoys the hospitality in silence, trying to simply appreciate the moment of respite. There's still a sense of strangeness about all this, but perhaps it is only strangeness in a human sense. And so he enjoys his cider and his pie, and listens to the song of the leaves and of life.

The toad looks a little more alive at this, and hops down to the table where she looks up expectantly. Harald makes the introduction. "Ingrid, this is B.T."

Sonja gets around to devouring the apple pie once she realizes how delicious it is. Then Sonja starts looking for something to wipe her hands on besides her tunic.

Ingrid bends down, carefully offering the worm. "Hi B.T.! I'm Ingrid!" As the toad lips at the worm, finally swallowing it whole, Ingrid looks enthralled.

Sonja enjoys Ingrid playing with Harald's B.T. She remembers playing in the forests around the house. Being mesmerized by all the little creatures. She feels a bit more peaceful just being here, in the company of someone so uncomplicated in their outlook, wishing she could return to that world herself.

Sonja pushes such serious thoughts from her mind and just enjoys being able to relax and have some fun.

Harald smiles as the youngster makes friends with his familiar, and shifts to Fallanese to make the traditional offer of a skald. "_Wouldst hear the news we bring, lady of the green? 'Tis but the least we can do to repay thy hospitality._"

Finally, Ingrid seems to slow down a little. Or even a lot. Comes to a downright halt, mid move. Her eyes move up, and her entire posture denotes one who is listening intently. Then a small, resigned sigh. "Yes, mum." She turns back to Sonja. "Mum says I have to answer your questions now."

Sonja is abruptly pulled back to the present. She looks over at Yuri, "A bit more pressing than we thought I guess."

Harald nods. "Ja. But it was refreshing to forget it for even a few minutes. You know what has been happening with the plague, young miss?"

Ingrid nods. "Yes! Mum says the land is sickening!"

Andreth nods slowly - so many ways to hear the same answer, but every fresh perspective adds something a little new. "An' who'd hate this land so much that they want it ta sicken?"

Sonja gathers her thoughts. "Ingrid How to phrase this. Does your Mum have any advice on how Muirwen could be poisoned in such a way tha it affects everyone?"

Harald frowns. "The land? I thought it was the waters. This is not good news."

Andreth shakes his head at Harald. "The waters soothe the land. If'n the waters are poisoned, the land sickens."

Yuri thinks, _Oh, bliss. This keeps getting better._

Sonja says, "Remember Muirwen turned himself into water to soothe the Earth Mother."

Yuri says, "And so Muirwen - or the waters that remain - are unable to serve that role?"

Ingrid looks at Andreth and shakes her head. "Only a ... well, a very silly person would kill the house they live in. On purpose."

Sonja ponders, "Ingrid, if this was an accident. How can we help set it right and save not only the land but the people also?

Andreth nods. "So it comes fr'm outside," he says, looking off to the north.

Harald says, "And if it _wasn't_ an accident... who has done it?"

Yuri says, "Trees grow everywhere throughout the land. Can your mother tell us where the source of the sickness is? The first infection?"

Ingrid looks from person to person, her eyes wide, as she tries to decide who to answer first. And how.

Yuri says, "Our apologies, child. Perhaps we should let you speak to your sister in peace."

Sonja feels the start of distress start to come off Ingrid. She reaches out to Ingrid and gently holds her hand. "It is all right. Just answer what you can. We mean no harm, we are just concerned about how things are going."

Sonja says, "Harald. Is there anything left in the cask. Perhaps Ingrid needs another drink."

Ingrid settles down, a little, and nods at Sonja. "Well, mum says she doesn't ... doesn't know for certain. I think. Or maybe I don't understand. But she says that the gods are ... Well, it's all to do with Kennie." She pauses. "I think."

Harald says, "Kenilthwen?"

Sonja says in a soft voice, "Does it have anything to do with Kenilthwen?"

"Kennie?" Ingrid nods. "I think so."

Sonja looks at Harald for a second and cocks her head towards the cask before returning her attention to Ingrid. "What about the other gods? Did they make Kennie mad?"

Harald quietly pours a bit of cider into Ingrid's goblet and brings it over.

Ingrid shrugs. "Dunno. Mum won't say. Says Kennie is all holed up in his sister's home. Won't come out or speak to **anyone**."

Sonja smiles at Harald for the goblet, she offers it to Ingrid to drink. "That does sound pretty bad."

Andreth chuckles at the first mention of 'Kennie'. "Heh, wish Starguard were here. He'd've got a kick outa this." As the conversation progresses though, the young monk sobers and frowns. "An' then again, mebbe not. Is 'e worried 'bout 'is father, d'ye think? Or summat worse? 'As Wilthorwen said anythin'?"

Looking down, Ingrid shrugs a little. A small, desolate shrug. She sips at the offered goblet and then nods. "I dunno why he's so upset. Lots of fathers disappear. Lots of fathers die. Dunno why ..." Her voice trails off, as acorns fall in torrent around her. She shrugs again.

Yuri glances up at the torrent of acorns, but holds his silence.

Sonja decides to hold both of Ingrid's hands in her hands and looks into Ingrid's eyes. "Can you tell me if you know, when did Kenilthwen decide to stay in his sister's house?"

Ingrid pauses for a moment, and then shrugs. "Mum says they always have. They're sister-wife, brother-husband. Kennie liked to travel though. Gran preferred to stay home and tend her plants."

Andreth's smile broadens a bit, and he nods to himself.

Sonja smiles and gives Ingrid's hands a gentle squeeze of reassurance.. "So it has been going on a for a long time then, before the land and water and people getting sick."

Andreth rubs his chin, still trying to think in his slow way. "I hope it ain't a... a silly person. But if it ain't, it's someone outside th'Flatlands. Gods know there's enough out there wish us ill. We're still recoverin' from the last time."

Ingrid shrugs. "Kennie's sadness? Yeah. I dunno. Mebbe he ... mebbe he ..." She pauses. "I dunno. Mum misses him."

Harald nods to himself. _There's something that Oak either can't or won't tell us, B.T. Let's see if she can at least tell us where to go._ He clears his throat to get Ingrid's attention. "Can your mother tell us where we should go to set things right? Should we seek out ... your grandparents?"

Ingrid looks at Harald. "Ummm. Mum doesn't know. But ... she says ... " The child freezes, listening intently. "She says that it might be a start, and to carry these acorns. They may aid you in your ... your travails?"
