The stirges, pulled off Harald, lie in miserable little piles on the floor, littering up the cave which already smells foul due to the decaying corpses of the dispatched ghasts. Still, Locke is satisfied; the trap seems fully disabled, and the door is ready to be opened fully.

Octavian steps away from the door, and checks his weapons.

Yuri sits quietly in a corner, breathing shallowly. "I hope that door leads to an exit. Do you want me to have a look?"

Octavian says, "Perhaps.... but you look like you need a breather."

Harald says, "You're not in much better shape than I am. Is there anyone who hasn't been chewed on by those damned mosquitoes?"

Yuri shrugs silently, and then adds, "I wonder if the Chamberlain would agree with you."

Octavian says, "I'm untouched.... but not the stoutest of fellows. If you all wish to continue onward, then I'll take the lead, but I think some of you need rest."

Harald says, "Let's see what's in there, first. If it's not an exit, maybe it's a room we can seal up and rest more safely."

Harald says, "Sonja, can you check for undead again?"

Yuri nods to Locke. "You're stouter than most of us, right now. Perhaps take Andreth with you? He can back you up if you find anything heavier than us."

Octavian notices the resolute looks of his comrades, shrugs, readies his sword, and then carefully opens the door.

As the door opens, Octavian gets a better look at the trap he disabled. Now that the tripwire has been cut, the lever will never slide out of the way of that huge block of rock ... and the odds of anyone getting smashed between rock and rock wall is pretty slim. He hopes.

Octavian takes a moment to wedge the lever in place.

Looking down the passage, which looks remarkably even as though miners had carefully hewn it out of the rock - or perhaps a mage with a couple of spells at his disposal - he sees it open out into a small room, only a double handsfull of feet away. As he notices the room, Kitsi panicks. _Evil! Evil!_ Running over him and landing in the room beyond, Kitsi vanishes under the furthest bunkbed.

Octavian quickly backs out of the room, and slams the door shut.

Harald startles as the fox runs away. "Ummm... what was _that_ all about?"

Octavian says, "She says there's bad stuff back there! ... she's usually right."

Harald says, "Wunderbar. So do we go see what's scared her so badly, or do we close the door and hope whatever it is doesn't come out?"

Octavian's eye's glow briefly as he draws forth sorcerous energy.

Yuri says, "You disabled the trap, right? Is there a chance whatever's on the other side might set it off?"

Octavian says, "Ummmm, not if that wedge holds."

Yuri shifts nervously. "So... how 'evil' is this evil? Does your fox get more nervous if the evil is nastier?"

Harald says, "The main tunnel seems to be infested with stirges. Can Kitsi tell you anything more detailed? We may need to go that way."

Octavian says, "She's not exactly on the priestly level of interpreting how evil something is, but I'd say it rate sat least a 7, possibly higher."

Yuri says, "If we can avoid upsetting the stirges then the main tunnel would be better. I think all we have to do is avoid poking any more holes in the walls."

Octavian says, "As a matter of fact... she almost scared sensless."

Harald says, "We didn't poke either of the first two batches. They wake up when they smell blood."

Octavian goes over to the bed and attempts to comfort the panicked vixen.

Yuri says, "Well, whatever we're going to do, let's do it soon." He gets up and wraps a rag around his face, and carefully drags a bunk in front of the hidden door. "In case whatever it is, knows that we are here."

Octavian shrugs and ccarves a wedge from one of the other bed-frames, then uses it to wedge the door shut.

Octavian says, "Waste not, want not."

Octavian says, "Of course if we need to run in that direction....."

Harald says, "Well, if we're going to risk the stirges, let's keep our eyes open for more holes. I can put them to sleep with enough warning."

Yuri says, "We could try mopping some of it up and using it as a lure. You know, throw it ahead of us, let the stirges head for that, instead of us, and kill them from some distance."

Andreth nods, and pulls out his sling. "I think I c'n get the lures a bit further away, if'n that's what we want."

Kitsi, having wriggled out from underneath the bed, and into Octavian's eyes, suddenly sniffs the air.

Yuri nods to Andreth, and gets some rags from his saddle bags. "It's still pretty fresh." He winces as he mops up the blood, remembering where the blood came from. "Try wrapping that around a stone. Let's see if we can get through this the easy way."

Octavian readies his bow.

Andreth takes one of the sling bullets and wraps a bloody rag around one... then glances at Octavian. "Wha' is it? Ye hear somethin?"

Octavian says, "Noooooo... not exactly. Just on edge, I guess."

Harald says, "We've got to get rid of these stinking undead, at least. I'll shift to horse, and you can load the things on me; I'll just need someone to come along to the waterfall."

Yuri leads the horses into the cavern, marvelling as Harald takes on a horse-like aspect himself. Yuri and Harald leave the others to keep the horses calm, load the dead ghasts onto Harald's back, and bring them to the waterfall for a convenient, if messy, disposal.

Moving along the passage, the stench of the corpses fills Harald's nostrils. Right now his sense is more acute than usual. Still ... The trip back to the large cave is relatively uneventful. As he pauses in the opening, he sees the other corpses, still lying on the ground. A few small bat like creatures are crawling all over those other corpses.

Harald stops dead at the sight, and smell, of the living stirges. _Damnation, I thought we'd gotten all of them._ He sits down, sloughing the load back, and starts shifting back to human, the corpses falling to the ground around him as he returns to his normal form.

Yuri shouts a loud curse, and gets his bow out. "Andreth! There's more! Run!"

Alarmed by Yuri's calls, the creatures rise up and head straight for the two young men. Yuri, deft on his feet manages to elude the one, while the other latches onto Harald's changing form. A sharp prick, and Harald feels the stinger drive into his veins even as he's changing shapes.

Harald swears as the things swarm, desperately trying to send them to sleep even as two of them succeed in attaching themselves to him. Rushing the spell seems to make it less effective, though, and only one of the things curls up, though only after jabbing the sorcerer with its proboscis.

Yuri takes another clumsy swipe at the giant insect that's attached to Harald, and misses, narrowly avoiding striking Harald himself.

Harald frowns and runs through the spell again, ignoring the numbness spreading from the creature attached to his arm, and gets the spell perfect this time. The remaining creatures drop to the ground, where they are easily dispatched. "That was definitely unpleasant. Shall we try this again?"

Yuri just gulps, and nods. "Gods," is all he can say.

Harald says, "Either we missed a hidey-hole, or these weren't hungry an hour ago. Nothing for it..." He turns as Andreth charges up. "You missed all the excitement. But you can help load me up again. Hang on while I shift..."

Andreth grimaces at the fresh insectile corpses. "Yeah, looks like these damn' things are gettin' everywhere." He steels himself against the stench and hauls on one of the rotten corpses.

With Andreth present, the assortment of corpses is easily disposed. The rushing waterfall rapidly carries them out of sight. _Poetic,_ thinks Yuri, _that the Waterfall - symbol of Agla - washes away these monsters. Were it so easy._

The Company retreats to the bunkroom, and shores up the barricade on the hidden door with more wedges. Hopefully, with the corpses disposed of, the horses will calm down. The decision is made to rest and attempt to heal the damage done by the mosquitos, before pressing on.
