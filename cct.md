# Introduction
"I have to come up with something but I don't have any ideas!"

If you've said these words, this process will help you fix that problem. It's not perfect. But if you feel blocked, or lost, it will get you started. You can use it for characters, plot lines, fictional worlds, and anything else you can describe.

Why is creativity so hard to get right? Because what you create has to spark strong feelings in your audience. It's easy to say "this work made me feel this way" after you experience it. It's harder to go the other direction and make a new thing that sparks the feelings you intend it to.

It's like cooking stew. You choose ingredients, put the best ones in the pot, stir, and serve. A mixture of experience and experimentation yields the best stew.

# The Process

1. [Inventory](/cct/inventory) - come up with your raw creative materials
2. [Split](/cct/split) - divide your inventory into usable pieces, called **Bits**
3. [Flip](/cct/flip), [Drift](/cct/drift), and [Shuffle](/cct/shuffle) - create new Bits from old ones
4. [Remix](/cct/remix) - turn your new Bits into a draft
5. [Inspect](/cct/inspect) - see if your draft is ready to release!

The most important part of the process is not to let yourself stall out. Follow these principles to keep going:

* List your options, and listen to your feelings about each one
* If you can't choose between alternatives, roll dice or pick at random
* If you get to a point that doesn't feel like it goes anywhere, back up to an earlier step and try something else
* No decision is permanent - if you hate something later on, you can change it!

# Examples

The video game series "Legacy of Kain" is set in a world called "[Nosgoth](https://legacyofkain.fandom.com/wiki/Nosgoth)". How could we arrive at that? Let's write our premise: "This is a game about moody vampires". Through Drift, we can restate that as "this is a game about Gothic Nosferatu". By Splitting and Shuffling, we can get GOTHic NOSferatu, and eventually "Nosgoth".

Have you noticed that the setting for the "Dragon Age" video game series is Thedas? [THE Dragon Age Setting](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-thedas-just-stands-for-the-dragon-age-setting/1100-6499396/)?

Did you know that "Star Trek Beyond" included a character named [Jaylah](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/07/14/jennifer-lawrence-jlaw-jaylah-star-trek-beyond/87088456/), because the writers' room kept referring back to Jennifer Lawrence - J-Law?

Experienced, professional writers use methods like this all the time. It's okay for you to do the same thing.
