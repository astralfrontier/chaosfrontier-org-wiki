# The Process

Drifting is replacing a Bit with a "nearby" Bit. The goal is to choose something that sounds or feels similar but comes with a new meaning.

What does "nearby" mean? It means a word, letter, term, concept, etc. that's closely related along a **dimension**.

## Dimensions

What is a dimension? It's any kind of connection. Every Bit has many dimensions. Examples:

* The class or category of a Bit ("hockey is a sport")
* Other members of the same class or category ("crows and ravens")
* Examples of a Bit that's already a class or category ("cars, like an Audi")
* Things the Bit associates with ("doctors work with nurses and patients")
* Synonyms ("another word for sword is blade")
* Rhymes ("pray and play") or soundalikes ("chopper and copper")

## Drifting Words

Which dimension should you use to Drift?

Drift "up" (to a category or classification) when you want to be vague, generic, or inclusive. Drift "down" (to something specific) when you want to ground your thing in a specific time, place, or mood. You can use resources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) to find such terms.

Drift "sideways" to give yourself a new feeling or aesthetic. For example, suppose you are working with "laser swords". Synonyms for "sword" include "cutlass", "rapier", and "scimitar". But if you conjure up thoughts of those three weapons, the feeling you get may be very different from each one. You can use resources like [thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com/) to look up common synonyms.

You can Drift along unusual dimensions, such as puns of a word. For example, perhaps Wizards in your world don't cast "spells", but "spills". You decide this means that Wizards splash enchanted ink onto something, then draw magical effects out of it. You can use resources like [punpedia](https://punpedia.org/) to find interesting word variations like this.

You can Drift to an unusual synonym, or a translation into another language. For example, fantasy wizards often cast lightning spells. The Middle English word "levin" also means lightning, but sounds mystical. Fiction often uses Latin instead of English to mark the presence of magic.

> Be cautious using words from languages when you don't know the definitions and connotations of the word in that language! Native speakers may interpret your meaning differently. This is even the case in English - if you tell someone you are watching "football", that means two very different sports in different parts of the world.

[Paleolexicon](https://www.palaeolexicon.com/) is a set of dictionaries for languages that are considered "dead". Rather than using terms from languages with living speakers, you may want to look here first.

## Drifting Letters and Syllables

The most common letters in English: E, T, A, I, N, O, S, H, R, D, L, U, C, M, F, W, Y, G, P, B, V, K, Q, J, X, and Z.

You can create colorful and interesting names by transposing a few letters in a word or name. A key part of this process is to think about the dimension along which you'll be Drifting. For example, letter order (A B C...) is a dimension. But so is letter frequency (E T A...). The dimension and direction you choose will affect how the outcome feels.

You can inject an element of mystery or strangeness by replacing a more common Bit with a rarer one. You created a mysterious clan of moth assassins who worship a dark god, and named the clan the "Tamba". By Drifting T to X, a rarer letter, you get "Xamba". Does that sound creepy enough?

You can randomly replace syllables by rolling 1d100 and looking at the table in the link above. For example, you are creating an underwater realm in a fantasy world. You Split "Atlantis" into "at", "lan", and "tis" as syllables. Rolling 1d100 gives you 97, or "gou". You give your new realm the name "Goulantis", or just "Goulant".
