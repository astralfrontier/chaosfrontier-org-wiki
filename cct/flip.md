# The Process

Flipping is replacing a Bit with its opposite. You can reverse a traditional dynamic or relationship. You can examine something familiar via contrast. x

What does "opposite" mean? It means a word, letter, term, concept, etc. that's on the other end of a **dimension**.

## Dimensions

What is a dimension? It's any kind of connection. Every Bit has many dimensions. Examples:

* The properties of a person or thing ("rich vs. poor")
* Morality, ethics, or other principles ("good vs. evil")
* Antagonistic groups ("cops vs. robbers") or natural forces ("matter vs. antimatter")
* Other members of a class or category ("Earth vs. Pluto")
* Inversions and antonyms ("clean vs. dirty")

Remember that very few things exist as simple binaries. Topics like gender and morality are not a single A-or-B proposition. Many things are relative, not absolute. The biggest mouse is smaller than the smallest house. If you want your story to be about a complex topic, consider making it an entire Pitch. But you can sometimes inject complexity into a story by Flipping a key assumption.

## Choosing a Dimension

You can choose what to Flip based on these questions:

1. What do I find most interesting to examine here?
2. Is this Bit a clich√©, and is it time for a change?
3. What serves the needs of my story, character, or plot better?

Examples:

* "the archaeologist obtains artifacts for a museum" can Flip to "the archaeologist returns artifacts to their homes"
* "the princess needs rescuing by the knight" can Flip to "the princess rescues the knight"
