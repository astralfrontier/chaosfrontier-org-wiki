# The Process

Once you've got a draft prepared, you want to see if it's ready for public consumption. There are four steps to doing that:

1. See if it hurts anyone
2. See if it steals from anything
3. Hear how it sounds
4. See how it lands

If everything passes, you may be done!

## Does it hurt anyone?

Does your draft include racist, sexist, or bigoted language? Does it use slurs, ableist terms, or other forms of hate speech? If you don't know what these are, it's time to Google "examples of (term)". If your draft does include such things, it's time to remove them.

## Does it steal from anything?

The goal of the Flip, Drift, and Shuffle processes is to make something your own. If your story is about the evil Lords of the Tith fighting the good Kedi Knights, you won't fool anybody. So read over your draft, and see if it feels too close to something you know already exists.

## How does it sound?

It may sound trivial, but a very easy way to test your draft is to **say it out loud to another person**. There's a difference in how we process thoughts versus things we hear. Once your idea leaves your mouth, you will have a perspective on it that you didn't have before.

## How does it land?

When you share your draft with someone else, study their initial emotional reaction. Don't ask them what they think. Instead, try to understand how they feel. If they are your friend or associate, they will be tempted to praise your idea to protect your feelings. Your eventual audience will not react the same way.
