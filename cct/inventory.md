# The Process

The start of the process is coming up with your raw materials or ingredients. The goal is to establish a definite starting point.

Depending on what you're trying to make, you'll either write a **Pitch**, or you'll make a **Menu**.

## The Pitch

Can you write your starting point in a sentence or two? Would it fit into a tweet (280 characters or less)? Try it. Don't edit it, unless you see some obvious mistakes.

If you want to emulate some existing story or world, your pitch is a short description of that thing.

Example pitches:

* "A game about a post-capitalist society on another planet"
* "A war story about good and evil space knights"
* "A landmark that would appear in a comic-book superhero city"

> **Don't** try to write your _ending_ pitch! The process you're going through will help you get there. Only write the parts you're already sure of.

If you are writing the plot of your story, the Pitch is also called a "logline". There is an excellent Twitter thread on how to write these:

## The Menu

You can't always write a pitch. This usually happens in two cases:

1. Your pitch would be very generic ("a teenage superhero character")
2. When you want to take parts from more than one inspiration ("Babylon 5 meets Law & Order")

A good menu will have between two and five items on it. These are the inspirations or examples that are a vital part of your idea.

> You might have more items in mind. Instead of adding them to the main menu, think of them as garnish that you add once your idea has taken shape. For example, you might say "I want Babylon 5 meets Law & Order, but with Star Wars lightsabers". Star Wars doesn't go on the menu.
