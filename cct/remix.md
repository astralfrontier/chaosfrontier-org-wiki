# The Process

A Remix is plugging the Bits you want back into a template, then asking questions about the result. Essentially, you're recreating your [Pitch](/cct/inventory), or writing a new Pitch, but with updated Bits.

For example, your Pitch started out as "A game about a post-capitalist society on another planet". "Post-capitalist" and became "hopepunk". "Another planet" became a specific name: "Alpha Tenet" ("Alpha Tenet Nor" is an anagram of "another planet", and you dropped "Nor"). It's a simple matter to substitute these new Bits into the old Bits' place: "A game about a hopepunk society on Alpha Tenet".

If your pitch was "Babylon 5 meets Law & Order", your Bits were "space station", "alien races", "galactic politics", "police procedural", "law procedural", and "current affairs". You can string your eventual Bits into a new Pitch. Using one of the templates below, you get: "In a world of political clashes aboard a space station, an alien cop must navigate complex galactic law to arrest a guilty party".

## Example Templates

- "A [DESCRIPTIVE ADJ] [MAIN CHARACTER(S)' PROFESSION] must [DO SOMETHING ANTITHETICAL TO THEIR NATURE] in order to [SOLVE A BIG PROBLEM]." ([source](https://twitter.com/juliayorks/status/1371872858037698560?s=20&t=mI7NC_BqAbl8jI2cbfrzUQ))
- ""When [A BIG EVENT HAPPENS] in [OUR SETTING], our [DESCRIPTIVE ADJ] [MAIN CHARACTER(S)' PROFESSION] must [SOLVE THE PROBLEM]."" ([source](https://twitter.com/juliayorks/status/1371872860076175360?s=20&t=mI7NC_BqAbl8jI2cbfrzUQ))
- "In a world where [RULE OF THE WORLD], our [DESCRIPTIVE ADJ] [MAIN CHARACTER(S)' PROFESSION] has do [DO SOMETHING THAT GOES AGAINST THAT RULE]." ([source](https://twitter.com/juliayorks/status/1371872862118817798?s=20&t=mI7NC_BqAbl8jI2cbfrzUQ))
- "Once upon a time there was (Bit). Every day, (Bit). One day (Bit). Because of that, (Bit). Because of that, (Bit). Until finally (Bit)." ([source](https://www.aerogrammestudio.com/2013/03/07/pixars-22-rules-of-storytelling/))

## Asking Questions

Once you've rebuilt your Pitch, set it aside from yourself as creator, and come back to it as a reader. Your goal is to read it for what it is, and only read what has actually been written. If you have difficulty doing this, you can ask a friend to help.

Your goal is to **ask logical questions** about what you've just written. "Who is the alien cop here to arrest?" "Why are they difficult to arrest?" "Alpha Tenet sounds like 'the first tenet', and a tenet is a principle or belief. Is there anything there?"

Sometimes a question will force you to reconsider what you wrote. This is good! That is the point of the questions. Your goal is to build a solid foundation for what you've created.
