# The Process

A Remix is plugging the Bits you want back into a template, then asking questions about the result. Essentially, you're recreating your [Pitch](/cct/inventory), or writing a new Pitch, but with updated Bits.

For example, your Pitch started out as "A game about a post-capitalist society on another planet". "Post-capitalist" and became "hopepunk". "Another planet" became a specific name: "Alpha Tenet" ("Alpha Tenet Nor" is an anagram of "another planet", and you dropped "Nor"). It's a simple matter to substitute these new Bits into the old Bits' place: "A game about a hopepunk society on Alpha Tenet".

If your pitch was "Babylon 5 meets Law & Order", your Bits were "space station", "alien races", "galactic politics", "police procedural", "law procedural", and "current affairs". You can string your eventual Bits into a new Pitch. Using one of the templates below, you get: "In a world of political clashes aboard a space station, an alien cop must navigate complex galactic law to arrest a guilty party".

## Example templates
