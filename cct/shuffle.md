# The Process

Shuffling is changing the order, significance, or relationship of Bits to each other. The goal is to create something original. Imagine creating two different movies using the same actors in different roles.

## What to Shuffle

Shuffling Bits with an emotional connection, such as two characters, can yield a very different emotional impact on your story. Decide what emotion(s) you want to evoke, and experiment with Shuffles that yield the desired result.

Consider this summary of the film "The Exorcist": "When a teenage girl is possessed by a mysterious entity, her mother seeks the help of two priests to save her daughter." ([source](https://screencraft.org/blog/101-best-movie-loglines-screenwriters-can-learn-from/))

If you shuffle the Bits in play, such as having the mother be possessed and the daughter needing to seek help from the Church, how does your story change? The center of the story is no longer a parent's love and fear for their child. Perhaps it's now about the power a parent has over a child and the pain someone in that position might inflict.

Consider "Beauty and the Beast": "A prince cursed to spend his days as a hideous monster sets out to regain his humanity by earning a young woman's love." ([source](https://screencraft.org/blog/101-best-movie-loglines-screenwriters-can-learn-from/)). Very different stories emerge from "the young woman is the beast" or "there is a beast who was transformed into a prince".

## Shuffles as Twist Endings

A common trope in TV series "The Twilight Zone" was the twist ending. The story would subvert expectations at the last minute, such as having a seemingly alien invasion turn out to be humans from Earth.

## Shuffling Names

If a name doesn't work for you, you can Shuffle the syllables or letters. For example, if calling your underwater continent "Atlantis" is too obvious, "Attislan" may be a step in the right direction.
