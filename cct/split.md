# The Process

Once you have your Pitch or your Menu ready, you'll reduce it into smaller pieces, called **Bits**. You'll work with these Bits to come up with your final creative product.

How you Split depends on what you're trying to achieve. If you want to *name* something or someone, you want to Split on language, such as words, syllables, or letters. If you want to *describe* something or someone, you want to split by properties or words.

## Splitting by language

To split a sentence or paragraph by language, look for the interesting nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs in your inventory. The result are your **Bits**.

For example, your Pitch was "A war story about good and evil space knights". Your Bits are "war", "good", "evil", "space", and "knights".

> It's okay to include both a noun or verb by itself, and that word plus any modifiers. For example, you might include "space", "knights", and "space knights".
{.is-success}

You can create interesting and evocative names by Splitting along syllables or individual letters, then working with those. Many names are anagrams of something else, for example.

## Splitting by properties

You can learn the properties of a thing by answering _what it is_, and _what it can do_.

For example, ask yourself the sentences "Superman is..." or "Superman can...". Some example answers:

* Superman is a superhero
* Superman is an alien
* Superman is a reporter
* Superman can fly
* Superman can stop bullets
* Superman can lift almost anything

Do this until you have listed the important properties of your thing. If you've got a menu of items to work from, figure out the properties of each of them. The final list of properties are your **Bits**.
