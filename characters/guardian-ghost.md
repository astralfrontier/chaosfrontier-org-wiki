<!-- TITLE: The Guardian Ghost -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A fourth-generation Mystery Man -->

# Background
Great-grandson of "The Shadow", with the powers but lacking with the guidance to use them.

### Who are you?

Miguel Murphy is the great-grandson of the original Guardian Ghost, Sam Murphy, who put on a coat and fedora and fought crime during World War II. Sam didn't have any powers to start with, except that he heard a strange Voice, like an old-timey crackly radio announcer. The Voice told him secrets, like where crime bosses were hiding out, and he'd go kick in the door and arrest them or whatever.

Sam had kids, and he got killed, and then his actual ghost came back and started mentoring the family. And his kids had kids, and they had Miguel. Somehow, Sam's ghost was able to imbue the family with actual shadow-manipulation powers from beyond, and they used these powers to continue the battle against crime. And year after year, generation after generation, the Voice would tell them their purpose and share its secrets.

Miguel is the first of the line not to hear the Voice. He inherited the shadow powers, but they don't work quite right. His mother thinks this is good - maybe he hasn't been called after all, and that means he'll be safe and live a normal life. His father is confident it's just a matter of time, and pushed him into crimefighting anyway. The spirit of Sam Murphy is still with the family, watching - and judging.

There's one other voice that isn't being heard - Miguel's. But he doesn't know what he wants to say. Not yet.

Legacy: Your legacy is an important part of Halcyon City. Name the different members of your legacy (at least two):

* David Murphy (Miguel's father) is still active and prominent in the city.
* Sam Murphy (the original Guardian Ghost) is retired and quite judgmental.
* Katia Murphy (Miguel's younger sister) is the next possible member of the legacy.

**Whenever time passes**, roll + Savior to see how the members of your legacy feel or react to your most recent exploits. Before rolling, ask the other players to answer these questions about your performance. Take -1 to the roll for each “no” answer:

* have you been upholding the traditions of your legacy?
* have you maintained the image of your legacy?
* have you made the other members of your legacy proud?

On a hit, one of them offers you meaningful encouragement, an opportunity, or an advantage. On a 7-9, another is upset with your most recent actions, and will make their displeasure known. On a miss, something you did stirred up the hornet’s nest—expect several members of your legacy to meddle with your life.
