# How does it work?
Miguel is twelve. For years, he has seen his father do strange things. His mother doesn't seem troubled. Both parents have told him, time and again, that it is okay, that this is normal. Now it is time to go beyond reassurances.

"The Voice will explain it to you," says his father, David. "But for now... Imagine that there is a place where darkness is a real thing, like water. We use water every day. We drink it, and take showers with it. We swim in it. And, yes, we can drown in it. Water can be a danger, but it is also a tool. And like that, the shadow-stuff from beyond can be a tool, if used properly."

"The darkness is both material, and mental. It affects minds, as well as bodies. With it, you can frighten criminals, discover secrets, stay hidden from danger, and protect others."

Miguel thinks about this, and then asks a question.

"It sounds kinda scary. Is it evil?"

His father smiles strangely, and pats him on the head. "A person can be good or evil. A tool is just a tool. In the wrong hands, it makes a bad person more dangerous. In the right hands, it can save lives."
# Shadow Portals
Miguel is thirteen. He's in an iron box, with a door that latches on the outside. His mother looks very unhappy. His father is frowning. But he has shown the first signs of his powers developing, and so it's time.

"Miguel, we both love you. I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't going to help you. When the door closes, you're going to start feeling afraid. Things are going to happen that will make you more afraid. The fear is necessary. Fear will give you a connection to the darkness. When you feel that connection, push it open, and pass through it. That will get you out of the box. You'll be free, if you use the shadow."

The last thing Miguel sees, before the door shut, is his parents' faces.

The box is stuffy. Miguel hears the echo of his breathing. He feels, then hears, his own heartbeat. He can't see anything, but his eyes keep teasing him with after-images or hints of light.

He shifts around, trying to find a good sitting position. He realizes, after a few minutes, that it's not just the pitiless metal under his butt that fels uncomfortable. The box is tipping, slowly. Wait! Is he going to fall? There's a creaking noise too. What is that?

Seconds turn into minutes. Miguel isn't sure he can keep track of the time, except by his own heartbeat, but that's now racing too. There's a strange smell, and it's growing more insistent. He believes his dad wouldn't hurt him - but he can't see him, can't ask him, to be sure.
