# How does it work?
Miguel is twelve. For years, he has seen his father do strange things. His mother doesn't seem troubled. Both parents have told him, time and again, that it is okay, that this is normal. Now it is time to go beyond reassurances.

"The Voice will explain it to you," says his father, David. "But for now... Imagine that there is a place where darkness is a real thing, like water. We use water every day. We drink it, and take showers with it. We swim in it. And, yes, we can drown in it. Water can be a danger, but it is also a tool. And like that, the shadow-stuff from beyond can be a tool, if used properly."

"The darkness is both material, and mental. It affects minds, as well as bodies. With it, you can frighten criminals, discover secrets, stay hidden from danger, and protect others."

Miguel thinks about this, and then asks a question.

"It sounds kinda scary. Is it evil?"

His father smiles strangely, and pats him on the head. "A person can be good or evil. A tool is just a tool. In the wrong hands, it makes a bad person more dangerous. In the right hands, it can save lives."
# Shadow Portals
Miguel is thirteen. He's in an iron box, with a door that latches on the outside. He doesn't know where the box is located - they drove somewhere he'd never been, some kind of warehouse by the river. His mother looks very unhappy. His father is frowning. But he has shown the first signs of his powers developing, and so it's time.

"Miguel, we both love you. I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't going to help you. When the door closes, you're going to start feeling afraid. Things are going to happen that will make you more afraid. The fear is necessary. Fear will give you a connection to the darkness. When you feel that connection, push it open, and pass through it. That will get you out of the box. You'll be free, if you use the shadow."

The last thing Miguel sees, before the door shut, is his parents' faces.

The box is stuffy. Miguel hears the echo of his breathing. He feels, then hears, his own heartbeat. He can't see anything, but his eyes keep teasing him with after-images or hints of light. He shifts around, trying to find a good sitting position. He realizes, after a few minutes, that it's not just the pitiless metal under his butt that fels uncomfortable. The box is tipping, slowly. Wait! Is he going to fall? There's a creaking noise too. What is that?

Seconds turn into minutes. Miguel isn't sure he can keep track of the time, except by his own heartbeat, but that's now racing too. There's a strange smell, and it's growing more insistent. He believes his dad wouldn't hurt him - but he can't see him, can't ask him, to be sure. He doesn't even know why this is happening. Isn't there supposed to be, y'know, something that just tells him how it all works? If he's honest, when he first learned about his family's powers, he thought it would be sort of like the Genie from Aladdin - "I wish the bad guys would all be tied up!" - and his powers would obey his commands, figuring out the boring hows and whys.

He hears a car engine, feels the box suddenly moving. Suddenly there's a splash, and the box is rocking! He's in the river. Is he? Did his parents really dump him? His thinking kicks into high gear, like his parents drilled into him - his dad the superhero, his mother the second-generation scientist. There's no water coming in. The box is water-tight. But it must be air-tight, because it's not leaking. So he's going to suffocate, even if he doesn't drown.

The fear rises. He just wants to see his dad again. Blinded by darkness, he feels a seed of a deeper darkness, an almost negative light, at the heart of his mind. He wills himself toward it.

He feels himself spilling out of something cold and clammy. It feels like concrete. His head is pounding. But his parents are there, hugging him, holding him, reassuring him. He blinks away his confusion and accepts a strong quartet of arms in getting to his feet. He's still in the warehouse, still on the ground. The box is still there, the one he was in, and it's still sealed.

"You did it, son," his father says proudly.

"How... what? I.. I thought I was in the river.." Miguel says, uncertain of what to believe.

His father nods, a serious look on his face. "The clouded mind. I made you afraid, by deceiving your senses. Your fear opened the gate to the darkness, and gave you a path through. You will always feel some fear - for yourself, for your teammates, for a civilian, for the city. Conquer this fear, understand it. Fear is the key to a door that will take you anywhere you wish to be."

Miguel struggles to process this. He dreads that it will take practice - he does not *want* to be afraid. But - he did it! He succeeded. And his parents didn't really endanger him, did they? He smiles.

"How did you make me experience those things?"

His father smiles proudly. "Master this, and I will teach you that."
# Mind-Clouding
Miguel is fourteen. He's been practicing with shadow portals for months, and he feels ready for anything. His dad took him back to the warehouse a few times and lined up a bunch of those tennis-ball cannons. "Dodge," came the order, and the tennis balls started firing. The practice was exhausting, but fun, because he felt accomplished every time the machines shut off and his dad came over with the day's score.

Today is different. They're at the warehouse again, but Grandfather Jesse is here as well. Miguel likes the old man, and his grandmother Laura too, but Jesse always looks so grumpy. Miguel keeps wondering what he did wrong. But his dad says something that gets his attention.

"This isn't something you just practice, over and over," his dad says sternly. "You have to pay attention, Miguel."

Miguel nods. His mom and dad have been fighting lately, about him, and he doesn't know how he feels. He's tried to please them both, Dad with powers practice, Mom with science homework and studies. So when a chance appears to make his father proud, Miguel jumps at it.

The three Murphys set up a card table and folding chairs. Jesse produces a ball and three red Solo cups. "The game is simple. Put a ball underneath the cup, shuffle the cups, Davey here picks the cup with the ball. If he guesses right, you lose. You know which cup the ball is under. You want your dad to pick the wrong one."

Miguel sits across from his father, making eye contact. The two begin playing. In the first few rounds, David's keen eyes spot the ball every time. Miguel frowns.

Jesse lays a withered hand on his shoulder. "The secret of the clouded mind is that you can't do it from nothin'. Remember this phrase: first the spark, then the dark. First the spark, then the dark. It means, you start with something mundane. Some doubt, some fear, some kinda emotion. Why would your dad pick the wrong cup? Find that reason in your own mind. Wrap the shadow around it, then sorta.. pull."

Miguel nods, uncertainly. He plays a few more rounds, thinking about his dad and their relationship. His dad has been warm, kind, supportive. His dad has faith in him. Right? Does his dad.. trust him?

That's it. *I wouldn't deceive you, dad. Believe me. I'll let you know where the ball is.*

David misses the next three balls.

The next few weeks are the same routine. Miguel's success rate goes steadily down. "He's gettin' wise to your tricks," Jesse explains. "You have to find something new. Find, or create something. Some seed of doubt."

Miguel watches his father like a hawk from then on. DIfferent emotions work differently, some not at all. "Practice doesn't make perfect," David explains. "Every situation is unique."

Finally, though, Miguel is able to do it often enough that both David and Jesse are satisfied. The next day, when they set up the card table, Jesse brings out a new set of cups - transparent plastic. Miguel gapes. The old man just grins.
