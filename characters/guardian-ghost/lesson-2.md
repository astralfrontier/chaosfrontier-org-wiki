# The Costume
Miguel winces as he looks at the outfit for the first time. His dad looks cool in the get-up, and he's seen pictures of his grandfather with some heroes from the 60's and 70's. But now that it's his turn, it hits him that this thing is corny.

The hat is a [Bolero](https://www.etsy.com/listing/226356429/bolero-hat-the-bolero-black-wool-felt?gpla=1&gao=1&utm_campaign=shopping_us_AgnoulitaHats_sfc_osa&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_custom1=0&utm_content=9169083&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-tXlBRDWARIsAGYQAmdEwdRWFHWAujpriiorLWTPh2E2tjbAxwy03vYnYqZOkmaYIIWMm4QaAtoeEALw_wcB), a wide-brimmed wool felt hat in black decorated by a red ribbon. There's a [black mask](https://www.etsy.com/listing/94055283/gothic-punk-rock-visual-kei-unisex?gpla=1&gao=1&utm_campaign=shopping_us_runnickyrun_sfc_osa&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_custom1=0&utm_content=6172408&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-tXlBRDWARIsAGYQAmeflTha1MD0PiekWYm54R8oCOrc4bhi-JtwooOp5vgecRcgkmN28IYaAip8EALw_wcB) covering the nose and everything beneath it, less revealing than a surgical mask. There's a full-coverage [coat](https://www.bonanza.com/listings/New-Handmade-Scorpion-Mens-Hooded-Trench-Coat-Long-Jacket-Black-Gothic-Steampunk/593830346?goog_pla=1&variation_id=675984005&gpid=177431040541&keyword=&goog_pla=1&pos=1o21&ad_type=pla&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-tXlBRDWARIsAGYQAmeukyya7gH3WqBytVEeAbrWAeFN96XlTrwc_wEHtZ1eBOi51O2F60saAr9REALw_wcB), open to allow acrobatic maneuvering, and with a hood that can be pulled up in case the hat cannot or should not be worn. Beneath everything is a suit of Aramid carbon fiber, custom-made and fitted. The rest of the outfit is intended to look creepy, projecting the impression of a stalker of the night. The armor is the business end of the ensemble.

David and Jesse spend time picking and choosing the outer parts of the costume, and argue the merits of each piece as an element of terror or concealment. Maria Baez Murphy applies all her chemical expertise to treating and testing the armor itself, up to and including actual ballistics tests with real bullets. Miguel watches with a mixture of fascination and uncertainty as his mother expertly aims and empties a range of firearms. Her accuracy is pretty good.

Once everyone else is happy, Miguel strips down to his underwear in a changing room and slips on each piece. There's no mirror in here, so he does the best he can to get everything together.

*I feel like a dork.*

Outside, everyone is waiting for him. His mom raises her phone and snaps a picture, *of course*. His dad and granddad nod approvingly.

*I probably look like a dork too.*

David can see the look on his son's face, and understands what it means. He speaks in measured tones. "Without the right attitude, you're just wearing a bunch of black clothing. With it, you are a dark avenger, and evil will tremble."

Miguel watches his father's face harden, and his eyes narrow. "So.. are you just an emo teenager....? Or are you a Guardian Ghost?"

Miguel Murphy hears the weight of his father's words, and makes a decision.
