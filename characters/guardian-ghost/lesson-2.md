# The Costume
Miguel winces as he looks at the outfit for the first time. His dad looks cool in the get-up, and he's seen pictures of his grandfather with some heroes from the 60's and 70's. But now that it's his turn, it hits him that this thing is corny.

The hat is a [Bolero](https://www.etsy.com/listing/226356429/bolero-hat-the-bolero-black-wool-felt?gpla=1&gao=1&utm_campaign=shopping_us_AgnoulitaHats_sfc_osa&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_custom1=0&utm_content=9169083&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-tXlBRDWARIsAGYQAmdEwdRWFHWAujpriiorLWTPh2E2tjbAxwy03vYnYqZOkmaYIIWMm4QaAtoeEALw_wcB), a wide-brimmed wool felt hat in black decorated by a red ribbon. There's a [black mask](https://www.etsy.com/listing/94055283/gothic-punk-rock-visual-kei-unisex?gpla=1&gao=1&utm_campaign=shopping_us_runnickyrun_sfc_osa&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_custom1=0&utm_content=6172408&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-tXlBRDWARIsAGYQAmeflTha1MD0PiekWYm54R8oCOrc4bhi-JtwooOp5vgecRcgkmN28IYaAip8EALw_wcB) covering the nose and everything beneath it, less revealing than a surgical mask. There's a full-coverage [coat](https://www.bonanza.com/listings/New-Handmade-Scorpion-Mens-Hooded-Trench-Coat-Long-Jacket-Black-Gothic-Steampunk/593830346?goog_pla=1&variation_id=675984005&gpid=177431040541&keyword=&goog_pla=1&pos=1o21&ad_type=pla&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-tXlBRDWARIsAGYQAmeukyya7gH3WqBytVEeAbrWAeFN96XlTrwc_wEHtZ1eBOi51O2F60saAr9REALw_wcB), open to allow acrobatic maneuvering, and with a hood that can be pulled up in case the hat cannot or should not be worn. Beneath everything is a suit of Aramid carbon fiber, custom-made and fitted. The rest of the outfit is intended to look creepy, projecting the impression of a stalker of the night. The armor is the business end of the ensemble.

David and Jesse spend time picking and choosing the outer parts of the costume, and argue the merits of each piece as an element of terror or concealment. Maria Baez Murphy applies all her chemical expertise to treating and testing the armor itself, up to and including actual ballistics tests with real bullets. Miguel watches with a mixture of fascination and uncertainty as his mother expertly aims and empties a range of firearms. Her accuracy is pretty good.

Once everyone else is happy, Miguel strips down to his underwear in a changing room and slips on each piece. There's no mirror in here, so he does the best he can to get everything together.

*I feel like a dork.*

Outside, everyone is waiting for him. His mom raises her phone and snaps a picture, *of course*. His dad and granddad nod approvingly.

*I probably look like a dork too.*

David can see the look on his son's face, and understands what it means. He speaks in measured tones. "Without the right attitude, you're just wearing a bunch of black clothing. With it, you are a dark avenger, and evil will tremble."

Miguel watches his father's face harden, and his eyes narrow. "So.. are you just an emo teenager....? Or are you a Guardian Ghost?"

Miguel Murphy hears the weight of his father's words, and makes a decision.
# Theater
Miguel is sitting in the theater room with his friend, Anya. The rest of the group has left, allowing the two to talk candidly.

"Your parents are assholes, Miguel," Anya says, earnestly, and a little judgementally. As she ticks off items, Miguel reflects.

"They don't let you go to concerts. Or listen to fun music." *Dad says loud noises will hurt my hearing, and I need to be able to pick up small details.*

"And your dad and your grandpa? They're running your life, man." *Really, it's my great-grandfather who's the patriarch, but nobody can see him.*

"They're messing with your head with this homeschooling." *It's training for my role as a vigilante.*

"All the time, it's just fear, fear, fear, that's all you talk about. People being afraid. It's creepy." *Fear is one of the triggering emotions to call the darkness.*

"Like, are you part of some kind of cult?"

Miguel shakes his head. *I can't tell anyone the truth, can I. But I can't lie to Anya. I need my friends, just like I need my family.* "It's.. it's complicated. I wanna respect my family. But like, they don't want to control me. They just.. it's.." He searches for words. "You know how we're not supposed to whistle, and bad rehearsals mean good shows, and we don't say the name of the Scottish Play?"

"Yeah?" Anya doesn't sound convinced.

"Well, y'know, those things sound dumb if you don't know like we do, but it's tradition. It's just how things are done. My family's got two traditions, there's my mom's, and there's my dad's. And they don't really see eye to eye all the time, but I want to honor them both. So just, please, don't talk bad about 'em. They're trying, and it's stupid sometimes, like I don't know half the time what they really want me to do--"

Anya lays a comforting hand on his shoulder, and Miguel lets out a long sigh. The accumulated tension of his shoulders and neck feels like it's flowing down his trunk and out through his feet. At least there's someone who'll listen. He looks over to see her grinning.

"Listen, I'm gettin' pizza with Steve. It's kind of an us thing, but let's all hang out some other time, okay? You're one of us, Miguel. You don't have to be alone."

Miguel smiles in genuine gratitude. "I don't feel alone. Have fun with Steve."

Anya stands and walks out. Miguel remembers one other theater tradition. There's always one light left on in a theater, and it's called a ghost light.
# Mother and Sister
Maria Baez Murphy is the daughter of Ernesto Baez, the famous super-scientist. The Guardian Ghost rescued the chemist from a gang of terrorists intent on using his chemical creations to rule the world, and saved his daughter's life in the process. One thing led to another, David and Maria got married, and this is how Miguel and his sister Katia enjoy egg and chorizo wraps in the morning.

Maria charged into domestic duties with the same eagerness, intelligence, and fierceness she showed (and still shows) in the fields of organic chemistry, biochemistry, and metamaterials research. He knows that she's contributed basic research toward some of the gadgets and armor that his dad uses in the field, and that she's absolutely not giving him anything remotely dangerous until his 18th birthday, and probably not even then. But he also knows she's the best cook in the neighborhood. He's not sure how a dark avenger is supposed to feel about the person who washes his underwear, but dad manages it okay.

Right now she's bustling around the kitchen, collecting plates, pouring more orange juice, and pointing Miguel's little sister Katia at her backpack. The faucet is running in the background. Maria's got a Bluetooth headset, and is talking to somebody or other about a conference, so her children don't get spoken to, only gestured or glared at.

Katia's the quieter, more serious one. She's young enough that Miguel thinks of her as childish, and old enough that she can occasionally put him in his place. The combination is annoying.

"Dad said you're supposed to help me with shadow training," she says, in that flat monotone that pisses him off. *Why do you have act so superior? You're gonna be just as bad at this as I was. Probably worse.*

"Yeah, I will." Miguel takes a bite of his third breakfast wrap.

"*Today*," Katia stresses.

"Got rehearsal today."

An obedient kid would say "okay". A bratty kid would whine, "but Dad saaaid." Katia, damn it all, has to be logical. "These powers are dangerous. Mom and Dad both know so. As a responsible order brother, aren't you supposed to be looking after me?"

"Take care of your sister," adds Maria, another step in the graceful dance she's doing between dishes, event planning, and general parenting.
