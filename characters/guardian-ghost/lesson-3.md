# The Hangar
"International technology thieves are on their way here." The voice of Miguel's father comes over the earpiece he wears. There's a mini-microphone taped to his throat, underneath the mask. This is the only equipment they gave him.

Previous Ghosts fought with paired pistols, gas guns, grappling lines (David doesn't understand when his son describes this as a "hookshot"), and other gadgets. When Miguel asked, his dad said "doing this on your own is part of the test". His mom said, "I'm not letting you carry anything dangerous, my son. Be careful!" And his sister said, "stop being such a baby about it." So that was that.

These guys aren't ordinary thieves. They're high-tech pirates, armed with untraceable energy weapons and protected by stolen body armor. They're in town to nab some advanced levitation technology from Aspire, then get on board a plane with it. At least, that's what the Voice has told David. "They're waiting for the plane to come here. If you can get police on the scene by the time, they'll have enough to hold the plane's crew as well."

> Miguel Murphy, aka the Guardian Ghost, is the solo hero on the scene. There's an unknown number of bad guys. Miguel wants to sneak into the hangar invisibly and look for patrols or stragglers, then pick the guys off one by one, quietly. This sounds like **Assess the situation**, with the possibility that he'll be spotted. But first, Miguel tells his dad about this plan. While this is a test, Miguel reasons that it's also a real situation, and that every asset he has should count. His dad (and the GM) agree, so Miguel makes the **Words of the past** move first. Dad thinks this sounds like a good idea, so Miguel gets +1 ongoing to recon the hangar. He rolls +Superior with this +1 and gets an 8, enough for one question. "Who here is the most vulnerable to me?"

Miguel creeps into the hangar. There's stacked boxes, enough to hide behind, and they're scattered everywhere. It looks like the thieves brought several trucks in here with them, then unloaded where they parked. There are plenty of pallet jacks against the wall, enough to wheel this haul onto a cargo plane. The armored figures are moving around the hangar, checking and re-checking things. There's a few key figures at the center of the open space, talking about something. Miguel watches one figure, probably a woman, stroll behind one stack of boxes. A smoke break? An opportunity.

> "Does she have like a taser or stun-gun on her or something?" Miguel asks. The GM agrees she probably does. "I want to grab it invisibly, keep her from noticing, then tase her unconscious." He's not in a fight, where his opponent could get a hit back, but convincing someone not to notice his presence feels like it's pushing it, so the GM asks Miguel for an **Unleash your powers** move. This is still "taking out the vulnerable targets", so Miguel gets his +1 from the Assess. He rolls +Freak and gets a 14!

The scarred woman leans back against the boxes, extracting Belomorkanal cigarettes and a lighter from her pockets. She holds the cigarette to her lips and lights. Miguel is next to her, extracting the taser from her utility harness. She registers the slight tug as a memory of the feeling of pulling her smokes out, and ignores it. She feels the cigarette touch her lips, and then nothing. Wordlessly, she slumps down unconscious, and Miguel carefully catches both her and the lighter, to avoid a telltale noise that would draw the attention of the others.

Now he's got one of their radios, too. Too bad he doesn't speak Russian.
