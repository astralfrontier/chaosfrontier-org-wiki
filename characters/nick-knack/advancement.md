# Advancement
I really like the idea of Coming for You on Nick, it isn't specifically indicative of anything other than edge forming. And that edge could carry Nick in a lot of different directions.

Like you said, right now he has the nice-guy schtick which has him largely just defending and helping, but we got to see kind of an edge when he sort of forced his way through the explosive traps and it was really cool.

It was a very Bruce Willis in Die Hard way to handle the traps

And it was all very reminiscent of the spirit of "I'm coming for you"

Maybe Nick isn't the first guy to throw a punch but he could be the kind of guy to hold a grudge, especially with the way his powers interact with history and memory
