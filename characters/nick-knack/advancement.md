I could see Nick Knack taking different Protege abilities with his mom as his mentor, "Fireside chat" or "Be mindful of your surroundings" would both make a lot of sense

"Troublemaker" sounds interesting in its destructive aspect, and would mesh well with the Reality Storm flare, if I also took that. "I don't care what you think!" is the other one that makes obvious sense, if reskinned slightly.
"No good at being a kid" from the Nomad was one I'd thought about - change labels when you clear a condition. That'd be reflecting how Nick's powers typically work, where he receives feelings and impressions and those can overwhelm him

You've been doing a lot of protecting people, so maybe something like that Bull's "There when it matters" would fit

I also think that the Soldier "It Kinda Feels Personal" could apply to Nick, since he seems like he would take being mislead or betrayed pretty poorly
Nick also seems like he might be the type to be able to help others tap into potential they don't realize they have, so perhaps the Harbinger's "You Haven't Learned You Can't Do That Yet

I think from the Delinquent specifically, Criminal Mind could work for Nick for sure

A couple of suggestions from the Transformed could be: I Am Not My Body or Coming For You
I Am Not My Body playing into the Nova's control issues
