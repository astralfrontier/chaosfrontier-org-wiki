Breakthrough (Transformed). The Hybrians found you in the house fire and saved your life by turning you into this technopathic machine eater aboard their UFO. You're chosen, they say. Chosen for what? That, they won't say, only that they're coming back for you in time. Until then, you can read every email and every text on the planet thanks to your powers. You know what people think of you here. Maybe it won't be so bad somewhere else.
