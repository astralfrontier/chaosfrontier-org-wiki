# Background
Your visit to an experimental observatory ended when you were struck by a cosmic beam that encoded a dying civilization's collective wisdom. Now you've got all this knowledge and all this power, and it's threatening to burn its way out of your skull unless you do something with it.

## When did you first use your powers? 
## Who was the first person you accidentally hurt with your powers?
## Who, outside the team, helps you control your powers?
## Why do you continue to use your powers?
## Why do you care about the team?
