# Background
The King family has been in the adventuring business for generations, but **Jack King** was the first to imbue himself with powers via chemistry. Now, he fights a mortal enemy in the form of **Rex Talionis**, genius supervillain. From his science base, the Kingdom, located in Halcyon City, Jack disappears for months at a time, while Rex unleashes minions and hired goons to disrupt civilization from his secret volcanic lair, the Throne.

However, Jack and Rex used to be the same person. Jack performed a "gene separation" via magically-augmented chemistry, with his family's long-time ally **Cyrus the sorcerer**. The result was two people, one good, one evil.

Now Jack has disappeared. The rest of the King family, including siblings, uncles, and Jack's wife Alisha (the superheroine **Moonglow**), have to stop Rex Talionis's current master plan. And they've assembled a team...
# Characters
* A Legacy, Jack King's firstborn child, and inheritor of their father's unique abilities.
* A Scion, the child of Rex Talionis, who discovered (or was told) of the truth of the King legacy and their connection to it.
* An Innocent, the young Jack King himself. Summoned to the present by Cyrus, via a spell calling to "the true Jack King".
* A Harbinger from the future, where the Kingdom and the Throne finally fought a decisive battle - but how did it go?

Any other ideas?
# Options
* There's no need for Jack King to be male, flip sex/gender where you see it in the text.
* Jack's specific abilities, and anything the Legacy inherited from Moonglow, are undefined. Pick the power set you like, and whether you inherited powers from one parent over the other, or both.
* Ditto the Scion, although Rex's offspring might have unique powers of their own.
* The Innocent can be unpowered, or have some of Jack's abilities already.
