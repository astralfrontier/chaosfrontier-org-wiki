# Background

> **sonder**
> n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.

## When did you first use your powers?
I've always had a "feeling" about objects. I would pester my mother, a police detective named Anna, if she would let me help with cases. She never did.

## Who was the first person you accidentally hurt with your powers?
I touched a bundle of paperwork from the hospital and knew my father was not going to make it. I asked my mother about it, and she started to cry. I've run away from home once or twice since then.

## Who, outside the team, helps you control your powers?
Bernard Black, owner of a used bookstore, tells me stories and shares inspirational lessons (and gives me nostalgia-laden items to fuel my powers)

## Why do you continue to use your powers?
What use is it to sense how people feel, if I can't make them feel better?

## Why do you care about the team?
I can keep them safe, and they can help me find ways to help other people.
