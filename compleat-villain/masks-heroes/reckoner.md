# Background
High concept: "human Godzilla"

Example moments:

- Someone gives Erik shit during a team meeting. Erik stands up, breaks the table, and clearly looks ready to square up.
- Attacks from the air. Erik opens his jaw and unleashes a blazing hot mega-beam!
- A tough melee attacker gets near. Erik grabs them by the face and slams them skull-first into the ground, breaking it (for any value of "it").
- There's an inconvenient wall, and there might be a door somewhere around. Erik goes through the wall because he doesn't have time for that shit.
- The team is eating pizza. Erik will wolf it down, and go back for more. Having a half-dragon metabolism will do that to you.

## Who changed you?
Twenty years ago, heroes in Europe defeated a vast draconic monster called Titalion. A secret organization took samples, and realized that giant-monster DNA could be fused with human genetics, then started looking for candidates.

## How did you escape from them?
An independent adult hero raided the organization and discovered what was going on, and helped him escape.

## Who, outside the team, tries to take care of you now?
Erik stays at a shelter or encampment, protecting people there in exchange for some kind of companionship.

## Why do you try to be a hero?
He wants to meet some of the other children from the program, and fight them. Honestly, fighting other strong opponents would be good too.

## Why do you care about the team?
Apparently there's other things to do than fighting. What's up with that?
