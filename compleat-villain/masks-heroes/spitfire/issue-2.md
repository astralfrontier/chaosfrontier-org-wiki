# Recap

INT. Pariah's family home (2 weeks ago)

Pariah sitting alone in a hall.
Guy: what do you have planned after this?
Pariah: I have no idea
Guy: you know you can't stay here. Got any family? Friends?
Pariah: nope
Guy: I gotta take that chair
Pariah: who do you work for?
Guy: I'm just a contractor. They call me in to repo stuff, I don't make the rules
Guy hands Pariah $5
(Editor's note: about $58 in 2022 money)
Pariah teleports to knives in his room, starts packing

EXT. the street

Pariah has been sleeping at soup kitchens & the like.
He bumps into Saito aka Soju
(Some OOC negotiation about who wears a costume & has a secret identity)
Soju: (grabbing shoulder) hey, hang on
Pariah: you're that dude
Soju: I am that dude. And you're that dude
Soju: we're waiting for you to come find us, we've been hanging out
Pariah: (carrying suitcases and belongings) times are tough
Pariah: once I'm settled, I'll get back to you guys
Soju: I was going back to my place, lots of room
Pariah: I'll find a way to pay my way

INT. abandoned building under construction

Soju: check out this hidden carved-out squatter space I got
Pariah: this is your place?
Soju: technically not MY PLACE my place, but I live here
Pariah: so rent is gonna be super low
Time to get moved in!

INT. Rattlesnake's dojo

Glass is sparring with Rattlesnake, using size difference to advantage
Rattlesnake: you've gotten good
Glass: still a struggle to breathe
Rattlesnake: how's the hero crew going?
Glass: you saw me & Soju at the church? I think we did pretty well
Rattlesnake: how about patrols?
Glass: every chance I get, when I'm not at school or helping mom
Rattlesnake: can't imagine being a kid balancing school and superheroics
(Every Janus in the world: -_-)
Rattlesnake: How's your dad?
Glass: he's gotten used to fighting without Farrah, but he didn't need her
Rattlesnake: how's Farrah working with you?
Glass: we got a good connection
Dog petting ensues
Rattlesnake: I want to keep you safe, but it's not all fun & games. The hero world is dangerous. Don't bring a karate chop to a gunfight.
Glass: and I disappear!
Glass: I don't know how I could do this if I didn't have this power
Rattlesnake: Without powers, it's a lot harder than it looks
(Every Beacon in the world: -_-)
Glass: a purse snatcher grabs the edge of my costume & sends me tumbling! Hate the costume
Rattlesnake: you may want to rework it a bit, even if your dad is gung-ho about it. I'll talk to him.
Glass: it's okay, I'll work it out myself
Rattlesnake: don't mind talking to him, we're in Home Front
Glass: I wanna show that I can do this stuff on my own
Rattlesnake: nobody's truly on their own. You want to be independent, but at my age you realize you need people
(Label shift +Mundane -Savior)
Glass: I may already have some people in my corner
Rattlesnake: my team has had numerous mutual buttsaving moments, so that's good

Glass turns invisible and tries to sneak into bank basement
Glass wants Farrah to crack stone, enough to let her look into the room
Random dude: hey what are you dong?

Vic meets the bank manager.
Let's open the vault and call the police.
Glass is mortified
Spitfire: did you figure out what they wanted?
Glass: this safe right here
Manager: this is just some dude's random stuff. If he wanted money, he'd be going after the main vault
Upstairs, the Fiddler uses a harmonica to take control of everyone in the bank lobby

(Discussion about how much $5 is worth in 1948)
