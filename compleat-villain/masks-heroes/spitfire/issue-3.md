# Recap
EXT. rooftop near bank

Did Matterman find out about being locked in a vault? Who knew - the villain, the team, and the bank manager.
Spitfire & Glass meet on a rooftop near the bank
Spitfire: important question. you led me to 2 villains, what's the secret?
Glass: I'm a hero?
Spitfire: you fought villains, isn't that what heroes do?
Glass: we were investigating the grand wizard. Creepy guy in a robe cast spells on kids, tracing the kids led to the wizard. Just spotted him.
Spitfire: no villain activity? Sounds like being on the ground is better, I thought jet pack would be more useful
Spitfire: you could have called your dad. Are we Home Front, but who is the team you want to work with?
Glass: I'm trying to figure that out
Spitfire: if you want to be a hero with us, we're all the better for it
(Beacon vulnerability/weakness move)
Spitfire takes his helmet off
Glass: you were there! you're younger than I thought you'd be
Spitfire: if you ever know someone older who's a hero and you want to be that as well, that's me too
(Janus vulnerability/weakness move)
Handshake and label shift (+Mundane -Superior)
Glass: I know what it's like to be in someone's shadow, trust me, we're gonna get along just fine
Spitfire: there's a lot of people on this team who aren't what they seem 
Glass: we're all misfits!
(Spitfire's label shifts +Freak -Superior)

INT. Venture household (2 days later)

What are backgrounds? Laila is working class, living in "Little Baghdad", in an apartment. Vic's family is middle class, in a house, and he probably attends Halcyon High.
Morning at the Venture house. Vic beats his dad to the newspaper.
Local news, pg. 3: son of known traitor "Red Rat", Paul Porter has been taken in on suspicion of aiding/abetting the Grand Wizard.
Mom: that kid Paul is a commie mutant traitor
Vic: I'll watch out for the bad people, mom

INT. Nassif household

Glass has breakfast - kahi!
What does dad do? Dockworker
How does dad feel about working with other heroes? Dad threw newspaper at Laila: "the other shoe just dropped"
Laila: this isn't what happened, he was helping us
Dad: you sure about that?
Laila: would have been weird otherwise
Dad: what if he was part of this? You have to be careful about who you trust.
Laila will take it, more focused on the newspaper & trying to understand how this happened
Dad: how can you put your trust in a total stranger? He's a commie mutant traitor!
Laila: it was his dad that was a sympathizer. Parents aren't like their kids all the time.
Dad: you're too young to really understand how the world is. They don't think or act like us. All they know is evil.
Laila: (thinking) I could say the same thing about you
Dad: time for work. We'll talk later. Ditch that teenage hero team.
Laila: the others are still helping me, they aren't involved with the Red Rat
Dad: (leaving) PEACE
Mom: you're backtalking your dad more, but that's not done.
Laila: (crumpling paper) I'm heading to school
Mom: your dad has been doing this longer than you, his instincts about Paul are accurate
Laila: this sucks, I'm out

INT. Saito's hangout

One time nabbed Pariah off the street yesterday
What's Saito doing? He's a little concerned, but too soon to act. We don't know much about Paul. Maybe he's got other stuff going on?
Glass shows up
Glass: why the hell didn't you do anything?
Soju: Wut
(The newspaper is presented as evidence)
Soju: he said he went for a walk. Just did my thing
Glass: they pulled him off the street! He was helping us!
Glass: (punching a wall in glass form) I can think what I want to think about Pariah! He's a decent guy!
Soju: have you calmed down?
Soju: (grabbing first aid kid) gimme your hand
Soju: we should go visit him in prison, then find a way to spring him legally
(which prison? The newspaper article doesn't know)
Glass: that's fine, but I gotta go to school
Soju: okay, we'll all meet after school and go see him

EXT. county jail

Soju is going to be investigating during school day!
Scheming => 9, preparing himself => 10
Soju and Glass meet up, call Spitfire via radio for backup
We show up at county jail, in costume. It's a newer building.
Soju walks in, asks if him & friends can see a prisoner
Desk jockey: we don't allow that here
Soju: phone call?
Desk jockey: denied
Glass: did you not have a plan?
Soju: we're not legally allowed to visit him. Plan B is we find a way in
Spitfire: nobody would like that. But who's prosecuting him?
Glass: I think this can work
Glass heads for the door, putting out mature & confident hero vibes
Glass: I'm here on official Home Front business
Provoke => 8
Desk jockey: you with Matterman?
Glass: I'm affiliated
Desk jockey: we can't really allow you in
Glass: Home Front is after the Grand Wizard
Desk jockey: the Feds waved their jurisdiction in our faces & moved him outta here
Sounds like AEGIS took him
Vic has a terrible plan

INT. jail

Glass: let me talk to the Pied Piper
Desk jockey: gotta clear it with the supervisor
Cop: whatchuneeeeeeeed
Glass: let us talk to the Pied Piper
Cop: lemme see your ID
Glass: (gestures to Matterdog)
Cop: nobody comes in the club without an ID, junior
Glass assesses the situation => 5
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing twice and expecting different result
Soju assesses => 6, +1 team from Glass
Soju can get keys from the cop, but needs a distraction
Distraction => 13
Glass vanishes, goes to leave
Soju: she's getting away!
Provoke => 11
Soju opens the door into the prison...
