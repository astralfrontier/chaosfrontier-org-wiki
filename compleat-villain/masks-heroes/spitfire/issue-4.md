# Recap
Pariah: I bet you're wondering how I got here
(Brought to county, hauled in by AEGIS)

INT. plain white room

It's a classic Interrogation Room. Brushed steel table, 2 way mirror
Paul was dropped off here by AEGIS and has been waiting since then.
Good Cop (Freely) arrives with paperwork, Bad Cop (Binks) arrives and cops a 'tude
Good Cop: what's your relationship with the Grand Wizard, G. Arthur Libby?
Paul: team and I took him down & handed him off to you
Good Cop: he escaped 3 days ago
Paul: how'd that happen
Good Cop: that's why you're here
Bad Cop: we know you're involved!
Good Cop: just want to ask you a few questions. How'd you be associated with this team of yours?
Paul: The Wizard attacked me, we handed him off to you, we fought, we're not friends.
Bad Cop: or it's an elaborate ruse!
GC: So you weren't actually associated with the other heroes
Paul: not at the time, that's how we got introduced. Saw a bad guy, took him down.
Paul: I've been here before, how do I show you I didn't do anything wrong?
BC: don't give me that crap! It's awful convenient that you just showed up conveniently. We have TESTIMONY from WITNESSES.
BC: Mattergirl & Matterdog & Soju were recognized coming out of that building, we got their testimony
BC: the Rocket Ranger who assisted was seen coming in, but you were just... standing there. You malingerer.
Paul: was just going downtown, he got in my way, it was self-defense. You must have seen it. I mean, you were there.
Agents: uhhhh
BC: you two were collaborating. What did you talk to him about?
Paul: I'd like to assess the situation, officer => 8
What can we best end this quickly? The fuzz has nothing, so they're trying to get him to self-incriminate
Paul teleports to knives, "come arrest me when you have the right", Unleash => 9
Evidence room! Paul knocks over shelf with heavy stuff
Agents appear, draw weapons. "Freeze!"

EXT. chase scene

Glass is running from the police. Hides in an alley. Be sneaky => 13
Glass hits the brakes, they fly right past

INT. Zeppelin Zero

Soju sneaks into county jail.
Meanwhile, Vic heads to the Zeppelin
Vic: we need Paul back from AEGIS and also legitimacy
Dr. D: Paul Porter?
Vic: yessir
Doc: what do you think of him
Vic: he deserves a fair shake
Doc: you're looking for AEGIS facility? There's 3 bases in town, 30 where they might have taken him in this time
Vic: let's start with the local ones
Doc: how about I reach out with my contacts?
Vic: sure sure
Lots of gadgets aboard the zeppelin.
Vic radios in to check on teammates. Glass is back at the "base"
Any update? Spitfire is optimistic. Glass is not.
Glass: will they really let him go despite having no evidence?
Spitfire: well anything else would be un-American!
(lots of OOC choking on this)
Glass: just hope he didn't do anything stupid

INT. AEGIS base

Pariah has knives, staring down AEGIS agent.
Agent: stop right there
Pariah: I was just leaving
Agent: stay where you are. Put down the knives
Pariah: you have no legal right to keep me, I'm an American citizen. I'll take this to the press
Agent: put down the knives, hands on your head
Pariah throws a knife through the window, teleports to it into a hallway, picks a direction and runs.
It's Good Cop Bad Cop Bromance Squad! "Freeze!"
Pariah: (hands up) not trying to hurt anyone, just want to leave
Agent: if you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't have run
Pariah: just was trying to leave
Agent: you're resisting arrest, I'm placing you under arrest
Pariah: (throwing knives past them) I'm out PEACE => 8
Teleports just as bullet strikes.
"Don't let him get away!"
Pariah rides the Knifeway to get outside
Agents: "there's nowhere else to run!"
Pariah: (tossing knife into ocean) I'll find the Grand Wizard to prove it.
Escape! => 12

INT. Back at base

Spitfire flies back from the Zeppelin.
Glass: (playing with dog) so my dad said I can't hang out with you any more. Not going to listen to that. Not a fan of Pariah.
Spitfire: I guess everyone's breaking the law aren't they
Glass: don't know if I can go home after this. They knew who I was at county. If I keep spending time with you, I dunno what would happen if I went home. Might have to bunk with Paul & Soju.
Spitfire: what do you want to do?
Glass: don't want to have conversation with father, don't care if he listens.
Spitfire: it would change his mind if we proved Paul was a good guy
Glass: don't like talking about this stuff, bleh
Dr. Daedalus: good news and bad news. I know where they took him. He's no longer there
Spitfire: so he escaped
Glass: (nodding) yeah that's my guy
Dr. D: doesn't look good. Not sure he's innocent.
Spitfire: do you know what they brought him in for?
Dr. D: they didn't say
We're going to have to recapture the Grand Wizard.
Soju appears! Farrah slobbers in greeting.
We fill in Soju about the latest developments
Soju: (Owen Wilson) wow
Glass: you okay?
Soju: Fiddler knew nothing. Found my dad in jail though.
Glass: Spitfire, we told you about Soju's parents? The camps?
Soju: he got picked up on vagrancy charges
Glass: does he know where your mom is?
Soju: I asked but he changed the subject
Glass: you found him! good news.
Soju: we're going to get him out right?
Glass: government put him in this situation. This is un-American
Spitfire: !
Spitfire: okay I got a plan. We're gonna be the best superhero team ever.
Soju: (crying) I'm just glad I know where he is

EXT. the desert

Pariah is walking, hallucinates Spitfire having a long discussion about the telephone system in the 1940s
Pariah calls repo guy, who doesn't want to help. Provoke => 4
Repo guy: (totally suspiciously) how about I ... come and getcha
Pariah plans to commandeer a car once they show up

INT. the base

Spitfire is going to go find Pariah on the road
Glass will head home to confront dad
Vic: (supportive thumbs up)
Glass: Soju, you going to be okay tonight?
Soju: it's me, I'm always fine
Glass will change & head home. Glass informs Soju that Spitfire knows her secret ID.
Spitfire: we're gonna make things better for everyone. No one here is alone.

INT. Laila's apartment

Mom is home, Dad isn't.
Mom: how was your day?
Laila: it was eventful. I got some perspective on some things.
Mom: (ignoring what happened that morning) that's good
Laila: if you want, on Saturday we can go to the market? Get some fresh fruit, honey?
Mom: that would be nice
Dad gets home at 3am, apparently has someone else with him
In closet, stuffed under clothes in a panel, there's a box. Laila's thinking about that.

EXT. the desert

The Good Cop Bad Cop Bromance pull up in a car near Paul
Spitfire is overhead
What does Paul do? => 5
Agent: holy Toledo! Is that a Rocket Ranger?
Spitfire: hello gentlemen
Agent: what's going on?
Spitfire: heard there was an escape, was curious about it
Agent: we could use the assistance. We had someone under surveillance, following lead to get the Grand Wizard
Spitfire: are you looking for Grand Wizard, or Paul Porter?
Agent: listen here, don't worry about who we're looking for. Just go along, help get a cat out of a tree
(can Paul hear this? Not the conversation)
Paul stabs his way into the conversation, is going to Moment of Truth the Bromance.
Spitfire: everyone today has told me not to trust you. If you tell me I can, I'll believe you
(Discussion about hero morality - Pariah took a bullet, but didn't kill the agents)
# Updates
* Pariah is now wanted by AEGIS for resisting arrest
* Soju found his father (and became an NPC)
