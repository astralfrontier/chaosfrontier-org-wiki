# Recap

## EXT. dark alley

We jump into the initial fight - Home Front's "Beastman" is defeated.
Glass: WTF
Hellstorm: what's the matter?
Glass: this isn't just some scumbag Nazi, he's in the Home Front with the gang! He's supposed to be a hero
Killer Queen: doesn't look like a hero to me
Glass: he's always been perfectly fine to me
Sin Hunter: I can bring forth this man's sins
(did SH's powers manifest earlier? maybe, but the team might not have recognized what they were)
Commandant: so exactly what can you do?
SH: every mortal carries their sins with them, I can bring them to life
Commie: how exactly do you do that?
SH: uhh hard work & exercise
(Discussions about Doom track and power use - dark visions appear in book, and are based on memory)
SH wants to read his sins => 4
He's not house trained but nothing more definite
Commie: we should question him
Glass: nobody's going to believe us! He's an adult hero!
Spitfire: hey Hellstorm, can you trap werewolves?
Hellstorm: I haven't tried this spell before
(rope bondage spell traps Beastman)
Commie calls Dr. Reeves for a base. Can we keep secrets? Yes.

As we're walking, Glass talks to Spitfire
G: I have to tell them about this guy
S: how do you know they're all good?
G: dunno. But I have to tell them something
S: I agree. But what are you concerned about?
G: I have this box. If I open it, I can tell them the truth about my dad. But they may not believe me. There's nothing special about me.
(vulnerability or weakness)
S: it's more than your word, you have all these other heroes plus evidence. It's not just you any more, you have a team.

## INT. secret lair

Commie: Glass, can you stand lookout by that door? Stay hidden?
Glass is unhappy about being on guard duty
Commie: anything we can use to wake him up?
(Smelling salts, Beastman wakes up suddenly)
Beastman: you got me, now what are you gonna do with me?
SH: You must name his sins
Commie: we caught you in the act, attacking Hellstorm and Killer Queen
Beastman: oh no, I sometimes lose control of my powers
Glass: (punches Beastman across the jaw) the goddamn Nazi symbol on your arm is not a mistake
Beastman: Laila?
Glass: what were you doing? Don't give me this "no control" bull. You meant to do this. You're a friend of the family! How could you?
Pierce the Mask => 7
What are you really planning?
BM: I'm the next stage in evolution. How can you stand around playing hero? Real monsters are here.
BM: there's a war coming. The one in Europe is over, but here it's just beginning. We're taking over. You don't know how deep this all goes. You make me sick, working with your father, a Jew.
(Killer Queen punches Beastman)
BM: what the hell is wrong with you? You were supposed to be our champion. Do you have any idea of the resources we wasted on you?
KQ: clearly not enough.
SH: KQ, are you connected with this dude?
KQ: not this fool
Commandant wants to use SH's Penance Stare vs. Killer Queen => 7
KQ: what the hell are you doing? Doing whatever weird magic? You think I'm a Nazi. They experimented on me for months. I'm not one of them. I didn't choose to work with them
Commie: now I know that
KQ: now you KNOW that?
SH: that's not what I was trying to say
Commie: would you rather we all distrust Killer Queen? She's not in cahoots with this guy
Beastman: you don't need my help tearing yourselves apart. Aren't you people supposed to be heroes?
Spitfire: aren't you?
Beastman: you think you're such hot shit in that jetpack of yours? Mano e mano
Spitfire: I've learned that I can't trust Nazis to fight fair
Beastman: I heard the same thing about Americans

(Some retcons happen around here)
Sin Hunter: you're messing with powers beyond your comprehension
Commandant: (to Sin Hunter) you have to use callous methods to get things done
Use of Influence, SH rejects => 9

Glass: you're gonna tell us about these allies. Who are you working with?
BM: what do you know about the Order of the Round Table?
Glass: we beat up your Grand Wizard
BM: so you're the little shits who did that. The guy's kind of a jerk.
BM: yeah, working with the Knights of the Round Table
Glass: what are they planning?
BM: Ruling the world, obvs. We're bringing back the true Aryan leaders of old.
Glass: I can't wait to see you rot in prison for life
BM: Pack a lunch, you'll be waiting awhile.

Killer Queen has stormed off. Sin Hunter follows.

## EXT. outside the secret lair

KQ: was looking for a bathroom where I could change
SH: I could turn my back if you want to change
KQ: you have the same freaky mind powers as Commandant
SH: he just borrowed them from me, and I'm still learning them
KQ: at least you aren't abusing them like him
SH: "Commander Copycat"
KQ: that's a terrible name
SH: I can't imagine what it must have been like for you
KQ: I've gotten over it
SH: glad we could help you out at least, it was nice to meet other people in our line of work
(Sin Hunter is not using his Batman voice right now)
KQ: turn around though, I do need to change
SH: don't take this the wrong way but you look pretty magical
KQ: I stg if you have X-Ray vision I will destroy you
SH: studying musty tomes is my thing, you think you've seen it all and then boom
KQ: What do we do about the Beastman?
SH: we gotta figure it out
KQ: I can punch him again
(They go back into the hideout)

## INT: secret lair

Beastman has revealed unsettling details of his plan so far
Glass: let's turn him over to AEGIS
Spitfire: cool
Glass: why are you cool with that?
Spitfire: Wizard got away because he has mind control. Beastman is just furry and racist.
Who knows how to contact AEGIS?
Commandant: we can ask Dr. Reeves (Mentor) what to do about this guy
Note: Dr. Daedalus & Dr. Reeves are rivals
Commie: boss we busted Beastman, what do we do with him
Reeves: you did what
Commie: he's restrained in one of your secret lairs. He's a Nazi with some grand scheme.
Reeves: stay put.

Hellstorm: yo can I drop this spell
Commandant: few more minutes
Glass is supportive. Farrah can sit on Beastman & turn to stone if needed.
We find some replacement restraints

Meanwhile, Beastman tries flattering Commandant with bullshit: "you were the leader"
Commie: just because the team needs a leader doesn't mean others don't play their part
BM: with your skills you could be a real leader of men. You want to be stuck in some second-tier junior squad?
Commie: (pointing at rope) I think I'm already on the winning team
BM: this is temporary. I'm not going to jail to rot. What crime have I actually committed?
Commie: you attacked these people
BM: heroes do what they have to do. Word of a respected member of the Home Front means more than a bunch of kids
Commie: what's your point?
BM: this isn't going to end well for your kids. I like how you think. I want to give you a chance to be on the right side of this.

Dr. Reeves arrives.
Reeves: (untying Beastman) OMG
Glass: HOLD ON. He is a literal Nazi. He confessed!
What the Hell Hero => 9, +1 team from Commandant
Glass wins over Hellstorm, gains Influence over Dr. Reeves
Exchange between Dr. Reeves & Beastman about "who will you trust".
The safe house is compromised, but oh well.
Dr. Reeves: you need to respect me. Call me first. Don't just invite these random kids into my lair.
Commandant: I made the best call I had in the moment.
Reject => 5
Dr. Reeves talks to Hellstorm. "I want to enlist your help. Unsure how to proceed."
Dr. Reeves: what can we actually charge him with?
Glass: isn't it illegal to be a Nazi?
Dr. Reeves: you don't want to open that can of worms
Spitfire: this guy is an associate of the Grand Wizard
Dr. Reeves: that changes things
KQ: it's not illegal to be a Nazi, just a terrorist?
Dr. R: Terrorist is worse than not terrorist.
KQ: Nazi is worse than not Nazi
Dr. R: generally. but "Nazi Terrorist".... anyway.
Dr. R: I'll call AEGIS. But this will cause problems. This was unprecedented.
Glass: a bunch of things, like being a hero, are unprecedented
Dr. R: you're a smartass
Glass: I've been told that
Dr. R: I'll stay here and watch this guy. Commandant, go home. Rest of you, I want to (choke) thank you
Glass: thank you for trusting us
Dr. R: gonna need all the help I can get to see that this actually amounts to something. Stay vigilant, stay heroes. Be careful who you trust.
