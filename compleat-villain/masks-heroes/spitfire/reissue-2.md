# Recap

## MOVIE TRAILER GUY

Beastman is AWOL but nobody's talking about the case
Reeves is less trusting about Commandant
Last few days:
Commandant is avoiding patrol, hanging out with sister. Boarding school cover story.
Why does sister keep secret, despite bad blood? Sibling squabbling but it's not true hostility, they're still family.

## INT. lunch meeting

Sis: why are you here?
Tom: needed to get away, wandered by, thought I'd stop in
Sis: whazup
Tom: things aren't great at "school". My "teacher" is unhappy.
Sis: can we cut the Three Days of the Condor crap?
Tom: I thought I was doing okay, but Reeves kicked my ass
Tom: I got a team now, they seem okay, but I gave away a base I shouldn't have
Sis: does Reeves disapprove of the team?
Tom: he was kinda weird about it, maybe I should be more cautious
Sis: people in danger need teams. You need people to watch out for you
(Label shift, Sis has to go)

## INT. Lancaster's Flowers

Vic has just delivered a package! For Lancaster's Flowers.
Got an order for Dr. Reeves, 1800 Fairview St.
In the background, Vic is looking for the Grand Wizard by studying city maps
Suddenly everything's shaking!
Giant brass legs stride past.

## INT. Sin Hunter's abode

Sam is looking through Tome of Terrors to learn about Beastman aka Chris
Igor, the imp aide, thinks he has a book! There's a robot in the book!
(long discussion about powers and audio problems)

## EXT. city street

Laila sees Sin Hunter (as mist cloud) drift past, then sees robot!
Vic makes excuses and goes to get his outfit on (from where it's concealed in an alley)
Commandant walks out of Macy's & hears announcement about robot
Time to enter combat!
Glass spots Spitfire flying, waves him down
Spitfire uses the Z-gun to drain robot energy => 7
Glass tells Farrah to get on crowd control, starts climbing a fire escape
Sin Hunter materializes near Glass, she goes right through. Get to the roof!
Commandant reports to Dr. Reeves that it's robot fightin' time
Does he know Glass is around? Farrah is here, so it's a safe bet.
Commandant wants to borrow Glass's power to mask his face? Unleash => 9
Commie scopes out the robot, assess => 9
What can I use to disable the robot? Collapse the joints. Problem is that it's tall.
Spitfire grabs a flailing robot arm to unbalance & send it falling => 7
Jetpack is damaged and will need repairs

Meanwhile, Glass & Sin Hunter reach the top of the roof
Glass books it across the roof & jumps, trying to land on arm or shoulder => 10
Does it have a face? Kiiinda? Eyes, and a mesh speaker/grill that's mouth-like
Is there a robot pilot for Sin Hunter to copy from? Kinda
Glass: Sin Hunter, I need a crowbar or something to break this open!
Sin Hunter goes to obtain one

Commandant: Spitfire, it's me! I got a plan
Spitfire: (pinned to a wall) yeah how ya doing
Commandant: we can disable it if we overload it with electricity. You're the most mobile one here.
Sin Hunter shows up with the crowbar
Commandant climbs up & chips brick wall to free Spitfire
Robot swings an arm at Glass. Glass tries to judo out of the way, "stop hitting yourself" => 6, +1 from Sin Hunter who acts as distraction/escape plan
Glass takes a powerful blow => 10, falls off the robot
The shock of the robot hitting itself frees Spitfire, who grabs Glass on the way down => 12
Glass: I did it Vic! (passes out)
Sin Hunter enters the gap, finds a brain. That's spooky.
Sinsight! => 7
A German soldier, hurt during the war, drafted into a superscience program. This robot has been inactive for a few years, and it's weird for someone to drop such a complex expensive asset on us like this.

Can Sin Hunter remove the brain-tainer without killing him? Probably not.
Sin Hunter reports back to the team.
What can we do about it?
Commandant will go track down the robot's path. Farrah is guarding Glass, who's propped up against a wall.
Tracks lead back to a point where it just appears.

## INT. Dr. Reeves' place

Vic shows up to deliver stuff.
Pipe on the ground, newspaper that fluttered down
Vic finds burning tea pot, takes it off the heat
Looks like Dr. Reeves disappeared. Gasp!
