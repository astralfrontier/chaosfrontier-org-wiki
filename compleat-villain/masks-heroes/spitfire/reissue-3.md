# Recap
What was Claire doing while the team fought a giant robot?
Tiny robots?

## INT. church on Sunday

Sophie goes to church with mom. Some undefined Protestant denomination.
Priest: there's a situation going on downtown, a giant robot is on Main Street. We can trust the city's officials to deal with this.
Does mom know? Yeah, but they don't talk about it
Priest: update, situation downtown is taken care of with minimal property damage
Sophie tries to bail, mom catches her
Mom: not sure I want you cavorting down there with that problem
Sophie: I'll be back before dinner
Mom: ...

## EXT. downtown, post-fight

Cops are here to do cop stuff
Glass wakes up after a minute, tries to regain conscious casually. Farrah hangs out
EMTs question Glass, want to take her in for observation
Cops take a statement from Spitfire
Cop tells a story about Rocket Rangers in the Battle of the Bulge
Meanwhile, Sin Hunter was interviewed. Did some thinking about the giant robot's brain's loyalties
Do we know Killer Queen's civilian ID? We recognize her but don't know her name
Glass spots KQ heading to the crime scene as Sophie
Sophie has a giant duffle bag containing the staff
Glass: we missed you during the fight
Sophie: I was in church
Glass: btw there's a German soldier brain in there
Glass: we got this wrapped up though, Commandant ran away, Spitfire & Sin Hunter are tanking the cops. Nobody else cares about talking to me
Sophie: let the boys get all the attention
Glass: (hooks arms with Sophie) let's do some patrolling, girls' night out
Sophie: now?
Glass: maybe we can get another giant robot to fight

Spitfire: how'd you know to come down here?
Sin Hunter: they were foretold by the Tomes of Terror
Spitfire: any other tomes? Stuff we can use to keep in touch
Sin Hunter: I only read the tomes
Spitfire: well don't be a stranger
Sin Hunter: I should retain my tether to mortals. Plus I don't have family
Spitfire: you may not have family, but everyone needs friends
Sin Hunter: I forget what it's like to have friends
Spitfire: why are we fighting, if not to defend the ability to live peacefully and have friends
Sin Hunter: the voice commanded me to punish the wicked, and all I remember is the darkness
Spitfire: (pointing to people cleaning up after attack) just watch people cooperating & helping out
Sin Hunter: think there's any value in that?
Spitfire: sure. otherwise, why are you punishing the wicked?
Sin Hunter: I'll do that

## INT. Reeves' house

Vic finds Reeves' house empty, pipe is no longer lit but fell on the floor. Tea boiled out.
Vic bails, heads to Dr. Daedalus and the zeppelin

## EXT. Halcyon City

City patrol! Skulking in alleyways, looking for trouble.
They foil a purse snatching, but otherwise it's pretty quiet so they're chilling by a trash can
Farrah can turn to stone to prevent being moved, but can move herself
KQ: gonna let her eat out of the garbage
Glass: she's fine. Farrah is an angel, she's going to outlive me
KQ: so it's okay
Glass: she's my favorite girl (scritches)
Farrah uses powers to keep eating
KQ: anything going on with your dad?
Glass: He's Matterman
KQ: sounds like you have some complicated daddy issues
Glass: hoo boy. It's where I got my powers
Glass: but dad won't let me go out without monitoring since all I can do is turn into glass
kQ: glad that not much crime is happening, so we can hang out
Glass: I'm glad too, because everything hurts. But I'm not used to friends

## INT. Zeppelin Zero

Doc: hey kid. want some tea?
Beastman got captured, Reeves disappeared, Commandant ran off
Vic is worried about Daedalus too
Doc: there's spectral phenomena in the city, someone is opening tears in spacetime
Vic: big enough to bring a giant robot through?
Doc: maybe, not sure. There's 3 portals - robot might be one, Reeves the second, one unaccounted for
Vic: I'll ask a friend
Vic: hey can you teach me how to repair the rocket?
Doc: oh sure
(Vic can now repair the jet pack!)

## EXT. Satanic cookout

Sin Hunter watches people around the fight, then heads to post-service social activities
There's a pot luck! Sin Hunter mists out to find something to bring, brings eggs
Dude: thanks for the eggs. You related to the family?
SH: the what?
Dude: this is a private family affair
SH: uhhh I'm a friend of the family
Sin Hunter's getting a load of peoples' sins as he goes for a burger
The burger does not work out, old lady tries to help, more sins are exposed
Sin Hunter tries to mist away, disappointed that finding good in people may not work
One by one, people are calling out their sins, and he can't escape
A little boy: I like to shoot rocks at my cat!
Woman: I'm abusive to my boyfriend!
Old man: I killed several people, it was an accident
(more and more stuff comes out)
The world goes gray and freezes
Mysterious person appears - it's the Archivist!
Archivist: hello Sam
SH: I knew it wouldn't be the big guy putting me through this
Archivist: oh yeah, I'm the rain on the big guy's sunny days. How are you enjoying my home?
SH: Igor's great, I don't mind the rain
Archivist: I know about your new friends. How long can you last around them? How long until you corrupt them?
SH: don't act like you're not the one behind their impromptu confessions
Archivist: it's a side effect, nothing I control. You think I'm just a selfish old man bent on destruction & chaos
Archivist: have a conversation with that friend of yours with the jet pack
SH: what do I have to fear?
Archivist: nothing to fear, much to learn. You might be surprised to see Dr. Reeves has gone missing
SH: we'll find him
Archivist: in some state. When was the last time you saw that other friend? The one who borrowed your powers? btw great job keeping those divine powers secure
SH: he's continuing our investigation
Archivist: seen him recently?
SH: it's only been a couple hours
Archivist: I'm sure when he finds the clues he'll come running back to you
SH: find a better use of your time than spying on me
Archivist: I used to have a job, but now I got all kinds of free time. Get back to your job.
Archivist: I'm out PEACE

Cookout resumes, everyone's confused
SH turns to mist

## INT. the library in the boonies

Spitfire calls Glass, heads to the library. Glass and KQ get the message.
Glass & KQ get to the library first. It's creepy but there's a generator noise that's creepier
Igor opens the door. Glass isn't sure about this.
KQ: we're here for Sin Hunter?
Igor: Mathter, you have visitors!
SH: welcome to the sanctum
KQ: you really live here?
SH: "live"
Glass travels to an incredible place, yaay Beacon
Mahogany and glass, books, light. Big double doors.
Glass gets an idea based on Tomes of Terror - is there a filing system?
Glass: is this how you spend your days, hunting down sinners?
SH: it's Igor who does the organizing, I've been trying to find Beastman's story but haven't found anything yet. Surely he's well documented somewhere
KQ: can't ask Igor to grab it for you?
SH: I've asked him for it
Glass: is Igor your slave?
SH: it feels like it's the other way around
SH: yo, Igor, how about the Beastman inquiry?
Time to use the sanctuary move! Requirements: find the book (help from Igor), face danger (anyone else living in the Library? yes)
It's going to take 30 years, because all we have is his first name
What do we know about Beastman? He's got an adjustable Werewolf slider bar. Wasn't a founding member, but got involved early. He's a Nazi!
While this is going on...
SH: KQ, how familiar are you with magic matters?
KQ: I have a staff, and it's magic?
SH: Igor looks like a devil, but he's an imp. Know how to deal with those types of beings?
KQ: I don't know the first thing about magic, I just use it
SH: we don't get much sunlight around here
KQ: you keep your windows covered up
SH: that's on Igor's TODO list, drawing the curtains
KQ: so we going to sit here and wait?
Glass is down to things like "doesn't like cheesecake". We're down to 3 days.

Spitfire arrives.
Spitfire: magical portals took Dr. Reeves and dropped a giant robot on us. There was a third.
SH: not sure I want to ask Igor about this, he's finally focusing on the Beastman question
SH: maybe I can try searching by myself (Dark Visions!)
Where can Dr. Reeves can be found? In chairs, side by side with Annika Hellstrom, looking drained
The Archivist is there! They're in a pocket dimension
Glass: what's that?
SH: it's my Nemesis, he's taunting me
Glass: why are all the magic people Nazis?!
How do we get there? Through a portal in the Library
Glass: I don't think we're getting home in time for dinner
SH: just watch out, it's ghasts vs. guests in here
