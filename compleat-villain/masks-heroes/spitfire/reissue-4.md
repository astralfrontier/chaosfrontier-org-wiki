# Recap

## INT. creepy ass library

Glass starts making changes to her costume - removes a puffy part off the neck
Sin Hunter warns the team about the Archivist's powers
There are ghasts here - created by sins associated with powerful emotion
Third ghast has sharp teeth, like a bear trap. It spots Killer Queen, and lunges
Time to enter battle as a team! Sin Hunter's the leader
Ghast bites KQ's neck, but this thing gets through (powerful blow => 7)
SH: do we need to Pierce the Mask to read the ghast's vulnerability? It's generally unhelpful
SH tries to conjure a construct => 4, briefly summons a black hole
Spitfire shoots the ghast with the Z-gun => 7, so far so good
Glass tries to get Sin Hunter's attention, C&S => 9, the light at the end of the tunnel is Matterdog
Killer Queen steps back, recovering from injury
Glass + Matterdog do a combo attack => 9, +1 team from Vic as decoy
create an opportunity for allies, take something from them - the book it was feeding from
Glass takes a powerful blow => 7, struggles past the pain
SH grabs the book. A drunkard in 1302 Prussia beat his wife. SH tries to turn this into a vodka tsunami => 10
The ghast is drowned, and books are knocked down

Should Glass turn back with these injuries? Probably a bad idea.
Killer Queen is covering neck with hand, Vic administers first aid. C&S => 7, KQ does not open up

## INT. inner sanctum

SH leads the way, opening doors and such
The jet pack's power reading is flickering. There's more ghasts, including the one we defeated earlier
Spitfire takes off, trying to distract the ghasts
Glass runs to help Sin Hunter open the door
KQ takes up a combat stance
Spitfire tries to get them to follow => 4, but it seems to be making them bigger
One lunges at KQ, she responds with flash of light from staff => 10
Lead ghast lunges at Sin Hunter, Spitfire body checks => 9
Spitfire takes a powerful blow => 8, marks Afraid and Insecure

## EXT. dead forest

We can't see the ground very well. There's a pinkish mist with lavender sky.
Time stops, Sin Hunter confronts the Archivist
Archivist: (greasier) welcome Sam, wondered how long it would take you to come
SH: respect the mantle, it's Sin Hunter
Archivist: soz, forgot your silly hero name. Rescued any cats from trees?
SH: free my friends
Archivist: that's not me, it's just how people are when I'm near
Sin Hunter tries to read Archivist's sins, gets a psychic backlash
Archivist: naughty naughty
Archivist: your friends are two hours' walk that way, watch out for thorns
Archivist: oh, and do something about that human or he's going to die
(time resumes)
Sin Hunter: you probably didn't notice anything but the Archivist was just here
Spitfire is bandaging himself up as best he can, Glass takes over, +2 team from Sin Hunter & Killer Queen
SH: the Archivist is removed from the realm of mortal existence, you can't perceive his presence
Spitfire: if he freezes time, we can't fight him
SH: I'll try to kite him away. I don't know if he's pulling me into some kinda astral space or what
Spitfire: what does he want?
SH: he likes taunting me
Glass: is he a Nazi wizard? Let's go punch him
SH: maybe he's just messing with me. Spitfire, you sure you're okay?
Spitfire: I guess I gotta be
Glass: Killer Queen, guess we get to fight a giant monster after all
KQ: we'll take it down, won't be much of a fight

## EXT. the long path

During the walk, Glass will try to switch back to human form (take a powerful blow => 9), nearly passes out
Vic offers aspirin and a flight glove to use as a stress ball
Note: Sin Hunter has yet to try embodying his own sins, but it's probably not possible
Sin Hunter: I tried exposing the Archivist's own sins but it failed. If he pulls me out of time, I need some sins to draw on
Glass: I volunteer as tribute!
Sin Hunter: it's not really harm
Glass: (thinking) He can't look at Spitfire, my stuff is okay
Are there thorns? Yes, but nothing bad yet
