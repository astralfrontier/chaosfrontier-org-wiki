## Runeclaw

A fierce Norse warrior is denied entry into Valhalla by the Valkyries: "you fight well, it's true, but you do not care a whit for your fellows. You thirst for battle, but you have no place at the table in celebration afterward." So they curse this person with three things: immortality, regeneration, and always-on empathy, to feel the pain and joy of everyone around them. You can add a little offensive power by adding tattooed runes of lightning and stone or the like, to let their body manifest elemental weapons. The result should be a hard-drinking, hard-fighting warrior who'll inevitably be drawn into the emotional lives of those around them. Could be whatever gender you like.

Inspired by Marvel's Wolverline.

## Breakthrough

A war vet becomes a second-generation superhero, thanks to a buried alien artifact under his parents' house. The artifact infuses him with nanotechnology capable of regenerating any injury, along with fully functional (if obviously alien) prosthetics. However, to keep the nanotech powered and himself healthy, he must return to the house once every 24 hours.

This is complicated by his wife, who needs to live closer to her work, and their daughter, as well as neighborhood gentrification, increasing property taxes, and other challenges to home ownership.

## Sam Echevarra

Sam is a professional attorney, and superhuman. She has a variety of super-powers: increased intelligence, enhanced senses, flight, super-durability, and more.

While some super-intelligent supers focus on science or technology, Echevarra devotes her amazing brain power to law. She has an encyclopedic knowledge of the law at different levels. She has devised numerous innovative legal strategies. She has argued in front of the Supreme Court on a few occasions. Her proposals for clarifying amendments to existing law have frequently been accepted by legislators.

Echevarra specializes in prosecuting hard-to-reach crime bosses or influential public figures. She has been both prosecutor and defender. She has successfully repelled several hits on her from the underworld. She has no long-term relationships due to the danger of her job, and often keeps even her coworkers at arm's length to protect them. Despite this social distance, she remains committed to her job.
