After a stop off at 'base' to tithe up, Windwalker also asks for a companion. Because it's restin' time, and Windwalker has miles to go before he sleeps. Some murmurs are spread before an old aquaintence of Windwalker's is drudged up. Barely in control of his sanity as well, Dag Nabbit, an old roommate, agrees to tag along. "You don worry 'bout nuttin'. Leave it all to me." The younger addict says, before the two are off for a date with a datebook.

The issue, basically, is withdrawal. Windwalker's brain has fused together with itself at uncountable different points as a result of the regular ingestion of Axon-5. This was deliberate - the whole point of the nootrope, after all, was to stimulate intelligence, and intelligence is little more than a measurement of the complexity of neural interconnection.

The hunter is concerned - concerned enough to drag another of his kind in to act as backup. Because once his brain stops getting the drug, the artificially constructed pathways will start to degrade. His brain, so used to the external stimulation to generate more of its own unique chemicals, will stop doing so. The connections will start to fade. His rapport with 'Big Brother' - the other, magical personality in his mind - will become damaged, although not permanently at first. But the thought of splitting into two selves, of losing the monumental clarity he's felt for months now, privately terrifies him. Some of the elders use the term 'autism', but the shamans of the Lodge know it by a simpler term. Loss.

The timing of such effects is somewhat hazy at best. And according to the calculator, Windwalker isn't due until about the time that contact will be made with Mr. Johnson's PDA. But such is the way with drugs, and brains. Predeiction is much like a horserace.

The pair make their way, more or less, to Portos. 'least, that's what everyone calls it now. Seemingly Mr. Johnson's favorite meetup spot, the pair manage to make it into the resturaunt, and take a seat at the table in the corner, again, as has happened several times before.

A familiar, at least to WIndwalker, presence is felt there, as skittish and fast as when he was first seemed. "Meep Meep Zip Bang!" Dag Nabbit manages, as he, too, detects the PDA spirit. As the two get settled, a waitress looks over in your direction, trying to make contact.

"Coffee," Windwalker mumbles, not sure whether the waitress heard him. His head is buzzing, and with the rationale of the dedicated alcoholic, he decides that a stimulant is just the thing to make this go away.

The waitress looks at your partner. "Nothin' for me." He manages, before he sits across from you. THe PDa spirit scrambles up to you, and looks for a moment.

Windwalker waves carefully. "I am Windwalker of the Lodge," he recites, using his personal formulation for greeting such creatures. "I honor you and the planet."

The spirit's presents zips back and forth. The waitress comes with your coffee, as Dag Nabbit pulls a old pad out of his coat pocket, setting it on the table. As this happens the PDA spirit hovers near it,a nd it blinks to life, the screen spelling out the words. "Welcome to you. What is it you desire?" in large letters.

Windwalker smiles appreciatively at the coffee, although he doesn't drink yet. His fingertips press themselves against the tabletop. He feels the texture there, alien and somehow rough. His fingers are tingling. "We want to know the true identity of the man whose PDA you inhabit," he explains.

The spirit has something weighting on his mind. A sadness. It is not triggered by your question, indeed, it has been there since you arrived. THe pad clears it's screen. "Man, I thorght that old thing was broken." Dag Nabbit chimes in, before he starts looking arounf the bar. "He is known to me as Mr. Johnson." the pad reads. The words stay for a bit, then fade, "Perhaps this is not what you seek."

Windwalker shakes his head, thinking of how to convey what he wants. He takes hold of the coffee mug, but pulls his fingers back and winces slightly when the heat penetrates. "I think it's just an alias. But we should help each other. We may need more help from you to find this man out. But, here we are now. How can we help you first?"

"Just so. There is some I can tell you, but possibly not all that you seek." The words appear, then fade. As you speak that you might help the spirit. The presence paces a bit, then writes, "Hold me up to your ear." The words appear.

THe pad is about the size of a piece of paper, but has a speaker at one end. Touching the pad, it feels cold, almost painfully so, in Winwalker's numbing fingers. But he listens all teh same. A soft, non descript voice speaks. "Though the device that I inhabit is almost a baby in this world, I am much older. You make call me Ifi'naan. I was a fire spirit at first, praised, and talked to by many who roamed this land."

"As the times grew, the humans grew deaf to out voices, and we have to move from fire, to something that was still a central focus." Ifi'naan sighs into the speaker, "That was when we had to part. My flame, my other. We were seperated. We would spend nights dancing across the sky for the humans. But now, there are those who can hear us once more."

"She never stopped with the fire, loving the warmth, the glow. I fear, now, she may be lost. But please... I must know..." The spirit voice fades... waiting.

Windwalker thinks slowly. "Fire is fire," he says at last. "It comes and goes. The only one that stays is the sun." The feeling in his fingertips isn't going away, restoring itself to normal. It stays. He twitches a bit. "If you tell us more of what you seek, we'll do whatever we can to find it."

"I wish to be with her again. I feel that she must be out there." The voice pauses, then speaks again, "I do not know what humans use fire for, anymore. It's all the cold glow of LED."

Windwalker swallows. So far his employment prospects have amounted to 'search the world for someone, given a name if you are lucky that day', and the buzzing in his head is getting louder and more obnoxious and it seems to have personally singled him out for this and oh bother. "We use fire industrially," he explains. "Fireworks. Rockets. Incineration plants. Uh.. I don't know, but there's a lot. This other, does she have a name, something?"

"Gadhula was as she was known to me once." The spirit answers. "When we were parted, she said something about ceremony or magesty." The spirit explains.

Windwalker nods slowly. He finally takes a sip of his coffee. Fortunately nothing stands in the way of his regretting this decision immediately, so he gets right to it. After coughing for a few painful seconds, he resumes. "Xur ben.. uh so ah.. anyway, hey Dag, we need to go soon." He's rambling, and knows it. "Ifi'naan, we will find Gadhula for you. For now, I need to go back and rest.. can we meet again here soon?"

"Have Gadhula call the number on the screen. I'll know it's from her..." A number appears. It's Mr. Johnsons, as you should recognize...

Windwalker nods. "I'll do it. But.. we, we in turn need to know this man's secret. If he moves against us, there will be no more who hear your voices, none to help you.."

Ifi'naan confirms, already he feels less apprehension. "I will help you to the best of my power..."

Windwalker leans back in his seat, letting out a long sigh. "Thank you," he whispers. He glances across the table at his partner. "Dag.. uh, I'm probably not gonna be useful in a few minutes. We should leave, louse. Uh, now."

Dag Nabbit looks you over, "Right you are, Partner." He stands, and wraps an arm under your shoulders, holding you as you both stumble out of the resturaunt, and through the streets back home...

The signs are apparent. Windwalker pushed it jsut a little too long. Before he's gotten back to the cabal, he's already basically not moving. And IV it setup, and he is laid in bed, and given the precious drug through the drip, as many still get it every day. The mind blanks with loss and withdrawl, then, as the drug comes online, a vivid flash of color, as if awakening back into the world after a particularly dull movie.

As the hours pass, It's clear that Windwalker isn't going to come out of his time with the spirits normally. Every bed in the underground has well oiled and cared for restraints. They are just a precaution, not an insult. Still, WInwalker's limbs are tied down the the gurnee, as he thrashes the restless notsleep of the ether.

"This is the story of the Winchester Rifle Model 1873," babbles the hunter, eyes staring in different directions, pupils fully contracted. "The gun that won the West. To cowman, outlaw, peace officer or soldier, the Winchester '73 was a treasured possession. I'd sell my soul to own one. It's beautiful." Whatever's going on in his mind, it doesn't seem to have much to do with what's going on through his bloodstream.

"Fill your hands, you son of a bitch. Juice, grab it. Grab it, Juice. Stop. Grab it." He lets out a sharp yelp and tries fruitlessly to raise his left arm.

Inside, things are considerably more complex. The memories of hours upon hours of staring at a television set, droning on and on with stupid old two-dimensional films, the only release that the tortured sack of meat and neurons was permitted during his time as a test subject. He fixated on it, projected himself through it. And now as his brain goes to war with itself, galaxies of mutually incompatible existences hurl themselves at each other. Faces, memories, blurring together. His old gang, metamorphosing into the ruffians gunned down by John Wayne under a thousand different names. High society sorts making witty chatter in English drawing-room comedies while the world burns around them.

"Land of the Gods, home for their human forms, you see the same stars from their distant realm, mystic path you sail to reach their presence, one part of mortal world, Creation, the Great Song.." The shaman seems to be babbling about something else, as a new cosmos smashes into the vocal center of his brain.

As the galazies twist and turn in Windwalker's head, the view goes starkly and suddenly white. THe Hallucinations wear down, but awake doesn't come to Windwalker yet. Through the haze, both visual, and mental, Wolf ha come to speak. "You seem troubled, my child." he says, appearning in your vision.

"Troubled?" Windwalker finds himself giggling. Whether aloud or inside, he's not sure. "I've got a spirit to find. I think I may be dying. I ah.. things have been busy." He lets this float into the silence for a moment, feels uncomfortable, musters something from what's left of his brain. "How are you?"

Wolf speaks, "It is not your turn to depart your veil of tears yet, my child." Wolf looks the kin over, "I suspect you will be alright. Or, at least as much so as you have been." WOlf smiles, "My trials probably seem petty to you. Besides, with so few spirittalkers left, there is really little to report."

Windwalker feels like his mouth must be dry. Or something else is happening to him. "Galahad," he gasps out. No, he's wrong. The right name stabs him through the left lobe of his brain. "Gadhula! A spirit. Fire, celebration, pomp and circumstance. Uh, we're looking for her."

Wolf ponders, "A fire spirit, Windwalker?" He looks at you, "They can be tricky. And often need a close focus." Wolf muses, "This one you will find by the lake, where the metal skybirls once landed on the water."

Windwalker starts awake as he gains this last revelation, wrists clutching tight against the restraints. Dag Nabbit and FamousDave are on duty at this our, and both rush over, and look down. Neither speaking.

Windwalker gasps and blinks. He tries to swallow, finds that he's run out of spit, tries to explain that he needs a fresh pack installed from the store, and manages to gurgle.
