It's been a bit of a slow time for Bash recently. The poor guy has tried on several occasions to find work, and even after contact is made, the Johns seem to never show up for meetings. Back at his old hangout, The Happy Ending, Bash is mingling, making himself known. Already having made a slight name for himself, Bash no longer really puts himself out there. If you want his line of work, you come and see him.

The bartender nods to Bash as makes a pass near the bar, "Ur friend there bough' you a drink." The bartender smiles as she slides a glass over in front of Bash. The indicated gentleman looks a bit out of place here, if anyone can look out of place at The Happy Ending. Dressed in a black business suit with a red tie and a black trilby, the pale face regards you, impassively. He's sitting at a booth across the bar, as secluded as it gets from the hustle of the place.

Bash lifts the drink up in a salute to the well dressed patron. Turning back to the bartender, he asks the most obvious question. "Have you seen him in here before? Looks like someone who should be hustling in the El. This is a little low class for the likes of him." He looks into the golden liquid for a moment before downing the whole thing in a gulp. Wincing at the burn of the alcohol, he glances back at the man in the red tie.

The gentleman in the red tie simply nods, and seems to be waiting for you. The bartender shrugs, "I don't have much account of comings and goings 'round here. It so busy my mind sometimes slips." He looks at the bar, and you can tell he wants some sort of bribe for the info. Nothing's free down here.

Bash fishes in his pocket for bills, and comes out with a 10. He leans over the bar a bit as he slides the paper along with the empty glass towards the androgynous bartender. "Can I refresh your memory, friend? Man with a tie like that tends to stick out."

The bartender laughs, "You're right, you're right. He doesn't come around much. I've seen him in here a few times. Usually with folk such as yourself, if you take my meaning." He mutters, "Lousy tipper, too. Just drinks water. Good for nothin'"

Bash says, "Ah. So he is a John. Thanks." Bash slides off is chair and makes his way to the man with the red tie. He runs a hand through his dark blonde hair in an attempt to look less like he just rolled out of bed. He's sure that the old green sweater with a hole near the shoulder adds to his respectability even less than the worn brown duster he wears over it. Giving a shrug to his own efforts, Bash pushes his thin wire glasses up his nose and stops at the man's table. "Hello. My thanks for the drink. You here on business? Name's Bash. I work in aquisitions. May I?" He motions to the seat opposite the man.

The name nods, "Of course, Mr. Culver. Or shall we say 'Bash'.. Hmm?" His lips crack into the only show of emotion you've seen from the man yet, a reluctant grin. "You will find, I know much of you already. Business is, of course, all I do." He looks at you as you move into the seat. "I find myself in need..." He looks at you.

Bash says, "I hope that I can provide services." Bash pulls out a pack of cigarettes and lights one up. After taking a drag, he waves the smoke away and rests his hands on the table. "What exactly is it you are in need of, Mr... What are you calling yourself today?"

"We are always Mr. Johnson. Of course. " He raises an eyebrow, "You are interested? Good, good." He pushes a packet of papers across the table in Bash's general direction, "A company called Chicago Aerosol has been doing some research I'm interested in. Perhaps you can find something out for me. Papers, notes... Whatever."

Bash pulls the papers out of the packet and scans through them. "What level are they on? High El? What department of research is this?" He frowns as he reads, adding the pieces and trying to see where they fit.

Johnson pushes his hand against the envelope, "I need... formal acceptance first." He pauses, "Bash." He looks, "Physical access can be found at most levels. Their address will be on High El, much like most businesses." He smiles, "But the building transcends many levels, I think you will find." He smiles, "The details are in the file. Suffice to say that this isn't something you would find them advertising."

Bash reluctantly takes his hands off the packet and looks at Mr. Johnson calculatingly for a moment. "What's the fee?" He reaches for another cigarette but waits to light it. His face is completely emotionless. Money is an important matter.

Johnson. "Up to 3,000. 500 up front. The rest depending on the quality of what you can liberate." This would be a fairly average rate for a higher risk run.

Bash nods, and lights his cigarette. He turns the pack toward the other man, and finally smiles widely. "Deal. Smoke? You have the 500 with you now?"

Johnson shakes his head, "Nope. Filthy habit." He gives another sadistic smile. "You can check your balance. It has been transferred." He lifts his hand off the packet. "Instructions for delivery are in there." He points to the packet, and moves to get up.

Bash stuffs the packet into his jacket and nods. "Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Get home safe, now, so I can paid for finishing this job." He gives the man with the red tie a grin.

Johnson walks away, giving no response to your quip.

Bash peers around the bar. There are only couple handfuls of people hanging around at this time. None of them meet his eyes. He pulls the packet back out and glances through the packet to see how high the risk is and if he needs to hire backup.
