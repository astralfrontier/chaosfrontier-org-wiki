Bash is left with instructions. La Fremona is a restaurant on High El. There he is to meet the same Mr. Johnson that met him earlier at the cafe. He's there to pick up ... someone. Windwalker was somewhat vague at this last point. A cell phone is given. "I'm Here" will appear on the screen. Right now there is a countdown clock on the screen. 14 minutes and 23 seconds. This is the time until Johnson arrives. Bash will have half an hour after that to find Johnson, and receive the payload.

Bash ponders how long it will take to get up there.

Bash decides to drive to La Fremona quickly, but not like a maniac so as to avoid undue attention. After dropping Windwalker off, he walks around to his trunk. He strips his worn sweater off, and slips on a less worn dress jacket. After a moment, he decides to put on a tie, too, just in case the restaurant has a dress policy. He gets back into the car and heads out.

On your home turf, you remember a less used switchback to get up to High El, and manage to cut a few minutes off of your time. The timer goes off as you are ticking through the 'Customs Booth' between Low El and High El. The display on the phone remains blank after this. Bash manages his way to the restaurant, and parks. There is a small croud outside, and an younger man in a wool tux is standing at the podium.

Bash walks up to the podium with purpose. He even forces himself to grin pleasantly. "Hi. Looks like a busy night. Do you, uh, have a moment?"

The concierge regards you passively. As if he didn't hear your request, "Do you have a reservation?"

Bash leans close, so he can speak quietly to the man. "Look, I'm in a bit of a situation here. I'm meeting someone inside, but I don't even know his name. We, uh...set up a blind date through one of those messaging sites. It's really embarassing! If I tell you what he looks like, could you point me to his table?" Bash winces as he says this, hoping to pull off embarassment. He's actually trying not to laugh. He pulls out $20 and offers it under his hand as he leans on the podium trying his best to look expectant and goofily excited by a blind date...with a dude. Heh.

The concierge looks at you. His expression is unchanging. "Sir." He begins, "No one has informed the establishment that they are expecting company." He looks down at your bill, and takes it in his hand, "You might be able to find an open spot at the bar, if you wish to enjoy some refreshments." He nods you over to the bar, then looks over your shoulder, persumably at the next customer.

Bash sighs and walks over to the bar. He finds an open spot and scans the patrons while he waits for service.

Your trained eye manages to locate someone who you know to be Johnson, remembering the red thread running through his hat. The bartender, a younger woman with a hurried look and her blonde hair pulled up behind her head, "Drink, hon?" She asks, oblivious to your scanning the restaurant.

Bash smiles at the bartender. "Gin and tonic, if you would." He digs through his pocket for more cash.

The 'tender slaps the order into the console in front of you. An arm, specially retrofitted into the oldfashioned looking bar setup, whirrs around on a track. A cup is lifted into place, and a fizzy clear liquid is pour into already present ice cubes. By the time the drink is full, the bartender is already off to punch in for someone else.

Bash leaves more bills on the bar, and slowly makes his way around the room to the area Johnson is. He stops occasionally to sip at his drink and look like he is trying to locate his party.

As you make your way over to the booth where Mr. Johnson is sitting, the party abruptly gets up to leave, and you are standing between them and the exit. It occurs to you that being seen by Johnson is probably going to raise some uncomfortable questions.

Bash curses under his breath. He quickly glances for a place to hide. Barring that, he decides to make toward the exit quickly.

You manage to turn away as they pass by. If they notice you, they sure don't seem to give a sign. The cellphone in your pocket vibrates as you turn and they walk away. The screen reads 'I'm Here'.

Bash checks the screen. He finishes the rest of his drink to give Johnson time to really be gone. Bash sets the glass down and casually walks out.

Twice now, Windwalker has been called on to infiltrate the Chicago Aerosol building. He finds the second visit's technique far more to his liking. Between his rudimentary control over shadow and his fairly skilled mastery of air, he slips into the building using the old movie cliche: the ventilation duct.

Hanna's presence doesn't seem to be around as Windwalker makes his way through the filtration system. Having your body cleansed of particular matter by passing through a screen is such an interesting experience. The wind spirit joins Windwalker shortly after his arrival, however.

Windwalker, with Hanna's help, locates the HR room where a couple of spare badges can pretty easily be picked up. Pushes effortlessly through the venelation system, Windwalker and Hanna enter the office, unoccupied.

Windwalker solidifies, and seizes a couple of passes that look likely, at least from the same floor. These are dropped into an envelope, and addressed out to a drop box that The Lodge uses for such things.

After this simple task, it is a short jaunt back through the vents, and back out onto the streets, as if nothing happened at all.

Windwalker meets up again with Bash after retrieving the badges, and presents them for inspection. "These two phones should let you get what you need from the computers in a more secure area, with us safe in a less secure one," he explains. "If things go south, we can run for it and get them back later."

He gestures with the badges. "And these are if _we_ get discovered."

Bash peers at the phones. "So they're jacked into the computers inside? How the hell did you manage that?"

Windwalker shakes his head. "They aren't, not yet. But I can take care of that, with your help, once we're in."

Bash says, "What does that mean? You want me to use those as a deck?"

Windwalker shrugs a little. "You'd plug your deck into another computer, right? You just plug it into the phone instead. The other phone gets plugged into that other computer. If I understand this correctly." He peers at the phones. "Guys. Was that right?"

Ifi'naan's voice emits from the speaker, for Windwalker's ears only. "Yes, that should be right." The spirit's voice wavers, "The closer together we can be, the better. Less likely to be blocked."

Bash runs a hand through his hair. "Ok. What entrance are we going to use?"
