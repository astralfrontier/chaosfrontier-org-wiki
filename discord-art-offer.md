<!-- TITLE: Discord Art Offer -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Discord Art Offer -->

# The offer
I'm offering to pay for character art for people in the games I'm in: **Midnight Saviors** and **Sycamour Division**. I'm doing this to support artists who need money. I know people that I want to support, but if you know someone else who could use the money, _let me know!_

If this is interesting to you, do the following:

1. Contact an artist from the list below on Discord.
2. Let them know you were referred by Discord user `astralfrontier#2235`. The artist should reach out to me for payment.
3. Work with the artist on your character portrait idea, until you're both happy!
