The sedan has sputtered to life under the touch of low-tech lockpicking and high-tech hotwiring. An unlikely trio breathes the night air as they ponder their next move..

Garfield hics. "So, where the hell we goin' anyway?"

Garfield takes another gulp from his precious bottle. "I mean, we got an entire bar right there, an' no one t'enforce last call or nothin'"

Edward drums his fingers on the dash, looking over the deserted street. _Damnit, I left my keys to the radio station at home..._ "Drive around until we see someone? Maybe they're going through the same thing we are."

Drake snorts. "Far as I'm concerned, we're getting the hell out of town. You want to pick anything up from your home, speak up now, cause I'm not turning around afterwards."

Garfield mutters to himself. "See somone one? The whole world's vanished and he thinks he's gonna see someone. Guess I ain't dreamin' this -- not even my dreams are _that_ dumb... An' outta town? Right... let's get stranded somewhere outta gas." He speaks up, saying "How 'bout a police station? If there's anyone around it'd be there."

Edward sighs, pushing his glasses up on his nose. "I'm fine. Let's simply find someone." _I can hitch a ride back to the apartment if anyone shows up. I have money, keys..._ "Or carry whatever it is that wiped the town out with us. If it is a virus, then we're likely carriers, for some reason."

Garfield says, "An' this virus would cause corpses to vanish into thin air, eh? Didn't take a lotta school, but that's gotta be 'gainst physics or somethin'."

Edward says, "According to Garret over here," He thumbs to Drake, "There were some bodies in the ward we were in."

Drake actually turns around in his seat. "Look around, man. You see any black and whites? You hear any sirens? If there were any cops around, we'd have seen some sign of them." He looks at Edward then. "If this is a virus...and I don't know if it is, any more...what difference does it make? On the other hand, if some asshole in Washington is planning on nuking the city, I want my fair shot at trying to get away. And to be honest, I'm surprised I'm hanging around with you two clowns at all. I'm not going on a scavenger hunt. Now, if you got a home, kid, speak up, otherwise we're going to my hotel, I'm grabbing my stuff, and we're taking the interstate."

Drake rolls his eyes. "My name's Drake, not Garret."

Drake says, "I'd ask what your name was if I cared."

Garfield says, "ou think an evacuation would be this clean? We didn't spent _that_ long in the ward. We woulda heard something, an' cars would be piled six deep on any road leadin' outta town."

Drake taps the steering wheel. "Look, I'm not trying to explain this shit, old man. But I'm also not going to stick around here with my thumb up my ass arguing about it! I'm going to save my own skin. Now are you in, or out?"

Edward's eyes narrow at Drake. "Right." He gives his address. "You can dump me there. This isn't a joy ride, and I don't intend to spend it with you or the failing liver back there." _For all I know, I could end up as a body outside of town, with this sociopath._

_Drake arches a brow. _Okay, so the kid's got a spine._ "Okay. Your call, man." He puts the car in gear. "You're going to have to tell me how to get there. I'm not exactly a taxi driver."_

_Garfield says, "Nothin' wrong with my liver -- It's jus' a stressfull night. An' I got my own car, thank you. Drop me home and we can be rid of each other." He laughs shortly. "So we can all vanish separately, most like..."_

_Edward points. "Back towards the hospital. Down this road here," He gestures, "Then head left at the red light. Keep on going straight, then turn a right at a stop sign. It's just off the campus."_

_Drake chuckles. "This is sounding better all the time..."_

_Garfield says, "I'm 'cross town. I'd catch a bus, but..." He shrugs ironically._

_The little car and its three isolated occupants spends a few minutes crawling through the streets and byways and finally starts to chug its way up the hill. Past the parking garage; past the theoretically-occupied checkstation wherein nobody stands guard; past buildings and statues and sidewalks; and towards the dorms. Finally the auto chugs to a stubborn stop. And illuminated in its headlights, a figure in what seems to be hospital garb can be seen staggering in the distance - wandering aimlessly, like a lost child, in this most silent of nights._

_Drake blinks. "What the fuck?" he says eloquently._

_Edward stares out the windshield. "I'll second that."_

_Garfield says, "Hey, hey stop! We gotta see if this guy's all right! Don' run him over, fer Chris' sake!"_

_Drake taps the wheel. "No, I suppose not. Might crack the windshield."_

_Drake tries to start the car again, pumping the gas to choke the engine._

_With a rasping cough, the engine gives way and remains sullenly silent._

_Drake says, "That's assuming we can get the car to start again."_

_Drake says, "Which, it appears not. Great. Now we'll have to boost another car."_

_And meanwhile, the figure in the far distance seems to have taken note of the car and its occupants. It begins shambling, staggering like a drunk, toward the vehicle._

_Edward swears under his breath. "Well, I'll see if they're fine; I have some first aid classes under my belt." A look around, "We're close enough to my place. If this car starts, go ahead and leave me." He opens the door, and walks towards the figure. "Hey!"_

_Edward's eyes catch the light streaming away from the dying automobile and reflecting off the distant figure, and as he draws closer, disturbing details make themselves known. The bus wreck - it must have been horrible. And in those half-glimpsed, fading memories that only now begin to burrow into Edward's conscious mind, the bodies of the slain passengers figure prominently. Slashed, shredded, bruised, bleeding, burnt; the marks of a horrid death are stamped indelibly on every face he envisions. And why should this memory come now? Association, for the death-haunted mask of a corpse is what Edward now stares at. The figure is decaying, damaged; blotches of skin are missing or discolored, and the skin is shrunken inward._

_Garfield gets out too. He pauses at the open door, then after a measured glance at the driver, grabs his bottle and bat. "Don' want the punk drivin' off with you, now do we?," he mutters. He moves after the kid, more than a little weave in his walk._

_Edward stands there, and stares, confused, a little curious, and a whole lot of terrified. Lips move to form some sort of word, something that just won't come to him... and he begins to run. The grad student can _run_ too. "Get in the Car!" He thunders, every bit of panic transforming into the demand in his voice. "Get the **fuck** in the car, and GET IT STARTED!"_

_Drake sighs. The car itself seems to be unresponsive. He squints out at the others, considering just ditching them. he can't hotwire a car himself...but then again, maybe he can find a dealership and grab the kets._

_Drake huhs. "What are you blaring about, kid?"_

_Garfield says, "Eh? Wha's wrong?"_

_Edward isn't answering. Oooh no. He's simply pealing to the car, before throwing open the back door and leaping inside. "Start the car." There's no panic, nothing high strung. It's a command. Eyes are stuck peering through the windshield._

_Garfield turns around as the student flys by him. "Where you go--" he starts, but the car door slamming answers that._

_Drake arches a brow. "Yes sir." he says mockingly, not really caring. He turns the key, wholely expecting to fail._

_The engine remains stubbornly still. The shambling figure in the distance grows closer, arms outstretched in a grasping gesture._

_Drake smirks. "See? Now, you want to explain why mister Hospital Gown is im personating Frankenstein?"_

_Turning again, Garfield take a few more step towards the figure. "Hey, you all right?" he calls. He squints -- the headlights must be plaing hell with his nightvision. The figure can't really look like what he thinks it does..._

_Edward's eyes grow like saucers. "I don't konw what it was, I don't want to know. You want to see? Get up and go see for yourself. You can stay here and play. I'm leaving." He moves to get out. Pushing the door open briskly, he leaps out._

_Drake chews on the inside of his cheek, and gets out of the car, moving over by the stock still bus driver curiously. And blinks at what he sees._

_The figure takes notice of Garfield, and has begun loping toward him. Midstride, a finger wobbles and dislodges itself from the thing's outstretched hand. It falls to the asphalt; the figure continues its ever-increasing stride._

_Garfield takes a swig and unconsciously grips the baseball bat tighter. "I'm not really seein' that, am I?" he asks Drake._

_Edward is, at this point, looking franticly for a new car._

_Garfield says, "He sees me? Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap..."_

_Drake doesn't answer for a moment. Then he reaches under his jacket and pulls out his Glock. "If so, then you're not seeing this either." _Fuck. Double fuck. Okay...what was that movie saying...sever the back, or shoot them in the head...okay, I can do that._ He takes careful aim..._

_Garfield looks from Drake's gun to the figure and back. He starts moving slowly away from both._

_Edward rushes over to one, taking off his jacket to roll it over his hand. Then he punches the window out of a car door. "OW!" It's going to hurt worse if that thing catches him... He wipes the glass out of the way, before fumbling for the release mechanism in the car's door._

_The sound of Edward's impromptu car-rental is nothing next to the report from whatever weapon Drake had with him and in the aftermath of the shot, the dead thing crumples over as its head dissipates into vapor. It slumps to the street, shivers once, and lays still._

_Edward jumps as the gun goes off. He tears the door open, and dives beneath the steering wheel. "Come on, come on..." His fingers search for the wires._

_A mixture of blood, slime and grue covers the asphalt behind the downed figure._

_Drake keeps the gun in his hand. "That was close. Hmm." He edges up to the fallen thing, trying to get a better look at it, without getting close to it's arms or mouth...what's left of it._

_The charnel stench of death rises up, assaulting Drake's nose immediately._

_Garfield says, "You shot him! I can't believe you shot him!" He takes a long pull, then ventures closer the corpse._

_Drake rolls his eyes. "I'm sorry, did you feel like being food today?"_

_Garfield says, "Food?! You shot a person, damn it! What kind of person are you?"_

_Drake eyes the dead thing...and he does someone he'd never done before when faced with a dead body. He bends over and pukes. Not much to puke, however, considering he hasn't had dinner._

_Drake wipes his mouth with the back of his sleeve after a moment. "ahgo...it's not a person, you moron...it's sone dead...zombie...thing."_

_Garfield nears the two figures, kneeling beside the dead one in horror._

_The odor of rot and corruption touches Garfield's nostrils as well - not as strongly, but perhaps more insidiously. Something in his mind stirs, a memory or a recollection perhaps. Something during the accident... being boxed into a slowly-crushing coffin of metal with a dozen corpses pressing close.._

_Seemingly far away, the sound of Edward's hot-wiring work can be heard revving to life..._

_Drake takes a deep, shuddering breath. "Fuck. Well, that was fun. Now we know why there are no corpses around. They're ambulatory. Now, if only we could get that hot Jojovich babe to show up..."_

_Garfield stumbles back, falling on his ass. The bat rolls away. Shaking his head dumbly, he raises the bottle once more. "No... No, please... "_

_Edward lets loose a cry of triump! "Yes!" He sits up in the seat, turning the headlights on. "It works! Sweet Jesus it works!"_

_Drake turns at the sound. "hey, whaddya know. Kid came through." He starts walking towards the car._

_The two men are not the only beings whose attention the engine caught. In the distance, four more figures can dimly be seen, still illumined in the sedan's flickering headlights. They, too, are approaching curiously and cautiously._

_Garfield starts at the sound of the car. "Get away... gotta....", he mumbles. Grabbing the bat and hugging it like he had been the bottle not so long ago, he stumbles to the new car._

_The figures stagger and stumble with the same clumsiness the downed cadaver exhibited._

_Edward sticks his head out the window, and nearly slices his cheek open on some busted glass. "You two better move your ass, or you can stay and play with the body!" He revs the engine, before putting it into gear. "C'mon..."_

_Garfield tries the back door, fumbling at the handle. "Open, open damn it!"_

_Drake moves around and grabs the shotgun passenger seat. "Kid, I aint going to argue with you." he mutters as he slides in, shutting the door._

_Edward flicks the switch, unlocking the door. "Get in, old man! We need to **move**!"_

_Garfield says, "Thanks... thank you." He opens the door and clambers in._

_Edward steps on the gas, not even waiting for Garfield to get fully in. "Shut the door," He snaps, while twisting the wheel to keep from ramming into the car in front of him. And promptly steps on the gas._

_Carefully, Garfield fishes the bottle's cap and screws it back on before laying it gently on the floor. "Later," he whispers. "I'll have more later."_

_Drake looks at the others. "Okay. Either of you know where the nearest pawn shop is? Or some place I can get some firepower?"_

_Garfield says, "Pawn shop? Uh, sure there's one... uh...."_

_The four figures seem aware of the new car and its occupants, and they too break into a halting gait as they try to run towards it._

_In the rear-view mirror, the persistent but apparently mindless things disappear into the night._

_Garfield says, "Sorry... can't remember...."_

_Drake groans. "Okay, fuck it. How about the nearest police station? There's probably loads of shit there..."_

_Edward turns around a corner at full clip. "No idea; keep your eyes open for a phone booth; we can steal a book and look for one." After a second, "Okay, what the Fuck just happened?"_

_"What happened is we just found out what happened to these folks before...something turned them into zombies. And if we're gonig to fight our way out of a city full of zombies, we need guns. Lots and lots of guns." Drake mutters._

_Drake says, "So, lets find a police station and raid the SWAT team locker."_

_Edward snorts. "No, if we're going to 'fight our way' out of a city full of zombies, we get a god damn mac truck and plow them down if they get in our way." He looks over briefly at Drake, before back at the road. "I know one thing, atleast."_

_Garfield offers, "Or a bus... And I do know where all the keys are."_

_Edward says, "No offense, but I think I've had my fill of busses for the day."_

_Drake glances at Edward. "And that is?"_

_"We're not in a video game." Edward gives a slight grin. "No chick with a tight shirt on, yet."_

_Garfield says, "That wasn't my fault! It was the goddammed crane!"_

_Drake actually smiles. "Yeah, that's a shame."_

_Edward spots a phonebooth, and pulls up by it. Since Drake has the gun, with some persuasion, he's the one who retrieves the phonebook (with a firm yanking of the attaching chain). The address of a local pawnshop is found. Eighth street._

_A little more travel - twists and turns in the road, dark and foreboding in the solitude of night - and the vehicle pulls up in front of CASH N DASH. The store is deserted, as is becoming the expected norm - but the caged windows and doors present an additional obstacle to the would-be intruder._

_Garfield says, "Cash 'n Dash? Must be new..."_

_Drake sides out of the car. "Hmmph. Must have been expecting me. No matter." He takes out his lockpicks, and sets on getting egress..._

_Edward calls out, "That'll take too long! There has to be a back door. Shoot it open, or kick it, or whatever."_

_Drake shakes his head. "Pawnshops are usually better equipped against an easy break in, kid. Now, let me concentrate..."_

_A few moments suffice to secure entry from the door lock. More effort is required in the deadbolt; fortunately, an investment in Medeco locks was not made in this store's case. Within the gloomy recesses of the darkened pawn shop, the shapes of a thousand hocked items - and other things, perhaps - loom in silhouette._

_Drake looks around for a light switch, so he can better browse. But he keeps his gun pointed._

_The snap of a switch on the wall heralds a low humming sound, and in a few seconds fully a third of the overhead lights protestingly come to life. The rest remain stubbornly dormant. Even those that have lit up do so faultily, flickering or dimming unaccountably._

_In the light, the head of a stag can be seen mounted on the wall, surrounded by fishing poles and other goods. It's acting as a gun rack, in a fit of dark irony. The shop seems conventional enough. Firearms and hunting supplies compete with cheap, no-name electronics for shelf space, and in glass counters the sparkle of gems and jewels of questionable authenticity catch the eye._

_Even in the flickering light, Garfield spots something of critcal importance -- new (or at least replacement) hip flasks. He heads over to browse._

_Edward waits impatiently in the car, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel. Every three seconds he'll look into a rear view mirror, or out the side. _He had to take the gun, too, didn't he...__

_Drake starts grabbing guns, focusing primarily on shotguns, and requisite ammo._

_Garfield reappears from the depths of the shop, carrying his prizes. He hunkers down by the open door and carefully fills his new friends from the remains of his old friend, the bottle._

_The sound of shuffling footsteps can be heard echoing through the pawn shop._

_Garfield says, "I s'pose if he fires one of his new toys, it means he's in trouble in there."_

_Edward pushes up his glasses. "Well, let's hope he gets something practicle. Like a chainsaw."_

_At the sound of Garfield's voice, the shuffling sound ceases abruptly._

_Drake isn't afraid. Not...precisely. But he's not stupid to fight these things close quarters. "Time to go." He hustles outside with his booty, tossing most of it in the back, but taking one pump action and a box of shells for himself, and starts feeding shells into the gun as he hops in the front seat._

_Garfield tucks the flasks into various pockets, and then turns back to the pawn shop, peering carefully inside._

_Edward tips his head back at Gar. "Y'know, if we find a liqour store, what you don't use we can make some moltoves out of."_

_Drake calls out the window. "Move, man! We're not the Marines, but we are leaving!"_

_The persistent stare of the bus driver, albeit through a giddy sheen imparted by his drink of choice, goes unrewarded. Nothing in the pawn shop is apparently out of place._

_"Waste o' good alcohol, if you ask me," Garfield replies distractedly. "And I don't feel like fryin' tonight anyway if one slips._

_Garfield calls, "Any... anyone else in there?"_

_Drake jacks a round into the chamber. "Now, I feel ready." he rolls his eyes. "Are you going to wait around to find out? Just, lets go!"_

_The silence of the night is his only answer._

_Garfield says, "Guess it was nothin'." He climbs only slightly hurriedly back into the vehicle._

_Drake looks at Edward. "Right. What was your name, anyway?"_

_Garfield says, "Call him 'kid'. Easier to remember."_

_Edward hits the gas, as soon as Gar is in the car. "Edward," He says as he turns around a street. "That reminds me; I know, there has to be some reason why these corpses just jumped up and started playing a rendition of a Clive Barker film. But, all we have is pop culture to go off of, so that means that whatever did this, it likely can infect us. So, if anyone gets bitten, they get left behind. There is **always** some lout who gets bit and then turns and attacks everyone. Forget that; wasting a bullet. You get bit, you get left."_

_Drake gives Gar a dead eyed stare. "By that logic, I should call you 'fat ass'. Or maybe just 'drunk'."_

_Garfield says, "And you're 'Mista Gansta' or some shit. Yeah, yeah." His voice is a (really) bad imitation._

_Drake eyes Edward with surprising respect. "Okay, so you're a practical somebitch. I like that. So, Ed, you called our next stop. Know any place in this city where we can pick up the automotive equivalent of a tank?"_

_Drake ignores Gar for now._

_Garfield says, "Bus depot. An' I'm a damn good driver, too. And you keep your mouth shut--it wasn't my fault!"_

_Edward grins like a shark for a second. "Just like ol' drinkie back there encourages, a bus'll do. I'd prefer a mac truck. Then again, if we get a bus, we need to decide who's driving, because he's in no shap to get behind the wheel."_

_Garfield holds out a surprisingly steady hand. "You think I'm not used to this? This is nothin'"_

_Garfield says, "Public!!"_

_Drake looks at Gar. "You'll forgive us if we're not completely trusting." To Edward, he says, " I can't drive a bus, myself. Not exactly my wheels of choice. Can you?"_

_Garfield says, "There's a special course an' everything. It ain't a car, kid."_

_Edward swirves to keep from ramming into a light post. "I'm no stunt man myself. Looks like we've got him. Either way, he's driving a **Bus**. Just as long as we steer him away from buildings... Where's the bus depot?"_

_Drake sighs. _Great. Now he's calling me 'kid'._ "My name is Drake. You call me kid again, fat ass, I'm going to shove an umbrella up your ass and open it."_

_Edward glances sidways at him. "I think that'd constitute bad luck."_

_Garfield says, "Anytime you care to drop the piece, feel free to try." He turns to Edward, pointedly ignoring Drake. "The depot? That's easy..." And gives him almost eloquent directions._

_The 'corral' - more formally the bus storage for TriMet - isn't too far away. Loaded with weapons and doubts, the group of chance-met strangers continue their uncertain course through its empty halls, past the silent vigil of security cameras behind which no human being must sit - for who would let such a motley trio, especially armed, walk freely through the complex? The busses sit in state, lined up like horses in a stable and quiescent in the darkness. Only the memories of two men, one almost devoid of content, the other all too willingly forgotten, have any idea of the potential power these behemoths conceal._

_Garfield says, "Right. The keys are kept over this way...." And heads off._

_Drake has taken the time to load more handguns and shotguns. He's got a .357 S+W with his Glock, and is carrying a 7-round pump action shotgun. He hands another to Edward. "Try not to hit me, Ed. Harder to miss with one of these things...but that's not good if you're pointing in the wrong direction. Like at one of us."_

_Edward nods his head, and holds the gun. Just because he knows little more about this thing then pointing the firing end at something and shoot, he still feels comfortable with it. "Good."_

_Drake waits, sitting on the hood of the car. "So, Ed...what did you do, before you got stuck in a city full of zombies?"_

_Edward pushes up his glasses. "Student. Y'know, if I had my keys, I would've suggested we swing by the radio station and see if we can get any sound on there, get a little herd of people. And if I had the patience and safety, I'd want to get one of those zombies, strap it down, and examine it. There's something going on here, and I want to know."_

_Elsewhere, the key cabinet stands against the wall in some manager's office and its plastic not too surpisingly isn't proof against Garfield's metal bat. "Not my first choice of what to smash 'round here," he says to himself, "but it'll do. It'll do..."_

_Drake nods thoughtfully. "Assuming there is anyone else. There is safety in numbers, yeah, but..."_

_Drake sighs. "And here I was thinking thigns couldn't get any worse than they were, for me. Silly, that."_

_Edward says, "But that's too much work and could get us in danger, yeah yeah." He taps his foot. "I hope he didn't pass out. "_

_Remembering a hazy, half-forgotten struggle to get at his bus's first aid kit, Garfield also grabs the storage room keys. "Maybe there's someone we could help...." He opens the storage room's door and heads the shelf with the spare kits. "Or we might need them ourselves... "_

_Drake taps the barrel of his gun. "Here...you go check on the man. I'm going to go outside a sec... make sure no there arent any dead people sneaking up on us."_

_Walking back to the corral, arms loaded with a bat and first aid kits, Garfield's eye is caught by the soda and snack machines. "And those'll do for second and third targets..."_

_Drake slides off the hood, and sidles towards where they came in, poking his head out._

_Edward lets loose a sigh. "C'mon... C'mon..." He begins to pace back and forth, walking to one of the busses. He taps on the door idly._

_Thump. Thump. Thump. The door resonates sullenly under his rapping knuckles._

_Garfield says, "Wish I had my duffle with me," he mutters as he walks slowly over the bus of his choice, trying (vainly) not to drop any of his booty. Realizing he needs to drop everything anyway just to get in the bus, he lets out a vehement curse. "Get over here and take this stuff, would ya?" he calls to Edward._

_Edward grumbles. He props the shotgun by the wheel of the bus, before walking over. "Well, that's smart," He announces to Garfield, looking over the first aid kits. "That is some damn good thinking." He starts taking some of the load off Garfield's hands._

_Garfield says, "Thanks. Hey, you leave the Cheezypuffs alone, y'hear?"_

_Edward says, "Fine, fine. But I call the chocolate. Now, get your keys and let's be getting."_

_Drake comes back after a moment. "We're in the clear." He starts grabbing the spare guns. "Now lets make like a tree and leave."_

_Outside the corral, night air and moonlight, banking behind clouds now and again, is all that disturbs the actions of the three fugitives from insanity._

_The bus door opens with its usual groan of protest and Garfield moves inside. "Step aboard, step aboard," he invites. "You've got your pass handy, right?" His grin is only a little short of ghastly._

_Edward eyes the driver. "I'm taking those cheezypuffs," He warns as he climbs aboard. He doesn't, but it's a suitable threat for him. He finds a good seat, feeling the pangs of exhaustion. It usually starts strangling his conciousness about now... Rrg. Hopefully some sleep will be had._

_Drake smirks. "Okay, bus driver-man. Course heading: out of here. Warp 8. Engage." he quips, sitting down and starting to feed bullets into spare clips for the automatics. _The world's gone crazy, and I feel fine. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil, cause I'm packing heat, and I'm the meanest motherfucker in the valley. Bring on the zombies.__

_Garfield seats himself and starts the engine. He sees the fuel tank is a little short of full -- lazy bastards, the mechanics. He automatically reaches for the seat belt, but its touch causes another memory to wash over him, one of the belt wrapping him, trapping him, as he dangled and sounds approached. "No," he thinks. "Not this time." And the seat belt snaps back beside the seat. He revs the engine, letting the sound drive away the memory. "All right," he calls. "Last bus to nowhere. Next stop: the hell away from here." With only a small nip from one of his new flasks, he lets the bus start carrying them onward._
