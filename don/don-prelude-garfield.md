Route 15 - the north-south line that travels along 82nd Avenue, all the way down to where it inexplicably turns into 83rd - is a decent one. Why, then, is there such an argument about who'll be assigned to it? "Construction!" roars the supervisor, deep in the bowels of the dispatching office, to the assembled drivers. "You people are afraid of a little CONSTRUCTION? Come on, I'm talking about a gravy route here! Come on, who's gonna take it?"

Garfield looks around at teh distinct lack of hands. "Any bonus pay, or are we doin' it 'cause we're nice, loyal types?"

"You're doing it because you want a job, Stuart," growls the supe. "I guess that since you spoke, you get to take it. It's simple - just speed up before you get to Burnside, slow down after that, and don't run over anybody." The remainder of the assembled drivers lets out a collective chuckle - a near miss (of a body, and after that a lawsuit against Metro) is an old but oft-remembered incident among the boys. "Your trusty steed awaits you outside." He turns, snapping at another driver. "Mike! Lazy bastard, come in late once again and you're in trouble..."

Garfield is actually a bit curious about said lack of hands. He tries to remember anything going 'round the grape vine about the construction. "Well, since you're bein' friendly enough to use my first name, **Johnny**, I'd be happy to."

The supervisor waves a dismissive hand. The rest of the drivers, meanwhile, scatter to avoid any left-over wrath, moving outside to \`mount up' and begin their scheduled runs.

Disappointed at the lack of reaction, Garfield shrugs and wanders over towards his bus.

Around halfway there, he stops and remembers he hasn't yet gotten his bottle of Coke. He veers off towards the soda machines.

Garfield thinks that if there's anyone at the machines, he'll ask what they heard about the construction. With no water bottle in sight, it's about the only place to gather to exchange gossip.

Garfield whistles as he walks -- badly.

The soda machines out front of the station face out, nestled in the shade of the afternoon Sun. Across the vast parking-lot of the transit center, a shopping center gleams in the light over a sea of greens, blues and reds of automobile hoods. Off in the distance, a man is jumping out of the passenger-side of a car, dressed nattily in suit and tie and carrying an expensive-looking briefcase. He waves jauntily to the remaining occupant of the car and blows them - her - a kiss before moving away, intent on boarding one of the purring behemoths of steel parked here. A couple of the drivers are here too, coming off-shift and refreshing themselves before the drive home.

With only a vaguely disgusted glance at the suit's antics, Garfield reaches into his pocket for some change. He listens to what the other drivers are discussing as he approaches.

".... So then she says to me, we need to talk about this, and I said -- oh hey Stu!" calls one - Joe Edmonds, a bushy-haired man in his 30's. "You look unhappy."

Garfield shrugs. "Been assigned the number 15 run."

Garfield says, "glances at the others. "You hear anythin' about the construction going on? The others seemed to want to steer clear, but I've heard nothin' abou tit.

Joe chuckles. "You know, there's something about a big yellow crane on the road that strikes fear into people. Don't worry about it, they're just wrapping up something on the overpass. I guess somebody rammed into the sidewall a day or two ago, left a nasty hole in the concrete, and they're just patching it up." The other man, Hector - his last name forgotten, for the moment - nods in agreement. "I drive home that way," he explains. "It's no big deal, just steer left and watch for oncoming traffic."

Garfield nods ageeably. "Huh. No big deal then -- thanks. You guys are gettin' off shift?" He drops quarters into the soda machine.

Collecting his bottle, Garfield just drops it into a pocket. With the others there, he'll have to wait 'til later to 'spice' it up with a bit of rum.

"Sure are," Joe grins. "So now it's either go to the bar, or go home to the missus, and either way I'm gonna pay tonight and feel like shit in the morning." He winks, waves jauntily, and turns to stroll away towards the parking lot. Hector smiles weakly, gives thumbs up and follows, veering away towards his own vehicle.

Garfield thinks whistfully that he only has to go through eight-odd hours of crap before he can do likewise. Forgetting about the virgin Coke, he heads to his bus.

The calmly-rumbling sound of the engine greets the distracted driver, and a few moments suffice to crack open the door and clamber inside. Everything is where it should be - a quick inspection serves as a safety checklist. Good. A few passengers edge toward the bus, uncertain as always in the absence of clear instruction whether or not they are yet welcome aboard.

Garfield avoids scowling at the gathering masses, glancing instead at the watch on his wrist. A few minutes are left before he has to leave -- the nice thing to do would be to let them on rather than make them stand outside, but... Crap, they're customers. He **has** to do the nice thing. Hoping his face doesn't crack from the strain, he puts on a smile, sits himself and waves grandly to let his passengers know that they are truly welcome. Sort of.

The invitation is well-heeded and the half-dozen people milling confusedly about on the sidewalk begin to file in. One by one they feed their crisp, crinkled or crumpled dollar bills into the machine, or offer the floppy ink-smudge that serves Metro as a day-long pass. A few more busses pull into the corral after a few minutes, the stragglers in the afternoon changeover - their passengers are eager to get moving, and their drivers are likewise prepared to call it a day. The trickle of humanity boarding Route 15 continues almost to the zero hour, until half the bus is crowded with the press of people.

Tick, tick, ding. Time's up. Resignedly, Garfield pulls the seat belt across his body and clicks it home, while kicking his duffle bag a bit further under the seat. He revs the engine a bit, and with a final glance in the passenger mirror, thumbs th

the button to shut the door.

And with that final gesture, the bus swings out of the pen and begins - slowly but surely - to swing round the concrete islands of the parking lot. As it merges with traffic, the reticent throng of people in the back seem to sit a little more comfortably - for them the journey has begun, and will be ending soon. For the driver, on the other hand, this is nothing more than one more in an infinite series of loops. In twos or threes, a handful of quiet conversations begin to spring up.

"No destination, no destination." The words are like a chant in Garfield's mind as the road hum and the passengers' buzz and the flashing traffic merge into the quiet cacophony that is his job.

He uses only half an ear to listen for the 'bing!' of the stop requests and half an eye to watch to boarders waiting on the curbs, but it suffices. It suffices.

A few stops here, a few stops there. Two girls get out, chatting gaily and apparently intent on doing some shopping. They're replaced by a sullen youth whose eyes are glued to their retreating backs (or maybe further down), and who surrenders his George Washington with a sneer. Further down the road, a white-haired woman comes aboard as well, intent on making small-talk with the driver whether it's listened to or not. Her smile, at least, is warm and genuine.

\-- and it's with but a small twinge that the expression Garfield returns is nothing more than a mechanical imitation.

After so long, it's really all that it can be.

Garfield barely registers that even the Coke he sips at the traffic lights is only ordinary Coke. The passing buildings, though, suddenly remind him of exactly where he is -- approaching the dreaded yellow crane. He chuckles to himself at the thought.

Inside the cab of the construction vehicle, a silvery hip flask not unlike Garfield's own is the subject of much attention. The man operating the apparatus with one hand takes a final swig, peering up into the emptied container and operating the machinery with the other.

Garfield eyes the crane. "Oh, my!" he thinks sarcastically. "How big and strong it is!"

Garfield realizes suddenly why his mouth tastes strange. "Bloody hell!" he thinks. "This is going to be a long shift...."

Strong, indeed, is the 'claw' that clings to the pile of rebar and scattered chunks of concrete the crane was assigned to clean up. A few of the passengers are drawn to look out the left. They have scant seconds to appreciate, then wonder, then fear, the immediacy of that horrid claw as it swings toward the bus in a deadly arc.

Garfield's eyes open as wide as they've been this evening as he stares at the claw. "You've gotta be shittin' me!" He yanks furiously on the wheel....

Below, the rapid passage of a MAX train - the light rail system that services Portland, an adjunct to the bus system - does not hinder its passengers from looking up in shock. The bus, smashed right at the left front wheel, careens right - through the very gap the crane and construction equipment was meant to fix. A space of time - free flight, or free fall in this case - and the world turns, revolves, spins and transforms. A peculiar empty sensation sweeps through the bodies of those in the bus, and those in the last train stare up in abject horror as the weight of the vehicle shears through the power-cables that supply MAX with its power. The bus, in its entirety, slams home against the roof of the train.

Garfield wonders vaguely what the woman is doing now....

There's a deafening crash and the world explodes in a riot of sound and color. A sudden hot rush of sensation engulfs Garfield, an unfamiliar feeling, and the screams of his passengers contribute to a growing sense of surreality. There's a shudder throughout the bus as it falls roughly to the ground, smashed and ruined by its passage over the bridge and its rough landing atop the now-damaged MAX train that's screeching to a halt. It lands sideways on the tracks. In the back, the soft sounds of crying are punctuated by a scream.

Garfield blinks slowly and tries to command his arms and fingers to release his seat belt.

Everything is shaky, and the whimpering sounds from in back of the bus grow more quiet. In fact, everything seems to be growing lighter, paler, quieter. Shock, concussion, whatever it might be... but the feeling of floating calm pervades. From somewhere, a shuffling sound of feet can be heard.
