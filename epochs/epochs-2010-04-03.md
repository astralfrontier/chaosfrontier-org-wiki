In the world, there are many ages. The heroes of one epoch ascend to become the gods of the next, and the world changes. This time of the world is marked by flame and frost. Perpetual winter shrouds much of the surface. Old forests, once lush with green, lie trapped in crystalline limbo. Here and there, it's said that some human cities and even a few dominions still till the soil, but most get by with hunting, trapping and fishing.

The dwarves and their volcano cities fare best. Hidden under the crust, the very gods of the dwarves shape themselves into sprawling subterranean metropoli in which thousands take comfort from the heat produced by volcanic magma. The gods' wishes appear in strange dreams to the dwarf priests, commanding them how best to rule. And when a god's city-self is overrun or conquered, it sends such dreams to others too.

One such god, Thosh, has reached out to touch the minds of survivors and adventurers near itself. Whether drawn by promises of wealth, a willingness to prove oneself a hero, or simply a need to fight and conquer, some answer.

---

The best-known entrance to the caverns that permit entrance to the theopolis of Thosh lie on the southern slopes of the volcano which also bears his name. There is a narrow canyon which runs northeast-southwest. Ordinarily, it would be guarded. But some dreadful calamity overcame the city, and now the entrance is barely marked. Two adventurers met each other some miles back, and now approach it on foot, weapons ready.

Kyshtym says, "Hail, I am Kyshtym."

Lira \[to Kyshtym\]: "And I am Lira! Forgive me if I already asked, but I have a terrible memory sometimes. n.n; What brings you to travel these mountains?"

Kyshtym says, "Lately I have had disturbing dreams, I believe something is amiss, so I have decided to investigate."

Lira says, "Weird dreams, eh? I've had a few of them myself, lately, and have heard some interesting stories about the place, so I thought it'd be worth a look-see."

Kyshtym says, "My dreams involve visions of the warm city of Thosh as well, I believe something may have happened. Would you care to join me? Two heads are better than one."

Lira shrugs and grins, "I don't see the harm in it. Be forewarned, I have a nose for trouble!"

Kyshtym says, "In the circumstances, trouble is just what I've been expecting. Shall we be off... 9\_9"

"Ho down there!" calls a voice. A bearded face peeks over the edge of the canyon, some distance ahead.

Kyshtym calls out, "What goes on here?"

It's a bearded face - a dwarf, it turns out, after a few moment's inspection. "Who are you lot?" he demands.

Kyshtym says, "I am Kyshtym, paladin of Bahamut."

Lira squints and hollers in the dwarf's direction, "Name's Lira, what about you?"

"Hemik, guardian of the gate!" shouts back the dwarf. "Look lively, though, there's a pack of kobolds nearby. I've got food and drink up here if you've come about Thosh."

Kyshtym says, "Aye, I have."

Lira points at Kyshtym, "I'm with him." n.n;

Further up the canyon, both adventurers can make out ten humanoid creatures. Small, green, reptilian and verminous - kobolds!

Kyshtym says, "What's the best way up? I'm in no mood to dance with a hoard of kobolds at the moment."

"I'm not lowering the ladder with them around," the dwarf replies emphatically. "But if you're equal to the task of aiding our city-god, this lot shouldn't stand a chance, right?" He raises a crossbow. "I'll help, if you can keep them distracted."

Lira snickers.

Kyshtym says, "Fair enough, I'll make them regret their evil ways."

Lira says, "I need a good stretch anyway!"

Kyshtym \[to Lira\]: "Looks like we don't have much of a choice either way."

Lira nods.

In the distance, ten kobolds can be made out. They start advancing down the canyon - eight with javelins at the forefront, and two armed with slings and daggers behind them.

Kyshtym draws his blade.

The kobolds with their javelins charge forward first, shouted at and spurred on by their fellows in the rear. Hemik's crossbow makes short work of one of the scaly creatures.

Lira fires a couple arrows at the kobolds but they land in the snow, just short of their targets.

Kyshtym peers at Lira, "Don't be too hasty."

Kyshtym charges ahead at the kobolds.

The kobolds chitter and rawr and gurgle and charge across the snow. Three of them hurl their javelins at the advancing paladin.

Hemik's crossbow barely grazes one of the slingers, who retorts by firing a jagged spike of obsidian at Kyshtym - only to fall quite short. He curses in crude draconic and flails his spindly arms.

Kyshtym readies to unleash a mighty blast, but chokes and coughs instead. x\_x

One of the slingers, taking advantage of the dragonborn's distraction to pelt him in the forehead with a very sharp, very painful stone fragment.

The kobold tribe charges forward, javelins at the ready. The first who tries to stick an apparently easy target, however, finds that his aim is not quite as good as his slinger brethren - the obsidian tip of his javelin breaks off entirely as it impacts solid armor, and he stares at the now-useless stick in bemused puzzlement.

The others fare no better. Hemik makes short work of a straggler, raising his crossbow and cheering as a kobold in the rear collapses to the snow.

A second slingstone whizzes by Kyshtym's face, but he's more prepared for it this time.

Kyshtym says, "Fast little..."

While Kyshtym retreats, he's speared by a couple of the remaining kobolds. Another sling stone whizzes by, this time hitting the solid face of rock against which he's planted his back.

Happy to have a cornered target, the chittering kobolds converge for the kill. Hemik's crossbow is of no use this time, and the dwarf shouts some weak words of encouragement as he reloads.

With the paladin problem in hand, one of the slingers devotes its attention to that troublesome archer nearby, firing a well-aimed sling stone.

Another sling stone makes for Lira, but falls well short. The kobolds jabber at their weaker companions to go finish off the survivor.

Lira eeps!

At the top of the cliff, the dwarf Hemik chants a prayer. The first thing Kyshtym feels as he begins to regain consciousness is the warmth of life seep back into him. Not the comforting touch of the sun's rays, but the eternal and primordial fire that sleeps in the earth. Like the dragon's breath of his god, the power of Thosh has entered him.

Kyshtym makes a full swipe at the Kobold slinger's arm, slicing a tendon in the process.

The slinger, wounded and bleeding, unsuccessfully tries to stab his assailant with a small dagger.

Hemik's crossbow strikes one of the kobold's square in the back, and it crumples to the ground whimpering.

Lira kicks the dead kobold, "How now, ugly cow?!"

Kyshtym brandishes his longsword cloting the slinger on the side of the head.

The two slingers do their best to bring down the paladin. One succeeds in pelting him with another rock in the knee, but the other fails to make any headway with its dagger.

Lira fires a couple of shots into the air, missing the nearest kobold since she's focused on the kobold in the back. The arrow lands with a sick thud in its target and Lira cheers.

One of the slingers chucks a stone at the paladin's leg, striking him in the back of the knee. The other futilely stabs at the armor plating, but can't find a good chink.

For a moment, the slinger looked confident. Now, it finally starts to dawn on the nasty little creature that the rest of his tribe have fallen. He turns, trying to make a run for it.

The battle is over. Both combatants still standing have taken wounds. But at their feet are nine kobolds slain on open ground, and a tenth who won't soon return. True to his word, the dwarf Hemik unrolls a sturdy rope ladder down the cliff face. "Climb up, you lot, and I'll tend to your injuries," he calls.

Kyshtym says, "Thank you... -\_-"

Lira sighs, "'Bout time."

"Not all of those who brave the canyon have made it this far," the dwarf says gravely. "And you may not be the last. For that matter, my brothers already inside may need me soon. I must keep the gate safe, and conserve the fire that Thosh entrusted to me."

Kyshtym nods, "You mentioned food earlier?"

Hemik gestures at the nearby campfire, where a winter boar is roasting slowly on a spit. Two tents have been erected nearby, and a cask of ale stands tapped on a flat stone next to one of them. "Help yourselves, she's almost fully cooked," he says cheerfully.

Kyshtym says, "Again, thank you."

Kyshtym takes a couple slices of boar to help regain his strength.

Lira takes the dwarf's advice and relaxes for a bit.

"It's little hospitality," Hemik says, pouring ale into a ceramic stein and settling in near the fire. "Once Thosh was a thriving theopolis. The god provided us everything we needed, and we hewed stone to expand his body and prayed to expand his power. Now all manner of creatures have taken control of the city - come through deeper tunnels, holes leading to warrens of malefic filth I'll dare not speculate about."

Kyshtym asks, between mouthfuls, "What's happened here? Bands of kobolds running about and it's even worse inside?"

Hemik nods. "The kobolds are here because of the dragons. The great wyrms of fire that have taken up lair in our deepest, most sacred forges. Camp-followers and hangers-on. They scour the surface for easy prey and return to their masters. They've long coveted the fires of those forges, but they had help. Somehow some bastions of hell - cultists summoning demons, or worse - got into our tunnel systems. They slaughtered the defenseless, reanimated some with necromancy, fed the others to their abominable creations and pets."

The dwarf sighs. "Now that Thosh has come under attack, all manner of evil will descend on it, like vultures. I can't properly say now _what_ all is lurking inside the city. Could be anything."

Lira says, "Lovely."

Kyshtym says, "I shall do everything in my power to help then. You're quite brave to continue guarding this entrance on your own."

Hemik smiles lopsidedly. "There's dwarf champions further in - paladins of Thosh himself, and of the greater gods too. And other adventurers. Though sadly I suspect that some of them are as much here to loot as any other." He fumbles in his pocket for a moment and extends two gold coins, one for Lira, the other for Kyshtym. "Not payment, mind you. Tokens, engraved with a rune. Show these to any you meet. If they show you a similar token, they can be trusted. The rune will burn anyone not with Thosh's favor."

Kyshtym says, "You suspect traitors then?"

Hemik shakes his head. "Not traitors as such, no. No dwarf would dare. But we've sent many outsiders like yourselves into the tunnels in the past. Some might have been turned by the darkness within. Some may have snuck in to get at our wealth. Best to be cautious."

Lira says, "Well, with such a warm welcome I don't think I'll be letting my guard down too soon."

The dwarf laughs. "Yes, there's that. With some vermin you need not present it, or ask. You're welcome to sleep here tonight. If you are willing, go through the gate in the morning. If not, I bid you a safe journey."

Kyshtym nods, "Rest assured, I am not here for gold, but to vanquish all evil in my way. If Bahamut smiles upon us with Thosh we may yet see matters with this evel come to a close."
