The fire pit is burnt out by the time everyone is rested and ready to go again. Sleeping in the barracks hasn't been the most comfortable experience in any of the adventurers' lives, but it beats being trussed up by kobolds. The door beyond, heading north, remains unmolested; the barricade is secure.

Regular watches have been kept out of habit. Rioja has finished his eladrin meditation, but Morocco is still yawning as he girds himself for battle and finishes strapping his armor to his body.

Kyshtym says, "All set then? Shall we try the north?"

The warlord and wizard nod their assent.

The door opens, after a quick bit of cautious listening. Beyond it, what awaits the adventurers is roughly carven stone. There is a niche to the east near the end, and to the west, another part of the cave system seems to split off.

Kyshtym says, "You've got some experience with dungeons don't you Morocco?"

"My specialty was the Malvetish battle-campaigns, on the plains," Morocco answers with a smile. "This underground business isn't my style."

Kyshtym says, "Fair enough, I'll take the lead then."

Advancing into the corridor, Kyshtym encounters a man-made obstacle similar to the ones his party erected - a pile of stone, steel and wood that have been formed into a crude but effective barricade to westward progress. The cave tunnel snakes around a bend beyond it, but passing the barrier would require physical effort. Still, he estimates it could be done.

To the east is a closed door. Kyshtym can't make out the markings.

Kyshtym \[to Lira\]: "Com and have a look at these and see if you can make them out."

Lira follows Kyshtym and has a glance.

The simpler message at the top is in dwarvish, and reads: PANTRY. The writing below it is of greater import, also in the dwarves' language. "Plague inside," it reads, "Door must remain sealed."

Lira makes a face, "Delicious."

Finally, Kyshtym has a look at what terminates the cave to the north. Another doorway, this one subtly and cunningly sealed shut by some sort of intricate dwarven locking mechanism.

Kyshtym says, "Probably best to leave it be, unless you have an objections?"

Kyshtym says, "There may be a key to this door in there though..."

Lira smiles, "I'm not the best decision maker. I'd rather flip a coin than take the responsibility for opening a potential can of worms like that."

Kyshtym says, "Want to try removing the barrier to the west then?"

Meanwhile, Morocco is testing the barrier. "Kyshtym," he calls, "this looks strong but I think we can do it. Come on, man, let's give it a go."

Lira nods.

Kyshtym says, "Right then...Heave Ho!"

The effort isn't easy, and it does take a few minutes. Things have been so carefully knotted together or braced against each other that the whole becomes stronger than the sum of its parts. Still after a short time Kyshtym finds a plank of wood that seems vulnerable. Smashing it, then hauling the rest of the rocks and metal plates out of the way before it all collapses doesn't take long.

Kysh works his way around the stone cave cautiously, sometimes having to duck to avoid an outcropping of rock. Just around the corner to the south, he can make out a hand and foot of something humanoid, laying on the ground.

Kyshtym says, "Oi, I see something here."

Upon closer inspection, a body is discovered - a dwarven warrior bearing the arms and armor of the defenders of Thosh. He's quite dead, and beyond him is another barrier built just as sturdily as the previous one. He must have constructed them himself, fortifying this cave in order to wait for reinforcements that never came.

Kyshtym says, "Tch, poor fellow..."

Kyshtym makes a gesture to Bahamut and says a prayer.

Significantly, he reinforced both sides of the tunnel. Whatever else can be inferred, it seems that the western path may not be completely safe.

Kyshtym says, "There may be trouble ahead, he bottled himself up in this corridor pretty tight."

The adventurers have a look. While it's obvious that this man received several stab wounds and bled heavily, the dragonborn is the first and only one of them to notice the other signs, those that survived death - signs of a slow-acting poison, probably introduced by one of the weapons he was stabbed with.

There are also a few scorch marks on his clothing and equipment. Kyshtym knows these all too well - the fire beetles that have accompanied certain of the kobolds have breathed fire at him before.

Kyshtym scowls, "What kind of foul creature would poison their weapons? No honor whatsoever."

Lira grumbles, "Our outlook just keeps getting better and better..."

"What kind of a fighter breathes ice into a crowd of men?" Morocco asks with a sly smile. "Everyone needs an edge."

Kyshtym says, "I do not know if I am prepared to deal with poison. I wonder if this slain fellow has the key to that door."

Kyshtym kneels down to check the corpse, "Forgive me."

A quick search of the fallen defender yields no keys or other useful finds. A few days' worth of uneaten rations, and the common arms and mail of the dwarven guard, are all that he had left.

Kyshtym says, "Hmm, Do you suppose that warning on the pantry might have been in jest to the cooks poor cooking?"

Kyshtym shrugs, "I think West may be our best course so far."

Again the paladin exerts his strength and perceptiveness to overcoming the obstacle, and again he's able to reduce the blockage of the cave tunnel to mere flotsam and jetsam scattered around the floor. The way is clear.

Kyshtym says, "There is a door at the end of this hallway."

Kyshtym readies his sword and shield, then attempts to open the door.

The door embedded into the rock swings open soundlessly. Beyond, Kyshtym can make out rows and rows of bunk beds - three high, stacked to the ceiling. These are the barracks proper, where the dwarven guard slept and rested when not on duty. Now half of the bunks are partially or totally in ruins, having been salvaged for the war raging throughout the city. In the northwest corner, for example, the bunks have been cleared away to make room for a fire. Around that fire are three goblins, all wearing armor with a curious insignia stamped on it. And to the south are a pair of fire beetles, gnawing on some sort of carrion.

Morocco, ever the hot-blooded and impulsive type, charges in. "Malvet!" he shouts, bringing his powerful broadsword to bear on the fire beetle nearest the door and hacking deeply into it. "Take them, friends! Take courage!"

One of the goblins at the fire bolts first, springing to action and grabbing his weird serrated sword from its sheath. He positions himself between the bunks, blade at the ready for anyone else who comes through.

Lira stands back, opting to support her comrades by firing into the room and pelting the closest target from a distance, already doing damage to the fire beetle in the corner.

The other two goblins jump up from their positions as well, grabbing spears from their feet as they rise. They position themselves among the bunk beds, chittering at each other in the queer goblin tongue.

Kyshtym steps in the room spotting the Goblin with the wicked looking blade and strikes to prevent the foe from having the advantage. His sword strikes true to the creatures wrist.

Rioja conjures a cloud of daggers to impale and disembowel the fire beetle facing Morocco, and quite satisfyingly ends its life. As the creature gives a painful last screech, the nimble eladrin ducks past the goblin to position himself behind the bunks.

The second beetle charges forward, stepping over its fallen brother, and lets out a gout of flame that briefly singes the wizard for his trouble. Kyshtym and Morocco emerge unscathed, having grown wise and canny with regard to these creatures.

Morocco does his best to meet this new challenge, but the beetle is too quick, and snaps at his ankles before he can position himself for a good stab.

The goblin blackblade fares no better against Kyshtym. It feints once, but its real swing doesn't connect, and it takes a cautious step backward after the attempt.

Lira continues firing into the room, but has a hard time working from the small corridor and sighs as she fails to hit anything.

Rather than attacking, the goblin spearmen move again, one retreating behind the bunks, the other readying himself for an attack just behind the blackblade.

Kyshtym sideles himself to blast the goblins with his breath and, with a deep breath, sends a chill their way they'll not soon forget.

Two of the goblins are caught in the blast; the third shields itself with its compatriot's body.

Rioja calls out more daggers, again centered on the fire beetle confronting Morocco. The beetle isn't caught by surprise quite as much as its fallen fellow, and in any event isn't already bleeding from a broadsword's edge, but it doesn't manage to get out of the swirl in time.

In turn, it does manage to bite Morocco in the leg, and the warlord slumps against the wall of the barracks to support himself.

"Faz egh!" shouts Morocco, in what sounds like goblin. It might be, but it's apparently enough to startle the goblins who were eying Kysh, and he positions himself again. The wounded warlord isn't much better on his target, and the fire beetle and him trade attempted attacks back and forth.

The goblin blackblade retreats, taunting Kyshtym in its degraded patois, but he does not attack.

Lira pauses, takes a deep breath and aims carefully at her quarry, firing with such force she snuffs out the beetle completely in one shot.

One of the goblins chucks a javelin at Kyshtym, but his audacity far outstrips his luck. He backs away, raising his spear again in a defensive gesture.

Kyshtym chants a prayer to Bahamut to cleanse the evil from the goblin blackblade, holy light surrounds it dazzling its eyes, but it is resiliant to the attack.

Hoping to capitalize on this attack, Rioja teleports across the wall of bunks to arrive in the middle of the three goblins. A powerful wave of thunder knocks two of them back, but the canny blackblade avoids death today by leaping out of the way.

Having been struck by Lira's attack, the remaining fire beetle finally bleeds out and clacks its mandibles together in a final feeble gesture.

With this out of the way, Morocco turns, and sees. He comes barreling around the bunks, pushing past Kyshtym to engage the goblins. "Get outta there!" he yells, and Rioja nods and slips away while the warlord brandishes his blade.

The blackblade slips behind Morocco in a vain attempt to backstab the man. It's a final, futile gesture; Kyshtym's holy fire consumes his last ounce of effort, and he collapses.

An opportunity has presented itself. One of the goblin warriors runs to get behind Morocco, and both try to stab the brave but impetuous soldier.

Kyshtym seeing his friend wounded, Kyshtym steps up to aid, "Hang in there, these vermin will not hinder us!"

One of the goblins lashes out with its shortsword as Rioja backs away from it, but the move was well worth it. The wizard conjures up his swirling razor-sharp daggers, directing them against the far goblin.

Turning, Morocco lets out a ferocious yell and batters aside the shortsword of the goblin behind him, leaving an opening for Kyshtym to exploit. The paladin obliges, impaling the goblin warrior painfully against the dwarf bunks behind it. It slides off of the paladin's blade to fall next to its ally.

The goblin dodges to its left as two arrows streak past. It makes to stab at Morocco, the only target in range of its weapon, but something knocks the blow aside at the last moment, and only Kyshtym can make out the fading golden glory of Bahamut's power as the force which saved his ally.

The eladrin wizard hums another incantation, and again his daggers come to life, tormenting and flaying the hapless goblin as it scurries toward any hope of safety.

Expertly the warrior leaps past the scattered remnants of the firewood the goblins were using. "Hey!" he shouts, distracting the goblin long enough to let Kyshtym move opposite him.

The goblin must feel extremely lucky right now. Two more arrows hit the wall behind it without comment, and it even manages to spear the dragonborn. It slides out of the trap set for it by the two warriors, hoping to use the archer nearby as a shield.

Kyshtym steps behind the goblin and bashes the foe across the noggin intending to knock it's senses, but instead knocks it dead.

Kyshtym says, "Whoops" in a bland tone.

Kyshtym asks his comrads, "All well?"

Lira chuckles, "My aim's apparently a bit off but I'm otherwise unscathed."

"All I am is ever well, about my comrade, who can tell," murmurs Rioja, smiling grimly. Morocco chuckles unhappily, favoring his left leg as he takes a seat on one of the short bunks and begins to inspect the injury.

"I'll be fine," announces the soldier after a moment. "Just need to rest and get some water on it."

Kyshtym nods and tosses his flask to the warlord.

A search of the goblins and the rest of the room proves extremely fruitful. Rioja identifies the dead goblins as members of the Strife Hand clan. Though they don't have a door key on them, they have amassed quite a bit of wealth and piled it haphazardly in the corner. They had taken hatchets to the bunks, building up a supply of firewood. The adventurers shudder when they discover what's roasting on the spit over the fire - a dead kobold.

The barracks, then, were to be a sort of short-term camp for the goblins. If they were camping here, they must have expected reinforcements, just as the fallen dwarf outside did. Did he know about them, and think to block the way?

One of the most interesting finds is a black longbow, which after a moment is identified by Rioja. "The Stormspire Forge produced this bow, it harnesses lightning to bring foes low," he explains. "It's magical and rather fetching, shooting lightning instead of fletching." He points out the runes to chant on the bow's inner edge which empower the thing.
