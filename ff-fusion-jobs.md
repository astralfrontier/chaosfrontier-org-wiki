- Black Sage (BLM/SGE) -alternate between harmful fire attacks & protective ice barriers for allies

## Melee DPS

- Fated Blade (AST/SAM) - discern your enemyâ€™s destiny, then enact it with your katana
- Beast Reaper (BLU/RPR) - defeat powerful monsters, then bind their spirits to yours as an avatar and unleash their attacks via your scythe
- Stormspear (DRG/BLM) - Leap to the heavens to imbue your spear with lightning and ice magic, then fall upon your foe as a fiery comet


## Ranged DPS

-  Dark Archer (DRK/BRD) - draws on inner grief to sing dirges & rain down ghostly arrows

## Caster DPS
