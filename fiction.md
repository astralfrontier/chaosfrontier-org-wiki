# Short thoughts
Random thoughts from Captain America in the MCU. It's possible the guy has no idea what a nuke is. So when Tony diverts the bomb in Avengers, Steve asks what it was. And somebody explains it to him. And he learns the history of this weapon - after having fought HYDRA and its super-science for months, mind you - and who invented and where it was used. And he just gets really quiet, and goes for a long long walk.
