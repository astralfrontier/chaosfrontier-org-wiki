# Never For Attack
Saw a picture from Rebels - Darth Vader riding on top of a TIE fighter, I think. Got me thinking. What does the heroic version of that look like?

Imagine there's a pack of Sith warriors, backed up by hundreds of droids or stormtroopers or whatever is the new hotness. They're standing around some big superweapon, getting ready to use it on innocent furry aliens on some helpless moon, when...

Out of the sun, an X-Wing (or the era equivalent) comes. They open fire at the cockpit, but there's nobody there. Suddenly a black-cloaked figure leaps off the top of it, soft-landing as the X-Wing plows into the superweapon. The bombs strapped to its wings all go off. The weapon and everything near it explodes. The pilot has been operating the X-Wing's controls via the Force, so she's fine.

A bunch of smoke bombs are Force pushed into the air and detonate, raining down a dense sight-obscuring fog over the mooks. They can't see. Many open fire wildly, causing a chain reaction of chaos. They're dealt with for a minute, enough time to settle this. When those stormtroopers clear the smoke, there's only gonna be one color of lightsaber visible.

The pilot takes off her hood and draws two lightsabers. She's got flashing eyes, a steely gaze, and a heart full of compassion for a planet that doesn't deserve what these sons of bitches have in store. Live or die, everything she is comes down to this fight.

The Sith, naturally, pull out their lightsabers. They've got attitude out to here: You came to the wrong neighborhood, Jedi.

This is a serious fight, so she's pushed back by their numbers. Fine. She tosses her lightsabers into the air Now she's controlling them with the Force. A shake of her hands, and two more sabers fall out of her robe's sleeves. She ignites those. Now the Sith are like, My god! Do we really suck, or is this girl really that good?

The smoke clears. The deck is strewn with the bodies. The surviving stormtroopers look around. The woman is standing there. Or rather, she's barely supporting herself. Her limbs and torso are covered with cauterized cuts. She's got one lit saber - the rest are destroyed, their parts and crystals scattered among the dead. She's breathing heavily.

The troopers raise their rifles. After a second, she notices. "Mercy," she says.

"A Jedi asking for mercy?" scoffs one of the troopers.

"No," she manages. "I'm offering it. To you. Weapon's gone. Go home. Live."

After a few moments, the troopers all lower their weapons.

She lets out a soft sigh, and smiles again. Relief. Not that she would be killed by them, but that they didn't have to die. She whistles, then leaps off the edge of where she's standing. A second X-Wing streaks by, catching her. And she's gone.
