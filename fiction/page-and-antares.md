# Page and Antares

Page was a star singer. It wasn't just a job. The idea of it gave her joy. It kept her awake at night, staring through shielded viewports at Antares, the star, her star. Her free time was spent poring over calculations, examining astrometric data, and composing waveforms in the simulation tank. When it actually came time to work, she was ready. She wasn't the best, not yet, but she was the fastest-rising junior in the Scorpio Trading Alliance's team of singers.

Page's ancestors had been the original settlers of Antares. Their prototype starships, fusion-driven and ruggedized beyond the bounds of sanity, were the first to launch from Earth. They traveled the long light-years from Earth, hoping that familiar neighbors like Proxima Centauri or Gliese or the TRAPPIST system would pan out. They watched helplessly as the second and third wave leapfrogged past them, driven by rapid advances in FTL technology. By the time they arrived, a halo of colonized worlds was established around Sol. The fleet waved and kept moving.

The problem was power. The FTL engine, operating on some obscure principles of physics, only the computers really understood, had no theoretical speed limit. The more power you applied to the drive, the faster you'd go. By mass, most of a colonial ship was a series of hyperfusion plants, fed by tanks of hydrogen that doubled as propellant for conventional maneuvering. The ship came with equipment to scoop atmosphere from a gas giant, then refine it into hydrogen. Even one fusion plant could light up a city. But the FTL engine needed the power of a dozen cities to even crawl across the sky.

The first wave tinkered with their ships on the long road outward. They constructed gigantic batteries to hold excess energy, ran their power plants at full bore to recharge them, landed on planets and built colonies and waited and waited. They learned the most efficient way of traveling from star to star, planet to planet. They hatched a plan, and changed course.

Like many of her extended kin, Page thought of the star as a living thing. Antares had awaited her people for eleven million years. It had been known of since the dawn of human history. As Rehua, it had ruled as chief of all stars according to the Maori of New Zealand. Now it had no more hydrogen to fuse, and a star without its fire could only cannibalize itself as it waited for the end. But one day, Antares witnessed with surprise the arrival of a fleet of tiny metal cans. The tiny human occupants of these ships slowly adorned it with a crown of solar capture stations, greedily drinking the ruddy light of the dying star. Decade after decade, Antares was being given a purpose.

Self-sufficient starships, driven by a mobile power plant, could go far but not fast. Battery power could make a ship go fast but not far. After a millennium of technological advancement, the capacity of a starship's storage batteries was orders of magnitude greater than the best power plant's output. The supergiant, the universe's best and biggest fusion plant, would feed even the thirstiest of starships a thousand times over.

Traders and merchantment, warships and scouting expeditions, could get to distant star systems a hundred times faster than self-powered ships, if they launched from Antares after buying full batteries from the residents. And if a trader was going to visit Antares regularly to recharge, why not see if you could sell your goods to other traders already docked nearby? The variable supergiant became a hub of commerce.

Variable? Yes. The output of Antares fluctuated, which was dangerous to anything nearby. Not content to merely be old, the star had to be senile as well. The colonists, even their increasingly-wealthy heirs, lacked the tech, talent, and materials to enclose the star entirely. But there was a way. Astrophysical fluid dynamics provided the equations and models to understand the star's behavior. Changes to the corona - the wreath of plasma that surrounded all stars - would mitigate the worst problems. But how?

The complex flows of coronal plasma had a rhythm, a pattern. It was a song the old star bitterly sang itself. It was violent and irregular. And it could be changed. By the time of the Scorpio Trading Alliance's formation, the first star singers were already creating new compositions, then performing them via an elegantly orchestrated release of antimatter bombs into the corona. Explosions that would have devastated the orbital trade hubs were to the star a softly comforting lullabye. Antares ceased its vicious fits. In the lee of its newfound calm, the traders and their star singers prospered.

Page loved old Antares, the decrepit king. She loved Antares B, the grumpy old blue-white companion star that absorbed the brunt of the red supergiant's rages like a long-suffering brother. She loved the strange and amazing people who came to trade, and she loved the wild and wondrous goods they brought with them. She loved their stories of far-off lands, of haunted planets and glowing moons and things more miraculous than that. This was her kingdom, and she was one of its protectors.
