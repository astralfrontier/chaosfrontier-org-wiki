# Ya Dropped This
The woman looked at the purse, at the meaty hand holding it out at her, and up at the grumpy, warty face of the man who held it.

"This is yours," he grunted. "Ya dropped it."

The subway hummed and buzzed around the pair. She stared, trying to remember.

"I found it a ways back," the man said, filling the silence. He pointed over his shoulder at the tunnel.

"I..." It was her purse. Recollection came back. "Some.. some boys threw it down the tunnel, grabbed it from my shoulder, as a joke. It was... that was such a long, difficult day for me." She wiped tears from her eyes. "So much had gone wrong, and I wanted to give up. I stumbled down there, looking for it.. I heard the train, I just didn't care any more..."

The blood on her dress faded into visibility. The wounds she took, the injuries that caused her death, came into focus. The man didn't flinch. He just held out the purse again.

She accepted it, with a smile, and the blood became light, and her body evaporated into mist and radiance. "Thank you for caring," was her final whisper.

The man shrugged at empty air. "Did too little of that when I was alive," he said to himself. On the front of his shirt, where the spreading red stain of the burglar's bullets still marked him, a fragment of red dissolved into white.

"Guess I still got a ways to go," he mumbled to himself, and turned back toward the teeming subway station with a smile.
