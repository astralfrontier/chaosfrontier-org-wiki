# Filk
I want a new bug
One that won't make me sick
One that won't make me crash PyCharm
Or make me use a hack or trick

I want a new bug
One that's got a good spec
One that won't piss my testers off
Or make my code a wreck

One that won't make us regress
Wondering what to do
Nothing broke when I compiled and now it's in Bamboo
Can I get code review?

I want a new bug
One that's in scope
One that won't take too long
Or run over SOAP

I want a new bug
One that will go away
One that lets me go home at night
One that won't make me work all day

One that won't make us regress
Wondering what to do
Nothing broke when I compiled and now it's in Bamboo
Can I get code review?
I got code review, baby

I want a new bug
Where tests run as they should
One that won't make me look too bad
One that won't make me look too good

I want a new bug
One with no doubt
One that won't make me test too much
Since repro steps work out

One that won't make us regress
Wondering what to do
Nothing broke when I compiled and now it's in Bamboo
Can I get code review?
I got code review
