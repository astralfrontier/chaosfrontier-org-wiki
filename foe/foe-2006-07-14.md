The black Lincoln rumbles down the streets of the Big Apple. In the back seat, Luther Bissett is joined by four other Exalts: Andrew "Poe" Morgan, Newton Benford, Jet, and the man called Jack Jones.

Up front, the driver hears nothing of their conversation. A divider of tinted glass provides a barrier against mortal questioning. Right now, Mr. Bissett - a former intelligence man and now Sidereal Exalt - is taking the group to what he calls "a safe location" near the United Nations building.

All seems calm. Traffic on 42nd is the usual, now that the Queens Midtown tunnel is behind them.

A shot rings out. There's a sound of splintering glass. The limo suddenly veers, almost hitting panicked pedestrians bound for the Grand Hyatt a block away. The five Exalts lurch in their seats. Another shot follows. The driver's been hit.

Morgan hits the floor of the limo at the first sounds of gunfire. "This is getting to be a habit," he mutters.

Gunshots wake Jet up. The swerve does more. "Open the roof, now!" she barks out. She doesn't know where the controls are, herself.

Benford removes his seatbelt and thumbs the controls for the partition, and also the sunroof, with a strained look on his face. "More than once a day? Your doctor won't be pleased."

"Christ!" Jack ducks down in his seat reflexively - to throw the gunman's aim, should it be pointed towards him - before popping back up to quickly scan for the aggressor.

The limo slams into the high-rise to the right of the street, a few yards from Lexington, and rests motionless. Jack can't immediately see anyone on the street.

"We're sitting ducks unless we move," Jack announces after a pause, removing his seatbelt to clamber through the opened partition. The driver sports a bullethole in his neck; Jack fumbles to unlock the man's seatbelt as he glances back. "Anyone have a weapon?"

Benford hops over the partition, buckling in next to Jack, but keeping his head down. He fumbles in a compartment by the door, looking for a map... but he remembers some of the geography from previous visits. "Luther, where's home for us?" he barks.

"Just drive!" the Sidereal shouts back.

The driver-side door swings open, and - propelled by Jack - the unfortunate chauffeur's corpse tumbles out. The door closes, and Jack locks the seatbelt over his lap. "Hold on."

Another shot punctures the back window - fortunately, a shower of glass does not follow. A rooftop sniper?

Jet pulls off her jacket and reveals her full armament. Underneath, she has four guns strapped to her, and two clips for each. She growls and pulls a gun and an extra clip, tossing them to Luther. "Let's get the hell out of here!"

The ringing of gunfire is now answered with a roar from the limo's engine, and the limo careens backwards, swinging back onto the road. Jack grimaces privately at the handling, and then rams his foot down on the accelerator.

The Limo roars, veering around the building and onto Lexington. It's greeted by a chorus of car horns and shouts from those who haven't yet recognized the high-powered whine of a sniper's rifle. On the sidewalk, people are hunkering down, covering their heads with briefcases. Others are dashing for the doors of the buildings around them.

Looking back, Jet spots a gold-trimmed Honda motorcycle, and rider, pulling intently after the limo. The rider is leathered up, with both hands on the handlebars.

Jack lets the world reduce itself to a few primary concerns; the pursuit, the obstacles on the road, and the direction of the ring of gunfire - he attempts to extrapolate the sniper's approximate location, and refines that estimation with each successive shot.

He glances up at his passengers through the rear-view mirror. "Anyone that can handle a gun, please do so. Get rid of that bike."

"I hope they are riding with Geico," says Jet. She waits for a heartbeat, then pops up through the roof, drawing a gun and measuring the shot with her gleaming eyes.

Benford slips down into the seat, guaging the traffic ahead, tracing a route in his head, and trusting his teammates to do their jobs.

Behind them, the motorcyclist is accelerating. He seems bent on ramming the back of the limo.

Jet is about to take her shot. The whine of a sniper round turns into a loud bang, and the Beretta shatters in her hand. Surprised, she lets go - her gun has been shot to death.

Jack pulls around the corner of Lexington and 41st, glancing warily at the tower that he believes houses the sniper as he does so - and the limo roars down 41nd, deftly weaving through slower-moving traffic as it seeks to escape the rifle's hounding bullets.

Benford says, "There might be more than one of them," Benford quips. "There's a tunnel, one block west, one block north, comes out on Park Ave."

Jet drops the ruined gun back in the limo. "These guys are not screwing around," she mutters. With a growl she turns to face forward and leaps first up to the roof of the limo and, kicking off of it, up and back, her body floating above the speeding limo, her legs both lashing out in a kick aimed (hopefully) right at the biker's head, and Jet's hands are held at the ready to catch the handlebars.

In answer, the biker pops a wheelie, sending the rapidly-spinning front tire directly at Jet.

The biker is pitched off his seat and thrown back, hitting the road, as Jet vaults into the seat and takes control of the handlebars. But she sees something incredible - the biker is gripping at his stolen steed with both feet, using inhuman strength to stay with it

Jack, monitoring the pursuit through a windowside mirror, arches a bemused eyebrow at the bike driver's stunt - but, seeing that Jet has peeled his attention away, gives it no further immediate concern. He mentally maps his path to arrive at the tunnel Benford suggested, and remains alert for new sources of threat. This seems a thorough operation; he feels sure that there will be more.

Jet speeds up, then carefully matches the pace of the limo. Not waiting for her foe to get a better shot at her, she kicks up to the seat and drives herself in a terrific flip back towards the limo. The moment she is upside down, she has her gun out. Not aiming for the man clinging to it, but for the engine of the falling cycle itself.

Seeing the act, the downed motorcyclist slams his elbow into the pavement, leaving behind shreds of leather. The impact, joined by Jet's leap, is enough to send the cycle spinning. He kicks off at just the right moment to vault forward, toward the trunk of the limo.

Jet has no time to doubt what she's seeing. She simply spins and opens fire on the biker.

Bullets slam into the biker. The Beretta has insufficient force to knock him back, even in the air, but they should still injure him. Instead, Jet watches jagged chunks of leather flying off the already-tortured jacket, but the man lands in a catlike crouch on the trunk.

Benford has been fumbling around in the glovebox, the console, and under the seat, coming up with an unexpected weapon: a collapsible steel baton. "New York. Of course." He hears the exchange of gunfire and notices that Jet's opponent, inexplicably, is still standing.

Behind Benford, Blissett is already opening fire. His weapon does little more than Jet's, though, and the unearthly biker seems almost disdainful of the slugs being shot at him. His face is invisible behind the helmet he still wears.

Jet strides forward, and hopes that fists can do what a gun can't. With a feral growl she is moving forward, and feigning first with a flick of her left foot, and then letting loose with a roundhouse that could shatter a cinderblock. Hopefully it can do the same to the biker's neck.

A hand stronger than steel lashes out from the crouched biker, intercepting Jet's ankle. The helmeted head swivels to regard Jet, somehow insectile in its precision.

The tunnel looms, and the car is soon swallowed by shadow beneath sheltering concrete. Artificial lighting now casts itself over the unlikely battle as it unfolds, shifting in intensity as the car draws nearer or further from a source of illumination.

Jet quickly backs off, getting herself just a little time and space. Enough to cast down two more guns to those in the limo. The rest of her concentration is focused on her inhuman enemy.

Benford reaches a hand back towards the open sunroof, catching one of the weapons as it falls through. He allows himself less than a blink of surprise as he turns and smashes out the passenger window with the butt of the folded baton.

Morgan scrambles to catch the other Beretta, and then shoves one elbow down on the window-opening switch on the driver's side. Poe leans out the window and opens fire on the biker - not hoping to do any real damage, but merely to distract the assailant long enough for Jet to deliver a killing blow.

Blissett joins in, with a rapid-fire burst of bullets at the biker.

Benford pops through the smashed window and adds to the fusillade.

The Tiger in Jet grows, and along her arm essence runs in glowing streams, and fingertips turn into horrible claws, gleaming like silver under a full moon. The Lunar focuses all her power into one stroke, that terrible claw raised, then with a roar slammed forward, at the helmet of her enemy.

The helmet's plastic shield shatters, revealing - just for a moment - a blank surface behind it. While Jet doesn't feel flesh, she does feel something sink in - and the force is enough to disrupt the biker's balance. The gunfire does the rest, and he pitches back onto the road. The limo speeds away as he tumbles.

Jet watches her foe fall away, and a Tiger roar booms from her before she gets herself back into the limo.

Blissett drops his pistol into a jacket pocket, letting out a long sigh of relief.

Benford slips back through the window and buckles in, clicking the safety. "Who - hell, WHAT - was that?"

Morgan closes the window and slumps on the seat. "I don't think we're getting the deposit back," he remarks dryly.

"It wasn't human.. it didn't even have a face," notes Jet. "I felt myself hit something, but there was nothing there. It was just blank." With a frown she adds, "And it moves as well as I do."

"They'll be back eventually," Jack comments. "Then we'll find out more."

Morgan shakes his head. "Yeah, we'll see a lot more of people like that, I'll bet. Things. Whatever. This makes being hunted by MS-13 look like a playground tussle."

Still on the top of the limo, Jet can hear the distant wail of police sirens. And, receding into the distance, she can see the enigmatic motorcyclist rising to his feet on the street.

"He's not done," murmurs Jet. She glares back towards the enemy. "Not by a long shot." She's going to get herself inside and with a smirk say, "I'm fine, by the way."

Benford nods to Jet. "And for that blessing, I am most grateful, miss. Thank you." He thinks for a moment, then asks, "Would everyone please turn off their mobile phones? Just in case. Humor me. Blissett - we need somewhere we can go."

"My safe-house is probably blown," admits the Sidereal. "Ditch the car. Throw away your phones. We should get out of New York."

Benford says, "We'll need another vehicle, then. And fast." The end of the tunnel looms just ahead.

"There's a car back at La Guardia," remarks Morgan. "Jet and I drove it up here. Jet, do you think you'd be able to tell if anyone was watching it? Or planted a bug on it while we were away?"

Benford says, "I'm not sure that's a good idea. There'll be cops everywhere, even in the parking lot. Bomb on a plane, remember?"

Jack slows the car to a more usual pace, and reaches into his jacket to extract a sleek black phone, which he flicks the switch on and throws into the space beneath the glovebox. "I can find us a vehicle, if our American friends are not in a position to supply."

"I think I could figure it out," says Jet. "Assuming they have a normal scent, anyway. I'm not sure just what the thing was that I just hit. There are no sure bets."

Benford's Quicksilver begins to ring.

Benford says, "Keep the call short, Jack." He turns to look back at Blissett, as he pulls out his phone, looking at the caller ID. "And who do we go to for absolution, now that we are outlaws?"

The caller ID corresponds to Hel's 'safe' number.

Benford unfolds the phone. "Benford. We need to keep this short. You catch any of that?"

"What just happened?" Hel's voice asks, worriedly. "Is Luther with you?"

Benford says, "Yes, he's fine. We're all fine. He found us on the plane, then some... THING tried to kill us on the way home. A sniper and a motorcyclist. The biker was some kind of Exalt. We need to get out of town."

Benford spots a parking garage up ahead, and covers the mouthpiece for a moment. "That might be a good place to go shopping, old son."

"I can't help with that. But we got another call. The... Jet's initial contact says he's found another Solar. He wants to rendezvous with you ASAP. He says you need a hero of the _wulin_. I don't understand, but I promised to pass it along."

Benford says, "Whatever he means, he's probably right. Where do we go?"

"Get back to your vehicle. I think you may have to fight your way out of New York in any case. Drive to Atlanta. Can you do it?"

Benford says, "Of course we can. Just don't ask us how, yet."

In the rear-view mirror, Jack can see a Bronco approaching them at high speed. And in the driver's seat is a man wearing a biker's helmet.

"WNBC News. Good evening, I'm Lynda Baquero.

An outbreak of violence this evening temporarily shut down Grand Central Terminal, as mysterious figures traded gunfire in a deadly chase through downtown Manhattan.

The attack began at 12:30 PM when a rooftop sniper opened fire on a limousine. The vehicle then drove off, evading the pursuit of an unidentified motorcyclist as they made their escape. The driver of the limousine was found dead near the Grand Hyatt, where the shootout began.

Police are on the lookout for any information regarding the sniper, the motorcyclist, or the limousine inhabitants, or any connection with the bomb threat at La Guardia Airport earlier this afternoon. A police spokesperson refused to rule out organized crime involvement in the incident..."

Lao Xin sits in a dirty diner in Shreveport, Louisiana. Beside him sits an unnamed man wearing a slightly rumpled suit. Matching plates of apple pie and cups of black coffee rest on the counter before them. Behind the counter, the television announces its own version of the events transpiring in New York City.

The Chinese becomes aware of his neighbor's presence, and the man - the same who met him in Hong Kong - smiles grimly. "_Nihao_."

"_Nihao_," replies the Chinese. Xin is mildly surprised to see that same face so far from... well it used to be home. He gestures towards the television, "The more things change..."

"Yeah." The suit slices off the end of the apple pie with his fork, lifting it to his mouth. "I got some friends in the middle of it. You want to help them out, hero?"

"You even have to ask?" Xin polishes off a bite of pie, glances down at it longingly. "When do I leave?"

"We're going right now," the Sidereal says, then pauses. Tossing a hundred-dollar bill on the counter, he scoops up the pie plate and coffee mug. "You're driving, though."

Another forkful of pie, "For the road," explains Xin as he heads out into the street. "Alright. What's the best way to get there?" As he exits he has to wonder, _How did he do that anyway?_
