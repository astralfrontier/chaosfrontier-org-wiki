Travelling for such long times takes some getting used to. Even when it is his turn to drive, Xin is still a little antsy. He keeps shifting his hands around the wheel, while the others make themselves busy in one way or another. He tries to catch Jet's attention. "So, uh, Jet," it's a subtle tactic. "Everyone seems to know each other well. Well, almost." Very insightful and articulate too.

"Not exactly," says Jet. Sure, she has kinda become Poe's girlfriend, but the others are pretty new. "We only knew them for about.. hmm, what, 500, 800 miles more than you? We did almost die twice together, though. That can change a lot."

Xin nods, "It can. It happened more often than you'd imagine. But I suppose hanging from a helicopter is a bit more deadly than... well, you know, come to think of it, I don't know. What did you do before, uh," he taps his forehead right in the center of where one's Caste Mark would be.

"Oh, this and that," says Jet. She grins and shifts in her seat. She likes shotgun. She can see far more up here. "I ran drugs, I stole, and when I wanted to relax I would dance at clubs," says Jet wryly. She laughs a little, and as usual with her, it's hard to be sure if she's serious or not. "I didn't have a very structured existance, you might say."

"Yeah but what did you really do," asks Xin. He rests up against his seat a little bit, shifting so he's comfortable-for now. "I can see that, though. You have that look, my mom would say. She was always better at that kind of thing than me. You seem to have quite the family of your own though. How'd that end up happening?" Then after a minute or two of driving, "Wait... you really did all that?" Xin pays attention. Really he does.

"I didn't buy a strip club cause I'm a nun," says Jet sarcastically. "And it.. just kinda happened, really. Since I changed, I started feeling things more strongly, somehow. Or more honestly, I started thinking that maybe I can feel that way and get away with it." She shrugs it off. "The boy kinda fell in my lap, and at first I was pretty upset to be burdened, but.. you know, Timothy's a great kid. I won't let anyone take him away."

"Ah. Well I thought you might be with the Sisters of... uhm, something," replies Xin, deadpan. "Why didn't you think you could get away with it before?" Xin is catching up now, "I haven't met Timothy, really, but with you and the others for parents, no doubt he'll turn out fine. I shall have to ask him how he managed the fall into your lap."

"He was in the wrong place, you might say," says Jet. "Or the right one. Either way, he's got a lot to endure still. As for the others, well.. just plain attraction, and having someone to help them makes a big difference for them. Naomi, Amy, and Michelle all knew me before. Becca was in a really bad spot when I first met her a few weeks ago. I loved her at first sight, really, and knew I wanted to give her a shot at happiness." The Lunar sighs, "And I'm getting sappy.. anyway, I couldn't do it before because I didn't have the confidence. I wasn't superhuman. It felt weird. Now it feels almost natural."

"I think I know what you mean," says Xin. "At least about having the confidence. When you know you can do more, you feel the drive to do more, you feel comfortable letting yourself do more. Almost like there's this drive to try and push yourself..."

"We weren't made this way to be what we were," says Jet. "We were meant to go farther, to push what we've been given to its limits and beyond." She keeps her eyes on the road, always watching. "It seems that we're going to have enough chances to grow, and to test ourselves."

"And others." Xin wonders, after a moment, "Did you see... er, that is, what was it like when you Changed?"

"Mmm, it was pretty amazing," says Jet. She grins impishly, "The Silver Lady kissed me." She shivers just thinking of it. "It was.. wild. The most possessive thing I've ever felt. I have a feeling for you it was nothing like that. I felt so alive, and I could do anything!"

Xin laughs, "No. Yours sounds a little more, ah, involved." Xin explains, "I nearly died. Would have if not for that... it was... breathtaking. I felt as though I could hold the world in my hands. Saw in one moment how everything was, how it worked."

"I still don't know what it is that makes us so different, though," says Jet. "I mean, it's obvious we are different, I just wonder why one of us was chosen for this and another for something different." She looks thoughtful for a moment and asks, "What was your life like before you changed? Was it pretty screwed-up?"

"When you look back on it, yeah. Kinda. I think everyone's is. I spent a lot of time risking my life, trying to make the unreal seem real and the impossible within the reach." Xin laughs, "The old stories you know, tales of martial masters who could walk on trees, and fly through the air. Of undefeatable warriors or their modern day counterparts. Heh. I think it was that idea, that anyone-even the weakest-could be like those people if they tried, that drew me to those things."

"Did you ever.. kill anyone?" asks Jet seriously. She notes calmly, "I killed a bunch of people before and during my change." Perhaps her ability to talk that way sets her apart, as well. "I am hoping that I figure out all the reasons we went one way or another. I want to understand what I am, and what all of you are."

Xin shakes his head. "No. I've seen people die, though. Accidents." There's a pained look on his face, "Let's just say safety's not the number one concern at times." He too speaks calmly and easily, "But I've never killed anyone. That's probably going to change, though," he says. "What about you, why'd you end up killing them? What have you learned about yourself from doing so?"

"For vengeance," says Jet softly. "Sometimes to keep them from killing me," she adds. With a sigh, she runs a finger down the insulation between the door and the window. "Sometimes you do it just to prove yourself. I come from a different world, Xin. It's not a pretty place. My appearance can be pretty misleading. I'm not soft."

"Everyone has their own world. I've had a glimpse into the one you're talking about... seen it with makeup on, and with it off," replies Xin. "I didn't think you were soft for a moment. You're very... hmm, I'm not sure what the right word is."

"I don't fit in the categories too well," says Jet. "I can blend in, but I prefer to stick out. I love what I've been given and I love showing it off." She clearly loves to tease, as well. "So how about you? You sure as hell aren't American. Why did you come over here? Or did they drag you around?" They of course means the Sidereals.

"Ah. That explains a lot, but why did you buy the strip club," replies Xin, teasing back. "How about me? Well I left Hong Kong because I made some people very angry. Angry enough to want me out of the way. Heh, just after the big change. So since I had to get out of Hong Kong, I thought I'd come here. It's the last place I heard from my... from someone I cared about a great deal."

"Someone you cared about, hmm?" Jet is tactful enough not to pry, since Xin isn't spilling on his own. "Yeah, America is something of a drain. Sooner or later, everybody goes through here." She finally lets her eyes shut and leans back, "I bet if you asked one of them for help, they could help you find her. But then again, who knows? If it's important, though, you should probably give it a shot."

Xin nods, "Maybe. It's worth a shot. And I can think of worse people to try and find my sister with." Xin continues on. It's not the easiest thing in the world to talk about, but he gets the words out. "Hah, you know, when we were youunger, she told me stories about America. How everyone here was a cowboy or an indian. Now I know, that's just Texas."

"Heh, I'm from Texas," replies Jet. "Though I don't deny it. I would say more of a cowboy than an indian." She laughs a bit at the thought, "Naturally we don't really ride horses. A bike is just so much faster." She opens an eye and asks, "So you have any idea why she would have come to America?"

"A bike..." Xin has a grin on his face. "Those are fun. I was pretty good with one, rode one up a wall once... that was no easy thing to do. Nevermind the jumping off of it moments before it was supposed to explode." He chuckles, reveling in memory for a moment, then much more serious, "No. I don't. I don't know why she disappeared, or why she went where she did. She'd write to me, let me know she was alive, but, I could never get in touch with her."

"Well, with any luck, she's left something of a paper trail behind her," says Jet. "I bet with people like the Sidereals and Poe and Newton, you'll be able to get some good leads pretty quick." Jet seems genuinely confident. "Of course, once a girl gets a taste for the world, she'll probably never want to stop traveling."

"Maybe. I hope that's what it was." Xin says this plainly, "Some other time I'll tell you about what happened. It's a little much for one day though. I hope you can understand. Besides, it's your turn to talk, and I'm sure I'm eager to hear all about how you learned to dance. Or how you did any of the things you've done," says Xin. "At any rate, it's your turn to drive, and my turn to stop having to watch the road so much."
