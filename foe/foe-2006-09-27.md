It's now the middle of the night, and Jet has kept her promise, watching over Ana between precious, short moments of sleep. The Full Moon's hand is resting under Ana's cheek. Jet smiles warmly, careful not to move and awaken the girl. So very softly she whispers, "I promise I will take care of you."

Xin brings a couple of mugs that are microwave-warmed and full of liquid. Nothing so strong smelling that it'd wake up Ana, but, "It'll warm the body. I'm still chilled from the rain," he remarks, speaking very softly. He offers a cup to Jet. "You were serious. Going to watch her all night?"

Jet carefully moves a hand to take the mug. "Thank you. And yes, I will watch her. If she wakes up, and wants to talk, or just wants to know she's protected, she will feel better seeing my eyes open." The Full Moon looks thoughtfully at the young girl and sighs gently. "I don't know much about medicine. I see a lot of little cuts and bruises. I just hope there's no physical damage I can't see."

"I wouldn't know. Usually I'm the one with the bruises and internal injuries. I know a little about setting bones, though." Xin makes idle chatter for a moment, helping him to settle into the situation. "The trick will be getting her to go to the doctor tomorrow. She probably will want nothing to do with anyone. Except you." He regards Jet carefully, "There's something different about you. You changed. With her."

Jet's focus settles on the girl, and the Full Moon lets out a sigh. As she breathes in, her face changes subtly at first, then more obviously, her mouth and nose for a moment moving forward, fur covering her skin, then fading once more to human flesh. "I don't know if a doctor is necessary yet. It will be her choice, Xin." Jet looks up to Xin for just a moment, then back to Ana. "I don't know what has changed about me," she whispers faintly. "Something happened in that alley, though. Maybe even before it. I don't know."

Xin starts, though he's fast enough to catch his mug before it hits the ground. Thankfully nothing has spilled either. "How did you..." he manages, almost staring. Xin is nothing if not willing to believe in all manner of things though, especially with what he's seen and done in the past few months. "Perhaps it is not important. I guess... it seemed like something was dragging you forward."

"It was," replies Jet. "There are aspects of myself that know things, that guide me. I guess you haven't seen what I really am. I keep forgetting." She isn't apologizing, however. "Ana's scent is a bit off. Not surprising that she's got a little infection. I will have to watch it carefully, or the doctor will not be a matter of choice."

"No I guess I haven't," repeats Xin. "What are you?" He doesn't ask this in a horrified tone, more an inquisitive one. "You can smell infection? Amazing. I suppose we can pick up something for her at a pharmacy."

"I'm Chosen of Luna, the Silver Lady," replies Jet. "I am a shapechanger. Though you can't see it, I'm also clearly marked. Not even Poe can tell, it seems." The Lunar doesn't really understand why nobody can see the silver in her hair. "I think that being what I am has something to do with my building of this impromptu family. Or maybe it is a combination of what I can do now, and what I always desired before." She sighs and notes, "Isn't it weird that I feel comfortable telling this to someone I've only just met?"

"Kind of like a pack. I think everything we are now is a combination of what we desired before. It seems to me that all that stood in our way was the power to make the changes we wanted." Xin shrugs, "But that's how I see it." Xin agrees, "It's a little weird. Who knows, maybe I'm part of the pack now."

"You are different, but we are all the same, as well," says Jet. "Everyone has been swept up in things. Naomi, Michelle, and Amy lost their home because I was in their apartment. The boy Timothy lost his father to the cops when I was doing a drop. Becca was on the brink of a terrible choice. Now there is Ana. I don't know if I really believed in love before, Xin. Now I love so many people."

"Your mind, body, and soul have been expanded. I think it would be impossible for you to not love so many. It's like the smallest parts of who we are, the stuff we kept hidden inside because we were afraid to admit it existed, is now free to bask in the spotlight. Because that's a part of who we are." Xin settles in and watches Ana, "The soul grows so strong that there is no choice but to express it. If you believe in that kinda thing."

"I don't really know," answers Jet. "I prefer not to think too much about why anymore. At least not in my own actions. I just trust myself. I saw a hurt girl, and I.. I had to protect her, and I know I have to do something to make sure that others aren't hurt like she has been." The Full Moon lets her eyes drift shut for just a moment. "I have the power now to do what I really want, I guess."

"So what do you really want? You're the hardest one to figure out. Poe wants to bring the truth to everyone. As for Dr. Benford, I think he wants to save the world," says Xin, "How about you?"

"Oh, I don't know," answers Jet. "I just want to control my life, I guess. I don't have any one thing I want to do, really. Carve out my own little place and keep the people I care for close to me as long as they will it. There are a few scores I want to settle, though. It's nothing very noble, Xin."

The Solar almost mutters this to himself, "You can't escape your past." He lets a sigh escape, and says, "Arguing over what is and isn't noble is something to discuss another time. And preferably in other circumstances."

"I guess I don't really care if I'm noble," admits Jet. She says nothing about escaping the past. Her's is too dark to speak of in any detail. "I wish I could see what she is dreaming," the Full Moon says abruptly. "I have been praying to the Silver Lady that Ana won't have nightmares, but just rest and recover. I hope she can hear me and will spare this child for this night."

Xin nods. "Good." He is also glad to let the past stay in the past. As long as it can, anyway. "She seems so peaceful now. So safe. I think that's your doing. You and she are connected. I'm just glad I didn't frighten her off."

"You aren't nearly as scary as you seem to think," replies Jet. "There is a peace about you. You seem so comfortable in your skin that even in the worst situations you were not a threat to her." The Lunar takes another drink from her mug and notes, "That kind of peace of mind is impressive."

"Thank you. I think it comes from knowing myself," Xin holds back a laugh, "Not like that, I mean, I understand how the body works and how it conveys different things. I think that's one of the things I like about fighting with someone up close, hand to hand. It is so expressive, so personal. Moreso than words in some cases. Anyway, that's one of the things my old teachers would go on about. Find that calm center. I didn't just make up all that stuff I've been trying to get through Poe's head. Someone else did, thousands of years ago."

"Well, if anyone can learn something new like that, it would be Poe. And probably Newton, too," says Jet. She doesn't include herself in that, it seems. "I have a feeling we'll be getting enough chances to know lots of people with that fighting close and person, too. We haven't seen the last of those robot things."

"No. I don't think we have. I'd be disappointed if we had, I think." Xin shakes his head, "But that's me. I suspect you want this to be over with soon, so you can make things safe for the pack. Let me know what I can do. I'll help however I can."

"I don't know how to end it soon," replies Jet. "But if I think of something, I'll let you know. It's usually Newton and Poe that do the big thinking, though." The Full Moon confesses casually, "I am just a survivor. Puzzles like this are kind of outside my understanding."

"I know how you feel," says Xin. "Well, maybe we'll figure out a way to survive this with everyone intact. Anyway, we survived tonight. So did Ana. The sun's coming up soon." He looks off to the East, where it is in fact growing brighter, "You kept your promise to her, and now she gets to see another day, and another life. Maybe it's time I promised something to someone else for once." He looks down at the sleeping child, "I promise I'll keep you safe," he whispers.
