El Paso, Texas. Mid-December, 2007. The swirl of politics and corruption in America has gone nearly unnoticed with the infinitely more visceral realities the Exalted have faced. Even Mother Nature has stayed unexpectedly busy, for the tractor-trailer and Jack's Gemballa are stuck in town due to a freak snowstorm.

Jet has found herself more at home in Saint Death's cave on the Mexican side of the border recently. And it is there that she dreams.

---

In a desolate and frozen waste, Jet is dressed in furs and carries a sharp, if crude, knife cut from obsidian. She is wild and feral. By day, her friends are members of her fellow-tribe, and the tribes in the next valley keep their peace. But at night, her comrades - the other Solars, the Houston girls, Ana, Becca, Timothy, and other faces she recognizes - become werewolves. They bay at the moon and mindlessly hunt, and Jet is the only human left. She barricades herself inside her cave, and on those nights where one breaks in, she's left to slaughter the beast. Come morning she mourns the death of another friend, while the tribe grows more and more suspicious that she is complicit in its murder.

At length, the dream changes, for the tribe has become aware of a savage tiger roaming the ice-covered valley and form a hunting party. Only Jet does not go, and come nightfall, only Jet is left of her little tribe. And the tiger comes for her at last, its claws raking across her chest...

---

Jet wakes abruptly. A few seconds suffice for her to orient herself. It is the cave, and the temperature is improving. She feels a sharp pain as she begins to move. With her left hand she feels about, noticing that her shirt is torn in shreds. She can feel the sensation of dried blood beneath, and the skin is still tender to the touch. Even with her Exalted healing ability, she recognizes that she's been raked at by claws.

It takes her a few moments more to discover the origin of the attack, so much like her dream. Her right hand has grown hairy and muscular, with more pronounced knuckles. And at the end of each fingertip, animalistic claws have extruded from her fingertips to join with the fingernail.

The tips of the claws show the faint red marks of blood. There can be no mistake as to how Jet injured herself. But how did this happen?

Jet holds the hand up in front of her face, flexing it slowly. The fist she makes is awkward and inhuman. She bends her mind as she always has in the past, trying to reform her flesh as it should be, as it must be. But where before things simply happened, now nothing happens, and she cannot restore herself. "I am not the tiger," she murmurs quietly. "But the tiger is me." Without bothering to look around she rises and leaves the cave.

Whatever the hour, Jet wanders restlessly. She roves the rocky crags until she is exhausted. Only when the sun has long risen in the sky does she find her way to the others and there she throws herself down by the truck, staring at that hated hand that is no longer her own.

After a few minutes of staring at this problem, Jet rises and looks around, sniffing at the air. Her eyes catch Benford standing some ways away, staring into the sun. She considers for a moment, then stuffs the paw into her pocket and heads his way. "Didn't anyone ever warn you about staring right at the sun?"

"Strange thing," Benford replies. "It doesn't burn like you'd think." He turns to face Jet. "Still. I find myself preferring sunset." He extends a thermos bottle. "Coffee?"

"No thanks," answers Jet. She looks for a moment at the sun, then turns away. She asks instead, "You have something strong to drink? An irish coffee might go down okay right now." Even for her, that's an unusual request this time of day.

Benford raises an eyebrow, and pulls out a hip flask. "Single-malt whiskey. A gift from my father, last time I went home. Normally I'd make a cute comment about how it's a tad strong for a nice lady like you, but you don't seem to be in the mood." He hands over the flask. "What's wrong, Jet?"

Jet reaches out to take the flask with her good hand and says, "Nothing that even oblivion can chase away." She takes a good swig and lids her eyes a moment. Finally she holds out her 'paw' for Benford to see. "I can't change it. Something is wrong with me."

Benford examines Jet's hand closely. "Odd morphology... human and feline kinesics really aren't that miscible..." He notices the red stains on the claws. "Oh, Jet. Whose blood is this?"

"Don't worry, nobody was hurt." _At least nobody who didn't have it coming._ she thinks grimly. "I have a feeling that there's nothing that anyone else can do about this one, Benford. I wonder if this means that I'll be nothing but a tiger eventually."

Benford leads Jet over by the fire - a needless conceit, since the semi has a full galley, but a humanizing one during the lengthening nights. "Well, now. I think that eventually you'll only be yourself, just as you always have. Wait here. I need something from the trailer."

Jet watches Benford retreat. Beside her, hunched down on her legs, foreclaws digging into the soil, is the beastwoman who has touched some of Jet's more pleasant dreams, her inner avatar. The creature rumbles briefly and stares at Jet, then lopes off toward the trailer in an animalistic gait.

Benford returns with an olive-drab bag, from which he pulls a variety of instruments, some familiar, like a stethoscope, and some less so, resembling slide-rules with quartz lenses. "You need to spend Essence to shape-change. It's obvious that this isn't a natural affliction; so it's reasonable to assume that an extraordinary use of Essence is invovled. You aren't feeling a quart low, are you?"

Jet looks after that other her warily. Benford's appearance comes after she's already taken three steps after the beastwoman, and she comes to a halt. "One minute," she says quickly, racing after the beastwoman with a soft growl. She's not sure she can catch that other her right now, but she will at least try.

Benford drops his bag and pursues. "Or we can do this," he mumbles.

Jet follows her avatar away from the trailer, toward the caves. Every so often she glances over her shoulder, measuring Jet and Benford's pursuit. In particular, Jet sees her keeping track of the scientist behind her. Perhaps he's important to the creature. They reach the caves, and Jet finds herself nearing a strange cave. The bestial figure waits within, beckoning.

Jet looks back to Benford, "I'm chasing something. It.. was me before, I think. I don't know. It doesn't matter." She doesn't want to waste time trying to explain farther. She forges on, moving into the cave without a second thought.

Benford stumbles after Jet, not so much winded as confused. "More imaginary friends? Oh, well. They've been friendly so far..." He follows Jet into the cave, depending on her instinct to navigate in darkness.

By coincidence or connection, Jet finds her other self standing near the back wall of the cave, next to Lao Xin. The Chinaman is kneeling in a calm, relaxed posture and breathing, doing nothing else. The beastwoman squats down next to him. "We learn today," she says, in a rough voice. "Answer the wise man's questions. If you do not know, I'll speak for you."

Standing beside Benford, the traveler Selber lays a hand on the physicist's shoulder. "Looks like we're in for a little study today," he says. "Maybe this is all magic, but even magic follows rules."

"I will," replies Jet quietly. "Though I'm beginning to think I have only the wrong answers." She moves closer to Xin and sits by him, doing her best to copy his posture. "What would you ask of me?"

Benford folds his legs beneath him, watching both Xin and Jet for the moment. _Hypatia, if you didn't notice, Selber is in attendence. If you'd care to attend we can complete the quorom._

_I am here,_ the woman's voice answers. _If you need me, ask._

"First I would ask some answers," says Xin, sounding rather relaxed, "Why has your hand changed?" The Chinaman does not shift from his meditative posture, though his eyes are open now, and have swept across the cave. He doesn't focus on any one thing for too long, and in doing so, takes in everything.

"I don't know. I had a nightmare last night. I've had many nightmares before," answers Jet. "This time, I hurt myself and now I'm.. broken."

Benford sidles forward, taking Jet's paw again. "How is it that nightmares now can hurt us? Is it the nightmare, or is it ourselves?"

"Hmm." Xin makes only the slightest of movements to turn his head towards Jet, "If the nightmare is from within, then perhaps the self and the dream are one and the same. Jet, will you do something for me, while Doctor Benford is taking a look? Close your eyes and breathe. Focus your attention down here, on your _tan tien_." He places his hand just below his navel, indicating where he means. "As thoughts occur to you, acknowledge them, and then let them pass. Do not dwell on them. If nothing else, it should help you calm down."

Jet arches an eyebrow at Xin. "My wha?" She looks down to where he indicates and frowns. This sounds like snake oil to her, really. Still, she will at least pretend to cooperate. "Okay, so.. just.. breathe." She shuts her eyes, then mutters, "Whatever thoughts.. just acknowledge them." Mostly she's thinking this is absurd and hoping Benford might figure something out as he examines her.. hand.

"'This is a joke, and I trust the doctor more than the fighter'," the beastwoman growls at Jet. "Say it."

Benford carefully examines the hair on Jet's arm. Near the elbow, they're still human; on the back of her hand, they're definitely feline. Each hair is distinctly human or tiger, but the distribution changes. The integration of woman and beast is perfect, as if frozen midway through the change. _But it's always been binary before... one way or the other... and it takes Essence... so maybe it's an incomplete effect?_ "Jet, you can't change it back... but can you go forward? Change a little further?"

Benford murmurs to both Selber and Hypatia, "Watch this. I'm not sure what Essence looks like... if it looks like anything... but perhaps the Engine will notice."

Jet looks back at her other self and frowns. "I will answer as I wish." She turns her mind to shifting, to being the tiger, and her flesh moulds itself swiftly, knees sliding, reversing, her arms thickening into the powerful limbs of a tiger, and in a very short time Benford is meeting the bright, confident eyes of a tigress.

Xin watches Jet transform, the way her muscles shift and her flesh changes. He watches the air around her and the ground beneath her feet, noting what happens to her environs as well as her, trying to feel what her change means.

Benford plops down on the floor of the cave, scratching tiger-Jet between the years absently like an oversized housecat. "Fascinating. Quite fascinating. I don't think this is any kind of affliction or curse. I think this is something that Jet 'wants', in some sense. You might not have been so far off," he mentions to the tigress.

"Maybe broken isn't the right word," says Xin. "But there was something different. Maybe when she changes back it's gone?"

Jet turns to settle herself in front of Xin. The eyes of the great tiger rest on his and she lets out a deep, bass rumble as her ears are scratched. She naturally can say nothing that Benford or Xin might hear, but she directs her mind to speak to the beastwoman. "What is broken within me? Why does the tiger try to destroy the human within me?"

"It is the human that tries to destroy the tiger," the feral woman answers, hissing angrily. "Do you not see this? The tiger is fighting to live."

Benford shakes his head. "Probably not, I'm afraid. However, there's no reason to rush, as long as she's confortable. But let this be a lesson to all of us. Extraordinary power opens us up to extraordinary means of harming ourselves." _Have we seen this before, old man?_

"I do not see it," answers Jet. "I am me. Or am I no longer myself? The tiger is alive now, and it tells me nothing of what it wants. I have only myself, and there is no comfort there."

"True. Maybe equally extraordinary ways of repairing the harm, or growing." Xin asks the Doctor, "What do you think is going on? Any guesses?"

The beastwoman lunges forward, grabbing hold of Jet and forcing her to her feet; in the process, Jet feels her body reverting to its human guise. The feral woman takes hold of Jet's right hand - still atavistic, still clawed - and thrusts it against the cave wall. A loud scratching follows as the hand begins to jerkily trace out pictures. They have the crudity of cave paintings drawn by aboriginal mankind from millennia past, but their meaning is clear. Over the next few minutes, Xin and Benford watch a story unfold on the wall of the cave.

There is a feminine figure - clearly Jet herself - standing next to a man, being cradled in his arms. The figure is drawn again, weeping tears that fall to form the wavy line of a symbolic river.

As the shapes on the wall take form in reality, so two they are echoed in Jet's mind. It begins in a whisper but grows steadily louder. "On the day, I knew that I was killing myself." The claw turns inward, shattering the flesh of her palm to draw out the blood she will need to paint. "It reminded me of every step I have taken, and all that I have destroyed to survive. Those I have forsaken and whose trust I have betrayed."

"And I realized that of all the people I have hurt and wronged, it was me--myself--that had been hurt most often," she explains. "On that day I destroyed what was left inside me for vengeance, for justice. I thought there was enough of me left, but I find that I killed everything." Jet's eyes lid slowly and she sighs gently. "I learned how weak I really am. Not just physically, but mentally. I learned that I have nothing inside. Nothing to believe in, nothing to hope for, yet I am not empty."

Jet asks at last, "How is it that I am not dead? How much can one survive without learning anything?"

"Denial," Benford says simply. "One can assume that one understands the whole world, as long as one never encounters a contradictory fact. The real question is, in the face of the truth, will one persist in denial, or will one change and grow?"

Benford says, "To put a point on it, my dear, I think we've all been given the opportunity to be better people. Yourself included. But perhaps you're not ready. You still cling to violence, and perhaps the belief that the world is woven of pain." He steeples his hands, tapping his chin against the tip. "It can be extremely comfortable to believe that one understands the world, even if that belief implies that life isn't worth living. To abandon that belief implies an admission of ignorance. Many people would rather suffer." The scientist grins wryly. "I should know."

"You kill the tiger when you do not live with nature," the beastwoman says quietly, whispering in Jet's ear. "No more lies. No more hiding. Be who you are."

"But I don't know who I am," admits Jet. She tries to recall the last time she felt interested in what she actually thought or felt about anything. She doesn't share those results. "How can I ever find the time to learn now?"

"You could start by listening to yourself," says Xin. "You can't force yourself to learn. Force is followed by the loss of strength. You can, however, let yourself learn."

Benford shrugs. "She's got some decisions to make. I don't know what they are, and it would be arrogant of me to guess. Some lines even I won't cross. But..." his voice softens. "I offer my assistance. We're all in this together."

"I don't know how much help I can be in what we must do next," admits Jet. "Until I actually figure this out, I think anything further might destroy me completely. There are so many things I want to do, and I have others who need me now. I cannot fail them."

"Then don't fail them," replies Xin. He stands up, slowly. "You say you are not empty, but maybe that's what you need. You are too forceful. You must learn to yield, and then to overcome."

Xin continues, walking slowly towards one of the cavern alls. "The world is filled with all kinds of things, everything trying to push and pull in every direction all at once. Water is a good means of seeing this in action, it fills what it is put in, and flows with forces, yet it is never broken, never overcome. The stiff and the unbending, however resist things as long as they can, and eventually... they must break." Xin exhales sharply and in a flash, his hand has curled into a fist that slams against the rocky wall. Little more than a layer of dust is disturbed... at least at first. When he draws his hand away, there is a little crack from the force of the blow. "Old legends tell of masters tearing down walls with their bare hands... it's believable. But can anyone tear down water?"

Jet looks thoughtful, if a bit confused. "I'm not sure I understand what that actually means to me." She looks down at the twisted hand. "I don't know if that's enough to make this go away. I have so much to do to get right again."

Benford says, "Why do you think you're getting it wrong?"

Xin chuckles, "You can't make it go away. That's what I'm saying. The more you try the worse it'll get. It's as though all these things you're forcing are coming up through you again. Let them pass. Accept it, overcome it."

"Because I'm miserable. I don't sleep at night. I can't even keep part of me from destroying the other part of me," Jet replies. She looks back to Xin, "That doesn't make sense to me. This isn't something I can just ignore."

Xin shakes his head, "I'm sorry, I'm not telling this right. I don't mean you should ignore it. You should try and listen to it... that doesn't really make sense does it? It's like there's a part of you that you are pushing against, perhaps have pushed against for all your life, and now it is pushing back. And you can either try and resist the push as best as you can, or, you can yield to it, and direct the push yourself. Hmmm. Maybe this would work better if I showed you what I meant. Here, Doctor Benford, would you be willing to help out?"

"It might not help that you're sleeping in Death's cavern," Benford mentions as he gets to his feet. "Perhaps there is something to be learned from her... but I suspect for you it will be a negative example. A warning." He strides over to Xin. "Be gentle with me," he smirks.

"Now, hold your hands out like so," Xin holds his hands out in front of him, a little loosely. His fingers are held together, "And then when I push against you, push back against me as hard as you can."

Xin plants his feet sturdily on the ground and leans in, pushing against Benford. At first there's very little force applied, and Benford pushes Xin's hands back steadily. "You can keep something repressed, for a while, as the good Doctor is doing now. But..." Slowly the Chinaman applies more and more force, and the Doctor is pushed backwards, unbalanced from the new force brought to bear, until he's forced to step back or fall. "It unbalances you. Leaves you weaker. But now... watch what happens when you yield to the force..." Xin steps back to where he was before, and gestures for Benford to do the same. "Be gentle with me," he says, grinning.

Again Benford presses Xin's arms back, and this time as Xin pushes back harder, he says, "Now yield, keep your hands against mine, but don't resist." The result is that this time Xin is knocked off balance, having overextended himself in trying to push against Benford. He nearly falls against the doctor.

Xin stands up, and gestures towards Jet, "It's not so different internally. The physical and the mental, even the spiritual, are all different ways of expressing the same idea. Or something like that. Does that make better sense?"

Jet looks at Benford and Xin, "I suppose it does, but I have to find out what it really means for me." The Lunar looks towards the beast woman. "It's confusing with so many voices. I need time to pick out my own. I need a time when I won't have to do so many things in so little time."

"Bad week for that, unfortunately," Benford mutters. "I wonder if there's anything we can do under pressure."

Xin hmms, "Maybe having a lot to do is the perfect excuse to start changing things, Jet. It gives you something to focus all your conscious effort on... all we'll have to do is direct your unconscious effort."

Benford taps the cavern wall. "Let's address the physical symptoms for a moment. We know that Jet's Shapechange needs Essence. We know that her hand has shapechanged without the rest of her. Therefore, some Essence must have been involved, and it didn't come from her. Whatever personal issues we're dealing with, there's a supernatural threat. Something taking advantage of her temporary weakness. A 'curse', as it were. Where did that come from?" _Any opinions, you fellows?_

"Hmm. That is a good point, Doctor. Maybe we can see if there's a trace of Essence... or anything like that around where she shapechanged," asks Xin.

"Define 'her' for me," Selber offers to Benford. "Jet the woman from Texas? Jet the Siberian tiger? Jet the Lunar Exalt? Or the ur-Jet, the sum total of all her existence? You speak to me, but I'm really just a part of a larger you, for example."

Benford says, "I wonder if it's the tiger, then. You killed it. I'm sure you needed to do so, but... the tiger may not be so sanguine."

"I am the tiger," replies Jet evenly. Of that, she is certain. "It called to me. It demanded it of me, and I do not regret that change. It made me complete. It is as much a part of me as the woman, yet I fight against it, I twist it."

Benford says, "But why the tiger, specifically? It suits you, I think... sybaritic, affectionate even, especially to family; but a crafty hunter, a killer when necessary... and sometimes even when it isn't." He sighs. "I need to go get my notes. Stay here, or come back with me, whichever, but I'm most useful with phenomena I can count and measure."

"We might as well walk a bit," says Jet. "Where I am hardly matters right now. And it was not a concious choice. It pulled at me. I only knew I had to be somewhere, and when I arrived, the chance presented itself. Having a tiger get out of its cage is a very odd occurance, don't you think? It just happened to occur when I was wandering."

Benford sighs. "'More things in heaven and earth than you can swing a cat at,' my mother would say. You'd like her, Jet. I hope you get to meet her some time." He starts back to the trailer.

"I wonder if any of the others know anything about this," murmurs Jet. "Heh, I don't know if I'm the girl that you introduce to your parents, exactly. I'm not precisely housebroken yet." She sighs softly at the joke, "And I'm supposed to be a parent myself. Before I can do anything good for anyone I need to be whole again."

Benford, Jet and Xin return to the trailer. The Russian woman, Mirya, is waiting. In halting Russian, Jet answers her casual question about her changed hand. The response is surprising, if Jet understands correctly. "The tattoos. You cannot be changed by anything but yourself, if you have the tattoos."

Benford retrieves his bag of instruments. "So where is the Essence coming from? She's not burning any herself, and yet her hand is changed - perpetually changed, even. Are her tattoos damaged?" He finds an instrument that looks like a jeweler's loupe, and asks to see Jet's 'paw' again. "Is that even possible?"

Through her protege in Russian, Mirya answers the scientist's questions. Some of the conversation is done through pantomime, gesture, and guesswork. "The tattoos could be removed. But only by one of my kind, the No Moons. They cannot be 'damaged'. You could use magic, maybe, but nobody's done this."

At this point, Morgan comes out of the trailer holding a cup of coffee. It doesn't take him long to take in the serious expressions of the group of Exalts clustered around the trailer, or the animated conversation. "Uh... good morning," he says, in subdued tones. "Something's wrong...?" he asks, looking at Jet's transformed arm.

Jet seems particularly unhappy that Morgan sees her hand. She doesn't bother hiding it now, though. The cat, as it were, is out of the bag already. "I woke up and it was like this." She doesn't mention the wounds that went with it. "It seems it's my own doing, though I don't know how. I certainly don't want it this way."

Benford brings Morgan up to speed. "She's not short any Essence, and yet it takes Essence to change. Her tattoos are intact, and I'm told that she can only change with an act of will as long as that's true. And she can still change; she did so less than an hour ago. It's like one hand isn't changing completely back from the tigress."

Morgan nods. "All right. Well... have you noticed that when you really put your all into something, you feel a little... refreshed? What if that process could be triggered subconsciously? Like in dreams... or nightmares." He glances at Jet briefly, before continuing. "It takes an act of will to transform, I'm sure, but I don't think it's written down anywhere that it has to be a _conscious_ act of will."

Benford says, "You're saying that she sucked it in from the environment as part of a bad dream?"

"But if it takes an act of will, why can't I reverse it now?" asks Jet. She turns her mind to her hand, trying to feel in some way just what it is. Not physically, but through the essence that courses through her. "I wonder if it is all in my head afterall."

"Is that impossible?" asks Morgan. "I think there's a lot we don't know yet about our powers..." He glances at Jet again. "What's in your head is _real_, in your head. What makes us _ourselves_ is much more than our conscious existence - at least that's what they said in Psych 101. And in our case, where our powers can turn our will into observable effects..."

Benford says, "Well, we've considered the possibility that she's doing this to herself, so... wait a minute. Jet, do you have any imaginary friends?"

"Imaginary friends?" asks Jet. "I have something of an avatar. Someone who was me before. At least I guess that is what they are. A woman who is more beast than anything else. At least physically. I don't think she can actually do that to me, though."

Benford says, "No, but... she's a superset of you. The rest of us have avatars of similar purpose. Some of us also have Engines, with their associated personalities. Does that hand look like hers?"

"I don't think so. She's different," answers Jet. "I don't think she's trying to make me be like her. She wants me to be myself. At least that is what I understand." Jet is growing more uncomfortable and more uncertain with each moment.

Morgan shakes his head. "Well, if my guess about nightmares is correct..." He turns to Jet, his voice gentle. "Does the hand look like something out of your nightmares?"

Xin nods, "So we don't know what it is. For all we know the stress of this nightmare induced some kind of change you didn't know you were capable of, or whatever. Hm."

Jet shakes her head again. "It's like nothing else, really. It doesn't have any direct relationship with anything. It doesn't make any sense at all." She sighs quietly, "It's a mix. I've never been part one and part the other before. It's confusing."

Benford says, "On the contrary, perhaps you've always been part one and part the other. Not physically, perhaps, but you're a complicated person, Jet."

"Isn't everyone pretty complicated?" asks Jet. "I've only done what I need to survive I never had a place of my own that was worth a damn until we all met at the headquarters. Now I guess I have no home again."

"They say home is where the heart is, kinda makes you wonder where yours is," says Xin. "I can try and teach you a few things, maybe they can help you out. If not with your hand, then maybe just in general."

Morgan shakes his head and steps over to Jet, taking her hands - both her hands, the human and the bestial. "No, Jet. As far as _I'm_ concerned, you'll always have a home with me - with us. No matter what you've become. If you have a problem..." he says, giving Jet's clawed hand a gentle squeeze, "we'll all help you resolve it. Together."

Benford says nothing, but he wipes a tear from the corner of an eye when he thinks nobody is watching.

Jet hesitates for a moment. The tiger in her is a bit shy about this. It's one thing to show her body off to strangers, another to show her real feelings. The moment passes and she rises to look into Morgan's eyes. "I think the first thing I have to do is come home." She wraps her arms around him and hugs tightly. Her eyes drift shut and for now, the claws don't matter. She whispers quietly, "It's good to be home."
