Everyone heads back to the Long Haul, with a brief stop in Oakland to pick up Xin. The staff of the alternative press outlet seems to have conceded to a temporary occupation by the Exalts. Jet, Benford, Poe, and Xin, under the amused eye of Lexi, mull over what they've learned. Benford produces a thick folder of case notes from his brief case. "From Schroeder," he says simply. "Lots of detail but unfortunately nothing that identifies a perpetrator or even a motive. We need ideas."

Benford says, "Unfortunately, it seems our best lead is the missing Doctor Roozrokh. We know there's someone invovled who has both surgical skill and an ethics problem. We can start with him. Even if it's someone else we might discover other candidates."

Morgan chews his lip. "Step one of making elephant stew: catch an elephant. The good doctor is missing, 'presumed dead'" - Poe resists the urge to make the finger quotes in the air, but they are audible nonetheless - "and the police either don't know what happened to him or are suffering from money-induced amnesia. Or some combination thereof." He cracks his knuckles. "Which does _not_ mean that we can't find him. A needle in a haystack's still easier to find than a particular wisp of hay."

Benford says, "Then, do you think we should start with the police that... misplaced him?"

"Sounds like a good place to start. Hmm, and if they're keeping the good doctor alive, and want to keep him busy, it might be worth looking into any sorts of medical equipment going missing these days..." adds Xin, "Or do we think They can make their own?"

"You can't make bricks without straw," says Morgan, "or in this case, surgical steel without machine tools and iron. Of course, that'd be easier to hide, but..." Poe trails off. "Hang on. Speaking of hiding... how come we were even able to find the bodies at all? How hard would it be to make a crematorium, do you think? Or for that matter, if you can get the bodies to dumpsters around town without being seen, how much harder is it to get to the harbor?"

Benford thumbs through the pile of files and withdraws Roozrokh's, and hands it over to Poe.

Benford says, "I guess it depends on how much equipment they'd need. If this was a proper transplant operation, it might involve respirators, anaesthetizers, haemotology gear, the works... what I fear is that they could do it in the back of an ambulance, the site of the murder is virtually untracable." He drums his fingers. "We should mull this over while we're checking out the police."

Morgan nods. "While we're on our way, we need to think about how to _make_ the police talk to us. Lexi already found out they won't respond well to just asking nicely."

"We could try and make them think that not talking to us will mean trouble for them," suggests Xin, "Maybe get them to think we're important in some 'Official' capacity."

"They aren't likely to talk to a reporter. If we had some time, we could use a bit of finesse to get the information," muses Jet. "I bet they'd talk quite openly to another officer."

Benford raises an eyebrow. "Well, then... Lexi, what do you think is the ideal method for manipulating a police officer?"

Lexi, who has been thumbing through a copy of an old Marvel comic book called "Weird World", looks up. "The ideal method in L.A. is out of my price range," she answers glumly.

Benford sighs. "Graft and corruption. Intolerable and inevitable," he grumbles.

Xin comments, "Yes, but perhaps useful to us in the circumstances."

"So we'll have to deal with the second best. Looks like it's time for Eddie Smith, Department of Internal Affairs, to take the stage again," says Morgan. "Only _this_ time I'll have to mean it."

"I prefer to avoid bribery," says Jet suddenly. "It occurs to me that once we take advantage of that weakness, we lose our own credibility as well." She looks at Morgan curiously, "You better not get yourself in too much trouble, Poe."

Benford says, "We'll be there to bail him out. Let's just avoid becoming the news instead of reporting it."

"Yeah, I prefer not to do my work inside police stations. It's really bad luck t.. to hurt an officer of the law, too," suggests Jet. It's fairly clear she was going to say something rather more harsh than that. Jet is not known for stopping at 'hurting' those who threaten her friends.

Benford says, "Alright. Get to it. I'm going to go over these files again. Lexi, I'm sure you'd like to see these, but when you write your next story, you didn't see them, okay?"

Unfortuantely, the police reports are extremely vague, and conflicting. It's not even clear which jail Roozrokh was in when he disappeared, or if he was even in a jail cell.

Morgan scratches his head, leafing through the records. "Damn. This many possible leads, I could be days just _finding_ a prison he was actually at..." He pauses, then clenches a fist. "This is too mixed up to be just a few cases of bribery here and there. I bet someone's been tampering with the records directly." He turns to Benford, with a wry grin and a wink. "Want to hack into a state prison records system?"

Benford raises an eyebrow. "What kind of access point you want to use? The red pill version or the blue pill version?"

Morgan blinks. "Good point," he says, staring at the ceiling in thought. "I... think we may actually want the red pill. If our guess is correct, that's the way our man probably got in in the first place."

Benford says, "Then we should limit the number of people involved. Just the four of us, I should think, and I have an idea where we can find an open access point."

Jet listens to this and looks to Lexi, considering. "We're dragging her farther than she knows into something far messier than she probably expects," says the Lunar quietly. "We either put her somewhere safe, or we take her through the looking glass."

Benford says, "Then I think Lexi has a decision to make."

Lexi, for her part, is busy giggling quietly at her comic book.

Benford taps out an SMS on one of the magic phones. _Klein, we need an access point near Berkeley, CA. Advice?_

_Two minutes pass before Benford receives a series of messages in reply. "All access points the same. Find one that suits you. If you need anything else, speak up. Otherwise I sleep again."_

_Benford stuffs the phone back in his pocket. "Cryptic, as ever. Guess we should do some warwalking."_

_Xin makes conversation during the search for a suitable access point, "Warwalking? Don't think I get the reference."_

_Benford says, "It's a long story. We're going looking for access points on foot, that's the important thing." He sketches a map of Berkeley on scrap paper. "Here are some likely places to try. We've got three units, so we'll divide it up three ways. Phone if you find one."_

The first access point that the group can think of is Infrared - the nightclub where Xin accessed the Lands of Light. This time, they consider themselves relatively safe. Anyone with a good line of bull (or a pair of wires bent into the magic shape of the God of Lockpicking's runic name) can get into the club. Morgan will make the access, while Jet will protect him should the Assembled appear.

As Morgan settles into a comfortable position behind the server racks, he flips through the pages of the confused and tangled police records of Dr. Roozrokh's brief tenure in police custody, as well as the dossier on the transplant doctor himself, and the public record of his indictment, refreshing them in his memory as clearly as he can manage. Finally, he is ready. _Eddie, take me in,_ signals Morgan, at last, forming the image of Dr. Roozrokh's mug shot in his mind.

The mugshot forms the primary focus of the scene Morgan gradually transitions into. It begins from the photo and radiates outward, overwriting the image of the club's incongruous computing racks with a stylized representation of a police line-up. There's a camera flash, and Morgan can see the doctor moving. Glittering trails of text and numbers move in precise angular formations toward and away from him - it's as though he rests at the center of a spiderweb of information.

The web tangles its way through a geometrically perfect police station, which becomes visible to Morgan. It's exactly the sort of station he'd associate with the LAPD. And the filaments of webbing tie its filing cabinets and its occupants together into a moving digital entity.

Morgan sees a wave of data splash outward from Dr. Roozrokh reflected back from the camera flash, recognizes it as the mug shot being recorded in the data banks. He follows the doctor, but as he does so, he focuses on the realization that the 'doctor' he is following is not the person. Instead, what he is following is the data trail of the booking and custody process.

As Morgan learned it in journalism school, when an inmate is processed, whenever they are moved from one prison to another, or one cell to another, or out of a cell to a courtroom, the guards note these transfers in a log book - number of inmate, time, direction of transit. In the case of the LAPD's system, this is all done electronically - which means that that custody discipline is represented _here_, in the Lands of Light.

And so, the doctor 'moves' through the booking process, and his fingerprints fly from the electronic fingerprint pad and spiral into the police station filing cabinets, and Morgan follows, watching, waiting for the moment when the doctor's trail first begins to be obscured. Watching for the clues that will, hopefully, give him some idea of how Dr. Roozrokh's trail was covered, and to nail down, as far as he possibly can, where Dr. Roozrokh actually was, or seemed to be, within the system when his trail finally disappeared for good.

Morgan follows the path as best he can. He is fortunate to be aware of the representational nature of the system he occupies. Still, the shock of the experience is its very blatancy. During a prison transfer, he sees half a dozen black-clad men, each exactly identical to the others, assault the escorting officers. They take charge of the doctor and begin to hustle him away. Morgan sees their destination. Seeping through the cracks of the prison is a thickly billowing white mist. The doctor and his 'escorts' vanish into the mist.

_A prison data break_, thinks Morgan to himself, wide-eyed. It takes him a moment to reinterpret what happened, to understand the metaphor in physical terms. The 'escorting officers' represented the LAPD system's security systems, its access controls and its audit logs - though the black-clad men could still have been literal Assembled. And what happened just now at this moment was just the erasure of the doctor's record in the system, not his actual physical jailbreak - although surely the physical jailbreak had happened around the same time.

/No wonder they gave Lexi the runaround,/ adds Morgan. /They couldn't admit something like this could happen to them. Hell, they probably still don't **understand** what happened./ He peers into the mist, shaking his head. /Not much hope of this, but I have to try at least,/ he says, as he attempts to follow the doctor and his abductors/rescuers into the mist.

Here, in a place that makes no sense at all, Jet sits surrounded by the hum of machines. She can smell the burning dust off a power supply, she can feel the rhythm of the many fans. She can even sense when the machines are working harder as the air shifts about her. The Lunar notices these things without trying, her mind just floating, waiting for sign of a change.

The noise of the night club itself is largely shut out here, but Jet can feel the thump of music in the floor she sits on. Not knowing what to expect, she naturally assumed the worst. Under her coat she's armed and prepared for war. Yet she sits calmly, her breathing slow and even, so that the noises of her own body disappear into the background, leaving her free to maintain an awareness of everything else.

_Charity._ The voice is soft, and internal, and familiar.

Jet's response is immediate, but not loud. Her response like a ripple on a lake. "Yes?" She is not afraid. The Lunar is merely curious and expectant.

_Charity._ The voice calls again, beckoning. Jet can now place it to a particular direction. There's a presence outside the door of the server room. Jet can see the barest hints of a shadow - two human feet standing outside - and hear the faint sounds of the random shuffling motions of a person waiting.

"Who are you?" asks Charity softly. She didn't tell anyone she would be here, and therefore there are only a few possibilities, none of them very encouraging. Due to recent experiences, she can only assume the more unpleasant posibilities are more likely.

Jet doesn't wait for an answer, but rises smoothly. She carefully studies the feet on the floor. They give away a position. She thinks to herself with amusement, 'If it were a friend, they'd know walking in on me is unwise. If it's not a friend I don't mind if I break every bone in its body.' She will wait behind the door waiting for it to open a crack before she leaps into a roll, gun drawn and raised to give whoever is pushing their way inside a big surprise.

Jet's acrobatics would take any mortal by surprise. She finds her gun shoved right up the nose of a young man dressed in biker's leathers. His face is entirely expressionless, but his smell overwhelms Jet. And in a moment she recognizes someone who ought to be dead. The memory of his bloodied face has been seared into her mind, for it lies next to that of dead Elizabeth Ivanova's. It is Snake.

Jet pulls the trigger instantly. There's no hesitation. She knows that face and hates it intensely. While others might find the mystery of a man back from the dead interesting, Jet considers it a rare opportunity to avenge herself one more time.

The round goes off, no louder than a man kicking a half-empty jug of soda across the room. As expected, the young man's skull explodes upward. Brains and blood smear themselves above the open doorway. The body, bereft of its guiding impulses, falls backward with a dull thud.

Jet makes sure the body is indeed dead, then peeks out, making sure that didn't draw unnecessary attention. She will drag the body into the room and stuff it in a corner. She wants to have it where she can keep an eye on it. The mess that lies outside the room can't be helped much. The best Jet can do is disable the lighting. This being done, she will resume her guard duty. She looks to the corpse and commands lazily, "This time, stay dead."

To Jet's surprise and horror, the body begins to stir in its concealed resting place. The motion is only momentary, but it is most definitely inhuman.

"That's what I thought," murmurs the Lunar. She rises once more, and decides there is only one appropriate reponse. "Poe's gonna really be upset over the stink," she grumbles. The Lunar will set to the task of immobilizing the stubborn thing by binding it with a few of the spare cables lying about.

The act of binding the body is enough for Jet to reveal its secret. Under the flesh and muscle, she feels wires and metal struts. The brain is fleshy, organic, and missing a large chunk of itself, but it shows the signs of wiring. It's as though someone built a puppet out of human flesh.

"Filthy, rotten bastards," growls the Lunar. She gives up on the binding and proceeds to stomp, kick, and bash the living hell out of the mockery in front of her. She spares the time to nudge Poe, hoping to get him out of whatever it is he's doing. "They are onto us! Whatever you have done, it had better be enough!" It's simply impossible that this is coincidence. An attacker with that face? They know she's here.

Jet's beating abates. Once again she hears the voice. And this time she recognizes it, for there's nobody else who would come here with 'Snake'. It is the voices of Natasha and Elizabeth Ivanova speaking in unison. "Charity," they say together. And Jet knows, somehow, that they are in the room with her. She sees and smells nothing. But they are present.

Jet growls softly. She knows this is wrong. "I know who you sound like," she says flatly, "But I want to know who sent you. What are you?" She is wary, expecting attack at any second.

The sensation is familiar. Jet has felt it before - the Essence of Hypatia leaving Benford and entering her. The Essence of that symbiote leaving her and returning to him. She feels it now, in the room. It is the source of the voice. It's within her reach.

Jet considers for only a moment, then reaches out to seize what is offered. She lost them once before, she will not let it happen again.

A wash of white light and a powerful tingling rushes through Jet's body. She feels the voice 'separate', becoming two people. She feels warmth, and love, and worry. And she hears the sisters speak to her. "At last.." they whisper, tenderly.

Morgan has followed the captured - or rescued - doctor through the mists. He watches himself navigate the Los Angeles map in abstract, winding up in what looks to be a gleaming, antiseptic surgery. The room is well-equipped, but the most noticeable features are a large refrigerator, and a cylindrical machine that Morgan has never seen in his life. It looks organic, like flesh carved out of chrome, and it reminds him with a shock of the bomb aboard the flight from Britain.

As Poe watches, he sees three men in doctors' scrubs at work. One of them is his quarry, while the other two seem ethnically Asian. Chinese, perhaps. They extract a beating heart from the refrigerator and place it into a waiting orifice in the alien-seeming device. The thing begins to hum and whirr, wrapping the heart in a silvery cocoon and spinning it about rapidly. Thread after thread of a quicksilver spider's web is woven around the heart. One doctor extracts it from the device, whereupon the process begins again.

This time, there is no living heart. This time, the machine begins to cocoon empty air. And when it spins down, there is a newly-created heart, beating and alive, crafted out of mercury and shining with an inner blue-green radiance.

Morgan bites his lip. If there had ever been the slightest shred of doubt in his mind that the Assembled were behind the organ theft, the first glance of the cylindrical machine would have wiped it out, and seeing the device in operation would have blown it to smithereens. _Forget petri dishes and cells,_ he thinks, as quietly as he can, _this is cloning straight out of Doctor Who._ At this point, he has only two thoughts in mind: gleaning enough information from his destination to find this place in the physical world... and returning to his body intact. If he can do so without the Assembled knowing he'd been here, even better.

Morgan notices that the surgical theater is now prepped, and has a body lying in wait, covered in a sheet. The figure jerks to life as the three doctors turn in unison, looking in Morgan's "direction". The body rises to its feet; Morgan sees to his horror that there is an umbilical cable of some kind grafted to the cadaver's lower spine, leading back to machinery in the operating theater. And he sees, as the body shambles toward him, that it is absolutely without a face.

Whatever that thing is, Poe decides - and it is probably some form of Assembled, or one of their creations - it means him no good, and he's well overstayed his welcome. "Goodbye! I think I'll go back to my home now," Morgan lies, with emphatic conviction. And with that, he takes to his heels.

While Poe and Jet are off playing at the club, Xin hits the books, after a fashion. _What can you tell me about places where the Lands of Light can be accessed... I need to find a way in that's not at the Infrared._

Alice's voice is soft and quietly apologetic. "I can tell you if we're in such a place, but I don't know of any that you don't know of, Mr. Lao.. Do you know how to find them?"

Now it is Xin's turn to be apologetic. _All I really know is that they tend to be around a nexus of information. I'm not sure how to find one aside from walking around until we're right in the middle of it._

Alice hums. "Then I suppose that's what you must do..."

"It's crazy enough to work," mutters Xin, before he hits the streets. As a part of this endeavour, Xin familiarizes himself with the city's public transportation system. He catches the bus, the rail, even a trolley, while trying to find a way in.

The city surrounds Xin, moves with him, sings its songs to him. And as he journeys, he finds faces watching him, smiling at him. They speak to him in his mind, half in a dream. "Find your student," they say. "Find your student. Find the Blood of the Dragons."

It takes a moment for Xin to realize that he's not asleep. As for who or what the Blood of the Dragons could be... he's not certain. But student... there's something he can understand. "How will I know who my student is?" As he half-mutters this, he looks around, trying to spot the many-tailed fox he's spoken with in the past.

Then Xin remembers... Schroeder... "The Blood of the Dragons... was it him? Are there others?" And then there's the memory of the kung-fu race in the burning building not long ago. _My student..._

_They are all your students,_ says the kitsune, nestled within a streetsign as Xin passes. _Find them. It is time. You will need all their strength._

_Will they know me?_ Xin lets his attention drift out across the bus, trying to remember the two he's met so far, how they looked, how they carried themselves, what they did to the world around them. How their _chi_ meshed with his. Filling his mind with this new purpose, Xin starts to see the world anew.

_They will see the Virtue inside you. That is all they will need._

The brakes on the bus hiss with the effort of bringing the massive vehicle to a stop. The passengers inside lurch in an attempt to compensate for the effort, save one, who barely even registers the change. The doors open, and the cool, conditioned air steams and condenses around the opening as Xin steps out. There's something about him that catches the eye as he moves through the crowded Frisco streets. Here is a man with a mission.

_
