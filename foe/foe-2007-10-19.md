The events of the past twenty-four hours leave Benford with one inescapable conclusion: the team needs bigger guns. With no more than a copy of Janes' Small Arms and a legal pad, he realizes the solution is quite simple: start with a mortal weapon, and perfect it.

Los Angeles is one of those places where a man with a credit card can buy nearly anything. German motorcycle safety suits are a small matter. Competition-grade shotguns take slightly longer. With these raw materials, Benford sets about to construct gear worthy of an Exalt.

At one time, Benford would have thought that machine precision was necessary to acheive good results, but mortal machines have nothing on a determined Twilight. He occupies an anonymous shed in a self-storage park, one of dozens of boltholes prepared by the West Coast All Stars. He won't be observed or disturbed here, and that's all he needs.

He starts with the armor, an expensive synthesis of leather, steel, and kevlar; already the best mortal hands can make. It has to be better. He closes his eyes, flexes the joints gently, noting by feel and the barely-audible creak of leather and metal where the weak points are. He repeats the process for each suit, covering the legal pad with lists of a thousand tiny defects.

Then, with literally surgical precision, he uses a scalpel and tweezers to weave imperfection out of the very fabric of the armor. Normally, re-bonding the plates would take weeks, and could even introduce new problems. Benford doesn't have that long, so he weaves in a hair-sized filaments of kevlar, steel wire, and primacord, in a complex pattern carefully calculated to repair the armor at a microscopic scale.

When he's done, he seals the plates shut, and lights the single fuse. The thousand tiny explosions are surprisingly quiet; Benford hasn't wasted any energy on making noise. The armor glows with a spidery pattern as the microscopic patches cool. In the dim light of the shed, it's like a map of fate itself. _One down,_ Benford thinks.

The scientist turns his attention to the shotguns. Each Benelli is already a top of the line weapon, lovingly packed in its own aluminum carrying crate, with a lifetime guarantee. Marines swear by them and competition shooters dote on them. Still just raw material, compared to what Benford hopes to gain.

The modern shotgun has hundreds of parts, ranging in size from the blocky polymer stock to tiny screws holding the pistons in the autoloader. Benford starts with the barrel, a single large lump of metal. He takes it outside and sites down its length at the noonday sun. A mortal eye would be burned horribly, but brilliance and perfection are the stuff of Solar senses, and in the pure light, Benford can see the few remaining defects in the superb mortal workmanship.

Once again, with tweezers and microscope, Benford wraps the barrels in primacord and tungsten-steel thread. He lights each fuse, briefly surrounding the metal tubes in a brilliant, actinic glare. In his state of heightened awareness, Benford can swear he hears angels singing in the quiet hiss of the cooling barrels.

Benford files every last screw to microscopic tolerance, and re-assembles the shotguns. While they are clearly the same objects, he can feel in his heart that they aren't mere weapons anymore. A talisman deserves more than a serial number. For the finishing touch, he takes a diamond file and etches a phrase into the stock - _Ultima Ratio Regum_, the Last Argument of Kings. He carefully packs each weapon back into its case.

"Hallejuliah," he mutters, and calls Morgan for a pickup. Time to start the fight.

---

When Morgan arrives, Benford is waiting inside the storage shed, wearing the safety suit. The garment gleams even in the dim light, an Arthurian talisman of kevlar and leather. Benford picks up one of the gun cases and reverently presents it to the journalist. "Hero of Truth, meet the Last Argument of Kings," he intones. "Now let's go kick some ass."

Benford selects one of the crates, containing the first shotgun he upgraded. "I'm going to take this one. As the first of the series, I should take responsibility for it."

_Thy eye shalt fire me truly, thy will shalt guide me._ It is a voice only Benford hears, and an undercurrent of Essence that only Benford feels. But it is as real as anything he has experienced before. It is similar to the sensation he and the others felt in Tijuana, but far more contained. It is the sensation of the birth of something new.

Morgan takes the weapon gently, aiming at the far wall and sighting along the barrel. "I'm no expert on guns, but... you've poured your heart and soul into this." Maybe it's just the fact that Morgan knows it to be true. "If our God is with us, who can stand against us?" he says, the slight veneer of accustomed irony in the quoting of Scripture overlaying a core of conviction.

Benford lays a hand on the weapon. "The craftsman Exalts the material," he says simply. It's the last thing he says for some time.

The City of Angels is a fitting battleground between light and darkness. Matters of philosophy rarely bother Jet, however. For her, this is another job to be done. There's no money at stake. This is about something more important than cash. This about proving that she's the best there is.

'Life is about 40 percent preparation, 40 percent raw will, and 20 percent bullshit,' thinks the Lunar as she slips off into the darkness. She needs every drop of information she can get concerning this hospital and she needs it now.

Bullshit comes first. 'It always comes first,' whispers Jet softly as she begins to sift through the many layers of hoods and wannabes. Just finding the kind of fence she needs takes three hours. There's a certain feeling she gets around those who know what is really going on. They are like glimmers of starlight among the darkness of washed-up, wasted kids and soon-to-be suicide stories.

The way money she just spent would make a pimp blush. 'Preparation,' she explains to the Fence as she leaves. She isn't bothered on her way back out into the world of decent people. With the change she just dropped everyone has her marked way too high on the charts of the underworld to try a thing. 'Nobody had to die today.' Maybe there's a bit of luck in that equation, as well.

The Lunar again tests what she has purchased, just as she tested it originally. When she's satisfied, she begins the second phase. She visits the hospital. She needs to master this place, and that requires a certain approach, a certain methodology. For a while, the beautiful Lunar makes her way about the hospital, dressed in rags and wearing the filthy face of an old beggar. A thorough application of grease and a strong scent of trash defines what it is to be poor, and a paper bag clutched like a suitcase full of diamonds hides sound recorders of a sensitivity that even Jet's ears cannot match.

But there is more to a location than hearing what is said inside, and more to it even than what the eye might see. Knowing that all things are of essence, Jet begins to understand. Her perception reaches past the physical, prying into the feelings that emanate from this building, into what it means to be this building. It is more than stone and steel and glass. No building made by any hands can be bereft of a spirit all its own.

When at last this picture begins to form in her mind, Jet knows it is time.

---

It is midnight. Jet stands five miles south of the hospital. The moon hangs in the sky, but it is shrouded by low-handing clouds and smog. The Lunar wears a suit that clings like a second skin, and indeed, much of her is bare, but stained by soot and ash. She is not blackness, she is a living, breathing aspect of the atmosphere itself, so that only her eyes might stand out. She looks off to the north, feeling the building in her mind. 'Tonight, I hunt for the truth of our enemies.' The blade that Jet draws across her palm is like ice. It hurts for a moment, and then the offering of blood is made. Three thick drops stain the ground in front of the Lunar, and then she is gone.

Dark feathers cut through the air as the Lunar rides skyward. Only her eyes could see her target from so far, but she does not need them to guide her now. She has wandered these streets and they call out to her. She hears the whispers of the fox and settles her weight silently a block from the hospital. She watches the cars race by as she is again woman.

'Raw will,' the Lunar reminds herself silently. The space is passed slowly, and she moves amongst the shadows as if they were kindred, timing her motions with the noises of distant traffic. Her heartbeat changes with her controlled breathing, so that when she at last draws near the hospital, even these sounds are hushed.

Locks only want to keep you out. Jet knows quickly that those on the main doors are disabled. She could simple slip past them, but she elects not to. Locks want to keep intruders outside and something tells her to leave them in peace. There was a time when she thought the art of theft was beating the lock.

But the art of theft is avoiding the lock. At least the good lock. Jet has seen enough of the hospital to know where the trash was once thrown out. It is not the medical waste that interests her, but the mundane trash. Like most places, the protections of this pathway were almost an afterthought. A climb up a dark trash shoot turns the stomach, but the Lunar has crawled through worse than this.

The door at the top is secured out of habit, and Jet examines it carefully. The lock was certainly monitored once, but the metal of the door itself has deteriorated. The Lunar draws out a thin instrument and begins to carefully probe the strength of the metal. To get her self through would be difficult. To make a hole large enough for a snake is another matter. It is corners and shadows she seeks. The blood of a reptile is cold, and the vision of a serpent ideal. She sees with her eyes and her tongue, and as she navigates downward she grows more wary. The eyes here are not closed.

Light is the enemy of the serpent and in the thickening blackness of the hospital the snake finds its target: a sealed door. The basement lies protected beyond it. The exploration of this blockage requires another hour. The serpent slides through ductwork and glides through hallways. At last Jet is satisfied. Every clear way down is barred to her.

But there are other ways to travel than through the open air. The serpent seeks out a bathroom and pauses. Water must flow in and out of this place, but the upper levels are closed. Having little time to backtrack, the serpent glides over cold tile and past dry porcelain. Downward it goes, through dark pipes, winding on and on until she plunges into stagnant water.

Only the map inside the Lunar's mind tells her which way she wishes to go, and roughly how far away it will be. The rush of current confirms it, as water threatens to blast her away. Climbing as she does it takes much strength, and Jet cannot tell what filth she is bathing in, or whose blood might be washing past her. At least she knows she is in the right place.

The serpent winds past drains, until at last there is nothing but darkness and silence above. The distant song of machinery is still in her mind as she pushes her way up into an empty bathroom.

The door is not secured, but Jet inspects it to make sure its opening is not monitored, either. Satisfied, the snake first casts itself upward to wind about the door's handle, then bends to pull the door open, until its narrow head can at last be forced through the opening. The pain is brief, and then the rest of the body can be drawn through. She has reached the basement at last.

The hospital covers a substantial amount of ground. And the subterranean chambers are even more sprawling, needed as they are for storage and the less savory, antiseptic endeavors of human medicine. Jet hears the relentless whine of rattling machines, fans blowing, and a peculiar, animal-like whirring noise. She discovers something else: like the lab in San Francisco, the basement here has been extensively modified. And it is cold. Very cold.

Water is used as a coolant and piped through a regenerator. Jet is able to locate the power conduits. Whatever facilities are operating here get their electrical power from a purely internal source. Nothing here is on the grid.

Jet finds a damaged access tube leading into what must be one of the storage bins of the morgue. A harsh fluorescent blue light pervades the coffin, and there is a well-preserved human body lying within. Still coiled tightly in the inner plumbing of the basement, she studies the corpse lying here. It takes a few moments, but Jet now realizes what her instincts have been telling her: this is not a human corpse. It's flesh, wrapped around steel. It's another zombie, like Snake was.

The silent form of the machine that wears flesh is enough to make Jet's skin crawl, but the sensation lasts only a moment. She moves past it patiently. It is not enough to be silent. It is not enough to be in shadow. She clears her mind, the last thoughts being of her 'brother'. She wonders if this is how Cam came into being, or if he is something else entirely. She hopes that he is more. She wants him to be as real as possible. With that, she lets go, her head clearing of concious awareness. She is only perception and instinct. Nothing need be decided. She flows like water, never having to stop and ask which path has less resistance.

It takes only a moment for the coffin's metal door to slide open. Jet manages it soundlessly, finding the mechanism to be well-maintained. Much better than it would be were the hospital really abandoned.

What she finds is a morgue - but a vastly expanded one. All of the walls are being used for body storage. It's impossible to tell how many actual bodies are in the vaults, of course, but there is room enough for hundreds.

It's what is at the center of the room that is most interesting, though. Three human figures wearing thick jackets and leggings work at a table covered with surgical instruments, computers, and notepads. And beside them, eight feet tall, is a cylindrical device that looks horribly organic.

The machine is built around the basic idea of a spiral. It looks something like a loom, with a drunkenly distorted geometry, but what it might weave is unclear to Jet. However, it is definitely the source of the whirring noise.

Jet has seen a lot. She has guesses, but no proof yet. She could return now, and everyone would agree that she had done the best she could, but some part of her would know that she hadn't. Her form shifts silently, and soon the shadowy fur of a black cat is slipping through the room. She can hear soft whispers from the doctors, and it lets her gain a feeling for when their attention is most diverted. She is careful of the other thing, slipping behind desks and finally hiding beneath a chest full of medical equipment. She winds up patiently under it, covering her nose with her tail and watching the scene with care from the shadows.

There is no "conversation" as such; there is mumbling, primarily between two of the coated figures. One has metallic, clawlike hands whose fingertips differentiate into dozens of monofilaments, like waving fronds, but appears otherwise human - and ethnically Chinese. The man he speaks to is the missing California doctor. Jet recognizes him immediately, despite the severe glow of his artificial eyes.

What they talk about is biology, and genetics. Jet hears the English but can make little sense of the professional terminology. Periodically they'll glance at the third member of the research group, who will nod accordingly. He appears to be the only unmodified human of the lot. Were it not for the sunglasses he unaccountably wears in the morgue, Jet would be sure of it.

The room has one clear entrance and exit - a large access door of the type used to let in trucks. It opens vertically, sliding upward and downward, and is on the far end of the room.

Time passes. Jet finally discovers one of the things she'd hoped to learn. One of the scientists has moved to the loom and has begun tapping out commands on what passes for a keyboard, installed as part of the device itself. The whirring grows louder. The machine shudders. It starts to spin, and the 'threads' contained in its loom begin to shuffle and arrange themselves within the baroque innards of the device. The central column that supports everything else spins, and spins faster, until Jet is sure the thing is going to fly apart from the forces at play. In time it spins down again, having formed an object at the center of itself. The man reaches in, pulls it out gingerly, and begins walking toward the far wall. What he holds in his hand is a lung.

Jet has seen lungs before. This one is different. It gleams. There are nodes on it which glow with an inner light, and its surface is burnished and metallic. Still, it is clearly as flexible as organic tissue.

The lung is put into something that Jet would guess is an official organ transport case - packed with ice and other cooling, with some kind of digital monitoring device on the side of the case.

Jet is very nearly spotted, twice. On both occasions she retains the presence of mind to get out of sight, and then - most importantly - to stop moving, because the human eye automatically scans for motion, like all other predators. Once, she is sure that her searcher really did spot her, regardless. But if the man with the steel hands did see her, he says nothing about it.

The transportation crates are all of a similar size. They are rigged to be hooked or roped for transport in groups. Human internal organs are never very big; each of these could easily be carried by an unaided man. None of them have a shipping address, although they do have bar codes, presumably for scanning by hospital personnel for their internal records.

To Jet, this operation seems on the surface to have an obvious purpose. She is quite aware of her lack of information still. She can only think of one thing to do. She reaches out carefully in her mind, whispering to her friends, "I need your help. Have you ever seen anything like this before? Do you know what they are doing?"

_It seems familiar..._ The twins speak with one voice. _The sound of spinning. They always left right after it happened._

_Do you know where they send the organs they create?_ Jet asks. _Or how they ship them?_ They are real, they must be moved through some mundane means. The Lunar continues to watch the doctors even as she asks the twins for help. _I'm not sure how long I can safely hide here. I am sure they spotted me once, but why wouldn't they do something about it?_

_We don't know..._ The voices stop, for Jet can see the man in shades moving. He takes hold of the handle on the case, then begins opening the shuttered door to leave the facility.

The group outside of the hospital can see a man in black leaving out of the back entrance. He's wearing sunglasses, unconcerned that Los Angeles at night is still not quite bright enough to see by. And he's carrying a plastic case.

Jet considers her options. She could tail the man directly from where she is, but that seems risky at best, and it doesn't make much sense. Instead, she will slip her way back out again. She navigates the same halls she took to reach the morgue, pushes her way back into the bathroom, and again slithers her way through the drain pipes to reach the main level. From here, the path out is a quick one, though Jet is cautious. She does not try to communicate until she's clear of the building. The words are not very direct, but to her allies they should be clear. "I'm running a bit late, dear. I probably already missed the bus. I hope I can still catch up!"

It doesn't take a genius to decipher Jet's meaning, but Benford still needs a moment to figure it out. "That man who left a moment ago... follow him," he instructs Xin.

"We need to find out where he's going," says Morgan. "We're not ready to capture him yet. If it's one of the doctors, we can't protect him yet - if it's an Assembled, we can't hold him."

Benford says, "And equally important, we need to find out what he's carrying."

The figure ducks into a nondescript fleet car, some kind of Chevy, a few blocks from the old hospital... and promptly drives to another one - Good Samaritan, a few miles further downtown. It's easy enough for the team to follow, but the area is crowded and there's no opportunity to intercept the vehicle.

"Oh, dear. I wonder what this could mean," Benford mutters. "I think I have to go in there." He shrugs out of his armored jacket and dons his cardigan. "Anyone with me?"

An animal is extremely conspicuous in a hospital. But men in white coats, or men with reporter's credentials, find it far easier to navigate the gleaming white halls of Good Samaritan. The man in black seems to have a similar amount of access. Nurses refer to him as "doctor", though they never call him by name. He has long since donned his shades. It takes a bit of footwork, but the group manages to tail him through the elevator to the fourth floor.

Two police officers are stationed outside of his apparent destination. The man has a simple enough solution, it seems: Jet, closest, hears the hiss of compressed air and can even see the tiny stinging darts hitting the necks of the two cops. They don't visibly react, but she can see the effects of the neurotoxin: their bodies become stiff, their eyes bulge. They remain standing in place, but they won't be stopping him.

The tails look for signs of a weapon. All they saw was a casual flick of two fingers on one hand. The man makes for the room.

Benford grinds his teeth. "Keep after him," he murmurs, and smoothly steps aside to examine the paralyzed officer.

The tails have to clear out very quickly - the room the policemen were guarding is being visited by others as well. Two Hispanics who have been loitering nearby start for the room upon seeing the visitor, and Jet and the others can't be seen by them in turn.

They enter the hospital room, and the Exalts close in to listen.

"... New lungs, muscle fiber... this _pobrecito_ will be good as new within a week. Better than new." It's a man's voice, calm, evenly measured, controlled. It's the stranger with the lung. "His capabilities will be superhuman. This is the last implant he will require; the others are having theirs prepped."

"An' you haven't asked for any money," one of the Hispanics is saying. His voice is accented, but intelligent. Jet can feel her hackles rising. "Hey, what is that you're doin' there?" "Neurocytes," the stranger says smoothly. "They'll aid in his recovery."

"So what is it we owes you, man?" asks the other Hispanic. "You jus' pull this stuff from de air, you don' need cash? MS-13 don't like owin' nobody. We need to settle this _straight_, know what I'm sayin?"
