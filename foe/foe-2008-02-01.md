Infrared is still an active hot spot. The Alchemical activity on site has been closed down; now only the nightclub remains. But it's a useful "hot spot" in another sense.

Marlene isn't sure what to think about Tijuana. But one of her first questions has been how to access the Lands of Light safely. The Americans told their stories, and she told hers in return.

Now the young hacker is interested in plugging back in. For that she needs a road trip, and some guards. The Man is more than willing to play along - "she needs to clean up her messes," he explains privately.

Charity has her own reasons to go to the Lands of Light, and she has friends who can keep her safe. She has questions, and she has a strong suspicion that the Alchemicals can answer them with the same blunt honesty they have always demonstrated. Too long the Lunar has been hunted, risking her life and her family's safety. The half-answers she has puzzled out herself are inadequate. If she is going to live and die for what she is, she's going to know why.

Benford has briefed Jet as well as he can, and he's sure that Marlene is as good an escort for Jet's venture as anyone. The scientist sees a common element in the two women, what the Americans call 'A chip on the shoulder'. Still, his natural curiosity is motivation enough to follow on this trip. It seems that more Celestial allies are necessary to bring Ranapura to Earth; maybe there's some trace of them in the Lands of Light.

There is another matter - Snake. Charity understands how the access points work, in theory. Her symbiote connects her to the Lands of Light and interprets that realm in some fashion, becoming unavailable for conversation during the trip.

Charity doesn't like Snake. Fortunately dislike is something the two have in common. Knowing what she must do should make her angry, but for some reason it doesn't. Her thoughts turn inward as she murmurs, "Snake? You there? I know we don't exactly talk much, but I need you to do something. I need to go the Lands of Light." She's not going to get into a relationship conversation if she can help it.

"Why?" Snake's voice asks. It's the first actual word he's said to her since the joining, and the Lunar almost doesn't recognize it. His 'voice' is calm. It isn't angry, or excited, or inane. It's just curious.

"Because I need to know why we exist. I need to know the truth. I want to understand what all this mess is for." Charity is surprised, but maybe the symbiote Snake is more rationale. In some corner of her mind she also acknowledges that she never actually knew Snake. "I have to see the bigger picture."

"I could tell you the big picture myself. But, okay, whatever you want." The symbiote chuckles. "Just get me there, I'll do the rest."

"Thank you," says Charity. "Let's go find the truth. We will talk a lot more later. I will need to understand what the answers actually are, and I doubt they will want me asking questions for weeks."

The Celestials and their cohorts arrive at Infrared in the early hours. The club is closed, but mortal security systems are nothing but practice for the soldiers of Heaven. The Ivanova sisters, Ran Zhenli, and Ricky set up to act as security. The girls in particular seem more interested in playing with the sound system upstairs, but that's quickly seen to.

The Lands of Light are, as always, nothing but what its visitors bring with them. Tonight the intention is clear - go to the LHC. Find the Alchemicals and the gods who congregate in its City. Learn the truth.

---

Klein has transformed herself into an abstract glowing figure, free of detail. It is her avatar here, she explains, something she wishes to be. And she shows them another secret, what she calls "free-association navigation", wherein she travels indirectly to a destination by letting her mind wander.

Benford feels a stirring of respect for the young hacker, and a stirring of irritation. It's the kind of thing Benford should have thought to do. So many things seem to irritate the scientist lately... but he follows along, observing the technique.

Charity seems to have an avatar of her own. At least for this moment she wears a form much like her own, but younger, as if she were a child still, perhaps fourteen years old. "I have come here without knowledge, but I at least have the little wisdom it takes to accept my own ignorance. I only hope that I can learn what I am taught."

Morgan is impressed by the morphing of informational shapes, but retains the one to which he is accustomed. He has not decided what the 'truth' of his soul is yet, and for now, the truth of his body is a close enough approximation. He is who he is, and that is enough for now.

"That's good," Klein observes as they travel. "My father says, vergessen Sie was Sie wissen, es ist, ob Sie erlernen knnen. Forget what you know, it's whether you can learn."

"I will find out soon enough if I am brave enough to learn." Charity looks ahead, though she isn't really sure what 'ahead' means in this place. Concepts dance around her that are almost real, but she has no time to explore now. She has a destiny and she will go there whichever way is fastest.

The "City" that Jet speaks of is as much an idea as it is a place, for in the Lands of Light, the two are almost the same thing. The sky above is blue and bright, like a smooth sheet of ice, and in place of the sun there is a golden, glowing ring of fire, five miles across. The buildings of the city resemble the architectural styles of a dozen elegant and observant civilizations through the ages, with a mix of greek columns, minarets, and even the steel and glass buildings of a modern western city.

The central court of the city is a vast dome that moves and glistens like a liquid, reflecting the heavenly fire of the ring above. The band of Celestials slips through the mysterious substance of the dome. They now stand at the perimeter of a space inside that doesn't seem like it could be contained even in such a large building. The pantheon of gods, monsters, and stranger things awaits in the middle distance. Some are grouped around mandalas and diagrams depicting the ring above, which shimmer and strobe with a life of their own.

"Welcome to the Lord's Holy Cathedral," Benford murmurs to Jet. "Whatever you're looking for, you'll find it here. I hope we're ready for it."

"Ready or not," says Charity softly. "I must sacrifice the childish notions for something greater now. I'm looking for the answers to the greatest questions we face. I think 'cover' is fairly irrelevant here, correct?"

"We can be seen by the Alchemicals, and traced back to our bodies," notes Morgan. "But we can deal with that."

"Cover? We are Exalted," Benford says simply.

"Since I expect to talk to Alchemicals, that is unavoidable," says Charity. She steps forward and essence blasts around her, revealing her for what she is. As the light streams from her Charity murmurs, "Please, we need to speak to someone who has knowledge and who still has faith. We must speak to someone who feels there is hope for the world still."

The Exalts are rather surprised by a whistling sound from over their heads. They look up. A black streak is plummeting almost directly at them. It crashes into the surface with an enormous BANG. Rising out of the sudden cloud of sparkling gold particles that passes for dust is a huge figure, taller than a giant. Benford recognizes it: Kotetsu Jin, the metal creature who assisted him in finding Klein.

The humanoid machine creaks and whines, mechanical servos twisting and chains spinning in its innards. "I am the guardian," it announces. "Speak."

Charity looks up at the giant, surprised for a moment. She bows politely and does as she is instructed. "I hope you can forgive our intrusion. We come to seek answers. I want to understand what I am and what it means to be Alchemical. I want to know what hope remains in this world."

The machine clicks and clanks. "Analysis. Lunar Exalt. Shapechanger. Chosen of Luna, moon-goddess affiliated with Creation. Codename 'Steward'." It pauses to whirr for a few moments before speaking again. "The Alchemical condition is one of order and progress and refinement. We seek perfect harmony throughout existence."

Charity nods slowly. "Is there hope of harmony between Alchemicals and my own kind? Also, why were Exalts sent to Earth if our gods are affiliated with another world?" Her questions are many, but she needs to know.

"If you accept our ideals, there will be harmony," Kotetsu Jin grates out. "Our available information suggests that you were sent to oppose us, however. Your wish for harmony is thus contrasted against your patron gods' intentions."

Benford glances around the room; there are few Gods on Earth. So some of these must be from Creation; and some of those might be taking notice.

"What are your ideals?" asks Charity. "Also, as I understand it we are given our gifts to be what we will be. I do not think our choices are narrowed beyond that. Whether our patrons would oppose you or not is not necessarily definitive. I think we must follow our own minds and hearts. That is why I am here. I am tired of fighting when I do not even understand what it is we fight for."

"Our ideals are harmony and perfection. We value order." Jin's 'eyes' stare down at Charity, eternally patient.

"Can you please define harmony and perfection for me?" asks Charity. "Among my people such concepts have been abused so that their meaning is not always clear. Order, I think I understand."

"Harmony. The reduction of friction between components to the theoretical minimum. Components which function in a purely compatible fashion. Example: A and B deciding to cooperate on a project. Harmony is increased when their methods are complementary." Jin whirrs for a few seconds to await comprehension, then continues. "Perfection. The reduction of self-derived limitations on accomplishment. A component is perfect when it accomplishes its designed purpose without hindrance from itself."

"Please tell me again, the purpose of this place," Benford asks.

Jin's head swivels with a ratcheting sound to look at Benford. "The purpose of the City is to act as a gathering point for beings interested in communicating with the creations of Autochthon. This place is a temple dedicated to the Maker. Secondary purposes are to perform experiments in Essence management and to study the Solar Exalt, Newton Benford."

"Ahh, wow!" Charity laughs and seems pleased as she hears the answer to her question. "That makes sense of so many things." She almost sounds surprised that she can understand. The answer to Newton's question has her laughing again. "It seems you are famous, Newton."

"Benford has this place. I have Gerhardt. You have Cam," notes Morgan.

Benford seems taken aback. "But... I don't... oh, never mind. But why come here at all? What is there for you on Earth?"

"I cannot discuss our ultimate objectives," Jin says quietly, grinding under his breath. "However, logically, it will be something compatible with our natures."

Benford says, "Alright, then. What have your experiments in essence management turned up? Because we're told there's more on the way, and the results are going to be... 'unpredictable'. That can't sit well with you."

Jin's eyes study Benford. "Our research yielded tools such as that which allows you access to this place," he says at last. "It has led to other projects such as the Akashic Mandala, which has been demonstrated periodically to the City's visitors."

Charity looks thoughtful as Benford speaks, finding more questions, and like a child she fearlessly asks them of the patient guardian. "Harmony is the perfection of a more complex system, isn't it? I am trying to be Cam's sister. Ideally, siblings operate as a team. They could become like a single component, but only if they achieve harmony. Is it possible that the Exalted could achieve this with the Alchemicals?"

"It is possible," Jin grinds out.

Benford says, "How, then?"

"Align yourselves with our goals and methods," Jin answers. "To be trusted as partners rather than infiltrators, submit yourself to the Maker. He will make the final judgment."

"How do we submit ourselves to the Maker?" asks Charity. "What does it mean to do this?"

Jin extends a metal finger at Benford. "He has spoken to the Maker previously. Follow his guidance."

Benford says, "Who are you to judge as as infiltrators, like you are the law here and not us? He said to become one of you, yet we have no knowledge of what that means." The scientist points his finger back. "You're a different order of being from us. We all know that. But I'm tempted to try it just to see if it will work." Something about this encounter is giving Benford a terrible headache; every painful moment of the last three years is sharp in his mind, from stubbed toes to getting shot in the head.

Charity looks back at Newton for a moment, but she has other questions. "Why is it that the Alchemical attacked us? Even before we were aware of them they seemed aware of us, and their actions were hostile. If we can achieve harmony, why would they do this?"

Jin listens silently. Ignoring Benford's challenge, he answers Charity. "The demonstration of disharmony has just been provided. Further, the long-term history of the Celestial Exalted suggests that they will bring destruction and ruin to systems over which they hold authority. The history of Creation is fixed around an event known as the Usurpation, for example. Because of this, you are an enemy of order. And even now, having personally been attacked by the Alchemicals, you seek harmony. Therefore the most beneficial strategy is to attempt to kill you for the sake of order. Barring that, you will seek harmony regardless, satisfying our need for a contingency plan."

"We will only seek harmony so far, guardian," corrects Charity. "When you take something we value greatly, you will see our wrath, and if we could truly rock creation to its foundations, we will rock your world and endanger your Maker. Is that truly what you want?"

"Our calculations indicate that we will win a protracted engagement with the Exalted," Jin answers calmly. "Otherwise we would not engage in hostilities at all."

"Calculations fail," replies Charity. "And you assume it will be protracted. We are not like you. We have beaten your every attempt on our lives, and we are growing ever stronger. If you truly have as your priority our destruction, then there is no contingency, no quarter, no peace until we are annihilated or you and your maker are destroyed."

"Destruction is one alternative of many," creaks the metal man. "As you say, we have engaged you in many ways. Some have been peaceful, others not so. Most have been constructive for one or both parties."

"But have you considered the possibility that your destruction would be a net benefit to yourselves and the world?"

Charity nods, "I have thought of it. Are any beings meant to have so much power? What of you? What answers do you have. What proof do you bear that your ideas will work anywhere?"

Morgan can't help but chuckle at all this. Somehow, something about this conversation strikes him as funny, though he can't quite say why. "Come now, Charity. They cannot even tell you why they are here. You can't possibly ask them to show you the calculations proving why their plan is sound, when they can't even tell you what it _is_."

Jin's eyes fix on Charity. "In our history, none of us has harmed another, cheated another, deprived another of his function. We may fight and die, when it is constructive for us to do so. Those under our guardianship do not suffer."

"Every cell harms another to live. Every day a living body must destroy cancers in itself," says Charity. "Life is inherently violent. It is a battle of virus and immune system, of hope and despair. You say you have never harmed another, but yet you have killed humans, and you have facilitated their misery."

"Human lives die." Jin nods slowly. "I assume you are not familiar with the dynamics of reincarnation and destiny. Are you aware, for example, that the soul positions itself for a life of happiness or suffering prior to incarnation?"

"We've had a number of ideas about life before or after death," Morgan says. "Up until now, people in Gaia really had no idea which ones were right. That one's one of the ones people have believed, but we had countless other guesses."

"Yes. That is because the people of Gaia come to Gaia in order to be ignorant of such matters."

Benford says, "But that's all going to change, isn't it? Because now we're here. And you're here. And God knows what else." The sweep of his arm encompasses the room. "It was damn hard to keep the world from falling apart before! Now we've got all of this, and just 18 months, and it will be back to fairy tale horrors! Who's got the answer to that?"

"Who is supplying the Essence that will cause this change?" asks Jin. His eyes bore into Benford's.

Benford says, "You tell me. Are the few Celestials really enough to warp the whole world in our wake?"

"Yes, you are."

"Why is it our presence is causing this change?" asks Charity. "Why were we even sent here if it would cause damage to this world?" She thinks for a moment, "I think we were sent here to protect this world from you. You use essence just like we do. You, too, would change this world, wouldn't you?"

Jin shakes his head. "The use of the Engine stabilizes our Essence flow. As you have seen, we do not possess an anima banner, nor a Caste Mark. 100% of our ambient Essence is regulated."

"So why can't you just give us something that does the same for our essence?" asks Charity.

"As you can tell, we did." Jin eyes Charity curiously. "Autochthon's Engine is apparently 100% compatible with your Sparks. Logically it was intended that you be capable of utilizing them."

"Then why is the world going to be changed?" asks Charity. "If we all use the engines, won't the damage be reversed over time?"

"'Damage' is not a correct assessment. Perhaps it would be easier to show you." Jin points with a metal hand. "Follow me. We will speak with the overseer of the Core."

"On what basis do you conclude that it is 100% compatible?" asks Morgan. "Because it doesn't _feel_ 100% compatible. We still have anima banners, as you refer to them. And there are... other side effects." He rubs his virtual forehead.

As the group walks, Jin answers. "Logical deduction. You are capable of energizing yourselves using Essence, and entering this domain. These are the functions of the Engine. You possess anima banners because of your Exaltation, which our power cannot contest."

Benford says, "Deduction you may have mastered, but induction is also important. This world is a snow globe. How do you know that your path won't lead to ruin in a closed system?"

"Because we were constructed by the Maker," intones Jin softly. "We are here."

"And who made us?" asks Charity softly.

"'You' are a combination of factors. The Spark of Exaltation, created by the Maker. The power of the Incarnae, decanted into those Sparks. The hun and the po, the higher and lower souls, whose origin has never been discovered."

Jin reaches out and opens a door which isn't there. The world, the City and its inhabitants, slide away with startling abruptness. In its place, the Exalts find transcendence.

Their world now consists of a matrix of colors, arranged in a geometry so pure that it sears the eye. The Celestials blink away afterimages, finding that they can only truly see when they focus their vision on a small part of it.

The world vibrates with a current of Essence powerful enough to make their hairs stand on end, to send shapes and thoughts cascading through their minds. They feel the 'little dragon' of Essence everywhere. They walk in an invisible ocean of potential power.

At some point, the group has lost Klein. Logical enough - she has no reason to consort with the enemy, and every reason to begin negotiating the end of her deals with the gods of the City.

"So the Maker also had a hand in our existance," says Charity. "You say that Exalted caused horrible disasters in Creation. Why do you think that you will do better if your Maker's touch lies upon beings you viewed as flawed?"

"We are not human," Jin points out. There is no sarcasm, no smug superiority, no haughtiness. It's a statement, nothing more.

Benford glances around, squinting against the chaotic glare. "Is this the Core," he asks, "Or the Supervisor?"

**This is the Core.** The voice is omnipresent. There is no body associated with it, and no direction. **I am the Supervisor.**

Benford says, "Do you also supervise the... umm... Akhashic Mandala?"

**This is not the Mandala. This is the prototype. And its prototype was the Loom of Fate.**

Benford says, "Prototype?" Benford asks. "For what, for what passes for Fate here?"

**Yes.**

"Is the fate of the Lands of Light distinct from that of Gaia, then?" asks Morgan. "Or is this a reflection of Gaia's Loom?"

"You said that this would explain the difference between damage, and what happens because of our Sparks," Benfords states. "What are we looking for?"

**The Lands of Light are an extension of Gaia,** the Supervisor's voice answers. **They are a consequence of the Core, which itself guides the fate of Gaians. Mechanically, you may regard it as a mechanism for capturing the excess Essence generated by the normal operation of thinking beings such as humans. Normally this Essence would leak into the environment. Instead it is captured here, and refined into what you might call memes.**

**Consequently the Core is structured to process Essence generated by mortals. Undirected Essence of the sort that is currently flooding Gaia will overreach the capacity of the Lands of Light. One of our symbiotic humans described it thus: When there is no more room in dreams, our dreams will follow us to the waking world.**

Benford says, "And who was it who said that?"

**His name is Silas. He is a musician and songwriter.**

Benford says, "Can the core be upgraded?"

**Observe.** The Celestials find their attentions drawn to a particular strand of the geometry of the Core. Benford squints, finding himself able to discern details. He sees twists and shapes, fractal formations within the strands of Essence. **The Core is being supplemented. We are introducing a principle called Vedic Computing, which replaces the Paradigmic Cascade strategy of the last three revisions.**

**To understand Vedic Computing, consider a triangle.** And because this is the Lands of Light, a triangle dutifully appears, floating heedlessly in space before the Exalts. **Now bisect it with a line.** And so it is done; the triangle is divided into two halves - both triangles. **Now bisect them again.** Again and again, lines appear to halve the triangles. More and more triangles are formed, each smaller and smaller than their parents. **The principle of Vedic Computing, simply put, is that infinite recursion - and hence infinite memetic Essence storage - is possible by constructing triangles which naturally bisect themselves.**

Benford says, "When did the last two upgrades take place? And when do you plan to deploy this one?"

**Our capacity planning guides our upgrade schedules. We have provided additional capacity at historical eras which correlate to the rise of technology and the broad distribution of ideas, scientific, religious, or philosophical. The deployment of this upgrade is necessarily delayed, since we have predicted a potential negative outcome.**

**The storage capacity will naturally act as an unlimited buffer. Ergo the Essence flow will continue, probably dismantling the reality of that Essence's origin. We predict that the source of the Essence influx is Creation.**

**Hence, we are deploying the upgrade only to limited-use regions of the Core, along with a valve mechanism. However, this will not be sufficient.**

Benford sputters. "You're going to destroy Creation to save Earth?"

**No. As Autochthon's primary motive is to protect Creation, this would be inconsistent with our goals. Neither is it Autochthon's wish to destroy Gaia. Ergo, we decided to attempt to neutralize the factor which is drawing Essence to Gaia. Namely you.**

Morgan smiles thinly. "This is ironic. The primary reason - possibly the only reason - you have to neutralize us is that we are here, and yet, the reason _we_ were sent here was because the servants of Autochthon are here. What's wrong with this picture?"

"I have a question. Where are the borders of Gaia? Would it be safe if we lived, say, on the moon? On mars?" asks Charity.

**Those are still managed by the Core. Hence, no.**

"How far do we have to go, then," Benford sullenly asks.

**You would need to leave Gaia for another Realm. Then we would need to verify that the Essence flow has stopped.**

Benford says, "Alright, then. Last question." Benford pauses, squeezes his eyes against the transcendent, beautiful, terrible glare, then opens them again. "Why the bloody hell should we believe you?"

**Your Charms enable you to detect truth or falsehood infallibly. You may employ them on any statement you wish,** the Supervisor answers.

"They have never lied to us," says Charity. "If anything hints that they might be as powerful as they say, it is that. The strong do not require deceit."

Morgan nods in confirmation. "They have not lied to us," he says, with absolute conviction.

"You seek harmony and perfection and order," says Charity. "Among the most central of all life impulses is to survive. We do not want to cause damage. We do not want to harm Gaia, but we want to live. Will you help us? Will you abandon expediency?"

**Your death and reincarnation would be sufficient. We are capable of re-imaging you. Barring that, you would need to seek out your patron gods and petition for your Exaltation to be undone.**

Benford says, "I can safely say that I would sooner die," Benford grunts.

Morgan grimaces. Then, a thought. "You said our presence here is causing this Essence imbalance. We were told that there were a handful of Exalts that visited Gaia, quite some time ago. Did they have a similar effect? Or was that mended when they departed via the Desert?"

**Incursions in the 11th millennium B.C., the 4th millennium B.C., and the 20th century A.D. caused no significant increase in Essence.**

"So what's different this time?" continues Morgan. "Sheer numbers? Or is it something else? Some qualitative difference?"

**Theories have been advanced. It may be a secret weapon of the Deliberative, unknown to the Maker. It may be a threshold of Exaltations. It may be the arrival mechanism. The matter has been inconclusively studied.**

"So if that is true, killing us likely will solve nothing," says Charity. "Without evidence of what is wrong, how can you conclude how to fix it?"

Morgan rubs his chin. "I can only think of three ways to fix this. Either they drive us off, we drive _them_ off, or we come to an understanding. Which... well, given that it's our Essence causing the imbalance, boils down to them driving us off with our cooperation."

A massive window snaps open in front of Charity. It could be described as a chalkboard made out of light, a transparent pane on which numbers, symbols, and letters are crammed together. Connecting lines and symbols crisscross the entire display. **Here are the calculations linking your presence to the Essence increase,** the Supervisor notes calmly.

Charity has no knowledge of what lies in front of her, she has no background in occult to move from, but lately she has done things with nothing but raw talent. The diagrams are essence, and that gives her a starting point. For her it is not a matter of reading, but looking at every strand of essence and plucking from it a meaning beyond mere shape. Essence longs to serve its purpose, and this diagram is a collosal attempt to grant comprehension. Charity turns inward, opening her mind and preparing herself to accept that meaning, whatever it might be, banishing any biases or desires beyond the need to understand.

After a full minute Charity lets out a sigh. "Nope, don't get it." She'll have to rely on someone else to verify what is in front of her.

Benford follows the chart slowly, verifying the symbols and notations. Here he sees a complicated diagram he takes to be the Core - the constants attached to each entity are suggestive of Essence flows through a structured matrix comprised of _dharma_\-tainted Essence locked into a pattern through a fluctuating 248-cyclic cyclic process. And here he spots the influx of patterns from a place "outside" the Core, attaching themselves in a permanent configuration to a standing wave pattern. _The cycle of reincarnation, mathematically expressed,_ whispers an old memory.

The bindings render a reverse connection to the patterns' point of origin - Creation.

"I do," Benford mutters, sounding defeated. "They're right. Simple as that."

"But we don't know the ramifications yet, nor why or how it was started," says Charity. "And I think that information is important. Is it too late to prevent the first shift? If we went, I don't know, somewhere. If Exalts came to Gaia before from outside, surely we can find a way to get back out."

Benford says, "We'd have to find and convince every other Exalt in the world to come with us. And I know what I would say, if it were someone else asking me."

"So what do you suggest?" asks Charity. "Their way won't work. They can't find all the Exalts, and I doubt they could defeat them even if they did. Not to mention that kililng us probably won't change anything."

"I don't know," Benford mutters, sounding defeated.

---

The Celestials have learned what they can, for now. Exhausted, they find themselves in Infrared in the pre-dawn hours. One by one they stagger out, making for their vehicles.

Morgan lags behind. He feels a touch on his arm. He looks back and finds a young man, with a smile so radiantly happy that he could be the Sun coming up over the horizon. He's androgynously handsome, with a soft voice, and he speaks to the reporter. "They're wrong, you know. There is a way out, and it was planned for. The Lunars went into the Wyld. The Solars made pacts with what they found there. The Fair Folk are coming. And it was her idea." The youth nods distantly toward where Jet was. "Don't tell the Autochthonians, though. My parents would kill me if they found out I'd talked to you."

Morgan's eyes go wide. "You're... kidding..." is all he can whisper.

The youth shakes his head, grinning from ear to ear. "It'll be beautiful. You guys are geniuses."

"Geniuses... Right," Morgan says, grinning uncertainly, and pats the godling's hand as he turns and hurries to rejoin his companions. _Ye gods, are we **insane?**_ he thinks to himself. _But... there's no denying the Fair Folk are powerful. They'll certainly turn the tide... but was this the only way? Was it the **right** way?_ And a small corner of his mind begins to wonder if, just maybe, the Autochthonians have a point...
