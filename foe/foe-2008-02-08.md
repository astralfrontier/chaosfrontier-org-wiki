As soon as the Circle can convene again in privacy, Morgan conveys the information granted to him by the godling - that the Solars of Creation have made bargains with the Fair Folk to enter the war for Gaia on their behalf. "I suppose it makes a twisted _sort_ of sense - if we're facing the ultimate embodiment of order as antagonists, enlist chaos given form as our allies," he continues. But I don't know. From what little we've heard about them so far, they scare the willies out of me."

The Fair Folk - known by a thousand other names to the people of Creation - were covered in the briefing. Unshaped beings of inchoate Essence and desire, lurking at the edges of shaped reality, sometimes taking the form of lordly creatures and bringing their servants with them. They stole dreams and feasted on virtue. And they were one of the primary reasons that Gaia's refuge exists at all.

Charity finds the thought of endangering the refuge to be a bit radical to say the least. Her questions start from one point. "How could I come up with this plan? Is it something I do from the future? Or did I do it in the past?"

Charity's avatar, the Lunar teacher - the only person, really, who could answer such a thing - speaks to her. "We have kept things from you. Things which would cause despair, or confusion. This is one of those things. Now is the time for you to know it."

"Essence is the weapon by which you fight. Tanks, bombs, guns.. these are only the crudest tools. A refined mastery of Essence is the only practical tool against a Primordial. Because it wasn't possible for Gaia to release her Essence stores, we found another way. We would bring Essence from the Wyld, filtered through the cunning machines of the Solars."

"But there was more. The Lunar who was responsible for this plan realized the dangers. He had developed some fairly radical theories on how to fight the Fair Folk. This was his chance to put them into practice. And so he engaged the Fair Folk in a new type of war. He would battle them in the arena of creativity, of imagination."

"The Fair Folk would bring their wonders and their horrors. And the unused Essence of humanity would be spun into their weapons. It would be a magnificent spectacle, enough to keep the Fair Folk interested - and therefore contained."

"It may seem strange to think of our world as being at the mercy of children amused by shiny baubles. But it is those children who ever threatened Creation. Now they would be caged by human dreams, and their power used by you as weapons of war."

"So they will generate the essence we will use?" asks Charity. "I'm still confused about this somehow being my idea. Do they mean that it is someone I used to be then?" She wants to understand this point, and she won't stop until she grasps it.

"Yes. One of your predecessors, one of the people in Creation to hold this Spark of Exaltation." Jet's avatar smiles. "Who looked nothing like me, by the way. I'm more of an amalgamation. But if you search your memories and your heart, you will find him - and the others - waiting for you."

Morgan scratches his head. "No, I think I get it... some of it. _Humans_ generate the Essence - in part, by reacting to the Fair Folk - and the Fair Folk shape it." He narrows his eyes. "The child spoke of making bargains - I assume _that_ is how my counterparts in Creation intended to keep them from rampaging all over Gaia."

"The Fair Folk can not break a sworn promise," Jet's avatar says through the relay, "any more than a mortal man may grow wings and fly. It is a part of their core nature."

"All right," acknowledges Poe. "And my Caste are supposed to be the best dealmakers ever born or spawned, the ones who wrote the prison of the Yozis, so I can only assume those promises are as airtight as my kinsmen in Creation could conceive them to be. All the same... I can't help but think of rabbits in Australia."

"What kind of weapons were used against Primordials? How did the Lunars help win against a vastly strong enemy?" asks Charity. "I understand that essence is the beginning of everything, but I know there were masterworks made to fight as well."

"Join us," murmur Hunter and Edward, speaking in Morgan's mind. He finds himself with Jet, beholding a scene out of wonder.

The Primordial War marked the dawning of the First Age of Man. Previously no more than a hairless creature formed by the gods and ruled over by the Primordial-spawned Dragon King, Man - and Man alone - received the blessing of the Exaltation. At first this gave them little advantage. Simple tricks called Charms. An enhanced ability with the folk witchery intrinsic to Creation, called thaumaturgy. Superior bodies and minds, free of defect.

Development of their mastery of Essence gave the nascent Exalted more and more power. The creation of Essence-driven devices out of the Five Magical Materials came from Autochthon, the Great Maker. At first the Exalted accepted his tools and trinkets; later, they made their own. Essence cannon, warstriders and their larger cousins the Machine Messiahs, suits of self-actuated armor, skyships. They commanded armadas of powerful weapons.

Arrayed against them were the Primordials and their lesser souls, now called demons of the Three Circles. Kill an incarnate demon and you could deny it power in the world for a time; kill it and use the Solar Charm called Ghost-Eating Technique, and you could unmake it utterly.

The Lunars fought in ways the Solars could not, reshaping their protean bodies to face menaces such as Kimberry, the Burning Ocean. They drew out the lesser souls of the Primordials and their fetiches, destroying them and sealing away their power with Solar magic. They used the Great Rites and the Names of the eight million gods in Creation. They worked proto-sorceries that would take a century to finish.

Piece by piece, the Primordials were destroyed. Not in a single titanic battle, but in fight after fight parts of their very souls were sealed away and transformed. If one were to compare it to fighting against men, one might destroy an enemy general first by annihilating his armies, then entering his mind and sealing away his feelings about the battle, his tactical acumen, and his valor.

"In short," Jet's avatar explains, "they wiped out the Primordials by changing _who they were_. In place of a powerful rage, they gave them impotent hatred. In place of freedom, they imprisoned them within themselves."

"This ghost-eating? Would it help against creatures like the assembled or Alchemicals?" asks Charity. "When the world changes and essence begins to come in greater amounts will we start to see the materials needed to create wonders like what you've shown me?"

"I suspect that Ghost-Eating Technique will consume the Assembled Essences that you've seen in the Lands of Light. You should be able to do it now - if you were able to master the Charm. There are no Magical Materials in Gaia, but you should be able to make do."

"So we must use Ghost-Eating on the enemy and tear them apart bit by bit," says Charity. "Autochthon will anticipate all of this, though, won't he?"

"Of course."

"The Alchemicals managed to bring wonders of their own with them," Morgan observes. "We captured some, not long ago, and if we can find more, we can continue to do so. Just as we tear the Essence-Engines and symbiotes from their shells and use them in our war on them, we can do the same with their physical artifacts."

"We need to go to Ranapura," says Charity. "Is there any way that exalted can use to call each other together? Surely there has been a need like this sometime in the past."

"You can announce yourselves in any fashion you like," Jet's Lunar mentor replies. "Of course you fear detection and attack, but... aren't you facing those things inevitably? Shouldn't you face them on your terms?"

"True," says Charity. "I had hoped there was some more secret way, some way to only reach exalts that wasn't essentially a galactic billboard."

"And with Benford's fusion power announcement, we've already raised our profile immensely," Morgan points out. "My only misgiving left is waking my fellow Gaians from their dream, and..." His face changes. "Time is running short until that will happen regardless."

"The dream seems to be little more than a dream," says Charity. "This world is a sort of reprieve, an attempt to escape what cannot be escaped. I do not think it is healthy this way. In a very real way, this place is a lie."

"Yes. You've realized the truth. Some will say that it is inevitable. Let us say one thing to you: _nothing is inevitable_. It is your power to change the rules, if you can muster enough strength. There may _not_ be such a way to commune with other Exalts, and yet you might find yourselves making one."

"So the Solars write the rules, and the Lunars help enforce them," murmurs Charity. "I think it is time we start changing what is possible here. It is also time that the people of the world know the truth. They are going to suffer and die, it is the least we can do. They should know what is coming and what must be done."

"You may talk of this," Charity's avatar replies. "Now. How will you make it happen?"

"We must throw away any thoughts of hiding. The time when we can sneak quietly alone is over. The scope of this conflict and the swift progression of our enemy leave us little choice but to begin the great work of our age," says Charity. "Our enemy would kill us all, and so our only response is delivered in kind. Those who will not work with us will be destroyed."

"We go to war, knowing that we tried to avoid it," says Charity. "We tried, but the enemy will not be turned aside by offers of peace. It is our annihilation and the enslavement of mankind they seek. We will not sell out those we have come to save."

"Amusingly, our foes do not see it as enslavement, either," observes Morgan. "But then, it is truly rare in a war that the combatants see themselves as evil."

"Evil and good are simplifications of an ugly world full of unfortunate complexities and truths that would keep us from sleeping at night," says Charity. "Still, it is easy to make the choice we have made. Saving mankind from itself is worthless if men no longer have the potential to pursue their destiny."

"It's easy to say you will do these things," Charity's avatar observes. "Now. Act on them."

"Then let's get started," says Charity.

Two pieces of news arrive that stand out. First, it seems that the James Randi Educational Foundation has paid out its prize. One million dollars was offered to anyone who could demonstrate a supernatural or paranormal ability under scientific observation. The JREF has absolutely nothing else to say on the matter, and most people are writing it off as a cheap publicity stunt. Previously, Randi had discussed closing the fund down. Now, people say, he's just looking to see if there is further interest.

Second, Jet receives a letter. It's from Tokugo-san in Japan. "Thank you for your support and your visit," it reads, in a beautifully-drawn hand. "I wish for you to understand my intention. We must restore the samurai ideal to Japan. In this modern world, I don't think that is possible any more."

"Therefor I intend to speak to the Emperor." Jet rereads the kanji a few times. Tokugo is speaking with an archaic politeness she isn't familiar with. "I will present myself as the rightful descendant of Amaterasu, the Sun-Goddess. I will ask him to honor my right of succession to the throne."

Benford is less than sanguine about everything that's been discovered. He leaves the other Celestials alone to their deliberations and heads for the roof of the hotel. The sights, sounds, and smells of night in San Francisco waft up to him from the street below. At another time Benford might find it exhilirating and exotic. Right now, like everything else today, it just irritates him.

The scientist paces, kicking gravel ahead of him. "OK. So we make a plan to solve all the problems of the modern world. Then we find out that the modern world is going bye-bye. And we're the cause. And the brilliant solution from those pillocks in Creation? Send us a pack of bloody fairies!"

Junior is present; Benford feels him. And Hypatia is here as well. The young man is the first of the two to speak. "On the surface of it, yes, they've gone right through Madness and straight to Sparta. So what's your objection to it? That you don't understand it?"

Benford doesn't make much effort to hide his anger, however uncharacteristic it might be. "I had a little trouble with the Gods. But now we're going to bring in the Monsters? What's the point of a refuge if we bloody invite the enemy into it? What is even the point of rationality, of science?" Benford wheels on the image of the younger man, pointing a finger like a rapier. "What... is the POINT... of me?"

"How about to impose some order and sense on the world?" Junior asks calmly. "How about to act as a balancing force against madness and magic and all that stuff? How about to be Gaia's advocate in this grand scheme?"

Benford shrugs. "If I understand this right, we were the ones that cracked the dam in the first place. And I can't shake the feeling that Autochton - or somebody - planned it this way. A long game, and for all we can do, we're still just... pawns. Ugh." Benford puts his head in his hands, squeezing at his temple. "I have the worst headache I've had in years. What the hell is going on?"

Junior shrugs a bit. Within his mind, Benford can feel Hypatia radiating sympathy, but she has nothing to say. The avatar continues. "You're not pawns, that's for certain. You weren't _picked_ to be a counterweight, or to be a rationalist in a mystical world. Your place wasn't decided. You were given Essence to wield. How you wield it is your business. The Sidereals plot and plan, but they do so to help you out. Everything that happens here, at the end of things, will be partly _your_ design. And part Autochthon's. And part everyone else's."

Benford says, "Maybe. But maybe... mostly Autochthon's." Benford straightens up. "I need to go there. To where ever He is... or they are. It's the best course of action, just crunching the numbers. If it's as bad as it looks, then Old Uncle A has the only workable solution. And if it isn't... I have to prove to myself that he's wrong."

Junior nods slowly. "Then that's what you should do. Dad, do you know the true nature of your power? Do you really understand just what it is that you do?"

Benford plops down onto the gravel bed, back against the rampart of the hotel roof. A police siren is sounding somewhere, and it's overly loud and grating, as the Americans are wont to make them. To Benford, it's like fingernails across the slate of his mind. "No. I just do it. Always have. I was going to die. It made things... rather urgent."

Hypatia coughs a bit. Although she isn't visible, Junior defers to her. The woman begins speaking, adopting a tone of voice Benford recognizes from school - the teacher. "The Bronze Age ended circa 1000 BCE. Zoroaster taught his religion in what is now Iran. If you had been born then, you would be starting to enter old age now. That is my understanding of the lifetime of the Exalted. You would have seen the rise and fall of Rome. The spread of Christianity. The burning of the library of Alexandria. Three attempts at world conquest. The Dark Ages. The Enlightenment. The founding of America. You would have been alive for longer than London had been a city."

Benford frowns. "Great." It's all he can think of. "Then what do we do?"

Junior takes over. History is Hypatia's angle; the Exaltation is the avatar's. "You know all those things? Those historical shifts? You do things like that. But your power isn't 'making history happen'." The youth approaches Benford, looking him straight in the eye. "Your power is this. You turn courage into magic. You know all those hopes people have? Those frustrations? Those things they _know_ that need doing? You can do them. If you have to walk into the lion's den and confront the enemy, well, you won't be the first Solar to have done so."

Benford says, "Now that you mention it... Davron did something like this... didn't he?"

Junior nods. "Davron's visit to Autochthon was essentially friendly. The enemy he was facing wasn't a Primordial, though. It was himself."

Benford says, "As I understand it, the enemy is an artifact of the system. The Primordials can't let Creation be destroyed. But the backlash from our presence here threatens Creation. So He goes after us; he has to. It's is nature." Benford stands up. "My function as a Solar was to discover the whyfors of this whole affair. I didn't. And I am..." He pauses to kick a discarded bottle across the roof; it hits the side of a stairwell and shatters explosively. "BLOODY pissed at myself for not doing so. So we're going to spare ourselves the trouble and go get the answers from the only being that has them all."

Junior nods. "You know something of what you're capable of. You've made a decision. Now those around you will support you in it. That's all you need, dad. You have everything you need."

Benford doesn't reply. He doesn't know if any of that is true; he doesn't need to. But he's going to get his answers, one way or another.
