Benford - or rather Wheeler - has been chatting with Silas and Hugh. Both seem human enough... but Wheeler is not really human himself, and Hugh is something else entirely. On the surface it's been informative. Privately, Wheeler considers the situation, and finds few answers. _I'm still Benford in all but name. It doesn't feel that different to be an Alchemical. The presence of the Song is something, but it doesn't trump who I am. And if the anthropic principle is really that strong... is it better to be human than machine after all? Is that something the Maker can understand? Can I now understand it for him?_

As if prompted by this thought - and there may be some truth in that - Wheeler feels the approach of several of Autochthonia's servitor automata. He feels something else too: a need to go with them.

The machines clank into Silas' little domain, not bothering to announce themselves. "Silas and ... unit designated Wheeler. Come with us for assignment." They turn, not even confirming that their orders will be obeyed. It is simply assumed.

The compulsion is odd, but not entirely unwelcome; after all, this is why he made the trip. Wheeler rises and follows the clanking automata. "It's been interesting. I hope we get to do this again some time."

The machines lead the way to a spherical chamber. At the center is a gurney, of sorts, complete with restraints. A device with more mechanical tentacles than a jellyfish is affixed to the ceiling. "Enter," the machines command. "You will be fitted for your mission."

Wheeler feels a little reluctant... not exactly rebellious, but the unpleasant appearance of the machine and the terse instruction are leaving some doubts. "This will be easier if I know what the mission is." And then he remembers: the Song. He blinks and puts the question to the rest of the unity.

He feels it immediately. It radiates from the machines around him. It comes from the device overhead. As he is strapped in and partially dismantled, he feels it coursing into his innards. As the mechanism's kraken-like tendrils remove components and add new modules, he feels it infusing itself into his blood and bones - or what now pass for them.

"Have you ever been in love?" The voice is one out of Benford's memory. Wheeler can't place its source. "Ever had a person that you wanted to please more than anything else? Her needs, her wishes, even her casual whims. They were all so important to you. Have you ever wanted someone's happiness that badly?" The memory flickers away, leaving the nascent Alchemical with doubts as to its reality. But he can understand why it came to mind. He knows what he has to do, but more - he is in love with his mission.

The objective is simple: discover the specific nature of the Essence influx from Creation to Gaia. Gather data. Take no specific action.

Wheeler can feel it. It's like Paris in springtime. It's like long walks through the snow. It's unwrapping a present on Christmas day. It's all those stories they tell you about a perfect life, a perfect family. It's the pleasure of discovery, the joy of living. The Essence flow! Wheeler's 'heart' races just thinking about it.

Wheeler understands the difference now. "This was always my purpose. It is simply that I did not know it, when I came here, and that was why I lived in pain." The machines finish their modifications, sealing access panels in place. "I will keep the name Wheeler. Though I know what Benford knew, he could not have known what I now know." He is discharged in a standing position. "But the scientific method still applies. We must make observations. Most importantly, we must measure what we do not know. This is not a casual incursion, but the magnitude of intention behind this mess is unknown to us. An answer to that question will calibrate the rest of the task."

Wheeler's first destination is Silas' office. On the way he assembles a plan - almost literally. The collective mind of the Alchemicals is the greatest data storage system ever divised, and it's a trivial matter to arrange a small corner of it for the influx study. He's so engrossed, he forgets to introduce himself to the human. "They've given me something to do," he says. "I need to have a look at the conduit that takes us to and from Earth. It's a controlled incursion, and from there way may learn something about uncontrolled incursions. I thought you might want to come along." Wheeler glances at Hugh; talk about your random variables. "You're invited as well, though I suspect you already know more about this than both of us."

Hugh nods at Wheeler. "Love at first sight is beautiful!" He closes his eyes and draws in a deep breath, laughing as he opens them again.

Silas is used to the Assembled skipping social niceties; after all, such things are a special capability given only to the ones that are intended to interact directly with humans. Nevertheless, the request itself surprises him. "Me? I'm happy to help, of course, but what do you ask of me?"

_Because he is human_, Wheeler realizes. The knowledge does not come from himself, but it is still truth.

"Earth - and Creation too, for that matter, are all about their humans," Wheeler replies. "That's a perspective the Maker does not have. Or at least doesn't have much of, before now. Umm..." Embarrassment is a human trait; but the label fits for what Wheeler is feeling. "And I need you to keep an eye on me. Hugh is right. This isn't just like being in love, it is love. I want to get this right. So I need a reality check against stupid mistakes."

Silas pauses for only a moment to listen to the Song, then picks up a few thin volumes. "Sounds good. Where do we start?"

Wheeler grins. "With the light at the end of the tunnel."

The visual appearance of the portal isn't all that impressive: a large room, with a heavy security door at one end, and a lenticular, black window hanging in space at the other end, like a pool of oil suspended in mid-air. The other walls are blank. At first Wheeler is disappointed, but he remembers, looks are deceiving for Essence machinery. The Song is quite loud here, with many complex melodies and harmonies. Trying to follow any one takes all his attention, and each is distracting and hynotic. Wheeler returns his attention to the disc. _Other songs, for other purposes, and other beings. I... like mine better._ But he does know where to begin now. "A machine this complex, can speak for itself. I wish to learn from you, o gate, and your servitors, so I may better locate others of your ilk."

_Ancient magic_ is what Wheeler first feels. _An old magic with no name. The power of the Demons of the Third Circle could accomplish it. The Incarna could manage it. And greater beings._

Wheeler recognizes something familiar in the knowledge that comes to him. _I am the road through a potential existence,_ it continues. And Wheeler realizes what is speaking to him. It is the gate from Autochthonia to Gaia, yes. But it is also the being standing next to him. It is Hugh.

"Surprise!" says Hugh suddenly. The declaration is punctuated with the usual wide smile and laughter.

Wheeler kneels before the boy. He isn't sure what his face is doing right now, but the feeling is certainly familiar: _Confusion. Yes, I can still be utterly dumbfounded. How... Newtonian._ "Are there more like you, Hugh?"

Hugh looks at Wheeler seriously for a moment, even scratching his chin and tilting his head. Finally he raises a hand and waves it, "Nope, not a thing." He pauses and laughs. "Except you. And him. And all your friends. And your first science project."

After this Hugh adds, "Of course, there just might even be a few things _exactly_ like me. Maybe."

Wheeler is strangely satisfied by this answer. _There's at least one way that this could make sense. And if I'm right... this could be a very easy mission indeed._ "I suspect one would have to travel quite far to find them. Further than any man, hero or mortal, has ever trod before?

"Can't do it," says Hugh.

Wheeler's mission tugs at his attention again. Hugh is a wonder; but in the end, he's not the answer. Or maybe he is the answer and Wheeler just doesn't understand it yet. In any case, more information is needed.

"Hugh, I think - no, I'm sure - that you know what Benford was trying to do, better than I do," Wheeler begins, still kneeling at eye-level with the boy. "Better than he did, probably. Something is drawing Essence from Creation to Gaia. If we're going to have a happy ending on this story, I need to understand why that's happening. So I want to ask two questions, if you'll grant me an answer."

"First," Wheeler asks, "Is this drain something that you want to happen? And second, is it possible to find the endpoints of it, like this gate?"

Hugh grins at Wheeler and crooks a finger, leaning in to whisper, "Not telling and no idea!"

Wheeler chuckles. "OK, then. Plan B." He glances over at Silas. "You getting any of this at all?"

Silas scratches his head. "Only the barest inklings," says the man. "You said you wanted me for my human perspective, but this is all beyond me."

Wheeler levers himself upright. "Any more than I can understand all of Autocthon, I suppose. I'll tell you my guess: on Apollo 11, when they stuck the flag in the moon and said 'For All Mankind', I think our friend Hugh here, was the referent. Anyway, I'm going to need some instrumentation. It takes a very powerful being, to do a thing like this, and I think we can rule out some of the usual suspects. Which means this is not a subtle phenomenon. Which means it should be possible to find others like it."

Since there doesn't seem to be a lot of other activity in the departure room, and the security automata don't object, Wheeler sets up shop there. He isn't quite sure what he's looking for, and many of the instruments and recorders may prove to be little more than fancy props anyway. The real key to the experiment is the Song itself. The gate is an example of an Essence incursion between realms, and the Song surrounding it is very complex. By learning a small part of it, Wheeler hopes to find a signature he can search for... even if it means travelling to the edges of Alchemical or human experience.

Hugh has said that he doesn't know if the endpoints of the essence influx can be located, but he's still an indirect part of the experiment... if only because he watches Wheeler labor with his usual inscrutable, bemused look, which reminds Wheeler of a grown-up watching a child try to walk.

In the end, Wheeler's instruments do bear some resembelance to an orchestra, albeit one without any musicians. The collection of detectors, collectors, recorders, and displays extends in a half-circle some fifty feet from the gate. No exotic components were required (at least, exotic by local standards) but Wheeler had to sign every requisition with a piece of his soul, so to speak, and it makes the need to deliver a result a bit more urgent.

In the end, Wheeler comes to a simple enough realization. The transportation mechanism, the egress point which the Alchemicals use, is indeed a mechanism - a device constructed within Autochthon's conceptual universe and obeying its laws, bridging those laws to the fundamental physical constraints of another place. It isn't a door - it's a translator. But it's still a mechanism. And he understands the paradox.

Where is the mechanism between Creation and the Solars?

Wheeler drums his fingers on a stack of printouts. "Plant a soul in Earth. Make a mortal. Plant a Spark in a mortal. Make a Solar. Power the Spark with... what, exactly?" He stops drumming. "What if the Spark isn't built to refuel that way?"
