It's the evening after the Celestials have gone public. Benford and Mokembe are examining the catatonic form of El Jaguar Hombre, on the supposition that the madness of the chimera may be related to the mad lunar's condition. Meetings with the visiting dignitaries have been postponed until the following morning. The experiment has as much in common with weapons disposal as it does with medicine, and for good reason: if Jaguar wakes up, he'll likely try to kill someone... possibly himself.

Benford leans over a computer terminal, watching the flood of data coming from Mokembe's instruments. He mutters to himself as he works.

Benford says, "Alright. So here's what we know: Jaguar's madness seems to come from his constant activation of the Engine. The Engine is an Autochtonian device for channeling Essence, and interfaces to the Spark. Morgan, Charity, and myself have all experienced some unpleasant fits since our Exaltation; but not to the degree of our patient. So there is something about the Spark, the Engine, or the interaction of the two that puts a strain on the human psyche." He scrolls back through Jaguar's EEG. "Doctor Mokembe, I'm no expert, but it seems he's in perfect health... like all of us. So how likely is it that his psychosis is biological in nature?"

"I have been thinking about it, and this is what I think," the doctor replies after a few minutes, drawing out and enunciating his vowels in the highly-educated accent of English he speaks. "Imagine this man as a car. The road is the world. The engine spins the driveshaft, the wheels turn, the car moves. His soul is the car, the wheels the link between that and the world - the brain, in other words. If you shoot the tires, it makes no difference than if you were out of gas. The car doesn't move. But to the mechanic, it makes all the difference in the world."

"But that reporter who talked to me - Mr. Morgan? He described a _spiritual journey_ to this man's inner soul, and saw turmoil there. Physically he is quite healthy. In fact I'm not sure he _can_ get sick in this fashion."

Benford nods. "So it would seem, then, that his condition is 'essential'. In the Exalt's meaning of the term." Benford sighs. "The Briefing that Hel gave me - I'll get you a copy, if you haven't seen it yet - was full of stories about mad Exalts." Benford's voice softens. "In fact, I understand that a great deal of your reluctance to work with us, comes from a fear of what we might become. So I appreciate what you're doing." He pauses a moment, and then continues, "But they didn't have Engines. Jaguar does. And it's putting an additional strain on his soul. So if you will permit the experiment, I propose that we examine the interface between the Spark and the Engine and see what makes them such a burden."

"Of course," the doctor says. "If there is a cure for this sickness, we must find it."

"Then we'll need the Symbiogenesis Device," Benford states. "Or as we've been calling it, 'The Chair.'"

Benford's investigation into the psyche is aided now by his own mastery of Essence - the ability to pool his magic and refine his already-considerable talents of investigation and research to a laser-like focus. Stripping away all distraction, all preconception, it is perhaps the supreme irony of the cosmos that he relies on magic to forge himself into the ultimate scientist.

What he observes is a much more refined version of Carbon's observation that a mind is a place of forces in opposition. Memories from a dozen lives surface in him again, reinforcing what he 'sees': the spirit is a minature replica of Creation's own Essential natures. Four poles of force are rooted in diametric opposition around a fifth central pillar. In Creation, these are the five Elemental Poles of Earth, Air, Fire, Water and Wood. In the spirit, these are the central ego, or the will, surrounded by four forces thought of as the Virtues.

Mathematics provides him further insight: these poles act as attractors, the hubs of stability in the dynamic system of personal Essence that flows outward from the will. Motes of Essence enter this system from their ineffable source, finding their way out of the system through action. But as Essence dwells within the soul, it tends to polarize around these Virtues.

Benford recalls his own theory of free will, as he wrote for 'Rings of Light': willpower is like a gravity well, and it warps possibility and probability around itself. Some wells are shallow, and some are deep. The Virtues, in their role as attractors, give shape to Essence flows. The wells of an Exalt's soul are deep indeed, with or without the Spark.

Due to his recent odyssey, Benford is intimately familiar with the Essence currents in his own soul and Spark. He uses those observations as a baseline for comparison with Jaguar. He does not do so lightly; a man's soul is a private place, and madness lurks within. And yet, something about the situation nags at Benford, but the underlying theme in the symphony that eludes him still. "There's more to the question than one man's private demons," he muses.

The scientist feels time passing, but he isn't sure just how long it's been. He's sunk himself into the comparison between two miniature universes, concentrating on the Essence flows and the relative stability of the forces operating within them. Finally, ultimately, he does achieve a breakthrough.

"We've seen the soul put itself back together after being shattered, in Ho Chen's case," Benford thinks. "And I've seen the Spark evolve, in Hugh's case. There's a principle of self-organization here... something very Gaian." Jaguar's soul is not as tumultuous as Benford had thought; but as Mokembe pointed out, the point where the rubber meets the road is as chaotic as anything the physicist has ever seen. "So what if we evolve the interface between artifact and living thing? Can we establish the buffer between maddening perfect and flawed organism? Or is the mechanism itself flawed, for imperfectly mating to the host?" Within the simulated universe of the Symbiogenesis projection, Benford's smile is itself like a star. "Let's find out together."

The poles of Jaguar Hombre's Virtues have undergone a symmetry-breaking phase transition, if that notion can be applied here. Formerly the Virtues stood in balanced opposition. Now, feeling more closely, Benford becomes aware of a new symmetry. And there's another thing: whatever afflicted the Celestials didn't last past death. Reincarnated Solars of the Second Age, for example, didn't immediately suffer from the powerful madness of their First Age predecessors. The separation of the Spark from the soul affected a dramatic phase change - by dissipating all of the pent-up Essence in the system. The challenge here is to institute another one without killing the host.

Faced with a change in the behavior of the attractors - the Virtues - Essence flows through the system become distorted. Benford can realize immediately what this means for the host. Unpleasant or unusual behavior, an intensification of the Exalt's darker attributes, impulsive or even self-destructive deeds.

The doctor is also reminded of the story of Sa, Morgan's predecessor, who excised a fourth of himself while still alive. He spared himself the madness by amputating a part of his spirit.

Vaguely hateful memories stir in Benford's mind as he considers another thing. Why wouldn't an Alchemical be driven mad by this? Of course - they don't have Virtues. They have a Purpose, and that can't fall out of balance with itself.

"'Isolation is the foundation of identity.' I wonder if He'd also say, 'The blessing of Purpose is peace; the curse of Freedom is madness.'" Benford shakes his head. "But He's not here. Anyway. What we need here is a balancing act, which sounds disturbingly close to dying. This will not be easy."

Benford reverses course and untangles himself from the clutter of minds and machines. As he levers himself out of the chair, he's shocked to see that the wall clock has advanced to morning. "Damn. I was out all night?"

During his 'downtime', Mokembe apparently put Benford on an IV drip of some kind. Other than that, he seems to be alone.

Jaguar is similarly, and thankfully, still out cold. _It would have been nice to talk to shop with Dawkins. Oh, well._ He taps a button on his Raven prototype to let his fellows know that he's still awake, and then saunters to the workbench. His plan will need a new apparatus, and these things don't build themselves... yet.

Benford rehearses the argument in an empty room, as he absently assembles his tools. "Alright. The situation, in a nutshell, is this: Essence flows around the Virtues. The Spark moves an amount of Essence of higher magnitude; and the Engine accelerates it, and from personal experience we know that it is difficult to maintain a human perspective in the face of titanic energies. Symbiogenesis technology lets us stare it in the face. At present, the resulting imbalance is corrected only by a catastrophic release... moments of madness, or death. But in Jaguar's case that does little good; he just falls off kilter again. So we have to..." Benford stops, puts down his tools. "What, exactly, do we have to do. Fool his own Spark into thinking that he died? No. That can't be it. Not all of it, anyway."

Mokembe arrives and Benford explains his observations. "I must confess that I'm at a loss. I know little of spiritual matters. I have all the levers, and not a place to stand."

It's clear that the African doctor, despite his education and experience, is at a loss in the face of this occult comprehension. But he struggles on: "Very well. So.. this Essence that builds up and leaks in the wrong direction. It can be thought of as a river, yes? It flows from somewhere, to somewhere. So... can it be dammed up? Diverted? Where does the water wish to go?"

Benford frowns. "On Earth, it typically gets siphoned off by the Core, for Gaia's inscrutable purposes. Which I imagine mostly amounts to 'running the machinery of the world.' But it's the nature of Exaltations to interfere with that mechanism. On the other hand... Hugh appears to feed on it. If it must go somewhere, why not to Him?" The scientist smirks. "I can offer anecdotal evidence that it brought peace to me, though I know not if the symptoms of unrest were evidence of the same disorder."

"Exile, then?" asks Mokembe, eyeing Benford with a wary expression.

Benford shakes his head. "I don't think we have to go that far. Perhaps something like it. I wonder if we can do something with Hugh's Egg."

Mokembe drums his fingers in a rhythmic expression of frustration. "But.. the water. Sorry, the Essence is not even leaving its lake. Essence is already being steered wrong inside this man's mind, correct? It's not entering the wider world. It's not a blockage in the world, it's in him. He's suffering a psychic stroke. A blood clot in his soul."

Benford looks grim. "Very well, then. Surgery it shall be. Fortunately, it's been done before, at least by Davron and Sa. I'll plug in. We'll duplicate Morgan's trick to give him a few moments of lucidity. In the time that we have, I'll effect what repairs I can. If it works, Jaguar will still be one mad hombre, but perhaps he'll be able to keep it pointed downrange."

Benford resumes his preparation. "We'll start with his Engine. Those usually have a Symbiote installed, a kind of artificial mind... maybe more of an artificial conscience. As far as I know, nobody has tired to talk to his." He resumes his position in the interface chair and tries to summon Jaguar's Symbiote. "We should both be able to see this, if it works."

The effort is ultimately unsuccessful. But it does lead to one important revelation: the symbiotes are, of course, low-resolution images of human spirits. As such, they will have a similar structure to a living mind. Tied directly to the soul as they are, the symbiotic personalities may be just the psychic prosthetic that Benford needs to balance Jaguar.

Benford settles into the interface chair again. "That didn't work so well. I'm going to try something else. This may take a while..." Benford frowns, and his eyes seem to focus on something miles away. "I want you to know something, Doctor Mokembe. I think that Exaltation is a temporary phenomenon. I'm not saying that heroism will disappear. But maybe when we don't have world-killing threats, we won't need such damningly superhuman solutions." He pulls the headgear down and locks the visor over his face. "I've never been good at such simple, human strength. I hope to learn it before the end. Otherwise, I'm just one more obsolete machine." His right hand pushes the activation lever forward and the material world fades.

Benford's plan happens in three stages. Morgan already took the first step, while Benford was away: use the chair's tools to give Jaguar a few lucid moments. In the microcosm of the two souls, Jaguar's and Benford's own, Benford can observe the swirling, chaotic galaxies of Essence slowly stabilize and harmonize, once again taking on the pattern of a soul at peace. The scientist can observe a critical point in the process, when the inverted poles of the Virtues return to normal. He's reminded of Einstein's classic work in Brownian motion: up to a certain point, fluids act like a predictable whole... smoke curling from a cigarette, or hot coffee in a glass mug. But push the system just a little bit past reasonable, and chaos results.

After observing the process in reverse, Benford believes he can identify the signs preceding the onset of turbulence. Jaguar's condition will soon reassert itself, and Benford will be ready.

The scientist does not have to wait long. Mokembe disconnects Jaguar's IV, and his engine surges into life. Benford can see the critical point approaching and traces the destructive influence to its source. The challenge now is to rapidly hack a new capability into Jaguar's engine: in addition to augmenting Essence levels, it must also augments the mad Lunar's Virtues. The new 'artificial conscience' will become a counter-balance against the stress that it places on a human soul.

Benford finds time for one short prayer during his rush to beat the tides of madness. "Hugh, I haven't known you that long. But I believe that our task is to prove that humane virtue - for which you are both true source and end result - is stronger than all the inhumane madness in the world. Let this be testament." And then there's no time for words.

The prayer, simply uttered, is simply answered. Jaguar Hombre's symbiote must be transformed, of course, for there was never any guarantee of compatibility between a randomly-acquired symbiote and a given Celestial. But better the imaged copy of a living (or once-living) mortal than the true soul of a human being.

It is from the Lands of Light that the new pattern comes. Benford can sense that. Some memetic image, forced into high resolution by the template over which it is laid, settles through the interface and begins updating the symbiote's personality.

Benford guides the way, offering his living mind and awareness of Essence as the fitness function for compatibility. Mutable personality swirls around the iron needs of his goal. And as it begins to settle, its nature is evident. It is no longer a symbiote. It's a partner. It's a cheerful child, and its name is Benny.

"Benny," Benford says. "I'm glad to meet you. I'm trying to help this man, Jaguar. He wants to be a hero, but he needs more than that. He needs a reason to get up in the morning that is better than seeking his blaze of glory. I hope that the two of you can work out that reason." Benford can see the Engine pumping Essence into bright patterns around the poles of virtue. The experiment is a success; the pattern retains a smooth, laminar flow even under the volume of the Engine. Benford can also see that this is more than an experiment. The thing he's done is akin to witnessing a birth. He's humbled and embarrassed to see that part of Jaguar's being. "I guess you already know all of that," he finishes sheepishly.
