At the news of the school buses, Morgan sets down the clipboard. "I missed this last time - I won't miss it again. Esperanzita is the linchpin of our defenses. If they can take her out, we're wide open and they can send in as many Alchemicals as they like. With her around, they need to send human agents." He looks off into the distance. "And yet we can't just let them decimate the Day of the Dead celebrations either... dammit!" He looks around at his companions. "All right, first thing is we make sure Esperanzita is safe, then we go from there."

"As strong as I am, I am not the mightiest of our warriors," says Charity. "That honor falls to Carbon, whose mastery of essence and raw Lunar power far outstrips my own." She looks thoughtful, "To give him more help I think the twins should stay as well. My brother and I deliver enough brute force for the other spearhead of this defense."

"We've no shortage of muscle to deal with the graveyard incursion," Benford opines. "We also have Enrique, Schroeder, and maybe Aang. Diana almost certainly knows about this, but we should call her anyway. It's in her idiom. And Jaguar... well. He's feeling much better. And I'm sure he'll continue to feel much better if we give him someone to thump.

Benford says, "So that leaves us to figure out what to do with ourselves. If this thing goes all Romeroesque, Mokembe, Chen, and myself are in the best position to deal with a countermeasure... or a cure. I'll need to go in and get out with our data. What of the rest of us?"

"It seems we have enough players for this battle," says Charity. "What they will attempt is fairly clear, but they can get rather creative in the implementation. Like they've already shown." The Lunar frowns and adds, "Newton, after this I need to pry you away from your lofty projects and think of our future. This attack may be a bit outlandish, but I have a feeling when we beat it back they will up the ante. I want a missile defense to protect us from nukes. It will fall to my security people to protect us against dirty bombs. As for the rest of us.. I'm going to the front line of this and will remain mobile."

"I hope it doesn't come to that," Benford mutters. "We have to find and capture their portal. Then they'll have a much harder time dropping bombs on us - or anything else. There will likely be a ranking Alchemical present tonight. If at all possible we must capture it alive for study. And just to set you at ease, Cam is from a different line now. He can neither help nor harm us in that regard."

"I trust Cam," says Charity. "As for the one running this attack? No idea. If I find him, I won't promise getting him to you in one piece. I will do whatever it takes to bring him down."

Phone calls are made, and the militia is dispatched to the graveyards, with instructions to observe suspicious activity from a distance and report in by mobile phone. Esperanzita and Santiago are holed up in the power plant with Carbon and the Ivanovas. Charity, Morgan, Benford, and Cam 'borrow' one of the All Star's SUVs for a personal inspection of the problem. The cargo area is loaded with God Skin armor and Benford-refit Benelli shotguns... and a surprisingly sanguine Jaguar Hombre, happy that he's being let out of rehab in order to fight.

Once she is inside the SUV, Charity dons her personal armor, which is to say that she takes on her warform. She now looms above others, her eyes burning with a righteous rage that is, for the moment, held in check.

With some apprehension, Benford places a final call to Diana Valdez, aka Saint Death. The general concensus is that she would have a personal interest in the matter, and she does. The group makes a short detour to pick her up. With flowing robes and a scythe, she might just be one more reveller. Benford has seen this look before. He knows better.

The revelers gathering for the Day of the Dead celebration are taken completely by surprise. The Celestials, warned as they were by the buses, also discover the level of planning put into the Alchemicals' ghastly operation. Corpses claw themelves out of the earth, swarming around the shocked celebrants. Surmounting each cadaver's forehead is a glistening silver plate with pulsating wires burying their way into the skull. As Jet and the other front-line Exalted make their way toward the nearest such site, they can see what else is happening.

The ghouls aren't biting or clawing or devouring. Instead, they are slamming their outstretched palms against the foreheads of the living. Where their hands go, silvery plates are left behind. The panicked squirming turns into a jerky convulsion. The fits give way to a robotic precision. And the living join the dead in swarming toward the buses or running outward from the graveyard, in search of others.

As the SUV pulls up, one of the buses is being filled to capacity by zombies, living and dead. The creatures are forming human pyramids to let their fellows climb to the top of the bus as well.

"Well Picard, looks like the Borg are in town," says Charity grimly. "Nothing for it now. I suppose you want a sample to tinker with before I slaughter the lot of them?" She doesn't wait for an answer, instead charging to protect the few survivors, her anima bursting into a brilliant flame, letting her reach inhuman speeds on the way.

"Oh hell," says Morgan, loading a slug into his shotgun. "We gotta stop the bus!" he calls out, drawing a bead on the nearest tire. "Benford! Are our people alive in there, or are they already dead?"

"Sis! A lot of them are still alive!" calls Cam, chasing after Charity. "Use some restraint!"

"If you have some ideas to recover their will I am all ears, brother," calls back Charity. For now, her unrestrained wrath runs head on into her first enemies. She is a veritable tornado of fands and claws, slaughtering the dead while experimenting on the living. Since the head is where the control is physically manifested she smashes it one of them to see what happens.

Benford grunts, working the slide on Reason. "We have to stop the buses. Go for the tires on all but one; phone the militia and tell them to do the same. Use the remaining bus to evacuate anyone still uninfected. That will slow the infection to however fast they can walk. If we can keep them contained, I can work on a countermeasure." He leans from the window and, following Morgan's lead, aims for the front tires on a bus some 100 meters away.

While the dead scatter like leaves in the wake of the Lunar's furious assault, the restrained attacks against the living aren't quite as effective. Charity quickly realizes why - as soon as she's out of arm's reach of one of the nigh-unconscious survivors, a nearby ghoul quickly kneels to reapply the infectious plate on the forehead of the fallen.

"Well, that was conclusive," growls Jet. She ups the ante considerably this time, bringing The Major into the melee. The targets are not always convenient to reach, so the seven foot titan leaps from stone to stone, vaulting off a tall masoleum and as she lands sweeping her weapon in a vast arc to strike dead as many foes as possible.

On the third attempt, Morgan manages to puncture one of the bus's tires. That dealt with, he has more time to focus on the battle itself. "Jet! Focus on the dead ones first! Benford, help me pick out the targets!" It isn't easy, trying to tell from this distance which of the foes are living people recently infected and which started the evening dead. Clothing helps; dead people are often buried in formalwear, whereas the partygoers are dressed either in festival clothes or skeleton costumes. "Behind you, Jet! Three of them! Careful, they're alive!"

Benford pulls out his phone just long enough to squawk a message to the militia: Stall the buses, aim for the heads of corpses, evacuate the still-living... and try to avoid killing the possessed. He relies on Raven to deliver the message. He's appalled by the carnage building in Charity's wake, not so much because of her use of force, but because of the loss of innocent life. He recalls a conversation with Mister Bland, many months ago: _Damn you for making good people waste their lives stopping people like you._ He silently appends it as a curse to whatever Alchemical master is behind this horror.

The tide of Lunar wrath is rising, and the brilliant light of Charity's anima flares up with her every attack. Spotting a tighter clusters of enemies ushers her into still greater motion. She casts her weapon skyward and throws herself from a tree into her enemies' midst. Catching herself on her hands she wastes no time standing. Instead her legs stretch upwards to catch the Major and twist suddenly to send the weapon whipping around.

WIth the group dispersed and the dead less troublesome, Charity is confronted with the problem of restraining those she doesn't want to kill. She has no rope, no cuffs, but a solution towers in front of her. A forty foot tree with full branches. "Hmm.. might work," she growls softly. The Lunar rushes to the base of the tree and with a roar and a surge of essence and focused will pries against the power of its roots, every muscle surging to the song of essence and Full Moon determination.

The divine might first flexes the entire root system and there is sound like a hundred ropes drawing taut. A moment later they tear with audible pops. The massive tree is ripped free then spun out like a vast butterfly net, ensnaring the living in its branches before Charity lets it fall to the ground, pinning them all in place.

Benford had been thinking of a way to restrain the infected civillians, but Jet's mighty display leaves him at a loss for words. "Oh, well. It's not a day for subtlety." He hurries over to the writing mass to examine the mechanism of the infection: the metal plates forcibly implanted into the foreheads of the victims, to Benford's eyes, of a sick parody of the Exalted badge of office.

Morgan hurries up to join Benford. "Is it safe to just take the things off?"

"I smashed one, it seemed to mess them up but they were retaken before I could tell if they were hurt," says Charity. "You can fix this." The last statement is at least half-question.

Benford kneels beside one infected victim, who glares back with a driven, haunted look. His hand hovers over the victim's forehead, over the strange metal plate. And he hears the song. "The Unity sings to us," Benford murmurs. He focuses on the alchemical chimera within himself, careful not to touch the plate... yet.

"Hypatia," Benford asks. "Can you see this thing? The device they've implanted?"

If the neurocytes are a surgical scalpel, a delicate intrusion into the brain of the host, the infection disc is closer to a neurological nuke. The tendrils are clearly active, and clearly transmitting a large amount of electrochemical impression in through the skull. It can be removed in time, but it's more easily disabled for now.

The woman's measured voice responds immediately. "Of course."

"Can you get me access to it," Benford follows. "Like our diagnostic shell? We need to disable these." He chokes for a moment. The person in front of him was just a partygoer. _Nobody deserves this._

"I... don't think so," Hypatia answers finally. "I don't think they have such a thing. It's just a weapon. But there must be a signal of some kind giving them instructions."

"Just like Walla Walla, only with zombies," says Morgan, as this is relayed. He, too, looks tense and more than a little ill at this latest atrocity of the Assembled. "Can we track down the source of the signal?"

Charity looks over the group of captured people and sighs. Drawing in a deep breath makes her body go suddenly rigid, a horrified look coming to the Full Moon as she navigates the tangles of the tree. She leans down, forcing a branch away from a pale face. "Becca!"

Benford knows that name; it just became very personal. There's no other choice. No matter the risk, a cure must be found. He sings back at the implant, looking for the control signal. It might be radio; it is far more likely to be Essential; and in any case, his own Essence hardware is the best tool for the job.

**Conquer the city of Tijuana. Capture the city spirit. Taint all the untainted. Retaint any of the rescued. Spread throughout the city. Fifteen percent of the tainted will sequester themselves into the city and act as a reserve vector.**

It's eerie to Charity and Morgan, hearing the harsh words coming from Benford's mouth. But as he immerses himself in the thing, he has come to chant the message being beamed to each of these units. They are biological replication agents, designed for intelligent neural stimulation.

Benford learns much from his examination of the disc. The transtech tendrils connect to the host's brain and require major surgery to remove. Merely damaging the disk will leave the host comatose... but alive. There's dozens of them here; there's other sites to attend to; Benford guesses there will be hundreds of such casualities. Thousands, if they are not stopped before reaching city limits. Jet's young friend Becca is already among them. He ignores the twinge of guilt and pushes through. There's a powerful entity behind this, more powerful than Benford, or any single one of his allies. He cannot change the 'programming' of the infected by himself. But there is something he can do...

"Hypatia," he mutters. "Main engine start."

Benford has only activated his engine once before, under similarly dire circumstances. The effect is dramatic: essence flows from his caste mark, flaring in the twilight like the last daylight on the horizon. His clothing is remade; the effect of the Engine merges with the God Skin, and the mundane armor takes on the surreal, glowing aspect of an angelic, biomechanical shell. Reason ripples with a halo, and Benford reaches out and places him bare palm flat on the metal plate implanted in Becca's forehead.

The metal 'squirms'. Benford feels its power wishing to overcome him, to take over his nerves. That pale black shadow of Alchemical malice is swept aside by the tide of Solar grandeur. At least for the moment, the scientist is immune to the discs.

The brilliance of an unvieled Solar is blinding, but Charity does not flinch away from it. She watches with hope soaring in her heart, sensing-not for the first time-that the Solars wield powers greater than her own.

Benford replies to the machine, coaxing it out with his bare fingers. "We are coming," he shouts, forcing his words back into the Song. He cannot take control, but he will be heard. "We are coming. The infected shall be cured. The dead shall be returned to their rest. The hidden shall be found. And you - the controller, responsible for this atrocity! We will find you, and show the Maker your inadequacy for your purpose. And when we follow you home, you can take personal responsibility for leading His enemies to your doorstep."

There is no answer that is given. But, Benford realizes with a brief flash of pride, it is not because nobody has heard.

If it's possible to see a mere chunk of metal look terrified, Benford is sure he's seeing it here; the implant practically screams as it is withdrawn from Becca's forehead, and the transtech contraption shatters into dust and lies inert on the graveyard sand.

For a moment, Charity is speechless. Relief floods her and with great care she draws Becca from the branches of the tree. In the arms of the giant Lunar the sleeping woman looks like a child. "For this I can never repay you adequately, Newton," whispers the Lunar. "Even so, I will spend the rest of my life trying."

Morgan breathes a sigh of relief, even as he scans the rest of the victims pensively. Just knowing that the discs _can_ be destroyed - that the power of the Solars can overcome them - is a weight off his mind. "Let's get Becca to safety. We're needed elsewhere. Tijuana is depending on us."
