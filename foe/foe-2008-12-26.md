With one disaster narrowly avoided thanks to Newton's creativity and perhaps a welcome dose of good fortune, Charity has a bit of time to work on one of her personal projects. In the interest of founding her line and blessing it with certain characteristics, she is turning to an expert. Ostensibly.

Charity decides the best place to talk to Hugh is on the beach, just after the rising of the sun has warmed the sand. She has no special means to summon him, no ceremony or prayer. She focuses on her dreams for those who will be of her line, building them one by one in her mind, and every vision, every possible future she constructs out of a potent hope for the future. The name of that hope is carefully prepared in her mind before it is made into a word, "Hugh. Can you answer me?"

The young man steps out from behind Charity, tapping her on the shoulder. In one hand is an old-style mobile pager, which he presents.

Charity takes the pager with a smile, "Is this your preferred means of contact now?" She can't help but laugh a little before she grows more serious. "Thank you for coming, Hugh. I need your perspective. My eyes simply can't see far enough."

"I think I should be able to call you too, you know," the youth says, managing to sound miffed despite his smile. "So hang onto it. Anyway, um, what can I do for you?"

Charity plops herself down on the beach and lets out a sigh. "I want to leave behind something special for humanity," she begins. "Something that will last, and help them against the dangers that will come, not only from outside, but of their own making. I have decided that I will do this by making beastmen, only.. not in the sense they existed in Creation. I want them to protect humans, to exist as their truest allies, and never to compete with them. What do you think of this?"

Hugh thinks. "Well, if they don't eat, breathe, sleep, take up space or need land, I think you'll be okay," he comes up with after a moment. "People need those things. Anybody else that does those things too is kinda competition no matter how you look at it. That's mom's way."

"True enough," replies Charity. "In that sense, I must make them best at settling in places that are not as desirable, excelling in living in barren lands, where their competition will not be so great. In those places I want them to bring new life. Would this please your mother? Would it please you?"

"Well, competition _is_ what pleases her." Hugh rubs his hands together. "Y'see, in her world, according to her rules, competition is what makes things better. Bad things die, good things live. Ideally, good things actively eradicate bad things. Everything comes down to a strategy for survival. Not of yourself, but of your nature. Your genes, your ideas, your children, whatever."

"What you're really asking for is more dad's line. Two harmoniously meshing components that provide synergy with each other."

"I suppose I am," replies Charity. "In a way, I want them to constantly improve themselves, but not by killing. From my limited understanding, it is possible using genetics to analyze what is and is not an advancement. At least to a certain extent. Through this means, they could advance themselves simply by limiting who will be father and mother to the next generation. The desirable shall pass their traits on."

Hugh nods. "Okay. And what about those that want to procreate, but just lost the genetic lottery?"

Charity looks thoughtful for a moment, digging into her own mind and soul to consider that impulse carefully. "I believe even that is a trait that can be controlled. I see now that I cannot just make them as living things, but I must teach them and make a culture for them. The culture would be tribal in nature. There will be no notion of the possession of children. This way, the parental urge is satisfied by having children present to teach and care for and the sexual urge can be satisfied without pregnancy."

Hugh smiles. "If everything was just urges, that'd be great. What about what they might want?"

"It's all about directing what they want in a way that achieves the goal," replies Charity. "Essentially I look at this as starting out from scratch. Whatever I envision as their ideal role, I have to reinforce by creating their spirit in such a way as to make that what they generally want. To succeed in this, they must want to help humans, they must want to protect them, they must have essentially no jealousy at all."

Hugh nods. "So essentially you're taking away their freedom to give them happiness?" he asks quietly.

"I'm not sure that's entirely possible," replies Charity. "But in short, I want to limit certain aspects of choice, yes. Their very purpose is to serve humanity. It also brings me to an interesting point." She sighs gently and looks out over the water, "Unfettered freedom doesn't mean joy. As an American I grew up with the same obsession with freedom that all Americans have. But seeing the society that has come from this endless race towards wild freedom gives me pause. There are many bad things that come with freedom as well, Hugh. At some point, the freedom of one is the opression of others."

The youth laughs out loud. "Of course there are bad things. But it's not that. It's that you're basically talking about parenting. Every parent brings a child into the world and says to them: 'listen kid, it may suck for you, but I've put you here and now you're going to make the best of it.' Every parent defines a child's existence. The child reacts to it. You're just proposing to never, ever let go."

"You and I both know that simply isn't possible," replies Charity. "So how do I achieve my goal-creating a lineage that is devoted to protecting humanity-while being realistic? My children will have hopes and dreams as well. What can I do to bring about this life in a way that gives it a fair chance to enjoy the world they are entering? I have many ideas, but I find myself in a strange circumstance."

The youth fidgets, scratching his fair hair with a hand. "Wellllllll," he says at last. "y'could make them... hmm, not human at all. Not primates. You could make single-celled organisms. Virii. Mind-modifying bacteria. Or something even stranger."

Charity laughs a little at this. "Hm, that is true. For some reason, though, I'm interested in making them closer to humanity. Perhaps because humans tend to react rather harshly to blatantly different forms." She looks at Hugh and goes on, "But I think I begin to see things more clearly. I must leave them some freedom to decide who they will be, and I think I know how to do so in a way I did not expect."

"Like you say, they will want things," says Charity. "To a certain age, the desires of a child are irrelevant in most species, especially humans. The same will be true of my children. When the education is complete, the child will have a choice. To live among the humans, and face all the difficulties, trials, biases, and dangers of that life, or to serve separately. Humans have done this in the past among their own kind. Still.."

"I wonder now if it might be better to make them different, as you say, not primates," muses Charity. "It is possible for me to do so, after all."

The young man grins. "You see? Think outside of what you know, or what you think you know. Listen, and you'll hear that song."

"Hugh, if your mother is fierce competition, and your father is harmony, what will your world be like?" asks Charity.

"I think we're working on finding that out," the youth answers.

"How does that get decided?" asks Charity.

Hugh shrugs. "Like everything else. Essence against Essence. Fates testing themselves against each other. It manifests as a struggle. It comes from what everyone wants and what everyone's willing to give up. We're the gods of destruction, you and me. Not you as a Lunar - you as a human."

"This is all about choice, and every choice is the destruction of something."

"Yes, because every choice ends a pathway," whispers Charity quietly. "But that's a good thing, in a way." She looks out over the waters again, "I had another question, and I am not sure you can help me with this or not. The world here is.. hm. The essence here is so thin, like air on a high mountain. I have been in places that are different, and I was able to gain a great ability to use essence. Yet there are still things outside my reach that would be helpful. Do you know of a way to.. I don't know, increase the density so I can learn as I did before?"

"Wait a month," advises Hugh with a quirky smile.

"So it will really hit?" asks Charity. "Just a month away.. do you know what will happen?"

Hugh nods. "Everything."

"That doesn't sound encouraging," she replies. "For what it's worth, I hope it is good for you, and that you are happy in the end. I really like the person you are right now. You aren't nearly as scary are your parents."

"Everything. And I mean everything," Hugh says. "Well, most things. I think by now I can do this without everything exploding...." He rubs his hands together. "Here goes nothing."

---

Benford, Morgan, and their other Exalted colleagues are all surprised to find themselves, with Jet, standing incongruously on a cloud which hovers a few hundred feet over a grassy plain. Hugh is there as well. "Hey, it worked," the young man says, sounding pleased with himself.

Morgan pokes at the cloud puzzledly. "Well, I'm glad of _that_. I'd hate to think what would've happened if this _hadn't_ worked."

Benford, who was probably not awake a minute ago, now finds himself absolutely alert. "What the HELL..." He looks down. "I must be awake. My dreams are never this weird."

Charity laughs a little, bit, once she's regained her sense of self and found that yes, she won't be plummeting through the cloud. "Welcome to Hugh's party, guys. This is probably at least mostly my fault, for the record."

"You guys keep asking me these annoying questions!" the young man protests. "Hugh, what's coming next? Hugh, what's going to happen? Hugh, how do I do this? Hugh, is Bobby really in love with me or is he just ...." He fidgets for a moment. "Okay, I'm not saying who asked that one. But you know! I have needs too. So, today _I_ get to show off."

He points below, on the grassy plain. "Hop down there. It'll be okay, just go ahead."

Charity shrugs and does exactly as she's instructed, leaping off the cloud without a second thought. It helps when you can turn into a bird in a pinch, probably.

Benford closes his eyes and walks blindly off the edge of the cloud, opening them once more when the inevitable fall begins.

Morgan glances at Hugh, then at Charity and Benford who are already jumping. "Leap of faith," he murmurs, and follows suit.

Off in the distance, the collected Exalts can see something approaching. It's a covered wagon, from the American Old West. Sitting on the seat are two people, a man and a girl. The man's face is shaded by a broad-brimmed hat, while the girl keeps herself safe from the sun by means of a bonnet. As they draw closer, they can see she's got something else in her hand: the latest generation of iPod, complete with official Apple ear buds.

"This is odd," Benford says flatly. "What do they usually say? 'That's not period'?

The wagon pulls to a stop near the group. "Hey howdy!" the driver hails, doffing his hat. "Don't see too many people walkin' the prairie, do we Katie." The girl, apparently Katie, quickly shakes her head. She goes back to gently bobbing her chin in time to the unheard rhythm of her music.

Morgan shades his eyes. "Just stretching our legs," he says to the driver. "What's the little lady got there?"

"It's an iPod," says Katie quietly. Her dad nods, beaming a proud smile. "She sure does love that li'l box," he remarks.

Charity is currently not sure just what she's being shown. Hugh has some odd things cooking it seems. "An iPod? I wonder what music it is playing."

Katie doesn't seem interested in answering. "Oh, she listens to that new-fangled banjo music, I think," her father supplies, stepping in to answer. "Some kinda fancy duded up music. I'm too old to appreciate it, I guess, but all the kids seem to love it."

"How does she keep it running?" asks Morgan. "Does it just keep going, or does she have to, I don't know, recharge it or something?"

"'duction off the wheels," mutters Katie, pointing downward. Morgan's eye traces out a hair-thin wire running down the side of the wagon, toward the axle. "I helped her wire it up, too," her father announces with a wide smile. "What a smart girl!"

Off to the left, the group takes note of another approaching noise. But it's not coming toward them; it's a car engine, and the vehicle will be passing them. Benford is the first and probably only one of the group to recognize the distinctive shape of a Morris Minor, as it drives past the prairie encounter and off into the distance.

Benford taps the ground with his toe, and finds it solid enough. _I don't think I've gone mad. So what is this place?_ "My mother was always partial to the Judds," he mentions casually. "So may we ask where you're heading?"

Charity watches the vehicle pass with a bemused expression. She doesn't say it, but her expression kinda shouts 'What the hell?'

"Oh, west," Pa explains. "I figure we can get us a good homestead. Katie will have plenty of wide open space to play, Ma will be able to get back to her knittin', and I'll be able to do my farmin'."

Morgan's own expression is a bit strained, but he manages a polite smile. "Well, good for you, sir. If it weren't for folks like you, I don't think I'd be the man I am today."

Pa tips his hat and smiles. "I'll be sure to tell Ma about you good folks," he says. Katie smiles faintly and stretches out a tentative hand to wave.

Benford grins and waves back. "Thanks! Nice meeting you!" And then aside, to Jet, "What did you say to Hugh, that prompted him to send us here? Or did I finally give into temptation and drink that bottle of tequila that's been in chilling in my freezer since February?"

As the wagon totters off toward its destination, Hugh comes into view from the other side of it. "Charity wanted to know what's coming," he explains. "This. Or rather, this sort of thing is what's coming."

"So basically.. in one month," begins Charity, "The entire world goes completely insane?"

Hugh nods. "Well.. yeah. What did you think was going to happen to all that Essence you guys have coming in? You were just going to get a vending machine marked BOTTLED ESSENCE, with flavors like Essence Lite, Cherry Essence, Original Formula Essence? Essence with Mango?"

"I'm just not sure why essence is going to lead to old fashions and banjo music on iPods," replies Charity. "Seems a bit.. random. What other kind of things are going to happen?"

"Everything, Charity. Everything is going to happen." Hugh's tone of voice becomes more and more serious. "_Everything_. Do you understand? Unfettered possibilities, partitioned only by the power of the Core to sift through destiny and make it intelligible."

"Dave Bowman and I have been running simulations in the Lands of Light, using containment chambers. You remember that thing you came into, when you traveled into my world? It's a place that removes the Autochthonian Essence from me, allows experiments. We figured out what was going to happen. It's this."

Benford rubs his chin. "I think I get it. You don't just 'replace' a Primordial for the hell of it. In order for this whole thing to work, we need some unstructured possibility... like it was in the beginning. The _very_ beginning."

Hugh bobs his head. "More or less."

"So.. what will this do to the people here?" asks Charity. "How does a world of such chaotic possibility calm down and become, I don't know.. stable? I can't imagine iPods and covered wagons lasting long together."

"That Essence will infuse the... the surviving Primordials," Hugh explains calmly. "It will collapse the world into a new state. Choice is destruction, remember?"

Benford says, "I think we're seeing a mish-mash of fates. All these possibilities are superposed... and we see... well, maybe we see the part that makes the most sense to us. There really are dinosaurs walking through your living room. Michio will probably take some perverse joy in it all." Benford sighs. "I suppose it would be a mistake to see this as something from which we must save people, yes? But how do the Fair Folk fit in?"

"The Fair Folk have been spinning stories out of madness since forever," Hugh explains. "It's what they do. It's all they do. If anyone can manage the actual process, it's them."

Morgan rubs his forehead. "Sounds dangerous. But then, if we're infusing the world with _this_ much Essence, there aren't any really _safe_ options around, are there?"

Hugh shakes his head. "Nope."

"With all the essence coming here, what will happen to other places? Like.. Creation, for instance." Charity is still trying to figure this out.

"If it doesn't stop coming, Creation is destroyed," Hugh says. "So, basically, this matter has to be settled. Don't ask me for a time, that's not how this works."

Benford nods, and lies down among the tall grass, arms crossed behind his head. "People are awfully demanding to you, aren't we, Hugh. I suppose you wonder why we don't get on with the heroics, like we're supposed to. But I wonder... we've got tens of thousands of damaged souls in Tijuana. This thing, is going to happen in two months. By then, many will have died of complications or starvation. Which way does the calculus of suffering go?"

"One month," corrects Charity.

"Well then just fix it," Hugh answers back, sounding a little curt. "I mean come on. What's stopping you?"

"My evil twin," Benford quips.

Hugh shakes his head. "Really? How's he doing that?"

Benford doesn't answer. He's either lost in thought, or his mind is wandering badly.

"I think it's time we do something," says Charity. "Rather than just contemplate it. A lack of action now is not conservative or cautious, it is irresponsible. This chaos we see before us isn't going to hold."

The youth nods. "The storm is here. Your ship is in it. Nothing you do will change that. But you can decide to put your hands on the rudder."

"It strikes me now just how enormous this situation is," adds Charity. "If we fail, there's a very real chance that everything dies. All life, all order could be undone."

Benford sits up again. "How do we steer?

"You _know_ how," Hugh says, smiling at Benford. "Go fix the people in Tijuana. Go stop your evil twin. Go make things right. You _know_ this! So do it."

"I will do what it takes to make a world that will be safe for humanity and for my own children, as well," says Charity. "I am no grand visionary, I have only my physical prowess and my desire to protect to lean on." She looks to Benford and Morgan, "Beyond this, I'm relying on you to decide what the future will look like. You are Lawgivers. It is what you were meant for. My strength alone cannot shape the future."
