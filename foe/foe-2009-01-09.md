Tenochtitlan gave way to Mexico City in 1521. Today the ancient city houses almost 20 million people. Somewhere in this city is an Alchemical stronghold. The Man is in search of it. Newton Benford wants it. It will be up to Charity to find it.

Twenty million souls and another small city's worth moving in every year. It makes for one hell of a haystack. But the needle is there, and the others are looking to Charity to find it.

The Lunar's first goal is to get a feel for the city. For her, the approch is holistic, and it starts in the places where hope for most has been lost. Burglars, addicts, prostitutes and thugs make a good traffic in the city, and with most police for sale, Charity has no shortage of access to things she has no official right to see.

What she is looking for is a void, a hole in the heart of the city. Attempting to escape all notice over time inevitably will leave something to trace. If there is no sound made by her quarry, Charity will seek silence instead.

The obvious places to look are quickly covered. With a smile and a tease she has officials eager to help her in the city government. The thought of owning a beautiful woman sways many minds. Charity is able to learn about building permits and civic planning in short order. A little more digging and it's clear that she can even hear about those projects that were not quite so authorized.

At night, when the nice people are resting snug in their beds the Lunar combs the dregs of society. She's interested in things far out of the norm. Of particular interest are changes in buying and selling. Major weapons sales, sudden changes in leadership, and any suspicious levels of cooperation in the generally fractured and contentious world of street gangs. A few heads get cracked to make it clear she is serious, and a few hoods gets wealthier when they realize that the out of town girl is not one to fuck around with.

During her search on the dark side Charity is also picking up cartel contacts. She flashes a fair amount of cash and spins a tale of Yakuza interest in new business that is at least partially influenced by her time in Japan. A couple young runaways try to drug her and rob her, but wind up with an ultimatuum that leaves them taking the role of assistants for as long as Charity feels like having them around.

Charity is no expert diplomat, but when the sun rises she makes a transformation. The street tough Yakuza slips into a five thousand dollar outfit and makes a point of forcing her new nieces to do the same. The Lunar uses her new, upstanding rich persona to make contacts in a local newspaper. Being eccentric and interested in a sizable investment gets attention fast. Of particular fascination to her are aliens and UFO stories. Mexico City has no shortage of weird tales, but knowing more or less what she's looking for will help the Full Moon separate the wheat from the chaff.

With so many approaches to cover, Charity still takes time to consider something completely different. The servants of Autochthon are orderly and logical. The Lunar believes that they likely cannot completely conceal their nature. She flies over the city with this in mind, studying intently things like traffic flow and then surveying city records to see what areas have utilty issues, where power is flowing, and where it is not, and, most importantly, where there is power, but should not be.

With the records of power sources in the city, Charity turns to Benford. She has estimates of how many buildings show signs of power and very strong intelligence concerning how much energy local powerplants are actively supplying, and where it is going to. She needs his mind to take this raw data and find any anomolies. She also needs some high class hacking to get a full 'heat map' of the city at night from a spy satellite.

For his part, Benford splits his days into thirds. Mornings are for Charity's new race. Tijuana isn't usually thought of as a center of research, but in the hands of a Benford and their associates, the Exalts can work literal miracles with even rudimentary facilities. Evenings are for the war. It takes just as much work to organize long-term care for the tens of thousands of comatose victims of the Alchemical assault, but fortunately, there is no shortage of survivors willing to train in the kind of nursing skills it takes. Benford personally dispatches an appeal for humanitarian relief, in the form of medical supplies, to the World Health Organization. And when the work at the clinic is done, he retires to the workshop to prepare for the inevitable battle in Mexico City. In addition to analyzing Charity's data, the scientist also tunes the Godskins and the modified Benellis.

And if those aren't enough... he's got one thin notebook that has never seen the light of day or the lens of a camera. In it he begins a project he would have once found distasteful, if not farcical... the means to attack an Alchemical through sorcery. But then, any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology, and it's far more refined than the weapons the Alchemicals have used against him.

Benford sleeps when someone reminds him - usually Esperanzita or Mokembe, and often with the help of Ambien. He regrets the indulgence, but there might not be much time to rest soon.

When he was a mortal reporter for the _Times_, Morgan used to do all his own fieldwork. But he has to admit, Jet's approach to the problem of ferreting out Mexico City's Alchemical hideout is highly effective; she's got raw charisma to spare, as well as more than enough physical prowess to deal with thugs on their own terms, and she is much better than he would've been at going where she isn't supposed to and getting what she isn't supposed to have. Still, there are some parts of the search that lend themselves more to the gifts granted to Morgan.

For example, interrogation. One evening, Charity brings back a gang leader who goes by "Rata" Lopez, sporting a black eye and several bruises, but nevertheless a hostile and defiant expression. The Lunar explains to Morgan that his underlings told her that some strange men had come to him offering a deal; but Lopez himself is refusing to tell her anything about the discussion, even after she asked "not so nicely".

Lopez refuses to talk to Morgan as well, at first - not surprising, since no matter how much he dresses down, Morgan tends to look a little bit too much like a cop. Accordingly, Morgan doesn't even try to talk about Lopez's mysterious visitors at first, instead endeavoring to engage the man on everyday topics; apparently Lopez is a big soccer fan, and although Morgan is not, his eclectic reporter's memory allows him to remember enough of half-watched games on television to let him bullshit convincingly on the subject.

Only once Morgan has managed to build up a tentative rapport with the gangbanger does he turn the conversation back toward more sensitive areas. Eventually, Morgan begins to get the outlines of a clearer picture. Lopez is _afraid_ of the men who came to talk to him; he didn't get to be a gang leader without a pretty good sense of people who are 'trouble', and those men were _big_ trouble.

In answer to this, Morgan introduces Lopez to some of Charity's militia. Drawn so heavily as it is from the ranks of the former gangs of Tijuana, they have a lot in common with Lopez, and soon they're talking avidly amongst themselves in rapid Spanish, with Morgan quietly listening in the background. Morgan doesn't get too much new information out of these exchanges, but his goal is to subtly introduce Lopez to the idea that his people, the Celestials, are willing to work with - and more importantly, protect - just about anyone who's got any sense of basic decency.

Once he's laid the basic groundwork, as well as having a chat with Charity, Morgan finally makes his pitch to Lopez. Though Morgan's way of words is much more fluid, it amounts to a basic bargain: information for safety. And if Lopez is still uncertain as to how much safety the Exalted can offer, it will be more than easy to give a demonstration that will knock his socks off.

The Man is given whatever information the other Celestials can provide - the more specific they can be, the narrower his search can become. And with the puissance of increasingly experienced Exalted, this does not take long to bear fruit.

Coyoacan is one of the boroughs of the Mexican Federal District. It's an upper-class suburb now, playing host to interesting sites such as the home of Leon Trotsky. It is also the site of a monastery called Churubusco. Supposedly erected over the temple of Huitzilopochtli (a Mexican god of the sun), the monastery has become the state-run Interventions Museum which documents the invasions of Mexico's territory. The Alchemicals must have been aware of the crowning irony of placing a base underneath such a site.

"So we know where they are," is Charity's rather abrupt beginning. "What do we do about it?" She has called together the Exalts, including The Man, to figure out precisely what the Solars mean to do, and what her role will be.

"My first priority is to find a remedy for the victims of the zombie disks," Benford says flatly. "My second priority is to do damage. I may end up having to kill my brother." He doesn't mention that he finds the idea subtly appealing; the idea of wiping out his own darkside stirs something in his viscera he can't describe.

"Are you sure you are up to that?" asks Charity. That slight appeal is something she can pick up in the tone of the Solar's voice. "The thing about killing is, you can start liking it."

Benford seems surprised for a moment; he hadn't expected to be so transparent. "I feel responsible for this thing," he says sullenly.

"You're both right," comments Morgan. "But the more important issue is the practical. Wheeler got away from us last time by just discorporating. How do you propose to solve the issue this time? Or do you think we can follow him into the Lands of Light from there?"

Charity smiles at Benford, "Newton, we work together. I will help you deal with the enemy, but don't lose yourself in revenge. I know what that path is like. I would hate to see you walk it."

Benford says, "We can try the Symbiogenesis chair. We used it to trap Taurus last time."

Morgan nods. "That's a start, though Charity's going to have to go to war form just to carry it. But it'll be hard to catch him off guard." He taps one of the brochures. "It says here that this used to be the site of a temple to a sun god. I know the raw Essence from such a thing is going to be weak, especially since it's not actively being worshipped, but I can't help but think we should be able to find _some_ way to turn that to our advantage."

Benford nods, slowly. "Well. A sun temple does sound like our kind of turf. So let's start with the first objective. A cure, or a countermeasure. The disks were probably manufatured at Churubusco. If we can get ahold of the secret of their fabrication, then we can engineer their removal. Do we have a map of this place?" His hand strays towards a laptop. Surely at least one government has taken satellite photos of the place, and either Marlene or a Raven user (and therefore Raven) would know how to find them...

"We have all of it," says Charity. "The government of Mexico City is very accomodating," she adds.

Benford says, "Any recent thermography? Underground installations? Sonograms?"

"Marlene has access to pretty much anything you want," says Charity. "She was telling me she could trace most of my movements for the past few years if I wanted her to."

Benford looks over the maps, trying to find something he's missed. "I'm no great strategist. It seems to me that we ought to go there, take a lot of friends, and stake the place out. When we're in place, we send in an infiltrator. And when we find what we're looking for, or it all goes pear-shaped, we go in. Heavily armed. This is no time for half-measures; we should be trying to find a role for everyone we know."

"It sounds like there's a very real chance that we have to take Wheeler alive," says Charity. "If the attack was his doing, it seems that his knowledge will be needed to reverse it. Killing him may need to wait."

"Then I'll rely on you to remind me of that fact when the time comes," Benford says evenly.

"Once we're done with him, though," says Charity, "His protection ends. We have to put an end to this rampant program."

Benford beings scribbling names on paper. "We've got about twelve people we know who can wade into a firefight, if we can get Tokugo to help. And I do hope we can; from what you've told me, this seems to be his thing."

"We can try," says Charity. "I just hope that he is not finding himself under siege already. We are putting all our eggs in this basket, in any case. If the enemy expects something like this, we're going to unleash World War Three in one of the most populated cities on the planet."

Morgan's mind is still on his earlier point. "Let me do some research on..." he pauses, then rolls the word off his tongue. "Huitzilopochtli and put together a fluff piece for the local dailies. Having a sun god's name on the lips of everyone in Mexico City can't hurt."

"One more thing." The Full Moon isn't going in blind. "We need to be ready in case Wheeler does the same trick he pulled here in Mexico City. We don't want millions of casualties on our hands."

Benford nods. "Yes. Beyond strategy, the presence of a sun temple influences things... hmm. There will almost certainly be a Lands of Light access point inside... and maybe..." He trails off. "Let's get it started. Quick as we can. Whatever you're going to do, do it on the way."

Morgan grins. "Actually, the more I think about it, the more I like the idea of using Huitzilopochtli to our advantage. If we can come up with a specific mechanism to put some real power behind it... it'd be a nice symmetry to their attack on Tijuana, where they used _that_ area's local Essence against us." He taps his chin. "The trick is that we need something with powerful Essence. Benford, can you brainstorm with me on that as we go?"

Benford slowly breaks into a wide grin. "Yes... yes, that's the thing," he says. "And I think it will give us an edge on Wheeler, because I would never have thought of it.

After a moment, Benford adds, "I wonder if we could get a ceremony performed in Mexico City... masses for Esperanzita, so to speak. Can it be arranged, while we're tuning up to storm the monastery?"

"If you want, I can probably get them to worship me, Newton," replies Charity. "It seems to come easy these days."

Benford has never been a street-corner preacher before - or a street corner anything, for that matter. But he finds that the approach works here, as it did when they first came to Tijuana. Find the places where the confused gather, or the simply idle, and tell the stories of hope. He picks his subjects carefully, and proselytizes for a vision of the future.

Morgan takes a different approach to raising belief - a more hierarchical one. The local Catholic hierarchy is wary of the Solars, especially after the big Debut, but Catholicism has also been intensely practical about retaining the faithful, even at the cost of syncretism. So when Morgan invites Archbishop Carrera to have tea and cookies with himself and Esperanzita - with Esperanzita supplying the cookies in her own inimitable way - the process of canonizing Saint Esperanzita is begun in record time.

The highways crossing Mexico are long and empty, and Benford and Morgan have plenty of time to review the history and mythology of the region on the way to Mexico City. One thing that quickly becomes clear: the native mythos of the land is at a nexus of civilization, peace, and violence that is shocking to liberal western eyes. "The ancient Aztecs fed blood to their gods. Huitzilopochtli was their Sun God - and we can bet Helios is on the other side of that mask. Thousands of people were sacrificed for his favor." Benford shudders. "And when the Conquistadors came, the other nations allied themselves with the Spanish to bring down the Aztecs... the history of ancient Mexico seems like it's had an extended ritual woven into it already, using violence and one set of intruders to drive out another. That might work for us. In fact, I have to wonder if some of it was ready-made for this purpose."

"So let's make that the prayer, then," Benford continues. "It's an old story in this land. What we want, is for people to pray that the story gets told one more time. And that when the invaders and the vandals have done their worst to each other, the world will move on its way."

There is a second narrative Morgan wishes to write into reality, as a sort of complement to Benford's. The time has come to call upon the aid of Raven, as Morgan had hoped to do all along. This prayer is written in High Old Realm, as it is intended for the ears of gods rather than men, and its intent is simple. Should he and his companions pursue the Assembled into the Lands of Light, Morgan implores Raven to lend them his legendary wisdom, to protect their souls as Benford's Godskins protect their bodies.

The Churubusco is in a wooded area in a suburb of Mexico City. There are residential neighborhoods and other academic institutions nearby. Jet's contacts intimate that some of the nearby buildings have been dug out to serve as alternate entrances. Since there's no hope of locating them all, the Deliberative's small army fans out in pairs to the likely high and low points - including Carbon and Jaguar on the roof of the nearby convention center, both out of reach of the general public - and as reserve mayhem.

Two pairs are selected to act as infiltrators - Jet with Cam, and Morgan with Benford. All are Engine-equipped and heavily armed, with the combination of Jet, Cam, and the Major making for a lethal surprise when the time comes.

In addition to this frontline, Charity used her influence and raw intimidation to gain control of dozens of local police and several gangs. Shortly before the attack, a signal is relayed to them to be ready to drive out the true enemy of the people. A second signal will invite a coordinated and wild assault by this strange mix of massively armed warriors.

The entrance selected for the purpose is hardly imposing - an old blockhouse of cinderblocks and cheap mortar, part of the public works. The water line is also connected to the well system of the old fort, which is in turn connected to the cloister of the old monastery. Technically the passage was sealed, but two layers of crumbling bricks are hardly a serious matter in this case.

Before going into danger, Charity relays a brief message to Newton. "If something should happen, I've left several samples behind in the lab. I'm assured by the good doctor it should be more than enough to make my legacy happen." The Lunar focuses her attention on the cinder blocks and with a soft growl reaches out to the bricks. She doesn't punch through them, nor kick. Instead, her body changes, growing larger and more dangerously powerful. For her war form it is easy to sink her nails into the decaying wall and simply open a hole in it like a normal person would part curtains.

Benford nods, and loads Reason. "And there's still a copy of my mind in one of the grey cubes." He chuckles, recalling a song from his youth. "'I've got the brains, you've got the looks...'"

"We all seek immortality in our own ways, even while we court death," murmurs Charity before she plunges into the opening she's made.

"Let's make lots of mayhem," Morgan completes the phrase as he secures his Raven in his shirt pocket.
