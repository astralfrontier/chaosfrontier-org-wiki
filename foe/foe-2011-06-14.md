His fellow Exalted have traveled across the Chaos Frontier, seeking the unreliable wisdom of the Wyld in their search for the fetiches of Autochthon: those lesser souls of the Great Maker who can be broken, and thereby change his nature into something more benevolent.

That mission has altered itself somewhat with Hugh's revelations. As a nascent Primordial himself, either Gaia or Autochthon must be destroyed to make way for his ascendance. And without him, as avatar of humanity, mankind will always be at the mercy of some greater force.

Now Benford's time has come. Other forms of analysis have produced no results; exhaustive searches of the graph of extant entities tied to Autochthon has not borne fruit. Given that Gerhard and Cam were both fetiches, Benford briefly considered candidates like Axel - but he has since been recycled. Wheeler also seems out of the running, as a new creation, and a creation of Benford himself at that. For Autochthon had no hand in the crafting of the creature's soul, only its body and capabilities.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "make sense so far?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "(it's also going to be pretty fuckin hard to kill Wheeler from where you are)"

> (OOC) Benford says, "Reading..."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Yes."

> (OOC) Benford says, "So who, then. Hmmm. Let me think."

What else could it be? Autochthon has regained two things so far: his memory of humanity (courtesy of Gerhard, sent to sample one of its most prominent representatives) and his capacity to love (thanks to Cam's ultimate sacrifice). Now the Machine God looks into a mental mirror, questioning himself, and the activities of his agents on Earth have shown a corresponding level of disorganization. Whole communities of 'rogue' Alchemicals have sprung up, using the Assembled to protect humans without trying to assimilate them into unity.

> (OOC) Benford poses in

Benford has spent long hours staring at graphs representing his speculations on the composition of the Maker's soul, and many more hours scribbling arcane formulae across the whiteboards that cover the walls of his Tijuana laboratory. All he's managed to do so far is confuse himself and annoy his friends. His latest hypotheses all revolve around self-organizing systems; one workbench is piled high with textbooks on chaos theory, stochastics, and holographs of the Spark. "There is a hole in the world," he declares, though there's nobody else in the room, "and a hole in the word." He crumples up another wad of scrap paper and throws it in the trash. "Zen is the hole in a jigsaw puzzle with only one piece missing."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Go ahead"

---

Dream-logic is still logic with an absurd set of premises. Guided by the experiences of his predecessors, though still with a degree of hesitation, Benford crosses the boundary somewhere in South America. He expected to find what many travelers across the Frontier have found: some variant of the continent, however strange, dredged from the imagination of mankind. Instead he finds himself on a featureless plain of dust and dirt, staring at a sky entirely devoid of features. No sun, moon, or stars. The barest glow provides illumination, but no more. And it is cold - ever so cold.

> (OOC) FallGM has more

> (OOC) Benford says, "Go ahead."

"Hallo!" comes a voice from the distance. Benford wasn't expecting this either. Nor was he expecting a British accent. Too much time among Americans. The man who steps into his little ring of light is tall, lanky, with a mop of brown hair and curious facial features. He's dressed like he ought to be teaching at a low-rent Oxford wanna-be. "You must be Newton Benford. I'm the Doctor."

> (OOC) Benford stunned

> (OOC) FallGM says, "be stunned in character then"

"I've... heard of you," Benford stammers. He was expecting something horrible; he was _ready_ for any number of horrible things. But this? "The Wandering God, The Oncoming Storm, the man on whom Angels fear to tread." He looks over the Doctor's attire; bloody hell, this is how Benford dresses on his off days. "I like the tie," he says. It's weak, and stupid, but all that he can get past the state of shock.

"Oh?" The other man looks inordinately pleased, running fingers across the bow tie he wears. "I'm quite taken with it. Acquired it accidentally, you understand, but it shows taste to keep it, don't you think." And clapping his hands together, the Doctor continues. "Now, unless I'm quite mistaken, and I'm not, you're here to learn about the Labyrinth. And in return I've got a raaather pressing question for you, but we'll get to that." He pauses, with a bright smile. "You may not know the Labyrinth by that name, but it's why you're here."

> (OOC) Benford says, "What was the name of the young lady that controlled the Autogate?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "Livia"

"The Labyrinth?" Benford considers. "That sounds right. The Sparks - those are machines that I've been studying - look like labyrinths from most angles. Or possibly those connection graphs, drawn by Livia, showing the soft points between her parallel worlds... or... uh... the volume by Borges, the one with the infinite library in it..." Benford stops short. "Well, anyway, you're right, that's why I'm here."

The Doctor grins. "Not just that. The folds of your braaaiiin..." He gestures at Benford's head. "Complexity. Information _density_. And the requirements of computability..." He gestures into the darkness beyond. "My TARDIS is that way. We should get off this rock. This is Earth, by the way. Last planet left in the cosmos. Not even in its right place. It was towed here, oh, millions and billions of years ago. People trying to escape creatures called the Migou." And he starts walking. "Right, this way!"

> (OOC) FallGM can move on unless you got somethin

> (OOC) Benford hmm

> (OOC) FallGM says, "we're just gettin started here, and I don't want to run you out of time tonight :)"

Benford falls into step beside the Doctor. _Ah. Lovecraft. That was more what I was counting on._ "That's no mean feat. Did it work?"

"I was on my way to find out," admits the Doctor. He opens the door to his blue police box, easily the most incongruous element on this dead planetoid. The inside, Benford remembers, is bigger than the outside. And after a few minutes of manipulating controls, the Doctor announces a landing, and steps back outside. The TARDIS, and the two humanoids, now stand in the middle of what Benford guesses is a hedge maze. The growth is well-trimmed, geometrically even, and tall enough that one can't see over it.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "more"

> (OOC) Benford says, "I'll keep it shorter. Just needed to get into character."

"Labyrinths! You humans love mazes. Puzzles. Brain-teasers. But long before anyone had thought of computers, you were building ideas out of boxwood that would underpin everything that goes into the science of computers." The Doctor strolls down one lane of the maze, hands in pockets. "The point of a maze, of course, is to make it hard to get from point A to point B. You must work out the path. Normally by trial and error, but there's some heuristics to help you along."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "more"

"But a maze, a labyrinth, is a _necessarily computable object_. You negotiate the maze with your feet, and it could take hours. Exhausting. Or you could be a clever chap, hop in your heli-copter, and fly over it." The Doctor spins on one foot, grinning as he starts to walk backwards while facing Benford. "But the picture doesn't help, because the maze is still a maze. You've just shortened the time to find the connection, because you can use your eyes instead of your feet. Right?"

Benford grins; this is more fun than he expected to have. "I get it. The metaphor for complexity and determinism. Even if you're wise enough to find the perfect path with your eyes, it still takes a certain amount of time to walk the path with your feet, is that what you mean?"

> (OOC) Benford says, "And, conversely, no WORSE than a certain amount of time to walk ALL paths, because it's /necessarily/ computable.""

> (OOC) Benford says, "He MIGHT say that. c\_c"

> (OOC) Benford says, "But I don't want to run your show for you."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "goferit?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "this is as much your show as mine. there's a lesson here the universe has, and one that the universe wants to ask Benford to teach it."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Well, let's try this..."

"Cor-RECT," replies The Doctor. "Aaand if you're a bit on the slow side, it won't take longer than a certain amount of time to find the exit, because it can only take so long to walk all of the paths in the maze. Because it's _necessarily_ computable. So!" The Doctor stops, claps his hands together, and touches their tips to his chin. "Where does _that_ leave you, Newton me boy?"

Newton looks around. "Still in the middle of the bloody hedge," he replies, the frustration of months of fruitless labors creeping in. "But there's hope in perseverence, because if I keep at it, then I will eventually work it out, right?"

> (OOC) Benford says, "More"

The Doctor nods his head, the bright look of expectation staying put... even as he says, "Nnnno. With the help of your close friends, the support of a dozen or so major and minor deities, and the love of the whole human race behind you, at the rate you're going, all the stars in the sky will burn out first." A pause. "Sorry, that was a bit rude. Let's try it again, more quickly, shall we?"

> (OOC) Benford says, "How is that?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "so far so good. but taking back over."

> (OOC) Benford says, "OK"

"You see, your eyes and your feet both use the same algorithm." The Doctor points upward. "Try this path, try that path, rule out dead ends, remember promising leads. Fundamentally the only difference is _speed_. A maze of a given size becomes progressively harder to solve whether or not you cheat." He pulls a strange device from his pocket and begins tapping at keys on it. "Well, when I say cheat, I don't really mean 'cheat'. _This_ is cheating."

The maze begins to expand, contract, reshape itself. The hedges move of their own accord. "We aren't rearranging the pattern, mind you!" calls the Doctor. "Left right straight left left right and so forth. We're just exposing the topology." And taking a short step off to one side, he beckons Benford. And both men step into a long avenue, straight as an arrow. At one end is the entrance. At the other, the exit.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "more"

"Welcome to the Topozone, on the planet Meridia. 5400 A.D. or thereabouts. Maze for visitors from Earth. They give out these things to those who get bored or lost." The Doctor grins widely, holding up his toy. "It just rearranges things. The one straight path through the maze now _looks_ straight. The others loop back on themselves, or take on strange curvy shapes."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "go ahead"

> (OOC) Morgan has connected.

"Oh, wow," Benford replies. He pokes a hand into the hedge, feels a resistance; then kneels, and traces a pattern in the dirt. Though he moves his finger in a straight line, the furrow through the dirt twists and turns like an ancient river. "So to you and I, we're walking in a straight line, entrance to exit, but any other observer will see us twisting and turning through the labyrinth."

> (OOC) Benford says, "More"

Benford picks up a pinch of dirt and tosses it down the lane, watching it fall in complicated patterns of turbulence. "This must be how beings like Livia, and Hugh, and Autocthon see everything." Benford turns to the Doctor. "I wonder what we must look like to them, wandering around in the eddys and alleys? Is there any marvel for a God in the way we finite mortals blunder through fate?"

> (OOC) Benford says, "There's a question there."

The Doctor smiles sadly. "This is also a model for the human mind, of course." He gestures about him. "A certain type of bloke - two types, really, but I'll get to that - well, alright, lots of blokes - anyway. A certain sort of bloke has a certainty of thought and action to him. He knows what he's about, knows where he's going in life, walks straight ahead in his mind. Everything makes perfect sense to him. To others, those who aren't privy to his particular maze's right routes, he's going bizarrely about in circles."

> (OOC) Benford says, "IS there more?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "there is now, sure. :)"

"It all depends on whether he's really heading for the exit, though." The Doctor sniffs a bit. "And it's not like gods can just look into your mind and read out your own personal labyrinth without computing it. They just do it very very fast."

"That sounds like the Alchemicals," Benford says. "We've got some of them bent on invading Earth and enslaving Humanity, and an equal number setting up Gernsback utopias and shoring up the Red Cross." Benford toes the sand of the path. "Each of them is on some golden path or other. And not all on the same one."

> (OOC) Benford says, "I hope I'm keeping up here. You picked the single character in all fiction who I'd least want to disappoint."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "doin great."

The Doctor nods. "'The journey creates the destination,'" he quotes. "You said that. Or you will say that, and I heard it, and telling you means it's pretty probable that you will say it now. Because it's awfully clever. The route through the Labyrinth is always there in potential, because someone built it, and nobody creates an unsolvable maze. So you've got to find that bloke, and ask him." He pauses, and grins. "So who is it that created Autochthon?"

"Hmm," Benford murmurs. "Well, the simple answer is right there in the name. Autochthon - 'reflexive world'. He creates himself. But that's not the whole answer, is it? It's like the Queen using the royal 'We'. One way she's the mouthpiece of an Empire, and the other she's a person, Elizabeth Windsor. So," Benford continues. "The question I should be answering is: which part of Autocthon is speaking itself into existence? Who is answering the phone when we dial the Minister of Cybernetic Autopoesis?"

Benford notices that he's been pacing, a nervous habit he's loathe to reign in since escaping his wheelchair, and he's actually wandered a fair bit down the path. He looks sheepishly at the Doctor; the Doctor looks bemusedly back.

> (OOC) Benford says, "More"

But there's a lesson to be learned here. The Doctor twitches his eyes earthward, and Benford sees it. The soil of this place reflects twists and turns that Benford made, even walking such a short distance through the maze. He can see each individual footprint, he knows they must lead back to the doorway of the TARDIS; but the path is so convoluted and confused, it's making his eyes cross. "Right... it's not the same thing, anymore... so the thing that made Him... was Himself... back then. And He doesn't remember. _Can't_ remember."

> (OOC) Benford says, "OK?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "yes, and well reasoned."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Hold on a moment."

"Hang on," Benford says suddenly. He feels giddy; his British psyche has gotten to the answer before him, and he can't believe what he's about to say. "I'm sorry, I don't mean to break any rules, but... can you give me a lift? In your time machine? Back to the Old Maker?"

"With pleasure," grins the Doctor.

---

Benford steps out of the doors of the TARDIS, the Doctor behind him. This chamber is a vast, sophisticated network of technologies that defy analysis and comprehension. But at the end of a well-delineated walkway is a pedestal, and on that pedestal is something that has no place at all here. It's an old VT-102, a dumb terminal, for connecting to larger systems. A green cursor blinks patiently on the black screen, and the clumsy keys await user input.

Benford checks the screen: he seems to be logged in as guest on an antique mainfame. "Well, that's a good sign," Benford says softly. "If it had been a DOS prompt I think I should have wept in terror." He rolls up his screen and begins to type. There's precisely two people logged in at the moment: himself, and 'root'... the system supervisor. "Theodiplomacy indeed," he murmurs, as he finds and runs an ancient chat client.

> (OOC) Benford says, "So what does God have to say?"

\# MOTD INDICATES SYSTEM SHUTDOWN. PLEASE BE BRIEF.

Benford types: WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE USER WHO COMPILED AND INSTALLED THE NEW KERNEL PREDICATING SHUTDOWN?

\# AUTOCHTHON PLZ FINGER ROOT@LOCALHOST FOR PLAN

> (OOC) Benford hmm

> (OOC) FallGM says, "the unix metaphor is totally right here. o\_o"

> (OOC) Benford says, "No, wait, that's weak"

Benford raises an eyebrow, and does as instructed. "'Plan' file. Torvalds' said 'World Domination'. So what have we here..."

Plan for World Domination:

Have discovered humans as agency of destruction. This innate quality enabled them to excel at the War and defeat rogue Primordials. Alchemicals as agents of transformation lack sufficient memetic resonance to enable Oramus-level reconfiguration of reality. Alchemicals being repurposed into agents of personal transformation.

> (OOC) Benford says, "'Oramus'? Have we heard that name before?"

Hypothetical Transcendent Raksha Exalted equivalent, being as adept with destruction as Exalted humans are at creation. Use Alchemicals to bring mutually exclusive Essence into balance. Humans fulfilling their purpose will yield sufficient quantities of Essence to rebalance the cosmos along the New One's wishes. Only way to get them to fulfill purpose is to destroy current Gaian architecture, preserve Gaia's state, destroy me.

It will be necessary for the new version of me to accept my own destruction. Embed ability for humans to restore my conscience and sense of purpose toward them. Embed final component in Gaian core, currently under construction. Destruction of the Gaian Loom of Fate opens the five-day Calibration window in which I can be transformed_destroyed_reborn.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "you have indeed."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "that's what you find."

"'Oramus'," Benford repeats. That name came up recently, in a conversation with Andrew Morgan, after his latest trip across the veil. He looks back towards the Doctor. "Ever hear of an 'Oramus'?"

The Doctor shakes his head. But the terminal comes alive again.

\# ORAMUS. THE FIRST THING. THAT WHOSE EXISTENCE IS DEFINED BY ITS NONEXISTENCE. PARADOX.

Benford nods. This part, at least, has become clear. WHEREIS ORAMUS

\# NOWHERE.

"That's going to make finding him a bit of a trick," Benford says.

\# NO NEED. WHEN YOU HAVE DESTROYED THE CORE AND DEFEATED ME, THE REST WILL SEE TO ITSELF. BUT YOU WILL ONLY HAVE FIVE DAYS.

\# PLEASE PROVIDE SPECIFIC ACCESSIBLE VECTOR FOR CORE

> (OOC) Benford says, "I have a feeling that this is a bit like opening that final door, at the bottom of the last dungeon, that begins the End Boss Fight."

\# LANDS OF LIGHT. SPEAK WITH OLDEST SIDEREAL EXALTED YOU CAN FIND FOR DIRECTIONS.

> (OOC) Benford says, "I'm not sure that I have enough here to proceed. Every other time we've gotten a name of a Fetich. I think Oramus is that Fetich. But I'm not sure what the five-day warning is about."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "Oramus is very much not a fetich."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "if you're not sure about the warning, ask"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "changing the cosmos at Oramus' level: if the story that 36 told Morgan is correct, think of Oramus as the mythic nickname for the first of many qualia"

Benford frowns. "Five days? I'm missing something here." IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPERVISORY PROCEDURE WE MUST PERFORM DURING THE FIVE-DAY CALIBRATION WINDOW? ANY ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WHO MUST BE PRESENT?

\# ALL EXALTED ABLE TO BE MUSTERED. ALL WEAPONS OF WAR ABLE TO BE DIRECTED AT A PRIMORDIAL BEING. HOLD NOTHING BACK.

Benford performs a check of the system clock. It seems to indicate a reboot scheduled in just a few minutes; on the other hand, the time isn't actually advancing. Or at least, not advancing as fast as he'd expect. He steps away from the terminal, and gives the 'Doctor' a long look.

The Doctor smiles sadly. "And now, Newton Benford, I need you to answer my question. Are you ready?"

"Almost," he says softly, "but there's one problem with this plan. We've got two different editions of the Maker. The Old one, that Jet and Cam met, who was quite fond of us - fond of humanity. And the new one, to whom we're just... I don't know, spare parts. Sources of error. For this to work, we've got to give the new Maker back, that part of himself that was left behind in the old."

> (OOC) Benford says, "More"

"I can imagine that being," Benford continues, and there's sorrow in his voice. "Lonely, nameless, the first and last of its kind. Free to roam all over space and time, constantly watching over his beloved humans... but not one of them. Not one of us. And never, ever giving his name." Benford shakes his head. "I thought you were just a figment of our national imagination. But if you're anything at all like the face you're wearing, or he's at all like you, then..." Benford sighs. "It shouldn't be me, doing this. I'm the best the real world has to offer, and I'm not worthy."

"Yes, well. Answering my big important question before I get to ask. Rather cheeky," the Doctor comments. And he fishes a key out of his pocket, tossing it Benford's way. "You'll be able to pilot it back without problem. I need to stay here. Few last loose ends to see to, you know."

"Ask it anyway," Benford invites. "Things mightier than us won't be happy if the forms aren't obeyed. The Journey Creates The Destination. The destination of this journey, is that a question is asked and answered."

> (OOC) Benford says, "There's a purpose here, if he'll play along."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "he won't, since he's a curmudgeonly old cuss."

Walking to the terminal, the Doctor pauses. "It was such a _good_ question too," he speaks aloud, but mostly to himself. "Dr. Benford, you're so very worthy, I'm embarrassed to tell you. You humans, always doing the impossible. The god of death, so alive, so amazingly _alive_!" His mood seems to have improved. "Preparing yourself to risk everything, all for the sake of your future. You're indomitable. Indomitable!"

As he begins typing, he turns his head over his shoulder. "Very well. My question to you was this: am I real?"

Benford chuckles. He rolls up his sleeves, and begins to pace along the small path. "Now there hangs a tale, and here it is." He pauses for breath. "Beyond the boundaries of our universe is a realm of infinite possibility, where anything and everything can and will happen and has happened. But it's everything and nothing: all possibility and no certainty. And in the dread pit of our universe, is an oblivion where everything ends. And there's nothing there for us, either: no joy, no hope. All certainty and no probability."

"It takes something special to make the world in-between," Benford continues. "Where things change all right, but according to patterns and rules, or as we call them, Laws of Nature. Without those laws - without even their _possibility_ - engines of destruction is all we _could_ be. That fine balance between order and choice is what gives us meaning."

"We've invented so many ways to understand that balance," Benford says. "So many ways of knowing, including the one that I've chosen... Science. The systematic and disinterested pursuit of those laws from the inside... everyone thinks it's so dry and sterile, but Oh! the wonder it's stirred up in the souls of scientists. Whether we know it or not - and whether we like it or not - every experiment, every theorem, every paper we publish and lemma we make or break, it's a prayer to the being that wrote those laws in the first place."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Two more will finish it, I think."

"The adventure of Science," Benford continues, "is to voyage through the tapestry of nature woven by those laws. Through science, we've peered back in time to photograph the very birth of the universe. We didn't just dig up Vesuvius, or Pompeii, or Luxor; we went back in time to meet the people that lived there, to know them, to share their hopes and sorrows and dreams. We've flown forward in time to a dozen different ways the universe can expire, with a bang or a whimper. We may never know it all; we may never reach any destination. We don't have to. Being finite and flawed as we are, means that we'll always have something new to discover."

> (OOC) Benford says, "One more"

"Gaia promised vengence upon us," Benford says, becoming serious. "But she also promised to tolerate man's sins until memory of our works have gone from the world - a chance to learn from our mistakes. And the one who is coming, promised that as long as scientific zeal endures, we will be remembered. It is, and ever shall be, the Heroes of Science, in their voyages through space and time, who shoulder the task of defending mankind from the hostile universe. Literally and figuratively." Benford stops and turns to face the Doctor. "In every language, there are words that mean Wise Man, Healer of the Sick, Earl of Space and Lord of Time! By all of these do I name you, first and greatest Hero of Science! 'Am I real?' My dear Doctor... yes, you are, and we are with you always."
