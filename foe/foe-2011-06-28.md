From Earth, the destruction of Autochthonia is also the death of the Exalted. Every last one of them joined the fight; and as the artificial planet disappears amidst the reification of the cosmos, the realization of what Earth has lost begins to sink in.

Along with the Exalted themselves, much of the military force of the planet has gone. The nuclear arsenal of the superpowers is gone. The soldiers and generals are a more irreplaceable resource.

A few hints of conflict begin to break out. They are stifled just as quickly. The Exalted's faith in humanity, expressed in a few terse phrases at the Core, is not misplaced. The local militia and self-defense programs were accustomed to fighting Alchemicals. They lack the motivation to fight now against their fellow man, but they most certainly don't lack the stomach.

And what of the Alchemicals and their works? Gone, as though they never existed. Autochthon spent the totality of his Essence in a defense against mankind, siphoning energy even from his creations to power his assisted suicide. What's left are car parts, rubber hoses, and all the other artifice of man which the Assembled used to craft their bodies.

"Generation A" is the name given to the children of this new world, the ones whose lives were transformed by the coming of godhood to the planet. They live in the shadow of the destruction of Autochthon. For them religion is no theory, nor is faith a prerequisite for worship. What differs are the particulars, for the Exalted left no strong guidance on how to live or what to believe.

Many are the orphans that war has left behind. For them, the helping hand of humanity is extended. Children are taken in; families are reunited, or newly formed. Three such children insist on remaining together, no matter what.

Fusion power has solved the needs of the world. Developing nations are given enough information to build their own power plants. Enough energy can transform desert sand into usable glass. Enough power can desalinate seawater. Even a small trust fund, set up from a pittance of the proceeds of this work, is enough to keep such a family united.

Ten years pass. The trio have grown to adulthood.

Timothy hasn't wasted his mathematical aptitude. He has joined CERN as a research physicist. Ana hasn't given up her hopes of becoming a doctor, but for the moment she is a happy-go-lucky, light-hearted hellraiser. Becca has begun to find herself, and under apprenticeship to Lexington Dallas she has taken up journalism.

None of them have settled down with anyone yet; there's still too much life left, and the inseparable bond the trio share is much like family. As close associates of the vanished Exalted, they remain celebrities and command attention wherever they go.

> (OOC) Morgan has connected.

And when Ana pulls up in front of the building on her motorcycle, revving and shouting, Timothy comes jogging out and hops on. When they meet with Becca at a local bistro, she has news for them.

A new movement called "Big Science" is emerging. Major-scale engineering projects, computer-guided, using the radical evolutionary algorithms used by the Alchemicals in their conquest of Earth. Now the people involved in the project have announced the accomplishment of their goal. They have devised a mathematical model that they claim will describe all science, current and future. The prosaic name for it is the Science Description Language, but Becca calls it Ontologic.

Based on this, Big Science thinks it should be possible to _evolve_ new science. They have the enthusiastic support of the dozen or so new religions which figure Gaia as a goddess in their pantheon, as well as the reluctant backing of the world's scientific community.

And while Ana wolfs down apple pie, Timothy looks serious. "Is this the world we've been left?" he asks quietly. "Are we to accept science from heartless machines after all?"

"'There can be no understanding between the hand and the brain unless the heart acts as a mediator,'" quotes Becca with a smile. "Humans are still in charge of what gets done with it."

"But humans can't be trusted with it," grits Timothy, squeezing his hands into fists. "I _know_."

And Ana puts down her fork, sliding a hand over that of her 'brother'. "Charity, Newton and Andrew bet their lives on the idea that we could be," she murmurs quietly. Becca nods along, and Timothy's face softens into a smile.

"Alright. Then they're counting on us to make sure of it."

A hundred years pass.

Ship after ship has launched itself into the Void on a quest for redemption, for territory, or for curiosity. The Solar System plays host to humanity in all its variations. The first interstellar vessel has been traveling for decades.

The First Orbital War taught mankind a stark lesson about space dominance. Black biotech allows human modification and the creation of 'biogadgets'. Space is no longer a forbidding wasteland.

And then - news! The _Mayflower_ has arrived at its destination. Their radio signal indicates that colonization of an exoplanet is proceeding as expected. Humanity will survive, and spread. Nothing can stop it now.

---

Two hundred fifty years pass.

The surface of the Earth is no longer habitable. Between global pollution levels, anthropogenic climate change, and what some call "Gaia's curse", normal land-based life is simply no longer feasible.

Of course, that doesn't stop some people. Antarctic settlers, a mixture of American, Chinese and other ethnicities, have banded together and are perfecting their own form of biotechnology for extended underwater life. Enclaves of settlers and survivors - colonists on their own planet - make their way in aerostats or in covered domes.

It was only fifty years ago that faster-than-light travel was developed. Most of mankind is gone from the system. Their fates lie now among the stars. Those who remain are the desperate, the religious, or the proud.

But they all have something in common. They remember the Exalted, and their sacrifice. Theirs is the flame that will burn in the deepest darkness. Theirs is the beacon of hope that shines like a light-house to the vessels plying the Void, showing that wherever men go, there is always a way home.

Creation has gone dark. The Essence of the world - the most concentrated reserve of Essence in the cosmos - was tapped heavily to make the destruction of Autochthon possible, even in low-energy conditions.

In one sense, though, it hardly matters. The Realm Defense Grid was used to defend against the Fair Folk and other powerful enemies, but no such enemy has appeared. The Fair Folk have gone.... somewhere else.

The gods are gone. They've been reduced to stories and tales, in a codex kept at the end of the universe. Fewer and fewer humans are born in Creation. The souls of mankind are traveling to their new temporary home.

Benford and his dark mirror fused into something new. The Unconquered Sun and his shadow met mutual annihilation, and as a result the role of the god was handed over to a human - formerly unthinkable. Now it seems that Creation itself is dying off, or disappearing. Will it also become something new?

The new Primordial walks openly among men in Creation. He is no longer the fair-haired youth Hugh. He has awakened to his potential and his power. He is now known by his proper name: Humanity.

He preaches of a time when all mankind must pass away from Creation. He speaks of a great accumulation of Essence that must happen, and a journey to seek paradise being undertaken by people elsewhere. He speaks of the end of Malfeas, and the release of all demonkind, but in his tales this is no apocalypse.

A thousand years pass.

Space, in a radius of ten thousand light years in every direction, has felt the touch of mankind. Humans live at the edge of the galaxy, staring at nothing but inky blackness in half of their sky. Humans farm antimatter from the galactic core, shipping it back to their home stars.

In a space station orbiting a variable star, a man clasps his hands behind his back as he watches through a viewport. The scene before him is a series of smaller craft servicing a large interstellar vessel. The craft proposes to journey again into the Void - for science, for honor, for hope - and this man has made its latest trip possible.

The man himself should be an impossibility. He is of genetic stock a millennium old, transmitted through the centuries as the most valuable piece in the Mokembe Memorial Collection. Reconstituted in a vat, and given an education using the Personal Daemon AI, taught the memories of old Earth, he was nevertheless given ever chance to make his own way. His creators were secretly proud when he declared his interest in continuing his ancestor's work.

"It'd take a miracle to get this drive realignment finished today," comes a voice over the radio, reaching into his ear. And the man smiles. "I believe in miracles, Mr. Godfrey. Make it happen, if you can."

"Yes sir," answers the voice. Newton Benford Junior allows himself a smile.

In the jungles of Canada, the city of Hubris tries desperately to spread like a miles-wide insect across the landscape. Centuries-old automation harvests scrap metal from the ruins at its borders, builds new machines. Centuries-old military automation target and attack the repair efforts.

The citizens of Hubris know that this is happening. They can't stop it; nobody really can. Nobody really tries any more. That's just how it is.

The city does have one thing - the so-called Charity Cases. Children in stasis, waiting until someone can manage to break the perpetual warfare that permeates Hubris.

Today, the enigmatic locks that keep their stasis tubes sealed have received their key. Today, they open.
