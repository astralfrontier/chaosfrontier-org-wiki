# Unsorted Notes from G+
A brief stupid thing I showed to a couple friends this week:

On an index card, write a brief thing ("Magic Sword", "Strongest In the Village"). On the flip side, write down a list of things that are downsides, twists, or unintended consequences of that (e.g. "I can be disarmed", "I break stuff easily") - complications you are inviting by possessing that quality.

When the thing on that card would give you a success in your action, flip it over. When one of the things on the flip side comes to pass (because you, another player, or the GM narrated it), flip the card back again.

All that's left is.... the entire rest of the game that would use this.

----

I threw together a version of the flip-a-card game I'd talked about previously. The rules:

1. You have a set of polyhedral dice (d4-6-8-10-12) and 3 blank index cards.
2. On the front of each card, write a verb or noun that's important to your PC. ON the flip side, write 3-5 interesting consequences, complications, or twists arising from being or having that thing.
3. During play, say what you do, and roll a die. The die starts at d4.
4. A roll of 3 or less succeeds, 4 or higher fails. IF your narration included one of your cards somehow, AND you fail, do nothing. Otherwise, start using the next die up (e.g. d4 to d6) when you roll again.
5. You can flip over one of your cards at any point in this process; if so, you automatically succeed BUT you lose the benefits of having that card. It's as though the die were never rolled.
6. If one of the conditions on the flip side of that card comes to pass, flip it back, and your die is reset to d4. This can be part of the same action.

Example: you start at d4 and say "I attack kobolds with my whip". You roll d4, getting a 3. Your d4 goes to d6.

The kobolds counter-attack, you narrate defending with your acrobatics. You roll d6, getting a 5. You can either accept the failure, or flip your acrobatics card.

If one of the conditions on that acrobatics card ("I fall", "lose an item", whatever) happens in the fiction, flip it back, and go back down to d4.

Early feedback:

- Provide plenty of sample cards for players who aren't used to writing a dozen or more "succeed at a cost"/soft move outcomes at game start. Let people construct new characters from these predefined elements, then customize to taste.
- Provide some context and tone so that it's understood what a failure can cost you in the fiction. Related to that, consider providing a default setting.
- The system encourages a lot of rolls to see flips happen. Don't be afraid to call for them.
- Provide "situation cards", e.g. a "Kobold Camp" card with a bunch of outcomes, e.g. "reinforcements", "ambush", "boss appears", letting a group pick & choose how a situation unfolds.
- Evaluate a damage system whereby taking a hit removes the lowest die the player has to roll with, e.g. a flip takes me back to d6 rather than d4 after one hit. You restore your dice after downtime or between encounters.
- Provide meatier fictional outcomes that are available for a card, e.g. "if you have this magic bow, you can make shots at amazing range" or other one-off things. These might also be expendable, one-use cards, or things that reset under more specific conditions.
- Evaluate a policy whereby fiction blocks you from using a card, e.g. "I'm disarmed but I have a Magic Sword card, so can I use it?" Either such things don't happen, or players phrase them differently.
- Find ways to establish synergies between cards or otherwise make "character builds" or "combos" an interesting replay element - find ways to avoid mechanical sameness.

For flip-a-card, some early feedback was interesting and hopefully useful: how to do card combinations. Here's an example.

Say that you've got "manifestations", or ways you channel magical power: Hero (physical or intellectual power), Galvanist (elemental energies, e.g. lightning), Mesmerist (mental manipulation), Zoanthrope (animal control, shapeshifting), and Evoker (summoning & conjuring magical beings).

We also have social classes or positions, including Old Name (you come from a famous family), Artisan (you're a middle class craftsperson or skilled professional, as opposed to merchant), or Soldier.

We have some personality cards, like Plucky, Hard-Bitten, or Eccentric.

Finally there's also conditions, or ways to take damage, including Hurt, Embarrassed, and Obliged. You don't start with these in play, they're given out and taken away by circumstances.

Combination cards give you special abilities when you have two or more specific cards in play. Here's a few examples:

Heraldic Summon (Old Name/Evoker): Your evoked creatures are noble or iconic creatures from the Empire's mythology (dragons, gryphons, etc.), commanding a particular fear or respect from onlookers.

Precision Shaping (Artisan/Galvanist): You have great control over your elemental eruptions, and can craft them into pleasing or useful shapes rather than just expressions of nature's power.

Icon of Strength (Hero/Hurt): Achieve some overtly superhuman feat of physical might by transforming your pain into passion.

Dog of War (Soldier/Zoanthrope): become a stronger, tougher animal, optionally with some kind of armor, rather than just an "ordinary" animal.

More iteration on flip-a-card.

Players have one "guest" card. They can trade this card in and out at any time, unless a card says otherwise. This is intended for players to tune their PCs for specific scenes, wound modifiers, or whatever.

Building enemies out of adjectives. I've got a "Barbaric" "Boss" "Kobold" made of those three cards. "Barbaric" has flip-side text like "lick blood off your weapon", "bellow savage challenges", and the like. "Boss" says stuff like "can absorb a few hits" or "has minions". If you run out of interesting things to do with an adjective card, it's gone. These adjective cards are intended to act as shields for the real target - basically, more interesting opponents are also tougher.

PCs should also be able to pull in cards like "barbaric", either as guest cards or as regular characteristics.

This is still a work in progress. I'm hoping to address concerns like "is the game replayable" and "is there a more tactical element to card use". I'm still also debating dice vs. other stuff.

----

One goal for flip-a-card is composition. Here's how that might work for situational cards and combination cards.

I have three cards: Abandoned, Burning, and Warehouse. When the characters enter the scene, we lay out Abandoned + Warehouse, that being where they are at the moment.

One character is a Mesmerist, who can normally interact with people psychically, but in this case can also tap into the memories and histories of things. She has a card called 'Forgotten Echoes', a combination of Mesmerist and Abandoned, so when she enters any kind of abandoned place, she can ask for a special read on what used to be here. Entering the warehouse, she flips the card to invoke the power, and learns something.

The party gets jumped by some bad guys, a lantern is knocked over, and the place catches fire. Now it's an Abandoned Burning Warehouse. Another character, a Galvanist, can manipulate elemental energies, including fire. This qualifies them to flip the Burning card over to buy success on an action, if they channel their power into the flames.

On the back of Burning are twists like "something important is damaged", "the fire spreads", "someone's route is cut off". If the character wants to make use of Burning a second time, they can invoke one of those twists to flip the card back to its top side and do so.

Why does one of these situations have a combo card and the other does not? If the Mesmerist's overall power set included "seeing into the past", they could skip the combo card. Normally, using a power like that isn't part of being a Mesmerist - but it can be part of that specific Mesmerist's powers. That's when you'd write a combo card.

Condition cards for Fairy Soul/flip-a-card. There's a "weak" and a "strong" level for each condition, and you can flip the card to succeed at an action but aggravate it to the stronger level. You can clear a condition by spending a scene (weak) or downtime (strong) attending to it. As usual, if the fiction removes a condition, the card goes away too.

Hurt / Wounded

Top Side: You've been physically injured. You might be bloodied, stunned, or feeling ill. Flip this card to succeed at an action and aggravate the condition. Spend a scene attending to the condition to clear it.

Flip Side: Your injuries are severe. You have lost blood, broken a limb, or otherwise ended up in bad shape. Spend downtime attending to the condition to clear it.

Embarrassed / Shamed

Top Side: You've been placed in an awkward social situation. You must speak and act delicately to extricate yourself. Flip this card to succeed at an action and aggravate the condition. Spend a scene attending to the condition to clear it.

Flip Side: Significant damage has been done to your reputation, rightly or wrongly. You cannot face society without repercussions. Spend downtime attending to the condition to clear it.

Obliged / Indebted

Top Side: You've incurred a financial or other responsibility. Your creditor may hold this over your head or ask for small favors. Flip this card to succeed at an action and aggravate the condition. Spend a scene attending to the condition to clear it.

Flip Side: You have significant debts that demand your time or attention. Spend downtime attending to the condition to clear it.

Weakened / Ill

Top Side: You've exerted yourself, or been mildly hurt, and need time to rest. Flip this card to succeed at an action and aggravate the condition. Spend a scene attending to the condition to clear it.

Flip Side: You have nothing left to give, and can barely move or act. Whether serious exhaustion or actual illness, take time and rest. Spend downtime attending to the condition to clear it.

Spotted / Exposed

Top Side: Your powers or presence are at risk of detection. Tread lightly and take it down a notch. Flip this card to succeed at an action and aggravate the condition. Spend a scene attending to the condition to clear it.

Flip Side: Somebody knows you're here or that you are wielding supernatural might. Any chance of a discreet exit is gone, and you may face pursuit or panic. Spend downtime attending to the condition to clear it.

Unstable / Fey

Top Side: Your fairy soul is fitful or waking, causing your magic to go awry. Strange, beautiful, mad things will happen if you use your power. Flip this card to succeed at an action and aggravate the condition. Spend a scene attending to the condition to clear it.

Flip Side: Your mind is partially lost to Arcadia, and your fairy stirs. Speak in riddles and craft the world's dreams into art. Spend downtime attending to the condition to clear it.

I've got a deck of flip-a-cards ready for Fairy Soul. Here's some lessons I've learned, and lessons I still need to learn:

Card creation demands poetry. You need a good turn of phrase for the card text and evocative twists that sell your setting immediately. Some phrases I'm personally proud of: "Stand in defense of another's dreams", "Take an exciting risk", and "Strange, beautiful, mad things will happen if you use your power." all hopefully tell you something about the world you're in. But those phrases are just about all the space you have to make that sale.

Create a few standard rules, use them everywhere, then encourage exceptions. There's a few cards, particularly combo cards, where the card is just gonna make up some nonsense for you to do. But most of the time, your character & scene cards should be pretty conventional: flip me over to succeed, flip me back if I complicate your life.

There's a sweet spot for number of unique mechanics. Right now I have three basic ones: tests (and how you succeed at them), whatever flipping a particular card does, and recharge. Would more hurt the game? Am I at the right point? I need to find out.

The mechanics feel like they'll encourage a style of play. But what is that? This is the big unknown. I don't know that the cards are a good fit for Fairy Soul. I feel like I need to play this game to point the way to that game, the one where the cards make a setting or theme really shine. I'm pretty okay building a new game around a mechanic, rather than a fictional theme, I just want to make sure I build the right game out of the mechanic I have.

A lot of previous ideas went into this, and I like seeing what I can do with it. I think it can be interesting to play. I just need time, and people.

----

Putting stock card rules on another card, with symbols, cut down my effort by like 90%. If I know ahead of time what my setting is, and a good idea of how to build characters, I can probably crank out a deck in 30 minutes.

I'd also want to seed it with some common scene/situation cards. Right now I have Burning, Dark, Guarded, and Tense cards written. I'd also want specifics, e.g. Mansion, Alley, Warehouse, but I think those might be too situational.

In terms of variability, writing 6 anchors, 6 manifestations, and 8 trait cards gives 288 starting points. If you let players start with one two-card combo as a power (e.g. always-on Charm Person for a Roguish Mesmerist), there's 380 possible such combos, for over 100,000 possible PCs just based on the cards.

So there's a lot of thematic variability. Is there enough mechanical variability to keep players interested? That's something I need to find out.

If you break down D&D 5th edition, setting aside spells (which are really their own thing), you really have these things to work with on an ongoing basis:

* ability checks
* attack and damage rolls
* saving throws
* unique rule-breaking features from your class, ancestry, background, etc.

There's a funnel from a lot of features, plus Inspiration, that all pours into advantage/disadvantage, which changes how many dice you roll. And there's stat and proficiency bonuses, which either apply to a given roll or they don't. So really, there's... when you roll for something (and what it gets you), whether you're rolling one die or two, and how much to add to it. If you can be mechanically interesting with that relatively small number of chokepoints, and just move all the highly variable triggering and outcome stuff out onto features or spells or whatever, then I feel pretty good, because that's my exact scenario.

----

Early playtest feedback on flip-a-card is very positive. We'll see what happens with multiple players in action, and we'll be testing things like more cards, or features that went untested like combo cards.

I'm starting on a Peppermile deck, and am trying to figure out how to divide up character cards. Here's what I have so far.

- Ecological niche: basically what kind of animal hybrid you are: Predator, Forager, Social Species, etc. Most of the benefits will be immediate, physical or sensory, and have appropriate emotional twists on the flip side.
- Faction: two to three variations within one of the three factions on the planet (Cats, Choir, or Zoo). Some of the rarer factions (Spacers, Outsystem Traders) probably won't have pre-written PC cards, but could still be played.
- Motivation: Curiosity, Knowledge, Revenge.. whatever major drive keeps your character going.

There's a fourth type of card, called Kit: the equipment you carry around or are familiar with, such as Hunter, Soldier, Medic, Pilot, and so on. Unlike the other types, you can change your Kit anywhere you can find the appropriate gear, letting the party tune themselves for whatever situation they're going into.

Most of the condition cards from Fairy Soul will carry over, except stuff like Embarrassed (shame being a more Edwardian thing...) and Unstable. Instead, there's a condition that's something like Wild, Feral, or Savage, indicating animal instincts coming to the fore.

I can re-use about 50% of the location cards, and some will be all new (Jungle, Shuttle, Coral Cave...).
