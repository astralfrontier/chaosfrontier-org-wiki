# Example
## Forks
Things that aren't Forks:

* "Make a Perception check, if you fail, you don't notice"

Things that are Forks:

* "Let's just roll to see what happens" (as long as you have some possible outcomes in mind)

### Forks and Dice
"I want to pick the lock on the door". People come up with some outcomes, worst to best:

1. The door opens but someone's on the other side
2. Your lockpicks break
3. The lock opens but there's a trap
4. It works out fine, the door clicks open

Player rolls a d8 (4 outcomes x 2). On a 1-2, the door beaks, on 3-4 the lockpicks break, 5-6 there's a trap, 7+ it opens.

If the player has an active card like "Thief", add +1. If they have "Thieves' Tools", add +1. And so on. If the door is "Reinforced" or the scene is "Guarded" or whatever, -1 per card. The player could instead flip "Thief" to automatically succeed, but can't flip it back until a consequence of Thief happens.
