# Core Cards
## About This Game
## The Facilitator
## Forks
Top side:

* Announce a Fork when a fictional decision or situation is uncertain
* The group names 2-5 potential outcomes
* Players can generate Hits using rules on other cards
* Any player that gets a Hit picks the outcome they want
* If nobody gets a Hit, the group may choose or decide randomly

## Dice
Top side:

* When a Fork happens, sort 2-5 outcomes in order of player preference
* Roll one die whose face is 2x the number of outcomes, e.g. d6 for 3 outcomes
* 1-2 gives the most preferred outcome, 3-4 the second, 5-6 the third, etc.
* Add 1 to the roll for each face-up card (up to 3) that makes things worse
* Subtract 1 for each face-up card (up to 3) that makes things better

Flip side:

* When a Fork happens, sort 2-5 outcomes in order of player preference
* Roll one die whose face is 2x the number of outcomes, e.g. d6 for 3 outcomes
* 1-2 gives the most preferred outcome, 3-4 the second, 5-6 the third, etc.
