# When our team first came together...
> Rivet: We fought a terrible enemy from my old life. Who was it and what did they take from me?

There was an older kid, someone else with powers, that Lifehack had powered up even further than me. His name was Sebastian. I had a pretty neat uniform, threaded with wires and other metal stuff, and he broke it and hurt me pretty badly. I look a lot less cool now.

And he was my friend and kind of like big brother, so there's that.

*Sebastian has Fire-based powers, centered around destructive fireballs.*

> Willow: We saved the life of someone important, either to the city or to us. Who was it? Why are they important?

We saved a former superhero at a place where Levi volunteers. Mr. Auster's old crony, some old inventor dude. Statler & Waldorf style relationship. Waldo/In-Cog-Nito.

> Riptide: We totally broke some major rules to win the fight. What rules did we break? Whose rules were they?

> Leviathan: Our victory secured an important resource for A.E.G.I.S. What was it?
