# Session 1 - 2020-04-04

## At school

* People getting to school! Crossing a bridge to a domed area. Levi has a dorm. Willow takes the bus. Rivet bikes.
* Did we maintain contact? Levi did. Riptide will harass Willow.
* What does Willow's hero costume look like? Bright-colored leggings under regular civilian clothes, loose-fitting top that goes over t-shirts. Very Day-of-the-Dead inspired look.

* We arrive at the same time. There's electrical/magical floating arrows pointingg the way to the courtyard. Students are waiting for Hellbinder to come give his speech.
* Levi acknowledges that he sees everyone, but stands at parade rest. Willow's meh.
* Hellbinder gives a boring but theoretically motivational speech about superheroism.
* Rivet asks Levi if he's uncomfortable. A short conversation about discipline.
* We head to class 1A! Five minutes to socialize and talk with fellow classmates.
* Blond man in track suit comes in. "Hello class. Gilgamesh. Address me as Dr. Gilgamesh. Physical education & other uses of the body. Normal schools would be sports etc. We know the basics of your powers, doing a simulation to learn more."

## Search & Rescue

* We head to the basement. Levi's jazzed about this, Riptide's talking animatedly with folks.
* Search & rescue mission! A group of villains who are separated. Who stops villains? Who helps civilians?
* Levi: any mission briefing or operation parameters? Gil: Nope. Levi: this is unlike missions I've run before. Riptide: that's the point, bro.
* Simulation begins! People are trying to escape from rubble, people unconscious, Gil is gone.
* Riptide teleports to Willow, brings her along to Rivet & Levi. RT: "Willow, find people, I can get them out?" Levi: "We can do preliminary scouting. Run a perimeter, find where he'll be." Willow: (sigh). Levi: "Do we have comms?" RT: "It's called shouting, bro." Levi: "Split up."
* Team 1 is S&R. Team 2 is Gil Team.
* Willow senses a synthetic ghost. Tries to talk to it.

* Woman, 40s. Willow: "Looking for person that fits this description." Woman points southwest - Team 2 ran north.
* Riptide teleports that way then.
* There's 2 people stuck under rubble. One's unconscious, other is dazed. There's a spirit here, completely still. Meanwhile Riptide will try to teleport the unconscious person out.
* Willow: "can you do me a favor?" Spirit: ? Willow: "can you call out a warning if you see someone approaching." Spirit: "Understood." Willow is suspicious, pierces the mask -> 7. It's the spirit equivalent of an android - looks like a human, isn't a human.
* While Willow digs, Riptide talks to other students. "We got people to save, what's up". Students unclear on what's going on.

## Fighting Gilgamesh

* Meanwhile, Willow feels a hostile presence! She takes up a defensive position. A spear is incoming! Powerful blow -> 7
* Gilgamesh emerges from a "dune" of rubble, staring her down grinning.
* Suddenly a couple of iron knives come whistling through. Rivet attacks -> 8, creating an opportunity for my allies. Gil is cut on the side. Swords come flying out from shining yellow portals. Levi followed thanks to his nightmare sense, defending Rivet -> 12
* Enter battle as a team. Riptide is leading.
* Gil is reaching for a sword. Riptide wants to teleport Willow & the civilian away. -> 8, marks Afraid
* Alfie is setting up medbay stuff. Quinn is extracting civilians.
* Gil sneers at Levi & Rivet. Points big sword at us.
* Rivet is on board with this. Ferrokinesis to attack with captured swords. -> 4
* Gil teleports some of the swords back through his gates of Babylon. He swings big sword, giant gust of wind manifests. Levi defends -> 7
* Levi takes a powerful blow -> 6
* He starts cutting with wind, inflicting paper cuts.
* Rivet catches Gil's sword on the downswing, using powers to trap sword in the rubble for a moment. -> 7, resists or avoids blows.
* Levi flanks, attacks. -> 7, creates opportunity for allies. Distracting grapple.
* Cut to Teddy Urso! He charges in, punches Gil, who goes down.
* Cut back to team 1. Willow picks up a ping from the ghost lady. W: "I could have helped at the other fight, but we're getting another ping, so pissed at you is gonna have to wait." RT: (superhuman battles, not my thing...) W: "This is the coordinates, let's go."
* There's one person who's completely stuck. Whole area caved in thanks to falling building. There's a problem with getting them unburied. RT: "Should I get Rivet?" W: "Don't pull someone vital out of a combat."
* Could we get Greg? yes but God. RT heads off to get help -> 11. Everywhere Kevin!
* Meanwhile RT sees someone hanging from a beam in the distance - they're at risk of falling, which will kill them. He's going to teleport straight there -> 3
* Didn't work out, person's about to fall! Defend! -> 8
* Riptide almost falls to his death but teleport-rolls out of the way -> 2
* Meanwhile, Levi lets go of Gil as Teddy charges in and punches Gil
* Rivet can lift Gil's sword with his powers, since it's pretty heavy. Chucks the sword under some rubble. "Let's keep moving."
* Levi: "We should take Gil with us." Rivet: "He might be faking it. We could stab him a couple times to find out." Levi: "half that plan was good. Let's check." Levi pierces the mask -> 6, Rivet prods with knives to help, but Levi doesn't want to take that team.
* Whistling sound, as of projectiles! Teddy doesn't notice. Levi pushes us away -> 9, Rivet spends team to throw up some rubble as a shield. Levi takes influence over Teddy.
* Gil has swapped out of his track suit for golden armor. Rivet to Levi: "Told ya. Knives."
* Gil: "You should check if someone's playing dead!" Grabs blood-red lance.
* Levi: "You've got permission to stab him." Rivet: "I didn't need permission, just thinking of a plan."
* Rivet assessing -> 6, +1 team from Levi. how can we best end this quickly? Run away. There's a dune of rubble, if we can destroy it or make a path around it. Rivet: "Right. This way, gentlemen."
* There's rebar in the rubble, and Rivet moves it aside. Levi feels like something's wrong - he's pointing his lance at the ground, like something's about to happen. Levi uses tactical analysis -> 8. What can we use to prevent him doing the thing? He can deflect the spear using a makeshift shield.
* Levi: "Gil is really trying to hurt us here." Rivet: "how exciting!"
* Levi blocks, Rivet assists with team -> 9.

## Remaining Civilian Rescue

* We change course to head toward Willow & Riptide. We find Alfie, having finished their medical bay prep. Civilians are being treated here. There is an extraction point in a specific building. We're 18/20 rescued.
* Levi tries to sense other civilians with nightmare sense. 2 at the north end of town. Gil now heading straight to them. Riptide & Willow probably dropped their folks off at the med bay.
* We're gonna use rocket skates & a sled to catch up with them. Rivet shapes metal! -> 8. Levi & Teddy chip in team for the 10.
* Willow: "RT, why don't things work that smoothly for you?"
* Leviathan: "civilians that way!" (we keep going) Willow: "OMG they're leaving me with him"
* Riptide: "I'm so useless huh? You can get there yourself." and teleports solo
* RT is there first, sees 2 civilians, grabs them, time to teleport again! -> 10
* Gil is slowly approaching, sword in hand. RT: "We gotta run!" They head toward Alfie.
* Levi: "if we hop out, we can hit him with this sled." Rivet: "That sounds amazing!" Levi -> 6, up to 7 with Rivet's help
* Rivet takes a powerful blow -> 8, marks Guilty & Insecure. Levi -> 7, Afraid and Hopeless.
* RT books it with civilians. "Gil is over there, now's your chance!"
* Willow assesses -> 10, uses Dangerous Web -> 15! Creates an illusion of Riptide & civilians to bait Gil away.
* Levi: "That worked out really well, I'm impressed." Rivet: "Thanks, I'm gonna bring the house down next."
* Meanwhile Willow has to maintain the illusion, so defends it -> 7. She shields, but takes a powerful blow. -> 11!
* Meanwhile Rivet wants to bring a building down on Gil! Leviathan grabs Willow out of the way -> 10
* Rivet brings the house down.... -> 7
* Simulation ends, Gil walks away. He was gonna get crushed though.
