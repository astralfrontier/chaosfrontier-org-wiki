<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Aliens -->

# Introduction
NATO and other international organizations classify alien contacts according to whether they've established friendly relations with humanity. Prior to this, a newly confirmed alien species is given a designation from the Greek alphabet, in order of discovery. If a species makes friendly contact, they lose this designation and are referred to by their preferred names. If their own name for themselves is difficult for a human to pronounce, another label is applied.

So far, the following aliens retain their NATO designation:

* The Alpha - an ancient species and the source of the "Alpha scale" for superhuman abilities
* The Beta
* The Gamma
* The Delta
* The Epsilon
* The Zeta - invaders of Earth, 20 years ago
