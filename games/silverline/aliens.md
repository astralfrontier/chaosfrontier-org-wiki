<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Aliens -->

# Introduction
NATO and other international organizations classify alien contacts according to whether they've established friendly relations with humanity. Prior to this, a newly confirmed alien species is given a designation from the Greek alphabet, in order of discovery. If a species makes friendly contact, they lose this designation and are referred to by their preferred names. If their own name for themselves is difficult for a human to pronounce, another label is applied.

So far, the following aliens retain their NATO designation:

* The Alpha - an ancient species and the source of the "Alpha scale" for superhuman abilities
* The Beta
* The Gamma
* The Delta
* The Epsilon
* The Zeta - invaders of Earth, 20 years ago

## The Alpha Scale
The Alpha scale measures superpowers in terms of how threatening they are to a social order. Each level is an order of magnitude more potent than the previous.

* Alpha-0: no powers
* Alpha-1: minor or personal powers
* Alpha-2: moderate powers, noticeable, with a reasonably common counter or weakness
* Alpha-3: "typical superhero" level power
* Alpha-4: ultra-powerful senior hero power
* Alpha-5: potentially world dominating power
## The Zeta Scale
The Zeta scale works similar to the Alpha scale, but for mastery of Zeta tech (currently the most sophisticated technology base on Earth).

* Zeta-0: no understanding
* Zeta-1
* Zeta-2: the highest scale for civilian-legal applications
* Zeta-3: things like cloaking tech that can threaten CiCon security
* Zeta-4: things like teleportation that can defeat CiCon security measures
* Zeta-5: full mastery of the technology, the presumed mastery level the Zeta themselves enjoy
