# History
Almost sixty years ago, the world met its first public superhuman: a test pilot code-named Apollo. Almost fifty years ago, America put him on the Moon, and ushered in the Space Race.

Twenty years ago, Earth beat back an invasion from the stars. The aliens, who we dubbed the "Zeta", were nigh unstoppable. Our best and brightest gave much. Our most courageous gave everything. Our heroes, and even some of our villains, fought together to save their planet.

> The Zeta are not intended to be a continuing campaign element, though players or the GM can have them make some kind of repeat appearance if desired. In that case, decide on the nature of the Zeta race, their goals, capabilities, and so on.

During the war, a massive Zeta mothership crash-landed on Earth. The military took charge of the site. Scientists arrived to analyze the wreck. Technicians came to assist the scientists. Engineers provided tools and infrastructure. Hot dog vendors kept the engineers fed. Barbers gave haircuts to the hot dog vendors. Supervillains snuck into the site to plunder the cache of Zeta wonders. Superheroes flew in to protect the civilian population from the villains. Before long, the fallen mothership had turned into a city of its own.

Time passed. People fell in love. Families formed, or immigrated. A new generation of super emerged: children for whom the city was not opportunity, but home.

Today, heroes and villains soar the skies, doing battle with each other. Marvels of engineering emerge from advanced laboratories. And science pirates descend into the depths of Sector Zero in search of alien ultra-tech. The city was born under a cloud of tragedy, but every cloud has a silver lining.

> What if the city wasn't alien? What if it wasn't an invasion?
> * **It's from the future**. What caused it to come here, and why? From how far ahead did it come? Was it accidental, or intentional? And who might have a connection to its eventual builders?
> * **The ship is magical or mystical**. It's a remnant of Atlantis. It's from another plane, a dimension of magic, or even Earth's own mystic past. The city might even be the hatched egg of a cosmic being, with residual magic taking the place of ultra-tech. What kind of supernatural creatures, like elves, dragons or demigods, might live in the city?
> * **The ship was built by supervillains or super-scientists**. Maybe it started as a vehicle for conquest, but was shot down. The builders might be long gone, or scheming to get it back.
