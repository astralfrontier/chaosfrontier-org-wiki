# Locations
City planners divide it into "sectors", a holdover from the days of military control. Each sector has its own character and purpose. The city has many sectors, only some of which get a description here.
## Aspire
The monumental super-skyscraper known as Aspire dominates Silverline's skyline. Dozens of gleaming high-tech cones surround it, each a marvel of architecture. They play host to the beating heart of commerce in the city, and form the business and downtown area.

Silverline attracts corporations with low tax rates and special incentives. The city takes a very dim view of actual pollution, industrial sabotage, and the like. Anything that poses a danger to the citizens is anathema. Otherwise, the city bends over backwards to make captains of industry feel welcome.

Millions of dollars flow through the sector daily. Early supervillains targeted this flow of wealth. The corporations responded to their attacks by rebuilding their towers. The Science Sector's innovators contributed their latest research in exchange for fresh funding. Today, buildings use advanced composites and high-tech alloys. Some can heal, and others use armored walls and interior partitions. All come equipped with shelters for civilians, evacuation routes, and other safety features. Whatever happens, Silverline and its citizens will rebuild and improve.

A modern Empire State Building, Aspire accommodates both tourists and business clients. From the observation deck at the top, visitors can see the entirety of the city. The Gladwell Tower is a crystal skyscraper, shining gold and silver in the sun. The Gladwell Corporation works to use Zeta tech for humanitarian causes. The enigmatic Colossus is a windowless ziggurat owned by the secretive ARES Consortium. They work to turn the alien tech into weapons of war. Some of their creations have already appeared on the battlefield. They are also sometimes recovered from members of powerful gangs.

> Decide on three "faces" for the sector:
> The benevolent CEO of Gladwell. What motivates them?
> A senior vice president of ARES. Who were they before their ascension?
> An up-and-coming small business owner, investigative reporter, or child of privilege who needs the PCs' help with a life-or-death matter.

## Embassy Sector
Once the city was secure, its leaders allocated a sector to visitors, then immigrants. Human nations, and friendly alien races, moved in and set up shop in the new area.

Statues of fallen heroes and murals to their glory line the streets. The flags of dozens of nations wave in honor of the sacrifices of their citizens. Children of every race, creed, and color play together. The green grass of the parks is as well trimmed as the buzz-cuts of the soldiers who stand guard over them. The whole sector serves as a friendly show of strength by humanity at large. It's a reminder: "we don't want a fight, but we can win one."

City leaders have mixed feelings about the open-door policy of the sector. A few spies and saboteurs have made it in. But it's also helped to normalize international relationships and to forge lasting alliances. The administrators are willing to turn a blind eye to quite a bit, as long as it stays confined to the sector. Alien enclaves are full of strange smells, dazzling colors, and unusual sounds. The powerful strike deals in the back rooms of restaurants. The clever exchange whispered secrets over cups of coffee. It's said that you can find anything here, if you know where to look or who to talk to.

Visitors to the sector often go first to Remembrance Square. It is the largest of the many war memorials. There, they read the stories of the many heroes and villains who fell in battle against the Zeta. Stadfelt's Diner serves lunch to hungry tourists. The owner is an ex-supervillain who fought for a pardon after serving in the war. A tough crowd of regulars makes their appearance after the lunch rush leaves. They don't always appreciate busybodies who snoop on their conversations. They tell stories that aren't found in any public history. Xenopolis is the "home away from home" for visitors to see real aliens. The shop owners sell safe extraterrestrial trinkets to eager tourists to take home. Only a few narrow alleys separate the curious or the lost from seeing the true face of alien life on Earth, though.

> Decide on three "faces" for the sector:
> The storyteller or experienced regular who's been here a long time. What stories did they tell that motivate you?
> The taciturn civilian who everyone knows is an ex-supervillain. What keeps them coming back here?
> The smiling shopkeeper or harmless-seeming alien who knows more than they let on. What do you think they're really up to?

## Science Sector
Many laboratories sprang up to analyze the Zeta wreckage. For safety, they stayed isolated from the rest of the population. For convenience, they clustered together. The resulting sector took on a life of its own. Today, it's key to keeping the city running. Many ultra-tech heroes have a connection to the labs, or come to them for analysis and aid.

The sector is a tangle of buildings that wind together and spiral skyward, like metal kudzu. The towers interconnect with sky bridges, funicular lifts, and elevated monorails. The boundaries between one lab and another are hard to determine. It's a dizzying ultra-tech labyrinth. Regulars in the sector understand the arrangement. Visitors may take the wrong door and wind up in the middle of a high-energy physics experiment. Strange experiments run at all hours of day or night. The result is a spectacular rainbow glow shining out over the rest of the city.

The ivory towers that ascend to the heavens aren't the only feature of the sector. Hellish underground complexes do the heavy and difficult work of manufacturing. Networks of pipes funnel raw materials from place to place. They empty out into massive forges, metal molds, and complicated robotized assembly lines. Most of the city's goods emerge from this system of human know-how and Zeta robotics. "Fire, steam, and sweat" is the motto of the gnomic masters of the manufacturing pits.

One of the busiest companies in the sector is Templar Technologies, run by Mr. Li and Mr. Kubota. They are veteran designers of powered armor and exoskeletons. Their designs serve police, military and private security forces around the world. AURA Labs (Anomalous and Unusual Readings Analysis) helps scientists puzzle out high-energy physics. Leading experts in physics, chemistry, and other sciences work there. They also receive advice from extraterrestrial scientists from the Embassy Sector. To actually build something, industrialists contract with the Nightsmiths. These master craftsmen never meet clients face to face. Instead, they work through intermediaries and assistants. They take specifications and build the product using their advanced robot-driven factory. Their work is flawless, alien in its perfection.

> Decide on three "faces" for the sector:
> The friendly gadgeteer or inventor who's always working on something cool. What do they ask you to obtain for them?
> The absent-minded scientist who spins theories all day but can't cross the street safely. What dangerous or ground-breaking research are they close to completing?
> The scion of science, or the kid who hangs around the sector and gets into trouble. What reason are they loitering around here all the time?

## Sector Zero
Twenty years hasn't been enough to certify the entire alien mother-ship as safe. The frontier of human habitation pushes outward and downward. Everything that remains bears the innocuous name of "Sector Zero". The military welded thick steel plates over any areas they couldn't map or didn't trust. City security blankets track of the known entrances with motion sensors and cameras. But there are still many unexplored tunnels and secret ways inside.

The potential rewards are enormous for the brave souls who venture into the depths of the sector. The upper levels were sensor systems, navigational aids, and weapons. Much of the ship must consist of engines, factories, and other necessities. Some of this has discovered and smuggled out. The promise of contraband ultra-science lies behind mazes of eternal darkness. Criminal gangs, enterprising explorers, and high-tech thieves all seek such prizes. They call themselves "science pirates".

Even these brave and desperate hunters risk much. No official maps of the sector exist. The unofficial routes are well-guarded secrets. The factions that plumb the interior of the ship often set traps for each other. City security is ever vigilant for intrusions. The military has orders to shoot on sight if they spot anyone entering or leaving. All these dangers pale compared to the worst and strangest threat. The glitchy alien automata are inhuman and unpredictable. In the dark tunnels, exotic Zeta tech can do worse things than kill you.

Three factions dominate the exploration of Sector Zero. Novice superheroes cut their teeth (or disappear) tangling with their members.

**Autogang** is a criminal cartel that makes extensive use of robots and powered suits. They prefer flashy, high-speed vehicles. They loot Sector Zero for wheels and weapons. They engage in street and aerial races in Silverline City when they aren't spelunking. A street racer and smuggler named **Drifter** is their leader.

The **Laughing Bandits** are a group of high-tech thieves. Their leader is **Lupin X**, who adopts the pose of a classic "gentleman burglar". They specialize in high-stakes capers, using stolen Sector Zero devices to get in and out. They avoid conflict, but will fight if necessary. They sell their services, and findings, to the highest bidder. They keep the best loot for themselves, of course.

The **Red Brotherhood** is the most dangerous gang. They focus on weapons and combat gear. They are stupid, crazy, or brave enough to occupy parts of Sector Zero full time. They trade captured tech with foreign governments and hostile powers.

> Answer the following questions:
> Do any of you have a personal involvement with the science pirates (rivalry with a member, a family member in one of the gangs, etc.)?
> Have you fought a gang before? How did it go?
