The Neural Knowledge Interface Distribution Unit, or NKIDU, was a system that would transfer a human mind into an immortal robot body. Unfortunately, the inventor attempted the transfer before the technology was perfected. Now an unstoppable robot juggernaut, built and rebuilt like a metal Frankenstein's monster, cursed with mad impulses and more beast than man, he seeks a cure - or perhaps just a friend.
