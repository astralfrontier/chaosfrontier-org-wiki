The Neural Knowledge Interface Distribution Unit, or NKIDU, was a system that would transfer a human mind into an immortal robot body. Unfortunately, the inventor attempted the transfer before the technology was perfected. Now an unstoppable robot juggernaut, cursed with mad impulses and more beast than man, he seeks a cure - or perhaps just a friend.

Move goals: NKIDU should be a hurricane, fusing animal ferocity and cunning with human ingenuity and planning. They should be larger than life, capable of ignoring small attacks and turning larger ones into destructive collateral damage.
