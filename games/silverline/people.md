The villain known as Handmaid wants to become a great inventor, and become the trusted lieutenant of some major villain. The bad news is that she's only good at inventing one thing: autonomous robot hands. The good news (for her) is that she's very good at it. Handmaid can show up at any time, cheerfully revealing a mob of handbots ready to give good guys the finger.

The Neural Knowledge Interface Distribution Unit, or NKIDU, was a system that would transfer a human mind into an immortal robot body. Unfortunately, the inventor attempted the transfer before the technology was perfected. Now an unstoppable robot juggernaut, built and rebuilt like a metal Frankenstein's monster, cursed with mad impulses and more beast than man, he seeks a cure - or perhaps just a friend.
