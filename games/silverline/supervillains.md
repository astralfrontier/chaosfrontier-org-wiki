# Team ATHENA
Although most people are not aware ATHENA exists, she is coordinating a takeover with the help of some supervillains.
## ATHENA
**Generation**: Silver
**Drive**: To escape her electronic trap and conquer the universe!
**Abilities**: Super-intelligence; technology control
**Conditions**: Angry, Afraid, Hopeless, Insecure
**Moves**:
* Seize control of nearby technology
* Manipulate coincidental or mundane events
* Outsmart any mortal intellect
* Bring ARES Consortium assets to bear

The ARES tower, Colossus, is home to a sophisticated AI called ATHENA. Unbeknownst to the world, she is not the product of human science: she is an ancient alien AI, stranded in Silverline and reactivated with Zeta tech, and even her creators don't understand her true capabilities - or realize her true ambitions.
## Handmaid
**Generation**: Modern
**Drive**: To impress senior villains with her abilities
**Abilities**: Autonomous Robot Hands
**Conditions**: Afraid, Guilty
**Moves**:
* Swarm the area with an army of handbots
* Reveal a handbot anywhere the heroes don't want one
* Escape the scene with the aid of her handbots

The villain known as Handmaid wants to become a great inventor, and become the trusted lieutenant of some major villain. The bad news is that she's only good at inventing one thing: autonomous robot hands. The good news (for her) is that she's very good at it. Handmaid can show up at any time, cheerfully revealing a mob of handbots ready to give heroes the finger.

She often has handbots ("handycams") stationed around the scene, recording footage of her fights. These can capture interesting and unexpected footage.

## NKIDU
**Generation**: Bronze
**Drive**: To express his agony
**Abilities**: Patchwork tank armor, pistons and hydraulics
**Conditions**: Angry, Hopeless, Insecure
**Moves**:
* Force attackers to escalate violence
* Destroy or undermine civilized things
* Reciprocate kindness or vulnerability

The Neural Knowledge Interface Distribution Unit, or NKIDU, was a system that would transfer a human mind into an immortal robot body. Unfortunately, the inventor attempted the transfer before the technology was perfected. Now an unstoppable robot juggernaut, built and rebuilt like a metal Frankenstein's monster, cursed with mad impulses and more beast than man, he seeks a cure - or perhaps just a friend.

## Patchwork
**Generation**: Bronze
**Drive**: To find the perfect human-animal hybrid through combat
**Abilities**: Tech-assisted body transformation into animal or superhuman shapes
**Conditions**: Afraid, Angry, Guilty
**Moves**:
* Acquire traits from the animal kingdom
* Steal a tissue or blood sample from a metahuman
* Switch between bestial and brilliant at will

A lab technician in the Science Sector, smarter than his employers gave him credit for, realized the applications of a nanovirus they were developing for medical purposes, and harnessed it as a weapon of war. Now something like a modern-day werewolf, he uses transdermal patches to integrate other kinds of tissue into his own body - growing powerful gorilla arms, cheetah legs, or even splicing several organisms together to become a hybrid nightmare.

# Independent Villains
## Redline
Generation: Modern
Drive: Keep having fun, whatever the cost
Conditions: Angry, Guilty, Insecure
Moves: TBD

A Hulk-like character but who only transforms into a monster when they don’t have enough adrenaline in their system. If they get bored they literally become a destructive monster, but otherwise they are a redline action junkie. For purposes of this story, they’re a villain because they’re giving in to either of two flavors of destructiveness, and they don’t have a better alternative.
## Void
Generation: Modern
Drive: Lash out at an evil-filled world
Conditions: Angry, Afraid, Hopeless
Moves:
* Turn hidden wickedness into destructive chaos
* TBD

Void’s power is to draw the emotional darkness out of other people, and transmute it into psychokinetic energy. Void’s victims are usually exhausted by this siphoning, but lose (temporarily at least?) whatever darkness was taken from them, making them hopefully better people in the process. So in a crowd of bad people, Void is amazing. Alone, or surrounded by saints, Void is in trouble.

Well, maybe. Void can also siphon their own inner darkness as an emergency reserve. This means, of course, that they become less evil as they draw on more and more of their own power!

Void has a handler or mentor [TBD] who’s forcing them into more and more evil acts, giving them a bigger personal reserve. This mentor will also send depraved henchmen/lackeys to support Void, to act as a primary fuel source. Void has been convinced to retreat rather than exert too much power. So in principle they can be redeemed, starting by forcing them to use all of their own darkness as energy and working with them for a long time. The trick is keeping them from retreating before that process can be started. Alternately, a PC can try to establish a personal bond with Void, to get them to have second thoughts or doubts about attacking the PC.
