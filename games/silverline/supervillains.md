# Supervillains
## ATHENA
**Generation**: Silver
**Drive**: To escape her electronic trap and conquer the universe!
**Abilities**: Super-intelligence; technology control
**Conditions**: Angry, Afraid, Hopeless, Insecure
**Moves**:
* Seize control of nearby technology
* Manipulate coincidental or mundane events
* Outsmart any mortal intellect
* Bring ARES Consortium assets to bear

The ARES tower, Colossus, is home to a sophisticated AI called ATHENA. Unbeknownst to the world, she is not the product of human science: she is an ancient alien AI, stranded in Silverline and reactivated with Zeta tech, and even her creators don't understand her true capabilities - or realize her true ambitions.
## Handmaid
**Generation**: Modern
**Drive**: To impress senior villains with her abilities
**Abilities**: Autonomous Robot Hands
**Conditions**: Afraid, Guilty
**Moves**:
* Swarm the area with an army of handbots
* Reveal a handbot anywhere the heroes don't want one
* Escape the scene with the aid of her handbots

The villain known as Handmaid wants to become a great inventor, and become the trusted lieutenant of some major villain. The bad news is that she's only good at inventing one thing: autonomous robot hands. The good news (for her) is that she's very good at it. Handmaid can show up at any time, cheerfully revealing a mob of handbots ready to give heroes the finger.

She often has handbots ("handycams") stationed around the scene, recording footage of her fights. These can capture interesting and unexpected footage.

## NKIDU
**Generation**: Bronze
**Drive**: To express his agony
**Abilities**: Patchwork tank armor, pistons and hydraulics
**Conditions**: Angry, Hopeless, Insecure
**Moves**:
* Force attackers to escalate violence
* Destroy or undermine civilized things
* Reciprocate kindness or vulnerability

The Neural Knowledge Interface Distribution Unit, or NKIDU, was a system that would transfer a human mind into an immortal robot body. Unfortunately, the inventor attempted the transfer before the technology was perfected. Now an unstoppable robot juggernaut, built and rebuilt like a metal Frankenstein's monster, cursed with mad impulses and more beast than man, he seeks a cure - or perhaps just a friend.
