# The City Today
Silverline City's population is international and exceptional. Many people around the world live with the risk of bombs or land mines. It takes something extra to live inside a giant sleeping weapon. As a result, only the best of the best live and work here. The ramen chef by the train station knows he could die, or worse, if some Zeta weapon goes off. Then again, he gets to greet world-renowned physicists by first name in the morning. The city's populace is a close-knit family, thanks to shared danger and common purpose.

The city is the source of amazing technology. This makes it a prime target for supervillains, alien bad guys, and tech thieves. In response, many superheroes have emerged to fight them. Home-grown gadgeteers, mutants created by Zeta tech, or extraterrestrial champions all live here. Because of this, Silverline City has the highest super population in the world.

The city leadership includes both civilian and military elements. The city's mayor is an elected official. "Chief of security" is the title held by the highest-ranking military officer. Civilians manage most of the infrastructure, such as lights and water. The military may override them in emergencies. By mutual agreement, each side respects the boundaries of the other. A civilian police force handles most peacekeeping duties. They can call in the military if a criminal has serious hardware, such as Zeta tech or energy weapons.

The ship's hull forms a solid wall around the perimeter. A dozen gates provide ground traffic with access to the outside. The top is open to the sky, letting in both sun and rain. The ship came down at a slight angle. The city thus has a noticeable slope, like San Francisco or Seattle. Funiculars, or cable railroads, carry cargo and passengers up or down the hills.

The city's architecture reflects its international character. North American, Asian, and European influences blend together in an attractive whole. Buildings have organic lines. They are often made from concrete, faux wood, and high-tech glass. The glass acts as solar panels as well as transparent computer displays. Cupolas rise above tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors and interior partitions allow occupants to redesign the interior to taste. People use modular shelving, cushions, and mats in place of chairs or wooden furniture. Colorful mosaics line the interior walls. White concrete is often painted by residents to give a building local character. Gardens follow in the Persian style, divided into quadrants by water and pathways.

> Where did Silverline City crash-land?

> **On unoccupied terrain**. A few rural settlements were been wiped out, but the occupants were evacuated.
> * What is the local terrain - is the area forested, mountainous, desert, or even a lake or sea?
> * How do people get there - new freeways, water traffic, or even by airship?

> **On top of an existing city**. The old city was destroyed, and the what survived is in bad shape. Most people were evacuated in time, but many couldn't be. Survivors now live in Silverline. Some try to repair their old homes and workplaces. Monuments to the fallen will be common. The newly built city's architecture will be reminiscent of the old. Major place and street names will be reused.
> * What existing city was displaced?
> * How bad was the devastation?
> * How do the old residents feel about the new ones?

> **In international waters**. No single nation can lay claim to the land where it lies, so the city is truly international. The city's defenses are strong enough, to repel a sea-going invasion from any country.
> * Is the city neutral, or does it ally with some nation or group such as the U.N.?
> * Has anyone attacked it, and how did it work out if so?
> * Is the city floating, anchored in place (or resting on a continental shelf), or entirely underwater?
