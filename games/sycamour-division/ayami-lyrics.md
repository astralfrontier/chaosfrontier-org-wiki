# Lyrics
She wipes the floor with Sycamour, her dress has got a glow
She waltzes on her way to class and hangs out with her bro
And disregarding Top Gun, she'll take in any show
I even saw her trying out salami 

She couldn't bear to look at Nick, but her bravery is real.
He said he loved her in the park, with which she couldn't deal
I fear to really say it, but I very firmly feel
Romance is not a concept for Ayami

I'd like to say that for awhile,
Ionic made usâ€¦ smile!

How do you ship a hero like Ayami?
How do you pair this girl with a boy?
How do you say what love means to Ayami?
A flame in the soul, a passionate spark, a joy?
Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you say the words, when not knowing feelings hurts?
How do you get relationships to land?
Oh, how do you ship a hero like Ayami?
How do you get a date with holograms?

When he's with her he's confused, out of focus and bemused
And he never knows exactly what to say
Unpredictable as weather, her thoughts they flow untethered
And he never knows exactly where they'll stray
She has logic all her own, how it works is an unknown
He could throw her up at Dallas with a twirl
She is gentle, she is wild
She's a fighter, she's a child
She's a hero! She's an idol! She's a girl!

How do you ship a hero like Ayami?
How do you pair this girl with a boy?
How do you say what love means to Ayami?
A flame in the soul, a passionate spark, a joy?
Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you say the words, when not knowing feelings hurts?
How do you get relationships to land?
Oh, how do you ship a hero like Ayami?
How do you get a date with holograms?
