# The Book of Melody, Post-Prom Edition
## Prauma
Nick agreed to help me with my plan!  And he also had a really great plan, too.  He’s going to help train me to resist being reprogrammed and other types of mind control!  I’m so happy that I can actively try to do something to protect myself so that the worst-case scenario might not ever happen!  I feel so much better knowing that I can work toward being stronger and maybe prevent something like that from ever happening!

The rest of the night was really confusing.
## Friendship Rules
I'm so confused. What am I supposed to do? I assume I try to act normal? But we just broke a whole bunch of friend rules? Think, Aya, think.

So I didn't know there were friend rules. And I broke them. If I had felt I was doing something wrong, I wouldn't have done it. I would have put a stop to it. But even after I knew, I -still- knowingly participated in rule-breaking behavior.

What happens when you deliberately decide to break friend rules? What does that mean? I really need to talk to someone. Until I can, I will have to do my best. Everything was okay in the end, after all. I'll figure it out. And I'll just have to continue to be Aya in the meantime. I did promise tonight I would do what I want to do and not what I think I'm supposed to do. I guess that means even if I break rules. Maybe that's the best thing I can do for now.
## Blushing
Top Gun was mostly a great movie! Pilots, planes, action, beach volleyball, friends, and heroics. What happened to Goose was really sad, though.

I say "mostly" because it turned out there was a part of the movie I didn't expect to be there, and apparently my system has features I'm not aware of. It was hard enough to watch scenes that were giving me flashbacks to the park, which I was already confused about. It already felt awkward that I was blushing when I didn't know my system could do that.

It was even worse when my -powers- were involved, too. Apparently blushing is accompanied by light effects and sparkles. I don't think I've ever really been mad at Kieran before, but in that moment, I was close to being mad at him. I -knew- everyone was staring at me and I couldn't shut it off. I couldn't look at anyone. I knew I was making a scene out of my confusion and it made me feel worse knowing that. I never felt so isolated and locked up with so many people paying attention to me before.

But I wasn't by myself. Nick was having the same struggle I was. It just wasn't accompanied by a dramatic light show. I might have noticed sooner if I had been able to look over, but I just hadn't been able to bring myself to do that. Knowing I wasn't in the situation alone made me feel better. At least someone understood how I felt. That in and of itself was comforting. I was able to stop the light show. Thank you.

I need to figure things out.
## Unity
They can't take Zephyr away from the team. I won't allow it. I'm going to work really hard so that doesn't happen. I'm going to train harder than ever, and I'm going to show them I deserve to be promoted, too. Zephyr had a great idea about the rest of us getting publicity. I have to make sure I do something notable so I can talk to Vanya and be in the paper. I need to make sure everyone knows our team should stay together. I'm going to make sure I show my best, like Zephyr said, but I also have to make sure I show everyone else's best in this interview, too. I need to make sure my words reach people who read them.

Zephyr doesn't want to be on a team without us, and I don't want to be on a team without Zephyr. I'm going to do everything I can to show them why we all belong here together.
## Hug Ratings
Today I learned how to bro hug! Zephyr taught me how after he bro-hugged Dallas! It was great!

After having a big talk about what happened at the park and hugs, I think I understand a few things a lot better than I did before. Firstly, hugs aren't all the same. Bro hugs with Zephyr are fun and full of happy energy. Hugs with Dallas are friendly and confident, full of strength and encouragement. Nick hugs are warm and safe, like nothing bad could ever happen to me there.

I thought there were rules about hugs, and maybe there still are. I asked Dallas about a time limit, but he couldn't give me a straight answer. After hugging all my teammates, I think I understand a bit better why that is. Hugs just... aren't all the same. They're all special, just in different ways. I think it might be better that way. I don't think I would want them to all be the same.

Maybe that's what Dallas and Nick have been trying to explain to me.

Nick has the best hugs. Maybe that's okay.
