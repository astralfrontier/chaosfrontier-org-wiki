# The Book of Melody, Post-Prom Edition
## Prauma
Nick agreed to help me with my plan!  And he also had a really great plan, too.  He’s going to help train me to resist being reprogrammed and other types of mind control!  I’m so happy that I can actively try to do something to protect myself so that the worst-case scenario might not ever happen!  I feel so much better knowing that I can work toward being stronger and maybe prevent something like that from ever happening!

The rest of the night was really confusing.
## Friendship Rules
I'm so confused. What am I supposed to do? I assume I try to act normal? But we just broke a whole bunch of friend rules? Think, Aya, think.

So I didn't know there were friend rules. And I broke them. If I had felt I was doing something wrong, I wouldn't have done it. I would have put a stop to it. But even after I knew, I -still- knowingly participated in rule-breaking behavior.

What happens when you deliberately decide to break friend rules? What does that mean? I really need to talk to someone. Until I can, I will have to do my best. Everything was okay in the end, after all. I'll figure it out. And I'll just have to continue to be Aya in the meantime. I did promise tonight I would do what I want to do and not what I think I'm supposed to do. I guess that means even if I break rules. Maybe that's the best thing I can do for now.
## Blushing
Top Gun was mostly a great movie! Pilots, planes, action, beach volleyball, friends, and heroics. What happened to Goose was really sad, though.

I say "mostly" because it turned out there was a part of the movie I didn't expect to be there, and apparently my system has features I'm not aware of. It was hard enough to watch scenes that were giving me flashbacks to the park, which I was already confused about. It already felt awkward that I was blushing when I didn't know my system could do that.

It was even worse when my -powers- were involved, too. Apparently blushing is accompanied by light effects and sparkles. I don't think I've ever really been mad at Kieran before, but in that moment, I was close to being mad at him. I -knew- everyone was staring at me and I couldn't shut it off. I couldn't look at anyone. I knew I was making a scene out of my confusion and it made me feel worse knowing that. I never felt so isolated and locked up with so many people paying attention to me before.

But I wasn't by myself. Nick was having the same struggle I was. It just wasn't accompanied by a dramatic light show. I might have noticed sooner if I had been able to look over, but I just hadn't been able to bring myself to do that. Knowing I wasn't in the situation alone made me feel better. At least someone understood how I felt. That in and of itself was comforting. I was able to stop the light show. Thank you.

I need to figure things out.
## Unity
They can't take Zephyr away from the team. I won't allow it. I'm going to work really hard so that doesn't happen. I'm going to train harder than ever, and I'm going to show them I deserve to be promoted, too. Zephyr had a great idea about the rest of us getting publicity. I have to make sure I do something notable so I can talk to Vanya and be in the paper. I need to make sure everyone knows our team should stay together. I'm going to make sure I show my best, like Zephyr said, but I also have to make sure I show everyone else's best in this interview, too. I need to make sure my words reach people who read them.

Zephyr doesn't want to be on a team without us, and I don't want to be on a team without Zephyr. I'm going to do everything I can to show them why we all belong here together.
## Hug Ratings
Today I learned how to bro hug! Zephyr taught me how after he bro-hugged Dallas! It was great!

After having a big talk about what happened at the park and hugs, I think I understand a few things a lot better than I did before. Firstly, hugs aren't all the same. Bro hugs with Zephyr are fun and full of happy energy. Hugs with Dallas are friendly and confident, full of strength and encouragement. Nick hugs are warm and safe, like nothing bad could ever happen to me there.

I thought there were rules about hugs, and maybe there still are. I asked Dallas about a time limit, but he couldn't give me a straight answer. After hugging all my teammates, I think I understand a bit better why that is. Hugs just... aren't all the same. They're all special, just in different ways. I think it might be better that way. I don't think I would want them to all be the same.

Maybe that's what Dallas and Nick have been trying to explain to me.

Nick has the best hugs. Maybe that's okay.
## Alex
Today they tried to take Alex

Alex helped out with some recon phasing when the connection was cut.  It turned out the connection was severed because he had fallen unconscious and a psychic was messing with his mind.  At first we didn’t realize entirely what was happening, until Nick had Master of Puppets completely restrained.

Dallas was looking after Alex when he discovered an invisible villain.  I had been holding onto a rocket fist I had stopped midflight which had been heading toward Nick and I, so I let it go and it threw the invisi-villain into visibility.

This was who had been messing with Alex.  Alex and I had just spent time talking.  Alex is important to Dallas, but from talking to them, I also want to be better friends with Alex, and Alex has already been through a lot with these awful villains.  If there was anything I had to say about it, they would never do anything to them ever again.  Alex told me I could never be completely erased, that no matter what happens, the real Ayami would still be in there somewhere.  I feel like I helped them, too.  I feel like there had been a misunderstanding and I helped bring it to their attention.  And the look on Dallas’ face at the moment that villain came out of hiding: I think he was torn between staying by Alex and going after her.  I just knew it was up to me.

I took a step forward, only to feel the void.  The black hole energy.  It was absorbing my light, threatening to destroy me.  I was scared.  I took a step back for a moment.  I wasn’t sure I could do it.  I doubted.  I didn’t want to disappear.  If I continued forward, could I succeed?  Or would I be gone?  I could have fallen back.  I could have asked Nick to trade places with me.  Last time, he saved from this same black hole.

No.  Courage is not the absence of fear, it’s doing what needs to be done despite fear.  It was time to go forward.  What she was doing to Alex wasn’t okay, and I was going to stop her.

I could feel something intense flare to life throughout my system.  I could feel the light growing stronger as I moved with speed I didn’t know I had.  Maybe that’s what Zephyr feels like all the time, except he knows he has that kind of speed, so maybe not.  I was next to her.  I was scared.  I could hit her.  But I wanted her to feel what she made me feel, what she probably made Alex feel.  I wanted her to give up and admit she was defeated.  Maybe she would realize how awful it was to feel that way.  Maybe she’d change if she knew.  I told her what she was doing wasn’t going to work.

She tried to run from me, and tried to take Master of Puppets with her.  I started to pursue when suddenly, I felt something shift.  For an instant, I saw a rainbow flash in front of my field of vision and I felt an energy connecting into my mental current.  It felt like… Nick.  It was the same energy I felt during our training, but instead of trying to push against me to train, it was trying to push me forward.  I was suddenly more… aware? Of all my feelings.  Fear, determination, and anger at the forefront.  Yellow, brick red, bright red.  But there was a kaleidoscope of colors throughout my mind that I was aware of, all shining with an intensity and a power I hadn’t realized was there.  In the midst of the angry fear, I felt a sense of awe at how amazing it looked, and a sense of comfort that I wasn’t fighting alone, that I had his full support behind me as I charged forward into something I wasn’t sure I could win.  I mentally took hold of the garishly bright yellow and used it to power my flight forward, and held onto the mixture of reds and used them to grab hold of the pieces of the armor pinning the Master of Puppets to the wall.  The reds swirling together in a dizzying display, the pieces danced in a whirlwind.  I could feel the anger in the whirlwind.  My anger.  I could feel it swirling inside me the same way the pieces where swirling in front of me.  “You tried to trap me in a world of darkness; now I’m trapping you in a world of light.  This is MY world!” I could feel myself yelling intensely, and I saw a flash of diamond in my mind’s eye, as pieces of light joined the twister, filling in the gaps where the metal didn’t fill completely, encasing her in a prison of light and metal.  I used my will to hold her there, a light of solid ruby filling my vision.

Unfortunately, she escaped.  I did not know enough to check to make sure her mind had not left her.  She was gone.  If I had known more, maybe I could have prevented her from doing so.  It won’t happen again.  I’m going to train harder than ever.  I am going to find her.  And next time, I will succeed.

Nick says strong emotions, good or bad, fuel his powers, and that he always trusts me.  In that moment that I ran forward, I didn’t even trust myself.  But he trusted me anyway.  I don’t have the words to explain how much that means to me, but I can feel it anyway.
