# The Book of Melody
This is the Book of Melody.
Today I read the Book of Nick, and it made me realize that if I want people to understand me better, I should write a book.  So this will be it: The Book of Melody.  I should probably start by writing down some basic information about me, like they had on myself and my bandmates.

* Name: Melody
* Height: 5’0”
* Birthday: May 30
* Blood Type: None, I don’t bleed
* Favorite Food: So far I really like pizza, ice cream, and pancakes with syrup but I don’t know; it’s really hard to pick a favorite.  Those are just three things I really like, but I do like others, too.
* Likes: Singing, music, building sand castles, watching TV, reading books
* Dislikes: Villains, Detention Monster, banks, alcohol

I didn’t realize how difficult it was to be involved in the court system until today.  I don’t watch a lot of shows that show more than a couple minutes of court, but from talking with the team today it seems really complicated.  The people who work in a courtroom to determine who is innocent and guilty and what their punishment will be have a really hard job.  I think it might be an even harder job than being a member of the police force.  I think being a policeman or woman is harder than being a superhero, because they basically do a job like ours, but without any superpowers, and being a regular human without superpowers seems like it’s being a superhero but on hard mode.  (Even though a lot of the hard modes in games aren’t really that hard.  Even the nightmare difficulties aren’t really that hard a lot of the time, but it’s still harder than normal mode.)  I wonder what the hardest job in the whole world is?

Nick wrote in The Book of Nick that people might be intimidated by me. I wonder why he thinks that. Maybe because I'm not human and humans seem to be scared of things that are not human. On TV shows people tend to assume things that look different and scary to them are scary. I guess when you have to worry about getting hurt a lot of things are scary. I was scared when I didn't know if I could become solid again after trying out going through that wall by becoming a holographic projection. But I don't look scary. At least I don't think I do. I look like a pop idol! Because I am one!

Twilight is a good example of why people would be scared of me. Edward is a vampire who is supposed to eat humans, but he lives with humans anyway. He doesn't want to eat humans, though, so I feel sorry for him. Bella is his best friend but could just as easily be his steak dinner. Maybe this is why the Sports Club girls wanted me to read this in case I had any ideas about eating people to show me I don't have to and there are alternatives. But thankfully I don't eat people, so I don't have to worry about that!

I don't have any siblings but if I had a brother he would be exactly like Zephyr. He's like the brother I never had. He's smart, funny, and always looks out for others; he's also an amazing superhero. I feel like I can tell him any problem and he will know what to do. He's always coming up with plans and he has so many good ideas.

I think I would be a good little sister. Little sisters are supposed to be cute and kind but also sometimes trouble. I think I do those things pretty well. I think they're also supposed to argue with their brother, though, and I wouldn't want to do that. Maybe I wouldn't be a good little sister after all.

I think Laser Hawk likes movies as much as I do.  He watched all the Home Alone movies with me, and it was a lot of fun!  I would like to see more movies with Laser Hawk; it was a lot more fun than watching them alone!  Maybe when we have a break from our work we can see more movies.  Even though Laser does a lot of things I think are confusing, in some ways I feel like I understand him really well.  Our powers synergize so well that it feels like we’ve been working together a very long time.  I also can’t really explain it, but it feels like we’re very old friends.  But I haven’t known him that long.  And he’s still really confusing sometimes.  Laser Hawk is really good at making people smile and laugh, though, and at the end of the day, I know he wants his friends to smile, too.  That part isn’t confusing to me.
