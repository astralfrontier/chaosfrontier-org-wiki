# Lyrics
All my life been skating
And tonight I am a hero
Cuz I’ve got powers, I am strong
And I am saving a museum
This city’s full of villains
Ticking bombs, and space invaders
There are folks in need, my board has speed
And I’m not hesitating

On the streets there is no equal
I’ll be riding on some lasers
When I’m fighting off evil
I don’t believe in danger
When I’m at student council
I’m recording all the minutes
And I’ll say La-ser-who?

Can’t tell Ma I’m Laser
She can’t know I’m Laser
Everyone knows she would hate this, hate this
If she knew she won’t let me, won’t let me
I just Can’t tell Ma I’m Laser

Friends do homework for me
But my double life was secret
Until my mask took that arrow
And then my face was revealed
Sirens are approaching
While I’m being shown a movie
Laying on the road with Home Alone
Joe Pesci makes it gucci, oh

You know I’m a super hero
And I’m gonna be the greatest
Sycamour is evil
And their plans are the lamest
They wanna get my ID
So they’re threatening civilians
And I’ll punch them for you

Can’t tell Ma I’m Laser
She can’t know I’m Laser
Everyone knows she would hate this, hate this
If she knew she won’t let me, won’t let me
I just Can’t tell Ma I’m Laser, I’m Laser

I just can’t tell Ma I’m Laser, I’m Laser
Conceal it, I’m lying, I fake it, fake it
If she knew she won’t let me, won’t let me
I just can’t tell Ma I’m Laser
Can’t tell Ma I’m Laser
Can’t tell Ma I’m Laser
Can’t tell Ma I’m Laser
Can’t tell Ma I’m Laser
