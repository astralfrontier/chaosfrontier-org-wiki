The youngest member of Utau, age 13, rarely featured in solos but beloved by fans that have plastered the internet with cute chibi fanart of her likeness.  Her voice is youthful, sweet, and enthusiastic, but more limited in range than the other vocalists.  Her personality is bubbly and energetic, which is matched by her dance style.  “Adorable” is the word most commonly used to describe her.  Her bio in the CD jackets lists her favorite color as pink, her favorite instrument as the flute, and her favorite animal as bunnies.
## Kyoko Miyazaki

Member of Utau, age 15.  Her voice possesses a soft, pleasing tone that is soothing to the ears.  Fans refer to her as “Lullaby” for the peaceful and serene sound she brings to ballads, where the majority of her featured solos lie.  She always seems to have a dreamy look on her face in photos, and she moves with a relaxed grace in a lot of her dancing.  Her bio lists her favorite color as blue, her favorite instrument as the koto, and her favorite animal as swans.
## Akane Ishikawa

Spunky and high energy, do not mess with age 15 Akane, or she will make you regret it.  Her loud, enthusiastic voice can get any crowd clapping along to the rhythm.  She tends to be a featured soloist in a lot of high tempo rhythmic pieces, and her quick precise motions are attention-grabbing on stage.  She has an impressive range, but she prefers belting in a comfortable middle register.  She tends to grin mischievously more than she smiles in most of her photos.  While she is quick to laugh, she is also quick to aggravate, and her forthright personality will let everyone know which she is experiencing in the moment.  Her bio lists her favorite color as yellow, her favorite instrument as the bass drum, and her favorite animal as cheetahs.

## Yukari Sano

Age 16, member of Utau.  Standoffish to all but her closest friends, her clear, sharp tones are nothing short of perfection.  Hardworking, serious, and somewhat bossy, Yukari is known for amazing execution on vocally challenging solos and having the largest range of the Utau members.  She doesn’t always get along with Akane.  Her bio lists her favorite color as violet, her favorite instrument as the violin, and her favorite animal as bears.

## Riko Kojima

Age 17, member of Utau.  Painfully shy offstage, Riko is only able to overcome her shyness when the spotlights hit the stage; that’s when her happy tones and positive personality shine through with confidence.  She is sensitive, kind, and has a tendency to cry easily.  Her bio lists her favorite color as peach, her favorite instrument as the panpipes, and her favorite animal as cats.
