# Lyrics
Someone said they left together
I ice-slid out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Zephyr
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, "Pull yourself together
Lucy’s costume ain’t even made of leather"
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better

The less I know the better

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
No surprise when you're fightin’ super-crime like every night
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
Lewis is doomed as hell you know so he’ll probably die
So I ice-slide

She said, "It's not now or never
After the doom-track fills, we'll be together"
I said, "Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever"

Don't make me wait forever

Dallex is gonna wait forever

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
I was doing fine without you
'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Giving in to speedster bullshit
Is this what you want, is this who you are?
I was doing fine without you
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
Said, "Come on Zephyr, man, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on Zephyr, man, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on Zephyr, man, say your stupid line"
