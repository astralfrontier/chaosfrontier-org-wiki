> Nick wrote in The Book of Nick that people might be intimidated by me. I wonder why he thinks that. Maybe because I'm not human and humans seem to be scared of things that are not human. On TV shows people tend to assume things that look different and scary to them are scary. I guess when you have to worry about getting hurt a lot of things are scary. I was scared when I didn't know if I could become solid again after trying out going through that wall by becoming a holographic projection. But I don't look scary. At least I don't think I do. I look like a pop idol! Because I am one!

> Yeah, she's especially curious since Nick implies that he believes people essentially "should see that she's friendly and understand that"
> So if NICK knows she's friendly and approachable, why does he think other people are scared of her
> Since logically, he comes to the conclusion that "oh well they should see what I see, too"
> So to her, that doesn't add up
> If Nick sees those things, then she doesn't understand why he would think other people wouldn't think the way he does.
> Her current theory is "Oh, it's because I'm not human, and Nick isn't scared of things that aren't human because he's a superhero; however, normal people will probably be scared of me for that reason"
