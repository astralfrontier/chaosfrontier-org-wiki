# Player Notes
* The conversation started [here](on-music)
* [Melody](https://chaosfrontier.org/games/sycamour-division/book-of-melody#nick-knack):

> Nick wrote in The Book of Nick that people might be intimidated by me. I wonder why he thinks that. Maybe because I'm not human and humans seem to be scared of things that are not human. On TV shows people tend to assume things that look different and scary to them are scary. I guess when you have to worry about getting hurt a lot of things are scary. I was scared when I didn't know if I could become solid again after trying out going through that wall by becoming a holographic projection. But I don't look scary. At least I don't think I do. I look like a pop idol! Because I am one!

> Yeah, she's especially curious since Nick implies that he believes people essentially "should see that she's friendly and understand that"
> So if NICK knows she's friendly and approachable, why does he think other people are scared of her
> Since logically, he comes to the conclusion that "oh well they should see what I see, too"
> So to her, that doesn't add up
> If Nick sees those things, then she doesn't understand why he would think other people wouldn't think the way he does.
> Her current theory is "Oh, it's because I'm not human, and Nick isn't scared of things that aren't human because he's a superhero; however, normal people will probably be scared of me for that reason"

## Stuff Nick wants to talk about

* Nick thinks that Emily at the warehouse party wanted to ask Melody out, and feels bad for ruining it
* Intimidation is being afraid of what _might_ happen
  * People might be scared of not impressing you
* The metaphor of the duet
  * Imagine another girl comes to you. She wants to sing a duet with someone very badly. But .... she's inexperienced.
  * She's afraid if she tries to do a duet with her chosen partner, they will be annoyed, or laugh.
  * Whether or not they _would_ make fun of her, she's _afraid_ they will.
  * If they don't like her singing, then every time she sings, she'll remember, and that would spoil singing for her.
  * For her, it's easier to just keep _imagining_ singing, than to really sing.
  * What would you tell her to do?
* Overcoming fear is hard. I tried to do that at the museum
  * Sometimes it doesn't work out. I thought Zephyr would like me summoning his mentor, but he didn't
  * Mr. Auster didn't want me to go out and fight, but I did it anyway
* When you want something badly enough, you'll overcome fear
  * Nick went after Romanus without even thinking about it
