# Lyrics
When he goes on patrol
Some things that he brings with:
Interrogation gum
Defensive crucifix
Wedding ring of gold
For telepathic links
And clearly he will use his mind over his fists

But he’s still lacking in control
His powers come with risks
Buildings ended up on fire
Trying to protect two kids
But he’s a hero
Saved Amy and Trish
He tells them to stay hidden
A telepathic wish

It’s because he’s a psychic
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, It’s because he’s a psychic
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, It’s because he’s a psychic
It’s because he’s a psychic

He’s been working for Marlone
His goal to stop villains
While in the park alone
Encountered Romanus
A guy who seems to know
Way too much about Nick
And he knows about the factory he wrecked

He said “So you’re all alone?
Hey isn’t your name Nick?
You destroyed another building
Are you proud of what you did?”
He has the logo
Of Sycamour’s kin 
It’s clear that he’s an ally
Of Master of Puppets

And Romanus is psychic
He is also a psychic
Oh, And we know they’re both psychics
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, And we know they’re both psychics
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Heads to the top floor
And he’s extremely pissed
Romanus is in his bathrobe
Angry Nick comes bursting in
He grabs the remote
But rendered helpless
His powers have been burned out
That’s courtesy of Nick

And he’s no longer psychic

Oh, And he’s no longer psychic
Oh, And he’s no longer psychic
Oh, And he’s no longer psychic
