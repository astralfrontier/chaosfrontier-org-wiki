# Lyrics
Zephyr’s mom is why he’s late to prom
Zephyr’s mom is why he’s late to prom
Zephyr’s mom is why he’s late to prom
Zephyr’s mom is why he’s late to prom

Zephyr there’s a dance tonight at the school
(At the school)
Fix your hair or they’ll laugh at you!
(They’ll laugh at you)
If I fight Satan, I’ll make sure to kick
(Sure to kick)
Don’t do that, or your boots will be burning so quick
(Burning so quick)

You know that he’s an hour late it’s a tragedy
And he has got no date
Which his mom cannot believe!

Zephyr’s mom is why he’s late to prom
She looked at him once
And his hair was just all wrong
Zephyr can’t you see
You’ll just use your “wind thingie”
She knows he’s late to prom
But she needs time to act like mom.

Zephyr’s mom is why he’s late to prom
Zephyr’s mom is why he’s late to prom

Zephyr do you remember when mom called your phone
(Called your phone)
Auster was hurt and his voice was all gone 
(Voice was gone)
Used your new windsword to slice the store in half
(The store in half)
To track down Nightquake
And beat him on his behalf 
(Him on his behalf)

And I know that this guy has major super speed
But there’s no walking out
When mom says his hair looks messy

Zephyr’s mom is why he’s late to prom
Auster can’t talk
And no one knows for how long
Zephyr with his speed
Beats up Nightquake quite quickly
And so he’s late to prom
Then he still has to wait on mom

Zephyr’s mom is why he’s late to prom
(She’s why he’s late to prom)
She’s gotten his clothes but his hair is all wrong
(It’s wrong it’s so wrong)
Zephyr can’t you see
You can’t leave your hair sloppy
And make sure when you run
You have gel in
(Zephyr’s mom oh oh)
You have gel in
(Zephyr’s mom oh oh)
Wait a minute
Zephyr can’t you see
You just wait a sec to leave
Your hair’s looking so wrong I’ll
Fix it cuz I’m Zephyr’s mom
