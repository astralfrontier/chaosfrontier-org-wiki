# That day...
Nick is 13. It will be a few years before he meets the rest of the Red Vox team. He's still missing his dad. The dad-shaped hole in his life is currently filled by Mr. Bernard Black, proprietor of Black Books. It's an ill fit. The man was a friend to Nick's author father, and carried some of his books in the shop. But Mr. Black is a bachelor and has neither experience nor patience with children.

Black Books is a *used* book shop. Every book came here from someone's hands, carrying their their feelings into Nick's heart, and he loves it. So Mr. Black lets Nick roam his shop, sort and arrange titles in the back room, or climb up to the attic and read after hours, soaking up the emotional ambiance. Nick won't pester Mr. Black during business hours, and must obey if told to hush up or get out. And the two won't talk about things Mr. Black doesn't want to talk about. This includes almost everything about Nick's father. But there's other topics that are okay.

## On Vinyl
"Why do you like records?" Nick asks. "These are better." He holds up his phone for inspection - even the compact disc is pre-Nick tech.

"Why are they better?" Mr. Black asks in a grouchy voice.

Nick knows he isn't really upset, he just likes pretending to be. So he keeps going. "'Cause. You can fit a buncha songs onto a phone, an' your records only have like--"

"22 minutes for an LP record."

"--right, isn't that, like, way short? I got enough music for days."

Black looks down his glasses at the child who presumes to teach him how to appreciate music. He's smiling inwardly, but doesn't dare show it. "My boy, the _right_ 22 minutes of music is worth your days of mass-produced pop nonsense. 22 minutes is enough to fill the soul to satiety. You're too young for wine, but with a fine wine, one glass is enough. Meanwhile you could be on your sixth glass of diet cola and still be thirsty, couldn't you."

Nick isn't sure he gets it, but it's Mr. Black, he thinks he'll understand someday. And besides, it _sounds_ smart. But the man isn't through talking.

"There's something else. Here, give me this phone, I'll show you." Black makes greedy grabbing gestures, and Nick surrenders his device. The man fumbles with it for a moment, then presents it for inspection. A YouTube video is playing.

> Music is a dreadful thing. What is it? I don't understand it. What does it do?
> It.. It exalts the soul?
> Utter nonsense. If you hear a marching band, is your soul exalted? No, you march. If you hear a waltz, you dance. If you hear a mass, you take communion. It is the power of music to carry one directly into the mental state of the composer. The listener has no choice.

Nick looks up, watching Mr. Black for a moment.

> "This is how it is... ," the music is saying. "Not how you are used to being. Not how you are used to thinking. But like this."

Black smiles. "Well. Perhaps too high-flown for young minds. But .. maybe this is easier. In those 22 minutes of music, do you want music that sounds like how you already feel, or are you there to experience what the music is telling you?"

"What it's... telling me?" Nick asks.

Black nods. "You read feelings from things. For those not so gifted, music serves the same purpose. Let me tell you something about vinyl. It's not encoded, digitized, compressed, tagged, or anything else. It is irrepressibly *itself*. When the needle enters the groove, sound will come out. The record cannot help but be heard the way it is."

Nick nods. "So.. it helps you make a connection.. to whoever made the music?"

Black nods. "That's right."

"Can I.. is it okay if I listen to a record sometime?" Nick asks, wide-eyed.

Black scowls. "Only if you put things back in the proper place this time."

"Yessir!"
