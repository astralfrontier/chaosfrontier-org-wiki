# That day...
Nick is 13. It will be a few years before he meets the rest of the Red Vox team. He's still missing his dad. The dad-shaped hole in his life is currently filled by Mr. Bernard Black, proprietor of Black Books. It's an ill fit. The man was a friend to Nick's author father, and carried some of his books in the shop. But Mr. Black is a bachelor and has neither experience nor patience with children.

Man and boy have come to an understanding. Mr. Black will let young Nick roam his shop, sit in the back room or climb up to the attic and read after hours. Nick won't pester Mr. Black during business hours, and must obey if told to hush up or get out. And the two won't talk about things Mr. Black doesn't want to talk about. This includes almost everything about Nick's father. But he'll happily talk about books, and records.

Black Books is a *used* book shop. Every book came here from someone's hands. That's one of the reasons Nick loves coming here. Every book speaks to him in feelings as well as words. Mr. Black doesn't want to hear Nick's excited stories about the feelings he reads from the shop's inventory. But he's glad that the young man is excited about books.
