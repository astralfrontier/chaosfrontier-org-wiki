# That day...
Nick is 13. It will be a few years before he meets the rest of the Red Vox team. He's still missing his dad. The dad-shaped hole in his life is currently filled by Mr. Bernard Black, proprietor of Black Books. It's an ill fit. The man was a friend to Nick's author father, and carried some of his books in the shop. But Mr. Black is a bachelor and has neither experience nor patience with children.

Black Books is a *used* book shop. Every book came here from someone's hands. That's one of the reasons Nick loves coming here. Every book speaks to him in feelings as well as words. So Mr. Black lets Nick roam his shop, sort and arrange titles in the back room, or climb up to the attic and read after hours, soaking up the emotional ambiance of every book. Nick won't pester Mr. Black during business hours, and must obey if told to hush up or get out. And the two won't talk about things Mr. Black doesn't want to talk about. This includes almost everything about Nick's father. But he'll happily talk about books, and records.
