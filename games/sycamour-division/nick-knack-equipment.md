<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Nick Knack Equipment -->

# Equipment
## Combat
An official Don Drysdale "beanball", thrown at a player's head during a baseball game. Used to **directly engage** a single target at range (the ball returns to Nick's hand when thrown). *Failure*: does more damage, or doesn't return.

A crucifix given as a gift. It helped someone through hard emotional times. Used to **defend** or the **moat flare**, to hold back evil physical or mental influence. *Failure*: the power takes on an overtly holy or religious nature. Unrepentent/unbelieving characters may experience discomfort or pain.

Fidget spinners, associated with nervous energy and violent thoughts. Thrown with telekinetic force. Used to **directly engage** a single target at range. *Failure*: Nick inherits the nervousness and anxiousness in the spinner.

A book of matches, stolen from the police evidence locker for an arson case. Used to create pyrokinetic effects. *Failure*: fire spreads uncontrollably.

Fishing line, used by a father during an important fishing trip with his son. Used for grappling and entangling.

A firefighter's mask. The oxygen feed saved a child's life. Used passively, to create a telekinetic barrier that keeps Nick from getting badly hurt in super-combat.

## Situational
The wheels off Laser Hawk's first board. A source of freedom and safety. Allows Nick to telekinetically operate his own body like a dancer or martial artist, moving with impossible fluidity and grace. *Failure*: Nick becomes impulsive and reckless, willing to try anything.

Zephyr's first running shoes, scorched from super-speed friction and worn down by early power development. Gives huge boosts in running speed and tremendous leaping distance. *Failure*: Nick gains uncontrollable speed and cannot stop moving.

The collar of a service dog, trained for a life of assisting someone in need. Allows telepathic communication with animals and a sense of human beings in need nearby. *Failure*: Nick becomes more instinctual and is compelled to protect and take instructions.

**Requiring approval**: a scrapbook or photo book of kids from the Rube Goldberg orphanage, where the Children of the Night came from. Abilities to be determined, but may provide retrocognition (visions of the past) or clairvoyance.

A pack of DJ's chewing gum, Anna Hel's brand. Anna uses gum to build rapport with interrogation or interview subjects. Used to **unleash your powers** or **pierce the mask** for telepathy. *Failure*: Nick goes into Bad Cop mode, growing more confrontational or aggressive.

A charm bracelet with personalized map charms on it, indicating the places the wearer visited. Used to teleport long distances. *Failure*: one of the charms is expended. Nick goes to the location shown on the charm, rather than his real destination.

A wedding ring, shared between lovers who promised to stay together and keep each other in their thoughts. Used to teleport to someone else who's important to you, or establish a telepathic rapport with them. *Failure*: Nick mentally over-shares with whoever he's thinking about. Nick connects with someone he's attracted to or thinking about.

~~Bruce, a stuffed toy bear. Nick assembles a bunch of environment junk into a giant bear which crushes bad guys. Used to **directly engage** a group of bad guys in melee, or **defend** someone. *Failure*: the giant bear damages the surroundings, smashes more than it should, or diverts from some other threat to protect a child.~~ Given to the villain Dubium in session 5.
