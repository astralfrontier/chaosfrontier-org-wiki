<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Nick Knack Equipment -->

# Equipment
An official Don Drysdale "beanball", thrown at a player's head during a baseball game. Used to **directly engage** a single target at range (the ball returns to Nick's hand when thrown). *Failure*: does more damage, or doesn't return.

~~Bruce, a stuffed toy bear. Nick assembles a bunch of environment junk into a giant bear which crushes bad guys. Used to **directly engage** a group of bad guys in melee, or **defend** someone. *Failure*: the giant bear damages the surroundings, smashes more than it should, or diverts from some other threat to protect a child.~~ Given to the villain Dubium in session 5.

A pack of DJ's chewing gum, Anna Hel's brand. Anna uses gum to build rapport with interrogation or interview subjects. Used to **unleash your powers** or **pierce the mask** for telepathy. *Failure*: Nick goes into Bad Cop mode, growing more confrontational or aggressive.

A crucifix given as a gift. It helped someone through hard emotional times. Used to **defend** or the **moat flare**, to hold back evil physical or mental influence. *Failure*: the power takes on an overtly holy or religious nature. Unrepentent/unbelieving characters may experience discomfort or pain.

A charm bracelet with personalized map charms on it, indicating the places the wearer visited. Used to teleport long distances. *Failure*: one of the charms is expended. Nick goes to the location shown on the charm, rather than his real destination.

A wedding ring, shared between lovers who promised to stay together and keep each other in their thoughts. Used to teleport to someone else who's important to you, or establish a telepathic rapport with them. *Failure*: Nick mentally over-shares with whoever he's thinking about. Nick connects with someone he's attracted to or thinking about.

A book of matches, stolen from the police evidence locker for an arson case. Used to create pyrokinetic effects. *Failure*: fire spreads uncontrollably.

Fishing line, used by a father during an important fishing trip with his son. Used for grappling and entangling.

A firefighter's mask. The oxygen feed saved a child's life. Used passively, to create a telekinetic barrier that keeps Nick from getting badly hurt in super-combat.
