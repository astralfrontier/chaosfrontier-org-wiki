# Confession
* Talk with Zephyr: I'm done running away
* Interactions with Caesar: sharing
* What I feel doesn't feel like others, because it's what I, myself, feel. My feelings are unique
* I don't want to take, I want to give, like I did with memories to Caesar
* I'm sorry I made you worry
* You don't have to do anything about this
* No matter what, you will always be my best friend, and that's a great thing to be
