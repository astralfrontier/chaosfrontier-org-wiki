<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Nick Notes -->

## What does Nick want to say?
* "You said we could talk about anything" - [source](session-14a)
* "I talked to Zephyr. He helped me realize that it's really annoying when someone runs away from their feelings. So I don't want to do that any more." - [source](session-18)
* "I didn't know what I felt about you. What I felt didn't feel like the attraction I felt from other people, toward the people they liked."
* "It doesn't feel the same, because this is my feeling. Nicholai Andreyevich Hel loves you, Aya."
* "Giving Caesar my memories realized how much I love sharing. I don't want to take. I want to give."
* "The world is full of beautiful, amazing, wonderful things. I want to show them to you, and see you smile at them, because that's the most beautiful, amazing, wonderful thing of all, when you are happy."
* "I'm sorry I made you worry."
* "You're wondering what you should do, or what you're supposed to do. Nothing. Only do what you _want_ to do."
* "And maybe right now you don't know what that is. That's fine. If so, then just, keep being my friend, and that's enough."

## Bad Guy Fears
* "If you ever became a bad guy, or got reprogrammed, I wanted you to know what I felt."
* "But also, my mom asked us to track him down, and we did. We fought a warehouse full of robots to get him back. And I don't even like that guy."
* "Because we are your friends, if you get taken away from us, we would come get you the same way."
* "The whole world couldn't stop me, if I was coming to find you."
* "But we don't get to reprogram you either. You get to choose what you want to do."
