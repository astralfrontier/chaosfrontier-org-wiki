I JUST WRECKED A MUSEUM I'M SORRY

Okay, that's not all I did today.

BUT I WRECKED A MUSEUM

AND I MET SOME HEROES

Breathing is important. I feel better now. Okay.

I went to the Q. It's got a real name, like Arthur something something Memorial Museum, but nobody cares, from the air the building is shaped like a giant Q, so that's what people call it. It's a museum to Halcyon City's heroes, past and present. There's an open-air park at the center of the space, and a small food court type deal. Their gyros are good but really greasy.

You can always tell the tourists, they're the ones taking pictures of everything. If you live in the city, you don't need pictures. Once you go there, you remember it. People in the Q aren't just storybook characters or strangers. It's people you've seen in the city, sometimes people you've met. Neighbors.

This is the place I wrecked by the way. Good job, me.

Anyway. There was a guy there, staring up at the statue I'd come to see. It was Zephyrus. She'd just died awhile ago, while saving people. It had got to my mom, and got to me though. When I'd first gone to the Q, there were huge crowds around it. Every time I came back, there were fewer and fewer people. They hadn't forgotten her. They'd just wanted to come get their grief out. Then the museum enshrined her with the pantheon of other fallen heroes. There was a little plaque there, explaining her story. I'd touched it, once or twice. It was overwhelming with feeling. I didn't want to do that any more.

The guy saw me coming. But as I did, there was a big explosion nearby. I saw him glance up at the statue, and get a very angry look on his face. Then he ran off, faster than anything. I didn't know at the time, but that was Zephyr!

Of course I followed. What had happened?

The mayor was in the middle of dedicating a new exhibit. A group of bad guys, some kinda weirdos in gas masks, were there. They had grenades that did different things. They'd thrown some grenades that coated a bunch of stuff in gasoline, including some people. The Red Warden was a hero on guard duty, so he couldn't just blast them, or a bunch of stuff would catch fire. But Zephyr rushes in, grabbing for the grenades before they could do any more.

Then this dude on a laser skateboard - Laser Hawk, I found out later - comes zipping over the top of the exhibit! He lands right in front of the biggest guy in the gang, and smacks him with the skateboard! Like Wham Pow, like I swear I thought there was going to be sound effect bubbles. He makes some kind of hand gesture, like a thumbs up type deal, and (the dude I later know is) Zephyr returns it. Like they know each other? That's cool, some kind of established teen hero team?

As I'm watching, this girl comes up beside me, and blasts some gas-mask goons with a sonic shout! She's strange looking but really pretty, like a cartoon character brought to life. And she looks at us all and says, "Oh, sorry! I need a hero name before I can fight!" Like she did something wrong. And I'm like, "uh.. Power Chord?" It was dumb, but it was like I'd given a kid a candy bar or something. So she starts going to town on these guys too.

I've got powers too, but my mom always says to be careful. This didn't seem like a time to be careful.

There's a pack of these guys running toward the mayor, and others have got Zephyr and Laser Hawk pinned down with machine guns. Melody is running at them with some kind of glowing shield up. She's going to save them. Who's got the mayor? I do, I guess.

Beside me is the Gyro Gauntlet, that thing from the 80's, in a glass case. It doesn't work any more - all the operating mechanisms have been carefully taken out. But it's the real thing. I do like I've heard cops do sometimes, wrap my fist in my jacket and punch the glass. That hurt really, really bad. It's not easy. But the glass breaks, and I grab the Gyro Gauntlet. It doesn't need to work. It just needs to remember.

I punch the floor. I'm not sure what the power is going to do, I just remember Gyro King knocking down people by punching the ground, and I try to conjure that up. I feel it, I feel him, like he's over my shoulder, the memory of all his battles flowing through me like red-hot blood. I think, okay, it's gonna work. The ground cracks immediately. Those guys are gonna fall.

Then everything falls. The Red Warden tackles the mayor, grabs hold of some kind of piping, but the whole floor collapses. Me, the other kids, the goons, we all fall into the hole. The mayor is okay, the Warden has him. The civilians are out of the blast radius by now. The other three supers are okay, thanks to their powers. Power Chord - Melody, as it turns out - sort of soft-lands on rubble. Laser Hawk's got some kind of incredible trick he does on his board, like fuck physics. Zephyr's just too fast, he's like jumping off of falling chunks of rubble as they come down, like it's all slow motion for him.

The goons aren't so lucky. But, nobody died!

After that, the four of us got together. The Red Warden came over, with appreciative nods for all of us. Zephyr had put on some kind of mask by then, and Laser Hawk was always wearing one, and it'd be pretty hard to hide Melody anyway, and I was just like, some kid trying to use his jacket to stop his hand from bleeding. We got asked about if we were a team (we weren't, but we'd looked enough like one to the Warden that he asked), and whether we'd ever thought about being a team (we hadn't, like what?).

And that's when I first heard the name "Red Vox", not as just something that existed in Halcyon City, but something that I could be part of.

I knew I'd used the feelings of a hero to save some lives. That day, I swore it wouldn't be the last time.

Okay so that wing of the Q is now closed because they have to repair the floor, fix a lot of the supports, do some other work. Someone said something about "city budget" and that really made me cringe. Like, I don't get a very big allowance, you guys.
