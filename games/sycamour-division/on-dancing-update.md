# I won't kill anyone...
I've realized two things. One. I'm not really great at the actual technical act of dancing. Two. I don't care.

Ayami and I would get together and practice dancing. On the first day, we met in the school gym after hours. Clubs sometimes come in, so the teachers leave it unlocked, you just need to be able to get onto school grounds. During that time, she talked and talked, explaining the basics, showing me the moves, telling me to breathe (I assume this was not from personal experience), and so on. Then I tried it. Predictably, it was a complete disaster. I couldn't move, I couldn't coordinate, I kept getting distracted. I realized later I was fighting it.

The second day, we went for food. I tried ramen noodles and asked Ayami if she wanted to try french fries and mayo (my dad swore by this). And after that, we went to the gym where my mom works out, and asked if we could hang out for a bit. They let us in.

This time, Ayami told me to close my eyes. When I opened them, she was very close to me. There was music playing. "Don't dance," she said. "Just stay close." And she started to move. All I could do was follow. Any time I would look down, or away, she would reprimand me. "Look at my face," she'd say. "Look at my eyes." That's what I did. And as long as I saw her smile, I could at least keep up. When she wasn't telling me to look at her, she kept talking to me, stuff about nothing, telling me about the taste of french fries and mayo.

After a few minutes, we broke apart and she nodded in approval. "That was good."

"What did I do?" I was self-conscious. I was curious. What had been different this time? Had I subconsciously figured it out? Had I somehow used telekinesis to guide myself? What was the secret?

"You did what Nick Hel does best, and felt," she told me.

"But I can't dance!"

"You can't dance _well_. But anyone can dance," she said with sincerity.

I felt doubt well up in me. She is a good dancer. She's graceful, assured, proficient. Would she feel let down at dancing with a goon like me? I swallowed my doubt. I'd let her make that choice, and not make it for her.

I'm not going to the school to put on a show for an audience. I'm there to watch that face, and wait for that smile, and follow her lead. And when she dances with other people, I hope they appreciate not just her skill, but her kindness. She doesn't just dance to be good at dancing. She dances to make her partner good at it too.
