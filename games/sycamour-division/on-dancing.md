# It happened
I asked a girl to go to a dance with me. She said yes. And she said she was going to ask me.

I said earlier we could go as friends, because I don't think she really gets what feelings of love are, or what romance really is. But of course, going dancing with someone means I'll start thinking about those things myself.

One time I was on my phone and my mom said, "that must be something really good on there." I looked up and realized she was staring at me with a smile. And I knew I was grinning, and just hadn't realized it. What was causing it? Melody was asking why shower curtains don't come in pull-up style, like Venetian blinds. And I had no answer, but it was such a great question. But I was just happy to be talking to her.

I have different feelings for all the people I call "best friend". When I'm around Laser Hawk - Dallas, that's a new adjustment - it's like I have front row seats to a hurricane. There's so much energy and motion, but it can be destructive and dangerous too. I worry, but it's also really exciting to be part of that world. And then he goes back to being Dallas, and bottles the hurricane up somehow. And when Grando asked me about going with Zephyr - Lewis - it didn't feel much different than being asked about going with a teacher. I want to learn from Lewis, but also learn about Lewis even more.
