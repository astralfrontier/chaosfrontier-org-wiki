# It happened
I asked a girl to go to a dance with me. She said yes. And she said she was going to ask me.

I said earlier we could go as friends, because I don't think she really gets what feelings of love are, or what romance really is. But of course, going dancing with someone means I'll start thinking about those things myself.

One time I was on my phone and my mom said, "that must be something really good on there." I looked up and realized she was staring at me with a smile. And I knew I was grinning, and just hadn't realized it. What was causing it? Melody was asking why shower curtains don't come in pull-up style, like Venetian blinds, the way window curtains do. And I had no answer, but it was such a great question. But I was just happy to be talking to her.

I have different feelings for all the people I call "best friend".

When I'm around Laser Hawk - Dallas, that's a new adjustment - it's like I have front row seats to a hurricane. There's so much energy and motion, but it can be destructive and dangerous too. I worry, but it's also really exciting to be part of that world. And then he goes back to being Dallas, and bottles the hurricane up somehow.

And when Grando asked me about going with Zephyr - Lewis - it didn't feel much different than being asked about going with a teacher. It felt weird, not bad, just weird. I want to learn from Lewis, but also learn about Lewis even more. And I'm realizing that for how cool Lewis seemed to be early on, it's like he's got a hurricane too, but it's always bottled up, all the time, and it hurts him not to let it out. I want to help him release some of that pressure, before the bottle cracks.

I wouldn't want to be apart from any of these people. But is that romance? Is that attraction?

When I get feelings from the people at school, around their crushes or the people they're dating, it's not like this either. It's just, hunger and confusion. Wanting to touch someone, or be touched, wanting comfort, being lonely, not understanding why they are lonely and only knowing that being with someone else makes it better. Being super afraid to try and make that first contact, because it hurts when it doesn't work. Or just wanting something for yourself, and not caring who gives it to you.

What do I feel about my best friend Ayami?

She's like a lantern that follows me around and makes everything bright. I'm scared someone will take her away and leave me in the darkness again. She made it okay for me to be myself, just by being herself.

And I'm scared that I'd be selfish with that. It's no good if she's my lantern, but all I do is take and take, and don't give anything back. The scariest thing is that she'll be hurt if I'm too selfish. She didn't promise to help me be happy - we promised each other.

Now that I know what it feels like, maybe I could stumble my way through the dark, or find another source of light inside my own heart. But I don't know if anyone would see me one day and ask, "hey, why do you have a big goofy grin on your face?"

It felt like Begonias had a light that went out for her. It felt like she was shut up in the dark, in a house that was a prison. I think she wants to find her own light again, and I couldn't stand the thought that she wouldn't. I don't know how I can help her, but with my friends with me, I know that I have to try.

Is that also love?

I don't know.

It might be that I'm feeling something someone else does.

I think I know who I need to ask about that.
