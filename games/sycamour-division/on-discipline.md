# The day she died...
Before she was a cop, my mother was in the military for awhile. She says it's important to know when to follow an order and when not to. That's one reason she never liked superheroes much. They didn't follow orders well.

Mom says that the point of basic training is to break you down as a person, take out the rebelliousness at the heart of you, and rebuild you again with discipline at your core. I said that sounded scary. She said that the officers took your heart and put it in a box, and that performing your duty earned you the key to open that box again. She said it was important to make the recruits feel fearful, then let them be brave again by working together. That's how you got discipline, by being afraid and relying on your team to withstand it.

Superheroes aren't afraid. That's what I always thought. Mom says it's more complex than that. Mom says that recruit training doesn't work on supers because a sergeant can't make you afraid if you can bounce bullets off your chest, or run for days straight, or shoot sonic blasts from your armpits. If you're never afraid, if you don't give yourself to your team, you never learn discipline.

Mom says discipline would have saved Zephyrus's life.

She says there should have been a plan. Get this Nightquake person out onto a barge or a boat or something, a place where earthquake powers don't work. She says that if Zephyrus had a disciplined team and could take orders, work as part of a unit, it could have happened. She said Zephyrus had been stupid, that all superheroes were stupid, that they needed to learn discipline.

It was easier for her to shout than to cry.

I didn't know how I should feel. I don't have discipline. I didn't have anger to hide behind. Just.. confusion.

When someone is famous for being a hero, that's all you see them as. They're an idol to people around the world. You think, "I'm in trouble, so Zephyrus will come and help me". You think it's going to be okay, because people who care have powers, and they're going to save the day. And then they die, and you remember they're still just people. Like my dad.

I remember Mom saying that one of her fellow officers died in the line of duty, years ago. She said it was quick and clean. A "good death". I heard her say that phrase again, because Zephyrus was helping others.

How can any death be good? Mom still cried, in the end.
