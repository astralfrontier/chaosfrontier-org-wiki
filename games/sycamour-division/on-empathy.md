# The human experience, in diagrams
## The basics: empathy
We know how people feel, because we see them feel it, and then we recognize it in ourselves. And we can realize that we want something, because we see something in the world, and feel its absence in our own life.
## The ghost
You get to know somebody by observing them. When you do that enough, you build up an idea of them in your mind. But that idea is incomplete - you don't know _everything_ they do, or feel, or want. So you fill in the gaps with your own imagination, or what you expect about other people. The result is a fake person, a mixture of memory and imagination. We can call this "a ghost" for now.

In our minds, we don't interact with the real person, but with the ghost. You can try it, yourself. Think of someone close to you. Say something that you think they _would_ say, but that they've never said. Can you do it?

We know something is wrong with our friends and family when the ghost doesn't agree with the real person. Should she be smiling right now? She's not. Why not? That is also empathy.
