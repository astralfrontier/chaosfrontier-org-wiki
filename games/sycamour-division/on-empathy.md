# The human experience, in diagrams
* Empathy
  * You understand feelings by seeing someone else emote, and recognize the feeling in yourself
  * You understand your own feelings by seeing someone else do something, and recognizing you want it too
* Love is recognizing you want to do romantic things with someone else
