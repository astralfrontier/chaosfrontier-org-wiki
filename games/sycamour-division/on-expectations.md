# Dads and Decisions
When we stopped the Cockroach King, Zephyr went after the people in the bank first. I really admired that. He was fast and capable, and he got everyone out. Then he disarmed the guys with guns, while all I could do was hold back their bullets. He even went after the cash when some of the bad guys were getting away.

When we got sent to the other bank, Zephyr stayed behind with the grown-ups. They had important stuff to talk about. He's even got a bad guy of his own, Nightquake. They're like real enemies and stuff. it's someone who goes after big targets. Zephyr is avenging someone who gave him powers, I think.

He knew all about the Amber Alert situation with Dallas and said don't worry about it. It just got taken care of.

When we went to the warehouse party, he set up beer pong, like a grown-up. It was just a regular thing he does. When we were at the hospital, he just regenerated his injuries with his powers. He knows what to say to people.

My dad has been gone for awhile. But I remember him being like this. He was cool and confident. He was easy-going. He was a writer, of all kinds of things. Adventure stories, magazine articles, mysteries, true crime, non-fiction stuff even. He was a ghost-writer too. He'd take someone else's ideas and make them incredible. And then his body betrayed him. He was still smiling the whole time. I'd never seen him bald before, I always thought he'd have his hair forever, like grandpa. And then he got smaller, and smaller, and you could see his veins, and he was still smiling.

Is Zephyr going to be like that? Will he just be cool, even if something kills him? If Nightquake hurts him like the earlier speedster got hurt, is he just going to keep smiling?

Is he gonna settle down, find someone to love, become a dad? I think he'd make a great dad to someone.

When he does all this stuff, though, what does he feel? When my mom is a cop, which is such a hard job, I can feel it on everything she touches, I can feel her exhaustion, her anger, her frustration. It's like a hot sauce or oil she coats things with when she handles them, squeezed out of a bottle of stress inside her soul. I know when she yells at me she's really yelling at her job. But how does she just keep doing things? How did my dad do all the stuff he did? He never stopped working.

How does Zephyr feel? What does he hold back from telling us, to make things easier on us? When Zephyr has to be grown-up, is it hard on him? Does he ever just want to relax and be a goofy kid? Or is he too cool for that?

What is Zephyr's dad like?
