# What do I believe about ghosts?
Laser Hawk isn't sure if ghosts exist. Melody doesn't know if ghosts are good or bad.

I know ghosts are real. I don't know about actual dead people haunting a house or anything. But I know what I've experienced.

My mom says high schools used to have lockers. We don't really use them. They used to pass notes. Now they use wifi. Everyone keeps their stuff in their backpack or on their ipad. All the important stuff of their lives, all jumbled together. Their books, notebooks, pens, whatever. Every time they use part of their backpack to do something that matters, they leave a little bit of themselves behind. So if I touch a backpack, I feel all of that. It's like looking at someone through a kaleidoscope, or a funhouse mirror. Or when they're on the bus and they swing their backpack around, because they aren't being careful, and it touches me.

There's places in the changing rooms near the gym I don't want to go, because of things that happened there to kids. There's bullying and unhappiness. I don't know what the girls' rooms are like, but I hope it's better.

There's places at the karaoke club and restaurant too. There's tables I don't want to sit at, because I feel the shouting and arguments and anger that someone left behind. Some people are repeat customers. I don't know their faces, but I feel it when they are near, and I remember what they experienced. It makes me uncomfortable.

What is a ghost? "An apparition of a dead person which is believed to appear or become manifest to the living". If what I experience from what people leave behind isn't a ghost, then I don't know what that word even means.

I'm writing in this book cause I don't trust how easily that stuff can get stolen. I don't want anyone learning my secrets, or the secrets I know about everyone else.
