# Cough, Cough
When I got sick, I was told to stay home from school.

It wasn't my fault I got sick. It's just something that happened to me. I was minding my own business. I can't even see the germs that got into my lungs or whatever.

But I have to stay home anyway. Why? Because those germs will get into others' lungs. Because if I go where other people are, I'll get them sick too. I'll hurt them. Getting sick wasn't my fault. But hurting others, knowing it could happen? *That* would be my fault.

If I hurt people at a party, or at the mall, or wherever, maybe I shouldn't be there. It doesn't make me a bad person to have the power I have. But I'm a bad person if I knowingly go places where I could hurt someone accidentally.

I have responsibilities. I have to keep people safe. Sometimes that means keeping them safe from me. Sometimes it's hard to know just how to do that. Sometimes I get scared. And Zephyr asks me if I'm running from my embarrassment. I'm not. I'm trying to run away so people are safe. But sometimes that's not enough. And people like Melody remind me it's okay, I can do it.

Grando didn't give up. Lucy and Alex didn't give up. They avoided Caesar when he was Romanus, because they knew they'd hurt someone else if they got close to him. But they didn't give up.

I'm not giving up. I just need to figure it out.

You can take stuff to keep from getting sick. There's ways the police have to suppress superpowers. Or maybe I can get some kind of calming meditative objects from like a Buddhist temple or something. There's got to be a way.

I'll find it. I promised someone I'd help her be happy. She would be disappointed if I didn't try. And the rest of my team needs me too.
