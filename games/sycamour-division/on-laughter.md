# It's funny...

It bothers me a little bit that I know what kind of villain I'd be. I'd be the socially withdrawn kid who got pushed around one too many times. I'd be the one they made fun of, because I was weird, and they didn't understand me. I'd use my telepathy to link everyone's mind together, and create a whole group consciousness for everyone. Then they'd have to understand. That'd show them!

There would be heroes who try to stop me. And they'd say things like "it's our differences that make us special".

And they'd be right.

I didn't always believe that. I just didn't want to be a villain, any kind. And just once in awhile, I think that glueing people's minds together wouldn't be villainous.

And I'd be wrong.
# Sonder Over Yonder
When my dad was getting care, we talked a lot about words and writing. There were two words that stuck with me. They came from ["The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows"](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com), about feelings for which we have no name.

> **sonder**: The profound feeling of realizing that everyone, including strangers passed in the street, has a life as complex as one's own, which they are constantly living despite one's personal lack of awareness of it.

> **vemödalen**: the frustration of photographing something amazing when thousands of identical photos already exist—the same sunset, the same waterfall, the same curve of a hip, the same closeup of an eye—which can turn a unique subject into something hollow and pulpy and cheap, like a mass-produced piece of furniture you happen to have assembled yourself.

Why does laughter bother me? It's not just when they laugh at me. It's when they laugh at anybody. Sonder is real. Sonder is the word for what I feel all the time. The fear of a boy looking with longing at another boy, afraid to say anything and afraid of staying silent forever. The love of a girl for spiders and the hypnotic webs they spin, when her mother just wants to smash the awful things. The unaccountable dread a child has for the closet. The way the phrase "cellar door" can be the most beautiful thing in the world.

Why would you laugh at a life as real and important as your own? How could you possibly belittle someone for being just like you, only different?

Vemödalen is a consequence of sonder. Our world is all the same, but all our minds are unique. We take the seeds of ideas and plant them in others' minds with language. But the plant that produced the seed, and the new blossom that arises, will never be quite the same. But we don't appreciate the uniqueness of each growing idea in its own soil, because we can't experience the reality of any idea but the one in our own minds.

# But who am I?
Melody, you taught me that it's okay to be irrepressibly yourself, and be happy with it. Laser Hawk, you showed me that the only thing more important than keeping your secret was saving my life. Zephyr, you reminded me that even when people criticize you, doing what's right is more important.

Grando and Dubium and Absentia taught me stuff too. They're not bad people now. They were made to be bad people, but not by anyone who understood them. They were just tools of someone else's will. And when Grando punched me, it wasn't because he was being a bad guy. It was to protect someone important to him.

I get so confused about who's feeling something, sometimes. But I know this much:

When I feel like a hero, when I feel like I'm saving people and stopping bad things from happening, almost nobody around me is doing that. No one at school. No one I bump into on the street. It's (almost) always me.

That feeling is **my** inner life. So if someone laughs at me, I might laugh along. I know, better than them, who I am. I don't know who I'll be, someday. But I know myself now, and that's enough.
