# I don't have a girlfriend
But I might someday. I told Ayami Kobayashi that I was in love with her.

I mean it didn't go _great_. She started crying. Not encouraging at first. But it sounded like she had some thoughts about love and she wanted to share those. We hugged for awhile, and I kissed her, and I think she liked it. We might even be going on a date sometime soon.

But right now, we are friends. She wants to figure out how she feels and what she wants. And for all the things I want to share with her, all the great things about the world that I want her to witness. I even told her that. I want to be her companion as she experiences the world, I want to open her eyes to all that's good about life, and learn from her everything that I might have overlooked myself.

Why didn't I encourage her to try this experience? "Be my girlfriend, try it out," I could have said.

She has to make her own choices. She's afraid of being reprogrammed, and I'm afraid of reprogramming her.

Our team is all under contract with Red Vox. We're locked into situations at work. Our parents or guardians control us in their ways. Our own life experiences open our eyes, but also limit us too. We want to go to the edge of what's possible and see beyond it, but we also risk falling off the edge. Life is a balance between pushing forward and holding back.

I hold back too. Maybe Ayami will find out she really loves somebody else. Maybe I'd have to ignore my own feelings, stay friends with her, and encourage her, the way Lewis encouraged me with her. That experience would change me too. Push me forward, but change me. Like a mystery novel, the more you read, the more clues you get and the better you understand the situation, but soon the mystery is going to be solved, and it may not be the ending you want or expect.

I owe it to her to keep reading anyway.
