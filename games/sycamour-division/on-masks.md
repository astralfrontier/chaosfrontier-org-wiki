# Skateboards and superheroics
Every so often, Laser Hawk calls me up to go "jamming". I think the name comes from ["jam skating"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_skating), because that's what I looked up and found. Jam skating is like dancing but on roller skates. Laser Hawk rides a skateboard but it makes sense he'd know about other kinds of skating, right? Anyway, the article talks about it like it's sort of competitive, sort of fun, and there's competitions, like rap battles kind of thing. But it's artistic and freeing. So that's also why I think it's what he means.

Anyway, jamming isn't really skating for us. It means going on superhero patrol. We put on our masks (well, Laser Hawk already wears his), and we go out and we fight crime. Well, we don't actually fight very much crime, but we really try hard to find some.

In Halcyon City, crime happens a lot. It sounds weird but it makes sense. The city is pretty rich because a lot of stuff happens here, like high-tech industry, but a lot of super-battles happen here too, so there's property damage and risk. So there's a bunch of wealth, but the rent is cheap. That's why my mom says she likes it here. That means people who want to make money through crime will come to Halcyon more often than anywhere else. And bigger superhero teams are too busy or too bored to stop it, so smaller groups, like ours, get to do it.

But mostly it's an excuse to just go from rooftop to rooftop like on television, crouching down on the edge of the roof and looking cool while we chill out and talk. I'm in my gas mask which isn't really stylish, and Laser Hawk's got his cool helmet that does the voice thing, so it feels like I'm with a real superhero. But he doesn't mind. And if we hear an alarm, or police sirens, or whatever, we go after it. And it's fun, and there can be battles, and we try to be stylish while we do it. It feels like a dance-off against the bad guys.

I think Laser Hawk is lying about being on the student council at our school. I think he has secrets he wants to keep, and every time I think it's bad for him to hide his face from me, I remember this diary, and I choose to be okay with it. I wouldn't want him looking in here and seeing how uncool I am. We wouldn't go jamming any more, I think. I don't want that.
