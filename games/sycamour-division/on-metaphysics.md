# The Soul
While we were training her mental resistance, Ayami asked about the soul. I'd made some off-hand remark like "I felt that in my soul". So I want to answer every question I can think of, that she might have.

## What did I mean by that?
"I felt that in my soul" is an idiom. It's an expression or a phrase that just means "I experienced a deep emotional reaction to something I just witnessed". The idiom comes from the idea that people have an element of themselves called a "soul" which is essential or fundamental to their existence.
## What is a soul?
We use the word "soul" to mean many things, the way we use the word "art". What is art? Art is a label we use to discuss many things. There is no objective measurement for what is or isn't art. But when we use the word "art", we know roughly what we are talking about.

Some people use "soul" to refer to a religious concept. I don't know what other people believe, but I don't have any beliefs about this, so I'm going to skip over it. Someone else who knows more should talk about it.
### The soul as essential nature
There is a secular use of the word "soul". It can refer to the experience of being alive, or the experience that you are having an experience. When I am looking at clouds, or feeling someone's happiness through touching something they own, or listening to a song, or reading a book, these are experiences I am having. But what is the "I" in that sentence? Some people would say that the "I" is a single instance of a soul.

Suppose that you met someone who really wanted to be a superhero. She dedicated her life to it, and made sacrifices or choices in order to be a superhero. It was important to her. When problems came up that a superhero would be good at solving, she was good at solving them. You could say that that person had "the soul of a superhero". Her basic nature, the _way_ in which she interacts with the world and the way she perceives the world, focus on being a superhero.

My dad was a writer and my mom is a cop. They do those things as their jobs. But you could also say that my dad had the soul of a romantic, because the things he wrote about, and the things he said and did, had an aspect that you could call "romantic".
### The soul as remainder
Another way to look at the soul is the idea of removing things. If you took away all my psychic props, took me away from my family and my friends, even took my memories away, what would be left? As a human being, I would have a body. But I would also be conscious, and make choices. What would I do? The sorts of things I would choose to do could also be called "my soul". Maybe I would be afraid. Maybe I would be bold, and try to find out the mystery of why I was alone and amnesiac. Maybe I would quietly accept it.

Right now, Caesar is going through the same thing. He's forgotten part of his life. He has people telling him different things. Whatever is in his soul will determine what he does next.
