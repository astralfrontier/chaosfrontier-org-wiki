# What do I feel about music and dating?
When I was a freshman, there was a dance. I was operating the music system, because other people were dancing and I wasn't. Some kid handed me a CD he'd mixed for this girl. He put a lot of time into it, and had handled it a lot. All those feelings he had about her were still on it, and when I touched it, I felt it too.

I didn't know what was going on. I looked across the gym and happened to see her looking in our direction. Because of that CD, I thought she was interested in me, and I thought I liked her all of a sudden, so I went and tried talking to her after that. It didn't go well at all. She laughed at me and he found out and was angry at me.

When Melody asked me about dating, I remembered that time. I always thought love songs were about how love is supposed to work, but they aren't. But music and dating are still connected. When we want to connect with someone, we have music and dancing.

Melody is supposed to sing those songs, but she said she doesn't sing about dating, and doesn't know about dating. Why hasn't someone asked her out already? Maybe they are intimidated by her. But she's really nice and friendly and approachable, everyone should know that.

I remember the stupid party. I sometimes wonder if that girl Erica was trying to do the same thing from back then. If the music was a CD she mixed for Melody. That would be great. I feel bad that I ruined it for them. I made a mess of everything.

Books are easier than music for me.
