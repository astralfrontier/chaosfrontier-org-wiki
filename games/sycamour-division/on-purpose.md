# It happened like this
Today, my powers let me do some good, and save some important people.

It feels so good to write that.

Mr. Auster was guarding the museum. Some guys had gone there to kill him. I think their plan was like this:

1. Phase the museum into a place where the cops and heroes can't get to it
2. Kill the guy who can create barriers protecting the museum and its exhibits from attack
3. Take the exhibits and use them for nefarious purpose

So Zephyr and Laser Hawk took care of items 1 and 3, by beating up the phasing dude and the hammer dude. Everyone stopped item 2, because we thwarted the assassination attempt on Mr. Auster. And then Melody took care of the void person outside.

What did Nick Knack do?

Nick teleported into the security room and found Mr. Auster. Nick told Mr. Auster we had to stop the bad guys. Nick kept that person busy long enough for his friends to come support him, then took him down to the cops. Nick put the adult heroes back in the fight when they had been pinned down by the gravity from the micro-black-holes. And Nick kept Melody from being pulled into one.

Nick Knack didn't save the day by himself. But he contributed.

It's hard for me to have friends, because I talk too much, or I get other peoples' feelings confused with my own, and cause problems. But this is real. This didn't come from anyone else. This was all me.

I wish I could quit school and just be a superhero all the time. I could do more good that way. And if someone got hurt, it would always be a bad guy.

Then again, I don't know what would have happened if we'd lost Melody. I don't know how I could handle that. Laser Hawk and Zephyr were okay, but that void villain was pretty strong.

I'll just have to get stronger.
