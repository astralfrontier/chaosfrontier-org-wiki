Red Vox is a hero company headquartered in Halcyon City that pays and orders multiple heroes and hero teams to protect the lives of citizens, prevent crime and supernatural disasters, and to save the world. It is considered as "One of the most prestigious and effective hero companies in the history of Halcyon City".
 
Red Vox was founded by Vinny Gilmour and Mike Bonham, otherwise known as "Red Riot", and "Vox Populi" (respectively), in the 15th of May of 1960. It was incorporated as Red Vox (in reference to its founders) on 23rd of July of 1967, and became an government-approved branch of law, as well with all other hero companies that pass the rigorous "Silver Standard" test, a constant even up to this day.
After its first major triumph, Red Vox had begun recruiting heroes in exchange for money. They had already done so prior to passing the Silver Standard, but not in a scale as big as this. Pink Floyd, Davy Bow, The Who and many others went on to join Red Vox's system. Over the years, Red Vox quickly became the standard for other hero companies due to aiding in stopping many world-ending scenarios, such as the Dragon Lord's brief reign over Washington, or the massive infernal forest fire instigated by Hunter.
 
Their history, however, was not without its many controversies. The biggest of them, by far, was when Vox Populi left the team in 1968, only a year after they became a proper organization. As quoted from Vox Populi himself,
"Red Vox lost its way when it became bigger than it was supposed to. It's way over its head, and, eventually, will collapse under its own hubris."
