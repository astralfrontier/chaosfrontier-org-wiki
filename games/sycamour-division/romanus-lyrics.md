# Lyrics
R-O-M-A-N-U-S
His name’s Romanus, his name was Ceasar
A Sycamour villain
Pissed off our Nova, his plot was over
That’s in episode eleven

Approaching a drunk, talking such shit
He requested an autograph from Nick?
He was watching TV, he didn’t forsee 
When we’d just burst in

Wears posh clothes and has a different colored eye
He uses mind control to cheat and steal and lie
He forces evil on the Children of the Night
So our team psychic will short circuit out his mind

Who mind controlled Absentia?
Who do the Children fear?
Who really has it out for us?
R-O-M-A-N-U-S
Marlum burned down his orphanage
His memories disappeared
That’s when he bought some fancy suits
R-O-M-A-N-U-S
R-O-M-A-N-U-S

After the pain train, consciousness regained
His memories were no more
He’ll be arrested but he attested
Don’t know what happened before

They locked him up, questioned the kid
Are they gonna put him away for this?
We got a message it was distressing
Here is what it said

Anna told us his bail was paid off by some guy
Claiming to be his dad obviously a lie
We checked his background and found something wasn’t right
And we found out he can’t sleep without his nightlight

What have they gone and done with him?
I’m sure it’s what we fear
Detective Hel, it’s obvious:
R-O-M-A-N-U-S
Probably more experiments
They’re wiping his mind clear
It’s not the Ceasar we rescued
R-O-M-A-N-U-S
R-O-M-A-N-U-S

R-O-M-A-N-U-S
You know he’ll fuck with your head
R-O-M-A-N-U-S
He will get inside your head

R-O-M-A-N-U-S
There’s that dread

So we just took him back with us at least we tried
But then he upped and ran away back to that guy
He can’t be reasoned with can’t convince him we’re right
And now we have prom in 2 hours what a night

We need to put a stop to this
Marlum’s the villain here
He’s the one twisting the truth
R-O-M-A-N-U-S
Sycamour is out for us
We always interfere
We’re gonna come to rescue you
R-O-M-A-N-U-S
R-O-M-A-N-U-S
