# Session 0 Summary
- Equinox wasn't here, so we went ahead with PC introductions
- Nick Knack, Laser Hawk, and Zephyr introductions (see character sheets in G Docs for details)
- Zephyr is Australian, a transfer student - newest to the team

Relationship building - Equinox might be left out?

- Nick and Laser Hawk go out crimefighting to blow off steam, but LH won't tell Nick his secret ID to avoid spoiling that dynamic
- LH met Nick during a burning building rescue incident
- LH hides powers from mother, complex family situation
- Zephyr - legacy - why do people respect it? Because they care. DCAU's "Flash and Substance"
- Only one power holder at a time, the power transfers from person to person
- Zephyrous, Greek God of the west wind. For now, Lewis only uses "Zephyr", to build up to it
- Nightquake, the legacy enemy: darkness and earth control, the natural enemy of a speedster. It might be its own Legacy?
- Zephyr has had powers for ~months, maybe 12 months?
- Zephyr and LH had a race,
  - LH scuffed the former Zephyr statue by accident?
  - Crashed into Det. Hel's squad car during that race?
  - Maybe our relationship went down at that point?
- Nick blurted out something about Zephyr's history with his predecessory, Z explained the situation
  - Citizens trapped in rubble during fight with Nightquake
  - Lewis was helping, previous Z took a hit for him & died

Stormbringer: the Spellbook

When our team came together...
- LH: we saved someone important. Who? A retired superhero, now an important civic figure (mayor?) - Quantum Punch, Dan Denver
  - Powers granted longevity
  - Was Mayor Denver associated with Red Vox? Probably not. Independence.
- Zephyr: we impressed an established hero. Who? The Red Warden, a fire-based guy.
  - Was he from Red Vox? How good are they? They're the default hero association, most popular, maybe most capable.
- Nick: we destroyed something? The Overwatch option: we were at a hero museum that got trashed
  - Villain was there for political reasons?
  - Red Warden was there as security for the dingus, Red Warden was impressed with our priorities
- Equinox: we paid a high cost for victory? defer to next week - high cost may not be immediate apparent

Where do we meet up? Equinox's sanctuary, or...?

Lewis: post-super-battle, we're hanging out somewhere. Karaoke place, we meet on the roof and head in...
