## Protect the shipment!

  * Red Vox thinks it'll be attacked by Sycamour
  * Marlone is confused by the order

* How do we get over there without getting bored? LH is never bored by skating.
* Heroes are off in the distance.. killing dragons.

* Shipment is delayed, seller hasn't shown up. Burly guys are moving empty boxes around
* What should we look out for? LH assesses -> 11
  * No intel on who'll attack shipment
  * iron supplements for Dubium & Iron Maiden
  * What here can we use to.. fortify our position? Use machinery to block off entrances to the area, then tell the workers to clear out for safety.
  * How can we best end this quickly? Zephyr can walk on water, can warn guys at ship to go at flank speed when need be

## Suspicion

* Nick gets a text from Anna Hel, a picture of Absentia. They're in the museum of heroics we visited earlier. Anna: aren't they from that group you fight? Nick: yep. Anna: we managed to get a tracker on them before they got away.
* LH: should we split up? Melody: haven't you seen movies? Nick: we know who we're not fighting at least?
* Can we dispatch Zephyr to keep track of Absentia? Yes!
* In two hours, nothing has happened
* Nick: we gave Marcus to Red Vox. We gave the Apprentice to the cops. I think something dirty is going on.
* Melody: I don't wanna be a bad guy. Nick: I'm sure you'd be good at it.
* Nick: we should chase Absentia. Melody agrees. LH wants to... Okay, let's go!
* We give the guys here a contact number to call. We think this is a diversion.

## The Real Plot?

* Absentia's tracker is still going on. Wouldn't the bad guys see the tracker? Apparently not.
* Currently walking casually, inside a building. Same kind of territory as factory from earlier. The area of town where you can stash away evil children with superpowers. Slums are nearby.
* Do we make any preparations?
  * Stealth isn't our thing. Nick will teleport the team to the roof.
  * Based on what we remember from last time, we might expect security.
* No sign of Zephyr. He's probably nearby.
* First floor is some kind of industrial thing. Second floor is bakery. No doorway, might be a fire escape leading up here, or an access hatch.
* Alternate stealth approach: can Melody go through walls? Mel: don't know what will happen. Will try to spy! Phasing.. -> 8. Marks Afraid that she can't undo it.

* Cut to.. Absentia texting something to Marlum - not Marlone - Marlum
* Melody sees Absentia unsuiting, but underneath it is normal clothes. Absentia spots the tracker in the suit! Throws suit away, tracker slides off but is not broken.
* Dubium checks in on Absentia, Melody is unseen.
* Melody will imitate Nick! Mark Angry to gain telekinesis, to pull tracker into her hands & through the ceiling. -> 5
* A pillar of light draws the tracker upward, drawing attention from the villains
* Melody feels bad about failing, Nick & LH reassure her.
* Footsteps from below, increasingly coming closer.
* Nick: let's try talking to them before we fight

# Befriending the Children
## We talk to them

* We see Grando. "OMG." "how do you know we're here?" Nick: "Hi." G: "Answer." Nick: "There's a tracking device."
* Absentia in casual clothing.
* G: "OMG. Get out." Nick: "can we talk?" G: "What?" Nick: "I said, can we talk?" Melody: "Nick means he wants to have a conversation." LH: "We're good talkers! We'll use our words."
* LH's mask modulates his voice.
* Absentia runs up. "What do you want?" Nick: "we wanna talk to you about what's going on?"
* Nick tries to build common ground about Amy & Trish. "The attempted kidnapping?" "It was a pretty good attempt, I'll give ya that."
* Grando: we don't need your words. Nick: is the person with the iron powers here? Grando: she's not a good talker. Nick: I just wanna ask her a question.
* When Nick got the teddy bear (Bruce), he thinks someone was beating her (Dubium). Nick wants to know is she doing better? Grando is shocked.
* Nick gained a critical opportunity. Who will take it?
* Absentia sighs. "No." Glaring, more territorial than aggressive.
* Nick: "We think you got infused with powers. We just want to make sure you're okay." A: "You know about the factory? It was destroyed." Nick: "yeah we were kind of involved in that."
* Grando wants us to leave.
* LH: "Absentia, you don't have to do this." A: silence.
* Melody: "why are you guys doing this?"
* Grando's foot was forward, in aggressive stance. He's being cornered. Absentia: "we're not doing this because we have a choice, you know." G is angry, but doesn't say anything.
* LH: "alex, you don't need to make this choice alone." A: !
* Melody: "maybe we can help you. we don't have to be against each other. If you tell us what's going on, maybe we can work together."
* Footsteps. Dubium, looking sad and forlorn. "They burned our orphanage." Nick: "who?" D: "THEY". Meaning Sycamour.

## Revelation

* Nick unmasks, waves to Dubium. "We've had second thoughts about our organization too."
* Dramatic reactions. Grando's much less angry.
* Melody: "I don't want to do bad things, I don't wanna be a bad guy. Don't know who the bad guys are. Sounds like you don't wanna be bad guys either."
* LH realizes importance of all this, but if he reveals his ID now, maybe Absentia feels betrayed. And he doesn't like Grando knowing his secret either.
* Player discussion of where to go next.
* LH to Absentia: "You know who I am. You were there when I first used my ability. You know you can always turn to me for help." Absentia realizes who LH really is, based on this.
* Absentia: "They mind controlled us into believing this is normal. It didn't work."
* Melody: "I'm sorry you had to go through that."
* Dubium: "you said you had doubts about your own group." Nick: "Yep." D: "tell us more." Nick: "How did Cockroach King escape Red Vox?" D: "We were never told."
* Nick: "we got told to go somewhere else." Melody: "I think they pranked us. Not a nice prank."
* Dubium looks at Absentia, Absentia looks shocked. "Does Red Vox know you suspect?" "Nope"
* Absentia sighs. "It would make sense if they were working together."
* "Do you have a plan for how to proceed?" "Talking to you is the plan."

## The Museum Plan

* LH: "do YOU have a plan?" "Not exactly. We've tried to leave. They have an agent."
* Nick describes Romanus. "Is that who you're talking about?" Grando: "That's Romanus. You encountered him?" Nick: "I was kinda drunk at the time but yeah." LH facepalms
* Grando: "So you know what it's like... If we can get rid of him, we can stop this."
* Nick: "I've got telepathy, rest of my team is really strong."
* Grando: "it's not that simple." Camera pans over to the heroics museum.
* Tomorrow at 12, the organization is planning a takeover of the museum.
* M: what do they want? G: the museum is full of artifacts. They want us to help.
* LH: like that one.... Nick: that did the thing? Melody: I know!
* Nick: can we put you in touch with someone? - D: if we stay out of the fight, it won't matter much. Senior Sycamour people are strong. Nick: let's talk to Anna Hel.
* G: "OMG." Melody: "is that your catch phrase?" Dubium holds hand over mouth, "yeah..." Melody: "having a catch phrase is really cool!"
* Absentia: "Nick. You can lead us there?" Nick: "yeah." We should get going.
* Nick will phone ahead to let mom know to expect us. Send selfie with Children of the Night.
* Mom: "WHAT."
* Nick: "Mom says it's okay."
* We'll take them to Nick's house, letting mom know where we're going. LH: we shouldn't take them to the police department.
* Nick teleports the group roof to roof. Nobody notices because of higher roofs, plus dragons.

## At Home
![](https://i.imgur.com/OEJT3iBh.jpg)

* Tea, television, party at Nick's house! Don't go in his room, it's a mess.
* LH turns on "Home Alone". Explains to Melody what a prank is. With difficulty.
* The rules of pranks: either the victim has to be laughing, or has to be a bad guy.
* Is Sports Club bad guys? That's the central question. Melody rethinks helping them with their plans.
* LH spins a web of lies to try and excuse his apparent knowledge of our school. Melody throws a softball through it.
* Is LH a clone? Much discussion ensues. LH: Melody, are you a clone? M: nope.
* Anyone can be deceitful. Nick: I've tried, I'm pretty bad at it.
* Melody says she was told to befriend Lance Hopper. Why is she better friends with Emily?
* Nick: why did sports club think Lance be a good friend for you?
* LH: Dallas is probably just busy, being on student council. He probably doesn't like you Nick - uh, he probably doesn't dislike you. He's probably just busy. Nick: my mom's busy, I get that.
* Melody looks weird. How do you know what Dallas thinks?
* Everyone likes Nick. Except people at a party. But that's really nice of you to say.
* LH: parties can be fun if you get drunk, then they're fun. Nick: nope, got drunk, wasn't fun.
* M: shouldn't be drinking, Fiona said. Bad things happen.
* LH: being a superhero can be bad.
* M: everything in moderation.
* Cut to the Children of the Night's reaction? Absentia's in kitchen, listening in. Grando & Dubium approach with apples. "Is this what it's like to be in school?" Yep.
* Nick mentions to the Children that the party is where Romanus showed up.
* G: "yeah he's weird like that."
* Nick worried that Romanus can track telepathically. G: he can only control minds, not read them

## Hi Mom

* Nick: everyone can relax.
* There's a knock at the door. Oh god.
* Nick answers the door...? Frame to frame scene. Opening door in slow motion. It's Anna Hel with a shotgun. "Where are they?"
* Nick: "hi..?" Melody: "Hi Mrs. Hel!" LH: waves. Anna: glares.
* Anna: aims shotgun at Grando. "Freeze!" Nick: "freezing is what he does it's okay!"
* Nick tries to defuse the situation. Melody: "we watched home alone!"
* Anna: you invited the people who destroyed the PD to my house? Nick: technically I helped destroy the PD and I live here.
* Nick: they're not... culpable for their actions. Mind control!
* Anna: ....
* Melody: they don't wanna do bad things.
* Anna: doesn't excuse them from entering my house.
* Melody: they don't have any place to go.
* Anna: there's orphanages. Nick: they're from the same place Amy & Trish are from. Anna: .....oh.
* Anna: why me? Isn't Melody's caretaker really rich?
* Melody: there's a problem with that cause I might have been designed to be a bad guy, I dunno if it's really safe to bring people where I live.
* Anna looks at LH: You? Maybe? Enh. Melody: don't know who he really is, can't speak for him.
* Anna: we don't have space for this many people. Can't financially support this many.
* Nick is paralyzed with fear & thinking about it.
* Grando: we don't need your help. We don't need housing. We need help taking down Sycamour.
* Nick makes heroic effort to explain the situation thus far.
* Anna: why is Marlone part of this? Melody: we think he might not be a good guy.
* LH: Marlum = Marlone, IT ALL CONNECTS

![](https://i.imgur.com/UaLpJOK.jpg)

* Nick: mom, just for a couple nights can we put them up?
* LH: do we still have Quantum Punch's number? Guy we saved at the museum? Yes.
* Anna: are you sure Marlone is evil? Nope. We don't know
* We're not even sure about ourselves. Except Melody, she's good. LH: I've crushed some cop cars, I'm questionable.
* Anna: "I need booze". Melody: "Fiona told me that's bad". Nick starts sweating. Anna: "she doesn't sound very intelligent." M: "she's a therapist, she's smart!" A: "Just makes my point." M: "she has a college degree."
