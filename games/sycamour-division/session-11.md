# Session 11 (2019-07-13)
## Secret Robot Base

* Zephyr was trailing the Children, got pulled onto a new lead.
* Kieran, Melody's caretaker, pulls up in an SUV in front of an abandoned apartment complex, seven other people in tow
* Zephyr gets to the roof, heads inside. Everything on 7th floor is ruined or empty.
* Ground floor - footsteps - Kieran! He's knocking on a door, leading downwards to a parking lot. Zephyr can't make out what's being said. The door opens, the gang heads down.
* There's absolutely no signal here - no way to call for help.
* Holy shit there's three giant robots in here. There's no cars in here - half-completed other robots, scrap metal, and more.
* Kieran's group, scientists, other members of the gang, Iron Maiden.
* Scientists: "we're going to activate these, they'll be useful for the attack."
* Zephyr assesses the situation -> 6
* There's some kind of control panel in here, maybe for the robots? Three big red buttons.
* ZEPHYR MOMENT OF TRUTH? Nope, not awesome enough yet. Unlock remaining powers!
* Zephyr will run, phase through control panel, try to fuck up its electronics -> 5

* Z accidentally triggers all three of the buttons. The bots start to light up.
* Robots take off, breaking through the roof. Rubble falls, hitting prototype robots & destroying them. Scientists start to flee the area.
* Kieran: "Megumi! Sakura! Kyoko! noooo."

* Zephyr runs through the streets - gotta stop the robots! Top of a building, jump -> 4. He faceplants.

## Life in Hel

* Anna's making calls, not much else is happening
* LH puts in "Home Alone 2". Absentia, Dubium, Grando are still here, watching the movie.
* Who has the funniest ringtone? LH wins by default.
* Z: "Robots. Museum. Hurry."
* "Mom, can we get a ride?" Anna makes some calls.
* Children can't come, they'd get mind controlled. What's Anna's reaction?
* "enjoy the movies!" "Don't go in my room!"

## At the Museum

* Zephyr arrives first
* Robots arrive at the museum, hover, and... wait?
* Z calls Melody. At the same time, mom & the rest of the group arrive.
* Z: "Melody, bad news, Kieran made these." M: "These are cool!"
* Z: "These things flew off after _someone_ activated them. But Kieran called out names, can't remember." Melody: "All his figurines had names..."
* LH: "I'm kinda on Kieran's side." Z: "WHAT?" LH: "I mean.. Kieran has caused a great divide."

* Melody: "I thought you said there 3, there were 7 of us." Z mentions incomplete robots. "Go try talking to them." Z hasn't tried that.
* Nick: "Z held back because they're strangers, you might be friends."
* Melody notices the giant robots...
* Z: "Why does the robot have a skirt?" Nick: "Yeah. skirts are terrible for flying."
* Melody tries talking to the robots. No response.
* Nick tries to reach out to contact the robots, no roll needed.
* They're not robots. They're more like mech suits with a link to a person.
* Melody: "So they aren't people." Nick: "nope." Melody: "how did they get here?" Zephyr: whistles.
* The robots are impressive. M: "Kieran is good at his job."
* But who hit the button? Zephyr: ".... it was me."
* What's the next move? Try to find an off switch.
* Det. Hel finished making phone calls, wants to know what's going on. We explain.

## Heroes arrive

* Begonias arrives, gets out of a car. Z: "anyone else getting a little-girl-can-murder-anyone vibe?" B: "I'm 22." Melody: "Hello 22, I'm Melody."
* B: "What's going on?" Melody: explains.
* Begonias uses sorcery bullshit to bring the robots down in one move.
* Nick tries to read psychometric impressions from the robots -> 9, marks Insecure to succeed, not sure how to relate to Melody now that he knows how weird Kieran is
* Begonias yeets the robots into space.
* LH pitches Red Vox membership. B isn't on board.
* Z: "Maybe get the police to look out for Kieran." Melody is unsure about this.

## Kieran arrives

* SUV pulls up, Kieran, Iron Maiden, 6 other people get out. "Where are my girls?"
* Z: "Kieran, dude, my man, get another hobby." M: "dude isn't part of your lingo." Z: "I am dude-capable."
* Kieran: "Where are my girls??" Z: "Ask Begonias." B: "Wait. The robots? I flung them into space." Kieran goes back to his car.
* Iron Maiden still here. Z: "Jazz hands over there. You still plan to rob the museum." IM: "was never going to rob it."
* Begonias crumples IM's car's engine block with a gesture. IM: "If you wanna do this, don't."
* Melody: "'if you want to do this, don't?' That makes no sense!" IM: "god are you always this dumb?" to Kieran: "no wonder your metal dolls are vaporized."
* IM walks away. Begonias snaps her in place. IM puts up her fists.
* Nick isn't backing down from this. Nobody talks trash at my friends. LH backing us up too. Z standing by to see what happens.
* IM pulls concrete from below her feet, riding it like a surfboard. Prepares for a punch at Begonias. B makes the punch hit the ground instead. Fight continues.
* Goons getting out of the car - just to watch. Nick yells: "Please get outta the car." He slumps out. Z moves him over toward Hel, who cuffs him.
* Melody on the lookout for anything that disrupts her concentration. There's a spike with concrete accreting around it, a weapon to hurt Begonias. Melody uses sonic powers to shatter it -> 8
* Begonias stops chanting, a TK barrier comes up. IM is pushed downwards. Begonias is towering over IM in a depression in the ground.
* The grunts begin clapping. Wait, she's not on our side. They draw guns & start firing at B.
* Nick: "HEY MOM, are they all under arrest?" Yeah.
* Nick telekinetically lifts the SUV, threatens to crush the goons. -> 12. They surrender.
* Melody to IM: "this is why we don't assess intelligence based on those that are lacking."

## Post-Fight

* Goons are arrested. Iron Maiden's hands are zip-tied. We're waiting for the police.
* Nick checks on Zephyr & Melody
* An Aesop! A comedy aesop too: "don't leave Kevin home alone."
* Cut to Grando & Dubium messing with stuff in Nick's room. They're messing with Nick's trinkets. Dubium finds Nick's diary.
* Cut to Absentia watching Home Alone 3
* Heading back to Nick's house. Nick gets a precognition of danger.
* Z: "want me to run ahead?" Nick: looks at Z. Looks at space. Shakes his head no.
* We get to the house as a group. Absentia is here. The others aren't.
* Nick: "hey.. where's our friends?" A: "probably making out."
* Nick in mortal dread goes to check his room.
* Grando & Dubium are laughing, reading his diary.
* Nick lowers his head. Room starts to shake. "Get out."
* "We can't." the house shakes. "GET OUT OF MY ROOM." They scamper away.
* Nick is gonna shut his door inside.
* Z: "Do you wanna build a snowman?" (knocks)
* Nick's not singing along. Lost cause.
* LH: "you okay in there?" Nick: "s'fine."
* A: "What happened?" Grando & Dubium: "he's a pussy."
* Does LH hear this? Nope.
* Zephyr & Melody talk about it. Nick just needs time.
* LH: "we can still beat em up." Comfort & Support -> 10

# Nick's Fury

## The plan

* Nick opens the door. "We're gonna wipe Romanus off the map."
* Nick to A: "If you have anything Romanus touched or cared about, give it to me."
* Grando & Dubium start whispering. Nick waits. Z: "stop whispering."
* Dubium: sighs. "he has something from me. Can track him using that." Z: "What?" D: "put a small metal piece in his suit."
* D: "I can lead you to it, but I'd be vulnerable."
* Nick: "I don't need you." Grabs her head, reads her mind -> 9, marks Angry.
* LH tries to talk Absentia into backing down. -> 9
* Zephyr works to keep Grando from tackling Nick -> 4
* Grando hits Nick with ice fists.
* Nick: "the sooner I get Romanus, the sooner you three are free to leave."
* Grando punches Nick in the face. Nick stands up. "You want to punch me again? If not, I'll go get him." Grando punches again.
* Zephyr tries to suplex Grando. -> 10
* Nick: "I don't want to put Dubium in danger. I have to stop Romanus."
* The three Children phase & run away
* Nick starts walking.
* Outside, Absentia & Dubium are hanging out.
* LH to Absentia: "here's my cell #. We'll let you know once we take him down." A nods.

## Confronting Romanus

* We reach a luxurious hotel. Really high up.
* Z: "Given how the museum went, we should call someone powerful." LH: "sounds like a good idea." Melody: "I hope Kevin's not alone in this hotel."
* Nick is following the tracer.
* Z thinks about calling Marlone. We're not sure about that. But we have Quantum Punch's number.
* Z: "what about those 3 from school?" Nick: "they're not part of this."
* We reach the highest floor. We reach the room we think Romanus is in. Knock on the door. No answer.
* Is the door locked? yes. telekinesis. Door busts open.
* We see Romanus in bathrobes watching TV. He immediately jumps as the door breaks open.
* R: "You're not supposed to be here!"
* Nick: "Your friends tell me you're mind controlling them."
* MOMENT OF TRUTH
* Romanus runs for the remote. Nick grabs him.
* Nick forces Romanus to use his mind control against an impenetrable barrier, hoping to burn out R's telepathic power by sheer force.
* Nick wants not only to depower Romanus, but to intimidate and dominate him by making him realize there's a mind he can't take over. In Romanus's mind, he's thinking back to the orphanage fire, feeling helpless. Flashback to a man in a business suit: Marlone. Can't see his face.
* Romanus slumps to the floor.
* LH smacks Romanus at 15% power, he's knocked out.
* Nick: "come on, let's take him back home."
* LH will carry him.

## Back home

* Heading down out of the hotel. Fuckton of people start to run away from a single room - thralls of Romanus, now freed
* We haul Romanus back to the house.
* MH: "we should tell them. We don't want them here." Nick: "They need to know the threat is over."
* LH texts Absentia, "Romanus is out of commission." LH is left on read.
* LH: "we were friends, 2 years ago." Mel: "What happened?" LH: "probably the orphanage burned down." Mel: "I hope we can be friends again." LH: "friends don't get left on read."
* Nick finds the Children, wordlessly presents Romanus.
* Grando blasts R's left leg with ice.
* Absentia runs up to hug Laser Hawk. LH leaves it on read.
* Grando & Dubium look at Romanus with fear. Nick: "His powers are gone." D: "is he dead?" Nick: "No, just depowered." D: "How." Z: "Don't get on this guy's bad side."
* Nick: "you're safe now." D: "Yeah.." Nick waits to see what these two do next.
* Suddenly door busts open, Anna runs in. "I got Quantum Punch's assistance." Looks at Romanus. Oh.
* Anna: "What happened?" Nick: "I took care of it, mom." Looks to Children for explanation. A: "mind controller. He's evil."
* LH: (mimics A): "Gee thanks Nick. What would we have done without you."
* Nick: to Grando & Dubium: "I wanted to be your friend." Goes to his room.
* Mel: "I don't know what you did to upset him, but he's nice, if you did the wrong thing, you should apologize."
* Grando gets up, starts heading to Nick's room.
* Mel to Z: "You know Nick met that guy when he was drunk. I bet he's sorry Nick wasn't drunk this time."
