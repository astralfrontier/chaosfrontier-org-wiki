# Session 12 (2019-07-20)

## What happens with Romanus?

* Romanus is unconscious at the house. What now?
* Grando knocks on Nick's door. Nick: "not right now--" Grando: "I'm sorry." Nick opens door.
* Grando: "sorry for reading your diary. didn't know it was so personal." Nick: "aren't diaries supposed to be personal stuff?"
* Nick: "what are you three gonna do about Romanus?" Grando: "wait for him to wake up?"
* He's probably going to jail, say what you need to say before then. Dubium still scared, Absentia just wants to get it over with.
* Nick: "you and D dating?" G: "Yeah." Nick helps Grando stand. Feels an icy aura.
* Nick: "do what you can to help them have a better life." Grando nods.

## Amnesia?

* Romanus starts to wake up.
* Nick has something to say, but wants to see what the Children do. Grando runs over to R, ready to throw a punch.
* Romanus looks v. confused. "What are you doing? Who are you people?"
* Melody: "I'm Melody and you're getting arrested!"
* Does Romanus actually remember what happened? LH isn't buying it.
* LH: "can you believe this guy?" Nick: "maybe."
* Can Anna take statements from the Children of the Night? yeah. nick wants to talk to his team.
* Do we want to leave Romanus here alone? LH: can Melody create light shackles? Yes.
* Romanus doesn't seem to recognize his own alias of "Romanus". His name is Caesar?
* LH: is he telling the truth? -> 8. Yes. He's scared, but "what is going on" scared. Like a feral cat you brought home.

## Nick's room

* Nick: "I got upset because they laughed at my diary. I'm sorry."
* Nick presents his diary to the other three: "I need to know you won't laugh."
* Melody: "this is the Book of Nick!"
* LH: "I don't need to read your diary to know you're a good person." Nick: "I can accept us keeping secrets."
* Melody: "What I think about when I'm singing. I don't know about love, but I know what it feels like to sing. Love feels like singing. I think about singing." Nick: "that is really good."
* Z: "it's private thoughts. it was wrong of them to go and read it. If you've got something going on with you, just talk to us."
* Nick: "if Romanus got his powers like Dubium did, then did Romanus get his powers from someone else? Is that person mind controlling other people?"
* Z: "If the Children got powers from other people, then we should expect others with similar abilities."
* Nick: "The other children are like the Diary of Romanus, we can use that to prove he was controlled."
* Z: "There should be legal systems in place to deal with mind control."
* LH agrees. Melody: "shouldn't we be asking permission to investigate their minds?" Nick, regretful and embarrassed: "Yes we should."
* We should get informed consent from the Children before telepathically scanning.
* Nick: "if Red Vox is in cahoots with Sycamour, should we read Marlone's mind to find out?"
* Melody and Zephyr: "we shouldn't read minds, there's other ways." Z: "let's ask Caesar."

## Telepathic Investigation

* We explain what we're trying to do. Anna's cynical of the plan. Remember when Anna asked Nick to read Grando's mind? Nope.
* Nick: "Romanus, unless you want to go to jail for a million years, let us read your mind." Some discussion about human lifespan.
* We explain to Romanus/Caesar what the deal is.
* Nick uses telepathy with gum. At 10-11, Caesar was taken to orphanage. Gigantic hole between 13-present. In that hole, the colors red and white. Melody OOC: Dammit Canada!
* Nick withdraws & report what he experienced.
* Nick to children: did any power donor have mind control? Dubium does remember. She never saw Romanus in the chairs, the other 3 went through surgery together but not him.
* Absentia: "what if someone else did it to him?" Z: "Then he'll take responsibility."
* Z: "Maybe it's not a memory hole, maybe it's a failsafe." Nick: "if he gets busted, he loses his memories for plausible deniability. If he lost memories of the time he was bad, is he really the person that did bad things?"
* LH: "We learned this lesson from the Kurt Russell/Goldie Hawn movie Overboard."
* Nick: "I just don't want someone punished for something they can't feel accountable for."
* Melody: "if he lacks powers and can't hurt people, is there a point to locking him up?"
* Z: "whether he remembers or not, he still did those things?"
* Melody: "what is the point of punishment if he doesn't learn anything? he doesn't know."
* LH: "As superheroes, shouldn't we respect authority." Melody: "that's true, just funny."
* Nick is okay with a fair trial, taking all evidence into account. LH: he can get rehabilitation, rather than locked in the clink.
* We want to find exonerating evidence.
* Nick: that's why we gotta go stop the rest of Sycamour.
* Z: we need to sleep. Grando agrees with Zephyr.
* LH: so Nick, what are the Children gonna do for rest? Nick: LH volunteered to take A. What do the Children want to do? We look over, Grando's already grabbing bedsheets.
* Discussion about whether Nick can take care of himself with the Children in the house. Yes, he'll be okay.
* Romanus wants to be unshackled. LH absorbs the light shackles. R: "Where am I sleeping?" Anna: "on the couch." Z: "I can run him down to the PD." Nick: "it'll be okay."
* LH will have his work phone.

# Going Home

## Melody's Story

* How does Melody get home? Zephyr can run her home.
* Melody opens door, sees Fiona freaking the fuck out: "Kieran's been arrested." Melody: "whaaaaat"
* F: "what will you do?" M: "Don't know if he gave robots to bad people or what."
* F: "I'm fucked. Kieran's gonna kill me." M: why? F: "I'm supposed to keep track of his relations, didn't mention that."
* Fiona's probably going to be financially cut off. Melody could get a job!
* GARAGE SALE.
* Melody built a sand castle! It made money! That'll cover rent for like a month.
* Melody can make other things! When she's not superheroing.
* Melody shuts down to recharge.

## Zephyr's Story

* Where does Z live? With parents, in some apartment building. They had a good enough job to move from Australia, can't be doing too bad.
* Mom: message from Mr. Auster. He has to be "away", to settle something.
* Z is going to take a nap. How much sleep do speedsters need? About as much as normal people.

## Laser Hawk's Story

* Heading home with Absentia. They're going to sneak in. LH: The less mom knows the better.
* Absentia: awkward smile. "Until I find a more permanent place."
* What excuse did LH give mom? He's going to work. 11 is pretty late though, has a text forwarding thing so he can create an alibi.
* Mom's car isn't parked by the house. How active is the neighborhood? Always at least a little foot traffic. How many cars? Inner city, downtime and quiet hours, but always at least somebody.
* Absentia can phase through stuff, easy to sneak into the room.
* LH texts mom: where you at? Mom: coming. LH: I'm in bed, it's pretty late. Don't have to wake me up when you come home.
* 30 seconds after being left on read, thumbs up.
* A: so where am I gonna stay without being spotted? LH: I didn't think ahead. Hide in the closet! Wait. Sleep underneath the bed. LH's room is clean, he's never in here!
* A looks under the bed. Did LH hide _those_ books? Yes, they're in the Batcave.
* A: where are sheets for me to sleep on? LH will go get some.
* Does LH have his mask? He put all his stuff in backpack, including unmasking once inside.
* LH is outside, getting sheets. Keys in lock, front door opening. LH panics, grabs stuff, sprints back toward room.
* Mom calls out, asking questions. LH: everything's fine, no need to come in.

* Alex hid by phasing into the bed. LH: you handled that great! A: thumbs up.

# Museum Attack

## Preparation

* Attack starts at 12! Do we set an alarm?
* "Alexa, remind me to stop the museum attack at 8am."
* Melody has to set a wakeup time before powering down.
* Do we coordinate? Probably not - we're burned up from recent events.
* Melody wakes up first. 4-5 hours. 5am, she's functional. Melody wants to see more stuff, so sleeps as little as possible. Like the little kid who never wants to go to bed.
* Melody: morning routine, pick a template (appearance, clothing), no breakfast. Does she prep for battle in any way? Yes, Frilly Upgrade.

* Melody texts everyone. Will it wake anyone up? Dallas absorbs light from screen, Nick is freaked out & wakes up, Zephyr flicks phone to silent & goes back to sleep.
* Dallas: "it's at noon. We don't need to be there for 7 hours." M: "We should get there first?" D: "we could be fashionably early, show up at 11:30." M: "What if they lied about the time?" D: "If they lied, chances are they're disorganized and not a threat." M: "Or it means they're next level."
* Nick wants to go garage saling. Anyone want to come along? Z can be there in 5 minutes. M: "Can you pick me up?" LH: "are we going in costume?" Nick: "yes"
* Where are we showing up? Nick wants to collect stuff. Zephyr has an old pair of shoes. LH has wheels to first skateboard. Kieran has wooden model of Sakura, a sister.
* Anything from a previous Zephyrus legacy holder? Can scour Auster's house. Old photo?
* "Breaking into Auster's house is hard--" "Phasing." But how do you get Nick in there?
* Has Z been to Auster's house? No? -> 9. He takes a dart to the neck. We walk in, can't see him.
* What does Nick find? Shrine to Zephyrus, clothes that fit, headband, other stuff.
* Try to track Zephyr down inside, going room to room. We find him in security room. He's out cold, snoring.
* Melody: "if he was still tired, he could have said something."
* Nick: "don't worry, I know what to do!" Will go brew coffee.
* Zephyr will wake up faster than normal with regeneration.
* Z: "it's okay to take the stuff, just don't break it." Nick always takes good care.
* Should we have given coffee to a speedster? It'll all work out.

## The Museum

* Nick wants to camp out the museum early. Z: disguises, to blend in with the crowd. LH wears reversible hoodie. Nick is a fashion emergency at the best of times.
* While garage saling, we grab casual clothes for disguise
* Two policemen nearby. One policeman sees Nick, winks. Nick waves back. Melody to Z: "I think that policeman has a crush on Nick." Z: "all cops love him."
* M: "speaking of crushes, how is it going with that lady?" LH: "whuh?" M: "that lady from the bank!" LH: "it's such not a big deal, I don't even know who you're talking about." Z: LH's heart is a fickle thing.
* M: "But you worked hard to get her money back." LH: could have been anybody. Z: trying to play it cool. M: Oh no! It'll be okay if you find someone else.
* Nick: well you did take someone to your house last night. What happened? M: they obviously had a sleepover. LH: yeah just a regular sleepover. And they shouldn't leave through the door.
* Melody: you're bad at hide and seek!
* LH checks phone, had left note with Alex to text when they woke up. A: I don't use doors. LH: we're at the museum if you want to help out. A: "nevermind, was about to say was proud of you."
* Nick gets a message from mom. "Police force backing you up." Nick: thanks mom. Anna: wasn't my decision. Quantum Punch can't show up without risking position in office.
* Nick privately isn't sure how useful cops will be vs. giant robots. Maybe Melody could get a beam cannon for this? Or become one.
* Grando and Dubium and Absentia show up on a really long ice skateboard.
* Nick: hey you three. G: we're not gonna let you beat up Sycamour without our help. Nick: sounds good.
* What's the plan? Z: we'll improvise. D: pff. Z: it stopped you guys at the police station.
* LH: isn't this a powerful-artifacts exhibit? There's a powerful barrier keeping the artifacts safe from intruders. Z: maybe why Sycamour needed someone who could phase.
* Children: are we your only allies? Z: police are here. Children: what are they gonna do, shoot it? Z: don't knock it til you try it.
* Begonias appears. Accompanied by two other people
