<!-- SUBTITLE: Team vs. Museum. Laser Hawk gets a hammer -->

# Session 13 (2019-07-27)

* We met up with the Children of the Night in the museum, around 10am
* Begonias with CuraÃ§ao and Telecoast are here. We lay low rather than talk to them?

## Burgers

* What do we do meanwhile? Burgers! There's a restaurant nearby with outdoor seating. Strawberry steaks? Very red, but not bloody.
* Everyone orders some variety of burger. Melody copies Zephyr's order per usual. LH: pancake stack, strawberry shake. Nick: breakfast burger (bacon + egg on anything = breakfast)

* Z: what are they bringing to the robbery? Nick: maybe they'll reschedule. LH: can we bill Red Vox for our time?
* Nick: remember Iron Maiden said they weren't there to rob it?
* Melody: Nick, order a shake. Nick: neapolitan shake with three flavors. M: You're a genius. N: I'm gonna patent this!

## The Plan
* Discussion of motives for museum robbery. Nick googles Museum website for events. There was an event scheduled for today, but it's been punted for tomorrow. Maybe they were going to plant something in the museum ahead of time?
* Melody doesn't want to be asking all these questions - will tune into the Internet herself! Out of this world -> 6!
  * What's the speed comparison between Zephyr and Melody?
  * The museum is being broken apart? That's Nick's job (rest of the team: "no it's not")
* Around 10:50, some dude are shambling over toward the museum. Police are challenging the guy. Nick gets a to-go box. M: where do you keep that box? Nick: haven't thought that far ahead. M: you've been hanging out with Laser Hawk. N: you are correct
* Nick will casually head toward the situation in progress.

* Dude has a plan, is unleashing powers. Nick tries to feel it -> 10
* He wants to phase the entire museum out of this reality! Nick: "hey guys!"
* Nick: "Sir!" Guy: "..." Nick: "we're not gonna let you phase the museum. According to the plan,... Hey Zephyr!"
* Zephyr rushes in, grabs collar - but he's phasing himself, like Absentia. Z tries again, with his own phasing powers in play -> 2. Z's phasing and his phasing are completely different things.
* Museum stops .. existing? It's phasing out. Nick feels a lot of energy coming from the top of the museum! Nick: "guys I think the plan stopped working!"
* Nick doesn't want to mind control that guy. LH: "mind control that guy!" Melody death glares. Instead, Nick will try to teleport to the top of the museum. -> 6! LH spends 1 team to galvanize Nick into not doing mind control. Nick marks Guilty ("I mind controlled someone last time")

# The Assault
* Inside the museum, cloaked figure screaming at the top of his lungs, has his hands on the ground, museum flickers in and out.
* Phasing dude looks at the museum, looks scared, runs away
* Zephyr uses air powers to sweep the leg -> 5 NOPE
* LH gives chase via skateboard! Uses flash of light to try and stun him -> 11. Dude stops dead in his tracks, swings at the air blinded. LH wants to knock this guy out -> 7, guy gets a disorienting/phasing hit on LH
* Zephyr tries to throw him toward Melody -> 15! Create an opportunity, resist/avoid blows.
* Melody creates light-gauntlets on fists, spikes him into the ground volleyball style.
* Cops are like "whaaaaaat"

* Nick burns -> 8, conjures a Zephyrus construct
* Cloaked figure: "kid, don't try to do this." Familiar voice. He's Mr. Auster.
* Nick: "What are you doing here?" Auster: "it's complicated." Nick: "simplify it." A: "do you know the VIP that works here? Only person that makes it so this museum isn't constantly attacked?" Nick: "uh, no."
* Auster got sidetracked, wanted to get something done, underwent experiments. Can create barriers, making it impossible for people to phase through.
* Nick: "did you get this from Sycamour?" Auster: "What? No." Nick: "other people have been given powers by them."
* Nick tells Auster about the Children. Auster: "why aren't they here?" Nick: "We showed them the Home Alone movies."
* Auster: "If you're Zephyr's friend, I'll trust you." Nick: "What do you need?" (Zephyr OOC: "you can get me a drink.")
* Auster: "Mom told me this place is going to get attacked, protect it. Don't bother trying to protect the artifacts." Nick is okay with that. Check security cameras: any movement or activity? Starts feeling a tingle across back, coming from the door. Some emotional pain, coming closer. Auster creates a barrier over the door.
* Auster: "why fight it when you can avoid it?" Nick: "cause this is all I do." Auster: "you're gonna break the museum." Nick: "we can't let these people do what they want."
* Nick texts his friends: "BRB fighting bad guys in museum."
* Nick is thrown under the metaphorical museum bus by his friends who don't think he should fight alone.

## Robot Stop

* Outside is the technopath who was going to take control of the robots! Robot Stop
* The Zephyrus construct goes into battle!
* What moves would Zephyrus use? Tie them up, push them over.
* Can the technopath take control of the construct? Maybe - they're more like a ferrokinetic. Nick attacks -> 8, resist/avoid blows (Nick retains control of the construct)
* RS takes some punches, dodging others, separate psychic energy clashing against Nick's to take control of it. He gets swords out, gets some cuts in, Nick takes a powerful blow -> 4!
* The construct is blocking for Nick, separating and reassembling
* Nick quickly texts friends with where he is - security booth
* Inside the museum, Zephyr grabs Melody, Laser Hawk grinds up the rails because fuck physics
* Enter battle as a team -> Zephyr is leader
  * Are we prepared? Yes. More than the villains - their robots are in space, you aren't coming back from that.
  * +4 team
* Zephyr grabs the dude's swords, runs them across the museum to put them out of psychic range -> 13
* Robot Stop starts scratching himself aggressively, bleeding himself to gain more iron
* LH: "We just need to get all of his blood away from him." Melody: "people die if you do that!" LH: "90% kidding."
* LH will just run up and punch him. -> 11 (A Fool and his blood are soon parted)

* LH gracefully ducks under a sword swing, delivers a solid hit.
* Melody... thinks this is under control, wants to know what's up. Pierce the Mask -> 5. Can we spend team? LH: "I'll punch your blood out of you." +2 Team -> 7
* What do you intend to do? Wants to murder the VIP. Mr. Auster.
* So this was all an assassination? RS: that was my part in the plan.
* Melody: what's the plan? Sycamour would get me my funds to start testing on people?
* Melody: where's the rest of your friends? (does he have friends?) They're already here.

## Hammer Time and Arcturus
* We pan to: guy with a really big hammer trying to get into the Climate Changer's secured case
* Mr. Auster is starting to struggle.
* Hammer Time is trying to smash a giant fucking hammer into a tiny plastic case, it's not working
* LH wants to disarm him -> 12 ("Everything looks like a nail"), shoulder-checking him while he's trying to make a phone call
* HT tries to grab LH by the neck, LH avoids it
* He huffs like a bull, conjuring an alchemy-style circle and a floating camera. "Alright! If you want to face me, if you want to take my hammer away from me, that's fine! I can take on all of you!"
* Zephyr runs a few laps around the building at super-speed to land a huge punch on him -> 12, resist or avoid blows, grab camera out of the air & smash it
* Meanwhile, Nick and Melody are in the hallway, with Robot Stop. Nick: "We should get this dude down to the police!" Nick will teleport Robot Stop down -> 8
* Back in the hallway, Auster is heading down. Melody follows
* Outside, Begonias is fighting Arcturus. She's shooting bullets out of them. Begonias is chanting.
* Nick asks the cops to get someone inside & turn on all the lights, hands off the bad guy
* Does Nick's mom have group chat access? GOD NO.
  * Telecoast: sound waves
  * Curacao: flames
  * Begonias: gravity
* Melody teams up with Telecoast to take on Arcturus -> 5
* Arcturus laughs, deploys a black hole to start sucking people in. Melody takes a powerful blow -> 5
* The adult heroes fall down. Nick puts up a telekinetic counterforce to let them act -> 7
* LH grabs HT's own hammer and takes a mighty swing! -> 12
  * LH: "I want you to remember it was me that beat you"
* Z: "When you get outta the museum, hand yourself in!" HT: "or what?" Z points at LH. Provoke -> 11
* Hammer Time grabs phone, says something into it, throws his phone near his camera, runs for it - right into the cops though. They cuff him

## It's not over until the CGI lady sings

* Auster points at Arcturus, tries to put her in a force-box, sort of working? Nope.
* Melody does it the Marlone way, punching Arcturus from on light-rollerskates -> 6, Nick uses TK to hold Arcturus in place to take the hit, +1 from team
* Arcturus tries to create a black hole to attack melody -> 7, marks Afraid & Angry
* Nick throws Arcturus at her own black hole! -> 11
* Arcturus will cancel the black hole at the last moment, right in time for Melody to let out an opera wail in conjunction with Telecoast and melt her face off

* Telecoast: "nice." Melody: "Glad you enjoyed the performance!"
* Melody: "Thanks Nick! I thought I was gonna disappear." Nick: "I'm not gonna let anyone hurt my friends."

Laser Hawk, closer to Zephyr (+Superior -Mundane) actually closer to the hammer

# Notes for next time

* Zephyr chews out Nick for using Zephyrus
