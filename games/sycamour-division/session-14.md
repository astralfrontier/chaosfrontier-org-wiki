# Session 14 (2019-08-03)

* Zephyr's player is out IRL

## Post Museum Cleanup

* We whipped everyone's ass, people are being put into police cars, etc. Nobody else has shown up. Weird?
* Where are the Children of the Night? They said they'd help.
* LH will text Absentia - "where'd you all go?" Left on send. Did the team see them? No. M: "I'm not laughing, so it's not a prank."
* LH looks inside the museum for them? Assess -> 13
  * What can we use to find them? Chips of wood. Like if someone punched a tree.
  * A bunch of puppets, broken.
* LH: "did we beat that puppet guy?" Nick: "he took off in a rocket." LH: "looks like he took them." Nick: "he probably doesn't have that many rockets."
* LH checks museum security cameras. 15-20 minutes earlier, Children got swarmed by puppets, someone else showed up - a new person! She breathes a cold aura of ice on them to freeze them. Absentia gets knocked out by some guy. They get taken away in a black van. M: "Vans are bad, I saw this on TV." Nick: "mom says they get free candy." Discussion of expired Halloween candy.
* Is there a license plate on the van? Yes - Nick tells his mom that the kids were abducted.
* Last seen in Ziggy Street. LH: "can you keep up?" Nick, who can teleport: Yeah okay.

## Super Pursuit Mode

* We give chase! Laser Hawk will get there first, Nick will home in on that.
* Zephyr needs to talk to Auster, Auster's got urgent business - so that'll happen
* LH arrives, sees the van roaring outta here. LH wants to take out the tires. There's a green force bubble protecting the vehicle!
* What can LH use to stop the van? Assess -> 9
* LH will bodycheck the van with super-amped physiology -> 10

* Van is totalled. Smoke coming out of the engine. LH finds himself knocking on the barrier around the vehicle.
* There's an old man looking through the window, who ducks.
* Nick & Melody teleport in. Nick sees a drone flying overhead. Nick: "hey guys what's that?" It's a robot! But whose? M: "every other time we've seen robots, it's um, not been the best."
* Nick will bring down the drone with TK. There's a cell phone attached to it. Nick detaches the cell phone, pockets it for a second.
* LH: "do you know the kids are in here?" LH: "not sure, we gotta get this guy out." Nick: "don't you have a hammer for this?"
* LH extracts comically large hammer from backpack. Carnival strength test! ITS HAMMER TIME.

* LH puts the hammer down -> 2  - feedback into Laser Hawk.

## Small Soldiers

* A lot of footsteps! Soldiers marching toward us. M: "is there a parade today?"
* LH: "Nick, what do your elven eyes see? You're the Legolas to my Aragorn!" Who is Melody? Zephyr is all the hobbits.
* Army of lifesized toy soldiers marching at us. Their leader looks at us, back at his army, then turns back, looking like an evil puppet! They charge.
* Melody will shout! -> 7
* LH will try secret spinning hammer move. -> 8
* Nick sees another formation run at us wildly. Nick burns -> 7, marks Insecure
* 2 burn to create a wall formation around us all, blocking off the toy soldiers.
* A few soldiers are left inside, charge LH, take a powerful blow -> 9, hits head, marks Angry
* Nick spends 1 burn on Worship, to get the people inside the van to consider their position
* Drone starts flying away, but Nick still has the phone.

## Glitterfreeze and Lillian

* Nick gestures: "you should open up now.", Provoke (-2 for Guilty) -> 8, LH hefts hammer threateningly, Melody snaps a soldier's weapon. +2 team.
* Arrow guy leaves the van, barrier drops. He looks angry.
* Nick: "hi." Arrow: "what?" Nick: "where are the kids?" Arrow: "the Children?"
* LH is gonna hit him! But he doesn't flinch. What's in the back though? The Children are back there, frozen, with Absentia knocked out.
* LH talks trash. Arrow: "I said their name. They're not kids. They're the Children." M: "Kids and Children are synonyms."
* Nick: "whatever they're called, they don't want to go with you." Arrow: "they would eventually." M: "they didn't now." LH: "how badly do you want this to hurt?" Discussion of whether arrow guy needs to hurt, and who gets to hit him.
* Arrow: "we'll see." Ice girl comes out of the van, starts using her winter breath.
* Nick was standing back, LH and Melody take a powerful blow! LH -> 11 Melody -> 6
* Glitterfreeze (arrow guy) pins LH to the ground.
* Nick wields book of matches like a Yu-Gi-Oh card, unleashing a flamethrower effect that both attacks Lillian (9) and unleashes powers to free LH and/or Children
* Nick takes an arrow -> 12. Can LH try to defend? he has I'll Save You. LH jumps in front of the arrow, obliterating his mask.
* LH: "I'm so glad you picked the way I get to hurt you a lot." To team: "I'm gonna hurt this guy a lot."  MOMENT OF TRUTH.

## Moment of Truth

* LH starts absorbing ALL THE LIGHT. LH is radiant, blindingly so. The rest of the neighborhood is dark.
* Walks up to Glitterfreeze, slams him into the ground. Open palm at Lillian, blasts her with a beam of solid light. Grows to Marlone size (LH is normally short)!
* LH tears down a street light, wraps it physically around the bad guys to restrain them.
* Checks on the Children? They're all unconscious.
* Melody calls 911, reports on situation.
* LH: "what's he acting weird about?" M: points at LH. points at her face. Points at LH. LH touches face. Oh. OMG. M: why are you freaking out? You know what your face looks like. LH puts hood up over head.
* LH: "uhh-" Nick: "Dallas, it's okay." LH now in shock. Nick, hand on shoulder, it's okay.
* Nick: "it's okay, Dallas, I understand why you lied to me, it's fine."
* Dallas on the ground, lay in the fetal position
* Nick is gonna go put a hole in concrete you guys. Melody please help LH recover.
* Melody mimics LH's fetal position. "Don't know how to take care of you, but you were really cool, good job saving kids from poison candy."
* LH is dying (socially). Melody checks pulse. LH: "oh shit the ambulance." Melody: "we'll watch Home Alone!" LH: "Melody, make a mask for me!" Melody will use her powers to make a Phantom of the Opera mask and rose.
* Melody: "we have Home Alone on my phone! We can laugh." LH: "Yes, I love Joe Pesci. Okay. This is helping."

## Post-Battle

* Sirens. LH: "they can take the villains away. We win again." M: "Yeah. we did a great job. You're awesome, you know."
* Police & medics come through the gap Nick made. Villains are nabbed, Children are put in ambulances, doctors check skin & recoil at the cold. Nick wants to ride along. Cop: "you gonna bring your friends?" Nick: "that's a really good question." LH: "I'm going with."
* We're taken to police station. Ambulance peels off. LH: "Wait, thought we were going to the hospital?" Nick: "we have to make a statement." LH: "official hero business." Nick: "no. people need time right now." Nick provokes -> 4
* LH: "you need to let me out officer." Excuses about bathroom breaks. LH leaves. Cop looks at Nick. Nick: "it's fine I know where he lives."
* LH heads to the hospital by chasing the ambulance. Nurse stops him from heading in. LH: "Look, I'm the superhero Laser Hawk, I need to know those people are okay." Nurse: "can you google yourself?" It's not working.
* LH will stand in the waiting area. In 4-5 minutes the Children are in individual rooms. How about Absentia? Room 239. LH will sit with Absentia.

## Police Station

* We pull up along with the prisoner transport van.
* Cops: you recognize those kids from the museum? Nick: looks at Melody. "They were under mind control." Cops: "by who?" Nick: ".. Caesar. Or Romanus?"
* Nick: "We freed them from mind control & brought them in?" Cop: "in here?" Nick: "....temporary lodging." Cop: "why didn't you bring them in here?" Nick (thinking) "to avoid this conversation."
* Melody: "we didn't bring them to police station because they weren't bad guys any more!"
* Cops want to update the Children's status. They have to respond to their potential fines.
* Nick will go along with that. Melody didn't think about that, was more worried about museum being attacked. Sorry!
* How did we find out about the museum attack? M: "we beat up the mind controller." Cops: look at Nick. Nick: "Yeah I kinda did that. Technically I burned out his mind control powers." Cop: "how?" Nick: (puts stuff on desk) "With these."
* Nick gives a very rambling explanation of how to burn out a mind controller.
* Cop: "What the fuck. Where is he?" Nick: "watching Indiana Jones?" Cop: "why isn't he in prison?" Melody/Nick: "he has partial amnesia." Cop: "..."
* Nick gives a rambling explanation of the amnesia situation
* The cop punts. This is too weird.
* What's our relationship to the villains? Nick: "weird people who did bad things to our friends." Melody: "they froze the Children & probably fed them poisoned candy." Cop: "???" Nick shrugs, it's Halcyon City.
* "Nick, you fucked up the road?" Nick killed the road, but LH blacked out the city. Nick is gonna go back to that street & put it all back, it's okay!
* We should go to the hospital.

## The Hospital

* We exchange texts, show up at the room
* LH is waiting. He grabbed a surgical mask, the more coverage the better. Melody looks at him funny.
* Nick: "uh hey." LH: "how did it go?" M: "The police are confused, I tried to make them not confused, I confused them more." Nick: "a lot happened."
* Nick lies, "everything's fine."
* Are the kids gonna be okay?
* Melody: "I found out Caesar has been watching Indiana Jones! When are we gonna watch that?" LH: "you can skip the even numbered ones." Melody wants to watch all of them.
* LH: "how do you feel about watching a bad movie?" Melody: "never seen one." LH: "Then we should totally watch the 4th one!" Melody: "wait, you don't mean the bad guys win, do you?"
* Meanwhile, Nick tries to flag down doctor or nurse. What's their condition? They'll be fine. They're kind of cold, but no lasting injuries or frostbite. The last time Nick came to visit someone, it was his dad, and he didn't come back from that.
* Nick slumps down in a chair, look at his hands for awhile.
* M: "you okay?" Nurse: "they're gonna be fine." M: "why do you look upset?" Nick: "I'm worried." M: "don't you believe her?" Nick: "when you know something, but you have to listen to your feelings, it's hard."
* LH: "I'd feel better if they'd just wake up."
* M: "it'd be hard to think & feel different things. Does that happen a lot?" Nick: "all the time."
* Nick is worried about the cops too, are they going to arrest the Children? M: we're heroes. Nick: so is Marlone, is he dirty?
* Nick: policing is like parenting. Sometimes justice can't be discerned.
* Melody: "Are feelings more correct than thinking?" Nick: "it's complex"
* Involved conversation about music. Melody: there are no bad songs. Friday. Vengabus.
* Nick: "I just want the Children to make it through." Melody: "we're not gonna give up." Nick: "but what are we doing, other than just sitting here waiting?"
* M: "What else can we do except be here, in case they need us?"
* Nick: "LH, do you feel the same way?" LH: "I wish I could take the more proactive action. Best thing I can do is be here. It feels like we haven't quite won." Don't know if we can trust Marlone.
* Nick uses a wedding ring to telepathically share his team's feelings with the children. They feel safer, and Nick shares that feeling back with his team.
* Nick: "I guess you're right. we're not gonna give up on them." M: "Of course. Never give up."

# Cutscene!

* Cut from the hospital to a dump/warehouse. A big empty area filled with dirtpiles, a house-like structure inside.
* The drone from the battle is flying down. Awaiting it is a cloaked figure (Bathsheva) and the Master of Puppets

* MoP throws drone at the wall, destroying it. "God fucking dammit!"
* Bath: "calm down. We'll get them back eventually."
* Grabs phone, reveals stills of the team (prior to unmasking)
* Some mysterious shenanigans targeting the team?
* Cut to another drone flying over the city. Anna's car heading toward the PD with Caesar in the back.
* "We have to wait for the dust to settle."
* "Why are you so infatuated with him, Marlum?" "He's important to me."
