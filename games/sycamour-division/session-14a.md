# Session 14a (2019-08-04)
Melody looks up from her phone and notices Laser Hawk asleep on the chair next to the hospital bed.  She glances over at Nick, who very much still seems awake.  “Hey Nick, when I read the Book of Nick, you wrote that people might be intimidated by me, but I’m friendly and approachable and everyone should know that.  That was… confusing to me.  If you know I’m friendly and think everyone should know that, why would you think they’re intimidated by me?  Did someone tell you they’re scared of me?  Is it because I’m not human?  Are you not scared of me because you’re a superhero?”

*The Book of Nick?* It takes him a moment to connect the dots. "Oh. God, did I make you worry about that? No." He turns in his seat, privately grateful for a distraction. "It's.. it has to do with thoughts and feelings. Imagine.." *Come on, come on, think.* "Imagine a young singer comes to you for advice. She wants a duet with a popular vocalist. She doubts her own singing ability. She fears he'll laugh at her, or mock her, if she asks. She's intimidated. It's not the vocalist's problem. She's afraid of losing the thing she hopes for. What advice would you give her?"

“Hm,” Melody muses, putting a finger to her lips and tapping a couple times pensively. “If she doesn’t try, she never gets the attempt to reach her dream.  And if he is rude enough to laugh or mock, then she doesn’t want him as a duet partner, regardless of his talent, he is not respectful of another artist, which is poor manners and unprofessional.  Particularly if the auditioner is a fan of the artist, he should be showing her kindness even if she is amateur.  If he behaves poorly, that is a poor reflection of him, not her skills.  If no one hears your voice, you cannot gain confidence in it, and you remain shut away, not practicing using your skills.  And that’s not something any singer should do.  Music is meant to be shared with others.

Nick smiles. This is the kind of optimistic answer he was expecting. "But if she tries and fails, maybe the hurt will grow, until she doesn't want to try again. Maybe she's been laughed at before," he suggests. "So, okay. Now imagine you're the vocalist. There's someone who wants to uh... duet with you. Only, maybe it's not singing. Maybe it's something else. You said that when you sing about love, you think about singing. It sounded to me like you love singing, like that's love to you. So.. imagine that feeling, but something else. Like, someone has a crush on you. They want to ask you for a date. But they're afraid. You didn't do anything wrong, but maybe they're scared of failing, you know?"

Melody’s brow furrows.  “But letting fear always determine your actions isn’t good.  Courage is not the absence of fear, it’s doing what needs to be done despite fear, isn’t it?” And then she pauses again.  “And I’m confused by what I’m pretending.  What’s a crush?”

Nick realizes that he's dug a hole that opens up into a yawning underground chasm. Time to fill it up with knowledge. *Too bad I don't really know what I'm talking about.* "I agree. Fear shouldn't determine your actions. But .. sometimes it does anyway," he starts, lamely. "A crush is like... like when you meet someone and you think, I want to be with them, I want to be close to them, like uh.. Like being hungry, but wanting someone's presence and love, instead of wanting food. Like you can't stop thinking about them." He wants to finish with "you know?" because that's the easiest way to admit his own lack of understanding. "It's more than friendship, it's ... a longing."

“Oh, I don’t get hungry for food.  I eat because I want to taste things and because Fiona tells me I should keep a schedule.  But there are things I really really wanted to do, like be a hero!  I thought about that a lot before I met you guys!  Is it like that?”

Nick brightens. "Yes. Yes, like wanting to be a hero. You want it more than anything else." He thinks back to what Melody said earlier. "And whether you're human or not, people might feel that way about you. And so..." He tries to find the strength to say what he really means to say. "I think.. that someone had a crush on you. Erica, the girl at the party. I think.. she was afraid to actually say it, but wanted to be near you anyway. And... I screwed it up for her, and you." He looks back at his hands. "I'm sorry, Melody. What you said about fear is right. And now, I might have made her more afraid to speak up. I'm sorry. And if I screwed up anything for you, ever, I'm sorry for that too."

“But… Nick…” Melody tilts her head slightly to one side, “unless you used her powers on her, you can’t make her be afraid.  The fear comes from her, not you, if it exists.  And that’s assuming she did.  She doesn’t really know me.  I don’t really know her.  I’m not sure why you assume this, but you don’t need to be worried, Nick!  You didn’t screw anything up!” she smiles brightly.

Nick smiles weakly. "I worry because I'm afraid too. And the museum taught me something about that. Sometimes, I can use my fear. Like using my powers to throw someone into a black hole. I'd be afraid of hurting them accidentally. But I was more afraid my friend was going to be hurt." He shrugs a little, uncertain of what he ought to say. "So I'm afraid that I screwed something up. But I'm more afraid of, y'know, sitting and waiting and doing nothing. So when you asked about intimidation, I knew I had to tell you what's going on with me, and why I wrote what I did. I hate being unsure of things. I don't want you to be uncertain either. It sucks, not knowing stuff."

Melody’s face turns serious.  “I can understand being afraid.  I was really scared when I thought I was going to get trapped in that black hole.  You saved me, and I appreciate that, Nick.  And you’re right, sitting and waiting and doing nothing is worse than making a mistake.  And… I just don’t want humans to be afraid of me.  I want humans to see me as friendly, like you do. And yeah… it sucks… not knowing stuff… but… I feel like I’m always learning, and you guys teach me so much!  Even if I don’t know something, I can learn it!  And you can, too!”  She thinks a few moments.  “Hey Nick, do you have a best friend?”

This is a novel question, if Nick's face is any indication. "Best friend? Uh.. I mean, you three, I guess? I mean there's Mr. Black, but he was more like my best friend's dad. But uh.. hm, someone I can talk to? I guess, yeah." He pauses, and glances around. "It hurt that Dallas didn't tell me who he was. But I don't blame him for that." Something else is bothering him, and he blurts it out after a moment. "Melody, I don't care if you are a 'human' or not. You're a person. You're really important to me, just like other people. I'm not scared of you because of what you are. Like, your powers could be really scary if you were evil or something. But you're not! So, don't ever worry about being human or not. And, uh, I guess I keep treating you like a singer first. I guess you're more like a hero first, who started out as a singer. I'll do better about that."

Melody blinks twice then smiles.  "Oh.  Yeah, no, it's okay! I'm not bothered that I'm NOT human, it's just, I read these books and it seems like the characters that aren't human in them are scary, so I thought maybe most humans think non-humans are scary like the vampires and the werewolves.  I know YOU don't think I'm scary, and I'm glad that it doesn't really matter after all!  Maybe it isn't all non-humans, maybe it's just vampires and werewolves they're scared of! And... I'm a singer AND a hero; chronologically I guess I was a singer first, so to say I'm a singer first is probably technically correct!"  Melody beams.  “I had a feeling we were best friends, since I feel like you have started to talk to us a lot more about things that are important to you, and I’m proud to be one of your best friends!  You are one of my best friends, too, Nick!  So now we have to pinky swear something, since that’s what best friends do on TV!”

Nick thinks a moment, putting aside how wary he is of doing anything that looks silly, and extends one pinky finger. Who cares who's watching. "I Nicholai Andreyevich Hel, pinky swear that I will always do what I can to help you smile and be happy, no matter what it takes." He isn't sure how any of this works, but he's confident Melody doesn't either, and maybe that's why he feels so at ease. *She's the person who will never judge me, except by the standards of a hero. And I want to uphold that anyway.*

Melody extends her pinky and hooks it around Nick's pinky very uncharacteristically solemnly and seriously.  "I, Melody Kobayashi, pinky swear that I will always do what I can to help you smile and be happy, no matter what it takes."  And she gives his pinky a slight squeeze with her pinky before she releases it.   Then her face breaks out into a full grin.  "YOU HAVE SUCH A COOL MIDDLE NAME, NICK!  ...and I don't have a middle name.  BUT YOURS IS SO COOL!"   (You can tell it was hard for her to keep composed for that long without saying it)

Nick isn't sure how to react to this at all. His face burns for a moment. "Uh, thanks. It's uh, a patronymic. My dad's name was Andrei Hel. You'd be like, uhh."  How much does she want to think about this? "Melody Kieranovich Kobayashi." Should I ask? Yes. "Um, can.. if it's okay, can I ask you about that? About Kieran?"

> Nick is wrong, it should be Melody Kieranovna Kobayashi

“Of course you can ask, Nick.  Best friends can talk about anything.”  She stops and thinks for a couple minutes.  “I think… I’m confused.  I don’t understand.  If he is a bad guy and makes bad things for bad people, why do I want to be a hero so much?  Was I supposed to be a bad guy?  Was he a good guy who became a bad guy?  Was he tricked?  Or was I supposed to be a good guy that he planned on tricking into doing bad things?  I’m… confused.  And I’m sad if he’s a bad guy.  If I had a choice, I would want my creator to be a good guy…”

Nick waits, and then listens. He knows from confusion, and his eyes pinch in shared worry. "I think we'll find out, if the police question him. Maybe... " *Should I give her false hope? It's at least honest - it could happen.* "Maybe he was mind controlled. Maybe he was tricked. Good people can do bad stuff without meaning to. But... I feel like he loves you." He winces, uncertain of just how pure that emotion really is, but hoping to god that it's okay. "And.. I think whatever he thought you were supposed to be, I think the only person who should get to choose that for you is you. I'm glad you are a hero."

For a moment, Melody is quiet.  “Maybe… maybe you’re right, Nick.  Since I was the first singer, maybe he feels I am his song.  And maybe someday I will know why he did these things.  But…” she looks over at Nick and gives a small smile “I’m glad I’m a hero, too.”
