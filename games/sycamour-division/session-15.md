# Session 15 (2019-08-10)
* Everyone's back together! Start of Season 2.
## When time passes...
* Laser Hawk obligations! -> 8. You did well but you lapse on... Cousin?
  * Did Heather Evans (cousin) meet Alex/Absentia?
  * LH must now convince Heather the house is haunted or something?
* Zephyr legacy! -> 13. One of them offers opportunity, advantage, or advice
  * Auster talking to Z at the museum. "I bet you have questions."
  * Z: "Not really. Just realized something I'd worried about for awhile. Power is addictive."
  * Z: "I can't pass the power on, if I don't believe I can go on without it."
  * Auster had a speech but that's been derailed
  * A: "It's not really like that for me. Do you even like doing this?"
  * Z: "I like helping people. Just worried about depending on the powers too much."
  * A: "Powers can be a chore. People expect something from you. Like getting stuff off the top shelf when you're tall."
  * Z: "I can see why people break under the pressure." A: "And why some people eventually join them..?"
  * Z: "You don't have to worry about me breaking. Just need to develop something that isn't my powers."
  * Z: "I can run fast, don't know how to fight or be effective in combat."
  * Auster is the only mentor figure available. But can he fight? Yes - Auster pins Z down.

## Recovery

* Back at the hospital, Dubium wakes up first, looks at the team. Nick notices, waves.
* LH wakes up when Melody screams, "YAAY You're awake!"
* D: "Where's Zephyr?" M: "He went to do a thing! It wasn't his choice." D: "Oh."
* M: "Really glad you're okay!" D: "Being frozen wasn't too bad. I'm used to Grando."
* M: "How did that even work on him?" D: "Lillian was more powerful. Her ice was more intense." M: "That's pretty scary."
* LH: "So you're saying I'd totally whip Grando in a fight, cause I beat her. Just saying."
* D: "What happened to your mask? She broke it." LH: "New costume." D: "She broke it."
* LH talks about big bearded guy who was also there.
* M: "Grando's more like a freezer, she's more like absolute zero?" D: "Is that her name?" M: "That's what I'll call her." Nick: (thinking) "if anyone's the zero it's Grando." M: (OOC) "is that a freezer burn?"

## The Hospital

* M: "Speak of the devil.." Discussion about the devil, and the saying ("...and he appears"), including summoning speedsters
  * Nick talks about invisible speedsters and power negation.
  * FINALLY Melody responds to Zephyr: "we don't think you're a devil honestly!"
* Z is on his way. Meanwhile there's a knock at the door. It's Lucas from the bunny brigade. Nick: "god dammit we spoke of him!"
* There's a news team outside. LH: "I don't know you." Lucas: "New member?"
* Lucas aka Unreal. M: "You have the heart of a hero!" LH: "Now I know your secret identity. Might want to work on that." Discussion of invisibility.
* LH: "Takes more than that to be a hero."
* Nick: "are the news people here for the blackout?" Lucas: "They're here for the museum." M: "They should be at the museum, this is a hospital." L: "They want to talk to you guys."
* M: "If you guys knew more dance moves, we could put on a performance." Nick: "if I dance they'll arrest me."
* Text Marlone? Yes.
* LH: "We don't trust Marlone." Lucas: "You don't trust your boss?" M: "Isn't this corporate America, I thought everyone didn't trust their boss."
* Nick texts Marlone: "press is at hospital, asking for statement about museum." OH yeah we forgot to tell him. Texts back: "We thwarted museum attack from Sycamour."
* Marlone: "You have to explain once I get there." Nick: "okay he's on his way." LH: "is that good?" Nick: "he always brings food."
* Lucas notices Dubium: "who's that?"

## Zephyr arrives

* Z runs to the hospital. Swarm of news people blocking the entrance.
* Z will call Dallas: does the room have a window? LH opens window, lights up his hand as guide. Z will run up the wall. Can he do it unseen? -> 2
* Most of the journalists recognize Zephyr. Questions! "Sorry, busy on hero stuff!" Journalists start making their way around the hospital.
* Z is inside.
* Lucas & Dubium fangirl at Zephyr showing up dramatically.
* LH & Melody relate what happened to Z. There was a lot of violence, it was _amazing_.
* Plus Melody made a new mask! LH: "otherwise the jig would be up." M: "What's a jig?"
* Oh yeah, we also talked to the police. Z: "and they didn't arrest you? Progress." M: "They were confused by Nick's explanation about Romanus." Z: "He has that effect on people." M: "But I explained it! Can you believe that?" Z: "I am shocked" -_-
* Z: "Yo, Dubium. You feeling all right?" D: "..." Nods. Zephyr wonders if she's concussed.
* M to Dubium: "You were fine before Zephyr came in the window". D covers M's mouth with a hand.
* Lucas: "Do you have a crush on--" Beam of metal covers his mouth. Melody knows what that means!
* Z: "Hero stuff. Get better soon. Children of the Night can do a lot of good in this city. Looking forward to it."

## The Media invades!

* In the background, people screaming, walking. Black Friday crowd noises.
* Z: "one of us should talk to them. P.S. Not it."
* Nick opens the door, peeks outside. A bunch of news people talking to staff, asking to talk to us because free press.
* Nick: "Yep, it's the press. I think we can go out the window." Half of us are on board with this.
* Z: "We're the distraction. If we're seen leaving, the press will follow."
* Dubium could wake them up?
* Nick: "yeah you need to rest hey Zephyr, can you check her temperature? Put your hand on her forehead."  Dubium is sweating.
* Nick is about to go out, but Lucas points out he can invisibly get a nurse.
* Discussion about whether Melody can get a fever.
* Should Melody talk to the reporters? Z: she asks questions..? M: "I should be a reporter! They ask questions, that's what I do!" LH & Z: "That's a good superhero occupation." Discussion about how Many Comic Book Superheroes are Writers.
* Don't we have the right to remain silent? We're not arrested. Nick: "Yet." LH: "The night is young."
* Knock at the door. Two seconds after, door opens, it's a nurse with Lucas. "You were supposed to leave." Nick: "We ended up talking about reporters & handcuffs." M: "But not reporters in handcuffs." Z: "Freedom of speech."
* Nick: "thought about it, I can't leave them behind until they're all okay."
* Nurse: did you bring them here? LH: Yes. Nurse: they're in good hands. Melody: Nick's a big worrier though. He worries about a lot of things. LH: just this week they were attacked 3 times, including by us. Nick: "so I'm right to worry."
* Lucas can call his friends. LH: "We've established I don't trust you."
* Nick: "also Marlone's on the way." LH: "he wants us to explain everything." Nick: "Good point, we should leave."
* Nick to Dubium: "are you okay if we take off on you?" Dubium thumbs up.

## Team Moves

* We can jump out the window easily enough. Head out, see if we can get away.
* Z offers his place to hang out. We'll head there.
* Nick texts Marlone that we left for "security reasons". Marlone: "uh huh. Please tell me no one saw you guys." Nick: "I'm gonna tell him no one saw us."
* Z offers food. French toast.
* Nick: "is it okay that I messed up the street?" Z: "happens all the time." M: "that's what detours are for." Nick: "but people are scared when the unknown happens?" Z: "Those people live in a city of supers." (Nick's team move)
* Nick now imagines how his teammates would tear a street up.
* LH unmasks back at the place. Zephyr fakes surprise. LH: (bow)
* Z: "remember when I said I'd take care of Dallas being missing?" Nick: "You lied, you didn't have to take care of anything!"
* LH doing superhero stuff to make his dad proud. Mom doesn't know. Z: "Trying to live up to someone who's no longer here. I know that feeling. You're doing good. Keep it up." LH: "You're doing good, for the record. You're everybody's hero."
* Nick: "I conjured Zephyrus to be proud of you." Z: "you can make a mannequin but it's not her. Honestly prefer you didn't try." Nick: "her feelings are still alive. For me, it's like a ghost." Z: Prefer you don't do that. Nick: "I'm sorry."
* Z is still trying to make sense of the fact that she's truly gone. I have to take this up for real. It's not some weird dream to wake up from, I've been entrusted with this. The dead stay dead. Nick: Yep.
* LH: "I do what I do to keep my dad's memory alive. Working to keep her memory alive, you know?"
* Z: "I get what you're saying. Dallas you were meant to be what you are. I'm just convenient." Nick: "You're a hero cause you stepped up and did it anyway."
* Melody: "You're a hero whether you have powers or not"
* LH: "I can't imagine anyone in the world who'd be doing better than you."
* Melody: "You're not a hero just because some guy said you were one."
* LH: "Just like who I am is a person hiding another person under his bed." Phrasing!
* Z: "The phrase is, in the closet, not under the bed." M: "I meant to ask about the closet thing. What does 'coming out of the closet?'"
* Nick: "the closet is where you put things you don't want to think about." M: "thought that was the attic." LH: "under the bed is a crime of convenience. Attic is stuff you don't care about." - Discussion about closets.
* Nick: Doesn't Alex deserve to stand out & live openly? Z: Can Red Vox fund housing for them?
* Nick can win the lottery, it would be cheating though. Oooh sports betting. Nick really wants to help the Children.
* LH: start our own superhero company & replace Red Vox. Hire Children of the Night & the Bunny Brigade! But we'd need money to get started.
* Meanwhile Marlone is busy dealing with our PR nightmare. And now there's a Captain Gucci in canon.
* Discussions of fashion, income, and other issues.

## Fate of the Children

* No message from Marlone, but Nick gets a message from Anna Hel. "do you know any family members of the Freeloaders." Nick: "nope." Anna: "Can you get them?" Nick: "uhhhhhh."
* Nick to LH: "Did you get the number of the person under your bed?" LH: "they were in a coma." Texts Alex: "You up yet?" After a minute: "No. This is Lucy."
* Nick snapshots his conversation & sends to Alex/Lucy. Lucy: "why do they want to know?" Nick: "She's a cop & that's what they do." Lucy: "still." Nick: "I don't know it's probably routine." Lucy: "does your mom always ask strangers for their family?" Nick: "probably only ex-supervillains."
* What about actual villains? Nick: probably, but usually they get arrested & she can ask them herself.
* Discussion of whether family cares about someone in prison. Nick: we are not sending the Children to prison to solve their housing problem.
* Nick proposes mad plan to start a superhero company by robbing a bank. Don't do this. Are we paying tribute to our beginnings?
* We could take over Red Vox. And rename it Blue Vox. Blue Xov? Would anyone suspect?
* Anna needs a way to get them into the school system. Nick: can't they just transfer in like normal people? Melody: Fiona signed off on my papers!
* Z: are we on good terms with Begonias? How would she feel about a team of sidekicks?
* Nick texts mom: "ask Quantum Punch." She already asked a favor of him. Nick: "We had good working relationship with Begonias, how about her?" Anna: "she's not the most team oriented person." But we get her number.
* Nick calls her on speakerphone. B: "what?" Nick: "Hiii remember the black holes at the museum?"
* A lot happened. "It's us. Remember?"
* Nick: "how would you like to adopt four kids?" Z: "They're super-teens and can be sidekicks." M: "and Nick is having trouble with numbers."
* We discuss the children in mixed terms.
* B: "is this a prank?" M: "is it..?"
* Nick: "we just need someone to sign paperwork to get them into school." B: "parents?" Nick: "Orphans"
* B: "why going to school?" M: gives the sales pitch for going to school.
* B: "Fine. But I won't associate with them." M: "that's fine." Nick: "we still need a place to stay."
* Will Begonias pay their expenses? Fuck no. Nick: We'll have the police get in contact with you. B: You mean your mom? N: She's part of the police so technically yes.
* Begonias hangs up on us. Nick is surprised it took that long.
* Nick tells mom it's taken care of. Anna is surprised Begonias said yes.

## Red Vox Junior Team

* Z: can they get on as Red Vox members? Stay at Red Vox HQ? Team: yes.
* Nick texts Marlone! "we want to talk about three potential Red Vox recruits." Less yelling that way. No response for 5 minutes.
* What if being good made the Children weaker? Nick has played video games. Discussion about evil & collateral damage.
* Marlone finally gets back to us. Who? The Children. Why? They're powerful, they want to turn over a new leaf, potential for good.
* Marlone: why Red Vox? We're almost always full.
  * Z: got a competitor you'd recommend? We probably did research on possible teams.
  * Nick: can we branch out & do other kinds of work? Z: Search & rescue operations?
* Marlone: They're in the hospital. They should be okay soon though, and testable. Nick: sounds good boss.
* LH: marlone looks up to me! Mary: (OOC) how tall were you before you became a man? LH was 5'3" or so. Now probably 5'10".
  * Nobody at school is gonna buy that as a growth spurt
  * Went to doctor, get bulk-up hormones?
  * Can you grow a beard by tomorrow? Shave his head, glue it to his face.
  * Dallas can get the Beacon drives for new costume & name
  * New name? Masculator? Paul Booyah? Second coming of Hammer Time? Hammerin' Hank.
* We share one beard as a team - the Holy Chinity. (credits: LH)
