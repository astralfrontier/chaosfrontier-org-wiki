# Session 16 (2019-08-17)
* Laser Hawk's player is out IRL
* Last time, everyone was just kind of at Lewis's house talking about stuff
* Marlone is a grenade, you throw him into a situation and run away

## Dresses
* LH gets a text, responds, tells us student council is nagging at him! Oh btw there's Prom.
  * Melody knows what prom is! It's a fancy dance.
  * Discussion of raiding other schools
* Melody could make herself look like she has a dress, but might want a real dress
* Zephyr thinks Melody, Dubium, Emily, etc. should have a girls day out
* M: Want to come with us, Z? Z: My shoulders are too broad to work with a dress. M: We can get something off the shoulder. Z: Help a brother out. M: Come with us. N: I have things to do. Z: like what? N: I'll let you know.
* Z: I'd prefer a suit. M: We can find you something regardless. M: I could wear a suit too! N: Whatever you both pick will be unique, you'll look great
* M: Who knows more about fashion? N: We should ask.
* Nick tries to cheat his way out of the conversation by getting the school paperwork done for the Children.

## Vacation and Cooking
* Marlone texts Z: Turn on the TV. On the news, a journalist is ranting. The Children are being made out to be villains (but they kind of are)
* Z: thought heroics would be more punching and less thinking. M: but you're good at thinking stuff out. Z: just a convenient coincidence. M: TV says there's no such thing as coincidence. Z: In real life there's always coincidence.
* Nick: Never attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity. The difference between malice & stupidity is predictability.
  * Possibility of a villain with super-stupidity
* Marlone: we get a week off, paid. Nick: just means there's gonna be another bank robbery.
* Z: we should do another beach day! Melody, can you go in the water? M: Yep! Z: We can surf! Being wiped out is rough, because you need to breathe. Melody doesn't have that problem.
* Nick: dance at the beach. Team: we don't really do that. Discussion of bonfires and Nick dancing. M: I can teach you to dance! Nick: ...Okay.
* Nick: I can use TK with some shoes to dance! It's a good idea! Narrator: it was not a good idea.
* Melody has never been to the mall! Nick: let's bring Children of the Night. Melody: We can go to the food court! That's your favorite place right? Z: Actually the arcade. I can win tickets. M: I wanna win tickets too!
* Nick: the mall will be attacked. BUT we can get the Children some superhero costumes and positive coverage!
* Z: let's get some food and talk to the Children. French toast!
* Discussion of cuisine. Combination of Iron Chef and Survivor.
* M: Do you enter cooking contests? Z: I could do eating contests. My metabolism is amazing. M: Hot dog eating?
* M: Hot dogs aren't real dogs. Did you ever have dogs? Z: Apartment doesn't allow dogs as pets. M: Would you like one? Z: Laborador. M: Labs are cute and friendly! Z: how about you? If you say you're a cat person, you're off the team. N: Nevermind then. Z: Joking. N: Never had a cat
* M: Would you get a cat? Nick: it'd be a lot of responsibility.
* Z: How about you? M: Birds! They could sing with me! and you could teach them tricks!

## The Mall
* Nick texting in the background. There's a school event, there's shopping for it, we want to know if they can come along with us for it. Dubium texts grammatically correct, Absentia doesn't bother with grammar.
* Discussion of who has pass code to Absentia's phone. Nick trusts the Children. Reply: Lies. Nick: anyway, get out of hospital soon!
* Stardust Mall. Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Malls.
* Nick will wait for the Children, Zephyr can teach Melody the ticket games. Skee-Ball!
* Neither Zephyr nor Melody will cheat. Play the game -> 14 14, both tie!
* Whack-a-Mole! Dallas would be good at it. M: except for that one time he hit a car. That was unfortunate. That was a hiccup. Except nobody hiccuped. Oh dear. Zephyr must now answer questions.
* Back to Nick. The Children approach. Lucy, Alex, heavily cloaked figure, brooding. Nick: Hot Topic is that way.
* Grando: I got banned from the mall. Nick: how'd you get banned? G: complicated. Lucy: He broke the arcade. Nick: what are we gonna do with you. G: I'm better now. This time I'll spare all the machines. Nick: others are at the arcade now, let's go find out.
* On the way, Nick notices the sports club girls. They're eating ice cream on a bench. They see Nick, but don't really react too much. ... Nick keeps walking. Amy sprints at Nick. Amy: next time don't choke my girlfriend. Nick: I'm really sorry, I hope she's okay. Amy: huffs, walks away.
* Zephyr's hitting whack-a-mole weakly.

## Talking to the Children
* Nick: hey, it's... the people we invited here.
* Melody: I'm excited to play skeeball and whackamole!
* Alex & Lucy wave. Grando stares at someone playing the claw machine.
* Melody wonders if Grando's cloak is cosplay. Nick: it's just him. G: what's cosplay? M: where you dress up like a character & post pictures on the Internet. Nick: I got a phone. G: It's fine.. I'm not cosplaying.
* Melody: cool clothing. Dubium: he stole them. Alex: I stole them. Nick: we have money, we can get you some legally purchased clothing. Melody: you shouldn't steal things. Alex: where's the excitement in that? Melody: we're at the mall, that's exciting! Z: Retail therapy.
* Nick: phasing is boring, challenge yourself. Alex: Should I rob a bank? Melody looks alarmed. Z: we'll arrest you next week. Melody: you guys are supposed to be good guys.
* Alex: banks aren't good. Melody: is that why there's always villains in them? A: Probably.
* Nick: it'd be challenging to stop a bank robbery. Alex: you guys want to rob a bank and we'll stop you? Nick: it's just a matter of time in this town.
* Discussion of robbing banks.
* Meanwhile Dubium is playing Dig Dug, Grando has a bunch of coins & is doing the claw machine, constantly failing. There's a lot of psychic energy emanating from this claw machine. A burning building.
* Nick is going to try and subtly help -> 6! Melody is interested in what he's doing. "You know, it's just a matter of physics..." +1 team. Nick marks Afraid
* Grando screams with excitement & happiness. Burning-building feeling turns into a field of roses.
* Grando won a big bear prize & hands it off to Lucy. "You actually got it?" G: "Yeah, because I've been training!"
* Melody looks back & forth between Nick & Grando. Psychic interference? Nick: don't tell anyone. Melody: I won't. Nick: we're moving Grando from malice to stupid.
* Nick: you could take Grando dress shopping too. Melody: he might make his own dress! Nick: he might want some ideas.
* Alex: "I could have gotten that a year ago." Grando: "It wouldn't have been the same!" Dubium looks at Grando.
* People looking at Grando after he screeched. "It's okay, he's very excitable."

## Food Court
* Burger joint, greasier the better, also has BBQ. Flame-grilled burgers.
* Zephyr orders the double-layer Dangerburger.
* Nick: "get me something, I'll be right back." Z: "Melody, how well do you know Nick?" M: "he likes other cultures! We should get him Chinese inspired food!" Chicken, noodles? General Tso's! With extra spice. Waiter brings out milk, winks. Melody winks back, drinks it. -> 7. Waiter: "you're tough." Melody flexes at Zephyr: "I'm tough!"
* Nick returns with drink coasters with bubble tea, orange julius, things for his friends to try.
* Melody: "I got you chinese! The waiter said I'm a brave girl!" Nick: (sweats) "Yeah you are." Melody: "Funny how he knew that." Nick: "You're famous!"

## BURN
* Nick tries the chinese, take a powerful blow -> 12
* Nick's mind tries to save itself, so he shares the load, telepathically broadcasts feeling of super spiciness. The team is safe, the Children are safe, but everyone else...
* People go for milk, drink water, whatever.
* Children: "What did you do this time?" Z: "Someone get Nick a milk drink please."
* Melody retrieves milk (leaving money to pay for it), it helps a little.
* One person runs to the food court - it's Amy. She points at Nick: "You did this! This kid, Nick! He's terrorizing the mall!"
* Nick: "Told you dress shopping was a bad idea." Nick runs for it.
* Melody to Amy: "don't be ridiculous!" Takes off after Nick.
* Dubium stops Zephyr: "What's the deal with that girl?"
* Z: "One time we went to a party, and.. how do I put it? We happened. Nick accidentally caused a problem. Amy doesn't like it, mainly Nick. Okay, entirely Nick."
* Z: "Got a plan beyond 'run from your embarrassment'?" Nick: "no!" M: "Just not into the idea of Nick leaving because of a misunderstanding and Amy yelling and..."
* Z: "Try not to pass out this time."
* Nick: "I'm really sorry about that you guys." Melody: "Sorry I drank your milk." Nick: "did you like the bubble tea?" Melody: "worried about you." Nick: "I shouldn't have done that." Nick should have kept better control of himself.
* Z: learning experience. M: Do you have any food allergies? Z: Peanuts. Nick: spicy is spicy.. I should go mild. I'm grateful you got something I'd like.
* People are body blocking the exit to the mall.
* Nick: "there was a thing that happened, but it's taken care of, because milk."
* People: Fix it!
* Melody: I know you can fix it, Nick!
* Nick Burns -> 10, Overcharge, Worship. Transmit the feeling of Grando's happiness earlier into the entire mall. Shipping bonus! Lucy feels it and recognizes it coming from Grando. They stare at each other. Good vibes.
* Melody: "see Nick, told you you could fix it." Nick: "Yeah.. thank you!"
* Nick: "don't know that I would have tried if you hadn't said something." M: "I have to uphold the promise of the pinkie swear." Z: "What pinkie swear?" M: "Nick and I are best friends, so we pinkie swore!"
* M: We can pinkie swear too, Zephyr! Z: I don't know that we should.
* The crowd will let us out though.
* Alex: "Nick should I arrest you?" Grabs Nick's wrist. "You're under arrest."
* This is the moment Dallas should show up here
