## Student Council
![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hf7kh.png)

* Dallas had to go to student council meeting, an emergency session about Prom.
* Student Council: "who are you?" Dallas: "enough joking, it's me." SC: "You're taller than Dallas." D: "We're all growing kids."

* Prom got thrown off by a schedule that got teleported into space.
* During boring bureaucratic nonsense, Dallas gets a text about what's going on at the mall
  * Is Dallas going to bow out? Depends on how the meeting is going. He'll make excuses about school being out of ice or something.
* Dallas skates to the mall, sneaks in through a side entrance, ditches costume, appears as Dallas.

## At the mall

* Dallas sees Alex holding Nick's wrist. Stares tersely at Nick & Alex, back and forth
* Nick: "I'm glad you're here, they were gonna put handcuffs on me." Alex: "I already did."
* Melody: "Zephyr taught me how to play skee-ball!" Z: "She's good at it. Probably beat you." M: "Lewis is a really good teacher."
* Dallas still hanging back. M: "You okay?" D: "I'm fiiiiine. I'm okay." M: (not sure she buys it)
* Alex: "we were just leaving right?" Nick: "There was an angry crowd, but it's okay now."
* Z: "Should we do what we came to do?" M: "doesn't make sense to leave & come back" N: "That's fair. Dallas, you want to buy a dress with us?"
* D: "Don't know what my new size is." Z: "Good opportunity to find out. Your old dresses won't fit you either" M: "how many dresses do you have?"
* D: "Dress shopping, mob, handholding, am I caught up?" Z: explains Nick's disaster. D: "Gotcha."
* We catch Dallas up on what's going on. M: "Grando won a bear!" D: "I'm ready to hang out!"
* Dallas notices hooded figure walking by. It's Grando. G: throws icicle. "Why are you fucking here?" Z moves to catch the icicle -> 9, LH spends team +1, Zephyr puts team in pool, yaay wash
* LH: "No violence, Grando." G: "How do you know my other name?" LH: "I've been hanging out with these guys?"
* Nick: "Well what is your other name?" ... Jeremy Barker. G: "How did you get so tall?"
* LH: "haha Grando you're the only person who doesn't know who I am."
* G: "You work for Sycamour!" - throws another icicle. LH powers up light energy, catches icicle, crushes it.
* G: "GOD DAMMIT." Z: "You can hear the cogs in his brain working over time." M: "Nick, the malice is leaving quickly." N: "There's gonna be a lot of stupid to fill in the gap."
* G: "I've seen your face, Laser Hawk. I know who you are." LH flexes on Grando. M: "Can your dad beat up his dad?" OUCH.
* G: "I'm the better skater and fighter, and I'm the one with a GIRLFRIEND!" LH: "I saved you and your girlfriend a day ago."
* Boys will be boys. G: "If you're so perfect, why weren't you there sooner?" M: "nobody said they were perfect." Z: "Just better than you."
* There's a snake coiling around Grando's left leg. It's a metal snake. Grando's being dragged to the restroom area. Dubium's taking him to the doghouse.
* LH: "Well that's handled." M: "We sort of invited them." Are we responsible for the Children? Guess so. We'll follow to the bathroom. Dubium is bonking Grando on the head angrily.

## Pre-Prom

* N: "So Zephyr, you might have somebody who wants to ask you to the prom." Z: "Who?" Nick: "Oh just somebody." Z: "Pass, Nick." N: "Not me."
* LH: "So is prom a dating thing?" Z: "If you put in the effort to." M: (stops) "Oh. I forgot about that part." Z: "You alright?" M: "There's a really important question I have about this - when are the auditions! For our parts at the prom!"
* The dance-off! With the song! Z: "High School Musical?" LH: "those are improvised, no assigned roles. Challenge anyone you want to a dance-off."
* Z: "Nick." N: "What." Z: "Explain it." Nick: "I use telepathy to broadcast the song, but I can't tell what it'll be, that's cheating." Nick can't predict the winner, it's based on dancing.
* M: "Back to the original problem. What about this date thing?" LH: "Yeah." Z: "If you want to go with someone romantically, the prom is suited for that." M: "Is that optional or a requirement?" 
* M: "What am I supposed to do?" Z: "good question. Dallas?" LH: "It's dumb. Uh. What do you think, Alex?" Alex shrugs. M: "if you think it's dumb, why are you on the planning committee?" LH: "We plan dumb things." M: "It's a prank."
* Alex: "you're on student council now?" LH: "it kind of was a prank. I got chosen as a write-in candidate." Alex: "nice..?" Thumbs up. LH: "Mom likes that I do it." M: "It'll look good for college." LH: "I'm not gonna live long enough to go to college." Superheroes take risks!
* Discussion of college and survivability. Discussion of Australian Spider-man.
* M: "I don't think Alex ever answered your question." LH: "I'll just do whatever Alex does." Alex: "I guess i'm gonna go? Why not?" M: "I'm gonna go, there's dancing!" Z: "It's a braver man than me that tries to stop Melody from dancing."
* M: "Lewis, you never answered, what should I do?" Z: "Do you have someone in whom you're romantically interested?" M: ??? Z: "Is there someone you want to spend a lot of time with, as more than friends?" M: "You guys are my best friends." Z: pain.
* Nick: "you could go as friends with someone to prom." M: "can you do that?" Nick & Zephyr: "Yes!" Z: "Just do that, and avoid any existential crisis."
* Zephyr doesn't understand romance. Nick has felt it, but that doesn't mean he understands it. M: "That must be hard." Nick: "Yep."
* We should look for clothes. LH: "All these questions got very difficult." M: "It's fine, as long as I have something to wear."

## Apparel

* Melody drags Lucy along. Lucy drags Jeremy along. (Z: "I think you guys mean Gordo")
* Nick: "Get me something that goes with everything." Gets a penguin suit.

* LH and Zephyr are getting a suit.

## Girl talk

* M: "Lucy, who are you going with?" Lucy: "Jeremy. Who else is there?" M: "There's other people in the world!" Melody pierces the mask -> 3! Before that: "Why, who are _you_ going to prom with?" M: "I don't know! I have three best friends!" Lucy: "which one do you wanna go with?" M: "I don't want to be a bad best friend!"
* Lucy scans the room. Whispers. "Laser Hawk's taken." M: "Taken where?" L: "To the prom." M: "He's at the suit shop."
* Lucy: "Alex is obviously gonna go with him." M: "Really? How do you know? Oh did they tell you?" Lucy: "Uhhh."
* M: "Does LH know?" Lucy: "Not really?" M: "But I still have two other best friends!"
* Lucy: "Are you really gonna go with Nick? He's nice, but uh, no." (Nick takes a powerful blow remotely)
* L: "Y'know, he's.. Nick!" M: "Yep, that's his name!"
* L: "You can go with Nick or you can go with Zephyr. Don't you think Z is a bit more cool?" M: "They're both room temperature."
* L: "Fine. Okay." Sits down, clearly in pain. M: "Do you need tylenol? A drink?" (Z: an alcoholic one)
* Lucy walks away. "oh my god." Outside, the boys are waiting. L: "How do you deal with her?" We think the word is "cope".

## Guy talk

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_AgCzt9zcM){.youtube}

* Z: "Anyone you're thinking of asking, Nick?" Nick: "A few people I thought about asking." Z: "I'm sure there's somebody."
* LH: "We're gonna make you famous." Nick: "Did you see Carrie. You should watch that." LH: "Is this the kind of girl you're interested in?"
* Nick: "don't make this about me. Who are you two going to ask?" Nick is super evasive. N: "So who are _you_ guys gonna ask?"
* LH: "Who I'd ask is too cool." Z: "your coolness has gone up." Nick: "You're asking Grando." "we said cool."
* Nick: presses. "Have you asked." Discussion about who's taking who.
* LH: "Haven't asked. Pretty sure Alex is going. I'll be going."
* Nick: "You've always been the guy who charges in, who's fearless. Be that guy now." LH: "I've been good at everything else." Nick: "Not all the time..."
* LH: "I've never done this." Nick: "You can do this." Nick C&S -> 10
* LH: "Well, you've never been wrong." Nick: "I've been wrong a lot. Whether you can do this, you ought to do this."
* Is Alex around? Different clothing store. Dallas hands Nick his suit: "make sure nobody buys this."

## Dallex

* Dallas goes looking. Tap on shoulder, it's Alex. D: "I was just looking for you." A: "Me too."
* D: "How's it going finding clothes for prom?" A: "I just did." D: "Me too. Are you going with anybody?" A: "Uh, no. Are you?" D: "Was just thinking, uh, maybe we could go together?" Alex blushes. "Okay."
* D: "what happens now?" A: "Uh, I'm gonna go .. buy some milk?" D: "You're still.. living in my house." Alex books it.
* Lucy sees Alex run past, shows up, is frustrated & irritated. "How do you deal with her?" pointing back at dress store. D: "I don't know."
* L: "You're on the team, you talk to her all the time. How do you even? She's a child." D: "Technically your supervillain team name was the Children of the Night." Lucy stares.
* D: "She's not that different from us." Lucy: "She's..." D: "How do you put up with Grando? He's got room for improvement, but." L: "I'm trying to fix him, but he's, y'know."
* D: "Have you watched any movies or TV? That's not gonna go how you think it will." L: "That's not why I'm with him. He's cool. He teaches me all sorts of stuff." D: "some small times? Then he's mostly not cool." L: "Who are you to say that?" D: "I'm Dallas. The coolest person on the planet."
* L: "You're not cooler than a lot of people I know. But you're top 10. But you still need improvement." LH: "Nope."
* Dallas can show Lucy his hammer! And he grew 7 inches!
* L: "Pride is a sin." LH: "I don't know about that." L: "It's even one of the main sins in Fullmetal Alchemist!" LH: "Yeah but."
* LH: "If you've got this light, why not show it to the whole world?" L: "But do you?" LH: "Ask every supervillain I've ever taken down."
* Lucy talks to herself. "Hey Dubium." "Yes Dubium?" "Is LH cool?" "No." "He said to ask someone he's beaten about that."
* LH: "Rock paper scissors. You beat me but I beat the 2 people that beat you." L: "And Grando can beat all of these people." LH: "I'll believe it when I see it."
* LH: "don't put all your eggs into the Grando basket. I've known him longer than you." L: "Have you?" LH: "We used to skate together." L: "He and I shared an orphanage together." LH: "Technically true. But I've known him long enough to know he's not as great as he thinks he is."
* Lucy boops Dallas on the nose & walks away.

## Nick & Zephyr

* Nick: "So now we know who Dallas is taking. What about you?" Back and forth on whether Z is taking anyone.
* Nick: "So you're in the same boat as me." Zephyr takes a powerful blow.
* Nick: "You're a cool guy. Anyone would go with you. Haven't spent time talking to anyone. Track team? You guys?" Nick: "Have you asked Melody or anyone you know?" Z: "She sees me as a brother." Nick: "You can go like that."
* Z: "Let's just get a suit."
* We hear footsteps. It's not a hooded figure. It's Grando.
* G: "Who are YOU going to prom with?" Nick: "People." G: "What people?" Nick: "Same answer as Zephyr." G: "I wasn't listening."
* G: "But you're not going with anyone romantically?" Nick: explains powers. G: "That's dumb." Nick: "if Romanus commanded you to have a crush on someone, what would you do?" G: "You should still try."
* Nick: "Why do YOU want to know?" G: "I can't stand by and let you not go to anyone with prom?" Nick: "That's my JOB is to be the guy who doesn't go with anyone."
* G: "if you're not going to better yourself, I'm going to better you." Nick: "who should I go with?" G: "Uh, somebody." Nick: "So we have the same list of people."
* G: "How about Zephyr?" Nick: "He's cool but I'm not attracted to him." Z: "Oh thank god."
* G: "Okay. Do you like ... a teacher?" Nick: "god no. You're dancing and she asks you about homework."
* Nick explains the pros and cons of Emily, Melody, and the Bunny Brigade.
* G: "You have two choices." Nick: "I have five choices." G: "Go ask someone. Or I will beat you up." Nick: "I don't think I'll be beat up by anyone named Jeremy, but okay." Z: "Romanus had you on a leash, and this guy smacked him down."
* G: "Romanus had it coming. Nick, you have it coming too." Nick: "you're not helping." G: "What's your take?" Z: "Skullgirl or Emily." Grando looks at Nick.
* Nick will think about it. Nick: "You gonna beat up Zephyr?" G: "Yes." Z: "I don't take that seriously."
* Nick: "how did prom become about who can beat who up?" Z: "started when Grando was trying to mask his insecurities." Grando is about to explode.
* Nick: "G, you have a nice girl. You like her, she likes you, it'll work out." Grando stalks off.
* Z: "Heard of the theory of desperation date? Around Valentine's Day, people are desperate not to be alone. They're more likely to accept someone asking them out. You could leave it til the day before prom." Nick explains his theory of Eager/Average/Meh/Desperate/Insane.
* Nick: "going to prom is a risk. The mall incident could happen again. I have to keep people safe, including keeping them safe from me." Z: "I could bring a sedative & knock you out." Nick: "The fact that you have this plan proves my point." Z: "I think fast." Nick: "But you can't tell me who you're taking to prom."

## Melody & Laser Hawk

* Melody looks worried & upset. "Dallas I've got a problem. I have 3 best friends." Dallas: "am I one of them?" M: "You and Lewis and Nick!"
* M: "Well you're not a problem, you're actually helping me! Lucy said you're already going to prom with someone! Now I don't have to worry about not asking you to prom!" LH: "I literally just asked Alex." M: "She told me Alex already knew."
* M: "You can't invite two people! I don't want to be a bad best friend!" LH: "You're thinking about inviting friends?" M: "Yeah!" LH: "Go for it!" M: "No! I can't pick!"
* LH: "ask them both!" M: "I can do that?" LH: "You can do whatever you want." M: "Aren't there rules?" LH: "Don't spike the punch, and don't dance too close." Melody has seen volleyball, misunderstands "spike".
* M: "I should ask both of them?" LH: "If that's what you want to do, then yes. Do you want to go with both of them?" M: "I just want to have fun with my friends and dance. I'm confused."
* LH: "What did Zephyr say that confused you?" M: "What is this more-than-friends business?" LH: "It's friends, but... more."
* M: "Friends > Acquaintances > Strangers > Enemies." LH: "There's a couple steps before enemies."
* LH: "More than friends, uh, there's several grades above 'friends'. I don't know, a lot maybe?"
* M: "I'm still not sure what I should do." LH: "You know what you want to do. As long as what you want to do isn't hurting anybody, you can always do what you want." M: "How do I know if it's hurting anybody?" LH: "That's a super good question. Just gotta feel it. You have to be able to empathize with other people."
* M: "I don't have empathy powers." LH: "I think you do." M: "I've never tried!" LH: "Remember you & Nick finding out I was Laser Hawk? You empathized with me."
* M: "I didn't notice until Nick told me." LH: "You did a lot of crazy stuff!" M: "I've learned something else too!"
* LH: "Have you figured out what what you're gonna do?" M: "I have NO IDEA, but I think it's gonna work out!" LH: "Do what you think is right."

## The team together

* Dallas goes back to the suit store. Melody follows. Small talk about sports. "Why do you call it football? Because we're crazy."
* Nick: "Did you make a touchdown?" M: "how do you make a touchdown in the mall?" N: "It's a euphemism."
* Dallas did it!
* Nick: "we talked to Grando about who's asking who to prom." Z: "LH is showing Dubium his hammer." M: "LH has a pretty awesome hammer!"
* Melody: "Dallas, I think I figured it out." LH: "I knew you could do it" M: "Thanks!" Nick: "What did you figure out?" M: "How to not be a best friend!" Z: "Oh?" M: "In the end, it will all work out." Nick: "You can't be a bad best friend." Z: "You're not capable of being a bad best friend."
* M: "I don't want to be a bad best friend." Nick: "if that was to happen, I promise we'd tell you."
* Z: "if you ever seem like a bad best friend, we'll assume someone kidnapped you."
* M: "What if I got reprogrammed?" Z: "This figure of speech is getting off the rails."
* Nick: "Why were you worried about being a bad best friend." M: "I have 3 best friends, and I didn't like the idea of having to do anything like I was picking one friend over the other." Nick: "talking about prom, or something else?"
* Nick: "If you picked one of us, the others wouldn't think you were being a bad best friend." M: "Really?"
* Z: "Besides, Nick has 2 choices--" Nick: "5" Is there gonna be a dance number?
* Nick: "I don't even know how to dance" M: "I can teach you! It'll be easy!" Nick: "one of the two things you said is correct."
* Nick: "Melody, whatever you do is fine. And (to Dallas & Zephyr) whatever I do is fine, right guys?"
* Z: "Serious question. Would Blue work for me?" Nick: "Sure." Z: "I want to wear different colors."
* Melody: "what about the dance number?" Nick: "No dance number. I'm just gonna ask someone."
* Z finds Dallas. "how does prom king/queen work?"
* Discussion of social popularity. Melody thinks it's stupid to consider it as a factor who goes to dance. M: "ask the person who doesn't think like that." Nick: "Fine. Melody, do you want to go to the dance?" M: "What?"
* M: "I was gonna ask you!" Nick: "What?"
* Discussion about Nick worrying. Nick: "Promise me that you won't do anything just because you think you're supposed to."
* Nick always wants to be Melody's friend. Melody does too! Melody's being a good friend!
* Melody will teach Nick to dance!

## Begonias as guardian

* We text Begonias before going over to her place!
* She texts back: "About 'signing the papers'. Not sure if I want to just sign it. Some responsibility. Going to have to ask you (Nick) a favor. Let me talk to Anna Hel about rehab." Nick: "What about rehab?" B: "Give me another chance." Nick relays to mom via text: "Begonias wanted to talk to you about rehab & she wants another chance." A: "Not this again. Why is she asking you?" Nick: "COTN adoption." Anna: "I'll think about it." Nick texts Begonias: "She'll think about it." Begonias: thumbsup?
* B's house is cheap, run-down, in need of repairs.
* Nick hands over papers. Nick: "I hope everything's okay?" B: "What do you mean?" Nick: "rehab, another chance, this place?"
* B: "it's fine." N: "Is it actually fine?" House reeks of bad decisions.
* Nick: "We came to you because we trust & respect you. We'll make sure helping these kids out isn't something you regret."
* Nick: "we trust you because we fought with you. Well not had a fight with you. But you know."
* LH: "Should we not trust you?" B: "More surprised that you trust me. Didn't Det. Hel say anything about me?" M: "No" LH: "Maybe?" Begonias: "Maybe that's for the best."
* Nick: "all we know is 2 times out of 2, when we needed something, you showed up and did it." B: "things aren't as simple as that." M: "Except when they are!"
* B: "Not doing this willingly. This is really long rehab." Nick: "Is it gonna help you?" B: "Govt wants me to leave, but I'm not leaving." Nick: "I'm glad you're not leaving."
* B: "anything else?" Nick: "we're having prom next week." Z: "She doesn't care." Nick: "That you signed this stuff lets the Children go to that. Thank you for making that possible."
* Nick whispers to Begonias: "I feel every emotion in this house. It's okay. I'll come back sometime & talk about it if you want."
* B: "It's fine." Nick: "Okay. See you later!"
* LH: (OOC?) "She was exactly what I expected!"
* B waves once, goes back to her house.
