## The conversation!

* Nick is gonna track down Zephyr. Z: Whole team? N: Nope.
* Nick: you said Melody sees you as a brother. How do you want to see you?
* Z: That's not really important. We have to deal with Sycamour
* N: If you don't resolve this, Melody's gonna pick up on it. She'll blame herself & be hurt.
* Z: You can be a bit of a bastard. N: I'm being her best friend right now
* Z: You've read a book, teens overthink everything. N: Don't think that's happening here.
* Z: I have all the time in the world to overthink things! It's my power.
* Z: I read a bit too much into some of the interactions between Melody & I. Something that shouldn't be allowed to go on. Best to put it away.
* N: You suggested Emily & Marie, but not Melody.
* Z: Romance within a superteam tend to get nasty. I've got a lot on my plate. You're doing me a favor.
* N: What favor am I doing you? Z: Going with Melody. N: We're going as friends. You've still got this feeling.
* N: Just promise me to have one honest conversation with her about how you feel
* Z: No. N: so who's running from their embarrassment now?
* Z: Running is my superpower. Also I didn't terrorize a food court.
* N: I made it right. You have a chance to make things right too.
* Z: Please butt out.
* N: I'm your friend too. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
* Meanwhile, Dallas was group-texting everyone for pizza!
* Nick goes off to think about what to tell Melody, Zephyr joins Dallas for pizza

## Pizza and patrol

* Dallas: Just hungry! Need good root beer, pizza secondary
* Z: So it's like a day drinking thing. 10am root beer jitters?
* D: This is normal! Z: I hang out with you more than anyone else on the team. Root beer is not your normal.
* D: What if it is _now_?
* Z: What's gotten into you?
* D: Nothing! Z: Prom Jitters. You're afraid of wrecking everything. D: I thought Nick was the mind reader.
* D: My deal is double identity, hiding my feelings all the time. Is that not how the group knows me?
* Z: I've got nervous energy too. Let's go on patrol!
* D: I don't think I even eat. It's just neon!
* Dallas: I am what you see (Mundane label, this is a normal-person problem)
* When time passes... Zephyr -> 9, +1 team from Melody, who shows up to assist with training
  * Develops "blades from thin air" ability
  * Due to talking to Nick, Zephyr is a little less conversational, but could be passed off as training-focused
  * M: Was it really hard to learn that? Z: Learn how to make blades of thin air?
  * Z: Once you ignore physics, it's not hard, that initial hurdle of abiding by physical law is tough
  * M: I'm not surprised, you're so good at everything! You're so focused, I thought it was difficult
  * Z: These things require concentration. Ever done the thing where you pat your head and rub your tummy? M: kinda yeah
  * Z: It's like a more advanced version of that. Lucky I can think as fast as I do
  * M: It's like doing martial arts, right? Z: I guess. M: it'll be easy for you! Today was just the hardest day!
  * Z: Thanks for being around to help. M: Always happy to help, you're my best friend
  * Zephyr takes a powerful blow -> 6! Stand strong

* When time passes... Laser Hawk -> 14! Aced every quiz at school
  * Does grandmother know Dallas is going to prom? She specifically does
  * At the DoD lab, Dallas messes around with amplified light energy as concussive force to get Physics What Physics as a move

## Caesar!

* Event starts at 8pm. It's noon. Nick gets a message from mom. Caesar got away, but didn't break out
* Nick: Good luck recapturing him? Anna: I need help getting him back. Nick: should I tell the team?
* Nick relays to the team. Some guy called Craig says he's Caesar's father & paid his bail.
* Nick: yeah but he was in an orphanage. Anna: dunno
* Dallas: really, on prom? Melody: we have to find him! We're heroes!
* Nick: does Craig have any contact information? Anna: Yeah, here you go - sends picture. It's Marlum (but we don't know that)
* Craig Lilac, son is Caesar Lilac
* If we got an address, we'll go check it out. Dallas texts Alex with picture. Zephyr: let COTN know we're saving the world
* Alex: that's the guy that burned down the orphanage and kidnapped me!
* We're at a gated mansion, cameras everywhere. Should we do recon? Z does a lap around the place to assess the situation -> 8
* What here can we use to get in without being noticed? -> Use LH to cause a local blackout to get in unnoticed
* Melody & Dallas work out who needs to put D's clothes on for him, including mask. Discussion of holographic clothing that could collapse at any moment, revealing his hammer
* LH sucks! -> 4
* All light is absorbed in the mansion, blackout achieved. We start hearing footsteps. Craig/Marlum in bunny slippers & t-shirt is inside the mansion. Team wants Melody to go talk to him
* Melody will approach, not from the same direction the team is in. Hit the buzzer! Meanwhile Nick will try and teleport Laser Hawk and himself inside
* M: Hello? Did the power go out for you guys too? Craig: yeah. it fuckin woke me up. M: that's terrible! How did it wake you up? Craig: I have a nightlight. M: So? Craig: Can't sleep without it.
* Discussion of nightlights, being afraid of the dark. Melody was never really a child.
* What company did Dallas's grandmother get him involved in? Cyberprism. Craig could invest in that to develop a custom nightlight Melody suggested.
* Craig: why did blackout happen? M: Dunno, but glad I could help you!
* M: If we're neighbors, we should get to know each other better! Craig: I have taxes to pay. M: I thought you were sleeping!
* Craig: how old are you? M: depends on who you ask. Craig: call your parents? M: They won't care very much.
* How does Nick's power work? To whatever room is closely associated with Caesar. Nick & Dallas appear.
* Room decorated for a young boy.
* Nick uses ESP to detect Caesar. No presence. He's either not here, or shielded.
* Cameras in hallways - pretty bad chokepoints for us. Nick: (gestures). Dallas: Fuck it, let's be seen. Nick: can we show some discretion. Dallas: DOES NOT COMPUTE
* Nick: maybe there's some kind of secret room underground. Can you feel it? LH: There's a room underground! Nick uses teleportation to bring them down there
* Room is full of junk. Dusty basement, lots of random lived-in house boxes. Checking the rest of the level. Assess -> 9
* What here can I use to lead us to Caesar? -> Box is marked "Memories". Flaming hot. Framed photo of Master of Puppets. Craig trusts this man as a best friend, would probably hide something important with him. Nick & Dallas take photos of the box, take the photo, teleport back outside

## Craigslist

* Z: You got a souvenier. Nick: this is a bad guy. Nick explains the MOP connection.
* Z: Cops can return & execute a search warrant. M: That'll take too long! D: Didn't he say he was going to sleep? M: He's doing taxes.
* Nick calls mom, asks about evidence. Does Anna have a case? We'd need more, but this is a good start.
* Time check -> 2pm. We can still make it!
* Zephyr can look up abandoned warehouses in the district. Could also check city records.
* Melody will plug into Internet! -> 3  Oh god.
  * First presence of Craig Lilac online is in his 30s. False identity.
  * Screensaver face while plugged in
* LH will check out all the warehouses along the docks! -> 4 Gets some vague general idea of area. Meanwhile, a guard notices LH & points a flashlight at him. LH distracts him & makes a getaway!
* Zephyr checks city records -> 7, but is frustrated with what's going on! Found an abandoned factory. check this out, Dallas.

* Looks like the place. Dallas will try to sneak in! Take a powerful blow -> 6
* Sentry turrets light up, but Dallas shields himself from getting hit and runs for a nearby room. Side room has syringes. Werewolf heroin?
* Dallas: should I inject it? Everyone: no! Dallas looks around -> 12
  * What here is in the greatest danger? nothing really...
  * What can I use to find out more about Sycamour's plans? Blueprint! It's the museum, but as though Sycamour had taken it over. It was going to become a heavily fortified base
  * How can we best end this quickly? Hammer time
* Dallas smashes his way through the floor, finds a level of normal factory type stuff. There's a machine, and a puppet.
* Army of puppets blocking the doorways. Dallas will break through! -> 12
* Texts group: hey, ton of puppets! Who wants to break things?
* The whole group smashes through the front door, Dallas + Hammer first!
* Big robot powers up! TARGET ENGAGED!

## Factory battle

* Enter battle as a team. LH is in charge. 4 team!
* Giant robot vs. Zephyr. TIME FOR WIND SWORDS. -> 12, takes out knees, avoids blows
* Dallas brings the hammer down -> 7

* Zephyr dodges puppets, smashes through them like a badass -> 12, creates opportunity
* LH unleashes the Reinhart ultimate -> 10. Scattered body parts of puppets
* M: You okay? D: Bummed out we don't have anything left to hit. M: that's good! D: I guess. M: You're awesome! D: Thanks. I wasn't fishing for that btw. M: What's fishing? Dallas must now explain.
* Meanwhile, Nick psychically scans for people. Two signatures, one is MoP, other is Caesar. Third floor of five.
* Nick: Hey guys there's more people to hit!
* Second floor: turrets. Crouched behind concrete, laser blasts going over head, Nick: Hey Z, who are you taking to prom? Z: I really want to break something! Goes to break turrets.
* Over comms, Master of Puppets: Oh god not you four again! Z: Yes us four again! MOP: how did you get here? Z: Lost looking for the bathroom. M: Front door. MOP: Looking for the bathroom? it's right there. Puppets starts running downwards & pointing.
* While banter is going on, Nick teleports to MOP's location. Caesar's here, and laughing.
* Nick burns! -> 6. Grabs Caesar, teleports back to the group
* Caesar: where am I? M: Welcome back! Caesar wants to be here! C: he's my dad's friend! M: He's a villain. C: I was never an orphan. You are the bad guys. M: I AM NOT A BAD GUY.
* Caesar's hair is fading from red to black. M: You have templates too? C: He's my dad because we share last names. LH: my name is Laser Hawk Lilac. C: okay hi dad
* C: I'm calling the police. Nick: Police are why we're here. We didn't rob any banks or steal savings from people.
* Nick: you want proof? Caesar: Yes. Nick transmits his memories of Sycamour, including Romanus. He's in a trance for a good half minute. Confused and afraid. Caesar: I want more proof. Nick: Fine, we'll go back & look at police evidence.
* LH: Craig Lilac is a fabrication.
* Caesar: I want to see my dad. Nick: Yeah, but with the cops around. Caesar punches Nick to try and escape, but Dallas grabs him.
* Nick: Guys, we should leave now, this is our exit. LH fireman carries Caesar out.
* Exit is filled to the brim with more robots. But we can all bust out in various ways.
* Nick teleports away. Melody & Zephyr phase out. LH Physics his way out -> 11

## Kidnapping

* We're taking Caesar back to the cops. Text Anna: we found Caesar in the company of a known supervillain & extracted him. Anna: where are you? Nick: on the way. BTW here's the warehouse
* Anna: did he come willingly? Nick: Technically yes. Anna: this is important. Nick: he wanted proof. Also he wants to see his dad.
* Anna: you'd be breaking the law, kidnapping him. Don't come here. Nick: Okay. Anna: Go to the house.
* Caesar is still struggling. Nick tries to reason with him.
* Nick: at least give us a chance? (No reaction)
* M: You did some things that were really bad, but it wasn't really you. I don't want people making you do bad things. I wouldn't want that happening to me.
* N: I could mind control you to be happy with this. I'm not. Doesn't that tell you who we are? (Silence)
* Z: We got shit to do tonight.
* Anna shows up. Caesar makes a run for the door. Anna stays still. We let him run - this is all we can do.
* Anna: .. He's getting away. LH: gives chase.
* LH: You're out on bail. If you do anything illegal, we gotcha. If you go to that guy you thought was your dad, we're bringing him in sometime.
* Anna to Z: why did you let him get away? Z: So we're not kidnapping him.
* Nick: mom, I gave him my memories. If he's gonna come back, hopefully it'll be because of that.
* Anna: if you're sure. Nick: we're not sure, but we don't know how else to prove it.
* Anna: it takes effort to change minds. M: We're not gonna give up. But sometimes pushing too hard breaks things. (Nick looks at Zephyr but says nothing)
* Anna: need a ride?
* Nick: Lewis, who are you asking? Lewis: It's a surprise. M: Hope it's not a surprise to whoever you're going with.
* Nick: is this a desperation date? Lewis: I forgot. Dallas: Take my cousin, she's 11 & the worst. Nick: take the Bunnies.
* Z: I'll figure something out. Dallas: we meeting up beforehand? Z: (is already gone)
