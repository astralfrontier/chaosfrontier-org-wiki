# Session 19 (2019-09-07)
* From last session, Zephyr got out of the blast radius (player is out this session)

## Two hours to prom!

* Melody puts stuff on a USB drive
* LH - before he was a superhero, mom would pick clothes & know who he was dating. What's Dallas going to say? He paid for the tux himself thanks to internship (that Zephyr does), and told his mom he's going to prom (moms always know)
* LH gets a message on Mundane phone from mom: "be careful" etc. Dallas also never named his date. Dallas: "you'll get pictures." It's a childhood friend, you don't know them.
* Melody - doesn't talk to Fiona. "I'm going to school!" Fiona is dubious. "what's going on?" M: "There's dancing!" F: "You could have told me." M: "Was distracted by tracking down prison escapee."
* Nick - tells his mom he's going with Melody. Anna texting. "(sigh) have fun". Nick: "I'll stay out of trouble, we'll talk about Caesar when I'm back." Anna: thumbsup.

## Amnesia

* Nick can teleport
* Dallas goes a couple blocks down, meets Alex, head there on skateboard
* Melody walks!
* Jeremy & Lucy are already at school when Nick arrives. Nick...waves and is friendly? J&L are busy drinking from the punch.
* Dallas arrives! With Alex. Nick: "You folks are lookin good" D: "We can look okay." A: "I tried." Nick: "did your mom give you a ride?" D: "Skated here." N: "Housing? Bunk bed?" A: "I sleep under his single bed." D: "I offered my bed!" A: "That would be worse." D: "If my mom saw a completely different person it'd be strange?" N: "Why would it be strange?" D: "You made some assumptions." A: "He wouldn't tell his mom if he got a puppy." D: "I did have a puppy" N: "I'm unclear on the situation here but I'm okay with that." D: "It's morally grey. Mom is being lied to. It's complicated."
* Nick: "how long is it gonna be before you take an arrow to the mask for your mom?" D: "She will never know. I dunno." Nick: "Red Vox membership and housing?"
* D: "Hey can you erase my mom's memory of Alex being in the house?" Dallas proposes various friend favors, but Nick is doubtful.
* Melody arrives at prom!
* Nick: "you can't just erase people's memories casually." D: "Just small moments!" Nick: "if your mom finds out, I'll go to bat for you, but won't erase memories."
* Melody: "I'd rather get hit by a bat than lose memory! Sorry I'm late!" Nick: "You came at a perfect time to get me out of this conversation." M: "Why?" N: "Explaining would put me back in the conversation."
* M: "You look good in that collar!" D: "It's a trick of the light." M: "Why would it be a trick?" D: "I dunno, just can't take a compliment." M: "But you took one when we fought those guys in the warehouse?" D: "That wasn't a compliment, it was truth." M: "I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true!" D: "I must reflect on this."
* M: "Alex, that's a great look too!" A: "Thanks, I stole it from him." M: "You could have just asked him, he'd give it to you." A: "Would he?" D: "Sure, no big deal." A: "how about your mask?" D: "Literal or metaphorical? I could get a new mask."
* A: "I could be your Zephyr, but for superheroics!" D: "You'd be the second Laser Hawk!" A: "I'd miss being myself." Melody thinks the world needs there to be an Alex. Awww. High five!
* Where is Nick standing? Next to Melody? He's uncertain.
* M: "I have important questions for you later but not right now!" D: "Are you sure they're important?" M: "Yes, but not important now. Time and place for everything!" D: "You just taught me something. I thought everything that's important was urgent." M: "That's not true!" D: "I'm learning." M: "We came to school to dance, not to learn!"
* D: "Alex, you want to dance?" Alex grabs hand, tries to do a dance move, but Dallas is too big. D: "I'm more light on my feet on the dance floor."

## Two couples talking

* Nick notices Jeremy & Lucy are gone. They're right behind Nick. Grando shoves Nick: "Hey Nick, where's your date?" N: "This is Ayami, this is my date for the prom." Lucy: half-disappointed, half-bewildered. M: looks at Lucy because she's confused that Lucy's confused.
* Jeremy shoves Nick. "ALRIGHT! I knew you could get a date!" M: looks at Jeremy confused. Lucy: "It's nice that you got a (blink) date..." Melody: "we're here as friends!" Nick: "Yeah!" M: "Is it weird to have friends?" Lucy: "I guess you could bring a friend to prom..." M: "Well yeah, it makes sense!"
* M: "You two are friends too right?" Lucy: "Well no..." M: "You're not friends?" L: "Boyfriend." M: "It has the word friend in it." L: "Means something different." Jeremy: "we're more than friends!" M: "Okay!" Nick explains more-than-friends to Melody. M: "ohh that makes sense!"
* Nick smirks at Jeremy for explaining it. J: blank look, then smiles. "ALRIGHT! Now I see why you're friends with her! You're her translator!" M: "In a way..." Nick: "I'm okay with that."
* Lucy: "where's Zephyr?" M: "Don't know, I'm worried. He should have been here first." Nick: (WILL NOT throw Zephyr under the bus for no date) "He had something urgent." J: "maybe his date's mom got kidnapped." N: "I'm sure it's for a good reason"
* Lucy looking around, sees Amy. Nick sees her too.
* Lucy bolts toward Amy: "oh oh! Do you remember me? From last year?" Amy is confused: "Who are you?" Lucy: "From the orphanage! I was in Sports Club!" Amy: "how do you know I'm from Sports Club?" They continue talking...
* Nick: "Jeremy, you two look good, thanks for coming, glad you are here." Lucy is coming back from talking to Amy, looking very disappointed. M: "What's wrong?" Lucy: "They don't remember me. I was in school, last year, no one here remembers me." Nick and Dallas don't remember her in school either.
* Nick: "that sounds very suspicious." L: "You don't remember?" N: "No, but I'll believe you." D: "Reasonable." Nick: "Caesar lost memory, maybe there's something else going on?" L: "Why do this all for me?" J: "You remember _me_ right?" Nope. God dammit.
* N: "I want people to remember you now that you're here again." J: "Not sure how we can make people remember again." Nick: "If only you knew a telepath." Nick will investigate, after the dance. Lucy: "Yeah. Fuck them." J: "Oh yeah, they are trouble."
* Why remember them? M: "What happened last time?" J: "You watch anime?" M: "Of course!" J: "You know those slice of life animes with the bully and the main character?" M: "yes! THAT GIRL." J: "Amy & her friends are THAT GIRL." M: "I KNEW IT." Melody looks happy/upset.
* J: "Hold on. you talk to her?" M: "I talk to everybody!" J: "makes sense." M: "but sometimes they're not nice people." J: "That's fine. you don't have to talk to assholes." M: "I hope they can learn." J: "if anime taught me anything, everyone can be saved! but maybe not right now." Melody thumbs-up. Grando fistbumps. M: "You and me and Lucy should watch anime!"
* M: "Thanks for helping me pick this dress!" L: "You're welcome."

## Vanya

* Dallas is dancing with Alex! Girl photographer! "This one's going in the books!"

* Dallas knows her! She's Vanya, head (not leader) of Journalism club.
* V to Dallas: "Can we talk? Privately?" A: "don't be surprised if I get taken."
* V: "So...Laser Hawk, right?" D: "Why would you think that?" V: "My brother told me."
* V: "You ordered a bunch of clothing for your costume. Dallas Guerrera." Dallas bought stuff from Superhero Supplies Online

* Vanya also knows Lewis is Zephyr. Dallas wants to foist her off on the Bunnies, Red Vox, or anyone
* V: "You know Nightquake?" D: "Yeah?" V: "Followed a bitcoin trail to Nightquake. email was threatening my brother."
* D: "I want to help, not sure how." (still playing it like he's not Laser Hawk)
* V: "well if you want my brother to die..." D: "Wait. I know heroes who can help. heroes have secret IDs for a reason. Going around, saying them out loud, violates privacy."
* D: "Here's a phone. Text this info to you." V: "This is related to work, the person who sent email is tied to Sycamour."
* V: "Fine. I got pictures I need to take." Dallas gets picture, forwards to mom. Mom: :heart: "I think I know that person..." D: "you've seen them in the neighborhood. but not in our house!" Mom: "have fun!"
* V & Dallas head back down.

## Back downstairs!

* Nick asked Melody to dance! Alex is recording it!
* LH is waiting next to Alex. A: "How was it?" D: "Might be a problem brewing." A: "Was your breath that bad?" D: "her brother is being threatened by Sycamour. Sycamour is threatening them for my identity." On D's work phone: "I need some more details about this thing."
* Sycamour threatens to kidnap Vanya's brother (Hans?) in Prom+2 days
* Melody finishes dancing with an ending pose! Nick is following. Applause!
* Dallas flags them down. D: "I waited in the face of important information. Time and place for everything. Someone found out about me. Traced me back to specific online vendor." M: "we have to protect them." D: "We do that by tracking down this email." M: "Probably a good start." Nick: "send it to both." D: "Can you trace something like this?" M: "I can try."
* D: "We could wait til after prom. We have 2 days." M: "First thing tomorrow then." D: "We have time to do both." Nick: "Are you sure it's 2 days?" D: "No reason to disbelieve date in the email." M: "Museum attack happened on time. This will too! They're prompt about their times." D: "Sycamour is punctual."
* Dallas forwards email to Anna Hel. Unread. M: "is mom okay?" Nick texts. Mom: "Yeah. work." Nick sends selfie with group: "I'm doing okay. I love you very much."
* Nick: "We can wait til tomorrow, but if you think it's urgent, don't wait, it's okay to interrupt us."
* Dallas wants to figure out what's up with the email -> 13! Per Alex, they are super punctual. To get influence, show up & confront them. LH, Nick, Melody apparently have influence already. Dallas thinks about sending an email back to the villain, talking about unmasking themselves.
* Email sent! People go back to dancing.
* Dallas busts a move! -> 5, +2 team. Melody suggests to Nick that they partner swap. Attracts attention because Dallas is intense. Dallas takes influence over Grando!
* Nick busts a move! -> 10, he can dance on his own and won't disappoint her
* Melody busts a move! -> 13, takes influence over Lucy
* Bunny Brigade: "Ayami, didn't know you wanted to dance with Dallas! Are you teaching him?" M: "Nope, first time!" D: "I hardly know Ayami." BB: "Those moves look like a superhero!" M: "Dallas is obviously a natural!" D: "I'm a mild-mannered student council member."
* BB: "Are you training him? I wanna be trained too!" Melody: "yeah!" Bruno gives Melody his number. The others just stare. "Yeah, we can be a team!"
* Dallas's phone buzzes. It's the email. Where to meet? The ruins of the Werewolf Factory. Dallas flexing on the bad guys.
* Marlone can work on tracing this email, but it might take awhile. He sends Dallas a telephone number for Superbug, a detective.
* OOC speculation that Superbug is Begonias' boyfriend.

## Melody & Dallas

* Melody drags Dallas off. Alex: ? M: "I promise I won't hurt him!"
* M: "I wanted to know about your date!" D: "It's going well." M: "But did you find out?" D: "What?" M: "The answer." D: "Is there a question?" M: "Obviously, that's why you're on this date!" D: "What?"
* D: "What is the question?" M: "Whether your feelings of love are real, that's why you're on the date."
* D: "That's a very challenging question." M: "So when do you find out the answer?" D: "aaa-uuuuh. Ever baked a cake?" M: "Watched cooking shows!" D: "They show you the baking process. Not in the oven. What's in the oven determines whether the cake is good." M: "But you set the temperature." D: "The heat is there! what it means & what it'll do is to be determined."
* D: "I don't have the answers here. What happens inside the oven is a mystery." M: "I'm really confused right now."
* D: "The important thing to remember is that I don't have an answer yet. Only way to answer is to finish baking the cake. That is, my potential relationship with Alex." M: "I don't understand. Easier question!" D: "I'd prefer it."
* M: "Why do you want to be more than friends with Alex?" D: "It's complicated. It's the interconnectedness between two people. Easy answer is because I like Alex. If you like cake, you want a lot of it." M: "Makes more sense than last answer." D: "I'm killing it with these cake metaphors."
* M: "Favorite kind of cake?" D: "Funfetti. Ultimately." M: "Good choice. Colorful!"
* D: "I'm gonna go back to Alex. Any more awkward embarrassing questions?" M: "Sorry, should have waited!"
* D: "Is there a rush to know?" M: "We've been busy. With things going on, what happened with Caesar could happen to me." D: "Worried about that?" M: "Yeah, but I have a plan!" D: "Should we be worried?" M: "I have a plan. I'll start the plan, then finish the plan. I promise!"
* D: "I can help if you need. That's how friends work." M: "I know. I appreciate it. Thank you for answering my questions."
* D: "I won't push for information, but feels like there's something you're not saying." M: "I figured out how to make save states, I want the whole team to have it. Nick's powers mean I should give this one to Nick." D: "Good choice."
* D: "Worried about being erased? They'd have to go through us to do it. Can't see it happening." M: "Thanks Dallas."
* Comfort & Support! -> 10
* M: "Did a lot of thinking after Caesar. Realized if they messed with my programming, it wouldn't be me. Would be someone who looks like me. The real Ayami is a hero." D: "Every good thing you've done was something you did as a hero." M: "I'm not gonna be a bad guy." D: "Rest of us won't let them either." M: "I'm just scared. I only came because people wanted to. I feel bad about Caesar." D: "He's not dead, we have another chance." M: "I'm just worried."
* M: "Anyway sorry! Hope I didn't bring you down at all." D: "Night isn't down. Night is still moving up."
* Fistbump!
* Zephyr flashes back to asking.... Emily from the library!
