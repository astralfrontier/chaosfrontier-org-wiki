# Session 19a (2019-09-11)
> The timing of this has yet to be determined, but it's sometime during the night of prom

"Hey Nick?  Can I talk to you for a few minutes?"
 
If Nick is surprised by this request, it's lost in the sea of disbelief that he's here, dancing with people and not making a fool of himself. "S-sure. What do you want to talk about?"
 
"I don't think this is the best place to talk right now.  People keep interrupting," she pauses, "including me, since I interrupted Dallas, too.  This is a bad place to talk.  Can we just go somewhere else real quick and come right back?  No one will ever know we're gone, I don't think.  I need your help with something."
 
"I left all my stuff at home. Almost all." Nick pulls two things out of his tux for inspection. One is his diary. The other is the Sakura figurine. "I came as myself. And with someone to ask for help around you." He holds out the figurine, but doesn't let go of it. "So close your eyes, tell your sister where you want to go, and make a wish."
 
She looks up, surprised.  "You brought Sakura?"  Then she smiles brightly.  "I'm glad!  She would love to be at a place like this!" She puts one finger to her lips for a second and taps three times in thought, then nods as if she's come to a decision.  "I know!"  She closes her eyes and says quietly "Let's go the park, Sakura!"
 
"You can open your eyes," Nick says after a moment. It's quieter, and greener, and he's looking around. "Huh. I wasn't quite sure that was going to work... Neat."
 
Ayami opens her eyes to see the park at night and walks around enthusiastically.  "Oooooooooooo, I've never been here at night before!  It looks so different!"  She spins around to look at Nick, her dress flaring with the spin and settling gracefully.  "I'm not surprised it worked, though!  You've really been on point all night with your dancing.  I'm very impressed!  I know you practiced a lot and worked hard, but it's like you're on an entirely different level tonight."
 
"Ah, heheh, I had a good teacher." Nick can't quite make eye contact, but his smile (and red face) are genuine.
 
"Even if a teacher is good at what they do, the student has to meet them halfway!  Give yourself some credit, Nick!  You should be proud of yourself!"
 
"I'm .. I'm proud that you thought I was worth teaching." Nick stumbles over the words. "But... " There's a pause, and he finally snaps out of it. "It was fun, wasn't it. And I always have fun with you. So, I'm proud I could make you happy doing that."
 
"It WAS a lot of fun," she agrees, smiling.  "And of course you're worth teaching!  You're my friend, and I know you can do a lot more than you give yourself credit for! Speaking of being friends, why did you think I was going to decline your invitation, anyway?  You said you knew I wasn't going to care about this stupid social ladder, but you also said that you didn't think anyone was going to say yes.  Which meant you thought I was going to say no.  Why?  Why would I decline going somewhere with one of my best friends?"
 
It takes a moment. "Oh, to the dance?" *Is she serious?* Nick struggles to explain the obvious. "Well, I mean, I thought.. uh, someone else must have asked you first, so you'd be going with them, y'know?"
 
Confusion immediately appears on Ayami's face.  "We just learned about it that day and I was getting a dress with Lucy.  When would anyone have asked me?"
 
*That's a good point.* "I mean, anyone would have. Everyone would have. Anyone in their right mind would have asked you immediately." *Except me, because I'm confused.* "I'm sure the whole school would have wanted to ask you. I guess they don't know how to get in contact with you, so lucky me."
 
The confusion deepens.  "You... aren't making a lot of sense, Nick.  I feel like you didn't think about this logically."
 
*She's probably right. No, she's definitely right.* Nick holds out his hands, gesturing for emphasis. "Okay. So. You are.. one of the most interesting, attractive, charming girls in our school. Probably the most of all of those things. Every person who wanted a date would therefore try to ask you out, right? That makes sense, right? Anyway, because of that, I felt, y'know, it would be awkward if someone did ask and then I asked, because then you might feel pressure to pick me because you know me, rather than trying something new which you seem to love doing, and anyway, we can always get together and talk but there's only one homecoming, so what I'm saying is, I'm the luckiest guy in the world because you said yes and I don't want you to think I wouldn't want to ask you, okay?" The words come out in a rush. It sounded much more logical in his head.
 
Ayami stares at him.  "So what you're saying is, you actually had no good reason to think that I'd say no because you knew that no one had asked me before I went to get a dress.  And you, for some reason, didn't think about the fact that I was only with Lucy and Grando up until the time we all met back up and they were going together?  And that you didn't want to ask me because you thought I would rather not go with my best friends for the sake of doing something different?  That's... really odd reasoning, Nick."
 
"It is! I know it's odd reasoning!" Nick doesn't need to be told this at all. But he's babbling and that train has no brakes. "I had no reason to think you'd say no at all, in fact when you said that stuff at the clothing store, that's why I immediately asked you to the dance, because you're the one person who'd say yes if I did because you're wonderful. I just.. didn't really .. it didn't occur to me I'd get there first, is all."
 
Ayami tilts her head.  "Okay, so... you said no one would go with you because you weren't thinking logically about it.  That makes sense!" She smiles again.
 
*Victory!* "Yes. Yes, that's right." Nick smiles weakly. "But it worked out...um... well."  Lewis. Dammit, what's he going to do about this? "Really well." He pauses, and remembers. "Is that what you wanted to talk to me about?"
 
"Oh.  Actually, no." The smile vanishes.  "Actually, I wanted to talk to you about a plan I came up with.  I hope you'll help me with it."
 
"I'll always help you, Ayami, with whatever you need." That much is honest and easy to say.
 
"I'm.... really scared after what happened to Ceasar.  What is happening to him right now... that's what I'd probably be like if someone reprogrammed me.  He doesn't know who he is or what he's doing or what's happening and they're forcing him to do bad things...  But the real Ayami isn't a villain, and I'm not going to let them make me one without a fight.  Back at the museum you said Zephyrus wasn't really dead, that her emotions lived on as a ghost.  So I have The Book of Melody and a savestate on the USB drive I brought with me.  I want you to take it, and use it if something happens to my programming.  Maybe you can save me with it using your powers, and... even if you can't... maybe you can use it so that the real Ayami is still here somehow and wouldn't really be... gone..."

She looks Nick straight in the eyes, and he can see the fear.  "I don't want to be a villain."
 
"Hey. Hey." Nick smiles, now comfortable meeting that gaze. "When I left the party and Romanus used his powers on me, you all found me. I broke Romanus. And when my mom wanted Caesar found, we went and found him. And I don't even *like* that guy.  You think if someone took you away from me, and changed you, I'd let anything or anyone on this planet stop me from bringing you back and letting you be yourself again?" He holds up a pinkie finger. "I promised."
 
She offers a small smile in return.  "I know... Dallas said they'd have to get through him... and you... and Lewis... and I believe him but... I want to have a plan in case.  In case the worst happens, I want you to have every advantage.  I want to make sure I have done everything to help you help me."
 
Nick nods. "I'll take those things." Then a light dawns. "Hey. I can reprogram you." He realizes how that probably sounds, and holds up his hands. "Not like that! What I mean is, we can connect mind-to-mind, right? If someone reprogrammed you, it follows that your mind would change if I read it, right? So does that mean, if I use telepathy on you, your programming changes too?"
 
She blinks twice.  "Uh... Well, technically the base program isn't changing if all you're doing is just reading it, but yeah, technically anything I'm learning is making a change to the data that's there, so if you're speaking and I'm processing an input then a change is taking place."
 
"Okay. Okay..." Nick rubs his hands together. "Y'know that place we went to practice dancing, the gym? People go there for strength training. Build up muscles. And we get diseases, but we have immune systems, so we also get vaccines - y'know, like smaller, weaker versions of those diseases. Like training. No - no - like rehearsal. We let our body rehearse its defenses against the real disease, so on opening night, it's ready! You know? And uh, so it seems like one form of control is probably like another, which means, oh! Romanus did something to you at the hotel room so I already know it's possible. Ayami, I'm gonna train you to resist mind control! To give you better defenses against being reprogrammed." He sounds really excited now. "I don't want you to just wait for us to save you. I want you to have the power to save yourself too!"
 
"Wait... wait... that..." the fear is leaving her eyes as she thinks about it.  "That... sounds plausible.  That sounds possible.  Nick, you're actually a genius!  That's so much better than a backup plan!  I... I... Thank you!"  Her tone goes from hopeful to relieved to completely joyful as she runs up to Nick and pulls him into a tight hug.
 
Nick's face flushes bright red. Perhaps part of that is a lack of oxygen - *how strong is she?* "I mean I don't know that it'll work yet but I want to try," he adds, out of breath and still babbling a bit. "But uh, I understand a little bit about how minds work, and you have a mind, and oh, I should tell you something too. Is that okay?"
 
"Even if it doesn't work," she says, completely serene, "it's better than doing nothing. I have a backup plan and now there is a chance I have an actual plan. I'm thankful even if it doesn't work. But I do think it has a good chance of working."
It takes her a moment longer to realize she has been asked a question. "Oh, uh, sorry, I got carried away," she says, letting go and stepping back a little. "You wanted to talk about something. And I probably hugged you a bit too hard. Sorry. Go ahead."

"Oh wait." She reaches into her pocket. "I should probably give you the drive first. Hang on. I don't want to forget. It's why I wanted to come out here after all." To Ayami it looks like a USB drive. Entirely unremarkable. To Nick it looks like a stage light hitting a cut diamond. "Okay, sorry, you can talk now.  I just didn't want to forget."
 
Nick isn't sure whether to pocket it or just admire it. He breathes carefully for a few moments, struggling to hold down his own emotions in the face of the heady mixture of fear and hope here. Into a pocket it goes, but he keeps a hand there, as though ensuring nothing happens to it. "Right." He takes another breath. "So. You mentioned ghosts. Uh, humans have an internal model of the world. It's not reality, just our idea about reality. And it's imperfect, right? I can't see behind me. I remember the park, but maybe there's a jogger I can't see now. And our expectations affect that model."

"When we meet someone, we see a part of them. We fill in the rest with guesswork, or impressions from other people. And we can predict what they'll do, because we have that model. I mean, say something you think I would say, but something you don't think I've ever actually said. Be Nick for a moment, pretend, and say something that sounds like me." He smiles, and waits.
 
"Just... anything?"
 
Nick nods. "Anything you think that I might say, but haven't said."
 
"With no context?"
 
Nick nods again. "I mean if you need a context, how about, um, something about your dress." He hasn't complimented it, he's honestly awkward about doing so, and he means to, but -- enough, onward with the experiment.
 
"It's really hard to come up with a random phrase with no context.  I don't think you need a catchphrase, Nick.  If you do, you should consider asking Grando for advice on that.  But if you were going to say something about my dress, I would imagine you would say it looks very nice, but since you haven't said anything it means you'd probably ramble a bit and say something like 'Ayami, that dress looks very nice, and that shade of purple looks nice with your hair, and I really like the flowers'. Or something like that."

She smiles.  "How did I do?  Did I pass?"
 
*That's uncomfortably accurate.* "Yes. Yes, I would say that," Nick admits. "You passed. So. A lot - I mean a lot - of human distress stems from differences between our model of the world, and the real world. Or our model of people, and real people. We want people to like us. We want things to go well. We want to be heroes, instead of mind-controlled supervillains. Empathy is when we see other people and recognize their feelings in us. And we can recognize something we feel, but don't realize we feel, by seeing someone else feeling it. So, uh."

There's no turning back now. "Three things come out of this. First. I talked to Zephyr. Uh. He helped me realize... how annoying it is when I run away from things. Like you saw me do in the mall. I'm sorry for that. I'm gonna do my best not to run away from difficult things again."
 
"Oh, so everyone has empathy if they have feelings.  I guess it isn't really as much of a super power as it seems, huh?  But that's good!  That means I can get better at it!" she smiles. "Everyone gets afraid sometimes.  Sometimes people run away.  But I think it's good when we're able to face things we're afraid of.  That's what courage is."

"And sometimes... we find things that help us feel less afraid." She smiles serenely and she starts glowing very softly.  It's like she practically has an aura of peacefulness about her.
 
Nick nods. "So the second thing. We learn about other people, fit their reality into our model, by our senses, right? But I have other senses, so I'm better at it. But I also sometimes confuse other peoples' feelings with mine. That's not good. I want everyone to have the right to feel what they want, and be who they want. So, that's another reason I'll do everything in my power to keep you from being a supervillain, or help you stop being one. Because you choose not to be one. That's worth defending. Even if you weren't my friend, I'd do that. But you are. So I'll work extra hard, whatever it takes. I'll be one of the things that helps you feel less afraid, because you've done it so often for me."
 
Ayami nods.  "I am also going to do everything I can to be who I want to be, and not who someone else tries to force me to be.  I appreciate all you have done to help me with that.  It's given me a lot of strength.  I feel like you help me try to be the best version of myself."
 
*I could use some strength right now.* Nick swallows, and smiles weakly. "Third thing. Because I won't run away. And because I have to be myself, no matter what. Um." I wish I knew how to say this properly. But I'll say it my way. "Even if something did happen to you, I have to tell you this. Aya, I'm in love with you. I love you." Inwardly, he braces himself. Whatever will befall him, at least he said it. "You help me be the best version of myself too."
 
> Ayami takes a poweful blow -> 6

"I... What...?" the serenity vanishes as a torrent of emotions flies across her face.  "I..," a sad hopelessness.  "I don't know what the word means... and I don't understand how to explain what I think..."
 
Nick holds up his hands, quickly. "I know. You don't have to do anything. Or say anything. I'm telling you something about myself, that's all. I know I'm confusing, but.. maybe.. someday you will understand what it means. Until then, I'm your friend, I'll always be your friend."
 
"I didn't know it was possible to feel so close to someone and suddenly feel like I'm so far away...  I thought... I thought we had an understanding...  I don't like not understanding..."
 
Nick hangs his head. *I fucked up. I thought this was going to go okay..  Maybe Lewis was right.* He shakes his head violently. *No! No. I said I won't run away.* "I'll do my best to help you understand. Do you want that?"
 
"I..." tears appear but don't fall "I... want to be able to at least say what I think somehow, even if I don't really understand.  But I... really hate the idea of feeling this awful disconnect..."
 
Nick holds out his hand. The other is still on his pocket, where the USB drive rests. "I can tell you with words. I can use telepathy. Or I can wait, if you need to sort it out. Aya, whatever you choose to do, I'll support you. I promised to help you smile and be happy. I mean it. Right now, whatever you want, I'll do."

He thinks. "Or... if you want, I'll be as patient as you want, if what you need is for me to listen."
 
"I want to try to be honest, but... my honesty makes no sense and I'm sorry."
"I've tried to think about this once before and... it just didn't make any sense.  So I don't think it'll make sense to anyone."
 
It's Nick's turn to offer a hug. "Be honest. Whether it makes sense or not, be honest."
 
"I feel like it's not the same but I don't understand.  I'd say I feel closer, but that's not really right.  I feel close to Dallas and Lewis, too.  And I'd say we have a connection, but, once again, that's like them.  But it's like it's in another language or something and it's just... different.  But it's not.  God I sound so STUPID.  It's so frustrating."
 
"You don't sound stupid," Nick says softly. "You sound like you are sorting through your feelings. I did that too. It was frustrating and confusing for me too. I'm still listening."
 
"I don't even like thinking about it because it makes me feel like I'm comparing my friends and I don't want to do that because you're my best friends.  But I have no way to figure anything out than by comparison and it hurts.  It just hurts.  And it's terrible because Dallas and Lewis feel like they're my family and every time I try to think about how I feel about you it just never made any sense, Nick.  I could never figure it out.  And I thought I figured it out at the hospital when we were best friends and we pinky swore and I felt so close to you but we're all best friends and... I just stopped trying to figure it out after a while because maybe it didn't need a name because all that mattered was that we all were the way we were but... as a result I can't really explain it and you want to talk about something I don't understand and now I feel like I'm really far away from you and it's such a bad feeling."

"The only thing I can say is that it isn't a crush because I never felt like I needed to try to be closer or anything, we just WERE close," she adds lamely.
 
Nick thinks he gets it. Or hopes so. He doesn't dare use telepathy without consent right now. "Are you afraid that if you feel one way about one friend, you have to feel that way about the others? Like, you were worried about choosing someone to ask to prom, but you didn't want to be a bad friend. Is that it? Do we need to be treated equally for you to feel comfortable?"
 
She sighs.  "I don't know.  I just... I guess I just wanted to do the right thing.  And I don't know what the right thing is, but I don't want to hurt the people who are most important to me..."
 
Nick nods slowly. "The thing about people? Every connection we have is unique. I do stuff with Dallas I wouldn't do with Lewis. But they are both my friends. Grando shit-talks me, but y'know, I think he's trying to be friends in his own way. What makes relationships great isn't that they're all the same, but that they're all different. If you told me you just wanted to be best friends, you didn't love me back, I mean, I'd... I'd understand, Aya. It would be okay. And I'd keep being your friend. If that's what you want most, if that'll make you happy, let's do that."
 
"Yeah... they're really different," she agrees, quietly, the frustration slowly leaving. "But I still didn't do a good job explaining."
 
Nick smiles. Somehow, this is alright. "You did a great job. You did better than me. All I said was a confusing word. You gave me all these thoughts that you've been saving up."
 
"You know... I still don't understand the word, but... it's okay if I don't understand today, right?"
 
Nick nods quickly. "It's always okay to not understand right now. You understand friendship. I don't know how you are so good at being a friend, and I'd love to know sometime. But your friendship is wonderful." He shrugs off his earlier admission. "Maybe, y'know, you'll find someone and recognize you do love them. And if you do, I hope that you tell them, like I told you."
 
"How did you know?"
 
"That's what I was saying, about recognizing our feelings by what we see in other people." Nick smiles, and suddenly remembers he can't talk about one example. "Like uh, um. Jeremy and Lucy. Or.. other friends, who feel love. When I saw them expressing their feelings, I felt... I realized, y'know, there was this empty part of my feelings that I wanted filled. And the person who could fill it was you. I wanted to show you the best parts of the whole world, and then see your smile at all of it. I wanted to be there when you learned new things, because when you feel joy, I do too. And um, there's romantic things, like um, kissing and cuddling and um, things like that--" He finds himself silenced by feelings of stupidity. None of that is going to happen now, idiot. "Just, y'know, a lot of different things."
 
"I want you to be happy, too, Nick," Ayami says quietly.  "When you said I help you not worry, I was really happy.  I don't like when you talk badly about yourself, because it hurts me to hear you do that.  I want you to see you the way I do: as someone who is kind and understanding and will do anything he can to help a person even if he doesn't like them.  Who always tries his best.  I really don't know what I'd do without you, Nick."
 
Nick smiles, uncertain but not sad. "Well, that's good. Because as much as I want, the way I knew I had a feeling of love was what I wanted to give you. I wanted to give you someone who understood you, and made you feel comfortable, and let you learn about the world and be part of it, at your own pace, in your own way. But... I can do those things as a friend, too, I guess." He looks away. "I know you see me that way. I'm starting to believe it. It's sometimes hard, but I'm trying. I promise."
 
"Of course you're trying.  You always do your best." She notes that they're still hugging.  "And I will say, you're a very good hugger.  It's very warm and safe and it honestly feels like a giant warm fuzzy blanket and it's really been very helpful during this entire conversation."
 
Nick blushes, and stammers. "I'm - I'm glad. That it's been helpful. But... " He lets go. "I was probably hugging a little more than a friend should. Sorry."
 
"But... I liked that.  If I wanted you to let go I would have said something." And she peers at him a bit more "And... you didn't really want to let go, either, did you?  You forced yourself."
 
*Well shoot. What now, smart guy?* "I'm... glad," Nick repeats, unsteadily. "I mean, that you liked it. I did too." She wants honesty. Needs it, really. "You're right. I didn't want to let go. And, I felt comforted too. And.. yeah." He isn't sure how to finish the thought, nor what else to do. So he leans in and kisses her.
 
Ayami kisses him back and when the kiss ends seems to think for a moment, and then says.  "I was wrong.  It isn't what singing feels like.  It's the reason people sing."

"'Cause all of me, loves all of you, love your curves and all your edges, all your perfect imperfections." Nick is singing, and grinning. "Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you, you're my end and my beginning, even when I lose I'm winning..." He stops, and speaks again. "Love is the feeling that made me do that. I didn't ask you if I could. I was wrong to do that, and I apologize."
 
Ayami laughs.  "Only Nick Hel would apologize for singing."
 
"No! No, I mean, I'm not a great singer, but I'm apologizing for the kissing--"
 
"You can sing as much as you want.  Next time I can sing, too!  Oh.  Why are you apologizing?  You really don't make much sense, do you?"
 
"Well, uh, because you aren't sure about love, and we're friends, and friends don't really kiss like that, and even if they did, it's still best to ask because some people aren't comfortable with it, and I just didn't know what else to say and went with it anyway when I really should have come up with something better to say, y'know, not just, listen. I'm babbling. Tell me what you want me to do, Aya." He pulls her back into a hug. "You said you liked this. Here, I'll do this."
 
She laughs.  "We're friends, and I'm not sure about love, but I just want you to be Nick, and me to be Aya, and we can see what we are?  I really didn't mind.  It felt nice.  Just like this feels nice.  Feeling close to you is a nice feeling."
 
Nick nods. "It does.." He realizes he'll start babbling again if he keeps this up. "But like, you don't wanna be a supervillain. Maybe you don't want to kiss someone either. People have to ask, they can't just do stuff to you. I'm gonna help you build up mental resistance, I promise. If you need to feel safe, I'll help any way you want. It's always okay to ask. It's always okay to tell me no, too. Okay? You can say no to anything. You deserve to make your own choices."
 
"If I had a problem, I'd be mad or upset and you'd know.  I'd talk about it.  Even if I tried to hide it from you, I think you'd know.  You know I'm not a liar."
 
"I know. I trust you." Nick smiles warmly. He's still not sure what's going on. But the girl in his arms isn't sure either. Maybe they can be comfortably confused together.
 
"I appreciate you helping me train.  That still makes me feel a lot more at ease knowing I can try to do something about it!  And I trust you, too.  That's why I wanted to talk about my plan with you in the first place.  And I have no idea what's happening but I know that you're going to help me, and I'm going to help you, so it'll be fine.  That's what Dallas said anyway, and even if he doesn't know anything about dates, I believe him."  And as she pauses, she freezes suddenly and looks at Nick.  "Wait a second...  I thought this wasn't a date...?"
 
Nick blinks. "It's uh." Oh yeah, I brought this on myself. The rooftop conversation comes back to him with a vengeance. "Well, so, it didn't intentionally start as a date. And if you don't love me, and aren't trying to find out, it still isn't, right?" *I wish it was a date. But she doesn't.*
 
"But I -am- trying to find out.  But I didn't know that.  Wow, dates are pretty confusing.  I guess I can't be too upset with Dallas making no sense!" she smiles and laughs
 
"Tell you what." Nick can't believe he's saying this, but his mouth has apparently taken control of his higher mental functions and is proceeding with its own agenda. "Go on a real date with me sometime, and we'll call this... an experiment. Then you'll be sure of what we're doing." *God dammit, she sounded like she wanted to be friends. But.... well, maybe...*
 
"Okay!  Maybe it'll be less confusing that way!"
 
Nick grins. *Yeah. Anything would be less confusing than my feelings right now.*
 
"So it wasn't and then it was.  I wonder if there's a term for that?"
 
Nick would scratch his head, but his arms are busy. "Maybe? Or maybe it's like being friends. Every experience is unique, and all we can do is try to apply labels like 'date' to it. They won't always fit, though."
 
"Hmmm, that could be.  I guess it isn't really worth dwelling on too much."  She rests her head against Nick's chest/shoulder.  "It worked out.  And it's going to be fine.  We'll figure it out."
"Try not to worry too much."
