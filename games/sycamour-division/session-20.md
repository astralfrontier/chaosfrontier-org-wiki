# Session 20 (2019-09-14)
## Love Letter

> Dear Lewis,
> "Hey kid. Remember when I told you I was going to train you? Yeah, it was less than just being able to do some crummy old swords." Roll me +Superior, and, on a hit, choose one. On a 10+ choose two instead!
> * "Being able to not be touched is just the beginning. You're turning into air, and air is rather... Dangerous in your hands. So why don't we try to incorporate that?" You focused on your phasing powers in one training session, and managed to unlock a new power relating to your phasing powers, specifically, a way to turn defense into offense too. What's that power, and how did you knock Auster off his feet when you first used it?
> * "My new barrier powers and wind manipulation are less different than you'd think. So why don't you take a page from my book, and try to get some more defense going into your arsenal?" You and Auster had a training session that focused solely on copying his new powers. Looking back, you can make some pretty good wind walls if you really try now. From now on, you can make nearly impassable wind walls at a whim, and, as a plus, how did you teach Auster something about his powers not even he knew about?
> * "You wanted to learn how to incorporate your powers into a proper Zephyrous fighting style with those swords, but that's only for close range combat. Sometimes, you'll fight people you can't get close to. So what better thing to do, than finding a way to weaponize those swords from a range?" You and Auster had a training session where all you did was try to touch Auster with those swords of yours, and you found a pretty ingenious way to get through his defenses at a range. What was that way, and where did you end up cutting Auster in when you finally got your hit?
* Lewis rolls -> 10!
  * Idea might change by the time the session comes around, but for the moment I'm thinking of phasing out of sight (a ninjas presence should be like the wind; felt, but never seen) provided that's allowed.
  * And with the wind walls, I was thinking the application that Zephyr figured out that Auster hadn't, is using mini barriers as platforms in order to effectively 'run on air'

## Showdown with Nightquake

* On the way to his house, Zephyr gets a call from his parents. Dad: "Lewis, come home now, no time to explain"
* At home, dad's hanging up phone. Lots of bags. Really a lot of bags. Moving-out level bags. Mr. Auster on couch, staring at Lewis.
* L: "WTF" Dad: "He came running here." Auster's neck is damaged. Dad: "it was bleeding. He can't talk."
* Auster got ambushed on the way back to his house after work, by Nightquake. NQ took Auster to dark alley & beat him up - to get Zephyr's secret ID. Auster didn't give Lewis away so NQ clawed his throat open.
* L: "Get him to the hospital." Dad: "no time to catch the plane." L: "Time doesn't matter, he needs medical attention."
* L grabs Auster. Auster grabs pen & paper for notes: "put a tracking device on Nightquake". Lewis obtains it.
* Auster's at the hospital. Where is Nightquake? Abandoned Blockbuster.
* This is around the time where the rest of the team is dancing & messing around at prom. No answer on phone.
* Zephyr will go it alone - smashing a hole into the Blockbuster! -> 7, marks Angry
* Windsword cuts the building in half. Then it dissipates around large metal bunker beneath the Blockbuster floor
* In the bunker it's dark. Zephyr is phased & invisible. Projectiles! But they do nothing. Time to track them to their source -> 9

#### Moment of Truth

> This is the moment when you prove how much the mantle belongs to you. You seize control of all
your powers, and you defeat even impossible odds to prove you are worthy of the name you carry.
You accomplish feats even your predecessors couldnâ€™t do. Of course, after you prove something
like that, you can expect still more responsibilities to be placed on your shoulders...

* It's dark. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
* Zephyr uses air-step powers to create his own path, sensing Nightquake via air currents
* Zephyr homes in on NQ at super-speed, using the momentary detection trace, and pummels him from a million directions at once

* NQ is knocked out. Zephyr takes him to the cops.
* Lewis back home. "What did you do?" "Beat up Nightquake." YEEEEAAAAAAH BOOOOOOOOIIIIII
* That guy had it coming for a long time, but I had prom an hour ago. Getting changed, clothes are in the bag.
* Lewis's mom fusses over Lewis. "Don't mess up your clothes, even if you're beating up Satan!" "Fix your hair, they will laugh at you!"
* "Mom, if I fight Satan, I'll kick" "He'll burn your boots" "How am I supposed to fight Satan?" "Use your wind thingie!" "I'll try to remember that next time"
* "Sweetie, have a good time at prom, even if you're an hour late - did you tell your date?" "Ehhhmmmmmm." "No son of mine would go to prom without a date" "I have someone in mind"
* RUN TO THE PROM

## Zephyr arrives!

* "What up everyone! The king is in the house!"
* Melody: "Where have you been? You okay?" Z: "Everything's good. Got a better story than anyone here." LH: "If its better, wheres your date at?" Z: "Ahahaha." M: "Something bad made him late! Aren't you concerned?" Z: "Nightquake's in prison, you're welcome." LH: "That is big news!" M: "I'm glad you're okay!"
* M: "We found out someone's threatening a guy about Laser Hawk." LH: "Something about NQ. Maybe we don't worry about it?" M: "Maybe it got fixed!" Z: "I'm proactively fixing these things" M: "That's amazing!" LH: "You fixed it before we knew we had a problem!"
* M: "we still having a team meeting tomorrow?" Z: "sounds solved. still situation with Romanus/Caesar & nightlight guy" LH: "Or we can use this opportunity to party harder than before!"
* Superbug texts Dallas: "Your boss paid me. Name is Cliff Burton. Master of Puppets." That's who's trying to uncover LH's identity
* He's still back at the same factory where we rescued Caesar
* LH: "Want to see us beat him up tomorrow? You into that?" SB: "I got things to do"
* LH texts Vanya: "situation is handled" Vanya is drinking punch.
* LH: "besides all that, we need to get you a date. Ton of people here. I'll be your wingman!" M: "What's a wingman?" LH: "Glad you asked." M: "Gonna explain it?" LH: "Yeah... wingman is like an assistant. That's it, mic drop!" M: "Assisting with what?" LH: "You know how we're in fights, and sometimes we need help from external sources? Wingman saves you." M: "Like from black holes?"
* Z: "Term comes from fighter pilots. Teams of two. Wingman will go around people chasing the first guy & gun them down. Two people assisting in other situations, like someone trying to get themselves a date. Wingman tries to support flight leader getting a date."
* M: "Why do you need assistance?" Z: "Makes things easier." LH: "teamwork!" Zephyr gets all academic and shit. Z: "Say Dallas wants people to know good stuff about himself. If he says it, it's bragging. If Nick goes over & praises Dallas, it sounds legit." M: "That happens normally though."
* LH: "we can talk about how great I am. We need to talk about how great Lewis is." M: "Doesn't everyone talk about how great Lewis is?" Z: "I can get a date, just need to undo one more shirt button" M: "This sounds really complicated." Z: "You have no idea. Humans are crazy, don't be human."
* LH: "Shirtless volleyball portion of wingman." M: "At prom?" LH: "Not at prom. Wingmanning in general. we will watch Top Gun!"

# Prom Spotlight: Zephyr

## The Hunt Is On

* The predators are on the move -> 8
* LH: "Tropes. Golden Age heroes always have reporter girlfriends. Vanya is part of school newspaper. This is writing itself!"
* Z: "What's she actually like?" LH: "She interrupted Alex & me, she has boundary issues!"
* Z: "Nothing ventured nothing gained!"
* Dallas heads to Vanya, Lewis hangs out at the punchbowl
* V: "LH told me the problem is being handled" Dallas: "LH is a good guy. Speaking of good guys - handsome track star Lewis West, all alone, like you! Let me rephrase."
* V: "Maybe you should start dancing with him." Dallas: "I have a date. Lewis might have some connection to the world of superheroing! Maybe you could talk to him."
* V: "Instead of talking to you? Not a bad idea." Dallas: "He's by the punch bowl"
* Dallas:

![](https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/54353/1773176-hercules___thumbs_up_2.jpg)

* V: "Tell Dallas's friend they're losing a date, he's really into you." Lewis: "I have that effect - just kidding. We haven't talked before. Lewis."
* V: "He told me. Vanya"
* Awkward small talk. V: "I'll vomit if I drink punch or dance." Lewis: "What those guys are doing isn't dancing. It's like a train wreck." V: "if you're so fascinated with it.." Grabs a camera from a fanny pack. "Maybe start recording for me."
* Lewis takes a picture of her. V: "I already have one of those." L: "Now you've got two"
* Banter & flirtation around cameras & picture taking
* L: "You keep trying to point me away." V: "I have a job to do. Why am I recording these people?" L: "School newspaper" V: "I can't both dance & record at the same time" L: "How many pictures do you need?" V: "Need recordings. And group picture. Talk to school-approved couples."
* L: "If you want to interview people, I'll be your cameraman" V: "Your grip is unsteady. Hand shaking." L: "Need to burn off a little energy."
* V: "Zephyr, I'm not into boys!"

![](https://i.imgur.com/9TvuNnA.jpg)

* L: "No idea what you're talking about with the Zephyr thing." V: "Maybe ask your boyfriend?" L: "He's just a friend." V: "Well he is a boy."
* L: "Good luck with recording stuff. Enjoy prom..."
* L returns to Dallas. "Did you know?" D: "Did I know....?" L: "That she's into girls." D: "From context, she's not also into boys?" L: "Didn't seem to be the case. Maybe Nick would be a better choice to help."
* Dallas takes a powerful blow -> 9, Guilty and Insecure - set my friend up for failure!
* D: "I set you up to fail, that's on me. We can still salvage this! .... Second time's the charm!"
* D: "All of sports club is single! That's three people!" L: "Head of sports club is dating a female DJ"
* While further options are reviewed, Lewis & Dallas have a hammer-themed argument
* Lewis is going to head out and burn off some energy on the track - maybe?
* Take a page out of Nick's book, go see if the library is open, browse for awhile, return to check on Dallas's progress

## Hunt Part Two

* Karen (student in drama club), Morgan (resident goth girl), Abby (track team)
* Dallas hands over dossiers to Lewis. "If it's a question of what I'm capable of, I can get you talking to any of these girls for sure". Lewis expresses doubt.
* L: "Do sports girls still hate us?" D: "I wasn't there so they don't hate me!"
* L: "Abby's nickname is Mother, short for Motherfucker. Confirm or deny?" D: "I heard that!" L: "Work your magic."
* D: "Hold this." A towel from school nurse's office. L: "What?"
* Dallas approaches Abby, accidentally spill his drink on her. "Oh no. I'm so sorry. Does anybody have a towel?"
* Lewis efficiently delivers towel to problem area - throwing it at Dallas's head. D: "Thank you kind stranger!" L: "WTF are you doing?" D: "It was an accident. Abby, I'm so sorry. Have you met Lewis?" and Dallas bails.
* L: "student council should be more coordinated. Sorry that happened to you." Abby: "What and why?" L: "He's a clumsy idiot and spilled his drink."
* L: "Sorry if this ruined your night." Abby: "You're Lewis right?" L: "part-time job. When I have time, do a bit of running."
* Mutual compliments on running speed. Abby came in third at a track meet. Awkward talk about track - L: "Want to dance?" Abby: "Sure"
* Lewis busts a move! -> 9. Dallas uses powers slightly to rearrange lightning, making things more cinematic! +1 Team
* Dallas:

* Lewis takes influence over Abby!
* Abby: "did someone spike the punch!" Cut to Grando looking nervous
* Lewis: "I don't... know. didn't pick up on anything. If someone did, I know who. I'll check later."
* Abby: "Are you seeing all this?" L: "The lights? whoever's running them brought their A game"
* Abby also doesn't know how to socialize. L: "Want to go out to the track?" Provoke -> 11!
* On the way to the door, Vanya gives Lewis a thumbs up. L: thumbs up back

# Prom Spotlight: Dallas

* Dallas is dancing with Alex! Alex: "can we take a break? getting a bit tired. Let's sit down."
* All chairs are taken. How about sitting outside? On the concrete.
* D: "were you having fun tonight?" A: "Dancing is cool & all, not exactly a Melody type" D: "Nobody's a Melody type"
* A: "You don't seem tired." D: "Just how my powers work. Wouldn't have to sleep if I didn't want to." A: "what about at night?" D: "Can absorb all kinds of light." A: "Like to see your powers using moonlight." D: "I can do that!" A: "Is it gonna be that easy? _Just_ moonlight."
* Maybe 1-2 people around at most, nobody's watching. Let's get away from these people.
* LH absorbs light! Alex not impressed just yet. LH will rocket jump with absorbed moonlight! -> 5. He crash lands.
* LH: "That went so much better in my head." A: "Want me to call someone?" LH: "Will pull in more moonlight, heal right through it!"
* A: "maybe don't use your powers now." LH: "Powers are part of me!" Dallas tries to heal up -> 10
* Alex: "You dead?" Headache slowly going away. LH: "Nope! I'm 100%"

# Back to Prom!

* Nick & Melody teleport back.
* Lucy & Grando were about to get into the seat where they teleported back to.
* G: "what were you two doing?" M: "Sitting down!"
* Nick gets a text from Lewis, "is the punch spiked?" Nick: "Hey Jeremy did you spike the punch." G: "Not yet." Nick: "Thanks" M: "Dallas said you're not supposed to do it." G: "Not at the start. you do it at the end." M: "Alcohol's bad for you!" G: "Ask your mom about that." M: "Fiona told me that! Also I don't have a mom, I have a Fiona." G: "ask your Fiona. You have a lot to learn." M: "You're not kidding!"
* Microphone whine, "is this thing on". It's Scott, president of Student Council. Dallas: "Woo, go Scott!"
* Grando: "that's my cue." Nick claps a hand on his shoulder. Grando: "I'm going." Nick: "after tonight, if anyone's drinking, it's me."
* G: "You want the bottle?" N: "Technically I have to say no, but don't spike the punch." Grando slinks away.
* Scott: "with an extremely weird number of votes, Nicholai Hel is our prom king."
  * Nick dodged a bullet by not holding onto the flask of alcohol...
* Scott: "will you come to the stage?" Nick: "What if I say no?" But he goes to the stage. Scattered applause, people being nice.
* Scott: "Nick Hel, everybody." Sign on the roof: "applaud". They applaud.
* They bring out a projector. Videos of Nick helping people. Vanya was recording and does voiceover. Testimonies! Scott: "anything to say about your good deed?" Nick: "happy to help?" Scott: "Good enough."
* Scott: "You can go now." Nick bolts from the stage.
* Prom queen: Amy Roosevelt! UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE. "So honored!" Fortunately there's no dance.
* Scott seems anxious to wrap things up at midnight with forced good cheer.
* Nick tries to track Amy down. She's being congratulated by rest of Sports Club
* Nick: waves. Amy: stares. Nick: "talk to you for a second?"
* Nick: "Seems like you are good person & like Eleanor." Amy: "Eleanor dumped me." Nick: "whatever happened, whatever is going to happen, wish you all the best." Amy: "you too..." Nick walks away.

## Afterparty

* Everyone's heading home at midnight.
* Where's Lewis? Walking around with Abby. Abby: "forgot my hoodie." Lewis: "we should go back & get that. Casual walking pace.
* Melody stays as long as the rest of the team stays.
* Lewis: "Hey Melody how's your night?" M: "Interesting question! Pretty good. And confusing. But pretty good." Lewis: "I get that." M: "Was yours the same?" L: "Pretty pleasant experience. Jeremy spiked the punch?" M: "Nick stopped him." L: (ohwell)
* M: "Where were you?" L: "Abby & I went out for a walk. Dancing's not our scene." M: "Oh! That's good." (It's normal to leave, I'm safe!)
* M: "How was your night Dallas?"
* L: "Know where we haven't been in awhile? Karaoke." M: "Is that where we're gonna meet tomorrow?" L: "How about an afterparty? Abby?" Abby: "Less karaoke, more junk food."
* Whole team is invited! (not Lewis going on a double date with Abby & Ayami). Grando, Lucy, Alex, Abby, and PCs
* karaoke place is closing, it's late. Official afterparty? Well-off kids rented some kind of venue.
* Dallas: "we could crash..." Nick: "NOPE"
* Lewis: "Movie night, Top Gun." Melody: "Movies!" Abby, Grando: "You're into Top Gun?" Lewis: "Cool movie." G: "I fucking love Top Gun." Lewis: "Greatest thing you ever said in your entire life." Lewis: "Abby?" Abby: "Too many guys"
* Alex: "let's go to my place." Lewis: "I see you two are going steady." M: "What's going steady?" L: "Dallex." M: "WTF" L: "It's a ship name" M: "I didn't know you had a boat." L: "Let's just leave that there."
* Dallas is furiously performing calculations in his head. It's not gonna go well so let's do it!
* Dallas texts mom: "Prom went really well. Bringing friends back with me." Mom: "Are they your friends?" D: "Yes!" Mom: Thumbs up.
* It's not like Dallas & Alex share a room. A bed, but not a room.
* How long is the walk from school to Dallas's house? Not very far. Bunch of snack foods around the living room. Door to mom's room is closed. Dallas: "Thanks mom, we'll try not to be too loud." Mom: heart!
