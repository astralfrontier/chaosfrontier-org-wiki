* LH: Everyone that fights me says you're not dangerous. Abby: Let's drop this before you kidnap me or something.
* Abby looks at Lewis. Z: they're a weird bunch but they're my friends..? A: You don't seem very positive. LH: he's just in shock.
* Z: Dallas, when's this movie coming up? LH: I don't have the remote. Z: I'll do it.

* Grando: we had to share a single bathroom, Alex was uh... Alex: (glares)  Grando: Alex was v. greedy with bathroom. One day Lucy-- Lucy: (tries to cover his mouth, Grando counters with superpowers) Grando: Lucy had a short bladder, Alex didn't want to get out, Lucy barged in, the rest is history.
* LH: That's not that embarrassing, Alex, that's pretty adorable. Alex: did you hear the same story? She saw me naked! LH: Yeah, but, y'know, not because of anything bad you did. All Lucy's fault!

* Alex wants to shift Mundane up, Superior down, Dallas accepts!
* LH: "Alright, Alex, I can do that. We can go back down & keep watching."
* Alex: "I want this like you do, but sometimes things don't go like the way you want. Sometimes they do. That's why we're being patient."

* Next day!
* Do Zephyr & Abby eat together? Probably not?
* We're in class! Bird lady (Madeleine) shows up at the classroom door, asks for Lewis.
* M: "You're about to meet my boss. He's eccentric, not evil. Has your best intentions in mind. He's extremely fucking weird."
* Lewis: "You don't work for Red Vox do you" M: "I said it was about your job." L: "What's your deal?" M: "I got you this promotion."

* The Director has appeared!
* Lewis texts rest of the team with situation
* Director: "You're Lewis West! Wonderful." Big forcible handshake. "You singlehandedly defeated Nightquake! You shouldn't be working with a small corporation against Sycamour." Lewis: "still in school, keeping it part time. Big leagues when I graduate."
* Director: "you can hit the big leagues & graduate at the same time. You can speed-read."
* Lewis: "don't want to leave my team behind." Director: "I get it. Madeleine here is my friend." Tries to shake M's hand, she backs the fuck down.
* Director: "they can still be your friends, but cut them as a team. Dude called the Mentor!"
* The salespitch: bring in the Mentor. LH: "I can bring him in fast." Director: "we don't know where he is."
* Lewis: "I don't feel ready for the big leagues right now. I need to decide what & who I'm doing this for."
* Director: "I know you're trying to figure things out, but Zephyrus saw you refusing to help our teams overcome the Mentor's plans, you think she would agree with that?" (+Danger -Savior)
* Zephyr rolls to reject influence -> 7, Cancels influence & takes +1 forward
* Director: "We get it, you don't feel ready, you won't be thrown into it, but Sycamour is small fry. We still need someone working on bigger cases."
* Lewis: "maybe work by commission sort of deal?"
* Director: "your contract said we can assign cases on a person-by-person basis. We'd rather have you work in teams, but sometimes we can arrange teams on our own. You don't have much choice."
* Lewis: "That is a really dirty move. We're close to cracking Sycamour open. Let us resolve things with them."
* Lewis: "Sycamour is hurting real people. I'm honoring Zephyrus by looking after them.". Provoke -> 9. Madeleine gives Director a glance, sighs (+1 Team). Director: "Okay. One month. Finish anything related to Sycamour. Bosses gone, minions in jail, plans foiled." Lewis: "absolutely."
* They had out. Madeleine stares at Zephyr for a few seconds, says nothing. Z: "Thanks."
* Lewis heads back to class.

## At Lunch!

* Z: Bird lady had me talk to the Director. They offered me a promotion!
* LH: That's great! Z: It'd mean leaving the team. LH: Thanks, I hate it.
* Z: We have a month. Melody: we can get it done! LH: Our next big enemy is Red Vox.
* Z: we should go 1:1 and take out high profile villains. M: Isn't a team supposed to work together? Z: if you want the best team, get the best parts.
* M: Nick is teaching me to resist mind control! Nick's a genius!
* Nick: taking people out 1:1 is good. You can make good PBJ from good ingredients, but nobody eats just bread or peanut butter. Let's prove that we work best as a team.
* Vanya is actually staring at Lewis for a bit completely bewildered
* Lewis pierces the mask on Vanya -> 7
  * What do you want to do? Brag about defeating Nightquake so she can write about it?
* Lewis tries to get Vanya's attention. She blinks & slowly goes back to eating food.
* M: what should we be doing? Lewis: do what we've been doing, but better?
* Do we have an airtight legal case to go bust Master of Puppets? Maaybe.
* Z: Ayami, is your identity a secret? Do people know Ayami is Melody? M: I don't tell people, but it's really obvious for some reason
* M: I'm good about not using my powers around people who don't know!
* Z: Go give an interview to the newspaper club. M: Uh, I guess..? both identities are a little famous. Aren't you the big hero? Z: I've got the publicity already. The rest of you deserve promotion. M: You want me to act like Dallas! Z: GOD ALMIGHTY NO.
* M: I've been following your advice and-- LH: Life has gotten better? M: I'm really confused but I'm trying! He talked about cake, but I understand his confusion!
* M: The whole question was very confusing and I'm confused. I'm not surprised he was confused! I don't blame anybody.
* Z: When I came here & found out Dallas's secret, he was using this weird metaphor about two chefs doing the work. absolute mess.
* LH: you need to see Ratattouie and it'll all make sense.
* Z: Don't be like Dallas. maybe just go over to Vanya & ask if she's interested in interviewing teen superhero Melody.
* M: One problem. Shouldn't I do something worth an interview? Nick: you kept Amy & Trish safe. M: Long time ago. Nick: does it matter? M: newspapers are about current events.
* Z: Make it a day-in-the-life thing. Not just what I did recently. M: how is that showing off? that sounds like a very Dallas plan? Z: OMG is this my first Dallas plan?
* Z: you want something you did significant recently.
* Nick: what's the most amazing thing you did recently?

## Nick and Melody confess

* Z: You two disappeared from prom recently. What happened there?
* M: I... I wanted to tell Nick about my plan for backup! LH: you guys were gone almost an hour, we talked about that for 10 minutes
* Nick: yeah but like she said, I was proposing an updated plan to immunize her against mind control!
* Z tries to pierce the mask -> 3. He totally buys this explanation.
* LH tries to pierce the mask -> 8. Nick contributes team, because he's a shitty liar.
  * How could I get your character to tell the truth? Put any sort of pressure
* Nick: we sorta spent some time talking about stuff. Melody: I mighta sorta broken some rules.
* Nick vomits forth the truth under cross-examination.
* Z: sounds like more than friends. M: I was suspicious about that. So how long are you supposed to hug your friends? Z: a few seconds? LH: I'm a long hugger. M: oh no, I want to know, what's your time limit? LH: subjective. however feels long enough? M: on average, what would that be? N: how long do you hug Alex for? LH: what are you doing to me here, Nick?
* lewis (and player) steps OOC
* LH: Alex and I haven't hugged. N: Don't you like them? LH: there's this thing with waiting. Nick: so you're like me. LH: not alike, because you're not me.
* M: all I have to say is Alex is missing out, hugs are great. LH: that's a compelling argument. Alex respectfully declined. M: who turns down hugs? What a monster.
* LH: it's not a permanent situation, Alex used to be villain. Nick: I don't want to hug you. M: I'll hug you, Dallas! (does so!) Nick times it. 30-45 seconds.
* LH: your instincts are good. Nick, come hug me too. (Nick does so) 2 seconds. LH: that was a little fast. Nick: don't want to take anything away from alex. M: you're pretty good at hugging, but sorry, Nick's better. (Nick beams)
* LH: Ayami, are you saying Nick is a better hugger, or you enjoyed the hug more because it was from Nick?
* M: Uh... that's a good question... probably because it was from Nick? LH: Interesting! Nick: I enjoyed it too.
* LH: feels like we're answering a lot of questions. That you two could have answered.
* M: I came up with a lot of questions without you! LH: you didn't answer them without me. Nick: we answered a few.
* LH: I should't be most emotionally competent person on this team. M: everyone's gotta be good at things
* Nick: I just didn't want to talk about a private situation. M: I was confused. Z: you don't get privacy with us.
* M: I'm glad we're all friends. I appreciate you guys. Z: we appreciate you too. Nick: no matter what Red Vox does, or we do, that'll always be true.
* M: Lewis, hug Dallas! L: Dallas, stand up. (Clasp handshake - bring arm in - fist bump)
* That was a pretty involved hug. LH: it's like wrestling. M: it's a wrestling hug? Nick: Alex doesn't want to get between you too. LH: Alex doesn't have to get between wrestling hugs. Z: Want to do the bro hug? M: I am so bro! Z: Bring it in! M: (bro hug!)
* Nick: raises one more question, Dallas. Where did Alex sleep last night? LH: still in my room. We're still really good friends. Still a sense of loyalty there.
* Z: I have the most normal relationship. Nick: you danced with Abby? Z: Yep. Nick: you gonna keep y'know, dancing with her? Z: If there's any more proms in the near future. Nick: are you gonna ask her out. Z: I dunno. Maybe?
* Nick: a lot of people don't ask you what they want. I just think what you want should be heard. Z: You guys raise some good points. Nick: if you need help with anything or need Dallas kept away, let me know. LH: I only make things better!
* LH: I got him talking to Abby! Nick: how? LH: don't want to talk about it.
* M: I followed your advice from the mall onward & it worked out! Even if you made some of it up.
* LH: I made all of it up! M: Really? LH: Probably. I just make up advice & follow it.
* Nick: Ayami was confused by all the stuff that happened. What's your advice for her?
* LH: My advice is to do what feels right. M: Okay!
* LH: ask yourself what feels right. Feels right to hug? M: What I was going to do! (gives Nick a hug)
* LH: I'm the team genius!
* Nick: I approve.
* LH: I have two converts! You're next, Lewis.
* Z: I just realized, I'm needed back in Australia
