# Training to Resist Reprogramming

When she signed up for training to resist mind control, she didn't quite know what she signed up for, but she was determined to make it work.  It had to work.  She couldn't let herself become a villain.  She walked into the gym.  At this point she was pretty much a regular here, after all the dance lessons she gave.  "Now _I'm_ the student."

"Good to see you, Ayami," Nick greeted her with a smile.

"Hi Nick!  I'm ready to get started," she responded with a matching smile.  Briefly, she noted he had been calling her Aya and then stopped, but didn't comment aloud on that observation.

"Okay, so what we're going to do is that I'm going to try to mind control you into doing very neutral tasks that you shouldn't have strong feelings about doing or not doing.  For example," he motions to a stack of books piled on the floor, "I'm going to try to command you to pick up one of these books, and you're going to try to resist the compulsion."

"So I just have to try to do nothing?"

"Yes.  I know it sounds simple, but when someone is psychically trying to control your mind, it isn't easy to do nothing."

Ayami nods.  "All right. I'm ready to do nothing!"

Fifteen seconds later, she found herself staring at a copy of To Kill a Mockingbird, its weight in her left hand evident.  "Maybe I should rephrase that," she said, "I'm ready to attempt to do nothing.  I'll do better next time!"

Sixteen seconds later, she found herself staring at a copy of Lord of the Flies in her right hand.  "Well, I did do better," she commented brightly.  "This is really hard, but that's to be expected."

"It is," Nick agreed, "but let's talk about what you're doing and see if we can figure out a way to make this easier for you.  I could just keep repeating this, but it might help if you have a plan for how you want to train."

"Yeah.  Right now I'm just trying not to do anything."

"What are you thinking about while you're trying not to do anything, though?  Do you have a picture or a feeling you're using as a focus?  My powers work off feelings so that's what I use to focus, but you don't have to use feelings; you can use anything that seems to work best for you, but having a focus of some sort might make things easier, something that you can think about when you're trying to resist someone trying to control you."

Ayami puts a finger to her lips and taps three times in thought.  "Oh, I know!  I can think about what my savestate looked like!  And since I have light powers, I can use a solid light barrier to protect it so no one can get through!"

"Okay!  Yes, that's good!  You should try doing that this time and see if it helps you.  I'm going to try again, okay?  Keep that image in your mind and try as hard as you can to resist."

A full 45 seconds later, Ayami has a copy of The Odyssey in her left hand.  "It was easier that time!  In the end I still picked up the book, but it seemed like it was better."

"It WAS better," Nick's tone was excited, tinged with the slightest undertone of relief.  He wasn't sure this plan was going to work, so seeing any type of progress was encouraging.  "This is going to work, Ayami; we just have to practice this for a while.  It might not be easy, but I know you can learn this."

"I'm GOING to learn this," Ayami replied definitively.  "I don't care how long it takes as long as you're willing to spend the time to train with me.  I am NOT going to become a villain, and I am going to do anything I can to put a stop to it."  Rarely was she so serious.  Her blue eyes were steeled with resolve, and her lips were pressed together in a hard line.  The tension in her stance was obvious; even without using his powers, he could feel her determination.
"I am willing to help you with this no matter how long it takes, Ayami.  You have the right to choose, and I am going to help you protect that right for yourself."

"Thank you, Nick."

"You've gotten a lot stronger, Ayami."  Several hours had passed.  Ayami's visualization abilities had improved very quickly, and Nick was reminded of Zephyr's comments that she picked up on games and other things she was shown at an uncommonly fast pace.  "Let's try again."

"Wait... I have a question."

"Sure, what's the question?"

"What happens if I try to set up my defenses like a security system?  Where there's a backlash to someone trying to break through the system, like an electric shock?"

"That's an interesting idea.  It could work.  Let's try it.  Let me know when you're ready."

"Okay, I'm ready," Ayami said, closing her eyes, visualizing the solid light barrier she had become accustomed to seeing mentally and channeling some of her power through it.

Nick reached out with the suggestion to her mind, as he had been doing all day.  This time his target would be the copy of Treasure Island and... his thought came to an abrupt halt as he saw an image of an Ayami made of pure diamond appearing in his mind's eye.  Before he could fully process what was happening, her fist connected, slamming with a shocking ferocity through his mind and sending him reeling.  His eyes widened as he exclaimed "Ouch!" reflexively.

Ayami's sapphire eyes widened in surprise.  "Nick!  Oh my god, are you okay??"  She rushed over, the exercise forgotten.

"Yeah, I'm okay; just... surprised.  I guess it worked."  He turned to look at her.  "Whatever you just did, that's what you have to practice.  That's exactly right."

"Didn't that hurt you?"

Nick hesitated.  For a moment, he considered trying to lie to her.  "If I tell her the truth, she isn't going to want to do it anymore."  His eyes met hers.  "But I can't lie to her."

"It did, didn't it?"  It was less of a question and more of a statement.

"Yes.  It hurt," he admitted, "but you have to do it anyway, Ayami.  You have to keep going!"

"I don't want to---" she began, but Nick cut her off.

"You don't want to hurt me, I know," he said, a slight edge to his voice.  "I know," a softness entered his voice with the repetition, "but I also know you don't want to be reprogrammed.  And I don't want that, either.  Neither do Lewis or Dallas."

"...I know.  You're... you're right, Nick.  Being reprogrammed would mean I would become everything I never want to become... and I would lose everything I cared about..."  Conflicting emotions warred in her eyes, with fear being the momentary victor.

"And we can make sure that doesn't happen, but we have to keep going.  You have to keep pushing your limit."

"If I was in your position... I would tell me to keep going, too," Ayami admits softly.  "If I thought I could save someone by dealing with some temporary pain, I would do it.  And I don't want to be a villain."  She's quiet for a moment, and then seemed to reach a decision.  "I'll keep going.  Just... please promise me that you'll tell me to stop if I'm going to seriously hurt you, all right?  I don't want to be a villain on accident, either..."

"I promise."

"And... I'm sorry in advance for the pain...," she winces.

"Don't think about that.  It'll ruin your concentration.  I'll be fine."  He smiles.  "You've made good progress.  Don't hold back, all right?"

"Okay," she agreed, a slight smile teasing the corners of her mouth, "I trust you."

"Ayami, what have you been doing this week?" Fiona arched an eyebrow and looked up at Ayami from her leather chair positioned in front of a desk.  A laptop sat in front of her, and she pointed to the screen.  "Your weekly diagnostics are out of line with your usual readings today."

"Oh, uh, I've been training!  Do the scans show my training is working?" Ayami rushed over to the terminal, excitedly looking over Fiona's shoulder.

"There are alterations to your security system and not in a way I recognize," Fiona commented, half to herself.  "What kind of training is this, exactly?"

Ayami couldn't help but beam.  "Psychic training to resist mind control!  I did a great job today!  I went from picking up a book in 15 seconds to being able to outright refuse to do it!"

"...And your teammates are teaching you this?  None of your teammates are technology oriented in their powers, I didn't think?"

"They aren't, but I still have a mind, you know, even if I'm not a human," Ayami pointed out.

"That's... true..." Fiona agreed slowly, considering her words carefully, "but I don't think your teammates fully understand the intricacies of my brother's programming.  Truth be told, I don't either, and I don't think they should be altering code they don't understand.  There's a reason the program is written the way it is.  I recommend waiting until Kieran is released from prison and discuss an upgrade package for you the way he would have intended."

"Fiona, I can't wait that long.  I need to be able to protect myself now," Ayami asserted firmly.  "I can't wait for Kieran to do it for me.  Who knows when he'll ever be out."  She paused slightly, "...or if he's a villain.  I'm not sure I trust him with my program anymore," she added silently to herself.  "By the time he could work on an upgrade for me, it might be too late.  Besides, none of my teammates would ever do anything that would hurt me."

"I'm sure they would never want to hurt you, Ayami, but that doesn't mean that they couldn't hurt you on accident.  I'm just looking out for your safety.  This training might not be safe."

"I would rather take the risk to do something to try to protect myself rather than sit around and be afraid that something's going to happen to me.  I'm a hero, Fiona.  I take risks all the time trying to protect others.  If something happened to me where someone reprogrammed me to be a villain, I would be trying to hurt other people.  This training doesn't just protect me, it protects other people from the consequences of what would happen if I became a bad guy.  And my job as a hero is to protect people.  In this case, that includes protecting myself.  That's worth taking the risk."  Ayami's stance was determined as she stared into Fiona's gray eyes.

Fiona met her gaze levelly.  "Are you sure other parts of your mind aren't being altered while you're working on these security measures?"
"Of _course_ other parts of my mind aren't being altered!  I hope you're not trying to imply that he's some sort of supervillain who would alter things about my mind!  Nick would never do anything to my mind without my permission!  Ever."  The outburst came spilling out almost before Fiona could even finish her sentence.

"I... wasn't trying to imply he was, Ayami," Fiona responded, slightly surprised at the vehemence.

"Okay.  Good.  Sorry, Fiona.  I guess I got a little upset for no reason," Ayami chirped brightly, her pleasant demeanor returning immediately.

"It's okay, Ayami.  Just... be careful, okay?" Fiona smiled back at her.  "Why don't you set the table for dinner?"

"Okay!"  Agreeably nodding, Ayami skipped off toward the kitchen.

Fiona turned her attention back toward the screen and began to muse aloud.  "The scans show a lot of discrepancy in your emotional programming at the moment, Ayami.  Intentional or not, someone is having an effect in that part of your system.  This code is a mess."  She sighed, "and with the way you reacted to me even trying to bring up the topic, I have no doubt you aren't going to want to talk to me about it."  Shutting the laptop, Fiona started to walk in the direction of the kitchen.  "That team of yours had better take good care of you.  Or they'll be hearing from me."
