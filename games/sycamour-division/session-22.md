# Session 22 (2019-09-28)
Zephyr's player is out today
## Ayami talks to Alex!
* Ayami wants to run into Alex on the way out of school! She runs into Alex & Dallas together
* M: "Hi!" LH: "Just saw you 10 minutes ago. Did you follow us?" "Yes!"
* M: "Want to borrow Alex!" A: "It's my turn to be borrowed." Dallas heads home
* A: "What was up with lunch?" M: "What I wanted to talk to you about! How was rest of prom?"
* A: "You know. Dallas nearly broke his neck trying to jump with powers of the moon." M: "Did you get video?" A: "Nope, I'm dumb."
* M: "Glad your night was good. Mine was confusing. What's your stance on hugs?"
* A: "They're nice? Why?" M: "Would you hug me?" Alex hugs Melody! Melody gives it 30 seconds.
* A: "What was that about?" M: "I broke hug rules, but there aren't exactly rules, but sort of are. Dallas is disappointed you two haven't hugged. But you can hug me, and Dallas is friend too, so you'd be okay hugging Dallas, right?"
* A: "He didn't say anything to me about hugging." M: "???"
* A: "I think I know what's up, but Dallas might not want you to know." M: "You don't have to tell me. Maybe talk to Dallas about it." A: "Yeah. I'll do that."
* M: "What's it like living with Dallas?" A: "He's a slob but it's nice."
* M: "Favorite part of living there?" A: "The food. I get full meals, not scraps." M: "Don't you all eat together?" A: "Mom doesn't know I'm there." M: "Is that hard?" A: "Phasing makes hiding easy."
* M: "Is it like big game of hide and seek?" A: "I'm the best player at it."
* A: "Sometimes you want to be found, running's fun." M: "ever been seen?" A: "I couldn't." M: "Don't want to get in trouble." A: "Not with Dallas's mom"
* M: "What's the hardest part of living there?" A: "Definitely hiding. It's annoying." M: "Doesn't it get boring after awhile?" A: "Got boring when Caesar was Romanus, but you guys found us." M: "Glad I could find you then! Must have been terrible, glad it worked out." A: "Caesar's still out there, doesn't have his powers."
* M: "That might happen to me. I could be reprogrammed, I have a plan not to be, so I'm less worried." A: "You started out as a nice person. There'd still be a trace of you." M: "Thank you. You're really nice too." A: "Thanks. I don't hear that too much." M: "You should! I know why Dallas is friends with you, you're great!"
* M: "If I was Dallas & thought you didn't want to hug me, I'd be sad too!" A: "Dallas is getting away. Might have to go seek him" M: "You'll be fine, he's the least subtle person I know! But that's a good thing!" A: "Yeah, because he's not the one under the bed."
* M: "Don't humans usually sleep on top of beds?" A: "You don't have a bed?" M: "I just recharge in a chair." Alex makes Baymax comparison.
* M: "but humans sleep on top of the bed?" A: "I don't because I'm hiding." M: "Is that uncomfortable?" A: "It's terrible." M: "not good! did you tell Dallas you're uncomfortable" A: "Nowhere else I can sleep, except the closet or something." M: "I don't know much about sleeping but maybe something else could work out? I don't want someone else to be uncomfortable around me. I'd try to fix something else!"
* A: "You get used to it. I had to clean out under the bed when I got there." M: "he didn't clean it for you?" A: "he tried." M: "Dallas, why?"
* M: "If you don't want to tell him these things, I can tell him!" A: "better if you didn't." M: "I can tell anyone anything!" A: "I should catch up to him to tell him how I feel about hugs."
* M: "here's my number if you want to text me!" A: "Never got a girl's number before." (wink, giggle)
## Alex hugs Dallas!
* On the way home, Dallas is tackled to the ground by Alex. Dallas's head wound opens up from hitting the ground.
* D: "You're way too strong. I'm a superhero." A: "More like super-weakling. You're always bleeding." D: "Nice one, Alex, you really got me."
* Dallas absorbs sunlight to heal himself.
* Alex hugs! D: "what's that for?" A: "A little bird told me you thought I didn't want to hug you."
* D hems and haws. A: "It's fine, I do want to hug you." D: "Okay then! I'm alright with that."
* Hug goes on for too long, gets uncomfortable? Dallas notices he has arms.
* Alex phases before Dallas lets go
* Alex: "you don't have to hide from me. Just tell me stuff." D: "Still stuff I have to hide in my bedroom. But for the most part yeah"
* A: "better get going to the house?" D: "we don't have to, we could go hang out somewhere. I don't like making you hide all the time." A: "Not having to hide would be pretty great." D: "Supposed to be doing superhero stuff in a couple hours. Until then..?"
* A: "I'll do the hero stuff with you!" D: "Sounds good! Zephyr might have something else going on right now anyway. And we're a four-person team, so..." A: "you need someone who can phase. I do it better." D: "Zephyr's really fragile."
## Superhero stuff!
* Dallas texts the team: "who do we take down tonight? Master of Puppets, Marlum, Cockroach King?"
* Ayami: "Sure what time?" Nick: "Yeah" Dallas: (texts a picture of him already in costume, Alex photobombing) "Right now!"
* Dallas has spare masks, but Alex wants Sycamour to see their face. Alex: "??" Dallas: "Mask got destroyed rescuing you three from the van." Frozen and unconscious.
* Ayami has asked Nick to help with training. Nick: "Yeah, let's get this done."
* We have until tomorrow before MoP is going after Hans, so we can get the jump on him today!
* Nick will ask Anna: can we bust MoP for anything outstanding? Yes, we have enough evidence.
* We head to Factory #2. Most of the stuff is fixed. Some walls are busted, entrance doors are gone. Holes in the ceiling patched up with wood.
* How do we recon? Nick suggests Alex phase in safely. Nick assesses -> 6!
* Alex disarms most of the turrets! Suddenly Nick gets a sharp migraine, telepathic bond with Alex is severed. Can't telepathically locate him.
* N: "We should go in there" D: "It's hero time!" Dallas smashes through a wall! -> 7, Dallas marks Guilty for sending Alex in all alone. Only bits of wall in the corners are left. LASERFORCE!
* LH: "You see that? I did that." M: "I don't see a wall any more!" N: "I don't see Alex either, let's keep going."
* Nick will lead the way, retracing Alex's steps. Burns! -> 8, marks Angry, spend 1 hold on Moat to block any telepathic influences.
* Halfway in, we find disabled turrets. Remember that one robot? There's three of them.
* Nick: "You two take them out, I'll watch your backs!"
* Enter battle as a team! Nick is leading, has influence, purpose is "Rescue Alex", +4 team!
* Dallas hammers the robot heading toward Nick! -> 14, resist/avoid, impress/surprise opposition. Dallas wants MoP to see this & be intimidated: "You see that? We're coming for you! I'm gonna do that to your whole body."
* Dallas destroys two robots in a single shot.
* Melody creates a hammer of light and takes out the remaining robot! -> 10, resist/avoid, take something from them (connection with Master of Puppets)

## The Showdown
* MoP is one floor up. Holding a mental shield is getting harder, Nick spends another burn. (1 left)
* We arrive at the destination. There's no real opposition though, what's going on?
* At 10 feet from the closed door. Nick still can't feel Alex.
* Is the signal coming from here? Not sure, but we should go in anyway.
* Can the bad guys sense us? Nick doesn't know, but assumes so.
* M: "Make a dramatic entrance from somewhere else?" Ventilation system? Yes.
* Does Dallas check out the situation or just burst in? Lift the vent grate, peek in - the cautious approach. Assess the situation -> 13
  * what here is in the greatest danger? Dallas specifically because of sticky bombs planted to the sides of the air vents
  * what here can I use to disarm the bombs? no tripwires, probably remote detonation
  * Alex is in the room, unconscious, can't see their head
  * How close is MoP to Alex? Alex on one side of the room, Alex unconscious on the other
* Dallas will smack bombs over to MoP! -> 7, marks Angry. MoP instinctively triggers the bombs but they go off in his face. He's not knocked out or killed, but there's a lot of smoke.
* Dallas hops out of the vent, everyone in!
* Dallas heads toward Alex, head bumps into an invisible wall. Dallas will blast through! -> 11. Shattering sound, can't touch Alex's head though
* MoP is recovering, has something in his hand. M: "Drop it or you're going to be really sorry!" MOP: "Gladly." he drops item near his feet. It's a remote with a big red button. He steps on the big red button.
* Suddenly armor pieces start flying toward MoP - an Iron Man type suit!
* Nick telekinetically controls part of the armor pieces to pin MoP against the wall -> 13
* Part of the armor is a rocket punch at Melody & Nick! Melody tries to intercept -> 15, add team to the pool
* Melody: "That's not what I meant when I said drop it!" MoP: "but I did drop it!"
* Nick spends last burn on Worship to squeeze the armor, getting MoP's attention.
## Bathsheba
* Laser Hawk checks out Alex. There's something in front of him - distortion in the air. There's a curse on Alex! LH tries to figure it out -> 9. Nick pushes the telepathic shield a bit more, +1 team -> 10
  * What here can I use to end the effect on Alex? Hit the squiggly line in the air
  * Who here is most vulnerable to me? Squiggly line person
* Dallas is gonna hit the invisible person real hard! -> 9. Melody is still holding onto the rocket punch, lets it go toward the figure, +1 team. Resist/avoid, take away invisibility.
* It's Bathsheba! She goes flying, hits the wall. "That's not gonna help you."
* Melody will go over to Bathsheba, MoP feels like it's under control? But as Melody approaches her, her body starts to flicker! Take a powerful blow -> 7, marks Afraid and Insecure

* Melody keeps going, Burn! -> 10. Hold 3. Spend 1 to move next to Bathsheba. "Don't know what you think you're doing but it's not going to work!" Provoke -> 8. Dallas sucks light out of the room into his fists, +1 team. Nick squeezes MoP to get more groaning and pain, this is what we'll do to you! +1 team

![](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/b/bc/Dragon-Ball-Super-Episode-92-000093-Caulifla-Super-Saiyan.jpg)

* Bathsheba books it, tries to grab Master of Puppets.
* Nick gets in telepathic control of Melody, gives her control of his powers.
* Using a combination of Nick's powers and her own hard-light to fill in the missing pieces, Melody tears the armor off MoP and traps Bathsheba! Spends 2 burn on a 10+ result. "You trapped me in darkness, I'm trapping you in a world of light"
* When the first armor piece (glove) lands on her, she stands completely still. She allows herself to be entombed by it.
* MoP has given up. Bathsheba is still in the armor (Melody makes sections transparent). She's looking up at the roof. Melody continues applying force to keep her from getting away.
* Dallas: "Nick, text your mom." Dallas checks Alex's status. Black bar covering their face is starting to fade, but not complete.
* Dallas walks back over to Bathsheba. "Whatever you're doing, cut it out, or I'll ask my friend to remove that armor and hit you in the head."
* Alex becomes visible, is unconscious. Dallas will try to bring Alex around, but it's not working. Dallas breaks the outer wall to get more light, but they aren't coming around.
* Melody peels open a bit more opening to talk to Bathsheba. Dallas: "Fix my friend right now." No response. Melody: "Fix Alex." Nothing.
* Nick tries to reach her mind - is it still in her body? Unleash -> 9, Melody is sharing powers +1 team. There's nothing there, her body is an empty shell.
* Three floaty dealies were nearby, now fly away extremely quickly. Too fast for Dallas.
## Post-Fight
* There's something affecting Alex's mind still. Nick focuses everything on breaking the influence -> 13
* Alex will wake up in a couple hours. Nick plucked some kind of influence off Alex's mind, now studies it. Like a Jojo's flesh bud, but psychic.
* Nick: "Let's stop here, Alex comes first." We'll be prepared for them next time.
* Melody is really mad! Dallas too. But we're gonna get whoever that was.
* Suddenly, a lot of sirens.
* We should angle for a promotion.
* Nick: "We should be proud. We took 25% of Sycamour out in one day." Mutual praise for the team.
* Cops are approaching. Nick: "Red Vox superteam in here! We're unarmed except for a hammer."
* Cops: "why is this guy unconscious?" Melody: "He's a villain." Detective Hel arrives, vouches for us.
* Alex will be okay. Melody: "if you take them home, don't put them under the bed. we had a really good talk!"
* we group text Marlone & the Director about the arrest. Marlone: "don't let the cops take MoP to jail, he won't last long." Nick tells Anna. She runs for it, then returns, dragging MoP. Nick: "we promise to be accountable for him." Anna: "if not you're grounded." Discussion of conditions of being grounded for letting villains escape.
* We teleport to Marlone's office. He's making coffee. He sees us, screams, tosses coffee, it lands on MoP. He starts screaming. Melody knocks out MoP.
* Marlone: "tell me next time!" Nick: "mom was gonna ground me, there was some urgency." Marlone Mage Hands him down to confinement.
* Marlone: "this is going smoothly. I'm proud of you." Dallas: "how proud?" M: "would have been easier with Zephyr."
* Marlone can put in a good word with us with the Director, but can't do much else about the Zephyr situation
* Karaoke!
* Melody will say thank you to Nick for the power assist. Nick: "strong feeling, good or bad, is fuel for my powers." M: "Thanks for trusting me!" Nick: "I always trust you."
## Team Moves
* Nick: "Melody, when you had my powers, did you feel more afraid?" Nope! (+1 potential)
* Melody: "What was the best part of today?" Nick: "we moved as a team, we were all on the same page."
* Nick: "You charged in like you always do." Dallas: "Felt like Dallas made more of the decisions than Laser Hawk during that mission. It got personal with Alex. Don't know if Alex should be on future missions." Nick: "You need to be both. For a mission like this, maybe you needed to be Dallas, because that's where that fuel comes from."
* Melody: "You're both the same person." Dallas: "are they? I have to be more responsible as Dallas - but as LH too I guess." M: "Lot of really confusing things."
* Nick: "my mom knows who I am. There's a reason your mom does't know who you are?" LH: "I guess. I don't understand why I'm doing it. If it's like this, maybe I should be like you, embrace who I am." M: "I think who you are is really great. You're both really great. But you should be who you are. No good reason not to be, right?"
* D: "who am I though?" M: "One of my best friends."
* Nick: "Like Lewis & Ayami, you have the soul of a superhero. Whether you understand it doesn't matter." LH: "That's what I always wanted to me." M: "And you're good at it!"
* M: "I gotta train harder. She might not have gotten away if I wasn't prepared." LH: "You're being too hard on yourself. You were impressive today!" M: "Just copied Nick really." Nick: "We need to step up your telepathic resistance training." M: "Was pretty scary. It worked out, but if I hadn't prepared at all, it'd go worse."
* Nick: "everybody did good." LH: "We're the greatest superhero team of all time." M: "You must be right because you're a genius! Today at lunch!" Best team ever!
* Karaoke!
