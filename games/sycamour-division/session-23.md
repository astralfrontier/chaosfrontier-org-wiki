# Session 23 (2019-10-12)
* Master of Puppets is in jail! One of the team is a superstar
* Some time passes... (wink wink) Time for moves!
* Dallas -> 9, Lewis spends team by doing homework
* Lewis has a sanctuary! A library or archive of all the previous speed force users, a record of their lives written automatically, going back to the time of Achilles. A pocket dimension or demi-plane. Access requires specific application of speedster powers
## Vanya Interviews...
* The team minus Lewis?
* Vanya already knows our secret identities
* We're all being interviewed. In costume. Lewis is sitting back & eating popcorn.
* Melody approaches Vanya. Vanya had a great day! Valley girl Jennifer is rich, V is excited about that.
* Melody: "how would you like to interview four heroes?" V: "Your friends?" Yep, at the karaoke place!
* Vanya's already there no matter how early we get there. Normally people are this early only for dates.
* M: "Wait a minute. Are you and Vanya on a date?" LH: "Definitely no." M: "You're both here early!" LH: "I don't want to be here." M: "What kind of sense does that make?" LH: "So I can't talk myself out of not coming."
* LH: "Just go in, I'll follow." M: "Are you ashamed to be seen with me?" Some negotiation on here vs. there and whether Dallas is down for this
* LH tells an obvious lie about getting a cell phone call. M: "Feels like a prank but I'm not laughing."
* Zephyr is _there_ but hasn't shown up. Seeing Dallas being reluctant, he carries him into the room.
* LH: "just got the recipe for cake on this call." M: "You clearly don't know anything about cake."
* Nick teleports into the karaoke room in the middle of all this. N: "Did someone say cake?" M: "LH did! He's trying to learn!" LH: "heat and pressure...?" Discussion of locks & latches on oven. M: "Don't put Alex in your oven like under the bed!" LH: "They could phase out!"
* Nick: "What's the fastest way out of this conversation?"
* V: "You always do this?" LH: "Mostly punch stuff." M: "Only when LH brings up cake." V: "I'll not mention the topic of cake." LH: "You mentioned cake, now we have to talk about it--" N: "No we don't"
### Factory Attack
* V: "Let's talk about factory attack. Master of Puppets." N: "Which time?" V: "most recent." We're pretty regular customers for factories and MOP. LH: "Is he our nemesis?"
* V: "What made the fight special this time?" N: "We busted him this time." V: "What was the problem?" Nick rambles on about rockets, power armor suits. M: "He was stapled to a wall." V: "How'd that happen?" M: "Nick stapled him to the wall." Nick celebrates Melody's part, brings up Bathsheba.
* Nick: "Bathsheba had a psychic escape pod." M: "Rocket in her brain." Nick: "her ghost fell out."
* V: "I'm just gonna move on." M: "Stapled to the wall, punches in the face, those are the key things."
* V: "How'd you get there?" M: "LH broke the wall, we destroyed robots with hammers, it was BYOH, Nick protected us from the psychic, we went in through ventilation system, that's a hero thing to do!"
* V: "How'd you find the factory?" M, LH: "we did research. Multiple reliable sources." M: "I did an Internet search." LH: "We're professional superheroes. Just like Zephyr. Who is an A-lister."
* V: "Why isn't Zephyr here?" LH: "It's weird of you to assume he's not here." Does Dallas have a hoodie on? Yes, he has 6-7 hoodies, reversible for Dallas/LH modes. Zephyr pulls the hood over his head while invisible.
* Vanya looks at Nick, Nick shakes his head
* V: "Melody, any possibility Master of Puppets could have controlled you?" M: O_O
* M: "Maybe at some point, not any more!" V: "Ever plan for that?" M: "Yes! I've been training! I won't let it happen to me!" V: "Elaborate" M: "Nick was covering us on the way up, while there I was prepared, I strengthened my own mental powers, I can prevent my code from being interfered with! I can't affect someone mentally but can protect myself."
### Bathsheba
* V: "talk about the injured person in the fight?" N: "MoP bombed himself?" LH: "Another hero that was there." V: "They okay?" LH: "Yep!" V: "Want to talk about it?" LH: "No comment."
* V: "Your powers are unstable, why didn't things blow up at the factory?" Nick: "I went in with a purpose." V: "This time you didn't damage much." Nick: "Thanks? Maybe it was more telepathic vs. telekinetic this time"
* V: "Did you know about Bathsheba?" N: "No." V: "Did you plan?" N: "oh no." LH, M: "Plan went to hell, we adapted." LH: "We're A-listers!"
* V: "What about the dead person?" LH: "Just a moment". Team confers. Nick felt life, but not personhood or presence. Nick: "Vanya, very good question, we're gonna investigate."
* LH: "Is she trying to trap us?" Nick: "If she wanted to do that, she'd ask about our love lives." M: "Why would that make us look bad?" N: "short version is, she's not trying to trip us up." LH: "Should we tell her we mistrust our bosses?"
* Nick: "Vanya, why do you say this?" A bunch of news articles talking about MoP & a dead person. Articles are about 10 hours old, pretty recent. LH: "We're on Google, that's A-list stuff!" M: "That many hits is a good sign!"
### Other interview questions
* V: "A hero's life is popular & flashy. How does that impact your social life?" Nick: "my life is neither." V: "You must have some admirers" N: "I have people who hate me" LH: "Nemeses? Nemesii?" M: "People must like us, what?" LH: "Fan club?" M: "Always been a hero, I dunno" Nick: "fan club that doesn't announce themselves are just stalkers." LH: "should be worried about that."
* V: "LH about your mask, have people seen your face?" LH: "It's all mask all the way through." M: "I had to make you a new mask!" does LH have a real face?
* N: "Behind Laser Hawk's mask is Justice." V: "Are you blind?" LH: "Justice is blind but it can see so much while doing the right thing!" V: "Very inspiring."
* V: "Do any of your (collective) friends know?" M: "Everybody knows." Nick: "My mask is practical, comes with energy, not just to hide my face." V: "If I handed you my phone..?" 
* What's Vanya's phone got on it? Nick can see thoughts, including that of Vanya. She's thinking about the interview. V: "Well?" Nick: "think of something not related to the interview." V is thinking of the worst thing imaginable, which is cake. Nick: "Cake?" LH: "Cake?" M: "why did you say that?" LH: "Our team is a lot like cake, rising to the challenge, holding together the team, the sugar for the sweetness..the eggs... What was I saying?" Nick: "you're baked."
* Nick: "V, what's the question you want to ask us?" and watches thoughts. Something about what parents think?
* Nick: "Everyone on this team has parents that don't understand what their kids are doing, but try to be supportive in their own way?" V: "Don't they think it's dangerous?" Nick: "Yeah, but as parents, you have to accept that your kids are gonna do their own thing." V: "Isn't that too early?" Nick: "when is the right time?" V: "Dunno." M: "I'm a durable 16 year old!" V: "Are you even 16?" M: "depends on who you ask." Explanation of variable age. V: "I'll keep that in mind."
* Lewis (maybe): "makes your relationship with Nick weird"
* LH: "My parents love that I'm a superhero." V: "Don't they think it gets dangerous?" LH: "No." V: "They think it's safe?" LH: "Yes." LH tries to tell the biggest lie in the world -> 9

* LH: "Well what do your parents think about you being a reporter?" -> 12
  * How can I get influence over Vanya? Promise she can get more interviews
  * What are you really planning? Sell this interview to the highest bidder
  * How can I get Vanya to present us as A-list heroes? Bribe her

* LH: "Give us a second." V: "Sure."
* LH: "She's corrupt. We could get a story super easy. .. Nick can you explain this?" N: "I don't know what are you talking about." LH: "Give her what she wants - more interviews, more sensationalism, exaggeration..?" Nick: "we could just tell her what we normally do."
* LH: "Just got to be a big enough story." M: "?" Nick: "So you want us to lie." LH: "No, but... I don't want the team to split up." Nick: "tell her about the team that wants to stay together, that works for questionable employers, that is taking down Sycamour"
* Nick: "Let's just keep telling her the truth"
* Vanya returns with drinks. Not sure what to do with Melody's. V: "Can you drink that?" M: "Yep!" V: "how does that work?" Melody shrugs. Temperature doesn't matter, but Melody can taste!
* Nick asks for Vanya's phone back. Want to ask you a question & get a truthful answer. Nick: "what can we as heroes do to help you & make your life better?" Vanya wants to move into a less childish position - no school reporter, or detective. LH will text Vanya's number & goals to Superbug. Nick marks Influence!
## Et Tu, Brutey Call
* Alex texts Dallas: can you come over?  D: On the way!
* Zephyr: Caesar was found in some slums, held captive by some kind of Sycamour lackey
* M: "What about LH?" Z: "For us, duty calls. For him, booty calls." M: "what's that mean?" Z: "you'll understand when you're older."
* Mom is home! Alex is hanging out under Dallas's bed as usual
* Dallas: "mom, I left my radio on, in case you heard any noises. But if you did, that's why." Mom: "I didn't hear anything." Dallas: "guess I turned the volume down."
* Mom: "where were you?" D: "Pizza and karaoke place with friends." Mom: "so you're back now? Do dishes." D: "Heather can do dishes!" Mom: "she's too little." D: some bullshit.
* In the bedroom, Alex says "check this out". D: "is this the goats screaming video? You've tricked me so many times."

> ?- Could you tell me who Caesar Lilac is to you?
> A- what
> A- who are you
> ?- I just want to knowwho Caesar Lilac is to you, and what he means to you.

* Alex: "this guy randomly contacted me"
* Dallas will send this to Superbug. Is it safe to reply? Maaaybe.
* D: "tell them you won't answer the question until you know more about them."

> A- look, i wont tell you anything until you tell me more about yourself. 
> ?- I'm a simple stranger looking for information. Nothing more, nothing less.
> A- what does that even mean? (left on read)

* Dallas will send that to Melody too
## Caesar Rescue
* On the way, we get messages from LH asking us to do something
* Neighborhood is like a Brazilian favela - is it poverty, or supervillain attack?
* Zephyr is on overwatch. Nick, scan the building! Like A-list heroes. Nick is Andreyevich, Z is right next to A. M: "What about Laser Hawk?" Nick: "He's not here."
* Nick scans the building for lifeforms -> 8, unstable or temporary. Find Caesar, but a migraine follows. Can't comprehend something. Nick: "guys Bathsheba is in there." M, Z: "What? Who?"
* Z: "Let's give her a headache." Time to storm in! We'll take different approaches, M & Z will phase, Nick will teleport.
* Caesar is sitting in the living room. Casually talking to the lackey (secretly Marcus)
* Enter battle as a team! 4 team
* MEANWHILE Dallas texts Nick's mom. Anna knows what's up with the Children. Dallas briefly summarizes, then "?"
* Anna: "Ignore him". Alex texts mystery man with identity check, no response.
* Did Dallas get a text? yes, from Melody.
* MEANWHILE Lewis uses symbol of authority vs. Marcus! -> 11
* Marcus looks at Lewis, looks at Caesar, keeps talking. Z: "Melody, slap some cuffs on this guy."
* Melody produces solid light handcuffs! Meanwhile, Nick recognizes him! Nick: "hey Marcus!" M: "You know him?" Nick: "This is Cockroach King, the bank robber." Marcus: "also a prison escapee, if you want to list crimes. why are you here?" Z: "We came to pick up the kid, but arresting you is a happy bonus."
* Caesar hears this, scowls. M: "We're here to rescue you!" C: "Don't need to be rescued." M: "You were kidnapped by the villains!" C: "I'm staying over." Z: "With a criminal." C: "That supports & likes me." Z: "he's not qualified." C: "Who are you to say?" Z: "A citizen who upholds the law." Some discussion about law. C: "I lost my memories."
* C looks confused at Nick. He feels anger.
* Marcus being cuffed. "These won't do much." M: "that's the procedure!" Z: "Let's get him outside." Nick has something to do here.
* There's a cell phone here. It's the text that's been going back and forth with Alex.
* Nick makes telepathic contact with Caesar. Caesar doesn't want to talk.
* Is the Sycamour symbol blocking Caesar's memories? Nick will try to undo the amnesia. But it's not doable.
* Nick: "how do you know all this is true?" Caesar: "I have photos!" from the cell phone. Him, Marlum, and Master of Puppets at a beach. In the photo, Caesar is about 6. Nick: "don't you think that could be faked? Why not?" Nick will try to dredge up Caesar's actual memories. The photo is in his memories, but...
* Nick tries to create an artificial memory -> 8
## Escape Attempt
* Nick's headache is getting worse. "I gotta lay down. We should get out of here."
* Marcus: "I'm not getting out of here & you shouldn't try, or someone will get hurt."
* Nick switches telepathic targets: what does he know? Tidbits of red dust (physically) around him. Reminds us of small crystals in Bathsheba's artifacts.
* Z: "Look, I took down Nightquake. Don't fight us."
* Nick: "Crystals, red dust. Blow that stuff away from us?"
* Zephyr tries using wind powers, but it's not getting out.
* M: "Is she here?" Marcus: "She's not taking care of the kid." Nick: "What is this stuff then?" Marcus: "A memento. and handcuffs."
* Marcus: "Say again, you should leave or get hurt." Z: "You'll be the one who gets hurt." Marcus: "No." Z: "I wasn't asking." Marcus: "I don't care."
* Does the dust have a psychic or emotional connection? Feels like handcuffs. Powerful psychic energy here, Nick can't interfere with it in his present state.
* Nick: "this stuff is on his clothes. We gotta get them off." Melody will start stripping Marcus? Before that, Marcus snaps the handcuffs & stares Melody down. Melody persists, Marcus throws a punch -> 9. Melody marks Angry, Guilty
* Zephyr uses wind blades to smack him. Not much effect.
* Zephyr tries to run Caesar out, runs into an invisible wall.
* Marcus: "don't want to fight, just leave." M: "Do you want to be here?" Marcus: "Not really." Melody: "I can kick Bathsheba's ass. We beat her once and we're gonna fight her again!"
* Marcus: "Can't let you take the kid. He's a friend." Melody: "If he's a friend I can accept that. But if I can do something about Bathsheba, I need you to help me." Marcus: "Can't do much." Melody: "Promise?"
* Zephyr: "Cops are on the way." Marcus: "He's here willingly." Zephyr: "you're an escaped convict, you're still going down. Even if we leave here now. Cops can lay siege to this place." Marcus: "Barrier isn't the only thing keeping me alive?"
* Discussion of Melody getting hit. Z: "Makes me not very keen on you at all."
* Marcus is physically strong & tough, per the bank fight. Marcus: "no one cares about helping me."
* Nick: "Would you shut the fuck up."
* Nick wants to teleport out of the building by making a telepathic bond with Caesar, Marcus, Melody, and Zephyr. Nope, they get knocked unconscious when Nick tries.
* The team gives up. Nick takes a powerful blow -> 3, marks Hopeless anyway
* Dallas arrives, sees the team totally bummed out
* "Do we have any leads?" "No." Nick: "Yes." (holding a handful of dust)
