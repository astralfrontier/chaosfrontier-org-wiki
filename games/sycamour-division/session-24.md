# Session 24 (2019-10-19)
* Everyone left the house last time feeling bummed out (Dallas because he couldn't punch anyone)
## Karaoke
* Everyone is nursing their wounds
* Nick: "let's go have fun" (tragically). Around 5pm
* Dallas sings "hanging out to dry" by cold war kids
* Nick: "That was great" (not great) Dallas: "felt like we did great! I wasn't there though!" Aya: "is this a cake thing?" Nick: "no cake was involved" Aya is not ready for cake, even abstractly.
* Aya: "I don't think we did baaad, but we couldn't do anything. but we're going to do something because I'm going to punch her in the face!" Lewis: "I can get behind that." Aya: "after we find her."
* L: "Picked up anything from glitter?" N: "still headaches." A: "Give it to me. I can handle it." L: "Training montage?" D: "What's your training montage song?" Aya hums it. Chariots of Fire by Vangelis! L: "no eye of the tiger?" A: "I'm not a tiger" N: "Not a chariot either" A: "I could easily be on fire"
* Nick hands over the dust to Aya
* L: "Who is this Bath-- person?" D: "Bath salts." A: "she tried to take Alex!" L: "What can she do?" A: "She has black hole powers and mind control!" D: "Brain stuff!" L: "Mental ability means fighting them on their home ground is a bad idea. Lure them somewhere, take them down quickly." D: "She might not even have a body." A: "Yeah she ran away." N: "She might actually be that dust."
* A: "We should throw it in the fireplace!" N: "This is all we have." L: "where would we keep that dust?"
* Lewis recently discovered pocket dimension, library/museum. N: "That sounds amazing" D: "You got us a clubhouse! Er, museum" L: "I got _me_ a sanctuary. Need super-speed and phasing to get there." A: "Is it on the moon?"
* A: "did you want to put the dust there, or research there?" L: "Store dust there until Nick feels better, don't want to give her a spare key to my personal place" D: "Any time there's something I don't know where to put, it goes under the bed! let's get Alex a real place to live!"

### The Gift

* A: "Speaking of Alex under the bed, I have something for Nick!" D: "You know what a segueway is?" L: "Isn't that the two-wheel thing?" D: "Nick, run away" N: "I don't have energy to run away" D: "We'll rescue you when you get shoved under a bed"
* A: "You put Alex under the bed to avoid having your mom find out they live there! Everybody has things they hide from their parents. What would Nick hide from his mom?" L: "She got your porn?" N: "She did not!" A: "What's porn?"
* (does Lewis spend 10 minutes explaining porn to Ayami?)
* A: "Nick spends time reading, humans need to go to sleep, so he over-reads, humans can't see in the dark, so I got you this!" Aya gives Nick a box. N: "safe to open?" A: "It won't explode" N: "I might"
* It's a booklight! With solid light crescent moon that hangs from it, black bag
* N: "That's really sweet, thank you!" A: "The moon is because we went to the moon" L: "?" D: "What?"
* Nick: "That's all true. We also went to the library. Library, then the moon." L: "Books can take you places"
* Discussion of what Lewis thought was in the box - more porn?
* L: "I just expect weird strange things from you guys" D: "Clinical way to explain this" N: "What clinic?" D: "I don't know" Nick: "I do read stuff though." Dallas: "Like me!"
* N: "I don't keep people under my bed, Dallas." Let's get the Children a shared apartment

### Children of the Night

* Did we ever get the Children a job at Red Vox? Dallas texts Marlone
* N: "Dallas, you're the only person whose relationship could be improved by partner moving out"
* D: "The covert nature of my identity can be compromised if we don't get the Children onto Red Vox's payroll" Marlone: "I'll talk to their guardian ASAP" D: "Like today?" Marlone: "If she's not out getting drunk" D: "Need this really soon"
* Dallas wants to provoke Marlone -> 12
* Marlone: "I'll see what I can do"

## Free Kieran

* After school, Aya gets text from Fiona. "We're picking up Kieran, get ready" A: "Wait what?" Early release.
* A tells the group. Doesn't want to pick up Kieran. L: "Still bitter over the blush thing?" A: "Yes but, don't know if I want to pick up someone who might be a bad guy" N: "Where should we meet you". At house. We'll be there!
* Nick teleports instantly. Lewis takes scenic route. Dallas rides along with Zephyr.
* A: "Strange that Zephyr's taking so long." N: "He has stuff to do. Lots of responsibilities" A: "So does Dallas, but he blows them off"
* A: "not sure if I want to go at all" N: "Ask Kieran yourself" A: "He might just disappoint me" N: "But even then you'll know for sure. You could do with a lot fewer worries in your life." A: "Try not to worry about too much. You worry about everything!" N: "Let's put our worries away together and find out what's going on with Kieran"
* Dallas & Lewis arrive! L: "Miss anything good?" A: "Dunno what we would have missed" D: "Ready to go?" A: "Ready as I'm gonna be" D: "You know what ready enough sounds like?" A: ? D: "Sounds like all you need!" L: "So fucking lame" D: "Know what so fucking lame sounds like? All you need"
* N: "We're all gonna pick up Kieran." D: "I can stay here cooking dinner" A: "don't want you near the oven" L: "We'll do BBQ" A: "Know how to roast people"
* Fiona figured we'd all be here
* Dallas discusses readiness. Discussion of duct tape. Will it fix everything? Not Dallas's relationship with Alex
* What song do we sing on the road trip? Bohemian Rhapsody
* 15 minutes away, at the prison, Kieran is outside, not cuffed. L: "Get in loser, we're going shopping"
* Fiona: "might want to talk to Melody first" Aya: not feeling positive about this? Nick: thumbs up. Comfort and support -> 11!
* Cop: "Are you Ayami Kobayashi?" (cop is apparently a Utau fan) Aya: ".... sure"
* Kieran: "only way I could get out of here so quickly. Care to hug?" Aya: (deep breath) "... okay!"
* It'll be a tight fit. Aya: "I can sit in someone's lap" Kieran: "I can fit in the trunk!" (blushing) Aya: "OH LOOK, LASERS DON'T GO OFF WHEN YOU BLUSH"
* Nick: "don't need to sit in the trunk it's fine."

### Relationship Questions

* L: "This is awkward family drama, D, ditch?" D: "Yes, but I wanna see how this goes. Kieran, have you met your daughter's boyfriend, Nick?" L: "Do you know what you're doing?" D: "No, I'm so unaware!"
* Kieran grabs Nick's hand, shakes. "I didn't know my daughter had a boyfriend" Nick: "I don't think she knows either." Kieran looks at Aya confused/scared. Nick: "okay so it's complicated"
* Aya to Dallas: "okay, re-explain that word." Nick: "Yeah Dallas" Dallas: "I know you went to the moon together. To me that seems like something." Aya: "I was told people don't normally go to the moon. Does that mean Grando & Lucy went to the moon?" Discussion of whether Lunar landings qualify as a date.
* Dallas: "it's all context. I'm 'accidentally' making everyone uncomfortable."
* Nick: "I mean we're dating, but I don't know if she wants to be a girlfriend but I'd like her to be, I just generally want to make her happy."
* Ayami: "Lewis, what does boyfriend mean?" L: "A male person you're in a romantic relationship with?" A: "Why didn't Dallas just say that?" L: "He's Dallas" A: "I feel like this was another cake thing?" D: "Everything's a cake thing" Nick: "but you can't bake!"
* How about duct tape instead of cake?
* Dallas: "I was wrong" A: "Apparently about a lot of things!" D: "Some things!" A: "I guess Dallas was right."
* Kieran: "Does this always happen between everyone here?" A: "This is pretty normal" K: "I need to teach you proper talking."
* K: "we didn't meet in the best of situations. Was making robots for the enemy. Utau sales have been good but I'm poor, I can't sustain the lifestyle I lead." N: "building robots?" K: "Trying to create life"
* A: "you're not really a bad guy?" K: "I was desperate, wanted the money. Something you should see. Driving to Fiona's house."

## Anna Rescue

* Kieran shows a flash drive. "Know Marlum, Bathsheba, Master of Puppets?" D: "Yeah!"
* Kieran has a lot of data about their lives pre-Sycamour. Apparently Marlum & Bathsheba are a thing
* Nick: "some info we may not want to hear." K: "?" Aya: "Lewis told me what porn was" L: "I'm out" (mark doom track)
* Kieran: glares threateningly
* The drive includes a lot of data about their plans too. K: "They didn't think you'd go against them." N: "That's literally our job"
* Meanwhile, Lewis heads to Red Vox HQ! Any other crime he can ~~do~~ deal with?
* Anna has been missing from the police station for 40 minutes. L: "That's lunch." L texts Nick: "Don't freak out, but your mum might have gone missing. I'm heading over to her precinct to look into it now."
* Car arrives at Fiona's place. Nick tries texting his mom. No response. Telepathy? -> 9, marks Afraid
* Mom is on the other side of the city, she's in distress, can't really communicate - she's in shock
* Bunch of people tied up in a dark place, duct tape over mouths
* Nick: "guys I gotta go rescue my mom" Dallas: "Take us along"
* Kieran: "is that Sycamour?" Aya: "probably" K: "Can you bring me?" Has the werewolf heroin been completely destroyed? We don't know
* Would Anna be turned into a werewolf? Nick: "she'd be less violent" Fiona: "Give me a minute!" Hands Kieran a gun.
* Who gets there first? Zephyr
* It's a warehouse (surprise). There's guards, not robots.

* Someone takes a shot at Zephyr while we're fighting! Nick is ready, defends -> 10.
* Anna untied hostages, they are running away, past remaining guard. Lewis: "This was your job and you should feel bad!" -> 10. Guy starts running away.
* LH will kick skateboard under the guard's foot to trip him. Guard is down.
* Nick: "hey mom!" Anna: "hi. that was quick." N: "You can thank Lewis for that." L: "They noticed you disappeared fast. how much do they rely on you?" A: "don't want to say too much, but too much." Aya: "You okay?" Anna: "Okay, just a bit shook."

### Werewolf fight

[werewolf theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aOMFcl9hUo){.youtube}

* Suddenly a door comes flying past. It's the werewolf! He leaps for the gun Lewis threw aside.
* Any civilians? Kieran's not actively in the warehouse, might not need rescued.
* Anna grabs her gun, takes a shot. Werewolf opens fire. Lewis is going to evacuate Anna
* Nick burns! -> 12, spend 1 on Moat for bullet protection
* Melody burns! -> 8, marks Insecure. Teleports behind werewolf, grabs, yanks to tear off. -> 9, Zephyr helps +1. Takes something from them, creates opportunity
* Melody takes triple hit from werewolf -> 10, gives ground, marks hopeless & afraid
* Dallas rips off the jacket! overwhelm a vulnerable foe -> 11, causes serious collateral damage. Sends werewolf flying through a wall
* Melody can't move, locked in place. Lewis grabs & evacuates her. Everyone's safely outside.
* Anna checks the ex-werewolf. Lots of bruising and blood. Nick: "we can teleport to hospital if you need" Whole team? Yes!

## Hospital

* Melody can move again. Lewis: "Been a day, saving people Nick loves from danger" A: "Thank you for saving me, Zephyr." L: "you're welcome." Kieran: "What happened?" A: "I ripped jacket off the werewolf, I couldn't move Zephyr rescued me." Kieran starts looking fearful.
* K: "You okay?" A: "Physically yeah. Scary, but I'll get over it." K: "need to talk?" A: "... Talk about what?"
* K: "This whole thing." L: "Are you traumatized by near-death experience?" A: "Done this before!"
* K: "I'm your father, I'm here if you need me." A: "I'm pretty capable, I'm pretty tough." K: "Doesn't mean you shouldn't talk about these kinds of things." A: "okay it was really scary!" Kieran hugs! Lewis notices K is crying.
* Where's the rest of the team? Nick is checking on Anna, Dallas is answering hard questions
* K: "Just because you fight villains doesn't mean you shouldn't talk about scary things." A: "I talk to my team all the time" K: "Does it feel good?" A: "They're my best friends! They worry about me." K: "I worry about you too" A: "You do?"
* K: "You think I spent all my time looking through Sycamour stuff?" A: "I was worried they wouldn't let you out and you'd be a bad guy, or if you're okay with me being a hero. I was gonna do it anyway." K: "That's why I worried about you. You were always going to be a hero. That's comforting but scary." A: "Why?" K: "I built you to do what you want. Be a hero if you want. But heroism is dangerous stuff."
* K: "Worries me that someday you'll get hurt." A: "Working on training against reprogramming." K: "I could help if you trust me" A: "I made a lot of progess. Don't want you to 'fix' any of my program. Except the blushing thing, that sucks."
* A: "I need you to not be a bad guy. I want you to be here." K: "I can be an unofficial member of your team!" A: "We don't have an initial for you. But okay!"
* A: "They should be okay. I cause a lot of problems for them, but they're fine with it." K: "You probably only cause small problems. What about that cake thing?" A: "Dallas said 'its like cake', then rambled, now cake makes no sense" K: "That's not your fault, that's Dallas" A: "he should have said he doesn't know"
* K: "Anyway who's Dallas?" A: ".... I meant Laser Hawk!"
* K: "Anyway how are you doing?" A: "A lot happened. Children of the Night! We're gonna watch anime! You know what I don't like watching? Top Gun! Also I went to prom! And the moon!" K: "did you get a rocket?" A: "Just a rock."
* A: "We teleported to the moon! How would you get there?" K: "ohhhh I get it."
* Kieran: "how about me as guy in the chair?" Nick: "weren't you in for 10-20 years?" How does the team feel about Kieran? Okay.
* Can Aya be programmed with sarcasm? Kieran won't reprogram Melody any more. Well, the blushing.
* Should we just send Aya to Wikipedia? Probably. but we learn so much by talking to each other! Nick feels a healthy skepticism that Dallas was right earlier in the day. Dallas is apparently a genius.
* And Nick is Aya's boyfriend! So they're official. We're confused but happy.
