# The Book-Light
Nick's room has a certain order to it, that only he can sense. Things are sorted not by their visible attributes, but their invisible auras, and the emotions imprinted on them. To Nick, it's perfectly sensible. To anyone else, it's a typical teenager's messy room. That makes it tough to attach a book-light where it'll do the most good, but Nick finally manages it. And as he lays down to try and sleep, he reaches out a curious hand to touch the self-sustaining light, and smiles. "I know you don't sleep, but sweet dreams anyway."
 
Ayami is in her room, sitting on her floor near her chair, putting together a scrapbook.  It seemed like a fun enough activity to work on, and she had never made one before.  Photos and paper were scattered about the otherwise clean plush carpeted floor.  As she applied a sticker to a corner, she stopped, thinking she was hearing things.  She shook her head twice to clear it.  "Wow, I think I'm hearing things.  I swore I just heard Nick.  Bug?  Malfunction?  Maybe I should power down and run a scan..."
 
"Nope. It's me." Nick is back in his room, but he's present anyway. "I reached out to you telepathically, I guess! I put your book-light up, and made contact with it. And, um, was thinking about you. So here we are."
 
"Oh!  Um, wow!  That's... pretty neat!  Did you know you could do that?"
 
"Telepathy? Oh yeah, I think so." Nick sounds very confident of himself. "I mean I do it all the time. But usually it's conscious, you know? The rest of the time, it's like.... the mall. Accidental, and not good. I think this is the first good accidental mind-link I've made. And you're coming through super-clear. Maybe because the light isn't just, y'know, something of yours, but you."
 
"Oh, uh, I knew you could use telepathy, but I thought normally you had to use that ring.  Did you know the light would work that way?  I'm guessing not since you said 'accidental'.  But I'm glad I'm your first good accidental mind-link!"
She smiles, and he can feel it even though she's pretty sure he can't see her right now.
 
"You.." Nick's face isn't visible, but his embarrassment at something couldn't be more clear. "That's very sweet to hear. I mean, this isn't... this isn't calling someone on the phone, or texting, but this is sort of like what having a girlfriend would be like, if.. so I guess, thank you, that feels really good."
 
"This is a lot more interesting than calling someone or texting!  I've never had a conversation with telepathy before! But...," the confusion is evident, "what do you mean?  Have you changed your mind?"
 
"Changed my mind about what?" Nick's thought radiates confusion.
 
"Do you not think I'm your girlfriend anymore?  If so, I think I'll need an explanation, because apparently I missed something?"
Puzzlement.
 
"I... I'm not 100% sure if you are my girlfriend," Nick thinks. "I mean, I want you to be-- Okay, I said that. Time for me to learn. Tell me why you asked if I'd changed my mind, and I'll try to explain what I feel about it."
 
"'Would be like' implies I'm not, right?  So you don't actually think I am?  I don't know.  You don't seem too sure," she explains, " so that makes me think you changed your mind about what you said earlier.  If I'm not then you can tell me that.  I want to make sure I can answer correctly if someone asks me, since apparently that's something people might ask."
 
There's a turmoil of thought, nothing coherent - but that's not really surprising right now. "Aya, do you think you're my girlfriend? I mean I'd love it if you said yes, but if you say yes... What does that word mean to you?"
 
"Well, yes; I don't really think we're just friends, Nick.  I may not know everything, but that's pretty obvious, don't you think?"  The confusion grows a bit deeper.
 
There's a muddle of confused happiness, joy, and panic. "I guess it's kinda.. obvious if you think about it, yeah...." He rallies, mentally. "But then is that all girlfriend means? Not just friends?"
 
"It seems like a word that's similar to 'teammates' and 'best friends'.  It's just a 'more than friends' version.  It is a descriptor.  When descriptors fit, they're used.  Isn't that how words work?  Am I missing something?"
 
Nick's thought is still warm, but a little worried too. "No, that's right. So... what do you think it describes about us? What is the 'more than' part of 'more than friends' to you?"
 
Nick can feel the mental sigh of frustration.  "Oh, you mean the part I can't explain too well?  Where I don't have great words for whatever our connection is?"
 
"We're thinking now." Nick's communication is self-demonstrating, but it comes with something that isn't words. A momentary flash, of Nick and Aya sitting at the karaoke place, a shared bowl of ice cream in front of them, topped with whipped cream. Nick dabs a bit of the whipped cream off the concoction, then decorates Aya's nose with it and grins. "If words aren't enough, share another way."
 
The frustration is replaced by a fascinated excitement that feels like a fizzy drink.  "Oooooooooooooooo that's so amazing!  Let me try, let me try!"  The scene switches to school and Nick and Aya passing notes in class with a teacher completely unaware as Grando can be heard snoring in the corner.  "Oh, that's so awesome!  Okay."
"I had to test it first.  Let me think a minute."
 
While Aya thinks, Nick passes back another note, that unfolds into another bowl of ice cream on the school desk.
 
"There are a lot of things, really." The scene shifts to the moon, and Aya has her head on Nick's shoulder as they're looking up at the universe above them. "This is one of them. But there are other things I can switch to, like hugs. Or how you believed in me running into that black hole after Bathsheba when I didn't even think I could beat her, and you mentally connected with me there. I didn't have good words for any of it, but it meant a lot to me. I don't know, we're really close. It's not a type of closeness I feel with other people."
 
"If those things mean girlfriend to you, then that's what you are, and that's what I want." Nick's thought is strong and powerful, for a moment. Hesitation sets in with his next thoughts. "There's things I thought it would mean for us, that it doesn't." A series of encounters from the last week flash by, times when Nick and Aya were physically close. Nick's feeling comes with it. Times when he pulls Aya close and kisses her, or brushes her hair with a hand rather than staying in his own space. Even Top Gun, when he remembers her blushing, and wishes that the hand squeeze had turned into a longer hug and cuddle. "I thought maybe you didn't want those things, because you didn't do them. I should have realized you might not think of them. Or been confused."
 
"Um.  Isn't that for when you've run out words but still want to talk?  Were you... running out of words a lot?"  The confusion has returned in full force.
 
Nick's own feeling of confusion joins in, but he rallies, determined to learn. "Isn't what for running out of words? Tell me what you think is true, Aya. Or show me, if you need."
 
Nick receives a flashback to the park of himself kissing Aya, and hears himself saying "I just didn't know what else to say and went with it anyway when I really should have come up with something better to say".
"So it's a last resort for when you're out of words, right?  And since you're not supposed to kiss your friends, it seems like a pretty limited form of communication.  I've been pretty good about trying to find a lot of words so you don't worry too much," she explains.
"But now I'm really confused again."
 
The moment happens again, but now from Nick's point of view, and with all his thoughts and feelings. "I want her to understand what I feel. I want her to respond to it. I don't know if it will. When I use words, I'm being confusing. Please, understand what love is from this, please please please." Nick dared not use his telepathy during the real kiss. Now, he does. "I want to be close to you, to share everything with you, to experience life with you." There's music - Beethoven's "Ode to Joy", and a memory of a bookstore. There's other memories, of two people completing each other's sentences, sharing food at lunch, laying together on a rooftop, arguing, hugging, crying, but always, always together. "This is love. Experience what being kissed feels like."
 
"I... knew I felt close to you at that moment.  But you seemed so worried you had done something wrong and I was very confused.  I didn't want to see you that worried anymore.  But that didn't mean I didn't keep thinking about it.  Because for a moment, it felt like things made sense, and then a few moments later, everything made less sense than it ever did.  I felt like I got to see part of you that other people don't see.  And that was... really special to me," she is hugging him in the mindstate at this point, not really through a conscious thought, "It reminds me more of... It was... like when I tried to teach you how to dance, and my words didn't get anywhere.  I had to find another way to teach you.  I'm sorry that I didn't understand and I let words mix things up so much.  I understand.  I feel that way, too."
 
Nick shares two Ayamis, both imaginary. One of them leans into the kiss, responding eagerly. The other pushes him away, an angry look on her face, and slaps him across the cheek. "This is what I felt," he explains mentally.  "I didn't know which Aya I would get. Or another one, that I didn't expect. These are the ghosts inside us, Aya. The ones that help us interact with the real other person. That closeness, that feeling of being close, is when the ghost and the real person are almost the same. I want that with you too, all the time."
 
"That's what I want, too.  I didn't care what our connection was called.  What was important to me was that it was there.  You just... had a name for it, and I didn't..."
"And it was scary thinking I was going to lose it over a word."
 
Nick thinks back a few moments, like a video rewinding, and finds what he was looking for. "You can kiss, or hug, or cuddle, any time you want, Aya. That's part of what 'girlfriend' means to me. You can do anything that you feel will bring us closer, or anything that brings you comfort. Okay? Even if you don't have words to describe something, it's okay." Memories of super-battles come back to him. "Bad things might happen to us. We'll try to protect each other, and the rest of the team. But the closeness? You will never lose that, over words or anything else? Okay? That's something else love means."
 
"Of course we're going to protect each other and the rest of the team!  What do we look like?  We're heroes!"  There's an uplifting confidence with the words.  "I figured out we wouldn't lose our closeness when I didn't understand and you said it was okay.  It made things easier once I knew we had that.  But I still didn't want to make you worry.  I guess I didn't really understand what made you worry, though.  I understand better now.  Except... what's a cuddle?"
 
There's another scene - not of memory, but imagination. Nick laying in his bed, with Aya draped over him, napping like a kitten. Through his bedroom window, the dusk of one evening transforms with blinding speed into a starry night, then to a brilliant sunrise. Perhaps unnecessarily, Nick's thought follows. "It's.. like very close hugging, for a long time."
 
"Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm why did no one explain advanced hugging sooner...?" Aya seems mildly miffed but mostly good-humored.
 
There's a montage of battles with super-villains, Anna Hel's angry face, and other distractions. "I guess... a lot of things got in the way of it?" Nick finally admits the truth, though, something his telepathy forces him to do. "I guess I just wasn't sure of your real feelings toward me, so I was never sure what I ought to talk about, or suggest.. The most important thing to me, Aya, is helping you feel comfortable with who we are to each other."
 
"I always told you what I felt even if I didn't know," Aya sounds surprised.  "I mean, I know I was probably really confusing, so I guess it was about as, what's the phrase: 'clear as mud'?"
 
"Clear as mud is us, alright," Nick replies sheepishly. "Sometimes you're confused. And other times, I was bad at listening. I'm sorry that I didn't always understand your feelings. I'm trying, I promise. You are important to me, Aya. Everything you are is important to me."
 
Nick can feel the smile.  "You always try your best.  I made mistakes, too.  I'm sorry I didn't ask more questions and I focused on the wrong things.  I'm sorry I didn't let you use your telepathy in the park.  If you didn't have it, we wouldn't have even been able to talk like this in such an interesting way and we'd still be more confused about a lot of things.  And if I had just let you do this back then, I would have just been able to say 'I love you, too', and it would have all been so much easier.  You're important to me, too, Nick, and I'm sorry."
 
The reply isn't verbal. It's the impression of something really happening though - Nick planting a soft kiss on the living light hanging in his room.
 
There's a few moments of silence.  "...So I take it you accept the apology?"
 
Nick's warmth is clear. "If you accept mine, for confusing you and making you feel distant. I won't let that happen again."
 
"Of course I accept your apology.  We all make mistakes, right?" a very bright feeling.  "We'll probably make a whole lot more, too, since we don't know everything.  But we're going to learn about it all together, right?
 
"And we can talk more to each other." Nick's thought is excited. "If you don't sleep, I can call you at night!" There's an echoed thought, suppressed - if it's okay. He's learning that it's okay. "We can talk about things that confuse us, or explain stuff to each other."
 
"Yes!  And this is so much better than a phone!  ...Unless this is hard for you to do.  Then we can use a phone.  But if it isn't this is so much better.  It's so much easier to explain things, not to mention that this is really fun!"  A scene from prom appears.  Aya is thrown through the air, being caught by Dallas and Alex has traded places with her.  "It's like instant replay!  And it doesn't even have to be real to be instantly replayed!  You can make your own movie!  ...Not Top Gun."
 
Nick's memory of Aya comes back. This time, the blush isn't the embarrassing, attention-grabbing disaster it must have felt like. In Nick's eyes, Aya is surrounded by a halo, and instead of awkwardly cringing at her own reaction, the feeling of his own embarrassment at the scene melts away as her hand touches his. "I.. don't mind Top Gun so much, if it's just with you," he admits.
 
There's a pause. "Didn't feel like that on my end." There's a flashback of Aya's perspective. Panicked confusion and bright lights as her eyes are locked on the screen as the feelings of eyes staring at her creates a feedback loop, making it worse. Until she feels Nick's reassurance she isn't alone and she puts her hand over his.  "It... wouldn't have been as bad if I hadn't been so surprised. Or had better control. I didn't know it was coming."
 
Nick offers feelings of mischievous challenge. "You're not surprised now. And you've been practicing control. And you knew it was coming. Want to watch it again, sometime?"
 
A feeling of heightened sharpness.  "So are you hoping I end up blushing again?  Because you'll probably be disappointed!"
 
Pictures of Nick and Aya cuddling closely on a couch, with Top Gun on the TV, flash by, accompanied by feelings of warmth and comfort. "Does it seem like I'd be disappointed?"
 
A smile.  "No.  Pretty sure everyone wins there.  But it could probably be anything on the TV."
 
"It could be." But that scene is replaced by ones of battle, and the training they've undergone. "But it would also mean you grew stronger. And I would love to be there to see that too."
 
"That's true, too.  I still have more training to do, but it's always nice to see progress!"  She smiles.  "We trained together, so maybe you got stronger, too!"
 
"Well my reaction was less... obvious," Nick concedes. "But yes, um, Top Gun took me by surprise too. I um, would like a chance to see if I'm up to it..." Still, his mind insists on wandering back to the cuddling on the couch. Maybe he doesn't have as much self-control as he'd like to imagine.
 
"...You sure this is really about Top Gun and training...?" The skepticism is in full force.
 
"It's not all about Top Gun and training," Nick admits cheerfully. "But it's also about those things."
 
"...Seems to me they're secondary to the REAL agenda," Aya comments bluntly, "but that's okay!" she says brightly.  "There is time for fighting and there is time for advanced hugging!"
 
"We were both right, we do understand each other if we talk things out!" Nick is beaming proudly.
 
"I knew we had a good understanding!  Except when we don't!  Which is more often than I thought!  But we'll work on that!"
 
"Well, misunderstandings happen. You're a virtual idol singer and I'm a troubled psychic. And we fight crime!" Nick pictures the pair as a dynamic duo, back-to-back, wearing matching domino masks.
 
Aya changes the color of the masks to a burnished gold and Nick's jacket to a dark blue color.  "There.  We match more now!"  Cheerfully she continues.  "Hopefully you're a less troubled psychic than you were before at least!"
 
"And you're a lot less virtual than you used to be." Still with the imagined cuddling! Nick needs another hobby. "And if you ever give a live concert, I'll try to help out with your stage effects, if you want. That's something else I would love to see."
 
"It would be interesting to give a concert out here.  I'd have to practice more, though.  Last time I practiced I actually made a lot of mistakes," Aya admits, "but it might go better now!"
 
"How can you make mistakes?" Nick seems confused, but in the good way. "This is like what you do, right?"
 
"Uh, well, I can't really screw up my vocals, so I didn't make any mistakes there, but... I messed up some of my dancing.  I didn't know I could mess it up, either, but my focus was pretty bad.  I was distracted...," she says, and there's a bit of confused embarrassment.  "I... kept thinking about you when I was singing and I didn't really know why and when I tried to think about what was going on in my head, I... missed some steps.  And was late on counts.  And there was really no excuse."
 
Nick isn't daydreaming about cuddling any more. His thought is concern, and admiration. "I'm sorry that it distracted you to think about me. Is there some way I can help clear up the distraction, help you get your focus back? Anything that you need from me?"
 
"Uh, well, I think I'll be okay.  I am less confused about things than I was, so practice will probably be a lot easier now.  I'll probably be less distracted.  It isn't something to be concerned about.  I should be able to focus more, I think.  But thanks!  I think this conversation already helped."
 
Nick is downright evil, because the next thing he's visualizing is a pretty solid kiss between himself and Aya, right in the middle of class at school, with everyone watching. "Less distracted is good. How's that?"
 
"Don't do that when I'm trying to practice, or perform on stage, and we're good!  ...And probably not in the middle of class, either... I am NOT dealing with the Detention Monster!" he can feel the flustered sensations that accompany the words.
 
Nick feels impish glee, but beyond that is an ocean of happiness. He finally feels really connected. "I won't distract you, on stage or in class. There will be time for the kissing and cuddling, and there will be time for the practice and performance, so that way you can stay focused on your dance!"
 
"I appreciate that.  And... I hate to say it, but... don't humans have to sleep...?  We have to be someplace tomorrow, right?" while there's a bit of regret, there's also a lot of concern about his health and well-being, especially in the event they have to fight a villain.
 
"I hate to say it, but yes we do," admits Nick. "Say. Maybe I'll fall asleep with my hand on the light, and you'll experience my dreams..." A flurry of thoughts lead to a hurried addition. "Hey, if that does happen for real and it gets weird, text me until I wake up, okay?"
 
"That sounds really interesting!  We should try it sometime!  ...but make sure you get some sleep.  You being tired would be pretty bad if we have to fight unexpectedly," she says.  "We'll definitely talk again like this!  And, um, I love you.  Good night."
 
Nick doesn't realize how much he needed this until he thinks it back. "I love you too, Aya. Talk to you soon."
