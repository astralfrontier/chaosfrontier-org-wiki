# Session 25 (2019-10-26)

* Zephyr is out today, Nick had to step out temporarily during game

## Keeping the Peace

* Ryan Peacekeeper is Jeremiah Peacekeeper's kid, and also the werewolf
* JP: "What happened?" Nick: "he was turned into a werewolf" JP: "Last guy got minor injuries, this one's in a critical state" LH: "He's not dead!" JP: (blinks)
* JP: "Who did this?" Nick: "Sycamour turned him into a werewolf" JP: "doesn't excuse this other stuff" LH makes excuses. "You're just upset he was a wolf and now he's a person"
* JP is pretty upset his son is hurt. LH: "You're welcome"

* LH: "You're upset your son is here but not here how you wanted him to be" JP: "I should be thankful?" LH: "Yeah, thank us for saving your son from Sycamour"
* JP: looks at the rest of the team. Melody: "It was hard to get that jacket off him!" JP: "I understand the staples, but..."
* Nick makes a facial expression at Dallas: 'say something'.
* LH: "Sir, you know what happens if someone's a werewolf? They enter a hyper-aggressive state, potential for hurting innocents. It was me - I hit your son until he was unconscious. I'm not sorry."
* JP: "But what caused him to take this much damage--" LH: "It was me. I beat him with laser force." Discussion of the physics of laser force.
* LH tries to say "this is how it is", provokes -> 8, +1 from Nick & Melody for support. M: "There was a wall" Nick: "Innocent civilians on scene, LH was trying to keep them safe"

* JP: "so who did the werewolf thing?" Melody: "Sycamour" Nick: "Master of Puppets" M: "He's in jail right now!"
* JP: "Did you not pursue this?" Nick: "He was already there" Melody: "We chose to come to the hospital" LH high-fives Melody. Nick: "Cops were on the scene, and they were doing investigation"
* JP wants to be left alone with his son.

## Bigger Team!

* Marlone texts: "Your friends got jobs on Red Vox officially. I'm putting them on your team since I heard this Sycamour situation needs to be handled ASAP, and who better to do it than former members?" "Also, I heard Absentia got released from the hospital. Probably should pick them up." Team name: LMNZ GADK? KLANG DMZ
* Alex: "just got released" "pick me up nerd" LH: "You got a job" Alex: "how much money?" LH: "enough to get your own place"

* LH: "You look better already" Alex: "Just a mind scratch" LH: "They put on a mind bandaid?" Alex is no longer unconscious, but still in a hospital
* What's this about a job? LH fills in Alex. A: "Aren't you almost done with Sycamour?" LH: "More to it than that. Bathsheba is a new element"
* LH: "We got you and Lucy and Grando in on this!" A: "Why do you always call him Grando?" LH: "He's not Jeremy" A: "You call Lucy & me by our names" LH: "You're Alex, she's Lucy, he's Grando." A: "That's the way it is"
* LH: "When my mask comes off it's Dallas underneath. There's just more Grando underneath Grando." A: "Same for Melody? Or Ayami I guess" LH: "That's a complicated question! Still figuring it out" A: "will get Grando to change his legal name to Grando, if you get Melody to change" LH: "I'll talk to her, she might be into it!"
* A: "Want to tell the others about this gig?" Who got the text message - everyone! LH: Nick lives with Lucy & Grando, he can tell them.
* At home, Jeremy sleeps as far from Lucy as possible. It's Anna's decision.
* Nick: "hey you two got a job at Sycamour! Er, Red Vox!" Jeremy: O_O  Nick: "It's been a long day" J: "It's 2pm" Nick: "we had to fight a werewolf" J: "I had to knit a sweater" Lucy: "You more knitted a line of yarn"
* Nick: "You should be hearing from Marlone soon" J: "Why did he tell you first?" N: "We pestered him"

## Team Meeting

* Alex comes to the team meeting.  (Is Grando beating Nick up for 20 minutes?)
* Kieran is doing a power point on a really big TV screen that rises up out of the floor.  Image: Marlum, MoP, Romanus (photo from the basement).  Alex looks irritated.  D: Oh… D: He’s depowered.  A: I mean, oh, that’s his father.  D: We don’t know that for sure.  A: Actually when they brought that in, they mentioned he had parents.  D: Well that’s kinda interesting.  We were operating under the assumption Marlum was just using Romanus.  A: You could have asked like, any of us. D: Know it’s a touchy subject for you.
* Image: Marlum, MoP, Bathsheba; Bathsheba looks exactly the same as when we fought her, even though image is 5 years old.  M: Is that really a human body?  K: I hear she died about two years ago?  It’s complicated.  D: We saw her a * week ago  K: Apparently she died to gain immortality.  Marlum, Bathsheba, Master of Puppets.  They go way back.  * Apparently Sycamour was founded by these three.  They worked with Life Force before this, general science institution.  Founded specialized tech branches.  Cyberprism, for example (Dallas’ grandmother works with) – Dallas’ internship.  D: I might know someone who knows someone who knows someone who works there.  K: Good start.  These 3 worked in separate branches but worked together to fix each other’s problems.  There are a lot of pictures of them hanging in bars.  College friends? Craig Lilac, Cassandra Fink, Cliff Burton.
* Image: Letter.  We should take initiative all the great people do that.  We should rid Halycon of petty crimes and villainy.
* K: This is probably how they founded Sycamour. M: But it sounds like they’re working against villains there. K: We must be the villains to them.  M: Why would they think WE’RE the villains?  How is turning someone into a werewolf good?  K: They probably believe in the ends justify the means.  M: That doesn’t make too much sense.  K: Bad guys don’t make too much sense.  I worked with them so I know that.  Aside from this letter, I also have

### The Plan

* Image: Google spreadsheet.  Bulletpoints.  Their plan.
  * K: Goes as follows – step 1 – money to buy merc
  * Step 2 – hero museum
  * Step 3 – steal town hall
  * Step 4 - ???
  * Step 5 – Profit
* They want to steal the town hall to “stap antigravity tech to be a flying town hall of justice”
* Nick teleports Grando & Lucy to the meeting. Kieran: "What kept you?" Grando: "Yarn"
* Nick spins a yarn about how the three of them were looking for places for Grando & Lucy to live.
* New plan:
  * [v] Grab Lilac's son back.
  * [v] Get werewolf serum from Cliff.
  * [v] Power-up remaining troops.
  * [ ] Werewolf army.
  * [ ] Build MORE giant robots. (gonna have to break cliff out smh)
  * [ ] Change Nightquake formula to work with other people. (also cass needs to sprinkle the other dust on it)
  * [ ] Steal town hall, with civilians pacified and a giant army at our side.
* The NQ formula is probably what killed Zephyrus, and Sycamour gave it to Nightquake
* Melody: "So what's our plan?" K: "Who's the team leader?" Nick: "That's probably Zephyr" M, LH: "Yeah" K: "So where is he?" ".... don't know"
* K: "Anyone want to take the leader spot?" Nick: "I mean no, but I nominate Laser Hawk" LH: "I'll do my best"
* Alex: "We know their next move, the whole breaking people out"
* M: "We shouldn't be sitting around for this" Nick: "Do we have an army of vampires?" LH: "do we know any vampires?" (We know one, but he's a supervillain)
* We should deal with the werewolves first. Nick: "how many werewolves are there?" K: "Let's see who went missing in the past few hours" M: "Check with police to see if they found anything"
* Nick texts mom. "Might be more werewolves, was anything found in the building where you were captive?" Anna: "Found one thing. Remember bank fight with Apprentice? Really fast elevator going down. Found another one but we can't get down there." N: "We can take a look."
* Nick: "also we found red dust!" Kieran: "is that the other dust?" Melody shows Kieran the dust, but no touching.
* Kieran snaps a photo, reviews. Dust is synthetic, probably a new element
* Nick: "we can try tracing it psychically or chemically" K: "is Bathsheba your first priority?" Nick: "we gotta take care of her sooner or later".
* Priorities:
  * Check out the elevator thing
  * Scan for red dust

## Captive Warehouse

* We teleport there! There's a small trapdoor. Up in the roof, a square proportionate to the trapdoor, very futuristic.
* LH: "Can you drop a glowstick down there?" Melody: does so. It goes down forever.
* LH leaps down the hole! He eventually reaches the orb of light. He absorbs the energy to legs & back, to try and survive this insanity -> 7
* He lands hard, takes fall damage, finds a winding corridor with lighting. Communication? Not shouting, cell phones don't work, telepathy is fine. Nick teleports himself & Melody down
* LH sets off to explore! -> 13
  * Who here is in the greatest danger? Guards patrolling
* LH relays via telepathy to Nick. Want to start a fight? Nick: maybe not. Let's teleport past the guards -> 10
* Melody is stealing hugs during all these teleports!
* Find a locked door, and a corridor. Melody phases inside, finds vials of werewolf heroin.
* LH: Should we destroy this stuff? YES. Who's destroying stuff? It's always Laser Hawk. But can he do it silently? -> 6! Melody uses sound capabilities to cancel out the noise, +1 team
* Meanwhile one guard comes to check in on things. LH holds the door shut, while the rest of us are escaping through air vents (first Nick then Melody then finally Laser Hawk)

## Guards! Guards!

* Guards kick down the door as LH is retreating, and take a shot at him! take a powerful blow -> 7. Gives ground. The guards will shoot LH if he goes through the vent.
* LH goes to punch the guy into the other guy! -> 10, resist or avoid blows/pick up guns
* LH: "Melody, Nick, go on without me, I'll take care of the rest of the guards"
* Nick emerges from the vent into another room with purple stuff - likely indicating the werewolf heroin. 4-5 guards were headed toward Laser Hawk. Nick: "You really don't wanna do that" They start shooting
* Nick marks Angry, spends 1 burn on moat to block bullets
* Melody looks at the situation. "Tell ya one more time, you really don't want to do that!" No Provoke, but they stop shooting. One guard throws a grenade/flash-bang! Melody tries to grab & return it -> 5!
* Flashbang goes off, Nick and Melody are stunned. Soldiers start to reposition. Nick's TK wave shoots outward -> 9, Melody took the brunt of the flashbang (+1 team), resist or avoid blows, impress/surprise/frighten the opposition
* Meanwhile, 3 guards block LH's path. Kick ass! -> 13, resist or avoid blows, impress/surprise/frighten
* More kicking ass! -> 11, knocking the guards out
* LH meets up with the team. Time to smash the machine!
* But first, someone walks behind it, revealing themselves! Dude in gas mask appears dramatically! Throws a grenade at us! LH will intercept it out of the air -> 11
* Grenade bounces back, purple haze, dude tries to get stealthy
* Melody tries to mark target by putting a top hat on his head -> 9, Nick uses TK to push purple haze away to reveal the target, +1
* Another grenade! LH defends -> 7, but he slid another grenade below LH. It activates, and LH might breathe in the smoke? Take a powerful blow -> 5! LH hammer-copters the purple haze back at him.
* Bad guy sucks the gas toward him. LH: "hey you suck!"
* Meanwhile Nick is gonna crush the machine! -> 10
* Melody tries to lasso the bad guy! -> 4, manages to lasso LH instead
* Nick! Emergency teleport to the surface! -> 10. Teleport to.... Dallas's house. In the living room.
* Mom and cousin are in the living room watching a telenovela. We teleport right in front of the TV
* Nick: "didn't mean to block the screen, sorry." LH: (fake voice) "you didn't see anything. Good day ma'am. we're here by mistake. You'll never see us again."
* Mom blinks. Realizes this is real. "Get out of my house! Now" LH: "Where's the front door?" Mom: "right there". Mom readies a flip-flop. We're gone. Nick: "Your house is really nice. Bye!"
* Mom texts Dallas's mundane phone: "Dallas, did you know your friend Ayami is a superhero?"
