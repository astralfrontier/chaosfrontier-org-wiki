# Session 26 (2019-11-02)
## The Formula
* Last time, Zephyr disappeared from the hospital - what happened?
* While there, Auster texted Z, "need you to come to my house, don't bring anyone". Z: "On my way, please turn off the traps".
* At the house, Auster points at a book. Learn American Sign Language!
* There's also a note from Kieran to some page on Github
* On Auster's laptop is the formula for the poison used to kill Zephyrus. Do we know who created the formula? Sycamour. Nobody should be seeing this page but they forgot to protect it
* The formula is derived from a power inhibitor that affects the Zephyrus powers, but stops it from being lethal
* In the kitchen, Auster has a cup of the formula. Zephyr drinks, but it doesn't seem to have taken effect. Is he going to turn into a werewolf?
* Suddenly, a window cracks, and chairs start rattling! Zephyr runs outside to see what's up. Auster comes outside too. There's a purple aura around him. Zephyr has the same purple aura on his arm.
* A familiar figure starts to materialize! Zephyr is paralyzed, not out of fear, but shock
* It's the ghost of Zephyrus. Z2: "Lewis, I have business here. There's another loose end here, one I kept from you both. Nightquake is the only most recent member of their own legacy. Their predecessor is still out there, and wants their apprentice back."
* Z: "How are you here right now?" Z2: "My mentor's formula awakened my spirit. It awakens every spirit, but they're not all conscious any more."
* Auster, Zephyr, Zephyrus head inside. Auster made a ghost potion!
* A: "Mori is alive?" Z2 nods. Z: "Who the hell is Mori?" A: "Memento Mori is Nightquake's mentor, my old nemesis. Nobody is supposed to know about this. And he's supposed to be dead." Z2: "A shadow clone got killed, not the real him." Auster will need to process this.
* Zephyrus needs Zephyr to tie off this loose end, find & get Maury into jail. Where to start? Zephyrus walks Lewis out of the door. Very fast. Z2: "Start phasing NOW!" Off to the sanctuary!
* In the library, Zephyrus grabs tomes. Info on Memento Mori! Real name Terry Godfrey, janitor, boxer as a hobby.
* Lewis: "Thank you for choosing me." Z2: "You were the most reliable option. Plus I should be thanking you for doing this. Can't pass on without you doing this." Lewis: "I could have passed on the powers, but I like being Zephyr."
* Lewis heads back to the real world!
## Obligation!
* When time passes for Dallas... -> 8
* Heather broke her arm because Dallas wasn't around to supervise, is in cast, is using this to guilt Dallas into anything. Dallas & Alex found perfect affordable apartment? With the help of a scientist from the lab. Grady (named after the bartender from the Shining)
* Grady/Grando, Zephyrus/Zephyr, Marlum/Marlone, Nick Hel/Rick Heck... everyone has a close double!
* Suddenly we're not underground anymore, we get notifications from Lewis
* Aya answers the call! Where are we meeting? Don't come here, Dallas will freak out (we're outside his house). Laser Hawk is upset.
* Meet at Karaoke! M: "Are you gonna be okay Laser Hawk?" D: "Please don't teleport into my house again." M: "No control over that, but I'll do my best!"
## Tracking Memento Mori
* Z: "Melody, can you track an IP address?" M: "Can try..?" Zephyr passes over the Github page info. Melody tries to look stuff up -> 6!
  * Z explains to Melody about the formula, Nightquake, Maury, and how personal this is to him, +1 Team.
  * M: "I'll do everything I can to help you out." Z: "You're a good friend." M: "You're a good friend too."
* Posts from 4 years ago, a cryptic post that takes Melody ~10 minutes to decipher. Found someone "worthy" of the power - smuggling powers - illegal power trading. Recipient of the power was either Nightquake or a different candidate entirely.
* Can Nick track Memento Mori given some of his stuff? Probably. Zephyrus had a location for a house where they lived, but it got torn down & area turned into a mall. Road trip? Sure. Dallas wants good jerky, Lewis has some suggestions for South African food.
* In movies, road trips bring people together closer than ever! Melody's never gone on one!
* Zephyr looks for South African biltong -> 8. Prices are stupidly high, but he's got a bucket list. Dallas buys some too! "I'm gonna die, why not?" Melody doesn't need to eat, will join in. Nick: "You guys remember what happened last time I tried your food suggestions?"
* 20% of the mall is shopping, 80% is a totally full parking lot
* Who has a car? Fiona does. Can Dallas borrow the mini-van? Mom: "Do you remember your cousin?" D: "Yeah" Mom: "With a broken arm" D: "It adds character!" Mom: "This was your fault". Where are we going?
* Lewis: "Melody, you know the expression, puppy-dog eyes?" M: "What?" There's a phrase that lets you get whatever you want?! M: "We can practice puppy-dog eyes together!"
* M: "Why is it called puppy-dog eyes anyway, dogs don't look like that and we're not dogs!" L: "It's an expression." M: "Aren't puppies trained to listen to their owners?" L: "Some puppies train their owners."
* Meanwhile Dallas is dying on stage. Mom: "okay fine. But while you're there, Heather needs medication
* We'll go to the mall
* Nick texts his mom. "Whatever happens I love you" Anna: "?" Nick: "Going driving with Dallas." Anna: "That's no good!" Nick can't drive. But anyone would be better. Anna: "Did you try Marlone?" Nick: (lies) Anna: "stay safe."
## The Pharmacy
* Dallas tries to get prescription for Heather. No record of it...
* Dallas calls mom. Much confusion ensues. Call the doctor? No answer. Did villains attack the doctor's office.
* Lewis can run over to the doctor's office! He does so, picking up Nick...? Nick will help by teleporting through locked doors to get into the doctor's office -> 14
* There's nobody here. Huh. Look around for people! Nobody. Nick calls Dallas.
* Lewis will speed-read the records, Nick will try to find people telepathically.
* There's someone blocking off their emotions, hiding in a broom closet. Knocks on it. No answer. Nick: "Marco" No answer. Nick: "I'm gonna open it." Flicker of fear.
* Someone curled up in a ball, eyes closed. Nick: "I'm Nick.. you okay?" No answer, telepathy -> 10!
* Memory examination: mass exodus of everyone, except for this guy. For about 3 minutes, he was mind controlled but snapped out of it and armored themselves with apathy.
* "Guys we have a mind controller. Might be Bathsheba"
