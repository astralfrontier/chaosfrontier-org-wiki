* Good Doc knows where he was meant to go, can lead the way. On the path, another doctor appears, and stares at us!
* M: "Hello?" Bad Doc: "Hi. I work here." Dallas: "There were sick people who called but we got no answer" Bad Doc: "I was helping someone else" Dallas: "Why wasn't he at the phone?" M: "All your coworkers are missing"

* Outside, a nearby news anchor points out the battle! Cameraman focuses on the battle between Dallas & Radioactive
* Dallas panting, coughing from residual gas
* Elsewhere, Mom & Heather see Dallas!
* Elsewhere, on television, Torchbearer (Dallas's dad, thought dead, now amnesiac) sees his son
* Cameraman asks Dallas what's up, Dallas: "stay back, this guy's a villain". Cameraman doesn't get it, Dallas intervenes forcefully.
* Cameraman: "Who are you?" Dallas: (no mask) "Oh god"
* (Cut to Guerrera house) "he's a superhero?!"
* Dallas: "Yeah fuck it, I'm Laser Hawk" (rolls away on laser skateboard)
* Texts: "DALLAS, YOU'RE A SUPERHERO????" "DID YOU AT LEAST GET THE PILLS?!". Reply: "Yes"
* Nick is gonna teleport the group to the hospital, including Radioactive
## The Hospital
* Personnel at hospital see us, sigh.
* Dallas attempts a "light transfusion" to heal Melody -> 7, marks Guilty & Insecure
* Nick is gonna take Melody to her house & see about plugging her in
* Meanwhile, we check in Good Doc & get him seen by emergency room staff. Dallas takes charge.
* Kieran & Fiona are watching TV, Nick & Melody teleport in
* M: "What happened?" Nick: "Doc at hospital, I brought you home to patch you up"
* K & F blink. Nick: "sorry for showing up unexpectedly at house, I didn't bring anything"
* K: "What happened?" M: "To me? Went to doctor's office to get medication, villain at doctor's office, team fought villain, I protected him, and ... I powered down." K: "What happened?" M: "The gas, and the building falling, but everyone's okay!"
* Kieran examines Melody, who's physically okay. K looks at Nick. Nick: "Yes?" K: "Is she okay?" Nick: "Light transfusion, maybe she should rest for a bit?" Kieran: "let's take a look."
* M: "My diagnostics passed!" K: "Them passing is what worries me. Can you walk?" (Nick still carrying Melody)
* When Melody touches the ground, there's a spike of energy, like electrocution. Nick & Kieran both pick her back up immediately.
* Time for an examination!
## The Chew-Out
* Mom texts Dallas: WHO IS UNDER YOUR BED? DALLAS DALLAS DALLAS. Dallas: "I have to get the car back, but when I do I'll answer exactly FIVE questions." Mom: "WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR" Dallas: "Nothing, yet, I just need to get it back, that's one question by the way, now you're down to 4" Mom: "DALLAS YOU'RE GOING TO ANSWER EVERYTHING I ASK YOU - YOU'RE A SUPERHERO!!!!!!!"
* Dallas drives the car back.
* D: "heeeey. how's it going mom." Mom: "You have a lot to explain." D: "I love you, you're the best mom I could ever ask for."
* Mom: "You know what the life did to your father." D: "You can't bust this out so fast." Mom: "I can and I will. Why are you doing this to me?" D: "I'm tired of ignoring what happened. He did good, was proud of that fact. I couldn't not do anything either."
* Mom: "This is something you THINK you had to do. This puts you in danger! I saw how dirty you were! What happened? Some building came down on you. What if that doctor wasn't a supervillain?" D: "He was shooting poison gas at me." Mom: "HE SHOT POISON AT YOU"
* D: "I'm with a group of people who always have my back. What happened to dad isn't gonna happen to me. I have a team that cares about me, we keep each other safe." Mom: "Did team help you fighting that guy?" D: "Yeah" Mom: "Why weren't they with you?" D: "I pushed him through several walls, I overreacted, but he wasn't listening to reason."
* Mom: "Just because he wasn't listening, you pushed him through multiple walls?" D: "He made the people at the doctor's office disappear. It's your fault for sending me there." Mom: "How would I have known? A superhero would have known. You can't blame your mom! And why can't you trust the authorities?" D: "Normally I do. Laser Hawk is very responsible & smart about superheroing"
* Mom: "Do you always break everything in your way? Is THAT what the hammer's for?" Dallas: "I win because I break everything. You'll have to accept you can't understand this." Mom: "You can't understand how dangerous this is. You're breaking everything! Isn't someone going to break your bones? Do you want to die? Leave me behind?"
* D: "You met me at the bank. I'm doing good things. I know you don't want me in danger, but being alive is dangerous. In this city, I'd be in danger no matter what. 6 people with powers just at prom."
* D: "This city is dangerous. I'm not going to live afraid." Mom: "I'm always in danger, but I don't dress up & become a vigilante!" D: "You should, dad would like it."
* Dallas isn't gonna give this up, provokes -> 9. selfish team use! "I'm the leader of this team, they need me". Uses team selfishly to get superior up
* Mom blinks, sighs. "I'm taking the car & leaving." D: "Is it okay if Alex stays?" but Mom is leaving.
* Dallas: "Heather, how'd that go? Pretty good right?" H: "You need to learn how to talk to people better." (Goes to room)
* Dallas knocks on door, leaves medication outside.
* D: "Alex, you here?" Alex sitting on bed, waiting. A: "I agree with your cousin." D: "I'm gonna get outta here. See ya later."
* Alex grabs arm. "Where are you going?" D: "Dunno. Gonna ride my board, I guess." A: (silent look)
* At skate park, 4 young kids (3 boys 1 girl), Dallas rolls past, no engagement.
