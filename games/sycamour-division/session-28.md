# Session 28 (2019-11-16)
## The New Internship
* When Dallas outed himself as Laser Hawk, Abby saw it on YouTube & was like "oh that makes sense"
* While Dallas is sulking at the skatepark, suddenly it's Torchbearer!
* TB: "You're Laser Hawk right? On the news?" D: "I was, don't really know now." TB: "What's going on?" D: "It's complicated, you wouldn't understand."
* TB: "Whole reason I'm here is you being LH. You on TV was impressive, I see potential in you. I want you to be my apprentice, and I'll mentor you." D: "You a superhero or something?" TB: "I stay in the shadows. I'm Torchbearer."
* D: "Torchbearer died." TB: "That was another. The name is a legacy." D: "I don't think I like it. TB was really important to me. I don't think you can use his name."
* TB: "I'm sorry about whatever happened, how about befriending another Torchbearer? Eh this is going nowhere."
* D: "TB was the reason I started being a superhero. You shouldn't be the one to maintain his legacy. He was my dad." TB: "Do you think you're ready?" D: "I'm just some punk skater kid. But one day."
* TB: "Offer of mentorship is open. If you don't start working on it, you may never be ready."
* D: "I can't do this because you're stealing my dad's schtick. You're not my real dad." TB: "Never said I was your dad." D: "For me it's a very personal thing."
* TB: "There's many torches to bear. You could be a great torchbearer too." D: "..." TB: "I should let you think about this."
* Torchbearer pops off a cheesy dad line: "Later alligator." But it's something Dallas's dad said to him, and he remembers.
* What's this TB's name? Alden Guerrera. How does Dallas take this?
* D: "Are you messing with me right now?" TB: "What do you mean?" D: "That was my dad's name too. Is this Red Vox, Sycamour? What's up?" Pierce the mask -> 3
* TB: "I have nothing to do with any of this. You're sensitive about this, but no one is trying to get you. I'm just a guy who saw potential in you." Burns influence to mark Angry on Dallas
* Dallas goes to hit him in the face! He shakes his head - no sell. D: "Come on, aren't you gonna fight back?" TB: "I don't fight kids."
* Would TB's mask come off, revealing his face? Yes. Take a powerful blow! -> 9 (OOC Zephyr: "ever hit your dad so hard YOU felt it?")
* D gives ground. TB's face is burned or otherwise shows signs of damage, but is recognizably Alden. D: "Dad?"
* TB (staring): ".. What? I don't know what's going on...."
* D: "how can you be a mentor to me when you don't know what's going on?" provoke -> 11
* TB: "I can't explain anything with words." So he adopts a fighting stance on even footing. "I can just explain myself with fists."
* Dallas powers up his fists with light, takes a swing at TB. Torchbearer grabs hands, drains light out of them, pushes him back. "Is that all?"
* D: "I guess.. I'd like to see what you can do." TB: "I don't hurt kids. but.." He jumps forward, tying Dallas up with rope made of light, then jumps back to even footage. Dallas absorbs it -> 12
* Dallas tries to punch it back out again, TB effortlessly reflects it back. Dallas has the fever!

* Dallas tackles TB! TB forces even more light into Dallas, leaving him disoriented & numb
* TB: "All that was from what you gave me."
* TB: "If all you think about using your powers for is hitting people, how will you ever be the next Torchbearer?"
* Dallas has nothing to say about that... but he's interested

## Nick & Ayami

* Nick feels anxiety. Kieran is the best person to help Aya recover, but can he be trusted?
* Kieran has a battery that attaches to Ayami's chair
* Kieran needs Nick's help to focus Aya's energy into the battery. How does Nick do this? By controlling Aya's own powers through her mind.
* Aya's energy rushes into the battery. And then... Kieran: "step back." Battery explodes! K: "I thought something like this could happen eventually. If she'd woken up, she might have become the battery.
* Nick: "Being the battery would be bad.." K: "Don't do that again." Nick: "Not even sure what we did." K: "Don't store additional energy on her. Don't let her wake up confused."
* Melody wakes up! Joke's on Kieran, Melody's always confused. Nick: "You had some bad energy, we drained it into the battery, the battery exploded, you're fine." Melody: "Is this gonna be one of those things that we get confused about & comes back up?" Nick: "We'll shortcut to the end. Light transfusion was good in the short term but not in the long term."
* Melody: "will I blow up?" Nick: "No." M: "how did it feel to use my powers?" N: "Like changing the course of a river made of rainbows." M: "Let's try that sometime!" N: "That goes on the bottom of the list."
* Nick: "You feeling okay?" M: "Feeling fine. Don't know everything that happened. Where is Dallas?" N: "Good question"
* M: "Are YOU okay?" N: "Yes." M: "You sure?" N: "I didn't want you to worry." M: "NICHOLAI" N: "I worried about you, and I was worried about Kieran, but it all works out." M: "You were not okay because of me?" N: "That's what worrying is" M: (hugs!)
* Nick rambles about how we destroyed the building. M: "We?" Nick: "well it was me"
* M: "did you lose control of your powers?" N: "I was just really angry." M: "When you get angry, things happen around you" N: "Things happen around me no matter what I feel." M: "Things happen bigger because we're powers. More powers they have, the more things happen."
* Nick: "You blew up a battery, that was pretty cool" M: "Didn't know I could do that." N: "If we fight someone with Battery Control as a power, you're in good shape."
* M: "You got hurt worse than me." N: "?" M: "I was powered off. You had to worry about me. You want people to be safe. Everything that happened really upset you." N: "Yeah" M: "You do your best to keep everyone safe." N: "I feel safer with you, so I'm glad."
* Melody Comfort & Support! -> 7

## Zephyr

* Was out looking for the doctors who were at the clinic
* Gets texts from Auster that Dallas is outed. News vans are on the way! Z heads to the Guerrera house.
* Alex: "hi..?" Z: "Dallas has accidentally revealed his secret ID, we need to do something." A: "What should we do?" Z: "We need to keep people in the house safe from reporters & Sycamour" A: "His mom left. Don't know when." Z: "What sort of ghost are you if you don't know what people in your haunted house are doing?" A: "I don't invade other peoples' privacies." Z: "Sure"
* Z texts Dallas: "where would your mom be going right now?" No answer
* Is Dallas' cousin still here? Yes. Zephyr transforms into civilian, goes back to front door, knocks. No response. Heather is 11, she's not going to answer the door on her own. "I'm Dallas's friend Lewis"
* Z texts Alex: "this isn't working." A: "Just tell her in your outfit."
* Z transforms again, phases through front door, poses heroically.
* Heather walks out of her room. "I guess superheroes attract superheroes. Why do you want to see my aunt?"
* Z: "Dallas's secret came out in a big way. I need to make sure you're not going to be in danger or trouble." Heather: "why would we be in danger?" Z: "Have you met Dallas? Imagine him being like that, except to bad dangerous people." Heather: "...I get it."
* Meanwhile, Mom drove around for awhile & found an empty parking lot to cry in.
* H: "Probably Target parking lot" Z: "I'll check that out. if anyone else comes to the door, go to Dallas's room"
* Zephyr finds Dallas's mom in car. Knocks on window.
* Charlotte is angry crying. Z: "I'm Zephyr, friend of your son. You saw the news?" C: "what do you want?" Z: "Worried about people coming to your house in the near future. Offering somewhere to stay while things cool down."
* C: "Not only is my son a superhero, he's making me move out" Z: "It's for the best."
* C: "Where are you putting me?" Z: "Red Vox building, or my parents place, your choice" C: "I'm not going in a place full of superheroes." Z: "my parents' apartment then"
* Z: "here's my address, I'll be back with Heather, anything you need to grab from your place?" C: "My son." Z: "I'll let him know where you're staying. Drive safe."
* Zephyr returns. "I'm back" Heather: "Who's Lewis?" Z: (makes excuses) Heather opens the window & escapes.
* Z grabs her, Heather bites his hand. "You're Lewis!" "I said I'm Zephyr!"
* Alex appears. H: "Who is this?" Z: "The ghost that's been haunting your apartment?" H: "Dallas's dad?" Z: "No, I haven't met Dallas's dad."
* Where have Lucy & Grando been staying? Nick's house but they are moving out. Z wants to relocate.
* Where will Alex live? Discussion ensues
* Suddenly tires squeal!
