# Session 29 (2019-12-14)
## Rendezvous
* Last time we heard tires squealing. What's up? Knocking on the door! It's Begonias: "hey Dallas"
* Lewis: "Things are being handled in here, keep out." B: "I need something to be handled, do you have time?" L: "How urgent is it?" B: "Urgent enough that Marlone is in danger."
* Lewis lets her in
* B: "Get your friends, we're busting Marlone out of jail. Where is your base?" L: "No? Yeah? We have a place we hang out."
* There's a group chat for the team. Lewis will run Heather to his place, then fetch Alex. A: "You need help?" L: "Ish? Maybe?" Alex wants to come along. Lewis texts: "Meet at Begonias' house, Something Urgent, I think Marlone's in jail."
* Nick & Melody get text in the middle of C&S, can teleport to Begonias' house.
* B: "Have you seen the news? A jail got taken over by a group of criminals for use as a base of operations. Red Vox sent heroes. I surprisingly trust you more than your company."
* M: "That's not a surprise at all, that's America!" L: "How is the 2 month old more cynical than me?" M: "Fast learner" Nick: "Lewis, there's a promotion." L: "you ready to go save the day?"
## The Mission
* B: "Master of Puppets was supposed to be in the prison that was taken over. Nobody said anything about him being there. Done by Alex's people. Why would they do this right now?"
* M: "Wasn't that the plan on that USB drive Kieran had?" A: "Oh yeah." M: "It said: 'After werewolf army and giant robots. smh.'"
* B: "Going in guns blazing?" M: "When LH isn't here, that's not how we do things." B: "Why isn't he here?" M: "Don't know, was powered down." A: (shrugs)
* Nick: "I can ask my mom what we need!" L: "Heroes like Marlone went in, rescuing them should be priority 1 to help even the odds."
* Prison is at Main Street.

Mission Requirements:
1. You will need to figure out where they're all being held, so you're not blindly stumbling about.
2. You're also going to need to know who's guarding what portions of the prison at what times, for the optimal time to strike.
3. It's heavily recommended to get some kind of diversion or someone who can hack the prison cameras so that you all can make a clean escape.
4. You need to get the prisoners and some of the heroes out of Bathsheba's thrall (Unknown-- they need to figure out she's there).

* Nick can try to telepathically reach Marlone? From his office? Can Melody hack the prison cameras from the office too?
* The office: old car parts, plants. Engraved on one of his books, a symbol on his hand.
* Nick contacts Marlone telepathically -> 7, marks Guilty for poking at all his office stuff. When removing Alex's mental parasite, had a similar sensation. Marlone is infected. Need to be closer to remove it.
* Nick tries to read the situation through Marlone, but starts shaking, feels numb, falls to the ground. Why did it happen? Marlone is being subjected to this. (+1 forward vs Bathsheba)
* Meanwhile Melody will start hacking! -> 7
* Meanwhile Zephyr knows the basics of who's in there. Will get access to all cameras at once. Assess the Situation -> 7
* Begonias has blueprints for the prison: solitary confinement, etc. Gym has a door leading to "something". The normal cells. The group could be in either of these places. Nick: "Marlone was underground." Can't be solitary or the gym. Nick texts mom. She doesn't know anything underground in a prison in this state. Something hidden. "Is this about the prison Begonias was talking about?" Nick: "Maybe" Anna: "God dammit. Why are you gong to prison?" Nick: "The fuzz busted me for my illegal book habit." Anna: "Don't break it." Nick: "I won't."
## Infiltration
* Alex: "Should we do recon?" Storm tunnels, subway lines? City plans? Not much underground there.
* Time to head to the prison!
* Alex: "what's the plan?" Nick suggests Melody, Zephyr, Alex all use phasing to scout underground, stays in telepathic contact with them & Begonias. We'll jump in immediately if anything goes wrong.
* Last time Alex went in alone. A: "you let me go alone." Nick: "Not any more."
* Time to phase! Melody unleashes powers -> 8
* Melody's phasing: she becomes desolid, fully holographic.
* There's a secret hallway underneath the prison. Alex is sticking inside the walls, trying to avoid being seen.
* Ahead along the hallway there's an archway into another room
* Nick & Begonias teleport in as well. Nick tries to telepathically locate Marlone. He's that way - toward the door.
* Alex checks it out: "Two people, and probably a camera." Melody can disable the camera. Via Nick, does Zephyr remember the people?
* [Absinthe](https://i.imgur.com/ystzCPQ.jpg) and [Knuckle Bomber](https://i.imgur.com/m73zJ8A.jpg)
* We can tag-team them: Zephyr suffocates KB's fiery fists, Nick & Melody negate Absinthe's illusion and sound powers, Begonias keeps him pinned down.
## Jailbreak
* Enter battle as a team: Nick leads, has influence over everyone, not unprepared, nobody mistrusts Nick, same purpose. 5 team!
* KB: "Least we're getting something to do." Absinthe readies knife. There's mouth movement but no speech.
* Melody assesses the situation. Cage, nothing inside it, more doors, camera pointed at the cage. Time to roll! -> 9. Nick's telepathic link kicks in 1 team.
  * How could we best end this quickly? Interrupt Ab's incoming sonic attack.
  * What here is in the greatest danger? Marlone & 3 other heroes are on the ground
* Melody will do a huge sonic wave at Absinthe! Directly engage -> 9, Nick spending team to let her amplify sonic powers with his own TK
  * Create opportunity for allies
  * Resist/avoid blows
* Zephyr unleash powers -> 7, marks condition! Suffocates Knuckle Bomber. This could be a lethal technique - these powers in the wrong hands are terrifying.
* KB hits the ground, making it difficult to concentrate. Melody gives ground to avoid damage.
* Begonias opens book and chants, locking Knuckle Bomber's arms in place as he swings at Melody.
* Absinthe runs to stab Begonias
* Nick tries to read the emotions of the room -> 4
* Nick Burns -> 7, Reality Storm vs. Absinthe -> 9, doing a big fat AOE attack on the whole area Absinthe is, Zephyr +1 team by feeling the wind (2 burn left)
  * Resist or avoid blows
  * take something from him (knife)
* KB: "Absinthe, come on!" - gets out of the gravity bonds as Begonias flinches, attacks Nick
* Melody intercepts -> 9, Nick pummels with rocks for +1 team. Body-checks the big guy.
* The room is quiet....?
* Nick moves to strip the mental parasite out of the prisoners.
  * https://imgur.com/a/Fa87cxr - first one is knocked out, others had parasite
  * Only one waking up is the girl with the serpent
* Snakegirl: "who are you?" M: "I'm Melody! I don't know what happened, can you tell us, are you okay?"
* SG: "What happened to the others?" M: "I don't know." Z: "We're here to break you guys out, heard your prison plan didn't go so well."
* SG's hair turns into the head of the snake, which takes hold of Marlone.
* Are they in condition to keep fighting? They're unconscious. We should take the heroes + the 2 villains. Nick will teleport the crew to Red Vox HQ, spends 2 remaining burn
* What are we doing now? Come up with an idea for the next plan of action.
* It's nearly midnight - it's been a long day.
* Nick sends a selfie with the rescuees to Anna. "Feeling psychic, might use TK later". Nick owns up to breaking the prison to Anna - consequences later!
