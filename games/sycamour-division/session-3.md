# Session 3
* Question about Janus's "The Mask" move: does it automatically reset? (no)
* Leaving Red Vox HQ. We're off for the day & getting paid, because we stopped a bank robbery.
* Melody's phone rings - it's her caretaker Fiona.
* Problem paying rent, Fiona wants Melody to go to some other bank. Are the other PCs going along?
* We're still in costume, Nick doesn't know LH's identity.
* Zephyr staying behind. Bill suggests GM write a love letter for Zephyr where Marlone reveals something about his Legacy's connection to Red Vox.
* Bank is new, created/managed by a new company called Muddy Water

* We're spotlighted on a big tv outside the bank
* People let us in. LH's mother is in line to pay a bill. LH's excuse for being out: "my internship". Juggling obligations to use as excuses.
* Laser Hawk is pretty confident he's still incognito. So he goes to check out what Mom is doing. There's talk of unpaid bills, LH is suspicious and wants to assess the situation -> 10
* Cashier is clearly lying. Bank literally came into being yesterday.
* LH confronts the cashier. Cashier says "bank was expensive" - basically admits they stole his mother's money.
* LH is unhappy about this, provokes -> 10. "Let me call my superiors, we'll try to resolve this."
* Nick sidles over, Melody stands behind him. "This feels like a scam."

* Manager oozes over. "Oh, no, she made a donation to us." LH: "you should give back what you stole."
* LH .. assesses the situation again? -> 8. Best way to end this: call the authorities.
* Nick wants to read the feeling for the bank, Burns -> 2
* There's a feeling of "Sycamour" here. Evil sensation. Less of a physical threat, more of an economical threat.
* 1 Burn on elemental awareness: is there physical danger here? Yes. The room was a trap. Vibrations far below.
* Nick describes the feeling as a giant serpent coiled around the people in here. He is shaken (mark conditions).
* LH: what if we text Marlone about this?
* LH's mom storms into our huddle. "I didn't ask for your help, I just wanna pay my bills."
* LH: "I'm gonna fix this." Game Face, mark Angry.
* Mom: "Get _everyone_'s money." LH: "Geez mom." Nick: "Everyone matters."
* LH: What next? Nick: Call the cops. Calls Detective Mom to narc on the bank.
* LH texts Marlone. M: Will investigate l8r. LH: We may have already called the police. M: Are you insane? LH: We know a good cop. We'll make sure justice is served.
* Mom: What's going on? Nick: relays info. Why aren't you solving it? Nick: because I trust you.
* Manager has a fake smile, nothing's wrong.
* LH: What's the status on that money for this lady? Manager: it's getting there.
* Nick: What's vibrating? Manager: ... nothing. Nick: there's something under the bank.
* Nick: this is a con, but you're really bad at this part of the job.
* Most people have left the bank in the interim, only a few people here. Manager runs off.
* LH assesses for a third time -> 11. Biggest threat: Sycamour. End this quickly: wait for Marlone & Detective Anna Hel.
* Nick: Melody, if you don't pay up, what happens? Melody: not sure. doesn't have to be right away. Texts Fiona: something is suspicious about bank, don't want to give them the money.
* Marlone & Anna Hel show up. Comedy option: Anna cites Marlone for speeding in his super-car.
* Nick: Mom doesn't like a superhero butting in on superhero business? Yep, everything's normal.
* Manager shows up with gun. LH: you're gonna want to put that down. -> 14
* Manager has demands: "everyone must leave now"
* Nick grabs crucifix, spends 1 burn on Moat, Manager opens fire, they are caught by the TK barrier.
* LH grabs gun away, breaks it, Manager tries to book it.
* Melody creates a tripwire of light, grabs him, he falls.
* LH tries to ziptie manager, he phases out.
* Speakers emerge from video cameras to taunt us. "Manager did a good job covering his tracks. Invest in anti-bomb insurance."
* LH wants to check out the room. Melody: it's a trick. LH: Marlone, want to check out the room?
* Nick picks up the gun to read impressions off it -> 8. Mark a condition -> Angry. It was a hologram, some kind of automated. Manager was some kind of AI, somewhat primitive.
* Nick is angry, heads for manager's office. Burn -> 8, Mark Afraid. 
* Explosion! Nick marks 2 burn to unleash powers on 10+
* Enter battle as a teamm. Who's leading? Nick. No one mistrusts, he has influence.
* More traps, guillotine, etc.
* In the office, fried paperwork, scattered by the blast. Not much is left. There's another door, Nick goes through.
* A big-ass hole leading directly to evil underground laboratory.
* We head down, Nick falls down some trick stairs.
* Lab is full of high-tech tools. Interesting high-tech weapons.

* Marlone and Melody head down the hole to the lab
* LH assesses the situation yet again -> 8. What here is the biggest threat? Weapons, robots, etc.
* There's a control center. Gigantic keyboard. Melody comes over to investigate. "Nick, hold my hand."
* Nick gets a vision of a man - her creator. 
* "Sycamour Man" - giant red and white bodysuit, Sycamour Logo on his face, like PepsiMan.

* Nick: "there's stuff I can do, and stuff only you can do. Maybe this is one of them."
* Melody will try to connect to the console & try to plug into the system. -> 9, +1 Team from Nick supporting her
* Melody gets a read on where everything is. The drilling is happening to our left, a hidden door. She marks out the locations of everything & hand it to the team.

* LH marks Guilty - it's taken far too long to get this situation in hand
* Someone comes down the stairs. Nick goes to check it out. It's Anna. She's pissed she had to get herself down the hard way.
* The drilling is still going on. Things start to shake.
* LH: "how do we stop this?" Manager: "give Sycamour money." Provoke -> 6, +1 Team from Melody
* Just push the button, Frank. The drills shut down.
* LH: Marlone, this was a win for you, we couldn't have done it without you.
* We take the "scenic route" out. Right before we leave, we see a bunch of robot suits malfunctioning.
