# Session 30 (2019-12-28)

> Dear Dallas,
> Your dad kept his promise, and train you he did. Roll me + Superior to see how much info you actually absorbed, though. On a hit, choose one. On a 10+, choose two.
> * "You want to learn that trick I used against you when you fought me? Alright. But this won't be as effective as it was against you, unless you're fighting someone with the same powers as you." Your dad taught you how to do that 'forcing light into others' thing, and he taught you pretty well. You can know channel light into a person's body, causing them to feel lightheaded for a bit, or maybe worse, depending on the matchup. Additionally, how did you overcome your dad's defenses against that tactic?
> * "Light can literally cause a lot of damage to the eye, but it can also do it in a less permanent way. You just have to learn how to take light in the proper way." You and Torchbearer both fucked around in his training grounds, and he taught you how to mischieve an opponent using optical illusions. What does that actually do, and how did you prank your dad after mastering it?
> * "You know, focusing solely on your offensive capabilities can only get you so far. You need to look at the other side of the coin, too." Your dad looked at your skateboard and came up with the idea that, if you can make a skateboard out of light, you can probably make some kind of defensive tool out of it too. What tool can you easily make now, and how did you manage to give it an offensive application that Torchbearer didn't think about?
> On a miss, training hasn't gone well. Torchbearer keeps trying to make you more utility focused when, in reality, all you're good at is breaking things. Shift your Superior up and Mundane down regardless, as his words are seeping into how you act.

* LH rolls a 7. Third option! Skater armor with built-in photocells, based on tech developed at the internship lab.

## Recap of Dallas comic

* Ding! An elevator is seen ascend to a dark room, only lit by the faint glow of computer screens and whatever tech is inside this place.
* "We're here." Torchbearer says, as he begins walking inside his base. It seems to have a lot of those high-tech things, almost reminding you of Red Vox's own things, though the make and model are clearly different than the one RV uses. The place looks well-funded, and he's obviously familiar with it, considering he's walking over to a keyboard connected to a large LED screen that is currently off.
* "Just... Give me a few to get these all ready."
* Dallas looked around and saw the hidden base and saw all the trappings he had expected: the chem lab, the super computer, the plate with a half finished ham sandwich. If was all there, exactly like his mom had described his dad's old lair.
* "Da--I mean, Torchbearer, how'd you get all of this stuff?" Dallas asked, cringing at the misstep.
 * He thinks for a little bit. "Well, you know. Scrounged up some money, bought the latest tech in the superhero industry, and bam. Easy as that."
* You see the TV turn on. It takes a little time to actually turn on, and, while it's loading, you see a big Life Force in the middle of the television, probably the brand of the TV.
* "Why?"
* "I guess I just wondered how you do it... The whole double life thing? Unless you don't? I'm sorry, I don't know you're situation I guess... How long have you been superhero-ing for?" Dallas responded.
* "Oh, I don't bother with the double life thing. It's too much work, personally. Plus, there's no reason to do it! I don't have anyone close to me that can be attacked."
* "And..." He puts his hand on his chin and thinks. "I've probably been doing this for some ten or fifteen years. This is my life." You see the TV actually load now, it seems to be in some sort of private database, and your dad is scrolling through some names, trying to find something.
* Dallas peered over at the database and tried to see just what Torchbearer was doing. "So whats going on here, we just going to look at funny youtube videos or are we going to do some superhero work?"
* Torchbearer pulls up image:

* Gamma Knife, an evil scientist. Basic notes on him: hideout location, clues on where he might strike next, etc. T: "We're gonna catch this guy once and for all." D: "He does _look_ evil." T: "He'd capture & torture live animals for science." D: "Looks untrustworthy." T: "Lead on his next target. He hasn't been in his hideout for 2 weeks, he found a new one."
* D: "How do we track him down?" T: "Raid new hideout. He won't have set up defenses yet." D: "I have a team." T: "Father-son bonding moment." D: "Sounds good."
* D's new armor can manifest from his belt. "HENSHIN"

## Parent problems

* Nick is being talked to by his mother about breaking the prison. He's not quite grounded but he's under heavy scrutiny. Mom is not happy. (+Freak -Superior)
* Aya will talk to Fiona: how does she feel about the Kieran situation?
* F: "It's me" A: "Come in, what's up?" Aya is busy scrapbooking about recent events
* Furniture? Aya's chair, plus a couple other chairs, table, etc. - no bed. F: "Is it alright if he stays there?" A: "Who stays where?" F: "Kieran, if he stays here." A: "With us?"
* F: "he called outta nowhere, it's weird, I understand how you feel." A: "We're heroes, we have to help people." F: "Don't have to put yourself out for everyone all the time" A: "?" F: "If someone makes you uncomfortable, and you want them out, talk to me." A: "Team tells me I don't have to do anything I don't want to do!"
* F: "So he's alright then?" A: "Seems to be okay. Worried." F: "This came out of nowhere"
* Aya doesn't understand a lot, thinks Kieran is doing his best, she is too.
* F: "Kieran can get in your head." A: "Nick can too!" F: "Not what I meant. Glad you are okay with it." A: "Kind of curious about who he is. Teammates seem to trust him. Maybe I'm too suspicious."
* F: "Did he say why he took the deal from Sycamour?" A: "He needed the money." F: "Not the whole reason. He's obsessed with making robots." A: "Is he going to build robots here? Are my sisters going to be living here?" F: "If he gets that kind of money, it's possible."
* F: "Isn't that kind of strange? The impulse to make life?" A: "Don't understand it, but I want to be a hero really badly, so I get what it's like to really want _something_"
* Fiona shifts +Savior -Danger, Aya accepts the shift
* A: "Whatever happens is going to work out. … Hey Fiona? Thank you. I don't always tell you what's going on, I'm always doing other stuff, but thanks." F: "if I wasn't used to that, I wouldn't be Kieran's sister."
* Fiona takes off, back to scrapbooking!

## Knuckle Bomber talks

* Marlone calls… who? Zephyr first, but Z's player isn't here right now. He calls Nick.
* M: "Do you have time?" N: "If this is your one phone call from prison, don't waste it." M: "Why would I be in prison?" N: "Some folks rescued you right..?" Anyway, Nick will contact the team & say to rendezvous with Red Vox.
* D texts: "Side mission! Will get with you guys later." N: "Enjoy your date with Alex, we'll be fine."
* Nick & Aya show up. Marlone is waiting. M: "Where are the other two?" N: "Dallas is on a date, Lewis looking for a date." A: "He said side mission? Is he pranking us?" Nick recounts all the times Dallas has lied. A: "ohhhhh. We'll have to ask him how it went!"
* Marlone: "You know Master of Puppets?" A: "We pinned him to a wall, was supposed to go to prison." We have to retrieve him again…. Marlone has some leads.
* Marlone: "Need your specific help, Nick. Knuckle Bomber not doing well, I know why?" We're escorted to the cell. KB is unconscious at 1pm.
* Nick will try to reach him telepathically. He's got a bud on him. KB's parasite is a lot weaker than the one from Alex. KB immediately wakes up, disoriented.
* Nick: "Hi." KB: "Where am I?" A: "Prison!" KB: "I'm not in the right one." A: "There's a wrong prison?" KB: "Supposed to be in the other prison, not Red Vox."
* Nick: "you had a mental parasite that was controlling you. Whatever you can tell us would be great." KB: "Bathsheba planted a bud in the whole prison, turned us into pawns, to impress her boyfriend." Marlone: "Marlum." KB: "Yeah."
* KB: "She didn't pay us." Nick: "Who got budded?" KB: "_Everyone_.
* KB: "You friends with MoP?" Nick: "Nooo?" A: "We know him." KB: "He got out, I drove him to some place underneath a factory type building." A: "Wasn't under a bank was it?" KB: "Yep" A: "WHY IS IT ALWAYS A BANK"
* KB: "she took us to this place, robots/puppets under construction. Factory beneath a building. How often does that happen?" A: "This is at least the second one." KB: ? A: "YOU HEARD ME"
* Nick telepathically pulls the location from KB's mind -> 8, marks Afraid: "how are we going to stop Bathsheba now?"
* MoP & company have turned this place into a base of operations, Nick has the location
* Nick texts address & context to Dallas. Too bad it's already where he's going. Nick: "can you cancel your date or bring Alex along?"
* Dallas: "we were headed there, we can coordinate" N: "Sounds good, see you there"
* Aya: "factory full of villains is a strange place for a date." N: "Anywhere works for a date"
* Alex texts Dallas: "you guys don't take many breaks" Dallas: "Saving up for vacation"

## It's Always Sunny in Halcyon

* Brief time skip to factory! Dallas is already there. We also wait for Alex.
* Alex: "who's the old dude" Dallas: "Torchbearer, my new mentor. He's gonna help us out."
* M: "Hi Torchbearer, nice to meet you!" T: "Hey." M: "If you're his mentor, you should teach him how ovens work, he has interesting misconceptions about cake."
* Torchbearer: "..."
* Alex: "Time to fight bad guys?"
* Melody: "Why did you invite your mentor on your date?" Dallas: "It was never a date. Always fighting bad guys. Speaking of, who's your bad guy?"
* Melody: "still Master of Puppets, who we pinned to the wall" Dallas: "Cliff" T: "Cliff?" Dallas: "He's our favorite year-long villain."
* Melody: "Who's your bad guy?" T: "Gamma Knife. Didn't know he worked with other villains." Melody: "who's that?" Dallas: "He tortures cats." T: "Doesn't actually. Mad biologist."
* Who was responsible for the werewolf heroin? Probably MoP. He was also responsible for the power transfer surgery, according to Alex.
* Melody: "MoP is your father?" Alex: "He'd try to make us join the Dark Side of the Force." Dallas: "Alex's father is Begonias according to school paperwork." Some discussion about why you never let Dallas fill out paperwork.
* T: "Let's get to the mission. Is this normal for you?" Dallas, Melody: "Yep" T: "The hammer.. Right. Why do you have a hammer?" D: "Why do YOU have a hammer?" T: "I ordered it." D: "I stole mine." T: "WHAT?" D: "Took without permission." T: "FROM WHERE" D: "Another villain I beat up."
* Torchbearer looks at Nick. Nick: "That's all accurate."
* T: "Let's just do this, we'll talk later."
* D will use powers to search for people on floors, unleash -> 4. Accidentally turns on all the lights. "They might know we're here."
* Torchbearer: "We're doing this the hard way" Heads inside. Dallas behind him. Alex, Melody, Nick follow at a more sedate pace.
* Dallas finds a book. Torchbearer is wary of it. Looks like something Gamma Knife uses?
* As Dallas approaches, book magnetizes itself to his hammer. Footsteps approaching - MoP? Dallas throws his hammer!
* Boytoys! Upgraded! They're now Mantoys!

* Mantoys are slashing at the hammer! It's taking damage! D: "Get away from my favorite hammer!"
* Dallas is going to directly engage, with extra option -> 8, give an opportunity. Takes hit through the armor. Push it to the limit, monkeybeer! -> 4. Take a powerful blow -> 7, lash out verbally to provoke Torchbearer into action? "Want to clear these puppets out before I got cut in half, that'd be awesome"
* Torchbearer goes FUCKING PAPA BEAR. Hammer handle hits Dallas.
* Nick: "Dallas, you okay?" Dallas: "I got more than one stomach. I can heal fast."
* Alex: "Don't you think we should do some first aid?" Torchbearer does, but someone has to be a distraction. Nick: "I'll take care of that." Melody & Alex will follow.
* MoP appears! New suit. "You guys found me quickly." He shoots something behind him, the beam of energy is arcing at the team. Nick burns -> 12, Moat (1 burn) to block it by tearing up the factory nearby.
* Melody takes the opportunity to assess the situation -> 9, Alex spends team to get 10
  * How can we best end this quickly? Strip him of gauntlet. Tied to a light-source.
  * Who here is in the greatest danger? A rogue puppet squad heading toward Dallas
* Melody will warn Dallas & use powers to highlight the puppets. Defend -> 8
* Alex is going after Master of Puppets.
* Nick uses Snatch to remove the gauntlet, but it's pretty well attached & deals a lot of pain to MoP.
* Dallas deals with remaining puppets -> 15. Impress, surprise, frighten.
* MoP is turning monstrous/old/something? Eyes changing color, hair turning white. Book goes flying toward MoP. Big runic circle knocks Alex back.
* It's secretly Gamma Knife!

## Moment of Truth

* Nick's second Moment of Truth: reach out mentally to half of Halcyon, giving them a chance to daydream briefly about what Sycamour's takeover would really mean for them. He'll feed this back into Master of Puppets' mind, hopefully breaking him with the truth of revelation.
  * Marlum & his friends seems well-intentioned but their plan is naive, corruptible, incompetent
  * Real stories of real people push back against his ability to deny reality
* Turns out Gamma Knife was going to betray MoP. "I'm gonna get outta here". Nick: You're going nowhere, chuckles.
* Dallas, to Torchbearer: "you're in charge, what do you think?" T: "We can't let this guy get away."
* Gamma Knife restrained with hammer.
* Nick: "We gotta go get Cliff." T: "You did something to him?" Nick: "I told him a story."
* Alex knocks out Gamma Knife

## Retrieval

* Nick teleports to MoP's control room. He's trying to process. Nick: "We're gonna go rest now." MoP doesn't resist.
* Gamma Knife is out. Dallas: "Book him". 
* Nick gets a text from Marlone: "Wow". Nick: "does that mean a raise or am I fired?"
* Teleport to HQ. Torchbearer won't come along.
* Snake girl is here. Everyone knows what happened. It's gonna be on the news.
* Marlone running to HQ. "Again. Wow. Oh. You caught Cliff." Nick: "uh yeah"
* Nick: "so I wanna talk about the vacation offerings…?"
* Maybe Cliff here will help us out with that. Cliff will do that, he was wrong. Nick: "We still want your advice on how to make things better." Discussion on whether Nick is being silly or will be going to jail.
* Marlone: "I'll look after you Nick." Nick: thumbs up.
* Nick: "Dallas, you were wrong. Aya & I are boyfriend & girlfriend." Aya kisses him!
