* We have to do a presentation in 2 weeks on how superheroes have changed the world we lived in. Teacher side-eyes Nick & Dallas. Teams of 4.
* Nick & Dallas will immediately team up. Aya: "how useful will I be on this?" Nick: "You have a unique perspective." Lewis: "You're hooked up to the Internet." Aya: "when I go on the net, there's a lot of problems." L: "That's most peoples' experience."
* Alex was going to join our group but it's full. Going to work with Jeremy & Lucy. Vanya will be the fourth member, to extract all the gossip about us from the Children.
* Other members form groups. There's one person working alone. He's a guitarist in a band. Gary. He received a guitar from the heavens.
* Someone's going to mention superheroes in media (Dallas) & the side effect of superpowers (Nick)
* Lewis: what about another angle? Every day a villain destroys research & tech, or starts fires, but because supers exist, technology is progressing. ("Do your internship")
* Aya: if tech depends on supers, I wouldn't exist. Dallas: we probably can't write that. Aya: but it's probably true if he's right?
* Nick: expectations society places on superheroes? We all have something to say.
* Online personality quiz for Aya? Doesn't she know her own personality? Maybe not.
* Dallas: Philosophy means everything you say is true! Nick: you're complaining about getting bad grades in here.
* Nick: beating up villains is easier.
* Aya: If everything is right & everything is wrong, why are we in class? D&L: That's right. Aya: That has nothing to do with superheroes. Dallas: it does because we're superheroes. Discussion about this.
* Dallas thinks anything we say is automatically on topic. Aya disagrees.
* Does anyone watch MHA? Dallas & Aya does, Zephyr is literally Deku.
* Aya: heroes do more good than harm right? Dallas: that's numbers, not philosophy. Discussion of math & philosophy.
* Aya: but there's more good than bad people right? L: how many villains are there vs. how many heroes? How many villains did we just fight? Aya: but we're winning! L: That's not the original question.
* Nick thinks people are really just trying to figure themselves out & most people are a mess. Analogy to splashing a canvas with multicolored paint.
* Lewis: can we just turn in a picture?
* Nick suggests creating a painting from a gestalt of social-media comments, interviews with people, etc. Or Zephyr can recreate the "A New Hope" poster.

## The Bunnies

* Dallas will offer people to meet with him! Aya will trawl the Internet.
* Bunny Brigade has been super awkward around Nick & Dallas
* Nick will go talk to them. The team will come along too! At lunch.
* Nick: can we sit here? Bruno: ..............Sure. Aya: Thanks!
* Nick makes things 800% more awkward. "Hey we mighta been a little evasive about things last time." Dallas: "I'll tell Alex about you guys to make fun of you though."
* Nick: being a hero takes a lot of commitment, it can be rough & dangerous, are you sure you want in? Bruno: We want to do it, screw danger.
* Marie: why care about danger? Lewis: how would friends & family react to you getting seriously hurt? Marie: they'd be proud that we're saving people.
* Bruno's not making eye contact. Lewis: Got something to add? Bruno: uhhhhhh L: Pierce the Mask -> 8
  * What do you want me to do? Stop talking about family
* Nick: you want to be a hero as you understand it, but do you know everything that's part of the job? Bruno: We know. Why do you guys do it? Lewis: hero complex & survivor's guilt.
* Marie: I can answer it! Nick: Go ahead. Marie: Save people & have people look up to me. Others agree.
* Nick: school is collapsing. Save people. Marie: I'd bone armor, make sure debris aren't falling on people. Bruno: grab as many people as I can, get them out. Lucas: trying his best.
* Nick: Lucas? Lucas: try to find out who made it happen. Nick: maybe earthquake, who knows. You don't need powers to be a hero. Do you want to save people, or use your powers in cool ways?
* Lewis: want to help people? Head down to the beach, become a lifeguard.
* Nick uses telepathy to find out how genuine their interest is. Their desire to help is pretty honest.
* Nick is going to give them contact info at Red Vox. When someone wants to be a hero, but doesn't know how, the next step is training. Dallas: being bad heroes isn't an excuse not to try & be good heroes. Aya: nobody knows everything, you gotta learn somehow.
* Nick: you could also use your invisible powers to strobe & get peoples' attention, then direct traffic to emergency exits.
* Bunnies: we'll try our best.
* We learned a lesson for our class too! Superheroes inspire people.

## Children of the Night

* Find them between classes
* Nick: heeey. Jeremy, Lucy wave. Alex: heeey. Dallas: heeey.
* Nick: we referred the Bunnies to Red Vox. They might see you soon at work.
* Jeremy grins big. "I'm gonna be a mentor." Nick: (thinking) "you're already mental"
* Nick: "If so great, you'll do a good job." Lewis: "You do? I mean yeah, sure."
* J: You're not enthusiastic about this. Aya: the paper? No. J: About the Red Vox thing!
* J: "I'm gonna be a father figure! Right Lucy?" L: ".... Yeah" Aya: "I didn't know you were a father!"
* J: "when I do get a kid, they're gonna be the best kid ever!"
* Nick: "if you're gonna be a mentor, maybe go talk to them?" J: "I'm hype." Aya-logic means she's right about him talking to them!
* Aya gets a lot of advice from Dallas. Means Dallas is right a lot too. She's more often left than right, more often right than wrong.
* J: "While you're here, what are you doing about the philosophy thing?" D: "We're gonna tell a story with a picture." J: "Is that allowed?" Dallas: "Teacher didn't make a rule about it."
* Aya: "as long as I follow the rules I can do what I want!" Nick: "I know I told you that but it sounds iffy when you put it that way." Nick avoids another Aya-logic trap.
* Nick & Aya are a new brand of strange, per Jeremy. Aya: "Thank you!"
* OOC note: Gary will wield both guitar & ukelele, playing a polka with both
* Much discussion about nonsense

## After School

* Mom told Dallas to quit, but he hasn't. Family has rejected him - have they moved? Would they tell him where? At least, family isn't talking.
* Mom is staying at a hotel until all this blows over. She's keeping the house.
* What's going to happen with Caesar? We don't know yet.
* Lewis has hit his social quota for the day. Is going to go for a run & head into sanctuary. (player will be out for next few sessions)
