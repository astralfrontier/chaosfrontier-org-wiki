# Session 32 (2020-01-11)

* Only Nick & Melody's players are around for this session

## School shenanigans!

* On the way to class, Aya passes by Sophia (of Sports Club). Sophia: (sigh of relief) "Can we both talk?"
* Sophia: (whispering) "You know that Gary guy from your class?" A: "The one who didn't group up?" S: "Laura wants to know him better. Hook a sister up by getting him to join our team." A: "I'll try"
* Aya finds Gary in a gym. "Hi!" G: (nods)
* A: "there's a group that--" G:

* G: "I do stuff alone." A: "Don't you want to do stuff with friends?"
* Aya drops Aya-logic on Gary. G: "My only friend is my guitar" A: "What's your guitar's name?" G: "ASHBRINGER" A: "I'm glad you at least have one friend, but others would be glad to know you and Ashbringer."
* Gary tries to Pierce the Mask but bounces off Aya. G: "Is this a prank?" A: "No! I know pranks, nobody would find this funny." G: "I disagree." A: "What's funny about this?" G: (writes something down on a notepad)
* A: "There are people who want to be friends with you. Talk to them, see if it's mutual?" G: "If they want to be friends with me, they should talk to me, not send a courier." A: "Maybe they're afraid you'd shut them down too. Other people can be nervous too." G: "They should still try. Why be nervous if you aren't going to overcome it?" A: "They should have tried, but I'm trying to be a good friend by helping."
* A: "You going to talk to her?" G: "Depends on how I feel." (strums guitar, no sound)
* A: "Can I come back too if I bring her with me?" G: "uhhhhh. Sure, whatever." A: "BRB"
* Aya spam-texts Laura saying "come out here" Laura: ".... Please wait."
* Laura jumps out the second floor window nearby and books it. Aya tries to intercept -> 7
* Teacher & a bunch of students notice this going on. Aya remembers Lessons: smile and wave (+Savior -Superior). Teacher: (pulling hair) "Are you crazy?". Laura thanks Aya, gets set down.
* A: "that looked dangerous." L: "It's fine." (winks) Heads toward Gary. Teacher: "Gary go to class!" Gary strums guitar again.
* Aya introduces Laura & Gary in her own Aya-ish way. Aya hangs out waiting. Gary: "you can go now... Hi Laura." Laura waves. A: "My work here is done! Have a great day!"
* Meanwhile Nick is laying low.

## After school

* It's been 5 days since Nick did his city-wide mindsweep. We have 4 hours to slack around!
* Nick is in witless protection. Aya shows up at the front door, via rollerskates. Nick pulls her into the house after glancing around real fast.
* A: "something going on?" N: "I mindlinked half the city." A: "this is the booklight but a lot more people and they feel strange about that?" N: "Yep."
* A: "Why hide in your house?" N: "Because it would be awkward. I can hide as long as it takes." A: "you can't hide in your house this way." N: "If the house doesn't work I can hide somewhere else." A: "Are you running away?" N: "I just want to make people less awkward." A: "Grando said we were both strange & weird, I make people feel awkward too. Just because people don't know how to react to you, you didn't do something wrong."
* N: "I don't think I did it wrong. But sometimes doing the right thing comes at a price." A: "This isn't the right thing." N: "Where would you like me to go?" A: "Any normal places?" N: "I like my house." A: "You also like the library." N: "If it makes you feel better, I'll go to the library."
* A: "Are you feeling like that's going to make someone else feel bad?" N: "I'm doing the thing that'll stop making you feel bad, I'll go to the library."
* A: "But... I know you worry, is there something I can do to help you worry less?" N: "Go with me?" A: "Sure." N: "Let me get my disguise kit & I'll be ready to go!"
* Nick dons the MCU disguise kit: baseball cap and sunglasses. A: "Isn't a hat rude in the library?" N: "I'll only wear it on the way."
* On the way, plastered on a streetlight, we see: "CULT OF MIND MELDING". Picture of a mush of brains piled together. "Join us at Gravity Street #135". Nick will mindshare the feelings of the poster author with Aya.
* The author feels an immense infatuation with Nick. Someone obsessed with the idea of Nick.
* A: "It seems like they were rather impressed." N: "That's one word for it." A: "They spent a lot of time thinking about this." N: "And they put strong feelings into it." A: "Seems that way." N: "This is the product of what I did." A: "But you did the right thing." N: "And sometimes that has a price."
* A: "For every cause there is an effect." N: "As heroes, ought we not contribute to bad effects happening?" A: "Avoiding everyone isn't necessarily a good thing either."
* N: "When you saw Kieran coming out of prison, how did you feel?" A: "It was confusing. I was afraid, didn't know what to expect, was hopeful, but uncomfortable." N: "If you'd had more time, or less, to prepare, how would things be different?" A: "More nervous & uncomfortable with less prep."
* N: "Then why is it a bad thing I'm giving people time to adjust?" A: "But are you a villain?" N: "It came without warning. What would you think if that happened to you?" A: "It would be surprising. But if it wasn't about control or thought theft, it's just surprising." N: "Other people might be more bothered by it than you?" A: "I guess you don't really know. Maybe less people had a problem with it."
* Nick worries about everything, that's how he gets by!
* Time to head to the Cult!

## Cult of Mind Melding

* Run down neighborhood, worst building in the area. "Gate" is here, but it's merely a suggestion. Weird 90s psychedelic music from inside the house.
* Knock, no answer. Knock louder? Dirt, plants, open house door.
* Nick (5'9") has to duck through the door. Group of hippies sitting crosslegged in a circle around a very loud radio. They're chanting stuff that's no language.
* Nick & Aya join the circle! We don't chant so they open their eyes. Robed leader: "We are mind-melding. Glad you could join us. Do you know how mind-melding works?" Nick spouts some rubbish. RL: "Ah yes. Judgement day. It was when Our Lord decided he'd had enough of humanity's flailing about. He gave us the ability to mind-meld and join together. It reverberated through our minds and hearts."
* Nick looks significantly at Aya. Aya blinks, like "yeah, and?"
* Nick: "dunno how to join in." RL: "we can touch people to mind-meld with them." N: "You just mean like a handshake?" RL: "I can demonstrate." Nick: "you can just tell me." RL: "When I touch someone's forehead, I can plant a small bulb. Ability is imperfect, needs refining."
* RL: "Wish to join us?" Nick: "Sure" - but suspects this is Bathsheba's schtick. RL: "Would the lady like to join in as well?" Aya: (this sounds like Bathsheba, but Nick's going along with it) - looks reviled, worried. "That sounds like mind control." RL: "Mind control? Don't be silly. This is god's gift."
* Aya gets stubborn. "Okay"
* RL puts hand on Nick's forehead. Slight tingle - like an electric shock. It's like the bulb, but feels glaringly similar to Bathsheba's power somehow. Nick resists. RL: "You're also blessed with god's gift."
* RL: "Everyone! He is also chosen!" Everyone claps.
* Nick will make contact with RL's mind. -> 8, marks Insecure. He's sincere, has powers, isn't mind-controlling people. He was contacted by Bathsheba (or someone like her, hooded/cloaked).
* Nick is going to seal the power away. -> 6, Aya contributes team via emotional support.
* RL: "..What did you do?" Everyone's confused and afraid.
* Nick: "Someone very bad unlocked this power in you, to make you an agent." Nick shares memories of past interactions with Bathsheba. RL: "Why?" N: "Why what?" RL: "Why?" N: "That's a tough question."
* RL gets up, walks out for a breath. Everyone follows. Nick: "Aya, can you go make sure you don't leave the property."
* Nick burns -> 13, Overcharge, Worship, to transform this place into a literal dream house - shaping the property into the most positive ideal of the people who are staying here.
* Aya: "You know where this came from? Nick may have used his powers, but this came from you. This is something you all had this whole time, he's just showing it to you."
* RL: "but why?" A: "He helps people, and you're good people. There's a lot of confusing things in this world, we're trying to make sense of it together."
* RL: "thank you." A: "Thank you for doing your best, seeing that it was trying to help the city."
* RL: "Should I take down the poster?" A: "You can do other things to help the city. We need heroes and you are a hero!"
* A: "I worried about the mind control because we'd run into it before, but I don't think you'd mind control anyone. I'm sorry if it came across that way."
* RL is about to cry. Aya: "I'm sure you'll think of something. I'll try to help."
* RL is crying happy tears. A: "We try to be helpful when we can." RL: "People around you must be grateful." 
* RL: "Come on everybody, let's use this thing!"
* RL thanks Nick. Nick: "Thanks for including me in your circle." RL: "I'm sure God would appreciate it if you came by once in awhile." Nick: "I'm sure he would."
* The music changed to Pink Floyd
* Clear a condition! Aya hugs Nick! N: "The library's probably still open." A: "If you don't want to go to the library, you don't have to. Maybe I didn't handle it the right way. I understand a little better." N: "I'm glad you asked me to leave the house." A: "You are?" N: "Where would you like to go?" A: "Somewhere I haven't gone before. You sure it's okay?" N: "Yeah." A: "There's an art festival going on!" N: "let's do that!"
