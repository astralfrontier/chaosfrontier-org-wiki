# Session 33 (2019-01-18)

* Last time, Nick & Melody saved the Cult of Nick from Bathsheba's grasp
* It's been five days since the "Nickcident"

## Dallas, Alex, Vanya

* Dallas texts Alex to see what's going on, do you want to hang out, etc.
* Time to go interior shopping! What store will we go to? Dallas gets easily distracted but finally focuses. Chairs, tables, the basics? Wall mount for TV? Bath & Body Works? Wal-mart? Sears!
* Vanya is picking out stuff adjacent to the electronics section
* D: "Vanya is my nemesis, like Lex Luthor and Superman." A: "What?" D: "Remember prom?" A: "When you faceplanted?" D: "Not that part. I tried setting Vanya up with Lewis." A: "you know she's a lesbian." D: "Not at the time."
* D: "Also I lied to her about being Laser Hawk before being outed on camera." A: "Why are you running from her then?" D: "I lied to her as a reporter. I, Laser Hawk, am not Dallas."
* A: "You don't run away from your villain nemesis, right? You deal with it." D: "You're making me think a lot now. So I should go fight Vanya?" A: "Move forwards. Talk to her and solve things." D: "Clear the air!" A: "Just don't punch her. I'll go flag her down."
* Vanya is window shopping for 'books'. Hides book when Alex appears. V: "What are you doing here?"
* D: "Hey, Vanya, how's it going?" V: brittle smile turns into dry frown - can-you-please-leave vibes. V: "You two here to spite me?" D: "We're here to beat you up -- joking!"
* A: "Uh, Laser Hawk is Dallas--" D: "We weren't going to talk about that specifically!" V: (eyeroll)
* A: "he wants to apologize! Right Dallas?" D: "I'm sorry, Vanya, for all the things." V: "Did you bring a robot to talk to me." D: "that's insensitive, our team has an artificial construct." V: "Melody actually has emotions"
* D: "I have emotions too. Blame isn't 100% on me. You're a reporter, you'd write about it. I am genuinely sorry about the Lewis thing." V: "That's a good start."
* A/D: "We cool?" Vanya isn't _saying_ these two should leave but not saying it. D: "So we're best friends now right? What books are you buying?" V: "Is that something you care about? Why are you here?" D: "Wall mount for a television"
* D: "Alex, does Vanya know you're a hero?" A: "You didn't keep that very quiet." D: "I didn't say which superhero you were!" A: "Vanya, I'm living with two of my friends, I'm an orphan you know--" V: "You're living with Jeremy and Lucy." A: "We need a wall mount because we're poor."
* V: (dryer than the Gobi desert) "Huh"
* V: "well it's been great talking to you two. I need to buy--" (line of sight) "--batteries. My brother likes RC cars"
* D: "Whatever happened with your brother? I think we took care of that." V: "According to the news, Master of Puppets turned good?" D: "That's the guy we fought the most." A: "He was our archnemesis, but now he's not!" D: "He kidnapped you a couple times, Alex." A: "I was like Princess Peach from the Mario games."
* D: (whispers) "Does everyone know the mindmeld was Nick?" A: "Don't think they knew it was Nick specifically" D: "Nevermind! We turned him good, can't tell you how. But we're cool now right?" V: "Sure. We're cool."
* V: "My brother said thanks for helping him btw." D: "If you ever need any more superhero help, we're happy to help." V: "Well if any of you want to do an interview about this mindmeld thing, contact me."
* D: "That was close. Almost wrecked things for Nick." A: "You should talk to Nick about it."
* Dallas texts Nick: "I think Vanya wants to interview you about the mindmeld."
* Nick texts back: "BRB CULT"
* D: "Why does he get all the cool missions?" A: "I could find a cult for you." D: "Let's buy this wall mount, smash a cult, and go hang your TV." A: "Fuck decorations. Multiple chair on table was dumb anyway." D: "it's too subversive, the world isn't ready." A: "It's avante art."

## Beach Episode

* Dallas & Alex find the cult posters, go to 135 Gravity St. They catch up with Nick & Melody heading out of the cult compound
* Nick: "Hey you guys here for the mind-meld meeting?" D: "We just wanted to beat up a cult." N: "It's taken care of." M: "don't beat them up!" D: "Cults seem like they'd be bad." N: "They're just misunderstood." D: "We'll just have to find some other cult to beat up."
* Nick texted by Anna: "Show up at the beach. Bring Melody. At the sandcastle."
* Cut to where Caesar is being kept. Dallas feels like got a Discord notification in his mind.
* D: "Something just touched my brain." N: "It's called a thought, Dallas." D: "This was something different."
* Dallas is getting data. Bathsheba sent CK off to fight someone, which isn't good. Caesar is the one contacting Dallas. He tried to reach Zephyr first, but while Z was geographically close, he's not on Earth
* Nick texts mom: "superhero stuff, what's going on at the sand castle." Brief text exchange. Nick is trying to prioritize.
* We head to the beach. An emotionally important thing for Melody. There's a beach chair. Anna's here, not sitting down, arms crossed. "Cockroach King got out. Why? How?" Nick looks at Dallas.
* Dallas will try to think really loud: "Are you still here?" Unleash -> 7, feels a surprised response.
* Caesar: "Is something happening?" Dallas: Ping
* Nick joins the party line -> 6, Dallas spends team, marks Afraid
* Nick: "where did Cockroach King go?" Caesar: "Trying to find out myself, but it's hard." Nick spends team to assist Caesar
* CK is on the way. Nick: "When he gets here, we'll deal with it."
* Nick briefly explains the situation to Anna. Anna: "When you did your thing, there were a lot of people, including CK. He was in the mind-meld. I was going to test to see if you could control your powers. The situation changed."
* Anna starts running - "gonna grab something, BRB" - starts digging something. She dug up a CD Kieran made of Melody's first solo appearance. It's the Wu Tang Album.
* M: "I've seen this before but I've never seen this before. Is this what dreams are like? This doesn't feel like normal life." Nick: "what was your first solo appearance like?" M: "It was unusual being without the rest of the group. I wasn't really nervous, felt alone, but saw all the people, haven't seen so many people in one place, clapping and smiling. It was great. I wish the others could have been there with me. It was a really wonderful experience."

## Roach Motel

* CK appears, dashes horizontally for us. Charging up for a punch on Anna
* Enter battle as a team. L: Nick. Influence. No mistrust. Purpose: stop Cockroach King.
* Melody goes to intercept, body-checks CK -> 11, still goes crashing - he's powered up
* Nick burns -> 10, uses the power of the CD to summon Utau - Aya's sisters - to restrain Cockroach King, using Overcharge and Worship
* LH wants to C&S Nick - "you've got the power to do this, what you just did was amazing." -> 7, Nick unchecks Hopeless.
* CK is silently struggling, but there's a feeling of fear coming through him from Bathsheba.
* M: "Just so you know, I know what you're doing, you're trying to make people do things your way. You can't do it to me, you can't do it to other people. I will find you, and make you pay for all of this." -> 11
* CK: "None of you children understand what you're trying to stop! You have some grand power, you can shape the world, but your vision is wretched and must end!" 
* Nick pierces the mask -> 11, what do you want me to do? End it. How could I get your character to switch sides? Get rid of the dust. how could I get influence over you? same
* Nick: "The dust is Bathsheba's instrument. We have to take this pawn off the board."
* Dallas takes out CK with a giant hand of light, overwhelm a vulnerable foe -> 13, takes a powerful blow in return -> 9, marks Angry and Afraid
* Dallas fused sand into glass with how much energy he produced
* Nick: "you did the right thing. Marcus didn't want to be controlled." C&S -> 9, Melody spends team
* Dallas tries to channel light into Marcus to radiate the dust away -> 4. Alex is emotional support, Melody can use her own powers, Nick runs interference on the dust's psychic properties.
* Marcus got powered up by the dust, is now losing that.
* Anna will take care of CK. He's going into police custody. Nick: "there's a house we need to visit. We're gonna go see about Caesar, can you send some folks around?"

## Caesar Retrieval Arc

* Barrier is still there. Nick confronts it -> 13, working through footprints left behind last time.
* Dallas goes first, ready to take hits, but nothing happens.
