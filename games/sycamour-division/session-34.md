* what's going on with Zephyr? Flashback...

## Black Rainbow

* Zephyr's checking up on the sanctuary for something about Memento Mori

* Z: "Are you lost?" Them: "I'm exactly where I need to be, you're not." Z: "I'm the Doomed, this is my sanctuary."
* Them: "Too bad. You're trapped". Z: "What if I don't want to be trapped?" Them: "You can't. Mori said to give you an ultimatum." Z: "what's that?"
* Them: "you have info on them right? Give it to me." Z: "I don't have the info WITH me..." Them: "That's a shame, I kind of need it." Z: "I kind of don't want to give it to you." Them: "Then I kind of don't want to stop keeping you here."
* Z: "Wouldn't recommend trying to keep me anywhere. I can do stuff, doesn't work well for people trying to stop me." Them: "Can you hit an illusion?" Z: "I can find the real you." Them: "Not if you're here." Z: "That's annoying."
* Them: "you're gonna be here for awhile." Z: "What's your name?" Them: "I'm Black Rainbow!"
* Z: "that's an oxymoron. This cosplay of yours is ridiculous. Illusions are cool. Go to school, be normal."
* Z: "You're wearing a weird crown." BR: "They're horns!" Trading insults & banter about appearance.
* Z: "Where is Mori?" BR: "I don't know." Z: "You're just a lackey?" BR: "He gave me his powers but I don't know where he is." More smack talk.
* BR: "Are you giving me the books or not?" Z: "No." BR: "I have another option." Z: "You can leave." BR: "Give me Zephyrus."
* BR: "You take things at face value." Z: "I'm a straightforward kind of guy." More provocation.
* Z turns invisible, wants to provoke her into thinking he left. -> 13.
* BR: "Right, fine, you can teleport, whatever, you're still here." Z: (goes silent, pretending he's vanished)
* Zephyr wants to leave, tries to Burn -> 3! Now what?
* A small localized hurricane starts up around Zephyr. Z: "Good luck finding anything in here when I'm done!" BR: (glares)
* Z: "I go where I want when I want!" Overcharge to escape. He leaves, but not to Earth. He's still in this dimension, and can only leave with outside help.

## Ocean's Eleven

* Meanwhile, the Zephyr-Signal appears in the sky! Auster regains some of his powers - speed and phasing. But he can't cut it - kneeling on the ground, puking blood. He calls Dallas: "Have you seen your friend around?"
* Dallas: "Sir this is a Wendy's. Joking. Aren't you the one who keeps track of him?" Auster: "I know where he is. Just asking you politely." D: "Open with that next time."
* A: "There's a big shadow covering my house & a few blocks nearby." D: "So we need to Oceans 11 our way into the sanctuary?" A: "You need to break him out." D: "But Oceans 11 style?" A: "Kid, I don't watch movies." D: "Respect because Zephyr likes you, but work with me. Oceans 11 was a classic." A: "Don't have time to watch movies."
* Dallas will gather his - the - group together and break into the sanctuary
* Dallas group-texts: "Zephyr is trapped in a place. Meet up at Auster's."
* Everyone heads over to Auster's place, including Alex
* It's effectively night time at Auster's, went from summer day to Halloween night. We knock. Auster: "Give me one minute." Machinery turning off. Dallas takes the opportunity to make coffee.
* Auster lays it out for us. "Zephyr is buying time until we get to him." (which is not happening right now)
* A: "You can sense other peoples' presence right?" Nick: "Yeah?" A: "I think someone's in the shadow. Confirm it?"
* Nick tries to do so -> 15
* There's a presence, moving at a stupidly fast rate. Moving at the speed of shadow
* Nick won't mind control, so tries to effectively clone their speed & vibration as a "key" to the sanctuary. It probably can't be done, but... What does Auster recommend? A: "Temporarily break them away from the shadows."
* Two of the party has light powers. Auster: "Any of you super-intelligent?" Nick: "you haven't interacted with us much." Aya: "I'm smart, but what do you need?" Auster: "Calculate their route." A pinball bouncing around at near-infinite speed.
* Aya can plug into supercomputers! -> 7
* They can predict a location. Dallas & Ayami can team up to create a light source and/or punch them
* Aya will try to direct the light -> 8
* Meanwhile, Zephyr has to head toward the light... and comes out in low Earth orbit. He'll go for the jump! -> 10

## End of the Rainbow

* Black Rainbow tries to get away. Zephyr intervenes -> 9, Nick helps by turning the fall into a run +1.
* Z cuts off her escape, lights up with fire, all she can do is run - and Zephyr's better at that
* Dallas will laser-skateboard into her to trip her. -> 11
* BR, from the ground: "Fine, fine, I know where Mori is." Z: "Was that so hard?"
* Aya will create light-bindings and a bandage for a hurt nose.
* Meanwhile, Nick will use telepathy to pierce the mask -> 12
  * Where is he really? She lied. Aya: "That isn't nice." Underground base in Greenwall
  * What do you intend to do? Run away at the first opportunity.
  * How can we get influence over you? Give her a better paying job
* Nick: "What does Mori give you?" BR: "Chocolate bars." Dallas: "Red Vox has a donut room."
* Nick is going to give her an illusion of Willy Wonka's chocolate room. While that's happening, we can get her to Red Vox HQ and get her secure, maybe?
* Dallas comforts & supports: "good job!" -> 7
* Lewis needs someone to fix his suit now. Maybe Vanya's brother Hans?
