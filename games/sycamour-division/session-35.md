# Session 35 (2020-02-22)

* Black Rainbow was being paid by Memento Mori, but we won her over
* Also Zephyr fell from outer space into the ground

## Time skip - next day

* Zephyr's costume was destroyed by re-entry, must obtain a new one
* Z texts Aya: "need help sorting out costume, do you have any free time?" M: "I can help! Kieran has costumes for stuff at work!" Z: "... Does he make outfits for anything other than robot idols?"
* Z will head over to the address given. He sees a small-time supervillain staking out a store, but a hero called The Flying Squirrel bicycle-kicks him into the ground.
* Fiona is there, Kieran's in basement. How fast can he make one?
* Discussion about Zephyr's new outfit. ETA 3 days.

## Red Vox HQ

* The whole team receives a message from Marlone! "That Master of Puppets guy wants permission to talk to one of his Apprentices we jailed some time ago. I don't trust him, but if you all are willing to make a case for him, I'll listen."
* Aya unsure. Nick is okay as long as it's supervised. Dallas: why would we give this guy anything? Nick: we converted or brought down a lot of people via communication, it's worked out okay so far.
* We're summoned to HQ. Marlone: "PS tell Jeremy to stop stealing phones"
* Dallas joke texts: "who's Jeremy?" Response: "Good question"
* Marlone with Jeremy & Lucy, waiting in central hallway. In costume? yes.
* Lucy: "What happened to your costume?" Z: "Orbital re-entry" L: "uhhh"
* Marlone: "these two apparently trust the Master of Puppets." Grando: "We think you should trust him too"
* Post-Nick, Grando talked to MoP, who realized that Bathsheba is mistreating his friends.
* Bathsheba's immortal. Can you guess who made that process? Marlum. It took a toll on him.
* Nick and Dallas will go in there to talk to folks/be mediators?
* MoP wants to unravel the security system the Apprentice built for Marlum, so he can get in there and talk to him. Nick's telepathy reveals this, but Dallas isn't sure. Pierce the Mask -> 4! he thinks MoP is planning to escape.
* MoP: "anything else you want?" Dallas: "For you to not be such a skeezy creep" MoP: "excuse me?" Dallas: "nothing" Nick: "He's had a long day. Everyone's on edge."
* MoP: "You can come with me to talk to the Apprentice." Nick: "Sure." MoP: "He might feel threatened if he sees non-Sycamour people in the room." Nick: "I don't think we're that threatening..." (next to him, Dallas is powering up)

## Tracking Down Marlum

* Looks like the conversation is on! We pile in. MoP asks Apprentice for security backdoor. There's a way, but he won't say it in front of everyone.
* Group huddle. Zephyr wants to be invisible to spy on them. Dallas doesn't want them to be alone. Nick: "So basically we're asking for trust but not offering it."
* Nick tells the Apprentice: "I'm telepathic, I could just read your mind. We're powerful, we could basically demolish his house. We want to do this the nice way. Please work with us."
* We get the answer from the Apprentice after all. Just need access to a cell phone or computer.
* Do we have disposable burner phones? Red Vox has some.
* Meanwhile: MoP tries to talk Marlum out of carrying a torch for Bathsheba. It doesn't go well.
* Marlum left his house. Do we know where? Nope. We guess at a factory though.

## Eye Robot!

* Meanwhile a giant eye robot attacks Red Vox HQ!
* Zephyr will use wind to throw LH via fastball special. -> 9. Melody uses sonic powers to amplify the throw: "GO LASER HAWK!" +1 team
* Dallas punches through the side of the eyeball -> 6! He hits the wall and slides down...
* Dallas takes a powerful blow -> 7! or is it 6, because he cleared a condition? yes!
* Nick burns -> 9, marks Angry, YEETS Laser Hawk into the eyeball.
* Marlum is piloting the robot. "you're gonna take my wife away from me?"
* Dallas: "SHUT UP CRAIG!", hits with hammer. -> 12! Resist or avoid blows, creates an opportunity by knocking Marlum into the robot controls. It starts to slowly crash.
* Zephyr runs in circles to create a whirlwind, slowing its descent to avoid it cratering -> 13
* Meanwhile, Marlum is up and gets in a cheap shot, shooting Dallas in the knee
* Dallas charges up hammer, throws. -> 14
* Marlum takes the hit, starts building a wall around himself out of wrecked controls
* Dallas: "Don't make me come in there" Marlum: "You're a kid, you don't understand." Dallas: "A kid who put your friends in jail." Some back-and-forth banter.
* Marlum: "You're wrong! You need to mature more." He tries to get away, but Nick will work to stop him.
* Nick, meanwhile, makes contact with Marlum's mind, to feed him the litany of awfulness that Bathsheba has committed. Stands up for something: "is this the Sycamour you wanted?" -> 11
* How would Marlum lose status or position? People with Sycamour are watching this attack
* Marlum slowly comes to a halt, to face us. A look of fear, that he's wrong, that he's the immature one.
* "Why are you showing me this? All I want is to live a happy life with my life and kid, with Halcyon under her control. I'm supposed to give her what she wants"
* Nick responds by giving Marlum his memories of him and Aya. Aya chimes in. "Neither of us is always right. But we're learning together."
* Marlum slumps down weeping, "why?" There's a rooted parasite, but only a contingency or plan Z. Nick lets Marlum know that he feels the parasite.
* Nick: "Okay you guys I don't think we have to go to the factory now."
* Z: "Wind tunnel made my suit worse." Nick: "But you saved Red Vox HQ." We can go knock down a factory to maintain karmic balance.
* Marlone appears with armed guards.
* Nick: "We need to talk about this Marlone/Marlum thing. There's room for confusion." Marlone: "This guy's name is Craig. I was born Marlone." The team: "Autocorrect is the worst."
* Marlone: "Z, what happened to your costume?" D: "Outer space." M: "And wind tunnels!" Marlone will pay for the replacement. Zephyr will tell Kieran to send him the bill.
* Guards take control of Marlum.
* The Apprentice tries to escape on a motorcycle but Zephyr shuts that shit down
* Dallas will apologize to Master of Puppets: "You did good, sorry for being suspicious". MoP: "No, that's understandable."
* Dallas: "you know how superheroing is. But if I did hurt you, I'm sorry." MoP: "Bathsheba hurt me more than you did, even with that hammer."  Hopefully there will be no more hitting.
* Budget for Zephyr's new costume will get forwarded via Melody to Kieran
* Time for pizza and karaoke
* Zephyr: "Annoucement. May have been pushing myself a little too hard with powers. Causes a bad reaction. So uh, I'm dying." Dallas: "you're gonna be okay though, right?" Z: "not throwing in the towel but I can't promise it." Nick: "We gotta do something about that." Aya: "What can we do about that?
* Z: "Biology isn't my expertise. I don't know how to fix this." Aya: "If it's because of biology, what if Kieran made you a body?" Dallas: "Torchbearer has a medlab. We gotta do something. been to a hero doctor?" Z: "Your average GP can't sort this out. Sat on this for awhile." Aya: "YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS FOR AWHILE" Z: "Yeah."
* Z: "We had things we needed to do--" Nick: "like keep you alive."
* Aya: "but did you know you'd be?" Z: "Every time we put on the mask we take a chance." Nick: "but we try to make that chance as high as possible."
* Z: "This wasn't an easy thing to tell you. I'm supposed to be a big hero, filling the shoes of Zephyrus. I can't get myself out of this. I wasn't good enough to do it myself." Aya: "We're not supposed to do everything ourselves, we're a team."
* Z: "Glad I had this time with you guys." Dallas: "We're going to medbay after pizza." Nick: "Also we got Marlum who literally made someone immortal. You got a lot of resources."
* Z: "You guys are the best."
