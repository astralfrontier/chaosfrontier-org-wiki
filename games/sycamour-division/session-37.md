# Session 37 (2020-03-07)

* Last time, the team weed whacked Torchbearer's brain
* Zephyr was in the sickbay during that time

## Nickflix and Chill

* This time, Aya has a plan and wants to rope the team in! She goes to Torchbearer's secret hideout to look for Dallas. It's a burned-out warehouse
* Aya wants Dallas's help. Last time when Nick wasn't feeling great, we went and helped a cult. She wants a repeat. Only with less stress.
* This time Aya is bringing movies but wants Dallas's help picking them. Earth documentaries? How relaxing should it be? A 7?
* Dallas recommends "Cabin in the Woods". Aya: "It's scary?" Dallas: "It's scary-ish." A: "Is a scary movie relaxing?" D: "It's not the scariest."
* Aya: "Let's come up with two options." Dallas: "Never-Ending Story!" Aya: "We need to finish it at some point." D: "The title isn't literal." A: "that sounds like false advertising!"
* Dallas explains that this is a good thing, because it keeps things surprising. Aya's going to watch Neverending Story.
* Meanwhile Aya checks up on Lewis. What should she bring as a snack? Pizza for chilling and watching movies. Coke or something.
* Aya shows up at Nick's house in fuzzy musical-note PJs, with pizza and a 2-liter of coke.
* Anna: "What are you wearing?" Aya: "Fiona watches movies like this!" Anna: "Does Nick know about this?" Aya: "Nope, it's a surprise!" Anna: "Did you wear that all the way here?" Aya: "I changed a block away"
* Anna: "He needs more training for surprise events. Come in."
* Nick is texted, comes out.
* Aya: "this is more relaxing than helping a cult out!" Nick: "anything would be more relaxing than that. You nailed it."
* Aya: (after movie) "Last time you were stressed out, I hope this time was better. I understand that you worry. It's okay to worry. I don't want you to worry. But after seeing what LH's mom went through and with Lewis, I understand."
* Nick: "did coming over help you relax?" Aya: "Saw a new movie! Spent time with you!" Nick: "you coming over would be relaxing, come over any time."
* Meanwhile, Lewis texts Dallas: "Halo Combat Evolved. Legendary difficulty. you in?" Dallas is in!
* Lewis drops a sticky grenade on Dallas. D: "That was messed up."

## Class Project

* At the end of the movie, Nick starts panicking about our class project. Panic is not an opt-in or opt-out kind of thing, it just happens. Panic is bigger worry. It's like bikes are worrying, cars are panicking, jets are like freaking out. Nick will just get a hug until we get a text back about the project.
* Lewis isn't worried about it, will do it tomorrow. That will cause Nick to freak out.
* Aya: "we're at Nick's house, but can meet elsewhere." Dallas: "We can use the printer for free at Red Vox." Nick: "You don't print paintings." Dallas: "I think you can." He'll print the Mona Lisa at Red Vox HQ.
* Nick: "We're gonna die, everything's going to crumble down." Let's talk about why. Group projects always fail.
* Nick rambles on how things are going to end terribly. Will externalize his worries about this project.
* Dallas appears with a random mixture of paint.
* Nick gives a _very specific_ set of instructions to Dallas to get stuff from the art supply store. He succeeds, yaay!
* Unfortunately the finishing spray might be flammable...
* LONG segue into Star Wars and other topics. We're fucking around like any good group of high school students.
* Nick will project a Van Gogh style rescue/villain scene with emotions into Aya & Dallas's minds, they'll project it, Lewis will paint it.
* Painting is finished!
* By 1am, we've finished one trilogy of Star Wars
* Teacher wants us all to speak about what we came up with!
* Dallas breaks the painting. Nick loses capacity for rational thought and stumbles through a comment. Aya comes through with how being a hero is awesome.
* Although it was a freakshow all around, we all enjoyed doing the painting.
* The team is off to watch some Star Wars!
