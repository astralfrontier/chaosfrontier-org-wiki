# Session 38 (2020-03-21)
QUARANTINE EDITION

## Motorcycle Man

* On the way home from school, there's a motorcycle parked near the car park. Rider wears an orange shirt, like a prison jumpsuit. He revs the cycle like an asshole.
* Discussions about his motive - what's he here for? Come to flex on some high schoolers?
* He revs it _really_ loud, enough to startle everyone.
* Aya tries to cancel the noise -> 7, guy takes off toward the field.
* Lewis takes off to change. Dallas transforms, skates over to motorcycle guy, shoulder-checks -> 10
* Dallas takes a powerful blow -> 5 and is grappled.
* Meanwhile Nick telekinetically takes his motorcycle away... and Zephyr kicks his way in! -> 9
* LH is freed. Meanwhile, Melody burns! -> 6 and tries to talk him down, but nothing happens
* Nick finds a telepathic bud in his mind. It's a guy from the prison.

## Bank Robbery

* Children of the Night appear. Alex: "a bunch of banks have been hit."
* We're assigned to go defend the bank we originally defended.
* Marlone sends group chat message: he has a personal issue to settle at the Museum. Melody: "he's kind of rude for telling us he's not telling us stuff" Nick: "he used to just not say anything, it's an improvement"
* There's a minotaur with a pistol and an axe at the bank.
* Nick: "can you confirm you're robbing this bank of your own free will?" Provoke -> 5
* Minotaur punches Nick, takes a powerful blow! -> 4
* Minotaur: "You will all get down to the floor now"
* LH is going to grab the gun and crush it. -> 7. LH gets punched in the face too -> 6
* LH wants to get him to surrender -> 10
* Nick meanwhile realizes the telepathic bud is malfunctioning. While the others restrain him, Nick clears the bud out.
* Minotaur comes to. He got arrested for robbing a bank before.
* "The lady told me to do it", an hour ago.
* Nick: "you could do something better with your life, please consider not robbing banks."
* We get orders to stop another robbery. Nick suggests going to the prison. Melody: "Nick is the psychic doggy who needs a scent!" Nick: "Don't know how I feel about this metaphor."

## Confronting Bathsheba

* We go to the prison.
* Doors are open. Prison is empty. Bathsheba's trail leads to the museum. Zephyr & Melody speed-read the prison security stuff here, but not much new information.
* Next stop, the museum!
* Bathsheba is holding Marlone by a neck, against the wall. She's cackling maniacally. She raises her other hand, holding her sword.
* Melody & Zephyr launch forward to intervene. Z defends -> 5, LH and Nick spend team
* LH: "alright old lady, here comes the pain!" -> 9, Zephyr spends team to make a 10. Bathsheba is disarmed.
* Moment of truth!
* Melody creates a lot of light. Where the blade hit her is discolored. "This ends now! You're done overwriting people! I'm never gonna let you overwrite anyone ever again! I have too much to lose. There are people who depend on me, and care on me! I'm not letting you take things away from other people. I'm Melody and I decide who I am, not you!"
* Melody checks Zephyr's hands, throws sword on the ground, gives Zephyr a bro hug, gives Laser Hawk a big spinny hug. M to Nick: "Great thing about friends and knowing other people is that everybody's different, and not all the same." Nick: "Very proud of you, you stood up for yourself."
* Melody: "can you stop her from using those powers?" Nick: "I will find a way."
* Marlone: "I'll remind you prisons have a way of taking away powers."
* Nick meanwhile is going to extract details of the plan from Bathsheba's brain. She was going to use the climate changer to spread the telepathic bud across the city and take control.

## Evil Nick

* Meanwhile Nick gets taken over by a last-minute telepathic failsafe.
* Zephyr wants to grab Bathsheba, LH can grab Marlone? LH wants to get Nick out instead
* LH absorbs light, makes a running jump at Nick to tackle him through museum wall -> 12
* Evil Nick uses TK to hit LH with a bunch of items, including a big grandfather clock, takes a powerful blow -> 4
* The katamari of TK-grabbed stuff is falling, but a black hole of emotions manifests, drawing in Zephyr and Melody.
* Z: "Nick, I'd like to say this'll hurt me more than it hurts you, but I'd hate to lie". He's gonna use air construct swords. But Melody will intervene! Swords veer to the side, carving out big chunks of concrete, and took off a bit of Melody's sleeve.
* LH: can the team lend their power to Nick? Bad idea.
* Zephyr: grab Nick, teleport into the Sanctuary. Rope made of light, pull people on LH's skateboard
* In the sanctuary, now what? LH is hauling him away.... at the speed of light. -> 10
* On the moon: Melody apologizes, takes away all Nick's offensive/aggressive stuff. Leaves crucifix, flash drive, ring? Nope, takes everything.
* Dallas focuses on everything Nick did to bring his dad back. He embodied Savior. Lewis focuses on when he was falling from orbit and Nick caught him, knew his team would catch him. Melody focuses on the pinky swear and the black hole and when he made himself vulnerable to help her.
* Nick is picturing his friends removing a telepathic bud, the way he's done to other people in the past.
* Nick regains consciousness! This is the moon.
* Big group hug time.
* Z: "Should probably give him the ring back now. Get down on one knee..."
* Melody: "sorry I took all your stuff, Dallas said to."
* Nick pulls her up, hugs. "You did the right thing." M: "you okay?" N: "I'm okay, how are you?" M: "Was worried." Nick: "Sorry to make you worry. You dealt with Bathsheba." Melody keeps hugging.
* Nick comforts & supports -> 11
* Z: "How much do you remember?" Nick: "where you tried to kill me with wind blades?" Z: "Concussion at most." Nick: "Don't remember any of that."
* LH: "can't believe I tried to jump here." Nick: "Gravity is 1/6th. You would go further." LH: "So I could jump back..." Nick: "Never give up on your dreams."
* Z: "Wanna race?" LH: "before Sycamour. Nick's mom's cop car. I still didn't learn a lessom from that and I refuse to."
* Melody: "it's good to learn, why would you refuse?" LH: "It's a little overrated." M: "It seems like you underrate it." Z: "Nick, Melody, joining in on this race?" Nick: "You two go race, Aya and I will hang out here for awhile."
* Will the air last? Nick: "You'll know when it runs out."
* M: "On your mark - get set - go!"
* Dallas absorbs raw sunlight! -> 10
* who wins the great re-entry competition? Zephyr 8, LH 10!
* Tidal wave as the boys impact the pacific ocean.
* Meanwhile on the Moon...? Give the kids some privacy

## A Day Later

* Bathsheba is in supermax
* Melody tries to reject lesson, "I'm a pop idol" -> 4!
* We're summoned to see the Director.
* Director slowly claps: "Well kids you did it. That was the last of Sycamour."
* We get to stay together as a team, yaay
* Z: "One question. Any way to stop me from dying due to my powers?"
* Director: "we'll find a cure."

## Where are they now?

* Nick would start a hotel for people in need, and help them with their problems. Hotel Hel?
* Dallas quits Red Vox, starts his own superhero company with cooperation with Nick's thing, and invites the rest of the team + the Children and the Bunnies. "Light in the Dark Inc."
* Lewis takes a break from heroing, but then gets sucked back into it, joins up with Dallas's new company. Must find a successor too.
* Aya spends time doing things for Utau, might work for Dallas's thing, do performances, convince rest of her family to be heroes and work at LID!
