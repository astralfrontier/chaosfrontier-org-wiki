# Session 4 (2019-05-25)
## The Love Letter

> Dear @Zephyr,
> You didn't get to go to the bank with the others for a good reason. Auster called you to his house because he found something out about the powers, and, for good or worse, they relate directly to you. Roll Freak. On a 10+, pick 2. On a 7-9, pick one.
> • "You remember your predecessor? Yeah, she died a pretty gruesome death, but she wasn't supposed to. At least, not yet. Her regen powers stopped working, which is suspicious to say the least." Auster found clues regarding Zephyrous's death, and one of them, he pointed out, leads directly to your powers, specifically, a way to unlock a new level of power for your regenerative ability. How, and why?
> • "So, you can go fast. But I don't remember ever going as fast as you did in that race you had with your friend. How about making that the standard?" Auster picked up some pieces of rubble that are stuck in evidence bags... You might want to talk to Nick's mom after this. Anyways, they have a pretty interesting residual footprint of your powers. It's pretty damn possible you could get a power-up on your superspeed, but you'll have to sacrifice something for a little while. Probably a limb. What do you lose, and, if you know, why?
> • "Ah, I miss the old days where I could pick up a book and know everything in it in the blink of an eye. Of course, it's not like that. It was with Zephyrous, though." Auster's talking about going to her grave to retrieve her eye. Apparently it has some sort of residue of your powers, and it can make you reach Zephyrous-levels of speed-reading. Granted, he wants you to do something you're not sure is morally right, or even abides by the law. What is it he wants you to do, and why?
> On a miss, pick 1, but you get attention from the press. Expect judgement from civilians, either from having reminded them about the race, or from tampering with the dead.

* Zephyr love letter -> 6!
* Picked regenerative ability. Not interested in the Speed Force of Vecna.
* How does this history lead to the new powerup? Human bodies have limiters, but he learned to go beyond, Plus Ultra! Auster found a clue. Regeneration has a cooldown period.
* Zephyr is getting attention from the press. Since some of the bank robbers got away, he's being compared unfavorably to predecessor Zephyrus.
* Laser Hawk took Beacon Drives. Pressure in and out of costume.
* Zephyr's advancement: Been reading the files.

## School Day

* It's a Thursday.
* We get the day off. LH: is it a school day? Dallas goes to a standard public school, single mom, probably doesn't qualify for scholarships.
* Nick and Zephyr are in the same boat
* Melody is curious about school but doesn't go (yet). She might just drop into a school and hang out. Z: ask Red Vox about getting in, be the mysterious transfer student next day.
* Melody can shift her appearance to go incognito, but might still looks uncanny valley/CGI
* LH: involved in student council. Only person who knows his mundane ID is Zephyr, for homework reasons.
* Who knows who at school? Lewis/Zeph is the two-way secret keeper
* What happens when Melody shows up? "What's this, what's going on?"
* LH sees Melody at the cafeteria, has the chore of making sure she doesn't give herself away
* LH is otherwise not giving himself away to Nick or Lewis
* Nick: I don't get along well with most kids, cause I can tell what they feel, and I sometimes open my mouth too much

## Welcome Aya

* How does Melody get in? Hacking? Red Vox? She doesn't know enough to hack. She asks Marlone, but no. How about Kieran or Fiona? Fiona will do it.
* Melody at school's office: "You can call me Aya (AI-a?)". She gets routed to us, Class 2A.
* Melody takes a seat in Nick's seat. Nick chooses to move to be nice?
* Zephyr arrives. "Made it." "What were you afraid of?" "Detention." "We will defeat detention."
* LH arrives, assigns Zephyr to help Melody through class problems.
* LH: "talk to Nick as well, he has the dirt on people." Melody: "doesn't he shower?" Z: "Metaphorical dirt."
* Nick:

* Other students whispering to each other.
* Did LH just accidentally say "Melody"? Oops.
* Teacher comes in, paperwork-checks Melody. Rest of the class is trying to contain their laughter. Melody is v. enthusiastic.
* Students eventually move on to other topics.

## Club activities

* Recess. What do you do?
* Zephyr: head to the cafeteria, stack plate with food.
* LH: text into the group chat, "so I see Melody is here at school?"
* Zephyr: "LH is here, but his ID is a secret." Melody: "LH is dirty?"
* Nick is off in a book, burying himself or hiding himself away.
* Dallas sees Nick is isolating himself. Go try to make him feel included. But not sacrifice his ID.
* Informal student gov't lunch, come sit in
* Nick has accidentally spilled secrets about others in the past due to his powers
* Z: Melody, any clubs you want to join? Any music club? Melody: want to do something new
* Group of 3-4 girls hand Melody a note: Saw you're new. Need 1 more club member. Sports club. Yes!
* Zephyr too busy after school to do club activities.
* Melody: this is great, they do all sports!

* Zephyr: mixed feelings about participating on track team.
* Sports club is um.
* Melody: speaking of secrets, I know a dirty thing! BTW Banks are bad places.
* M: Laser Hawk was acting weird around this lady. I think he has a crush on her. Acting weird around someone on TV means a crush.

## Murderball

* Last class of the day is PE. Whole class is at gym. 30-40 students.
* Teacher is weird, he shouldn't be a PE teacher. Hunchback, uses a cane.
* Zephyr & Sophia (Sports Club girl) choosing teams
* Sophia picks Aya for team, Zephyr picks one of the other girls - Laura. Uh oh, it's on.
* Sports club girls: Sophia, Amy, Jodie, Laura
* Team selection: Lewis (Laura, Dallas, Nick), Sophia (Melody, Amy, Jodie)
* Z: Nick, you're on my team. Nick: okay. Sorry in advance.
* Other students get picked!

* There's a part-time model named Kyle but nobody cares.
* Who has highest danger? Melody vs. Dallas, roll Danger!
* Sophia's team fucking wrecks Zephyr's team.
* Melody destroys all due to super-strength. Laura gets hit hard, other girls are mad.
* Finally PE teacher rounds up the survivors, "congratulations".

* Robert Fink, representative of Plastic Boogie, environmentalist company.
* "Sign here". Zephyr speed-reads. Sugar-coated document. They sign the thing. Melody hands over her contact information!
