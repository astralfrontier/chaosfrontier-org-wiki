# Session 5 2019-06-01
## The police station
We're still under arrest. A different detective asks: What is your relationship with those girls?

Nick: none, we rescued them. Cop: Why? Nick: cause we're superheroes? Cop: We had it covered. LH: did they?

Cop: do you have any connection to the girls, gang, etc.? Melody: what's a gang?  Z: a group of bad people. M: we're not with them.

Eventually Det. Hel shows up, smug grin. "was it worth it?" LH: kids went home that night, so yeah. Would do it again.
Hel: You won't say that when you hear what's going to happen to you.
Z: won't apologize for saving people & taking down gang members.
Hel: do you know how much you've messed up?
It took us completely off guard. Police didn't get credit, jobs are in danger.
LH: maybe they deserve to lose job -- Nick: no, don't say that.

Hel: you saw me in my car Nick. I was doing a job.
Back and forth between Anna and Nick.
Melody wants to ask a question, keeps quiet.
LH pacing, trying not to speak his mind. Fidgety.
Nick: we're respecting your authority by being arrested now

Hel: will your agency respect your authority?
Nick: if you don't like Red Vox, we can help change them, but you gotta work with us to do it
Hel: you're turning into my greatest fear. (-Danger +Superior)

Hel to LH: I'm not surprised or disappointed, you're just a troublemaker
LH: I'm here for my friends. I'd be outta here otherwise
Hel: don't take Nick as a role model, but he's not as reckless as you
You shouldn't have stepped in.
## Amy and Trish
Door bursts open. A wild detective appears! "We need to talk". Hel goes along.
LH uses powers to listen in. A lot of police jargon. Girls are related to organization called "Syc... Sycamour".
Hel: who are you guys after again? Z: Sycamour division.
Hel: and you have what connection to those girls? Z: didn't even see them.
M: there's punishments worse than jail. Still trying to figure out why Nick got in trouble, then why LH got told to be more like Nick.
Hel: you REALLY don't know anything? Us: nope.

We get uncuffed. Except LH, who didn't have cuffs. Escorted to a much nicer room.
Two girls in here. They see us, eyes light up, but heads go down.
Detectives leave the room.
M: raises eyebrow at girls, 'cause that's what cops do.
LH: Nick you'll be better at this.
Nick to girls: .... Hi? And you are?
Girl 1: Trish. Girl 2: Amy
Nick: what's your connection to Sycamour?
Girls: the people that took us, they're from Sycamour.
Why did they take you & what do you know about them? Orphanage was set on fire. This catches LH's attention - the Rube Goldberg Orphanage. He knows someone from there. This person disappeared after the fire. This event happened 2 months ago.
Girls: They said they were going to help us, but we were kept tied up.
Nick: do I have permission to read minds? Amy doesn't want to, but Trish is okay.
## Flashback to Orphanage Fire
The orphanage fire. 6 kids worked together to get everyone to safety. 4 other kids are our age, Amy and Trish are younger.
Some folks come out of the back of the building, dressed in fancy tuxedo suits. They say something, garbled by memory. "The 4 of them will make a fine addition".
Fancy car parked a couple of blocks away.
Nick probes: any significant family? Any superpowers? Unleash powers -> 8, mark Guilty (Anna's comments about the team blundering in is hitting hard). Most memories are from orphanage, kids don't seem to even know that powers are a thing. They seem very sheltered.
Nick withdraws from telepathy.
"What did you see?" "Four kids who need rescuing. Two kids who need family & support." Nick looks at team: help me out here guys
LH: let's go interview the bad guys we smashed.
# The Fight
## Sycamour Retrieval Squad introduction

While this is going on, there's a hissing sound at/near the wall. Dallas & Melody check it out.
Outside there's a brick of explosive, like C4 or a cartoon bomb. It explodes!
Three figures emerge. Wall is completely vaporized.
Zephyr moves fast to save everyone! Defend -> 10
Take a powerful blow! Zephr -> 6, LH -> 5, Nick -> 7, Melody -> 4
Nick gives ground, opposition gets opportunity - protect the girls, won't notice what comes next.

> Laser Hawk, you recognize Absentia. You recognize them too well. They were your best friend in highschool last year before they disappeared after that orphanage burned down. Melody, you know them too. You've seen them talk to Fiona on her dayjob as a therapist, and she's always said how she's so close to getting them on the right path. They, however, don't recognize either of you. LH for obvious reasons, but they never really paid attention to Melody.

> Nick, you've seen Grando before, and it wasn't under the best of terms. Hel had you look on his memories to find incriminating evidence-- and it worked. He got jailtime for 2 days before his orphanage paid the bail.

> Laser Hawk, you also know this guy. He frequented your skate park, and always caused trouble. Oddly enough, he always did it when you were around. But that's not all. Once, on one of his tantrums, your mother came with you to watch you show off a new technique you learned. Things got so bad when he saw you pull it off, he ran to your mom, and punched her square in the jaw. You're still not sure why he did it, but you definitely don't like him very much.

> Zephyr, you recognize this girl Dubium. She was there when you got your powers, and when Nightquake killed your predecessor. Ever since then, she's been a rather... Outspoken fan of yours. That is, until that orphanage burned down.

> Nick, you know her too. When you were younger, you picked up a stray teddy bear on the street, since you were trying to get a hang of your powers. Unfortunately, when you grabbed it, you saw that same girl being beaten-- even shedding blood-- by what appear to be orphanage staff.

Nick isn't wearing a mask. Grando recognizes him.
Dubium notices Zephyr.
Grando: "Absentia: grab them." They run toward the two girls.

LH: "You guys need to stand down.". Villains look at Grando. Grando is getting up. "Need to neutralize the threat!"
Z: do they have cells for holding metahumans in the police station? They're pretty far away. They'd need to come willingly or be unconscious.
LH: Pierce the Mask, "I just don't understand why you're doing this" -> 3
LH: We could stop fighting permanently. We could figure this out peacefully.
A to Dubium: haven't we already stopped fighting?
Grando sees Melody's back as she runs to safety
