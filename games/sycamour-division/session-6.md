<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Session 6 -->

# Session 5 2019-06-08
Last time, we fought the Children of the Night.
Everyone went unconscious! Bodies piled up near an impact crater.
Cars pulled up, Marlone gets out, "holy shit".
Anna Hel comes out of the precinct, with the girls.
The building is in shambles - not falling, but damaged.

## The hospital

We wake up in hospital beds. Nobody else is in here.
Z: that could have gone better. M: sorry for shutting down. It was that or let the bad guys through the door.
M: hospital does nothing for me.
We're on IVs. Laser Hawk pulls his out, uses photonic energy to fix his injury.
Discussion about getting knocked out. Consensus: it's bad.
We're not sure if the girls are safe. Nick remembers Anna being there for them, assumes they're safe.
LH: any security? anyone trying to stop us?
LH and Melody wearing their own thing, Nick and Zephyr in gown.
LH tries to get up, sharp chest pain, but it fades slowly.

Nick: we didn't do so well, people worry, we need to train.

Z tries to get up, body feels numb.

We leave the room, step outside. Nurse carrying box of glazed donuts, jumps in surprise. Z catches it.
Marlone wants to talk to us.
We get steered back in.
Z: can we order pizza in a hospital? Marlone fed us last time.

Marlone shows up with his rant face.
Marlone: do you understand the trouble you're in right now? You destroyed a police station.
Z: there was a bomb.
Marlone: I didn't notice because the entire place was destroyed.
Z: an attempt was made.
Marlone: you did keep the children safe. You're all going to be big trouble. (looks at LH)
LH & Marlone bicker about handcuffs & following rules

Marlone uses light magic & mage hand to manipulate the TV.
Marlone's hand manifests a symbol. Melody & LH use their powers to mimic the pattern.
Marlone believes his powers are a gift from God to save others.
On TV, they're talking about us. Focus is on the fact that we wrecked the police station. "This is one of the many reasons that kids shouldn't be superheroes. And supers shouldn't interfere with police business."
LH: can we get a press agent?
Marlone: the press is wrong, but we can't afford that.

LH: we're only as effective as people feel we are.
Nick: everyone doesn't want me to do this, except me, but that's enough.
We need to work more closely with the police.
Go talk to the detective.
Nick: "what you're saying to us is Go to Hel"

Melody starts playing Candy Crush Saga, gets 50+ messages from Fiona, followed by "nevermind".
Fiona's on the way to get her.
Nick: let's let our families know, then get back together pretty soon.

We've been gone 18 hours. Melody, LH, and Nick have family to reassure.
LH: Melody, can you pretend to be my boss from my internship?
Melody: yes. why not just say you're staying with Zephyr?
Is LH's mom secretly a supervillain? Topic for discussion.
Melody: I can give you an alibi, you can be an idol singer!

Dallas texts his mom, was staying at Lewis's house.

## Nick's mom

Let's go talk to Anna Hel! She looks like she has something to say.
Nick leads the way. Sacrificial lamb. LH is quiet.
Anna: I think you all got the memo. (Melody checks her phone)
Your organization will need to pay for it. (Nick: I'm not grounded, my allowance is good)
Nick: we need to get better as a team. Anna: so you're working beside the police? Nick: you work with Red Vox. Anna: they're showoffs.
Anna: what you did with those girls.. thank you. I misjudged you. (+Savior -Danger)
Nick said his piece. LH hangs head. Z marks Guilty from label shift.
Melody: didn't mean to cause trouble. Sorry. Anna: you caused the least trouble of all of them.

## Karaoke

We go to karaoke and order comfort food.
Everyone in the restaurant area looks at us. Is it the police station, or the 5 pizzas for Zephyr?
Does LH have friends? People who made costume. Lost skate friends.
Jodie from sports club is on a date with school council member (Dave). They notice Melody. Melody waves.
J: "didn't know you were a superhero." Mel: "are you enjoying your day?" J: "I'm on a date. Come meet him."
LH: concern about secret identities.
Z: Jodie, we're hanging out. Piss off.
Jodie: oh, you guys destroyed the police station? there was a bomb - are you deaf?
Nick: ".... what?"  Zephyr gestures. Nick: "Yeah!"
Jodie wanders off. Melody is confused about pranks.
7 pizzas arrive.

## Team Moves

Nick: people are afraid of us. Are you afraid of me? (team move)
Z: we're all equally bad. (team move)
LH: you're one of the most dangerous people, but also one of the most responsible. we're all who we are.
Melody: they're the ones that set off the bomb.
LH: who I am under the mask gets in the way of being the hero. (team move)
Nick: I don't know that person, all I can see you as is a hero
Melody: they're the same person.
LH: sometimes it just doesn't feel like it.
Nick: are you different when you perform vs. when you're here?
Melody: you rehearse what you perform on stage
Nick: there's stuff I'd do as a hero I'd never do normally. Like talk to people.
Melody: like youtube comments! Nick: those people are villains.
M: I know you said your mom doesn't like what you're doing. What makes you happy about this? (team move)
LH: helping people. knowing I can make a difference.
Mel: what was the best thing we did? LH: we become a stronger & stronger team.
Nick: we never gave up on those girls, no matter what it cost us.

## Next Moves

Nick tells Melody about the vision he got.
M: but I'm a good guy. Nick: what would change that? M: programming.
Melody: angst about being good? Nick: you can be good.
Z: you're not what you're made. Everyone grows & develops.
M: i don't wanna be a bad guy. Z: that's good, keep that in mind.
Nick: we have to confront those villains again. Let's find ways to help them realize that too.
Nick: I want to reach out to Dubium & help her.
Z: I'm on board.

Nick: LH, you use light. Mel, you emit light. Let's find synergies.

Where can we practice powers - open fields? School gym after hours? Beach? Let's avoid blowing up the school. Rock quarry? Into the countryside.

What do we do next - Search for Dubium.
Her name is Lucy.
Zephyr siphons pizza. Except one last piece.

Mr. Auster - Zephyr's retired predecessor - appears.
Do we know him? Probably not.
Auster talks smack about Zephyr & us "going to prison" (we didn't!)
Auster: this reflects badly on the legacy. You should have called me so I could handle it.

## Finding Dubium

We know she lived in the orphanage & is a fan of Zephyr. We know her name is Lucy.
Can Melody hack into state records & get details? Has a new move to do this. -> 6
Melody learns the orphanage fire was planned, not an accident. Mel dissociates from humanity a bit due to confronting this experience.
Zephyr's been reading the files on Dubium -> 12
She manifests metal out of nothingness.
This ability seems to be similar to a Sycamour higher-up? She may have inherited her powers, the way Zephyr did. Followup - is there a limit to the power? When she creates iron constructs, she's extending the iron in her body, leaving her anemic.
Nick will ask Anna Hel for access to evidence on the attack. Police seem onboard with helping us. Zephyr will run Nick over to the police.
Nick reaches out... 5! +1 forward from previous team move, +1 for Influence

Dubium is at a factory. Nick knows her location.
Not enough for a telepathic contact, but enough to make the next move.

## Melody & Laser Hawk

Homework! Mel: Do you do well at it? LH: I get by with Zephyr's help. M: Zephyr does your homework: LH: not all the time.
LH explains the need to maintain a secret identity.
Mel: what's a date? LH: have you not watched TV? Uh...
A date is a type of fruit resembling a fig. This is clearly lies. Melody is confused.
LH: I don't have time for dates, I'm not an expert.
Mel: who should I ask? .... I should ask Nick!
Fiona is texting again. Mel: I have to go back to the hospital.
LH has conned Melody into thinking that other people doing homework is normal.

We have a plan... but who do we tell?
We'll ask Anna about the factory.

## Excelsior!

Nick - closer to Zephyr. (+Superior -Mundane)
Melody - closer to Laser Hawk. (+Mundane -Freak)
Zephyr - closer to Nick. (+Superior -Mundane)
Laser Hawk - closer to Melody. (no shift, gain Influence)
