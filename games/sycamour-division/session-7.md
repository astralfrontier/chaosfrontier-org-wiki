<!-- TITLE: Session 7 -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Team vs. Werewolf. Scratch one factory. -->

# Session 7 (2019-06-15)
* Are we heading to the factory? Are we telling anyone?
* We're notifying both Anna Hel & Marlone via text message - forgiveness is easier than permission

> "Sorry, I can't --ksszht-- get your message" "Nick, you are texting this."

* "We're following up on a lead on a Sycamour person who attacked the PD."
* Zephyr gets a message from Mr. Auster. Extremely urgent, legacy business specifically for Z.
* The rest of us head out immediately to the factory.

## The Factory
* The factory has a fence and security towers, unmanned. It's not in good shape.
* LH: "I've seen malls more alive than this." Discussion between LH and Mel about malls.
* Nick tries to extend senses to feel people here -> 9
  * One human inside the building, very far away, not sure on which floor (but not ground floor).
  * Another being (human? who knows) on the ground floor.
* Mel: "do you think it's haunted?" Nick: "Everything is haunted."
  * Discussion on ghosts, LH is ghost-agnostic.
  * Mel: "I won't assume ghosts are good or bad." Nick: "that's the spirit".
* LH: "let's walk into this trap."
* We jump the fence? More creative entrance?
* Carefully open the window.

> You enter the factory, the scent of dust and rust immediately invading your nose as it makes it clear that, yes, this is abandoned. The entrance is filled with rubble, wiring, and other mechanical messes. In the background, darkness envelops most things, although one set of four chairs catches your interest-- they're not as messy as the rest of this place. In fact, they seem rather recently put. Aside from them, you see various words written around the place, and a barrel with its inside lit ablaze.

* Ways to the upper floors? Blocked by rubble, but we can carefully get through them.
* No presence on this floor for now.
* In the wall near a staircase, there's a note. "Beware beware of the beast that haunts the factory". On the back: kill - murder - rape repeatedly.
* Animalistic/human emotional energy radiates from it.
* Upstairs is safer, that's where the human is.
* One other chair, oversized. In the chair, there's a bunch of IV bags. Smell of blood. Pile of expired blood bags. Something clearly villainous is going on here.

## Altered Beast
* Approaching footsteps.
* LH: can Melody hide us behind some light constructs?
* There's rubble here, let's take cover.
* Footsteps draw closer...

* He wanders around for a bit and leaves on his own.
* LH: was that the human or nonhuman? Nick: gonna give you the more comforting answer.
* It's in another room, but we can hear it.
* LH texts Marlone to ask about a big wolf guy. Marlone's never heard of a wolf guy. There's the cockroach guy. Any other animal guys we should be aware of?
* Nick remembers 4 kids from the orphanage, but we only encountered 3 of them.
* A shaky cell phone rises above the rubble and snaps pictures. Sending to Anna Hel.
  * Anna: "?"
  * Nick: "!" - we found IV bags & blood in the factory
  * Anna: "this is related to Sycamour?" Nick: "yep".
  * Anna: "I'll send a detective team." Nick: "SWAT and a priest."
## The Note
* There's something yellow on the chairs downstairs. The note from earlier was also yellow.
* Nick: we should go find that other presence, unleash -> 7, mark Hopeless

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/572184988272033792/589600940546588673/liam.jpg)

* A scientist guy? Master of Puppets.
* We should go down and check out those chairs.
* NOTE: Sycamour logo.
  * Don't unleash them yet. We have to make sure they won't rampage through everything when they see another human other than you. It's of extreme importance that-'
  * And it ends there, the rest of the note being scribbled black, with red a couple of red, spelling out 'I know what's best.'
  * The back of the note is full of scribbles and more words of death.
* Nick texts his mom with what he's found - note, plus the two people.
* LH marks Afraid.
* Melody doesn't understand why she should be afraid.
* Blood splashed around the chairs near where the feet would be.
* Anna: "don't you think you should just get out?" Nick: shows phone to teammates. let's back off and wait for police support.
* M: "are they coming to arrest the science man?" N: "probably." He's eating people, that's against the law!
* Team consensus: let's sneak out the way we came.
## Backup Arrives
* Marlone shows up in his car. We brief him on the situation.
* Mel: werewolves are real cause they're on TV.
* Marlone: can you create light? Charge up!
* Marlone storms in. The rest of us follow.
* We head to the second floor thanks to Marlone noisily clearing the rubble on the second floor.
* Werewolf is wearing a jacket, inside it is a bunch of needles stuck inside his body.

* Entering battle as a team - LH leads, Melody & Nick follows.
* LH charges in, directly engage -> 9, +1 from Melody - overcharging his powers with light!
* Resist or avoid blows, take jacket away (it catches fire)
* The scientist comes over PA: "so you've arrived, with your little friend Marlone. I hope you're prepared to face my creation."
* Nick channels the rage & anger of this place, channels into TK storm -> 6, +1 Team from LH. Nick gets hit with spare rubble, channels TK into shredding the werewolf's jacket.
* Nick gets clawed by the werewolf & gets knocked backward.
* Take a powerful blow -> 13. Lose control of yourself or your powers in a terrible way!
* Vortex intensifies, beams start hitting people. Scientist is angry over the PA.
## Puppets Arrive
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/572184988272033792/589608879952756763/puppet.jpg)

* A bunch of puppets show up, flailing wildly.
* Marlone tries to deal with it, is distracted by charging werewolf.
* Melody creates giant light fist -> 12! Puppets go flying. "I did it!" Marlone: o_o b
* Marlone gets clotheslined by a beam. The werewolf tries to administer a coup de grace, LH charges up and tries to protect him! -> 11, add 1 team to the pool
* Marlone Mage Hands the werewolf, grapples, werewolf takes it to the chin. Wolf chomps at the ground, tries crawling down to the first floor.
* Nick brings down the entire floor on the werewolf! -> 10, resist or avoid blows, take away mobility (trapping the werewolf under the rubble). Everyone falls down too.
* Melody: "is everyone okay?" 
* Werewolf gets up groggily, looks at the door. Scientist: "get them!" Werewolf charges us, but badly.
* Melody creates a dagger of light in her hands. "How do I bless something?" Nick is breathing heavily, head snaps around, no good answer.
* Melody throws it! Directly engage -> 2. Pierces through his chest, but it's not silver. Werewolf slashes Melody, take a powerful blow. -> 8. Mark Insecure & Hopeless.
* Marlone is floating on light, golden angel wings, blasting werewolf and its jacket.
* LH has an opportunity! Game Face, commit to defeat the werewolf.
* Run up, slam both hands down on the werewolf. -> 11
* LH grabs the Jacket off. Werewolf transforms back, half-human half-werewolf Two Face style.
## Takedown
* The scientist sets off explosions to bring down the entire building! On our heads.

* Nick spends last burn to Moat, telekinetically holding up enough building to keep us from getting crushed.
* Melody will start blasting through rubble to clear a path out. Marlone helps.
* LH strips the wolf half the jacket, manifests skateboard, is gonna wheel him out.
* The sound of rocket engines from nearby - is someone taking off?

![](https://i.imgur.com/pigTdbK.gif)

* Once we're out, the collapse is threatening some buildings nearby, with (presumably) people in them! Danger!
* Nick touches LH's mask to draw on the heroic energy he's accumulated in it, Burns -> 11
* Spend 2 burn for Moat to keep the buildings from collapsing on the houses
* Marlone creates a light barrier to catch the collapse as well.
* SWAT arrives. They're in awe of the catch.
* Zephyr is the usual Cop Whisperer, we'll defer to Marlone now.
* Anna Hel calls. What the fuck?
* Nick explains badly. Bleeding from the forehead: "Nobody got hurt, everything's fine, mom."
* Former werewolf wakes up, starts screaming, cops notice.
* Nick: "he was wearing a jacket with a bunch of needles full of werewolf heroin."
* Nick: "mom, did we do the right thing this time?"
* Anna: "you kept a building from falling. I think so."
* Nick: "just want you to be proud of me, mom."
* Anna: "yeah." (sniff)
## Family Matters
* Everyone's phone starts ringing. Amber alert! 16yo boy describing Laser Hawk. Name is given: "Dallas"
* Melody: "should we find this kid?"
* Nick: "sure Sycamour has been kidnapping kids, maybe it's connected."
* LH: TEXTS HIS MOM RIGHT NOW. "did you send out an amber alert?" MOM: "YES!"
* Mom followed up LH's alibi that he was with Lewis, it didn't hold up.
* LH: I'm coming home right now.
* The amber alert gets canceled.
* Nick: "we should probably figure out what happened with that rocket."
* LH: "I'd help you look but I have to go home to the bathroom". He immediately bails.
* Melody: "I feel that was a prank, Nick."
* Nick: "I agree. We should follow him and see what's going on."
* Melody & Nick follow LH.
* 2 blocks from home, LH gets on a rooftop and swaps clothes.
* Nick can fly & teleport, so we can probably follow him.
* We can get close enough to see what's going on, following a light trail, we'd see a backpack on the roof, and we'd see Dallas walking down the street.
* Melody: is he in trouble? Nick: he went undercover. M: is he really trying to be stealthy?
* Humorous interlude
* M: What's a date?
  * Nick: an event on the calendar.
  * M: Jodie said she's on a date. That kind.
  * Discussion about dating.
  * Nick: you sing love songs? Dating is finding out if that feeling of love is real for you & if the other person feels it too.
* ... But we lost track of Dallas thanks to this question.
* Nick & Melody grab his stuff off the roof. Text him that we have it. Phone is in the backpack..
## Dallas at Home
* Dallas comes in the front door. Mom: GLOMP. she's crying.
* Mom: "where have you been? do you know how long it's been?"
* LH: "I lost track of time."
* Mom: "It's been 2 days! I thought someone got you! I thought I lost you!"
* LH: "i had my phone!" Mom: "I called you!" LH: "I am kinda flaky."
* Mom: "I almost went to the hospital!" -Savior +Danger
* LH is grounded for a week. He texts Zephyr about this, no response.
* Mom has a tracking app, leashing him to 50 feet from the house (at least on his phone).
* Police forensics will reveal that the kids from the Rube Goldberg Orphanage were powered up in this factory - thus the blood and other stuff - the way the werewolf was. This is why Nick's emotional sensor brought him here, because Dubium has strong associations with the place.
# End of session
LH -> closer, Melody due to power-up combo move (+Freak -Superior)
Nick -> closer, Melody (+Superior -Freak)
Melody -> closer, Nick (+Freak -Savior)
# Notes for next time
* Melody and Nick have Laser Hawk's backpack of costume and gear
* We need to track down Professor Puppeteer and his rocket o' doom
* We should go clubbing as a team, to take the stress off! We need to find a way to let Laser Hawk sneak out - maybe make a holographic construct of him?
* Nova move: "Remind them of past collateral damage" (maybe some vital evidence was destroyed in bringing down the place?)
* Nova move: "Make their powers flare out of control" (going clubbing should definitely do _something_ to Nick, probably not _destructive_ though - have fun!)
