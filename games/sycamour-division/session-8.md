# Session 8 (2019-06-22)
* LH's player is missing - LH is grounded
## Cutscene: Zephyr
* Mr. Auster called Zephyr to his house. On arrival, he looks worried.

* "Nightquake has made his next move! Stealing from Jeremiah Peacekeeper, CEO of eco-corporation!"

* On a table, photographs of Nightquake with other people Z doesn't recognize.
* Auster needs to locate NQ & find out his plan. Auster needs Z to investigate NQ's relations to Sycamour & why they need this much money.
* Z thinks the need for money is obvious (buy more guns, do gang stuff). A thinks this is too high-profile for this.
* Z runs to the factory. Police tape everywhere, nobody can get in. The site has collapsed.
* Z calls Nick.
* Nick is trying to recuperate. Z: "what happened?" N: a lot of shit happened. Also Dallas was kidnapped.
  * Z: ..... don't worry about Dallas.
  * N: Cool. We still have his stuff.
  * Z: I'll message him.
  * N: We have his phone.
  * Z: ....I'll figure something out. good work today everyone.

## Time to relax!

* DJ is a popular girl, Erica. She's playing popular tracks.

* Takes a minute to work through the crowd to reach Erica.
* E: "hi"
* M: "Hi! Nice to meet you! I'm Aya!"
* E: "oh yeah, you're that Melody girl? From the building? You helped save it."
* She gets recognized anyway.
* M: "yeah, I was there, not supposed to talk about it though."
* Z: "cool party. nice music."
* E has no idea what she's doing, just letting the song play.
* E: "Judie & the others helped me invite everything."
* E: to Melody & Zephyr: "you two are new, right? You wouldn't have joined any clubs, right?"

* Erica hands us business cards. "Join the music club." she winks at Melody specifically.
* M: "thank you so much!" Winks back, that's what you're supposed to do.
* E: "gotta get back to DJing. we don't want people getting rowdy." M: "Yeah!"
* Nick touches the gear. She's owned it for a long time. Mostly sentimentality. Most people aren't here for the music.
* Nick heads over to the booze to soak in the ambiance. -> 5
* People really are here for the booze & the other people. Feeling tipsy.
* Nick soaks up the whole place then! -> 10
* Whole place reeks of the teenage aura. There's a reason here. To commemorate or faciliate some event.
* People are having fun, talking to friends, sharing or oversharing.
* Particularly strong flame behind Nick. There's a guy doing stunts for attention, jumps onto a table and breaks it. It's painful but fun!
* Nick heads back toward the others.
## Beer Pong
* Zephyr - are there any drinking games happening?
* Beer Pong. "Nick, wanna set up another game of beer pong?" N: "Sure!" M: "What's beer pong?"

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML5wIR8XI2Y){.youtube}

* Zephyr gets ready to play, directly engage -> 3
* Nick, directly engage -> 7
* Impress, surprise, frighten the opposition!
* Zephyr gets 2 shots in of 6, Nick is secretly using TK!
* Second round, Zephyr -> 4, Nick -> 1!
* Nick's feeling sluggish, Zephyr's metabolism is fine but his aim was never perfect.
## Choking
* Zephyr -> 5, Nick -> 0!
* Nick was certain he was gonna hit it, alcohol said no, the ball gets thrown right at.... another table! Amy and Eleanor are having their date.
It landed in _a_ cup at least. It falls into Eleanor's drink.
* Nick panics. Rushes over. Tries to use TK to pull it out -> 6
* Nick marks Guilty, Eleanor marks Afraid.
* Zephyr tries to administer a drive-by Heimlich -> 6!
* Eleanor is knocked over.
* Amy is shocked that Nick tried to kill her girlfriend, gets the ball dislodged.
* Venomous stare at Zephyr and Nick. Trying very hard not to stare at Melody.
* Z: "Mel, help." M: at a loss.
* Nick makes a scene, shoves Lewis, shouts - making himself the object of everyone's memory as the unruly jerk.
* N: "I didn't wanna come here! I don't like doing this stuff! You all just push me around!"
* Z: didn't force you do anything! You wanted to be here!
* N: well now I don't! (Nick runs off)
* M: Is this a prank? I don't understand.
* Z: Nick is being nick.
* Nick's running. He sees an ambulance coming. But it's not going to THIS party, but Nick fears that it is.
* Amy: "He's the problematic one, isn't he."
* M: "Don't know what's going on, haven't seen him act like that before."
* Z: "Yeah.. Problematic."
* Discussion of first aid, Heimlich maneuver, superheroes.
* Meanwhile Nick has run off to a park. Exercise gear, bench.
* Nick thinks about what an asshole he just was.
* He's mentally playing through the scene, torturing himself with it.
* M: what happened?
* Z: when alcohol is involved, people aren't the best versions of themselves.
* M: oh no, this is what Fiona meant!
* Z: are you actually able to get drunk?
* M: I don't really need to eat or drink, drugs don't work on me.
* Z: so only 50% of our team can get drunk. I'm also immune.
* Z: You were in a band, right? Get the mood of the party back up. Ask the DJ if they can play one of your songs.
* M: Hey Erica, can you play a dance song? We can get things going again.
* Erica: Yeah, sure.
* Monstercat song!
## The Mysterious Stranger
![Romanus](/uploads/sycamour/romanus.jpg "Romanus")

* A boy approaches: you okay?
* Nick, clearly fucked up: Yeah things are good.
* Doesn't look like you're good
* N: Yeah I get that a lot.
* Anything going on?
* N: just was doing something I shouldn't have been doing.
* Now you're all alone in the park?
* N: Yep
* Wait, you're that Nick Knack guy. Urge to say yes.
* N: Yep
* Wide smile on the other guy's face. I knew it! Can I get your autograph?
* What is Nick feeling from this guy? Nothing he's handing over is bad, but he's bad.
* He seems .. familiar.
* N: I don't do autographs.
* Guy: you just destroyed a factory. Are you proud of what you've done?
* N: I didn't destroy it, whoever was in charge set off a self-destruct.
* Guy: oh! really. I see. But still. Are you proud, did you help people?
* N: Yeah, I'm proud of saving the kids we've saved.
* Guy: whose idea was it to target Sycamour?
  * He's got a disgusting aura around him.
* Nick turns this power around, telepathic suggestion to ignore him - if I'm beneath your notice, I'll disappear. -> 7
* Guy looks around, starts laughing. Still feel urge to tell the truth.
* Nick starts running away.
* After a certain distance, all Nick can think about is the Sycamour logo, with accompanying headache/migraine.
* Nick sends a group chat with picture of where he is, enough to find him but not much more.
## Keep the Party Going!
* Melody tries to fix the party -> 6
* Nope it's not fixed
* Zephyr is helping out, +1
* They get the location ping from Nick!
* Z: I've seen My Hero Academia, I know this is bad. Stain can paralyze you with blood.
* M: I don't have blood, I'll be fine.
* Nick is passed out. Sycamour symbol on his back.
* M: Normally these say something like "kick me"
* Zephyr runs Nick to Red Vox HQ.
* In the medical bay, he's checked out.
* "Were you guys drinking?" Z: He might have gone to a party before.
* Z unlocks Nick's phone, looks for "mom" in contacts. Texts her saying: crashing at friend's place tonight. Nick will cool off in the Red Vox medbay.
