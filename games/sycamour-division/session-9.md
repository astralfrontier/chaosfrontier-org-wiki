Student council wants to foster interactions.
Dallas has been assigned to get Nick Hel interested in student activities & talking to people.
Nick is matched with Hans Green (chess club), Emily Ambrose (library), David Everman (new person)
Ayami gets matched with everyone because she's v. sociable

Dallas texts back: I'll start with this Nick kid. He could use some more friends.
Everyone is in the same class. Dallas will ambush Nick then.

Zephyr: can I beat them without giving myself away? Assess -> 10
An experienced martial artist could kick their asses

The Bunny Brigade hops away.

## Lunch

Melody in lunchroom. Approached by Lance Hopper. "You wanted to join the track team?"
M: "been asked to join a lot of things!"
She's pretty new & doesn't know what's going on.

Is Zephyr a part time or honorary member? Sure.

M: I sit with Lewis sometimes! He's a really nice guy!
There's plenty of other good people such as INSERT LIST OF NAMES HERE.
Track team meets Monday @ 2pm. Melody will drop by sometime. (wink). Lance: "uhhh"

## Mission Impossible

Dallas doesn't want to give LH identity away, Nick can't read minds.

D: Team = Together Everyone Accomplishes More!
N: I never knew that!
D: you don't have to do it now. stick around and have lunch.

D: just a thing with my mom?
N: did anyone come looking for you? like a superhero or something?
D: PANIC.
D: I have an internship. I work part time at this lab. Mom forgot.

D: can't believe you sent them to me!
Z: sent students in need of direction to a responsible member of student body.
N: I think Dallas has done a great job.
Z: Nick, you seem to know about this.
N: superheroes are like cops. Mom's life sucks, I think it must be like that.
D: people accuse us of misusing power. like stealing pens.
N: don't want those kids to get hurt.
D: they want to jump right into the deep end.
Z: from water rescue experience, that's a bad idea.
D: plus they're freshmen, 14, that's like babies.
Nick nods along. Logan's Run is how it is.

Nick runs off to present himself at the library.

Nick introduces both girls.
M: can you help me find these books?
E: ...
M: they said to read 50 shades on the downlow, something about having the stomach for it, I have no stomach.

Nick explains stomach. "I don't understand" is common for me too
Nick nerds out about reading.
Emily: yeah. it's .... cool. Awkward. Maybe let's find you literature that's more well written.
