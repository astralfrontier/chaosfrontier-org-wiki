<!-- TITLE: Sycamour -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Sycamour -->

# General Notes
* Sycamour seems to be a villain organization
* Their higher-ups have developed a process of transferring powers from existing supers to new ones, such as the Children of the Night
* The process might involve blood transfusion

## Absentia
![Absentia](/uploads/sycamour/absentia.jpg "Absentia")

> Laser Hawk, you recognize Absentia. You recognize them too well. They were your best friend in highschool last year before they disappeared after that orphanage burned down. Melody, you know them too. You've seen them talk to Fiona on her dayjob as a therapist, and she's always said how she's so close to getting them on the right path. They, however, don't recognize either of you. LH for obvious reasons, but they never really paid attention to Melody.

* Can phase through solid objects

## Dubium
![Dubium](/uploads/sycamour/dubium.jpg "Dubium")

> Zephyr, you recognize this girl Dubium. She was there when you got your powers, and when Nightquake killed your predecessor. Ever since then, she's been a rather... Outspoken fan of yours. That is, until that orphanage burned down.

> Nick, you know her too. When you were younger, you picked up a stray teddy bear on the street, since you were trying to get a hang of your powers. Unfortunately, when you grabbed it, you saw that same girl being beaten-- even shedding blood-- by what appear to be orphanage staff.

* Creates metal constructs from the iron in her own blood
* May become anemic if she overloads her powers
* May have inherited a power from a senior Sycamour individual
* Currently in possession of Bruce, the teddy bear
* First name is "Lucy", last name unknown

## Grando
![Grando](/uploads/sycamour/grando.jpg "Grando")

> Nick, you've seen Grando before, and it wasn't under the best of terms. Hel had you look on his memories to find incriminating evidence-- and it worked. He got jailtime for 2 days before his orphanage paid the bail.

> Laser Hawk, you also know this guy. He frequented your skate park, and always caused trouble. Oddly enough, he always did it when you were around. But that's not all. Once, on one of his tantrums, your mother came with you to watch you show off a new technique you learned. Things got so bad when he saw you pull it off, he ran to your mom, and punched her square in the jaw. You're still not sure why he did it, but you definitely don't like him very much.

* Can manifest ice powers, including an "ice skateboard" analogous to Laser Hawk's.

## Romanus
![Romulus](/uploads/sycamour/romulus.jpg "Romulus")

* Confronted Nick alone in session 8
* Has some kind of ability to compel people to speak the truth
