> Team Irish Drinking song: Prom Edition

Oooooooooooh ai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai
There was a team called LMNZ
Working for Red Vox
Melody, Nick and Zephyr
Don’t forget Laser Hawk
They’re getting a week off
They’re going to prom
It’s their break from villains
Nothing could go wrong!

Oh ai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai
Shopping wasn’t easy
Drama left and right
The whole team had concluded
They’re better in a fight
Somehow they survived it
The mall’s intact but wait
We’ve forgotten something
Zephyr has no date!

Oh ai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai
Dallas tries to wingman
Thinks he’s being smooth
Everything was going fine
But she’s not into dudes.
So he’ll spill some water
On the next girl’s dress
Anyone got a towel?
Dallas what the heck?!

Oh ai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai
The team meets up for movies
Watching some Top Gun
Friends, popcorn, and fighter jets
What could be more fun?
Melody starts blushing
Nick’s embarrassed, too
Alex has zero interest
In shirtless Tom Cruise

Oh ai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai (Dallas in background: But HOW?!)
Oh ai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee dai dee daiiiiiiiii
