The room is, to all observers, drenched. It's clear that more water than mere rain entered the premises, though its source is unclear. Linen, the low traditional table at the center of the room, and more surfaces are covered with a fine spray of mist. But what could have happened?

Chi-Yosh looks through the window, making note of the ledge. A nod to his suspicions, as he looks over the room again. "If someone came through the window, they would have been soaked, from the climbing up onto the roof, then this ledge, to get into the room. It would have rolled off them in waves upon the carpet."

Ramar looks about carefully, his every sense coming alive as the presence of danger or foul play makes itself known. "She's gone..." Ramar echoes, as his head turns to sweep his gaze across the room, searching for signs of immediate danger. "And whatever it is that did this may still be lurking about here... if they're not long gone..."

Concentrating for moments, Ramar feels the unmistakeable feel of Essence charging through his body, lighting up his nerves and awakening the thousand sleeping senses that lie dormant within. He looks with new eyes at the scene; ears, nose, and the like all sharpen. To his nose now floats the delicate scent of Marina's body chemistry, faint but still recognizable. He can see, too, the tiniest imprints of footsteps - calmly walking, rather than wildly moving - as the water on the floor absorbed the residual dirt and grime. Whatever the motive or manner of the woman's departure, it was a peaceful one.

The more obscure senses that Davron employs, those based on his familiarity with the supernatural, tell another story. Somewhere in this room lingers residual magical power. From Marina's Charms, or another source? It's difficult to tell, but some lingering mystic aura is still present. Whatever its origin, it too feels pacified, calm, not charged with anger.

Ramar gestures towards the ground now, pondering. "See there," he says, his voice almost too soft to be heard. "There are footprints, calmly walking along the water... I can still smell her presence, though it's faded with time. I can say though, that she left peacefully, though her motives and manners are unknown to me as of yet." Ramar seems to relax a little, though he's still very, very puzzled.

"Magic's been used here," Davron adds, glancing about the room. "I lack the training to say what sort, but... I don't sense anger, like I did when the lightning struck the fortress. Perhaps it was just Marina's Charms, but... what if a spirit had been here? A water-spirit? We'd hoped to hear the spirits' side of this conflict - perhaps she's succeeded." He taps his chin. "Nevertheless, we still need to find her, wherever she's gone."

A slow sigh from Chi-Yosh, more of relaxation. Marina went peacefully, at the very least. "Perhaps she talked them down. Or surrendered." She had not struck him as given to defense and offense, relying on her silver tongue. Perhaps the exploits were better then those seen on the bridge. Though, he does look up to Davron, glancing to the window. The image of a watery thing flowing in to politely collect Marina... "Even if she has went peacefully, she would not have left without leaving us a message, or a sign. Peaceful or no, she was taken, without the notice of anyone else."

Ramar ponders, "A spirit... here... it is entirely possible, yet you are right. We must find her." His head lifts upwards, mind swimming with the information his new senses relay to him. They are interwoven with the flow of Essence, drawn towards the footprints one more, as the Wanderer follows the trail towards their exit point... he examines the ledge carefully, and then begins searching for signs of her with every sense made ready to him. His eyes scan the ground for imprints, Essence drawn to them to enhance their sight, the Essence swirls invisibly about his nostrils, causing each scent to become more apparent from the next. He is also listening to the soudns of the city around, searching for a familiar voice... Marina's voice...

"I've found her trail," says Ramar, as he comes back off of the ledge. "Follow me." He then moves swiftly down the stairs and out the door, taking care to keep in mind where precisely her trail had been. Once outside, he proceeds immediately to where he'd last detected her trail... "She's come this way," he says, nostrils flaring at the multitude of scents wafting through the air... "And I think Fish Stew is going to be served for dinner..." Ramar continues after the errant Marina's path.

Davron follows Ramar down the stairs, keeping station behind Ramar. "Be ready for anything. She could be in negotiations, or in danger, or anything else, and if we act too hastily, it could jeopardize our cause, or Marina, or both. Lead the way, Ramar!"

The path leads outward and upward - out, that is, of the capital, and up one of the multitudinous paths that the travellers now know decorate the mountainsides of the valley here.

"A spirit for sure," Davron mutters, but says little else of that train of thought, intent on the path ahead, and on Ramar in the lead.

Chi-Yosh continues after the two, fingers on ends of his Kamas' hilts, the dual blades perched in sheaths at his waist. He has his eyes all around, concern for the fourth leg of the living thing that is their team may be in full danger. He suspects this is one reason he has found this group; to handle situations like this, with as grim as it might get. A gaze up the mountain, a frown. She has been drawn up, away from the city itself. Perhaps for fewer people who may see?

Ramar heads out of the capital. He continues along the path, glancing up towards the mountainsides. "It looks like we'll be in for a bit of climbing soon... unless her path doesn't head that way in the end. Be careful though... as you've said, we should be ready for everything..."

Following ever more faintly-visible tracks, Ramar leads the way up and around twisting, curvy paths gouged into the very rock by the procession of centuries of feet. Rounding one enormous rocky outcropping,the party stops dead as the path splits off into a 'T'-shape, running at the base of a high and foreboding cliff face from which jagged stone juts menacingly.

Ramar's ears perk, and he holds up a hand to signal for silence. His head tilts towards the left, inclining as though he were listening to something. "There are people at the top of the left path, between six and twelve I'd say... it sounds as though they've some metal with them... though I cannot say whether it is weapons, armor, or simply tools... shall we investigate?"

At first, Chi-Yosh is concerned with the fork. Yet, Ramar's skill with tracking seems impressive; perhaps his senses will not be lied to here. However, at the news, the Su'Katan peers up the trail, then glances back to Ramar. "If it is our quarry, then do we find a place to plan our action?"

Ramar studies the footprints that lay on the ground, examining the faint imprints and traces of people's passages. "Blast! I cannot tell which direction Marina's path has lead. I cannot say for certain if this is our quarry... her recent prints seem to simply lose themselves within the multitudinous footprints here... my best guess would be that these people at the top at the cliff had been walking this path in a sort of circuit... they may have seen her."

Davron takes a few deep breaths as he catches up to the other two. "We can't make many plans until we know who they are and what they intend. I'd like to see them before they see us, but I fear I'm not very good at that sort of thing - they'd hear me coming a mile away."

Ramar nods, "I believe, that as we are unable to ascertain what they are, we should investigate. They certainly can provide us with information about likely places that someone might go... I shall learn more of them as we get closer to them. Though they will likely know we are coming. Come along then," says Ramar as he heads towards the cliff-tops.

Chi-Yosh does not like walking straight up with strides to those who may hold Marina. It merely feels... dangerous. A trap? He would prefer to stalk in and atleast listen and watch first before making decisions. But this terrain doesn't call for that. With uncertainty, worry, and hope that it will be less then his cautious mind suspects, he follows Ramar.

Davron nods and follows wordlessly, hanging back a few steps behind the leader, prepared for nothing more specific than to stand and watch, and learn, when he and his fellows reach the end of the path.

The three Solars take the left path, ascending slowly but surely and arcing in a curve up the face of the cliff, feeling the chill wind blowing against their faces. In a short space of time the path leads them past the edge of the cliff itself, bringing into full view some ten men, all armed in some fashion, and all peculiarly painted. Bare to the waist, wearing little more than roughly-cured leather breeches and boots, these seeming primitives turn as one to regard the trespassers. "It's them," observes one. "They are not guarded," says another. And with this unhelpful exchange completed, all ten begin advancing with weapons out.

Chi-Yosh frowns. Very well. Weapons out, unguarded they say? They are not here to parlay and distract. There are ten to three. If one must suffer a harsh wound, to make the others back down... so be it; perhaps they may flee like the bridge men. But he doughts not. A single Kama is plucked from it's place, the Su'Katan taking a step to the side, before essence flows through his being. Blossoming from his legs to the ground, he takes two short sprints and then a hop, feet a quick two step across the wall of stone that is the cliff face. Then, leaning in, he kicks off the wall, angling his body in hopes to roll over the men. Though arms move counter; both brace the Kama, and as the shoulder of one man comes into view, he swings in a side slash, putting his weight into it; if he succeeds, the flesh will put hook him, let Chi-Yosh ground himself behind.

Staggering, the man fails to interpose his axe in time. He stumbles, though his fellows rally to cut down their companions' attacker.

"Waiting for us, are you? But are you _ready_ for us?" Davron calls out defiantly, unslinging his bow smoothly and reaching for his quiver. He grimaces, as his companion's blades seem to cut less deeply into the barbarian than they should, but too late, his hand is already in motion. _Twang!_ _Twang!_ the bowstring sings, sending two feathered shafts winging toward his opponents, before Davron takes a step back, gathering Essence around himself as he prepares for their counterattack.

One of the hostile strangers leans back just in time, the arrow missing his head by at least a foot. The one next to him is not so lucky, stopping in his tracks and dropping his weapon to clutch briefly at the arrow in his heart before collapsing.

"So... it's to come to this..." Ramar's eyes flash softly in the light, betraying the presence of Essence swirling softly about... his gaze has drifted elsewhere though. It's as though in that one instant, it's as though they are moving in slow motion. _Ah, the one will head towards me..._ The paths of the others followed, as he guides his body through the mist, curling his blade along the path of one of the men near Chi-Yosh, joining his comrade in battle. Hie tries to end with his blade slashing along the edge of the weapon in an attempt to drive his blade home. Blade aimed at this one, his comrade comes to join in the fight... ahhh here he comes... Ramar plants his heel behind him, digging an indentation in the mud as he pivots, his blade moving in a sideways arc, slicing through rain as the Solar brings his weapon to bear on a second target.

Ramar's blade manages to hit home with the first primitive... _If that's truly what they are..._ though it's not a deep wound. As the blade swings about though, it's arc is deflected, glancing off of the fellow's... skin? _Not even a scratch..._

Of the ten who were originally clustered, some six have backed away, forming twin trios with which to fence the Solars in. They move now, weapons at the ready. Those who are left are fallen, or at least seriously injured, and they seem uninterested in doing anything but falling behind the covering cordon of their allies.

Ramar's blade falters slightly as he makes an attempt to parry one of the incoming thrusts. He'd been too overextended with that last thrust and now he winces as he feels the sting of the weapon biting through the armor, scratching the flesh beneath. He glowers at the one who scored a hit on him... _Gah... that shouldn't have happened... I must remember to keep my defenses up, and to dodge..._

The one Davron missed, apparently, took it personally. He and another of his companions rush the bowman, who moves with oddly fluid grace as he leaps from rock to rock. Davron stumbles briefly as a lucky blow smashes into his chainmail, driving the rings deep into the leather undershirt but leaving him unhurt - he soon rights himself, fire glinting in his eyes as he faces his foes.

The attackers are good. Their defenses are... impressive. Skin like stone. Chi-Yosh gives them his full attention, willowed grace rolling through his body. A sword slices in, too close for comfort; the duck and roll of one Kama catches it in the hook, turning it up and to the side. However, the attacker's ally brings the axe head around, scratching across the chain shirt with a horrible shriek, earning sparks that light up the night. But rain and sweat is all that the blade is wet with, thankfully.

Chi-Yosh backs up, just a step, and sets his feet apart, bracing for the duo's onslaught. His blades are held up, poised like some capable, ready force. He gazes back at them with neutral eyes. They can attack, be elluded, and then he will strike them down. Or they can surrender, and not be harmed. It doesn't look any different in his eyes. He is merely prepared, and ready to execute. Let them come.

Davron grits his teeth. It's obvious these men mean business, whoever they are... whatever they are... and with that thought, Davron decides that it's fruitless to hide his own true nature any longer. As his sailing leaps bring him alight on a slight outcrop at the edge of the cliff face, a foot off the ground, the half-filled circle burns into brilliant life atop his brow, and his hand leaves a sparkling trail of Essence as it moves like lightning between bowstring and quiver, two arrows flying toward the barbarians that trail but a few paces behind him, and a third whistling through the air in vengeance for the blow that marked Ramar.

And the Arrows of Heaven find their marks. Ramar's erstwhile foe clutches at his throat as a steel arrowhead bursts through it in a spray of blood, while one of Davron's pursuers crashes into the cliff face in mid-pursuit, a feathered shaft protruding from his eye. The other pursuer fares somewhat better, but still sports an arrow in the shoulder and grimaces painfully as he glares at Davron.

Ramar's eyes narrow now. He regards his two attackers, one living, one dead, and shakes his head slowly. "It doesn't have to end this way..." The tip of his sword rests in line with his nose, though it's extended outwards. His sword-hand is slightly to the right, and as the rain falls, he once more plots the course of his blade. This time he stabs downward, sliding the tip of the blade through the mud and flinging it upwards, disturbing both Earth and Water with this motion. A spray of mud flies through the air, along with traces of chipped stone made somewhat more visible by the light drizzle falling. A single stab upwards, easily parried, though it leaves him set up to make a perfect counterattack, a sideways slash across the fellow's chest, and Ramar follows the motion through with a simple spin, one that exposes his back for but a moment, as though inviting the attacker to take a stroke, before he's once more facing his opponent, muscles tensed and ready to spring out of the way.

With a glint of light as it turns, Ramar's blade scores a line across the primitive's chest, pushing through some unseen resistance, mixing flesh and water with sharpened steel. Ramar returns his sword to a readily defensive position with a simple little flourish. He locks eyes with his opponent, "Although, if you wish to press the attack... by all means... do so."

Chi-Yosh's attackers come at him with zeal; they accept the challange. Downward decends the axe in an overhead chop. This he catches in the bend of the weapon, pulling it aside to intercept the spearman's own weapon. This startles him, the spear's forward thrust brought to the side, sliding over the kama-wielding man's shoulder. Leaning downward, bringing the axe nearly to cleave the very dirt, he darts backwards with his Kamas raised, watching the two spread out more. He can't just dance away from them now. Let his weapons taste blood next.

These men are determined, not stupid. A third of their number have departed to a bourne from which there is evidently no returning; a third of them have received no injury whatsoever, but only that much; and their attacks have not aided them to do more than minor damage. Those who can, back away, forming a semicircle around those who are down and wounded.

Chi-Yosh watches as the men pull back, to guard their wounded, and does not pursue. He remains on the balls of his feet, ready to react to aggression with swift movements. But for now... "Who has sent you," He calls forward to the wall of men, "Who payed you to halt and attack us?"

"I did tell you it didn't have to end this way. Now then, I believe that my comrade has a few questions which need answering... if you will answer them that is. Or, if you'd like, I'm sure we can fight some more." Ramar speaks up after Chi-Yosh does, inclining his head towards the fellow, indicating that he is the one whom the answers should likely be given to.

Davron draws a sixth arrow from its quiver and nocks it, but does not draw. The glitter of his caste mark lights up the mist as he calls out as well, "Decide quickly! We are in haste... but we can still spare the time to learn why you delay us."

There's a tremendous roaring sound, as from a human throat greatly enlarged, and from further up the path - over the edge of the cliff almost directly overhead, in fact - leaps an enormous humanoid figure, clearly one of the Wyld-twisted barbarians, similar in attire to those who stand sheltering their wounded. This impressive figure wields two axes of comparable majesty and terrible sharpness, and his feet fairly shake the mountainside as he lands betwixt the party and its attackers. This giant rises from his crouch, smiling grimly. "These men serve me," he says in a low voice, and turning his back on the trio, he gestures. Immediately his henchmen begin gathering the wounded up, making ready to carry them.

Davron eyes the apparition warily, pulling the bowstring back slightly. "We ask of you, then - who are you, and why do you hinder us? Do you waylay passing travelers for sport? Or were _you_ paid off?"

Chi-Yosh backs up a little bit. Not out of fear... atleast, obvious fear. No, he's looking for more defendable ground, a rock to dodge behind, higher ground. Something. He wants a touch of distance, of moving room, of something between... the once-man. His weapons pale in comparison to the twin axes. A head first attack would be a touch foulish... he can wait, hope Davron releases a few arrows if the group, or the axe-wielder decides to attack. Hopefully he will simply answer, though luck is likely not on that thought. of them attack.

The giant makes no reply, watching instead with axes crossed as his men are carried up the path still further. Only when they are distant enough to make even arrow-shot a questionable thing does he turn. In that same rumbling, powerful voice he speaks, as rough black brows furrow together. "Come to my forest, when you are ready, God-blooded," he says at last, pointing northward with one axe. "We will settle this question of honor at another time." And so saying, he begins walking, ascending the mountainous path as well.

"We are following the path of our comrade, and only seek to find her... yet you say there is a matter of honor to be settled amongst us... what is this matter to be settled, so that we might know and settle it properly when the time comes?" Ramar looks curiously at the huge Wyld-twisted barbarian, his tone of voice shifting to one that would be given to a somewhat respected opponent. His fingers flex around the hilt of his sword, while he thinks back to his days in the desert, with yet another Wyld Barbarian.

The giant keeps walking, heedless of Ramar's question.

Davron sighs and steps down from the rock, touching his hand to his forehead. "Perhaps I shouldn't have declared our nature so openly..." he says. "But that man would doubtless appreciate the direct approach in any case." He reslings his bow on his back. "Still, where is Marina? Do we try the other path now, or follow them?"

Chi-Yosh takes a deep breath, and moves back towards his companions. "If he is going that way, and expects to see us again in the north, then Marina is not that way. We would quarrel with him if we head further this way. She must be the other way." He does not want to run up behind the giant immediately. No, preperations are at hand. Him, afraid? Well, yes. But his thoughts are not cowardly fuelled.

"I suspect either path may lead towards her... although it seems as though these men have been patrolling the area recently, so perhaps she managed to evade them." Ramar nods to Davron, "You are right, but the point remains that we have a matter of honor to settle. When it comes to it. But Marina is the most important problem to settle at the moment. Do you see any signs of her?"

Davron rubs his chin, frowning skeptically. "Are you certain? Perhaps they have her, and plan to take her north with them to wait for us... but no," he goes on, "if they'd captured her, he'd have told us. He wouldn't beat around the bush like that. Yes, let's take the other path and see what we find."

"Then it is the other path which we shall take... may it lead to Marina, and may the Sun keep her safe and unharmed." Ramar heads back towards the other path, though he is keeping his eyes and ears open for signs of Marina as he looks about in the mist and mud. "Where **is** she?"

Chi-Yosh follows them down the mountain towards the fork in the road. Kamas in sheaths - though hands resting firmly on the hafts - the warrior walks in silence. He did not handle himself as good as he should have. But there are more pressing matters then his prowess in battle; that of Marina's whereabouts, and the reason for her leaving. And even that much... what awaits them in the north, and Who it is that awaits them. He does not like that large barbarian, threatening or no. For he knows not what he has done to blemish the large man's honor. But he knows that the truth shall be discovered, for their mission will likely take them to Korad... if he likes it or not. And he was actually hoping to enjoy Korad, until now.

The Solars continue their climb, and again guided by Ramar's keenly-honed senses and knowledge of tracking in all its forms, come to a level bowl hollowed out of the mountains by time and erosion. In this small space, lush green grass and plants of every variety grow, even at this high altitude. The bowl is dominated by a pool of water, circular in shape, whose diameter is at least sixty feet. Curiously, this small shelter in the mountains is entirely free from the cursed weather, and the Sun shines brightly and reassuringly down.

This is the end of the unmarked road Marina must have followed, and yet it is not at all a well-used path. What would compel the woman to climb to this altitude is a mystery, but the strangeness of it is compounded by motion at the center of the water. From the central point of the pool, a shape begins to rise.
