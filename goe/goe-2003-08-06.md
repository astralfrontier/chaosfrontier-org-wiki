"This way my friends. It shall only take a minute or so to attune ourselves to the environs and we shall become more... aware of Heavenly Aspect of Water." Ramar is sounding remarkably calm, very patient, and perhaps somewhat uncertain as well. It was an easy trek out of the Korad camp. The trip through the forest was a delight, which culminated in Ramar taking to the trees and removing his shoes to stride along the branches. They bend and creak as he glides over them, yet none of them snap, none of them break... Essence is lightening his body, keeping him far more agile than he might otherwise be. "The trees here are old. Perhaps they've been protected by the spirits to keep the axes away... it's awe-inspiring, I should say." He passes along the understory, shifting between light and shadow, caused by the filtering leaves of the canopy. "Keep your eyes open though, we may have crossed the Spirit Tracks into the lands of another tribe."

Ramar says, "Or if we haven't, we won't want to."

While the sailor is free to prance the trees, Chi-Yosh walks upon the ground, more somber then normal. Normally he would take the chance to dance on the limbs of the earth, perhaps even make sport of chasing Ramar all the way to the spirit pool. Yet he is troubled. What should he do? Should he speak to those of the Circle regarding his dreams, ask them to join him on his journey home, to deal with inevitable battle? Or should he go alone, and make his risks greater, put them in danger as well? They are aware of many things he is not, such as the sorcery which the jaguar Exalt used to contact his dreams. There is no question he must return, for his dreams are his, and they should not be coveted. No telling, also, what tortures that could happen to him if he did not. Fouler things may be brought down on his head for refusing to take the challenge. With every step, the indecision earns an echoing doubt in the Su'Katan's mind.

Davron shakes his head at Ramar. Not quite as nimble as his two compatriots, he favors a more steady, and ground-bound, path through the forest. "We'll stay well away from those if we can, Ramar. We've been warned about them - quite aside from Korad tribes, the spirits themselves are not to be trifled with." He has little else to say... his mind is too occupied with the events of the past several days, and what they might mean.

Ramar nods, "Indeed. Staying clear of them seems to be the general consensus." The Solar then drops down out of the trees. "But perhaps, we should cease needless chatter and head South, before I continue on... after all, without Marina here to quip at me, I'm not sure I know when to stop." Ramar then falls ponderously silent, drawing in a deep breath in which his whole body becomes a bit more alert. He continues South, leading the way with his senses as enhanced as they can be.

Continuing on, without much in the way of ambushes, bandit way-layers, barbarian raiders, and other fun stuff, the trio of Solars makes their way South. A day passes by, and they find a spot at which to make camp. The night, similarly passes uneventfully, though the scenery is quite beautiful. The trees, nearer to the Spirit's Pool begin to grow brighter in color. Their branches seem to sweep the sky and the leaves crunching underfoot were perhaps once gems held aloft by branches of shimmering gossamer, now faded and feeding the soil beneath. The mountains are no more or less inviting than they had been before, though the absence of a Barbarian party waiting to attack them is bound to speed things up as the three find themselves on the winding path that leads back to Heavenly Aspect's pool.

Time passes. The trio of Solars remain still, contemplating the pool. Dusk is only minutes away when Luna comes into view overhead, faint and silvery and ethereal. She is joined as dusk arrives by her sister Gaia, the Blue Moon, shining like an aquamarine in the sky. Both sisters blow soft kisses of light downwards into Creation, and in their twin light the pool gains its own glow. Only moments pass before Heavenly Aspect of Water rises from her resting place, stretching out her slender arms and yawning softly. The woman blinks a few times, then glances up at her guests. "Welcome," she says softly, bowing.

Chi-Yosh smiles unto the watery woman, as the mantis sits comfortably on his shoulder. On the trip he had asked Patient Mantis for training, after a conversation learned that the spirit knows much when it comes to the unarmed battle, sparked by a comment about the warrior's chosen weapon. He offers a slight bow to Heavenly Aspect. "Luna's gaze is very good to you," He says to her with a polite smile, noting how well the silvery light refracts within her form.

Davron bows graciously in response. "Well met again, milady," he says. "It is good to see you are well. We are here to seek your counsel once more, for we have learned much more about the war that plagues these lands - and from those we least expected to learn it." He then begins to tell Goran's story as it had been related to them, including the naming of Chirog as Goran's betrayer (as there are none to hear but Heavenly Aspect and his own companions). "Marina has remained behind with Goran, to learn the truth of his ambitions for Korad, and what peace he may be willing to make with Syllum. But we fear that, even if the Korad tribes and Syllum can come to terms, that the spirits may yet carry on the war for their own reasons, now that their ancient grudges have been reawakened. And so we come to you... for you were named as one whose voice is listened to amongst the spirits of this land."

Ramar's head dips respectfully, and it is followed by a gesture of greeting and respect. His body inclines slowly, as he drops down to a knee. He looks up, "Greetings to you Heavenly Aspect of Water. That you are well brings joy to the hearts of those presence. As Davron has said, we have come here to learn what we can from you... if you can tell us such a thing. We would also ask what courses of action you might observe or suggest as being ones that should be avoided..." He straigthens. "I should also wish to inform you that I do not think the barbarians will try to detroy you."

"So it is," says the spirit, inclining her head gently and frowning. "The spirits will listen to a strong leader, one who matches their power but does not seek to govern them. You must find a woman with the character of Malseyn, a woman like Marina.. It was her I saw in my dream, and it is her who can restore order to the Celestial Hierarchy. But those who spur the spirits on must first be made to listen to reason, and to cease their hostility."

Chi-Yosh considers the words, and regards Heavenly Aspect with curiousity. "If we find such a person," He asks, "Will they be requested to pass over, and be a steady influence in the spirit's court, or may they merely visit, on this occasion? For if it's the former, I doubt Marina is willing to stay and be a steady figure in the court."

Heavenly Aspect shakes her head. "To visit is enough. Malseyn lived in the material world all her life."

Ramar nods, "This is true. She is good at this sort of thing. Marina has a knack for negotiating... it is her calling. Her gift. You should perhaps approach her, after we have done so to ensure that she believes us. But what else can be done in the meantime, for Mortals are as stubborn as Spirits, if not moreso, it is said."

The "little god" shakes her head again. "I cannot answer that.. I know only that the Ministers are loyal to Syllum. If you would find peace, you must convince them that to continue this conflict would bring harm to the kingdom..."

Ramar says, "And we have already seen how easy that will be. What more can we do, Heavenly Aspect? What more can we learn of the Spirits and their motives in fighting? What can you tell us of... Gulderak...?"

Chi-Yosh considers, and glancse to Heavenly Aspect. "Goran said that old angers were used to reawaken the spirits wrath. Are there old oaths that may still their fighting?"

"You may speak to the gods of thunder, if you wish," says Heavenly Aspect, doubtfully. "As for Gaulderak, he is a potent god. He came from the East, I am told, and even the spirits of wind and water who now do battle are said to fear him." To Chi-Yosh she turns then, eyes bright and troubled. "There may be... to discover those oaths may require the use of this _yurei_ blossom, for no spirit will divulge easily the chains by which it may be bound."

Davron takes a seated position so that he may think - although his mind is on the politics of the physical world rather than the spiritual. "Matters have certainly come to a pretty pass, to be sure. Chirog may have acted wrongly in a greater sense when he took the secret of yurei from the Korad people, but I doubt greatly that he broke any trust in _Syllum_, except possibly in that his actions provoked this weather-war. If we did no more than to expose his role, it's doubtful that the council would denounce him. We would succeed only in raising strife within Syllum - and that may well violate the oath that Marina and Chi-Yosh have sworn," he says, giving the Su-Katan a worried glance. "We cannot risk that."

Ramar nods, "Then we may need to find the _yurei_ blossom. Do you know where we might? Aside from Syllum and the Korad? It is likely thatt hey may be unwilling to share with us. What... what should happen to the Heavenly Bureacracy if a vacuum such as that created by Gaulderak's loss of power, should come to being? If we can find the ancient Oaths, or perhaps... hmmmm."

Davron raises his head. "As to your first question, Ramar, the flower grows in the flower-boxes of Syllum's citadel. Chi-Yosh and I spotted them as we emerged from the library some nights ago. Doubtless Chirog is culturing them - unless they have grown in Syllum all along, their purpose unremarked."

Chi-Yosh nods quickly to Davron, and traces the lines that the sword of Oaths had cut in him. That would be rather bad if it had broken. "If we might find some of the blossom, I may be able to learn many things from it." A smile. "I know of plants and the things they may become. I wish a sample of it. Though I would like the Korad people's permission before any is used."

"Gaulderak is... not part of the Celestial Hierarchy," replies the spirit. "He is his own god, protecting his people and doing as he wishes. But," she adds, "I do not know any people who have perished when their gods failed them. That is the peculiar strength of you men, to persevere."

Ramar nods, "This is true. It is the strength of Mortals to persevere... but even so, the gods still exist... The Unconquered Sun shines no matter what... I am worried about the change to their very way of life. Yet, to know this is to provide us with a good deal more in terms of freedom. Tell me, do you know if Gaulderak came from the East when Kor did?"

Heavenly Aspect shrugs helplessly. "Gaulderak is the god of the Korad. I do not know his history."

"Gaulderak protects the people of Korad, then? Goran seemed to think he only bound them - and we had no opportunity to ask anyone else of the Korad people to tell us any different." Davron looks curious. "How does he protect them, do you know? For if Goran succeeds in his plan to drive Gaulderak from the land, he must needs take up the burden Gaulderak bore. I wonder if he understands this..."

"A god protects his people," says she, "by being strong, and wise. The powerful gods make themselves masters of the spirits and elementals around them. They exact promises of loyalty, or chain the smaller spirits in webs of oaths. They reduce those who were strong, and they empower the weakest spirits, so that none might challenge their might. A god will foretell the future, make war against foreign spirits, and give his people good hunting, fishing or farming. The god sees that justice is done, when a wrong is committed."

Chi-Yosh nods to that, in consideration. "And without their god, the Korad will have to fend for themselves, completely. They will see much hardship, as they are no longer under the watchful eye and protected by promised words."

Davron nods to Chi-Yosh. "Or they must bargain individually with the spirits of their land, once their order has been overthrown."

Ramar nods, "However, they shall then learn to survive. They will find ther spirits to pray to, other blessings to ask... perhaps. I am leary of this, but it brings me comfort to know that Gaulderak's loss of power may actually bring some small degree of freedom to the people."

Ramar raises an eyebrow curiously. He ponders. "Heavenly Aspect... do you suppose that it would be possible to somehow learn of the Oaths which the Spirits of Syllum came to make with one another and the others in the bureaucracy and those outside of it? Do you know anything of them?" Ramar tilts his head slightly, letting the flow of water about the pool help him to collect his thought. _No that's been answered, already._ "The _yurei_ is the key to learning more... but whom shall we rely upon to learn while we are in such a trance? Will you be able to show us that which we need to see?"

"From what I am told, you will be able to learn what you need yourselves," replies the spirit softly.

Davron stands up once more. "Then we shall need to acquire some of the _yurei_ for ourselves." He turns and looks down into the valley. "And the nearest source of that is in the citadel of Syllum itself," he says, sighing and rubbing his chin. "Though I fear we would not find it easy to gain permission to obtain Chirog's supply. ...But let us go down, and have a closer look. When we saw it before, Chi-Yosh and I only noted the flowerbox itself - this time, let us pay attention to where it is, and to whom it belongs."

After conferring quietly for several minutes, the three men nod, and do their polite farewells to the spirit of the pool here. Heavenly Aspect of Water bids them all a safe and productive journey, and her eyes are bright with hope. She favors Chi-Yosh, especially, with a soft and shy smile, then dives back into her watery home.

---

The party is soon standing by the walls of the citadel, gazing at the boxes full of their white blossoms. Their gentle inquiries amongst the townsfolk have borne no fruit - as far as they are concerned, the boxes are just full of flowers, like the boxes of so many other dwellings and buildings in Syllum, and why shouldn't the ministers grow flowers like everyone else?

---

And Marina, always equitable, and remembering always that man was made with two ears to listen, and only one mouth to speak, travels among the Korad tribes. She starts among Goran's people, for to know a leader one must know his subjects. The tribe's name was once translated "the people that dwell at the base of the rolling waves of darker-leaved trees, between the Bear and Briar markers". Today they are the Goranjin, the "People of Goran" in Riverspeak.

Like all the Korad tribes, they live both in the branches and at the roots of the trees in their forest. The deep-delved caves, clustered around the bases of the largest trees and carefully winding around the root systems, are residences. So are most of the "tree-houses", built of woven branches and deadwood. A few of these elevated dwellings serve some ritual purpose. The tribe has not forgotten that the spirits must be propitiated, even when it seeks to escape their power, and the morning air is filled with evaporating dew and the solemn songs of the tribesmen as they voice their daily hymns to the invisible world before going about the day's business.

Likewise, the tribe is eager to show this friendly outlander the work they do. To the northwest of the forest home of the tribes is a bare stretch of land, as fertile as any in the area, and it is here the tribes have begun to learn the art of farming. Slow and simple their farming practices are, like children, and many of their techniques merit improvement. Still, they have observed their neighbors in the Hundred Kingdoms, and done what they can. The crops here supplement the tribe's regular diet of small game and the assorted bounties of the earth.

All of these advances the tribe attributes to Goran and those men and women closest to him. Twenty-five years ago, when the giant was but a young boy, the Spirit Tracks shifted based on the selfish wars of the spirit world, and because of the division, one tribe became two. Many families were split apart; mothers and their sons came into the lands of the Goranjin; fathers and their daughters were spread out into another tribe. The spirits forebade contact between the tribes entirely for a decade while tempers among the "little gods" cooled, and even after the rival spirits permitted the briefest of contact; Goran can once again meet his father, but only if he undertakes a ritual challenge of tribal combat, and the man he would meet at the end of the trial no longer knows him.

The Goranjin rebelled, but slowly, and in subtle ways. The spirits of the land had always been capricious and imperious, but this had taken things too far. The next two decades were spent much as any tribe would spend them, and as Goran grew to manhood, he grew more and more resentful of the arbitrariness of it all. He decided, upon completing his own rites of manhood and being initiated into the male mysteries, that he would become the ruler. He fought, but did not slay, Va - who then ruled, and now faithfully obeys Goran as a devoted lieutenant. He travelled, spending time outside the forest, studying and learning the ways of the outside world. And he returned in time, somewhat better informed.

As to the loyalty and quality of obedience Goran instills in his people, Marina's keenest senses of truth and falsehood detect only simmering resentment from even the most opposed members of the tribe. By and large, Goran's people will live and die at his command. Goran's people describe him (consciously or not, for most know not at all that Marina is pumping them for information) as a strong leader, a man with ambition, and a man whose eyes have been opened to the simple dignities of humankind that those in the Hundred Kingdoms have enjoyed - the freedom to follow your own ruler, to make a family, to live and work to feed yourself, to make war against your own enemies rather than be thrown into battle for the sake of petty tyrants.

Goran is not a particularly compassionate or scholarly man, and he is willing to take by force what he cannot have by negotiation. Still, what he asks is only what he feels he merits, and his people follow him. Three tribesmen have challenged Goran for the right of rulership. All were offered clemency when the big man emerged victorious; two rejected it, and attacked him regardless, and were slain. The third was spared, and has since changed his ways. Though he does not fully support his chieftain, he offers no resistance to his rule.

Satisfied that she can learn all that can be learned, Marina asks for, and is given, the information she needs to travel the Spirit Tracks without incurring the wrath of the Korad, or the spirits. She is taught of the _anganok_, the tribesman who will act as a "guide" to outsiders, shielding the tribe and Gaulderak from a foreigner who speaks uncouth tongues. This one word of Gaulderak is permitted to outsiders, and it is the only word the Goranjin will teach. She is taught briefly of the signs and runes that mark the boundaries of the Spirit Tracks. And so she departs.

Taking care to plot her course through as many diverse tribes as she can in the shortest amount of time, Marina walks the Spirit Tracks, stepping off when invited to do so, and waiting for her _anganok_ to guide her and show her to the tribe. She brings pelts and worked tools of metal, gifts from Goran to the other tribes, as payment for her stay. And how different the tribes are! Spirit-worship and sacrifice permeate their lives far more deeply.

Not one morning prayer, but eight prayers throughout the day, do the tribes offer - once for the Sun, once for the trees, once for the morning meal, once to bless the morning's labors, once at noon for water to drink or wash with, once to bless the afternoon's labors, once for the moon, and finally one to ward the powers of darkness and nightmare. Marina's _anganok_ is always present with her, loudly beating a drum and singing nonsense tunes in Riverspeak so that she might not hear the prayers of the tribe.

These people, too, show somewhat less initiative than the Goranjin. Though by no means unhappy or oppressed in their demeanors, they give every act of hunting or labor a curiously ritual aspect. Chanting and shouting is (by second-hand rumor from the _anganok_) a common tactic in hunting, as the hunters unite themselves in hate of hunger. By revealing their burning spirit to the "little gods" of their prey, the _anganok_ explains, they will overpower it. But aside from hunting, the tribesmen seem content to live and die as they are, neither bettering their lot nor allowing it to be worsened (by suspicious outsiders, for example, as is made clear by one angry tribesman, via translation).

Each _anganok_, too, is very different. A few are old crones, who were gathering roots and berries at the borders of the tribe's land when Marina approached. Many are young boys, sent to scout the outlying areas for likely hunting spots. In rare cases, one of the mature men or women of a tribe will act as _anganok_, though in such cases the guide is found in a group of peers. Such situations seem to be regarded as somewhat embarrassing, as becoming _anganok_ is disruptive to the daily life of a tribesman, and so deciding who among the group will serve the role is often a sort of ostracism. When such an _anganok_ steps out of a group to greet Marina, his or her fellows depart in haste, to avoid contamination.

Those that speak to Marina's _anganok_ in each tribe do so quietly, so as not to be overheard, and the guide answers in kind. In this way, some of Marina's more specific questions are answered. It is clear that the tribesmen regard her in the same fashion that they regard all such - a stranger. Some of the more sophisticated of Goran's tools they regard with a perplexed distrust, as though they were children trying to understand a sharp sword. Of Marina herself, many comments are made; most, she suspects, are translated far more diplomatically than they were originally intended.

Of Goran, too, many comments are made. These mirror much of what was learned from the Goranjin themselves. Goran, by the accounts of the other tribes, is a troublemaker. He's big and scary, in both body and personality. He's nonconformist - not satisfied with what he or his people has. His ambitions for the Korad as a whole are known, or at least very shrewdly suspected. He is no less of a tribal chieftain than any other, except that he dares to defy the traditions of his people, and this flaw outweighs any personal weakness he might possess, in the eyes of rival tribes.

And learning all this, Marina makes her polite way along the Spirit Tracks again, to return to Goran's lands, and consider.
