As morning breaks on a new day, the Circle departs each on their several errands - Marina to seek out Minister Chirog, and Ramar to find the Guild's man. Davron and Chi-Yosh, being left with no immediate responsibilities in the solution to this conflict, decide to take in the library once more - Davron to explore the history of Malseyn and her dealings with the spirits, and Chi-Yosh to learn from him as best he can.

Chi-Yosh follows Davron in the rainfall. He has many thoughts in his mind. The dreams and their implications. A desire to depart from the group, to be alone, perhaps to focus more inward with the patience of the Mantis spirit. And he finds himself curious to speak to Heavenly Aspect. The ways of the spirits, and such seem as likely from the mouth of one of them, then just in the written glyphs on the pages of old paper. But he finds the lack of the knowledge to decipher those words a weakness.

While Davron chooses a selection of texts and settles in for some reading, Chi-Yosh is busy studying the maps and other pictoral resources of the library. Remembering growing up, the man looks at some of the written words on the map before him, and thinks of leaves and roots and flowers. The shape of the leaf was a message. Some shapes meant "poison", while others meant "food", and a rare few meant "medicine". Here, too, are leaves of a sort - distinctive shapes that suggest meanings, though the lore escapes him at the moment.

Chi-Yosh finds a map of the Hundred Kingdoms region, and beyond, that almost sends him reeling. It's a map of the river patterns in the Eastern Threshold, except that its shape is almost identical to that of the Sacred Symbol etched into the living wood of his homeland's holiest shrine. But, where the three dots in the Symbol were, this map has nothing. It's easy enough to locate where the dots would be, of course...

Chi-Yosh stares at the map, and frowns deeply. Though the frown is one of contimplation. The Sacred Symbol... it was the banner of the founder of his village, an accomplished warrior who was said to have found the very spot his home was founded upon, who was granted permission by the very spirits to begin the homestead there. But if that man was world travelled... He looks at the map, where the points should be, to see where they are.

The three dots are recognizable on the map in front of Chi-Yosh. Two correspond to known places, though unexplored in one case - Great Forks and Denandsor, the Empty City, over a thousand miles to the south. The third dot lies only a few hundred miles south of Marita and Nathir, two large city-states that border the Yellow River. No map available gives any evidence of what might be there now.

Map scrutinized, Chi-Yosh leans back, thinking hard. These points must mean something; it is no coincidence that the symbol appears as the rivers. His eyes close. For the life of him, he cannot think of what it may be... There is only two ways to know. Go to these places, or speak to his mentor...

Some of the books the scholar extracted from the library's collection deal with the two founding heroes of the kingdom. All are well-organized and cogently written; as a result, Davron has little difficulty extracting the knowledge he most wishes in a short amount of time indeed. Syldun, the "Warrior of Roses", was formidable in both the martial and medical arts. He loved flowers, and cultivated an impressive garden. Malseyn, the "Speaker to Dragons", of more interest to Davron at the moment, was a great scholar and wise-woman, also somewhat adept at herbs, but particularly interested in spirits and sorcery. She earned her name for a now-legendary quest she undertook to speak to five dragon-spirits, apparently each representing an element, in her ambition to forge a lasting peace among the gods of the valley.

Malseyn was said to have left a legacy behind, something that her children would be able to make use of if they saw fit. And through his researches, Davron is able to find a possible lead - a forgotten fortification, hewn into the mountaintop, which the family of Malseyn visits twice a year for ceremonial reasons. It is isolated and forgotten, but not restricted. The librarian is adamant that all the public books and scrolls Malseyn kept would have been donated to the library.

Try as he might, Davron can extract no hint from any of his books or scrolls that Malseyn was anything other than mortal. If she was God-blooded, she had no 'Tell', no distinctively spiritual characteristics - at least, according to these books. If she was Exalted, she never revealed any hint of such power.

Davron thanks the librarian for his help, and goes to seek Chi-Yosh, finding him eventually, still poring over the atlas. "Well, I think I've found something of what I'm looking for. I'd like to..." he begins, and glances over Chi-Yosh's shoulder. "Ah, a map of the Scavenger Lands. What do you see there that fascinates you so?" he asks, smiling.

Chi-Yosh tilts his head slightly towards his shoulder; the gesture would acknowledge Davron, but not turn his eyes to the man. His finger rises, to trace the corners of the river. "In my village, there is a symbol, a... coat of arms, to a famous hero of my people. It looks like this pattern the rivers make." He omits the dots, just yet.

Davron nods, his eyes widening in interest. "Your people preserved the old knowledge of geography?" he says, his voice touched with respect. "That's..." he adds, fumbling for words. "...I wonder how much more of the old knowledge they may have also kept..." Finally, he shrugs, and smiles again. "But for now, I hope to find what old knowledge this land may have kept. And that hope leads me to the shrine of Malseyn, which I should now like to visit. Have you anything else you would like to study here?"

Chi-Yosh thinks for several long moments, looking from the book, then over to Davron. "Yes," He says after a moment, and his eyes comb the library. "I would like paper, something to draw a pattern on. Something I wish to know about this pattern."

Chi-Yosh and Davron sift through the library until the proper materials are found. He takes a piece of paper, and begins to carefully draw. It is not the most artful of pictures, but it gets the job done; a symbol, one that is drawn from the depths of his memory, the image etched from the mark upon the beastman's head. He turns the paper, handing it to Davron, the warrior's eyes are intent on his scholarly circle-mate. "Can you tell me what this means."

Davron rubs his chin, studying the symbol. "It looks _sort_ of like..." he begins, and then his eyes widen. In a low voice that does not carry further than Chi-Yosh's ears, he says, "I see... it's the caste mark of No Moon... one of Luna's chosen." He looks up at Chi-Yosh, cocking his head in puzzlement. "How did you come across this mark? Have you met a Lunar yourself?"

Chi-Yosh folds the paper carefully, and places it inside of his clothes. The expression does not change in it's intensity, but concern ripples across his face, like something swimming beneath the surface. "Not face to face," He admits, just as quiet. "In a dream. One too... clear to be nothing."

Davron nods slowly, worry creeping into his own visage. "A dream... that was a message, perhaps? Why should a Lunar have cause to send you a message, I wonder?" He shakes his head. "I would hear more of this dream of yours, Chi-Yosh... but perhaps you should also tell the others. But for now..."

Chi-Yosh, to the question, reaches a finger into his shirt, and draws out the hearthstone upon it's string, and merely looks pointedly. This is slipped back in, before he speaks in hushed tones. "You know of Sorcery. I thought... you may know more. But I will tell the others." A glance up as someone drifts towards them, wandering the stacks. A gesture of his head towards the person, to halt Davron's words, and walks towards the door.

The hike up into the mountains is harder; the two Solars follow the paths as best they are able, but must deal with a pair of rock-slides along the way. Finally they reach the craggy peak where the reclusive fortress is reputed to dwell. Its presence is advertised by little more than a series of arrow-slits chiselled into the rock, and the seams of double doors artfully concealed to resemble the surrounding stone. Davron and Chi-Yosh push at the doors, and they creak from disuse. Light spills into the chamber beyond, and satisfied that nothing dangerous lurks within, the pair begin their search.

It is Chi-Yosh who discovers the seams of another door, woven artfully into the rock using techniques now forgotten. The creak of it opening startles Davron, who was busy examining a pair of carved murals depicting a long-forgotten battle. Beyond is a cobwebbed chamber, not even showing the signs of semi-recent use that the outer chambers do - apparently the heirs of Malseyn never made it a point to enter this room frequently, or ever. It seems to be a study, but one designed for longevity. Nothing is wooden; the shelves on which books rest are stone, and a crudely assembled metal table sits at the center. The books themselves look very well cared for, and many seem to be filled with thin metal sheets, rather than paper. Here and there, fragments of paper are carefully stacked in crystalline containers.

Davron paces around the room as if in a dream himself, his fingertips occasionally brushing against the edges of the stone shelves, leaving streaks in the dust that covers them. "All the public books, he said..." he murmurs, remembering the librarian's words. "But Chi-Yosh, it looks like you've found her _private_ books." He carefully brushes the dust away from the spines of a few, wondering what their titles might be...

Chi-Yosh steps further into the room, and looks around with curiousity, poking at the crystal containers, and observing one of the metal books - interesting, them being metal - but there is not much else for him to do. "What are they about?" He inquires, stepping closer to Davron.

Among those books that Davron peruses, three are notable, both for their completeness and for the attention taken to preserve them. The 'White Treatise' and the 'Black Treatise' sit side by side on the shelf, crafted of imperishable metal. The third's title is written in the singularly ancient Old Realm script, but it's a mass of characters Davron recognizes: 'River of Heaven', a scholarly tome from the First Age, so named for the original copy's resting place when it was rediscovered.

Davron shakes his head in wonder. "They're books of sorcery, Chi-Yosh." He scratches his head. "But why would Malseyn collect these? Sorcery is beyond the realm of mortals... Was Malseyn not a mortal after all? Or perhaps she had an ally that is not told of in the books." Tapping his chin, he goes on, "But whatever Malseyn's nature, she's gone now... and these tomes would not be of use to the mortals in the valley. And yet... they _were_ hers. It doesn't seem right to just walk out with them." He glances at Chi-Yosh. "What do you think?"

Chi-Yosh considers this, careful not to lean on the metal desk too much. "They are hers, yet she is not here... and those who should own the books cannot use them." A slow smile graces him, for a moment. "Perhaps The Master will appreciate these books?"

Davron grins broadly at Chi-Yosh. "If he doesn't, _I_ would." He turns back to the shelves. "This room has gone unremarked for centuries, to judge by the cobwebs in this room. If you had not found the entrance, Chi-Yosh, it may yet have gone unremarked for centuries more." He straightens. "We will borrow from Malseyn's library, I think... and return them when we have copies of our own."

Examining further, Davron notes that about half of the fragmented paper represents some sort of extracted information on sorcery, spells and spirits. Some seem to be notes, copied from other sources, probably in Malseyn's own hand, since the writing over several sets of notes is identical. Other parts of parchment deal with mundane matters - contracts, troop movements and other things, which in Malseyn's own day would have been dangerous to release, but which today form a body of text of merely historical interest.

While the scholar immerses himself in the body of knowledge contained herein, Chi-Yosh finds his attention waning, and eventually he turns and walks back out through the doorway to the concealed chamber, following some inner voice that speaks no words, but breathes a soft river of dreams into his mind. In his inner universe he can see the fortifications as they were - or must have been. Men drinking at a wooden table there; arms lined up against the wall there; the heraldry and devices of an age of man now long-gone.

Chi-Yosh can see them. He has looked at pictures of such in the books of Nane while he visited, while they stayed for the brief period before the trip to Syllum. And he can just imagine the plans that were used. The keep seems deserted, useless. There is no worry in him wandering. And while wandering, eyes are kept aware of other potentially hidden rooms; where there is one, who knows, perhaps there are two. Still, just the curiousity of what these walls could tell finds him, and thus he prowls.

_Gaia calls me back... but for now, I have been called.._ The voice is soft, strange, and quiet in Chi-Yosh's ears. It is the voice of an unseen being, a spirit or ghost. _You have found the first dragon... call upon it, and it will come._ The voice is carried along a gentle wind that blows toward the hidden chamber where Davron still rests, a wind that sighs softly with long memory and long regret, with wistful remembrance and solemnity. The breeze wavers, as though making ready to stay in an abode it once called home. Then it is gone entirely.

Chi-Yosh stares into the air, not a jumpy start, but more of a slow, careful gazing around at. He knows he will not find the speaker, but where the voice might be coming from? It certaionly... could be possible that there is a spirit of the castle? Or... he turns towards the place Davron has bunkered down into, and moves towards it, stepping fully inside. While the spirit may have spoken calmly outside, he does not wish to leave himself exposed - and perhaps wanting merely to be closer to Davron, in the same room. Safety in numbers. "Davron... There is a dragon outside."

Davron is leafing through a book of sorcery when Chi-Yosh returns. At Chi-Yosh's words, he carefully closes the book and turns to face him. "A dragon?" he whispers, his voice edged with worry... fear, even. "Where? Show me."

Chi-Yosh nods his head, and waits for the Twilight to follow him, before passing into the room that the disembodied words spoke. He gestures in the air. "Gaia is calling it home. The first dragon, it spoke but did not show itself; it said to call it." He looks over his shoulder at Davron. "Is it a spirit? Or a restless ghost?"

Davron blinks. "Gaia? The Blue Moon?" he murmurs in awe. "Now _that_ is wondrous strange..." He thinks for a moment. "I wonder why it spoke to you first... but then, you carry the blessing of Heavenly Aspect. Indeed, yes, perhaps that is what drew its attention. And... Malseyn was known as the Speaker to Dragons, for she forged this land's alliance with Syllum's spirits through her quest to speak with five elemental dragons." He nods, slowly, to himself. "And now here we come, in need of an audience with the spirits of Syllum ourselves. Perhaps the time has come to retrace Malseyn's steps."

After another glance at the laden shelves, Davron concludes that Malseyn's library is too large to remove in a single trip. He contents himself with carefully wrapping up three of the tomes - the ones he recognizes most readily - and stowing them in his pack. "We will return later, with the _Seagull_, to collect the rest," he says to Chi-Yosh. "For now, let us seal up this room once more."

Chi-Yosh shifts, nodding to Davron and, with his assistance, closes the door behind him. After a moment, he has to wonder if Davron can fly the Seagull. He certainly can't, but... he does recall Marina doing the same thing. Not to worry. And with that, they go.
