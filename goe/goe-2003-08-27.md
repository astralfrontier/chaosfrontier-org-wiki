An audience is not that difficult to gain with the Minister - any Minister - under the present circumstances. Beyond the official wishes of the King and council of Ministers to learn of Marina's success (or more likely, her failure), there is the subtle undercurrent of curiosity within the council as to the true intentions of this strange negotiator and her strange bodyguard. The soldiers from the "escort" must have already reported back. It is with these thoughts in mind that Marina walks through the open door into Minister Chirog's office.

It seems news of Marina's arrival has come ahead of her; Chirog is already standing, looking pale but composed. "Welcome back," he says, with a wan smile. "I see you have returned safely. I'm glad to see it." This much is true.

Smiling, Marina bows her head, stepping forward so that Chi-Yosh, too, may enter the office. Before she speaks, she considers the man carefully, trying to decide what way to broach the topic of promises made, and promises ... broken. "I have spoken with the barbarian, Chirog. The one that you, also, have spoken with. Much was made of your discussion with him, and much was made of the promises that were given." She stops, letting the words hang in the air.

"Had he much to say then?" inquires the Minister in a calm voice. "You know of the vows I have made, and you know the powers that enforce each one."

Shaking her head, Marina smiles thinly. "There is one vow, that he swears to, that I do not fully understand. It is the promise you gave him in exchange for the secret of the yurei." She looks up from beneath her lashes. "I do not know how that promise was to be enforced, or indeed how it could be made." She holds out her hands in supplication. "Will you not explain that promise?"

Chirog considers for several moments, his face a blank. The eyes, though, are stirring. "I promised him that, in exchange for the wisdom of the blossom's power, that I would speak to our Minister Kynbirg to see what could be done to further his claim. I learned of his plans to conquer, and at the time it seemed good to me that the barbarians gain a stable ruler." This much is true, for the most part - Chirog's veracity wavers at the last, but he speaks nothing he does not believe, at least.

Marina waits a moment more, to see what the eyes will see, and the face will reveal.

"Wulfham explained it to me, after I told him all that I'd learned in my travels. He said that the spirits of Korad keep the barbarians in check. Without the ability to lead a united war-party, they're easy to keep under control if they think of raiding us." Chirog paces uncomfortably. "I had no idea they were so savage, but the other Ministers retrieved the historical records." This much, Marina knows, is not necessarily true; Chirog's opinion of the Korad was probably never very good to begin with. The rest, though, has been honest.

Fascinated, Marina stands quietly, inviting comment.

Chi-Yosh stands behind Marina, quiet, stonefaced. Arms cross before him, one hand over the other wrist, and he watches Chirog. This man had slipped something private from the Korads, something sacred, and this Marina's bodyguard does not appreciate. So he went against his promise to Goran, or rather, discarded it, because of Wulfham's wish to contain the Korads. Chirog should have returned the _yurei_.

"Actually, Chirog, the spirits do not keep the barbarians in check. They keep the barbarians in **poverty**." Marina pauses a moment, waiting for that barb to sink in, before following it up. "The barbarians, as you call them, see the Syllum kingdom, and they begin to covet. For now, one leader covets your skills and your learning, and wishes to raise his people into this same renaissance." She raises one eyebrow. "For now. In time, he may well come to covet only your goods." She smiles very thinly, lips pressed together. "In a society where the people have no material goods, where all is devoted to the spirits, the one thing of value they hold is their honour. Their promises become sacred vows. And your promise to him, Chirog, was more encompassing in his understanding."

"Surely you learned of them?" Chirog asks, sounding just a little confused. "Those people... they're like animals. They'd mount raiding parties the day after the Spirit Tracks dissolved. You think we don't have enough problems here, woman? What with an army forming in Marita to attack the Hundred Kingdoms yet again, what with all this--" The old man raises his arms then, waving them around wildly for emphasis "-- this craziness! Syllum has remained free and independent. The Realm doesn't bother us. We give no offense to our neighbors. And you'd ask us to sacrifice our own soldiers in order that we might be attacked?"

"Yes, Chirog, I did." Marina nods. "You are, or Wulfham is, mistaken on several points." She pauses for a moment, obviously marshaling her thoughts, giving weight to the words that follow with her silence. "Now, you have a new problem on your border. The Spirits are angered by the loss of the yurei, and the promise that was broken. Now, you have two new problems; the Spirits that rage, and the barbarians that distrust you." She stops speaking for a moment, turning so that she can face both Chi-Yosh and Chirog. "We have traveled to see Goran. I have traveled, and spoken with the other tribes." She smiles for a moment, in memory. "Wulfham and Kynbirg mistaken; this alliance that Goran offered you offers strength, not weakness."

Before Chirog can interject, Marina moves forward, trying to convince him of her points. "The army forms in Marita, and threatens Syllum in time. The barbarians behind you ... **will** come to covet your goods and your wealth. But with just a little work, the barbarians vcan become your **allies**. All for the price of keeping your promise. A price that is already more than half paid by my honour, I might add." Her voice is definitely forceful, as she sounds ... intense. "My honour pays to ensure that you do indeed give no offense to your neighbours, even those with whom you have treated in less than perfect faith." Trying to calm down, Marina glares at the Minister.

"Think you so?" says Chirog, intimidated but rallying. "I have heard it reported that you conspired with this 'Goran'. Very well then. What do you wish for? Soldiers? They will not be sent to any people who have attacked us, unless the attack withdraws, I'm quite confident. However, since you have sworn... I suppose. Come." He walks round his desk, making for the door, glaring at Chi-Yosh as he passes. "Both of you, come."

Smiling, Marina follows, her hands hanging loosely by her side.

Chi-Yosh's brows raise. He has to wonder why Chirog is cross with him. Perhaps it is that Marina has made him yield, and the bodyguard is a suitable target for his wrinkled pride. The warrior shows no response, and merely follows Marina, not giving Chirog the satisfaction of a response.

Chirog leads the way to the topmost part of the citadel. Waiting there, in a high domed chamber, is Minister Wulfham, who appears to be deep in study of a collection of old books. Without even looking up he raises a single hand, signalling for patience. Finally he rises, greeting the arrivals cordially enough. "Marina, Wulfham.. well, my friend, perhaps you had better explain it to the young woman," says Chirog. Nodding, Wulfham speaks. "The rains will not stop. We cannot appease the spirits, except through victory. Malseyn's lore --" The books on the table, no doubt "-- are of little value, except for mention of the five dragons of the valley and the lands around it."

Marina steps forward, looking at both men. "There is a second way to appease the spirits."

Looking at the books, Marina shakes her head. "The dragons will not serve. Nor will soldiers, Chirog." She pauses. "Indulge me, if you will, in a moment of explanation?" Waiting the barest of moments for nods from the Ministers, Marina continues. "There are, in fact, two other options available to us. Or rather, to you. Both are closely related, and perhaps you can call them on option." She pauses, collecting her rambling thoughts. "There are two concerns here; one is spiritual and the other is military. But both stem from the same cause. Why were the spirits roused to attack? Honour is paramount to the people of Korad, and Chirog's honour is tarnished. Thus the spirits were enraged. These spirits gain power from Gaulderak, and it is Gaulderak's yoke that Goran seeks to throw off."

"You have need of mediators in the spirit world, and I can offer my services there. You have need of a political solution, and I can offer suggestions there, also." Marina looks at Wulfham. "These are two problems, and require two solutions, but the solutions are intertwined. Aid Goran in his quest to weaken Gaulderak, and the spirits will weaken. Bring peace back to the spirits, and Gaulderak will weaken." She looks back at Chirog. "Already, Goran is ready to believe that I, we, are the aid that you promised. He is not satisfied with the intensity of your aid, but at least he believes now that you have honour." She turns back to Wulfham. "Already, we have found a way to visit the spirits, who quarrel among themselves and seek a mediator to restore their equanimity." She looks at both men in turn. "Goran has offered much; his blood, his trade, and the his desire to learn. We have offered much; our blood, our honour, and our willingness to mediate. Now, Ministers, what does Syllum offer?"

Marina steps back, her shoulders slightly rounded, her head barely bowed, in a position that suggests, in the slightest of ways, that she is now submitting herself to the judgement of these ministers. It is time, now, to administer to _their_ vanity.

Both men look at each other, then back at Marina, then at each other. And they huddle, then, discussing something amongst themselves as quietly as they can. Long moments pass.

Marina waits quietly, after looking over her shoulder at Chi-Yosh. If this bolt fails, their task will become far more difficult.

Chi-Yosh seems to understand Marina's look, and mirrors it in his eyes, a concerned shadow passing over them.

Wulfham, now, seems to be taking the initiative in explaining something to Chirog, apparently at length. The Minister of medicine nods and nods as his colleague expounds on the details, and finally both break. Wulfham nods, looking satisfied, while Chirog looks distinctly uncomfortable. "Very well. It is self-evident that you have been true to the oath you took. We have no choice but to believe you. But let me also say this. Your boat is of far-eastern manufacture; the accents, too, of those with you when you thought yourself secure, are of the further eastern lands. You have demonstrated a knowledge of the spirits. We want no trouble with Greyfalls, or with the Realm, Marina. Tell your superiors this." He clasps his hands. "And with that out of the way, what is it you require of us?"

---

Seeing as the Syllum ministers are aware of the _Seagull_ there is no sense in hiding it away from the capital. While Davron is moving the boat to a more accessable spot, Chi-Yosh has led the other two solars up into the mountains. "... and when Davron and I went to the Keep," He informs, having mentioned the place of the Malysen Family's meeting place, "We stumbled upon a secret study, with books of hers, historical journals and ones containing sorcery." The pool of Heavenly Aspect of Water comes into view. "And then I heard a voice whisper to me, and... here we are."

"I see. It is... interesting that you should be the ones to find the secret study buried within the stones. And now you say Gaia called something back? When the Blue Moon is concerned..." Ramar's voice trails off then, as some unspoken thought is entertained in his mind. "There are other worries I have, as Gauss' messenger is almost certain to try to find a way to circumvent our aid... but I suppose that can wait as we are here now. It will be the next thing I do, however, when we finish here. We hope to find the four other Dragons? Or do we seek the council of the five of them? What if they have all been called hom by the Magic Moon?"

Chi-Yosh points towards the pool, as he draws forward. "I intend to ask about them, and what the first calling to me means. Who better to ask about a spirit of the area, then one of those spirits." He walks close to the edge of the pool, and waits pointedly for the womanly image therein.

"Indeed. I am anxious to see the spirit realm once more, though I am somewhat wary of this as well..." Ramar's voice is steady though. If he's terribly nervous, he's being rather calm about it. He joins Chi-Yosh by the side of the pool., waiting patiently on Heavenly Aspect, his senses idly shifting to catch sight of the world reflected within the pool.

Moments pass before the ripples of water herald the emergence of Heavenly Aspect of Water. She yawns softly and suppresses a stretch, though it's clear she has slept much like a mortal would. "You have returned," she says with a warm smile.

"I hope the return was not doubted," Chi-Yosh warms towards the watery gatekeeper. He settles into a crosslegged stance. "Greetings, Heavenly Aspect; we come seeking answers to questions that have been raised to us by the spirits of the vale. What can you tell us of the Five Dragons that Malysen spoke to?"

"As promised. Though I hope we did not disturb you in your rest, and that if we have, that we are a welcome intrusion." Ramar smiles a similar smile, legs folded gently beneath him. The Eclipse watches Heavenly Aspect's face curiously, pondering the faint traces of the slumber still lingering upon her features. A tired yawn here, a soft, heavy drooping of the eyes there... even as he reads her expression he pays attention. "If indeed such things can be spoke of," adds Ramar.

"The Speaker to Dragons wandered the valley in its early days," the spirit says, her voice a cool and refreshing mountain stream to the ears of those gathered. "She discovered the five dragons, who had slept, and sleep again, and she made peace with them. The temples and shrines which now ring the mountains and nestle in the valley were of her building. They were her warriors and protectors and advisors, against the spirits who thought to rule these lands themselves."

"And they still sleep within these hills somewhere?" Ramar's curiosity is piqued, though it had been for some time now. "What can you tell us of those who might live where Malesyn used to dwell... those whom might be called back by Gaia and speak of such things?"

Chi-Yosh nods a moment, and steeples his fingers. "Tell us what this may mean to you..." He sideglances as Ramar beats him to it. "I was approached by one of the five dragons, in the keep that was once Malysen. It spoke to me, and seemed eager to be talked to."

"Gaia is a mystery," says the spirit softly, doubtfully. "The dragons do sleep, though I know not where. They kept their own council, and ignore who they wish. If you seek them, Chi-Yosh, go back to the keep, and call for the dragon. I do not know its name; call who you know to be present, and it will come."

"Then perhaps the Dragon would know more than you might? If all we must do is call it, perhaps it will answer what questions we might have?" Ramar submits this question ponderously, while asking one of his own. "What does it mean when Gaia calls to a spirit? Or do you do not know and that is why you name it a mystery?"

"The dragons would know much that I do not," answers the goddess, in the affirmative. "If it woke for you, it will speak to you. As to Gaia.... I do not know. She is the mother of the 'lords of Creation', the Five Elemental Dragons. She does not speak to any other, nor does she show herself except far off in the sky."

Chi-Yosh nods to that, and gives a soft sigh. Not of frustration, but of... well, it's a sigh. The trip was ment for naught, but... a auint smile finds his features. "Thank ou, Heavenly Aspect. I hope we have not wasted your time. You seemed to have been stirred up by our presence."

The spirit smiles again. "You are never a waste of time," she says quietly, before dipping herself back into the pool.

The Solars gather together and, led by Chi-Yosh, make their way through the mountains. The trail is long, but not so arduous as it has been in the past, for feet are becoming accustomed to the uncertainties of the path. The Sun watches over them carefully from the west, lazily surveying all of Creation before he takes his sleep at the end of the world - several hours remain before darkness comes. Within they find Davron, hard at work deciphering the hidden lore of Malseyn.

As the Sun gazes down upon them from the West, a sad smile plays behind Ramar's eyes, and a respectful nod is given towards the Sun as it sinks down, lighting the waters that he knows are off somewhere in the distance. For a moment, it's almost as though the salted air is blowing past him, then his eyes open once more. Once inside the keep, fingers run curiously over ancient stone, while feet pad slowly along ground walked by few others. His eyes drift close and his mind opens, Essence streaming first from the cool caress of flesh upon stone, revealing to him the secrets it once held while his nose begins taking in the air, scented by the rain and cooled by the walls. The soft sound of his footsteps echoing down as he walks is enhanced, and he listens to learn what might lay ahead of them before once more opening his eyes, now ready to see what truly can be seen.

Davron raises his head from the book he is studying. "Welcome back, my friends," he says, carefully closing the tome. "I hope you have learned more than I have that will be of use today..."

Chi-Yosh nods towards Davron, leaning against the openned door of the study. "Good news. But I will leave that to Marina." A broad gesture toward Ramar's drifting off in search of ... well, he's Ramar, there is no telling what he's after. "Heavenly Aspect suggested that we merely should call the dragon, and if the dragon wishes, it will answer. And so we shall call, when we are ready." After a moment, "And after that, I will share what may need sharing."

"No one has been here recently, aside from those present now of course. A food offering has been left, and I would surmise that it's the Dragon. Have you thought of a way to call it?" Ramar's enhanced senses drift along the room, eagerly taking in the way the flow of Essence has pointed things out for him. "Or is it simply a matter of bowing one's head respectfully," which Ramar demonstrates, "And asking that the Dragon present here come make itself known that we might learn more of what it has to tell us?"

Davron rubs his chin. "The voice addressed Chi-Yosh... so I believe it is he who should call for the dragon." He nods to all of his companions. "The rest of us, I think, should remain alert... and, of course, on our best behavior," he adds, with a wry smile.

Chi-Yosh nods to Davron, and steps out of the Study's doorway, walking into the room he was spoken to in. He takes a deep breath, looking back towards the others, and waits. Now, here is to hoping this will work. "Here I am, in request of you, Dragon-who-has-spoken-to-me. Please, come forth, if you wish audiance."

**I am here, Chosen of the Sun. State your wish.** The voice is old and deep, vibrating through the very stone of the keep, almost from the mountain itself.

Blinking a moment, Chi-Yosh pauses. "I thought you were requesting to be spoken to, Dragon. Why did you call out to me?" He really hopes that he is not wasting this spirit's time.

**You came here with a purpose, a wish burning on your breast. It is clear as the Sun to me. Speak it,** the voice commands, patiently.

Ramar performs an elegant bow upon hearing the voice of the spirit, speaking from the stones. He then stands, silent, a rare occurrence indeed. An awe-struck look is on his face.

Davron takes a step forward and bows deeply and respectfully to the unseen presence. "We greet you, sir. And, as you clearly see, we _do_ have something on our minds. The spirits of this valley, and the spirits of the forest to the north, are locked in a quarrel, ignited by the disputes of the humans of these lands, but that we fear may continue long after the mortals have made their peace." He takes a deep breath. "We are here to seek peace once more - not only amongst the spirits of Syllum, but between that land and Korad as well."

The keep rumbles, noticeably, as the voice continues - perhaps a kind of laughter has just been heard. **Those rivalries... stay still, child.** From the very floor of the keep, the stone shapes itself into a claw, of monumental proportion, and the smallest talon of its smallest digit darts forward. It would spear Davron in the forehead if it had come even a centimeter closer. Into his mind there pours a wealth of knowledge: Malseyn herself, walking the land, bargaining with the spirits, hearing their secrets, offering them the worship of her people... The claw descends into the stone floor again. The keep is undisturbed. **Seek my brothers, if you need more strength.** And the voice is silent, the keep once again just a keep.

Chi-Yosh is concerned for his circlemate for a moment. It is reasonable, of course; when the stoney spikes of a great claw dart at one's head, it's likely a cause for alarm. But he can only imagine that Davron has the knowledge the spirit has offered him.

Ramar holds himself still, as he must. He watches the stone talon come to rest near Davron and then wonders at the sharing of knowledge. He simply stands, looking unsure of what must be done now. "If I might ask..." he speaks up now, addressing the presence he knows to be here... somewhere, "Where might we find your brothers?"

Davron remains frozen where he stood, transfixed by the strangely gentle touch of the dragon's claw, and even more by the torrent of information that has flooded his mind. "The oaths of the spirits..." he whispers quietly. Ramar's question, though, rouses him from his reverie. "That I can answer," he says, still in the same soft tone, "and far more besides." He puts a hand to his brow, blinking slowly.

Ramar turns towards Davron. "I suspect you might be able to. Share with us that which you can answer and that which we have not thought to ask yet." A spark of curiosity gleams in Ramar's eyes for a moment. "The more we learn, the more we can be prepared for the deeds that must be done."

Watching Davron carefully, Marina moves forward, ready to catch him if need be. She looks around at the others, shaking her head as she tries to suggest that now is not the time to pester the young archer with questions. Better to let him assimilate, and _then_ wring all the knowledge out of his unresisting carcass.

And so the four depart the keep. Davron leads the way, explaining as he goes to the insatiably curious Marina what he has learned. Spirits that swore to provide rain in the right seasons, and to permit the sun to pass at the right times, when the proper offerings were made; the restoration of certain truces between rival storm-spirits, via partial invocation of the dragons' names, knowledge which Davron now possesses as well. Ramar performs the rites at each temple, while Davron and Marina prepare themselves, and Chi-Yosh stands ready to ward off curious onlookers who might come from the villages.

---

"Let me get this straight," says Goran, scratching his head. He and Va sit outside, across the evening's fire, watching the Solars confusedly. "She's six years old? And you want me to marry this girl? How... how...." He stumbles for words. "How will she bear me children?"

"Well, Goran, it's not a matter of how, it's simply a question of waiting. You see, you would be betrothed to her now. It would be a symbol of the union between the two peoples... but uhm, you know, you don't have to take er... her to your... your er... ahem... uhm... ancestral bed, as it were." Ramar keeps his voice calm, and it's unclear whether he's holding back laughter or embarassment. A little of both, with no small degree of relief. "Unless you truly don't know how... I seem to remember someone saying something about the birds and bees once... though really it had nothing to do with either."

The giant shakes his head again. "But wait? For ..." He considers for a moment. "That's ten summers, before she's ready... and until then?" He waves his hands in front of him, as though batting away troublesome insects. "Or is this just one of those 'false' marriages I have heard about, where I keep a real wife around?"

"Well what would you do for ten summers anyway? It's not so long a wait where things are concerned... what is the phrase... absence makes the heart grow fonder? I'm sure it could be applied in this instance. Though I'm not certain on how the customs of your people are with regards to marriage." Ramar regards the large man now, "Which would you rather have done?"

Goran taps his fingers roughly on one muscled thigh. "I'd rather just be king," he says sullenly. "This sounds... complex. To marry a girl, to raise her to womanhood, THEN to bed her, while having been her husband all that time... We grow our own vegetables from seeds to eat, but this should be different!"

"Of course this gives both of you the chance to prove your faith and trustworthiness to one another," adds Ramar, lest he forget what Marina mentioned to him. That would be... unwise.

Davron shrugs helplessly. The concept of dynastic marriage is almost as new to him as it is to Goran. "I... I suppose that would be between you and her." He traces a finger on the ground, and glances at Marina for a moment. "To tell you the truth, I'm not entirely certain how these things work myself. I suppose you and she would talk with one another... and..." He sighs.

"Well, I will be spared all the talking to women of breeding. Yes, I've read about all those court ladies," he says confidently. "With their noble bearing and their arrogance.. I can see the advantages to this, in that I can train this woman not to speak badly to me in public.. she should scold me in private, as is proper. But to have such a young girl in command of my household? I don't think it can be done."

"Indeed. You know, I suppose you'd not have to worry about the gossiping of the noble ladies either you know. Such things are often more scathing than battle you know."

Chi-Yosh considers the matter, long and hard, watching the confusion and discomfort with merely a wry smile on his face. But there is more then mere amusement on the line; there is the matter of the uniting of the kingdoms. "Goran. This girl would be the heir to the kingdom of Syllum. She would not always be... here, with you. It may be a matter of her growing of age, or becoming queen, and then it is the two rulers of the neighbors, her Syllum and your Korad, that are married. You would share one another's kingdom, in essence. She may grow up with her people, learning how to be a queen, while coming to learn how to be the wife of Goran, King of the Korad, that the peace and understanding continue between all of you."

The tribesman sighs, finally. "Alright. ALRIGHT! You will no doubt tell me this marriage is the only way to twine the branches of our two trees together. So be it. I will marry this girl." He shifts on the ground, raising a finger for emphasis. "But! I want assurance. If I grow unhappy in my marriage, I will pick mates for each and every one of you. HA!" He slaps his thigh ringingly, grinning. "Yes. This I vow!" And that, it seems, is that.

Davron stares at Goran for a moment, slack-jawed. Then a blush blooms on his cheeks, but the corners of his mouth draw back into a grin, and he begins to laugh, chuckling at first, then in peals of good-natured laughter. "You do drive a hard bargain, Goran!" He gasps for breath, and glances at his comrades. "What do you think, friends? It sounds fair enough," he says, still grinning.

Chi-Yosh can merely raise his brow at that. He rubs his chin, regarding the barbaran. "It would be a matter of catching us, Goran, king of the Korads." And after a moment, "And be cautious with your statement of unhappiness. Do not set our marital lives in stone, merely because someone does not sweep the room when asked." Eyes shine in amusement.

Marina shrugs, smiling at Goran. "As long as you do not marry me to one such as Ramar ... I prefer a quiet mate; one who retreats into silence as he sorts out his confusions ..."
