The Sun has not yet shown his face over the world, the morning of the voyage north, towards the forests and whatever fate lies concealed within them. The _Seagull_ floats at its mooring, being tended to by Ramar. Gallius has been called down by the Master, who came personally to oversee the preparations of the vessel. Now he stands, hands clasped behind his back, motionless, observing the bobbing prow of the vessel from the edge of the dock.

Gallius comes when called, eager to hear just what her enigmatic mentor has to say. She will come to the Master and say, "Did you have need of me? I hope you have not changed your mind.. I think they might need me, after all."

Ramar tends to the vessel with no small degree of devotion. Even as he finishes the last bit of preparation, he is talking to the vessel, soothing it. "Yeah yeah... that'll do it." He looks up, nodding to the Master and Gallius, regarding the two of them curiously. "Well, she's ready Master, though I still dunno where we're going or what we're doing. Should I ask why, or would you rather I found out as we go?"

The man does not turn upon Gallius' approach, although his head inclines just a bit, a subtle nod of greeting and assent. His handclasp breaks; one holds open his merchant's cloak, while the other reaches into the depths of it and withdraws a loosely-bound sheaf of papers, a package such as a diplomat's aide or minor bureaucrat might carry his work in. He presents it to his back, trusting the woman to take it. "You are going north, with Chi-Yosh," he says. "Specifics are your business."

"Ah right... right, that is today. I'm sorry, my mind's still focused on the ship." Ramar shakes his head, as if refocusing his thoughts. He nods to The Master, "Indeed, indeed. Specifics are our business, though I suspect you probably know most of them. So uhm, what's in the package?"

"That is for Gallius to reveal," is the Master's curt reply.

Gallius nods, taking the package of papers. She inspects it for a moment, trying to discern just what it is she has. "I will do all I can to see that we all return in one piece," she answers. She would ask about the package, but is beginning to understand that she has to understand her way through things on her own if she is ever to gain this man's respect, a goal that somehow is now very dear to her.

Upon closer inspection, spidery writing can be made out beneath the foreign script of the title itself - a translation, of sorts. "Correspondence of Kirchin with the Celestial Hierarchy", it reads. The first sheet of paper is dry and wrinkly, but its contents can clearly be made out. It consists of the sort of prayers a very small child would make to the gods and spirits. The page is dated, and so are the next few pages that Gallius flips slowly through.

Gallius reads that first page, then cradles the gift closer, as if afraid she might lose it. "When I have read more of this, Ramar, I will tell you of them, I think." She looks at the Master closely, trying to read the man, which is quite hopeless. "If you have need of us, will you be able to reach us while we are away?" she finally asks.

"There will be no need," says the Master calmly, as certain of the fact as any other man might be that the Sun will rise and set in its due course. "You will find those of use in the coming weeks. Keep them with care," he adds.

"Ah. Well that's up to you, really." Ramar turns to the Master, "I hope we see you soon. Is there anything else we should do while we're out? Ah... I see. Thank you."

The Master attends to Ramar with his usual murky stare. "Expect trouble," he says softly.

Gallius nods to the Master, "I will read them and memorize them," she says. The Lady smiles, adding, "Thank you. When we return, we will bring good news. And I will have questions, for there is no quick explanation to these things. I am learning a lot of what I am, but the long years lie ahead, and I still feel as if I'm just learning to walk again."

"Both of you," says the Master, nodding to Ramar inclusively, "have much to learn. And much to do. It will come quickly, but not easily."

Ramar gives a soft sigh, turning his head to look off in the distance. When he turns back he still has that faraway look in his eyes. "Indeed. Trouble... it does seem to follow us around... well, that's life for the time being I suppose. Still..." He nods to Gallius, "I believe we all have, and still are. There is much to learn. But that's why..." He turns to the Master, "I only hope that when it does come, we have the wisdom and strength of mind and body to bear it."

"Strength you were given. Wisdom is your affair," the older man observes, almost smiling now. He turns, to look at Gallius, eyes glancing down for a moment, indicating the paperwork. He almost speaks, but holds back, as he studies the Roleyn woman's eyes for a moment. His face quirks: 'Perhaps no more needs to be said' is his thought, but he once again observes the preparations on the harbor with patient confidence.

"We will have the wisdom and strength we need, or we will not," says Gallius. "What will be, will be. We were chosen because we have the mandate of the sun. It is time to see if we are worthy. I believe that if we hold to what we are, we will survive until we have done what we are meant to do." The Lady turns to stare off towards the forest, league upon league away, "If we are meant to fall on the way, it will happen. That is not for us to decide, but for the one who chose us."

"We've already proved ourselves worthy of what is to come, the trick is to survive it. I must disagree though, with your interpretations of things Gallius." He nods then, and bows his head. "I do not believe that the future has already been written, nor set in stone. Nor do I believe that we are meant to do any one thing... I believe that our fate is our own choosing, and it is we who will become what we will become, and because of that, we have been given our gifts..." Ramar reddens. "Although, well, nevermind." The usually talkative fellow shuts up, for once.

The Master simply stares at Ramar for a few moments. "You have accurately described Destiny," the man says, sounding just a little surprised.

Gallius laughs softly, "What will be, will be. Whether it is by pre-destination or the acts of the living is of little consequence to those living through it. We will each play our part to the best of our abilities." She considers the writings and smiles, "And some of us have more than a few reasons to strive to be all they can."

Ramar opens his mouth as though he were going to say something, but thinks better of it for the moment. He nods to the Master, pondering. "I uhm, am not quite sure what to say now, actually."

The man actually smiles now, as he explains. "Destiny is written. But your hearts are the pens. Gallius is fated to become a great war-leader. Because that is her nature, not because any one god has declared that thus it will be. Were Gallius a different woman, she would not be fated for that. Likewise, Ramar, you will be a traveler of note, witnessing Creation's glory, because that is your nature. Heaven records that which will be by weaving forward on the great Pattern, but the loom must obey the thread it weaves with."

"The greatest of war leaders are those who build armies that never need draw blood," murmurs Gallius. "I will do my part, though. If my role were different, it would matter little. I must do what I can for Roleyn, indeed perhaps for everyone. The fate of many seems to be swinging already in the balance, and yet.. I have a feeling the greatest struggle has not even begun."

The Master nods. "There are perhaps two years left before the Deliberative must make its decision on the successor to the Scarlet Throne. When that happens, the Realm will go to war. When that happens, the world will follow."

"Or it already has." Ramar turns to the Master, listening. As he listens there is a smile on his face. "Indeed, indeed. That is almost precisely what I was taugh.." He falls silent, listening again. When Gallius and The Master speak of war... however, "War threatens to consume the world... perhaps we shall have to find some way of halting it. I am unsure of the best way to do so, though perhaps learning what happened to the Empress may be one means of doing so. Too much blood has been shed in the name of power... far too much."

"So it is the great hope of our kind that will bring chaos to the world," murmurs Gallius. "I have seen battles, I know well what it means. Thousands will die, then even more shall starve. It cannot be stopped utterly, but perhaps we can create a safe-haven to stand against the world, like an island of stone. I am not strong enough yet. None of us are. When I return I will seek the King and offer my aid to him in a few matters, and try to forge a friendship. So many things to do.."

The Master nods softly. "If any will survive these times, they will be led by you, the chosen of the Sun."

"And so little time in which to do it... that is how the saying goes." Ramr shakes his head slowly. "It is unfortunate that such things should happen, though perhaps in the coming years we will have a greater role to play." With a glance skyward, and his hands cupped together and held out as if to hold the Sun itself... "It truly does seem at times as though the fate of the world rests in our hands."

"Those times simply mean you are paying attention," smirks the Master, breaking the mask of solemnity to smirk a little.

"What we do now will decide how prepared we are to handle what the future shall bring," says Gallius. "It is the idle times that irk me most. The world is speeding by, and I feel as if I'm barely moving. Soon we'll be back on the board. I hope this trip will at least teach me a thing or two of these Lunars."

The Master makes a light gesture, indicating Gallius' new collection of paperwork. "Do not sit idle then. Perhaps Ramar would like to hear, as well."

Ramar nods, "I would indeed. Though I'm told I talk alot... I rather enjoy getting the chance to listen. And to learn. It helps to satisfy the thirst for new knowledge, you know." He looks towards the paperwork, then to the Master and Gallius. "I am... all ears, as they say."

Gallius turns away from the Master after offering a slight bow and moves closer to Ramar. "These are the words of my sister. I think it's every one of Kirri's prayers." Her smile is warm, but sad, "It's as if I were there with her again, in a way."

"Perhaps in a way, it is as though she is here with you?" Ramar offers, gesturing towards the packet. "But... for what reason would these prayers be recorded and assembled in a package?"

"I do not know how," murmurs Gallius, "but the Master says they will be useful. I will have to read them carefully. My sister's words lead me to finding my weapon, I think her spirit is going to be with me forever. This is a comfort, though. I miss her, and this somehow eases my feeling of loss. I will keep these close, and perhaps I will show them to my father one day."

"The Celestial Bureaucracy is not called what it is, Ramar, simply to hold a fancy title for Immaculate monks to impress peasants with," says the Master, evenly.

"I suppose we must all watch what we pray for, in that case," murmurs Gallius. She sits herself down and gets herself ready to read what was given to her. "I hope to have these all firmly stored in my mind by the time we arrive," she murmurs.

"This is true. Although I admit I do not know the inner workings of the Celestial Bureaucracy just yet..." Ramar looks to the Master, "I wonder if you could teach me more baout the courts of the spirits and their dealings?" To Gallius, he smiles, "Indeed. They will be, no doubt. I have to wonder though... well..." He shrugs.

"I can, when you return," the Master answers Ramar. "There will be time enough. And should you die now, well, such knowledge would be of no use to you anyway." Not even a flicker of a smile passes his lips as he speaks.

Ramar nods evenly. "Then, I shall look forward to learning more when I return, and I will do the absolute best I can to not die."

Now the Master does smile, and he inclines his head respectfully to the sailor. "I have every confidence that your effort will be rewarded."

Gallius muses over the prayers, her eyes glinting for a moment. Whatever she's found, it's got her full attention. For now, she's forgotten those around her, utterly lost in thought.

Ramar returns the smile. "In one way or another, it will be. I look forward to it, as I've said, though I get the feeling it will not at all be what I expect. Life has a funny way of twisting in surprising manners at times." He then turns, as though he were going to say something to Gallius, but lets her revel in her thoughts. He asks the Master, "After I have learned about the Celestial Bureaucracy, will you teach me about the wonders and workings of the first age as well?"

"All that I know will be for you five," answers the Master calmly, "if you have the wisdom to ask the right questions."

"Indeed. Then thank you, master. Such a gift is priceless." Ramar then ponders Gallius curiously, watching her as she drifts through her thoughts. _Whatever it is that fascinates her must be important. To her, at least, if no one else._ "Is everything alright Gallius? You seemed lost for a moment there..."

Gallius finally rouses herself and gives the Master a strange look. "Have you read these?" she asks softly. Her voice betrays a bit of nervousness. Some of these perhaps get a bit too personal?

"I translated the cover, as it was given to me. I have not looked inside," says the Master calmly enough, eyes level with Gallius' own.

"It's a bit strange," replies Gallius. The words of the master seem to relieve her, and she lets out a sigh. "In any case, some of these I think are best kept for my eyes, you do not need to hear of my sister's designs on how I should best maintain the integrity of Roleyn's Royal line."

"Er... designs on how you should best maintain the integrity of Roleyn's Royal Line...?" Ramar does his best to hide the smile that threatens to creep onto his face. "I see. It must be interesting to know such things, and yet somewhat comforting. Not many have this sort of chance, you know."

Gallius can't help but blush a bit, "It is quite nice. It's quite special, really. She cared for me dearly. I would give the world to have her back here." She returns her attention to the notes, "Some of these I feel will be of great use to us, but I have to understand my way through them, first."

"Ah indeed. Interpreting them may be difficult, though I should point out, if you wish to, there are those of us who would be willing to help interpret them. If no one else, there are four of us. Although, again... these are likely private thoughts to be kept to yourself..." Ramar shrugs. He turns back to the _Seagull_ a moment, pondering the vessel. He asks, "On an unrelated note, have you been to the Eastern Forests before?"

"I have not," answers Gallius. "I spent most of my life in Roleyn, and though I did some travelling, it was not very far." She lets out a sigh, "This is farther from home than I've ever been, I think. It seems like another age that I last stood in Roleyn."

"It is. Although by another way of looking at things it isn't all that long a time really." Ramar ponders. "What are the lands around Roleyn like? I must confess to not knowing it's layout or much of the lands the king claims as his own. I ask because I am wondering if I ought to warn you of some of the dangers of the forest. Or things to watch out for..."

"Roleyn is a place of rolling hills and plains," answers Gallius. "I have been in small wooded areas, but I do not think you'd call them real forests." The Lady looks at the sky for a moment, "What is there I should know?"

"Well for one which plants should be avoided, which are toxic and the like, you should know the types of inhabitants you're likely to meet and how to find water or shelter just in case... but this is hardly a comprehensive list," explains Ramar. "Still, I can point out a few things, and teach you a little more if you'd like."

"We hopefully will have time along the way," says Gallius. "I can't learn it all at once, after all." She grins widely, "I'm going to also hope that we don't get separated. That would be quite the mess in a dense wood."

Ramar nods, "If you get separated the best thing to do is remains as close to where you can be as is possible. Although since we're to be tested, being separated might be a huge part of what is to come. I can't say for certain. Still... I'm sure you know how to find water, coming from a grasslands area... the basic theory is the same, though different in a few areas..."

She nods quickly, "I know where to find water. And a few things besides." Gallius smiles and explains, "I know how to set snares and hunt small game if there is a need, and I have luck with picking berries, provided there are birds to watch."

"Ah, this is good then. There are only a few extra things you need to worry about when surviving in the woods. It's not terribly difficult, poisons and creatures being the things to worry most about. And... the Lunars of course." Ramar adds, "They are there as well, after all."

"They are, but.." Gallius smiles, looking at the pages thoughtfully. "But maybe I am going about them all wrong, my friend. We will see." The Lady turns herself back to reading. "I think I am going to focus on these for a time. When I find out something I will let you know. And I will have to hear more of these woods on the way." But for now, Gallius is going to focus herself on the first task.
