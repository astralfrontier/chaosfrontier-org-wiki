The sounds of the forest are legion, now that everything seems to have calmed down. The wind blows softly through the trees, and the innumerable animals and plants that make the verdant wilderness their home can be heard, calling or rustling or crawling about. Non Valon has promised to return in the morning, to act as guide; for now, the Solars are on their own.

The night is still rather young when Gallius' sleep is broken with a nightmare or vision that wakes her up. She sits up swiftly and gasps for breath, shivering against a cold that she felt lifetimes ago. She scrambles to her feet, moving to put her back against a nearby tree, her spear drawn up and held ready.

"Are you alright," calls Ramar's voice from the tree Gallius has taken to putting her back to. He is speaking as soft as a whisper in the breeze. "Is there something nearby we should be worried about?" Ramar has climbed up to the higher branches to keep an eye on the hidden camp.

Lady Gallius does not respond for a time, her eyes staring into the darkness. Still she shivers, her lips moving before she seemingly snaps out of it. "Wha.. why is this in my hand?" she murmurs, looking at her spear. She looks to her hip and then pauses. Her voice is soft as she states, "I am Gallius. Gallius of Roleyn."

"Er... yes, you are..." Ramar looks around. "Are you alright? Gallius?" He drops down through the branches, effortlessly almost. "Gallius? To whom are you speaking?" As he stands on the ground, he throws something towards Chi-Yosh, aiming to wake the slumbering Solar from his sleep.

The rocks rolls in the air towards Chi-Yosh's spot, before it's caught out of the air. He sits upwards, tossing the stone to the side. "Are you well," he inquires towards the fellow Solar, looking intently at her in the shadows, hidden between the cagebars of moonlight.

Gallius drops her spear, sinking slowly to her knees. "I.. I don't know. I just had a dream.. or was it a memory?" The Lady looks down at the ground, staring into her minds muddled set of memories. "I saw another time and place. I was.. someone else. I was running in a great wood, not quite like this, but dark. I don't know what I was running from, but I knew that I had to get away."

Ramar picks up Gallius' Spear, resting it on the tree beside her, though he keeps hold of it. _Lest the Lunars steal THIS as well..._ "Another time and place? I... I see. Well I am quite sure that you are yourself, Gallius. Your dream has passed. Nothing more than a faded ghost of a memory. With any luck."

Chi-Yosh merely nods to Gallius, and shakes the remnants of sleep from him. He knows he'll need his rest for the coming days but... Looking back at the woman, there is more at hand then selfish issues. "I have seen them too," He returns just as quiet. "Great, horrible, I've seen them."

"Are they.. can they be real?" murmurs Gallius. "It can't be. Not with him." She shudders and shakes her head, trying to clear it, perhaps. "I wasn't alone. He was with me. My husband was, I mean. We were dressed strangely, and somehow it feels like it was a very long time ago."

"Such things... I would be unsure of trusting here in this place," cautions Ramar. "And they are dangerous to begin with, if you're not careful." Ramar is speaking soft and soothingly, though there's caution evident in his voice. "The Lunars can influence dreams, but it may be something different. I would not be troubled by it..."

The lady nods slightly, "But why would he send such a dream?" she murmurs. "I dreamt.." She swallows roughly, "I dreamt I was Ma-Ha-Suchi's." She frowns deeply, shaking it off. "I was his wife."

Chi-Yosh looks off into the darkness. He doubts that the jaguar would be tampering with the dreams of his fellows. He has what he wants, why tamper with them now? Gallius's spark is rekindling an imprint of long ago. Perhaps this is her first? It was not immediate for he either. Though, her words... the horror is hidden in the murk, but it is on his face, none the less.

"Yet you are not now. You are not who you once were..." explains Ramar, "Though you can be, if you are not careful. It could be... a memory from an incarnation before. Again, you're not his wife now. I would not be afraid." Ramar shrugs, "At least not at present. It is simply a matter of realizing and becoming who you are, not who you were. If I am making any sense, though, it is a cold day in the South."

Gallius nods slowly, "I.. I am not his wife now." She can't help but frown in worry, though. "He tried to kill me twice, now. The first was when I changed." The lady reaches to take her spear, "I think I have to rest a bit. Not sleep! Not yet. I don't want to run in distant dreams."

Chi-Yosh smiles almost ruefully at Ramar's words. Sometimes saying the right thing is a matter of saying much, and getting practice at it. For a moment, he is tempted to cross the camp, to lay a comforting hand on the woman, but that is not needed now. "You are given the chance to erase the mistake that is Ma-Ha-Suchi. We will make it so."

"Indeed. If you'd like, there are meditations that can be done to clear the mind, which may make for a more restful night. If nothing else, someone here is likely able to ward off Nightmares and Dreams." Ramar speaks softly, voice never rising more than is necessary to be heard by the two Solars nearby. He ponders Chi-Yosh, giving the fellow a smile. "I believe we can take up the watch, if it's necessary. And yes... the chance may come. If indeed it is necessary."

"I don't think so," murmurs Gallius. "We were paired then, maybe there is some mistake?" She sighs deeply, "Why would he kill so many good people? Once it was not that way. We were.." She struggles to find a word, but finally shrugs and gives up. "We were necessary to each other, I guess."

Chi-Yosh simply nods to Ramar, and rises up, strapping to him the belt that holds his kamas. He crosses to a tree on the other side of the camp, and says nothing. He does not know what to say to Gallius, and doesn't try. There is nothing that can be said to comfort such a turn of fate.

"At some point, perhaps. It is not ours to know just yet... though such things can be divined, if you truly wish to know." Ramar then asks, "Do you feel you are necessary to one another now?" He stands, and offers Gallius' spear back to her, if she so desires. "You dropped this."

Gallius takes the spear back, nodding to Ramar. "Thank you.. and I do not know if we are or not. I've only been near him twice, and both times I was fighting to save my life." She lets out a sigh, "Can I really kill him now? Can I even let that happen, knowing that we were once together."

"If you really wish to, then yes. It is not a matter of being able to, it is a matter of wanting to. And you were not once together. It was someone else." Ramar explains, adding, "Do not forget that either. These are things from before you even existed. Do not let yourself be ruled by them... though I would be foolish to advise you to ignore them completely."

"I will have to figure out what all this means," says Gallius. "I have to know why he changed. I want to know why my people had to die." She narrows her eyes, "And if it fails to satisfy justice, I want to kill the brigand."

Chi-Yosh looks back from the forest, sending his words to the other Solars. "You are a pair of hands. The Exaltation in you, the gift of the Unconquered Sun, it has passed into your hands from the one before you, and to them from before. These were all individuals, all who had different feelings. Your connection is the Exalted soul inside. Those before you had thoughts and motivations that are not yours, guilt that cannot be saddled on your shoulders. Do not let it be. What once another's choice is not ment to be yours, and should not be blamed as such."

"If you must. I would ask though if you can bring life to those who have died unjustly?" Ramar lets the thought trail off. He ponders, "And Chi-Yosh..." there's a soft chuckle, "I'm surprised at you. You're talking almost as much as me... what would Marina say?" The grin in his voice is unmistakeable, though he adds, "Though perhaps your words have actual wisdom to them. You should heed them Gallius... lest you be trapped by this."

"I fear the trap is sprung, and until I get my answers, it is a snare that I cannot deny," replies Gallius. "What I need to know cannot be found here, but my mind is different now. Things are not so easy as I had thought. If we were once close, Solars and Lunars, then we might be again."

Chi-Yosh can only smile weakly at Ramar, but the warmth is sapped by the weight of Gallius's own confusion and misfortune. So his eyes turn to the night, and what it might bring.

"We may well be, but there is no trap here Gallius. Unless you let yourself be snared by it. After all... you have no reason to see the Lunar in Question again unless you truly wish to know more. Remember Chi-Yosh's words well though... any connection from the past, in your mind might be from your own reasoning... but you are not that person, that being." Ramar shrugs, "Though arguing throughout the night may prove fruitless."

Gallius nods quickly to Ramar. "Let's get some rest, then. I think I will need some time to sleep, but maybe I can." She studies the camp, "This is well-made," she murmurs, seeming a bit confused. "Apparently I remembered more. I need to rest and not think, though. My mind is moving too fast."

Ramar nods. "Then meditate. As I said earlier... I do know several methods of clearing the mind, or relaxing one's thoughts if you'd like to know them." He shrugs, and then nods, "The camp should be well made. I constructed it, after all." There's a smirk on his face, and Ramar motions to Gallius, so that she might return to a mroe restful state.

Gallius lies back down to rest, though she does not shut her eyes. For now, the lady has to rest her mind, and then maybe sleep can follow. "I don't think I could learn now," she says to Ramar. "I just need to rest a bit."

Dawn comes, and with it, Valon himself. The enormous ape-man is dressed as before, wearing his knives and his tattered raiments. "To north," he says, casually enough, then begins ambling through the woods at a slow pace. The party gathers itself up and begins following him.

Gallius rises, giving no indication at all of the night before. She follows Valon, leaving a little space, but not so much that he might manage to easily bolt ahead of her.

"Of course. Good morning Valon." Ramar bows his head respectfully. He spends a moment to clear away signs of their campground, and gathers his things. He nods to Valon, "Lead the way... we shall follow you." He follows after Valon, ambling through the woods slowly, carefully, glancing around, senses sharp in an attempt to be ready for any sort of danger that might crop up.

Chi-Yosh recieved enough rest, and now is fresh and ready to begin the day. Following close behind Valon, he can't help but concern himself that this is a bad idea. That letting Valon take them to the sorcerer, to deal with him, is a violation of the tests. But then it could be a part... he doesn't know. It just feels somewhat wrong. On the other hand, the jaguar likely knows what to expect; not having spies watching them would be sloppy, and the warrior does not suspect the sorcerer to be sloppy.

A few hours pass without incident; the forest is dense, but Valon knows the proper paths to take and Marina and Davron understand the rites by which the spirits of the woodlands can be pacified, or at least bypassed. A few wood-elementals trail behind the party for perhaps thirty minutes, eyes of amber gleaming in the half-shadows and wooded feet clacking gently as they cross branches and stones, but no further trouble comes of the matter. Eventually the group reaches a wide river, pouring powerfully to the West, and Valon indicates a crude raft and a rope that spans the raging waters. The raft seems lashed to the rope, and riders would need to haul themselves across by main strength. "Cross here," the ape-man explains.

Gallius is familiar with rivers. Some rivers. She's seen them. The kind that can be forded on horseback. She has not, however, seen a river quite like this. "We're going to cross on that?" she murmurs, giving the raft a dubious look.

"Half day other way," replies Valon, himself sounding more than dubious. "Into Cat lands. Safer from west."

Chi-Yosh is the first on the raft. He is the strongest among them, and atleast has to steady it for the others. Placing his kamas in their proper resting place, the Su'Katan kneels on the raft carefully, one hand gripping the rope, and inches onto it, swaying a little beneath the moving water. He scoots forwards ever so carefully while inching hands across the rope.

"Here? I'm not sure... something seems..." Ramar shrugs, dismissing it as nothing more than simple paranoia. "Well it might be a tight fit... depending, however..." He nods to Valon, climbing on the raft. He takes hold of the rope as well, holding it steady so that others might climb aboard without terrible difficulty. "Come on. All aboard. Anchors away and so forth."

Gallius looks none too kindly at the raft. "I suppose we have no choice, then," she murmurs. The lady steps onto the raft, holding her spear to balance herself. "I hope this piece of junk holds together. Everyone should be ready to grab the rope and pull themselves to land.. just in case."

Carefully everyone boards the wooden raft; Valon is last on, and his prodigious weight makes the wet wood beneath his feet creak and groan in protest. Nevertheless the craft remains intact, and together the strongest of the party, Valon included, begin to slowly tug at the rope, fighting the torrents of water in their effort to draw the craft across to the other side. Once clear of the treeline, something to the immediate west can be noted - a waterfall, and apparently a high one, if the perspective of the lands beyond its edge is any indication. Something splashes in the water, upstream, and Ramar is the first and only to notice. The creature is huge, but not quite as enormous; it is a man, or something like a man, with a leering smirk of victory and great rending claws. They shear effortlessly through the rope on the south side of the raft, where the party had come from. The raft tilts and jerks wildly, and the northern end of the rope snaps, sending the little craft and all its passengers care

.... all its passengers careening toward the waterfall beyond.

The raft careens wildly toward the edge of the waterfall, a bucking bronco that will not be tamed by any of the shouts of its suddenly alert occupants. The spray of the river as it transforms into waterfall rises up, thrust into the air by rocks and dampens suddenly sweaty faces. In each heart there is fear, but there is something more. The awareness of danger, and the enduring unwillingness to bow down in the face of any adversity. Upriver by only inches, the draconic outlines of the raft's assailant dives beneath the surface, lending its own immense weight to the burden of the raft. Stomachs leap toward throats as the raft begins sailing, not upon water, but out into open air...

Chi-Yosh finds himself airborn, and has no time to think. Thus there is a mere matter of act, instinct born from the situation. A look downwards before he simply rolls off the raft, slicing into the falling wash towards a rock. He spreads out, not intending to bounce on the stone, nor does he wish to break something. The stone is wet, and without thinking, as boots strike the surface, essence blossoms out like a colorful mirror of the waterfall. His stance is steady, as his gaze tracks first his companions, then immediately looks upwards for their adversary.

Davron takes scant seconds to pull a rope from his pack and tie it around the base of an arrow, just above the feathers. Drawing back the string of his glowing bow, he launches the shaft just above a narrow outcrop jutting out of the rock. The arrow clears the stone spire by a fraction of an inch, and travels several more yards before the trailing rope catches on the rock - the momentum of the arrow so great that the heavy arrowhead whirls down, then up again, faster and faster until it smacks into a tiny crevice in the stone - leaving the rope anchored in half a dozen loops around the rock. Davron catches the free end of the rope and swings out into the abyss...

Gallius braces herself just before she finds the raft is no longer resting on anything but the all-too-thin air. She looks down towards the swiftly-approaching out-croppings and holds her naginata blade downward, hoping to gain some extra traction when she lands, her mind already planning to swing out the blunt of her spear towards any allies who might need a hold.

The ground drops out from beneath Ramar. Or rather he is sent careening high above it. He wastes no time, each foot echoing lighter and lighter against the raft as he runs along the airborne raft, racing to reach the edge. With one graceful, fluid movement pushes himself off of the edge of the raft. With one hand flying to remove his sword from his sheath, the other is held off to one side. He brings himself almost to a swan position, then swings his sword about at the last second as he heads for the waterfall. The sound of steel carving a long path through stone can be heard as the Solar disappears into the misty wall of water that falls off of the almost sheer cliff.

Valon leaps off the raft, tackling Marina along the way, who was clearly making no useful move to leave the vessel herself. The two disappear into the mist of the waterfall, and their fate is uncertain.

The beast is the last to follow, and it leaps confidently from the top of the waterfall, tucking itself into a ball and dropping with measured precision onto one of the ledges. It lands and unfurls its entire ten-foot size, even as it balances on the rocky outcropping that juts from the fast-flowing waterfall. "FOOLS!" a voice booms, and from the creature itself. It turns to look at each of the surviving party members, and each of them look back at what is more than a beast-man, truly. A giant, its body is shockingly humanoid, despite being covered in scales and rough outcroppings of chitin. Its hands are claws, the grasping and rending talons of a river-dragon. Its face is that of a sneering man, but behind it, scales stretch out where hair would be. A tail lashes its way through the briskly falling waters.

Swinging about to face her enemy, Gallius raises her spear and as she does, essence spills from her in waves, bringing a thrill of confidence to all those who stand with her. Her grey eyes lock on the twisted beast just above her and she answers it, "Fly, worm, or death shall find you this day."

Gallius' display incites a brief pause, but still the creature speaks. "You trespass on my master's lands bravely!" calls the creature proudly and defiantly. "And for my honor, and in the name of Weeping Prowler, you will not pass!" His arms widen, and he crouches on the narrow ledge, in a classic brawler's stance.

Chi-Yosh stares down at the monster, and he can only set his teeth. This can be nothing more then the work of the sorcerer. So be it. His friends are in danger, danger caused by this monstrosity. A glance over its head to Gallius. He will win, feeling a rush of assurance flood his system. So be it. Essence, like a coiled spring, churns around the Dawn as he dives downward. The motes trickle from his launched form, sending iridescent sparks through the waterfall. Frame condensed into a ball, turning tight circles in the air before he is nearly upon the creature. That wound spring of power lashes forward like a bright star and his entire body snaps straight at the last moment, sending a crack through the air as feet connect.

Davron wastes no time with words, instead spending the precious seconds while the monster calls out its challenge to secure the rope around his waist. As he swings back and forth from his ledge, he reaches into his quiver, feeling among the coded shafts and selecting one. The arrow he removes lacks the broad head of his usual arrow, instead coming to a narrow point. Thus prepared, he waits for the perfect moment to strike...

Essence joins Essence as an aura of power surrounds the creature, and as Chi-Yosh launches his attacks, one massive and scaled arm swings in a blur to intercept him. It lands squarely in his gut, hurling him back toward his ledge.

Gallius leaps towards the ledge the enemy stands upon, and swings her naginata, suffusing it with essence for as powerful a strike as she can muster. If all goes well, she will land on the ledge about even to where she started and have her weapon pointed up, waiting for her enemy to fall upon it.

Feeling her blade chop through the ledge, Gallius has no time to try and gauge the effect. Her mind must focus on landing and bringing her weapon to bear, should she succeed.

The party's nemesis wobbles on his suddenly-unsteady perch, and as the stone shatters he plummets directly toward Ramar, below, who is still trying to figure out just how to approach the problem, which is now rapidly approaching him! Along the way, Gallius' outstretched naginata manages to catch the creature.

On his way down the beast-thing manages to flip himself around, catching only a glancing dent from the polearm, and prepares himself for a very rough landing below.

Chi-Yosh has a struggle reclaiming his ledge, but thankfully earns a grip upon it and slides up. He draws to his feet, and regards the creature. A simple nod. He just sets himself and leaps from the ledge, into the waterfall. Feet touch the stone behind the waterfall, and as he runs downward, the ledge he seeks to jump to is thusly destroyed. Having to act fast, the Su'Katan leaps to the side, upon the slanted ledge Gallius herself finds footing on. Still behind the waterfall, momentum too fast to simply stop at the rock, leaps from it just as feet touch down. The jump sends him through the waterfall to dive down ontop of the monster. Arms are crossed, and as he gets close enough, they lash out in pincering dual slash. Growing close to the ledge, he kicks off the beast, back striking the stone behind the falls as he nearly cracks onto the ledge.

The shadow cast from above, gives Ramar precious little time to act. His head turns upwards as the beast comes plummeting towards him, and his back is already arched as heels come tumbling over head. It may not have been soon enough however, as the beast lands, sending up a spray of mist and rockdust, obscuring the two on the ledge below momentarily... and then Chi-Yosh dives at the monster. When all is said and done, there is no sign of Ramar. In fact there's an eerie stillness in the air until the mist begins rushing out away from the falls. A shadow appears on the face of the waterfall and with the sound of air and water being sliced aside Ramar bursts through the waters, sword swung in a glittering arc above him. As water cascades from the Solar's body, and is sent flying by the swift slice of his sword, Ramar brings it around in one last whirling slash, sending a gout of ichor flying as he rides the force of his landing into the beast, body remaining in constant motion. His knees flex as his feet

Ramars knees flex as his feet hit the beast, and with one swift motion, he is sent flying upwads, heels flying back over his head as he tumbles through the air, angled towards the ledge Gallius had just leapt from.

Roars of pain and frustration erupt from the injured dragon-man, and with a mighty leap he hurls himself toward the instrument of his injury, Gallius, who remains poised on the diamond outcropping of rock above and who is now hard-pressed to bring her weapon to bear in time.

"Gallius!" calls out Davron in dismay, as the beast leaps up toward her. Thinking quickly but perhaps not wisely, he draws a broadhead arrow from his quiver and swings his legs forward just as he severs the rope above him, sending him into a plummeting fall to intercept the monster in mid-flight, curling up his legs and lashing out to kick at the creature, trying to slam him against the side of Gallius' rock with his weight.

The attack is deflected, but barely, and the creature crashes hard against the stone. He begins clawing his way up the edge of the ledge on which he's landed, cursing loudly and fluently.

Davron, meanwhile, falls backward to crash against the ledge behind him, Ramar's hand reaching out to steady the young archer as he recovers his footing. Davron grins and nods his thankfulness to his comrade, then calls out to the creature, "Go back to your Weeping Prowler and tell him we will not be denied! Or else die, and we will tell him ourselves!" The half-circle of the Arrow of Heaven bursts into brilliant life upon his brow as two needle-tipped arrows fly through the air.

With a mighty effort, the creature grips the rock with one great claw, batting away arrow after arrow with its other paw. The thing is breathing heavily, air and water mixing evenly in the wild spray of the waterfall, but it shouts back a defiant, wordless cry, struggling to hold its place.

Angrily the thing lets out another yell, as its prodigious muscles lift it entirely into the air. The creature's hind legs push off the rock, leaping upwards and forward, perhaps a foot from where the brave Roleyn warrior is crouched. It vaults through the air to the spikey ledge beyond, as she wheels...

Gallius spins as the beast leaps and throws herself at its back, jumping high enough to run across the beast's back as she slashes downward. She does not stop, but leaps after her attack to land above where the creature stands.

Chi-Yosh sees the beast leap over Gallius, and as she turns to deal with it, the warrior backs up as far as the ledge will allow, before making a run for it. He crouches at the end and jumps forward, front sliding across the slanted ledge. One kama slashes over the point of the diamond rock, letting him have a momentary grip to pull up. His anima is a soft ambiance, and while not as brilliant as Gallius's own, it warms the water with honey hue. "Your master is Weeping Prowler!" The Dawn booms, his kamas raised. "Then it is your honor to stop us. Then come, beast, and face me." He is in the middle of his circle-mates; if he can get the beast on this ledge, they might flank it. "Fight me, the one who has disgraced Weeping Prowler."

"I've got you Davron," calls Ramar as his hand steadies the recovering Solar. With a nod to his comrade, he swings his sword about, bringing it to his side as he runs along the edge, one foot pushing effortlessly off of the edge of the narrow ledge. His sword slices through the waterfall, cutting a swift swath and sending spray flying as he lands on a ledge, only to push off again this time the momentum from his landing carrying him through the air and towards the spiky ledge. With a whirl of his body, he spins around, letting his sword catch against the cliffside. Ramar uses the leverage of his swing to drive the blade into the stone just so, and he whips his body outward, pushing off of the rocky cliff face, sending him flying off of the edge of the waterfall, however the hand remains gripping the blade tightly, and so he is able to whip himself around arcing his body around the spike as he lands opposite the beast. With two swings on either side of the spike, Ramar draws back for a rather powerful l

Ramar draws back for a rather powerful lunge, Essence rolling away from his body as though it were the mist from the waterfall. As he streams forward, Essence spills and bursts against the spike of the stone, sending steam from the water as the steel blade slices through the stone, sending chunks of rock flying in the beasts face as the tip of the blade pierces both stone and the flesh of the beast opposite it.

Words of challange come as Ramar dives across gap to battle their nemesis. Instead of waiting, Chi-Yosh takes the battle to the monster. He half runs, half slides down the sloped ledge of the rock, before essence is a blazing nova in the wake of his upward spring. One foot strikes the edge of the outcropping Ramar and their enemy is on, and another step brings him closer. His last step, only a foot from the beast, bounds him upwards as his waist twists and rolls, not just putting the arm, but his body and the surge of essence into an uppercut slash at the beast's chest, opposite how it might try to avoid Ramar's blade.

Looking far more than half-dead, the beast manages to throw its great, scaly claw into the way of Chi-Yosh's stroke. It pants heavily, clearly wounded and near to death. But still defiance burns in its eyes.

Gallius lets our a roar and charges, her spear held even. Though she has no horse, she means to strike harder than any cavalry that has ever been and she recklessly throws herself full-tilt into this attack, paying no mind at all to her footing or where she might end up. Her blade and her whole form glitters with burning essence. Her anima, a white lion, charges with her as she lashes out.

Charging through her enemy, Gallius casts him down, but she has not taken into account any apparent means of catching herself. At least not by a ledge! She falls along with her opponent, but as she does she spins and stabs out, her spear driven downwards to bury itself deeply into the face of the cliff. As she is drawn against the unforgiving rock the water swallows her, hiding her from view.

"F-father!" cries the voice of he that plummets, the sorcerous fusion of man and river-dragon. The enormous beast recedes into the mists of the waterfall, blood and foam intermingling for a few seconds. Then he is gone. The waterfall roars on, unceasingly, and uncaringly.

Gallius disappears beneath the rock, and the Su'Katan acts without thought. No worry for the beast struck home, instead he dives downwards. Seeing her fall, the kamas are thrown to the lowest just before he reaches the plummeting Roleyn woman. The momentum carries him, and he pulls her against him, the two of them crash in a skidding slide across the jutted ledge to slack into a jut of the outcropping. Chi-Yosh, partially curled around the woman, takes the brunt of the impact, and nearly cuts himself on his own weapons.

"Aid us!" calls Valon, at last, having concluded that it is time to expect such things. "Your woman is unhurt! Come!" He's barely visible, further down the waterfall, clinging with both hands to the edge of the rock, holding Marina gingerly in the crook of one elbow.

"Gallius..." calls Ramar as the lady is carried past by the force of her blow. Noticing Chi-Yosh diving for Gallius, he nods to Davron. "Alright... shall we swing to the rescue my friend?" Ramar gestures down towards the two hanging from the ledge. "Secure the rope and we'll get down there!"

Feeling herself tumble in an altogether unexpect direction, Gallius nearly loses her grip on her weapon, the blade of it knocked aside to skitter across stone. When she lands, the wind is knocked from her and pushes herself swiftly to her feet, just in time to see Valon dangling below.

Davron nods, bundling up the other end of the rope on his arm, and leaps from rock to rock to join Ramar, then down to the ledge from which Valon and Marina dangle. He braces a foot against the edge of the outcrop. "Climb down, Ramar, and yell when you want me to pull you up."

"I should tell you something!" yells Valon, suddenly, over the waterfall's bellow, and in a strangely altered, infinitely more articulate voice. "You're all passing the tests splendidly!"

Ramar grabs hold of the rope, and braces himself against the edge of the ledge. He pushes himself off and slides down the rope, moving gracefuly to alight on the ledge. He then climbs down the rope, grabbing hold of Valon and Marina, securing them to the rope, before leaping back up himself. "Alright... pull 'em up."

Ramar says, "I'll help... but I'm not as strong as you my friend..."

Marina twists a little, held in Valon's massive arm, seeking to face him. His new voice has quite caught her by surprise, and for a moment she sputters. Then she smiles widely. "Why Valon, thank you. If this was a test, were you allowed to help me?"

"I think I did," he replies, flashing very large, somewhat sharp teeth.

Chi-Yosh makes it to his feet, still suffering the bite of the impact. He just looks among them, knowing that the enemy is gone, and that his friends survived. Putting the kamas up, Valon's call rallies him. He is surprised, but not overly so, and instead of eyes narrowing or a feeling of betrayel, the man simply nods. A glance is given to the two, before back to Gallius, finding none hurt.

Davron hauls at the rope hurriedly, putting his strength to work as he pulls the rescuees to safety. "Valon! If that is who you are. What do you know of the tests? Are you all right, Marina?"

"Let's answer questions once we're all safe," suggests the ape-man, equitably enough. He sputters a little as part of the waterfall's flow splashes into his face.

Marina grins, pointedly not looking down at the foaming waters below. "Yes, Valon, you did. Thank you." She tilts her head, an expression of bemusement briefly inhabiting her features, before she schools them back to a pleasant smile once more. Looking up, she calls that she is in good health, and quite comfortable hands although - she pauses to look at Valon - a rope thrown down might be a kindly act.

---

Five Solars and one ape-man dry themselves by a fire, on the opposite side of the river from which they started. The raft-rope lays coiled up on the shoreline, while all eyes are on their 'guide'.

Ramar ponders Marina. "Are you alright? We were worried when you fell, but Valon had taken you to safety..." He gestures down below, indicating the mist-filled waterfall's end down below. "It is down there... somewhere... the poor creature, created simply to fight and die." Ramar takes hold of his sword, and gives a soft swift whirl, flicking blood and water from it's blade. "Well we're safe ashore now..."

Smiling, Marina nods at Ramar. "A little bruised in my pride, but otherwise fine. Valon was a perfect gentleman."

Davron watches Valon as he carefully re-splices his rope, the activity keeping his hands occupied as his mind ponders the ape-man's sudden change. At length, he breaks the silence. "There is more to you than it seemed at first, Valon - if you are indeed still Valon. Is there anything more you wish to tell us?"

"Wish to? Not really, no," grins the ape-man. "But I'll answer questions, since I'm put in a difficult position." He shifts subtly, looking uncomfortable for the moment.

"Very well then. What precisely is your involvement with all of this? How do you tie in with the tests, and why did your speech shift? I am presuming that some or all of that was simply an act," explains Ramar, "Or so I would be led to believe." He watches the Ape-Man carefully, eyes noting the way the Ape-Man subtly shifts.

Marina crosses her arms across her chest, pointedly, now that she's standing on solid ground. "Indeed you are." She smiles very lopsidedly, but lets Ramar take the lead.

Chi-Yosh doesn't ask questions, not yet. On the one hand, he doesn't want to know. On the other, knowledge in this case can help, and while he does not distrust Valon, an explination is in order. His circle is doing their job well in asking questions for him, for now.

"I was curious what that girl was on about, flitting about the Manse, so I started swinging my way up the cliffs from the lowlands. By the time I'd got there, you all were exploring the area, so I thought to hide and watch. I would have walked away if this lady here--" He gestures to Marina "-- hadn't spotted me. Well, I tell you, I've never felt like a worm on a hook before that day." And he bows politely. "All I could do was make an excuse for my presence, and hide behind stupidity. But she was going to see through me in a day or less."

"And so the truth comes out. In one form or the other." Ramar nods, turning to glance at Marina. He wonders, "Had you already seen through him? Or..." He turns back to Valon, "Then, if you would be so kind as to inform us... what precisely are you meant to do?"

Valon shrugs a bit. "Meant to do? I do what I must, to keep my tribe alive. No, I am not the man you have come here to find."

Marina raises an eyebrow at Valon. "Your tribe is threatened?"

Gallius looks at Valon for a moment, then draws out a binding of papers, half her mind paying heed to the words said, the other on the words that are written.

The ape-man nods. "At times. The Jaguar tribe, Prowler's children, have made trouble for us before. If he is awake again, and he's got a 'prentice, I want to know why, and what they intend to do about us." His face takes on a sterner cast.

"And your involvement with the tests? What of that? How do you know we are passing them, to be somewhat more specific." Ramar asks this softly, and he falls silent, patiently waiting for Valon to relate his tale.

Chi-Yosh watches Valon. Hiding behind stupidity he can understand. Yet, he is partially surprised the beastman is so articulate. Though a question regarding the tests has grown weighted on his tongue, he does not ask about them, given the subject of trails for Valon's tribe ahead. A glance to Ramar, a thankful one for requesting what's on his mind.

Marina keeps an eye on Valon as he speaks, content to let others ask the questions, while she weighs his answers for the truth in them. This time, she is not so trusting as she was just an evening ago. This time, she is filled with doubts. Even if, this time, Valon saved her life.

"Because they are my tests," says Valon softly. "Your sorcerous foe is clearly not testing you. He'd have come himself, and greeted you. He brought you here, stole your sky-ship, and apparently intended for that to be that." He smiles a little, squatting low to the ground and chuckling at something unsaid. "I wanted to know if I should advocate you when he and I meet, should you survive. And I've decided to. If he promised you a test, I will bind him to his word."

"Then what did the one who stole our ship mean when she announced that we were to be introduced to the first part of our test?" Ramar's head turns from Valon to Chi-Yosh briefly, and he nods, turning then to Valon again. "And how would you advocate us when you and he meet? We have indeed come here on our own business, as I'm sure you might have guessed."

"She probably said that so as not to be shot by your friend's very effective bow, I imagine," replies Valon calmly, with a smile. "I would have."

Chi-Yosh's brow sets firmly. The Lunar did not intend to pay him any homage, any respect in the least. Simply stealing the _Seagull_ and leaving them to their own devices. And it is they who slew the Lunar's warrior. "Then let us go to the Prowler's apprentice. I have a word for him."

Marina looks at Valon, eyes narrowed. "And how will you bind him to his word?"

"Very well then," says Ramar, taking a different tact. "What of the Lunar himself? And the apprentice? What do you know of them, and why were you not honest before?"

Gallius looks across at Valon suddenly, her eyes narrowing. "What if the tests we are put-to require us to harm your people? I think the test we have is to get back what is ours and dole out the justice that is deserved." She then turns back to her reading.

Valon rises to his full height. "Prowler will answer to the Silver Pact, or we will strip him of his lands. Maybe his life. Or perhaps we will leave him to you to deal with as you wish. If he broke his word to you, he owes you a great debt." Valon lets out a little sigh. "I'd hoped he wouldn't have sent his men after you. I had hoped he'd simply been... distracted. I'd hoped..."

Marina says, "Why did you hope, Valon?"

The Lunar hangs his head a little bit. "We are all kin. We are... the Chosen of Luna, together. We should not war amongst ourselves. And when we are called together to pass judgement... well, it would be as if one of you betrayed the rest of your Circle. Imagine that, for a moment."

"And what did you hope, Valon? That you're not telling us I mean." Ramar ponders Valon. Head leaning back just a moment. "I... I cannot imagine such a thing. No, but I can begin to comprehend what it must feel. What precisely is the Silver Pact, as I am not terribly well versed on that subject... I can begin to guess at what it is, but I would like to know for certain."

Moving closer, Marina rests her hand on Valon's arm. "We understand, Valon. And we would prefer not to examine that image too closely." She turns to Ramar, and nods. "Yes, we would like to hear of this Silver Pact."

Gallius rises as if she were stabbed somewhere sensitive when she finally hears the words. Chosen of Luna. She grips her naginata as if it were the only thing holding her to life and just stares at the apeman.. the Lunar.

Chi-Yosh frowns deeper. He draws to mind the words of the Lunar, and all he can think of is that the sorcerer never gave a straight answer. He could have given the tests, he would see, he... there is no case against him, no sworn oath, or promise. The man was a fool to trust him, and now he can gain nothing, lest Valon push the sorcerer, or the Dawn challange him.

"The Silver Pact is the society of Lunars. Our way is the Path of Virtue, just as your mentor follows the Path of Paradise. We are those who fight against the corrupt civilization, and who train the newly Chosen of our goddess and our spouse." Valon smiles, grinning widely at this. "I know not what the Unconquered Sun is to you, but I would learn, if we do not die before then. The Pact is the alliance of Lunar elders, who together uphold virtue: Your word before your life, defend yourself and yours, stand brave, respect your superiors and be a blessing to those beneath you."

Davron turns to Gallius. "You haven't had much to say, Gallius. What do..." he begins, then notices her stare fixed on the ape-man. "Uh... what's the matter?" he begins uncertainly.

"The Lunar society..." Ramar's voice trails off a moment, letting the others speak. "I see what you see... your way is the Path of Virtue? Hmmm... then... what is the path we follow? I know that to us the Unconquered Sun is... well it would take me long enough to explain and it would be for my own perceptions only, but I will gladly trade information... however... you have acted dishonestly and right now, I suspect trust will be difficult... yet will you be willing to give your word to advocate us before our Sorcerous Foe?"

Gallius sweeps her naginata forward, aiming its tip towards the Lunar. "I have met few of your kind in my life. One was once my consort. You may have heard of him? Does the name Ma-Ha-Suchi mean anything to you?" She tenses completely, looking as if she were about to test this Lunar roughly.

Valon's eyes grow rather wide. "In this life, or the last?" he asks, curiously, as though the question makes all the difference - which, perhaps, it does.

"I would presume that it is meant in this life. Or in both lives," replies Ramar. He turns, glancing towards Gallius, then towards Chi-Yosh. He shakes his head, and ponders Valon, "And I await your answer to all questions eagerly."

"One long past, it seems. Beyond his memory, perhaps," answers Gallius. "But you will answer me. If you know of Ma-Ha-Suchi, speak swiftly!"

Davron half rises to his feet. "Gallius! What are you..." he begins, then closes his mouth again, returning to his seated position but watching warily. He may not have Gallius' reasons to be suspicious of Lunars, but he respects her own - and all the same, he will act if she takes more precipitous action against a Lunar who could well become our ally.

"Hm. I know the name, but have never met the man," replies Valon slowly. "He is proud, and brave. He practices virtue, but he strives for war. He stands apart from the Pact."

"Then I fear he and I shall have to kill each other, one day," says Gallius. Her weapon is lowered and she turns away from the Lunar, stepping away to (perhaps) get away from the object of her disgust.

"Then I regret having to attend the funeral of a virtuous warrior," says Valon softly. "Whichever of you it may be."

"Indeed... we have much to tell one another, it would seem, and there are more things yet to come." Ramar glances once more towards Gallius. "And you have a long way to come to earn it, it might seem. However, I will ask again, will you be willing to give your word, to vow to guide us safely through to our Sorcerous Foe and to advocate us for him, as you seem to indicate you are willing?"

"I will speak of what I have seen," replies Valon to Ramar, equitably enough. "If you dishonor yourselves, I will speak of that. If you continue to act in the proper way, I will speak of this."

Chi-Yosh just watches the scene unfold before him with a shake of his head. However, things slowly slide into place, and he thinks, and thinks. Valon may be their ally, and the Circle is in need of them. For among other things, the battle of Greyfalls. But first... "The sorcerer who has challanged you. You know him. I desire his respect, for the sake of the Circle, for my homeland, and for what has grown a part of me. How can this be done?"

Valon shrugs at Chi-Yosh. "If he does not honor virtue, I cannot say what he will honor, truly. But we will meet with his 'prentice first, and learn what we can. Then you may confront him, with the elders of the Silver Pact looking on."

"Will you swear an oath to do so," asks Ramar, though he falls silent, nodding to Chi-Yosh. It is best to let other such matters take precedence here.

Davron frowns more deeply, and gazes at Gallius again - to his mind, the larger mission is forgotten for the moment. "Do you hold something against Valon, Gallius?" he says softly, but in a cool tone. "He is not Ma-Ha-Suchi, after all. As you know, the Dragon-Blooded are biased against all of our kind - they call us Anathema, and dismiss us as dangerous demon-spawn. But we know otherwise. So do not make their mistake, by condemning all Lunars on the basis of one."

A powerful furred arm rushes forward suddenly, seizing Ramar by the throat and choking powerfully. "My word IS my oath, boy," snarls the suddenly angry ape-man, resplendent with fury. "Question it again and I will leave you where I found you."

Gallius pauses for a moment to listen to Davron, then continues on, moving well away from the camp without a word. She apparently feels she has no need to trust any Lunar. Fortunately she is far enough away to not notice the choke-hold.

Ramar's head is inclined and drawn back just out of reach of the grasping arm. His hands brush it aside as Essence guided reflexes kep him from being throttled. "I was not aware of that. As I have said, I am not well versed in these matters, though I would learn more. You may rest assured that I shall learn this lesson well." He rubs at his throat, idly.

Marina grins, tapping Valon on the shoulder. "The boy is still ... very young. He has much to learn."

Valon subsides back to his usual amiable self. "I'm sorry if I angered your friend," he says calmly, eyeing Gallius. "I have given my word to guide you. I have given my word to speak for you. The First Age was sundered by promises broken. Never again."

"And by very young, I'm sure it would likely be better phrased as 'very stupid' however... I do have much to learn. I should be quicker on the draw." Ramar nods to Valon. "I do not believe it is you she is angry at, but rather Lunars in general. I cannot say for certain, however. I appreciate that you have given your word." He lets his head bow a moment, and he keeps his head bowed, falling silent for a while, pondering.

"Fair enough, Valon." Marina smiles for a moment, eyeing him thoughtfully. "Tell me, though. Are there ways in which we can prepare for this meeting? Ways in which we can strengthen our case, as it were?"

Chi-Yosh nods sagely. He understands the Lunar's violent reaction. He puts word before life, and defends that word with that very life. "We owe you no disrespect," He offers to the Lunar. "I know I would be glad to help you, be your ally, Valon. I hope that we can prove ourselves further to be worthy of your help in the future, if we need it."

Davron rises to a standing position, and glances between the four remaining by the fire. "Well spoken, Valon. We all need to put our differences aside and find the common ground that we lost centuries ago." He bows. "Now if you'll excuse me for a moment..." he says, turning to join Gallius away from the Circle - her reaction to the Lunar's presence still worries him - both for everyone's sake and for Gallius' in particular.

A change comes over the beast-man, a shifting of form and figure. His body flows, fur retracting into skin, his clothes growing baggier and baggier. He finally stops, having assumed the form of a man, and takes a moment to cinch the belt he wears, grinning like an idiot. He's actually a rather handsome fellow, with a square jaw and piercing eyes, but with dirty hair the color of his ape's fur. "Well, it would help if you told me the particulars of how all this happened...."

Gallius is away from the camp, not too far, but far enough to be entirely out of view, which is probably what she desired.

"I see. Well then I shall do my best to inform you of how it had all come to be. However... I would rather have everyone in the circle here. Just the same I shall tell the tale as best as I can, and I will leave nothing that I am aware of out. You have my word." Ramar glances to Chi-Yosh, curiously, "Or would you rather tell?"

Chi-Yosh smiles to Ramar. "I will begin," he merely explains, turning back to the now human-looking Lunar. "I am of the Su'Katan. I had come to the Maze, by what would be the pullings of fate. I stumbled upon the Manse, and became one with it. And took the stone within as the jaguar found me. I fled, leaped from the cliff we landed upon, onto the deck of our flying boat."

"And after our friend Chi-Yosh had landed, we took him back to Nane, where we are based. You speak of our mentor, someone who is the Chosen of Paradise. I will save my inquiry about this until after the tale is told." Ramar glances at Valon once again. "As of late we were to be tested by our mentor, and if you are awae of the problem between Syllum and Korad, then I need say no more regarding that... if not..." Ramar then explains the situation in Syllum and Korad, telling how they had intervened with the Spirit Wars and gone back to Nane. He also tells what he knows of Chi-Yosh's dreams and their dealings with Gallius and Ma-Ha-Suchi.

Valon nods slowly as the two men finish their tale. "Well, it certainly sounds like you've had interesting times," he remarks with a smile. "I don't suppose you know why Prowler was in such a hurry to get his Hearthstone back?"

Chi-Yosh shakes his head. "I had thought it was a matter of honor and insult. But now, I do not know anything about him. I will make no more assumptions."

Valon nods thoughtfully. "He's never been attuned to the Manse. He's never entered it, as far as any of my people knew. I don't suppose it's important, but I do know he's guarded it more tightly than the Manse's power merits."

"Interesting." Ramar continues speaking then, though the rest of the Circle may cringe. "So what do you know of our mentor? You spoke of the... Chosen of Paradise... I wish to know what precisely you know, and I would also like to know, concerning the information I have given you, how much you didn't already know?"\\

"The rumor is that a Sidereal Exalt with a sky-ship has been operating in the east. I put two and two together," smiles the Lunar.

"Which is something I seem to have trouble doing. I should learn arithmetic." Ramar shakes his head. "So where precisely is our destination, and how many more trials will we face on our way there?"

Valon shrugs a bit. "You mean attacks? I have no idea. Our destination is to the north, past the high river that trails down from the mountains and joins the lake that freezes early."

"Well if we might continue this conversation Valon, I am eager to learn more of you and your tribes and the doings of the Lunars. If you will share such information that is." Ramar looks about, "Though perhaps we would do better to continue moving and return to the conversation later in the evening when we make camp. If we are to make camp." Ramar stands up and turns to go, though he motions to Valon, "Lead the way. You seem to know where we're going better than any of us."

---

Just as Gallius was thinking she managed to duck away out of view (and trouble, in her mind) she finds out that she's been followed. When Davron finally gets up to her he's going to find a distinctly different Gallius than the one he's probably gotten used to. The proud heir of Roleyn appears to be crying.

Davron pushes aside a branch as he follows, determined to deliver a quiet but firm reproof for Gallius' behavior toward the Lunar in our midst. "Gallius," he begins, but the reproof dies on his lips when he discovers her in tears. He's momentarily taken aback, eyes widening in astonishment. When he speaks again, his tone is muted indeed, hesitant even. "Gallius? What's wrong?"

"It happened again," she murmurs softly. "I.. I felt it. I felt it and I don't know what is happening anymore." Gallius doesn't even bother wiping at her eyes. The damage is done, and she can't hide it. Nor stop it, seemingly. "I remembered something, only this time I felt it but it didn't go away. It's so strange."

Davron looks puzzled for a moment - he has yet to be plagued with memories of his past lives himself. But then he remembers her words to Valon. "You remembered something from... from your past? Before you were Gallius?" His countenance softens, as curiosity and courtesy war in his mind. Curiosity wins out for the moment. "What... what did you remember, this time?" He takes a hesitant step forward.

"I knew before that I was his wife," murmurs Gallius. "Now I know that I loved him. And the feeling didn't go away, this time." She frowns, trying to explain, "I've fought so many things in my life, I've mastered my fears and faced my own death only wishing to bring victory.. but now I face something I cannot possibly defeat."

Davron is quiet for a moment. He feels as if he is on the outside looking in, as Gallius reveals these things to him... but he cannot ignore his comrade's distress. "And now... you don't know what you would do if you faced him again...?" he says haltingly, uncertainly.

"How can I know?" Gallius says softly. "I hate him and yet I feel this way. It's absurd, but emotions often are." The lady sighs softly, resting her hands on her naginata. "I think I must find out just what these Chosen of Luna really are. Once we were clearly necessary for each other, so why now do they seek to destroy us?"

Davron nods slowly. "Once we were _all_ necessary for one another - Solars, Lunars, Sidereals, the Dragon-Blooded, and mortals alike." He hesitates for a moment, before he continues, his eyes downcast, the words coming out slowly as if they were painful to him. "If the Master's words are true, it was we Solars who changed - became arrogant and dissolute." He swallows, and looks up again. "Now we are reborn anew - but they still remember the Anathema of old."

"Perhaps," murmurs Gallius. "My memories all seem to be of Ma.. of him." She laughs bitterly, "I cannot even say the name. I'm afraid of it." She pushes away her thoughts for a moment to focus on Davron, "Tell me honestly, if you could have whatever you would, what would that be?"

Davron's eyes go wide at the unexpected change of subject. "Me? I- I don't know. I've hardly had time, since my Exaltation, to truly think about it..." he begins. He looks out into the distant woods for a long moment, as if he would find what he sought there. Then he turns his gaze to Gallius once more. "I would have peace. I would no longer have these foolish quarrels that set one man against another, that spill blood upon the ground for no other reason that it has been spilt before. I would see justice, rather than revenge. I would see those that hate, see the grief their hate has caused, and repent of it."

"I hope someday your dream comes true, Davron," answers Gallius. "Perhaps then this will not be needed anymore," she says, indicating her weapon. "I once dreamt of something, but it is confused now. I must seek on, I think, to find something new." Here the lady pauses for a moment, softly admitting, "But I am afraid."

Davron tilts his head. "What do you fear?" he asks simply.

"I'm not even sure," answers Gallius. "Is that foolish? I am simply afraid. I feel like I am losing what little control I had. I am changing so much. Perhaps that is it. At what point am I no longer myself?" She smiles, shaking her head, "Or perhaps I am simply nervous. I am just finding out who and what I really am."

Davron nods. "It's hardly foolish at all. All of us are finding that we are not who we once thought we were. You are just having a more direct experience of it than the rest of us have... so far. You are Gallius, but you are also the woman who was the wife of Ma-Ha-Suchi. And perhaps many others besides." He pauses, considering. "But as to that... I doubt _she_ would have loved the man Ma-Ha-Suchi is now. The man she would have loved... is one I think I would be pleased to meet. Indeed, may have met, so many ages ago." He smiles sheepishly. "Call _me_ foolish if you will, but I still have hope that I - that _you_ - might meet him again someday."

"Perhaps I will," says Gallius. "I just have trouble accepting that I could love anyone who would one day do this. I am confused." She looks at Davron closely, "I hope your memories are less awkward. I am sure these must happen to all who are chosen. And yet each time I remember I learn something new. I remember events and suddenly I know things that I did not before."

Davron bows his head. "So do I. And yet my heart forbodes that it is not so." He runs his hands along the orichalcum filigree on his powerbow. "The hands that made this, and that draw it, were the hands of a warrior. Perhaps he regretted having to kill, but he did so all the same, and he was good at it. I fear I may be... most distressed indeed, when I remember whose hands these are, and know that they are my own."

"They are, and they are not," murmurs Gallius. "Though I'm beginning to think that my spirit clings strongly to what it was. Perhaps she was much like me, and thus her feelings cling tightly to me. If Ma-Ha-Suchi." She sighs, "Yes, I can say it. If Ma-Ha-Suchi were not so violent, what then would I think? My heart is divided between two, now."

"No wonder you are afraid. I would be too, I think." Davron is quiet for a moment. "I... don't know what to tell you, Gallius. I may have hope, but hope is not fact. Perhaps... perhaps the first step is as you said before - to find out who the Lunars truly are. Non Valon seems an honorable man, and perhaps even Weeping Prowler has good reasons for what he's done. I think we all need to learn about our erstwhile brethren, before we face Ma-Ha-Suchi again."

"I cannot face him until I am much stronger," answers Gallius. "From what I feel, our relationship relied on strength and respect. I am just a child to him, now. I fear that he might be offended if he learned whom I once was." She looks back towards the camp, sighing, "I must apologize to Valon. Though I will keep the matter between he and I. If he is a he. How can we tell?"

Davron chuckles softly. "I do not know. Perhaps you can ask him some time, if he is willing to say. Or she, as the case may be." He sobers again. "We must all grow stronger. Our dreams - yours, and mine, and Chi-Yosh's, and Ramar's, and Marina's - are the dreams of those we once were, and need _their_ strength to be made reality. Until then... let us take the challenges as they come, and grow from them." He reaches out a hand. "Shall we return to the others? They must be worried about us by now."

Gallius considers Davron's hand for a moment and then extends her own to clasp it. "We should return." The lady rises smoothly, standing straight and apparently forgetting that some tears still stain her cheeks. Or perhaps it no longer matters.

Davron half-bows graciously, and the two Solars turn their back on the deep forest and make their way back to their comrades, and the strange Lunar who accompanies them. _The past is not forgotten,_ he thinks, _but it is behind us. Our future lies ahead._
