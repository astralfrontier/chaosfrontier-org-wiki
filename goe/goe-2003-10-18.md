The time of merriment is perhaps not necessarily passed, but to Gallius it seems fitting that now she should grow more serious. These are the elders, after all, and they are her best chance she has of learning anything of use about her soul's former pairing. She will approach them and offer a soft greeting, "It has been a fine day, Chosen of Luna, and I have greatly enjoyed your company. I hope a question will not trouble you, as there is a matter near to my heart. Tell me, do any of you know of Ma-Ha-Suchi?" The name still clouds her mind with worries, but she says it clearly.

The six elders are gathered together, all bearing animal forms, and each wearing the shape of a predator. Whatever they are conferring on, they break away from their circle, growing and rising into the shapes of men once again. "Chosen of Helios," one replies, he called Sunrise Seer. "Our companion, Three Fang, has had dealings with this Ma-Ha-Suchi. I will translate for you." And he turns, speaking to another of the elders rapidly in that strange tongue which Gallius now recognizes faintly as Old Realm. No words share their meaning with her yet, but the sound itself is familiar, as music heard long ago and later forgotten.

Gallius will turn to consider the one named Three Fang. She nods her head and smiles. "I am eager to hear what I might. If my soul knows rightly, once I stood at Ma-Ha-Suchi's side, and I would learn what I can of him."

The Seer's words flow between the two, melding softly into the background of Gallius' consciousness, and the dark depths of the eyes of this ancient Lunar take the foremost position in her attention. "Ma-Ha-Suchi was an idealist at one time, a survivor of hardships great and small, and a warrior of great stature," relates the tale-teller, through his proxy. "He loved Luna with all his heart, and still does, and he seeks to regain her favor for her Chosen."

"Can you explain to me why he killed the men of Roleyn and why he stages raids on my people?" asks Gallius. "I know his strength first-hand, and I respect it, but I also feel there is more there. Did you.." She considers this question very carefully before going on. "Did you know his wife?"

"I did not," the old sage replies. "The Solars were above us, ever above us, and there they stayed. None of us here fought in the First War, the War that ended everything and began everything. By the time we were Chosen, your predecessors had become decadent and corrupt, twisted by their own brilliance." He pauses, and Seer waits. Then a stream of words, told in a harsh cadence, like a recital of a story, begins, and Seer translates as best he is able. "To destroy the realm... the goat and the wolf, he who was cast down, has risen again from his ashes... he marches and slays, he takes what he will, to bring chaos and strife... and when the Realm comes, he will march forth with his brothers and sisters, leading those who cannot do anything else now but fight..."

"What can we do to avoid that fate?" asks Gallius. "We are still Solars, our souls are much the same as they were then. How can we avoid the corruption our powers caused?" The Lady diverges in questions, turning back to Ma-Ha-Suchi, "And how can I gain the trust and respect of Ma-Ha-Suchi. If it was the fault of my soul in the past that he has suffered I feel compelled to atone for it. Perhaps that is the answer to my first question."

"Give him the greatness he saw crumble with his own eyes," is Three Fang's reply, translated by Seer. "Destroy the Realm. That is what he wishes. He wishes for the world to be pure again. He wishes..." Three Fang speaks, and Seer turns to him, and for half a minute they exchange in a series of questions and answers. Finally Seer attempts to explain. "Give him a world that he can understand again."

"Would it be possible to send him a message?" asks Gallius. "It will be short, and to the point, I hate to waste his time, and I will do as you ask. The Realm will be destroyed, and perhaps then my people can be forgiven for the past. Perhaps we can avoid repeating those errors again." The Lady's voice grows more confident as she speaks, "I think I am ready. The hammer shall soon fall. Perhaps the time is upon us when the lies can be shattered at last."

"We can arrange for a message," says Sunrise Seer, amicably. "If he is to reply, he must find his own way."

"I wish I knew the name to tell him," says Gallius. "Say that his mate of ages past has returned and wishes to prove herself worthy of the honor he once gave her." The proud lady of Roleyn for a moment seems lost in thought, but she does not show any signs of uncertainty, "Tell Ma-Ha-Suchi that he may find me treading the crushed walls of Greyfalls. There I hope to meet him, when the time is right."

Seer inclines his head and begins speaking rapidly to his fellows again, apparently explaining the message and perhaps commenting on it, for a great deal of speech is involved. Finally he nods again in assent and replies, "It will be done."

Gallius smiles and nods, "I am in your debt, elders. I hope by doing my duty against the Realm I also am repaying your favor. I wonder, though, what Ma-Ha-Suchi will think of this child who was forged with his consort's soul. I hope he does not think ill of me, just because I am still young." She offers a deep bow, "Thank you for your help and your wisdom. If ever I might be of aid, send word and I shall do whatever I may to help you."

"Ma-Ha-Suchi has claim to many years," says Seer, after a moment listening to Three Fang adding something. "But he, too, is young in some ways."

Gallius bows her head to Seer. "I can only hope that one day we might be friends. Thank you for your aid, elders." With another deep bow the lady turns away, leaving them to speak amongst themselves again. She will turn her attentions towards hunting another Lunar, now. "Now where is that absurd apeman?" she murmurs to herself.

Valon is a difficult man to find indeed, but finally Gallius' prowling yields results. She can overhear voices in the distance, in the forest next to the crystal mansion in which Weeping Prowler abides. Creeping closer, she discovers an enormous cave, open, at the mouth of which the two Lunars - Prowler and Non Valon - are facing each other, talking. Within the cave is the barest outline of a half-shadowed humanoid figure, twenty feet in height, and armored like a knight. "And I'd like you to operate it," Prowler is saying, while Valon nods. Both men turn as once, regarding the newcomer silently.

Gallius pauses, her eyes catching the curious sight and for a moment, she has to wonder just what it might be here for. "I'm terribly sorry, I didn't realize you were busy. Perhaps when you are done with business I might borrow Valon?" She offers a bow and prepares to make her retreat. She'll have to bring up what she's seen to the other's, though. They'll probably want to see the statue for themselves.

"That's not necessary," the ape-man replies casually, and turning his head to Prowler, he quietly adds, "find me a stone, though. And weapons." Then he's loping amiably across the green forest carpet, stopping when he's a few feet away. "What can I do for you?"

"Walk with me," answers Gallius. "And perhaps answer a few difficult questions. Though I will try not to pry overmuch in things that are not meant for me. Whatever you spoke with Weeping Prowler about is probably private, and my curiousity can sit on a fire as far as that is concerned." The lady grins and turns away, her feet winding back towards the lake.

Valon follows casually, whistling. "I'm great at difficult questions. I'm still brushing up on difficult answers," he remarks with a wry grin.

Gallius laughs softly, "That is just as well. Anyway.." She trails off, just watching Valon and shaking her head. "You know your complete lazy ease is almost irritating. Perhaps I can find a way to shake it up some day. I want to ask you about Greyfalls and the elders here. Is there any involvement? Are the Chosen of Luna going to take an active role in the fight against the Realm?"

"Yes," remarks Valon, just as casually, and without any of his normal elaboration or distraction.

"I want to help," Gallius says simply. "I have asked the elders to send a message to Ma-Ha-Suchi, and I would like to meet him there, standing on the broken walls of the city. And on the broken backs of our enemies." She does not smile. "Will you be there, Valon? It would be.. a comfort. I would like to know at least on Lunar is near who probably won't seek my death."

"Oh, I pretty much have to be there now," smiles the Lunar. "Prowler talked me into helping him out with something."

Gallius lets out a soft sigh, "You don't realize how comforting that is, Valon." She relents her seriousness and offers a warm smile, "I must confess, I am eager to show myself. I tire of hiding in shadows. The Unconquered Sun is meant to be seen, not covered under a veil!" She continues towards the lake, and also continues asking questions. "Will you need any help doing what Prowler asks of you?"

"Yeah, but he'll provide what I need," replies Valon calmly, ambling forward. He reaches down, taking a smooth stone in one rough hand and chucking it out over the waters, making it skip and watching as it sends wider and wider ripples through the surface.

Gallius stops at the water's edge and looks out across its surface. "How old are you, Valon?" she asks suddenly. "Or is that considered a rude question? There is much I do not yet know." She lowers herself to sit by the lake, feet sprawling out in front of her.

The Lunar muses. "I'd say probably... uh... about twenty centuries now," he says at last. "Though some of that time I was close to chimeric, so I don't suppose it counts... A lot of that time, really."

Gallius lets out a soft sigh, "I'm just a child." She picks up a stone and casts it out, sending it skipping wildly over the lake's surface. "A child with far more power than she probably should have. There are so many things I wish I knew, Valon. There are no answers, though. Not yet."

"Well, go ahead and ask then," he offers encouragingly, settling down on the lakeshore beside Gallius. "I will say this... To my knowledge, there has never been an Exaltation of anyone who wasn't worthy of it, in their god's judgement."

"How will I know when I can finally act?" Gallius murmurs. "I feel so much power in me, but the Realm is still greater. Knowing this, I still feel the time for hiding is nearly past. I want to use my strength to set things right." The lady laughs softly, "At least I know I'm not invincible."

"Well," suggests Valon slowly, considering. "The Lunar trials try to establish that sort of thing as quickly as possible. The supplicant is required to prove that she can at least survive on her own without aid, using her own judgement and powers. After that, well, you're assumed to have discretion enough to know when to fight or flee. Danger makes a good teacher."

"But there are no trials for the Solars," answers Gallius. "And even if there once were, no one is likely to remember them now." She leans back and stares at the sky, "Hmm, and yet you give me an answer. It is simple, really. If danger is to be my trial, then a great test is coming. If only I had a thousand good men and skilled engineers I know I could show everyone that I'm more than just a child." Gallius continues in a more serious tone, "The thought of battle always sets a fire in me. There's no game of chance like it, and every last move must be planned perfectly or men will die."

Valon shrugs. "Then why not go get a thousand good men and skilled engineers?" he suggests.

Gallius laughs softly, "Because I can't think of any way to do that. I'd guess that the battle is going to take place long before I could ready such things. And I do not have the coffers for it. Soldiers cannot live off of the air, after all, and skilled men require fair pay." The would-be general laughs and teases, "Unless you are hiding a thousand men somewhere."

"Oh, well, they mostly hide themselves," smiles Valon, the ruler of the Eastern ape-tribes. "They're very good at that when called to do so."

"Your people are going to fight the Realm?" asks Gallius, sounding more than a bit surprised. Or perhaps she's merely jumping to conclusions. "I don't suppose you need a captain who is eager to test herself.." She turns to teasing, "I have good credentials and experience. And I know you can't let me out of your sight."

"I have a captain," replies Valon. "However, I am always in the market for a better one. Prove yourself, and I might consider you." He smiles, laying back on the lakeshore, folding his hands behind his head and shutting his eyes.

"What tests would you put me to, Valon?" asks Gallius, her voice no longer anything but dead serious. "I tire of this cage, and I know I can do well. Unless I am wrong, I will be needed." She turns her eyes to study her companion, "Valon, this is what I was meant to do."

"Tests? Just one. My war-chief will lead a raid of his own men on a village in Greyfalls, and carry away as much as he can. You may lead another raid on another village, at the same time. Whoever brings back the most usable supplies becomes my new war-chief." Valon hums softly to himself, as though he had no greater problems in the world than soaking up sunlight.

Gallius grins, "I can do that. It'll be easier than scratching Ma-Ha-Suchi's chin with my spear, I wager." She offers a stretch and then asks, "Will I have time to train my raiding party? I tend to use rather exotic tactics in certain situations." And she has to find out what these men are capable of, too.

"Hmm. I'll arrange the raid on the first day of Descending Fire. You have until then." A month and a half away. Valon scratches himself lightly, wriggling a bit on the lakeshore and breathing contentedly.

"That will be more than adequate, Valon," answers Gallius. Already in her mind she's planning things out. She won't lose. "And thank you. For being fair and putting up with my pushiness, I mean."

"At worst I lose five hundred barbarian allies to a bad leader," he comments. "Which I can do anyway, except this time she'd have been friendly to me beforehand. At best, I gain a military advantage. I don't see the problem, unless my war-chief challenges you for the insult to his honor." The ape-man hums for another moment or two. "But that's between you and him."

"I hope that will not be necessary," answers Gallius. Her tone makes it clear that if it is, she will not shy from it. "You know, Valon, if someone saw us they'd think we were talking about the weather or flowers. Does anything get you to show any signs of excitement or worry?"

"Sure. Things that excite or worry me," grins Valon, opening one eye and peering up at Gallius. "You know... when I'm fighting, I get very angry. It's a part of me. But it's not the whole of me, so relax when I am free to. It's just what is natural. You're calm at calm times and angry at angry times."

"I suppose I need more calm times," answers Gallius. "Once I show you that I know my way around a battle, I hope you can tell me more about Greyfalls. About why this is happening now. I have a feeling it's going to be the spark of something great, but it has potential to destroy the lives of thousands, just like any battle."

Valon shrugs from where he is, and opens his other eye to regard the sky above. "Looks like rain," he says softly, then continues speaking more audibly. "The Scavenger Lands want the Realm out. Some hot-headed orator in the Confederation Council probably went all-out on this one. Or they have intelligence that I don't."

Gallius grins, "That's usually how it starts, isn't it? I wonder how many men Roleyn has sent? My father likely will want to be involved in some way. The Realm is mostly disliked where I come from."

"Why aren't you leading them, then?" asks Valon curiously. "Why come to me?" He sits up now, returning himself to his casual squat and looking at Gallius questioningly.

"Because I plan on revealing myself in this battle, Valon," she replies softly. "And somehow it will be far easier if I am not among the people I know. I fear they will never see me the same way again. I would rather be at the head of a force that I know will follow me. A force that I don't have to deceive by pretending to be mortal. I feel I would have to do that if I served my father."

The ape-man raises his eyebrows briefly in a muted "shrug", and looks away. "Well, yes, you have a point. If you're going to reveal yourself as a reputed soul-eating demon, best to do it at the head of an army of hostile beast-man barbarians, rather than confiding in your family and the trusted commanders of your own nation's people." He does sound only faintly sarcastic.

Gallius laughs softly, "Perhaps I am a fool." She looks at the sky, "But I'm afraid of getting my people killed. I'm afraid that I will cause them to gain attention from the Hunt that they cannot withstand." She looks sadly at the waters, then, "I do not know, maybe I am just a foolish child. I think I will go rest and perhaps think then of what I should do. The paths I desire first never seem to be the right way, and the part of me that remembers being strong tires of it." She rises and bows, "Good night, Valon."

"When you go, Gallius," suggests the Lunar, "ask yourself. The Hunt or the Realm's own troops and auxiliaries. Are they such different fates, that men willing to die under your command against the second would curse your name for the first?" But he too stands, brushing himself off casually.

The Lady sighs softly, "Perhaps they are not." And with that, she turns away. For a few steps, her shoulders sink, defeated. But the armor and mask reappear then, and she stands arrow-straight, striding off.
