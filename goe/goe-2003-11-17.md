The small village has grown somewhat in the past couple days with the arrival of the forces of Roleyn. The riders arrived several days ahead of the CoR forces, and thus they have time to rest here, and to serve the good purpose of making friends with strangers. Gallius can be found resting outside the village, her back against a tree. At her side is Jin-nu, and not far away sit three of her friends. Lady Yuri, Gari, and Malis.

"Gallius, there you are," comes a voice from within the tree's branches. "I was hoping you'd come back, and that we would not have to go and rescue you and your friends. I'm glad to see I was right." There's a rustling above, one which sends leaves fluttering down towards the ground. As lightly as they fall, so does Ramar, his feet barely making a sound as he drops from the tree. "Good afternoon."

Gallius laughs softly, "It was a worthy venture, and it all turned out well enough," she answers. "I still wait for the decision of the people, but I trust them to come out to safety soon enough." She looks towards Greyfalls, her eyes studying the direction, "I hope they do not wait too long. We have done what we can, though, and that will have to suffice. There is one last matter still weighing on my mind. Perhaps we can remedy it sometime tonight or in the morning."

"Then if all that can be done has been done, it shal have to be enough." Ramar's voice bears a resolved tone to it. "And if it is not, then we shall have to do more. I thank you Gallius, your actions have saved many lives, with any luck." He turns to regard Yuri, Gary, and Malis, then asks Gallius, "Only one matter that ways on your mind? I envy you..." His voice trails off slowly, then, "The river, I would presume is what you refer to."

"Indeed," says Gallius. "All other things are pushed away right now. My various love interests are put-off for now." At this, Gari laughs softly, earning a sidelong glance from Lady Yuri that leaves him silent. "I wish to win this battle without destroying my enemy," Gallius explains. "There is one in there in which I have found a kindred spirit, I think. She is fair, just, and courageous. I hope I may meet Alcis again, though I imagine she is terrified of what I am. For I was revealed to them."

Ramar raises a confused look upon hearing Gallius' comments, at least until he realize it's merely a jest. "Yes, indeed. That is the hope of all generals who go to war... and with luck, and our gifts, we shall. If indeed you have found a kindred spirit, it may prove to be useful." Ramar pauses a moment though, when he learns she has been revealed. "You have? If I might ask... why?"

"I met Greyfalls," answers Gallius. "He used his power to bless our promise to one another, and when it was done my mark glowed, as did her's. I feared for a moment I might be attacked, but not by Alcis. Greyfalls did not even seem surprised by it." Gallius laughs softly, "Ah well, it matters little. In what is to come I shall be revealed even more clearly still."

"Indeed. Know, Gallius, that I am not questioning your wisdom, or your decisions, but that I merely wish to learn the reasoning behind them and to further my understanding." Ramar smiles softly, "And Greyfalls would seem to know what you are already, as many other Spirits might. I would caution you though, if I am permitted... revealing yourself to so many people is bound to attract attention, and if the Hunt is looking for you in Roleyn... then they may well come here in search of you, or at least redouble their efforts in the East. Perhaps we should do some travelling when all is said and done?"

"I will leave the city when all is ready for it," answers Gallius softly. "But in this, the hunt is but a small matter. The fortress is fully prepared for a siege. They have chained the inner gates, so that in the last minutes they might stand there and fight to the last." Gallius sighs, "May our army never have to pierce those walls," she prays.

"If I understand their strategy properly, they will not have to. Is it not to simply wait them out, after the river has been persuaded to flow elsewhere? I am confused, of late, as to what is going to happen. Both a blessing and a curse." Ramar bows his head, and leans back against the tree.

"Even if they starve them out," says Malis, "They will have to fight them eventually. They are also very well stocked. It seems that the defenders are ready for a siege." Gallius nods to Malis, "And it will be a sad business. I do not want those people to suffer through such things. I worry even for the fanatics of the Realm. They all might have their worth, if we had time to teach them the error of their ways."

"Then perhaps we may find a way to bring them to defeat without needing to destroy them utterly." Ramar muses on the matter ahead for a few moments, "I seem to recall hearing of tunnels... perhaps we may use those to our advantage, if they have not yet done so." He turns to Gallius, "And I would not call them fanatics of the Realm, is it fanatic to be raised as nobility? " He strokes his chin thoughtfully, "And yet... you raise an interesting point. I wonder... when the time comes... who will teach us the error of our ways?"

"I trust to Lord Helios to watch over me," answers Gallius. "And we will watch each other, as well. I am not afraid now. The Unconquered Sun is smiling upon me and I know his desires. As long as we are true to our purpose we cannot fail. The Light shall shine brighter than ever."

"Indeed. We can only hope so, yet we must not be overconfident, lest we too succumb to whatever it was that drove things to end the way they had in the past. We must not lose sight of our purpose... yet be careful of the burdens we bear. We must be mindful of it, yet strive to create new things..." Ramar chuckles dismissively, "It is a puzzling paradox, best saved for talk when one can speak for hours and mean nothing."

"I fear right now we have hours that are valuable, yet we must wait, letting them slip away one by one," says Gallius. "A few more moves and the board shall be set. It seems things here are calm enough, though. The villagers and the warriors of Roleyn are getting on well. Perhaps there shall be some good things coming of this yet. I wonder if I might preside over a few weddings before the battle ends." She smiles warmly, considering her friends here carefully. "I do not know that I am overconfident, I am simply untroubled. We will have done all we can soon enough, and that is all we can do. Why worry over anything else?"

"Then perhaps we should not waste them." Ramar smiles, standing upright. "And I hope that the battle ends well. It shall be interesting, perhaps you shall have a new village to join Roleyn when all is said and done..." A pause. "I know, Gallius. I know. We will do what we can. As to worrying over other things, I think of them because someone must. I do not let them trouble me, nor do I take on too much at once, but my mind is ever wandering, as you have said."

"It seems you will ever be the dreamer and wanderer, Ramar. Even when you manage to sit still for a few seconds your mind moves," says Gallius. She smiles, "There is little to do but to wait, though. I think it best if we go to the river under cover of darkness and learn what we might. I also should probably corner Valon and see if he has any more useful information."

"The world is changing... you can feel it in the winds... if not for dreamers and wanderers, where would we be, but swept up in the tides of change?" Ramar looks off in the distance, as though seeing to the edges of the world and beyond. A second later he snaps back, "And indeed, perhaps there is little to do but wait. Perhaps not. I think we might find something useful to do." Ramar grins mischeviously, his voice taking on a teasing tone, "Despite your desire to... corner Valon."

Lady Yuri blushes and Gari roars with laughter. Gallius just grins, "Well, he is quite the fetching man, isn't he?" she murmurs. "In any case, my love life is so confusing now that I think war is almost simple. A pity that so many of the men in my life might be involved. I will try to remain focused on what really matters."

"And of the few things which do matter, Gallius, Love is one of them." Ramar gestures, "Or so I believe. In any case, while it might matter, at present it may not be relevant, I should just not wish you to dismiss such things as trivial."

"If there is one thing I've learned from my father," says Gallius, "It is that my emotions cannot come before the people. I have power and it comes with a cost. A very high cost, perhaps. My personal feelings must come second." She pauses to look off towards the Roleyn camp, "Now it seems they come fifth. Roleyn, the barbarians of Valon, the people of this village, and the commoners of Greyfalls all come before me."

"Then you have much to think of. Power seldom comes without price or responsibility. Often those who seek it do not deserve it, or are ill prepared for it. It is a burden, but one necessary at times." Ramar places a hand on Gallius' shoulder, "Know that we are here to aid you in your effort, and the weight of those that come before you rests not on your shoulders alone."

"I think we shall do well, Ramar," says Gallius. "And it seems not such a burden to me. I would have it no other way. Though I'd be lying if I didn't admit there are moments when I wish I could be away from all this. And yet here I am, not likely to be free of responsibilities for years."

"Indeed." Ramar chuckles, and bows, "Though I think that there are moments when you will be away from all this, and in those moments, you will wish to be nowhere but back here, in the thick of these things you know well."

Gallius grins, "We will see. Depends what I am doing away from all this, I imagine. There are so many things I want to do! And so many duties I'd like to see done. I need to learn to relax and trust things more to others. I want my hands in everything."

"As do we all, Gallius." Ramar smiles, looking about, "If trees could talk this one likely has a thousand and one stories to tell." He regards Gallius once more, "And such lessons will come in time, along with others. We all have much to learn, we have a long ways to grow, and a thousand lifetimes in which to do so."

Gallius leans back against the tree and lets out a soft sigh, "What do you want to do when Greyfalls is behind us?" she asks.

"Me?" Ramar looks somewhat surprised. "When Greyfalls is behind us, I wish to journey for a time, I feel Creation calling to me. I suspect I should head North first, for I would seek the answer to the riddle of the ruined keep there. But... why is it you ask?"

"I am curious, is that not the reason to ask all questions?" replies Gallius. "I have a task I must see to. Likely I shall first have to do much fixing of Greyfalls and the villages here abouts. Probably will also need to arrange a very good supply train from Roleyn as well. I fear much damage may be done and the people here will need all the help they can get."

"Then we shall have to see to it that they receive all of the help we are able to give them, and lay seeds to grow into fruition in later years, should we be called away ere we're done." Ramar looks around the village, taking it in, "It is interesting to look around now... life as it is shall not be the same in these parts... but with our help, perhaps it can be better."

"It will be better," says Gallius. "The truth will see to it. I didn't come here to defeat the Realm, after all." This earns a curious look from her friends, but she does not react to it, just smiling instead.

"No, I imagine you didn't. I would ask why it is you have come here, though I think I might guess at that." Ramar tilts his head, "Just the same, I shall ask, to ensure I am not mistaken."

"To create something new," answers Gallius. "To prevent disaster, as well. And because I think there are none better than I to lead this force. When all this comes to end, I want to begin something new in Greyfalls. I want one place in the world to not only understand what it means to be Chosen of the Sun, but to love and respect us. A place where we can be safe and happy."

"That is along the lines of what I had thought. And I must agree, you are perhaps the best leader I can think of. When things come to an end, that is something to work towards, if there are no such places yet in existence." Ramar pauses a moment, his voice falling, "Though it must be done carefully, lest it be discovered. Such a thing will attract the attentions of those who... would make creative use of Chosen Ones, such as we."

"Indeed, but we need not stay for long," says Gallius. "And this place may prove a most dangerous target, even for the might of the Realm. If we win over many of those here, we can create quite a defensive power." She smiles at this, "It is perhaps too much to hope for, but I will hope nonetheless."

"Hope is eternal, for without it the world would wither and die." Ramar nods slowly, "I shall do what I can to aid you, though in truth I am confused as to how I can best help. I do not know what I am to do here, though I am willing to ask, and to learn what I have to offer the Circle in this undertaking."

"Where there are willing hands a task can be found," says Gallius. "At least that is what I am told." She looks meaningful at Malis, who nods. "As I've always said," the warrior agrees. "If you are a good rider, you can join us on scouting runs. Provided you don't love your life too much, anyway. And you enjoy hard drink," says Gari. The rogue grins widely, carrying not a bit for the looks that Lady Yuri shoots towards him.

"If I am a good rider..." Ramar ponders this a moment, "It depends on how you define good, but I believe that my skills would be... sufficient." Ramar nods towards Gari, "Although I am confused as what you mean by 'hard drink'. Still, is there much else that may be done?"

Gai laughs, "You'll have to find out sometime." Lady Yuri sniffs at him and looks away. At this Gallius can only laugh, "Well, I don't think you'd be best used as a scout, Ramar. Once the time comes, I think I know exactly what I'd like you to do to help the cause. There are two airships known to be in Greyfalls. I want to own them both. Nobody can fly them better than you, I'd wager. And I know just what you can use to get up to them, too."

"And what is it that has you turning away so swiftly, Lady Yuri?" Ramar asks this, then nods to Gari, "If I may be of aid to you in the scouting, I believe I shall be." To Gallius he gives a grin, "Ah of course. I think that flying up there might work, though I must warn you, I shall need someone to help me... valiant though I may be, I don't think I could handle a skyship full of Dragon Bloods on my own."

"If I guess right, Ramar, they will not be able to afford to put so many up there," says Gallius. "They seem to use those ships for scouting, and they seem to also fear nothing in the air. I was thinking that we might find a way to deal with those ships so they are blind. If we take both, it must happen very swiftly, else they will defend them much better." The Lady looks to the sky, "We must use the element of surprise to strip this away from them."

"Perhaps. Though I am simply cautioning that I am not the most capable of fighters, should things come to it. But yes, if we move swiftly, we can gain the advantage of surprise and control the ships..." Ramar grins at the thought, "It will be dangerous though..."

"Everything worth doing in battle tends to be," says Gallius. "But it will shock the forces of Greyfalls into a new awareness. I hope it puts a dent in their will to fight. We need them to surrender after they lose on the field."
