The camp fires are bright still, morning still far away. Gallius prepares herself for rest, setting aside her things carefully and slipping out of her armor. She looks over to her small table, moving over to it and setting herself down. It is covered by a carefully detailed map of Greyfalls and the surrounding area, bits of stone marking this or that legion. "So many lives to save or lose," she whispers to the night air.

The moon rides high in the night sky, and though it is a cloudy night, the fires serve to illuminate the camps and the town. The soft murmuring of idle, weary, and worried men flows softly upon the breeze. Bearing these words, these worries in his mind, Ramar knocks on Gallius' door. "I hope I'm not disturbing you," he calls.

Gallius pauses, just about to blow out the candle that illuminates her room. "No, no, come in, Ramar." She turns to pick-up a cloak, drawing it about her body.

Ramar waits several seconds before opening the door, making sure to knock once more as it squeals it's protest in being opened on dried hinges. "Thank you," he says, stepping into the room at last. He shuts the door behind him, and pauses, as his gaze falls over the map of Greyfalls, "Ah, were you planning something, Lady?"

"Nothing new, Ramar," answers Gallius. "I can't come up with any better plans, I'm afraid. It seems the time now is to be spent waiting and watching. I hope only to find a way to make the battle short and the pain of it as small as possible." She settles herself on her bed, leaving one of the two chairs in the room to Ramar. "Was there something I could help you with?"

"Er, yes, although if you are having trouble coming up with plans... perhaps my question will be in vain. I'm wondering how best to help the efforts now, actually. I cannot help but feel as though I should be doing more, yet I cannot think of what more there is I can do. Laying Siege to a city is a new experience for me, as is battle on this scale. I do not wish to attempt something that would be detrimental to ongoing plans... but I want to do something." Ramar remains standing, explaining his concern, rather sheepishly.

Gallius smiles, laughing softly. There is a strange change that comes to her when the armor and weapon is set aside. She looks less imposing, perhaps, as she sits on the bed in a shift concealed mostly by the cloak she's drawn about her. Appearances perhaps are deceiving, though. "There are many things you might do, Ramar. I would like to see the weapons against us disabled. Unless I am mistaken, this is a purpose you are pursuing, is it not? That is a very worthy task."

"Yes, though Chi-Yosh and I believe it is best to wait on this task, until just before the charge on Greyfalls, lest they have time to react to their sudden loss of ammunition and defenses. We have two weeks until that time, yes?" Ramar, well, he's not a terribly imposing figure, but he does note Gallius' change in appearance. A smile, "I simply seek to help, however I might."

Gallius nods, "We have time. And we will need much help. That choice is a good one, though it is also a very dangerous time to be in the city. I hope you will take care of yourselves. I do not wish to lose my friends in this battle." She studies Ramar's face for a time, nodding at some unspoken thought. "So you have two weeks and are curious about aiding the army. I don't think I can turn you into a cavalry officer in so short a time, but there are other ways to help. Do you think you can operate a warstrider?"

"A cavalry officer? The lady flatters me. I am no soldier, no strategist... at least not yet." Ramar raises a curious brow at Gallius' nod, but leaves his question unasked at present. "If it can be piloted, sailed, ridden, driven, operated... or even if it cannott or is not meant to... I can do it anyway. Yes. Why do you ask?"

Gallius smiles, "I ask because we have two airships and access to the warstriders that were captured in the last battle. It would seem that if you are skilled in these areas that is where you might help most. I mean to put these things to good use. I imagine the Realm has only a few left to oppose us, now, and they must be very careful with them." The lady shifts slightly on her bed, adding casually, "Few are born to be soldiers, most have it thrust upon them. If you are skilled with a horse you could help train scouts and messengers, as well. I will have need of them, and they will have difficult tasks."

"And now I am to be teacher, scout, messenger, and pilot." Ramar grins, "It seems that with each minute that passes, I acquire yet another task. Perhaps, if I stay here long enough, I shall go out to fight the battle single-handedly, return to prepare the victory feast, and consume it..." Ramar grins, "Or, perhaps, you can tell me what your messengers and scouts would do, I might attempt one of those tasks, or perhaps, something with one of the Warstriders, though I do not know how to best utilize one... not yet anyway."

"All these things can be done in time," answers Gallius. "As for the warstrider, I am unsure how best to use it. I know I wish to speak to Davron about using them to aid in the construction of a very large siege weapon. If we succeed, this battle may end very swiftly. The messengers are not an immediate concern, but a preparation for the future. Our time scouting and stalking about Greyfalls has nearly ended. It is the next time I would prepare against."

"Very well then. In time, they shall be done." Ramar pauses a moment, looking almost lost in thought. Or simply lost. "There are three who can pilot the Warstriders, yet two that we can power at present. Ah well, I may think of something in that regard later. What plans are going in effect now?" There is a touch of worry at the mention of a large siege weapon, however. This touch begins to grow, "A large siege weapon? Forgive me, Lady, but I do not understand how that will end the battle swiftly..."

"Have you ever stared certain death in the face, Ramar?" asks Gallius quietly.

"Yes. And lived. Or died, depending on how you look at things. Moreso now that I've been gifted..." Ramar looks rather curious, "Why do you ask?"

"I ask because if one is faced with it, they are far more likely to consider surrender," answers Gallius. "That is what the weapon is for. It need not even work well. It is a matter of banishing hope from the defenders. We are not merciless and they will know this. It is foolish to cast away your life when it is not necessary, don't you agree?"

"It all depends on the reason for casting away one's life. Yet I see what you are getting at. Hope is not easily crushed, nor banished. I would point out... that the city of Greyfalls already has large siege weapons of their own, their own manner of certain doom for us... and what are we planning on doing regarding them?"

"I was planning that you and Chi-Yosh would help remove them," says Gallius. She grins, "Besides, this weapon, if made correctly, will fire from even greater distances than their defenses can counter. I will have it crafted and painted in black and used first at night to attack the city. That way they will be hard-pressed to have any idea where the shot is coming from."

"Forgive me, Lady Gallius, I have chosen my words poorly... I meant to say that, simply because such a thing exists, and can inspire fear, does not mean it will defeat the hopes of all men, and foster surrender." Ramar ponders thoughtfully, "Consider it this way... if we were faced with such a weapon, would you surrender to those wielding it? What would _you_ have done Lady? I would think myself a greater fool than I am, if I should suggest that there is no one of a heroic mind and heart within the walls of Greyfalls..."

Ramar says, "And what is being done now... we are sending two fools, insufferable, incorrigable, and, if I might add, devilishly handsome fools, to destroy their weapons... yes?"

"Indeed," says Gallius, pausing to consider her words. "Would we surrender? No, but we might flee, if the odds were totally against us. I would say that the situation differs for the Chosen, however. The dragon bloods may well stand their ground, but their mortal allies may well think better of the battle and trust to the ones who protect their families."

"Then perhaps, if and when this weapon is built, we should expect the Terrestrial Exalted to attempt to do what Chi-Yosh and I are doing?" Ramar considers this carefully, "Indeed. We might even gain another use of it, a trap for those who would attempt to dismantle it, perhaps even to lure them to work with us, eventually. I cannot say for certain that Chi-Yosh and myself do not walk into one when we go through the tunnels... and yet... the faith of mortals might indeed be swayed. It might take more than one seemingly unstoppable weapon though... it is best to not keep all of your wells dug near one stream. Lest it dry up, if you take my meaning..."

"This is but one trick of many that I plan to use," says Gallius. "Over the next two weeks my men will again and again seek to offer little surprises to the defenders, forcing them to stand alertly against a major attack that will not come. I plan to exhaust them so that they cannot fight when the assault truly comes." Gallius asks suddenly, "Ramar, what do you think of royalty?"

"What other little tricks and surprises do you seek to offer them? Perhaps I may be of assistance there as well... though, if they are exhausted..." Ramar blinks, at the sudden turn of conversation. "I'm not sure I understand what you mean, Lady? Do you mean to ask what my thoughts about those considered royalty are? What do I think of the idea of royalty? I would answer, but I do not wish to answer a question you were not asking."

"A little of all those questions, Ramar. Of the idea, of the people who have been royalty." Gallius obviously has a very serious interest in this, due to her own lineage. "And the tricks I plan to use mostly center on making the enemy run about their city, thinking that we are attacking. The plan is to make a small group of men appear like an army, which will draw a hasty response."

"Ah, I see. It is a difficult question you put to me, Lady. You know as well as I the history of those who have been royalty, their history is not so much different than that of those who are not. There are people who are good, and people who are bad, people who use their lineage for the boon of others, while others lord their power over all who refuse to give them their obeisance. Giving a straight answer is hard, though I will attempt it, if you truly wish an answer out of me. Before I give my answer though, I must wonder... why ask me?" Ramar smiles, curiously at Gallius, "You can't possibly be wondering for your own sake..." As she moves on to speak of tricks, "Ah, you wish to harry their troops... sensible, I suppose."

"Anything to leave them tired and full of doubt. If they are not prepared when the attack finally comes, they may be captured rather than killed, which is my hope." Gallius lets out a soft sigh, "Ramar, I was told by Lord Helios that we were chosen because we will do what is right. He seemed to indicate that we should trust our instincts, that they would be right, even if they seemed foolish. My instincts tell me that the rulers of men are by and large unfit and fickle, and they require someone to force them to heed their people. They need to be put to task, for royalty is only worth having if they protect their charges and lead them justly."

Ramar smiles softly, sadly almost, "Ah, so this is why you wish to know my thoughts, to help ease your mind for thinking what it is you think?" He shakes his head, "I will do what I can to allay your fears, though I feel differently than you do. It is perhaps merely a dream, but I believe that there are strong and capable leaders out there. There are those who simply need guiding, or to be shown a path that they might create for themselves... there are those who require force, or a new insight, and there are those unfit to rule. Yet others, perhaps not. I cannot know the hearts of all those who live within the world, but I have faith in those who do. I must. For I am one of them. As are you, Lady Gallius."

"I am one of them, and I have ascended by the will of the Unconquered Sun himself. Now I feel I stand above thrones and those who sit upon them in this world, for my service belongs to the highest King of all," says Gallius. "If I understand it rightly, he has selected me to remind the kings and queens of this realm that the heavens still are greater than they are."

"Perhaps. We have all been given a gift. As I have said, what you will do with it is your own decision. No Mandate from Heaven, no 'orders' other than 'make the world better' or not even that. Simply 'live your life'. At least that is how I see it. I may in fact be wrong. It would not be the first time you know, and it likely will not be the last." Ramar smiles softly, his head tilting. "Though I have to wonder, why is it you feel you stand above the thrones and peoples of this world? It is as though we are more mortal than any other, and yet at the same time... not... if I am making any sense?"

Gallius pauses to choose her words carefully. "We stand above the thrones of the world because we answer first to those who dwell in the heavens. And we stand below the meanest slave because our duty to mortals requires our utter dedication." She goes on, "My life is not what it was, I do not think I am destined to be just Queen of Roleyn. I am a soul of duty and honor, and therefore there is much I must do, I cannot serve but one people."

Ramar nods, carefully considering Gallius' words. "I see. That makes a good deal more sense than I could hope to make, I think. And I begin to understand what it is that drives your actions. No one's life is the same after this, it cannot be, this too, I understand." Ramar smiles, "What would you do, if all the power in the world were at your disposal?"

"I hope that never comes to pass, Ramar," answers Gallius. "That much power would destroy me, in the end. However, if I could, I would reduce the Realm to one state among a brotherhood of nations, where each carefully tends the world with a new understanding. If one country draws to itself too much power, it eventually will become the enemy of all others, who rightfully fear for their safety. This lesson I want to make clear. Too much power in one set of hands eventually destroys the very ones who would claim it. If only this were known, we would not have the problems we see now. The world is broken, Ramar. I want to help the people fix it."

"Would it? I would not know. I do not really wish power for myself, but it is an interesting thing to think about. To know what each person would do." Ramar ponders Gallius' solution, the brotherhood of nations. A smile spreads on is features, "I too, wish to help the people to fix the world... but what of the time after the world has been fixed? What shall be done then?"

"Ramar, such a long time shall stand between now and then," says Gallius, "That I do not think it shall be our duty to decide such things. Forging such a world shall be enough, then we will trust to the will of Helios and the good that lies in all things to maintain what we have begun." She lets out a sigh, "If I should live so long I shall wish only for rest. The world and its worries already weigh upon me so."

"As they do on me." Ramar bows his head, and chuckles ruefully, "Now I fear I may have a worry to add, but I believe I have a solution in mind for it. I will need your help though."

"What do you wish of me, Ramar?" asks Gallius calmly. "If it can be done along with the other tasks I have, I will see to it."

Ramar replies, "It can be done. It is merely a matter of ensuring that the Abyssals do not gain an ally out of either the Realm or the Nuri. Greyfalls will be in disarray for a time... I think. I am worried that they will use this to try to gain an ally, a friend, in the Scavenger lands. Rather than a Shadowland. Friends are in short supply for both the Realm and the Deathknights."

"I have a plan already in place for the Nuri. It is difficult and dangerous, but I think it will help them," says Gallius. "And I rather doubt any would be stupid enough to ally with those who wish to see every living thing dead."

"Gallius," responds Ramar, "They may wish to do so, but they are civil nonetheless. The promise of reinforcements, of aid, of humanitarian assistance and medical supplies is an easy thing to accept. And if all someone asked in return was friendship and civility... it might not be easy to refuse such an offer... the Deathlords are evil, at least to me, but they are a cunning foe."

"So many evils in this world," muses Gallius. "Just once I wish we could destroy one of them for all time. I am uncertain it is even possible with the Fair Folk and the Deathlords, however. There are other, better friends. Any ally of the Deathlords is committing treason against all life." She narrows her eyes, "We must find these slaves of darkness and destroy them. That is the only way to stop them, I think."

Ramar smiles softly, "Not all enemies need to be destroyed, not every villain can be slain. Were we to try now, it would end in our doom. We can undermine their plans, I think, by offering those who would ally with the dark ones something more. A chance at life and light. If you think such a thing is possible." He speaks, rather warily, "It is too easy to be consumed by hatred, or a desire to destroy... and doing so makes us no better than they. We must be mindful of this."

"The Deathlords and their slaves are not going to negotiate with us, Ramar. We can for now simply undermine their plans, but we cannot allow ourselves to think that what they have done already can be so easily forgiven," answers Gallius. "The murders, the destruction, these things all done so all might die and become slaves in their forces. They have twisted much of creation and justice will be done upon them."

"They probably will negotiate with us. Or try to. That is the scary thing." Ramar shudders at the thought, "In any case, I thought it worth mentioning what this Stormclouds at Dusk might be up to, in the coming days." He sighs, "We can worry about things other than that later." Ramar pauses a moment, "Is there anything else you can think of that I might help with in the days before the battle?"

"Disabling whatever defenses can be reached will be a good beginning. I also have a plan that may bear fruit, but it will have to wait until I can speak with Davron." The Lady sighs softly and stretches, "But for now, I think it may well be time for us to rest. I must wake an hour before dawn to begin inspections, and I imagine there will be a need for help with the orphans, not to mention the thousand other details that Marina had been handling that are now mine to see to."

"I offer my aid in this matter then. While I may not be Marina, I do have some skill in managing things." Ramar manages to say that with a straight face, "If you trust me with those details, that is." A nod of the head, "I hope I am not keeping you up terribly later than you wish, Lady, it just seems as though you're so busy these days..."
