Night has fallen on Greyfalls. As the city waits, preparing for the battle that is sure to come, the night-darkened forms of two Solars, creeping along the edges of a cavern entrance, somewhere in the distance can be seen. They slip inside, disappearing from the surface world without notice. Slowly, silently they make their way down the tunnels. Chi-Yosh reminds Ramar, "Remember, we are not to kill any of them, we promised the Magistrate." Ramar nods, "Indeed. I shall not. Let's go then."

The tunnels themselves twist and turn within the Earth, and every now and again a breeze wafts in from the surface and through the tunnels, filling them with the breath of the world. Ramar and Chi-Yosh creep down the labrynthine network of caverns, following the paths they know to lead to the city itself. Twice they duck past stalactites that shatter, the last remnants of a once deadly series of traps set to catch the unwary. After a few minutes of skulking about in the caverns, of every sound being dampened, echoed or muted by rock, they come upon a place that simply sounds different; they have found one of the old passageways leading up to Greyfalls.

The two Solars ascend, leaving the depths of the tunnels and entering the city of Greyfalls. The first thing to greet them is the soft meow of a small grey tabby, which rubs past both Solar's legs, before darting into a nearby building. Ramar and Chi-Yosh follow, and Rabby, now no longer the kitty, explains the movements of the Guards, and the best paths to reach the cannons. "You know," she muses, "If this plan goes off without a hitch..." There's just something unnerving about that Lunar smile, as Rabby turns and leaves. "Now be careful, it wouldn't do to get caught before we even get there..."

The clouds have gathered around the moon, cloaking its light and subsequently the movements of the Solars and Lunar as the three head towards the cannons. Two patrols are evaded, before at last the cannons are nearby, and the ammo-stores and bunkers lay in wait, blissfully unaware of the destiny about to be fulfilled. Slowly, the three creep towards the bunkers, Rabby taking the lead as once more she becomes the tiny tabby, out wandering around innocently enough, in search of a mouse to hunt, or a saucer of milk from one of the nearby bunkers...

The bunker hiding one of Greyfall's twelve guns is filled with three anxious men. The war is upon them, and soon the mighty weapons will scream their anger. Silence is broken as a grey tabby struts itself into the room, rubbing against the shin of one man. He shoos it with his foot. Annoyed, the tabby wanders to another, who scoops it up. "Hello." In moments his arms are filled with a smiling woman. "Hello." The shocked expression is wiped from his face when her fist connects with his temple.

Chi-Yosh grips the top of the door, swinging in to kick one of the soldiers into the wall, while Ramar reaches through a window, clapping a hand across the remaining gunner's mouth and bringing a sap around the side of his head. The trio move quickly: While Rabby binds the guards, Ramar runs an oil-soaked rope into a hole in the bunker's corner containing the ammunition. Chi-Yosh opens the cannon, smearing a red, viscus fluid across the rim of the cannon door. Finishing quickly, the bound guards are dragged out of the bunker, into the shadows looming beside.

Repeating the process once without a problem, the third time is not a charm. One of the soldiers rings an ammunition bell, ment to call for a reload, but the sudden eruption of sound sends guards in a flurry. As booted feet charge across the wall, Chi-Yosh slams the cannon door on the vial, shattering it and leaving the contents to spill in and along the door rim. Ramar lights a torch while Rabby hauls the gunners out. "Go!" screams Chi-Yosh. Lighting the rope, Ramar and Rabby haul out of the bunker, Chi-Yosh in tow with kamas at the ready. Moments later, fire erupts from the door and windows of the bunker, breaking the ranks of the onrushing squad.

The second rope is lit as Ramar passes before Rabby takes the lit torch, pushing a pair of coiled ropes into Ramar's hands. She runs ahead while the Eclipse stays, dropping one coil to spin the rope above his head, hurling the grappling hook on the edge of the wall. Chi-Yosh stops before the second bunker, weapons flashing and parrying swords, knocking a few guards over the wall into the city, falling upon the slanted roof of a building below and rolling to the ground. The second bunker explodes, sending the soldiers for cover while Chi-Yosh rushes back to Ramar. The Eclipse, securing a second grappling hook, leaps off the edge and begins repelling downwards. Chi-Yosh takes up the second cord, glancing towards Rabby and nodding before following suit.

Guards on both sides of the wall charge towards Rabby. The Lunar turns, hurling the torch through the bunker door and into the ammunition hole before leaping off the wall. The final bunker roars in flame as her arms spread, body flowing into the form of a hawk. She soars out into the night, swooping over the heads of the two decending Solars before they drop the few last feet to the ground.

Life in the camps is slowly stabilizing. Now that Marina is back, she's right back in the thick of things. Better yet, she can use the new contacts she made to seek out new sources of food.

Food, the fuel that keeps the camps turning over comfortably. With enough food, the squabbles stay reasonably measured. Too much food, and everyone becomes bored and lazy; not enough, and the lean, hungry crowds beging to fight for the scraps. Here waking moments are divided by the needs of the camp wide larders, and the need to keep the camp reasonably clean.

Still, compared to the two weeks of talk she's just endured, the problems here are fresh, and cathartic. Here, she can make a difference, arranging things so that they **work**. She's not a king, or a mayor, or a prince. She knows, full well, her position is temporary. Nonetheless, this is the best kind of mediation; the kind where she sits at the table, rather than bringing the petitions.

Rumor among the refugees has spread like a plague; some say that an army of the dead marches on the city, while others whisper of the destruction of the city's leaders via dark magic. The apparent death of Alcis, and the fluctuations in available food and water, have fueled no end of wild speculation about conditions inside and around the city.

---

Gallius arranges another airship ride, this time with a much lighter ship than before. She leaves most of the jade behind, but takes enough to strike a deal, and to build something in the future.

When Gallius finds the camp of the mercenaries she first takes a few turns about it, so she might determine just how skilled these men and women are. This naturally gains attention, which is of course part of the goal. Seeing that the men demonstrate some military discipline in the way they pitch a camp, Gallius moves down to make her offer.

Gallius has no bones about making clear who is in charge here. In such situations, it is simple. The one with the money is in charge. Her offer is a simple one. Those who wish to leave now can divide one tenth of what they were to be paid. Those who would be paid more can march under her leadership, swearing an oath to follow her orders and obey her laws. How many should come or go matters little to her at this point. All that matters now is that they will not be causing any trouble.

Consideration is given to this offer, but one force greater than that of money or influence prevails at last: the people of Nexus are for Nexus, and all that it represents. They suspect what has happened, clearly enough, but will not yet act - the Guild may yet come through with payment, and it would be an insult to one of the most powerful factions within Nexus to march under the banner of its enemy. They will undertake the journey back home for the offered price, with this to say - "When this war is over, if you still need men, and have silver, come see us."

Gallius nods to the men, smiling to herself. She will let them go as they will, leaving the jade behind. She has no doubt that they will honor the agreement, but she also has no time to waste. She will let them disperse and return to see to her own troubles, now. It is never so easy to gather a loyal force as one would hope, it seems. Yet she is not surprised nor disappointed as she returns to preparations.

---

Gallius enters the inn that is now the source of control of the madness that is the city. "As expected, I return without any additional aid," she says simply. She wastes no time over it, moving to look at the map again. "We'll be starting soon, now, I think. The time will not get any better. Further waiting only means Greyfalls has a better chance for reinforcements, and that would prove fatal for us all."

Davron nods to Gallius. "They accepted the token payment, then?" he comments. "I'm glad to hear that. Supplies for the refugees are getting tight here, and a little silver could go a long way toward easing tensions."

"Alright then Gallius. I suppose that if we must, we must. I take it that at least the mercenaries have agreed to leave? Or do we still need to contend with them?" Ramar, considers his words carefully. He leans back to take stock of the situation, before asking, "What shall we do with our leftover silver... I think we could quite easily accomplish what Davron says, and a sizable chunk of the silver could go towards repairing the damage we are soon to be doing... and in some cases have already done."

"Do not forget about the Dam," reminds Chi-Yosh. "Even as it has been reinforced, it can only stand so long." After a second, he smiles almost innocently. "Let us purchase all of the refugees some alcohol. That shall make them content for the time being?"

"They will leave, they have given their word. Mercenaries who do not keep their word do not last long in any land, so trust the issue to be handled," says Gallius. "As for leftover funds.. I wouldn't worry, I will count us lucky to not delve deeply into debt." As she speaks, the door to the inn opens and Malis strides in, stopping to offer a bow to the solars before saying to Gallius, "The glove falls by night, my Lady." In response, the lady just nods.

Marina snorts at Chi-Yosh. "The silver will feed the refugees. Drunks do not make for a quiet camp." She sighs. _Now if only the silver would be paying us ..._

"So what does the glove falling by night mean, Lady Gallius?" Ramar leans back into his chair, folding his legs beneath him, so that he's cross-legged on his chair. "I am lead to believe it is some kind of coded message, though I cannot as of yet ascertain it's meaning or your response."

Yuri turns from her work to consider Malis for a time, then she simply sighs, knowing well that a siege is not what Roleyn is good for. The charge and the plain, not the wall and the ladder. Gallius says to Malis, "Have Gari send out the scouts, let them know that it shall be tomorrow. Raise the camp in the gentle way that you have." At this she smirks and Malis laughs. His gentle way being to kick any man who doesn't rise swiftly. Her attention turns to Ramar, "It means tomorrow night many men who breathe now will have no further need of horse nor air, my friend. I only hope our preparation prevents my people from facing a great loss." To Malis she says quickly, "Tell Gari to loose bows. War is upon us."

Malis bows deeply and departs, pausing only to reach out and clash one of Lady Yuri's hands. He manages an easy smile that for a moment banishes his harsh look and steps out into the chill. Within moments his booming voice can be heard, though the words are muddled by the noisy village.

"Then it is at last time. This day is one I do not think we shall forget soon. What is our plan? How do I fit into it?" Ramar pauses, letting the questions sink in. "Should we be leaving now then?"

As the soldiers camped outside the village start to get the news of action (at last!) The refugees murmur can already be heard in the headquarters. The outcome of the battle is much in doubt, and many believe that there can be no good outcome, now. Gallius raises an eyebrow at Ramar, "Well, I believe you already played a major part in this. Many of the defenses are disabled now. We shall attack at a few points, but our concentration shall be the openings the city must block. The door will likely be hammered down by warstriders and where once there was a river there will be a great press of men. Along the walls our assault shall rain shot at the defenders and ladders will be made ready, and hooks shall be cast."

Davron nods. "In that case, I must see to the final details of our project, Lady Gallius. All is now complete, but I would run some final tests, lest there be a fatal mishap on the eve of battle." He grins. "And I think I might be able to make some last-minute improvements on the range..."

"All shall begin moving in a few hours, Davron. I wish to open up on them before dawn comes. Let's keep them awake a few extra hours before our friends have to begin throwing themselves at the walls," replies Gallius.

"And what of me, Gallius? What part shall I play in the battle that is coming?" Ramar sounds curious, and even a little... scared? Perhaps it's merely anticipation. Or anxiousness. "Am I to pilot a warstrider, airship, or Volo? Am I to fight alongside of our soldiers? I can and most certainly will do all of these things if necessary..."

Marina grins at Ramar. "You don't belong in the medical tents, patching up the soldiers so they can return to the battle?" She pauses. "I imagine I'll be in the camp, protecting the refugees ..."

To Ramar, Gallius says, "We have a bit of fire dust in an airship. It would be most fortuitous if it were to find itself by the main gate. I'm thinking with a volo you might be able to deliver it. Does this sound like something you can do? Destroying a door might be easier for you than destroying men. My friends.. have any of you been in a war before?"

"I do not know enough to assist properly in the medical tents, so you are correct, I do not belong there," replies Ramar. "Hmmm." A slightly worried look crosses his face, "I hope there is no truth to the rumor of an army of the dead marching on Greyfalls..." He considers Gallius, "I have not yet been in a war, not in this sense of the word, at least."

"Only once," Davron says, his normally cheerful features darkening gloomily. "And not nearly so great a conflict as this."

Chi-Yosh is moving back and forth. A rare occurance, he's anxious. Eyes trace the well-worn map of Greyfalls that has been sprawled across the table for the weeks. The cannons that have been blown are marked on the map, and he can imagine the siege engines and ladders. A glance up. He might be better in the medical tents, but his place is on the lines, in the battle with the Dragon Blooded.

"Perhaps the hardest part about war is that you find yourself forced to kill people who are doing nothing wrong. The men we face are unlikely to be evil," says Gallius. "They will be defending the people and the homes they love. They can not be expected to know that we wish them to live free. If we were in their place, I imagine our fate would be much like theirs." She shakes her head at the mention of a dead army, "If it is, it is. We will face any army that challenges our duty."

Davron nods glumly to Gallius. "May the gods be with them, then. And may Gaia welcome them into her arms."

"We must still be wary of Stormclouds at Dusk," Says Chi-Yosh. "He is still here, and even having made peace with Alcis, may yet try to claim Greyfalls at the most crucial moment." Looking to Davron, "It is a shame we have nothing on hand to communicate to one another with. It would make the battle much easier if we could coordinate in case of such an emergency. Otherwise, we are alone in a sea of war."

Davron nods to Chi-Yosh. "Such sorceries exist, but alas I have yet to learn their secrets. You can rest assured that I will, though, as soon as the opportunity arises. This may be my first war, but my heart forbodes that it will not be my last."

"Gaia will, Davron," Gallius answers. "The worthy and righteous shall be welcomed to her side. We need not worry about that. Thankfully the judgement after life has ended is not our burden to bear, but we know some of it already."

"Someone mention Gaia?" calls a voice from the kitchen of the inn. It sounds like Non Valon. It looks like him too, once the Lunar emerges, waving. Where he came from or how he got in is a mystery.

"Then we shall be wary, and we shall fight, and live and die today. I shall do what I can." Ramar smiles, sadly, standing. He looks down towards the map, eyes wandering over it as though he were walking the fields themselves. For a moment he hears the clash of steel and feels the rush of a windswept battlefield, a plan begins to form, and then he is brought out of his revelry by Non Valon. "Ah, hello there. I was wondering when you were going to show up. Welcome to the war room, such as it is."

Gallius stretches, looking seriously at Non Valon. She opens her mouth to speak, but as Ramar speaks first, she falls silent, turning back to her battle plan one more time. It's clear to those that know Gallius best that there is still something in the plan that she doesn't quite like.

"I heard things were about to move, so I came to find out when the attack was," smiles Valon. "But it seems sort of somber in here. Perhaps I'll come back later?"

Chi-Yosh's head perks upwards as the Lunar enters the room. "Greetings, Non Valon. It is good to have you here." With the new arrival, the Su'Katan's lungs are cleared of the gloom permeating the air. "Your war strider must be hiding somewhere close by?"

Valon pats a pocket. "Got it right here."

Davron quirks an eyebrow, grinning at Valon. "Hiding closer than I'd ever have imagined, then. As always, you're full of surprises."

"Full of something?" Chi-Yosh quips back with a smile. "Has Weeping Prowler come to join as well, or is he still to sulk in the crystal palace?"

The Lunar nods slowly, rubbing his chin with two fingers and a thumb. "I had a discussion with Prowler, and his closing suggestion for where I should put it was quite impractical. So I think I can't count on him helping out, but I think there's a good reason for it."

"Can any of your cousins tell us if the Abyssals are going to interfere further in our plans, Non Valon?" asks Gallius, her voice revealing a bit irritation and impatience.

"Indeed. Many things are not as they seem these days. I don't suppose that there's any others lurking around." Ramar looks around, half-expecting to encounter Goran and his Barbarians, he replies to Non Valon, "Well if you believe the reason to be good, that is enough for me, though curiosity will get the better of me before long. Changing moon and all. I don't suppose you've seen anything like a marching army of undead headed this way..."

"Army of the dead? Not that I've heard," the man replies, shaking his head. "Oh, I'm sorry," he adds, looking from face to face with a sardonic smile. "Should I go get one for you?"

Chi-Yosh shakes his head, saying glumly, "Sadly, I think we'll have a dead army or two to spare, soon."

"No that's quite alright. I think we can do without. With any luck we won't have enough to even begin one by the end of the day. We are preparing to leave, however." Ramar glances towards the camp, wherein the sounds of men readying for the battle that is certainly to come fill the once-peaceful air, tension building to the point where knives could be sharpened upon it.

Gallius turns away to look out over the camp. "All will be ready soon. It takes a while for hundreds of men to get moving, however. This is the last breath before the plunge. I'm going to go out." And she steps towards the door, where she stops to face Valon for a moment. A bow is offered, "You shall see your choice was not ill-made, Lord Non Valon," she says stiffly. The Lady's armor clearly goes on well before battle, and thus she heads out.

---

Davron's burnished brow still glows with the mark of Twilight as he straps himself into the volo, setting the hearthstone into the device's forehead. With a final check of his quiver, he takes to the air, soaring into the night sky above the massed ranks of the Confederation's army, the wind whistling past his anxious face.

At around 7 o'clock the attack begins. There is at first an element of stealth that is shattered when the first barrage is released. With a roar Gallius bursts alight, calling about herself a cloak of essence that lights her up brightly for archers, but also sets such a terror in them that their arrows go astray as she carefully moves forward. At 200 yards she cries out, "LOOSE!!" And the men following her begin to empty their quivers, sending up volley upon volley towards the walls as they break into a greater speed. The walls are not silent, however.

The lady's progress is noticed, and the defenses are well prepared (if tired.) They expect no quarter and show no signs of fear. Sporadically arrows are sent back at the charging forces and here and there a rider falls to be left behind. A bright light goes up on the walls of the fortress as a canon is fired against the charging exalt.

It is not unexpected, however. The lady charges on and with a growl she whirls out her spear in a defensive arch, her bright eyes glaring against the oncoming burst of fire. Without shifting at all she brings her spear to bear, catching the blast from the cannon and blocking it. For a moment she is lost utterly in a burst of light, but in moments she bursts again into sight, her voice rising over the din of battle. "On, on! We will show them the fire of Roleyn's Lioness!" cries Gallius, finally giving Jin-nu the sign that it is no longer worth holding back. The wylding bursts ahead of the cavalry then, moving as if they were all standing still as she hurls herself towards the castle. With a cry both horse and rider are vaulted up into the air and onto the wall, sending many defenders rolling off the other side in the process.

Above the battlefield, clouds have began to merge with the gathering smoke of weaponry and flame alike. Then they part to bare a streak of Essence-flamed Ivory, an angry angelic agent arcing straight downward. Gripped in the hands if a war-painted Su'Katan is a heavy keg of deadly powder, a fuse almost leading into the keg. At the last moment, arms go wide to deliver the destructive message while the winged beast itself swerves to crouch upon a gunnery bunker. From it leaps Chi-Yosh into the midst of wall defenders. The fierce explosion announces him, a red backdrop that casts his front in shadow. Yet his form is highlighted by the boiling curl of Essence, reflecting off his rising kamas. Some cower in fear, while others raise their blades in defiance. As the eruption dies from the sky, the Dawn is made clear to them, his Caste mark a beacon. And with that, they charge.

Like a ghost on the wind Chi-Yosh weaves through the wall's defenders, his weapons threshing the wheat of swords and spears, cleaving man from the wall, the battle, or from life. His body flows like the surging Essence swimming across his form, never where Mortal weapons seek, and every place where gaps in their defenses show. Arrows swarm like angry bees in the air around the Exalt as he moves within teh cluster, but they never hamper the Dawn, even the soaring stones and flaming pitch are raindrops that never wet his brow. Along the wall he goes, clearing the way for ladders and others who might come to join him.

Davron cannot miss the fireworks from his two compatriots, and he banks in a wide sweeping turn as he approaches the walls, now flying parallel to the formidable ramparts, at great speed, defying the marksmanship of the opposing archers. As he nears the brilliant flare that is Lady Gallius, he checks his pace and delivers a withering barrage of arrows to a knot of defenders attempting to throw down a siege ladder, then shoots straight up and backward, hardly blinking as the enemy's arrows plink off his bronze skin.

One of the airships, the now rechristened _Cloudy Sea_ sails high above the battlefield, the inky blackness of the night sky clouding it from the view of those fighting down below. Ramar's sword is drawn as he takes the helm, his armor now worn visibly, Orichalcum having a dull sheen to it as the ship descends through the darkness. "Pick up your swords, for now is the hour we are called upon to fight. It is the hour of war, the hour of fate. Our own fate lies below and we shall rush out to greet it with steel and with fire! Let us give them a fight to sing for, to remember in days yet to come, when those who we fight for today, shall weep and remember that we fought here, that they might live in the peace and the freedom that shall be theirs; that they might never have to see the woes of battle we go now to face. Prepare yourselves, for Now, at last, it is our hour. Let us show them why."

With that, the _Cloudy Sea_ sails over the field of battle, skimming low over the ground as it rushes in along the flanks of the city, darting effortlessly over the walls to join with the troops already fighting. At Ramar's cry, those troops aboard the ship snatch up their swords and their spears, and their shields just as the ship sinks lower. Three swing down from Ramar's ship, sending the enemy soldiers flying backwards as they land, weapons flashing as they move to join their comrades in arms. Now the ship sails across the skies, more soldiers swinging off of its bow as Ramar pilots it near one of the Realm's inner defenses. Soon after, the cries of men fighting and dying can be heard, as they join the tide of Roleyn's troops.

---

Well behind the Confederation's lines, Davron looks up at the monstrous trebuchet with one last quiver of apprehension, then back at the men operating the device, as he picks up a fresh quiverful of arrows. "After you fire," he is saying, "I'll note the spot where it lands and fire a single flare for short, double flare for long, triple flare for a hit. The winds are pretty low over Greyfalls right now, so I doubt we'll need to compensate much for it, but if they pick up, the initial aiming arrow should tell you where it is blowing." He nods. "Good luck," he says, taking to the air once more and heading for the thick of the battle.

Back at the walls, Davron tracks a flying boulder back to the catapult mounted on the inner walls. Hovering over it, he ignores as best he can the arrows dashing themselves against his metal hide, firing an arrow straight up into the air. It bursts into bright flame, lighting the ground below it, and he swoops away to watch. Many seconds later, a massive stone swoops through the air, crashing to the ground several dozen yards short of the mark. Two simultaneous flare arrows arc into the night sky, and seconds later a second boulder smashes the catapult into flinders, sending the crew scattering. Nodding in satisfaction, Davron swoops away to the next target.

Fighting for this long would wear down even the greatest of warriors. For this reason Gallius is more than just pleased to see Chi-Yosh's glowing form as the two meet atop the walls. But not all is well, for the lady sees one of his foes creeping behind him after playing dead. The figure reaches for a bow, but the Lady's draw is the faster, and with an audible thunk a black shaft is buried through the eye of the would be sniper. To Chi-Yosh Gallius says, "I saved your life!" She can't help but grin.

Chi-Yosh spots Gallius, carving his way meet the maiden. He sallutes her and her magnificent horned companion as he gets close enough to hear. A glance behind him at the felled man, but as he turns to thank the Roleyn-born, out flings his weapon, a spinning wheel that pierces the chest of a spear-wielding man aiming for Gallius's flank. "The debt is repaid!" Cries the Su'Katan.

Gallius turns to look at the man who falls lifeless at the attack of the Su'Katan. She shrugs at Jin-nu and laughs. "It's good to see you alive, Chi-Yosh," says the wylding, who turns to send a bone-shattering hoof into a Greyfalls warrior, causing the armored figure to take a flight. All about the wall, the efforts of the Solars is begin to prove telling, for here and there the defense is greatly thinned, leaving openings for those below to exploit, and places where the airship may safely set down more of the attackers.

Sheathing one of his weapons, Chi-Yosh laughs to Jin-nu. "The battle is not won yet. May Helios smile." With that, he dives over Jin-nu, grabbing the kama still stuck to the dead man, rolling to his feet with it in hand. The motion ends with barehandedly catching an incoming wrist, following through with the gesture to pin the swordswoman's arm back, her weapon tumbling. The hilt of the other kama brings her unconcious, before he simply rallies, "Onward!" He follows the path that Gallius had left, now starting to refill with the second wave.

The battle continues, men fighting and dying in scores. From above, it is as though the Sun is being reborn several times over. Light reaches for the sky, stretching, yearning, grasping at the starry void, dawn brought forth during the night, through the luminous auras now surrounding many of the soldiers. Twice more the airborne ship has sailed in, its passengers, and even its captain swinging in to do battle alongside of Roleyn's army. The sounds of steel clashing and crumpling echo through the city, the low wail of battle growing steadily as here Ramar and his troops drive back a countercharge, and now more clamber aboard the ship to aid their comrades being driven back through the breaches the warstriders have been hammering steadily throughout the night.

As the ship prepares to make yet another pass, its captain showing the signs of weariness and wounds-his blood mingles with that of his foes on his shirt and under his armor-the airship is rocked by a loud, and bright light plummeting down atop it. Three men fall to the ground before it's clear that a Dragonblood has made its way aboard the _Cloudy Sea_. He runs for Ramar, and the two go hurtling over the deck, bodies clanging against the metalic barrel of one of the larger cannons embedded in the city's walls. Slowly, Ramar and the Dragonblood, surrounded by an aura of flickering flame, rise and turn to face one another, weapons drawn.

Blades flash, sword to axe, though the Fireblooded Warrior is the more adept of the two, and it is not long before Ramar is scorched, wounded, and bloodied on the metallic surface. The laughter of the flames seems to grow brighter, as the Terrestrial Exalt moves in to finish his opponent. His axe is met then, by Ramar's blade, as the Solar looks into the Dragonblood's eyes, fighting through fire with a look of utter defiance...

With one last movement, Ramar dashes towards the end of the cannon, his feet staggering, struggling to keep his wounded, battered body upright, let alone alive. The axe bites deep, carving into Ramar's back just as he leaps, Essence and blood trailing behind him as he pushes off of the axe's head... his opponent cackles madly as Ramar flees, lesson learned, at a dear price... it is through gritted teeth that Ramar bears more troops into the battle.

---

The sound of Warstriders hammering at doors, walls, gates and other fixed obstructions is only one of the many ear-shattering noises that fill the night air. Valon in particular is making good progress, by destroying archways and streets where reinforcements could otherwise pour in and attack the invading army from behind. Overhead, Davron has been aiding the effort outside the walls, using flares to provide warnings about troop movements. It's during one particularly crucial moment, as the Greyfalls forces are organizing a sneak attack from the tunnels beneath the city, that Davron's low-altitude fly-by of a suspicious group of men moving reveals something that almost sends him spiralling into the ground from shock.

Consider an eye, surrounded by blackest night. The pupil contracts, crushed into near-nothingness by the green ring about it, recoiling from the terrible image held to it like a burning brand. Reflected, distorted by the sudden dilation, the face of a cousin can be seen. Willow, who was there on the day that angry voices and cries of "Demon!" laid bars on the gates of Davron's village, forever exiling him from the hearts of those he held dear. Willow, whose grimy and bloody face disappears suddenly as the train of slaves is jerked along by their Linowan captors, off into the darkness.

Absent any further direction from Davron's dazed mind, the volo's wings beat in a hovering pattern as the archer absorbs the implications of what he has just seen. He's startled out of his reverie, though, as an axe whirls out of the melee beneath him and pierces even his metallic flesh to lodge in his thigh. Stifling a cry of pain, he swoops up into the air, then, all thoughts of battle forgotten, he flies after the slave train below, tears of grief and rage running down his cheeks.
