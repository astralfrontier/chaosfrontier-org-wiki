Gallius spends well her time, but it seems to her that so much remains to be done, and she wants to show Greyfalls that her presence is a serious benefit. There is but one place she can turn for help, now. A message is sent to the Master and Gallius quietly hopes he will see the need and hasten. Her days now are spent aiding the healers and then helping repair buildings. She is no craftsman, but any hands seem welcome.

The Master is not long in arriving; one might even think he was expecting the summons well before it was sent. In fact, he plucks the hand-written note from a bemused scribe who was heading out the door of the Immaculate's compound, calmly unfolding it for inspection as he walks unconcernedly in. Finding Gallius without effort, he merely inclines his head politely.

Gallius smiles and bows to the sidereal. "I am glad you received my message," she says, laughing a little. "You seem to always know when to appear. I have many questions for you, but my curiousity can wait. I have a favor to ask of you. I am but a pair of hands, and here there is much suffering. There are many powerful enough to do what I cannot, and I wish to arrange an exchange. Assistance for assistance, so to speak."

"I see," says the taciturn seeming-merchant, nodding about him. "And? What would you do?"

"Whatever is required," answers Gallius. "My hands can also do things that many others cannot. I don't plan on relying on my station to get me through this. I must learn more of the spirits I would request aid from before I can say for certain. It seems to me they could come to like dwelling here with many grateful worshippers."

"That depends on the spirit," comments the Master, a bit gruffly. "If that is your offer, find a healing spirit in Creation - spirits of wood and water. Or call up a demon with the proper powers, and bind it to your service."

"I do not think I wish to meddle with the yozis and the lice that falls from them," answers Gallius. "I am not ready for that contest. I do not trust to that power which has maimed my kind so terribly. What would you suggest in treating with a greater spirit, then? I have only my hands to offer in truth and I wish to strengthen the bonds of heaven and earth. I deem it the duty of Solars to treat with the spirits of Yu-Shan, so I would get some practice now, and there is another reason.."

The Master considers this slowly. "We may go ask," he suggests. "The currents of destiny were interfered with from both sides. We may find something useful in that."

"That is a beginning," says Gallius. "But I would have another come with us, if she wishes. From her, as well, I have much to learn, but she must see something of the truth before she will trust me. Her name is Oaken Claw, and against the tide of the times I think there may be understanding in the heart of one I thought would be my enemy. Such victories are the most joyous, it seems to me."

The Master frowns, but after a few moments nods his head. "You will be responsible for her conduct while she is there. Do you understand?"

"I do," answers Gallius. She considers her mentor carefully, "You do not approve. I fear sometimes, however, I must abandon icy logic and trust to warmer powers. We must understand our way through these times as much as battle our way through them. The victory I would win cannot be achieved by arms alone." She turns and nods, "Let us find her, if you are willing. Else we can meet you on the edge of the city, if you wish to."

"I do not approve of rash action," corrects the dark-skinned man, calmly. "The laws of Yu-Shan extend no protection to the Terrestrial Exalted. Whoever accompanies them to Heaven must take responsibility for them. If you are prepared for this, I do not object. Again, I say: do you understand?"

"I do," repeats Gallius. "I think you will approve of Oaken Claw. I only hope she can spare a few hours for this journey." Gallius will lead the way through the halls towards the immaculate monk with her usual, measured pace.

Gallius comes upon Oaken Claw between tasks, as it were, intersecting her path in the halls. "Good day," she says to the monk. "I have a need of your aid. I know you have much to do in Greyfalls, but there may be something of even greater use we can achieve for the city than our four hands alone might prove capable of." Without waiting over-long, Gallius explains, "I wish for you to come with me on a short journey. We will not be away long. We will see much that may profit us both, and I need your aid in convincing a spirit to send blessings to the city. Where we will go, few of your kind ever come, and though in this world you may stand high above the spirits, there you must do no harm and support me as I try to convince them to serve this city. Will you help me?"

Oaken Claw frowns, a hand brushing at her verdant hair absently in thought. "This is a troublesome request," she says after a time of consideration. "To trust you is still a struggle. Allow me an hour to pray on the matter, and I will give you my answer?"

"We will await you at the edge of town, my friend, and together let us do what we can to save Greyfalls," says Gallius. The solar bows respectfully and turns away, doubting not at all that the woman she admires will come with her. "I have learned so much about them, Master," says Gallius as she winds her way out of the city. "They are not so different. They are noble, and love their kin, but they are also just as capable of wisdom as I am. And many of them are greater than I. I wish to learn all I can of them, for they hold a fragment of the truth I seek."

"They are lesser Exalted, shadows of the power of the true Celestials," comments the Master. "And yet in their martial arts, they rival the power of a Solar or Lunar. Their power is not innate, and their wisdom is limited. But at bottom, you are both empowered human beings. There are bound to be points of similarity."

"Lesser or no, they have value, and they are as worthy of love, friendship, and respect as we are," says Gallius. "And though much blood stands between us, I hope for peace. They have protected men well from the many dangers of the world, and for that I am grateful to them. Tell me, Master, if you can.. how did we fall? I need to know everything that is safe to know about this. I trust your judgement in this."

"The Solars were slain, at the height of their evil," says the Master. "The Dragon-Blooded aren't who truly protect the world, even now. They merely safeguard parts of it. If it is Yu-Shan that you wish to visit, I may be able to show you some part of that truth.." The Sidereal reflects for a moment. "Hubris, and lust for greater and greater power and domination, is what caused the downfall. But without the Solars, the entire world will fall."

"I wonder if I can protect myself from the same folly," murmurs Gallius. "I would not deliver the world into the hands of those who would do great harm to it. I do wish to see the truth, whatever it is you can safely reveal. Perhaps that will help, when my time comes."

After some hesitation, Gallius says, "When I first was changed, I thought I was stronger than anything, but I have learned and seen much. It seems to me that to each of those who are chosen there is a power to them. You mentioned martial arts of the dragon blooded. I have seen Chi-Yosh battle many times. Does this differ from their styles?"

"You saw, in the compound, the Wood-Aspected monks, taking wounds onto themselves, and then healing those wounds slowly?" asks the Master. "Do you know what it is that allows them to do it?"

"I only guess that it is the same wielding of essence that I know, but I have no understanding of its exact nature," says Gallius. "It is an impressive devotion, though, offering your own blood to save another. Do you mean to say that is somehow a product of their martial art?"

"The term 'martial art' is misleading, Gallius," explains the Mater, putting aside his cold demeanor for a moment, and explaining in a more fatherly fashion. "It is actually 'true art' or 'art of the self'. It is called a martial art only because that is the only aspect most people can see. Cultivation of the self is not outwardly visible, so no observer will name it. Nor will the cultivation of peace and harmony in dealings with others be remarked as a special skill, only a product of refinement and taste. The 'art of the self', when applied to defense or attack, though, is instantly recognizable as something special. And so it is named a 'martial art'. I'll try to explain the difference between that and your Charms, if you wish."

"I think it would help me better understand," says Gallius. She listens with interest, eager to learn whatever the Master is willing to teach.

The sage continues. "Your Charms are the use of your innate Essence - without aspect - used to magnify the 'realness' or 'truth' of your natural abilities. As a Solar Exalt, you command Essence to magnify your innate greatness. Whatever you are merely good at, you become superlative at. Whatever you excel at, you become peerless at. Your Charms are very different in function from mine - the use of Essence to manipulate Destiny. Nor are they like that man Valon's, who uses Essence to alter his body and reinforce his bestial nature. What are termed 'martial arts', or the Charms that fall under the heading of the 'art of the self', do not magnify - they emulate. When Chi-Yosh fights using the style of the Mantis, he is not merely making specific bodily motions. He is shaping his Essence to resemble that of the mantis itself. He becomes like a mantis, in many ways. All Creation is nothing but aspected Essence; Chi-Yosh, similarly, changes his nature to something else to gain its power."

Gallius' eyes slowly widen as she begins to understand. "So the art of the self allows one to step outside their very nature to become something else. So the aspect of wood is what Oaken Claw uses, and it has the power to preserve life at its own expense, even as the tree gives its life so that men may be protected from the elements about them." She considers this for a time, "And if that is true, there must be countless forms, and.." She pauses, thinking aloud, "And one who can alter there nature to become one thing should surely be able to learn to become another.."

"Of course. The Celestial martial arts are universal - a dedicated Solar could master the Immaculate styles, and far faster than a Terrestrial Exalt, since you do not have to spend years to learn to manipulate your Essence. It's a natural part of your heritage." The Master actually smiles. "To my knowledge there are twenty-five styles in Creation, or at least that is how many were practiced at one time."

"And as the Immaculates have treasured their styles and kept them hidden, I would guess that all Chosen have secrets in these arts," says Gallius. "Twenty five styles. Interesting. I will have to remember this." She considers for a moment and changes the subject, "What was it like before? Did the Solars march into Yu-Shan like kings and queens, pushing the spirits about as they willed?"

"At the height of their decadence, yes," the Master says, with hints of regret in his voice. "But before that, there was a productive interplay between the gods and the Exalted. Each commanded their own, and they cooperated so that the visible and spiritual worlds were in harmony."

"It seems to me that Solars should use their power in service, not in domination," says Gallius. "We are maimed, in a way, prone to turning evil. I fear the thought of the throne that still waits for me. If other chosen fell, I can, as well."

"All men are prone to turning evil, Gallius," observes the Master. "The Exalted have the power to make such a transformation worse, it is true."

"So I must tread with great care. I hope you will keep an eye on me. I may have some power, but I cannot protect myself against myself, I do not think." Gallius smiles and hmms, "Her hour is up. Soon we will have our answer. Her friendship could hasten the changes I wish for."

---

With Oaken Claw's assent, Gallius, the monk, and the Master all board one of the airships left beyond. The Master navigates and pilots, while the other two Exalts hold conversation. Oaken Claw has been introduced to the Master as "another of my kind", and this much has been accepted without much question. Finally the airship sets down in a wooded area, and the Master leads the way through a copse of evergreens, coming out into a wide ruin of stones with overgrown grass. At the center of the ruin is a wide artificial pond, and the Master begins chanting. The water glows bright, and grows brilliant as runes of fire burn themselves into its surface. Finally, at the height of the radiance of it, the Master commands, "step through!"

Again, Gallius finds herself on a four-pillared plate, apparently floating high in the heavens, and guarded by the Celestial Lions. Oaken Claw is there, as is the Master, and he steps forward, formally greeting the Lions. Again they recite their instructions, and Gallius remembers that only two months ago she passed these doors. Has so much changed in so short a time? The starry field parts into the doors to the City of Heaven, and the trio step through into brilliance.

As Gallius steps into the beauty of Yu-Shan, she senses more than hears the soft gasp of Oaken Claw as she gazes out at what could only be called the most perfect city.

As far as the eye can see spires rise like waves across an ocean of buildings. Here and there the eye catches focus, seeing one snowflake amongst a beautiful blizzard. Oaken Claw's eyes move over a building of leaping crystal, bubbling and jetting like a fountain, the structure towering above those around it, and then a sound like the very ocean catches her ear and she turns, confronting a work of art that stands above anything she has seen in the museums of her home. There stands a hall in the shape of a conch shell, emitting a sound that would resonate into the very depths of the ocean.

But even as she is marvelling at this wonder she hears the plink of falling water, and behold! there is a spire that winds about what surely appears like a stretched teardrop. It glistens and glows with a silver light, illuminating the seemingly narrow ribbon that winds towards its top. And yet there is more. More than an eye could take in where one to stand here as a statue for a thousand years. For there are other shells, and forms of living things, crafted with care to appear as leaping dolphins, or to stand in the shape of birds about to burst into flight. Though the city is not nearly so full as it could be, nothing seems decayed, for upon Yu-Shan there is no stain.

And though water seems here to rule, there are other things, as well. Standing not far to the eye (but very far for those who go on their feet) is a tree, surely as alive as anything in creation. Its bole is of massive girth, and its branches strong and yet graceful, their curves beautiful to see. The bark glistens with dew eternally, and the leaves are of jade, and upon their edges glints sunlight and on many small flowers on the boughs the softer light of the moon shines.

Oaken Claw stares from place to place, though it is clear her heart clings closest to that beautiful tree. She says softly, not even trying to disguise her wonder, "Is this real? Can we go to that tree?" Confronted with the paradise of Yu-Shan, her mind is still reeling. The calm of the monk is not shattered, it is enhanced by the loveliness she sees about her.

"Perhaps someday," answers Gallius. "But I fear that is not our errand now. This wondrous place is functional as well as beautiful. This is the home of many spirits, and here much of what is to pass below is decided. In Yu-Shan dwell many great powers, as well as many of those who still see to the smaller things that keep the world alive. But for your vigilance and the work of those who are here not much would be left. But come, let us go and find one who might be able to give us aid."

---

An 'aerial rikshaw' is how the Master describes the peculiar conveyance the three ride in. It is an egg-like flying vehicle, and Gallius gets uncomfortable associations with the egg-shaped craft of the Guild. Nevertheless the ride is cool and rapid, as the magic of the craft propels its passengers through the unending streets of Yu-Shan, along boulevards whose prodigious widths could and did accommodate the strides of giants beyond any sane limit of size. "We'll be reaching the Bureau of Destiny's outer offices soon," comments the Master. "I will speak with those inside. Gallius, Oaken Claw, follow me in after a half an hour, please. You will be directed appropriately." The craft comes to a stop soon enough before an ivy-covered building of purest jade, and the Master departs, walking confidently inside without a look backward.

In the half hour of free time, Gallius speaks softly with Oaken Claw. "When last I came here, it was for a business of a different sort. I hope we might come here for the festival together. I would think that you would like to see Gaia, and perhaps Luna, in her loveliness." She does not speak much of Helios, though the memory makes her grin. "Lord Helios is less remote than the others, I deem. He is like a father or an uncle, rather than a master. A captain rather than a emperor." She collects her thoughts for a moment, turning aside from her memories to speak her mind, "Perhaps this is rude, but I wonder.. when you are healing and becoming one with your aspect, how does it feel?"

"It is a feeling of unity with my aspect," says Oaken Claw, sounding a bit dreamy, or perhaps dazed. She smiles with uncertain gratefulness, happy to be able to have some topic of familiarity on which to ground her shocked mind. "I emulate the Dragon of Wood, and so.. to heal, even if it means physical pain, is spiritual bliss, because I step that much closer. I am proud every time I do it, because I am enlightened enough to have the power to emulate even a fraction of my ideal."

"That sounds wonderful," Gallius says quietly. She smiles, looking around, "It's funny how this place makes you whisper." The lady turns back to the topic of aspects, though. "So what is the nature of the dragon of wood? I can see that it has the power of life, clearly, but I know little more. And how do you prepare to become one with an aspect?"

"Sextes Jylis, He Who Hath Strewn Much Grass.." Oaken Claw begins reciting, though not in the sing-song of bland recollection. Her voice is that of awed worship. "He plants and he prunes. Seeds are sewn; wheat is reaped. Life and Death flow from the same source, and are governed by similar laws. To wield those powers my Exaltation provides me, I meditate on this truth. I prepare myself for gain as well as loss, and I feel myself grow ready to accept both in equal measure. To hark back to the plant I showed you.. it will someday die. The moment I accepted that when I decided to nourish it, I was truly responsible for its health. Those I heal in the monastery will pass from this life someday, as well. It is for me to make that passing a thing of peace and serenity. If I cannot prolong their lives to find that peace, then.. I can at least ease their suffering as they die. Do you understand?"

"I think I do," says Gallius. "The realms I would preserve cannot last into eternity, but that is not for me to decide. Perhaps this will help me better understand my duties, though. I see much wisdom in it. I have to learn that I cannot conquer all. To try is the path to destruction and ruin. I must do what I am able to, and show men the way to make their own lives better, so they can stand on their own feet, even knowing that they must from time to time falter."

"Yes, that is the nurturing spirit of Wood," says Oaken Claw, with a smile. "A tree will grow without water and good soil, but it will grow better with those things. The fruit of an untended vine will still be edible, but the good farmer will have better produce. Husbandry does not grow things, it encourages natural growth."

Gallius smiles and nods. "I would like to talk to you about this again. I think you can teach me many things, if you are willing." She hmms, "But I fear it is time to go in now. I hope I use well my station. Remember, my friend, we are the guests here, and must resist the temptation to use force. Here only careful words and understanding can avail us."

---

Within the Bureau, Gallius and her guest are welcomed, by beings who seem composed of nothing less than living flame, and wearing the embroidered and decorative robes of the Celestial bureaucracy. "You are expected," hisses one particularly sibilant flame-god, who directs the pair down corridor after corridor. "Look not through the doors ye pass," this being counsels, and for herself Oaken Claw is content to obey. The minor god leads the two Exalts into a wide, spherical chamber at last, wherein a globe of water seems to hang unsupported at the center of the room. Five beings - three women, two men, including the Master - are also gathered here. "Welcome," says the Master, calmly bowing in greeting. "Gallius, we may have an opportunity. But first, I wish to show you something..."

Gallius obediently follows the flame-god, keeping her eyes where they belong and her mind focused. When she sees the Master she smiles, returning his bow. "I will see what you wish to show me," she replies.

The Master turns, and his fellows do as well. They gather around the sphere, chanting quietly, and around each springs a nimbus of visible Essence as they exert the energies of existence itself into the sphere before them. Suddenly the water bursts outward, in every direction, and for a moment Gallius feels like she's going to drown. The sensation quickly passes, and she finds herself looking "forward", as though peering at some far-off scene at the surface of a lake under which she floats. Closer and closer it grows, as though she were surfacing, and clearer and clearer the picture becomes. The scene becomes fully real, and she, Oaken Claw, and the five are standing on a hilltop, overlooking a valley.

"This is an illusion, a projection of sorts, made via magic," explains the Master, over his shoulder. "Nothing that happens here will affect you, so don't be afraid."

Gallius nods slowly. She looks down over the valley, trying to get her bearings. She doesn't speak out loud. She was to see something, and she imagines when the vision comes, it will be more clear to her.

The terrain looks only vaguely familiar in broad - it is no place Gallius has ever visited, although from the description Chi-Yosh and Ramar gave of their Lunar initiation trials, this place must be very near the Elemental Pole of Wood. All is quiet for a time. The trees stand tall, the birds sing, the wind blows, and even that can be felt on Gallius' cheek.

The first sign of something amiss is a distant roar, a sound that shakes the tree-tops more than even the slight breeze. It sends shivers down the spine of the Solar, and not only those of fear, but also of a terrible remembrance, half-glimpsed and buried in the labyrinthine depths of her Exalted soul.

Gallius trembles and moves as if to flinch away. But even as she takes a step back from that which isn't there, and yet is to her uniquely terrible and real, Oaken Claw ghosts a careful touch to her shoulder, drawing her back from the darkness of a memory not precisely her own.

The roaring comes closer, and is accompanied by a crashing sound. The shrieking, protesting sound of cracking and rending wood follows. Gallius and the others turn, noting its direction. From out of the trees comes a band of figures - at least two dozen warriors of the Fair Folk, dressed in their impossibly beautiful glamour-woven armour. Their swords flash like razor-edged mirrors or dewdrops in the cold sunlit air, and their haughty and attractive meins are even now reflecting a sheen of fear. They are not yet in a panic of flight, but they are close. From out of the trees, a shape bursts, sending fully-grown tree trunks scattering like so many poppy-seeds on the wind.

Gallius narrows her eyes at the sign of Fair Folk, her expression turning into one of great distaste. She waits and watches, however, knowing that it's only an illusion, but with a feeling that somehow what is happening is a mirror of the real.

The forest disgorges a metal monster, at least fifteen yards in length, with overlapping scales that gleam with golden hues, streaks of alabaster and joints that shimmer darkly with onyx. Its eyes, twin rubies that glow with a baleful red light, turn to regard the fey troop, and it leaps with unearthly strength at them. One claw crushes a single warrior to the ground, and another swings wide to bat away two more. The monster's tail dispatches a fourth, who thought to leap onto its back and attack. Satisfied the first wave has been dispatched or at least momentarily disabled, the beast's claw snatches up a fallen tree-trunk, wielding it like a club.

The solar raises an eyebrow, rather surprised at the strange beast. She still remains quiet, though, watching and wondering what that is. She looks for hearthstones, thinking of the warstriders and the volos.

Momentarily bipedal, the dragon-thing decimates four Fair Folk warriors in a single go, their remains left upon its improvised weapon. It drops the tree-trunk in disdain, and leaps a distance of twenty yards, to pounce on a few of those fey who have opted to flee. The encounter is over not more than a minute later.

Oaken Claw would normally by now be ready for battle, but trusting to the illusion, she stares hard at the terrible metal form. Whatever she feels, she keeps it hidden. But she truly feels more than a little revulsion at its form, and wariness at anything so potent. Even though it slays the Fair Folk, she does not love it, but finds the thought that it might exist terrifying.

Gallius frowns deeply, looking to Oaken Claw and then back to the violent scene. "What unhappy creation is this? What fit of madness would inspire one to construct something so perilous?" she asks.

"It is called a Thousand Forged Dragon," replies the Master solemnly. "A living artifact, a weapon from a bygone age."

"And is this its purpose?" asks Gallius. "Is it a guardian or a hunter?" She has many questions, but restrains herself to a few at a time. The full story she hopes will be coming soon.

"Its purpose is to defend the borders of Creation," replies one of the others gathered here, and the Master subsides, listening quietly as well. "It is a guardian, a very capable one at that."

"Then I am much relieved," says Gallius. "Provided, of course, it does not tarry from its place." She looks to the Master and says, "This begs only one question. If this is what I must see, then.. why?" She fears she might have a guess already, but will wait and listen.

"Because it was necessary. Its creators could not personally perform the task the Dragons so admirably do, and so they devised this clockwork solution." The speaker sounds rather dispassionate about the whole thing, but that is becoming a familiar refrain from what Gallius guesses are the Sidereals.

"Indeed," murmurs Gallius. She frowns thoughtfully, "So this thing still guards the edge of Creation. There are many forces that stand against the horde of Fair Folk and the Wyld, it seems." She tries to puzzle out why she had to see this for a moment, but lets it settle in the back of her mind. Sidereal purposes are not so easily discovered by her.

Oaken Claw is more curious than Gallius, or perhaps more willing to speak than the solar is. "Does this thing still exist? And who made it? You say they had not the power to guard creation like the dragons."

"This experience is happening in Creation at this very moment," intones one of the other Sidereals. "As for who made it, she did," she adds, pointing a finger at Gallius.

Gallius sighs and shakes her head. "Not in this life, at least. I have never even been where this thing stands," she replies. "But it summoned a memory, so I fear that one of the souls who has borne this spark before did create this, though I do not have any idea how. I have no talent in craft."

"Created one such creature.. or was destroyed by one," suggests another Sidereal, softly. The Master speaks, now. "Regardless, Oaken Claw, you would agree that the crafting of such a mechanism is well beyond the capabilities of the Realm, as it stands now?"

Oaken Claw turns to consider Gallius and then considers the creature. She sighs softly and shakes her head. "Indeed, the Anathema have more power than is safe for anyone," she murmurs softly, letting her thoughts be heard. "The Realm could never make anything so powerful, nor have I heard of any tales to make me think it was ever different."

"Clockwork creatures such as these, and Essence weapons, are the true defenders of the borders of Creation," murmurs the Master faintly. "These, and the Lunar Exalted, if they are to be believed in this matter. Gallius, you realize who crafted these beings. You do not remember, but in the Great Contagion, the Fair Folk hordes decimated the Dragon-Blooded armies, and were held off only by the power of the defense grid - a story Oaken Claw should know very well, as it marked the advent of the Scarlet Empress's power. The Realm's defense grid, also a product of the First Age Solars, the Thousand Forged Dragons, and other miracles are powerful indeed. But they are all that stand between this world and annihilation and madness."

The solar looks thoughtful, her gaze slipping back to the ground. "So we left a legacy that is not so terrible after all," she says calmly. "And yet in the end we had to be stopped from destroying creation ourselves. But we have returned." The unspoken question hangs in the air: why?

"All of these tools came from the Solars," says Oaken Claw, mulling over it. "It's.. difficult to accept so quickly." She frowns in thought, "But if any of my order would be willing to believe this, it is me. We do not have the power, even the Empress had not the power to do this."

The Master steps forward, actually smiling, as he places a hand on Gallius' shoulder. "The gods have made you great. It is the humanity in you that must make you good. Now, we have an appointment." On cue, the rushing feeling of water returns, and for another long moment the drowning sensation persists. Then the sphere of water has returned to itself, and the seven stand together in the chamber once again.

---

Gallius and Oaken Claw sit outside the large double doors in the Bureau of Destiny. The Master and his colleagues disappeared inside some time ago; many, many spirits have since passed through the doors in both directions, carrying messages. Finally, five men - no, Exalts - in robes arrive, coming as a group and blinking in surprise as they regard Oaken Claw. They confer amongst themselves for several seconds, then address Gallius. "She may not enter. When you are called in, come alone." And they, too, pass through the double doors.

Frowning deeply, Gallius sighs. "I fear I must apologize," she says. "I would not leave you waiting at the door, but here.." Oaken Claw smiles and waves a hand, "Here matters are done as they are done here, and the willow must bend or it shall surely be broken in the wind." The words bring a smile to the solar's lips and she nods.

Eventually a minor officiary comes out, and summons Gallius. She enters the double doors, into a darkened chamber, and is escorted to a seat at the large, round table that dominates the room. Ten men and women sit here, each delving through piles of scrolls, maps and other written materials scattered out before them. Three heads rise as Gallius sits, and finally, after much whispering, one man rises. "I am the Surrogate, from the Convention of the Center," he says, somewhat stiffly. "Introduce yourself to our Circle, please, as far as your function and current business are concerned."

"I am Gallius Leom, Zenith Caste of the Unconquered Sun," she answers. "My function is as steward of Greyfalls and all its people. I have come to negotiate for blessings to come to the city, so that the rebuilding can proceed well and the people may enjoy a time of health and growth after their bitter struggle."

A few of the Sidereals cough politely, and a few more smirk. Nevertheless, the Surrogate continues speaking. "Well, you are unlikely to get it," he remarks brusquely. "We of the Capital Convention are here to see if we can possibly smooth things over after that .. matter. The last thing we need is for some fool to ship a few legions east. That's also the last thing you want, I imagine. If you don't screw this up for us, priest, we'll do what we can for you. Am I clear?"

"That would be unfortunate," answers Gallius. But there's an air in her, and she meets the gave of the Sidereal evenly, unflinching. "But if you wish for respect you will show it. If you wish for my civil cooperation, you will not forget utterly to whom you speak and what my kind shall grow into. The tides of the world are changing, and we have again been summoned to serve Lord Helios. And serve we shall. Now tell me what accomodation you seek, and I will consider it on behalf of the people of Greyfalls, but I am not a wayward child, nor will I play the part."

"Simply put, we want no Realm military expedition to get past the coast. We do NOT want them defeated in open battle - we want them turned back as bloodlessly as possible, assuming they sail at all." The Surrogate frowns, and inspects some of the paperwork before him. "We have five avenues by which we can achieve this end. We'll narrow them down during this planning session." He stares up at Gallius. "If it should be necessary, we will need to take direct action against the commanders or House leaders responsible for making such decisions. Can we reliably call on you for such action?"

"If it will spare the lives of the men and women of Greyfalls, you can call upon me, yes," says Gallius. "But I will expect these acts to reap benefits for the people, and I imagine these deeds shall set many other things in motion." She considers the Sidereal carefully, weighing him. It comes clearly to her mind that she would believe his promised word, but not trust him to do anything at all for noble reasons.

"It will spare their lives, and the lives of the soldiers of the Great Houses, and the lives of their commanders and masters, who will be so desperately needed in the coming year," observes the Surrogate drily. "It is for the sake of life that we wish to act. And so, with your efforts, we may succeed. Thank you for your time and attention." He rises, inclining his head with at least a hint of politeness.

Gallius rises smoothly and bows. "We will meet again," she says simply, turning away. She has no foresight, perhaps, but she has something that to her seems better: a strong will. She departs eagerly, wishing to make sure that Oaken Claw has not been dragged off into some plot.

Oaken Claw is unharmed and undisturbed, and the meeting finally breaks up. The Capital Convention's five delegates depart, and the Master leaves his associates behind to guide Gallius and her guest out to the aerial rikshaw.

"It was productive," says Gallius simply. In more ways than one. She rather doubts they will see her quite the same way. She is no upstart, and will have respect from those who wish her to respect them. She gazes ahead quietly, wondering just what she will be called to do later.

The Master is actually grinning, as he hefts a stack of paperwork. "And this will get you what you wished for," he says, as the rikshaw takes off. It arrives at another branch of the Bureau, this one looking softer, somehow. "The Cerulean Lute of Harmony," he explains, getting out. "Come."

Gallius laughs softly, "Somehow I thought becoming an awe-inspiring Solar would mean a break from bureaucrats. I guess some things cannot be avoided." She just hopes the Master handles such things. She is a leader and not much of a scribe.

"Heaven is, at heart, organized. The fundamental laws of Creation are written here, and every care is taken to ensure that they are not capricious," explains the Sidereal, as he leads the way inside. "Humanity has enough of that to go around already, wouldn't you say?"

"True, even with all this the world seems far from predictable," says Gallius. "And yet in the whimsy of nature lies much beauty." Oaken Claw looks at the paper and seems more surprised by that than anything else at the moment, "Paperwork in Heaven?" She sounds almost discouraged!

"I take it neither of you have been in the Wyld," remarks the Master, drily. He introduces himself in quiet tones to an attendant spirit, and in short order an audience is arranged. The Master speaks with a functionary, a god of living water and swirling leaves trapped in its liquid body, and they converse at length about some matter. Then he waves Gallius and Oaken Claw forward, explaining briefly. "By averting a great battle, and thus negating a large amount of injury, the efforts of our patron here --" the watery being, it seems "-- can be better directed elsewhere. Say, to those in Greyfalls. Gallius, I cannot stress how important it will be to abide by your word of earlier."

"Were it of no external importance at all still I would die for the truth of my oath," answers Gallius. "If I am to wear a noble mantle I must hold my word dear. I will aid as I have sworn." She does not mind the reminder, though it is seemingly unnecessary. "I would have preferred a better idea of what I was agreeing to, but I imagine the future is a fickle thing, and the motions of the chosen throw ripples across the surface of the web of time."

The Master chuckles. "Indeed.. And now, let me present Liat-Yo, Blossom of Beneficial Healing." The god nods its.. head?.. politely. "I can not act directly. However, I will offer you this.." It reaches into a small box at the side of its office, withdrawing a circular amulet, inscribed with a stylized tree. "Take this to a temple of Halvah. The rogue god. It will aid you in whatever way it can, with this."

Gallius accepts the amulet and bows, "Thank you, Liat-Yo." She turns to the Master. She won't bother asking where this other god's temple is. She has a feeling it is already known. Or if not, she will just have to find it. Either way, it will be done.

The Temple of Halvah is simply a forest grove, and the Master indicates a tree-stump with a slight depression at the center, sized perfectly to receive the amulet Liat-Yo provided. Gallius places it accordingly, and from the depths of the forest, a voice speaks. It's soft, like the rippling of wind through leaves. _I am Halvah, the Tree of Life. I recognize you, O Prince of the Earth._

"I have come to ask for your aid, Halvah," answers Gallius. "In the City of Greyfalls many are suffering. I was told if I came to you their pains could be lessened." She wonders to herself what this god can do. She realizes she must learn far more about the spirits of the world if she is to become a friend of them.

_Gather the seeds from this grove. Plant them where you wish me to be, and I will come._ And with that the voice ceases.

With great care Gallius does as she is told, collecting the seeds and cradling them in her hands. She sets them in a bag of some plush material that she was given by her father. Her father, who told her stories of strange men and magical seeds when she was a child. "And now they are real," she whispers to herself.

And in the city of Greyfalls, the seeds are carefully deposited. "It may take a night and a day for them to grow," advises the Master. "But likely not longer."
