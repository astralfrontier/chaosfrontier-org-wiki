The fourteenth day of Descending Air, marking the apex of the wintery season, is a cold and bitter day in some climes. In the gorge through which the Ominous River flows and falls as the Bridal Veil into a pool far below, wind whistles and snaps, and occasionally a pennant-flag will snap or a guttering torch will be blown out entirely by the savage strikes of the wind and storm gods in the throes of their races down the valley.

Dealing with hitherto-unknown gods in power is a survival strategy that the last two millennia have painfully instructed the common man of Creation in, and there are common steps that all people try. Young men and girls have come, comely and shy, offerings to the sun-gods from the grateful (and not a little afraid) people of Bridal Veil. So far their new masters have comported themselves with honor and surety, but there are many who question how long a fair wind will blow.

Now, as the winds whistle south, the diligence of the city-state's new masters in demonstrating their benevolence is rewarded. Davron stands on a high balcony, gazing out over the valley land and silently considering the beseeching, terrified, violent expression of the autocrat in his last moments. He stops to listen, and the wind speaks to him, whispering and laughing its way past his ear. _Where do we go? We go to the south? Where do we seek? We seek the warriors! We will see for ourselves the army that marches toward the veil! We will see the barbarian who seeks to take the bride for its own!_

This is news that warrants reporting; Gallius is not unsurprised to hear them, and in examining a map of the surrounding area, and reading the reports of the spies who safeguard the kingdom's borders, she is sure of an imminent attack from the kingdom to the south. It is a place called Defiler's Grave, and they can arrive within two days.

Gallius shakes her head, sighing over the map. "Two days," she murmurs. Knowing the count of things, she is not thrilled. "Well, there's nothing to do but to make this into another swift victory," she decides. She will waste no time in calling up the ones who had commanded the armies of the autocrat, as well as calling her friends to her.

Gallius outlines her plan swiftly. It will have to be simple, because this army is likely not used to her tactics. She wants to present the very image of a disorganized defense not far from the city, and with the swiftest people of the city, Gallius herself will lead a flanking manuever. As for the others.. they will be needed front and center. The apparently disorganized defense must be swiftly marshalled into an ordered press of arms, allowing her to catch the would-be attackers between the anvil and the hammer.

Ramar answers the summons sent out by the Lady Gallius. He listens and observes as the plan for battle is discussed. "I too have a plan," he states, and he outlines his plan as well. It is a plan for negotiation, for finding out what it is they want, and finding a way to drive them back without bloodshed. A treaty could even be forged, it is suggested. "If this is what we wish to do..."

Davron rubs his chin, contemplatively. "Why, I wonder? Why now?" The idea of immediately pursuing a military solution sits ill with him, and yet he doubts that a barbarian army is coming to pay a social call. Sighing softly, he says as much, adding however, "Perhaps we can combine the two. Send out our force as if seeking a parley, while Gallius' force waits in reserve."

"A Queen must attend any such affair," says Gallius. "I will not sulk, and I think pursuing a less violent method might be best. If they decide to betray us, they will find it a terribly dangerous affair." She smiles, "I will set my hand in the maw of the lion if they will. If our enemies will treat with us, I will be there. But they had best be very cautious and courteous, of the lioness may tear the life out of them."

Gallius prepares her army as swiftly as possible. Those who are marked as the swiftest are carefully divided from the rest. The Queen calls upon the essence and with care prepares her troops for battle. There is no feint this time. This is a show of strength, and so ranks are arranged with care, march times handled. A drum to set the pace. With a nod, Gallius sees her men are as ready as they possibly can be. It is time to march upon those who would prey upon Bridal Veil.

Gallius words to her men banish fear from their eyes. Even the most seasoned of veterans smiles and bows to her, suddenly encouraged by this very image of a war goddess come to earth. Gallius moves about the lines, straightening a badge or complimenting the craftsmanship of a spear or blade. The captains kneel before her to receive a blessing, and then fall in place behind her while the standard of the Nation of the Sun is taken to the front of the line. When all is at last ready, Gallius draws herself onto the back of Jin-nu and sets a good marching speed to the beat of the drum, her spear held at ready, glittering.

The army from Defiler's Grave arrives on the cold, clear dawn of the seventeenth day of Descending Air. They are without exception armed with swords and well-made spears, and come with a number of cavalry units dispersed throughout. In three narrow columns they march, and Ramar's keen eyes can spy the signal-men in their heavy armor, moving through the ranks. Whatever else they may be, this army is not slapdash. The forces of Bridal Veils, now led by the four sun-gods who march at the fore, could not quite match that organization before, but something new has been added. The force commanders approach each others' position under flags of parlay, on the east bank of the Ominous River. As the stern heraldic pennants of Defiler's Grave's stylized mountain blow in the same breeze as the elegant heraldic waterfall-emblem of the valley kingdom, the southern nation's envoy steps up and presents herself in a long, respectful bow.

Gallius pauses and calls out to those who approach, her palm raised in sign of peace (at least for the moment.) "People of Defiler's Grave, why have you come from your homes with force of arms?" she calls out, and in her tone there is something of a darkness, an ominous power, but perhaps more a warning against those who would defy her.

The envoy rises from her bow, and begins speaking. "Word has reached us of the autocrat's demise," she says, giving reply in the formal form of Rivertongue. "My king commanded me to ensure that our northern neighbor was in no distress, that the people did not groan under the weight of a great tyrant nor riot in the throes of anarchy." The woman's eye scans the massed ranks of troops behind the Solars, and continues after a barely perceptible pause. "I see that at least the soldiers stand behind their general."

Gallius smiles at the envoy and replies, "They no longer groan under the weight of a tyrant. But what of your people? How do they fare?" She has to wonder at this very curious act of compassion from one nation to another. Mostly because in Roleyn she was taught if it looks like horse droppings and smells like horse droppings, you probably don't want to grab a handful and confirm it.

The envoy smiles, and beckons to the massed ranks behind her. "Defiler's Grave, like Bridal Veil, enjoys the support of its soldiers. And its soldiers are citizens too," she says. "We came prepared to quell a great riot, if necessary, but I am relieved to see that it is not necessary. That being the case, perhaps our respective armies should return home to their families, and we can arrange a more auspicious meeting?"

"As you can see," calls Ramar, "There is no great riot here which needs to be quelled. We are grateful, however, to discover our neighbors to the South are ready to lend their citizen's considerable military might if it should be needed." The Solar smiles, picking his words carefully, setting each one to aid in this task of smoothing the peace between the two nations. "A more auspicious meeting would indeed be appreciated. We can celebrate with our newfound neighbors and our armies need not risk their lives needlessly."

Ramar mentions, though it is softly, and in a voice meant only for the Circle, in a language known to them, "You do of course realize that they have come to test our readiness, and that as things stand now, if it had come to blows, they could easily march over our army... however our readiness has given them enough pause as is necessary to resolve things peacefully."

"Or at the very least..." Adds Ramar, with a somewhat knowing smile, "That is what she believes when she glances at our army."

"I suggest in the future when you seek to offer aid that you leave your spears and armor at home," says Gallius. "But the gesture is appreciated," and at this, the Queen makes sure not to smirk. "We will not forget such kindness, I assure you. Perhaps we might find ways in the future to lend each other aid and to profit from it." To which Gallius thinks to herself: not very likely.

"In three days' time, I will call upon you again," offers the envoy. "I will come with my retinue, and learn for myself of Bridal Veil's new rulers." She smiles and bows again.

Davron's brow wrinkles slightly as he listens, silently, to the exchange, but this is also accompanied by a faint smile. He may have his doubts about Gallius' direct approach, but having known her for a while, he knows better than to imagine that she'd have anything to do with weasel-words. Mostly, though, he is glad that his own voice is not called upon to join in the parley.

As the envoy makes her statement, Ramar will smile. "Very well then." As the two armies leave what may well have been the field of battle, Ramar shares an insight with his Circle. "I am not quite sure what it is... but there is something that has these people afraid of an actual fight... it is not that they are unable to deal with it... far from it, they were ready to roll over our city I am sure... but something has them inclined to keep the peace. We shall have to find out what it is when they arrive in a few days." He smiles, "And perhaps in those few days we can reveal to them the folly they saved themselves from by not attacking... if you wish."

Back at the citadel in Bridal Veil, the Master is waiting for the returning Solars, and there is another man with him. He is dressed in a traveler's cloak, with a thickly-wrapped bundle on his back. He's bald, with piercing eyes, and a warrior's mein. "Let's talk," says the Master, solemnly.

Gallius looks from the Master to the stranger and bows. She's got nothing to say at the moment, and so it will be unsaid.

As Ramar greets the Master and the Stranger, there are many questions dancing behind his eyes. He smiles, bows his head at the Master's request and says, "Yes, let's. Greetings."

The Master leads the way into a small private chamber adjoining the autocrat's throne room, and his companion follows. "You've left the nest; my protection is withdrawn. I will continue to advise you, but I must return to my business - training newly Exalted Solars." And here he claps the new arrival on the shoulder. "This is Dace, a mercenary captain of Nexus. He wishes to regain his former glory and surpass it as a leader of men. He sought your Circle out."

Gallius turns her eyes upon Dace and a small, calm smile comes to her lips. "Welcome to Bridal Veil, Dace," she says softly. "I am Gallius Leom." There's an expectation in her bearing. To those who know her, it's clear that something has her quite excited. She waits eagerly for a more complete sign, however, before she reveals her thoughts.

Chi-Yosh regards the stranger. The Master has brought him, and that alone gives weight to him. Though once the explanation is given - a soliloquy for The Master - he gives a more critical eyeing. He for the moment is restrained; the Su'Katan definitely wishes to know this man, to clap his hand and talk, but the formalities seem to be precident.

The man approaches and extends a hand. "It's an honor, Lady. Your Circle is achieving what I seek." The Master speaks, as well. "I will be training him, but I hope that all of you will aid in his education."

Gallius clasps the offered hand, allowing herself to smile more fully. "We will do all we can to aid you, Dace. I have found that many Solar dreams run down the very same road. I have a feeling and a hope that we shall often work together."

Ramar's eyebrows raise upon hearing the Master's words. _We have left the nest..._And for a moment, all of his past deeds, and the accomplishment and trials he's been through since meeting the Master, and learning from him come to mind. He smiles, and though it is a warm smile, there is some sadness to it. "Yes, I suppose that perhaps it is time," he says, as though realizing for the first time what he'd known all along, "There is always an ending, isn't there?" He asks this of The Master, and continues, "Few things rise that do not descend. Everything changes, and yet nothing is ever truly lost, and so we come to a new beginning. Greetings Dace. I am Ramar."

Davron is slow to speak, as is his wont, but finally he smiles, offering his own hand to the warrior. "And I am Davron. I am sure we shall all have much to teach each other," he says, smiling.

"I am Chi-Yosh." Stepping forward, he waits a moment for Dace to finish with Davron before clapping his forearm and shaking. It is a custom he had seen passed among the guards and boasting men of Nexus in taverns and in the streets. "It is good to meet another of the Sun. I look forward to your return from Nane. But the Master is wise in laying the foundations of what an Exalt needs."

The bald warrior smiles, shaking hands in turn. "With your permission, I'll return here soon," he says, nodding toward the Master. "I'm to go to Nane for now." The Sidereal inclines his head, then faces the remaining Solars. "You may find another advisor more accessible," he says. "I will be busy. However, this may help.." He withdraws a scroll from his sleeve and presents it to Ramar. "Seek my allies in Heaven. Your final task from me is to find your own way there."

The scroll is taken, and tucked away into Ramar's sleeve. He bows his head, and draws in a deep breath. The scroll will be reviewed in time, and Dace will be taught in time... but for now, there is much to be done, and much to be said. The Solar faces the Master, and speaks a simple phrase, "Thank you." It is funny how two simple words can carry so much meaning behind them, how a simple phrase as that can manage to express the thoughts and emotions one builds up over the years. Perhaps Ramar has learned something after all. He smiles.
