After finishing his training with Patient Mantis, Chi-Yosh treks into Korad. The secrets of _yurei_ are a carefully concealed thing, and must be approached carefully. Each tribe may be different, but there is likely a universal secrecy surrounding those who hold the flower's mysteries. Thus, his first stop is the Tribe of Goran, to speak to the wise woman about etiquette with the others.

Va can be found, working in her bough-bound home in the trees, though Goran is away from the tribe's land. "It's you!" she remarks in surprise, hopping down to the damp and springy soil as Chi-Yosh makes himself known. "Are you here to help us after all?"

The Dawn laughs. "I have come to see how you fare." He offers the old woman a friendly embrace. "You look well and healthy. How goes the challenge to unite all of Korad?"

"Goran needs much help," says Va, solemnly. "We're barbarians in the sight of people. We're rebels against God to our fellow tribes."

Chi-Yosh watches Va, considering the matter. Goran needs to conquer the others of Korad, and Chi-Yosh is powerful enough to aid there. Yet, Gaulderak is a far more powerful opponent that mortals do not fare well against. The God must be removed, for Goran's presence to spread. But if that were to happen, spirits would become unruly, the power vacuum could be filled with other beings for individual tribes, making it even harder. "It is a difficult matter, even for me," he says at last. "But I will do what I can."

"Va," continues Chi-Yosh, "I may have to face Gaulderak myself. Do you know anything of his power? His might, what he is capable of?" It is unlikely, but the Solar needs an idea of what he faces.

The woman spreads her hands. "He is the god of the Korad, and is the tongue of the tribes. His power is in those who speak him."

Chi-Yosh gazes off into the forest. "Thank you, Va. I will need some things from you, first."

Ever since the Unconquered Sun had sat at the peak of the sky overlooking Korad, Chi-Yosh has sat in a small clearing, praying. Surrounding him are various symbols carved into the dirt, then filled with a mixture of water and herbs. But none have beckoned to his call. Twilight slowly begins to cover the forest itself. Something is wrong.

Standing up, Chi-Yosh begins to walk around the clearing, almost in a dream. This clearing had called to him, the power had been felt beneath the skin, and he had thought it the perfect spot for the summons, but as Luna peeks out over the night, it all becomes more clear. Beneath the silver lights, wards bare themselves, carved around the tree trunks. From somewhere inside, he knows their power speaks for the cabals of mortal sorcerors, who meet in ceremonial places at moonrise, muted from the eyes and ears of the spirits around them. Here they trade secrets and stories, knowledge and power over the beings around them, and it would not do well to have those very beings overhear their weaknesses exposed.

The ritual begins again, and Chi-Yosh attunes himself to the invisible world, where the gods dance and mock and laugh. He calls in the words of the gods, reciting ancient oaths that Heaven bound even the least spirit to in the elder time before Man. And a spirit comes indeed, emerging from the void of perception and materializing slowly, as the wind picks up and blows at the leaves of the surrounding trees with unnatural energy.

Chi-Yosh wears his caste mark, baring himself to the thing tied to the world like he. "Greetings," He calls forth. "I come seeking knowledge. But the Servant of Helios will serve a task for you, in exchange."

"Speak your wish," the winds blow, as the spirit's shape, that of green leaves held together by eddies in the air, hovers near. "What would you have of me?"

"Gaulderak," Says Chi-Yosh. "He is the God of the Korad, who's might weaves outwards over the many spirits here. But all Gods are weak, somehow. I wish to know of his power, and his weakness. And one who could keep the spirits to their duties in his absence."

"His power is that which his speakers give him," recites the spirit. "But he is like any other god, and can be bound like any other." The wind blows more shrilly. "Any who can bind Gaulderak would have no fear of the gods beneath him."

Chi-Yosh sets this information aside. "The lesser gods then could be sworn oaths to rule their small kingdoms without causing strife for eachother and the peoples, by this one who could bind Gaulderak?"

"Of course," whispers the breeze that is the spirit's voice.

Chi-Yosh says, "Thank you, spirit." After a moment, "And what do you wish of me."

"Bathe the base of my roots in your blood," commands the spirit softly. "So that I may live again.. Walk north until the moon shines from below your feet, and you will find my home."

"It will be done."

And so, as the spirit departs, Chi-Yosh rises. He has not learned much, thus what he has been told must be looked at from many angles. As the trek takes him north, the Solar's mind wanders. Part of the key is the language his people speak, which gives him power. If only they could stop from speaking the language. Or an oath could be sworn of Gaulderak, to not return for a time. But a God would not take such an Oath when he holds all of the power. The Su'Katan sorely misses Ramar.

Twilight has given way to night. Chi-Yosh walks, and walks, for almost three miles. He stops, and looks down. Here is the place, he realizes, for the moon is shining from beneath his feet. Its reflection is being cast by a long pond or very small lake, and at the center of the water is an island. And on the island is an enormous and singular tree, whose branches curl into arcane shapes and whose green and leafy canopy shines under the bright white light of Luna. In the distance is the comforting green and blue of Gaia as she too shines down, hiding away from her sister shyly in the night sky.

Chi-Yosh marvels at the site for a moment. Then he dives into the waters, swimming across to the spirit's island. Upon the shore he climbs, up to the trunk of the tree, to sit before it. One of his weapons is taken in hand, to expose the line of his arm. He cuts just above the wrist sideways, careful not to hit anything delicate and important, but merely the veins beneath. He then repeats on the other hand. Blood wells up on the wounds before he drains red onto the exposed roots and soil of the tree. There he sits for a time, then rises - and wobbles - before moving around to a fresh spot. He continues until the tree has been circled, and feeling weak, spills Essence into his wounds.

---

The trip from the spirit's home is a tired one. Even though Essence has given him some strenght, he is weak by the time he returns to Va's home just before sunrise. He stirs the aged woman, and explains what he needs. _Yurei_, he hopes, is the answer. It melds the dreams of Man and God, and through it, he might understand something that his eyes cannot yet see. Then he will rest, and consider.

Once before, the Circle had drank _Yurei_, to understand the plight of Goran's tribe and his frustration towards Syllum. Now, Chi-Yosh takes the ancient mix to aid Goran's fight against Gaulderak himself. The Solar knows he could challenge the God or merely knock him from the sky, but that is the way of a man without options, and all other options should be explored. Gaulderak is a rightful ruler, and thus, he deserves a fair chance. And so the Dawn sits down, as Va gives him the flask. She is thanked, then he drinks, and sits back. To aid him, the tribeswoman begins to speak the tongue that gives Gaulderak his power.

The Solar begins to slowly relax, and he hears the words Va speaks. Strangely, he can understand them. And through the power of Word, he can imagine their meaning on the stage of the theater of the mind.

Va speaks of the tribe's history, when a leader called Kor brought the dissolute tribes to the Eastern Threshold. They had dwelt in madness, taking part in the roiling chaos that gnaws at the edges of the world, shaping it and themselves and being shaped in return. In those days they were giants, and monsters, and malformed gibbering things that waylaid the innocent with spears clutched in four furry hands. Kor found them, and brought them to more civilized lands.

The words Va uses are uncertain, evoking myth rather than memory, but the power of the _yurei_ blossom permits Chi-Yosh to see the truth of these matters. He sees the giant Kor, a head taller than even the mighty Goran, a leader of men, his eyes burning as he speaks in bold and fiery tones to the tainted barbarians over which he rules. He sees the first great gift Kor made - that of language, which the Wyld-folk lacked entirely. Once they spoke only in clicks and grunts, transmitting no more than the barest essentials of survival. The gift of Gaulderak was the first blessing to the people now called the Korad, and it was with that gift that Kor was able to guide his chosen people west from the brink of madness and into the fields and forests we know.

Another man might see the tattoos that coat Kor's body, as his muscles ripple in the firelight and flex with purpose as he gestures in his speechmaking. Another warrior might see the strength in those arms, the tone and power of the speaker. But few men would see the tattoos, and know their true nature, and finally understand the true power Kor had over men and gods.

Chi-Yosh sees all this, a storybook of words that play across his mind. It strikes him as amazing how Kor sought to bring the tribes out of the Wyld, of sheer primal base, and make them civilized, human. It is much like what Goran seeks, in a way. But as the Solar listens and sees, paticular attention is payed to the power of Kor, the markings on his skin. Perhaps the very key he needs.

Chi-Yosh comes back from the trance, a deeper understanding of the matter. Kor sought to ensure his people would grow up and decide who they were. But until then, they needed understanding and unity of eachother. Gaulderak supported them, not just controlling the little gods, but giving communication. But once you have grown up, you must not depend on others. And what Gaulderak had given was language. What the people needed was their own, and from their own language would stem their own identity, the beginnings of a heritage. "Va," says the Su'Katan at last. "It's time for a change in direction."

The Solar explains to the wise woman his line of thought. He shares her the secrets of what he learned of their founder, and the plans behind the plans. She nods and shakes her head, in some places skeptical, but others a truth rings out, and finally it all seems as clear as a day in Ascending Fire. Chi-Yosh is no linguist, nor is Va, but there are steps that must be taken, and that they do.

The Goranjin are at an advantage in knowing Riverspeak as well as Gaulderak. The two languages are different, but there are similarities in how words are said, how they make a difference between what happened yesterday, and what happens now, and what they plan to do. But that is a headache to do before you have words to make it so. Rather than help, Va decides to take over completely, with the aid of her pupil and two others of the tribe's sharpest minds. Chi-Yosh follows behind as the four make the rounds of the village, pointing at everything in sight and dictating what it will be. The Solar suggests they might wish to start drawing the words themselves in the dirt, to see them, and then put them in rows. And from there, the Korashin begins.

It is not three days later that the tribe is visited in their dreams, by the god Gaulderak. It pronounces the development of this new language as starkest heresy, and forbids all true inheritors of Kor from indulging in such nonsense. This, of course, tells the tribe - and Chi-Yosh - that their course is the correct one. And of Gaulderak's threat to lower the spirit tracks and permit the other tribes to ambush the Goranjin for their blasphemy? "It will never happen," announces Va with a smile. "If the Syllans to the south didn't march on the forest as a whole, the ancient rivalries between the other tribes would flare up, and they would tear themselves apart. It is an idle threat from a complacent god."
