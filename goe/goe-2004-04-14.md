While the green monk works her healing ministrations on her fallen colleague in black, the dragon-tattoo on her face glowing visibly with the effort, the knight in jade is undeterred by the spectacular separation of his weapon from his hand. Eyes glittering, his now-empty fingers curling - as though he were unconsciously testing that he still retained his hand as well - he reaches for a section of the flotsam and breaks off a stout length of the remains of the downed sky-ship. Wielding it as an improvised club, he launches an attack at Gallius. His warrior's spirit is undaunted by the unworthy weapon he holds, yet the diminishment of his skill is discernible.

Gallius has to give the man credit for his courage. Or would, if it did not seem like mere desperation. She leaps away from the man, using the whistling speed of her spear to not just block the attack but to throw yet more of the broken ship in his face.

The flashing club is just one more piece of wood moving rapidly through the air, and Gallius' defense falters. Nevertheless the surety of power he once held is gone; she can feel a heavy trauma through her armor, but the pain is not so bad - the knight's true power is broken now.

The battle has swayed from one of doubt to one that in the eyes of the Queen of the Nation of the Sun is all but decided. Glowing with the wrath of Helios she breaks away from the broken-toothed knight and hurls herself towards the archer monk. Before she reaches her foe she stabs the blade of her spear into a pile of the wreckage and vaults through the air, where she spins like a deadly top. Even as she glides through the sunlit air she lashes out at the weapon of her foe, seeking to knock it from her arms.

Another foe unarmed, Gallius' spin continues and her blade is drawn across the chest of her foe, cutting fabric but with the skill of a surgeon drawing no blood. Meeting eyes with her enemy Queen Gallius says, "Enough! You are beaten! Do not waste your lives this way!"

The gunfighter, undaunted by the explosion of fire and Essence around his body and anima, has both guns out, and Chi-Yosh and Ramar both freeze as the hammers click back and twin barrels aim directly at their foreheads. So does everyone else, for a resounding bellow of "Hold!" has echoed across the sleepy, snowy mountaintop. The lake itself ripples with momentary waves at the force of the command, and its speaker, the knight in his heavy jade armor, is turning to regard Gallius, Ramar, Chi-Yosh and Davron in turn.

Davron already has an arrow out of the quiver and halfway to his bow when the commanding voice resounds across the battlefield. He lowers the hand to his side, and nods stoically in Gallius' direction in recognition of her valiant effort - valor in the cause of peace always more dear to his heart than valor in arms. He then turns his own gaze upon the Wyld Hunters each in turn, heedless of the blood trailing down his neck, hoping against hope that they might see past the tales of 'Anathema' - but prepared, if they do not.

Gallius turns to face the knight and nods to him. "You do not have to die," she begins. "You have killed an endless stream of my kindred, but yet I would give you this chance to learn the truth of the matter. We are not meant to be at each other's blades! We are meant to strive, to live, and to die together. All your lives you have been told that my people are anathema. If that were true, I should be killing you now! You can see that I am strong enough to do so, and it would also be just, for it was you who attacked me from the shadows. But I will count it as no victory to leave you dead here."

Chi-Yosh waits, tense, staring down the lenght of the Gunfighter's arm, the cold feel of steel cressing his brow. The Su'Katan could avoid the bolt, but right now, just evading is not the threat. The threat is tension, like the executioner's blade, poised above them all. Blood runs down his chest in a river, turning wet clothes nearly black. The bullet, he fears not. The battle that could come on the heels of words cast aside, is another matter.

"Such words we have heard before," the knight counters, sounding grim and level, the stolidness of earth, and perhaps the stubbornness as well, reflecting itself in his voice. "And yet the Anathema have also attacked us and slain Exalts in the past, without any provocation. Others are known for their corruptive power of persuasion."

Davron turns to the valiant knight of the Earth. "Such powers are known among our kind, I'll not deny that. But will you not even listen to us? Will the fear of poisoned words forever close your ears? Is there no way to show you how the world has changed?" He shakes his head. "We too grew up with the tales of the evil demons of old. We believed them! And then the stories caught up with us. We did not ask for the powers we have."

The young archer gestures to the blazing emblem of Twilight on his brow, his throat ragged with emotion. "This! This drove me from my village - my lifelong home! Even on the very night it saved them! I did not blame them - I thought they might even be right..." He sighs. "But I've learned better since then." He turns his gaze on the other hunters before him. "Must we forever pay for the sins of our ancestors, or for our modern-day kin who abuse their gifts? May we not be judged by our own actions?"

The Hunt hesitates. The twin thumbs on the twin revolvers ease back; the hammers come down gently. Similarly, knives clutched in two slim, graceful and ready hands withdraw underneath the feathered cloak of their owner. "You did not sue for peace earlier," retorts the knight, gruffly. "But you do so now.." He eyes his friends and companions for a moment. "Perhaps your powers are nearly exhausted. Or perhaps you speak the truth."

"My power is not yet wasted," Calls Chi-Yosh, still beneath the shadow of the Occultist's pistols. "But my life nearly is. I would rather stand back and let us all live, rather than die sending what few I could to their grave." He drops a kama, pointing southward. "Look that way, and you will find a nation being built where slavers, jade-weighted aristocrats and tyrants once ruled. Demons seek destruction, and death. We've brought life and opportunity to so many more."

The improvised club spins in the knight's capable hand, and he slams it down against the ground, splintering it a little bit, and resting one gauntleted hand atop the end. "Very well," he says at last. "You all wish us to judge you on your actions. What do you propose we do?"

Gallius, for a moment, just listens. Not to anyone here, but to something half-whispered in the twisted memories of her spark. After a few moments, she speaks. "You say that we can use powers to corrupt you, but your own kind also has powers of persuasion. You seemingly deal with each other, and so you must learn to deal with us, in turn. We are not going away. The realm is not as strong as it once was. Everywhere danger looms. Fate can no longer rest solely on your shoulders. Against the Fair Folk and the Deathlords the shield of the Realm can no longer defend, indeed it never did, save by the creations my kind made. We must work together or die one by one. I speak no honeyed words. I cannot easily trust you, but my heart demands that I do not kill in cold blood. My mind also extolls me not to waste honorable lives. Is this corruptive persuasion to you?"

"As for what I would have you do, that is simple," says Gallius. "We are forging a new nation in the east, and it is in need of noble men who can be relied-upon to defend the people and work in the name of justice. Come with us and see our works with your own eyes. You will see new things, and some may be different than you were taught. Some are indeed different than they ever were in the past, but that is no accident. The past was a terrible failure and it has nearly destroyed all of Creation. Many evils were done that can never be set right. We should not waste our time trying. We should instead create a new world, where men and women will be safe and live in harmony with each other and their surroundings. Solars cannot do this alone, nor can the Chosen of the Dragons. We cannot be victorious if we are not together."

The sky-ship overhead is rapidly disappearing from sight; apparently somebody's been observing the course of the battle, and taken the only possible course that good Realm tactics permit. None of the Huntsmen on the ground seem surprised, disappointed, or worried about this development. The silence of the ten combatants is broken only by the quiet sounds of the wind blowing through tree branches and sending its invisible fingers dancing across the surface of the cold lake. The knight looks from face to face, examining his companions for answers to the riddle laying before them. The Solars look too, and in each face they see something unexpected, but somehow strangely familiar.

Spelled out in the determined eyes of each of the Huntsmen is something that the Circle's members itself have experienced, at one particular moment, the time of their Second Breath. At that single shining moment, when the glory of Heaven was opened to each needy soul, there was an overwhelming sense of rightness, of unity, of understanding. Each, just for a moment, and in his or her own way, felt at some level the hierarchy of existence, and their place in it. And that awareness can be seen now, dawning in the eyes of the six erstwhile combatants.

"Very well then..." Ramar nods slowly, watching the new dawn within the eyes of the Solar's former foes.. He smiles, "There are wounded on all sides... may I propose that we take a moment or two to tend to them? I know at least one of our number is skilled in the healing arts."

"You can tend to your own, as I see no mortally wounded among you," calls the green monk, rising from her position. Her friend, the black monk, has regained consciousness. His eyes widen, and he leaps to his feet, rushing forward - and a steady hand is immediately placed on his sternum, by the green monk, who shakes her head.

Gallius looks aside to what remains of the airship and shakes her head. "Well, at least we shall have a very long walk to talk things over. There is much we can learn from each other." She lowers her weapon and makes her way over to the knight. Stopping at his side, she looks at his hands, and then to the water. "If you get a fire going, I'll get your sword," she says, letting just the ghost of a smile form on her lips.

There's a faint growing from beyond the tree-line. Within a minute, almost two dozen dark shapes have appeared. They lope on their hind legs; their furry hides and extended snouts mark them as wolves, but for the horridly intelligent glitter in their eyes and the crudely shaped spears clutched in their fingered paws. The sound of the battle has attracted these creatures, and the scent of Exalted blood in the air sets their nostrils aquiver. Overhead, the Maiden of Battles shines dimly in the sky, smiling.

---

The last Mad Wolf falls, slumping into the lake, and Gallius takes a moment to lean on her naginata and stare at the icy waters that claim the body willingly. Around her, the Dragon-Blooded and her fellow Circlemates have fared just as well. Most are sporting fresh cuts and bruises, but these are incidental to the ferocious nature of combat in the far North, where even simple survival exacts a price unrelentingly. The four Solars and the half-dozen Dragon-Blooded converge again, watching each other with much less wariness as their bleeding wounds close one by one thanks to their divine heritage.

The knight in jade lets go at last of another piece of flotsam, salvaged from the wreckage of the sky-ship. Half its length remains thrust into his final opponent, who lays lifeless on the stony ground. "I'm running out of wood to start a fire with," he observes ruefully, gesturing to the several pieces which lay scattered about, their purpose as improvised weapons concluded. "However, my sword would still be appreciated."

"Well..." Ramar trails off, seeing that Gallius has already volunteered to get the sword. He sheathes his sword and slumps back into the hard ground. "Well... perhaps..." He nods towards the trees, "We might find some wood to build the fire with in there?" He catches his breath, "I'll go gather some, if you'd like."

Gallius nods to the knight and sighs wearily. "Well, if my memory serves, if fell in about five paces from the shore.. but there's been so much wreckage shifting, now.." She laughs a bit and tosses aside her spear, then starts stripping off her armor. "We used to dive in the river water at first thaw, this should not be so different," she explains. When the lady has set aside her clothes with a surprising lack of shame, she makes her way into the icy water.

While Ramar attends to the needs of firewood, the green monk attends to the injured. Her earlier reluctance to use her particular healing talents on the Solar Circle has evaporated with the battle, and she attends to Davron and Chi-Yosh for a few moments. The warmth and comforting closeness of Wood Essence flows into both men as her touch applies itself; she winces briefly as the wounds materialize on her own body, then vanish as her Essence regenerates her body.

The sun, distant and shrouded by the clouds, dips at last beyond the horizon, but sparkles for a moment on the ice of faraway mountains as though winking approval.

Chi-Yosh's appreciation for the healing hands is shown in his face, no need for words spared to the woman in Green. After several moments, he extends his own hand, wet and blood-stained but held in good faith. "My name is Chi-Yosh." To the Gunfighter, patiently waiting for his own seared pains to heal, the Dawn asks, "What do you do to keep the spirits pleased with your weapons? I have heard they war over such things."

The white-haired, white-clad Huntsman glances up from where he sits on a boulder. "I'm a sorcerer," he states, somewhat proudly, though redundantly given the observations of battle. "The Immaculate Order restrains unruly spirits as best it can. I have nothing to fear from them, ordinarily."

Gallius emerges with a rather sharp gasp. She's so cold that she doesn't even shiver as she gets out of the water. The sword she clutches to her in hands that can feel nothing at all, and so she probably can't tell that she's cutting her hands. The lady stands at the lake's edge for a bit and manages to turn her lips into something of a smile, "Got it," she whispers faintly, and then drops to her knees, still holding the blade.

Davron smiles in thanks to the Wood monk, then turns his eyes to the water's edge. "Oh no..." he says, rising to his feet and bundling off his traveling fur as he rushes to Gallius's side, wrapping the fur around her, shivering as the chill wind bites into his flesh - the bronze luster of his skin having faded with the sundown, though that would've provided little protection against the cold in any event. "Oh, Gallius, you and your crazy stunts..." he murmurs, to cover his concern for her.

Ramar returns with dry wood, and the sorcerer murmurs a long incantation, and speaks three sharp words over the assembled kindling. It bursts into flames, satisfyingly hot and comfortingly bright in the dim light of incipient twilight. The green monk turns her attentions now to Ramar, removing the pain of his wounds slowly and absorbing that hurt into herself before the power of the Wood Dragon erases the injuries again.

"... Dipped in water from a pure stream, and the Five Names of the Fire Dragon," explains the gunman, speaking to Chi-Yosh and illustrating with his particular weapons. "The Ascending Name, then the Reluctant Name, then the Averse Name, then the Relentless Name, and finally the Descending Name in that order. Such protections will not ward against mundane fire, though."

"Thank you," murmurs Ramar to the Wood monk. He touches the skin where the wounds had been momentarily, and then asks, "How do you do this?" He then notices Gallius wrapped in fur... presumably Davrons. He asks, "Are you two alright? You can have my furs if you'd like... the cold does not bother me in the least."

Chi-Yosh nods sagely to the Occultist, a wary chuckle finding him. "We found that out earlier." He takes a good look at the weapon - even if he had a great view at it as before. "The Realm knows of keeping Spirits in line. But I seek, soon, to draw some Spirits and creatures of the Elements, perhaps-" He trails off, spotting Gallius. "We will speak later." Rising, "Davron, move her joints."

Davron has returned to the fire-side with the insensate Gallius carried over his shoulder, the daiklave first carefully pried from her bleeding fingers. He sets her down as gently as he can manage amidst his own shivering, and, nodding to Chi-Yosh, does as he suggests, and also applies his own knowledge, chafing her limbs to try to stimulate the circulation, and everything else he can think of. He shivers as he works, doing his best to ignore the cold, and barely notices when Ramar's fur drops over his own shoulders.

The green monk approaches, carefully. She examines Davron's efforts, then Gallius as she lays, freezing. Then she turns back to the roaring blaze her compatriot had summoned up, and thrusts two fingers into it, drawing out heat from it. Just as quickly her fingers dart to Gallius' body, striking seven pressure points in quick succession and carrying the temperature of the comforting blaze into the nexus points of the Solar's body. Then she draws back. Over time, as Davron applies his knowledge of medicine and leverages his startling intellect, a combination of persistence, dedication, lore and passion rouse the war-leader from her half-conscious daze.

Gallius awakens from her stupor with a gasp and her eyes blink rapidly. For a moment, she sits up straight, then slumps somewhat, as exhaustion hammers away at her. "My father would be proud," she murmurs softly. Calling upon her endurance once more, she reaches out to reclaim the sword and turns to present its proper owner, offering the hilt to him. "This is yours," she says simply. And turning to the green monk she says warmly, "Thank you."

The knight receives his weapon without immediate comment, while the monk shakes her bald head. "I only struck the proper chakras. It was your friend's commitment to your life that mattered," she states.

"We should rest around here. Our journey back will be easier if we rest until we're well ready to leave the next morning. I have to wonder though..." Ramar asks the nearest of the huntsman, "How long do we have before your friend aboard the ship reports our position to your superiors and more are sent to... rescue you?"

"There will be no rescue," says the knight. "We're expected to return on our own if we must; we're also capable of it." He carefully sheathes the massive weapon on his back, waiting for Gallius to regain herself a little more before he speaks.

Ramar nods slowly, then turns towards Gallius. He smiles softly, "Are you alright? You should rest, now that we are free to make our shelter where we wish. I will..." His voice trails off, and he turns to Davron, "Perhaps we should see if we can salvage any of this wreckage and return with it come sunrise."

Chi-Yosh puts a hand on Ramar's shoulder. "Let us stave off, for now. We have brought one from the icy grips of the lake; let us not make it two before the night is through?"

Ramar chuckles, "I mean to say, that when the sunrises, we shall have to see about salvaging some of the wreckage... I'm not going to try tonight."

Gallius slowly regains herself and lets out a sigh. "Proper chakras," she murmurs. "Well, thank you nonetheless." She lets out a soft sigh, "I feel better, now, thank you all." She nods to both Chi-Yosh and to Davron. "I.." She pauses. "Where are the others? Where are my people?" she asks. She forces herself to stand and looks around, not ready to try her legs for walking just yet. "Do not tell me they are dead?"

Davron is too relieved that Gallius is alive, and conscious, to respond to the wood monk's words. "As long as we don't have to swim back, that's all I ask," he murmurs, with a faint smile. Then the cold he'd been ignoring returns in a rush, and pulls the blanket around him tighter. "Even if we could salvage the engine - which we most certainly should do, though hopefully with a little more careful planning - I don't think it could take us anywhere. This lake seems to be short one decent shipyard."

In time, the Scavenger Lands soldiers return to the lake, warily, with weapons drawn. They too are bloody, but all are alive. Upon seeing the Mad Wolves' corpses, their distress evaporates and they tell their tale. They fled the battle, only to find one of the beasts scouting about the area. Only now have they felt safe in returning. Their leader, Snowburn, offers a brief prayer to the gods as he settles before the fire.

Ramar moves to help Gallius when she stands. "Rest. They are alive. Keep warm, at least until the night is through." He nods to the Scavenger Lands soldiers when they return, "Come, warm yourselves by the fire. We'll worry about food tomorrow. And then we'll figure out the way home. Let's get some rest. I'll stay up and help keep watch."

"First though... we'll need some shelter." Ramar stands on wearied legs, wincing for a moment. He surveys the lakeshore, spends a moment following the waterline. As a light snow begins to fall, he watches the trees... listening to them whisper and sway about in the breeze. "We can find shelter in there... we'll follow the slope of the water down towards the lake... I'll be willing to bet that near where the roots come up to catch the runoff... we can find a suitable spot shielded from the wind. I can fix up a snow-block for us... but we may have to dig our way out in the morning."

Given time, the combined party, spearheaded by Ramar and Davron, locate a low cliff-side on the lee of the wind. The daiklave of the knight - Mountainheart by name - and the orichalcum naginata Gallius wields slice through the trunks of nearby trees as though they were so much rice paper, and in short order a shelter of a kind is established.

---

Night passes. A second fire is started; the smoke drifts upward through the branches of the trees, while beneath the comforting canopy, the men and women of the combined group discuss their options.

After time, the two disparate groups - one a Solar Circle, the other a sworn brotherhood of Dragon-Blooded - gain a measure of comfort with each other. Mountainheart, their leader, is a strong warrior whose sword is second to nothing in power. Maiel, the haughty woman with the feathered cloak, says little. Spring Lotus, the green monk, and Zephyr, the archer, are the oldest Immaculate members of this group of Huntsmen. Vanda is the black monk, the newest addition to the brotherhood and a former teacher on the Blessed Isle. The sorcerer and gunman, Ice, is virtually unique in that he was once an outcaste, born off the Isle and outside the Dynasty altogether.

The alternatives the Circle faces are political in character - return to Yurgen's village, a Solar refuge, or seek out Cherak, a state on the Northern Threshold's coastline loyal to the Realm. In the end, Ramar speaks in favor of returning to the old Solar, and there is not enough dissent to overrule him. Their fate in the short term decided, the group agrees upon watches amongst themselves, stock up on wood for the fire, and bed down for the cold night.

---

The Guildsman smiles, and for perhaps one in five times since the Guild's inception, a deal of such a magnitude has been closed without jade or silver trading hands. "You've been a great assistance," announces the merchant-prince, as he sits back and reaches for a crystal decanter. "Some wine, perhaps?" His visitor, demure in her seat, simply folds her hands over her lap and makes a show of rearranging her robes. "Yes, thank you."

The man smoothly pours two goblets, and savors the aroma of his drink after returning the decanter to the hands of the slave who bore it. "The knowledge that this upstart Nation is controlled by the same people who thwarted our ambitions in Greyfalls will make me a very rich man," he says at last, and takes a drink before continuing. "The revolt will be instigated on schedule. But tell me.. why did you honor me with such a revelation?" To this question his visitor coughs, and composes her thoughts before speaking. "Let us say that you have a great destiny to fulfill, and in doing so you will help me fulfill mine."

"Very well. May I be of any further assistance?" To this the woman shakes her head, and rises, setting her goblet down. "I'm afraid not. I have a war to avert now. Please excuse me." And so saying, she takes leave of the Guildsman, who only smiles, rapt in visions of avarice.
