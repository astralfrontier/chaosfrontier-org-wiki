The meeting is set to take place some two day's journey west of the current border of the Nation of the Sun. Which isn't near as close to Lookshy as Gallius would like, in a way. These borders are like a suffocating blanket to her. She will have room to breath. She needs people to get people, and needs friends to make them. Luckily has has a way to get allies. Power. The first things the men of Lookshy will see as they arrive is an airship. The next will be the royal warstrider, looming above the large tent that was set up for this occasion. The accomodations are remarkably comfortable, considering the location. Gallius herself awaits the people of Lookshy dressed in the best her people have to offer. Each bit of clothing shows respect to one custom or another, so that at first one might think her a patchwork creation, but together they somehow blend together, forming a pattern that the eye comes to perceive in time.

Around Gallius are men and women from the Nation, each dressed nearly as well as their Queen. They are a diverse lot. One man clearly a warrior, the woman at his side a noblewoman, the old couple near them leaders of two towns drawn together by their marriage, the circumstances of which were largely provided by Gallius herself. They are all silent, all waiting for their guests to appear.

Upon the appointed hour, the distant howl of engines can be heard. In the sky can be seen a boxy shape emerging from the clouds in the distance. On its port and starboard sides are the heraldry of Gens Kirigasa and the emblem of Lookshy - a wavy-bladed sword whose resemblance to a river is more than coincidental. The craft is flanked by half a dozen "flying manta" vehicles, all visibly armed. After signalling non-belligerence with signal flashes of light, the craft and its escorts land. Soldiers dismount from the mantas, fanning out to provide a cordon of security. A hatch on the starboard side of the transport opens, and people begin stepping out.

Kirigasa Kosu herself - the matron of Gens Kirigasa, a minor house in Lookshy's political tapestry - is first. The Earth-aspected Terrestrial wears an artfully sculpted breastplate of white jade. She carries a shock-lance whose shaft bears the lightly flapping penant of her house. Behind her, and outshining her by far, is an impossibly beautiful being wearing armor of steel so bright that it may as well hold the sun within its depths. She too carries a great and terrible weapon, and Gallius recognizes this being by her jet eyes and silver-gray hair: Sunipa, War Goddess of the East. Other members of the General Staff file out as well, taking position behind the pair.

Gallius waits for all the representatives of Lookshy to arrange themselves before offering a polite bow. "You are welcome here, People of Lookshy," she says first, adding another bow. "You are most welcome here, War Goddess," Gallius intones, bowing deeper. "You are all welcome here. Come, share our shelter from the wind and meet with us." She gestures to the large tent and smiles. The smell of food can be noticed even here. The best her nation has to offer have come.

Kosu inclines her head politely, and approaches. Sunipa follows, a confident half-sneer adorning her exquisite features. The others follow, too, and Kosu makes introductions all around. She defers to Sunipa, who sits first, then finds her own place, and her associates follow, demonstrating without words the social pecking-order. The soldiers waiting beyond retire, organizing picket duty amongst themselves, and out of the corner of her eye, Gallius can see one of them approaching her own men, quietly explaining the disposition of his own men - deferring to the local commander, whose experience is years or perhaps decades below his own, because it is polite to do so. Everything seems to be going smoothly.

Gallius makes a point of sitting last, as is appropriate for the hostess. Her people sit as near to the same time as possible, arranged about her in order of precedence, though it is hard to tell just how she judges such at a glance. The food that has been prepared was done to the standards of the guests, made with the tastes of Lookshy in particular, mixed with a few local dishes to introduce the would-be allies to those who are wishing to work with them.

Before bread may be broken, Gallius speaks for the occasion, lifting a glass of chilled wine. "When I sent word to the wise people of Lookshy I had never expected such a polite and swift response. We will do our best to exceed your expectations and show that your trust is well-placed. I propose a toast to the beginning of a new friendship, one that will protect our people and leave our enemies unable to hinder anything we do."

Kosu and Sunipa raise glasses as well, and their colleagues join in. "To the high ground," the Terrestrial offers, and the others join in. The allusion is an old one amongst the Realm, and even in Lookshy it is understood - the high ground, whether one must defend it or fight one's way to it, expects much of those who would occupy it. The valley is where peaceful men live, but mountains and towers are where peace is maintained.

Gallius nods, taking her drink and smiling the entire time. These are people who work like she does. With only a short time conversations form between those among each side. Interests match well. Gallius has brought those among her people who are not starry-eyed dreamers. They are realists who appreciate those who think likewise. Gallius focuses on her two greatest guests for most of the meal, though none finish without speaking to her for a time. The Queen shows an interest in everything they say, and alludes to many ways she can help make their efforts more lucrative.

Gallius winds up where she starts, settled before the goddess and the terrestrial who stands beneath her in importance. The Queen offers to share with the people of Lookshy her music, and when they assent she draws out the instrument she received in Yu-Shan and begins to play. Knowing her audience well, her music is exciting and swift, providing the thrill of the charge and the glory of war. But even in this she pauses and slows, sharing the pain of loss and death with her music and conjuring images of wars she has fought in.

Gallius' song goes on until day is long lost to night and fires have been set in many places to shed light. When finally silence comes to the air, it is broken for a long time only by the sound of wind. It is likely that none here have heard a solar play, and certainly not on a heaven-wrought instrument.

Though Lookshy's envoys are often accomplished musicians and performers - the city's music is known of, and a soldier's voice is an instrument he carries with him everywhere - they have politely held back, permitting their host the privilege of sharing music first. And as the performance ceases, each rises from his or her place, offering a toast and kind words of appreciation. These poetic nuances are spoken smoothly - words of praise were formulated silently during the recitation, and Gallius can hear echoes of her own music in their choices of phrase. Each sits in his or her turn. Sunipa offers little more than a low, respectful bow. It is clear that she does not disdain the performance; it is merely that she cannot adequately honor it, and realizes this. Her silence is a testament in itself.

Gallius opens up the channels for more official conversation, suggesting in many ways how the Nation of the Sun can be of aid to Lookshy, and what she plans to do in the future. The capital she would build is detailed, this time with the skillful plans of mortals to make her ideas more concrete. She also tells of the ship she wishes to build. A thousand foot long airship, armored with jade, loaded from stem to stern with essence weapons and flooded with places for warstriders that will be able to fly. No matter that she holds just barely enough ground now to have the title of Queen, her words make it seem that all she plans can be achieved with time and effort.

Sunipa is the first to speak of these matters, and her tone is neutral while her Exalted and mortal allies consider mutely. "Do you know the name Dreadful Necessity, Lady Gallius?" her strong and silvery voice asks.

Gallius considers the name for a time, "No, I have not heard of it," she says. She focuses on Sunipa closely, curious of what it is she is speaking of. Perhaps there has been a work of this nature before. If so, she has a feeling that her plans will need to be altered.

"Dreadful Necessity is the warstrider crafted for me," the goddess explains. "Crafted by the same hands that first shaped that which you have brought here." She beckons with a flawless finger in the direction of the royal warstrider. "They are brothers to each other. It is my thinking that they should meet, sometime soon, and become acquainted."

Gallius nods to the goddess. "I am sure a time shall come soon when their powers shall be as one," she replies. "The shadows are kindling a dark fire. There are many enemies, but it is the darkness that I feel shall test our resolve first. Our friends further west will have their hands full elsewhere, I imagine." The Lunars likely shall be tearing apart much of the Realm forces, if their war continues. As it almost inevitably shall, now that Gallius is no longer forced to hinder the work.

Kirigasa Kosu rouses herself from deliberation and speaks, following the goddess' observation and Gallius' reply. "The Lady Sunipa commands several Brass Legionnaires - automata created by the same architect, and his fellows. Lookshy uses them as well. This masterwork was repaired without great effort, I understand. Is it possible that damaged Legionnaires we have will be even less of a challenge?"

"I believe you could say that," says Gallius. "But there is an interest I have in that area. An interest we share. Every moment spent repairing such a work is a moment not spent making a greater device. We need to use our resources to find a way that this may be done without as much effort as it currently requires. I believe together we may be able to do just that."

"I wish to have this repair facility well away from any capital. Wherever it is placed is a target. That is why it should be in an area that is easily defended. Someplace underground seems ideal," says Gallius. "And away from common people and fields. If we are inviting battle anywhere, it should be on our own terms. Beneath a mountain would work well, with easily defended passes and spirits prepared to be favorable to our cause." Gallius barely pauses in her train of thought, a small smile coming to her lips as she turns her mind on the things she is best at.

"Once that is in place, we can turn it into a hub for all war efforts. Docks must be made for ships there, of course. They too will need repairs and resupply. Weapons will be refitted and arms altered as tactics shift." She turns her attention suddenly back to the goddess, "With such a power our people can be far safer. But perhaps a demonstration is in order, so you see that the repairs were not merely cosmetic." The Queen rises, inviting her guests to join her.

Gallius leads the people of Lookshy outside and climbs up into the warstrider. The demonstration has been prepared with great care. Several catapults and ballistae are brought to bear, aiming at the strider. Gallius casually guides the strider to tear a tree from the ground and as the hail of weapons fires itself at her she moves like a whirlwind, blocking every shot with ease, despite the lack of fitting weaponry.

The demonstration of defense is clear, and strength is obvious. Finer details must also be shown. Gallius picks up one of the catapults and rearms it, managing to do so without even breaking a single joint in the weapon. She sets it down for the observers to inspect and then does one last thing. She lifts a boulder and hurls it into the distance, where it crashed and shatters into dust, but not before tearing a huge rent in the landscape.

The reaction of the emissaries from the City of War is judged only by this - their invitation for Gallius and her followers to come to Lookshy itself and face Tien Yu. And in the halls of the city's Dome of Wind and Rain, in the District of Justice, the Solar face the Truthsay of Lookshy's patron goddess. The woman whose skin is black as night and whose hair is the silver sheen of Luna's light, intimidating in her black jade, winds a red ribbon around Gallius' bared and outstretched left arm. And after each intoned question, and each spoken reply, Tien Yu's power painlessly marks the Solar's arm with emblems of truth. Were Gallius to speak lies, the tattoos would become burning brands, marking her as an oathbreaker. Instead, those tattoos that are now left serve as a sign to all who Gallius may show them to in the future: "this woman has been tested by Lookshy and found true to her word."

"As you can see, the benefits are clear," says Celin. The female dragon blood smiles widely as she goes on. "Those flying the colors of the Nation pay normal duties, those who do not pay twice the rate. In addition, the road system and river defense project will reduce losses to bandits, which will increase your profits even more."

The small group listening to her are not nobles, but merchants. The council of their town was not invited to this little meeting. The commercial powers are the ones who really decide things. Celin has been to few towns where anything else is the case. Silver is policy, or jade, depending on where you trade. The eyes of the merchants glass for a moment as each does mathematics for a few moments. Grins spread from one to another as they see profits shooting higher than ever.

One does not so quickly give in, however. "And what of the bandits in the air?" asks an older man. "What do you mean to do with the vultures?"

"The hawkriders will be kept out of your hair, of course," says Celin. "The Nation is preparing to deal with them in a manner that shall put an end to all the danger they bring." She smiles in a way that makes that matter seem almost trivial. With a calm smile she goes on, "The Hawk Riders are being drawn into the Nation even as we speak. They are learning swiftly that they are not the true masters of the sky." It is at this moment that the roar of airships flying low over the building can be heard.

When the merchants peer outside, they see a pair of airships, doing maneuvers in the sky while smaller forms fly about them. None of them have seen volos before. Settling back at their table, they spend the rest of the night planning just how they will bend the will of the council in the correct direction. The Nation of the Sun has far too many commercial benefits to be ignored.

The fires in the pit burnt ever lower, and the men sitting around it frown over mugs of ale. "Tomorrow we will surrender," says the eldest amongst them. "The Lioness has beaten us." The others in the room look his way for a moment, and then turn their attention back to their drink. A young woman enters the room, frowning at the lot of them. "Perhaps now you agree with my assessment?" she suggests coolly.

"You did not predict Mealan Hill, Marion," answers the elder. "Three thousand of my best men arrayed against half their number. You did not say how her coming would put terror in our men. You did not say no arrow could bite her flesh. You did not say she would ride a golden horse whose wrath would make the earth scream." The young woman frowns deeply and snorts.

"I told you she was the one, greatuncle," she answers casually. "Now half our men are captives, the rest scattered to the winds, and for what?"

The elder rises and pulls up his spear, growling. "I've listened to the venom on your tongue for the last time!" he bellows, stepping forward to kill the young girl. He pauses suddenly, putting a hand to his throat. Pain explodes in him from head to toe as his blood suddenly boils. All around him the men of his banner jerk and writhe, sending themselves to the floor, their drinks spilling.

As the bodies grow still Marion laughs out loud, her voice full of joy. "Ahh, such fools to forget that I am the Raven! You remember the better, now, don't you? Ahh, well, I will understand if you don't quite sing my praises right now. Death takes so much from a man, doesn't it?"

Marion has the bodies seen to and extracts herself from the hall, settling on her next duty. Timas is still in a bed, recovering from wounds when she finds him. It takes some time, of course, but by the time he learns he is to be General of the Fist he knows very well the choice he must make if his people are to survive.

An old woman looks down over a balcony that stands some hundred paces above the city market below. Her withered hands grip tightly as she speaks. "You will protect my people from the bandits?" she asks. The iron in her voice demonstrates the power that her spirit holds. Queen Gallius Leom answers calmly, "Yes. The hawkriders are being pacified. Those who will not change will be driven away. Those who will change shall become useful allies to the Nation. Your people will be safe."

Esmeralda turns at this and considers the Solar Queen for a time. "You are not trying to trick me." It is not a question. "I see that my people will be safe, and many problems will be solved. Our trade disputes will be no more, our border troubles will all be settled. From what you've said thus far it would seem we come out quite well in all these matters. Our taxes will even be reduced. It is an impressive offer."

"I would like to say it is a fair offer," replies Gallius. "Your people are honest and peaceful and deserve a respite from the trouble that has plagued them. The Silver Spring will be pacified as soon as my mystics can arrive, of course. Having such chaotic things so near the city is hardly what any of us want."

Esmeralda nods, "Indeed. Seeing it die before I.. Yes, it should be taken away." The woman frowns, saying no more. It was that wyld zone that stole her youth. For the last forty years, since her sixteenth birthday, she has appeared as a withered old woman thanks to a brush with that area.

It is only after messages are sent to the hawkriders that the Queen of the Nation of the Sun comes to meet them. Her honor guard consists of many of the people of her realm, and a spattering of advisors, brought here to handle the necessary details of any new state that should join the nation. This mission is both an attempt of maintaining peace and a quiet warning of what might come.

Gallius comes dressed as a warrior. These are not soft men, from what she has heard, and so she will show them the steel of the woman who would be queen. She will be the first off the airship, and all others follow. Another message put bluntly. If they expected a soft woman, she hopes to disappoint them.

Mount Metagalapa is miles across; over the centuries since its ascension the occupants have done great things to maximize the livable land-area. While by no means a flat plane, the mountain is divided into tiers, connected by broad stone staircases up the hillsides. A landing area for the great hawks now plays host to the airship, under the watchful eyes of ballistae and other siege weapons emplaced to deter aerial intruders. There is no doubt these weapons could interfere with efforts to leave, but the truce is honored. The Dragon-Blooded have come to dominate this culture over its lifespan; like all the works of the Terrestrial Exalts, dishonesty is permitted but dishonor is not. The party moves peacefully up the staircases, crossing one tier after another in their approach toward one of the stone mansions that serve as homes to these aerial people.

Gallius takes note of what she sees and smiles to herself. Quite well designed. Terraces to make the best use of what little land and water they have, and very good guards. She hopes she doesn't really have to work against such people. It would be a pitiful waste.

The advisors and guards Gallius has brought take a look around and make notes of things to bring up later. The terraces, though made fairly well, could be improved upon. They already have a list of suggestions to offer, and the trademasters she have brought make not of the current dock, finding it adequate, but with room to improve. They keep quiet for now, speaking only when necessary, but keeping an eye out for possible chinks in the armor of these hawkriders.

At the pinnacle of the climb, in front of the mansion of rock and cedar, stands a delegation. Three women and two men are there, all with Caste Marks aflame as a banner of their station. None are attired in jade, though each carries a heavy-hafted weapon of some kind, slung loosely over the shoulder and with bundles of feathers hanging from the pommels. Flanking them are twenty more warriors, each lightly armored and bearing longbows with similar feathers fastened near the tips. "Strangers, we welcome you in peace," calls one woman, stepping forward and inclining her head politely. "We are Erid, Huma, Desa, Plin and Mont," she says, gesturing to herself first and then the others in turn. "We speak for Mount Metagalapa."

Gallius steps forward alone, speaking clearly, "I am Gallius Leom, Zenith Caste and Queen of the Nation of the Sun. These are my people, and we have come peacefully and wish to create a greater peace with your people as we prepare to guard ourselves from the darkness that is rising."

Erid gestures to the mansion behind her. "Then come. We will eat and talk."

---

Gallius allows herself to be lead to the mansion, walking easily despite the heavy armor. She doesn't plan on letting any here forget what she is, nor what she represents. She will bring them peace, but she imagines it will be a matter of dragging them there by the scruffs of their necks. And even then much war will come first.

Once inside the mansion, Gallius wastes no time. "We have come here to settle numerous issues. I appreciate formalities, but I believe this is not the time for them. The current situation that exists between your people and your neighbors is causing instability. This cannot last, all things in motion must come to some resting state. The state of events and the current motion of occurances seems to indicate that your people will at best be seriously harmed by those who have tired of your interference. Even in victory the cost shall be high."

"The Haltans seems most eager to deal with you in unpleasant ways, but they are far from alone. Once they prepare an adequate force I am quite sure new allies shall spring up in many places," Gallius says. "However, such a war would no doubt trouble my lands, and I would be rather displeased if I had to destroy two armies simultaneously to protect my people from two flailing armies." Her words are even and steady, but their is a steel to them that her eyes match. "And so I come here to offer you a way to avoid this conflict. It will not be easy, but my advisors are used to stealing peace from the hounds of war."

Erid and Huma draw their heads together, discussing in whispers, before the latter pulls back to give a reply. "The Kingdom of Halta has the Linowan to deal with," she answers with a confident smile. "And however impressive their balloons - or whatever they use - may be, even their vaunted Home Guard cannot fly far." Gallius, however, notes the flicker of eyes around the table; this bluff lacks the conviction of some of those assembled.

Gallius frowns thoughtfully. "The Kingdom of Halta might decide that they would do very well with the Linowan if their army were to suddenly enlarge. They might find many who would see such an arrangement very favorable. To no longer fear raids at the small cost of supplying men. Men who will be trained and paid, and when they return, they will be available for use against neighbors. And those neighbors will see that threat, of course, as well... it is indeed a strange cycle that power can lead us on, is it not?"

Desa speaks up now. "Who did you approach first, the Haltans or us?" she demands, simply. "What are you trying to broker here?"

"I have come to you," says Gallius. "Because you are near us, and I see more hope in speaking with you than with them." She casually shifts to the real point, "The Nation of the Sun has many things. A great future is one of them. If you were to join us, that future would come much sooner and you would benefit greatly from it. No more forced commerce. You would be welcome at any of our cities. Perhaps in time even Lookshy will be warmer towards your people, but time will be required to heal old wounds. I promise that I can prevent your enemies from tearing you apart and give you that time."

"How do you intend to keep that promise?" asks Erid, speaking again. These people seem to be rather plain-spoken and straightforward, and even the wily Terrestrial Exalts among them appear most interested in results first.

"I have allies and forces that they will keep them where they belong," says Gallius. She will have to speak with Yurgen sometime soon and see just what he has managed on his own. He might be very helpful in taming these more distant enemies that keep bothering her. "And with the aid of Lookshy they will hesitate to attack any territory that is part of the Nation of the Sun. And there are other things I might show you, if you wish to see a more martial display."

There are five nods of simultaneous agreement to this notion; the Dragon-Blooded rulers here are apparently of like enough mind that little consultation is required.

The demonstration is held far below. The royal warstrider once again is put to use by Gallius. This time she has selected an old abandoned fortress. First she hurls a rock that crushes half the north wall, then she juggles three boulders, and then she just walks righ up and stomps the entire structure flat in a matter of moments. In the wake of the display, trade negotiations begin. At first, just enough to keep the peace. Only with full membership can the matter of taxes be permenantly settled. For now, Gallius will rely on her people to make the fair arrangement she requires for now.

The Hawkriders are impressed by strength, but not easily impressed; nevertheless, they are aware that the royal warstrider, and units like it, are much easier to muster against forces like Halta's Home Guard than they are against the Mountain. Knowing this, the Hawkriders mount their steeds and fly off, throwing down a sealed scroll behind them. In it is a letter drafted by Erid and her companions, offering truce and fair trading to the villages surrounding the eastern mountains as long as the arrangement with the Nation will last. It is a peace-offering from Metagalapa, and it will be useful.
