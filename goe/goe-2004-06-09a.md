"Three dreams you asked for," replies Ramar, as his gaze drifts lazily into memories and images of the past. "I dreamt once, of walking out atop the sea, moving to the water's edge, where the sea and sky touch. I dreamt of the tide of clouds that pulled the tides of water with it. The cool waters of the deepest ocean rippled beneath my feet, and I ascended the clouds. The clouds beneath me were as cool as the waters, and just as solid. Among the clouds, there were Essence-driven automata, who carried out with mechanical precision the task of constructing city after city within the clouds..."

"And in these cities, lived the children of the air and water. I dreamt that I walked among them, that they took me into their city and taught me to emrge with the sky. I became a cloud floating over Creation." Ramar pauses, andlets the dream settle in with the Fair Folk guardians, "The second dream began in a palace of marble and iron."

"The palace itself twisted and grew as I walked its hallways. I could feel it beneath my feet, twisting and changing. Somehow I knew that it was taking root in the ground below, that beneath the surface of creation this palace was drawing in what it needed to survive. I walked onto a turret-branch, and there I saw growing the fruits of dreams. A dove flew in through a window and led me down to the heart of the palace, where the tellers of the first tales argued amongst one another about whose version of their story was correct. So long did they argue, that when I asked, they could not remember their tale." Ramar pauses once more, "And then I awoke."

"In the third dream, a garden maze stretched out before me, encompassing the entirety of Creation. As I wandered the hedge-maze and followed the dirt pathways, I became aware that all at once in this place, were ruins of times long past, and haunting images of things to come, as though all of fate had come to meet in this one fertile plot. I opened an alabaster door and stepped into the night sky. Stars shone all around me, illuminating my path as I began to travel to the stars themselves. Some were actually living creatures, who burned in the heavens long before mortal memory can recall, and others were mere motes of light that I collected and kept in a bag. While I travelled the starry sky, I encountered another traveller."

"The traveller's cloak was as the night sky, and when I gazed further, I saw that the stars were not merely reflected within, but recreated... and I found myself drawn to a star... the star I walked near. Near it I could see myself and the traveller. The traveller's hat contained three thousand secrets, each engraved upon the last. The eyes were emeralds that burned brightly. When the traveller spoke, it was in lilting music, as haunting as any forest.

"I asked the traveller where we were, and received nothing more than a laugh as an answer. The world began to spin, and I found myself sitting down to take tea with a beast of scaled feathers, and soft teeth. As we drank the tea, I found myself slowly drifting to sleep, and when at last I felt the last vestiges of consciousness giving way..." Ramar grins, "I woke up."

The guards incline themselves. "You are welcome in our city," one says, and reaching out with a hand, he presses open the gates and admits the Solars - Chi-Yosh, Davron, Ramar, and their newly found companion Sun-and-Moon - into what waits beyond.

Peering beyond the swinging gates, Chi-Yosh turns to his homeland kin. "I fear that beyond is not safe for you. The stress of this place, the bonds and requests they may ask of us, you may not be able to give. I will bring back everything I can, but I am sorry that you cannot follow." The two show an expression of insult and dissapointment, but they nod in respect. "We understand." Turning, they walk back towards the ship.

The gates open readily, and a faint musical tinkling, as with chimes or bells, fills the air with their passage. Their solidity is undeniable, and yet they slide open as easily as the veil over the face of a beautiful woman. Lions of sculpted ebony flank the avenue that leads inside. The depths of their eyes seem to flicker with something as the Solars pass, but they make no overt move, for at the moment they remain merely statues. Overhead, the sky is clear. The clouds themselves circle in a ring, ascending into the sky in deferential distance from the centermost feature of the city: a grand spire of imperishable glass.

The avenue is cobbled with stones of solidified rainbow; the faint mist of the departing rainstorm that created the varicolored stones can be felt rising from them, and a faint tingle of the long-gone thunder excites the hairs on the skin of the Exalted. Around them, buildings rise - but not the crude and unfinished efforts of mortal weakness. Here, a hollow tree and its branches make up an intricate, multilevel residence open to the air; there, a hill rises high, with stone steps leading to a door of woven grass and vines. Mansions of beryl and ruby rise on distant hilltops. The Solars can even discern three homes woven of the clouds themselves, and puffs of smoke from chimneys below them organize themselves into steadily-ascending steps that lead to their gauzy front doors.

Oval frames of brass support ornate and heart-breakingly beautiful windows of stained glass. These strange constructs hang unsupported in the air on either side of the avenue, and more can be seen as the byway divides into side-streets. Greens and blues predominate; pastoral scenes, figures of goddesses and mythological figures cavorting together, and artfully-crafted geometric spirals. Sometimes, suggestions of motion on the stained glass itself catch the eye, but like naughty nymphs, these hints of animation conceal themselves from the searching eye.

Chi-Yosh cannot express how he is moved, overloaded in wonder. While the beauty of Yu-Shan is one that will stay with him, the sights of this city engrave themselves in his mind, senses lit like a blaze at everything. The scents and sensations of the storm passing underfoot, the sights of epics played across the air-displayed windows, homes of nothing and everything around him. This truelly is a City of Dreams. He wants to walk every street and speak to every citizen, to know this place again, as though he might have knew it before. But there is one thing nagging him: where do they go first?

Ramar is suitably impressed by the almost unimaginable buildings. The stained glass catches his eye more than once... "I swear I saw it moving just now..." The Solar shakes his head and tires to remember to shut his mouth every now and again. "It is quite fascinating..." Every now and then, as they walk down the streets of rainbow, Ramar rubs at his eyes, to make sure he is not still dreaming. "I can see why this is the City of Dreams..."

Davron looks around him, wide-eyed - although he has seen many wonders in the handful of months since his Exaltation, he has not often seen such variegated diversity in architecture. Even the wonders of Yu-Shan were... different. Majestic, perhaps, rather than the fantastic constructions here. "What hands made these..." he murmurs to himself, "if hands they were..."

The city is not merely a decorative sculpture cased in glass and sky for a curious child to stare into. The Fair Folk are here in number, noble and commoner and servant alike. Handfuls of half-formed hobgoblins, the footsoldiers and slave-caste of the Wyld-spawn, pad from place to place dressed in their rude garments. Their deliberate ugliness draws a contrast to the resplendent city around them; one cannot help but see they were made to stay out of sight. Here, a lean commoner with the antlers of a buck walks by, robed in garments that ripple like water. There, the burly frame of a worker strains as he lifts a heavy slab of stone in the construction of another mansion, his equine features glistening with the sweat of the day's labors. The fragile beauty of a songbird is seen in the face and eyes of an entertainer who sings her entrancing songs on a street-corner and sells flowers formed of solidified sunlight from a basket slung on her arm.

Chi-Yosh, after a time of just taking in the sights, is reminded of his purpose by the weight of the talisman about his shoulders. They are here to find the purpose of this place regarding Lesell; what hand did she have here? What reason did the Solar have with a city of the Fair Folk? Looking over the skyline, a great glass spire that grabs the sunlight and plays with it like a toy juts higher than any around, and that is their target, in hopes it is a capital building of some kind.

The glass spire at the center of the city is merely the tallest of three towers. It stretches quite literally past the clouds, which circle reverently about it in concentric rings of intangible whiteness and spin with clockwork regularity. The triumvirate rise over an immense cathedral of quartz and marble, shining with brilliant light at the center of this fairy-tale city. Its great doors look like enormous human hands, palms outward, hinged at the thumbs.

"I take it then we enter..." Ramar gives a bit of a chuckle as the obligatory comments on the handiness of the door are made. He steps up to the doors and proceeds to open them. He gives a nervous smile, "Well then... let's see what we can find inside."

Within the cathedral is a long walkway, carpeted with what looks like human hair. Blonde, brunette, red, green, blue, violet and white highlights can all be spotted, forming an intricate dance of color underfoot. And at the end of this walkway, lit by torches bracketed in the wall whose flames are tiny fire-sprites wriggling and dancing in endless passion, is the great hall. Its appointments have the spare purity of a holy temple and the evident artistry of a muse's soul.

"I am Arisetani val-Natha," a voice says, and a curtain of nothingness shimmers in the air. The image of the inner hall, which the Solars took to be real, seems to be nothing more than a woven tapestry, which now parts. Beyond is the same great inner hall they witnessed upon entering, but now a woman stands at the center of it. She wears a revealingly cut gown of satin, sparkling with the muted brilliance of lightning-bolts that seem to dance between the diamonds woven into it. Her long and curly hair bears the reddish-chestnut hues of autumn, and her eyes dance with the green of verdant springtime. A pair of vixen's ears extend from her ample tresses; a furry tail, short and shapely, extends behind her and waves rhythmically as she walks forward. Her face is elegant, a thing of beauty that would entice any mortal man.

"You may call me Aris, if it pleases you." Her voice is the soothing breeze on a man's brow that blows away the stinging sweat of a hot day's work, and the warmly comforting splash of sunlight on his cheek. "You are welcome here. If something would give you pleasure, speak of it and I will arrange for it." She offers a half-glimpsed smile as she turns, revealing her flawless figure, and her tail swishes flirtatiously as she begins to lead the way deeper into the cathedral.

Davron bites his lip as the apparition in loveliness turns away - surely one of the Fair Folk, he imagines - his cheeks flushing whether he will or no. He turns to Chi-Yosh, and says, "What can we do but follow?"

While struck by the fae beauty of the woman, Chi-Yosh is not distracted from his journey. Taking up the strings that bare the talisman, he lifts, presenting it better to Aris. "I wish to speak to one who can accept audience with the barer of this seal. If you can arrange a meeting with the master of this city, or one who knows the lifeblood of history this place is made from, it would please me."

Ramar chuckles to himself. _Why is it that beautiful women seem to have tails... or tales._ He follows after Arisa, while keeping a watchful eye on the surroundings. "What a lovely place. Very dreamlike. For how long have you been here," he muses, as a nice complement to Chi-Yosh's query.

Arisetani val-Natha looks at the talisman and offers a knowing smile. "I may have seen it before," she says simply. Her stride never breaks, nor does the movement of her tail change much. She leads the way ever deeper.

"Ah... then it is not certain." Ramar follows, noting that they are getting deeper and deeper into this spire of glass. "Where then are we going? If asking such a thing is permitted, that is."

The woman who would make kingdoms fall with just a glance leads on. Here she goes left, there she goes right. A set of stairs up, then a catwalk through the middle of an open chamber, then stairs down again. Things grow ever harder to follow, and at one point she takes three rights in a row and ascends where they surely had just been. Only after she has taken many such turns does she speak again, "We are going further." Her words are a soft purr, and she turns to deliver them to Ramar with a teasing smile. Her motions somehow grow more enticing, hinting at every curve, and inviting the eye to caress her form.

"Are we now," Davron mutters, with as much skepticism as he can muster. The Davron that watches over his actions grows ever more worried about the reactions of his all-too-human (and all too male) instincts to the faery queen. But... again, there are few choices other than to go on, or to go back empty-handed. "Lead on, then," he says out loud.

Several kingdoms are likely to fall, in fact, though other things may be raised in their place. New civilizations and everything. "Er... h-how much further are we going," asks Ramar, rather tentatively _Clearly, everything about this shape is designed to entice the eye. Clearly her every action is designed to attract, or perhaps distract..._ Ramar turns to glance at the surroundings, though the fairy-queen's beauty is impossible to ignore. _At least the only trap we seem to be falling for is the obvious one._

Chi-Yosh is wary. The ways of the Fae are tricky, seeking to draw others in with their powers of seduction or promises of power, to get what they want. It takes willpower and a careful step to deal with them, or at least with Aris. Despite the banquet before, the Dawn is determined. Beauty may be found in any corner of Creation and beyond, but this is the only place that he seeks the knowledge Lesell has graced the world with.

The leading goes on for some time. Or perhaps it doesn't. Time fades somehow, in this place. Aris leads on, never changing, never pausing to consider which way to go. Going back now would take something of a miracle. She finally stops at a large door made of silver and pushes it open. Beyond lays a room as dark as any night. She leads on as confidently as ever, of course.

As the last of the Solars steps into the room, the doorway vanishes behind them. Their feet touch something soft, like a cushion they are walking across. As their eyes grow accustom to the dim, they can make out pinpricks of light above their heads, and in time, each Solar may come to realize that they are seeing the stars. Casting their eyes down they can see to the left and right breaks in the floor, and far below, lit only by stars, is an enormous body of water, stretching as far as can be seen. Aris is still ahead, but now she wears nothing but starlight and cloud, her body revealed more than ever, and her smile ever more playful. She says nothing, but the motion of her tail changes, growing more relaxed in its swaying motion.

Ramar blinks a few times as he steps out into the stars. When Aris' clothing shifts, the Solar's eyes seem to widen. "This is... quite impressive. A room of starlight here within the City of Dreams." He looks around carefully, curious as to the breaks in the floor, and he then asks, "What are we to do in this place, this sky upon the ground, if this is indeed what it is?"

Chi-Yosh takes in his surroundings slowly. An illusion, like the tapestry in the cathedral? Or if it is real, then the city truelly is of dreams. Upon spying Aris, the Dawn is tempted to jump down to the water below, to test this theory, or at least break the spell. Instead, he merely smiles to her, scooping up the throng attached to the talisman's pot, and lifts it up to sway side-to-side. "I hope the one I seek audience with will be along shortly?"

For just a moment the clouds shift, and the gaps in them shut like gates slamming down. A rumble like thunder moves through the room again and again, and then it goes away once more. "Further," she answers, and her teasing smile returns as if it had never missed a beat, though for just a moment, to the discerning eye, the fair maiden seemed rather displeased.

Aris leads on, and goes down a winding stair of cloud. Down, down, ever further. Finally the landing of the stair comes, so long that most would wonder if hours had passed, and yet the sensation of exertion or exhaustion never comes. Aris steps from the clouds right onto the surface of the ocean, which is an unyielding to the foot as marble, though its motions are like waves yet no one will find standing any more difficult here than on more stable ground.

Ramar raises a curious eyebrow as he walks atop the clouds. _Much like in the dreams I described... yet for a moment, the lady looked displeased..._ "Er... have we done something wrong?" There's a curious tone in his voice as the new surroundings capture his attention. _This is uncanny. Almost exactly like the dream I described... I cannot help but wonder..._

Waiting here is a stocky, muscular being. He is darkly handsome, with the strong and resolute face that marks a warrior. His mail is forged of interlocking drops of water, and the great sword slung over his back glistens darkly with menace. His long hair is the grey of the wolf's coat, bound back in a rough ponytail tied with a dragon's whisker, and his fingernails and teeth hint at sharp points. "I am Olorudomu val-Natha," announces his gruff, weathered voice, with the sound of the cold north wind that blows. "Call me Olo. You will come with me." He raises a strong-looking hand, clenching it closed into a fist, and his words brook no dissent.

"Very well then, Olo." Ramar bows to Aris before the group of Solars are to take their leave of the beautiful fae, "Farewell." To Olo, he asks, "Where are we headed now?"

Chi-Yosh offers a proper bow to Olo, and waits patiently at the head of the three Solars. Now he suspects a new test will continue, but, they will see.

"We are heading for the Crystal Heart," the stern warrior announces, then turns on his heel, marching forward without hesitation. His stride is rapid and unflagging; it seems he will permit not even a moment of reluctance.

Davron breathes a soft sigh as he turns away from Aris - is it a sigh of relief or Disappointment? Probably equal measure of both. Olo's martial bearing, at least, is something he feels more able to deal with, if things were to go awry. Davron follows, his shoulders relaxing even as he keeps pace.

"What is the Crystal Heart," asks Ramar, as they continue forward, moving much further than Ramar might have guessed. Or perhaps barely moving at all. The Solar does keep up the unslowing pace, "And what shall we do once we are there?"

"You will stop wasting our time and explain what it is you are here for," replies Olo, sounding gruff and unpleasant. "Unless you'd prefer to go back and admire Aris for a bit longer." His tone of voice suggests barely-buried hostility at the idea.

Olo continues the journey. He leads the way down halls whose walls are covered in tapestries whose contents seem to be operating in slow motion. He guides the Solars through streaming jets of starlight that streak through the black sky of night. His footfalls echo in a hall of iron whose walls are composed entirely of metal doors and which all seem hinged together. And at the end, he opens a wide pair of wooden doors, and the Solar party is bathed in light.

Three crystal thrones sit at the center of the circular chamber; three shafts of light, guided from the sun above through the triple spires, conspire to clothe each in a radiant veil of illumination. And on the center throne is a being of indeterminate gender. His_her hair is stark white, white as the snows of winter, and his_her face holds all of the tender details of age without bearing a whit of the deformities of it. There is experience graven on that face, and wisdom sparkles like faceted precious gems in his_her eyes. "I am Efelcielumed val-Natha," speaks his_her voice, with the soft touch of tree branches rustling in the wind. "You may call me Efel." He_she rises from the throne, touching a hand to his_her androgynous features and then using it to make a flowing, rolling gesture from the brow.

Chi-Yosh is struck by the features of the throne room. THe sun itself veiling the Wyld-borne creatures, and the image itself leaves him unsure if it is the twist of their magic, or an indirect blessing from a servant to the Unconquered Sun. Either way, the Dawn offers a deep bow in respect to Efel, in the same motion sparking the Caste mark on his brow. "I am Chi-Yosh, of the Su'Katan." Cupping the talisman in hand, he lifts the potted gem and orichalcum flower for a better view. "I come with the seal of Lesell, plucked from her blessed tomb. I wish to know how she touched this place long ago. Her significance in this wondrous city."

Olo takes his place on one throne, to the left of that on which Efel rested. A curtain rustles and Aris emerges from behind it, taking her own position on the throne opposite. Efel retires to his seat with the heavy grunt of an old man, then crosses her feet at the base of the throne, adopting the stately dignity of a dowager empress. Four hands and a thumb gesture, describing perfect arcs in the air, conveying the very essence of invitation with their every stroke. Such a small gesture - the essence of brevity compared to "continue, please, to explain, for I am curious to hear more", and yet the half a heartbeat of time it took to execute was sufficient to communicate the same message.

With such a graceful gesture, Chi-Yosh can do nothing but comply. "Lesell once graced three cities. Demandsor, Lookshy, and your domain, in the First Age. She had a cult that worshipped her, and in her death, the cult stayed around her tomb. That cult was then re-founded by other settlers, one who bore the symbol of Lesell. I am from that village that surrounds her tomb, and discovering that fate has had our sparks pass by, I would like to understand the legacy of this woman, for it is her work that has touched my destiny."

Three fingers idly brush the air like strokes over a lover's cheek, and Elef's elegant simplicity again suggests his intentions - "who are those with you?" Nevertheless Olo deigns to speak before his fellow receives an answer. "Lesell is a name that we know. She was no beloved friend to us, and we rejoice in her passing," he mutters grimly. Aris is more understanding, and her soft and soothing voice adds a harmony of compassion to the grim refrain of the merciless warrior. "Nevertheless you have done us no ill.. perhaps there are ways for you to learn what you must?"

Chi-Yosh introduces his Circle-mates. "Davron and Ramar, both of the Unconquered Sun and of my Circle." Turning to better gesture to the female Solar, "This is Sun-and-Moon, an associate of ours we have met only fleetingly, but wished to journey with us here." He waits for each in turn to offer gestures of acknowledgement and greeting, before continuing. "Anything that you might give me is aid I will appreciate. This is a mystery I wish to solve. I apologize if the rememberance of Lesell is trouble to you, if she had not been a benevolent associate."

"The mystery of Lesell?" asks Elef, carefully, with a hint of a smile. "Of who she was, and what she left behind here?" Aris leans over, touching a perfect hand to Elef's knee, and speaks softly, though audibly enough. "Perhaps the questor should see the guardian tree? I will.. entertain the others." To this Elef gives no dissent, and gestures. "Olo will guide you there if you wish. The guardian tree, it is said, defended Lesell's inner sanctum. Defeat or destroy it, and you may find the answers you need. It is a product of Solar magic, and we wish to have no part of it."

"And is there any reason why all four of us should not visit the tree?" Davron asks. His tone is polite, but he is troubled by the idea of being separated from his Circle-mates, here in the heart of a Fair-Folk city... as well as the belated realization that being here at all is peril enough.

"If it is your quest, then you may of course brave the danger with your friend," replies Elef. "But we have found that one may approach safely, while those who come in force are attacked."

For her part, Sun-and-Moon has been quiet. She has followed meekly where her new companions have walked; she has obeyed without question or response the invitations offered. Now she stands somewhat apart, fitful and uncertain of where she is or why she is there. Nevertheless her faith in her newfound companions seems to hold fast. Trust is written on her features.

Chi-Yosh turns to share a gaze with his friends. Silently he's aware of their concern and the potential threat they face while entertained apart from him. But it's clear to them he is going, with or without. Turning back to Olo, he gives a solid nod, before stepping forward. "Lead on. Thank you, Elef."

While Aris slinkily rises from her throne, approaching the three remaining Solars, the dour warrior beckons impatiently. Again he leads the way through the myriad chambers of the Cathedral, none at all like any of the others. The architecture of the place defies description or memorization, and in Chi-Yosh there grows a sense that the place is indeed a maze intended to confound those who brave it without a guide. And at last Olo descends a rough-hewn set of stone steps that exit out into a great underground cavern.

At the center of this grotto is a lake of red, with the consistency of blood to the eye, but with the scent of spring waters. And at the center of the lake is an island. And growing on that island, with its roots spreading outward to touch almost every bit of the stony edges, is an enormous tree whose bark is crafted of orichalcum and whose leaves are green jade. Golden light shines from the guardian tree, and the leaves lightly wave in an unfelt wind.

Chi-Yosh steps past Olo to the edge of the crimson waters, and steadies himself. Taking a step forward to test the depth of the water, he wades in and when too far to walk, begins to swim, arm over armto the isle. Climbing ashore, dripping red in his wake, the Solar walks towards the tree to stand before it, Essence singing around him.

Chi-Yosh walks around the tree, his body prepped to deal with the potential lethality of a battle. Finally he stands, and lets the Caste mark blaze atop his brow, lifting up the talisman. "Guardian tree, I seek to know of Lesell, and her dealings here. I wish to be allowed into her inner sanctum. Answer me."

Though Chi-Yosh can feel the flows of Essence that course through this strange orichalcum-sheathed wonder, no answer is provided. The tree continues to dominate the island; the jade leaves continue to waver. There is no sign of a door or other entrance into the tree itself, but the Solar's senses can discern a powerful magical force from underneath the roots of the tree.

Chi-Yosh chews on his lower lip in consideration, before falling to his knees. Fingers dig into the dirt at the base of the tree, seeking the power that mingles near the orichalcum plant's roots.

Several minutes of digging yield little but orichalcum roots buried underneath. It seems that the tree truly does control access to whatever may lie beneath it.

Chi-Yosh, after some thinking, attempts something. Taking the talisman from around his neck, he pulls it from the pot, and within the hole he had dug down to the roots, plants the talisman. Without waiting for response, the Solar climbs to his feet and regards the tree itself. It is a work of Solar magic, just like a weapon or any other. So it is possible... Laying a hand upon the trunk, he pushes his power into it, to see if he can gain control of its' nature.

It takes several minutes - it seems the tree itself is entirely composed of orichalcum, for no lesser mass would require so much time and careful attention to attune. But the Solar nevertheless harmonizes his anima with the structure. Slowly he gains an awareness of something - dozens, then hundreds, of entities around him, present somehow in this grotto. There is a hollow lifelessness to their aspects, and their whispers can be heard in the back of his mind.

The voices whisper of things Chi-Yosh has seen above: of mansions in the clouds, of crystal windows and rainbow-hued streets. They speak of seas of stars, chambers of iron doors, blossoming flowers whose petals lead the way to universes.. some of their thoughts remind the Solar of rooms he has seen in the Cathedral itself. Then there are others, voices that whisper of pain and torment, of agony and death, of a slaughter whose byproduct was a sea of blood that could have drowned the city.

By focusing his attention, Chi-Yosh neglects those more pedestrian voices that speak of places. He listens instead to those that whisper of times - and a time, centuries past, when a crazed demon decimated the population of a region and consigned their souls to her blessed tree. They whisper of the old souls that had once lived in the tree, those that spoke with wisdom while they lived and were rewarded in death with governance of an empire. And when the demon abandoned thoughts of justice, that which had been an instrument of justice and mercy became a prison of pain.

Chi-Yosh, ignoring the unhelpful voices, is then chilled to hear the echos of the past. Prowler had not said what his wife had become to cause him to end her life. He wants to know few things. What Lesell had done as her time here. The tree's original purpose - what were the souls inside ment to do? There is still power in the tree, and what else does it do. These are important things, especially in his decision as to what will become of the tree, once he learns what he will. These things he asks of the voices, to see if they can hear him.

The voices' whispering grows more coherent, and a chorus of sorts can emerge sometimes from the chaos-scape of whispers. Though the voices know little of the time before, they know that the tree was a tool of justice and fairness. It was meant to preserve the wisdom of ages, mortal and otherwise. The voices know that they can do great harm to those who anger them, and indeed they seem to suggest that many have died from their efforts in the past.

Of their use, there is none. They are the damned of the dark, cursed to live out their torment here in this hellish grotto underneath the shining city of the hated Fair Folk, and the only goal any can be said to have is to visit their own suffering on others.

Chi-Yosh pulls from the tree, his mind filled with dire thoughts. So far the trip here has only told him of the sins committed by Lesell after she fell beneath the Great Curse. But he wishes this story to have a better ending, but first he needs confirmation by the masters of the house. Turning, the Solar dives into the lake, and swims back to shore, climbing out.

Olo holds up his warrior's callused hand as Chi-Yosh departs the lake. "Hold," he says, grimly. "You have touched the tree and now must prove you are not possessed by its evil. Fight me, and demonstrate the purity of your soul through combat."

Chi-Yosh shakes the blood from him, and stands up straight from the crimson waters. While taking up a stance, "If this is neccessary for my trip back to the throne room, so be it."

Chi-Yosh hesitates. Do the Fair Folk know of souls? And, with the Eclipse as an envoy, they are protected as long as none on the Eclipse's side shows aggression. This could possibly break the oaths of neutrality. "I will not take the first strike. If it is the purity of my soul that you seek to test, then attack, and it will be tested in its' action. For I am not the aggressor at heart."

Olo nods slowly. "Well, then," he says, smiling grimly and exposing his wolf's fangs. "I cannot trust you, and I will not guide you if I do not trust." And so saying, he turns, making for the rough stone stairs that provide the exit.

Chi-Yosh calls back, "And I cannot trust you. If I strike, I could forfeit protection by showing aggression." A heartbeat. "If you seek to test me, bring down the Eclipse to seal an oath it will not break our treaty."

"I will see if he comes willingly," are the warrior's last words as he disappears into the chambers above.
