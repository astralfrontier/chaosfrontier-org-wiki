The darkness was vast. It wasn't the immediate termination the Abyssal had expected. Nor was it the endless sameness he had feared. Instead it was like a sort of birth. The dark Exalt felt himself shudder. He reached out, feeling himself twisting and changing somehow. He felt his skin creeping. It was as though he was being torn apart and reassembled.

The brightness of the Sun was the next thing he saw. He felt heat. On his bare skin was sand, and the gem-eye he once had was gone. He now had two eyes. Raising a hand to his face, he traced the outlines of his skin. It felt warm, too. The taint of death was gone from it. Perhaps from him. No longer an Abyssal, the man once called Ra Fu Yan in life sat up to examine his desert surroundings. He was naked, and would need to find food and water soon.

The DC-3 is heavily guarded. It seems that the Italian authorities are working in cooperation with whoever sent the men to Dr. Altieri's dorm room - or at least they are both interested in the same group of people. However, the doctor is adamant, as he and the Circle hide behind a hangar and spy on the impounded plane: "You can't just go in there! Those other men were Germans, and not government men, I'm sure of it. But if you attack the Italian authorities, they'll be waiting for you no matter where you land. I'll be ruined."

Davron agrees with the doctor, once his words are translated. "We came here to learn from the man, not ruin his life," he says to his companions. "But we need to leave this land and travel to Egypt. And while we don't want to confront the local authorities, it seems obvious that they want to confront us." He rubs his chin. "Can you ask him, Gallius, if he has any notion how we can get out of the country without being arrested?"

Gallius frowns in thought. This journey in Gaia is getting interesting in the most unpleasant of ways, it seems. "There is only one reason they would be following us," she decides. "I think our best course of action is to make for the sea, though they are likely to expect that. Tell me, Doctor, is there any group who might be able to help us vanish from this country?"

Gallius asks, and the linguist answers. It seems that Egypt is to the south; crossing the "boot" of the Italian land-mass to a port city and sailing for one of the desert land's cities is possible with the money they have. While it seems that the group is "popular" with the authorities, Dr. Altieri believes that he can make a deal with some of his colleagues in Rome for identification papers. In Italy, the stamp of the Vatican is not lightly questioned, even in these modern times. He doesn't explain why he's so confident that this plan will work, saying only that "the advancement of science has become a priority over other, more worldly concerns".

Another trip back to Rome, and the six travelers prepare. Jin-nu and Gallius stay outside while Dr. Altieri leads the men into one of the maze-like offices of the Church and introduced them to his colleagues. Consequently they are given a car, traveling papers, and a suitcase - the doctor explains that he was asked to deliver this as repayment for the favor. And once again, the Solars set off in a new mode of transportation.

Upon reaching the coast, the party pays for sea transportation. It seems they are again due for a long, hopefully relaxing ocean voyage.

---

The voyage is long and uneventful. The ship is even slower than the one the group left Egypt on, and this gives them time to hone their skills in hopeful preparation for a return to Creation. Periodically they will speak to Dr. Altieri, whose command over the life and times of the White Wizard is returning in pieces. Chi-Yosh discovers that his reflexes are getting better after time spent in this Essence-poor world. Without the ambient magics of Creation to fuel him, his native agility is growing to match his demanding expectations of what he's capable of.

Similarly, Davron has been taking advantage of the brief lull to train his muscles in new ways. The night-time expedition to Dr. Altieri's dorm has given him a head start, and now he pushes himself further. In the middle of the night, when other passengers will not be alarmed, he might be found balancing on the guardrail at the stern, or somersaulting down abandoned corridors. Chi-Yosh's approach as a tutor is more intuitive than formal, but it serves Davron just as well.

Gallius spends the trip staring at what passes for the sun in Gaia. She is oddly silent while the sun is in the sky, lost entirely to her focus, even when others try to distract her from her silent vigil. Whatever battle she fights in these long hours, it is a private one, against demons that no one can help her with. As the days pass, the lady's expression grows more stoic, and her restlessness increases.

Ra Fu Yan found the hide tents of nomads in the gathering gloom of twilight as he stumbled, half-dead, out of the desert. It felt strange to be so aware of his mortality without being wrapped in it. Nevertheless he found he still had his command of magic, and his Charms were still those of the dark demigod he once was. Swaying the poor brutes who traveled this desert to his cause was an easy matter.

He found others as well. None of them knew anything about the Well of Udr or any sort of other world. And so he taught them, haltingly at first, mastering their crude language easily enough. And he decided something else: that it would be easier to find out if there was a way back, and to learn the truths of this peculiar and magic-dead place, if he did not merely ask of these wretches, but ruled them.

The Circle once again returns to Cairo. From here, Dr. Altieri attends to his colleagues' errand while the Solars see the sights again. Two days later, the doctor is ready. He has maps of the desert, and his contact in Cairo knew of the desert-man that aided the Circle when it first arrived. From this he's able to partially reconstruct where the Well of Udr left its hapless passengers. In the hotel room the group has procured, he shows the other-worlders where he believes it can be found. "What are your intentions?" he asks.

Davron discusses the matter with the Circle. The focus of his interest is in studying the pyramid from an occult perspective, and that will require a journey into the desert to study it first hand. Though the Circle lacks the resources for a full-fledged archeological 'dig', there are a few specific pieces of knowledge they can collect now that survival is no longer the sole priority.

First, Davron intends to thoroughly measure the dimensions of the pyramid as best he can. Occult phenomena often work to a precise if idiosyncratic mathematics, and if the pyramid was constructed with specific occult aims in mind, learning its measurements may help him to partially reconstruct those aims.

"Furthermore," continues Davron, "there is now a man among us with some familiarity with the language of the pyramid-builders. If Dr. Altieri cannot entirely decipher the pictograms, then at least we can take a copy and see if there is someone in Cairo who can."

And lastly, the Circle intends to search the pyramid inside and out for any other secrets it may conceal. With Ramar's magic and Davron's analytical mind, they may be able to find hidden passages or rooms that would escape mortal men.

In December of 1937, the Solars, Jin-nu and Dr. Altieri reach the half-buried pyramid. This time two other men are with them: a native Egyptologist who the doctor vouches for completely, and a sand-dwelling man who acts as a guide. "This is quite a find," remarks the Egyptologist, after a two-hour initial inspection and camp setup. "This is a completely unknown pyramid. Very early architecture."

"Well then... let's have a look," replies Ramar. He pauses for a moment, letting what little Essence he can command flow freely around his senses. It's a simple matter of quieting the mind and then... the grains of sand become sharper, the sound of the wind whipping above more audible, the feel of the heat that much more intense. Ramar scans the pyramid, enhanced senses put to use in order to find things that mortal eyes and ears might overlook.

A thorough inspection of the base of the pyramid reveals nothing. However, two tiers up, Ramar's supernaturally keen senses detect two secret doors. In due course the Circle and their Gaian associates examine these. One seems to be blocked off by rubble, but the other appears intact. It leads down into darkness, in some chamber beneath where the Solars themselves arrived.

The claustrophobic corridor down is trapped, but the ancient safeguards are disarmed by the party of alert Exalted. At the bottom, the group assemble around a crypt. "Here lies.. Ra," says the Egyptologist, breathing quietly. "God of the sun?" He points at the inscriptions on the walls and the crypt itself, of ancient stone. "First Pharaoh of .... I can't read this. Do you realize what this means? This is it. This is .. our history."

"The god of the sun?" Davron repeats as Gallius translates. He is reminded once again of the kinship that the Deathknights often claim to have with the Solars. "Ask him, Gallius... how is it that this god of the sun - how is it that a god died? And was laid to rest here? Do these inscriptions speak to that?"

"Obviously myths change over years," the Egyptologist replies, still distracted and excited beyond belief. "Stories develop around a single powerful ruler, and are amplified by his political standing into supernatural tales. The pantheon develops from history, obscuring it.." The man's words, however, fade into stunned silence. He was interrupted by a soft thump. What has stopped him dead mid-speech is that it came from the crypt.

"What was that?" whispers the Egyptologist. Meanwhile, Dr. Altieri has had at least the presence of mind to stand between him and the crypt. "al-Rus, best that you wait for us outside," he says urgently, and his colleague shows no hesitation at making for the passage-way up.

"Stand back, everyone, and be ready for anything - including Ra, perhaps," says Davron as he steps forward to the crypt. Once the Egyptologist has fled, he grasps the cover stone. Muscles bulge beneath Davron's shirt as he exerts himself, and with a grunt and a grinding of stone, the crypt begins to open...

The chamber rattles with the echo of the stone lid crashing to the ground. The Solars look in, curiously, and warily. Within the recess of rock, a mummified body lies. It is wrapped in bandages, with a curious golden mask over the face. Several gold and jewel-decked pieces adorn the body, and the occultists can see immediately the arcane significance of their design. Davron in particular is reminded of his memory with Yang, observing the Soul Seal rite. And as they watch, the body shivers faintly. There is a brief rasping sound, like wind through a bladder, as a throat that hasn't spoken in millennia tries to draw breath and speak.

Gallius peers inside and raises an eyebrow. She, for one, is not really sure just what that thing is. She looks to Davron, expecting he'll be able to help her decide whether to chop it into tiny bits or leave it be. Her impulse is to shut the door again and leave mostly-sleeping dead lie.

Chi-Yosh stares into the stone coffin, and reflexively cringes as signs of life, or rather unlife, are given off. The initial instinct is danger, but from the looks of the body and its restraints, it is not sitting up anytime soon. The idea of something waiting thousands of years, lingering between death and life... A shake of his head. This should not happen in Gaia.

The thing in the crypt twitches again. It manages to move a hand, placing it unsteadily against the stone of its coffin, and a finger begins tapping out a steady rhythm. A heartbeat, in fact, as Ramar can now hear. It is not something dead, but something that remains anchored to life by a tenuous thread. The power of Solars' Essence is being slowly siphoned into it. Their presence must have roused it to consciousness.

Davron's stomach turns slightly. The suspicion of necromancy grows in his mind - certainly any Abyssal would feel far more comfortable sharing a room with this mummy, and now Davron understands more clearly what Siamun feared. But... perhaps he is wrong. And in any case, whetever stirs in this place is surely a thing of Creation, not of Gaia. "Can you speak, sir?" Davron whispers, not in Rivertongue but in the language of the Old Realm.

_I... live........ again...._ the voice croaks, barely audible.

_You.... .Exalted....._ The voice changes to Riverspeak. _My comrades at last? Have you come for me?_ It is still halting, and ancient, and slow.

"Are you a Death Lord?" Asks Chi-Yosh in Riverspeak.

_I? No.... I... served... Who are you?_ the ancient thing rasps.

"We have awoken you," says Gallius calmly, her eyes locking on the remains without a sign of flinching. "You will answer our questions, first, and then we will tell you all that you require. Who are you? Why did you come to this place and how did you get here?"

There's a cloud of dust as the thing exhales. _I.. am Ra Fu Yan. Servant of.. the Dowager, at one time._ It wheezes a few more moments, then continues. _Alive past my time.. her touch left my soul, but if I die, she will take command of me again._

"You wish to be free of the Dowager forever, then," says Gallius softly. That she can definitely empathize with. A pity Death Lords are so very hard to kill. "How can we help you escape? There may be some who are able to help free you from her cursed grasp. Some who look upon me with favor." Though that might change drastically when she brings a corpse to Yu-Shan.

_Cecelyne... You must have realized, if you came back here... The only way back... Take me with you. I have traveled before, but I could not pass her challenge.. With you, I can. Swear that you will aid me, and I will show you.._

Gallius does as she always has. She thinks with her heart first. Fortunately it has always been the best part of her. "I will aid you, Ra Fu Yan. I am Gallius Leom, Queen of the Nation of the Sun, Zenith Caste of the Unconquered Sun. I will do all in my power to free you from the grasp of your dark mistress."

The guide and the Egyptologist are very much inclined to leave things be, especially when the Solars emerge from the tomb with a dark-skinned man clad only in a loincloth. He is tall and handsome, with all the bearing of an old and regal king. "We must walk into the desert. I will show you the way," he explains to Davron. Meanwhile, Dr. Altieri approaches Gallius. "I'd like to apologize," he says with a smile.

Gallius somehow finds the sudden addition to the group completely untroubling. It's just yet another responsibility thrown upon her shoulders. When the doctor apologizes, she looks at him curiously, "What do you have to apologize for?" she asks.

"Well.. I haven't been completely forward with you," he says with a wry smile. "You could say that Korash advised me to withhold what I knew until I was more sure of your intentions. Or you could say that my subconscious held back because of everything I was being exposed to. Either way, I can tell you folks what you are interested in."

"We have always had to prove ourselves," Davron says with a wry smile. "But then, that is as it should be. Go on..."

"The White Wizard found Bagrash Kol's fallen fortress. Inside, he found something he knew to be called the Labyrinth of Lies. He didn't get inside, but he did manage to find some scraps of the Book of Three Circles in another chamber. Further, he traced them to a sand-fortress in the Deep South. The Book came from there. Or at least Bagrash Kol left records saying it could be. Find his fortress again - I've drawn you a map. Find the sand-fortress. But you must go to both places." He holds out a folder of paper notes.

Sensing that the time in Gaia is about to end for better or worse, Gallius takes a pen in hand and starts to write. The letter itself is only a few pages, but she adds stories about her life with Kirri, tales of their families, and hopes and ambitions to share with the young lady. She wants to give as much back as she can. In this way, she is doing just that. She even pens the letter so that the stories seem to be provided as amusing fictional bits. Haley will know them for what they really are, though. With that, it is time to be going again.

Together with Ra Fu Yan, the four Solars and Jin-nu gather together the last of their needed supplies for a long desert trek. The First Pharaoh advises the Solars that the pyramid should be destroyed for the safety of future visitors to the area, and Dr. Altieri assures them that it will be taken care of. Bidding farewell their linguist associate and his two Egyptian comrades, the party begins walking into the desert.
