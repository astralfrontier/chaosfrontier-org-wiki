The city of Kish is nestled on a plateau on the edge of the volcanic mountains in the deep Southern Threshold. The palace of the rulers of Kish is an expansive mansion, carved out of that same hot, dry stone. It has a simple grandeur and a subtly alien aesthetic, a byproduct of its builders' close contact with the forces of Malfeas. Stone columns support a squat roof, and line a long hallway leading into the depths of the palace.

The Solars and their escorts emerge in a large quadrangle. At the center, an ornately-carved fountain bubbles with crystal-clear water. And beyond it are seven people, all dressed in the simple silk robes commonly seen on the citizens of this enigmatic city. Three of the figures could be brothers: they have the same face and build, but each stands with a different posture, and there are subtle distinctions in appearance as well. The other four draw the most immediate attention from the Solars, for they are themselves. Gallius, Chi-Yosh, Ramar and Davron all stare at near-identical copies of themselves, who wait patiently with the trio.

The three have long, silvery-white hair and the refined handsomeness of feature that comes with maturity. Their faces have the merest hints of wrinkles and other signs of age. One of the them steps forward and inclines his head politely. "Welcome to Kish," he says, and waves a hand to encompass the Solars, Ra and Jin-nu, who has resumed her human form. "We are Sa." He gestures to his twin peers. "Speak to any of us and you speak to all."

Gallius nods to the three after giving her reflection a rather wary glance. "We apologize for appearing in such an abrupt manner. It was far from our intent to emerge so far from home. I am Gallius Leom, and these are my friends. Davron, Chi-Yosh, Ramar, Ra, and Jin-nu. We wish to make our way to the north. Any help you could give us would be appreciated and rewarded."

One of the three, a smiling genial fellow, nods and gestures. "Dine with us," he offers. The escort of guardsmen take this as their signal to depart, leaving the Solars and their companions alone.

Gallius nods, "That is a generous offer," she agrees. Still, seeing a mirror of herself make her curious. "It seems that some of you are not yet introduced. Though I think we've met before, somehow.." She smiles a little, trying to seem pleased at the novelty.

The dining hall's spartan elegance matches that found elsewhere in the palace. Nevertheless the food is delicious, representing a broad range of local dishes and even a few imported delicacies. The manner in which the denizens of Kish, a "Lost City", manage to import such goods is not volunteered. The four copies of the Solars, and the three twins calling themselves Sa, seem all to find themselves at home here. "Isn't this pleasant," volunteers the smiling Sa. The one next to him, of more resolute mein, nods in minimally polite agreement. "Going north is a simple matter; there aren't many other directions to choose from."

As to the copies of the Solars, they talk quietly amongst themselves, smiling cordially at the continued attention they seem to be receiving from their cognates. At length Sa speaks, the third of the trio. "They are simulacra," explains he. "Copies brought to life through magic. Each is a mirror, a sort of reflection of some living being. They have no magic or thought of their own, but they can be useful enough."

Chi-Yosh is partially alarmed at that. The leaders of Kish has created doubles of hte Circle? "Marvelous creations," says the Su'Katan. "If they are mirrors, where did you get the source for their reflections?"

This is answered by the duplicate Chi-Yosh, who speaks with the same straightforwardness and hint of hesitation as his living counterpart. "I was created by three drops of blood, shed in battle," he says, then falls silent.

Gallius raises an eyebrow, trying to shrug it off. She will just rest assured they can't match her save in form. "It is.. flattering, I suppose, if a bit strange. Is this a custom in the south?" she asks. Who knows what they consider normal in a city that is half controlled by demons.

The Gallius-duplicate shakes her head. "We are only made for special purposes, and on special occasions," she says. Sa nods and smiles - one of them after the other, disconcertingly - and the third of the three offers, "question them if you like."

"And for what special purpose were you made?" asks Gallius, looking to her duplicate. "I hope you are not offended, but it is rather uncomfortable to us to see others wearing our faces."

"I feel what you feel," the other-Gallius responds, gravely. "If I were an abomination of black magic, I should destroy myself. But I do not believe it to be the case. I was made so that Sa could question us about our hopes and goals. But we cannot reveal what you would not."

Davron glances at his own double with his own suspicions, half expecting the gaze to be mirrored. "I'm sure _you_, at least, understand why I find myself... wary about this," he says, with a half-smile. No sorcerer is especially comfortable knowing that a magical entity of unknown motive has control of some piece of him.

The other Davron nods slowly. "We were made using sympathetic magic, using pieces of your lives gathered assiduously over time."

"And what have you decided to based on what you have learned?" asks Gallius curiously. "If you have learned anything, it is that time is a luxury I can never afford to waste, and my people need me."

The second, resolute Sa now speaks. "These are not windows to your heart; the magic of the simulacrum does not permit us to violate that sanctum, nor have we interest in doing so. But, behold..." He turns to the other-Gallius, putting a question to her. "Do you intend to bring harm to Kish, or to reveal its location to outsiders?"

The other-Gallius considers, then shakes her head. "No. Not if Kish wishes to remain unknown and does not seek to harm my people." She looks to the other Gallius then, and the two mirror in more than form, frowning thoughtfully at each other.

Davron sits back to digest the implications. "You have observed us for some time, then," he says, addressing Sa. "Did you have foreknowledge that we might come here?" He can understand that a city such as Kish would seek to conceal itself by whatever means possible, and does not begrudge Sa the opportunity to reassure themselves that an unknown Exalt will not compromise their secrecy.

The third Sa composes his hands into a thoughtful steeple, as empty plates are now removed by the serving staff in accord with a silent signal. "We did not know you would come HERE. But because of these simulacra, we know that you are pursuing something of importance, and so naturally we periodically inquired about you. Depending on your intentions - which we have also learned, in broad - we may be willing to aid you more directly."

Chi-Yosh, as more information is devulged about the nature of the mirror magic, considers. While he doubts the leaders of Kish would share such magics, but it would benefit the Nation. Allowing those with the Circle's decisive minds, intentions, and and leadership skills at the helm, even with the Circle gone. Surely, the simulacra do not hold the powers of an Exalt, but everything else is at their fingertips.

"We are the Chosen of Helios, we have returned and have many purposes. The defeat of the Deathlords, the protection of men against the Fair Folk, the defeat of the Realm, the restoration of our kindred, and many other things besides," says Gallius. "As you know by now, I control a nation far to the north, and from there we are expanding our control, giving men better lives and letting them know the truth of their world."

The second Sa nods approvingly. "Your fame in some of these endeavors led us to the creation of the simulacra of you," he explains.

Chi-Yosh says, "Have you, or are you considering making simulacra of others, as you have of us? Surely we are not the only ones to have interested you, or have dealings that might cross your path."

In answer, the second Sa claps his hands. A few moments later, several footfalls can be heard on the stone of the palace floor. Out of one of the adjoining hallways come three figures. The first is Yurgen Kaneko, bristly and fur-cloaked. The second is a Lunar warrior in his hybrid war-form, painted and tattooed and bearing owl-feathers in his blue-dyed wolf's pelt. The third is a strange, elementally-aspected woman with piercing eyes and fiery red hair. All three incline themselves politely to the visitors.

Davron leans forward, stroking his chin. "And indeed we welcome aid in our goals - to a certain extent. You have had some opportunity to glean knowledge of our motives - now allow us to learn more about your own." He turns to the other Davron. "They have asked you of our intentions - what do you know of _theirs_? To preserve the sanctity of this place and keep it hidden from those who do not belong - these are reasonable enough goals, but they would not be enough to explain their interest in you or me."

The other-Davron nods. "There's more at stake here than you think," he explains. "The demons behind the gate were all summoned in the First Age, and allowed to roam free once their duties had been discharged. It fell to some of the Exalted to gather such free demons up and bind them here. And there is another matter.." He casts his eyes to the trio of Sa. The friendly one merely offers a bland smile and a polite gesture, indicating for the Davron-copy to continue speaking.

"Most of those that were called up were called to do some specific task. They know pass-words, secret entrances, and hidden places. They know many of the secrets of the oldest artifacts and places of power the Exalted can use, and Sa has been extracting their knowledge, storing it away for a time when the Solars would come back. He is acting as the judge of who will be worthy to receive that legacy."

Gallius listens for a moment, then looks to Sa. This only makes her frown more deeply. "Of who will be worthy. You speak of a time in the future. My interest has been drawn to the future far too often as of late. I wish to return to the now." She looks to her simulacrum, "But you know that already, I imagine. Were there any questions you had that she would not answer?" She nods to her copy, then.

"I find it best not to ask troublesome questions to begin with," the third Sa says, blandly. The Gallius-copy shakes her head in mute agreement with this sentiment; if she is to be believed, nothing sensitive has been revealed. The second Sa, the one with fire in his eyes, raps on the table. "It is clear that we cannot wait much longer, or what we have learned will be worthless. We propose an exchange. A small thing, though not a trifle, from our storehouse. And in return, when you are done using it, you will oblige us a favor commensurate to the value you received from it. If it has been worthless to you, you will of course owe nothing."

"A favor of what kind?" asks Gallius, turning her attention to the other Sa. "It is hard to repay someone whom I am likely to never meet again. And yet those here have goods, and they do not squeeze them from the sand and I rather doubt the demons are aiding you. So it seems you have a way to reach past your gates without being revealed. How will we know whom we are to repay, when the time comes?"

"I think once you see what we have to offer, you will understand how we will meet again," the gentle Sa smiles. "We realize you do not trust lightly. But think, girl - either you trust the goals we have claimed, or you do not. If not, you will thank us politely for dinner and be on your way into the desert, reprovisioned. And if you do trust what we've said, our goals seem aligned with yours. The revived Solar Exalted must be entrusted with the wisdom due them, and whatever we ask will further that goal."

If what other-Davron says is true, then Kish's trove of First Age wisdom is a thing of great value - perhaps on a par with the Book of Three Circles itself. Davron decides that to be found worthy by Sa is a goal eminently worth pursuing - and to his mind, an exchange of favors is an excellent place to start. "We decide as a Circle or not at all," he says, nodding to his companions. "But I would know more about this offer. What is it that you propose to lend to us?"

In answer to that, the three versions of Sa rise as one, and beckon to the Solars. The simulacra, it seems, will not follow.

---

From his robes, one Sa removes a long, indistinct length of metal. After a moment, the Solars recognize it for what it is: moonsilver. "This is the Key of the Hidden Moon," he says, solemnly. "Let us see what lock it opens?"

Taking the lead, Sa navigates the halls of the palace. He chooses a door, apparently at random, similar to many others that occupy this hallway. Pressing the Key of the Hidden Moon to the lock, he whispers an incantation, perhaps in Old Realm. The Key reshapes itself, and like liquid into a mold pours into the lock. A click is heard, the door swings open, Sa pockets the key, and the Solars look inside. What they see staggers them.

The room beyond is large - much larger than it ought to be, unless the other doors in the hallway are merely fakes. The crumbling stone walls and shafts of light are different in tone from the stone and sun of this far-Southern city-state. The walls, too, are covered with a verdant tapestry of vines that are nowhere to be found in Kish. And at the center of this huge, half-open chamber is an ancient airship, also vine-covered and dusty with centuries. The machine is an ornately shaped work of orichalcum, brass, wood and steel. Its lines are sleek; the artistry of its workmanship far surpasses that of the airships the Circle once controlled. "What you see is the _Albatross Aloft on Clouds of Gold_," murmurs Sa. "It is one of the ancient relics that is found in the city of Rathess."

Closing the door, Sa removes the key from the lock. Again he murmurs an incantation, and presses it into the lock. The door opens onto a palatial balcony, apparently carved out of the stone of some inconceivably high peak somewhere. Through the open door, a breeze is blowing, and it washes with icy coolness over the Solars.

Sa steps through the open doorway, and out onto the balcony beyond. In the distant horizon, white clouds blow softly across the piercingly blue sky.

Gallius watches one vision be replaced with another. At least the first was something that would be useful. If it didn't look half broken. 'A ship of that kind is never left untended without a reason,' she thinks to herself. And she knows of Rathess. She knows whose territory it is. She's destined to live up to her old oath, it seems.

Davron follows Sa out onto the balcony. "What is it you show us now?" he says, shivering and wrapping his arms about himself.

Sa gestures out, sweeping a hand across the panoramic view. "Beautiful, isn't it?" he murmurs. "We are now in the north-western mountains of the Northern Threshold. Behind is, through that door - if my key were not in it - you would find an old keep once used by a scholar to study automata and other forms of faux-life. It was here that we discovered the making of the simulacra."

Davron feels his blood run hot despite the Northern chill. Automata! They have been haunting his dreams of late, and to learn the secrets of them... well, what couldn't he do with that knowledge? And yet... "What is it you are offering here?" If Davron could accomplish truly fantastic things with this gift, would the price he would owe be correspondingly high?

"That," Sa replies gravely, "depends on you. You have seen some of the powers I wield. You may ask for the gift of any one of them. I claim no particular possession over them for myself; whatever you receive, as far as I am concerned, you may do as you wish with. There are only two important things to remember.." And here the silver-haired man's eyes bore into Davron's. "First, that this is my test of your wisdom. Succeed, and I will give you the gift of Kish's lore. And second, do not take more than you think you can pay back in the fullness of time."

Davron looks into Sa's eyes for a moment, then nods. "I begin to understand," he says quietly. "Have you anything else you wish to present to me?" At that moment, he notices Chi-Yosh beckoning to him from the corridor back in Kish itself.

When out of earshot of Sa, Chi-Yosh quickly murmurs, "I want to know something. Something is wanted for his generosity. Does Sa know what he wants of us all ready? It is possible he has a task at hand; while having a Circle owe you is a significant plus, there is much planning and much more being offered for a simple pocketed promise to return aid."

"That is part of the test, Chi-Yosh," Davron says quietly. "They do _not_ have a specific favor that they seek of us; what they will ask depends on what our choice is _now_, and how we make use of it. We must be careful not to ask for more than we are willing to give in return."

Chi-Yosh purses his lips. He had not considered that aspect, having been more suspicious of Sa's intentions. "We should see all of the options before we make our choice. This is a test to see how much we will give him to use, nad how much we might then trust him, to be rewarded with Kish lore."

Gallius watches all of this quietly. She offers no opinion, nor does she walk out onto the balcony. She wishes to return home. The secrets of Kish, which she thinks ought to be tempting to her, are not enough to lower that desire even for a moment. Besides, her circle has done quite well without Kish already. Perhaps most influential is the strife of the last favor she had to repay. That weighs on her like a mountain already. She doesn't need more. Her blood is already going to flow thick enough. This, she believes, will likely be worse. Commensurate with that which is given, indeed.

Davron nods to Chi-Yosh and returns to talk with Sa once more. "Have you anything else we might wish to see?" he says, glancing briefly at Gallius' skeptical impression.

The strange being shrugs and smiles. "I have shown those things I thought welcome, from what your simulacra have said," he explains. "If you have other needs, let us see how you fare with what you've been shown."

Davron nods to Sa. "What you have shown us already includes things of great value, and therefore of great price. May we confer, as a Circle? This is a difficult decision, and we must give it due consideration."

Sa waves a hand. "By all means," he murmurs.

Davron turns to his companions. "As attractive as the automata lab is," he begins, "it is far _too_ valuable. The airship is a resource whose limits are clearer, but..." He rubs his chin, and then a thought strikes him. "Hang on a moment..." He strides over toward Sa. "Tell me more about the key you have used. We have seen it open two doors, both to far distant parts of the world. What are its limits? And how much do you know of its use?"

Sa smiles. "The key opens to any door for which you know the song. The name of a door can be found in the songlines of the Lunars, in old verses, even in ballads. Name the door, and you may enter through it."

Gallius hears the answer to the question, but stays quiet. Asking for the key is interesting. Potentially useful, but a dangerous gift. She turns her attention to her copy and says, out of curiosity, "And which gift would you take? Or are you nothing more than a shadow of my heart?"

The other Gallius simply shakes her head. "I'm not a merchant or negotiator," she says simply.

Gallius laughs softly at her shade, "Nor am I. You know well the price I must pay for the last favor I swore to return. I do not know that I shall ever recover fully from it. Do you feel what I feel? The secrets of my heart may not be revealed through you, but can you sense it?"

"What you hide, not even I can see," the copy says quietly. "But it is better that way, because of what we are used for, is it not?"

"For what you are used for," agrees Gallius. "A pity, though. Even a Queen would find someone who can truly empathize with her and understand her completely beyond price. If that were true, then I would ask for you. But you know only the things I can quickly tell. I am sorry that your existance is so limited. But you know that. I am a liberator. I free slaves and break chains."

"Gallius?" says Davron softly, as he walks up to join her. "Consider the people to whom you owed the last favor. The Bronze Faction believes that it would be better if we did not exist. Is it a surprise, then, that the repayment they requested hurt you greatly?" He pauses. "Sa, on the other hand, claims to be holding the secrets of Kish for the Solar who can rightfully claim them, and the favor they ask will be toward that goal. So... when you consider what we will owe Sa, and doubt that we can bear to repay it, all you are really asking is: do we trust him?"

"My shade knows as well as I that I do not trust him," says Gallius softly. "Perhaps I fall swiftly to the plague of our kind, but trust is a treasure and I am finding myself more often than not penniless." She shakes her head, "My choices of late have led us to disaster. I have made this pursuit of our goal more costly than it ever should have been. I have risked our lives needlessly and I fear to even think how the Nation has and will suffer for my stupidity. This choice I leave to others, Davron. I have done enough. I belong back among my people. Perhaps there I can restore myself once more."

Davron nods. "I understand, Gallius," he says. "You are the queen of the Nation of the Sun, and you bear many burdens as it is. But... perhaps this is a burden I can bear." He turns to Sa. "Of all the gifts you have shown us through that key, it is the key itself that, to my mind, is both valuable to us, yet whose value is within our reach to repay. Is that among the treasures you are willing to offer?"

Sa offers the key to Davron, after closing the door to the balcony of the Northern keep. He smiles, then, and reaches into his robe's sleeve to produce a glittering scroll-case. This, too, he presents to Davron. "You will need this if you are questioned about your right to the key," he explains.

The strange man/men also holds up a hand, as though remembering something. "Think back, young man, and you may remember the songs I incanted over the key that opened the door."

Davron nods. "I understand," he says, as he concentrates, focusing his mind remember those snippets of song. To _use_ those other gifts may increase the price of the favor that will eventually be repaid, but they are there if needed. "Thank you."

Gallius looks to Jin-nu and then to her copy. She considers for a moment, and then does something out of impulse. Perhaps wrong. She would say everything she has done lately has been wrong, anyway. She carefully cuts from her braids a long lock and offers it to her copy. "I think we shall be leaving, and unless I am mistaken, you shall remain. Perhaps you can feel nothing of your own, but if you do, maybe this will make you feel more whole." She offers the hair to her shade, then. "In time, I will try to open more of my heart to you. If I succeed, then I may yet survive. If I fail, may death find me on swift wings before I destroy the lives of men."

The simulacrum accepts the gesture mutely, wrapping the strands of hair around one of her own hands. She nods in the direction of Sa, who approaches close and leans in to whisper something for Gallius, and her alone.

"I see you have foreseen that portion of your fate as well. If you go mad, we will destroy you, have no doubt," he whispers. "As we destroyed the fourth of ourselves, long ago."

---

Outside the palace, the Solars stand near one of the outlying storehouses. It has a door, with a lock; according to the ruler of Kish, any such door should suffice as a way from place to place. And, curious about the dangerous gift they have accepted, Davron opens the scroll-case to read what authorization could possibly allow moonsilver into non-Lunar hands. "The Solar Deliberative hereby commends the Key of the Hidden Moon into the hands of Sa O Ket of the Eclipse Caste. So authorized, this day.." A list of three signatures follow.
