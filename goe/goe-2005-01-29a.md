Returning from yet another long journey, Gallius decides to rest for one day before setting out yet again. Thanks to Ramar's jade, she has managed to trick the Guild into offering her a most favorable deal on slaves that would otherwise be sent to the Fair Folk. So what the queen needs is money. Enough to buy every slave the Guild brings. She makes use of a volo for this journey, growing more comfortable with the device after the last trip. A message has been sent ahead of her to Prowler, letting him know that she wishes to see him, and so she waits on the edge of his territory for permission to enter.

The queen is greeted by a polite air elemental which informs her she may enter. Gallius smiles and flies swiftly the rest of the way, recalling the first time she came to this place. She wonders at how little time has actually passed since then, and how much has changed, as well. She lands near Prowler's fortress, hoping that she can convince the Lunars that her plan is worth pursuing.

Gallius is met by a group that pleases her and meets her hopeful expectations. She offers polite nods to the Lunars who have come, speaking first with Prowler, "It was very polite of you to accept me on such short notice. It seems to be my trend, though." She seems far more comfortable among the Silver Pact now, feeling among them a place for her. And in many here a respect she has never noticed before. Even those who stand high here are seeing her in a new light. "I am honored that so many have come so quickly."

Tamuz studies the Solar closely, answering with a grunt, "We come because the world shifts around you. Everything you touch shifts and does not stop." That much seems to be agreed upon here. The impact of the Solars has been noticed even far away. Weeping Prowler nods slowly, adding, "Much has changed in a short time with your circle. Those who have come or sent others in their place wish to hear what it is you have to say." And that clearly means that it's time to get to the saying.

The point is not lost on Gallius. Once again she wonders at how much more straight forward and comfortable things among the Silver Pact seem. Here she is known for what she has done. Here she knows those around her. She wonders which is more truly her home, at times. She doesn't have to waste any time, either. "The Guild thinks I can create enough Jade and Silver to destroy their precious commerce," she begins. She doesn't have to tell those here that it's not yet true. She also doesn't have to tell them that it might well be true in next few years. Recent events make the Lunars expect that sort of thing. It makes the elders remember their mates in the past, as well.

Gallius keeps her straight-forward approach to this, saying, "I plan on making use of the Guild's fear to put a stop to its slaving. For now, though, they have offered me an opportunity to buy the freedom of any they would send to the Fair Folk at highly favorable rates. I do not have the silver and jade to get them all away from the slavers, nor the means to transport them all to their homes again." Gallius raises a hand to forestall any arguments, "I know you already raid and destroy them. Has that stopped them? The Guild plagues on a great disease that has existed always in Creation. Greed has not found its cure, but it is a weakness that can be directed."

There are some, like Prowler, who are quiet, absorbing what is said and not speaking. Sand Spider would not be one of those. "Better to kill them and be done with it," he growls. Still, there is a change in his stance. The scorn of the children playing at being in the Silver Pact has been replaced with his more normal, harsh personality. Gallius listens to him and nods, "It is a worthy consideration," she agrees. "But these people breed like maggots," she explains, "And killing may be less efficient than other means. Many worthy souls will live in chains while we spill the blood of fat men in their rich halls."

The argument of Tamuz is less unpleasant, and many heed him closely. Particularly those emissaries who serve No Moons. "Would it not be wiser to find a better means of labor than slaves? In the past those things that slaves do were done by automata, constructs of craft and sorcery that did not have the limitations that slaves do. If the Guild is truly greedy as you say, that would be a more efficient course, to use your own words."

The Solar nods her agreement, "The most efficient of all. And a path worth pursuing. I have a friend who might well be able to aid in this, if he had more hands to aid him, and those of experience to give him advice when it is asked for." She focuses her attention on Weeping Prowler and Tamuz, as well as the representative sent by Luluri. "If you are willing to aid us in that work, we may well be able to end this selling of bodies very quickly. Let servitude be for those only who deserve it, then. There will always be that kind around. But for those who are strong, there will be no 'civilized' packs out to hunt them."

"And what will be done with those slaves you will buy away from the Guild?" asks one of the emissaries. "There will be many. And if they are the kind sent to the Fair Folk, they are not likely to have much to offer. Are you truly ready to absorb such a horde? Few will be strong enough to find their homes again on their own."

"And fewer others will have homes to return to. Many will be unwelcome in the places they came from. Particularly if they were beggars, bandits, or lunatics."

"To the strong and virtuous, honor, to the helpless, pity and mercy, to the vile, justice and death," says Gallius. She meets the eyes of the emissary with calm certainty, "There are many my circle can save that others would give up for lost. We have uncovered ways that shall make it far easier to take in hundreds, even thousands of people at once. Places shall be prepared, and the ability to handle the strain is already being put into place by a friend of mine." And Marina is all too eager to face the challenge of it. "Those who have a home to return to will be aided as well. But for that, I wish to have assurances of safe passage. My hawkriders can carry them far, and swiftly, in one day's time, and there are other ways as well, but it would be better if there were assurances of open skies and paths offered far faster than other men would know of."

"So what I need is some help giving these.. people their silver," says Gallius. She doesn't really like it. In truth, her heart is much closer to Sand Spider's than she'd like to admit. She'd rather give justice to those who are cruel and evil. But she's learned to restrain herself. She's learned that sometimes those who are cruel can be redeemed. "And some room to get them back home. Now, if they are of a Lunar tribe I imagine they will need less help finding their way back." She grins at this, and Sand Spider openly laughs.

"But for the rest, I'll have to hold hands and offer homes. The matter of automata is a more complete solution. And if the Guild does not bend when it comes time to give it this alternative, it will be time to turn back to the other way and break them. I do not think it shall come to that. They give honor to their money and obey it, as well." Gallius frowns thoughtfully, "They will learn other things one day. Even the greed of Nexus will one day be crushed."

For the most part, the Lunars seem willing to assist in Gallius' plan. Sand Spider seems willing to help only when Gallius promises to follow his lead should her idea fail. In some way, this amuses him to no end. More privately, he pitches several lewd offers to the Solar, hoping to offend her sensibilities. Gallius replies with several suggestions of her own, some of which even a flexible Lunar might find both difficult and uncomfortable.

If anything, Gallius proves more eager to get the point and handle affairs than the Lunars expect. Her reputation as a rolling boulder eager to crash through everything in her path can only be growing. Once matters are settled, Gallius goes to speak with those who are aiding Ma-Ha-Suchi's plan against the Realm. A plan that she feels deserves her aid once more. She made a promise to the Sidereals to not damage the Realm directly, but there are other ways she can bring ruin upon the usurpers that live on the Blessed Isle.

This discussion is oddly more light and full of amusement than the other. The business of revenge is sweet. The plan of Gallius is something of a pleasing joke to them, as well. A joke that will destroy many of the hated Terrestrial Exalts. "The Realm thinks in the way of men," explains Gallius. "Any war against their stolen island will require ships. Many ships to bring great armies to bear. Now, it is not yet the plan of Ma-Ha-Suchi to make such a move. We can do far better drawing them away from their home, out where they can be destroyed far from the aid of what was built so long ago."

The Solar growls at times, feeling more aware of the theft and treachery of the Dragon-Blooded than ever as she speaks. "And so we will draw them out to us. Out to be swallowed in the tide. The city of Lookshy will be their target. I have many allies who hold some strings attached to the Great Houses. Strings that can tilt their minds. I plan to put it in the heads of our enemies that Lookshy is building us a fleet. A great fleet that will bring ruin to the Realm."

"If Lookshy wishes to aid us in this act, it will be far simpler to convince the Realm," says Gallius. "If they do not, well.. that is their choice. I propose that if they help us willingly, we will stand with them for that one battle and at their sides bring ruin to the fleet of the Realm. If they do not, we shall draw the Realm to them and let them face the wrath of the usurpers without our aid. The choice shall be their own to make."

Sand Spider grunts, crossing his arms and looking at Gallius with a smirk. "You sure you aren't going to bail them out again?" he asks of the Solar. Gallius frowns deeply and snorts, "A child who makes no mistakes does not grow. I have learned my lesson. The Sidereals tricked me once. I have repaid them in kind, now. Their little pets are largely unguided right now. They are ripe for the picking. I break no oath if they come out to attack my dear allies from the Confederation of Rivers."

That seems to put that concern to rest. For now, at least. The plan is reasonable enough, and not foolishly complicated. "I believe either way this will work well, but if we face a truly impressive fleet, I will seek the wisdom of one who knows the great oceans of the world better than any other. There are none greater than him. I am no master of ships, nor the things that exist under the waves."

Gallius bears the doubts of those around her with practiced ease. Nobody believes her circle can find the Book of Three Circles, either. And nobody who enters the Well of Udr can return. She's well acquainted with the impossible. "I have spoken with him once before," says Gallius. "Perhaps he shall be willing to humor me once again. I will try. It is well worth it." And she's not afraid of a bit of risk. "I also would like it to be known that those wishing to learn something from me may come to my lands. There is much to be done, yet, but what time I have away from other tasks I would rather not waste sitting around." She knows that many young Lunars might find her talents at leading and preparing men for battle to be of some use, at least.

The Solar shows her usual tactless passion for getting to business and then getting away. She does not loiter about to discuss other things, but goes to find Prowler. The fact that he is just finishing a discussion with Tamuz simply makes her life easier. She needs to iron out the details of that automata idea, still, and her mental clock grants her a few more hours to get that information. Davron may well profit, and the queen thinks it's high time she started giving her friends some help for all they have done in making her dreams become reality.

Gallius doesn't even try to talk about the workings of automata with the sorcerors. She knows nothing other than the excited words Davron has spoken to her of that particular kind of craft work in the past. And that not very clearly. She has no head for such work. "I would like to pursue your idea of using automata," says Gallius to Tamuz. "I have no skill in crafting such things, but I have a Nation in which many talents are found. I know of a craftsman that I believe will be interested as well. The purpose of the work will touch his heart, as well, and I like to see the ones I care for find their inspiration. Are you willing to help me?"

Prowler lets out a long-suffering sigh. "I wonder if I will ever stop helping you, at times," he mutters. Gallius laughs softly, shaking her head, "I should certainly hope not. Your life would be horribly boring without me constantly bothering you and turning your home into a home for wandering Solars."

Tamuz shakes his head at Gallius, wondering if perhaps this burst of fire burns too brightly to stay kindled. It seems to not matter to him. "I will offer what help I may. And others may also be interested," he says gruffly. Gallius already knows a few others to ask. Luluri, for one. And perhaps Yurgen might know someone, as well. Just thinking of it makes her try to calculate the time it would take to fly to his home. Prowler seems to know that expression, "We must find a more fitting name for you, Lioness. Even the greatest of beasts rests from time to time."

Prowler continues, after letting out yet another of those sighs. "You will stay here tonight, then. Your fidgeting is bothersome, but you have hampered me with these other Solars, it is time for you to help look after them." Gallius almost considers resisting, but Tamuz speaks up, "I have further business to discuss, about a matter you spoke of before. It will not be short, and I will expect you to sit still and listen."

Gallius knows when she's caught. She may be Ikth-Ya, now, but there are always those who stand higher than she does. "I think you are right," she says, as if the decision were entirely her own. "It would be nice to spend one night away from the noise of the palace. I can't really make any promises about sitting still, though. I will listen."

"Good," says Prowler. "Now come, and you will see my charges. You may be rather surprised. You are not the only one who has made great strides."

Sun-and-Moon is a surprise. The scared, uncertain girl the Solars met in the wild lands on the way to the City of Dreams, and whom Gallius was introduced to later, is now a calm and self-assured young woman. Of particular interest is the sapphire, set into a band of orichalcum, that adorns her brow. She is pleasant and erudite to speak to, but beneath the exterior she hides the power of the Sun just as clearly as Gallius does. But where the Zenith is fire, Sun-and-Moon is light; she seems less intent on dispensing justice than on ensuring its continuance.

Of the peculiar contrivance, Prowler speaks when she is out of earshot: "a work of artifice, meant to keep her soul stable. There was... damage. She may need to be supported for many years yet. But it has not affected her mind, and her power over Essence is only moderately slowed."

Gallius nods to Prowler, "Her situation was a most difficult one, as I understand it. Still, she has grown. I am happy for her to have come so far. I will of course keep my eyes open for anything I find that might be of use to you in repairing that damage." She considers for a moment, "It may be sooner than later. I will have to speak with the others of my Circle. If we find anything, it will be brought to you, if you wish."

Prowler says nothing. For those who do not know the history between him and the Solar girl's prior incarnation, empty appreciation would be useless. And for those who do know the steps he took to put down his mad spouse, and the depths of feeling he has harbored since then, mere words would be an insult.

As for Ra, once the First Pharaoh and now simply the Mindlost, he has made startling strides through the secret sorceries Erisus wields. He is conversant, friendly, but always with a grave air about him. He seems to regard talk as merely the prelude to some other nameless act, and it is clear even now that he is destined for sorcery in the way he speaks and looks about him.

Once he might have worn a death-haunted aura; now it can only be described as eerie, as though some otherworldly force had laid claim to a part of him. Perhaps his part in the sinister sorceries of the Abyssals have carried through; perhaps that which was taken in Cecelyne was more than mere memory. Nevertheless, he does not seem overtly dangerous - to himself or others.

Gallius speaks gently to Ra, obviously impressed with the results that Weeping Prowler has managed to achieve. She introduces herself to Ra as a friend he once aided greatly. She keeps the conversation light, speaking of a few places he might be interested in in her borders and promising that he will be very welcome when he is prepared to visit.
