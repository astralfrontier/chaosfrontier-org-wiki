Although Davron has gone through hell (albeit one within his own mind), the automata he returned from Autochthon with are intact, and capable of taking directions. Weakly the Solar artifex commands his creations to fulfill a project for Gallius, one that may turn the tide of the forthcoming battle with the Dowager. For the Nation's scouts have received confirmation that the Deathlord is marshalling her forces.

Ra, before he lost all that he was, had spoken of the Dowager and the Well of Udr and the place the Deathlord calls home. He hinted that the mighty ghost had conversed with other ancient spirits, those once called the Dragon Kings, who had guarded the Well in the elder time. And Gallius has other reasons for wishing to converse with them.

The automata swiftly create what Bagrash Kol's Great Book refers to as a 'soul conduit'. It is a sort of metaphysical spider, that spins a web out into the limbo the Dragon Kings consigned themselves to. It will allow Gallius' soul to escape into this void and seek their ghosts for ninety-nine breaths before she dies, if she dares.

Ninety-nine breaths. Fortunately Gallius is good at breathing slowly, though she plans on taking no chances. There is little choice. When one seeks the highest places, the risk of falling and the consequences of such a slip are naturally dire. Then again, at least she would only kill herself if she messes this up. She thinks.

The machine draws power from nine Manses scattered around the Nation, connected together by the arcane engineering of the sorcerers and savants of the Dragon Princes, as well as those drawn to the school. At the center of the web of Essence there is a throne, and on it Gallius sits carefully. Clouds of steam wash over the buried chamber where the machine rests; strange odors escape from some of the creaky pipes and pressure-valves. And she feels herself dying, in a fashion similar to her experience when Ma-Ha-Suchi nearly took her life. Her soul slips free of her body, rising outward into the infinite reach of the afterlife.

There is darkness, and Gallius feels herself holding fast despite a tugging sensation, willing the components of her soul to separate. She feels a sense of travel, and of nothingness. The world is gone. Strife is gone. There is nothing but transcendent peace out here, waiting to embrace her.

Slowly she feels presence. The absence of thought begins to flee, and she can discern alien currents of mind that flow around her like the waves of a timeless and endless ocean. They are warm and welcoming, despite their foreign nature, and she feels her thoughts mixing with them in a curious fellowship.

Gallius 'turns' her conciousness about her, then extends her thought, brushing carefully against those wills floating about her. She is unsure just where she is, and even less certain of what she is doing. She bends her thought, trying to relate her identity to those things drifting about her.

Those around her are not mortal, nor have they ever been mortal. Like sharks swimming about a dolphin, they are a fundamentally foreign sort of thing, and the primal crudity and cruelness of the Primordials is upon them. Despite that she does not feel animosity. They are minds of elaborate and complex contents, but simple enough direction. And they are curious about this newcomer.

"I am a Solar," calls out Gallius into that sea. "I came here to see the Dragon Kings," she says, still not quite certain that she's in the right place. She's not even sure she's still alive. Maybe she did something wrong..

We are the Dragon Kings, the thoughts agree. Once your older brothers and sisters. Then the neglected children.

"I want to offer you a chance to return," says Gallius. "I want to give you a choice. The world needs you, and though centuries stand between us, I have not forgotten you. I can never forget you." She senses the peace her, wondering if there is any hope of convincing them to leave it. If this is what death is, it doesn't seem that bad at all.

We were happy, and then we were unhappy. Here we are neither, but we are at least content.

"You may be happy again," says Gallius softly. "And you can always return here, if you would like. The world needs you. It always has. My kind are not enough. We have strength, but we come and go, our wisdom fails and is lost. You are the memory of the world that can go on, unbroken. You taught us so much before. We have forgotten almost all of it now. Did you not love us once as your brothers and sisters? I do not think my memories cheat me completely."

There was love, and hate, and animosity. We were sorrowed that we were changeless, as you say. Because we did not die, and we were not reborn anew, we never improved. Your kind die. You forget all that you knew, so that you can learn better lessons next time. Your old fade away because that is how the new can grow. We needed to understand death to know why you could surpass us. Death was your greatest asset.

"Is it?" asks Gallius. "If your wish is to die, perhaps there is a way to achieve that, but.. I have very little time here, I'm afraid." She sighs softly. A breath. "If we were to change things, alter the reality of Creation, would you be happier? I do not understand why, but my life is a short time compared to yours."

You will never understand us, because you live only once. Even those memories you have from your earlier lives are only memories, not true experiences. And we will never understand you, because we are not reborn. But we have tasted a little of death already.

"And what do you think of it?" asks the Zenith. "Is this what you truly want, this release?" Gallius knows at least one way for them to lose their experiences, but Cecelyne is hardly a suggestion she'll make to them. They must know that they could be wiped clean by the Primordials.

Do you look forward to death?

"No," says Gallius. "I cannot imagine a time when I'll have completed everything I wish for. I do not want to cease being me, either. I will be utterly destroyed. That is not something I look forward to," answers Gallius.

Then why do you cherish new life so much?

New souls are reborn from the old. A baby came from a death. Why do you hate that which gives you what you love?

"I do not hate new life," says Gallius. "I just do not wish to lose myself," she admits. "Why should I have to be destroyed forever? It seems some do not have to die. Jyamis once held my spark, and he has not been undone. I do not wish to lose the land I have labored so hard to protect and cultivate."

But your spark is not your higher soul, your _hun_. It is an addition. Your soul and his shared the mote of Exaltation only.

You do not wish to fade away, yes. What price would you pay for that? Jyamis will not be reborn until he wishes to; but one less child will be born in Creation because of that choice. One less hero, one less villain, one less wasted life or one less virtuous example, it matters not. They are all one less chance for something new. But it is the new that has always made you powerful, is it not?

"I suppose so," says Gallius. "But do you not also make that choice now? It seems we have something in common. You deny hope at great deeds by lingering here. My desires are selfish, I know that. I do not wish to lose the world forever, to have worked and not gotten to enjoy my labor until I am at last tired of it."

Would you die for a friend?

"Yes."

Why?

"Because I love my friends," says Gallius. "It does not make sense, perhaps, but it is who I am. I can do no different and remain what I am."

You love your land too. Would you die for it?

"I would," says Gallius. "And so you suggest that one day, I must also be willing to die for some unknown child to be born. I do not see why it must be that way. Were there not countless more souls in Creation once? Where did they come from?"

You made them. Your kind did. We studied this. In almost all cases a new life would be drawn from an old soul. But sometimes a special child would be born. A fated child. We are told many of the souls that once roamed are now in a place called Gaia, waiting for Creation to become safe once again before they return.

"So if I can make more souls, is it really necessary for me to die in that way?" asks Gallius. "If there are so many still waiting in Gaia, I would not necessarily be cheating anyone." She shakes her head. "But this is far afield. My death will happen whether I will it or no. I doubt I shall perish from old age. Why does this question fascinate you so?"

Because we look from an earlier time, when those souls were not in Gaia. We remember what their fates were. The war between the gods and Primordials. Crying mothers shielding their babies with their bodies. We saw these things and wondered, why would they do this? A woman can better survive than a child. A woman alone can have another child. Men casting themselves heedlessly onto the claws of demons to slow the escape of their families, some of whom might be slain later. Death upon death, just for another hour or two of life. So much fear of it, so much recklessness in facing it.

And we thought, this is what empowers them. This is what makes their Essence so strong. Essence comes from will, you must realize by now. The only source of it is will. You fear death, as you have told us. You don't have the memories that will last beyond your mortal shell's expiration. You don't have the powers of soul that you developed over centuries. You have nothing, really, except the ability to cry. You emerge from your wombs with nothing; you must inevitably turn to dust. What have you then, in between those moments, except your will?

Tell us, is that your power? Your wish to live? To use your life as a weapon and a tool, to spend it as you wish? We chose our moments of death with an eye to our return, but when you choose, it is your final choice. Is that why you will throw away life in one time and fiercely fight death in another?

"Perhaps it is," says Gallius. "The greatest strength of humanity is emotion. Love, hate, fear, and other jumblings of the heart are what guide us. We love others better than ourselves and consider that noble. We consider that the ideal. Perhaps that is why I'm really here. To think that you were so sad and alone that you wished for nothing but this moved my heart to pity. And it filled me with anger at the waste. The world will grow again, but so much of the land lies dumb and empty, so much was swallowed by the Wyld. There is so much to do for the people. The Solars are not enough to make things right."

Then why us? There were many tragedies that came about during the Age of Man.

"I know," says Gallius. "But yours drew my attention. You were our teachers, once. We owe to you a debt of love and friendship, and I would not fail to at least try to restore it again. I wanted you to know that you are not really abandoned. I don't know if it matters to you, but it does to me."

It seems that human newness has caught up with you again. Once you had learned all we had to teach. Now, it seems you will need us to teach you again. Perhaps you will learn in a better fashion. Will you do this experiment with us?

"I will," says Gallius. "But I want you to promise to let us help you, if you feel a need to change the way you exist. And I promise you that we will do better this time."

We will make no such promise until we learn more. But if you call to us we will return. You must also repair the soul conduit. Prepare yourself for the proper data.

Gallius nods, hoping this is going to make enough sense to her so she can relay it. Or perhaps the little.. thing that Davron has helping her can? She will try her best, anyway. She wishes she knew just how to call them, too. 'Is this conduit a way?' she wonders.

The knowledge begins to pour into Gallius' mind. It is fashioned in the alien tongue of the Dragon Kings, and its nature is of the highest technical or occult knowledge. Much of it defies comprehension, even if she could reproduce it from memory later. Here and there she feels islands of intelligibility. "Authorization: R'graak'ten'a. Constellation Fold: The Mask, fourteen motes. Shift left, unlock..." Words, dreams, visions, and chaos threaten to overwhelm her. And then it fades, with a suddenness that sends a freezing shock through her bones.

"Is the soul conduit what I need to call you back?" asks Gallius. She sense her time is up, and already prepares to leave as soon as she is answered. She's not sure how she knows how to get back, but somehow, she can feel it behind her, a path that is not a path, waiting to be followed, and growing ever more tenuous with each passing moment.

Fix it. Then prepare our bodies. Go to the birthing place of Rathess. Learn to call us. We cannot teach you how, because we have never done it before...

"I will do as you instruct." And then she flees from this place, seeking her body once more.

Ninety breaths have escaped Gallius' lungs by the time she returns, and she feels a cold and clammy sensation across her skin. Chi-Yosh and others are there, preparing to tend to her.

And she immediately starts regurgitating all the things that the Dragon Kings stuffed into her head. Swift as she can, hoping that someone will catch the details. Hoping that she remembers enough. Later she may marvel at how perfectly she does deliver those instructions she did not grasp in the least.

Gallius is only stilled by Chi-Yosh and the others after some time. Eventually, when she's finally been assured numerous times by Marina that everything was recorded, and by Chi-Yosh and Ramar, as well, does she finally give way to sleep, utterly exhausted. Her dreams are of Rathess, before the fall. Of the Rathess she will bring back to life once more, with the help of old friends and teachers.
