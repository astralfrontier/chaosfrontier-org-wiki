For now, the Guardian of the Deliberative has decided to keep the Book of Three Circles in the city of Bridal Veil. And there Gallius has long asked it questions of history and law, trying to learn every order that is currently enforced. One thing she has not done is slept much. "It seems to me that our current needs would indicate that a few of the optional positions should be filled. There is so much to be done."

The Guardian of the Deliberative, that is to say, Ramar, has also been learning much from the Book of Three Circles... both the more mundane workings of Solar law, and the more esoteric secrets of Sorcery. "I agree. But... who will we get to fill them?"

"We need to show patience," says Gallius. "There are roles that are best filled by the Sidereals. And the Enigma should remain their province. I hope that they will be willing to help us." She sighs, straying to a subject that is very unpleasant. "We will need their help, if we are to be saved. Or at least if I am to be. As for others, we have many to call upon. The Lunars also are part of the Deliberative. Once Chi-Yosh is sure of his role, I will call upon them. They have their own wisdom and will send their best to help us. At least I believe they will."

"True enough," replies Ramar. "It remains a matter of convincing the Sidereals and the Lunars to join our cause... though there is just one thing I worry about." Here, he pauses, "Are we doing the right thing, trying to restore the old order? Should we not be trying to change, to become greater than the Age before us?

Gallius shakes her head, "I begin to see, Ramar, that what is flawed has nothing to do with the order, and everything to do with us. I did not lie. I can feel something growing inside me. Something is wrong with me. Perhaps it is not the same for all Exalts, but at the least it struck down Raksi. In the end, madness consumed her utterly. I believe that my fate will be much like hers. If it is true that in the first age all the Solars were going mad, I think it is foolish to believe we can avoid that destiny for long unless we do something about it."

"But what do we do?" Ramar looks rather concerned, to say the least. "I will not let such a fate befall you. Not while I live... but I must admit I don't know how to stop it just yet... learning more seems to be the first step." He asks, softly, "Is there anything I can do to help keep you from giving in to this thing growing inside of you?"

"I don't know," says Gallius softly. "I don't think I can win this battle. Perhaps the Book can tell us about the last days of the Old Realm. There might be clues there."

Gallius speaks to the Book directly, then. "Tell me, is there any evidence that the Solars were going mad before the Old Realm was destroyed? And if so, did none of the Solars see the danger?"

"Periodic outbreaks of aberrant behavior were noted among many of the Celestial Exalted," the Book answers. "After a statistical percentage of such episodes was noted, an exhaustive investigation into the possibility of magical attack was launched. No such attack was ever demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Summoner and Sorcerer of the time. Psychological analysis suggested it was an artifact of the human psyche when called upon to manage stresses of the highest level."

"Was it noted throughout the history of the Deliberative, then? Was there no time that things were more pronounced?" asks Gallius. This makes no sense. If Solars were put down, surely it wasn't just due to occasional mental breakdowns. She expects something far more serious than that.

"There is no immediate correlation between history and any particular outbreak of instability. There are notes regarding the research that suggest that past-life memories may have played a role in present-life stress levels. The Deliberative was restructured five times in order to minimize the effects of such occurrences."

"Could you tell me about the last day of the Old Realm?" asks Gallius. Her query is only partially interupted as more of her fellow Solars enter the room. One of them being Rumika. The solar medic says breathlessly, "I came as quickly as I could. Your messenger made it seem like someone's life was hanging in the balance. Are you well, Gallius?"

"Realm records are a function of the Historian's office. Summary texts only are available."

Davron ponders, and addresses the Book. "Can you provide any notes on the research that ruled out the possibility of magical attack?" he asks. If he is going to continue that research project, at the very least he needs to know what approaches are likely dead ends - and which might be reopened based on the results of his own ordeal in the realm of Autochthon. As Rumika enters, he smiles in that happy yet awkward way that he always has in her presence, and takes her hand in greeting - but allows Gallius to answer the question for herself.

"A Circle of Solar and Lunar Exalted were confined to Meru for five years, during which time the offices of the Sorcerer and Protector verified that both external and internal magical barriers against attack were in place and functional. During that time the Circle was subjected to a work load considered average for their experience and duties. Some outbreaks of aberrant behavior were noted. At no time could these outbreaks be correlated to any attempt against the barriers."

"Simultaneously, a comprehensive investigation of all those inside the barriers was performed. No evidence of disloyalty or tampering was uncovered."

Gallius sighs softly. "I fear I do not know," she answers at last. "I am sorry about the way you were called. I will have to be much more specific with my runners. They are very excitable as of late." Rumika smiles warmly at Davron, squeezing his hand and nodding to Gallius. "It is no great problem. It was just rather frightening." Samea considers the Heirophant differently than others. If anything, one would have to guess that Samea has decided that Gallius is like a niece. A particularly ambitious one prone to getting in far over her head. "The Lioness should be more careful if she wants to understand her way through this maze. If the ancients did not see the truth, it was because they thought like Celestials. We must see things from other eyes."

Davron, still holding Rumika's hand firmly, scratches his head with his free hand. It sounds like the Deliberative were quite thorough in their experiments, and yet... he _knows_ that something was missed, somehow. Aloud, he asks, "Was there any attempt to determine if an attack was launched _before_ the experiment began - before the subjects entered the protective barriers? Something that, maybe, had a delayed effect?"

"Exhaustive magical examinations of the test subjects were performed. Four months of research produced no meaningful data."

"The subjects could not have functioned as experimental cases otherwise."

"So it seems then, that while there is no way of predicting the outbreaks of aberrant behavior, it is just that... an outbreak?" Ramar seems to come out of some reverie, hope filling his voice now. He addresses the Book, "Are there any cases of aberrant behavior becoming the normal pattern of behavior? Any indications as to the symptoms of aberrant behavior?"

"They may have destroyed their own experiment," says Gallius. "Not all of us go mad, it seems. Did any of those sent to probe the question later demonstrate madness?"

Rumika will just stand beside Davron. Holding hands is something new. Despite all the distrations of the Deliberative, the Book, and even this question of madness, the solar sorceress finds it far more interesting to dwell on this hand-holding development. Perhaps she, too, has gone mad.

"Events correlated with spikes in stress level, as was compatible with a stress artifact. All members of the Celestial Exalted demonstrated such events, as did many of the Terrestrial Exalted. These outbreaks were similar in nature to those experienced by mortal functionaries of the Deliberative, and their consequences were far more severe, but were less psychically damaging in the long term."

"All events categorized by the study corresponded to some personality trait of the subject."

Davron nods, his shoulders slumping. It's obvious that the Celestials of the First Age covered all the angles as best they could. So... their task is to find the data that they missed. And yet... the memory that allowed him to escape Arandor's will becomes his beacon of hope a second time. "For all that the savants of the First Age did," he reminds his companions, "no one ever probed their own Spark, the way I did." He looks around the room, squeezing Rumika's hand as if for reassurance. "I almost lost all of you that way... but what I brought back with me may be the clue that our ancestors never found."

"Indeed..." Ramar sighs. "Well then there is hope. All is not lost, not while we live. I do not know how exactly to proceed from here, but we must find a way to safely study what it is you have brought back. Davron..." He grins, "You may have saved us all." He leans against Gallius, stroking a hand through her hair idly, "But how do we begin to study such a thing without unleashing a thousandfold dangers upon ourselves?"

"Davron, if you are willing, I would like you to study my spark," says Gallius softly. "I do not want to go mad. I did not work so long for these people just to betray them in the end." She frowns in thought. "Sa is not mad. Nor is Jyamis, the former holder of my spark. Yet they have lived a very, very long time. Sa survived by destroying the portion of himself that was wrong. It must have been part of his personality. The Book tells us that the madness fit the personalities of those who were ill... he must have known which part of himself to destroy."

"Nor was the Solar ghost I consulted, before I sought out Autochthon," says Davron. He nods to Gallius. "I do not have the tools or materials that the Artificer provided me, but I will do my best. The knowledge, at least, I still retain... at least, some of it." A wry chuckle. "And it will be simpler, and safer, if I aim only to study your Spark, and not manipulate it."

"Hrmm..." Ramar considers this. "Maybe then we can find for you a new set of tools. I have some skill in, er, creating things that are difficult to come by." There is something else on his mind, however, and he speaks presently, "Perhaps we can consult with Yang... he may have experienced something like this, either during his time as the ring, or... before..."

Davron nods to Ramar, and addresses the ring, in his mind and out loud. "Yang... if you are willing, can you tell us, as best you can, what was going through your mind? What drove you to tamper with Fate to your own ends? You offered no defense to the Deliberative of ages past, and perhaps there _is_ no excuse - but the new Deliberative would like to know the _reasons_, at least, for whatever insight they may provide."

And so saying, Davron allows Yang's spirit, for the time being, to take over his voice and eyes and ears, so that he may more easily communicate with the assembled Solars.

Yang speaks slowly. "The Sidereals are not like the other Chosen. You Solars can create new Charms, as you discover the powers of Essence manipulation. But our powers come from Destiny - and they are forever constrained by what is possible within Fate."

"I sought out power beyond that," the ex-Sidereal says quietly. "By changing Fate itself, by twisting it about with the power of the Yozis, I thought to bring new powers to myself and my fellows. It was.. it was a difficult time in the Realm. We were becoming busier and busier, more and more lost in the chaotic turmoil of managing mankind."

Rumika is the one to speak-up, then. "You brought the power of the Yozis back into the Fate of Creation?" Her words are surprisingly sharp. The usually gentle and easy-going sorceress, who herself summons demons, finds this particular confession extremely upsetting.

"I.. attempted to," corrects Yang. "Or rather I brought it back. My failure was controlling it."

Ramar asks, "What happened?"

"Ask Chi-Yosh what he found in the city."

"Are you sure that is all that happened?" asks Rumika. "I know little of your kind. What happened to Fate when you blundered? Can it even be guessed?" Her tone has not grown gentler, though her voice is growing more quiet.

Through Davron, Yang shrugs. "Something was brought in that should not have been. But it did not enter the Loom. It was contained by the Ro-Ku-Ren Fast Attack forces, I think."

Ramar asks, "When did you attempt this?" He then asks the Book, "Is there any occurence of aberrant behaviour noted before this incident?"

"Centuries before the Usurpation, certainly," reflects Yang, referring to the Book as he falls silent. "The experiment previously inquired about predates the Sidereal Yang by 1,256 years," the Book answers.

"That you know of," says Gallius softly. "So your work may well have influenced the Great Prophecy itself. We are not Sidereals. You speak of changing Fate with the Yozis. Did anyone else ever do this? And what exactly does Fate mean? I know the word, but I imagine there is a lot more you could say about it, Yang."

"Allow me to explain," recites the Book of the Stars.

A brilliant display of light rises from the Book of the Stars, illustrating the stylized image of a man. This gently rippling illusion lights up the room, and the Solars watch carefully. "A man's nature is a composition of elements," the Book explains. "His interactions with his fellows are a function of his nature, and with his prior experiences. Taken together the sum total of these interactions is called _dharma_. This word rendered into the modern tongue equates to 'the way things are'. _Dharma_ embodies the natural laws of existence."

In the illustration, a map unfolds underneath the man's feet, and he begins walking. Around him, other men appear. Some cross his path; some never intersect with him. Some walk over where he was, or pass over where he will walk. "Considering _dharma_ as a map, the fate of a single man could be compared to the direction and distance he travels."

"Fate, taken overall, consists of the boundaries created by the combined fates of all men." On the illustration, the Solars witness a glowing outline as the footfalls of the travelers describe an overall shape. "Not all aspects of _dharma_ are explored by the existence of a given group of beings. There can be unexplored natural laws that will not be invoked because no man invoked them; nevertheless they still exist."

"Because men's natures influence each other - for example, a parent instructing her children in the ways of life she finds sensible - Fate itself is self-mediating and self-moderating. It does not significantly diverge because human nature does not do so. Thus you have thousands of years of history, but that history is composed of familiar elements. Leaders, wars, sages, kings, houses, boundaries, nations, art."

The illusionary view vanishes.

Gallius considers this, finding the explanation quite helpful. For a change something starts to make sense. Still, there are questions. "Now, we were operating on the theory that the Deathlords were trying to alter Fate by their actions. What things can alter Fate in such a way?"

"Anything that changes human nature, either overall or in a meaningful portion of the population."

Ramar says, "Such as convincing the living to venerate and become like the dead? Er... just a theory."

"Death-cults were a persistent cultural element since the early years of the Realm," the Book replies.

"Does Fate only touch Creation, or does it also reach other places?" asks Gallius. She's just very happy to get such direct answers for a change. "The Sidereals are trying to make another Great Prophecy. What can they see? I suppose that is a better way to phrase my question."

"The conceptual power of Fate can be applied to any Essence domain of types Ka, Lo and Ren," the Book answers. "Fate does not connect across domain boundaries, such as Creation to Malfeas. It is not known if some domains have their own Fate, or whether _dharma_ does not apply. It is known that _dharma_ ceases to apply in proximity to the Wyld."

Rumika has heard much of this before, but still it's useful to hear everything put together so succinctly. Especially since she's so very distracted at the moment. "I never really thought of this before," she admits suddenly. "What if the outside influences on fate, which the Sidereals cannot see, are more significant than what they do?"

"That is one of the reasons the roles of Summoner and Protector are so significant," the Book answers.

Davron reasserts himself for a moment to ask a question of Yang. "You say that you sought to expand the power of the Sidereals with your workings of Fate. Was it out of a _reasoned_ decision that the abilities of the Sidereals weren't sufficient to deal with the problems facing the Realm, or was it more out of frustration, chafing against the limits that Fate imposed on you and others?"

Again Yang shrugs a little bit. "Tell me how a man distinguishes reason from emotion," he replies, sounding tense.

"You have had a very long time to think of it," says Gallius. "But perhaps there is no way to tell. Perhaps Davron also meant to ask if there was some specific reason you did what you did. We all desire more power, but I am beginning to see how dangerous a pursuit it is. I may pay with my sanity for my desire for it. Intentions are not as relevant as I had believed."

His voice is slightly louder than when Yang controls it, but mostly Davron distinguishes his own words by a subtle cast of facial expression, as if speaking inward to himself. "I suppose it's a hard question to answer in any case, Yang. Self-knowledge is, ironically, the hardest of all to gain, for we cannot readily distinguish what is true of ourselves from what we _want_ to be true."

".. No, it was not for any specific purpose," says Yang at last.

"Thank you, Yang. I am sorry to drag you over the coals again," says Gallius. "It is not fair, but I fear it was necessary."

Gallius voices another question, then. "So what can magic tell us about the things outside Fate? And also, Davron, if you do the work you performed on yourself on my spark, do you believe it will save me?"

"There are no theoretical limits on the power of sorcery," the Book answers. "Practical limits do exist. You may refer to those texts if you wish."

"Of course." Ramar considers, "What exactly is it you would wish to know about the things that lurk outside of Fate?"

Davron addresses Yang once more. "Thank you," he says softly. "The sutras may allow you to atone for the sins in your past life, but we the living may need to transcend that to prevent the sins of our future." Asserting himself once more, he shakes his head to Gallius. "That thing nearly destroyed me - and I'm convinced that all it did was to buy me some time. I'm not sure I'd be willing to take that risk again for myself, until I learn far more than I know now - though if you truly wish it, I could try to give you the opportunity to do it for yourself."

Gallius considers for a moment more, trying to focus her thoughts. "Well, if something outside Fate can alter Fate, maybe we can find a way to call upon something from Outside to fix the results of the Prophecy." She turns to Davron and shakes her head, "I am not a craftsman. I build Nations, not devices to change the soul. There is something destroying me that I cannot fight, Davron. For once, it seems I must rely wholly on others."

"As I understand it, things outside of Fate can alter Fate... though it may be that the Prophecy cannot account for beings outside of Fate, or the use of Essence... I believe." Ramar clears his throat, "I could be wrong, however. If I may suggest a course of action... before we perform this soul-searching examination on you, we study what it is Davron has brought back, so that we can ensure we do not accidentally trigger... this... with our examination..." he sounds rather concerned, particularly where Gallius is concerned. "I agree though, we must move quickly. And I am sure we will all help you fight this Gallius... as best as we can."

"I will examine you, as well," says Rumika. "It may be that where other things flounder, more simple medicines can help. Unlike the Solars of the First Age, we recognize this as a very serious danger. It seems they did not view it quite as we do. That, too, seems odd, though."

Gallius smiles at her friends, "Thank you. It seems that I get to be our test case. For once I'm willing to admit that I wish it was someone else. Or that I had the tools to fight this on my own. It's like a battle already, though."

Davron nods, and squeezes Rumika's hand. "We'll both help. And maybe you can help me find out what went wrong with my own experiments," he says to Rumika, smiling bashfully. "I'm so used to working with machines... maybe I'm not so good at working with machines designed to work on people."

Ramar smiles at Gallius, "You are welcome. For what it's worth, I am glad we have learned of this, and glad we are able to help you. What you are doing is rather brave. And because of this we may be able to save our entire world... who knows?" He does his best to sound hopeful.

Rumika smiles back at Davron, and then something tugs at her mind. "Other worlds may have other fates. Does this mean that Malfeas has its own prophecies? I have heard whispers of the prophecies of the Underworld. What if our problem could only be understood from an utterly different perspective?"

Davron nods firmly. "The answers may be _anywhere_, and we will have to have the courage to look for them wherever they may be," he agrees.

"I think for now we should just consider what we have learned," says Gallius. "If nothing is discovered, I hope Davron's soul surgery is up to handling me. There is another option, as well. Whatever Sa did. It is extreme, perhaps, but I will not let myself harm my people. Even if I have to surrender much of what I am to achieve it."

Rumika is still holding Davron's hand, and liking it very much. She smiles at him with a rather odd amount of shyness. "There is one thing I'd like to give to you, Davron, if you have a moment. I'm not sure if you would like to have it here or somewhere else, though."

Ramar wonders at Gallius' words. "If you must do it... I understand, but... I would rather not lose you... not now, not ever." He blushes, remembering that they do in fact have company, and places a hand on Gallius' shoulders. "Whatever can be done to save you... I hope that the cure is better than the disease."

Gallius smiles up at Ramar, "I do not want to lose myself, either," she replies. "But there are those I love more than myself, Ramar. You, more than any, should know that. After all, you are one of those, whether you would wish it or not."

Davron tilts his head and smiles, blushing slightly himself. "Well, I'm certainly not one to say no to a gift," he says, chuckling. "And, well, we've been talking about weighty matters... it would be quite refreshing to get something pleasant."

Rumika smiles at Davron and nods. "I.. I hope you find it pleasant." She steps in front of Davron then, reaching to hold his other hand, as well. With her usual smile, she leans in and gently kisses the craftsman, trying her best to not blush too much and failing as her cheeks turn crimson.

"And I love you more than myself, Gallius..." answers Ramar, who then laughs, slipping an arm around Gallius' waist as he watches Rumika and Davron. "But er, speaking of love..."

Davron has about enough time to open his mouth in surprise before his lips are enveloped. His own cheeks are aflame too... but the voices of Ramar and Gallius remind him that he needn't be embarrassed by love - not amongst friends. He is anyway, of course - but he accepts Rumika's affection wholeheartedly, and returns it in kind.

Gallius blushes a bit, herself. She leans against Ramar and whispers to him, "Getting any ideas?" She can't help but tease him a little. It helps her relax, despite everything that has happened lately.

Despite all her supposed experience in life, Rumika looks really quite unsure of herself. Still, she's not at all unsure about how she feels. She moves a little closer to Davron, showing no intention of being the one to break off this kiss.

Ramar chuckles, "Oh, one or two," he teases in kind. He squeezes Gallius affectionately, then taking his cue from Rumika and Davron, kisses Gallius rather tenderly. He sighs, relaxing against Gallius when all is said and done.

Davron doesn't take long to forget about Ramar and Gallius, though. He's busy right now... busy enjoying Rumika's nearness, and wondering why he didn't do this long ago... but mostly just kissing Rumika and holding her close. Finally, at long last, he eventually pulls back long enough to whisper, "How did you ever have the patience for someone as oblivious as me?"

That was not expected by Gallius, but she's hardly unhappy about it. She returns Ramar's kiss very affectionately, happy to let down the armor that normally stands between her and acting like a normal woman. And so everyone else present silently takes their leave, deciding that all the official business is handled, leaving the Solar love birds to enjoy each other's company. It is perhaps fitting that love conquers the fears that held this room just moments ago.

Rumika laughs softly, "You are difficult to read, Davron," she admits. "And I was so sure you were the right one. Where I come from, the man is supposed to speak. I hope you don't mind my breaking of custom. I wanted you to know, though."

Ramar barely even notes the others exiting the room. After all, it's quite easy to get lost in such affections... though all good things must come to an end after a while. This kiss too, must end. Ramar blinks, and has a rather silly sort of smile on his lips. "Just in case you were wondering what sort of ideas I was having," he whispers to Gallius, teasing all the while.

Davron smiles weakly. "It's the custom where I'm from too. But... I've always had a little trouble with customs. I'm glad you broke this one." And with that, he simply hugs Rumika close... letting the fears and doubts that plague the future be postponed, just for today.

In a few more moments, the Book of Three Circles is left alone in the chamber, as the happy couples break off to find privacy elsewhere. While the Solars fear the weakness brought upon them by their sparks, they can perhaps find some comfort in some of the greatest gifts of humanity: resilience and hope.
