There is much work to be done. The rest of the Circle is busy preparing for the coming battle. Ramar is preparing as well, in his own way. The Book of Three Circles rests nearby, and at present he is poring through 'The Threefold Paths of Heaven's Children', Chi-Yosh's gift from the West. The lineages of those who have come before may yield some important information as to the deadly foe they face. Of particular interest to him are those who were Sorcerers in bygone ages... the Dowager is known for her Magical prowess, perhaps in here, he may gain an insight as to who exactly she really was.

Addressing the Book, Ramar asks, "Are there any records from before the Deathlord known as the Dowager was known to exist? For that matter, are there any records at all about the first appearances of the Deathlords?"

"There are no Realm record summaries of such beings. Please consult the Historian's archives for more specific information."

"What are the last records entered about then," asks Ramar.

"By date, the last records the Book contains concern the disposition of the Book of Three Circles."

Ramar sighs to himself, remembering the more recent events. "Prior to the new Hierophant announcing her position and membership in the deliberative and the subsequent events, what is the date of the last known record, and what does it concern?"

"Those records also concern the disposition of the Book of Three Circles. Specifically, its storage in Sperimin and two changes in the role of Guardian."

Ramar says, "And what are the dates of those records?"

The answers the Book provides are in the old scheme of numbering. Ramar does some calculations, and concludes that both changes in Guardianship occurred around the time of Bagrash Kol's reign as master sorcerer.

Ramar begins a new line of questioning. Using the Threefold Paths as a reference point, he asks the Book of Three Circles a series of questions regarding the last known members of the Solar Deliberative before the two changes made during Bagrash Kol's reign as a master sorceror. He hopes to gain something, anything, a name, a date, some fact to go on that may lead to more information. The end of the 1st Age seems as good a place as any to begin looking.

Each and every name Ramar receives is traced thoroughly in the Threefold Paths. If the name can be found in the book, Ramar follows it in either direction, from the very first recorded bearer of the spark, to the last known member of that line. For true thoroughness, he even uses the Sagacious Reading of Intent to discern any hidden meanings. More than once, he comes close to giving up in frustration, but nevertheless continues with the line of questioning. A name, a date, an event... a lead of some kind must be found. Hours pass, Ramar has forgotten food, forgotten sleep, all he can focus on is the Question.

The names are then assembled into lists of likely names, given what Ramar is able to learn from the Threefold Paths. The next task at hand is to plumb the very depths of the Book of Three Circles for information regarding these names, paring down masses of irrelevant and trivial information to a point where he can find the next stepping stone in his quest. He must find a way to determine what event happened to create the Deathlords... perhaps, something along the lines of the last known surviving Solars around the end of the First Age.

The list of names is so great, however, that Ramar must find some way of selecting those who in fact have the possibility of becoming a Solar ghost and then subsequently a Deathlord. Presuming of course the Emissary's tale is true. He begins questioning the Book, seeking to discover Solars who are entombed, whose souls have passed on to Yu-Shan or Gaia, and any others who would not leave behind ghosts...

Finally, after extensive questions and dead-ends, Ramar steps back from the problem at hand. He spends some time reexamining his strategy, his process, then assembles what information he can and heads for his Volo. The trip to Yu-Shan is short, and without incident. He passes through the gates, by the lions and into the Celestial City quite easily. Now that he's here, he finds a few hints of doubt gnawing at him. It takes the walk to the Bureau of Endings to dispel them. Now that he's here, there must be no turning back.

There's an awkward air about the Bureau, owing to the fact that the Sidereals are conspicuously absent. Their presence, though subtle, is missed. Ramar enters, looking about casually, adopting a shy, resigned attitude as he locates a helpful god to speak with.

"So er, you can see," begins the Solar after having made his brief introduction. He proceeds to explain the nature of information he's after, being as tactful as possible. He's learned the power of words well enough from the Master, knows how to fit a paragraph into just three words, and these techniques he employs. Without being explicit, he manages to spell out what it is he's after, without being offensive he makes his request. "Knowledge truly is power," he comments. "Precaution is worth more than cure, after all." He is careful to fill out the required forms, in as meticulous detail as is required.

Thus the Solar makes his request. Of course this information requires more than a few forms and polite phrases. This sort of information is dangerous in the wrong hands. Ramar can only hope, as he provides a sample of his blood producing his finger for the pinprick of an instant that it takes to draw his blood, that his hands are not the wrong hands.

Now that the information, partial though it is has been assembled, Ramar busies himself with the task of assembling a staff. Assistants and aides who can travel far and wide. "I have here information that will help our cause. We do not have much time, so your speed is of the essence. Find every Scavenger Lord you can, track down libraries, scour them for tales of tombs in this place, tombs of the North and the South. Find tombs not on this list, find out as much as you can and report back here as swiftly as possible."

Ramar knows enough to split the colossal task up, dividing it among different groups who will travel in twos and threes. Ramar himself is a member of one of the groups. They set out, scattering into the winds. Scavenger Lords are paid for information, libraries are almost sacked, such is the intensity of the searchers. It takes time, yes, but tombs are added to the list, stories of restless ghosts and peaceful blessings abound when next they meet. There is much information, as accurate as can be expected, but it is there. "Now, we'll go through it, eliminate Solars who are dead and buried. They cannot possibly be who we hope to find."

Days pass. Though it is a daunting task, the list gradually grows smaller and smaller. Slowly but surely they are dwindling away falsehoods, dead-ends, and the like. Soon, the list will be small enough to make the effort of further searching worthwhile. "It has taken much effort... but I believe that soon, we'll know enough to find out more about... our adversaries." Ramar is exhausted. He has barely slept, barely eaten over the past few days, the task has been consuming his every moment.

When at last the information is sorted, Ramar rests. He sleeps a restless sleep, filled with names and dates and faces of those who've come and gone before. And yet somewhere, amidst all of this, there's a looming shadow. Mocking laughter echoes just on the edge of hearing, and suddenly it's as though he's surrounded by darkness. Ramar wakes up startled, looking around. "We're out of time."
