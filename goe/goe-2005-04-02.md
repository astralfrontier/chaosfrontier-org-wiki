Calibration is now just two days off. Egress has just returned from the meeting with Mask of Winters, the results of which have been shared with her circle as calmly as if Egress were talking about Rain. And oddly enough, the way she speaks of it instills in all those listening that same calm. It's a talent Gallius had, but did not use so naturally as Egress does. Egress has become a peaceful, soothing presence. Even now, when she's just looking out over Bridal Veil from her balcony, the people below look up and, just seeing her, find comfort and reassurance that their work has meaning.

With Egress' return, Ramar's relief has grown palpable. The meeting with the Mask of Winters was a frightening prospect to be certain... and the results even moreso. He joins Egress on the balcony, looking out over the city below. "They're glad to have you as their queen, you know."

Egress smiles, "I know," she says softly. "That's the only reason I am doing this," she explains. She raises a hand to wave out to her people, sighing softly. "It's difficult, sometimes, but when I think of all of them, it just seems right, somehow. It's important. There are so many things I can do for them."

"I don't doubt that. I don't think anyone has doubted that you can, or even that you will do much for them." Ramar nods down at those toiling away in the streets below. "It's very certain that you will. What is it you think you'll do next?"

"I have heard that there is trouble to the north and east," says Egress. "I fear that it may lead to war. The new promise of not sending the armies out in the name of conquest has emboldened those that were formerly holding back. I will keep my promise, but I will not let them kill each other without trying to stop it." The zenith continues to smile, laughing and waving a little girl who watches from below. The queen reaches to pluck the flower from her hair, letting it drop down towards the child below. The wind catches it, drawing it first this way, then that, and finally dropping the flower unharmed right in the waiting hands of the child.

"I think we can find a way to prevent them from fighting without... well, needing to send out an army. It is time for our nation to grow internally, to mature and develop into something marvelous." Ramar cannot help but smile in Egress' presence, almost as though every worry melts away. "What do you plan on doing?"

"I'm going to sing for them," says Egress. "And convince them their lives are worth more than the pride of two angry kings. I'm going to teach them the power of forgiveness. Justice untempered is an evil thing. It would leave us all condemned."

"Kinda like there should be moderation in all things?" Ramar leans on the railing of the balcony, eyes focused on the horizon. His head's tilted just a little, "I am sure you will succeed Egress. You're amazingly good at that."

"I think the wrong men lead them," says Egress. "But yes, there should be balance in things. You should not be so tight to the virtue of honor that you forget mercy and love. They are stronger forces."

"And all three can work in concert to make an effort greater than men can dream of." Ramar gestures out over the Nation, "This is all just one example of what just a few people are capable of... and we aren't even at our full strength yet. Well, at least, I hope I'm not at my full strength. I'd better still have room to grow."

"We have a long time to grow," answers Egress. She watches the people dart about, getting on with their lives. Still, they look up to see her. "But even if I grow no further, I'm happy this way. I have all the talents I need to make the Nation of the Sun a happy place."

"Indeed." Ramar chuckles, "It already is a happy place. And I'm sure you'll help keep it that way."

"What do you want, Ramar? I mean, what makes you happy? Gallius wanted to carve out a nation. She did so. I want to make a nation happy and safe, and I think I will do so. You have the secrets of Creation at your fingertips. What is it you will do with that power?"

"I... am not sure. Lots of things make me happy." Ramar turns the question back on Egress, "How about you? What do you think you'll do once the Nation of the Sun is safe, secure from those who would do it harm?"

"Safety is just the start," she says. "I want to make my people live like philosopher kings. I want them to be strong and certain in themselves." Egress smiles and continues, "And I want to help the other Solars find themselves homes. Places where their talents can be put to good use."

"How do philosopher kings live, Egress?" Ramar considers this, and looks down into the streets below. He gestures idly at a merchant, carting his wares through the city, "How would that one fit in among the philosopher kings? I'm curious..."

Egress smiles, "He would have all that he needs. Comfort, wealth, love. He would have wisdom to know that he needs to be part of the world, rather than sit outside it in a house of stone. The Silver Pact is part of the answer, but in its correction of behavior it seems to forget that civilization did not form because it had nothing to offer. It, too, is a gift."

"A noble goal, to be certain. I cannot wait to see that happen. To know that people will live their lives free of useless struggles, free of oppressing tyrants, and people who would harm them..." Ramar sighs, and stares off into the horizon again. "And yet..."

"And yet what?" asks Egress. "I know it cannot truly be so perfect. Not really. That's why it will take so much effort, after all. There will be things to learn and try. But I know I'm going to do my best."

"Well, I want to do more. I want to see what's out there, to see more of the world than anyone has before." Ramar shakes his head, "Your best will be more than enough. You can change the world with little more than a song, Egress. It might not be perfect, but it will be better than many things that have come before. It will give people something to strive for. And that's good."

"I hope so," says Egress. "We'll soon find out. And we still have a trip coming. Calibration is almost here. That means we will go to Yu-Shan again. That means the Sidereals will tell us what the new prophecy has revealed. I hope. I just wonder if we can ever really believe they tell us the whole truth. I will just trust them, though. They will do what they think is best."

"And I wonder what is going to happen because one of their number has not been present to make their new Prophecy." Ramar sighs, "I suppose I'm being paranoid, but... perhaps our newest friend might have seen something the others would have missed..."

"What shall be, shall be," corrects Egress. "Have more faith in the world," she gently chides. "It will be enough, because it has to be. The destiny of the world is changing. Creation is beginning to awaken once more."

"True... but Creation isn't the only force at work here. There are those who would stand against Creation." Ramar casts his gaze downward, then turns back towards Egress. "Those who would see all of this undone, lain in oblivion, or who would rule over all... making the world a slave to their whims. And now, I worry that I am playing into their hands. If... well, if what you have learned from your visit is true, which it likely is, and Sorcery is the gift of those who have been banished from the world... perhaps it is their means of striking back at their victors."

"You forget when that gift was given," answers Egress. "If it was the gift of the Yozis then, it was given not in wrath or misery. It was given before the hatred grew, else it would never have happened." She shakes her head, "Do not score your gifts. They are just another way to manipulate essence. If you think that the Yozis touch that, as well, you turn away from all that we are. I do not question the gifts of Lord Helios. Do you?"

Ramar looks troubled "It is precisely that it was given, that troubles me most. If you believe the tales to be true, it was in the earliest days of the First Age. When the enemy, fresh from their defeat still had many of their servants roaming free, wreaking what havoc they could upon the land. I find myself uncertain as to why they would give such a tool to those who slew their brethren. It cannot be for any purpose but to suit their own ends, when all is said and done."

"Are you so sure of that?" asks Egress. "Perhaps you should ask Helios and find the real answer, rather than guessing on what we think we know. We are still very young. I do not think the greatest power of the Solars would be something that is evil and damaging to Creation."

"It would be ironic, wouldn't it? The greatest power, power given not by the Incarna, nor their allies... a power that we believed to have discovered on our own... being ultimately what dooms us to bring about the ruination of all things, and tear asunder the boundaries between worlds." Ramar looks skyward, "Perhaps I can find the answer, if the true answer is known by any... it would be..."

"It would be.. whom? If not Lord Helios, who will you ask?" Egress sighs softly and turns away from the balcony, walking back into her room. "I didn't think you were such a chronic worrier. You should find the truth and then find a way to deal with whatever you learn."

"No, it would be the Unconquered Sun... I thought I'd said 'him'. I can think of no one better to ask." Ramar sighs softly, and turns away with Egress. "I don't usually worry this much, but... well, lately I've been trying to find my niche in this world. I'd rather not have my niche be the one that undoes it all."

"Gallius spoke often of the madness, and felt it coming upon her. She never used sorcery," says Egress. "I think you are afraid of something other than the flaw that is built into us. Do you think I might just be right?"

Ramar looks at Egress curiously, "I'm not sure... you might be. What do you mean, exactly? What other thing would I be afraid of?"

"Power. Responsibility. The fact that you will no safety nets if something goes wrong," says Egress. "If Chi-Yosh makes a mistake in a fight, he gets hurt, or maybe hurts someone. If Davron has a mistake when he's crafting, he ruins something. When you make a mistake casting a spell, you might level a whole city."

"It's true. The results of the most powerful things, gone awry are as devastating as spells designed specifically to _be_ devastating. And it is impossible to know how it will turn out until the time comes. In a fight, Chi-Yosh can gauge the difficulties of his opponent, read their moves, know them. Davron can discern flaws in the materials, in his tools... I have no such luxury. No way of knowing if I shall miscast, or if there is another who can break my spell..." Ramar sighs, and slumps back against a wall. "I think it's too much."

"You need to practice and gain confidence, and make sure that you are ready when the time comes," says Egress. "Like it or not, we will need the power of the sorcery. There is no escaping it. There can be no doubt the Deathlords command it."

"No doubt whatsoever. They wield it far more skillfully than I, as well. That will change... but they have the advantage of time, of experience. I shall have to accomodate for that." Ramar sinks down against the floor, legs in front of him. "I only hope I can."

"You need to find the strength of faith in yourself," says Egress. "I believe in you, but I cannot create your confidence myself. A time shall come for you, Ramar. A time when you will have to trust yourself or walk away. Perhaps that moment will give you the strength you desire."

"This is true. I'm curious though..." Ramar looks over at Egress, and asks, "How is it you found your strength, your faith in yourself? What gives you the confidence you have in droves?"

"I don't know," says Egress. "I guess it's something that nothing can give you. Confidence is something you take for yourself. It is something forged by being able to to face challenges. It's about handling failure and realizing that failure is the price you pay before you can succeed."

"What do you mean," asks Ramar.

"Think about what you are working towards," says Egress. "In my case, I'm preparing to not just create a wonderful Nation, but to help others craft their own much like it. To create a new world. I know I'm going to make a lot of mistakes. I may even hurt people from time to time. But in the end, I know it will be for the best. The more powerful you become, the more costly failures are. But if you do not risk them, your power will be held back and never shine. Do you think Helios gave us this," and here she points at her caste mark, "to hide under a bushel?"

"That makes sense. One cannot grow without turning towards the Sun. It is a chance that one takes, giving up the Earth's embrace to reach for the stars... but if we do not dream, if we do not try how will we ever rise to the heights of heaven?" Ramar smiles, "Thank you for putting up with my worries Egress... and thank you for helping to assuage them."

"It's what I'm meant for," says Egress. "The noonday sun shines to lead in its own way. But alone it would leave the world barren. We were given Circles so that we would always be among those who can help us when we have the need. My strength is faith. When you have faced the things I have, most fears fade away. I hope I can give you the same faith without having to walk the exact paths I have."

"It's not your only strength." Ramar stands, "And you are right, I think I was being overwhelmed by the risks to others... I have no problem where it is only my life on the line. I would gladly put aside my life and death to help you, or any of the others in our Circle... but where I might harm others, it is different. I do not wish to, but if that will happen, I will do what I can to learn from those mistakes, to become better for having made them." He walks over to Egress, and hugs her gently, "Thank you, thank you for reminding me of what is most important."

Egress wraps Ramar in a warm hug, kissing his cheek softly. "Thank you for rescuing me," she murmurs. "And if you wish to practice your craft in a safe place, I think you shall find many potential sites soon. I imagine Azel will have us travel to places far from cities."

"We will see. I have something in mind... we'll see if I can't learn something in the end." Ramar smiles warmly, "It will be good to get out in the world again. Almost as good as it is to be here in your arms."
