It doesn't take much for the Celestial Lions to become aware of what Chi-Yosh, the Ronin, and several other parties observed first-hand in the Loom. Several Sidereals witnessed the initial reconstruction via sorcery and this evidence only serves to amplify their testimony.

Acting on this, the Lions gather up the implicated parties and Nara-O, director of the Division of Secrets and senior god, performs the questioning.

It develops, according to this august being's report and to observations made of the interrogation by a mixed group of Celestials and spirits, that the modification of the Loom was made not to attack Chejop Kejak, but to attack another being - Wu, the being whose power was used to conceal the deadly sorcery that struck at the senior Exalt. Those questioned suggest that the attack was a sort of emergency attempt to divert the power of the assassin's magic at the last moment.

After a few highly urgent questions to both the Fisher and the Ronin, Egress grows to understand the magnitude of the problem a bit. The Pattern Spiders are the product of Autochthon, and were fashioned to do what the Sidereals and the Maidens themselves did once, long long ago - manipulate the Loom. They are the new caretakers of the Loom of Fate. The Sidereals once possessed as much access - and perhaps a bit more - but the knowledge of how to use that power has been lost, hidden, or deliberately destroyed.

Why the Loom itself? Why not persuade Wu to do something, somehow? Because gods cannot betray their own essential nature. Wu could no more cease to be Wu than rain could cease to be wet. Only the ultimate arbiter of what is - the Loom of Fate - could do that.

Egress ponders this all for a time. She's not great handled of mysteries. Yet she will try her best. "There is one thing I do not understand yet. We must know if they failed or if they succeeded." She ponders for a time and finally asks, "Who told them to do this?" She has a few guesses already, of course. She doesn't yet grasp what the meaning of each would be, however.

"The Priestess," is the universal answer.

---

Armed with this information, it is time to confront the Priestess directly. Egress thinks this is perhaps best kept fairly quiet. This is not the time to draw attention. The Zenith will first seek the aid of at least one of her kind who has an ear for truth. That is not all, however. She wishes to find a Lunar of some standing who will come as well. When she has those who are willing to take one more step in deciding the ultimate destiny of Creation, she will go seek the Priestess. Egress has a feeling she will be expected.

And so Egress, joined by a small squad of the Celestial Lions, and flanked by Erisus - who has since regained his standing in Heaven - and his student Sun and Moon, enters the study of the Priestess in her Celestial Manse.

The woman is sitting at her desk in the study, for that is where the group is escorted by her servant-spirits. Her eyes never waver from her guests as they enter one by one, and without a word she presents several sheets of parchment and extends them for inspection.

Egress enters calmly, studying the Priestess curiously. She still hasn't a clue what to make of the woman yet. No matter her opinions, there is a matter of proper respect. Egress bows first, then accepts the parchment with both hands. Saying nothing to the Priestess, she will see what has been written and then read aloud the words so the others may hear.

What is written here is a confession, deeply detailed, and signed in the woman's own flourish-filled signature. It describes the release of ancient lore by the Steersman to his Inner Circle prior to the Second Prophecy. Even before the great ritual, Kejak anticipated danger of some kind, and he made sure to disseminate the knowledge he'd once held onto with clenched fists.

Part of that lore was the Book of Night With Moon, a treatise on the Loom of Fate written by the first Sidereals who had worked with Autochthon's Gearsmen in studying it.

Initially no more than a spider's web of Essence and Wyld shaped into some impossible whole, and pulsing with the Primordials' energy, Autochthon had molded it into something like the shape it has today. And he drew out the power of the Five Maidens, those goddesses of destiny who had been birthed from it by the Primordials, and from their Essences made the Sidereal sparks.

What she writes after this confirms the testimony of her underlings - that this unique gift was used once again to try and save their leader.

"If this power has always been in the hands of the Steersman," begins Egress, "Why was it never used as a weapon against the Solars?" She frowns thoughtfully and asks, "Are there risks? When you touch Fate this directly I imagine it puts the very future in danger, doesn't it?"

"The use of it was forbidden by Autochthon during the First Age," the Priestess replies. These are the first words she speaks, and her voice does not have the haughty tone of earlier. She sounds resigned, more than anything else. "I do not know why."

"What will you do now?" asks Egress. "The Steersman is gone. The future is in danger. Your attempt to curb fate failed, yet the knowledge you have remains. It was used in a way that is against the laws of Heaven, and if I understand things rightly, even at their height the Deliberative did not stand above those laws. Justice must be served."

"Yes. It must be," the woman replies. She stands from her desk, waiting. The Lions advance on her.

"I wish to sue for clemency for this desperate act," says Egress calmly. "This crime was committed at a time more unique and dangerous than has been seen in an age. Let us not forget that even the Powers of Yu-Shan themselves rose against the lawful makers of Creation once."

The Lions pause, turning their heads to regard Egress coolly. The Priestess cocks an eyebrow but says nothing.

"Justice must be served, but we have lost enough wisdom already," says Egress. "We must not waste more. This isn't what we are meant for. I am Chosen of Helios, who knows both justice and mercy. If you will cast aside your ambitions, Priestess and do all you can to aid the new Deliberative in its attempt to find the killer of the Steersman, I will go before the Powers and ask that you be my charge for as long as your sentence should last. I do not know for certain, but I think that is what your real destiny is."

"My ambitions? I will not cast them aside," she says, a hint of defiant strength reappearing in her voice. "My ambitions are the safety of existence." But she says no more, and as the Lions bind her as they did the Solars, Erisus lets out a quiet sigh beside Egress.

"Those are not the ambitions I was speaking of," says Egress. "That desire is one you should keep." Egress watches the Lions quietly, "You must cast aside any desire to lead. You must forget what was and accept the return of the Celestials. The Sidereals alone no longer are the masters of Creation. The Lunars and the Solars are no longer your enemies. If you accept this, I will speak for you. If you wish to be your own master, I am afraid you have already betrayed your ambition. Your crime put a stop to that. Accept this offer, or accept whatever harsh justice the Lions have prepared for you. I have offered you this twice now." There is a gentle hint that there may not be a third offer.

"We shall see," the Priestess murmurs. Calmly she walks away in the company of the Lions, but turns once more and adds a quiet coda to the proceedings: "I would betray myself if I didn't first consider the consequences of your offer. You must understand."

"You will have one more chance," answers Egress quietly. "I fear the Lions may not give us much time. Know that if you turn me down, Creation can only suffer for it. Am I safer with your guidance, or on my own? Think on it."

Meanwhile, Davron has begun to examine the Arcanicine; but he is persistently distracted by his memories of the figure Ramar claimed to have seen during Between the Minute and the Hour, and that Chi-Yosh had seen glimpses of earlier. And he remembers his own thought, when he had first heard the figure described: that it resembled the Unconquered Sun himself.

Davron had dismissed that notion when he realized that such an attack, being against the laws of Heaven, was contrary to Helios' nature; the Unconquered Sun can no more commit murder than Wu can withdraw the power of secrecy from a working Arcanicine. Besides, it was the shadowy outline of a four-armed figure that assaulted Kejak... Davron's eyes go wide open, then, at an idea so big that he must speak it aloud to himself: "Does the Unconquered Sun have a shadow?"

"Everything is his shadow," hisses the voice of Wu, the interrogator of Havesh. The Solar had no knowledge of his presence until he spoke, but now he's fully aware of the inimicable figure hovering nearby.

Davron jumps in surprise - he had had little experience with Havesh's own sudden appearances, so the sudden manifestation the god from whose Havesh's power arose is an astonishment to the Solar. "What do you mean by everything, Wu?" he asks, when he regains his wits.

"What does the sun not shine on?" asks the spirit, casually examining the machine and running a talon-like fingernail along the artfully crafted edges.

"Not Malfeas, for example - that is illuminated by Ligier the Green Sun," answers Davron. "All of Creation, though, at least. But if Helios can shine in the sky of Creation yet also manifest in the shape of a four-armed man, could not his shadow also manifest itself as the shadow of a four-armed man?"

"I see no reason why not." Wu sounds almost disinterested - his attention is clearly on the device, but it occurs to Davron that this could be a ruse. A trap of some kind, made to trick the Solars into some crucial and fatal admission. Another part of his mind watches this devious train of thought unfold, realizing that it does not come from his own thoughts. It comes because Wu is merely present.

Wu says, "Did you see such a shadow?"

"Two of my Circle have seen a shadow like that," answers Davron - despite himself, he finds himself acting on that fleeting suspicion, and does not speak of where and how. "But in both cases, they saw the shadow, but they did not see Helios himself."

"Fascinating." The spectral figure finishes his circuit of the machine, and withdraws the clawed and pallid hand into the sleeve of its cloak. "I am mirrored in this machine, and it has part of my power without my consent. Whatever is made in the image of something draws strength from its inspiration. Sympathy. An elementary lesson."

Davron nods. "Likewise, Helios' shadow would have something of his power, if one were to consider it as a separate entity." The Solar sorcerer shakes his head in befuddlement. "But how could it have _become_ separated from him? There is sorcery to steal a man's shadow from him, or to animate one's own shadow... but mortal sorcery could scarcely affect Helios, if he did not wish it." And Helios could no more deliberately send his shadow to assassinate Kejak than he could deal the blow in person.

"The only beings that ever held such power over the Unconqered Sun are the..." Davron trails off. "The creators of the gods. There is one among them who is the shadow of every creature who has ever lived. And his power is sealed away, bound with his fellows to their prison beyond Creation." The sorcerer's brow furrows. "But this is Calibration - the time when all boundaries are at their weakest." He stands up from the Arcanicine - that investigation can wait. "I must find Egress," he says.

Behind him, Wu runs a pale hand lovingly over the machine's exterior.

---

"You said you saw the characters of the Pact shifting," Davron is saying to Egress, as he finds her returning from the Priestess' Manse. "I've just had a disturbing idea about that. Can we find Ramar? I think we need someone skilled in reading divine contracts."

"I think I can find him," says Egress. "Or at least have him found. The Lions are challenging, but they keep an eye on people. They also seem to be at least a bit willing to work at our side. They will naturally be accompanying us if we are going to have a look at the Pact." She doesn't seem to mind the entourage so much now. "I think we also should ask a Lunar to come with us, and a Sidereal, if any are willing. The Solars no longer need stand alone, my friend. The Celestials will stand together."

Together with Wu, Erisus, and the Ronin, the Solar Circle eventually gathers itself together. The tomb-like room where the Pact is inscribed is duly opened once again, and the group enters.

Two other beings are expected - ancient spirits associated with Law and Truth, said to be the most erudite of the scholars that have studied the great agreement between Man and Malfeas.

Davron explains, as spirit and Exalt prepare to enter. "Chi-Yosh and Ramar, you both saw a shadowy figure resembling our patron. My speculation is that it may have been His actual shadow, somehow stolen from him. Now, only one being I know of would have that power - one of the beings bound by the Pact written here - and normally this Pact would prevent that entity from reaching beyond its prison."

Davron's voice lowers, for the names of the Yozis are not to be trifled with. "But on Calibration, all boundaries are weaker - and this Pact is one of them. What we're looking for is whether there was _any_ way, any at all, for the Ebon Dragon to have exerted his will here in Yu-Shan. And I doubt he could have acted alone, so I want to know what it would have taken to exploit whatever loopholes we might find."

"It will take time," remarks Erisus wearily. Nevertheless the two spirits arrive in due course, and together with Ramar, the group begins the process of piecing together just what the Pact really means.

---

Egress looks over the pact in a new way. She doesn't seek the logical, lawful following she attempted in the first viewing. It's a living thing, and it defies any mortal logic. No. This time, she takes in the hidden areas, watching the words like one would study a great work of art, her eyes focusing only on those words that seem the most distinct, the most powerful. The Ebon Dragon is a shadow. She is trying to find paths in the pact that seem most like a shadow, lurking and largely discounted due to the proximity of something of more immediate import.

It is Davron who theorizes, but it is Egress who discovers. The Pact's organization still escapes her for the most part, but what she realizes is that the natures of the Primordials emerge like islands in specific sections of it. And she has found that which deals with the Ebon Dragon.

Davron's own researches started with a known touchstone - the sections governing the summoning of demons, which Davron himself has personally used. Then, as Egress announces her discovery, he joins her at that section of the Pact. The Ebon Dragon _is_ shadows, and so wherever shadows are cast in Creation, some aspect of the Ebon Dragon is necessarily there. This section of the Pact, then, must be what normally prohibits the Dragon from influencing those shadows in any way other than the natural. If the loophole Davron suspected is anywhere, it is here.

In letters that strain to leap from stone walls and assault the reader, the Pact spells out disturbing quotations. It is written less like a legally-binding document among mortals, and more like a story or set of sutras. Davron reflects on Yang's teachings, realizing what Egress now knows - that sutras empowered with Essence affect dharma as well. Powerful words can change the way things are. Charms and spells are more refined, but the Pact is itself a primal engine for enforcing reality.

"'The first light cast the first shadow,'" the group reads together, and other passages too seem relevant. "'The Sun walks, the Moon skulks, and the ten thousand things draw them down and cast their nemesis upon the ground.'"

In particular, one passage stands out. "'There is no shadow without light, and there is no light without shadow.'" The truth of it is apparent. Shadows do not exist without a source of light to cast them. And, naturally, wherever there is light there will be something obscuring or obstructing it, except in a total void.

Gradually another meaning becomes clear. Shadows are nothing more than darkness, and darkness can certainly exist without light. Torches gutter and die; the Sun and Moon leave the sky at times. Even fireflies and other living light-sources must eventually die. But darkness is eternal - and this portion of the Pact changes that.

Once, there was Darkness, and it spread its power over everything that existed. But now, the Pact has required that darkness be linked to light. What was once Darkness is now merely a shadow, requiring the balancing presence of the Unconquered Sun, Luna, and the light of the Five Maidens. The Ebon Dragon was made subservient to them.

After contemplation and the hushed huddle of contemplation, Chi-Yosh gazes back towards the Pact. "To commence an act so great as to slay the Steersman in the Halls of Heaven when all the Exalts had been called, it requires the greatest shadow of all as a vehicle."

---

Egress is more than pleased at the suggestion of visiting Helios. After all, who better knows where his shadow might have been than the Unconquered Sun himself? Egress manages to contain her joy at the opportunity to see her Lord once more. It is with pride that she will come into his presence. She feels her confidence grow with each step. She softly murmurs, "I'm finally becoming who I was born to be."

The Unconquered Sun is involved in a game of tremendous complexity with several other powerful beings of Yu-Shan. He can be found in one of the large ampitheaters of the city, and as he looks up and greets the approaching Solars, the other players retreat for a moment.

"The Glass Bead Game," the warrior explains, gesturing with an arm at the playing field, which staggers the imagination. Egress finally detects some sort of pattern to one corner of the affair, and realizes with a shock that it's the representation of a battle between the Realm's Legions and some other hostile force.

Davron swallows, trying to think of a clever way to describe his question, but nothing sounds right. Finally, he simply says what's on his mind, foolish though it sounds. "Helios, is... is your shadow where it's supposed to be?"

The Unconquered Sun waves a hand; the scene disappears, and the Solars seem to be standing miles above the highest cloud. Below them, so far away that mountains appear to be mere bumps, patches of light and dark can be seen, in all the green and blue hues of the living world. Clouds mask parts of the scene from inspection. The Solars very quickly realize just exactly what vantage-point he is presenting them. "Ask what's on your mind," he says gently.

"When Ramar witnessed the re-enactment of Chejop's death through the Mask of Secrets, he saw the shadow of a four-armed figure in armor," says Davron slowly. "And when Chi-Yosh was looking into the possibility of demonic involvement in the Steersman's death, he too saw that shadow. To strike the Steersman unseen by any normal senses, it must have had great power indeed - and in its shape, it looked as if it could've been _your_ shadow."

"And if it was?" asks Helios, pointing down at the distant mass of Creation. It is as though he brought the Circle to the chariot in which he is said to ride, or perhaps it's an illusion. "Down there is my shadow. What do you all think Ramar really saw?"

Davron scratches his head, looking down, though his head swims at the sight. "If that is your shadow, then the Unconquered Sun is a dazzlingly bright globe of light, that brings life to the world, and that blinds mortal men if they stare upon it directly." He looks up again. "My eyes tell me that I see a four-armed man before me. Where is _its_ shadow?"

"There is no globe. There is no man. There is the Unconquered Sun, and the forms he is fated to take," Helios replies cryptically. Then he gives one of those jovial, winking smiles. From a pocket he produces something which he presents to Davron. It appears to be a perfectly rectangular block of jade, and he quickly conceals it again. Then he presents another piece of jade, this one shaped into a single disc. After another moment, he opens his hands fully, revealing them both to be the same piece - a cylindrical shape. Rectangular when viewed side-on, circular when viewed top-down.

"I cast shadows on the ground when I walk as a man. I cast shadows over Creation from the time I rise to the time I set. If you are looking for a killer made from my shadow, don't look for my shadow. Look for the power using my shadow. Remember Wu, forged from a river of loss and forgetfulness. He isn't that river, and he isn't those feelings, but they define who he is."

Davron nods. "We've been trying, sir. We came to you, more than anything else, because our search for that power has come up empty so far." He pauses. "What, then, _could_ use your shadow? The one being I could think of is sealed behind the Pact, and when we looked, we saw..." Davron shrugs helplessly. "We saw that every shadow is subservient to the light that casts it. And we didn't see anything that would say otherwise."

"The Pact didn't always exist," says Helios, raising a finger in reminder. "Is it older than me?"

Davron looks more puzzled than ever. "Of course not," he says. "You were already there when the Pact was written, and the Ebon Dragon was there earlier still. But..." and now Davron's brow furrows, "does the Pact cover _everything_? Or is there some way the Ebon Dragon could have contrived to hold something in secret from the gods, when they wrote the Pact? Something that he has kept hidden all these hundreds, thousands of years, for the right moment?"

"In fact, there is. There's a reason for it," Helios answers calmly.

Davron's eyes widen. Could he finally be on the right track at last? "And what is it? And what is the reason?" he asks softly.

"The Ebon Dragon forged a lieutenant from the power of my shadow. I do not speak of it lightly. Because to call him forth from Malfeas, you need only say his name. And when he comes, he and I must battle."

"And if we saw him, does that mean you must battle him?" asks Egress quietly.

"It means that his power was used in Yu-Shan, and that it lurks still - an afterimage or echo. If he were here, it would be ... known."

Chi-Yosh asks carefully, "His power was envoked? How could one channel such a being? Or is he like Wu?"

A flick of Helios' finger is sufficient to ignite Chi-Yosh's Caste Mark.

"Who would know?" asks Davron. "Who would know if this lieutenant has been in Yu-Shan?"

"EVERYONE would know, Davron," Helios says sternly. "The city's towers would be falling with the ferocity of the battle."

"My Lord," asks Egress gently. "He was forged from your shadow. Light and Darkness are balanced in many ways. You and your adversary are nearly equal in power, aren't you?"

"Nearly."

"Will you let us fight beside you when the time comes?" asks Egress.

"You won't have a choice, I expect," murmurs Helios. "On that day, everyone will fight."

"So the lieutenant of the Ebon Dragon has not been here in person," says Davron. "Merely his power was invoked, and that left its mark behind. But... whoever invoked him would need to know his name..."

"Yes. Find that person, and you will find your assassin. Or, perhaps, one of them."

Davron nods. "So now we search for an idea - we search for someone who knows this name. And who had the ability to channel its power," he adds, tapping his own forehead.

"Power comes in many ways," reminds Helios. "Even mortal men can work the magic of the gods with enough luck, wisdom and effort. They don't need sparks or Charms. But those things simplify matters immensely."

Davron nods. "But this name is surely a closely guarded secret. There should only be a small number of beings, be they gods or men, who are _supposed_ to know that name." He sighs. "I fear we may be looking for someone who _isn't_ supposed to know it, that's all."

"Or who were given it."

"So it's another search for lore, then," says Egress. "I hope the Priestess and her fellows have considered my offer carefully. And I hope my Lord Helios does not frown upon my request for mercy upon the lawbreakers. It just seems that now is the time for us to stand together once more. I have a feeling this new line of thinking will lead us down a road we best not tread alone."

Helios nods. "You've claimed the right to dispense justice over the Celestial Exalted, Egress. Now you must exercise it; claiming that power, and using it wisely, is for you to do."

Davron nods. "So... I suppose the best place to start, then, is to speak to those who are known to know the name. They are the ones who might know if the name has escaped beyond them - and of course, we must not discuss this matter with anyone who doesn't even know the name exists." He looks up at the Unconquered Sun once more. "So who should we speak with first?"

"As far as I know, the Ebon Dragon and myself - of those living."

Egress bows to Helios, rather focused on what the Unconquered Sun has told her. She didn't quite grasp what she did at the time. Now the fullness of it dawns on her. Somehow, it does not feel intimidating. It feels.. right.

Davron says, "And of those unliving?"

The Sun smiles and shrugs. "They're beyond my reach to know or predict."

"But some might know a great deal about them," murmurs Egress. "I think I know who we should speak to first, at least. We must speak with Black Ice Shadow about this. Indirectly, of course."

The Unconquered Sun frowns. "Do not reveal what I have said," he commands. "You may inquire, but do not give **anything** away."

Davron bows as well. "Of course," he says. "Thank you for your help." He is not quite certain who to ask, or even _how_ to ask - but at least now he has a better idea of what he is searching for.
