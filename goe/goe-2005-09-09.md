The sea is a perfect mirror of the sky as the skyship descends upon the water-bound Dragonblooded vessels. The reflection of the ship cutting serenely through a lattice of Essence cannon bursts wavers and becomes scattered foamy surf as the airship passes near enough for Chi-Yosh to disembark on one of the ship. Ramar is careful to keep the ship out the firing arc of at least one other ship as he moves toward the second... "Egress, I do believe this is your stop..." And then, he sets his sights on the third.

Gripping the rigging like the reins of a horse, the Su'Katan's body bobs with the jar of the ship evading thunder-birthed essence blasts. With a salute to the captain of the airship, he releases and drops, backwards in the air and down. Chi-Yosh's hand hooks into the rigging of the ship below, swinging him like a monkey onto the deck amid a sea of salty men, answering their curses of anathema.

Egress is quite ready to go, slipping onto the back of Jin-nu, the glowing servant of the Sun is carried with a graceful leap onto the deck of her enemy's ship. She does not wade straight into the fray, but instead holds up her hand, the form of her naginata suddenly appearing there as she cries in a voice as clear as the sea air, "Hear me, raiders of the sea! Set aside your weapons and you will be spared." With a flourish she whips forward the tip of her naginata, it's blade glowing painfully bright, "Defy me, and I shall show no mercy. Choose swiftly!"

Davron has been hanging onto the rail with a deathgrip as Ramar's evasive maneuvers threaten to send him toppling over. Now as the Circle's airship slews toward the remaining vessel, he calls out, "Steady for a moment!" The vessel dips beneath another gleaming blast from the Essence cannon, and then levels off as it passes by the enemy ship, taking advantage of the weapon's recharge time to give Davron a stable platform. Arrows clatter against the hull and flash past Davron's head as he carefully judges his targets to return fire. Unlike his fellows, calls of defiance do not come easily to his lips; rather, his answer is in the twang of his bowstring as he returns fire.

The hardened sailors are not supernaturally endowed, and they know fear as intimately as any man or woman in the Age of Sorrows. Perhaps less so, for they are the constant companions of the Dragon-Blooded and live in the empire that these heroes have forged. Perhaps more so, for all the atrocities that empire has perpetrated. For all their history, one lesson has always remained: the words of a shining demigod are to be heeded without hesitation. They depart their posts in droves, leaving behind a trio of Exalted.

"I want to speak to the captain of this vessel!" The Dawn demands, and the men merely ready their blades. He takes an offensive stance. It starts at Chi-Yosh's shoulders, the first rock in a slow avalanche of motion. The Solar's body rolls and snaps, the rockslide like a pebble into a pond, sending men flying back in an outword circle and sliding across the deck.

"Right then. You keep those sailors from swamping me, and I'll keep the Essence cannons from blasting our ships to ribbons. Understand?" Ramar maneuvers the ship as best as he can to give Davron a nice platform to fire volley after volley from, then rushes with an almost unearthly speed towards the edge of the ship, hanging between sky and sea and ship for a moment, then landing with his sword flourishing out. His ships flex as the boat rocks with his impact, and it looks like he may just know what he's doing in this case. "We can do this the easy way, or the hard way... either one's fine... but I'm taking this ship. And you're not touching mine."

One of the Tiger-Warriors that Egress trained months back, a crewman named Rikayu of Bridal Veil, smoothly takes over the helm. He nods confidently, visible to Davron out of the corner of his eye.

Nevertheless, some of the Ragara sailors, unimpressed with Ramar's declaration, are already flinging grappling hooks toward the flying intruder. "You heard the man! Our vessel is off limits!" calls Davron, glaring, as he leaps from the deck behind Ramar. The golden half-circle is already aglow on his forehead, and now the purple and gold of his anima banner flares about him - in midair, Davron pulls the bowstring twice, and arrows fly unerringly to sever the boarding lines.

Chi-Yosh waits until he sees the Exalted defenders of the ship, before bellowing out parlay to them.. "I am Chi-Yosh of the Nation of the Sun, representative of Azel, Keeper of the Antiquities of the Sea. You are plundering a lost city, claimed by the goddess Azel. If you cooperate, I offer peace and negotiation. There is a way you can walk away with treasure and we without violence, if you listen."

The captain wears simple armor, a jade that sparkles in the light. He is gruff-looking and bearded, the very archetype of a 'man of the sea', and flanking him are two robed and bald-headed figures. They smile together, advancing forward like predatory cats hunting their prey.

Chi-Yosh frowns inwardly, but shows no fault in the lack of his presence. Very well. He clears his throat, straightens himself up, and in the one moment his lash out, stealing the hat of a dozen paces from him. The sun beats off of his orichalcum-blessed skin as he waves the cap before him, tossing it in the air, and with a simple flick of the wrist, shears it into tatters that are eaten by the wind, taken wing from his talons gifted by starmetal. "The Goddess Azel accepts only the most capable of champions, and Helios grants only the best. I would encourage you to hear my offer before letting your swagger spell your fate."

"Hold," booms the captain. The monks - for they can be nothing else - pause in their predatory advance. The bearded man gestures at the other ships. "I have no say over them, though." It seems that some sort of peace has been bought, at least here and now.

"Azel," speaks Chi-Yosh, "Is a harsh mistress of her domain. But, those who live in her domain have a better chance of taking the relics from below than man. You are welcome to go beneath the waves and look at the city, and catalog what you see, and what you want. If I speak to her, and speak to her _well_, she may agree to have the elementals bring up what it is you seek here. I cannot promise you everything. But with every piece as equal in her eyes, that which you want may be gained over all your plunder. Now, I offer this to avoid scarring your armor and your ship, in exchange for a delay and a smaller cache."

"And what will I take back to House Ragara, to keep my head?" asks the captain.

Chi-Yosh says, "I don't know what your House demands of you. All I can council you in this is thus: make a list of what you want of that which lies below. I don't know how she will rule, but if she comes in your favor, you will get top pick of the list. My hope is that each ship accepts my offer, and enough plunder is granted for the effort to not be in vain."

On the ship which Egress alights, the eyes of the Ascending Lioness take-in her foes swiftly. She sees against her a monstrous form with an enormous weapon and another wearing very little by way of protection. She knows little of ships or naval warfare. For the moment, it seems to matter not at all. She is ready, she knows her foes must be taught the truth of their inferiority first, and she is prepared to enlighten them with the powerful gifts of the Unconquered Sun.

The decision is made. The Faith of the Celestials sings, bearing with it the prayers of ruin for the corruption of the pretenders, the thieves, the Dragon Blooded. Its first target is a mountain of jade that stands against the will of Azel, carried swiftly by the rushing hooves of Jin-nu, the steed bursting forward over the deck of the ship, her agile feet untroubled by the toss of the sea, her eyes glowing in the light of the Zenith's shining wrath.

The charge comes on like the surge of a tsunami, but Jin-nu leaps at the last moment, spinning into the air. Egress, already a great rider before she was exalted, clings to the back of her steed using her powerful legs, and as the spin turns her upside down above her foe, swings Faith of the Celestials first from the left to the right and then, banishing and reforming it back from right to left, the air screaming as her essence-fortified limbs seek to deliver a most physical manifestation of the displeasure of Helios twice in the space of a blinking eye.

Egress's blows, though largely blocked by the power of the Dragon Blood's armor, both find their mark, marring the flesh of her foe as she is carried swiftly away by the speed of Jin-nu. The steed's rapid motions carry her past the second mast, and she bolts then across the ship, putting as much rigging between her and the enemy as she can.

The armored warrior holds his goremaul aloft, calling out a raging sandstorm as his anima banner flares to life. His companion narrows her cobalt eyes, chanting a spell and drawing out a similar sort of power. Her aura is the stealthy death of the calm cold night air, and her body is coruscant with sparkling motes as her sorcery draws nearer to completion.

Egress looks past the Real, considering her foes carefully. Sorcery is hardly a promising thing for her to oppose with just a spear. Fortunately her Lord gifted her with wits and intellect. Essence rushes through her suddenly, and wordlessly she directs the formidible strength of her mount at the second mast. With a terrific burst of power Jin-nu and her rider arc into the air again. The steed slams all four hooves into the shaft of the mast, driving it at the Dragon Blooded and their hidden allies and with the same motion, heading skyward, arcing from the mast falling in ruin to the one farthest from the dragon bloods, flipping in mid-air and finally alighting atop the crow's nest, far above.

Essence flares from the warrior as he instinctively pushes his companion out of the way, eliciting a yelp from her. The spell flares and dies, sparking flames to catch here and there on the deck. She is thrown clear, and the mast descends on him.

Atop the mast, Egress whirls her spear, readying herself for the attack once more. There is tremendous rush of wind past her as Jin-nu carries her down with a single leap, bearing down all her power towards the pinned dragon-blood. Mid-flight, she bursts into an ever greater light, as she binds not one, but many charms to her at once, the power of Lightning Strikes Twice revealing itself at last.

Egress' explosive attack shatters past armor of unbreakable jade, tearing into flesh that seems strong enough to make the armor look weak. She darts past the foe, glaring back as Jin-nu carries her to the other end of the ship, waiting expectantly for the battle to continue.

There is a heaving sound as the remainder of the mast splinters, and the armored colossus rises. Beside him, the Air-Aspect sorceress reaches out her hand, and a flame flies from one of the torches mounted on the railing. It explodes outward into a sword of radiant fire, circling her rapidly, and Egress recognizes the Virtuous Guardian of Flame. "Crane flies heavenward!" she cries, and both of them leap straight upward, into the rigging.

Egress watches her foes with a thoughtful frown. These Dragon Blooded are resilient. She urges Jin-nu onward, under the mast her foes have climbed and towards the far end of the ship. As she goes, she raises her right legs and with one fluid motion whirls herself to be riding backwards, trusting Jin-nu to guide her true as the Solar uses the force of the motion and the power of essence to hurl her spear at the sorceress and her fiery guardian.

The haughty sorceress is nevertheless nimble as the wind as she breezes past the attack - and she would not have been successful at all if her guardian sword of flame hadn't rippled forward to decisively block the spear.

The woman has chosen to evade attack; the armored warrior, surprisingly agile despite his injuries and armor, is leaping across the rigging and sprinting across rope, taking up position on the arm of the rear-most mast of the ship.

Egress frowns, momentarily studying the nearest canon. It offers nothing of use yet, but she will remember it, at least. She diverts her attention instead to the sorceress. Urging Jin-nu forward, she pushes herself to her feet, waiting for the lift she is about to be given. Like an arrow on the string the sudden buck of Jin-nu launches her skyward, Faith of the Celestials held at the ready as she soars towards the sorceress.

The flaming sword effortlessly deflects Egress' attacks. The sorceress smiles, already drawing out Essence to form another spell...

"I said my ship's off limits." Ramar gestures with his sword. It's not a very pleasant gesture. "See that man up there? Right now, he can see each and every last one of you. Probably even count the number of mites on your head. On a good day, he can knock 'em off you without touching a hair. On a bad day, well..." He lets his voice trail off meaningfully, allowing them to fill in mentally what he has not said aloud. It's probably more weighted that way. "We're here to see to it that things below are respected, as is befitting Azel. You lot need to stop what you're doing. There's no two ways about it. You have already started down the road that ends in doing things the hard way. Please, for your sake and mine, let's not go down that road. We can, if you so choose, find an amenable solution, I'm sure."

The captain of this ship, a square-jawed and athletic (if not attractive) woman with dirty blond hair in a pigtail, makes a rough whistle. The two swordswomen flanking her halt in their own advances, and she cocks her head. "Speak."

"Right." Ramar speaks. He explains the nature of their employer, and the reason why the excavations in the ruins must be called off. He will punctuate his remarks with a thoughtful heft of his blade, as he's not quite willing to lower it, given his position. His voice acquires a flowing quality, mirroring the currents that he feels beneath his feet. The tide of information turns, and he asks them what they might find amenable instead, trying to draw them into the currents of the conversation...

To the Solar's attuned senses, the Terrestrial's wishes are clear enough. She is in this for profit and the advancement of her gens, or particular family line. Whatever yields wealth is acceptable, provided it does not hinder her family's ambitions.

Gradually the conversation drifts. It starts with talk of the sort of profit to be gained from the trip. And the cost of fighting. Damage to the ship, expenditures in Essence and manpower, potential loss of artifacts... to the sort of profit that is out there to be gained. The airship, clearly, is an example of wealth. The crew, the weapons, all of these things are of course profitable. With Ramar directing the flow of conversation, he makes the suggestion that there may be more profit for the Terrestial's gens in joining his cause. Profit to be found in artifacts, knowledge, things beyond mere wealth...

For Davron's part, the Unconquered Sun's light glitters silently off the edges of his armor, and he remains motionless, apart from the shift of his stance as the sea's swells caress the ship's hull. His role is obvious - he is the muscle behind Ramar's honeyed words. His clearly magical equipment is a mute promise of the prizes Ramar promises, but also a threat of what happens if the promises are rejected.

".. convincing the House leadership won't be easy," the captain demurs, frowning. "You best have a plan when we get to that point, pretty boy."

---

Under separate guidance, but similar motive, the two undamaged ships begin tacking toward their sister. Already one mast on it has fallen...

Egress meets the eyes of the sorceress, stepping back and settling her naginata on her shoulders, her pose shifting from one of combat readiness, to utter ease. "You had enough yet?" she asks flatly. "You fight well. You are a credit to your people." Her expression shifts to reveal a very small smile and she adds, waving a hand, "It would be a shame to kill you here, when you have so much yet to learn, since you are worthy of it. Perhaps we might come to an accord now, rather than have you both die in the next minute?" She looks back at the other ships pointedly, where the enemy hasn't even tried their hand at battle.

"We fight for our House's honor and survival," the armored soldier calls out, defiantly. "Your kind stand against everything, but... you are the least demonic of the allies we have seen our rival Houses call upon."

"If you wish your House to prosper," answers Egress, "You must turn it from its current course. The tide darkens, the sea is rising. The powers that linger on the edge of the world, the servants of the underworld, and the Yozis gather their strength. The time of your rulership is near its end, either in honor at the side of the rightful masters of Creation or in disgrace, as the betrayers of hope, whose ambition was greater than the power of their virtue and will."

"You attacked us," the sorceress points out, frowning.

Egress laughs suddenly. "Indeed, I did. There is no way to learn the measure of a person better or faster than to face them, nor any more certain way to show the strength of your will and conviction." She looks skyward, "Battle is the language our kind knows best, and it is what your kind used to wrest Creation from us, spiralling the world from its golden age of madness into a squalor that has eaten away like a cancer. If it shall ever rise to glory again.. No! If it should even survive, we must stand together against the enemies that would consume us all."

"Yet you stop us from gaining the weapons and magic we need against those enemies," the armored knight says, gesturing with his maul at the lovely waters surrounding the ship. "Truk Trin has spoken to the priests of the Immaculate order and has given us all his blessing. Do you act against the will of the gods after all?"

"The gods are divided," answers Egress. "Greed and conflict rules them. I come in the service of Azel, but perhaps we might hammer out an agreement between them before this day ends." She frowns thoughtfully, looking down at the ship, "Perhaps we might offer something to be lost to Azel and take what is required with the blessing of Truk Trin." With an unhappy grunt she mutters, "I will see it done, then. Weapons lost to the sea are worthless in this battle. Tell me, what is it that lies down there? What is it you are seeking that has earned the wrath of Azel?"

"A lost city. Our people - the Realm's citizens - lived there during the Shogunate. The Contagion isolated it and we lost contact for many years. It stockpiled weapons and wonders useful beneath the seas," the man says.

"And great wealth, too," his partner adds, frowning further. "Enough to buy legions, to buy stability."

"Wealth," says Egress, snorting at the word. "Still, the rest might be useful. But it is much to ask of Azel, to take such a treasure, and there must be an offer made in turn to stay her wrath. It is fortunate that we are here. I rather doubt the others who serve are as open to conversation. We will speak with the others and seek a way to deal with this problem." Egress already knows that the Sidereals will be put to extensive use to make this happen as she needs it to.

Egress has heard this tone of voice before. She last heard it when the Captain of Bridal Veil's guards were interviewing one of her Tiger-Warriors for a soldier's position. The man was clearly going to be brought on. Nothing could stop the process. Nevertheless the Captain voiced his fears and concerns, expecting to receive good answers. It was a dance whose conclusion was inevitable, but still it happened.
