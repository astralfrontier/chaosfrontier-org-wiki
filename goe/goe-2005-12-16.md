Back at the still-grounded Ranapura, all the pieces are prepared, all the materials ready - at least for now. Now the time has come to construct the artifacts that will bring this all together. The general outline of the machine is clear to Davron: A central gear will be the focal point for the energy from Essence collectors at the five corners of Creation, each tapping some great natural phenomenon of elemental Essence, and the turning of that immense gear will drive the machinery that will lift the city of Ranapura above the clouds.

Not just the breath of the Five Dragons alone, though, but the very heroism of the Deliberative will raise the city. The Solars of the New Deliberative are already the stuff of legends; people across Creation speak of their deeds. And so the mementos of those formidable deeds will be part of the crafting of the Gear of Ranapura. Solars from each of the five Castes will each contribute some token of their exploits, and these ingredients will go to make up the five jade-edged medallions that will link the energy taps to the Gear.

As for the main body of the Gear itself, it will contain a token of the greatest exploit to date: a page copied from the Book of the Three Circles itself, both the symbol and substance of the New Deliberative, and whose recovery took four intrepid Solars the length and breadth of Creation - and far beyond - and the defeat of one of Creation's deadliest beings to secure.

The page is carefully chosen, as well: it is a page of sutras that describe the nature of things that fly - both a prelude and a primer to the many pages that discuss powered flight on the city scale. Although the materials of the Second Age do not permit the use of many of these principles directly, their inclusion in the Gear will shape Essence toward a specific end: Once Ranapura becomes airborne, it will begin to inspire legends in its own right - and the gear will be able to channel the energy of those very legends into lifting power. The names of Egress, or Ramar, or even Davron, may be forgotten, and their legends become as dust; but as long as men tell tales of Ranapura, the city can hope to rise again.

To build all this before events overtake the Deliberative, though, will require more than just Davron's own hands. A shipment of newly mined orichalcum has come in from the East, and Davron has a use for it. He strides into his workshop in the factory-cathedral, and sends out a mental command to his automata, the small but doughty servants who he'd forged in the bowels of Autochthon, and casts his eyes upon the pile of orichalcum ingots - which is smaller than he'd expected it to be. But before he even has time to wonder at this, the answer becomes apparent.

From all corners of the workshop, golden robot after golden robot emerges, in all manner of bizarre shapes, until they've assembled themselves in gleaming rows upon rows - far more than Davron had expected. With a laugh, he exclaims, "You've been reading the plans, haven't you?" For the diminutive servitors have responded not only to Davron's direct orders, but his intentions as well, and have anticipated the need for more of their number.

Davron grins happily at his now much larger brood. "Now - let's get to work!" he declares, and his army of mechanical minions seem to raise their appendages in a cheer as they follow him out of the room, dividing into five forces - each group to be responsible for the construction of a single Essence collector. Davron himself will attend to the forging of the Gear of Ranapura himself.

For days, Davron and his living-metal assistants toil beneath the mirrors that collect sunlight for the solar forges, melting, pouring, hammering, and carving runes in the orichalcum-alloyed parts of their respective machines. The very air of the machine-refuge glows with Solar Essence; an unwary gnat, meandering from outside the workrooms, flies into the central room and is instantly vaporized with a puff of glowing golden smoke.

Now the heat of orichalcum-smithing is replaced by the struggle with the uncanny hardness of jade. The adapter rings, and the inlays for the Essence taps' channeling runes, must use all five colors of the Magical Material of the Terrestrials, and neither Davron nor his servitors have the natural affinity that they do with the golden metal of their patron. Nevertheless, they labor on; their own orichalcum tools are more than a match for jade's hardness, but they must work carefully, lest an errant chip crack the jade in twain and ruin the part.

Davron has the hardest job of all, for the medallions that will link the Gear to the five collectors are in the shape of gears, and the teeth of the gear as well as the socket into which each medallion will fit must be made of a single piece of jade, then painstakingly split down the middle, with the inner piece joined to the medallion and the outer piece joined to the gear.

Helios reaches the pinnacle of his journey through the heavens before Davron's workshop is disturbed. The door creaks open, letting in a circulation of air, stirring the dust that had started to settle since the craftsman began his work, and now has piled as the sands of hours has drained past. Davron is found at his work table, exhaustion having pooled him atop the wood in a heap of worn bone and muscle. A smile strikes the one who finds him, before the intruder slips out of the workshop as silent as a mouse. Davron's home away from home is not disturbed again until the Unconquered Sun has sunken beneath the lands, and Twilight reins. Chi-Yosh drops a hand to the craftsman's shoulder, shaking it gently. "Awake."

Davron opens his bleary eyes, and grins a manic grin at Chi-Yosh. "It's done... It's all done..." He sits up, and carefully lifts the red-jade sculpture that was on the workbench beneath him, a smaller orichalcum gear nestled firmly inside. It seems to light his face with a ruddy flame, as the substance is wont to do. "At least... it better be," he grumbles, his anima kindling faintly, granting steadiness to his hands as he carries the jade sheathing to the bench which bears the great Gear itself. "Because if this one's out of tolerance _again_..."

Chi-Yosh can all but smile as Davron wafts past him, shuffling to work as though it had never stopped. Even the man's words, offered aloud, seem to be merely an afterthought, or directed more to himself than to the Dawn aside him. With a pleased shake of his head, the Solar steps back, leaning against the wall, and allows Davron to continue his work uninterrupted, the fantastic work of the Twilight merely observed with steadfast curiosity and respect.

A handful of automata follow in Davron's wake as he sets the gear into place... and it sticks. "Son of a mangy yeddim..." he grumbles, raising his hammer - and a small golden spider skitters onto the gear, raising its front limbs in a warding gesture. Behind it, the other automata scurry around the obstinate setting, extruding miniature crowbars and wedges. They have the patience that Davron does not, right now - and better tools for the task at hand.

Davron's tense face breaks into a sheepish grin, and rather than the indiscriminate pounding he had been about to deliver, he listens to the muse roaring through his anima and directs the downward force where it will not shatter the jade. Inch by inch the structure works its way down - until with one last tap of the hammer, almost a caress, it is flush with the surface.

Holding his breath, Davron puts his hand on the outer part of the gear, and begins to harmonize his anima with the artifact, testing its Essence flow. A soft golden glow creeps over the golden metal... pauses for a moment... and then the red jade kindles into life, the iridescent pattern below its surface churning like flame - flame which warms the inner gear into life as well. Davron turns to Chi-Yosh, and whispers with a faint smile, "It worked." And with that, the hammer falls from his fingers and clatters to the floor, and the Copper Spider slumps forward.

There is another act of magic required of the Solars who intend to build their city, and it is prefaced by the arrival of five beings in the Nation of the Sun. Omens and foretellings by the various sage-seers and mortal thaumaturges have predicted turbulent times, and the gods' arrivals give some measure of hope in the otherwise-still-gloomy horoscopes.

From the House of Journeys comes the Divine Magister of the Imperial Road, Miya-Makaru, and her entourage of animatedly hopping shoes. She is a restless spirit, ever in motion, her nature such that she can only take steps forward.

The House of Serenity is represented by a glowing jewel worn around the neck of a god-blooded ambassador. It is the Calmstone, a sapphire of legendary size, and it speaks to those around it in the speech of the mind when it deigns to speak at all - ordinarily it is content to radiate a pleasing, somewhat narcotic light.

The House of Battles honors the gathering with the presence of Torchwood, Inscrutible Fog of the Battlefield, whose breath blows over the cannon and fires lit on battlefields where sieges are conducted.

The House of Secrets has sent a message indicating that a representative god is in attendance, although none have seen him or her as yet. No name or description were provided.

And finally, the House of Endings - foremost in their representation, during this time of transition for the city now called Ranapura - has sent a creature called Mountainclaw, once a draconic elemental of Earth whose singular actions during the earliest Second Age earned him promotion to the ranks of the gods.

These spirits, or at least those who identify themselves, are of course greeted with the utmost honors and housed in the expected manner. They are each here for the ceremony, and they desire to meet the ritual leader as soon as possible.

The Priestess has made Egress aware of the multitude of fine points that she might have missed if left to her own. The details of managing the lofty representatives of the Maidens is hardly a small task, and each must be shone its own honor. These offerings come first, in blood, in tales of far off places, and in offerings of the more common kind as well. The Zenith sees that all the rites are observed. Last of all comes the 'calling' of Katya Ken. Naturally, the best way to call Katya Ken has little to do with calling her and a great deal to do with relying on her tendency to simply show up at the correct time. As is hoped, the City Goddess delivers in the grand style, appearing abruptly midway through an offering to the House of Journeys.

Egress focuses her mind on the preparation of the city, leading the way about it in a steady spiral as she guides Katya Ken and the others to the center of the city. She leaps gracefully in a prayer dance as she scatters in her wake a trail of rose petals and hops for the gods to stride upon. The path she takes winds as it flows steadily farther into the city, leading inevitably towards a lovely temple, a work of many arches and fine spires. The doors remain shut as Egress approaches, and she raises both hands above her head, sending the last of her offerings towards the heavens before turning to embrace Katya Ken. "Great Goddess of Ranapura, I welcome you to your home," she says warmly. She offers both hands to the goddess then, "Let us take these steps together. Our paths are joined now."

If anything, Katya Ken seems momentarily baffled by the ceremony, but in a few steps she can manage it all quite calmly, as if she expected no less. The newly raised City Goddess walks hand in hand with the one who shall serve as her High Priestess. The doors of the temple swing wide silently, opening to greet their rightful mistress. Inside, the work of master architects is clearly evident, and many offerings are already gathered here, waiting for Katya Ken to accept them. There are goods of the finest quality from every corner of the Nation of the Sun, as well as symbols from the nations that Egress so recently swept free of Ragara dominance. A gift from Yurgen is settled here as well--broken and bloody spears from every major force he has overcome in his dominance of the north.

Davron has had time to sleep, and clean up. And dress up. Ornately decorated robes adorn his muscular frame, and in one hand he holds a ceremonial hammer. A three-armed clockwork creature, reminiscent of a small monkey, rests on his shoulder, and several more like creatures cluster around the base of a great gear half again the size of a man, intricately carved with auspicious runes, and with five brightly colored smaller gears set into it at regular intervals around the central axis. Davron gestures grandly to the gear, smiling at Katya Ken and Egress both. He says nothing - his handiwork is his eloquence.

Of course, there is someone far more important than any offerings waiting for the goddess. Standing in front of the temple altar is Burgandy, dressed in the very finest that Egress could acquire for him, his cloak practically shining and his jade armor polished to a brilliant white glow. He walks forward with a sparkle in his eyes, looking very much the picture of a glorious knight. He kneels before Katya Ken, "My Lady, I am at your service," he intones seriously, his voice rich and strong. The goddess for a moment looks on the brink of a fit of giggles, but fortunately some propriety is observed on this occasion. Instead, she settles a hand upon Burgandy's head and says, "I accept you as my knight."

With that, Burgandy leads the goddess up to a cushioned seat, giving to her the place of honor (as is right in her temple) and there she lounges as Burgandy begins to recite a devotional poem. The work was his in origin, but the Zenith has spent many hours at his side giving suggestions as well. In the end, the greatness of that work matters little, for the city goddess has eyes for none but her knight.

Chi-Yosh stands along the side of the procession, beside the Master and the Fisher, the former naturally invited for the ceremony of Ranapura's cristening and raising after the Goddess's anointment. The Solar has no contributal purpose here; all he provided was a source of power for a medallion, as every piece of the Circle had. Yet he is here as member of the Deliberative. As a member of his circle. And as a Solar. Support, after all, is just as necessary in the cycle of success and achievement as the actual fulfillment of goals. He represents the smaller pieces of that which has brought them there today; not the grand achievements of goals, but the small steps and segments that are drops in a bucket, that eventually lead to its overflow.

Miya-Makaru, the Calmstone and its escort, Torchwood, and Mountainclaw all watch as the Priestess approaches them in turn. She issues the ceremonial prayers due to the Houses, doing honor to the celebrants who gather here and asking their blessing. The rite she speaks is performed in Old Realm. It has not been done often, but it is a gesture of respect to the gods to perform it.

Finally, she speaks the rite for the House of Secrets. There is none here to receive it, but there is naught she can do for it. Satisfied, she turns to Katya Ken. Burgundy bows and steps aside as the Sidereal approaches.

"The Captain guides you. The Pillar supports you. The Banner stands with you. The Treasure Trove is unlocked for you. The Haywain accompanies you. Your auspicious destiny is confirmed by Heaven, Katya Ken. You, who are now given the name Protector of Ranapura, Fleeting Angel Who Dances On The Golden Cloud." In that moment, the spirit shines with a light that explodes outward from her body. All but the Solars are dazzled to the point of blindness, and even the Chosen of Helios can but see glimpses. The goddess seems to change and transform. Her youthful features mature before their eyes, growing beautiful and full-formed. An argent halo surrounds her, and the beautiful wings of a sprite blossom from her back. Then the unmistakeable display fades. The prayer has concluded. Katya Ken, the City Mother, closes her eyes and bows in silent homage.

The Zenith knew a thing or two of the ways of the spirits, thanks to her association with Rain of Fire and her experiences and guesses concerning the petty gods. The Priestess filled in many gaps, but there can be no adequate verbal explanation of what it is like to see a goddess change her very nature before you. Egress peers directly into that blinding light, marvelling at the beauty that it reveals. She bows politely to Katya Ken, smiling at the first sight of the Fleeting Angel Who Dances On The Golden Cloud.

Even as the first guests were arriving, an armada of tiny golden machines were still slaving away over the many orichalcum-and-bronze gears, springs, pulleys, and even stranger components that are needed to divert the awesome torque of the Gear to the many engines around the periphery of the city. The casting is long done, thank goodness, but there was still much to do in filing gear teeth to a mirror-finish, carving the last of the control glyphs, and last but not least putting everything into place.

Cartwheel-size, palm-size, and fist-sized gears, circular and elliptical, appear to walk down corridors, carried by one or many automata as needs dictate, and slotted into waiting axles. One spider automaton walks alongside, carrying on its back a mesh bag holding dozens of pebble-sized gears that looks for all the world like its egg sac.

And thus, in the grand tradition of the last minute, the final assembly of the city's lifting engines takes place even while its dedication ceremony proceeds. Davron had asked for two more days to complete testing, but the Priestess had been firm: this was the auspicious day for the ceremony. Even as Davron smiles at Katya's entrance in the grand hall, he is hiding a smidgen of nervousness: all this complexity must work the first time. But he is a Solar Exalt, is he not? The work _will_ be perfect - so he has willed it. Now he just has to _believe_ it!

Now, almost unseen and certainly unregarded in the glory of Katya Ken's transfiguration, a small team of Davron's automata are busily wrestling a final golden gear into place behind Davron. With the click, Davron nods in satisfaction, and breathes a sigh of relief. This is the time.

In the silence as Katya Ken bows her head, Davron pulls an ornate lever beside him to its halfway mark, and the five jade inlays on the Gear glow into life, their Essence channeled from distant lands - and the Gear begins to turn in its shaft, slow, ponderous - but unstoppable. An almost imperceptible throb fills the room; Davron pulls the lever all the way. The Gear begins to retract into the wall, still turning, until it is resting in its great socket at the back of the room.

And finally, Davron releases the lever, letting it move back to its original setting - and the countless gears surrounding the central One ease into position, meshing with it. There is a timeless pause, and Davron holds his breath as the Gear stops for a long moment - and then it begins to turn again, the other gears rotating smoothly on their orichalcum axles. The throb is now palpable...

---

At the site of the ceremony, Katya Ken seems to sense the change before anyone else. She raises one hand - and on one finger, as all can see, is a ring of gold. It begins glowing warmly, and the city trembles. "Rise!" she commands.

Beneath the feet of the celebrants, the ground begins to shake. It tilts, and a moment of uncertainy passes as all consider what could happen if Davron's craftsmanship has erred.

Nevertheless, Davron remembers how he blundered once, reaching for a dream that was at the time almost beyond him. The soul that nearly destroyed him in his quest lives now in his creations, and it is those creations that have helped him.

Now one dream reaps a rich harvest in another. Around them, the observers of the rite - gods, spirits, and Exalted alike - see the sky slowly start to FALL. There is no sense of motion at first. It takes time to realize that the city is moving at all.

At the heart of his work, surrounded by the architectural wonder of the First Age and the heartfelt creations he and his assistants wrought, Davron closes his eyes, reaching out with all his heart. "Fly," he whispers.

The change is abrupt. Katya Ken grins like a madwoman. Everyone else is flattened by the sudden force. The city thrusts itself into the sky as though propelled by the fist of a titanic god. A column of air smashes down, causing hair and clothes to flap madly.

Seconds pass. A sudden white obscures everything, and the gathered Exalted realize that they have entered a layer of low-hanging clouds.

Then it parts. The city of Ranapura, the Golden Cloud, bursts from its white wreath and decelerates. There is a shudder that ripples through the city as it stabilizes. It takes time, but gradually people remember their need to breathe. The air here is cold.

Chi-Yosh staggers. Once he regains his barings, the Su'katan's smile is magnificent. The Circle has went through much, and accomplished great things, but now they indeed have themselves a seat in the heavens among the stars. Breaking from his position, he crosses over to Davron and the great gear, presenting the Copper Spider with a clap on the shoulder in silent congratulations.

Egress rises to her feet slowly, helping those nearby to their as well. Her rides on Rain of Fire as well as fighting at the side of Yurgen's forces has given her some experience with the cold, though she'll have to speak with Katya Ken and Davron to see if something might be done. More than anything, however, the Zenith wishes to satisfy her desire to look down from the city to the land below, a rather catlike curiousity itching in the back of her mind to gaze from this city. Surely she's never been so far above the earth before! She offers Davron an approving smile and a nod. She hopes on day she can express how much pride she feels in her circlemate someday, but that will take time and a great deal of artistic toil.

Davron lets his breath out in a long, deep sigh, and turns to face the far wall, grinning almost as broadly as Katya herself. Now that the Gear is fully in operation, it looks even more spectacular than it did before the ceremony began. The five jade gear-facets glow vividly in their five colors - white, blue, red, green, and black - and a golden nimbus surrounds the great turning disk, passing dust motes gleaming brilliantly as the pass across its face.

The city has stabilized, and now drifts gently in the breeze. Burgundy stands near his charge, admiring the beauty. Katya Ken herself smiles contentedly.
