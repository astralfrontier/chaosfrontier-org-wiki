# Helping Hand
## The Pitch
People from all planets are recruited to be the galaxy's paramedics, for rescue-centered superhero action.

## Background
The Helping Hand is an alien technology created to empower the protectors of life throughout the cosmos, known collectively as "Life Force". The Hand takes the form of a glove, gauntlet, or covering for the hand (for non-humans without manipulating members, it has a different shape). Life Force selects candidates to receive a Hand, then secretly tests them for willpower, strength of character, and commitment to life. Those who pass are given an offer: join Life Force, or return to their normal existence. To its credit, 99% of those candidates selected have accepted the offer.

Life Force battles an interstellar band of mad scientists called Bio-Masters, who perform horrible experiments on living things, turning them into twisted cyborg weapons called Splices. Members of Life Force must protect their planets from Splices, and bring their insane creators to justice.

Each Hand has the same basic power: to strengthen, restore, or alter life energy. However, a Hand responds to the will and wishes of its wearer, and so no two Hand users are alike in their powers. They share one thing in common, at least: the Hand is a tool for creation, not destruction. Although a Hand's powers can be used to indirectly cause harm, or even kill, that is not their intended function. They are tools not of war, but of peace.
