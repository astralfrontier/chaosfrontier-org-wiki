# Splices
Splices are constructed using an alien super-science similar to the Helping Hand itself. Their Bio-Master creators build transforming cyborg weapons, able to blend in, strike, then disappear. The following Splices are built to operate on Earth, and are mostly one-off experimental projects rather than mass-produced weapons.

Most of the Splices have three modes: a mundane disguise (often a vehicle), a humanoid fighting form, and a monstrous animal form. They are constructed by enlarging and modifying a typical Earth animal, then combining it cybernetically with vehicle parts. This process is typical of Splices made for use on other planets in the galaxy.
## Dragonfly
Disguised as an Earth helicopter with four rotor blades, Dragonfly can become an armored giant dragonfly with the blades as wings, or a humanoid monster with four arms, wielding the wing-blades as swords in each hand.
## Scorpion
Scorpion can operate as a main battle tank, or unfold its tracks to become a huge scorpion with its main gun as the tail. In humanoid form, the front pincer claws become armored forearms, and the tail-gun is slung over the shoulder.
