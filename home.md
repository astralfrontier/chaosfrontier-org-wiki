# What is this?
This is the dumping ground for all the creative and gaming stuff I've done for the last twenty years. Old RPG logs, world-building, any other sort of off-the-cuff thing that doesn't have a better home goes here. My main blog is still at [astralfrontier.org](https://astralfrontier.org/) but I'll be loading and cross-linking data into this site as well.

The site is running [wiki.js](https://wiki.js.org/) version 1 in Docker. It's backed by a Github repository so I can do bulk uploads or scripting operations. For example, that's how I got all the [logs](logs) onto the site.
# What's interesting?
* [Fiction](fiction) of all kinds
* [Filk](filk) and other creative poetic or lyrical nonsense
* [Pandora's Lair RPG Logs](logs)
* [Silly ideas](silly) like goofy one-shot games or bizarre mashups
