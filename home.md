# What is this?
This is the dumping ground for all the creative and gaming stuff I've done for the last twenty years. Old RPG logs, world-building, any other sort of off-the-cuff thing that doesn't have a better home goes here. My main blog is still at [astralfrontier.org](https://astralfrontier.org/) but I'll be loading and cross-linking data into this site as well.

# What's interesting?
* [Bookmarks](bookmarks) of random third-party links
* [Games](games) for notes on specific games
* [Pandora's Lair RPG Logs](logs)
* [The Scrapbook](scrapbook) where semi-serious ideas are incubated
