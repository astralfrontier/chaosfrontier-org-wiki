# What is this?
This is the dumping ground for all the creative and gaming stuff I've done for the last twenty years. Old RPG logs, world-building, any other sort of off-the-cuff thing that doesn't have a better home goes here. My main blog is still at [astralfrontier.org](https://astralfrontier.org/) but I'll be loading and cross-linking data into this site as well.

# What's interesting?
* [Advice](advice) on how to play or write, mine or other peoples'
* [Bookmarks](bookmarks) of random third-party links
* [Characters](characters) that I've played or am playing
* [Fiction](fiction) of all kinds
* [Game Fodder](fodder) for any real-world or speculative stuff that can inspire gaming or fiction
* [Games](games) for notes on specific games
* [Pandora's Lair RPG Logs](logs)
* [The Scrapbook](scrapbook) where semi-serious ideas are incubated
* [Silly ideas](silly) like goofy one-shot games or bizarre mashups
