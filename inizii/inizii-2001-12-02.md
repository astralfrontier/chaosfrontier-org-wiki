Kyrel looks relieved as the half-dragon falls, then turns his attention to the prisoners. Derleth and Kaz seem to have dealt with the last pair of lizards, and he sends Kiri to keep an eye on things. The bear is still in the water, apparently not interested in attacking any more, but the half-elf watches it carefully.

Katya shoulders her bow, looking pleased with herself...before glancing over to Sara, looking a little curious, if not concerned. However, the woman makes no comment, nor does she make any move toward the weeping fighter.

Derleth is leaning on a rockwall, taking deep breaths and trying to recover his strength. _Haste potions are efficacious when you're in a pinch, but they always leave you exhausted afterwards._ His armor is stained with blood, some of it his, most of it belonging to the lizards. After a moment, he pulls himself to his feet, looking pained. He managed to heal some of his earlier wounds, but he sustained more in this battle. Some are not too deep, having been cauterized by the half-dragon's heat metal spell, but the burns and gashes are still painful.

Kaz stands vigilantly before the snivelling lizard, bloodstained scimitar in hand, just _daring_ the thing to move. He's speaking to the gnolls, who seem none too happy, snarling, growling, and hissing in the draconic language.

Sara kneels down against the wall of the cavern trying to get ahold of herself, sobbing quietly but now begining to fight it, holding back the tears and attempting to steady her breathing.

Derleth glares at the cowering lizard. His battle anger still burns, but he is not, by nature, a vengeful man. He, in the end, walks behind the lizard and delivers a sharp blow to the back of its head with the haft of his flail, knocking it unconscious.

Kaz gives Derleth a look. "He looked more terrified then threatening, you know."

Derleth shrugs. "An unconscious lizard can't make trouble. Would you rather I killed it?" He doesn't wait for an answer. He walks over to the eggs, digging in his pouch for something. He pulls out one of the stasis beads the wizard gave them. "C'mon, then. Let's be getting what else we come for, so this bloodlettin' not be fer naught."

Kyrel limps over. "He was making a lot of racket, though." He turns to the gnolls, and greets them in common. "Garrok sent us to rescue you." The half-elf shrugs, sheathing his scimitar. Katya follows suit. Many of the gnolls seem to perk up as Kyrel utters Garrok's name, and the ranger translates. After a quick conversation, they seem to settle down, their tails less bottle-brushed and their ears forward instead of flat.

Kaz moves up behind Derleth. "Y'know, there are three eggs here; the giants asked for one or two. What happens to the third?"

Kyrel shrugs. "Take 'em all. It's no extra trouble, and the giants can sort it out later. If they don't want three, we can have omelettes."

Derleth shrugs. "Mebbe the bead will take all three. If it does nae...we smash it."

Kaz snickers. "That's not what I meant; do you think Basel would offer a greater reward, if we give him an egg with his wolves?"

Kyrel says, "If the giants don't want it, we can find out. I'm not going to worry about it at the moment. We can't transport it without the bead, and we can't use only part of one, nor can we release only part of one."

Derleth considers. "Mebbe. T' any rate, stand back, and lets see what the bead'll take."

The ranger clears her throat. "There _are_ more lizards in the nest, you realize, right? What about the children?"

The tears stop running from Sara's eyes as she regains composure and begins looking around to see what the others are up to while trying not to think about the awful creature's bodies that lay strewn about.

Derleth flings the bead at the pile of eggs, almost spitting out the word of power that activates it.

Kyrel sighs. "One good massacre doesn't really deserve another, I suppose. If we pull out leaving a few adults, though, what happens later? The gnolls aren't going to be too happy about things the way they stand."

A flash of light comes from the bead, blazing out in the dim cavern. The air around the nest crackles, small bolts of magical energy bouncing outward, stopping as they hit some round, protective field about it. All of the eggs are struck by these bolts, before a final brighter flash ends the display -- and the three eggs are gone, leaving simply a small marble at the bottom of the nest. The gnolls look startled by the display of power, but are confused by the lack of apparent real effect. Derleth grunts. "Impressive. So now we be having three eggs. The magic works well." He walks over and picks up the bead, pocketing it.

After watching the spectacle, Katya guestures to the unconcious gnoll. "Perhaps we should wake Shimsha and ask her what she thinks?"

Derleth glances at Katya. "Just so we be clear...we did what we ha' t'do here. If more lizards come to attack us as we leave, we will cut them down if necessary...but I d'nae kill anything in cold blood. If the gnolls want the lizards slain to a man, tis their problem."

Kaz circles around the gnolls, whistling lightly. "Ew...Derleth, we may need a lot of healing for these," he announces, cutting their hands free.

Kyrel nods. "I'd have to agree. We've equalized things, from here on it's their problem. Besides, we're running out of spells. I would suggest we get them healthy enough to travel and get out of here."

Derleth considers the wounded gnolls. "It'll have t'go spare...me own self is running low on divine magic...but ah kin do wi'out healing of me own wounds and burn a few enchantments t'help...Katya, tell them what I be doing, so they dinnae try t' hurt me or themsel's."

Sara gets to her feet, wipes the tears from her cheek and clears her throat before she goes to retrieve her spiked chain and place it over her shoulder onto its hooks.

The gnolls, once their hands are free, seem to do the same thing; cradle them gently. The way their fingers move, it's apparent they're broken. Katya nods, and explains, before one of them seems to argue rather firmly, looking down at the unconcious gnoll. She turns back to the others. "He wants you to revive their leader, first."

Derleth glances over in Sara's direction, his expression troubled. He does not go to her, though...figuring to help later, if he can, after the more immediately important things get squared away. The cleric nods at Katya's request. "Fair enou'," he grunts. He walks over to the fallen gnoll, and kneels by her side. He places a hand on the gnoll's neck, chanting sutras as he works to revive the fallen leader...calling on a minor orison to bring the female around to consciousness. After a few minutes of healing work the gnoll stirs and groans, lifting a battered hand to rub her eyes. As one opens, she starts slightly, pushing back from Derleth. "Humans?" The word is said in fluent common, and she glances about worriedly for a moment...before seeing the dead and unconcious lizards. Then spotting Katya, she visibly relaxes. "So, you've come to our aid?"

Kyrel says, "That we have, Shimsha. We met Garrok and a few survivors of your tribe and he told us where you were."

With some work, she stands, and surveys the damage, nodding to herself. "I see. Good, he lives. I feared the worst for my mate." Glancing back to the half-elf. "What of the children?"

Kyrel looks at Katya. "There were two children and the chief's mate with him. I assumed they were her children, but..."

Katya shakes her head. "I think she means the captured children; there were eleven taken, by Garrok's count."

Derleth seems satisfied, and then goes to the other gnolls, whose wounds are not so easily treated. Chanting to Lliara, he lays hands on them,glowing with healing magics...

Kyrel says, "Then we need to find them, as quickly as may be." He turns his attention back to the gnoll. "Do you know where they are held?"

She shakes her head. "They were screaming earlier, from that direction," She points to the tunnel that led the way the group had came. Glancing amid them, "I believe I and my tribe can take care of them..." Flexing her fingers, which miraculously wern't broken, "Our magics can bring the stragglers down. They'll be more willing to give up, now that their leader is dead." She jerks her chin toward the half-dragon's corpse. The gnolls recover quickly once freed, and the seven survivors are in better condition then they were before Derleth set the healing hands upon them.

Kyrel says, "Good... we're about tapped out. Let's move, then."

Derleth moves sluggishly, using so much healing magic in a row draining more of his strength...but then his eyes notice the glitter of gold and his face lights up, as he moves in the direction of the alcove.

Shimsha looks curiously at Kyrel. "Move? Do not concern yourselves; you look like rest is in need. My people will take care of this." There is a pause, and she clears her throat. "As a show of...gratitude," taking a moment to choose the proper term, "I ask that you stay with my people, for a day or so, to rest, heal, eat well and let tales be told, hm? It is the least I can offer you."

Kyrel bows briefly. "We would be both pleased and honored. You are sure you can handle things on your own?"

She nods. "They will surrender, or the fight will be out of them. The inital battle scored losses in their ranks, as much as ours; there should be few left." She turns to the six other gnolls, and begins to give orders, gesturing to the corpse, and, having noticed the bear, instructions on dealing with it, as well. The others nod, and move about quickly to their tasks. Three, taking spears that were propped against the alcove opening, move carefully toward the polar bear, while another takes the downed lizard's sword and walks confidently to the half-dragon's corpse. Shimsha turns once more to the party. "Anything that we do not find useful in this hole, is yours." Her eyes shift to the gold, and she gestures Derleth toward it.

The cleric, getting down to counting the gold, finds a considerable pile. At least seven hundred, is his first guess. Several smaller gems, mostly sapphires but with a single diamond, are in the pile. One sapphire is quite large, and a scroll is half-buried under the pile. Derleth sighs in utter bliss, picking up the gems and gold in his hands and just letting it fall out. like he was washing his hands with it. "This makes it all worthwhile..." he cooes, his wounds and cares forgotten.

Kyrel snorts. "There isn't _that_ much of it." He reaches past the cleric to pluck the scroll out of the pile. "What do we have here...?"

Shimsha starts out, before pausing in front of Kyrel. Her ears flicker, a moment, tail lowering in respect. "If you are willing, there will be much in honoring, if you do stay."

Kyrel looks up at the gnoll chieftess after flickering a glance at Katya. "If you so wish, we would be honored to accept."

Derleth lets Kyrel take the scroll, tucking away the gold and gems in various places on his person. One wonders how he manages to carry it all...

From in the cave, the gnolls begin to whoop and howl, as the bear is brought down. Shimsha gives a nod, before moving into the cave. Chiding one of the gnolls for starting to dissect and skin the corpse before the lizards are dealt with, she gathers them up and as one, they start toward the exit.

Kyrel watches them go, and then turns his attention to the scroll. He puzzles over it for a minute before frowning in annoyance and rolling it back up. "Hmmph. Some kind of conjuration spell. I can't quite make it out, but it's something to do with ice. What do you make of it, Vane?" The other mage looks at it and nods. "Ice knife."

Katya moves over to the wizard, tipping her head. "I have a feeling they may be offering a ceremony, of sorts, if you are going to stay."

Derleth hmmmms. "Kyrel, ah think in me current state, ah'm not up to carrying all this. Would ye mind taking half the gold and this lovely rock in that magicked pouch o' yours?"

Kaz moves to inspect the haul, grinning faintly. "Don't expect to be keeping all of that to yourself, you know. I need a little...'nest egg', myself."

Derleth grunts, glaring at the rogue. "We not be splitting up the booty now, Kaz. Just trying to haul it away. Keep yer sticky hands away from me....I mean _the_ gold."

Kyrel says, "You'll get your share, Kaz, don't worry. We don't have the time to piece it out at the moment..." He does let the thief store a few handfuls of the gold to placate him, but puts most of it in his own bag. "And that goes for you, too, Derleth." To be contrary, the thief reaches out with a foot, to tap the gold.

Derleth grins boyishly, some of his demeanor returned. "Ye do me wrong, Kyrel. I plan no sleight of hand with the loot..." but then he looks suspiciously at the bottom of Kaz's boot, to make sure there's no adhesive on it, stealing away coins.

Kaz is quite placated, dropping the gold into his backpack. He snorts at the suspicious cleric, and shows no gold has seen fit to cling to his shoe.

Kyrel chuckles and shakes his head. "An' sure an' that's why you were after saying 'me gold' instead of 'our gold'?"

Derleth says, "Sure, lad, an I was just referring to me own share of the treasure..."

Kyrel grins. "Let's hope so." He walks back out to the large cavern room, listening through Kiri to the progress of the gnoll's vengeance.

An hour or so later, the gnolls return, victorius. Few lizards were taken prisoner, mainly a few of the non-combatants who were concerned more with life than hatred. Most of the gnoll's children were rescued, but one or two had suffered from the lizards' appetites. Shimsha then announces that the tribe will be moving into the now vacant lair, finding it much more spacious than their old home.

Kyrel nods. "Garrok is in a small cave about a half mile away. Shall we go give him the good news?"

Shimsha gives a nod. "Indeed. And, we will be sending the children to recover our belongings from our old home. There is much preparation to be done."

Kyrel nods. "I fear much was damaged, though whatever was stolen is here for you now. The young ones will be safe on their own?"

With a nod, the chieftain points to the half-dragon's corpse, once more, giving an order to a gnoll. Looking back, "Garrok will scout, to insure the path is clear, before leading the young there. He's much better a warrior then any of us."

Katya raises a hand. "I will go and fetch him then, and the horses, as well?"

Kyrel nods in agreement. "Skilled and brave." He nods to Katya. "A very good idea. Shall I come along with you?"

Derleth glances at the Ranger. "Are ye well enou' to do so? ye took some brutal hits, lady."

As to the chieftain's instruction, one of the gnolls begins to skin, declaw, and even begin to remove the half-dragon's teeth and horn. Katya pauses, giving a nod. "Point taken... Hm... perhaps it would be best, then? I can move well enough, but another would be good for the trip."

Derleth says, "Ah left one spell in reserve, Lady Wyvernjack...my goddesses favor to make one's self invisible...but I'd use it t'power a last healing prayer iff'n ye need it...."

Kyrel says, "Just in case there are any straggler sentries out there, waiting for revenge of their own. Let's go." He looks around for his familiar, who is currently swooping back and forth over the water, getting a drink. "Kiri! Point, Kiri."

The ranger waves the offer away. "No thank you, good cleric; I'm well enough. And, I have your mage friend here to offer assistance, if need be."

Derleth nods. "As ye like. We'll be waiting fer your return."

Katya nods, and starts toward the exit, looking back in waiting for Kyrel.

Kyrel follows the ranger, the bat swooping into the corridor ahead of them both.

---

Two days have passed; the gnolls' new home has been a busy place. The gnoll children have returned with the tribe's gear from their old cave, the prisoners are held under close guard, and while the gnolls seem friendly, most of them just...haven't been seen, hiding away in one of the caves' chambers, shy around the humans and elves. Food has been plentiful - the bear dressed out to a considerable amount of meat. Rest, feasting, healing, and practice has been the order of the day. The gnoll's hinted ceremony is scheduled for this day.

Kyrel has taken the opportunity to rest and heal, and of course to replenish his spells. When Shimsha has had free time, he has asked about the drake who laid the eggs here, trying to find out what he can about her.

Derleth is in the middle of his holy rites to Lliara at that moment...which is to say, he's counting the booty again, even shining the coins as he murmurs sutras to his goddess, thanking her for the growing power she gives him to do good in her name....

Shimsha has been seen little, and when asked did not have much information on the dragoness. She was apparently one of the powerful ice dragon's mates, and had left her lair behind to allow the hatchlings to fend for themselves, and claim the small hoard as their own.

Vane keeps to himself for the most part, favoring his side as he moves about the complex. Despite the healing, he claims that pain from the wound that nearly broke him back in the cavern entrance hasn't yet faded. He keeps to the rear of the complex, studying a set of folded and tattered papers that he produces from the back of his spellbook. He scratches away in the back, murmuring softly to Kai, carrying on some arcane debate with the ferret.

Kaz has been seeming somewhat caged, pacing back and forth, idly practicing with a spare lock that just happened to be in his pack. After a bit, Katya comes, clearing her throat. "I believe they're ready to address you all. The ceremony is ready, but I wasn't given much information regarding it. However, I do know this is about an honoring of respect, gratitude, and an offering... They're likely going to ask some odd requests, but I don't know how they would take a refusal."

Vane sighs quietly. Kai actually makes a noise that sounds like a groan. Derleth actually stops chanting, arching an eyebrow. "And what d'ye mean by _odd requests_, exactly?

Kyrel nods. "Some kind of tribal ritual? I think we can handle a few bits and pieces of weird stuff to keep the peace. They've been very interesting to get to know, these past few days."

The ranger spreads her hands, palms up in a shrug. "I'm not sure... their customs are odd. I've not witnessed this paticular ritual... I do know, that oddly enough, Vane is the one who'll receive the most in gifts."

Derleth chuckles wryly. "Perhaps nae so strange. He cast many a mighty spell striking down th' lizards n' their allies."

Vane raises his head from his spellbook. "Excuse me?"

Kyrel looks at his half-brother. "Seems they were impressed by you taking out that whole roomful with one spell. Be nice to them."

Katya nods her head. "That, and likely his...vigilance, against the half-dragon. Most of the ones who were conscious witnessed the battle, and I recounted what went on before we found the leader."

Vane closes his spellbook with a snap. It vanishes. He shakes his head. "Vigilance. I cast a few spells. I was broken in half. Give their honor to Sara. I don't have need of it."

Derleth sighs. "Nae, nae, Vane...we dinnae want to offend our guests."

Kyrel raises any eyebrow at Vane. "They were impressed by you, brother mine. A bit of modesty is becoming, but don't rock the boat. If they wish to honor you, humor them."

Katya nods to both the cleric and Kyrel. "Well, they are waiting..."

Vane folds his arms across his knees. "If they insist on giving honor where it isn't deserved.... " He trails off. "Fine. I won't try to stop them."

Kyrel says, "Good. Don't want to offend their sensibilities. And remember that Shimsha speaks common quite well. Be polite."

Derleth gets up. He has actually chosen not to wear his armor the past few days after he took the time to clean it and mend some of the broken straps, and is instead wearing formal robes of silver and gold.

Vane stands and brushes off his overcoat. He snaps something rapid and violent to his brother in an ugly, guttural tongue -- and walks out into the corridor.

Katya nods to Kyrel, "Indeed, but she'll likely be speaking most of it to her people, out of tradition's sakes. I'll translate, if need be..." She trails off as Vane walks out. "Well..."

Derleth glances at Kyrel. "Is't just me, or has he grown more foul tempered than usual-like?"

Katya gives a gesture, motioning out into the passage.

Derleth calls after Vane. "Ye misspronounced 'kajysticrn', Vane!" he says helpfully.

Vane's voice rounds the corner. "Wrong dialect, fool, I don't speak Vhaeraunite." His footsteps echo down the corridor.

Kyrel suppresses a chuckle and follows Vane out. He's dressed in clean clothes for the occasion, though nothing nearly as fancy as Derleth's formal robes.

Derleth chuckles openly at Vane's retort.

Kaz, opting for clean, yet still road-worthy clothes, follows suit. Katya leads the group out, down one of the forks, and into a small chamber. The gnolls all kneel in a circle, in the center a framework of bones, draped with strips of fur and wood. Within the pile can be seen the many tails and trophies the half-dragon had worn, as well as the remnants of his club, broken down into several smaller pieces. One gnoll is off to the side of the circle, sitting on the floor before a set of crude drum; a simple bucket turned over, and sturdy bones as drumsticks. The circle parts enough to allow the group to come into its center.

Derleth glances around with interest...

The group enters the circle and sits at Shimsha's signal, while the gnolls close the circle behind them.

The circle parts on the other side, allowing Shimsha to enter as well. Her clothing is much finer than the other gnolls' simple furs. Robes the color of darkness cloak the chieftain. The waist is gathered by a rope belt, and tied to it is a small sack. In one hand she holds a staff and pouch, in the the other a bucket of snow. The bucket and the pouch are placed down beside the framework of bones. A soft, keening comes from her, before she strikes the bottom of her staff upon the stone floor. The drum beat begins, steady and smooth, while as one, the gnolls in the circle begin to howl. One might describe it as haunting; a synchronized chorus, staying in unison as the note rises and falls; their own form of chanting.

Shimsha begins to chant in the gnollish tongue, her hands moving faintly, as she walks about the framework of bones. Its base begins to smolder and, as she passes, sparks begin to rise from the arcane gestures. The words are a mix of spell and ritual, igniting the fire, and letting it rise, rise to a bright, burning flame, fueled by the grim kindling. The chieftain stops her casting, but still walks around the fire, slowly, beginning to speak in the tongue of her people. Katya, murmuring quietly from behind the five, translates. "Strength, be it in body, mind, or magic, be honored today. Our enemies lie dead, for we are the victors, yet a strong foe they were, and honor will be given. Their leader, who led with power, is gone, yet that shall be passed on, to give the victors more."

The chieftain sets her staff down, and kneels before the bucket, to burrow through the snow, before removing a dark, indigo colored organ. As she begins to speak, Katya continues her running translation. "The heart, the chamber of body and soul, be soaked in the richness of strength." Holding the heart in one hand, the gnoll takes up the smaller pouch, opening it deftly. "The bone, tool of muscle, deliverer of power." She rises, and moves beside the fire. The chieftain's eyes settle upon Vane, as her hands draw close to the fire, speaking to him in the gnoll tongue. The ranger taps Vane on the back, "Come forward, breathe in the strength of thine enemy, the victor become blessed."

Vane stands up slowly and walks toward the gnoll shaman. He pauses a few feet from the fire, watching it impassively.

Shimsha nods to Vane, and tosses the heart into the center of the fire. From its depths, a hissing sound rolls off, before the fire emits a more acrid, stronger smoke. Reaching into the pouch, the gnoll removes powder, and even in her hand, bits of not-so-powdered bone can be seen, before she throws it into the fire. Then, leaning forward, the gnoll breathes in the smoke. After leaning back from a quick inhaling, she gestures to Vane, offering the vapors to him.

Vane tips his head forward into the smoke for a few long moments. His eyes shut tightly, he forces himself not to choke.

The chieftain looks pleased, nodding once to Vane, her tail down in respect. The gnolls continue their howling chorus, though it is quieter now. Hands move, and, the gutteral language once more spilling forth, she beckons to the four. "Come forward, and share the power of your foe."

Derleth hestitates for a heartbeat, and then rises to join Vane by the fire, trying not to shiver from the ominous howling...

Kaz, looking a little green at the concept, nonetheless stands, and saunters to the fire. He does a good acting job, barely taking a whif of the stinking smoke.

Kyrel stands, Kiri perched on his shoulder, and moves forward. He takes his own breath of the acrid smoke when it is his turn, the burned-meat and scorched-bone odors strong but somehow refreshing. _And why not? Their magic works as well as ours, after all._

Derleth leans forward and inhales...his face turns slightly green but he manages...

The gnoll nods, and makes a motion with her hands, to step back from the fire. Vane takes a broad step back, and shakes his head faintly, trying to clear his head. Kai makes a muffled coughing sound. All six step back, but remain standing, waiting for the next cue from the gnoll shamaness.

With the fire going, Shimsha walks around, taking up her staff and banging its end against the stone floor twice. On cue, the howling slowly dies down to silence, and the drum beat slows, thumping every few seconds. She continues to talk, but then switches into the common tongue after she's finished, stopping before the elf. "Vane," She speaks evenly, taking and opening the sack at her waist. "You shall have the mightiest trophy, a bounty strengthened by magics." From the bag, she removes an amulet fashioned from a claw, wrapped in scales, and thonged by a string of azure leather. She offers it to the wizard. "It shall strengthen one's skin, offering protection."

Vane nods once, still impassive. He waits for the shaman to move first. She waits for a moment, then rests her staff against her shoulder, and taking the ends of the throng, lifts it up, and places it over the elf's head.

Vane bows his head for the shaman; Kai skitters out of the way. The wizard's hair falls down over the sides of his face.

Shimsha places the necklace on him, nodding once in respect before moving on. She begins to speak in gnoll, then stops before Sara. "You removed the beast from the air, and thus, shall have the prize of its grounded wings." A belt of bluish leather is removed from the sack, and offered. "No enchantment it bears, but it is strong, sturdy."

Again, she moves, stepping before Derleth. The gnoll speaks in her native language, before reaching into the bag, and drawing forth the half-dragon's horn, its tip having been sharpened dangerously. At the base, a hilt of bone extends, wrapped in whitish leather, appearing softer. "May the headpiece of your enemy bring the destruction of others," the chieftain translates.

Derleth accepts it wordlessly into his hands, studying the polished blade, and then murmuring his thanks.

Stopping before Kaz, the gnoll offers a necklace of smaller teeth and claws, obviously from the regular lizardfolk. "May a warrior wear the reminders of his victories." The rogue nods, taking the necklace silently, and slipping it on, for simple courtesy if nothing else.

Finally, she reaches Kyrel, and takes from her bag a bracelet of ivory scales, from which teeth and two claws dangle. Once again she addresses her kind, before offering in common, "Keep the trophies of the strong as a tribute to your ability."

Kyrel nods, taking the bracelet and fastening it about his wrist. "You honor us."

The chieftain moves back to stand before the group, as the fire's flames begin to dim. She translates evenly into common, "The thanks, and gratitude to you all go forth, from my tribe. If assistance is needed, come to us. Please, be careful upon the open snow, we bid you a good journey."

Vane bows politely. "You do us honor. Peace to you and yours."

Kyrel nods briefly, letting Vane speak for the group for now.

The chieftain returns the bow. "We give honor where it is rightfully earned."

Vane says, "I hope you won't need the aid of outsiders again. We won't intrude on you further, chieftain... Good luck and good hunting to you."

She nods. "Do not worry. The lizardfolk prisoners will be _escorted_ out of our territory. There are few adults left to wage any sort of attack on us, and they will be headed in the opposite direction from their allies."

Vane nods. "Look to your borders, then. I trust you'll have no problem in the future."

Kyrel nods. "A good idea. Letting them join forces would not be ... productive."

Katya offers from behind, "If we may depart, the horses are prepared."

Vane says, "With your permission, Chieftain."

She makes a slow, wide wave of the hand. "Do not let me keep you. I will see you again, Katya, in a month's time, to offer report." The end of her staff once more cracks upon the stone floor, signaling the gnolls to break the ring, offering a path for the group.

Kyrel leaves the circle, bowing to Shimsha again as the group breaks up. "May your enemies fall before you, Chieftess. We wish you well."

Derleth simply nods, departing with the others.

Vane nods again, "Good luck to you," then turns, letting the gnolls spread out in his wake. As he reenters the corridor, he brushes back his long hair, and settles his hat back on.

---

The trip back to the Frozen Axe caves was an uneventful, if not quiet one. On the way back from the caves, the body of the Remorhaz was spotted... or what was left of it. It apparently had served as a buffet for many arctic creatures, with half of it missing, and the rest mauled. Once more Katya alerts the giants of the group's approach, before the familiar, blue skinned behemoth comes out to gather the horses, and Kholodnaya pauses in the entrance to the cave.

Kyrel waves to the giant. "Hola! Success!"

The big woman chuckles, the sound carring even to the groups' position. "Well then, come inside!" she calls, before disappearing into the cave. Katya swings down from her mount, handing the reins to the giant, Kaz following suit. Derleth pats Platinum, gives him an apple, and then swings off the saddle to march in with his comrades... Kyrel dismounts, patting Maya's neck before handing over the reins to the giant. "Let's go, folks. Don't want to keep the nice lady waiting." Vane follows his brother, adjusting his dark glasses.

Derleth laughs! "Ah dinnae know how she'd take t' being called 'a nice lady', Kyrel..."

Vane says, "You're entirely too chipper today, little brother. How much of that smoke did you inhale?"

Kyrel chuckles. "Well, it's safer than saying something insulting, after all."

Sara wanders in after Derleth, shrugging off the cold and snow that she's almost gotten used to by now.

Kyrel turns to Vane. "Not all that much. I'm just glad we're about done with this little trip. At least the nasty parts."

Derleth says, "Per'aps. Still, it sounds rather...what's th' word...patronizing, almost...tis the kinda think you say to kids, don't ye know? 'Go with the nice lady, now!'"

Katya gives a look behind her, as if to say 'come in', before moving inside the cave.

Vane nods. "I'll not be sorry to leave this waste behind."

Kyrel just grins at Derleth. "If the shoe fits, after all..." Derleth sighs dramatically. "So ye've said, fire-slinger. Frequently."

The giantess is seated on her chair, obviously looking pleased. "I would like to see the eggs, if you could?" Her gaze shifts over to a giant standing in a passage doorway, calling to him in their language. He looks displeased, his words sounding paticularly unfriendly, before he disappears down a tunnel. Turning back, visibly trying to smile, "Now, the eggs..."

Derleth looks between the Jarl and the disappearing giant as he takes the bead out from his pouch. "Is something amiss, Lady Jarl?"

With a sigh, and a bit of annoyance in her voice, "Some of our clan believe we should not be associating with humans."

Kyrel chuckles. "They're not going to go away, after all."

Derleth chuckles. "Tis always the way. Ah'm sure there are those who would think us loony for associating with giants. But...the eggs." He steps forward, places the bead on the ground, and, after stepping a good distance back, speaks the command word.

Vane says, "Human encroachment, Jarl... is something all the elder races are facing in these times... obviously, as our small group would illustrate."

Once more the crackling energy erupts, almost a large magic field extending from the bead, before magical lightning plays upon the floor. The eggs reform as the bead disintegrates. The Jarl looks pleased, though somewhat puzzled. "Three, I see... Hm... Well, I do not wish to have that many wyrms in my home. Two, at the most."

Derleth shrugs. "Sure, an we figured t'take them all, just in case. We can sell the egg elsewhere. Or, possibly, Kyrel fancies making a really large omlette...."

Kyrel nods. "We weren't sure if you would want them all or not. We will try to put them in stasis with the wolves when we leave... if it doesn't work, you can deal with them as you wish."

She nods. "Of course. Such is, in fact, a delicacy." Behind her, the giant exits the passage, each large hand gripping a silver and white furred wolf, a good six feet from tail to hip, by the scruff. One of them is speaking quite well in the giant tongue, though it is a bit accented by the shape of her muzzle. And, by the way the wolf and giant are speaking, neither are too pleased to be in the other's company.

Kaz rubs his hands. "All right. Bag the wolves, and we'll be on our way..."

Derleth says, "Aye. Take two of th' eggs and put the wolves next t' the third."

The giant complies, shooting the group a dirty look, as he none-too-lightly sets the wolves down. The arguing one snarls, buffing a foggy breath up. The giant ignores, simply taking an egg in each arm, and turning, walks off. Kholodnaya gestures. "Is this satisfactory?"

Vane says, "More than satisfactory, Jarl."

Derleth glances between the wolves at the Jarl. "D' the wolves understand common?"

Kholodnaya says something to the wolves, pointing to the group. Her tone is gentle, at least compared to the other giant, and it does seem to calm the agitated one's nerves. The other just eyes the group, before simply settling onto the ground. She points to the one resting on its paws. "He does."

Derleth nods. "All right then." He faces the indicated wolf, trying not to feel foolish. "We're going to be using a magic on ye that will place ye inside _this_." He indicates the second bead. However, the bead will keep ye in stasis, so likely, ye'll not notice time pass. Ye unnerstand?"

The wolf gives the cleric a look. "As well as one would expect," He replies, though his common isn't very smooth, sounding as rough as Garrok's was, due to that elongated mouth.

Derleth grins. "Just dinnae want ye t' be startled, when in one moment ye're in the Jarl's cave, and then, after a flash of light, ye suddenly find yerself somewhere's else. Ye and yer mate ready?"

Kyrel nods. "We're going to be taking you to meet a wizard. Whether you decide to go with him or not is up to you. The stasis bead will make the journey easier."

Vane says, "The decision is ultimately yours; our obligation is only to bring you to him."

He gives as good as a nod as one could recieve from a talking wolf. "We've been informed." His head turns, addressing the female. She doesn't sound as easy going as him, but, with a snort, she settles down onto the cave floor beside the egg. The male looks back. "Whenever you intend to, human."

Derleth nods. "All rightee then." He throws the bead, uttering the arcane trigger....

And, once more, the stasis magic does its job, the female startled into moving away from the bolts of light, but still, they strike. Even though the wolve's bodies are partly outside of the radius, they are also partially within, and their forms become light before the magics begin to die down - and then all that is left is the bead.

Derleth picks up the bead. "Now ye see them, now ye don't." he quips.

Vane mms quietly. "Quite an indignity to inflict on a creature so powerful. Let's not keep them that way for longer than necessary. I suggest we be on our way, now that our business is concluded."

Kholodnaya nods her head. "A much easier mode of transportation on your part, I'm sure," she agrees, before nodding to Vane. "Thank you. And I'm sure if they could at the moment, the wolves would offer their thanks, as well."

Vane nods to the Jarl. "Think nothing of it, Lady. Consider it professional courtesy."

Kyrel isn't quite as sure of that as Kholodnaya seems to be, but he doesn't press the issue. "Katya, will you be coming back with us? I assume you're going to spend some time giving Kholodnaya all the news."

She pauses, for a moment. "Are you able to make it back, without me? You'll be making camp, soon enough; I'll catch up before the night is through."

Derleth nods to Katya. "Actually, now that the hard part were over, ah would like t' finally explore that cave...per'aps ask the dead dwarf some questions..."

She nods, "Making camp in the same place?"

Vane says, "If you believe that it's still there, you're a bigger fool than you look."

Derleth blinks, creasing his eyebrows at Vane's comment. "I beg yer pardon?"

Kyrel says, "Should be a good place to camp again. We'll see you there, then. "

Vane says, "We'll discuss it later."

Derleth looks oddly at Vane. "Aye...." he returns.
