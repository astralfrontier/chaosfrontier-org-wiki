Logfile from PLKyrel

The four enter into the Halfway Inn. It's pretty quiet, and almost deserted, at this point and time. Seeing as the weeknight. Though, a few people are at work; one halfling who's at the moment cleaning looks up. "Oh! Ah, er... Welcome!"

Derleth chuckles. "What, you're not used to us coming in at all hours?" he comments to the halfling.

A little grin. "Not prepared. But, a night's work deserves a good meal! you... want a meal right?"

Nimera pipes in, "Famished."

Kyrel grins. "Put hers on our bill. And I'd like an ale and some chicken if there's any available. If not, stew will be fine."

Rosalie grins wolfishly. "Yes! And some cheese, too. And some good wine. I'm in the mood to celebrate ..."

Nimera adds, "Whatever platter you have." The halfling bobs his head. "Better go poke the cook!" He sets his broom aside, and scurries off behind teh bar. Tender, though, having overheard the drinks, makes with pouring them.

Zoa flies from Nimera's shoulder, to perch on the back of a chair about a large table. She bobs her head. "Gogogogo?"

Derleth grins. "Service here is the best in the city..." He get's ponderous then, and considers arranging to greet Silniya's return with something appropriate...he's sure the halflings can help with procurement...

Rosalie collapses into a chair, slouching happily, one hand lying loosely on the table. Her head is tilted sideways. "I think, sirs, that that was a great success, don't you?"

Kyrel nods. "Most certainly. And I'm sure Lady Nimera would agree that it was well-timed, eh?"

"It was well appreciated, at least," She agrees, and settles into the chair Zoa perches. Drinks are brought to the table post haste. "Now, I wonder what's in store in the locked box? I'm aware of what some of Malvolio's traveling gear do, but not all of it."

Derleth sighs regretfully. "I still think we should have emptied his chamberpot into his bed...it would have been apropros..."

Kyrel grins. "It was empty, and we didn't have time to fill it."

Kyrel glances to make sure the staff and any other patrons are well out of earshot, then leans forward and murmurs to Nimera, "And it's insurance for us, as well. Even if he somehow finds out who's responsible, we've got him over a barrel. Kidnapping you like that has to be some kind of illegal here."

Derleth absently remembers he's still wearing his guise..."Hmm...better take this opportunity to remove my ears..." He excuses himself and goes up to his room.

A bob of her head. "Most certainly. Trust me, I'll make sure it's well known the activities of the brothel-beget rat." Offering a smile unto Kyrel, "But, I'll cover your backsides, in this. Don't worry." A wink.

Rosalie smiles sideways. "After all, we don't want everyone to know who freed you, ma'am. We have ... reputations to maintain."

Kyrel says, "And while freeing you would fit that reputation, breaking and entering would not. We'll just stay in the background on this one."

"Not a problem," She comments, wagging a finger, the nail sparkling just a touch. "If that piece of... whatever Malvolio had isn't of interest, could you turn that in to the AOEER?

Rosalie looks curious. "Does the AOEER have an exchange program?"

Zoa hops up onto Nimera's shoulder, nibbling idly on her hair. She tickles the bird's chest. "As in, accepting members from some far off country, and sending some of ours elsewhere?" Of course, the tone, if not the tilt of her brow suggests a knowledge of what Rose means.

Rosalie smiles ruefully. "That's not ... quite what I had in mind. But do tell, how do ladies and gentlemen join your worthy society? And what, exactly, were the aims again?"

She grins a touch. "To answer the question, it depends on what it's worth, I would guess. If it's just a chip off some ancient god's chariot or somesuch, then it may not be all that useful, but certainly presentationally important." Mm, "As for joining, there is an office, in the city. As for what we represent? Why, exploring, digging up relics, and sending them back for study. Ancient civilizations, arcane relics, lost this or that."

"Digging bones and playing with them," Zoa announces.

Kyrel says, "Arcane relics sounds interesting... I've been trying to talk Derleth into wandering off to check out some of the Portals."

Rosalie raises one eyebrow, then turns to look at Kyrel. "Sounds ... interesting. Do you have plans for the near future?"

Eyebrows raise. "Portals?" She asks in interest. "I know a collea who grew interested in those. Fascinating things."

The drinks arrive, promptly.

Kyrel says, "I think so, too. Do you have any idea where your colleague is right now?"

"The last time I heard, he was sniffing around Cormyr."

Derleth shows up just then, his face glistening with moisture. "Who's sniffing around Cormyr?"

Rosalie languidly waves at Derleth. "Pull up a seat; the dirnks are as good as they always are."

Nimera's hand plays idly on the rim of her cup. The slight bubbles in her glass follow the motions, twirling after that aimless digit above them. "What are your plans for the future, at that?"

Kyrel waves a hand toward Nimera. "Someone she knows. Might be interesting to talk to him."

Derleth takes a mug of mead. "Don't mind if I do." He glances at Nimera. "Well, we still have a dilvery to make to the elves...after that, we're pretty much wide open..."

"You're couriers for the elves?" The wizardess asks curiously. "Elven Express," Zoa chirps.

Derleth smiles wryly. "not....exactly. We're returning something taht belongs to them..." he says evasively.

Rosalie looks slightly more alert at the mention of the delivery. "As to that, Kyrela, Derleth, would you like some company? I'm currently at loose ends ..."

Kyrel nods. "Certainly. It's nice to have extra hands and eyes on these little side trips. Nimera? You're welcome too, if you don't have anything more pressing."

The halflings return with the food, shortly. Plate, plate, plate. "Rasins," Zoa peeps. One of the halflings stare at the colorfull chatterbox. "Uh..." "Gogogo," She whispers. This sends him off.

Derleth chuckles. "I'm sure Sil would add her voice as well...you certainly offer unique skills, Rose...along with facinating circumstance."

Nimera smiles towards Kyrel. "I'd love to. But, I have a little pressing business here. Mainly, seeing if all of my estate is in order, make sure Malvolio gets the perverbial kneeing, socially, and the like." A tip of her head. "However, when I get myself situated, how about I send you a Sending?"

Rosalie leans back, her posture more relaxed. "Why, thank you both; or all three, rather? It surely is a pleasure working with you."

Nimera turns to Zoa, and tickles her feet. "You seriously need to learn some new phrases. I should've picked a better comment, that time."

Kyrel says, "Certainly, if you want. You can at least see what we're up to by then..."

Nimera nods back to Kyrel, her eyes bright. And different shades then earlier. "Most certainly I'll drop you a line. If nothing else, teleport by for a good brushing up." She offers an address. "If nothing else, those are my apartments, if still mine. While in town, send a missive?"

Derleth leans close then, while Nimera's talking with Kyrel. "I'd also be appreciative for further aid in, ah...romancing Sil properly. I'm not exactly experienced, and a woman's insight would be welcome..." he whispers to Rose.

Kyrel says, "We'll be here for a couple of days, yet. See what's happened to your home... and join us for dinner tomorrow?"

The halfling returns with his bowl of raisins, setting them off to the side. Zoa flutters down before it, and starts picking at them. "That's... an interesting bird," He comments.

Rosalie smiles, leaning sideways conspiratorially, and whispers "I'd be happy to." out of the corner of her mouth.

"Absolutely, Kyrel," The woman says with a smile.

The meal goes superbly. Nimera imparts off, home, taking Zoa in tow, chatting about mirrors and shinies. Heading upstairs, all the booty is poured onto the floor, but Derleth first heads to the temple for appraisal. Which requires waking up the money-eyed priest, who gets a silver for his troubles, and a gold coin for his expertise. As it turns out, a good near 9,000 worth, shrunken into gold bars, or harbored in the gems.

Rosalie rubs her hands together happily. "You'll be taking the spell books, Kyrel?"

Kyrel says, "I would think so. Unless you think we can sell them back to Malvolio..."

Rosalie shrugs. "I think I'd prefer you to keep them, all things be told." She eyes the paper fan longingly ...

Derleth does take the opportunity to turn the bulk of his personal wealth into platinum, and valuable gems...with the coin left from selling magic items, and the shares from Malvolio's trove, he's got too much to carry easily.

_Converting gold into platinum; a wonderful idea. Must do that tomorrow._ Rosalie carefully tucks away her share of the gold, after setting aside a reasonable sum for the inn.

The next morning, Kyrel sets things up to see if the curiously-shaped piece of wood is as important as the magic on it appears. He decides to use the Legend Lore scroll that was found in Malvolio's study. Once everything is in place, he opens the scroll and chants the spell.

Mists premenate Kyrel's vision, first. Then they part, revealing a soft glow. Above this light weaves a silver hand, wind almost 'seen' drifting forth. It begins to bend and twist, bits of metal swirling in a jumble, before joining itself, capturing that ambiant glow within, forming a silver sphere, seeming the size of a mellon. A hole takes up the top, as to the bottom of this structure, through the core. Sphere hovering, while it's surface begins to bubble and grow like wicked-speeded mold, taking shapes much like, Kyrel could tell, a map, or globe of Toril.

Meanwhile, the hand toils, clenches as shiny particals raise to it, roil about it, and elongate with blessed glow. Slowly crystalizing, into a bar of beautiful hue, multi-colored. In the center, a hole itself, before inserted a peg of silver-laced diamond, it would appear. This bar is slid into the hole, locking into the globe.

The sphere is set upon a pedistal, within a hall. As the mists churn within edges of vision, surrounding architecture, furnature, it begins to age blatantly. The sphere is picked up by an unseen person. In a grand hall of a king, then by several bands of explorers. Before it is gripped by a hard faced man, the symbol of a gauntlet gripping green warn on his armor.

The crystaline bar is removed, the diamond from it. He holds forth the globe, and up-swells a display, lighting off a portion of the globe. Showing what looks like a part of the Dalelands. Then goes deeper, showing a stretch of land. Little figures move across it, and with close examination, it looks like an army, moving across the land. Black-armored man nods to several others, who depart him.

\*\*\*Edit: Symbol of a gauntlet gripping a green glow.

Mists change. The black-armored man holds this globe, sliding in the crystal bar. A slight glow issues from a portion of the map, again the view closes in to an area within a forest, arcane signatures rising from it. A word uttered, not exactly understood but implications recieved; a castle. Which, elsewhere, is found within this globe, peered further in, until it is spied. A smile from the armored man, as forces flow towards this castle; it falls to their weight.

Again the change. Anger, it can be felt from this armored fellow. One word: traitors. The diamond snapped into that bar, and implaced. The names of these traitors spoken, and this time, the view alights upon an area, then focuses in. Further, further. A town. A street. Peering into a basement, before showing the hidden whereabouts of a hiding man. Orders given.

The black-armored man sits in a chair, surveying, watchiing. A nod, as it would seem many a force are roving the lands, like angry ants. Items searched out with the very thing. Many in robes or armor with the same holy symbol stand about the armored figure, before the globe is a bright ball of angry light. Above it once more returns the silver hand. Wind takes over the chamber, hair atosttle. Hands go to those symbols, chanting.

Weight, Kyrel can feel, on this very thing. The hand shakes, as those symbols seem to crumble, the robed men appearing torn, harmed deep to their souls. A great thing, the spectator can simply know, the weight only rought to such things when their source of power smote; the death of a god. And thusly the men begin to wither, to turn to dust; there is more at work then this simple, single calling card of the silver hand, the emotions, the representations of a pantheon felt.

Globe claimed in that silver hand. A grip, a flex of fingers, and the surface, the globe's continents, it's lands, they crack, fall to the ground like the pieces of a puzzle. Slow, the weight of pain wrot in sorrow can be divined, as said hand draws forth the crystal rod, the diamond, and sets them, as well as this silver ball, aside. And they are gone.

Glimpses. A piece of the puzzle hidden at the bottom of a lake, in lightless tunnels. Another, buried in the sands of a great desert.

The ages of time, sands sifting through, mists distilling. The visions are gone.

Kyrel shakes his head as the spell ends, almost overwhelmed by the images brought forth. He writes down as much as he can before the memories fade.

_This is a piece of an Artifact. Something lost to history, perhaps deliberately so. It came in three parts - the map of the world, puzzle pieces on a silver sphere, a crystal bar that forms an axis, and a diamond that can be set on the bar. Shaundakal made it. It is an artifact of his purpose; a way to travel, to explore, to look all over the globe. See uncharted lands, and then go to them. That is the first part, what the pieces on the sphere do. The bar lets one be more procise, makes the globe a 'search engine', able to find specific places or types of things much faster. Signatures of strong magic, for instance, Portals, or Wild magic zones, rifts in the Planes, the presence of Great magical intensity._

_The diamond represents the most powerful aspect: pinpointing specific things. If you are able to name something, you can locate it it anywhere the globe could find it otherwise. The globe was in the Church of Shaundakal, a sacred relic in a sacred shrine, before it was stolen. It was used by kings, by adventurers, and others, until it fell into the hands of the Black one. He was apparently a tyrant, and conquered half the world, though there are no records of him... a few ancient tales that might apply. Either time or the deliberate will of the Gods was used to erase the knowledge._

_Shaundakal returned to challenge the Black One's patron, retrieving his Artifact and the Gods banded together to destroy the one of their number who tried to rule everything. He didn't destroy it, though... He just broke it up and dispersed the pieces across the world. Even this piece acts as a portal of knowledge - if you look closely, you can see the changes of weather and things. If I can determine the command words, I should be able to look anywhere in the Dale-lands and see what is happening._

Kyrel puts down his quill, blotting the ink dry. "The Codex Sphere..."

Rosalie peers over Kyrel's shoulder. "Perhaps we should reconsider giving this piece of wood to Nimera's organization ...." Rosalie looks at the fragment, a frown creasing her forehead. "It's rather powerful, and while I'm reasonably sure we could always retrieve the piece from the AOEER later, it might be simpler merely to hold on to it." She looks at Kyrel, appealing to his better side. Or should that be his greedier sider? Perhaps his power hungrier side?

Derleth chews on his lip. "I'm not so certain we should be carrying around an artifact...problem is that people tend to look for those...not always nice people, either. Even if it was the Flame of the Spirit, I'd be leery about holding onto it...rather, instead, turning it over to my Church..."

Kyrel describes what he saw in the spell. "A piece of a _very_ powerful puzzle. I agree - we should keep it. It might be very interesting to get the rest of the pieces. Track down portals, watch the weather and the trade routes and make a killing in the mercantile business..."

Rosalie rubs her hands together happily, then winks at Kyrel. "I always wanted to date a merchant prince."

Kyrel grins. "What you don't want to be one yourself?"

Derleth groans...he can see that this all too well appeals to Kyrel's exploratory nature...

Rosalie shakes her head at Kyrel. "Far better to date him; the profits are about as good, and the workload is substantially reduced."

Kyrel hmmms, considering the options. "Do you think we'd be a target with this thing? We could leave it with your people, Derleth, until we had more of it and wanted to try putting it together..."

Rosalie says, "But would we be able to retrieve it?"

Kyrel says, "I'd think so. Derleth seems to be respected by his church, so they ought to respect his wishes about it."

Rosalie nods slowly. "And if all else fails, we can always _liberate_ it later, I suppose."

Kyrel chuckles. "I'd hope it wouldn't come to that. Lliara probably wouldn't approve."

Derleth holds up a finger. "No...actually, I think of the option of keeping it, or giving it to the church, keeping it would be wiser...Selegaunt has already attracted enough attention, and I wouldn't want to strain the resources of Selegaunts temple, given the recent events..."

Derleth adds a steely glance to Kyrel's comment. "You can liberate whatever you want, but not from my church."

Kyrel says, "Hmm. D'you think it would be a problem? She'd probably just stash it in that shielded cubby. I wouldn't think it would be that much trouble for her."

What Derlath does not say, is that he wonders if his recent dream might be connected to this item...

Rosalie shrugs. "So we keep it. Works for me."

Derleth shakes his head. "It's existence is more likely to be discerned if more people know of its location. I think I agree with your earlier suggestion that we hold onto it after all..."

Rosalie holds up the bag containing the other magic items. "What will we do with these? Them's a cloak, a belt, a brooch and a paper fan." She smiles whimsically. "All things being equal, I'm guessing Kyrel would prefer the cloak. Kiri might enjoy the ... the habitat. As for the brooch and the belt ... well ..." She looks at herself. "Brooches don't do much for me."

Kyrel nods. "And it's harder to spot if it's moving around. Let's see what else we've got."

Kyrel says, "From what Nimera said, the fan is for personal comfort, the belt lets you cast Shield once per day, the cloak is a Cloak of Resistance with an extra-dimensional pocket for your familiar, and the brooch does the same job as a ring of feather-fall."

"And I nearly forgot the scrolls, too. Although I suppose those go to you, Kyrel?" Rosalie looks wistful. "I'm not much good at learning spells."

Derleth eyes the brooch, to see if it would go well with Silniya's outfit...

Kyrel nods. "Arcane spells are my business. It's not like the rest of the crew won't benefit."

Derleth muses. "I think Sil should take the brooch...I'll leave it on her pillow along with the...other things."

Kyrel nods. "If you think I should take the cloak, someone can take the one I've got now. It's not fully resistant, but it is fire-resistant."

Rosalie shakes her head, holding her elvish cloak close. "Dad gave this cloak to me ... But if nobody else needs the belt ...?"

Kyrel nods. "Be my guest. Derleth, you want the fire-cloak?"

Derleth chuckles. "Take the belt...hmmm....but the cloack might be a little big for me, unless it was altered...but since it's not actually magical, perhaps it can be done..."

Kyrel says, "No reason why not. Take it back to the fellow who made it."

Derleth nods, fingering the material. "And the color goes with my surcoat, too!"

Two days later, the party is traveling out. Having Mr. Bones in the back of a cart, as well as a few other things, they're allready on the road. There was news of a little Thorp not too far away, atleast another day's travel. All seem well, Silniya is well rested and comfortable, riding high in the saddle along with everyone else.

"So," Siliniya imparts, "We're first taking Mr. Bones home. Then, galavanting after portals, or world maps?"

Derleth has this goofy smile on his face...he was pleased with the results of the night prior, when Silniya returned..._If loving is all you want me to do, my Lady, I shall do it with all my heart..._ "Aye, that seems to be the plan..." he says aloud. He glances at Kyrel. "reminds me, you had a specific idea of where were going to finds an elven settlement?"

Kyrel says, "We're heading close enough to the High Forest to stop off there. There's still elves living there, so we should be able to have someone take care of the poor fellow."

Silniya's smile is graced. "The High Forest?" She gets at both times a nastalgoc, and then worried look. "I know the northern part like the back of my hand."

Derleth glances at Sil. "I'm sorry, is this a bad thing?"

She glances back, pursing her lips. A glance over the landscape, a hilly, rolling point, with some woods not too far away. "You wouldn't want to go to Waterdeep, and run into your father on the street, right?"

Rosalie looks wistful.

Derleth winces. "Ah. Point taken. I take it there's some untidy bits of your life around there, then."

She simply nods. "Aye. But, the High Forest is beaitiful, no matter where we go..."

Derleth looks interested. "Really? I've never been..."

Silniya holds up a hand, and tips her head. Rose hears it too. Over the hills, just a bit, near the edge of the woods, off the road, they hear it. Crying. It's faint, here, but definetly pinpointed.

Derleth silences immediately, and blinks. _That can't be good..._

Rosalie turns to the crying, holding up her own hand. She looks at Silniya, then turns, trying to gauge distances ...

Silniya nods to Rose, before sitting up, and peering. She squints. A point off the left side of the trail, toward the woods. "That way."

Derleth blinks. _What's that way? What's going on?_ But he doesn't speak, for fear of interrupting.

Rosalie looks back at Derleth, in his noisy armour, and sighs. Then she leans over to whisper in Kyrel's ear. "Crying; a minute or two from here in the woods. Can Kiri take a look?"

Kyrel turns as Silniya and Rosalie stare into the woods. He nods, "Sure." He reaches into the pocket of the cloak and wakes the bat. _The ladies hear something, Kiri. Can you check it out?_

Kiri chirps, and rolls out of the little place. He seems quite happy with it; airy, comfy, just a nice little hole. But, he takes to the sky, and flutters off.

Kyrel stares into space, his mind tracking Kiri's progress.

Kiri flies overhead, and Kyrel can tell he's circling for a moment. Satisfaction, if not some dissapointment tinge to the wizard, feeding back on Kiri's emotions. The bat returns, chittering.

Rosalie waits impatiently, her short bow having appeared in her hand.

Kyrel says, "Just a kid, running around a bit, crying and yelling. Kiri says she's yelling 'muffins'. Could be a name, I suppose."

Siliniya, who does look a little tense, blinks at the announcement. "Oh."

Rosalie turns to look at Silniya. "Shall we? I'm not sanguine about this." She nudges her horse forward, heading into the woods at a cautious walk.

Kyrel looks at the bat. _No adults nearby?_

Kiri chirps a negative.

Silniya offers a little smile. "I don't see the harm. At the least bit, calm her down." A glance back. "What of the cart?"

Derleth blinks. "Hmm. Maybe it's a lost pet?"

Kyrel says, "The lack of adults nearby worries me, though. We're not going to go far. Kiri can stay with the cart and warn us if anything comes."

Rosalie hmmms, still moving forward. "I don't like this, Sil. I think Kyrel's right." With that she pushes her horse into a light trot.

Derleth gees up Platinum once more, following Rose at a slow trot.

Kiri hmphs, stuck with guard duty. His ire ends shortly, as he has found a local grasshopper convention.

Derleth says, "oh come now, Rose...can't be paranoid all the time, even after waht we've been through..."

Rosalie shrugs back at Derleth, and increases her pace a little more.

The cart is let go, and the four travel not far over the hill; just a gallop or so. And, are greeted with the sight of, at the edge of the woods, a little brown haired girl running back and forth, about ten yards or so, calling about "Muffins!" Loudly, voice raw. If one looked far enough, to the northwest, they could spy a little cottage and barn. Well beyond Kiri's range, though.

Rosalie spurs her horse forward, hallo-ing.

The girl turns around, face tear-damp, clutching a ratty blanket to her drab dress. "H-h-hallo?" She calls, voice still shakey.

Derleth allows Rose to take the lead as he looks around, trying to espy whatever the girl might be looking for...

Silniya seems to be doing the same thing. Though, neither precieve anything immediately.

Rosalie jumps down from her horse, and slowly walks forward, finally dropping down on her haunches so her head is level with the kid's. "Hello. I'm Rose."

She shrinks back a second, still sniffling and shaking. "I'm Celia," She replies weakly, clutching the blanket. The girl couldn't be more then six or seven.

Rosalie smiles. "Celia's a pretty name." she tilts her head sideways. "Can I help you find Muffins, Celia?"

Those brown eyes get very big, at Rosalie. "Please please please?" She stepps forward, and tugs on Rose's arm, squeezing it. "Please find Muffins?" She points, shaking a little. "He likes groundsquirrels! An-and he always comes home! But he hasn't come home, and he could've gotten lost, or eaten by a monster!"

Kyrel smiles to himself. "What does Muffins look like, dear?"

Rosalie nods, catching at Celia's hand, and patting it. "We will, dear. But what," she turns to smile ruefully at Kyrel. "Exactly; what does Muffins look like? And where are your parents?"

She looks up, wiping her nose on her arm. "He's brown, and has a white nose, and he's this big," She opens her hands about cat size, "And he likes milk, and he likes his tummy scratched..." She looks towards the Cabin. "Momma's cooking, and Papa went to town, to get some poison..."

Derleth can't help, in spite of himself, to being drawn to the endearing nature of this young child, though he chooses to remain silent.

Rosalie nods slowly. "And he's a kitten?" She turns to Silniya, and raises one eyebrow in question.

Silniya's allready drawn out of the saddle, peering at the woods a second. She looks back to Rose. "Poison? For what?"

Celia nods to Rose. "He's a year old! I got him on my birthday! Muffins was small and squeezable and liked to play! And always comes home..." She bites her lip again, tugging on the skirt of her dress. "One of the sheep's missing, since last week. Papa thinks it's wolves."

Rosalie hrrrms. "Silniya; I'm not the world's best tracker. Do you think ... ?"

IniziiGM looks scared a moment. "Papa said not to come out here, but... but Muffins!" Her eyes get big again. "Please find him, so the wolves don't get muffins?"

Derleth looks wryly at Sil, wondering how she'll react to this...

Teeth grit from the ranger, a second. More like a bit exasperated by the prospect, but she understands that they are farmers, who just... don't understand. Still, she walks over, and offers a stroke to Celia's cheek, kneeling down beside Rose. "Is that Muffin's blanket?" She asks. Celia nods her head a little, clutching it. "May I have it? I kand find Muffins with it," She sooths. This coaxes the blanket from the girl. Silniya smiles, and ruffles her hair.

Derleth breathes a sigh of relief. _That could have gone badly..._

Celia looks up. "Maybe... maybe you could stay the night in the barn, if you find Muffins? Or Momma could cook you something?"

Rosalie smiles at Celia, ruffling her hair. "First things first, kiddo."

Kyrel nods. "We'll look for Muffins for you, Celia. You go back before your mother misses you."

Derleth tries not to smile at the notion of offering Sil a 'roll in the hay'...

She bites her lip, looking from Rose to Silniya to Kyrel. A sniff. "Okay..." She pulls away a little, before looking back, and walking toward the homestead.

Siliniya stands up. "I'll wait until she's out of sight before I can get a better scent of this thing."

Derleth puts a hand on Sil's shoulder. "Thanks, dear...I was afraid you'd take too much offense to her innocent words..."

Rosalie looks back at Silniya, and then towards the farm. "Do you mind if I follow her, and make sure she reaches the cottage safely? I'll be back in a minute or two."

"She's a child. Her father's a farmer. It happens. Thankfully, there isn't enough of them to do serious harm to the species..."

A little motion for Rose to shoo, a weak smile from Silniya.

Rosalie follows after the kid, keeping her in sight until she does indeed reach the cottage safely.

Derleth's thoughts turn grim anyway. "I wonder...I'm sure the elves thought the same way..."

She does, infact, much to a playful teasing from an older brother, and a mother yelling at the lot of them to do this or that, chores and all. Silniya changes, the new leather armor stretching, to accomidate, thankfully. Her nose buries into the blanket, inhaling several times deeply.

Rosalie retraces her step, staying in the background as Silniya works her innate magic.

Derleth watches, his innate curiosity about his wolven lover perked as he imagines what it must be like...to be wolf and human...

Silniya nods her head a moment, and sniffs steadily. "Definetly cat... blood, grass... Celia. Catsmells." She sets the blanket down, and moves towards the woods, sniffing, while fingers sift into the dirt, following, looking. A sneeze. "Territory marked..."

She continues, keeping nose, eyes, touch to the ground. After a good fifteen minutes of wandering around, "Found a trace!"

Rosalie keeps her short bow ready, as she follows Silniya from a respectable distance.

Derleth blinks, chasing after her then as he was busy watching her work...

Kyrel hangs back a bit, watching Silniya search while keeping an eye on the farmstead and listening to Kiri's thoughts as he chases grasshoppers.

Silniya moves rather quickly, now, moving around trees, almost running into a bush in the process. A pause here, to inspect a scratched tree, or wrinkling nose at some scat, before moving on. "Found something!"

Rosalie moves closer. "Yes, Silniya?"

The woman crouches, beastially, over the dead corpse of a groundsquirrel. Which looks rather... bad. "It's been dead for over a day. Looks like a cat did get it," Though, she announces, turning it over with a stick.

"And, th-" Head having lifted a little, her maw gapes. "_Shit._"

Kyrel says, "Well, the kid did say the cat liked... what?"

Rosalie tenses up, and looks around searchingly, her ears straining for any sounds.

Silniya moves in a crouch, off to the side. She stoops over the ground. "This is not good. No, this is less then not good, this is just peachy."

Derleth blinks. "What do you mean?"

"Come here and look for yourselves."

Rosalie moves forward at the suggestion.

Derleth strides to Sil's site, bursting with curiosity.

Silniya points to the ground. Imbedded in it is a foot print. About six inches wide, and two and so feet long. "Giant."

Kyrel walks forward.

Derleth grimaces. "Well, that is a problem...not for the kitten, however, unless the Giant squashed it..."

Rosalie hmmmms, hunkering down. "Right. Giant. Great; Celia's family just got a bigger problem than a missing kitten."

Derleth says, "I mean, a kitten wouldn't even be a light snack for a giant..."

"No, if the giant squished the kitten, we'd see a big stain back there..." She sighs through her teeth. "Not good. Would explain the missing sheep. On the other hand, giants aren't known for their fleet of foot. Tracks are pretty easy to follow."

Kyrel says, "That is not good. But I agree. I doubt a giant would even notice a cat.... and the missing sheep would be logical."

Rosalie stands up again, her head now turning from side to side. "Derleth; do you think these good people would stable our horses and cart? I would hate to just move on, and leave them to deal with the giant."

Derleth smiles. "I'm sure we could convince them to, yes...considering other wise, their uncome will undergo a large drop if the giant likes mutton..."

Rosalie nods. There's that.

Everyone heads back to the horses and cart, before traveling to the cottage. Celia bolts out to meet everyone. "Muffins?" She calls, hopefully.

Celia's mother steps outside of the door, and pauses, seeing the people heading towards her home. "Celia... Come on back..." "But Momma! They could've found Muffins!"

Rosalie shakes her head at the kid, shooing her back into her mother's arms. _Better let Derleth take the lead; he's better at this than I am._

Celia bites her lip, now, looking all the more worried about the cat. But she reluctantly moves back to her mother.

Derleth rides up in front of the group and dismounts. "Derleth of Lliara at your service, dear lady...and my companions."

Derleth manages a florid bow.

Yes, even in his 'clanky' armor.

She blinks, a little, at that, before courtseying in her apron and dress. "Hello, Sir, sirs, madams..." A hesitant smile. "Can I help you?"

Derleth chuckles. "Well, it's more that we were in mind to help you...your daughter was wanting us to find her kitten, but in so doing, we've discovered a slightly...larger problem at hand. One which might require more than a few moments work...and we were wondering if we could trouble you for temporary lodging."

Derleth doesn't look terribly dashing...his tabard an armor are laden with a bit of sweat and road dirt, and his tangled brown hair is slightly mussed...but he does offer a bright smile to the farmwife and her daughter.

She bites her lip a second, before turning down. "Go, go on in the house, Celia." "But-" "No, Go." Shooing the little one inside, she shuts the door. "What's this, now? Is it bad?"

Kyrel says, "Giant."

Derleth winces. "Kyrel, that is a little blunt..."

Her eyes bulge. Her knees look a little weak. "G-giant?"

Rosalie shakes her head at Kyrel's terseness, then nods at the farmwife. "Indeed. A giant. That's probably what ate the sheep."

Derleth moves to support the trembling woman. "My dear, I assure you we can handle the situation...our company has handled greater trouble than a single giant."

She doesn't fall over, but certainly looks a little unnerved. She simply nods. "Percy's no warrior, and the boys are too young..." A look to the woods, before back. "He'll smash the lot of us and eat all the sheep!" A look to the barn. "What... do you need anything?"

Derleth smiles kindly. "As I said, good woman...all we require is likely a night's lodging, even a cooked meal if it's not a trouble...and we will see to it the giant is no further worry.."

Kyrel says, "We consider it a public service."

She nods her head enthusiasticly. "Yes, yes, surely. Helm be praised... Lleria too."

"We'll be back soon enough, ma'am," Silniya assures. "Just stay in doors, and keep your sheep away from the woods' edge, until we return."

Rosalie looks at the two men, enthusiastically offering their services. Inwardly, she sighs. _Ah well; I've heard tales of the treasures of giants ..._

Derleth chuckles, patting the farmwife's hand. "indeed." he murmurs, forgiving the woman's mispronunciation. "We would first store our wagon in your barn, if we could?"

Kyrel says, "If there's room. If not, the yard should be fine."

"Sure. there's just an old cow in there, since the wagon's gone."

"Thank you, again," She says, tugging away from Derleth. "I'll round up the children..."

Derleth smiles broadly. "An it please thee, good lady."

Heading back into the woods, Silniya, in human form since heading to the homestead, spots the signs almost immediately after looking. Either having been on spesific alert, luck, or the Ettin's carelessness. Which, the last is seen by branches broken quite high up, rocks pressed further into the ground, when stepped on. Infact, it doesn't take her long to find a small bluff. After walking around it, she points to an overhang of rock, above a hole in the earth, half choked in weeds. "That should be it.

Rosalie nods at Silniya. "Do you think it's inside now?" she whispers.

Kyrel says, "One way to find out..."

She purses her lips. "Depends on the giant... Some of them are nocturnal, or around during dusk and so, others are daytime ones. Do we go in, spells blazing, or go about it stealthily?"

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Editor:Replace 'Helm' with 'Torm'. There is no Helm in this campaign. :}

Derleth says, "Personally, I prefer a stealthy reconnisance...we can never know what the circumstances are. Maybe Kiri could check things out?"

Kyrel says, "I'd say stealthy. No reason to wake it up if it's asleep, or warn it if it's not there."

Kyrel nods. "Kiri? You're on deck again. Can you check on whether there's a giant in there?"

Kiri chirrups, and flies off toward, before dipping into the tunnel.

And flies back, rather quickly, chirrping.

Rosalie moves to the side of the cave entrance, an arrow nocked on her bow.

All head up the slight incline, to the cave mouth.

Kyrel says, "It's there, all right. One ettin, or two giants... and the cat's in there, too. No big spells."

Derleth blinks. "The cat's there? What would the giant be doing with the cat?"

_What does an ettin want with a cat?_ Rosalie shakes her head, ears straining to catch any sound.

The voices are pretty loud, now that all focus their hearing. The 'yrrowl!' of a cat, coupled with chuckling, hooting, and loud conversation.

Derleth grimaces. _Sounds like he's probably toying with it..._

Rosalie turns to the others, her lips shaping the word _ambush_ slowly and carefully, after which she cocks her head at the cave.

Rosalie peers inside. She can't exactly see what's going on, because there's a bend at the end of a short tunnel. Light's coming from within.

Kyrel nods, and prepares his magic missile spell.

Silniya unsheaths her swords.

Derleth murmurs a prayer to Lliara as he brings his flail to bear, moving in with his companions...

As the group sneaks in, they hear the words more clearly. In a deep, gravelly voice, that attempts to sound as squeakily as possible, "Aren't you a cute Gralluk!" An equal one returns, "Hello, I'm Gralluk!" Punctuated with the mrrowling annoyance of the cat. "He's a fisty one, Brumby!" "Hhehe!"

Derleth's brow creases, as he decides to sling his flail, and loads his crossbow instead as he creeps forward, ready to pounce if it sound slike the cat's situation gets worse...

Rosalie keeps to the shadows as she moves forward, her eyes straining to see around the corner.

Rosalie peers around the corner. A fire is going in one corner. In the other, sitting on a big heap of furs, is an Ettin. One head has a rather big wart on the nose, and missing a few teeth. The other has a flattened nose, and a wide, crooked grin. Not so much from the attitude, but the crookedness of the teeth. The hand on the side of Wart-nose is holding Muffins by the scruff, while the one of Crooked-teeth is tickling the cat's tummy. As much as a giant can tickle a cat, which is much like a human tickling a mouse. The cat is clawing at the finger, which doesn't really scratch the hard skin. "Hehe! Gralluk wants another bouncey lesson?" Wart-nose asks. "Ya! Fly," Crooked comments.

Wart-nose turns the cat over in his hand, and bounces it a few feet in the air, to carefully catch.

Rosalie turns back to the party. She holds up one finger, and then points at the corner where the ettin sits. Then she raises an eyebrow. _Attack?_ she mouths?

Derleth nods to Rose, showing his readiness.

Kyrel nods and flexes his fingers.

Rosalie steps forward slightly, pulling back her bow and letting the arrow fly. But a tiny arrow like this will do ... little damage. Even if it does manage to do a little damage.

Derleth steps out into the open beside Rose, and pulls the trigger on his crossbow...

Silniya reaches up to touch the pendant at her throat, invoking the inlayed spell, before unsheathing her weaposn up.

Kyrel decides that there's really nothing for it but to kill the creature. _It's not like it can be reasoned with, and it's already hurting the farmer by stealing livestock._ He steps around the corner and uses his overloaded Magic Missile. The green bolts flash out and strike the creature, neatly avoiding the cat.

The ettin lifts it's heads, as Rose shoots Wort-face in the upper arm. "Ow!" He drops Muffins, who falls to the ground, and is just **gone**, past the group. Kyrel's bolts hammer into the Ettin, sending it back onto the ground, fortuantely out of the path of Der's crossbow bolt. "Hey! Who you?" One shrieks. "Quit it!"

Derleth looks wry. _Twice as many brains, and no more intelligent for it._ He offers no witty commentary, and moves forward, drawing his flail once more, hoping the cat gets out of the way quickly....attacking the fallen ettin...

Silniya follows Derleth quickly, pouncing toward the giant with blade leading.

Derleth's flail weaves in, crashing into the Ettin's knee, earning a choris of howls from the both of them. It gropes back, for an Enormous club and axe, near it's fallen form. Silniya, however, gives it pause, as her sword sinks into it's lower stomach.

Kyrel chants his spell again, though without quite so much force this time. The bolts that flash out are weaker than the first time, but still sink deep into the creature.

However, despite their weakness, they do the job. A bombardment on the enormous, twelve foot tall Giant simply crushes in enough to collapse the thing. "Gruggle... It's dark," Wort-Nose comments, spitting up a bit of blood, before the both of them sag.

Derleth breathes a sigh of relief. "Lliara be praised." he wipes his brow.

Rosalie moves deeper into the cave, her bow at the ready, as she appraises her surroundings.

Silniya draws her blade back, and stares at the giant a second, before turning around, and just walking off, out of the cave.

Derleth stars looking around for the kitten then...

Kyrel snorts. "Altogether too easy. I feel sorry for the thing. But he could've done quite a lot of damage to the family and the average caravan passing along the road."

Pretty meager. A fire, some fresh sheepskin, the Ettin's enormous weapons. Muffins seems to have just high-tailed it out of there, and no doubt the smartest thing it could've done.

Derleth smiles at Kyrel's comment. "Luck was with us to bring it down easy, aye." He sighs. "I'll go find the cat..."

Kyrel says, "Muffin's probably home already. Go talk to Silniya, Derleth. She looked a bit upset."

Rosalie nods, bending over the Ettin's body. "I'll be out in a moment." She pauses. _Now where, if anywhere, would it hide its valuables?_

Derleth blinks, and feels guilty that Kyrel noted that before him. He chases out after Sil.

Silniya is half way down the slight slope, pacing a little bit, wiping her blade a little firmly with a piece of cloth.

Derleth comes up beside his lady love, touching her on the shoulder. "Sil..is all well?" he says tenatively.

Rosalie pulls out her goggles, carefully settling them over her eyes before she surveys the cave.

She halts a second, and wheels around, before staring at Derleth a second. Then sheaths her sword. "Oh, fine. Lovely," She replies. Not a good liar, she.

Derleth can't help but cringe back slightly at Sil's held back anger. "Sil...love...please. I can see your anger, and I would quell it, if I could." he says in a low voice.

Rose doesn't need to look too hard. She finds some round rocks, or a flat edged one, a dented tin box, a large horseshoe, some rope, and the iron bands that go to a barrel.

She glares a second, before looking to the cave mouth. "When you and I contribute to it, I really don't see it getting quenched so easily."

Rosalie shrugs at Kyrel, after surveying the cave one last time. "Well, at least the cat is saved." She listens a moment, then blinks. Hurrying outside, she looks for her friends, and finds Silniya glaring at her.

Derleth blinks. "I don't understand..."

"What did we just do."

Derleth chews on that. "We killed a giant. A creature of more instinct and violence than intellect. Or is it that you feel as if we treated it unfairly, by summarily killing him?"

Rosalie looks behind her, just to check if there's something she missed. Then, looking confused she looks to Kyrel for an explanation.

Kyrel sighs. "We did what we had to, Sil. Do you think the ettin would have left if we'd asked it nicely? And even if it had, where would it have gone? Probably to some other farmstead to find more sheep. Sooner or later it would have killed someone."

She stabs a finger toward the cave. "You're damned right I am. What did we just do? We threw ourselves into the home of something, and killed it unmercifully. It was _playing with a cat_ for gods' sake." She turns to Kyrel. "Are you telling me, with your brains bigger then it's feet that you couldn't have tricked the stupid thing? By my recounts, I remember you having made deals with _Frost_ giants before."

Kyrel says, "Frost giants can be reasoned with, and they were in their own territory at the time. I know how you feel. I wasn't happy about doing that either, but..."

Derleth tries to face Sil calmly.. "The Jarl and her tribe were reasonable, Sil. Not everything is."

Rosalie looks perplexed once more. "Silniya; if we'd tricked it into giving back the cat, how would that have solved the bigger problem? How could we guarantee it wouldn't attack the farmer? Or little Celia?"

"I was brought up to be a peacekeeper in the forest. To either nurse things back to health, or kill it when it didn't have a chance. Protect those that dwelled in forests, and did my best to keep up with the balance that the druids spoke of." A gesture to the cavemouth. "And what'd I do? The same gods damned thing that the Humans are doing. I put poison out for the wolves." Her lips pursed. "I guess it just lives by instinct and violence instead of intellect. Same thing's said about Werewolves, isn't it?"

Rosalie says, "So if you had to choose, Silniya, between Celia and the ettin, which would you choose?"

"So it's either kill one or the other, Rose?"

Derleth puts a hand to Sil's cheek. "You are not a monster, Sil...and you are far more sentient than the ettin was. Hell, would you have us negociate with basilisks as well, who have only a little less intelligence than that giant? Sometimes words just are not as powerful as actions. The balance must be kept, aye...but we must value somethings more than others."

Rosalie says, "Sometimes? Yes. Could we guarantee that the ettin would never attack humans? Or ... speculate with me. The creature liked to play with the cat because it was cute. Celia was cute too. How long would she have lasted, had the ettin taken a fancy to her?"

Silniya pulls her head away from the touch. "It's smarter then an animal, Derleth. And what we did was not merciful. There's a difference between killing a bad man in his sleep, and killing him in a duel. It didn't even have a chance to defend itself, period. That sounds sort've stupid, seeing as one of us would've gotten hurt, but that's essentially kicking someone's door in and killing them. There are nastier things that could lodge here then that Ettin; you telling me Celia's father couldn't have offered it a sheep ever so often to keep the more dangerous creatures **away**?"

"Or is it better for them to depend on the kindness of wandering sellswords?"

Rosalie says, "An ettin eats a lot of sheep; the farmer would lose his herd within a year, two at the most. And then where would he be? But you're right; there was ..." She pauses, digging her toe into the ground. "There was little honour in the way he - or they - died."

Derleth blinks, and finds himself without words. "I would you had spoken of this earlier." he murmurs after a long moment.

"And I didn't think about it until I'd done it. Come on. We have a cat to find." She turns, and walks and starts further on, peering about, into trees.

Kyrel looks pensive, and a little upset. "Aye. But... I doubt it would have worked, milady wolf. And next time we'll do better."

Derleth merely follows without words, feeling as though, even if it was not directed merely at him, that a wound has opened between himself and Silniya.

Rosalie sighs, following slowly. _Why do the cleanest kills become the ugliest?_
