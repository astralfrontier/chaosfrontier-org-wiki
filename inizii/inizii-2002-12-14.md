Logfile from PL-Kyrel.

Kyrel watches the demonic creature fade away. "Well, isn't this a lovely thing. I'd be tempted to do it, if we could keep this assassin-demon off Faerun for a while."

Derleth sighs. "You know, maybe we can call this quits. We leave the scythe here, I Stone shape the entrance to the first chamber with a nice thick wall...and we go deal with the Blight."

Rosalie sighs, looking at the scythe she is holding. "I ... I don't know. I can think of several ways that we and ours are protected that are less than ... optimal."

Derleth says, "And once the blight is dealt with, we should just leave. Plane shift out, and then find a way back that's far away from the forest."

Silniya begins to pace, shaking her head, fingers trumming the hilts of her swords. "On the one hand, we make a deal with a demon... in more ways then one. But we get the location of a Defiler."

Rosalie looks at Silniya. "What's the easiest way to keep us and ours safe? Shift us into a pocket dimension, lock the door, and throw away the door. Then we know where the Defiler is, but we can never reach him ..."

Kyrel says, "One thing is for sure, we don't want to hand this over to anyone else here. I don't trust _us_ with it, let alone someone we've only just met. Getting the Defilers is the key, and I don't see how the sickle helps us with that."

Derleth shakes his head. "We don't need the demon's help. IF we have to, we can do it ourselves. "

Kyrel says, "You have an idea on that?"

"It's a big forest," Silniya says, looking to Derleth. "A big forest that's wasting away as we wait here. How could we just Find it? By the way the demon said it, they havn't been found yet, so they're still a problem. What if they're using magic to hide, no one else can find them?"

Derleth rolls his eyes. "Come on. Remember the dead glade with the tainted elemental? The blight's gotta be leaving a big ass trail."

Kyrel says, "Not if it's randomly affecting patches of the forest. It didn't seem to be leaving a trail from that glade."

Silniya shakes her head. "That's only when they use Blight magic. It isn't as though their very steps poison the earth."

Derleth says, "But that's not the point. The point is we can't trust the Balor. Hell, I don't trust anyone that has a lawyer to begin with. If we give them the sythe, this is going to come back and bite us in the ass, guaranteed."

Derleth says, "Hell, I have more to lose than the rest of you, leaving the sythe. Platinum's been my friend for years. But..."

Rosalie nods ...

Silniya snorts. "You have more to lose? I have a home that's turning to dust. If we **don't** give them the scythe, don't you think that will bite us too?"

Rosalie turns to Derleth. "You had mentioned asking Lliara's guidance ..."

Derleth says, "Are you saying you have that little faith in our own abilities, much less Sessis's, Sil? That maknig a deal with the devil is the only way to do this? hell, I'd point out that we were going to try to find them anyway, before the balor's offer."

"And are you doubting the suggestion of your goddess?" Sil fires back. "Did she not say fortune would find a way? And, as luck would have it, look, a way."

Derleth nods. "The way the divination was phrased, maybe she percieved the balor's offer to be out way out. But she's not Alaundo. She can't predict what might happen as a result."

Rosalie shrugs. "Maybe we can, instead, ask the goddess where to find the Defilers."

Kyrel says, "You can deal with the creatures if you're careful. They are bound by their word."

Derleth is troubled, though. Going against the divination implies a lack of faith in his Lady. But his gut tells him that just giving it up would be wrong...

Rosalie says, "If nothing else, I want to know how they would protect us and ours from the insane demon."

Derleth shakes his head at Rose. "Not today. I only memorized one divination." He sighs.

Rosalie says, "We have time ... we can wait." She holds out the blue spinel. "If you need this, it's there."

Derleth shakes his head. "No, we don't have time. Not with the Defiler's still on the loose."

Silniya sits down, cupping her forehead. A few breaths later. "I just want them stopped, as soon as I can... The more we wait, the more my stomach turns."

Rosalie ahs ... She looks down at the scythe in her hand, and shakes it a little. "Do you seek freedom, scythe? Do you seek freedom over death?"

Derleth snorts. "Obviously, it does not desire death."

_What do you think._

Kyrel says, "If they want him back badly enough, I think we can make a deal. None of them bothers us or people we care about; no repeat of Hellgate; and the sickle-entity stays away from Faerun for, oh, a millenium. Did I leave anything out?"

Rosalie looks at the scythe. "I don't know what to think. Someone has made an offer for you; promising to free you. How badly do you want your freedom?"

Derleth feels sick to his stomach as well. This whole mess gnaws at him _I must trust in the Lady._ he murmurs. He takes out a golden coin, one which happens to be minted with Her visage. "Heads, we give it to them, tails we leave it here.."

The runes seethe at Kyrel's pronouncement for a moment. _I want free. I have been too long in my own weapon._

Derleth flips the coin, catching it and smacking it against his other palm.

Silniya blinks, before looking towards Derleth. Though, she holds her tongue.

Rosalie nods at the scythe. "A feeling, believe me, I can fully understand." She sighs. "But ... we wonder what you will do, if you are freed. We ... fear what you will do."

The words almost seemed pained, hesitant. Reluctant. _I will not harm you._

Derleth removes his hand, and the smiling side of the coin greets him, Lliara's decree. Heads.

Rosalie smiles at the scythe. "That is a kind statement to make. Will you harm others? When I was freed, I was so happy I could not bear the thought of hurting others; will your freedom please you?"

_Yet you ate animals, you have no doubt killed when you had to. That is no different then my nature._

Derleth closes his eyes briefly, and pockets the coin. "Alright...someone call jackalhead. Let's get this over with."

Rosalie smiles. "When we need to kill, we do so. But we do not seek the killing." She looks up at Derleth. "May I have a moment more?"

Derleth nods, sitting down. _I must have faith in the Lady._

Rosalie looks back down at the scythe, and smiles wistfully. "Will you kill only when necessity drives you? When self defence requires it? Or will you go on a killing spree, avenging yourself on all and sundry for your captivity?"

_You are asking to go against nature. As asking the priest there to not have faith. I am an assassin, not a dretch. I am selective, never rampage. I will not come to Faerun for a millenium._

Derleth doesn't bother questioning why Rose is questioning a professional assassin. He just sits and prays silently to Lliara.

Silniya scoots over beside Derleth, and puts her arm around him, lowering her head quietly as he prays.

Rosalie smiles. "It was the rampage we feared. Or at least, that I feared. Many people, freed at last from an impossible captivity, lash out at innocents. It is easy for an assassin to kill needlessly, but I understand that an assassin must needs kill. I hope you have great pleasure of your freedom."

Kyrel nods. "Just so. I'm not sure what this ends up having to do with the Blight, but I think it's a good chance to get the sickle out of here."

Once more the reluctance. _Your understanding is interesting._

Rosalie smiles widely at the scythe. "I was trapped in a web of my own." She turns to Derleth and Silniya. "Thank you." She holds up the sword. "Let us call his freedom."

Derleth squeezes Sil's hand briefly. "Someone else talk to the lawyer. I'd be too tempted to spit in his face."

Kyrel says, "Just have to hedge him about with logical restrictions. I think that's my job in any event."

Silniya nuzzles her chin into Derleth's hair.

Rosalie nods. "Please, Kyrel, ask the lawyer to promise that he will be freed. Leaving him trapped now would be cruel."

Derleth smiles a little, and reaches a hand across, stroking Sil's cheek. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be so angry, or obtuse." he murmurs to her.

Kyrel says, "I thought that's what he said he intended, but I'll make a note of it. Shall we, then?"

Silniya just nods. "As for me. We're just a little focused on what we think is important."

Kyrel says, "Has anyone else come up with any stipulations to add to our request?"

Rosalie looks ruefully at the glove. "I suppose ... do we keep this?"

Kyrel waits for a response, but no one seems to have anything else to add. "I don't see why not. I doubt they want it where they're going..."

Derleth chuckles wryly. "I doubt they'll need it...and it could be damn useful in the future."

Rosalie nods. "Well; let us do it then."

Kyrel looks back to the staircase. "Enithril? I think we're decided."

Derleth takes a moment then, to make up with Sil. It involves a lot of kissing. Once done, Derleth looks a little ruffled and his cheeks are red.

The sound of footsteps increases from a gentle pat to an echo, just around the bend of the spiral stair. The daemon walks into view, nodding his head. "Good," He sooths. "Your verdict?"

As soon as Derleth's done, Silniya rubs her cheek to his, before standing as Enithril makes his presence.

Kyrel says, "With a few safeguards, I think we're agreed to let you deal with it in exchange for information on the Defilers." He ticks off the points on his fingers. "One: No one from your faction is to attempt to do anything, either directly or indirectly, that affects the four of us or those we have significant attachments to, either now or at some future time. Two: You will not attempt to re-establish Hellgate in any form. Three: The entity bound in the sickle is banished from Faerun for the space of one millennium. Four: You will release the entity from the sickle as soon as practicable upon your departure from this plane. Five: You provide us with the information we need to deal with the Defilers. Is this acceptable?"

Rosalie looks down at the scythe in her hand. "I hope you do not mind your banishment. I doubt we will meet again." She smiles, wryly. "Which could be either good ... or a pity."

Enithril winces, atleast at one or two of them. "Very well," He admits. A gesture, as a roll of parchment rolls from his fingers. A raven pen he waves at the pages a moment, squinting an eye, before nodding. "Fair, fair. We will give you the location to help you deal with the threat to your forest, he will be released no worry there. The millenium thing is quite a below the belt strike, but... It's worth it. And yes, safeguards, yes yes." He holds out the piece of parchment and quill. "Your name, then. You may read the parchment; no hidden clauses, as said before."

_It is a worse banishment then if I had died on your plane. But, I will be free everywhere else._

Rosalie nods at the scythe, then turns to look at the lawyer. "How soon will his freedom be practicable?"

Kyrel checks over the scroll to make sure it says what it's supposed to.

"As soon as I return to the Abyss," Enithril admits. Kyrel finds no miniature text, or sneaky tricks. It looks just right.

Rosalie says, "And when will you return to the Abyss?"

"After I port you to where ever you need to be," He returns crisply.

Kyrel says, "Looks right. Very well.... " He pauses, wondering about that himself. _I don't think they can free him until they get there, but could he be planning to stay here and cause trouble? Probably not, the rest of the document restricts that rather badly._

Rosalie nods. "So he will be freed in no more than a day's time?" She looks at Kyrel. "Sorry; I had to make sure."

Kyrel nods. "Wasn't a bad thought, either... but everything looks right." He signs with a flourish, name and sigil.

"Yes, yes," Enithril says almost impatiently. "We require his services for a pit fiend, and so."

Rosalie holds out the scythe. "Good luck, and may your travels be less restricted in future." She smiles whimsically. "And perhaps, one day, you'll drop us a line?"

Kyrel passes the document over to Rosalie. "I think we all need to sign it before it goes into effect."

Derleth rolls his eyes. _Rose can be friendly at the strangest times, occasionally..._

Rosalie ahs, and quickly signs the scroll in an elaborate alphabet.

Silniya looks reluctant, herself, and walks over to inspect the document too. Then shakes her head, and writes her name simply, before casting a glance to Derleth.

The response Rose recieves is merely a bubbling of glyphs that seems like amusement.

Derleth smiles at Sil. "My father is the businessman. If it's good enough for Kyrel, it's good enough for me."

Derleth comes over and signs the document.

Enithril retrieves the document, rolling it back up and letting it disappear. "Right, then. Now," A piece of parchment is drawn from a pocket, "This here is a map, to the detail of where you will find Milinali, the head Defiler's right hand. Fortunately, his left hand has been destroyed, as well as a fourth and fifth. The head is currently hiding well beyond our reaches, a sneaky bastard, that. However, his assistant is a druid who has taken taken homage here in this spot, while herself is hidden by a spell that twists the environment, making those who wander through get lost and not notice her spot. If you desire, we can get you within the spell's reach, and closer to her."

Derleth looks at the others. "Sounds like the thing to do..."

Silniya shakes her head at the mention of a druid. She walks over, taking up the map, observing. "Derleth," She asks, "Do you recall that enchantment that let me move through the webs effortlessly?"

Derleth nods. "Yes...what about it?"

Silniya purses her lips. "Well, I advise you stock another one or three. Druids can warp the very world around you, and grip you in place. One of those would be wise." She considers, before shaking her head, rolling up the scroll. "How could a Druid destroy the very land she tended?"

Kyrel says, "That's what bothers me. Insane, most likely, or possessed."

Derleth nods. "That is one of the prayers I usually have about me...partly because it is a part of the domain of spells Lliara favors."

Derleth shakes his head in regards to Sil's second question, however. "I would have to concur with Kyrel."

Silniya puts the map away, before turning to the infernal dealer. "Then, let's get to it."

Enithril gets everyone to come forward, as he opens forth a portal, before walking through. As everyone fallows reluctantly, they find themselves in some forest, the canopy above dark and nearly keeping the sun at bay. Someone is screaming in pain and fear not too far off. The horses are all gathered, tethered to the trees, and seem all fully spooked.

"The scythe, please," He requests, holding his hand to Rose.

Rosalie holds out the scythe, still smiling crookedly. _If mum hears off this ... I wonder what she'll think. Or dad ..._

Enithril takes the scythe, and nods to Rosalie, before walking backwards into nothingness. The last sight of him is shifting the scythe into a salute.

Rosalie starts at the screaming, and searches out a direction while she digs out her bow. This time, she's going to try using ranged weapons first.

Silniya unsheathes her swords, and glancse to Derleth. "This time, You take the movement spell. So you can get healing to however needs it unheeded."

Kyrel murmurs, "Shall we try the screaming first? High Sentry, Kiri."

Derleth looks reluctant, but he nods, clasping his medallion as he calls on Lliara. There is a brief mental image of his body glistening, as if with magical oils, and then it is gone, and he feels Lliara's protection.

Kiri chitters, flying out of Kyrel's coat. He moves higher into the canopy, and is nearly lanched by an enormous tongue that darts out at the bat. Tracing back to its' place, the sight of some camulfodged lizard crawling along some tree.

Derleth chuckles wryly, notching a magical bolt into his crossbow. "Where there's screaming, there's likely blokes to bash."

Rosalie slides into the shadows, and moves quickly but stealthily towards the screaming.

And they move, as silent and smooth as they can. And they spot it. Down a brief slope is a little grove, trees dotted about it. However, it would seem this grove has become Hell's Garden. Bodies, live and dead, are gripped by vines and earthen ropes, attached to trees, their limbs or trunks. There are several allready dead, some only indented beneath the earth at plants' roots. Some wither in their binds, others lay unconcious. A multitude of beings stretch out, from some troglodyte corpse, to a several elven captives, one wood, while the others are drow. A dark elf is the one who's screaming, his body stretched out by vines.

And why he is screaming is obvious; the caretaker of this infernal place approaches. Like a ghost, she is. Long white hair drifts down a nearly naked body of equally white skin. The elf would be an albino, except for the blue eyes that speak only of innocence. Her only dressing a leather belt draped with pouches and containers, and a single fine that wraps around one leg, about the waist, and up, to circle the oposite arm. "Shhh," She coos to the dark elf, and reaches forward. "Shh." He screams louder, as her back gets in the way of all's view. But the contortions of his face are obvious, the pain wracked expression blatant. While his captor lifts her hand, carressing his face, kissing the drow's forehead. "Mother shall make it better, quiet now," She intones in an almost childlike voice. And her shoulder jerks. He sags. Turning, holding a soaked, scarlet heart in her hand, she approaches a tree in the center of the grove, crooning. "Mother's coming."

As the group approaches, the very forest around them groans. The trees stir, every square inch a threat, lurking. Shadows in the foresty hell creeks, or slithers.

Rosalie nocks an arrow, pulls back her bowstring, and releases. Some things ...

Derleth hisses in awe of the disgusting scene laid out before them. He raises his crossbow, seconds behind Rose, though he does not see her own action before letting the blessed quarrel fly...

Kyrel hisses in shock as the druidess - if that's what she still is - kills the drow while crooning as if to a child. His own response, like his friends, is to attack. The harshly-muttered syllables of the magic missile spell are followed by the green bolts flashing at the white elf.

Silniya's moving forward allready, and steps upon the earth. A vine, hidden in the underbrush, snaps to, coiling around her legs and as the branch above simply yanks her off her feet, pulling her into the air. "Damnit!" She exclaims, changing in mid-curse. The missiles streak in, hitting the elf broadside, and halting her. She looks down in puzzlement. "Ouch." The streaks of arcane hit her, knocking her squarely off her feet, rolling by the tree. "Sister life! No, no, no. No you will not have them!" As if some trap were triggered, the earth not far begins to bubble. Part of it raises, pulls upward like some barrier, a good five feet high, while the ground before it sinks, bowls down into a trench. "Come to me, come children!"

Silniya, up in her spot, rolls upward and swings her shortsword, shearing the snare in two. Down she falls, to land on her shoulders with a thud. "Remember, we have to ask her where her leader is," She snarls, rolling to her feet, and approaches the ditch, before barking in pain, moving back, leaving a bloody trail from her feet. "She's got the earth spiked!"

Derleth grunts. "Hmm. Interrogate a madwoman.That should be fun." he mutters to himself, his mind racing as he considers his next move...

The trees above seem to be alive. A heart of leaves and vines shoots a stalk towards Rosalie, which smacks the dirt from her agile movement. Plants, branches, all about begin to twist and weave, as the choking of vines begins to pulse.

Kyrel glances up at the trees and vines, and calls his familiar back to him before anything bad can happen. He takes the werewolf's warning, but doesn't fly any farther above the ground than he has to because of the seeking vines. He reaches into his belt pouch to retrieve the lightning wand, flies forward far enough to see over the barrier and fires at the druid. "This ends now! Look at what you're doing!"

As Kyrel flies over the barrier, the tree above the druid shivers briefly. From the shadows of its' branches, the wizard can barely make out the presence of black on yellow, before it's hurtling toward him at deadly force. And hits him, squarely. A deadly maw of teeth sinks into his shoulder, as one forward paw drags across his chest, the enormous jaguar shaking as it clings to the flying wizard, snarling in defiance to the crackling wand, the mage hit before his wand could go off.

Kyrel can see the vine wrapped around Milinali's body begin to pulse and ripple, as little smaller ones sprout from it, beginning to wrap around her body, coiling to the likeness of an armor.

Kyrel is just about to fire at the druidess when the jaguar erupts from the tree. He fires the wand at it, instead, as it leaps through the air.

Rosalie growls, seeing the spikes and the barrier. But until she's up, if not over, the druid is out of reach. Also out of sight. She growls, charging forward through the spikes, and swarms up the barrier. Reaching the top, she catches her breath, and then lets loose a blast of frigid air.

The jaguar takes the blast, its' body twitching, but that only fuels the fire of the pain it dishes forth.

Rosalie is up and over the spot, but Milinali sees her coming, and is lithe enough to twist out of the way of the freezing cone. However, her apparent victims, still clasped in the trees, are not so lucky, one or two blasted with the fridgid air in the process.

"No, no, Sister life, you're taking him again," Milinali hisses at Rose, one hand protectively falling to her stomach, over a scar. "No, Brother Decay welcomes me! Father loves me! He shuns you, he won't let you! You send your rats after my fruits, never!"

Derleth growls. _What a time to be unable to go ethereal. Fine. If I can't go to the druid, then the druid can get her head twisted off. Two can play the minion summoning thing._ His lips part in a spell of summoning, and a giant eagle appears from this air, called by the spell. He mentally commands his ally to swoop down and attack the druidess as he watches Kyrel and the jaguar worriedly...

Wings spread high, as it comes into being. The Eagle closes its' wings, and dives towards the druid, before spreading them as it flies overhead, lashing at her with its' talons. A vine from her armor snaps out, dodging as she ducks down. From her belt she takes a small leather waterskin, downing it fast, before her motions seem much more quick, speedy. She darts back, laying her hand on a tree, while eyes, tearfull, gaze upon her jaguar. "They have you, baby..." She begins to sing, soft and haunting, before melting back into the tree.

Silniya howls in annoyance, and looks around. "She's gone! The bitch, she's gone!" The woman looks around, before moving to the lip of the trench. "Kyrel, fly back! I'll get the cat."

Kyrel has grabbed his dagger from its sheath in a desparate attempt to fend off the crazed feline. "Get off me, already!"

Plantmatter explodes around them, the draperies and branches, vines and bushes twist and pull toward them. Fortunately, none are gripped sans Derleth's eagle, but it makes things a horrid maze of writhing plants, as the throng of vines situated in the tree creeps forward.

Kyrel's dagger cuts into the jaguar's underside, and it snarls, hissing and starting to fall off as a snaking vine nearly knocks it loose. His writhing and movement, and the stiff joints from the lightning blast make a problem. The cat jumps backwards, off of Kyrel, landing a few feet away with a threatening growl toward Rosalie.

Rosalie snaps her fingers, the short sword appearing in her left hand. A quick shuffle later, she moves past Kyrel to sink the short sword into the cat's haunches.

Rosalie darts over the barrier, and as the jaguar rears up, ready to send its' bloodied claws into her, she stabs it right in the chest. It yrrowls, and shrinks back, looking on its' last legs, but there's a feral bloodlust in those eyes, now, a cornered look, as it goes low to the ghround.

Silniya looks left and right, "Derleth, do you see her?"

Derleth shakes his head...and he knows he has no way of finding her either. So he concentrates on the enemy he can see. "No...but maybe this will draw her out." He points a hand at the tree that houses the killer vine. "The holy fire of Lliara shall strike you down!" he calls out, a pillar of flame descending on the tree...

Derleth's divine fire comes down, consuming the tree and anything in it. As the fire dies, it shows a blasted tree, burning with a nasty rope of smoke, bird and assorted animal carcasses falling from it, and for the moment, the land relents.

And, about that time, the ground at Derleth's feet begins to bubble and churn. Up from the dirt floor bubbles up some red, crimson fluid, that pools, and surges higher, higher, rippling into the form of a humanoid. Blood, blackish red consumes the thing, and in the center, the heart of the drow pulses. It looks at Derleth, simply, before a tendril whips out at him.

It hits the cleric across the chest, and he can feel the very blood in his veins freezing, leeching from his skin, sucked into this creature of crimson.

Derleth cries out in pain, his eyes wild as he beholds the monstrous thing...

Silniya cries out as well, and simply charges the thing attacking Derleth, her sword cleaving through the watery body, its' exterior rippling and shrinking slightly, before turning its' 'face' on her.

The cat snarls, and leaps at Rosalie, clawing and raking at the woman, trying to get at her. It's all Rose can do to dodge the flashing fangs and seeking talons from the feline, ducking and weaving and parrying with the blade.

Kyrel glances down at Rosalie and the jaguar for a moment, before turning his attention to Derleth. _She can handle the cat, no problem... but what is **that** thing?_ He speaks the syllables of the magic missile again, firing the green bolts at the hideous blood-creature.

Rosalie growls at the feline, ducking and weaving closer, the better to slider her short sword through the cat's hide once more.

Kyrel's bolts of magic streak in, and slam into the blood spirite with an explosion, splattering Derleth and Silniya. The thing looks no more then a thick column now, churning around the rapidly beating heart.

The cat lunges at Rosalie again, and she grabs with both hands, stabbing downward as it goes at her middle. The blade cleaves downward, between the Jaguar's shoulders, before she rolls back. It yrrowls in horrible pain, clawing the ground, hissing and shrinking, until it sags.

Derleth pulls out his blessed flail...choosing to save his spells as he attacks the unholy creation with a war cry...

The flail cleaves in, and actually strikes the pumping heart. It flies a short distance, rolling on the ground, the column collapsing. It seems finished, before the organ begins to pump, a bubble of crimson gunk forming around it, as it slithers to Derleth, and nearly all of it makes up the tendril that strikes this time.

It misses, however, and sags under its' weight.

The forest rumbles, the trees shake, and rattle. And they see it, moving like a wall of vegetable waste, some rolling thunder of a Thing. Towering huge, with nearly tree trunks that look like arms. It rears up, and lashes outward at Derleth, not breaking stride.

The forest seems to open up, as a small globe of water speeds into the battle field. Rose sees it first, and ducks behidn the barrier, before everyone's vision is filled with an enormous explosion of water, blasting everything.

The tree trunk knocks Derleth across the chest, nearly driving him to his knees, before it turns to the rest of them.

Silniya turns towards it, and having nothing else to do, has to distract this thing from everyone else, despite the sting of the water on her back. She simply starts to hack into it, looking to get its' attention.

Derleth is doubled over, gasping..._Okay...I think that broke a rib...brobably more than one..._

THe water knocks Kyrel out of the air, and back behind the barrier, floating down to sag, crumpled, on the ground.

Rosalie sees Kyrel go down. "Silniya! Derleth! I'll help Kyrel." She jumps down to where Kyrel leaps, her fingers fumbling a bottle out of the pouch in her waist. She pulls out the potion Droxz gave them, not so long ago. Pulling the cap off the bottle with her teeth, she cradles Kyrel's head with one hand, and pours the potion down his throat.

The eagle swoops down at the mound, and claws at where the 'head' would be. However, there is no luck; it doesn't quite work.

Kyrel opens his eyes as the claw marks fade from his body. "Ouch. What exploded?" He looks around and sees the shambling mound attacking Derleth. "Oh, now what...."

Derleth reels backwards. _Right, time to reassess..._ His fingers weave in a proscribed pattern, forming a ward against evil around his person, to protect himself from the behemoth...

Rosalie grins toothily. "Cat's dead. Living heart's dead. Druid's still missing. Welcome back." She looks around. "I'll guard; you magic."

The ground around the combating mound, Derleth and Silniya begins to shift, as the vegetation, like some magnet, pulls towards it. And up it springs, a circular wall that looks like nothing more then a hedge of thorns, as high as the Mound. It turns its' attention to the hawk and Silniya, lashing at them both.

Silniya luckily moves out of the way, however the Eagle is not so fortunate. It is firmly smacked, sending it into a nearby tree.

Silniya snarls, feeling trapped, looking from side to side. "A little help here!" She calls, rolling under the thing and stabbing in a whirl of blades beneath.

The mound simply squats down, starting to almost sit on her, restricting her movements, and one leg swivels in, knocking the swords from her hands as they stick into the mulch.

Kyrel floats up as the barrier grows around the shambling plant-thing and his colleagues, gaining altitude until he can see it inside the ring. Once more he chants the syllables that summon the green bolts of the magic missile spell, and they rain down on the monstrosity.

Kyrel's bolts of magic blaze down, and splash into the wet, soggy body of the mound. It splutters and gurgles, as bogwater splashes down on Silniya, who isn't exactly pleased with this development.

Rosalie looks torn between Silniya's need of help, and the equally urgent need to guard Kyrel. Oh. Yeah. And that wall of thorns that's separating us. She looks around. It's been to quiet. Somewhere the druid is watching and waiting ... When she hears a sound behind her she turns, holding her blows to see what comes.

Derleth stares at Silniya helplessly. "I'll be with you a moment...just...have...to take care of this..." he grunts, laying hands on himself, breathing more of an effort now...

Derleth's eagle swoops in, and this time, it sinks the huge talons into the mound's top, and Jerks, ripping the compost, making the log that is an arm sag weakly, more of the bile inside leaking out, splashing those below.

Silniya charges in, claiming her swords and rolling out from under the mound. But it comes after her, smacking her in the back and nearly pitching her face first into the thorns. A second strike misses, but as the Eagle starts to lift off, it earns the mound's ire. A vicious smack sends it into the thorny hedge, shredding wing and bird, which dissolves in a puff of conjurational smoke.

The pumping heart bubble rolls after Sil, the tendril snaking after her, and simply missing. However, Rose hears something in the bushes, and spots the wintery elf, her skin looking frosty.

Holding her shortsword straight out in front of her, Rosalie runs straight at the druid, her eyes turning cold and frosty silver. At the last moment, she twists the shortsword viciously, hoping to maximize damage.

And Rose misses. The druid is unearthly fast, imbued still with whatever it is she drank. Up comes her hands, lifting claws having grown from the very nail. "No, sister," She stares just as frigidly back at the elf, as cold as the ice on her skin, as the mark of ice on her hand. "No, sister." She comes at Rose, claws swinging.

Rose dodges the savage slashings, before Milinali hops back, shaking her head. "Strong, Sister life, but I shun you. Death to you, to all of you, you take them!" She mutters, spitting on the back of her hand, as a trio of spines, dripping some liquid sprouts. A backhand swing, the quills launch to Rose, and thankfully miss, to nail into the ground.

Rosalie growls. _This woman is getting on my ... my nerves, dammit._ Her expression turns wintry.

Silniya, getting her barings back, moves in on the mound once more, swinging her longsword in a sharp arch, cleaving through the middle, spilling the contents, earning a sagging from the big thing. However, she's herded it towards Derleth, and it moves to get out of the way, her next two attacks coming up short.

Kyrel gestures and speaks from his vantage point in midair, targeting a pair of flaming bolts of energy on the druidess.

The flame dart leaps at Milinali, scoring across her side and earning an angry shriel. It doesnt' seem to do much to her, but Derleth and Silniya watch as the bloody bubble bursts into flames, leaving the remnants of the drow's heart, charred.

The second shaft of flame hits near her feet, extinguishing itself in the forest litter.

Rosalie sheathes her sword in her gloves, her other hand already formed into a claw, as she jumps the druidess. Her hair flows behind her, her eyes wild, as with tooth and claw, she tries to rend the druidess limb from limb.

Rosalie spies, just briefly before she attacks, the scar mark of the flame arrow starts to heal itself. Then she comes in, and the elf plants her palm on Rose's forehead, keeping those teeth off her. One claw nearly draws blood, but is relented off the frozen flesh, the final slash bumping off the druid's viney armor. She backs up, her eyes dead set on Rose. "Even on my level, you'll not have them." The words are full of passion, of hate, of madness. First, her attention snaps to Kyrel. The ice begins to melt off her body, as energy surges to the hand, forming a frozen spear in her hand. This, she hurls, the four trinkets on her bracelet tinkling.

The druid's sudden shift of attention from her immediate attacker back to the half-elf mage catches him by surprise, and the ice spear she throws catches him solidly. He yells, in surprise and pain.

The spear is sharp and painful, and utterly, utterly cold, sticking out of the mage's lower abdomen. Milinali glares back at Rose, stepping back a moment, and begins to sing. The woman can feel the strenght start to leech from her, as the world grows slower, as her reflexes deaden. Milinali smiles. "Not so strong now Sister. Brother Decay has welcomed me, Father has shown me new tricks, since last you came," She croons, a hand dropping to the scar along her stomach.

Derleth is frozen in a moment of indecision...but he knows that theyshould try not to kill the druid...so he focuses his next attack on the behemoth, negating the ward...thrusting out a pal, he chants the words of power, and searing light spears from his palm towards its target...

The blaze of light streaks in, boring a hole straight through it, and blasting one of the branch arms completely off. It sways, as the contents spill out in a rush, the mound swaggering back, to fall into the thorns, compost shredding as it simply... falls apart, into mulch.

SIlniya looks up. "Kyrel! Get a fly on us! We can't cut or burn this hedge down without taking too long!"

Derleth smiles grimly, satisfied, before turning his attention back to the druidess...

Kyrel lands beside Silniya and Derleth, the ice spear still embedded in his body. He casts the spell of flight on the werewolf. "Only have one.. we'll lift Derleth out between us. Ready?"

Silniya grimaces at the sight of the spear. "As soon as we get you out, you patch him up, Derleth." She puts her arm around the cleric, and flies upward, lifting Derleth into the air. Her and Kyrel move, to put Derleth on the other side of the hedge.

Rosalie growls at the druidess. Her muscles feel unaccustomedly heavy, and by force of will alone does she pull a dagger out of her sleeve and throw it at the woman.

The dagger goes end over end, its' end bounces off Milinali's armor. She blinks, and giggles a little.

Derleth doesn't looks thrilled at being flied out stuf between people grabbing either side of him...but he bears dangling, and tries not to picture himself as a wishbone. Once he has solid ground under him, he lays glowing hands on Kyrel, healing his wounds...

Milinali raises her hands, the existing wounds starting to heal just al ittle more... and she pauses. Glancing over at the carcass of the jaguar, she gasps. "No!" Moving fast to the cat, she kneels, craddling its' head. Rocking back and forth, "Come back, no, come now, please," She whisperse amid the soft chanting of healing.

The wounds close, atleast the most horrid on the cat's back. It doesn't look like it will be fighting any time soon, but the eyes half open. She strokes its' head, cooing softly, before turning back to Rosalie. Her body begins to twitch, hair growing everywhere, before starting to mold, to take form. High, higher, before glaring at Rosalie is an enormous brown bear, shocked through with white fur. However, something good does seem to happen; the speed which was inherit in every motion of the elf is now gone.

Rosalie blinks, a look of extreme fear crossing her face. Or possible worry. Or something ... muscles too tired ... to shift.

Silniya gets a better grip on her weapons, and simply nods to Derleth and Kyrel, before lowering her head, and rushing ahead. Instead of immediately charging the bear, however, she halts infront of Rosalie, a glance over her shoulder. "Get back, get something to hit her where she can't reach you."

Kyrel takes to the air again after a quick nod of thanks to the cleric, the lightning wand still ready in his hand. He speaks the command word as Silniya and Rosalie draw back, sending a sheet of blue-white energy washing over the form of the bear.

The electric blaze spits fire at the urison, fur standing on end, as the lumbering beast hasn't the most quick of reflexes. A bit of smoke rises off of her, head shaking, eyes looking a little wild, as the powerful body comes down on four legs, a growl tearing from her throat loud enough to split the trees.

Rosalie shakes her head, muzzily. "Can't ... too slow ... flank her, Sil." She pulls out a dagger, carefully, from her sleeve, and throws it at the bear at full force. _Only one of these left ... after that, I suppose I start throwing swords._

The dagger is swatted out of the sky like an annoying gnat, an enormous paw sending it skidding off into the brush. She starts forwards, menacingly, at Silniya, who's response is to raise her hackles, swords ready.

Derleth hesitates momentarily, trying to figure out what to do next...and then, flail in hand, he moves up behind the weakened Rosalie, muttering to Lliara under his breath...laying a hand on her back, he tries to impart holy strength to replace that drained from her before...

And the druid charges. It's all a blur, the rumbling wall of flesh, a huge paw lifting, as it nears the gaggle of people. Silniya pounces inward, having been waiting, her sword swinging underneath the bear and cleaving into her chest. A thunderclap of outrage and pain emits from the druidess, while her paw slams down onto Silniya, who rolls with the blow, easily coming back to her feet. The bear drops, partially, but the wound creepingly closes around the edges, the blood stopping.

The bear jerks her head back towards Silniya, starting to get on two legs, coming to full hight, lifting one arm up and the lycanthrope hits her dead on, a whirlwind of steel and savagery. A slice, a stab, the weapon twisted and burned into the skin, before the last hacks straight to the bone into Milanali's hindquarter. Like an avalanche of fur and muscle, the bear falls, clawing at the ground, curling into a fetal position as the fur and mass melts away, fleeting out like a candle whipped in the wind. The elf is soon there, coiled around herself, weeping amid the pain.

Derleth eyes the fallen druidess warily, unsure what to do from here...they're supposed to question her, but how will they manage that? This is no weak willed Zhentarim that can be encouraged to betray his superiors...

Silniya's features become her human form, and she still looks torn, despite some restraint. Her swords, still stained and bloody, could so easily just plunge down... But the druid knows something. And... pity? Is that what's in her expression?

Meekly, face smeared with blood and tears and dirt, Milanali looks up towards Rosalie. "Why?" She croaks out, in a tiny voice.

Derleth snorts, looking around at the carnage she had wrought before they even showed up. _She dares ask that?_ But he does not say that aloud. It's possible, insane as she is, that she would not understand. _How can one try a person for a crime when they don't even realize what they've done?_

Rosalie looks down at the druidess. "Truce?" Her eyes are cold and narrowed, and her hands balled up in fists.

Kyrel floats down from the air, wondering what the druid is actually perceiving. _Why, indeed. I'll let the ladies talk to her for now - they may be able to get through to her._

The bleeding has stopped, but she certainly looks like she's in no condition to keep up the fight. There's fear, and sorrow, and pain as deep as oceans written in her face. "How could you ask that... sister?"

Rosalie looks intently at the druidess. "Sister?" Her breath catches, as she looks the druidess over carefully, before dropping to her knees before the woman. She places both hands on the woman's shoulder in a grip that is not tight, but can tighten in a moment's time. "Sister. No sister of mine would slaughter so in health; mother would not allow it." She shakes her head, slowly. "A truce I offer. A simple truce. And a healing."

She shrinks away from Rosalie like she were a leper. "No," She says, fresh tears welling. "How could you take them, sister life? How?" The druid almost coils in herself, holding her stomach, the scar peeking through her fingers. "How could you take them, before they even had a chance at the world? Why?"

Rosalie follows the druidess. "Wait, sister. Wait." She looks up at Silniya, not wanting to break eye contact too long, hoping that Silniya will call Derleth forward. Then she again makes eye contact with the druidess. "Who was taken, sister? Who was lost?"

Derleth doesn't understand, looking at the shrinking druidess. He's not sure he wants to. "I can't heal her of her madness." he says to no one in particular. He wonders about those killed here. If the drow was of Lloth's get, or a follower of Elistraee.

Silniya looks like she has a sinking suspicion, looking over at Derleth almost helplessly. Milanali shivers just a little. "My children." Tears begin to trail down her face. "You took them... you and the earth... the rocks, they fell, the earth slid..." She hides her face from Rosalie, unable to look. "Father found me, he and Brother Decay, they hate you..."

Kyrel drops down to the ground to stand beside the cleric. "We can try to figure out where it came from, though. See the scar on her belly? She lost a child, or children, I think. The shock broke her mind."

+++Edit: Reverse those two.

Rosalie wraps her arms, lightly, around the druidess, rocking her gently. There's something incongruous in the sight of these two women, both covered in blood, now leaning together, but ... "I don't hate you, sister. I ... I grieve for your children. Did you ... were you able to say goodbye?" She shakes her head, a tear running down her own cheek. "Were you able to tell them you love them?"

Silniya shakes her head, moving aside with Kyrel. "Some druids believe so strongly in the transition of life and death, that sometimes birth is a monumental thing, a blessing. Elves are in tune with nature, and elves don't exactly have children all that often. She would have felt it so deep..."

"No..." She buries her face in Rosalie's shoulder, her body shaking. "I fell, the rocks... I woke, and they wern't alive inside me..." She clings to Rosalie tightly.

Kyrel nods. "Of course. I'm not that surprised, actually. I wonder if we can fix her..."

Derleth winces...he does not draw close. Part of him doesn't want to feel her pain. But is it because of what she did...or that it might be too much for him to bear? He moves away, then, intent on burying the dead.

Rosalie holds the druidess tightly, one arm around her shoulder, and slides the other around and under her knees. Slowly straightening, she holds the woman cradled in her arms, and turns to look at the others. "Derleth, do you know a prayer for the dead? There is ... " She looks down at the sobbing woman, and holds her closer. "There is mourning that needs to be done. And not here." She looks around at the bodies. "Not here."

Many of the dead are buried, partially or no, the plants and ground themselves having sucked them in. Others are trapped like broken puppets on strings. There are some living, however, though certainly unconcious by this point. Silniya can only follow Derleth, taken to silence.

Milanali is much like a child in Rose's hands, weak and crumpled and scared. "Have you come to take me, too?" She whispers.

Derleth nods absently in response to Rose's question...partially buoyed by the fact that some of the druidess's captives are yet alive, putting them aside and checknig their vitals...

Breathing. That's a good sign. Some have been tortured, there are welts, and wounds that look like clamps have been put on them, in some areas. Others have lost circulation in a limb here or there to the point it needs to be amputated. A few elves, drow or not, still live, a troglodyte here, a Zhent soldier, too, from the looks of him.

Rosalie easily holds the woman close, and moves out of the glade into the trees beyond. "No, little sister. I do not seek your death. I seek your life." Once in the shadows of the trees, she pauses, uncertain where to go. This is not the time, or the place, to question the druidess about her victims, and yet to go off alone ... She sighs, and leans against a tree, adjusting the druidess in her arms. "Tell me about your babies, sister. Together we will sing them to peace."

"A girl," She says weakly, almost... tiredly, like so much weight has been upon her mind. "I know, I was told by another, a healer's touch... And a boy, Father said, after he had helped me..." Her head bowed, eyes squeezed tight.

Rosalie nods, holding her close. "Twins. What did you name them, sister?"

Derleth grimaces, and gets to work saving lives...doing the grim work where it is needed, binding wounds, and carrying out amputations in cases where magical healing will not suffice. treating all equally, despite who they might be in life.

Kyrel quietly sends Kiri back to the High Sentry duty, listening to Rosalie and the druidess but trying to stay out of the elf's immediate view. _I wonder who her father is...?_

"I hadn't given them names, yet; they had not yet come to the world. They were waiting..." She swallows. "Father is going to be angry..."

Rosalie shakes her head at the druidess in her arms. "No; Father won't be angry. And if he is, sister, we will face him together ..." She smiles, sadly. "We shall name them, now, then. Names are ... are important. It gives us a way to remember. And mourn." She holds the woman a little closer. "Shall we name the girl for her mother, and the boy for his father?"

Silniya helps Derleth set with the dirty work, keeping herself quiet and distracted. _I can't blame her, she... it must have been horrible._ The woman can only simply keep close to Derleth.

Milanali looks out over the forest. "I do not want to face Father," She says, quietly. "Not until he's young again... He's angry, and ugly, now..." A look upwards. "Tisanil... and..." A pause. "Your name, sister? Do... do you have one?"

Rosalie looks down at the druidess. "Rosalie ..." She smiles. "Named for the roses my father loved. And you, sister. What name do you use?"

"Milanali..."

Rosalie nods. "Tisanil we name for his father?" She looks up, hoping Kyrel is listening in, although hopefully not too obviously. "We could name her Mina? It means 'friend' in an ancient tongue. One that uses short words for important concepts, like love, and friendship, and ... " She looks down, waiting.

"Life?" She adds, in a hoarse voice. "Mina... is good," She murmurs. The wounds have become slightly less severe, but she still doesn't look like she could even walk under her condition.

Rosalie nods, hugging the woman. "Yes. Life, like love, is very important. We will mourn for Tisanil and Mina, who were born before they were ready, and died before they were born. We will give their names to the earth, and the wind, and waters, sister, and we will give them a new life. We will tell tales of them. Although ..." She pauses, looking down at Milanali. "Many of the tales will be of their parents. Will you tell me of yourself, Milanali? And of the father?"

"I... don't know," She murmurs, looking off. "I have... other children. The ones that were with me... The plants, the..." She closes her eyes. "I'm tired, sister. I'm hurt..."

Rosalie holds the woman close. "Don't fall asleep, Milanali. Tell me of Father. If I am to keep you safe, I must know what I'm guarding you from." She looks the woman in the eyes. "And I _will_ guard you. I will guard your children. You're safe, now."

"Father... he's looking for help, here..." Her eyes close. "The fairies, the dryad... They will help him. Father is sick, and he... he needs cured, and they will help. It's why he's here. Because Brother Decay makes him sick."

Derleth concentrates on his sometimes bloody work. He tries not to listen to the druidess's words as she talks to Rose.

Rosalie nods at the druidess. "How is he sickened, Mila? What ails him?" She looks back at the glade. "Were you trying to cure him?"

"His temper, his body, his... soul. He will melt away, before long... Brother Decay is dangerous, sometimes..." She trails off, looking back at the grim work Derleth is slowly trying to clean up. "I was helping... The forest doesn't like Father, or Brother Decay. Father needs protection. He's hiding, now, but soon will go for the cure..."

Rosalie shakes the druidess lightly. "Treated like this ... how can you blame the forest." She shakes her head at the woman in her arms. "We cannot heal by blighting; it's like adding rot to wound. Soon you start losing entire limbs." She looks up at Kyrel, eyes hooded, asking him if the party will commit to this woman, or if she'll stand alone.

Kyrel nods to Rosalie. "What is needed for the cure?"

Rosalie looks down at Milanali. "How do we cure him, sister mine?"

She swallows, looking off. "The Unseelie," She whispers the word with every bit of fear that a being can hold.

Silniya stands up, at that.

Rosalie straightens up, holding the woman close. "Oy veh ..." She looks up at Kyrel. "What did we just bite off?"

Silniya looks shaken, now, walking towards Rosalie and Milanali.

Derleth absently notes that the victims are probably the only ones he can fix here...the twisted foliage is beyond his ability to affect. His armor is caked with blood, mostly others, not his. He considers conjuring water to wash himself off, and then notices the perterbed state of the others.

Kyrel pales at that word. "The Unseelie are _here_? Or only they can cure what's wrong?" At Rosalie's look, he explains quietly. "They are ... distorted Fey, really. Nightmares in demi-human form, they live outside our world but try to break in and destroy it."

Derleth sighs as he listens to what is going on. "Lovely."

Rosalie looks down at the woman, and then over her shoulder, back at the glade. "They ... they certainly have spawned enough horror already." She smiles, grimly. "And now we have some torment of our own to dish out. Derleth; how fare the people in the glade? How long until we can go to face her father?"

"Father has to bring one forth... And then they will heal him... Brother Decay loves them, and they him... They are family..." Milanali says.

Kyrel catches Rosalie's eye, and shakes his head.

Kyrel says, "Perhaps we can help. Where are they now?"

Derleth nods. "I'm pretty much done here...I've done what I can."

"I need ... we need to know more to help, Milanali. Will you tell us about Father?" Rosalie looks down at the woman, concern warming her eyes.

Milanali shivers. "Father loves me... He needs my help..." She closes her eyes. "He's hiding, right now. You will help him?"

Kyrel says, "We will do what we can..."

Derleth looks at the others. "I hope we're not going to go to fast. We coupld probably use a chance to replenish my spells."

Rosalie pulls her cloak forward, wrapping it around the druidess for warmth. "I will. We will. But we need more information, sister dear. We cannot walk, blindly forward, and hope to help. We need to know who, and what, he is. And where. And sister mine, I need to know what I must protect you from, if he's going to be angry."

"There... there is a tree, beside the Unicorn Run, near a place..." She squints, trying to recall. "A... valley, where silver bell flowers grew. So pretty..." Silniya moves forward. "Was there antyhing else you can tell ... sister of the area?" "The river was full, by the tree, deep. In the valley, there was a spring..." Silniya's eyes flash. "I know the place."

Derleth tries to picture the map in his mind. "That's a ways away too, isn't it?"

Rosalie nods at Silniya, and looks back at the glade. "Will they be able to heal themselves, Derleth? Or should we pause and nurse them to somewhat better health overnight?"

Derleth shakes his head. "I already spend some healing magic on them. They should be fine."

Milanali looks back. "Not... too far, no? Maybe a day..." She looks into the forest. "I ran along with the trees, I don't... remember."

Rosalie nods, shifting Milanali up a little in her arms. "Well, gentlemen, Sil, shall we be off? We can walk for a ways yet before nightfall, camp, and get there by daylight tomorrow."

Derleth nods. "Hold on a moment...I want to try and wash some of the blood away. Someone help me move the wounded..."

Silniya pauses. "Should we try to get ahold of Sessis? Should we do this alone, or get more help?"

Kyrel says, "If we're going to try rescuing someone, we should probably try it on our own."

Rosalie looks back at Silniya. "Perhaps Sessis can help the wounded, here. I don't like the idea of leaving them to fend for themselves."

Kyrel says, "That's a good point...."

"I would think," Sil musses, "Sessis and everyone around would want to take action, greased with blood..."

Derleth moves the wounded and then calls forth some pure water, bathing himself and the ground in the crystal clear shower.

Kyrel says, "Which is why I'd rather present them with a _fait accompli_ rather than have them help right now."

Rosalie sighs. "Can we convince her that blundering about will not help?" She looks back at the glade. "Then again, given our instinctive reactions ... Better not to involve her, I suppose. Not yet."

By the time the wounded have been sorted, given some meaning of food, the respect for the fallen gone, the horses reclaimed, they begin to set out. "Who goes there?" Calls a voice from a tree.

Rosalie looks up at the voice. "I do."

From the tree eases an aging man, cloaked by the skins of the forest. He relaxes to the earth, looking back and forth. "I feel great pain, here. What has happened?"

If the mood wasn't so solemn, Derleth might laugh at Rose's response.

\*\*\*\*\*\*Switch last two poses.

Kyrel says, "Many things, and not all of them pleasant." He nods in Milanali's direction and lowers his voice. "The druid was grieving for her lost children and seems to have let something unnatural into the forest. We are tracking it down and trying to cure her sorrow."

Rosalie holds Milanali tight in her arms. "The Unseelie ride. We go to unhorse them." She looks grim. "Behind us we leave wounded we cannot tend; will you tend them?"

Alarm races across the man's face like a stampeed. He looks to the druid, before back, and simply nods. "I will do what I must, to nurse the ache in life here." The very air almost sings as he moves at a quick pace towards the way, almost lopping along.

Derleth looks a little relieved as the druid leaves. "Well, that fixes one problem, at least." he murmurs. "And we didn't have to explain ourselves overmuch."

"Shamans always know the feel of the spirits," Milanali says to herself, into the cloak.

Rosalie looks down at Milanali, in her arms. "Who was he, sister?"

"I do not know... Simply another. A speaker to the beyonds."

And onto the trail they go. Silniya knows the way, though it takes her some time to make sure she's on track. It's past sundown, when they reach the Unicorn Run river, however Silniya assures that they are quite a ways downstream from their destination. With spells lacking, all decide to settle in for the night, before the trouble ahead.

Rosalie carefully climbs off her horse, and places Milanali up against a tree. "Don't move, sister. Let us make camp." Quickly, she tends to her horse, before turning back to the druidess with a blanket. Lifting the woman up tenderly, she wraps the blanket around her, and then settles down against a tree, holding the woman in her lap. "I can stand most of the watches, Kyrel, while my sister sleeps."

Kyrel nods to Rosalie. "I think we'll help out, though, regardless. This is dangerous territory."

Rosalie nods. "I appreciate that." She pulls the blanket closer. "And this one will sleep. I think she needs some sleep ..." She sighs, shaking her head. "I do not think I like this ... brother."

Milanali seems rather compliant. Infact, not long after, settling into Rosalie's lap, the elf seems to simply zone out. Not exactly sleeping, but not awake, staring off into nowhere.

The night goes relatively calm, or atleast, as calm as it will be. After five hours or so of Milanali's trance, she stirs, and simply wishes to sit upon the ground.

Rosalie smiles, propping her up against a tree of her own. "We ... need a little more time to recharge, Mila. Or rather, they do. While they sleep, will you watch with me?"

"I will wait, sister... I simply wish to think..." She says, crossing her legs beneath the tree, her fingers carressing its' roots.

Rosalie nods, settling down, her eyes straying back to the druidess regularly, as she listen and watches ...

Milanali seems to go into another trance, or quiet meditation. For the moment, the woman seems at peace, or calm, atleast.

And all rise. The morning is spent with preperation, the coming time likely a very harsh one. And then it is set out. It's nearly mid day by the time they grow close. "It should be just over that slight Hill," Announces Silniya.

Rosalie halts, and climbs off her horse. "Shall we reconnoiter?"

Derleth nods in reponse. He's troubled. He asked for a spell that would snuff out the life of another with a single touch that morning...he hopes he'll not have to use it.

Milanali looks down from Rose's horse, but doesn't say anything.

Kyrel prepares his own spells in silence. He's taking more combat spells than he usually does.

Rosalie hands the horse's reins to Silniya. "Watch her?" she whispers, before pulling her cloak around her. She looks around, once, then fades into the shadows, moving closer to the top of the hill, crouched low.

Silniya takes the reins, her eyes on the druid warily. She doesn't trust the woman, despite the sympathy she has. There's no telling what could set her off, and a druid is something to fear within their element. One hand raises, carressing the pendant about her neck, closing eyes briefly. _Unseelie? Gods. If just one is freed..._

Rosalie crests the hill, and peers further on. The ways ahead is quiet. No animals stir, but it doesn't look to have been blighted, either. But, what is being looked for is obvious: a gnarled tree sits on the riverbank, its' leaves long since gone, the twisted skeleton of bark reaching into the air amid the stilled light.

Rosalie looks down at the tree, her eyes narrowed. _An interesting Father ..._ She moves back, slowly, still taking care to remain hidden, and works her way back to the party. "If I am not mistaken, the Father is a tree, gnarled and withered. Silniya, will you come, with me, to see?"

Derleth casts a couple spells now...one to protect himself against instant death spells such as the one he prayed for...and the second to, once again, protect himself from spells that would hamper his movement. After consideration, he also casts a spell to make Sil stronger, with her permission.

Derleth says, "Wait a minute, Rosalie..."

Rosalie turns to look at Derleth. "Yes?"

Derleth goes over to her and gives her a platinum ring. "I want you to put this on."

Silniya calls over, "Derleth, save any spells that may be spent soon, simply in case."

Rosalie eyes the ring, curiously. "What does it do, Derleth?"

Derleth smiles. "It's actually a focus for a spell. And it lasts for ten hours, so we may as well cast it now." He murmurs a prayer to Lliara as he puts on a mate to the platinum ring, and both glow for a moment. "There, now we're linked. I will take part of any damage you suffer."

Rosalie smiles back, sliding the ring on her finger. "A kindly thought, if ... hazardous to your health." She sighs, eyeing the hill. "I wish I knew more of forestcraft, Silniya."

Derleth shakes his head. "Not at all. I can easily heal myself. Where I might have difficulty healing you, in the middle of battle."

Silniya glances back. "What is it, what did you see?"

Rosalie says, "I saw an old, gnarled tree, Silniya, that looks mostly dead." She looks at Milanali. "And I think that tree might be the Father she describes. Perhaps a tree spirit?"

A shake of the druid's head. "Under the tree," She explains.

Derleth arches a brow. "Strange."

Rosalie turns again, to look at Milanali. "What do you mean, sister?"

"The tree, it's opened up to Father. He said he'd be under it." She points.

Rosalie turns to look at Silniya. "Do you understand?"

Silniya simply shrugs. "It's worth a look?"

Rosalie nods. "Together?" She turns to the men. "Will you watch from the crest, with Milanali?"

Kyrel nods. "Of course."

Rosalie and Silniya move out, then, taking pains to be quiet and unseen. Silniya circles about, before approaching the tree. After circling it, she moves a yard from the dead trunk, inspecting the ground. "Odd."

Rosalie backs up to give Silniya room. And cover. She nocks an arrow on her bow. "Odd?"

"Yes... I saw some disturbances in the dirt, like someone's been digging. And it's that way here, too." She reaches forward, stroking the dirt, lifting it a touch. A gentle press inward, and there is a depression. "Hm." Backing up, the woman finds a fist-sized rock. "Brace yourself."

Rosalie moves to stand so that the depression lies between her and Silniya. _Flanking. A tricky skill to master ..._ "I'm braced."

Silniya nods to Rose, and hefts the rock, before throwing it firmly; Derleth's spell having helped out most definetly. The rock smacks the dirt, and disappears as a hole caves in. Gaping in the ground is, by the looks of it, a burrowed tunnel.

Rosalie waits, cautiously, to see if anything will pop out.

If something is, it is obviously reluctant; nothing is spotted, or heard coming from the burrow.

Rosalie moves forward a little, peering down uncertainly.

Darkness holds the tunnel like air in a hole. But to Rose's eyes, she can pierce down into the bowels of the tunnel. Nothing down there seems stirring.

Rosalie sighs, looking at Silniya. "Do we go down?"

She glances back, considering. "I'm not sure. We'd have to go in one at a time, if nothing else."

Rosalie sighs rather more pointedly. "I think we need to get some more answers from sister dear."
