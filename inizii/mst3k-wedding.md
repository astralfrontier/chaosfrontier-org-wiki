_<CH 3> The man nods. "As a cleric, sir. You see ..." The younger person tugs on his arm and whispers something into his ear. He nods, and continues. "Our families are embroiled in a feud, sir. If we're seen ..."_

_<CH 3> Derleth arches an eyebrow, his interest piqued in spite of his irritation. "Say on..."_

Bill says, "On!"

Mutsumi says, "Off?"

_<CH 3> The young man shrugs. "If we're seen, they'll separate us. We've ... we've run away. But we beseech thee, sir, to marry us. Maria fears traveling with me unmarried will damage my reputation."_

_<CH 3> The short figure nods its head vigorously._

Mutsumi says, "And if I touch her her father will damage something else.."

Mutsumi says, "So wait.. did you say your name was Romeo?"

Mutsumi makes shadows against the screen as if she were trying to look up the short figure's robe..

_<CH 3> To say Derleth is flabbergasted would be an understatement. He's taken completely off guard. "Uh...I'm not certain I would be the best choice for this...I'm a Luckbringer...one of Lliara's eyes and fists....not a High Father. Would it not make more sense to go to the temple?"_

Bill says, "don't worry, sir, we intend to get lucky soon as you're done!"

Bill says, "should we go to the temple for that?"

_<CH 3> The taller shakes his head. "We can't! We tried but ... her brothers ... we can't!" The smaller tugs on his arm, again whispering in his ear. "We would be honoured, sir, if a hero such as you were to marry us. Tonight. We sail on the morning tide."_

Mutsumi says, "Aren't you going to at least use a boat?"

_<CH 3> Derleth's face and mouth twitches. "Ah....here? An alleyway is not the most appropriate place..." he murmurs, stalling for time as he tries to think..._

Bill says, "Yeah. An alley's only one notch above the Elvis Chapel. Come on!"

Mutsumi says, "My friend got married at the Elis Chapel :P"

Mutsumi says, "Elvis, even."

Mutsumi says, "They have a cash register right outside the chapel."

Mutsumi says, "And on the receipt it says: Thank you! Come again!"

Mutsumi says, "Disturbing. Eerie."

Mutsumi says, "I hope someone else in the party is a caterer."

Mutsumi says, "We would be honored to have a hero like you cater our wedding!"

Mutsumi says, "Since Jesus is booked and all."

Mutsumi says, "Yeah, yeah, I know where THIS is going. You'd be honored to have a hero like me pay for your honeymoon!"

_<CH 3> The man shakes his head. "Maria was hoping you'd consent to marry us in a little shrine. It's discreet, and never locked."_

Mutsumi says, "Just like her bedroom!"

Bill says, "This could get difficult with a Jewish cleric. 'Sir, we are in dire need of a circumcision for our baby!' 'Let me draw Anduril, my trusty longsword!' 'Perhaps later!'"

Mutsumi says, "Well, it'd be better than 'Let me draw Anduril, my trusty mace!"

_<CH 3> Derleth purses his lips. "Where is the shrine?"_

Mutsumi says, "It's in my pants!"

_<CH 3> "It's a little Sunite shrine, by the Walls." The man's entire posture radiates hopefulness, and the shorter radiates joy._

Bill says, "Given that this is D&D, can we expect random monster encounters in the chapel?"

Bill radiates electrons.

Mutsumi watches the DM closely, "You have just encountered five Elvii. Their leader says, "How's it goin', man?

_<CH 3> Derleth hesitates, and then gestures urgently. "Go there, now. I will need some things...I will meet you there in one hour."_

Mutsumi says, "He's lost! I saw him hesitate!"

Mutsumi says, "And what's with that gesture? Jeez!"

Mutsumi says, "I will meet you there in one hour. Don't wear anything.. complicated!"

Mutsumi wonders if the rest of the party has been bored to death or what. ;)

Bill says, "Look, I see where they're going! Lodrach, the God of Efficiency, maintains a combination wedding chapel/hotel in this very town!"

_<CH 3> The shorter seems a-teem with delight, and murmurs to the taller. He nods. "I know," Turning back to Derleth, "This is one of Sune's holidays. The priest who cares for the Shrine is away, to celebration elsewhere. Maria feels it's fitting, wed on this day, there, but we would be honored to be wed by you."_

Bill says, "Right, my fiancee wants you to break into an unoccupied temple of a foreign diety and marry us."

Mutsumi says, "Did I mention how honored we'd be to have a hero like you loot the temple and give the proceeds as wedding gifts?"

_<CH 3> The two stay close together, hurrying down the alleyway, after the taller assures Derleth that they'll be there in one hour exactly._

Mutsumi says, "And if we're early, you can cut off my left testicle!"

Mutsumi has no idea where that came from.

Bill says, "Thank goodness our backwards Dark Ages fantasy world has flawless timekeeping."

_<CH 3> Derleth smiles kindly, feeling obscurely honored. "Then go, now, and do not stop for anything, young lovers! I will meet you there anon, where you shall become one!" /Bright Lady, did I just \*say</\* that??/_

Bill says, "Become one what?"

Mutsumi says, "I will meet you there anon? What, he's coming incognito or something?"

_<CH 3> The taller looks back, nodding decisively, and then the two disappear from sight._

Mutsumi says, "Damn, they bosun jumped!"

_<CH 3> Once he's sure they're away, he wanders back out of the alley. /Bright lady, please bless them...they will need all the luck they can get./ he starts looking around for the others, his pipe forgotten in his left hand as he slings his flail back into its hangar._

Mutsumi says, "I hate it when I leave my pipe imbedded in my left hand."

_<CH 3> By now, the group has eventually migrated outside, onto the steps of the theatre._

Mutsumi says, "His flail has it's own hangar, too. Damn, he really must be a hero."

Bill says, "Flail, you're clear on Runway 23. slightly cloudy weather."

_<CH 3> Kyrel is just about to send Kiri to hunt for the missing cleric when he comes back out of the alley. "There you are. Have to take a leak?"_

Mutsumi says, "Waah waaah waaaah"

Bill says, "Don't great heroes only take leaks in heroic places?"

_<CH 3> Derleth gives Kyrel this mysterious look. "Tamlin...might we commandeer your carriage for a small side trip?"_

Mutsumi says, "We'd be honored to have a great hero like you take a leak in our cesspool."

Mutsumi says, "Oohhh, the mystery look!"

Mutsumi says, "You know what's on his mind."

_<CH 3> "Ah... certainly," He replies. A curious look takes the nobleman. "Whereto?"_

Mutsumi says, "Might we commandeer your carriage for a little 'side trip'... ignore the way it rocks.."

_<CH 3> Rosalie looks intrigued. "Yes, sir, whereto?_

Bill says, "I'm goin to Disneyland!"

_<CH 3> Derleth coughs at the attention. "To the Lliaran temple...and from there, to the Sunite shrine where we first met you. I've been...ah...asked to wed two star-crossed lovers."_

Bill says, "and I said yes! OOOOH!"

Mutsumi says, "Wait a minute, isn't that illegal in this kingdom?"

_<CH 3> Anya gives a slight chuckle. "Well..." Tamlin nods his head. "I think that could be arranged, yes. Would you like us to attend? Or simply take our carriage to your business? My sister and I can be off..." The nobleman smiles towards Rosalie. "Even if I did care to say goodnight, at the Inn."_

_<CH 3> Rosalie smiles at Tamlin, and bows her head. "We shall surely meet again, sir, and make proper goodbyes."_

Bill says, "in the meantime.. get the hell out!"

Mutsumi says, "If you know what I mean."

Mutsumi says, "Yeah, he wanted to say good night at the inn, alright, but when you are shit-faced and playing pissing on the peasants, these pleasantries escape you.."

Mutsumi says, "So wait.. he goes in an alley and suddenly two people want to marry him?"

Bill says, "must be some alley."

Mutsumi says, "Those clerics sure are lucky ;)"

_<CH 3> Anya leans forward, then, and offers a light kiss to Kyrel's cheek. "Thank you for the evening, Kyrel," She offers, before drawing toward one of the carriages. "Goodnight to you, Rosalie," He prompts, before following his sister, but draws towards the coachman to the other._

Mutsumi says, "That's not all she's offering, leaning like that! o.o"

Mutsumi says, "We'd be honored to play swallow the swan with a hero like you."

_<CH 3> Rosalie grins, blowing a light kiss to Tamlin. "A fair night!"_

_<CH 3> Derleth considers. "Actually, I would like you both present..in part because they are of noble birth, and deserve to have witnesses of the same stock. Plus...it would not hurt to have one of Sune's faithful present."_

Bill says, "In case Sune's priest shows up to kick us out"

Mutsumi says, "That counts us out!"

Mutsumi says, "Sune? That prick! He still owes me five wishes."

Mutsumi says, "What's noble birth, caesarian section?"

_<CH 3> ++Editor: Delete the two lines before Derleth's last comment._

Bill says, "that's a Julius Caesarian"

_<CH 3> "Two, actually," Anya offers forth, with a smile. "Well then, surely," Tamlin interjects. "Shall we be off, then?"_

Mutsumi says, "What did he say?!"

Bill says, "Give me Pascal! Forth sucks!"

_<CH 3> Only a short time was spent at the Lliaran House of Commerce, long enough for Derleth to get the needed literature, and recieve a few tips from an older priest, before the carriages make their procession to the place. Parking the rides a small distance away, the group heads forth. It would seem that Tamlin, followed by Anya slip into an unremarkable crack in the wall, but the young woman waves them to follow._

_<CH 3> Rosalie slips into the crack, smiling in bemusement._

Bill says, "MARRIAGE FOR DUMMIES."

Bill says, "\`make sure she aint pregnant, an that they aint Satanists!'"

_<CH 3> Kyrel smiles. "It's hidden quite well. Interesting place."_

_<CH 3> Derleth remembers this crack from last time. He still wears his armor, but instead of his surcoat, he has draped ceremonial robes over his breastplate, and carries the tools of the ceremoney in his arms._

Mutsumi says, "Now remember, Derleth, when they ask you if it's customary for you take all their worldly possessions, you must say yes."

Bill says, "Priest Caught With Crack - Scandal Rocks Chuch"

Bill says, "Bill Types Like Crap - Not News At All :)"

Mutsumi says, "Hey, since when is a warhammer a tool of the ceremony?"

_<CH 3> The crack leads into a small garden, hidden within the large city wall. Roses, orchids, and a number of other flowers sit, seeming in bloom, shining in the moonlight. The statuette is there, in the center of a fountain, within the center of the garden. At the other end, the couple are there, cloaks removed. Maria waves, her golden hair sparkling in the light of Selune._

Mutsumi says, "That's one big crack."

Mutsumi says, "Hey, they were early!"

Bill says, "This is not Wedscrafters: Religious bonding rituals, in about an hour! I said one hour exactly!"

_<CH 3> A cat brushes itself up against Rose's leg. However, the feline is odd, in that a pair of beautiful, spotted wings sprout from it's back. The tressym purrs, and paws at her shoes._

_<CH 3> Derleth smiles benignly at the two excited lovers. "Take your places by your side, and we shall begin. I have brought my companions to witness your joining."_

Bill says, "oh great, a FLYING cat. It's the end of the world."

Mutsumi says, "Take your places by your side?"

Mutsumi says, "Where else can I be but at my side?"

_<CH 3> Rosalie grins, hunkering down to pat the little feller. Then she places a finger against her lip. "The priest has spoken, little one ..."_

Mutsumi says, "If the guy's name is Tony I'm throwing a flag on this one."

Phil says, "They're Beside themselves with joy..."

_<CH 3> Maria smiles towards Anya and Tamlin, while her soon-to-bewed husband nods to the others. They heed to Derleth's instruction, however._

Mutsumi says, "And when the priest speaks, people fall asleep!"

Mutsumi snores.

Bill says, "'what is your name?' 'Maria' 'And you sir?' 'Captain Georg von Trapp. oh, and these are my kids...' 'I am OUTTA here.'"

Mutsumi says, "Sir, we'd be honored to have a hero like you claim prime' nacht!"

_<CH 3> Derleth pours holy water into a small basin, directing the two to kneel. "Before Lliara's benevolent gaze, do I bring this man and this woman, whose love is so great, the would proclaim it before all, and become one." he begins there ceremony, after which he anoints both with the holy water._

Phil says, "Mawwiage. Mawwiage is what bwingth uth togetha."

Bill says, "if they're proclaiming it to all, Der, why are we doing the ceremony in this hole in the wall?"

_<CH 3> The two youngsters turn to one another, their eyes glowing in the moonlight. They barely heed Derleth, wrapped as they are in their worship of one another._

Mutsumi says, "And now, I need to confirm just how great their love really is. If you will excuse me.."

_<CH 3> Derleth stiffles a chuckle, and goes through the ceremony, waxing on not only the importance of love, but also in the importance of daring all in pursuit of it, and seeking Lliara's blessing to make such a union as this possible. For in seeking the love of another, there is risk, and there are few things more rewarding, if one must risk. Then he guides the two through the vows of love and commitment..._

Mutsumi says, "And then.. the oral sex!"

_<CH 3> Vows they speak easily, turned to one another._

Bill says, "'blowjobs monthly?' 'half your paycheck?' 'deal'"

Mutsumi says, "Vows they break just as easily.."

_<CH 3> Silniya smiles, during the procession, watching Derleth more then the couple themselves._

Mutsumi says, "That saucy whench."

Phil says, "'Have you ever seen The Thorn Birds?'"

Bill says, "'Theres just something about a man in uniform...' 'That is a clerical vestment, honey'"

_<CH 3> Derleth smiles kindly. "Then I declare before these witnesses and before the Bright Lady , that Maria Urnaovskaya and Alexander Jerhain are united in holy matrimony." he proclaims. He gets an amused look in his eyes. "You, ah...may kiss the bride."_

Bill says, "'Who were you speaking to Der?'"

Phil says, "'Maria? I thought I told you, my real name is Butch.'"

_<CH 3> Alexander turns to his new bride, and brushes the hair off her forehead, before leaning down to kiss her lightly on the lips. She wraps her arms around his shoulders, pulling him close for a moment. Then they separate. Alexander speaks, formally, for the both of them. "We thank you, sir. We will treasure this moment always. But, I fear we must make haste, before the morning tide."_

Bill says, "Yes, thanks again, Dilbert.. Delroy.. Dickinson.. what the hell was your name?"

_<CH 3> Derleth folds his hands together. "As you wish...I and my companions will escort you to the dock...and safety."_

_<CH 3> And with that, they depart. Alexander and Maria ride with Derleth and Silniya in a coach, while Rose, Anya, Tamlin and Kyrel head in the other. The docks are relatively deserted, some of the ships still have lights on, amid them. The carriages stop, before the /Sirene's Call/._

Mutsumi says, "Wait a minute.. did she have a toupee on?!"

Mutsumi says, "What about Dopey, Doc, and Sneezy?"

Mutsumi says, "Or was that Balin, Dwalin, Thorin, and Bombur.."

_<CH 3> Derleth removes the robes while he has the opportunity. "That was one of the most interesting moment of my clerical career..." he comments wryly to Silniya as the two lovers exit first._

Mutsumi covers her eyes!

_<CH 3> Looking out at the ship, Rosalie smiles, her cheeks a little warmer. Then she pulls her hood over her head, covering her hair and leaving her face in shadow. /Darn. It would be the Sirene's Call ... /_

Bill says, "... at least it's not the SS Minnow"

_<CH 3> Silniya gazes intently unto Derleth. "Did you mean what you said?"_

Mutsumi says, "That I'd like to see you naked? Yes!"

_<CH 3> Derleth blinks, taken aback. "Uh...by what, exactly? About it being an interesting moment?"_

_<CH 3> The swordwoman makes an idle gesture. "The litany, during the ceremony."_

Mutsumi says, "What, that religious BS? Hah!"

_<CH 3> The two newlyweds bounce out of the coach, Alexander carrying a small purse. Maria turns to Derleth, waiting politely for Silniya to pause. "Sir, we've a small gift for you, as our wedding priest." With that she bestows a small carefully wrapped box on him._

Bill says, "Candid photos of the bride?"

Mutsumi says, "Candid photos of the groom?"

_<CH 3> Derleth coughs nervously. "Well, I did have to relearn the ceremony...but if you're asking if I believe that love is worth any risk...then yes."_

Mutsumi says, "As long as sex is involved, I mean."

Bill says, "'will you risk having four experience levels drained for love?' 'oh fuck no'"

_<CH 3> Silniya then smiles, nodding her head, and sits back satisfied._

_<CH 3> Derleth blinks, taking the box in surprise. "Ah...that's really not necessary, my child...it would be wrong of me to accept a gift in the doing of my duty as Lliara's cleric."_

Mutsumi says, "In less of course it involved a piece of tail."

Mutsumi says, "Unless, rather ;)"

_<CH 3> Maria blushes. "I ... I made it myself. It's not much, but ... I hope you will have pleasure of it."_

Bill says, "it's a plaster mold of.. no, no."

_<CH 3> Derleth considers, and then nods. "I will accept it, then, in the spirit in which you intended." he thanks her._

Mutsumi says, "Woo, and I thought my idea was bad."

Mutsumi says, "It's the old breast implants she had removed?"

_<CH 3> Alexander looks at the ship. "Maria ... I believe we should hurry. The captain did warn us he would not, could not, wait."_

Derleth turns to the thief, 'Get this appraised.'

_<CH 3> Derleth nods. "Go, both of you. be happy in your union." he prompts them._

Mutsumi says, "But, but, we'd be honored to have a hero like you.. 'Shut up!!!!'"

_<CH 3> The two nod, and with a final bow and curtsey, walk to the gangplank. After they board, they wave again._

Mutsumi says, "So which one bowed and which one curtseyed?"

_<CH 3> Rosalie sighs. /Young, foolish, love. I hope they brought funds./ She waves, her hood still pulled forward._

Mutsumi pages, "So high-level D&D is like working at the DMV?" to you.

_<CH 3> Derleth waves back, before drawing the curtain closed. "Young and foolish they are, perhaps, but I wish them well." He looks at the box, then, and decides to open it._

Bill says, "BOOM!"

Mutsumi says, "And that's when the angry bees flew out.."

_<CH 3> Inside, a single pure white lace bookmark lies nestled on dark green tissue paper. The bookmark, in the shape of a strawberry, or perhaps a spade, seems well fitted to lady Luck._

Phil says, "Let's call a Spade a Strawberry..."

Bill says, "it's a metamorphic bookmark!"

_<CH 3> Kyrel has been looking at the ship. He murmurs, "Sirene's Call. That sounds familiar, doesn't it, Rosalie?"_

Mutsumi says, "Yeah, that's the ship Ahab is captain of.."

_<CH 3> Rosalie pulls back into the coach. "Vaguely, Kyrel. Vaguely. I do believe, though, that the night is getting old. Should we not retire soon?"_

Phil says, "'This was not called Execution. It wsa called... retirement.'"

Bill says, "The first vampire Western movie! when the hero rode off into the sunset.. he didn't ride long."

_<CH 3> Kyrel chuckles. "I'm serious, actually. Do you think her captain is honest? Those kids didn't strike me as suspicious enough."_

_<CH 3> Rosalie raises one eye, looking obliquely at Tamlin. "From the little I know of him, he seems honest."_

Mutsumi says, "You know, he has ten fingers and all his teeth, so he can't be that bad."

_<CH 3> Derleth tucks the bookmark into a pouch. "Awful sweet, they were..." He relaxes into the seat. "Not a bad way to end the day." He knocks on the wall of the coach, indicating the driver to take them home._

Bill says, "Sure. he didn't name the ship /Plunder & Booty/ right? He must be trustworthy!"

Mutsumi says, "Then again, he also has the fingers and teeth of other people, so.."

_<CH 3> Tamlin looks at the woman curiously, but doesn't comment. "I'm sure he's trustworthy; Selegaunt doesn't harbor pirates."_

Mutsumi says, "Heck no, we put them out to see where they can do us some good!"

_<CH 3> Rosalie nods. "Indeed. I'm sure they'll be fine. Young, but fine ..."_

_<CH 3> The procession then proceeds home, Anya and Tamllin giving goodbyes to their company, before heading home. Everyone then gets ready for bed, and slips off. Though, the only thing to note would be Kyrel sleeping alone._

Mutsumi says, "Young, but fiiiiiine!"

Mutsumi says, "The procession proceeds."

Mutsumi says, "Which is good, cause otherwise they'd be a recession."

Phil says, "FINE. F\*cked up, Insecure, Neurotic, and Emotional?"

Bill says, "And I just want the American people to know, this isn't a -- we are not in a -- the economy is looking better and better every day, and you know, the more days that pass, the better the economy of today, right now, will look"

_<CH 3> The morning is greeted with a good breakfast in the Inn's main room. Silniya glances to Rosalie. "So, back to the /Saucy Mermaid/ Again today?"_

Mutsumi says, "Man, that Mermaid is always on the sauce.."

_<CH 3> Rosalie nods ... "Yes. The good captain's sailed off into the sunset with our lovebirds, so perhaps this time we'll get a better bite." She drinks her coffee slowly. "Perhaps you should arrive before I do. If we arrive together again, that will look ... suspicious." She smiles. "And a lady like me doesn't like the early morning in any case."_

_<CH 3> Kyrel says, "Fair enough. Maybe this time you should wait for them to approach you... you dropped the code word yesterday enough times..."_

Bill says, "'the'?"

_<CH 3> Rosalie grins. "The fair captain approached me ... But today I'll have coin; I won't be desperate. I can sit by the fire and drink ..."_

_<CH 3> Silniya nods. "It'd be wise to try and avoid getting the wrong fish to take a nibble. Or find the man who we have to say it to."_

_<CH 3> Derleth seems in a rather good mood this morning. "Maybe we should consider different disguises, just in case...."_

Mutsumi says, "I want to dress up like a little girl!"

Bill says, "You be the maid this time, I'll be the horny dolphin!"

_<CH 3> Rosalie awwwws. "I think my disguise just became better after yesterday, Derleth ... And now I can afford to discriminate in my customers. But perhaps ... perhaps it were better if you went in without me?"_

Mutsumi says, "Her customers?! What exactly is she dressing up as?"

_<CH 3> Kyrel says, "Oh, your disguise is solid, Rosalie. No reason we can't go in under different shapes, though. We didn't do anything interesting yesterday."_

_<CH 3> Rosalie grins. "Right. I can tart up again, after I've had a nice long bath. I'll join you there around the noon hour?"_

_<CH 3> Silniya leans back in her seat. "Or, there is another way."_

_<CH 3> Derleth chuckles. "I was jsut referring to the rest of us...obviously, you're the one to watch, Rose."_

_<CH 3> Kyrel glances at Sil. "What do you have in mind?"_

Mutsumi says, "Rimshot!"

_<CH 3> "Well, just to maybe ensure we're not going about it the wrong way, a step by the city's dungeon, to ask the rogues if there are any catches to the password? Rose wasn't approached, yesterday by our man."_

_<CH 3> Rosalie says, "Wouldn't Jamiltn be a better man to ask?"_

_<CH 3> Derleth says, "Likely...the trick is finding the boy."_

Mutsumi says, "Yes, you have to say it while hopping naked on one foot."

_<CH 3> Kyrel says, "Wouldn't trust anyone in the prison to change their story now... they gave it to us under duress in the first place. Unless you have a spell to compel them, Derleth?"_

_<CH 3> Silniya hms, "Or one to check their truth in it."_

Mutsumi says, "Kinky!"

_<CH 3> Derleth purses his lips. "I do have a spell to make them tell the truth in everything they say...but they'll know it's in effect. And it won't compel them to speak, only to tell the truth if they do."_

_<CH 3> Kyrel says, "So we ask them to confirm what they said yesterday, and if they don't.... we still have our answer."_

_<CH 3> "So, to the jail, then?"_

_<CH 3> Derleth nods, leaning back...and letting out a a small moan of pain as he does. "Ah yeah...the jail."_

Bill says, "INSERT CAMELOT SONG HERE"

Bill says, "On second thought, jail is a silly place."

_<CH 3> Rosalie turns to look at Derleth. "A long night?"_

Mutsumi says, "A long day's night?"

_<CH 3> "Well, you know...not every night I do midnight marriages..." Derleth hedges. His face turns beet red, though, as he avoids the question._

Mutsumi says, "Yeah, yeah, well, that wasn't a marriage vow we heard from your bedroom last night, buster."

_<CH 3> Kiri chirrips at his mage, and Kyrel coughs, trying to suppress a smirk. "Be nice."_

Mutsumi says, "And I don't think 'Ooh god oh yes yes yes!' is a proper prayer."

_<CH 3> Silniya looks a little more concerned, toward Derleth, but she doesn't say anything._

_<CH 3> Rosalie smiles at Silniya, and winks. "Perhaps tonight ... a massage?"_

_<CH 3> Derleth refuses to look at Silniya. "uhm...we were going to a jail, right?" he mumbles._

Bill says, "a massage in jail!"

_<CH 3> The swordwoman chuckles. "Would you care to give it to him? I have the coin." She grins goodnaturedly._

_<CH 3> Kyrel clears his throat. "To the jail, I think."_

Mutsumi says, "Last time I got laid on my stomach for someone in jail I ended up more sore than I started!"

_<CH 3> Rosalie grins widely. "I'd be delighted; we'll have those kinks out of him in no time."_

Mutsumi says, "But then, I repeat myself.."

Bill says, "And trust me, he has a lot of kinks!"

_<CH 3> Derleth groans. /I want to die./_

Mutsumi says, "And we want you to, as well."

_<CH 3> The Watch's Dungeon is associated right near the center of town. As the four approach the front door, the pair of Watchmen stand up straight. "Your business?" One calls._

Bill says, "We're unemployed!"

Mutsumi says, "Rimshot!"

Brendan says, "Rimjobs? So you're whores.."

_<CH 3> +++Editor: Make that three._

Bill says, "Three watchmen call at once? what is this, barbershop quartet?"

_<CH 3> Derleth is more composed now that he's not being ribbed anymore. "We desire to speak with some of your...hmmm...tenants."_

Mutsumi says, "Give or take.."

Mutsumi says, "Heheheh, he's not ribbed now. Wooo."

_<CH 3> "Ah." He nods, then moves to the door, opening it up. "Visiting hours end in two, sirs, lady. But, leave all your weapons and components at the front desk, please."_

Bill says, "Feel free to take explosives, cheap ale and whores."

Brendan says, "components? They're lego people?"

Bill says, "'What are you in for?' 'Hes insane. a Lego Maniac.'"

_<CH 3> Kyrel nods. "Of course." /Or we can leave them with Silniya./_

Bill says, "Too bad we don't have Marge Simpson here, we could smuggle in a catapult!"

Mutsumi is too busy giggling at 'components'

_<CH 3> Silniya, as if reading Kyrel's mind, opts to stand by them instead. Still, the two are reduced to a search by a Watch Wizard, briefly questioned about items, while quickly patted down. After that, they're lead down a stairwell, toward the 'short stay' cells. Several knaves are inside, including those whom they ran in, the day before._

Bill says, "Knaves: the new replacement for hamster wheels"

_<CH 3> After they're showed to the cell, the guard walks back up the stairwell._

Bill says, "This is guard walking back up the stairwell.. this is guard walking against the wind... this is guard trapped in a box.."

Mutsumi says, "The stairs leading down.. they also go up?"

_<CH 3> Derleth glances at Ky. "You do the questioning....once I cast the spell, you've got nine minutes. Keep in mind that you won't be able to lie either...or anyone else down here, for that matter." he murmurs quietly._

Bill says, "Dammit, I'm a lawyer! how do you expect me to work under these conditions?"

_<CH 3> Several of the knaves look up, and groan in unison._

Mutsumi says, "Damn, this is a well-organized group of knaves."

_<CH 3> Kyrel gestures to the two thugs they'd been accosted by. "Just need to double-check something, boys. You mentioned Tessa yesterday. Is there anything you left out?"_

Brendan says, "Oh, yeah.. We raped 'er a few time.s Thst didn't seem important."

_<CH 3> Derleth weaves a hand about, casting the spell as Kyrel speaks, and there is a soft glow that falls briefly about the area..._

_<CH 3> Benny's leg seems relatively fine. The foul mouth looks up. "What'd you do wrong?"_

_<CH 3> Kyrel says, "I didn't say we did anything wrong. I'm asking if there was anything you left out. We don't want to give the correct password to be led into a trap, do we?"_

Mutsumi says, "That depends.. are ya stupid?"

_<CH 3> "Well, no. But I gots to ask why you think you can just bounce your happy magical ass down there, and expect to walk out? You ran us in; what makes you think you'll leave, since you know, and he knows, you know where he is?"_

Mutsumi says, "He knows where he is?"

Mutsumi says, "Happy magical ass? Heh."

_<CH 3> Kyrel just smiles. "Because we're a lot smarter than you are. We're asking the questions." He looks over to Benny. "You're not going to say anything?"_

Bill says, "See? that was a question."

_<CH 3> The boy gives a dirty glare at Kyrel. "Did you ask the guy in the corner that looks like he's got a pegleg?"_

_<CH 3> Kyrel says, "That's the person to ask, then? Thank you."_

Mutsumi says, "He only looks like he has a pegleg, though, he doesn't really have one."

_<CH 3> Foul-mouth smirks. "Well, I did tell say the man in the corner."_

_<CH 3> "Is that all you wanted?"_

_<CH 3> Kyrel says, "For now. Thank you, gentlemen."_

Bill says, "nonono, thank YOU"

Mutsumi says, "All your jail are belong to us."

_<CH 3> The party then leaves, and Derleth, Silniya and Kyrel arrive, after properly applying illusions, invisibilities, and so forth, not but three minutes before Rosalie._

Mutsumi says, "Wait, wait.. were they leaving or arriving?"

_<CH 3> Derleth walks up to the bar and gruffly orders an ale, diguised this time as an ill-favored human dockworker...one of the men that services ships in dock._

_<CH 3> He's given the glass by the hard-worn youth behind the bar, rather quickly. The drunk is in his corner, as he was yesterday, this time looking either dazed, or asleep, in his spot._

_<CH 3> Rosalie arrives later, making her way to an empty corner, and ordering gin and stew. She makes a more leisurely meal, projecting an aura of satisfaction, rather than desperation._

_<CH 3> Kyrel follows Derleth, a minute or so behind him. He's again disguised as a sailor, but a different one than the day before. This time he's swarthy and wiry, apparently from the southern regions._

_<CH 3> Derleth gets up from the bar with his drink, moving toward Rose...some how managing a leer as he comes up next to her, as if privately wanting to purchase her...services. "You want the man with the peg-leg, in the corner." he mutters in her ear._

_<CH 3> Unseen, Silniya settles down into the chair next to Kyrel. Seeing as the three wanted to be there before Rose spent too much time, they skipped the prolongued application of makeup, for a quick spell._

_<CH 3> Rosalie nods slightly, then shakes her head. "Nay! I'll not be wastin' my time the likes of you, after the captain!" She puts her drink down, and stands up. "But it's time ..." She walks to the one legged man, sitting down beside him. "A mutual acquaintance suggested I look you up.'"_

Mutsumi says, "He's really one legged, he's not the right one."

Mutsumi says, "He's only supposed to /look/ like he has a pegleg."

_<CH 3> "Nnuh?" A shake of his head, as he sits up a little more coherently. "Hehe. Who's my friend who said so? Nice man... Did he pay allready?" He stuts out a little laugh._

Bill says, "that's not a leg, he's got a peg-....oh dear."

Mutsumi says, "Wow o.o"

Mutsumi says, "Talk about bad luck."

_<CH 3> Rosalie shakes her head. "The mutual acquaintance's a lady, by the name of Tessa. Sent me to ya."_

_<CH 3> Those heavy lids of his seem to tighten, just a little bit. Behind the silly grin is a purposed eyeing, this time. "Gotta love that gal... She knows what's she's doing. So's, you want to go now?"_

_<CH 3> Derleth grumbles and moves back to the bar, mumbling obscenities as he keeps one eye on her._

Bill says, "yes, right here on this table."

_<CH 3> Rosalie tilts her head sideways. "Where, old man?"_

_<CH 3> His smile is wide. "In the alley?"_

Bill says, "man, EVERYONE is scoring in that alley"

Mutsumi says, "You know, it'd be a real honor if a hero like you were to.. SHUT UP WITH THAT, ALREADY!!!"

_<CH 3> Rosalie looks thoughtful for a moment, then sighs. "Very well. Although I always did love privacy more."_

_<CH 3> "We can find privacy, then! I know a good place," he says with a wider grin. Easing out of his chair, the man staggers with that peg leg, before he makes a short little walk to the door._

Bill says, "Eww! he's got visible wood!"

_<CH 3> Rosalie follows the old man slowly, hands on hips._

Bill says, "Conga!"

Bill says, "oh wait, on her own hips?"

Mutsumi says, "I don't know.. I don't think so, though."

_<CH 3> As the man hobbles out, Derleth catches something interesting. At looking at the man's peg leg, a crucial, inspecting eye could notice the 'stump' looks a little... Thick. Eyes follow up to the man's loose coat, where a bulge follows behind him. After another quick eye, the cleric-in-guise realizes that it's actually a well-put trick; the peg leg is actually strapped to the man's knee, and the lower leg is roughly concealed._

Bill says, "he's wearing a strap-on! Get outta there!"

Mutsumi says, "Wow, nice stump!"

Bill says, "thank goodness this isn't New York. All the \`mysterious bulges' you see there are in the dresses of the hookers."

_<CH 3> Derleth notes the falsity with interest...he finishes his drink, and moves over by Kyrel...pretending to tie his boot._

Bill says, "Hey, you strange freak! why are you tying my boot?"

_<CH 3> The chair beside Kyrel lightly scrapes. Rose is lead outside, and around the side of the tavern. There's a narrow alley between the Tavern and another establishment. Peg-leg wobbles down it, before sticking his fingers between two boards, before pulling one sideways, which swings inward, before he pushes the other sideways, exposing a gab between able to be wriggled through. In the earth of the floor within is a dark hole. "Our little nest, love," He says with a leer._

_<CH 3> Derleth tries to get Kyrel's attention. "Should one of us follow?" he whispers as he stands._

_<CH 3> Kyrel murmurs back, "Your girlfriend's on it. I'll follow soon."_

_<CH 3> Rosalie smiles up at the one legged man. "How ... cozy."_

Mutsumi says, "Yeah, that she is!"

_<CH 3> Rosalie looks down the hole, wondering if she's expected to climb down it in this skirt ..._

Bill says, "No, you take the skirt off first."

Mutsumi says, "Waah waaah waaaaaaaaaaah"

_<CH 3> Derleth blushes faintly at the reference, but makes no comment: now is not the time. He finds a seat close by._

_<CH 3> He smacks her on the backside. "In you go." Quieter, "Watch your step; the ground's about four feet down, but the rock's like a step, half way down."_

_<CH 3> Rosalie sighs, and carefully climbs into the hole, holding her skirts close._

_<CH 3> /That whack is, someday, going to cost him ..../ But she continues downwards._

Mutsumi says, "About 5 bucks, at least!"

_<CH 3> He holds the way open, letting what light can flood in, for Rose. The ground above her head gives a little scrape, but the cause is unseen. Once her feet touch ground, a rough, rocky tunnely slope heads down, sea-wards. The rock 'step' issues a slight tap, and there is a relative sound of voices, down the tunnel. Then pegleg shuts the planks, sending the hole into relative darkness. Though, there is light, down the tunnel. Outside, Pegleg just flops down in the narrow alleyway, and lays out, as if he were mugged, or passed out._

_<CH 3> Rosalie looks around, carefully examining the planks above her before shrugging, and continuing on into the passage._

_<CH 3> Rose recieves a slight touch on her shoulder, assuring her Silniya is there, before she begins downward. The tunnel looks natural, if not urged slightly by human hands. It curves slightly, while still heading down, infact turning tight enough to be akin to a spiral-staircase, with a three foot drop off included. But, beyond that dropoff, it opens near the top of a large cavern. Inside, fishnets, barrels, and crates are all about. Mast-canvas seems to cut one section of the room off, and in the far corner, as what seems to be a Bowsprit carved in the likeness of a sahugain, it's bulk pointing straight up into the air. At it's base, a 'throne' constructed from a hodgepodge of crates, and other framework. Off to the side, a dropoff empties right into the water. All around, the room is filled with men (and some women), looking in different states of intoxicated, gambling, and so forth. Not to mention a few that look close to the guise's profession._

_<CH 3> ++Editor: Not Bowsprit, the Figurehead._

_<CH 3> Rosalie stands at the entrance to the room, waiting to be noticed._

Bill says, "Hey! you!"

_<CH 3> And that she is. After a few moments, someone looks up. "Hey!" At that, everyone seems to jump to life. From Rose's position, she's near the ceiling of the cavern. A wooden stairwell leads down to the floor. No immediate exits, or people in high positions appear present, but amid the lantern-light and obvious ship-plunder, many of the knaves within take up some form of precation. One leans at the base of the stairs. "Whatcha want?"_

Bill says, "Unlimited money, free sex, good clothes.."

Mutsumi says, "And beer."

_<CH 3> Rosalie shrugs, tilting her head. "Not you, I'm guessin'. Ole Peg Leg sent me." She looks around, searching out a leader. Then she looks down at the stairwell, and takes a step or two down, testing the wood._

Bill says, "LONG AND HARD"

_<CH 3> It creaks, but holds. "Then come on down, woman!" He calls out, to many a grinning agreement._

_<CH 3> Rosalie grins, stepping slowly down the stairwell. Halfway down, she halts, grinning. Putting hand on hip, and throwing a saucy wink, she challenges the man who leans at the base of the stairs. "So who sits in the throne?"_

Mutsumi says, "Man, they have a toilet in the middle of the room?"

_<CH 3> "That would be me," Replies a firm voice from roughly beneath the staircase. Walking around, rose can see the relative mountain of a man. His blond hair is pulled back, to bare the flat, blockish features of his face. The wardrobe suggests that of a simple, common fisherman, poor-trimmed tunic, leggings, and dock sandles._

Brendan says, "Sounds like a poofter to me."

Mutsumi says, "He's the relative of a mountain of a man?"

_<CH 3> Rosalie says, "Well met, and a pleasure indeed." Stepping down to the cavern floor, Rosalie approaches the man, smiling widely. "Always a pleasure to meet the power," she pauses delicately, "the power /on/ the throne." She drops a curtsey. "Sally, at yer service."_

Mutsumi says, "Hehehehehe"

Brendan says, "Don't throw that away, you might need it later!"

_<CH 3> "Right," the mountain replies, and walks to stand a good foot from Rose. "Well then, Sally," Head inclined, "What brings you here?"_

Mutsumi says, "The mountain?"

Mutsumi says, "Ride, ride, ride, Sally ride!"

Brendan says, "No, the curtsey."

_<CH 3> Rosalie places one hand on hip, swaying it a little. "Rumour tells me you have work. Stories suggest you pay will. And tales tell of contracts you've garnered. Contracts that could use an /educated/ front."_

Brendan says, "Pay WIll? Wouldn't she want hte money"

Bill says, "Will must be her pimp"

Mutsumi peers at her breasts, "They have been schooled?"

_<CH 3> He smiles, which could be akin to a shark's mirth. "Please, educate me about what you've heard, then, teacher."_

Brendan wonders if she has an educated back, too

Mutsumi says, "I've never seen a shark happy."

_<CH 3> Rosalie tilts her head sideways, then puts a hand to her lips while she thinks. "Well, there was a contract recently to kill a bard. A ... dockworker ... would hardly have breeched the lord's garden where it happened. And there was a truly silly attempted ambush." She tsk tsks. "Quite clumsy, really."_

Bill says, "if her boobs are educated, she can educate every guy in the place"

Brendan says, "A mime is a terrible thing to waist."

_<CH 3> Avos waves his hand, in dismissiveness. "I didn't trust the fellows. It was my way of seeing if they were loyal, or up to being kept. The targets were formidable, and they waxed a lot of my boys a few months past."_

Bill says, "and now they're all shiny!"

Mutsumi says, "Aww!"

Mutsumi says, "Movie is over!"

Brendan says, "Yeah... :("
