# Aiel 2003-04-12

When we last left our heroes, they had found a few vials of potions, in addition to the missing archaeologists. They had defeated a small band of goblins, though not without their share of wounds. A potion fixed some of them. After recovering the body of their fallen mercenary, and the mysterious chest, they headed for the surface. At least for the moment.

Two goblins lie ahead in ambush. The sounds of their crossbows being loaded and cocked echoes throughout the cavern, and just as Gabriel's ears pick up, one bolt goes flying widely past his ear, while the other buries itself in his ribcage with a sickening thunk.

Gabriel slumps to the ground, his body taxed beyond its limit by his earlier spellcasting and the wounds he's just now received. Matthew squawks, fluttering away to avoid further arrow fire.

Ghost charges forward, a little slow, and is distracted as Gabriel falls in a heap. Assuring himself it's not a mortal wound, he concentrates on the job at hand, screaming, his handaxe cleaving a goblin in two.

The remaining goblin lets out an expletive that turns into a shriek as his comrade in arms is cleaven in twain by the charging Ghost. He drops his crossbow to the ground and draws the mace at his belt. He swings, and manages to leave a slight indentation against the taller Elf's thigh.

Ghost is enranged at the felling of his comrade, and makes the goblin pay. His arms crossed, he straightens them, both blades carving through the small body leaving a bloody corpse.

Getting back to the surface is easy enough, now that the remaning goblin guards have been dispatched. At least those that were visible. The light of the sun has shifted from the East to the West, as is it's wont, and the captives look around warily... ready for anything. They relax noticeably when Gabe and Ghost exit.

Ghost quickly opens one of the valuable potions, pouring it down his fallen comrade's throat. A coughing fit signals that he's been somewhat successful. "Are you alright?"

"Yeah.... yeah, I'll be fine," murmurs the half-conscious wizard. "Door.. sun... let's move..." He slumps back, slurring.

Ghost supports Gabriel, under his arm. "I think we got all of them..." he says, looking a bit battered from the experience.

The captives mill about for a moment. "Well we have to get back to Varden," says the one who has taken over leadership of the group of ex-prisoners, Tomas Sinvell. "The town watch will need to learn of the goblins. I can't imagine why they'd disturb this place though..."

Ghost frowns, idly sharpening his axe. "I think you can. Or there's something else. I've watched all of you since you were children from my perch. I know when you lie, or hide, or hold something back."

Tomas looks confused by what Ghost has to say, rather than scared. "Well... there is the matter of the fact that this is a tomb of Obad-Hai, but then... what business would Goblins want with the old bones of some priests?"

"Ghost.. you.. you have an obligation here," says Gabriel, quietly. "You commanded us to stay away, but you must see this through with us.." The wizard sighs, stretching a little as he tries to regain some strength. "Tomas. They want SOMETHING. Something important enough to justify all of this. That alone is information we need to have. You can go back to down, in fact I want you to - bring troops here, if you can. But somebody has to stay, and see to this. I suggest for the sake of my own life and possibly yours that you be as informative as you can."

"I am. It's just... they... they took her. They took her before you showed up. My daughter, they said they'll... I can't say anything more. If I do... she'll..." He looks like a man about to break down now. In fact, he does. The fetal position looks disturbing, especially on the ground like that...

Gabriel sighs. "We'll bring everyone back," he promises. "Tell us how many more to expect, and we'll bring everyone who lives."

Ghost frowns, checking the edge on his blade, making sure his axes are keen. He'll need them, obviously. Bloody goblins.
