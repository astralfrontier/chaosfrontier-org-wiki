# Aiel 2003-05-26

Ahhh the city. A very cool place at night. But then most places in Varden tend to be cool any time of the day. The streets tonight are home to revelers, workers who have the second shift, and this night... a certain... enterprising individual.

Samantha smiles, walking through the crowd in her work clothes. A long white dress, bounded in bits of gold trim, her eyes are wide an innocent, perfect for attracting the young lords who slide through the crowds with freedom.

Speaking of deep pocketed young lords... or rather those who have deep pockets and are young enough to think that a title is all one needs to carry respect... one comes stumbling out of an inn, looking very, very sloshed. This is an understatement.

For just a moment, the slightest of smiles passes over Sam's face, her eyes narrowing like a wolf seeing a lame deer. Then it vanishes into wide-eyed innocence as she moves that way, just happening to be heading for that particular inn.

The poor sot very nigh stumbles into Samantha with all the grace of a Gazebo. A poorly crafted one at that. "Oh... pardonnnn me misss," he slurs, while making an attempt to straighten himself up. His bleary eyes settle on Samantha and go wide. "Oh... hello there..."

Samantha blushes, turning her face away, hiding the grin. "It's alright, sir," she says, meekly. "I was in the way."

"Ah. Well how fortunate for you that you were in the way. It allowed you to meet me." His speech, it should be noted, has become remarkably clearer, suddenly, as though he's actually putting effort into his speech. He's still quite clearly drunk, just trying to not be so blindingly obvious about it. "And what's yer name?"

Samantha says, "Lady Elisia, daughter of Lord Maximillian." Oh, if only she were. Elisia, locked up by her father, to save her for better things. "I...wanted to see the city this evening."

"Oh. Well it's quite fortunatethatyoushouldrunintome." He says, forgetting that he should pause between one word and the next. "Of course... I can't do this, for um, for free."

Samantha blinks, wide eyed and innocent. "Do what?" she asks. She's emulating the most sought after, unattainable conquest in the city. "Protect me? Act as my guide?"

"Show you the city. Act as my guide. Yes yesss alla that. Thisissa dangerous place. Thieves and burgluararers."

The fellow continues, explaining with an overly exaggerated gesture. "It's not safe after dark sometimes... lessya have a manly man to keep you safe..."

Samantha moves closer, grasping the young lord's hand. "Please, I've never been out this late, Lord...?"

"Lord Hollisweathers." The name carries something in the way of a tie to a mercantile family with a stake in the merchants guild in this down. Quite a bit of a tie, actually. The son of one of the family members is due to marry into the daughter of one of the guildmistresses.

Samantha smiles charmingly. "Hollisweathers. Could you guard me, and show me around the city? I'm afraid I know so very little." She smiles, her hands ready, power building. "Perhaps we should get out of this crowd, to somewhere quieter."

Hollisweathers is quite agreeable when it comes to getting somewhere quieter. He allows himself to be led around, rather than keep up the pretense as a guard.

Or guide, for that matter.

Samantha steers the poor drunk lord into the shadows, and then pretends to trip, letting her hands come off Hollisweather's hands. Before the drunk lord can recover, she's casting her spell, smiling as she speaks arcane words, her fingers working. In a few moments, the spell is cast, and the lord is even more tightly wrapped in enchantment.

There's an even more vapid look in his eyes, if such a thing can be said to happen. He stumbles about, showing little sign of being under the effects of the spell. In fact, he looks rather as though he is ready to collapse. He does so then, which is followed up by a **thud**

Samantha sighs, moving close again, and turning the poor lord over. "Milord, are you alright?" Her eyes wide and vacant. He mutters. "Yes... I'm quite alright. I seem to have lost my balance though. I'll get up..." He makes three attempts, before finally stumbling to his feet. He bows before Sam. "At your service milady."

Samantha says, "Oh dear, perhaps we better go to a room so you can lie down." Her voice is full of concern. "Are you alright? Is your money safe where you stored it?" After all, she's his closest friend. There's no reason for him not to tell her where his money is...

"I'm quite alright..." He nods, "Although perhaps we should get back to my room. Yes... the room..." He has an odd little grin on his face then. Money or no... "Yes, it's in my room."

Samantha smiles, and takes the young sots hand, helping support him as she lets him lead. "I'll help you get there, my guard."

The sot quite clearly wishes to make sure his riches are safe. He has absolutely nothing else on his mind. At least that's what Sam's more cash-oriented mind believes. Within five minutes, he's leading her down to a rather large looking manor house. "I'm just in here."

Samantha follows, leaning against the lord, her chest pressed up against his arm, looking all the more helpless, but supporting the other man. "What a beautiful house! she exclaims, smiling. "

"Oh... no that's m'father's house... I live down here." He gestures drunkenly, towards a smaller house across the street. It's one-story, and not the richest of places... yet it is his, which is more than most can say in the city of Kest.

Samantha stifles a wistful sigh. "Not quite as large as my father's, but still beautiful." Which is true, for the girl she's imitating. She did her research.

The sot fumbles with the doorlock for a moment... though it opens after a time. He holds the door open, "Well... after you dear lady."

Samantha enters the house, eyes going to a lovely vase near the front door. "This is a nice house..."

Samantha shits, turning. "Aw, crap. This isn't your house, is it? We're in the same business."

Samantha's wide-eyed innocence shifts to a knowing look, her voice dropping from innocence to working girl.

The sot, realizing he's been found out, nods. "Yes. And if you don't want to get caught, then you'll keep your voice down now." The fellow relaxes a bit, as though he were relieved about something. His voice lowers, "If you help me pull this thing off... I guarantee ya a score that'll have you set for life..."

Samantha hmms, and nods. "Why all the cloak and dagger then?" she whispers. "You could have just asked if you had a job for me..."

"In all honesty... I was gonna use you as my cover if I was found out. Just escorting you back to my place." He shrugs. "Pays to have a back up plan. Now c'mon." He shuts up and begins looking through some of the varied furniture. There're a few cabinets down here, as well as several desks, and so forth. As though someone were recently moving in and hadn't had time to arrange the furniture.

Samantha searches through a cupboard, tapping along one side...and finds a loose fold in the material at the side of the cupboard. She pulls out, "Well, hell-O!" A beautiful little brooch, platinum crescent with twin emerald moons. "This is a little piece of heaven..."

And as if on cue, it's about that time that a sharp 'TING' can be heard, and the room Sam and the other thief are in, is bathed in the golden glow of a sunrod. A high-pitched voice screams out, "Intruder! Help! Guards! Help!" This voice belongs, likely as not, to the real Hollisweather. And then of course, at the shout... the soudn of footsteps outside can be heard.

Samantha bolts, not for the open door, but for the nearest window, hoping to head out the back way, and not much caring which way her fellow theif heads.

Samantha dives through the window, breaking it, hands protectively over her head as she breaks through the glass. She hits the ground, the glow behind her, looking for the shadows, escape.

And as soon as she dives through the glass, two different sets of footsteps begin heading towards the window along the side of the building. Poor Sam. At least she's got the lovely little brooch...
