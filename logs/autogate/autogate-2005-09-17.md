# AutoGate 2005-09-17

The Voidbringer sect ordinarily met in a small, disused building on the outskirts of the patropolis of Thosh. The ancient Alchemical hero whose soul stirred at the core of the city, and whose will and blood flowed through the conduits of the urban body he wore now, made it clear that all occupants of Autochthon were welcome within his boundaries as long as they worked. His permissiveness let such destructive dissidents inside.

Their newest member was being brought in even now. The small cult had heard good things - from their perspective - about this man. That he was a member of the Populat and had ties to the rumored Gate Complex being built here in Yugash. That he could get them access to the Gate which supposedly tied Autochthonia to other places - perhaps it could bring in the Void itself. And as he stepped through the rickety doorway of the storage cabin, the seven cult members appraised him. Black hair, curly, framing a face scarred by a life close to the forges of industry. Green eyes, the color of energetic industrial waste. A lean, almost emaciated frame. He had the very look of the Void about him. The two men flanking him nodded to their superiors - he had been checked for weapons, and was clean.

"Good, good," the cult's leader bubbled, his oily voice taking on a high pitch in the confines of the claustrophobic building. "Is everyone here?" Those around him nodded. And the man spoke, in a low and even voice. "This is all of you?" The cultist bobbed his head proudly.

"Then things are simpler," the newcomer announced. The long, synthetic-leather jacket he wore suddenly flapped as Essence sparked across his body like black lightning. His body lost its humanness abruptly - the faux-flesh revealed for what it was, artificial clay. His Soulgem changed on his brow, and biomechanical implants sprung from his flesh. Suddenly, he was an Alchemical Exalted. Suddenly, he was armed.

---

A six-foot shadow strode purposefully through the streets of Thosh. Here and there, the occasional member of the Populat who was out late would realize he was there, and stop, or step reflexively toward the nearest shadow, or simply cringe. The Soulsteel and clay and brass of the thing revealed him as a member of the Grim Watch. His destination was the large Tripartite facility near the center of Thosh. The doors opened as he waved a hand before the sensor, and he entered that forbidding sanctum of science.

Inside, things were more sociable. **Successful, my friend?** boomed a voice, omnipresent, from the entry-room. The Alchemical nodded and let out a sigh, the merest echo of whirring gears audible as he exhaled from his 'lungs'. "Yes," he replied at last, allowing himself a smile. Red eyes glanced ceiling-ward. "Now it is time for rest."

As is customary at the end of every mission (successful or not), the voice of Thosh is followed shortly by another voice. Less booming, but very commanding. The voice is a gruff one, with just enough of a warmth to it to make one unsure just when its bearer is mad or when he is pleased. "Any complications?" He fashions himself a Captain, and is one by rank, but nobody looking at his slightly flabby body would imagine that Garath has been away from a desk lately, much less seen any major fighting in decades.

The Alchemical rumbles. "Nine dead or disabled. Their soulgems will be recovered by the human regulators. Two repeat offenders." One reincarnation left to one, two to another. How many lifetimes could a human being screw up, he wondered.

Garath frowns thoughtfully. In fact, the man rarely wears much else but various types of frown. "The big wigs will appreciate that." And that is about as much praise as one will ever get from him. "Before you kick up your feet, though, there's something you need to do for me.." And that, by rule, means something that the chief just doesn't feel like doing. It's never a good sign when it comes right after a mission. "We have a new guest here that you should meet. In fact, I was hoping you would show her around a bit. You know, the low security tours you are so good at. I'm afraid my attention will be elsewhere."

The unearthly Exalt flexes his hands, and the crack of endoskeleton can be heard from beneath his clay flesh. His face is a mask, but his displeasure is not hard to read. "It is not yet my downtime," he observes neutrally.

"That a boy," says Garath. Is that a glint of amusement in his eyes?

But soon enough, the attention of the Exalt will likely shift as a young woman comes into view. It is immediately obvious that she's not from around here. She wears a dress of radiant white, and her hair-a chestnut brown-hangs down past her waist and is far too ornate for any of the personnel here to put up with. "Is this my partner?" she asks quietly. Her voice stands out, as well, soft, far too gentle to command anyone, and yet almost impossible to ignore due to its clarity and richness.

Garath coughs a bit and looks away. "Erm.. eh. Well, this is her," comes his grand introduction. "She's Livia, and she's going to be doing a lot of very important work with you and the others. Well, once there are others. And, well, once there is other work. You know, The Work." Which is naturally what the chief says when he's referring to the gate, which according to the last report, was a very draining portal to a meaningless jumble that destroyed every probe sent into its maw.

"Gauntlet." The hand that's outstretched is of a dark consistency; the Alchemical enforcer it belongs to is equally dusky, except for his eyes. "My time is yours."

The human part of him cares little for others. He doesn't remember being so jaded - he doesn't remember anything, in fact - but somehow he feels that he has become more detached since the incident. This woman registers little on his mortal self. The machine generates data approximating a similar response - an unusual entity to be found in an unusual facility is itself not unusual at all. The echoes of the hero's soul urge politeness. And the whispers of his body, the voices that he should not be hearing, are unusually still.

Livia reaches out a white gloved hand. Naturally her grip is soft as can be. "Well, that is most polite of you, Gauntlet. It's very surprising, since the chief said you were a complete-" But her words are stopped as the chief suddenly coughs rather roughly. Before the concerned girl can ask help him he's waving her off. "Anyway, show her around." He pauses for a moment, adding a simple motion that to most would seem just a casual scratching of his neck, but to those in this facility indicates a great deal more. Apparently Livia, who is to be given the tour, is also to be regarded as a potentially deadly threat. The girl doesn't notice anything odd, of course. She just waits patiently to be led about, her lithe frame shifting just a bit as she bounces a little on her toes.

Gaunt hums, his voicebox emitting a gentle sine wave as he considers. "Very well." He addresses himself to Livia. "This facility was built by the Tripartite. The Eight Nations have standardized such facilities throughout several cities, and this patropolis plays host to this one. It exists to coordinate administrative, industrial, and technological functions with other cities, and to perform .. specialized research as directed by Thosh."

"I see," says Livia quietly. She settles in beside the alchemical, looking at the facility as if it were the most amazing thing in the world. "Specialized research. You must mean that door, I suppose. They are always talking about it so quietly around here, and everyone seems to have another word for it. It must be a very terrifying thing to all you to make you not even with to say its name."

Having a chance to watch Livia for a short time, there is something else about her that can be noticed. It doesn't stand out so much when she is standing one spot, but when she moves through light and darkness, it is apparent. No matter what level of shade or illumination she steps through, she also seems to be easily visible, as if a radiance was coming right through her skin.

Gauntlet begins walking, directing himself and his guest toward the network of corridors that serve as the veins for the facility's mobile components. "It is natural to distrust the unknown, madam," he points out. "The less we know of a thing, the more we must necessarily keep it at a distance. Physically, scientifically, or psychologically."

The young woman taps her lip, a little smile growing on her face as she realizes something. "Why, that must be why people are so very afraid of me, then! How curious and sad, though. I don't want to have people fear me." She turns to face the alchemical then, settling both her fists on her hips, and though she may try, her serious glare makes her look more like an anxious child than a commanding woman, "You aren't afraid of me, are you?"

Gauntlet's crimson eyes stare back calmly. "I haven't yet determined whether or not I could defeat you," he says, his voice making it clear that this is what his true answer hinges on.

"Defeat me?" asks Livia. "I don't think I understand. Do you mean in some sort of contest?" She claps her hands and laughs, "Or maybe at a game! I do love games!" She pauses abruptly, her lips twisting as she asks, "But what games do I love again?" The thought vanishes fast enough, "Oh, I'm sure it doesn't matter. Tell me what game you could defeat me at that would make you feel comfortable. We're going to be partners, you know."

"Not in any game.." Gauntlet shakes his head, unsure of how to make his point without causing harm. A self-examination thread begins to spin itself in his thought-stream, questioning why he is concerned about such a thing. "Can you explain what you mean about partners?"

"Of course I can," says Livia. She looks very sure and confident, ready to say something, and again, she must pause. "Well, I think so. It involves that door, really. You see, I can understand it. Because it called out to me. I can hear it now, too, though it's rather faint. Poor thing was so very tired after I came through. And the Chief and all of his friends were so loud and anxious to greet me! It was like some sort of parade!" She laughs softly then, her mind shifting back to the earlier point. "So what would you defeat me at, if it's not a game?"

The Alchemical speaks carefully. His body whispers to him in a thousand half-heard words, but he ignores them. "In this world, force - physical or magical power - is the final tool of enforcing one's will. If one dies, one is no longer capable of changing the world. One is no longer a threat."

"Then how can you ever be comfortable with anyone, if you must kill them just to find out if you can defeat them?" asks Livia curiously. "That seems very rude, to me. And you are so much bigger than I am, too!" She leans forward, her eyes twinkling-literally-for just a moment as she asks, "Can I show you how I can help you? If you take me to the door, I can make it open to the kind of places you are looking for. Places that aren't so staticy, the places that sing in just one voice. Like this place."

Gauntlet has no answer for the question - at least, none that he wishes to discuss. He settles for a simple nod.

The voice of Thosh interrupts, booming out clearly, **Access to all high- and mid-clearance restriction zones for the Visitor is barred** To this, Livia can only pout and stomp a foot, looking very much the child. "You aren't very fun at all, Mister Voi-" **My name is Thosh** One has the feeling that the city has had to make that correction before, judging from the swiftness of the interruption. "But, but-" **Access DENIED** Livia crosses her arms, trying her best to frown, and managing it for approximately a half second before she resumes pestering Gauntlet. "So you just came back from a mission, right? I couldn't help but overhear a little. Maybe you could tell me about it?"

"Aside from my work here, I perform my regular duties as an adjudicator for the Tripartite," Gauntlet replies blandly. "In other words, I enforce the law that keeps our world running."

"The law?" asks Livia. "I suppose it has something to do with killing and such. This world sounds very serious. Is that why you are using the door? To find a place where you can relax?" Her attention wavers then as she notices the scanner of a door. With a curious expression, she tries to casually move closer to it without really seeming to. She isn't particularly good at sneaking.

"The law is that the Great Maker which sustains life must himself continue to live. Inefficiency, wastefulness, and corruption are the enemies of our life." Gauntlet frowns. "It is not necessary to kill. It is only necessary to be capable of it, if you are an enforcer. But it is necessary to learn, and to grow, and to evolve. Our industry does those things. We of the Exalted do them. The 'door' will allow us to do more."

"I see.. then you are very lucky that you found me," says Livia. "Because no one else can possibly understand the door, much less control it." She smiles triumphantly, "You _do_ need me after all, then. Eventually I'm sure you'll see that. Of course, you have to let me prove it first. With enemies like that, I'd think you'd be happy to help me find my place and purpose here." She raises her eyebrows, looking expectantly at Gauntlet. "You will help me, right? Talk to the chief, I mean. Let me prove myself?"

"I do not stand in the way of you proving anything," Gauntlet replies neutrally. "If we are being assigned as partners on a project, we will naturally cooperate to the greatest possible extent for the sake of the project.."

That clearly isn't enough to satisfy the girl. "Oh very well. I'll have to just make my own way, then. You do understand, right?" She reaches out then to touch the scanner, and two things happen at once. The first is unexpected, and the second is not. The door opens suddenly, though it is restricted access, and then the alarm can be heard blaring very clearly.

The Alchemical's forearms split apart along unseen seams, and a whirring mechanical sound heralds something moving at high speed out of the suddenly-opened cavities. A pair of plasma weapons are ejected into his palms, and his arms close themselves just as abruptly. In a flash Gauntlet has armed himself, and the guns train themselves without thought on Livia. "Halt, please," he says, evenly.

Livia has her hands on her ears, rather paralyzed by the sound even before the weapons are traced on her. The alarms continue for a while, ending only when the corridor is rather crowded with soldiers. The voice of the chief booms out over all, "WHAT IS GOING ON, DAMMIT!" The man stomps into sight, parting the soldiers without much concern for who he tramples over. His hands carry a double-barreled cannon, its business end glowing a faint blue from the energy inside, so very anxious to be released. When he sees Livia he looks to be ready to put the gun to use. "Dammit, whose brilliant idea was it to let her in the door?"

"Livia, your chance to prove yourself has come," murmurs Gauntlet. "Abide by our security regulations, or we must consider you an enemy. You have one chance, and I would regret you wasting it."

Livia takes her hands from her ears slowly, letting out a ragged sigh. She settles her hands on her dress, bunching up the fabric in a tight grip as she leans against the wall. "I don't understand," she answers truthfully. "It's calling again. Don't you hear that? It's the door."

"Just you forget the door!" bellows the chief. "You can spend a few days in the hole to help take your mind off of it, too." He turns his rather deeper frown towards Gauntlet, "I think the tour is over. You are going to explain to me just what happened in my office. Now." He gestures sharply to two of the soldiers, "Now take her away and put her in her room until I've made up my mind! And you better be sure she doesn't come waltzing out early like last time or I'll have you recycled!" With that, the chief stomps off towards his office, weapon held at ready the entire time.

"Accompany me," Gauntlet directs to the soldiers, then begins walking toward the chief's office. His guns retract quietly and calmly back into his arms, disappearing beneath the faux-flesh surface.

The chief has managed to work himself through most of his froth by the time he reaches his office, his mind settling once more to a far more efficient and rational place. Setting his weapon in a very large drawer in his desk, he takes a seat, indicating with a grunt and a nod that Gauntlet should do the same. "Spill it," is all he says.

"This woman witholds information from us. But you have done the same," the Alchemical opens, his dispassionate voice tinged with efficiently-managed and directed anger. "Further, I deduce that you have failed to sufficiently investigate her connection to the gate project."

The chief at first looks rather displeased by the rather blunt response. "You never did respect authority," he growls, "but that's the only reason I wanted you involved in this, anyway." He chews on his lower lip for a moment-a sure sign that he doesn't like something-and begins his explanation. "At 0846 three days ago, the gate project ran its seventh live test. This would be the first time the lid would be opened. You weren't informed because it was supposed to be another boring test. The gate doesn't stay open long, and it'd take something of a miracle to hit anything anyway. At least that is what they tell me." He grunts at that, "They tell us a lot of things, though. This won't be the last time they are wrong."

"Ever since the last incident," and here the chief looks hard at Gauntlet, "We've been told the project was blacklisted, and we've been doing these quiet tests, given only enough energy access to pop the gate for a couple seconds. It took us weeks to get approval to make the lid. Bah, you know all the red tape I have to deal with. Anyway, for the first time since the incident, we got a positive. Stable area, at least relatively, and signs of valuable mineral resources. The sort of thing that would get the high ups pretty excited. Only thing is, the focus slipped. Damn clumsy operator fudged the lock and the next thing you know, we've dragged a gathering probe across a swath of whatever is out there about a million times the size of this city."

"If you swing a net far enough, you are bound to catch something, I guess," says Garath. The chief puts his hands to rub at the bridge of his nose. "Better if we hadn't, though. When we drew the gatherer in, it wasn't destroyed. It wasn't even damaged, but it was unfortunately not empty, either. She was in it. She said something about hearing a song and acted, well, like the strange thing she is. One thing was immediately clear, though. She could sense the gate, and she somehow knows how to operate the lock. She knew the exact coordinates we had been probing, and she knew how much power we'd consumed doing it."

"I had her put under observation, only she keeps getting out," explains the chief. "There's something about her. People don't act normal around her. You saw it back there, didn't you? I was going to put her in an isolation chamber, then I say just put her in her room! And you know what, if I go down there now she'll be waltzing about this place free again. There's something insidious about that woman. It won't be long before someone lets her out again. If this keeps up we'll have to.." He frowns deeply, "We'll do something extreme, at least."

"We'll have to make her wish to cooperate," concludes Gauntlet.

"I'm not entirely sure how to do that," admits the chief. "All she wants to talk about is the gate. We can't just let some dangerous visitor play around with that thing. Who knows what she might let through! She claims she can hear voices through it, which is hardly encouraging. I'm sure she told you all about that. She tells everyone. Even if I wanted to give it a shot, how can I possibly convince my superiors to let a walking security breach have the controls of a gateway?" He frowns deeply, "And damn her, why would I want to even try!"

"Because she understands it better than we, and you wish this experiment to succeed?" Gauntlet asks calmly. It is moments like this that he values Clarity, for it cuts through the fog of passion.

The chief mutters under his breath. It's quite apparent that clarity is a thing he lacks in this regard. "Ah hell, has she even gotten to you?" he grumbles. "Alright, alright. I'll see what I can do. Our asses are all going on the line on this one, though." He rises rather suddenly, turning away. His normal, rough tone fades just a little as he says, "You'll need to have another team assembled. Damn girl has my head all jumbled. The personnel files are on my desk in the envelope. I'm giving you full approval to pick and choose your team members. You're running this show once you get inside, wherever she steers the gate. Be ready for anything. We can't imagine what the hell is going to be waiting. But uh, I guess you know that better than I do."

"The goal is to find that out," Gauntlet says quietly. And there is another objective, one he does not speak of: to discover what happened before. To find lost comrades, if their souls are out in the great beyond. To regain some part of his humanity that was taken away with his life.

"Oh, and I'm leaving it up to you to tell her about using the gate," says Garath. "Maybe she'll listen to you and stay where she's supposed to." He clearly wouldn't bet on that, himself. "You think three days will be enough time to get the team assembled? I don't want to sit on this too long. If they find out she can open security doors they'll probably try to euthanize her. Considering what I've observed so far, I'm afraid that might result in an unprecedented disaster."

"I'll do whatever must be done," says Gauntlet. It is the summary of his existence in a single sentence.
