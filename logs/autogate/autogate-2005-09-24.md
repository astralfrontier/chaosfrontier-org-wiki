# AutoGate 2005-09-24

Ops furrows her brow as she leafs through the latest reports on the gate project. "Guards talking to their roommates... anomalous behavior from the relevant authorities" Another sheet materializes in the In tray, and she picks it up, scanning its contents in an eyeblink. "And now an unauthorized door access just today..." Her vocoder rasps in the semblance of a sigh. "One more incident, and I'll have to request assistance." Gentle Operational Facilitator does not relish this prospect, but her machine-soul reminds her that it is only rational to seek aid in a task that is beyond your present abilities. And concealing the full nature of the Gate project from the Populat not assigned to it is shaping up to be such a task.

A soft chime signals a caller outside the door of the controller's office. There's a second bell-tone, the security signal: a medium-grade official.

Ops sets the reports back in her In tray. Out of carefully cultivated habit, she also closes the lid with a soft click, a flashing light on the latch indicating that it is now sealed to unauthorized personnel. "Enter," she calls.

The figure who enters, synthetic-leather longcoat trailing behind him, is the first urban legend produced by the Gate project. His shattering and subsequent rebuilding were never adequately explained. His old name was erased from the records as the first attempt to control. Now he is called Gauntlet. His red eyes focus.

"Facilitator," he rumbles. "I require 10 minutes of your time."

"Affirmative," Ops says, nodding. "State your purpose."

Looking at the party who most likely gave the final authorization to erase the records of his old life, Gauntlet nevertheless speaks with a level tone, barely above an eerie whisper. "The influx of knowledge, resources, and other assets from a functional Gate project will grow beyond the bounds of controllability. Information dissemination will be regulated, not suppressed. The success of this project necessarily obsoletes your function within it. Therefore I request that you accompany the Gate exploration unit in a social and organizational capacity."

Ops's sculpted eyebrows dip toward one another. It is the role of the Sentinels to enact information policy, not make it - surely his retraining has reminded him of that? Nevertheless, her expression does not reveal this subthread of thought. Instead, she says, "Regulation is merely incomplete suppression, and that task will still need to be performed." But Gauntlet's request touches her latent curiosity - even the Blessed of Mog may sometimes fall prey to the blandishments of Noi. "How would social interaction benefit the Gate exploration unit?"

"Of the Gate missions we have performed, one has yielded sentient life, the other has yielded... inclusive results," Gauntlet whispers. "Livia's nature is an unknown. Her knowledge of the Gate itself and what may lie beyond has not been determined. Clearly other intelligent beings may be found, and I am... unsuited for first contact." The whispering ghost, thin as a skeleton and black as the night, could not speak more truly.

"I know that Livia's nature has made my task exponentially more difficult," Ops says, with a note of sourness. "But what you say is true. I was about to request additional assistance in my present task in any event; assigning me to a new task would mesh well with that." She looks up at Gauntlet again. "Very well. I am willing to assist. I assume that you have been granted authorization to requisition my assistance?"

"Assume what you like," hisses the voice. "But I am going. And you are joining me."

Ops's eyebrows furrow again. "You are very certain of this," she states. "Very well. I will report to you when my relief has arrived." Until she sees the documentation, of course, that 'when' is actually an 'if'.

"I will see to its arrival personally." And Gauntlet wheels, departing.

Ops peers at the door even after Gauntlet has left, then returns to her desk, reopening her In tray and collecting the reports she'd placed in there before. There is an extra sheet in the stack, and it turns out to contain the cc'd requisition from Gauntlet. She reviews it as well, and returning to her desk, begins preparing her own report requesting a more senior Vizier to take over the information-control duties. Though Gauntlet's presumption rankles her nerves, it will be worth it to take on a genuinely _new_ duty.

---

Pillar floats between tasks, currently without a major duty to occupy him. The attempts to breach the Seal of Eight Divinities called for the creation of additional Exalts in preparation, and Pillar was one such Alchemical. In the wake of failure to shattering the Seal, Pillar has been reassigned numerous times - from emergency deployment to control malfunctions of the Maker's systems, to monitor and persuader of efficiency in a factory of the Populat, to escort of expeditions seeking to tap new conduits and uncover new sources of Magical Material.

In each case, feedback is indicative of two traits in the nascent Stone Hand: commendable depth of loyalty to his comrades, and a marked lack of efficient judgment. The Exalt lacks clarity, exhibiting a disturbing tendency towards unacceptable risk for dubious reward. A recent except from a report on the Executive reads: 'the loss of members of the Populat is regrettable, yet their Soulgems last on. Damage to the Maker can prove far more devastating. This has failed to imprint itself onto Pillar of Fortitude, and I thus request his transfer from my unit.'

Such reports have been made available for review by officials of the Gate project, for Pillar has come with a recommendation of service to them. It is to be hoped, the accompanying brief states, that time working alongside fellow Alchemicals will imprint Pillar with more appropriate behavioral patterns. Additionally, his formidable capability as a warrior will serve the Gate project well, should they encounter hostile lifeforms in their explorations. The Exalt has received directives to report to Gate project officials for review, and moves to do so now.

In the Tripartite facility in the patropolis of Thosh, Pillar does not have long to wait. He is greeted by three entities.

The first of these is a tall, emaciated Soulsteel enforcer with radiant red eyes, wearing a long and flowing coat, who whispers a greeting. "I am Gauntlet." The name is short, to the point, and vague - not like the usual naming of an Alchemical at all. A hand gestures at the other two by way of introduction.

The next form is as different from Gaunt-and for that matter anyone in all of Autochthonia-as one could get. It is a lithe woman with long, chestnut hair, ornately kept, and with eyes of vivid blue. She is actually smiling as she stands beside Gauntlet, and watches him offer his greeting with the curiosity of a child. When it comes her turn, she blinks thoughtfully at Pillar, watching him for several seconds before saying, "I am Livia."

The third figure is also lightly built, but short enough that her slender frame seems more proportional than Gauntlet's stick-figure silhouette. Starmetal wires cover her face, arms, and calves, picking out the occasional Charm on her skin. "And I am Gentle Operational Facilitator. Welcome to the Gate project. Have you been briefed on your duties?"

"You have read my reports," the Jade-Caste rumbles in response, sparing Livia a curious glance before directing the next statement to the pair of Alchemicals. "I am here for evaluation and assignment. Briefing on my duties will commence if my service is accepted." He presents an imposing figure, tall for an Exalt of his Essence and with remarkable bulk even for a member of his thickset Caste.

"First test," whispers the shadowy Soulsteel Exalt. "You have here an information specialist and an interaction specialist. You have a third party, whose nature is unknown. Devise a plan to determine her nature and explain it."

Facilitator turns slightly so that she can see Livia's reaction. Even if this test is not focused on her, she will participate as well - and her first observation will concern how the subject responds to being discussed as a subject.

Livia looks to Gauntlet, tilting her head curiously. She then looks to Pillar. The stranger bounces on her toes a moment, waiting impatiently for something to happen. When nothing does in the span of a few seconds, she asks, "Is this a game?" A few seconds later she asks, "Is this fun?"

Pillar's eyes narrow, and he nods to the sinister Alchemical, ignoring Livia's activity. "A true Blessed of Ku. Very well. The subject is not implanted with a Soulgem, and is therefore not a member of Autochthonian society at large. The subject's genetic makeup is unlike that seen among the Maker's people, and she is therefore not an unimplanted exile. Her origin is a source unknown to the Populat at large and to myself."

"And what procedure would you use to determine it?" presses Gauntlet.

"The subject's responses cannot be relied upon, as hers is the unknown nature. If she is truly foreign, conventional technological analysis may yield invalid results. I question those who accompany her."

Facilitator corrects this in a soft voice, though still louder than Gauntlet's whisper. "The subject's responses can be analyzed as data, even if they cannot be trusted as accurate in themselves. Nevertheless, state your questions." She glances in Gauntlet's direction, wondering why the Sentinel is attempting to probe the new recruit's analytical skills, when herself and Gauntlet are already better optimized for that task - although her analytical centers quickly provide a few hypotheses.

"Nobody accompanies her." Gauntlet's whisper is firm. "Continue."

Facilitator opens her mouth again, and then closes it, stepping back. Clearly, whether or not Pillar is accepted, additional discussions will have to occur later about the appropriate roles of the existing members of the team. It will not do, in the field, to have the members of the Assembly contradicting one another. If that means that she herself will be expected to follow Gauntlet's lead, then so be it, but this will have to be established before anyone steps through the Gate again.

Livia turns her attention on the Facilitator, nodding thoughtfully. "Very true, my own answers might be enlightening, unless of course I'm being deliberately obscure or inaccurate. Or perhaps I could be telling the whole truth and only making it appear to be a lie. Or perhaps I do not even know the truth and am simply making it up to amuse myself. Or perhaps I nothing more but an anomoly caused by the chaos of the gate altering the enforced order of the innards of the Great Maker into something more in their likeness."

Somewhat bemused by the intensity of the Soulsteel Exalt's questionings, Pillar's reply is simple. "My role is not the deduction and gathering of information. I pass the task to those better suited, or revise my plans to exclude the necessity of that data." His tone is not angered, yet carries a hint of dismissal. If Gauntlet wishes to assert himself through this, Pillar will not play along.

"Correct. Entirely correct." Gauntlet hums with decided satisfaction. "And what should we defer to you for?"

"My outfit and proficiencies suit me to the forceful elimination of hostile parties," Pillar informs Gaunt in a neutral tone.

Gauntlet nods. He glances to Livia and Facilitator. "Satisfied?"

Livia looks confused by this question. "I guess." She looks over to Facilitator then, wondering if she will be satisfied. Thus far, Livia hasn't seen much satisfaction on the Blessed of Mog's part.

Facilitator nods. "Affirmative. Pillar's understanding is adequate and appropriate," she says, though she catches Gauntlet's gaze and inclines her head slightly.

"So to summarize," Gauntlet murmurs. "She --" indicating Facilitator "-- works with people we don't hurt. He --" indicating Pillar "-- hurts the rest. I figure out which is which. Any questions?"

Livia looks to Pillar, nodding thoughtfully, then to Facilitator. This leaves her very curious. "Yes, I do have a question. What do I do to the people that you hurt and don't hurt? And what does the Chief do? I mean, beside yell at me and sit at his desk, of course." She clearly thinks the yelling at her part is the key to his existance. Lately it has taken up a lot of his time, after all.

"Your job is to do whatever you think you should do. Provided you clear it with us first," answers Gauntlet calmly. "We're like that, but with the Chief." He pauses. "Any further questions?"

Pillar remains silent, concealing his amusement and shaking his head to indicate the absence of queries on his part. It seems that the Gate project has attracted a number of unconventional individuals. At the very least, his time here will be interesting - and that is enough.

_Good luck with that. It doesn't look like this Livia is very good at asking permission before she acts_, thinks Facilitator, allowing herself a slight smile. But she doesn't say it - Gauntlet already knows this all too well, and Pillar will find out in due course.

Livia blinks thoughtfully, nodding to Gauntlet. She wonders what she is supposed to be thinking she should do, but decides she'll ask Facilitator later. She seems to be in a better mood now, after all, and will likely prove helpful. For the moment, Livia is blissfully silent. It cannot last.

The lull in discussion provides a rather convenient time for a booming voice to cut in. **THE TEST PROBE IS READY. YOUR PRESENCE IS REQUESTED BY CAPTAIN GARATH.** The omnipresent voice of Thosh rings out clear and strong, and the intense bindings of a complete external lock down send a tremor through the facility as enormous gates slam shut, ready to entomb those inside should the test take a fatal turn.

The path to the gate is well known by all here, save perhaps Pillar. It is a winding path, going through numerous security check points. After each is passed, metal doors and lowered behind the team until finally they reach the main blast door. There are no guards here, no scans. The door simply opens by the direction of those already inside.

The gateroom is by the standards of Autochthonia a titantic open space, some fifty paces across and twice that in depth. The ceiling is twenty-five feet high. Past the main door is an armored station fifteen feet above the floor proper, with a ramp that winds down to the main floor on the right. On that station are numerous soldiers and of course, the Chief himself, his arms crossed. As is usual when things are dangerous, his frown is particularly deep. He snorts derisively and points to Livia, "It's time to prove your worth."

Facilitator's frown, for a moment, is almost as deep as the Chief's, and her thoughts surely mirror his own. _Can we trust her?_ followed quickly by _Do we have a choice?_ Carefully masking her expression, she replaces it with a smile. "I'm sure Livia will surprise us all," she says, contriving even to sound pleased by the prospect.

As the team's new addition, Pillar chooses to take the role of observer. It is clear that this process is a dangerous one, and the Jade-Caste has no wish to disturb focus through questioning that can wait for a more opportune moment. He endeavors to keep his bulk from interfering and prepares to play witness.

Those words from the Facilitator draw Livia's attention. She offers a smile and nods to the Facilitator. A vote of confidence? A surprise for her. She walks casually past the chief and down the ramp. She asks no questions of the operators that are standing nearby to observe her. They share a smirk, obviously positive she can't possibly handle the machine on her own, especially without even asking a single question.

They are wrong. Livia lets out a soft sigh, holding her hands above the myriad of levers, buttons, dials, and keypads that are the controls. As if on their own, they begin to shift, to tap, and to adjust the gate guidance. The gate remains safely shut behind its enormous lid as it is refocused again and again. A soft humming grows in the room as the machine begins to reach a focus. Mirroring that pitch is a second, softer sound, as Livia sings a long, pure note. Steadily the humming shifts in pitch, more and more slight until it mingles with the note of the Stranger, forming a perfect harmony. Livia looks to the lid, then, "It is with one voice. It holds its tone and pitch."

There is an intense silence in the room at this announcement. The operators look at the controls and swiftly begin memorizing the coordinates she has settled on. The younger operator says, "It's about mark 50 from any sweep we've made." The other, whose mouth was open, shuts it with a click, glaring at the other for being first.

Gauntlet hums. "'Unto darkness, light'," he whispers, remembering a phrase from the Luminors - a phrase that Thosh taught him, one of the first phrases he learned as his memory was rebuilt. It serves now for exploration.

Facilitator nods slowly, her smile looking a little more fixed as she attempts to process what Livia has just done. It would seem that her words were correct - Livia has indeed surprised everyone, including the Starmetal negotiator herself.

Pillar only shakes his head in bewilderment. Unusual individuals, indeed. Not only has this strange woman been permitted use of clearly advanced Autochthonian equipment, she has proven impossibly - and, it seems, unexpectedly - adept at its use. What other surprises will his new assignment hold?

"Open the lid and send in the probe!" orders the Chief. The lid opening is actually the retraction of massive plates, forged of two foot thick steel. The motion is surpisingly quiet, and rather fast, as well. The gate is not fully opened, providing only enough room for the probe. That device is a quadraped, no more than three feet in length. It's 'head' is loaded with many sensors and most of its torso is taken up with open cavities for gathering whatever it might find. With a shriek of gears it leaps into the glowing, watery surface of the autogate.

The usual mission indicates that the probe should be active for fifteen minutes of gathering-no more-and then return. When it leaps back through the gate some ten seconds later, the only one who is not surprised is Livia. She acts with a sigh, and the gate smoothly fades, its surface returning into the impossibly intricate matrix of the five magical materials that formed it. This simple act leaves the operators gaping. Until now, every time the autogate was deactivated resulted in a tremendous release of excess essence. Still, it is not this that holds the interest of most hear. It is the probe. It is unharmed, and every gathering chamber is filled. There is a sign of soil in one of these large tubes, and in another the glow of stones, and in still another the glitter of some kind of metals, all carefully sorted inside the probe. One of the probe engineers approaches it, flanked by two soldiers with weapons readied. "Relative time thirteen minutes, twenty eight seconds," he announces flatly.

The engineer is soon joined by others, and there is obvious excitement among them. The Chief, getting rather irritated, demands, "Well! What is it?" There's a pause then, and the first engineer rises and says, "We've found iron sir, and more importantly, trace amounts of white and yellow jade."

Magical Materials! Facilitator keeps this exclamation to herself, unlike some of the others who speak it out loud, but her surprise is enough that her jaw drops slightly. Jade may be the most common of them all, it is true, but that even trace amounts, found in such a brief sojourn... In Facilitator's mind, Livia has clearly proven her worth.

A moment passes while Pillar processes the significance of Magical Material discovery. "Time anomaly," he eventually states, knowing that his mention of the jade recovered will add nothing not already known by all. "Is that usual?"

Gauntlet watches impassively. He confronted the Chief, forced the Facilitator, and tested Pillar. He is no longer enforcing the will of the Tripartite, but something else. It is gratifying to see his actions justified.

Livia watches at the probe curiously, seeming puzzled. It only came back with dirt? She looks back to the gate, frowning thoughtfully and tapping her lip. She clearly doesn't understand the excitement. Even the Chief's frown eases into something that is, well, actually just a less displeased frown. "Analyze it!" he barks. "I'll expect a full report in the hour. Shut the lid!" He turns, already heading back to his office. As he goes, he says to Gauntlet, "Put her back in her room when you are done with her." He takes another step and adds, far less willingly, "And tell her she did well." With a grunt the Chief hurries away, muttering under his breath about that 'damned woman'.

"She has performed her role. We will perform ours soon," whispers Gauntlet.
