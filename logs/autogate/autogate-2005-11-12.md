# AutoGate 2005-11-12

"It is a most auspicious day!" The Chief has used those words no less than three times already in his speech. One would think the alchemical had never sent anyone through a gate before, for all the fervor he shows. Still, in front of so many critical eyes, it's obvious that politics are coming before practicality.

Facilitator observes the Chief's oration intently and takes mental notes. Her own early training had covered such subjects, but (as she is quickly learning) there is no substitute for the real thing.

The opening is to take place in two hours. Everything is ready. The team has spent nearly every waking moment since the probe returned in preparations for this day. Even Livia has been allowed out of her cell to see that the gate is ready. Analysis of the collections made previously leave no doubt. There is jade on the other side. There is hope that other magical materials might be found, as well, though the reason for such speculation is shaky at best.

Of course, even with everything being ready, there has been a bit of a hiccup in the process. As the Chief so sweetly put it, "Those high-up idiots are slapping on a last second addition to the group. They aren't satisfied with things. They want an Archon, and they've picked the name out for us." The file indicated the impressive background of a Shining One. The name is Design, and none here have ever heard of this new team member. Considering such a thing disturbing the plans for the 'auspicious day', the Chief's been remarkably mild. At least through his speech. Once that little detail is over, he gathers those Alchemicals he brought together to his office for some final instructions.

The Chief is far more comfortable back in his office. "Now listen! This Design person showed up only a few hours ago. He's been your normal Archon, bothering people about details and being falsely modest." Hopefully nobody laughs at the Chief for describing a fellow Archon that way. "Anyway, you keep an eye on him. We don't know what they want him to do, nor why he's being added at the last second. Just watch yourselves out there."

"Yes, sir," says Facilitator non-committally. It's come to something when the group will have to be wary of its own ranks as much as of any outside threat... but hardly unusual, for Autochthonial. Many expeditions into the Reaches have been no different, after all. But it's still a little disturbing that this sort of thing is going to continue in an expedition to a place that (if Livia's nature is any guide) will be far stranger than anything the Reaches can offer.

"We will ensure.. he is no threat," whispers Gauntlet.

Pillar simply nods to this. Their missions will surely prove dangerous; another Exalt is welcome aid for now, motives behind his assignment aside. Still, as the formalities and speech-giving took place, Pillar was idle - even bored, though this is not a state his posture would ever betray. He is now more interested, as talk of action begins. Let the formalities be covered and appearances satisfied, he thinks, and their team sent. It is then that his role shall begin.

"Good," says the Chief, adding his customary grunt. "We have a little time left before the gate will be opened. I have things to do. You should all head for the chamber and wait there. It wouldn't be wise to not show up early on such an auspicious day." He frowns deeply, "And make sure she is there, by the Maker! All we need now is for her to wander off on us!"

---

The group passes down the corridors to the Gate in silence. These Chosen of Autochthon have not yet worked as a team before, so there is little in common yet for them to discuss. Perhaps, should they survive their missions together, a camaraderie will develop. But for now... Facilitator is the first to speak. "It is good to have an Archon alongside us, regardless of his origin. We now lack only a Protean to become a perfect Assembly."

The Alchemical's footfalls ring clearly across the facility as they walk, and all know where the revived heroes are headed. A mortal man attending one of the checkpoints they must pass through offers a grin of encouragement - or, perhaps, of hope. Pillar draws alongside Facilitator, eventually taking up his statement. "Given the reaction that the assignment of 'Design' has triggered, perhaps it's best we lack one of the Moonsilver Caste."

Facilitator smiles. "My own assignment was nearly as... abrupt as Design's has been," she says, nodding to Gauntlet. "We are an Assembly of necessity, not long-range planning."

Gauntlet has said little so far. Now the creepy construct voices what may be his most expressive opinion. "Caste is not the problem. Planning is not the problem. Political affiliation is. We are unlikely to face worse dangers beyond the door than we are here - because no matter how carefully we plan, we can never face the unknown fully prepared. Yet that is exactly what many politicians do - shut down things they have no knowledge of, acting without forethought."

Pillar has little to offer on the matters of politics and the manoeuvrings of the powers that be. A long moment passes before anything more is said. "I've noticed some reluctance to divulge information on the matter of previous excursions through the gate," he eventually offers. "Information is vital to efficiency. My task is to fight for your protection and interests - and neither may survive if I cannot perform my job as best as it can be done." He addresses this mostly to Gauntlet, for he has heard that the Soulsteel Exalt ventured through the gate once before.

"That information is restricted," hisses Gauntlet as he walks. "Even to me."

---

Lockdown follows the team as they proceed ever deeper into the facility, ending with the slamming of the last door as the Chief enters the gate room. Livia is at the controls, as would be expected, but five new 'engineers' are positioned around her, all heavily armed. Rather than helpful team member, she seems more like a prisoner. A pair of Archons stand not far away from the Chief on the control deck, watching silently, wrapped-up in an arrogance that needs no words to express. It's clear that more than a few changes have come to the mission.

Gauntlet is passive, patient, and unruffled. He dispassionately observes the two Archons, the guards around Livia, and the tense atmosphere that has begun to grow. _Unnecessary. Such a waste,_ he thinks to himself.

"Make final preparations," barks the Chief. He doesn't like this one bit. In addition to this, Design is waiting near the gate as well. All gear for the team is waiting here, some to be put on now, some perhaps to be put on later. "You know the drill. It's up to you now. Good luck."

Taking a moment from such thoughts, Gaunt steps aside and retrieves a rather thick carrying-case from the 'cargo' assembled for the mission. He sheds his leathers and boots, then opens the case and withdraws the deeply vermillion garment within. It wavers gently, teasing the eye as it moves, and the black, soot-stained Enforcer begins to don it. On go a pair of soulsteel razor-gloves, and on goes the head-piece, covering the eyes and ears with sensors. Finally, the light, rippling cloak that comes with the suit is fastened on. Gaunt would be an imposing sight to look at, if his observers could fasten onto him at all fully.

Facilitator blinks, as the strange armor confuses her visual apparatus, then nods to the Chief, collecting her own (rather less imposing) equipment - a pair of gyro-chakrams, starmetal bracers, and a fiber-weave bodysuit, which reshapes itself into an ordinary-looking cloak as she dons it. Although she is capable of defending herself, she is not so potent as her teammates; her role is to be prepared for the contingency of encountering intelligent life beyond the portal. Probability: unknown.

Looking about at the adjustments to gate protocol apprehensively, Pillar cannot feel comfortable with them. An enforced adherence to standard process does not favour an operation that deals with the unknown and variable. He gives Gauntlet's new garment an interested glance, but no more. Pillar finds himself feeling certain that the item's capabilities will come to light in time.

An almost imperceptible flutter appears by Facilitator, and lands upon her shoulder. It takes a closer inspection to notice the crystal fly that makes its way to rest unobtrusively against her collar. An extra pair of eyes, where no eyes can be seen, could be vital on this mission.

Pillar strides over to a group of bewildered-looking assistants, standing alongside a large crate. He reaches them, lifting the lid and grinning broadly. Inside lies a veritable mountain of jade plates; the Stone Hand's Essence already flows within them from harmonization conducted earlier in preparation. At the instructions of a senior engineer and with Pillar's aid, the men begin to lift the armoured plates into place upon his body.

A few minutes later, the process is complete. The aids stand back, and whirring fills the air as bolts extend from Pillar's own body to affix the armour, bonding it immovably to the Exalt's frame. He flexes his hands experimentally with a smile, before reaching into the crate one last time and withdrawing a jade weapon of prodigious size - a Great Beamaxe, the likes of which few have seen even in Autochthonia. He is prepared.

Livia, despite the added entourage, looks rather pleased, now that her 'friends' have arrived. The guards about her may seem imposing, but something she murmurs to them gets them all laughing, their stances shifting as they relax. That little exchange causes the observing Archons to look at each other, and for once someone looks less pleased than the Chief. Her voice turns just a little more serious, "I am prepared. At your word, Gauntlet," she says calmly.

"Do it," Gaunt rasps. He flexes his hands in the razor-claws.

There is something different when Livia opens the gate, this time. It's clear that they are altering what she does, and it makes her usual smile fade as she has to concentrate. The focus wavers, and everyone in the room can feel something of a backwash, as if the very air was bending and flexing, then being released, leaving a strange sense of vibration and shifting. At last, the gate is settled, the surface still. An ominous silence settles over the room.

Gaunt does not hesitate. His fate lies beyond; he walks toward the gate.

"Let's do this," Pillar rumbles, swinging his axe to rest upon his back. He follows Gaunt towards the gate's surface.

The Archon Design enters without a word, confidence glowing in his eyes.

Facilitator follows behind, wordlessly, her hands loose at her sides, ready to take up the gyro-chakrams at a moment's notice.

---

Passing through a gate is an experience quite different from anything else. It begins with an utter absence of sensation. There is simply nothing to feel, nothing to notice, everything is utterly gone, leaving an emptiness in its wake, and in that void, time also vanishes. Hours, minutes, seconds, there is simply no way to tell.

Whether it ends suddenly or gradually, every Alchemical finds it hard to stay on their feet as they reach the other side. Stumbling or even falling is the norm. It takes a few seconds to just get a grasp of perceptions again, and then the area can be seen. In all directions, the land is one of color. A sky of brilliant blue is above and in all directions there are rolling hills of grass. Straight ahead the hills rise steadily, trees at first lightly dotting them, and then coating them in a dense forest as they climb into the distance. The working of the probe is immediately obvious, as the ground nearby has been dug into for samples. It takes some time for the exalts to realize that Design isn't there with them.

The filters of Gauntlet's armor snap shut immediately as he crouches, staring upward - the first instinctive response to an unshielded power supply. It takes him moments to regain his wits, to realize that there is no immediate danger.

Facilitator takes a few steps sideways, clutching at her head - even through the arc protectors, the light from all directions is impossibly bright. As she recovers her balance and her senses, she looks around her. "Those... green things... I've seen some strange things, but those are the strangest machines I've ever seen. Are they some sort of heat radiators or something? What do you think, Design? ...Design?"

The ground shakes slightly as one of Pillar's booted feet slams into the ground, maintaining the Executive's balance. He squints in the light, looking around at his immediate surroundings. "He's missing."

"He is either here in this place, or he is not," concludes Gauntlet. "If here, we need to leave signs of our presence. Autolabes?"

"He went in before me," says Facilitator. "His absence makes no sense." She whispers to her collar, buzzing and humming, and the crystal fly makes a brief, tinkling chirp as it lifts off from her shoulder and begins to spiral outward in a search pattern. This attended to, she reaches into her pack and adjusts her own autolabe, taking a few steps to one side and confirming that it is still pointing toward Gauntlet. "Mine is functional."

Gesturing toward the trees, the Enforcer whispers, "Recon. We return shortly. Agreed?"

Shaking his head to indicate the absence of an Autolabe, Pillar speaks. "If the Archon was ejected elsewhere, it might only be a slight deviation," he muses. "Agreed."

Facilitator nods to Gauntlet. "Agreed." This is a matter of exploration tactics - not her field, but Gauntlet's. She defers to him.

"Facilitator, Pillar. Go that way." Gauntlet gestures at an angle. "I will go the other. When we reach the boundary between terrain, we converge on each other via autolabe. Pillar, mark this spot for us please."

Facilitator adjusts her own autolabe, switching its mode - it now will point to the location where Facilitator is standing now. "Autolabe return mode enabled. Pillar, I will need you to take the lead."

Testing the yielding earth with one foot, Pillar takes a marker from the team's supplies and shrugs. It is designed to be fixed onto the metal environments of Autochthon, and here the magnetising device will not work. He rams it into the ground, and the device remains upright. "Follow me," he replies, and moves to begin the search.

The way is not short, and it takes some adjusting to get used to soft, yielding turf. At least the light levels are good, thanks to the strange disc of gold in the sky above. There is no sign of other foot prints in any direction, and no sign of life other than plants. The air moves in a steady, strong breeze that bends the tops of the trees, though the sky is clear.

There are two distinct things that can be noticed. The first is uncovered by the Hammer of Autochton, when he notices a sound like a leaking steam duct. It's screeching is more a controlled pitch, rising higher and louder, than hanging at that level before swooping down three times. The sound of course is noticed by the Facilitator as well, but is Pillar who is able to spot a small red machine sitting high in the branches of a tree.

While Gauntlet approaches the imposing wall of trees, a small break in the green of leaves can be noticed. What at first appears to be every bit as solid an area as the rest is revealed to be the beginnings of a path, with only a few smaller bushes growing over it. Though it seems at first to be little wider than the span of the Blessed of Ku's arms, a little deeper inspection reveals that shortly past this opening the path is both very clear and far wider. Whatever made the path, it did not take the time to do anything more than beat down the trees and bushes that might otherwise block the way.

With a bewildered expression on his face, Pillar points the source of the noise out to Facilitator. "What a strange thing," he remarks. "I wonder what purpose it serves."

"How curious," Facilitator murmurs. "A maintenance drone, perhaps? Presumably brightly colored as a warning signal. Perhaps we should steer clear of this device it rests on - maybe it's malfunctioning." She shakes her head. Its strange noises are clearly some form of signal, but none she is familiar with, so it serves no discernible purpose, at present.

The trail is interesting, possibly meaningful, and should be followed up on. Not alone, though. To that end Gauntlet begins tracking the others using his own Autolabe, hurrying across the plain at the edge of the forest.

Along the way, both sides hear more of that strange noise from the wood. While at least two of the sounds are very similar (clearly belonging to the same or related machines) at least three other distinct audio patterns can be detected, though the sources are currently too far in to be seen without closer inspection.

Gauntlet puts down the Autolabe when the others draw near. He approaches still closer, so that his whispers can be heard. "A path, through this growth," he explains, gesturing behind him.

There's a brief sparkle in the sky, and the crystal fly flutters onto Facilitator's shoulder. The chirp is brief, but distinctly negative - no sign of Design. "We should follow it," says Facilitator.

Energy crackles along a set of jade nodules on Pillar's face as he moves to meet up with Gauntlet, and the Executive is inspecting the environs. He shakes his head to Facilitator after a moment - the Cross-Phase Scanner has failed to turn up data - and answers Gaunt. "Lead the way."

The Enforcer does so. Once again he stands before the entrance to the 'path', with his companions beside him. "Within, visibility is reduced. I will go by stealth and stay near to you. If you are attacked, I may counter-ambush."

The path is certainly going to restrict visibility. On either side the trees and bushes provide a great deal of cover. Above the branches lock together, the light far more subdued on this path than away. Even to the untrained eye, it's clear that a lot of different feet have moved over this trail, though no tracks that resemble the exalts can be made out. At first, the path is straight as an arrow, rising steadily, but providing no difficulty for the hardy Chosen of Autochton to follow. Still, a very sharp bend lies ahead, and with the foliage thick as it is, it is hard to see what might lie beyond.

Gauntlet emerges from the trees to report in. "Creatures, eating what grows from the ground," he rasps. "Probably harmless." And with that, he disappears into the foliage again.

As the best equipped to deal with an assault, Pillar has taken the lead. The Blessed of Runel trusts in his Charms, armour and natural fortitude to deal with possible danger, treading with no attempt at stealth and leaving his weapon stowed upon his back. In this case, he decides, more overt attempts to deal with danger might attract it.

When the others round that bend, they find that the creatuers Gauntlet had detected are not there, though they can likely tell they were. The right side of the path has been treated rather roughly, as it seems whatever was here made for quite the hasty retreat. A few moments later, the wind picks up, the noise of rubbing leaves concealing all other sounds.

"I see no conduit," murmurs Facilitator, almost as softly as Gaunt's whisper. "Perhaps it was buried deep in this dirt, for protection?" Food comes from conduits, after all - everyone knows that.

The Enforcer hears nothing of this whisper, for he is still concealed by his armor and by the terrain. Wariness is useless where there is no danger, but relaxation is more useless still when there is.

Nodding, Pillar replies. "Our approach seems to have sent the feeders into flight," he states. "They have left, have hidden or have gone to seek aid." A shrug. "In any case, we have more productive things to tend to." And he continues along.

Under cover, Gauntlet engages the armor's stealth systems, and he approaches as near as he dare without breaking cover to deliver a hissed warning - "Magical creatures approach!" - before ducking back in.

That is all the warning there is. Suddenly the undergrowth shudders and out of it charge five beasts, all going on four legs, shaped like wolves but each bearing the color of a magical material. The beast of jade is a mingling of shades, so that its body shows signs of all the forms of jade. They do not slow, nor is their intent hard to guess with glowing fangs bared.

Pillar tenses, glancing back and adjusting his stance so as to shield the more vulnerable Vizier from the initial charge, before unslinging the Grand Beamaxe from his shoulder. As the Stone Hand pours Essence into it, the blade crackles to life and is raised for use.

Set to strike out at the leading wolf before its own attack can hit home, Pillar's glowing axe whirls effortlessly in his hands; the white blade leaves an imprint of its circular path upon the eyes of observers. _Strike true,_ Pillar urges of himself. _Gaunt performs his task, and Facilitator will. Protection is yours._

The dog takes the blow, rolling back and growling. Pillar can tell that it's not just a matter of appearance. That thing has a jade hide. The wound lets out a 'blood' of pure essence that shimmers in the air as the creature maintains a defensive stance.

From out of the underbrush behind the 'wolf'-creatures, leaves explode in a shower. A red shadow has burst forth, vaulting sideways toward an acrobatic handstand. Gauntlet's hands are filled with his plasma weapons, and his body arcs with dark lightning as his anima banner lights up with a sudden explosion of power. He discharges the first, with the angry green gobbet of energy streaking toward the soulsteel beast. He flings the weapon out of his hand as his body begins to rotate into an upside-down position, and his now-empty hand thrusts downward to push off the ground. The gun in his other hand discharges itself as well as his augmented muscles drive him back into the air, and the final arc of his spin takes him past the wobbling plasma gun. He snatches out of the air, disappearing again into the trees.

Caught utterly unawares, the dog of soulsteel lets out a horrible baying noise as the plasma tears huge gaps into its carapace. The force of the blow is such that the dog is not knocked off its feet, but rather has large portions of its torso shorn from its body. Yet there is some life left in it, malice that burns without reason, a hunger that is still not fed, and so it charges towards Pillar, the mountain of an exalt facing a leaping beast with fangs that scream with trapped souls.

As the remnants of the Soulsteel beast charge towards him, Pillar moves with surprising speed. Reversing his grip, he plants the blade of his beamaxe solidly into the earth, using it as a lever to vault over the creature's charge. His landing is thunderous, and he tears the axe free again with a shower of dirt, returning it to a readied grasp.

With the upward motion of Pillar the path is clear for the last three dogs to attack who they will, save the red dart that has vanished out of their reach. The shimmering form of gold bears down on the Facilitator, rising suddenly on its hind legs as it lashes out with its monstrous paws.

There's nothing for it - an attack by these magical beasts will surely be able to penetrate the fiberweave she wears. So she will need more active defenses. Two starmetal disks eject themselves from their hips, their glittering blades snapping into place as they slot into her waiting fingers, and she lowers herself into a crouch, the starmetal glinting in the forest light as she brings the gyro-chakrams to bear against the beast's attack.

The smell of ozone is strong in the air as a sparking blue nimbus emerges around Facilitator's form, azure lightning coursing along her limbs and giving her already lithe form uncanny flexibility.

It seems to the beasts that their foes are quite prepared. The final two to strike move as one, attacking the Jade Alchemical in tandem, a strange arch of essence connecting them for just a moment as they lash out with teeth enhanced now by shining essence.

Pillar's bulky form is disadvantaged in avoidance among such confines, yet a combination of innate grace, magic and long practice comes to the fore. He digs his feet into the earth, flexing them and pushing the ground away for backwards propulsion. Gyros whine in protest at the feat, yet hold: only the best for Autochthon's heroes.

Powerful jaws snap shut a hair's breadth from the Jade Hand, yet he flies free - if only just. The great Beamaxe is held in one hand to counterbalance the landing, with comes with heavy thud; clods of earth are sent up as the Executive slides backwards before regaining balance.

The trees shower leaves over the ground as Gauntlet attacks from ambush again - although his presence is clearly heralded this time, for his anima banner is fully in its dark bloom. Arcs of lightning criss-cross the red suit, and in the sudden shadows they cast, faces contorted into ghastly expressions can be faintly seen. With a light kick he lands and vaults from the ground again, landing atop the back of the Orichalcum predator. Both guns clasped tightly, he aims straight down and discharges two plasma bolts at once.

Vaulting from the thing's back as it twists, his plasma exploding beneath his feet, Gauntlet falls to earth in a crouch. His left hand rakes across the thing's side, the soulsteel razor claws howling to bite deep. This time, Gauntlet does not retreat. He does sprint away from the melee in the wake of his swing, however, taking advantage of his superior speed to create distance.

Rising from his crouch, Pillar looks to the magical animals with the fires of grim determination in his eyes. Setting the blade firmly in line with his body, his legs shift backwards and bend in readiness; an anima begins to build, wreathing the Stone Hand with jade-hued energy and the sound of gears. He explodes into motion, blade beginning to twirl in an offensive pattern for greater momentum when the axe connects.

The three blows put a serious dent in the shape of the orichalcum hound, first shearing off a large part of its head, then shattering a section of its shoulder, and finally chopping off a gleaming ear of gold. The beast falls back farther with each strike, and though maimed, still has the determined fire of rage in its eyes.

This ground battle is not for Facilitator - it is time for her to take to the air. One of her gyrochakrams flies from her left hand in a low spinning arc, buzzing its way toward the wounded golden beast, but the other she keeps with her as she begins to run, and then leap - aiming for one of the horizontal, grayish-brown branches projecting (growing?) from one of the strange structures in this land. Her muscles are not so developed as her companions, but as she jumps, her other blade is swung into the thick substance. She's only had a brief chance to study these things, so she has to hope that the stuff is soft enough for the blades to bite, but hard enough to support her weight and allow her to haul herself up.

Adrenaline granting her truly uncanny agility, Facilitator sticks her chakram deep into the branch, and as it digs in, she hauls herself up, somersaulting into the air, and landing on the branch with perfect balance. She bends down to pull that blade free, and looks up just in time to watch the other chakram rip through the hound's orichalcum flesh. The disk arcs back and flies unerringly toward her, and she daintily plucks it from the air.

With the golden hound the only one removed from offensive action, the remnant of the pack can coordinate. Pillar again sees the same glow he did last time, only this time it springs between all four of his attackers, a pair of attacks lashing out at him from both right and left as the beasts try to drag him down as a flurry of silver, jade, starmetal and shrieking soulsteel are unleashed against him.

The claws and teeth come in, and Pillar moves deftly away, form contorting from the lines of attack. The banner above him becomes more pronounced, as ordered shapes and patterns begin to coalesce from the roaring energy. Jade armour plates grind and shriek; the jade-clad mountain grits his teeth, as mind and body and magic work together against the creatures and their own uncanny unity.

The claw of a magical dog smashes against Pillar's armour, and the jade Alchemical offers it a nasty grin. "Not hard enough, my friend," he growls, bringing his axe to the fore and sweeping it in a wide, glowing arc through one of his attackers - it then arcs back around, making another pair of strikes against the same. "Try again!"

The Hammer of Autochton strikes hard and true, and his foe is sent flying with the force of the blow, the jade form shattering the trunk of a tree. The creature pushes itself to its feet with some effort, though the glow in its eyes is far less focused than before.

The hound of orichalcum has to duck out of the way of his flying packmate, but seems unwilling to backdown, its instincts far too powerful. To kill or die. A far more terrible glowing pulses from it, and another wound opens as it launches itself not at Pillar, but into the trees, supernaturally agile paws making it at home above the ground as well, and its strike comes as leaps from above towards Facilitator, its maw wide.

From her perch in the tree, Facilitator can see the golden beast's use of Essence for what it is. But she is prepared. The two chakrams cross in front of her, her glinting eyes watching the monster in its leap - and just before it reaches her, she lets herself tip forward - when the thing hits, its momentum will push her back upright. If she does this right.

CLANG! Orichalcum fangs meet starmetal blades, and the attack is averted. The momentum of impact carries Facilitator back faster than she'd planned, but she contorts herself, diverting the beast's charge up and over her, letting it drop back down to the ground as she regains her balance, crossing the blades as she prepares for any other wolves to try that trick.

Gauntlet has not moved from his position taken moments ago, far from the pack of creatures that now assail Pillar. His eyes behind the visor flick upward, just for a moment, confirming that Facilitator is safe as well. _Dangerous things,_ he muses to himself, raising his plasma weapons. Now he darts forward, circling the outskirts of the battle to take aim, and sights at the soulsteel creature still capable of moving. His gun screams out as another plasma charge flies at the beast. The Essence-discharges that cover his body from head to toe spark forward as well, and a lance of the black lightning surrounds and sheaths the plasma, as though to carry his grim intent with it.

As the now-dead soulsteel beast pitches over from the force of the burst, Gauntlet takes aim just above it, at its orichalcum partner high in the trees. The second plasma weapon fires, again laced with the unwholesome energy that clings to his body, burning the air with an acrid and faintly necrotic smell.

The soulsteel is blasted into the dust, rolling uselessly to the bottom of a tree, it's essence departing utterly from its body at last. Above, the orichalcum beast is caught with another blast, knocking it from its perch to the ground below, where it slumps down, struggling to get to its feet again as it becomes tangled in the undergrowth.

The beasts can tell things are not going their way. Only two can strike out yet, and they focus once again on Pillar, who has been far too effective at killing them. Moonsilver and starmetal launch themselves at the exalt, burning all that remains of their essence on this last ditch pooling of strength, desperate to at least maim the pack that seems on the brink of destroying them.

A feral grin has fixed itself on Pillar's face as the combat progresses - clearly, the warrior takes great joy from the fight. As the beasts lunge in, the Jade-Caste rolls out to one side, aiming past and behind his aggressors. Dust is kicked up by the movement, and his fluxing anima turns the ground to a white path of residual jade where the roll goes.

The red-suited assassin flickers as he maneuvers into a clear line of fire. As before his plasma weapons shout their message of death, illuminating his crimson-cloaked face in the process.

Gauntlet backs off as both creatures' death-rattles signal an end to their personal hostilities, mindful that he has only a single shot left per weapon. He crackles with power now, his Essence usage now sending lightning-arcs surging forth amidst an acrid smoke that has begun to billow from his joints.

Risen from his roll, Pillar fixes his weapon into a guard position and holds. His eyes, as always, are on the enemies set before him. _I must attack at an unguarded moment,_ he thinks. _I have seen no magical avoidance. Without such things, they cannot avoid in the moment of the strike._ And so, he waits, with the immeasurable patience of an Executive.

Facilitator is impressed; Pillar has more than lived up to his design specs, simultaneously harassing the monstrous dogs and weathering their attacks with hardly a scratch. But even the greatest warrior can use an advantage, and it is the way of the Starmetal Caste to put the slightest weight on the balance to tip it in their favor. A humming sound haunts the grove, and Facilitator glows with the light of an intricate, alien mandala as her two gyrochakrams spiral toward the two remaining foes. Either they will distract the beasts for Pillar's killing strike, or they will strike for maximum effect.

With so much of the pack down, the remnants still hold together well. Their attention shifts from the impregnable mountain of Jade to the troublesome pest in the tree. Though they cannot coordinate in quite the way they had, they are able to work together still. The might of the moonsilver is thrown against the trunk of the Facilitator's tree and the other attacks just a moment later, selecting this moment as the most opportune to bring its starmetal jaws to bear.

Facilitator teeters, and can only dive for the ground, hoping to avoid the bulk of the falling trunk above her. Distracted, she is vulnerable, ironically, to the attack of the hound whose composition matches her own...

_This is the moment!_ A blaze of Essence and raw power surges from Pillar as the pair of creatures moves to assault Facilitator's tree, and he surges forward to catch their charge. A cry of battle is torn from the Jade-Caste's mouth, powerful wrath augmented by the sound of clashing gears as his anima roars assent; his axe sweeps from below in a powerful upwards arc. It moves through, then out to sweep across, and finally held overhead and chopping downwards.

Each blow strikes; the hapless creature's form shudders, chunks of metal tearing free in the wake of Pillar's ferocious assault. The final blow utterly shatters the beast, and shards of Starmetal fly to all corners of the field of battle. Pillar's eyes move around, and he fixes his glare upon the Moonsilver hound.

"Thank you," says Facilitator, smiling at her Jade savior, climbing to her feet and rubbing her shoulder - the linkages there were strained by the impact, which she hadn't quite managed to roll away from.

Before the final shard of Starmetal falls, Pillar is in motion again. Each thud of boot against earth is a death knell; the Jade Caste emits a low growl the entire time, glowing axe-blade swept to point towards the ground. In the moment before impact, he leaps unexpectedly, and it is the blade of his weapon that descends first, aiming to smash the creature to the ground. Viciously, it raises to pound at the hound twice more.

The Starmetal creature was shattered; this one is not so much disassembled by the force of Pillar's blows as deformed beyond all function. Smaller pieces of Moonsilver come free, and the main form is bent so far out of shape that an observer - unknowing of its shape beforehand - would be hard-pressed to recognise it. Light fades from the beast's eyes. Pillar takes a stride off the mess, grinning and giving his companions a nod.

Gauntlet reloads his plasma pistols and slaps them back into their half-concealed holsters on his belt. "A good job," he murmurs, still radiant with his Essence-exertions. "We should recycle them."

Facilitator raises her own hands, catching the gyrochakrams with both hands and returning them to her belt. "The speculations proved true - there is more than just jade here. In dangerous forms, to be sure." She looks around. "I hope that Design did not encounter a pack of these alone... wherever he may be."

Pillar nods, and the blade of his deactivates with a sharp hiss. He stows the weapon across his back once more. He looks to Gaunt. "Do we continue the search, or first recover these remains?"

"Recover the remains," Gaunt whispers. "Time to refresh our Essence and to reduce our anima. Then we continue."

At the gate point, the marker is still waiting, and the ground is undisturbed. With the circle returning, the gate opens again, it's shimmering light more welcoming this time than the last, perhaps.

Through the great strength afforded to Pillar naturally and Gauntlet via his armor, and through the cleverness of Facilitator in load arrangement, the three intact Alchemicals have managed to recover the majority of the Magical Material components of their once-adversaries. By consensus this material will be transmitted back through the gate as an early prize, of sorts.

There is some discussion as to the questions that its SHAPE will raise. Fortunately, not returning with the goods forestalls an immediate inquiry.

"We should make a report before continuing the search," says Facilitator. As Gauntlet prepares the wolf-bodies for transit. A brief note is transcribed, conveying the progress of the expedition to date with as much tact and brevity as possible. The gist of the note is: Design did not emerge from the Gate with us; we encountered these beings during our search; we remain beyond the gate to recharge and resume the search.
