# AutoGate 2005-11-26

The three Alchemicals who have managed to come through discuss the matter further. Gauntlet suggests returning to the path, on the grounds that it is clearly a deliberate, or at least well-trafficked, route, and also that it has yielded the best source of Magical Materials for effort expended thusfar.

With no disagreement, the stealthy Sentinel resumes his earlier practice of obscurity as the group reaches the woods and passes inward.

"Such a strange smell the air has," muses Facilitator quietly. "Not unpleasant, just... strange. No hint of smoke at all." No emotional content accompanies these words - probably because Facilitator has not yet decided which emotion is appropriate to the situation.

The path is more subdued now. It seems that the battle earlier has driven off the birds, and the Assembly sees no sign of further troubles--for the moment.

As the Assembly continues on the way, signs of very old stonework are apparent. Here and there along the path are shattered monuments, some of which bear carved characters that are unfamiliar to the Chosen of Autochthon. The greatest of these comes when the path forks. On the right, it begins to rise, while to the left it seems to stay level. At the middle of this fork is a ten foot column of some black stone. The carvings here are far more clear than those passed thus far, though they are still in a language that is not known to the Assembly.

Facilitator receives a simple nod from Pillar, who has taken the lead once more. The warrior's eyes rove about as they walk - searching not so much for danger, as that which escapes Gaunt's notice would likely escape Pillar's - but taking in the sights.

In turn, the Vizier takes the intelligent glyphs as a cue for a different precaution. With a moment's concentration, the magical constructions that are the Alchemical trademark submerge, Facilitator's clay flesh closing over them. A final pulse from her soulgem adds a semblance of human warmth to her features.

Stepping out of the trees, Gauntlet uses a hand to dismissively brush a fe spare twigs from his crimson armor. "Left," he proposes.

With no cause for dissent, nor Charms to conceal his identity, Pillar moves to follow the left-hand path. He eyes the stone column uneasily as he passes.

Facilitator increases her pace slightly so that she now walks beside Pillar, deeming this position more suitable for the guise she intends to present - a mortal woman with a magical bodyguard.

The left path seems to be skirting its way about the rising terrain, rather than curving to meet it. The path here seems less travelled, and as the Assembly follows it the sound of the strange flying creatures earlier returns, though the thickness of the foliage makes it hard to get much more than a brief glance. The stone work also grows less. There's a sense that the farther the Chosen march along the path, the older the work is, so that soon they are passing ruined stone that has been weathered so much that the carvings cannot be discerned.

The path as well seems older, so that here and there it is nearly choked by bushes and creepers. It seems unlikely that anyone has been this way in some time. After a while of following this path it grows still more densely choked by plants, but there is also a building noise, not unlike that made in the largest and most heavily pressurived conduits, only louder still, and quite constant. The Assembly has cause to stop when the path seems finally to be undone and a wall of green stands before them, the bushes and trees packed so very tightly that what lies beyond is uncertain.

"Possibly something lies beyond. Possibly shielded by this growth. Or that may be coincidental." Gauntlet's whisper is barely audible over the noise, and he must lean close to make himself heard - and he is not a desirable presence to have near. He backs off at last, relying on gesture by pointing and shrugging. _Forge ahead, or retreat?_

Facilitator nods toward the thick overgrowth, and makes a parting motion. _We press on._

"We've come this far," Pillar rumbles in agreement, unslinging and hefting his great weapon, then resting it upon a shoulder.

Holding up a hand, then, Gauntlet engages his Personal Gravity Manipulation Apparatus. With it engaged, he hops toward the tree and asserts a new "down", then begins scuttling up the trunk like a vermillion spider.

A minute passes. Gauntlet emerges from the green coverage and drops to the ground easily, reporting with both hands and voice. "An unattended leak," he explains, gesturing with his hands to show water falling.

"There may be more of interest. If not, we turn back," suggests Gauntlet, then turns to examine the foliage. _Better to cut through or go over?_ he muses.

Finally he decides. "I will return shortly, to see if this is worth our time." And again he scuttles away.

After the wall of green is passed, the foliage is not very thick at all. It seems the fluid of the leak gathers in a large channel and flows very swiftly to left and away, following a bend that carries it farther away still. Along the length of it are fragments of old pottery, some glinting quite brightly. Clearly they contain metals of some kind. There is a great deal of ruined stonework as well, and still more of that writing. For whatever reason, it seems to be more clear here, at least as recently made as the standing stone at the fork in the path.

Gauntlet kneels down to take a few samples of the pottery, for later analysis perhaps. He carefully wraps them up, sliding them into a protected pouch on his belt, all the while wondering about the place the four - no, three - have found themselves in.

Gauntlet closely examines one of the nearest stones, finding it to be in almost pristine shape, the writing bold and well-carved. Or at least it is, until he moves a little closer. Gauntlet touches it a little too hard as the ground below him shifts rather abruptly, a spot of soft mud where it seemed at first quite firm, and the work, unable to take this sudden stress, cracks and crumbles away. Fortunately there are still other stones that may be examined that seem much like this.

There's not a great deal more to find, though it seems that the pottery here does have something hopeful on it. Even to the untrained eye, the glint of orichalcum lines on the more richly designed pottery is clear. There is not a great deal here, however. Altogether this is likely to be no more than half the orichalcum of the pelt that was taken back.

Satisfied, Gauntlet makes his way back to the group via the circuitous route of before, and explains what he has found.

"The pattern of the orichalcum inlays may be more important than the metal itself," Facilitator comments. "It would tell us whether the indigenous inhabitants realize and make use of the magical properties of the substance, or if they merely use it for ornamentation." The latter seems unlikely, of course. "Let us return, and try the other path." This time, Facilitator pulls a notepad from her pack, and on the way down the path she will copy down some of the glyphs on the rocks. Perhaps, with more powerful analysis engines, it will be possible to discern patterns in the symbols, and possibly even make a start at translation. It is in this, more than anything else, that she regrets Design's absence.

With that settled, Gauntlet suggests examining the other path.

Primitive pottery and masonry would seem to indicate a culture that poses little threat to the Alchemical explorers. Still, they possess the ability to work magical materials, and the hounds cannot be discounted. Among the seeming-wasteland of a perhaps-lost civilisation, Pillar retains caution.

The other path is quite easy to find, of course. No tracks are seen on the way back to indicate more of those beasts, and the song of those flying creatures grows louder as the light starts to fail. It's hard to say how many hours of daylight are left. Fortunately, the path, though it rises swiftly, seems to be in remarkably good shape. Even more pleasantly the fading light makes the Assembly feel that much more at home.

The splendor of the stonework and the frequency of it increase. The path, if anything, is climbing faster still, and from time to time it leads to spiralling stairways of cut stone. Curiously, these works seem utterly untouched by the passing of time, though everything else has been worn away by the winds.

Now more than ever, Facilitator is glad of the hulking Jade-caste by her side, and the unseen Sentinel. From the look of things, the probability of encountering sapient life is ever-mounting, and given that she and they will probably not share a language, it is reassuring to have physical force as a backup.

After following the path for at least an hour it finally evens off, curving out near a ledge that allows the Assembly to look back down at the forest they have just traversed. The steam of the distant waterflow can be seen as a pale bit of white lit up now by dim pinpricks of light that hang high in the sky. Even in this failing light the Autochthonians can see that the path is leading towards a great city of stone. It is some miles away yet, but its massive size makes it very easy to see.

"More relics of a vanished culture, or something more.. occupied?" whispers Gauntlet, ominously.

Pillar's grip shifts, and he grunts softly. "Let's find out."

"There should be activity associated with occupation," opines Facilitator. "Smoke, at least. Let us investigate."

Gauntlet nods. "Facilitator is prepared for human occupants. I will go and find out what awaits - if anything. We will enter as required."

His cloak and armor support Gauntlet as he darts rapidly toward the city, concealing his presence and blurring his location. The armor's myriad subsystems respond to every environmental condition their designers could have anticipated. Sounds, sight, heat, footsteps - all are minimized to the greatest possible degree. And behind that industrial prowess, guiding it, is the rebuilt mind of a Soulsteel Alchemical. Although he does not have the years of experience the others do, he has what Thosh taught him as he floated blankly in the vats. He has the dreams of the hunter-inquisitor he once was. And he has the whispers of his body, disturbing in their accurate direction of his movements and decisions.

Minutes pass as Gauntlet explores the ruins, no more substantial than the ghosts of memories that lurk here. He catalogs everything he sees, and finally in a moment of theatricality piles together clumps of dirt into the largest pile he can make. Working near the entrance, he forms what can only be a deliberate marker - an arrow, pointing out of the massive metropolis. With that done, he leaves, and in a few minutes reports back to his companions.

"We must return, or stay." Gauntlet is finished explaining the situation he found; he is now considering alternatives in his rasping half-heard voice. "If we stay, we must eat. The city may yield more interesting information, but is devoid of human contact for the moment.. We..."
