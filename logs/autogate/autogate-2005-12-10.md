# AutoGate 2005-12-10

Gauntlet has good reason to surveil the city alone. When he returns, what he brings is not only knowledge from the abandoned architecture, but also from the voices inside himself. Ever since his first trip through the Gate, the grim Sentinel has been 'haunted' by voices he has revealed to no one. Now their whispers seem of importance enough to relay, though he does not attribute the source of his newfound knowledge.

To Pillar and Facilitator he whispers, hunched over and drawing lines in the soil with one soot-blackened finger. His reedy voice struggles out of his mouth painfully, eerily retelling the last days of a vanished people. The citydwellers made sacrifices to some nameless entity drawn out of the well of the Void, while around the city, things neither man nor animal dwelt in the chaotic darkness.

At last, or so says the muttering Alchemical, every man's hand turned against every other. It was the shattering and dissolution of blasphemies perpetrated here, and the city has slept uneasily since that time, absolved of its sins through the final bloodshed.

Facilitator shudders - the Void is a dreadful word to the denizens of Autochthonia. "Meddling in forces they do not understand... what foolishness." She sighs. "Regrettable."

Pillar takes this in his stride, the furrowing of a concerned brow the only concession to shock or revulsion that he gives. When he came through the Gate, the Executive had already steeled himself for what the explorers might uncover. "What now?" he asks simply.

"Even Void-worshippers may have something of use," suggests Gauntlet. "Let us explore more fully."

Facilitator nods. "Let us have a care, though. There may be perils here that are more than physical."

With a flex of his hands, Pillar offers both Alchemicals a low rumble of assent.

The main street of the city is the most obvious way to go. Considering the rather immense bulk of one of the Alchemicals, there's not a great deal of choice, anyway. There are of course many things that do stick out. There are no pipes in this city, though deep ruts are dug into either side of the street, growing larger as the Assembly makes its way farther inside. The path winds slowly as it goes, and the buildings on either side grow steadily larger, until they are indeed enormous, each towering several stories and showing what must have been considered to those living there to be the finest in tastes. It is a rather sterile architecture, though, one of straight lines and very little elegance.

There are several large buildings, which makes it extremely hard to gauge just what is and what is not important to the people here. Still, one building does stick-out enough to draw the eye of even those without much knowledge of craft. Like the others, it is a structure of very banal, straight lines. If anything, it has even fewer curves. What stands out is the lack of columns. This building, unlike the others near it, has nothing extra. It is utterly efficient in design. This building must have had a true purpose of some kind.

The door is very large here, even letting Pillar to enter with room to spare. Many low tables are arranged here, and near each is a large box. The boxes are clearly of some sort of metal, and each is neatly padlocked. There's a thick layer of dust in this place, of course, and it rises with an almost wraithlike quality as it is disturbed. A few long abandoned cobwebs mar the corners, the husks of spiders long since worn away, though their tattered webs have not.

Facilitator brushes the dust away from one box, revealing the dull red of corrosion. "These boxes were not meant to stand the test of time," she says. "They will be open someday anyway, whether we will or no. Therefore, I suggest that we may as well open them now."

"Allow me," Pillar growls, approaching the nearest box. The bulky Jade-Caste appraises the container for a moment, weighing it up and evidently choosing the best approach. After a few moments of such deliberation, he brings one steel-booted foot down upon the rusted metal that the padlock supports.

With great power, comes great responsibility, they say. Similarly, with excessive force in aged ruins comes profoud disappointment. The chest gives way, that is to be sure. It's nearly reduced to dust. Then again, so is the floor. The force of the blow shatters it near the chest, and thus Pillar and Facilitator are cordially invited to a fall that guides them to the lower level of the building and a very deep darkness. In the cascading shower of dust, it's very hard to know just who is where, nor even where they are now.

Facilitator picks herself up - eerily, for those who do not know the ways of the Alchemicals, she does not begin to cough right away. Rather, the coughing begins only when she draws breath to speak, as the dust clogs her vocal systems. "Pillar? Gauntlet? Report!" The clouds of dust are suddenly lit with blue lightning, as she invokes her anima to give light.

Pillar ignites his anima, and into the darkness about him comes the grinding of gears and light of Runel's chosen. He mutters a few words that are certainly not a report, and grants Facilitator an apologetic look. "I'm here."

Facilitator adjusts her stance to get a better footing on the mountain of metal circles she appears to have landed in. But further analysis of the terrain is postponed for a moment. "Gauntlet is absent," she observes, fishing the autolabe out of her pack and observing the direction of the needle.

Pillar nods, sunk already to his ankles in metal. His coruscating anima flashes across the circular objects, and something catches the Exalt's eye. He bends, and when he stands a circle is clutched in his hand. It has the hue of white jade. "Facilitator," he murmurs, tossing the item to her. "Behold."

Facilitator gives a rare smile. "This must be a storehouse for valuable resources," she notes. "The storehouse was surely warded against magical scrying, and the wards must still be intact enough to confuse the autolabe." The smile dissolves again, replaced by a puzzled frown. "However, I cannot explain why the stores are so disorganized. Curiously inefficient." She shrugs. "Let us gather samples, and then attempt to find a location where the autolabe is functional again. This place must be marked for later retrieval."

Further inspection of the room yields little else - there are merely four featureless walls, the pile of coins on the floor, and the ceiling. "Pillar, I shall need some means to climb up to the ceiling," says Facilitator. "Hopefully there will be some object or device I can lower into the hole in order to provide egress for you."

The hulking Jade-Caste grins, unslinging his weapon and moving to better position beneath the ceiling. His plated armour clanks; here, it will provide advantage in the form of footholds for the Starmetal-Caste to lever herself upwards with. He lofts his great weapon overhead, and it comes near to scraping above. "Ascend."

Facilitator's slender fingers gain secure purchase on Pillar's armor as she climbs upward - her lithe frame hardly putting any load on the enormous Stone Hand as she reaches his shoulders. From here, it becomes more challenging, as she climbs up the jade-and-metal shaft of his great beamaxe. Again, his strength holds the pole steady, but it still requires some skill on Facilitator's part to shimmy up it to reach the ceiling; her anima glows anew as she channels Essence into her limbs.

Facilitator clambers up to ground level once more, raising dust as she gets a grip on the floorboards beside the table at which they'd involuntarily entered. As she pauses to recover from the exertion, she looks around for Gauntlet and uses the autolabe again. If he'd fallen into a different storeroom, of course, it will not be effective, but there is no harm in trying.

While Facilitator sets about pursuing a means for his ascension overhead, Pillar conducts the collection below. He selects samples of Magical Material, as well as other metals - many of which are unknown to the Executive - from the jumbled storehouse, storing them away for later study.

As expected, the autolabe gives no results, and the visual inspection for a hole in a different part of the floor is more effective in conveying where Gauntlet may have gone. This resolved, Facilitator next begins to search the room for whatever means may have been used to recover the contents of the storeroom - ladders, ropes, or other such implements. Should that fail, she intends to proceed next to search for makeshifts - long, sturdy-looking objects that may be lugged over to the hole and tipped in to provide Pillar with a means of climbing.

Eventually, Facilitator has to resort to makeshift. The tables individually are not long enough to provide a means of escape, but they can be lashed together tightly with cord and lowered into the hole; if that fails, then enough tables can be dropped in to simply form a stack. This is lengthy for Facilitator, and as she works, her servos straining at an effort for which they were not rated, she muses that Pillar would be far better suited to this task than herself, and that it is an irony that he is the very one requiring rescue by this means.

Pillar paces below, impatient to be granted release - when Facilitator's bound tables drop, he lets out a grunt of appreciation. Thanks to the Starmetal-Caste's ingenuity, the Executive is above ground once more in short order. He thanks Facilitator for her efforts, carefully adjusting his heavy footing as a precaution against further flooring collapse.

Facilitator looks down into the second hole, and frowns. "This is not good. I know that Gauntlet possesses the means to escape from a deep hole by himself. He has not. Additional data: the darkness in this hole seems more than merely natural. Conclusion: he has encountered something more dangerous than a mere fall. Corollary: he may require assistance."

"Then we grant it," Pillar replies evenly.

"Lower me on a rope," suggests Facilitator. She doesn't intend to assume that her voice will carry outside the hole. "If I tug twice on the rope, pull me up. If the rope goes slack or tense, and I do not immediately give a tug as a signal, jump down."

Casting about among the gear the Alchemicals brought with them, Pillar locates a rope in short order. He wraps it several times around his left hand, clenching the hand into a fist and preparing to lower Facilitator by securing the rope with his other great paw. "Agreed. Descend when ready."

The descent is a strange one. The motion through that blackness is more like moving through a sludge that blocks sight only until one clears it. Once through its blackness, a chamber is revealed, lit by two crystals. At either end of it are large openings with the same impenetrable blackness to conceal their contents. The shaft from above does not end in coins here, but instead in a pile of many bones, at least some of which look like they must be human remains.

Facilitator takes all this in; and as she reaches bottom, she gives two tugs. She isn't ready for Pillar to come down yet - it will be rather more difficult for him to get back up from here - but she dare not explore the other darkened corridors alone. Gauntlet's absence is particularly concerning; he must have departed down one of the other corridors - or been abducted.

The signal thus given, Pillar's arms pass one over the other as he hauls the rope back up.

Facilitator emerges, and explains the situation - two gateways shrouded in darkness, old bones, no sign of Gaunt. "Can you weather a drop of twenty-five feet?" she continues, as she ties several more tables together, and tethers the rope to one of them. The assemblage, put together, has a wider diameter than Gauntlet's hole, and the purpose is clear: to provide a scaffold that will allow Facilitator - and hopefully, Gauntlet - to climb back up without Pillar's assistance. How Pillar himself will get back up is an unanswered question, as yet.

"I can," Pillar grunts, observing Facilitator's work and moving to aid her. "Stand clear." He approaches as near the pit of Gaunt's fall as he dares without triggering a collapse, and then takes a pair of steps backwards.

Facilitator waits for Pillar to jump down, and then climbs down the rope after him. At the bottom of the hole, she pauses long enough to determine if Pillar is injured at all, and then takes charge. "We will take that corridor," she says, indicating one of the two darkened rooms at random. Before going, though, she uses a gyrochakram to cut off about twenty feet of rope, tying it to her waist and advising Pillar to do the same. "We must not take the risk of being separated in the darkness," she explains.

The Jade-Caste has taken injury, but not impairment. His landing left him with one clenched fist extended before him, the other arm extended for balance - it triggered a rip somewhere in the synthetic musculature of his legs, but not enough of one to slow him. He nods in thanks to Facilitator, securing the rope with a forceful tug.

Thus equipped, the remaining two members of the Autochthonian Gate expedition set off into the darkness in pursuit of their missing comrade. Gauntlet was nearly lost in his previous expedition - Facilitator and Pillar do not intend for him to be lost again, not while there are still means to find him.
