# AutoGate 2005-12-17

Passing through that black barrier once more, Pillar and Facilitator find themselves in yet another large room. Unlike the last, however, this one is almost painfully lit, a dozen glowing stones shedding piercing light from the ceiling. The floor descends away at a steep decline, forming something of a large bowl. At the bottom of this bowl is a huge statue of a great hound, much like those that were already encountered by the Assembly. Each of its five heads has been worked into a different magical material, and its body is a careful mesh of all of them as well, it's fur mottled as here and there a different material has been worked into it, giving it an almost patchwork quality.

The statue would easily stand twice as tall as Pillar, but it has been cast in a moment of repose, seemingly, the heads all laying sprawled on the floor and the body in the still of deep slumber. Along the walls are many other portals, all of which are covered by that black, blinding surface.

Facilitator actually looks dismayed as she sees the vast network of passages. Searching this lot would take forever, unless she can find some way to narrow it down. As she allows a subprocess to consider that problem, she inspects the statue critically. "Fascinating..." she says, resting a hand on the muzzle of the starmetal head. As a matter of curiosity, she channels her anima into the strange substance, wondering if this statue was ever meant to be empowered.

Recalling the conflict with similarly-constructed hounds that could be this one's kin, Pillar stands by Facilitator in a state of readiness. Let the scientist inspect, and the warrior watch over.

There is the softest sound from that statue. At least it beings soft. Facilitator then can sense a motion of air from the nostrils of the head she has touched as the statue snorts. The starmetal eyes open slowly, and for that moment Facilitator can see the swirling of countless stars and galaxies in those orbs. They go on and on, impossibly deep.

Something comes to rest on Pillar's left shoulder.

Facilitator takes a step back, one hand falling to her hip. "What are you?" she asks softly of the statue, staring back in astonishment at the tiny specks and whorls of light in the creature's eyes.

One widened eye swivels to Pillar's touched shoulder. As the Jade-Caste moves to take a reflexive step away, his hand goes for his weapon - unlike Facilitator, Pillar has his doubts that this construct speaks a language other than violence. Certainly, it's kin did not appear to.

Standing behind Pillar is a red-cloaked familiar figure - Gauntlet. "There is danger here," he whispers, gesturing toward Facilitator.

The statue doesn't answer. The starmetal head turns to slam its cheek against the head to it right, then to its left, forcing the soulsteel and the moonsilver to rouse as well. A chilling gasp like a thing dead slips through the room as the soulsteel head opens its eyes, their depths simply a void, nothing to be seen at all. The moonsilver eyes open with a growl, the fangs of it bared as it glares at the starmetal head. The eyes of moonsilver shift constantly, darkness and lighting alternating in a wild pattern.

Facilitator decides that retreat is the order of the day, and turns to Pillar - and her eyes light up as she observes that Gauntlet is now present as well. She rejoins the rest of her Assembly, looking somewhat chagrined, but says nothing for now. What is occurring is evident, and discussion of the events that led up to it can be saved for a time of less danger.

The barest of rueful grins alights upon Pillar's face, and he nods belatedly to the Soulsteel Exalt. The motion for his Beamaxe completes itself, and the blade crackles to life ominously. "Can't be easy," he mutters, though by his tone the warrior does not much mind.

The head of jade is awoken next, it's many-colored hide looking slightly tattered. The great beast pushes itself to its feet. Oddly, the orichalcum head just dangles lifelessly. Now that the creature has raised itself up the reason may be noticed for the first time. The throat of that head has been torn open, whatever power that once had driven is long since spent. Still, the beast knows language, and it is the head of star metal that speaks, "We are Balg." Following it in a strange, almost haunting blend of tones are all the other heads, "We are Balg," "We are Balg," "We are Balg." There is a quality missing, however. The head that hangs uselessly there has torn away what must have been a perfect harmony from the construct's voice.

Damaged though it may be, it still speaks. Thus it is, for the time being, Facilitator's responsibility to interact with the wounded automaton. "I am Facilitator. What happened in this place, Balg?" she calls.

"War," answers the head of Moonsilver. "Death," answers the head of Soulsteel. "Fate," answers the head of Starmetal. "Betrayal," answers the head of Jade. The heads pointedly ignore each other's responses, each looking to Facilitator as if the others did not exist. Four questions come at once in return. "Who are you?" "Where are you from?" "How did you get here?" "Why have you come here?"

"We are travelers from a distant land, come here to seek the means for our survival," Facilitator replies, falling back on well-reinforced habits of giving only as much information as she deems appropriate for her audience.

"There is no lesson of survival here," says the Moonsilver. "Only its absence," continues the Soulsteel. The two heads look at each other darkly, saying no more. The Starmetal growls, "Survival is not fate here." The Jade maintains a stony silence through this, its eyes flashing in poorly-concealed rage.

Facilitator finds it difficult to disagree on these points - Gauntlet's report and the evidence they have already seen mesh well with Balg's assertions. Unless... Balg has a different emphasis in mind? A veiled threat? Her hands fall to her hip again, but aloud she says, in agreeable tones, "It is as you say. This land has been abandoned to loss and breakdown."

"Not abandoned," growls the Moonsilver head. "Not abandoned," adds the Jade head, its glare focused on the other heads. "Fate was met," the Starmetal head says dismissively. "My appetite was whetted with death," grates out the Soulsteel. It's eyes focus on Facilitator and a sound like metal shredding metal can be heard as it growls.

Well, that was reasonably clear, at least to Facilitator. She does not reply to Balg again, but takes a step back, so that she is closer to her Autochthonian comrades. Pitching her voice in a whisper almost as low as Gauntlet's, she says, "Do you believe this construct contains more Magical Materials than we can carry?" Unspoken, but clearly implied is the question of whether the Assembly is capable of rendering this particular assemblage _safe_ to carry.

"Reinforcements would help," offers Gauntlet, answering spoken and unspoken questions alike.

"What function did you perform, Balg?" asks Facilitator, carefully listening for Pillar's position. If her more tactically experienced friends choose to either retreat or attack, she intends to be ready.

"Function?" asks the Moonsilver. "Death," answers the Soulsteel. "Observation and control," the Starmetal replies. The last word comes from the Jade, "The follower." It looks to the fallen head of Orichalcum and says clearly, "The betrayer."

"Who do you name as master, or maker?" asks Gauntlet, straining to be heard.

The four heads blink as one, directing their eyes at Gauntlet. "We are the maker." "We were the beginning." "There is none other." "All were consumed by our maws."

Pillar takes one anticipatory step forward to fill the space left by Facilitator, the dangerous automation's growling answered with a low, quiet rumble from within his artificial throat. He interposes his bulk between the line of the creature's charge and his companions, yet takes care not to invite Balg's rage through overtly aggressive motions, precipitous as it appears.

"We apologize for disturbing your repose, Balg," says Facilitator with finality. "Let the beginning and the end be one once more." One way or the other, this interview is concluded as far as she is concerned, and she takes another step toward the door by which they'd entered.

"None survive," says the Moonsilver. "Death," agrees the Soulsteel. "None are destined to live," concludes the Starmetal. Though those heads try to lunge forward, nothing comes of it. The Jade head glares defiantly at the others, "They live under other stars. Their feet have not touched my surface before. Their destiny is not in your hands." The other heads turn like the cracking of a whip, three sets of enraged eyes bearing down upon the Jade.

"The first and the last, but not the only," whispers Gauntlet. "Another betrayal may come soon."

Facilitator is poised to run, fight, or both. There is nothing more for the Assembly to say here, as far as she is concerned; but for the time being, she will stay to see how Balg resolves its own disagreement. If the Assembly is lucky, the thing will bicker itself to death and provide Autochthonia with a treasure trove, but at worst the three Alchemicals should be able to flee through the dark portal behind them.

The glow of his Beamaxe casts itself across Pillar's set features, and his hand tightens on the weapon's haft. Both eyes watching Balg, he awaits the demented machine's next act.

The 'luck' is questionable. The heads each take on something of an unpleasant glow, essence spilling from them as they begin their battle. Though it would seem that three on one is not balanced, the jade head has a distinct advantage. It is able to use the orichalcum as a shield, and it has full control of the body. The great beast leaps past the Assembly, and as the Soulsteel head reaches for the throat of the Jade, it is slammed full tilt into the wall, the stone crumbling from the force of the blow. The other heads duck, leaving the Soulsteel to take the full brunt of the impact. The fighting is far from over, however, as the heads bay at each other loudly, teeth flashing like swords.

"I have chosen my winner," grates Gauntlet, and his plasma pistols almost materialize in his hands. He draws a bead, targeting the Soulsteel head.

Directing the Assembly in matters of combat and tactics are not under Facilitator's purview, and fight or flight are clearly the only avenues remaining. The multicolored blades of her gyrochakrams clang into position along the metal disks as she lowers herself into a defensive posture, scanning the room for tactically advantageous positions.

Pillar sets his axe into position, tracing a glittering arc of Essence through the air. The Exalt exudes coiled power, waiting and studying the movements of his foe. A moment passes - the opening is spotted; his anima flares brightly into life as the Executive springs towards the neck of Balg's Moonsilver head. Clenched overhead in both hands, Pillar brings his weapon down in a brilliant arc of energy.

Gauntlet runs lateral to the behemoth, eyes carefully focused on the Soulsteel head. He has forgotten all that came before, but he knows his own nature well enough, and he can feel a black kinship to the heart of the entity. Were his fellows to turn rogue, he would hunt them down with the same grim efficiency. Yet it endangers his Assembly, and the more tractable heads may be useful sources of information. With this dark pragmatism sustaining him, he raises his weapons. The pistols in Gauntlet's razor-sheathed hands hum to life, and two brilliant stars of deadly plasma erupt as one. In their light, the black aura that erupts around the Sentinel is contrasted, for he is holding nothing back.

Having little by way of actual mobility does prevent the hound from reach anyone far away. The Jade simply isn't letting them. Control must be wrested away for anything effective to occur. The Moonsilver ducks under the stricken head of the Soulsteel, fangs flashing out as it seeks to tear at the maw of the Jade head.

For the second time in this mission, Facilitator channels her will into her still-nascent understanding of Thousand Wounds Gear Style's _kata_, bringing both chakrams up in front of her with the blades meshing. Then she vaults backward, bursting into brilliant azure light, throwing one gear toward the starmetal head even as her leap brings her body parallel with the ground. She lands on her now-free hand, then handsprings back to a standing position, her remaining gear at the ready. "Allow us to teach you about fate," calls Facilitator in challenge - her chakram may be but a nuisance to her opponent, but the nuisance may bear a sting regardless.

As Facilitator leaps back the head of Jade extends its power, and the curious allies that stand at its side against the remnants of the Celestial Heads are granted a measure of its power, the glow of its essence empowering the entire Assembly.

The starmetal and soulsteel heads have one target. It's the one holding them back. Their wrath is directed solely at the jade, and their flashing teeth slashing wildly at the hated traitor, seeking to crush its windpipe or skull.

Landed beneath the hound's warring heads with stance wide and firm, Pillar lashes upwards with his Beamaxe - first once, then against and again, a roar of battle upon his lips. The path of his swings is marked in places by the weapon's trail of energy, visible only when it exits the overpowering glow of his anima.

The blows hit home, slewing the Soulsteel head from side to side with a series of sickening wrenches. Blackened trails are gouged where the glowing axe strikes, and the darkly metallic head lets loose a eerie scream.

The jade head is also looking a lot more ragged now, though, as its erstwhile body-mates assault it. Soon it will lose control of the body - and so Facilitator deems it vital to do as much damage as they can before that occurs. She throws her other chakram - the spinning blade seems to fly back along the very same route that its mate had traversed, diverting only at the last moment toward the soulsteel head - and as the other disc returns to her hand, she crouches low on the ground, the gyrochakram held in a warding posture.

As the starmetal disk digs into the creature's soulsteel skin, and opens one of Pillar's deep gouges that crucial bit too far, the thing screeches with a sound of grating metal that echoes through the room, chilling all listeners to the bone; Gauntlet in particular feels his very body respond to the thing's death-cry, the whispers sounding louder for just a moment. Even the shadows at the doorways flicker for a moment, and the normal shadows cast by the brilliant room-lights waver, become less deep somehow, as the soulsteel head of Balg slumps forward, smoke pouring from the fatal wound.

Gauntlet instantly chooses a new target, and his guns jitter as they struggle to acquire an aim on the thrashing Moonsilver head. The Essence coursing through his servos and neural lace casts forth an eerie shadow around him, and a dozen eyes seem to stare out of it as flashes of lightning arc across his armor. They glare accusingly at the protean head, pronouncing its doom through the force of their unwavering gaze. The Sentinel fires again and again, determined to end this as quickly as possible.

Bolts land just above the left eye, and just below the right, and Gauntlet curses. He has accuracy, but not power, and the Moonsilver head seems to blur as its features start to recover from the impacts.

The head of Starmetal reels as the Soulsteel is slain. For a second the stars flicker in its eyes, finally resolving into something distinctly less detailed and focused than before. The damage of it seems to spread across all the hounds equally, as the swift transformations of Moonsilver are dazed, the changes less smooth, as if frames of a moving picture were simply missing.

The rage of the beast has not changed, however, and it flares up with a tell-tale burst of essence, much more terrible in such an enormous creature. The head of Starmetal cannot naturally reach Facilitator, but it seems that the impact of its attacks just might. The head darts forward and Facilitator feels in herself an echo of warning, making her able to react to what is otherwise a thing unseen, of fates and destinies and probabilities.

It is not just the starmetal in her frame, but in her weapon that resonates with the threads of fate, detecting the shape of ill-fortune being directed against her. And it is that resonance that allows her to raise the metal disk, blue sparks crackling from its extruded blades, to deflect the uncanny energy that is being brought to bear against her.

Fate looks poorly upon its would-be agents quarrelling with one another. Facilitator's parry is tardy and ill-aspected, but the starmetal head's Essence blast is similarly out of tune with destiny. The sparks on Facilitator's weapon blades are snuffed out for a moment, but no worse befalls her.

The hound of Jade lashes out at Starmetal, but though his terrible teeth find purchase on the ear of his enemy, the only result is a showering of sparks below. The hound positions itself carefully, jaw open and waiting for another opening, the threat against Starmetal very clear. It's clear that it is relying upon its allies to keep the Moonsilver from its throat.

Pillar holds back nothing now that the Assembly's efforts have created weakness. The wreath of magic about the Stone Hand crystallises into iconic focus, and then becomes brighter still as he pours more Essence into his attacks. The Executive's body strengthens as Essence races along veins of conveyance from reservoir to synthetic muscle, empowering it to penetrate the reinforced hides of his opponents. And yet more crackling energy races along the haft of his axe, coming to deadly focus just as Pillar sweeps the blade mightily towards Balg's Moonsilver head.

In a trio of powerful blows, Pillar slices into and eventually severs the Moonsilver head, it's shifting proving too slow to maintain an attachment. And, as with the moment that marked the deathknell of the Soulsteel head, the world subtly shifts and deadens, the Alchemical's surroundings tamed and dulled by the loss of a force of change.

The sparks that surround Facilitator suddenly take on form, turning into a complicated three-dimensional filigree of circuitry in the very air surrounding her - and something else suffuses her as well. A rainbow image of Facilitator's body seems to catch her returning disk and rush forward, leaping toward the starmetal head; a split second later, Facilitator herself undertakes the same journey. Three rainbow arcs flash through the air and swipe at the starmetal face, foretelling Facilitator's own movements a fraction too late for the great hound to perceive the calculated precision of her strikes.

But destiny works in the hound's favor as well. Though it cannot quite foretell Facilitator's movements, its metal skin is hardest just where Facilitator's blows land. Starmetal clashes against starmetal, and both emerge unscathed.

Deciding that destiny is not to be relied on, Gauntlet falls back on his familiar and comfortable standby: plasma. He aims and fires, directing his weapons with the unsettling accuracy of a killer.

This seems to work rather well, as splinters of Magical Material erupt from the star-hot plasma bolts that impact the head. Gauntlet backs off, making a quiet hur-huring sound in a mockery of laughter.

Like a whip the Jade maw darts forth, teeth like daiklaives stab into the cheek of Starmetal flesh and with a terrible screech they pull back, tearing the starmetal flesh away. From the gaping wound falls stars that shatter like crystals as they strike the floor far below.

Still aglow from the efforts of a moment ago, Pillar moves in to finish the job, teeth grit and face set in a determined grimace. He deftly sidesteps a great metal paw as it comes down by him, submerged in the rhythm of combat. Grunting with exertion as his hands and body move in unison, the Executive sends his weapon slicing upwards at the final head over and over.

The blows rent jagged scars into the side of the Starmetal head, mauling it - yet not bringing it to an end. The thing quickly shakes away the discomfort, and it's eyes glitter still with dire malice.

Even Pillar's puissance was not enough. Gauntlet frowns as he too joins in, aiming his shots for the very wounds that his comrade just opened up. While his weapons are not so mighty, he has cunning and conviction supporting him, and pragmatism outweighs any sense of mercy he might ever feel for this solitary monster.

The Starmetal rocks as it is blasted, the damage just enough to destroy it, despite the maddening attempts of chance to avoid it. With a drawn out sigh the head of Starmetal slumps down and all that remains is the hound of Jade. The shadows simply cease moving, and a certain unfathomable something can be felt as the very future of the world is withdrawn, the tides of destiny crumbling. The beast stands for a moment, limping towards the Assembly, then collapsing. The single living head speaks in a weakening voice, "Thank you, strangers, for rousing a last chance for redemption." It's eyes shine a moment and it says, "And perhaps.. something more. You are not from this land, though you are made like we are. There is indeed something beyond."

"We are like and unlike you. But we were not your enemy." Gauntlet's harsh, hushed voice rattles. "If you have more to say, or more that must be done, speak now. We will do what we can."

With a rap of the butt of its haft against the floor, Pillar's Beamaxe hisses into dormancy. He looks upon the damaged Automation, nodding in solemn accord with Gauntlet.

"This world is ended," replies Balg. "I am the firmament, but I will not hold forever. Long will the failing be, but with only myself, it is doomed. There is perhaps hope that a seed of this work shall live on." The great hound grows very still as it continues to speak, "For I am a maker, but I do not work for the possession of my creations, but for the making of them." The Jade head shifts slightly, "This body is too large for you to move." The Jade head growls softly, and a soft tearing can be heard as the other heads finally fall from its body, rolling slightly from the hound before they settle once more. "Take these. By my will they are lightened." There is another pause and the eyes of the Jade focus on Pillar, "And you, child of the firmament, take from me my eyes, so that I will not have to see the end when it comes. Bring them to your world and tend them, for some small part of my self shall go with them, so that not all of my knowledge shall be lost when this world at last dies."

Gauntlet nods, glancing at his companions. _Success, after a fashion,_ he thinks. _More magical materials. Future benefits. All are unharmed._

Sensing that too many of the rough words of a warrior would disrupt the sanctity of the moment, Pillar does not wax lyrical. He simply moves forth to gently do as the remnant of Balg requests, and gives a slight bow. "It shall be so."

When the eyes of Balg have been drawn away, the lids shut and blessed blindness takes away the vision of a world lost. "There is one last thing," says the hound softly. Its will is directed and in front of Facilitator appears a book on a pedestal. The tome is bound in orichalcum, it's covers made of jade and starmetal. "It will explain everything. Heed it as a warning." Standing out prominently from the cover are four half-spheres of Orichalcum. Their glow shifts slightly, focusing on each of the Assembly in turn. "The betrayer is twice traitor now, but let that which was righteous and good in the world be taken." And with that, Balg says no more, the long wait all that remains for it.

Facilitator clasps the book in her hands. "It shall be heeded." Perhaps the beast would not have given the book to her if it had known the Plot Weaver's traditional relationship to information; but her faith in the Divine Ministers is strong, as is her belief that they will be able to make use of the tome - even if its contents are not known to mortals or even Alchemicals.

The red-suited Gauntlet takes the lead, doing his part to carry the load the Assembly has been gifted with. His footsteps barely sound where the others' echo, and his eyes see where the others' might not, thanks to his armor. His tactical awareness helps him keep track of the labyrinth the group have fallen into, and his companions provide protection against threats he is not capable of handling. He says nothing, for there is nothing to be said.

In time the three return to the surface, and Gauntlet finally lets out a sigh. "It may be time to return home," he whispers at last, voicing the thought which has kept him silent.

"I concur," says the Vizier. "We have not only much treasure, but we have learned as much as we could hope to learn from this world - and possibly gained all we can hope to gain." Her voice is tinged with sadness - if Balg's final words are true, this entire world will eventually fall to the Void. Not even Domadamod, but Ku is its fate.

"As do I," rumbles Pillar. "For now, we have done enough."

"Aside from our gains, we must also see if Design did not come with us. And if he did, we will need to relay that and return to find him." Gauntlet adds this as an afterthought - he is still mindful of the other Alchemical's unstated mission with the group.

Facilitator agrees. She has had little to do with Design as yet on a personal level, but the loss of an Alchemical Exalt would put the mission in the red, even with the substantial gains they have achieved so far. If he is lost in this realm, they cannot abandon him while there is still hope of finding him.

Pillar nods. Motive behind his assignation aside, Design is and will remain a member of their Assembly - it is only proper that he be afforded treatment as such. He hefts the remains that are his to bear to a firmer grip. "Then we hurry back."

Through blackened and abandoned buildings, through silent stone and over forgotten streets, through grass and woods and blissfully ignorant life. The Assembly has seen no sign of their associate in any of the places he may have visited - based on their own logical conclusions - and if he is too far away, there is no chance of his discovery, much less return. Still, he may be waiting for them. And as the team returns from the Gate, the Sentinel receives the mixed emotions of finding this to be the case.

There is not precisely a grand parade awaiting the Assembly when it returns. The engineers remain all around Livia, glaring at her as she opens the gate to allow the team to return, then she shuts it behind them, waiting for them to enter fully before closing the portal entirely, the softest ripple flowing inward as the other world is cut away. Her expression looks very sad and she shakes her head, "The harmony has been shattered," she intones. The engineers frown at her more deeply. If anything, the apparent success of the mission seems to offend the 'high-ups' who are present. The last to leave meets the Chief's gaze with narrowed eyes. "We will see about this. Naturally any results must be reviewed with caution before they can be fully accepted," he says flatly. "It is indeed.. fortunate that your team has been so successful. They are to be commended. Assuming everything stands up in the face of our inquiry, of course." With that, the man walks away stiffly.

Gauntlet produces a sliver of starmetal, a 'trophy' of the groups' battles, and extends it in a silent, sardonic offer. _See if it stands up, indeed,_ he thinks.

Facilitator moves to Livia, having heard her words. "The harmony was shattered long before we arrived, Livia." With other ears listening, this is all she dares say - but she suspects that Livia will understand.

Largely untouched by their trials beyond the Gate, Pillar wears a confident smile and bears his plunder prominently. _May as well put on our best appearances,_ he reflects, _for it cannot do harm, even if there are those determined to see things in a poor light._

Livia nods to Facilitator, not saying any more. The Chief walks down the ramp to greet his people. He looks at the guest engineers and says simply, "You are no longer here. I suggest you make this lie into a truth very swiftly." He smiles unpleasantly at them, making sure they leave before he turns to his team. "Quite a haul," he says simply. "Of course they aren't exactly happy. They were hoping to shut us down. Wasted project. Fools!" He barks a laugh and looks over the odd trophies, "I have a feeling this is going to be quite a report. I'd like to know what went on in there, though. And how Design wasn't allowed to go farther in." He looks to Livia very intently and she decides quite suddenly to make a detailed survey of her feet. "It's just as well. I think he was just a spy. If anything, they were probably hoping he'd sabotage the whole thing."

"There has been enough betrayal," whispers Gauntlet.

"A full report will be forthcoming," says Facilitator.

Livia shifts slightly on her feet, her head turning from her feet to focus on Pillar. She studies him very, very closely and peers at the large pouch that holds the eyes of Jade. "Ahhh, I _knew_ I heard some of the resonance still!" she says happily. "But there's still a harmony, so there must be another source." She looks about curiously, her focus settling on Facilitator and the book. "And there's the other. The noble and the true have been brought back, it seems." She looks very pleased, at least. All she has to say to the Chief is pretty much what he likes to hear, "If you trust this to the men who were trying to distract me, they will waste something more valuable than a mountain of orichalcum."

"I concur with her assessment, Chief," says Facilitator. "The artifacts Livia has noted represent the last warnings of a dying world, if their source spoke truly. Our own world will do well to use them wisely."

A smile touches Pillar's features at Livia's words. "You are very perceptive, child." He withdraws the Jade eyes from the pouch, studying them thoughtfully. "I am not sure that these are best in my hands, but nor do I know a pair better for them."

Facilitator has a brief buzzing conversation with her crystal fly, instructing it to carefully record these proceedings, and to mark its earlier recording of the confrontation with Balg as significant. Even if the human administrators of Autochthonia misuse these artifacts, the Divine Ministers will have a record of them. She can only hope and pray that they will deign to notice the report from one minor Alchemical.

Livia looks to the Chief hopefully, and he sighs. "I don't know what this talk of resonance is yet, but it seems to indicate the materials we need most," says the Chief. "What we need to do is find a place to hide them. Or someone to hold them that they won't suspect." He looks at Livia a moment, then to the other Alchemicals, "We would know where it was.. and nobody would ever suspect it." He pauses to glare at Livia, "Are you.. doing one of your 'things' to me right now?" She shakes her head quickly and gets a snort of disgust for her trouble. "We'd be idiots to trust something to her care, but her cell might be a good place to keep these things." Livia actually beams at this and nods, "Yes, total idiots! Very brilliant, Chief." He just glares her into silence again.

Pillar chuckles gently at this, but does not pass comment - matters of administration are beyond his concern. Instead, he returns Balg's eyes to the pouch, and reaches for another. He walks forward, setting it down upon a table. Glinting circles of mixed metals spill out. "These are magical and unknown substances we recovered, in a treasury of sorts. They may merit further study," the Jade-Caste informs those present. He steps back.

Facilitator gives Livia a careful glance, and eventually nods. "She certainly will do no harm to these things, and her cell is a suitably inaccessible location." A feeling has stolen over the Vizier: Livia's uncanny perceptions are not entirely unakin to the perceptions of someone in tune with fate. Could Livia be an agent of a Destiny bigger than Facilitator can imagine? Or is the idea simply placed in her head to win the sympathy of an Alchemical whose natural province is fate?
