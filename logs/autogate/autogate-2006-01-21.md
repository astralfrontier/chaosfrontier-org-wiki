# AutoGate 2006-01-21

It is very early and without warning that Gentle Operational Facilitator and Gauntlet are summoned by the Chief. They are not called to the gate facility, but instead to a building not far from it. There are no staff members there other than the Chief, who waits outside. A grand doorway that shows an image of the Eye of the Great Maker stands behind him, sealed. The Chief makes a harsh wave for silence before anything can be said, then steps aside, looking from the Chosen of the Machine God to the door.

The gate opens itself, but only after the Eye turns to consider first Facilitator, and then Gauntlet. That focus seems to look beyond the crafted flesh of the Exalts, but through their whole being. Voices and memories sift through the heads of the two who have come, louder and louder and faster, things drawn to the fore and pushed away until it seems they must go mad. At this very brink the gate opens. A chilly, distant voice echoes out, "Come."

Beyond the door is a short hallway that leads to several portals on either side. On the right a door opens suddenly for Facilitator, and on the left for Gauntlet. The Exalts are not told which door belongs to them. They simply know it, as they know how to move their right hand instead of their left. Once these doors are entered the portals slam shut once more, sealing the two exalts.

For Gauntlet, these memories are recent, and some of the images he sees within are new and alien to him. He allows himself a brief feeling of fear as he is sealed in. But no more.

Facilitator, so long used to analyzing the lives of others, feels a definite discomfort at being on the receiving end. But such is the way of life in the Realm of Brass and Shadow - everyone is always under scrutiny. But it isn't usually so... so _direct_ as this, and so it is a moment before she recovers from the experience and passes through her portal.

Though made of different materials, the general making is similar in the cells. There is a light of raw essence that illuminates the room, and wires more finely woven than the circulatory systems of any creature cover the surface. This is a work beyond anything seen in the vats, beyond anything the Exalts will see.. until they return. For now, they can notice the tens of thousands of subtle wiring, the work beyond comprehension of all but the most masterful of craftsman, the design beyond all but one. There can be no doubt whose blueprint was used to construct these rooms. Though the Great Maker sleeps, his dozing conciousness can be sensed here, and it presses down upon the souls of his Chosen.

For a few moments, nothing happens. Slowly comes a change, but once it does, it is hard to ignore. There is something akin to an echo here, if ones very essence can echo. It's a vibration, a thrill that moves throughout the whole body of the Exalts, and as it builds the wires draw themselves from the walls and reach out to settle into the flesh of the Chosen of Autochthon.

First it is only a few connections, then others swiftly join, arranging their connections in patterns of growing complexity. For the first seconds, it is a pattern the Exalts can comprehend. This cannot be explained, they simply grasp where the next wire shall come. It goes on for a time in this way. However, the changes inrease and thousands of wires move as one, connecting to the Chosen. When they are done, there is another voice in the souls of the Exalts. This is the voice they heard at the gates. It is a voice they know, though they do not recall why or where. The voice of the Maker is not speaking to them directly, however. It seems as distant as the worlds beyond the Gate, and yet it is changing them, optimizing them. "Essence levels in Exalt Sector A776A.F23 currently only at minimum levels of acceptability... Upgrading bindings to limit leakage in Sector B894.B35.."

The voice drones on and on, referring to metaphysical and physical parts of the Chosen. The changes are hard at first to express or understand. They come fast, and so much is altered as the voice drones on. Body and Soul are binding more efficiently. That much becomes clear. The echo that had seemed so curious before is more pure now. There is less dissonance. There is a harmony building. It ends suddenly and the wires withdraw. The distant voice says flatly, "Leave." The portals open. The Exalted are free to go. The Chief is no longer here. It seems that some ten hours have passed.

Facilitator is once again slow to respond, but this time, it is because of the echoes in her mind, the faint thrum of the Great Machine in the back of her mind. As she steps out of the vault and looks around, she nods to Gauntlet. "You can feel it as well, can you not?"

"Yes... but it is one voice rising above others," whispers Gauntlet. His eyes are half-closed; he seems to be most actively listening to whatever goes on inside him now. "It is.. comforting."

Facilitator does not understand for a moment - then she recalls Gauntlet's caste, and the rumors of the whispers from their bodies that they speak so little about. She nods, and does not inquire further. "The pattern is clearer," she says. That, at least, is true for both of them.

In the depths of the Vat Complex allocated for his use, Pillar floats with eyes shut in a tank of viscous, glowing reagents. A variety of thick cords are interfaced across his form; some are transparent, pumping strange fluids into or out of the Exalt's body. Others, yet, are a solid bundle of wiring, transmitting unknown data from - or into - Pillar's neural centres.

The Alchemical is suspended in a deep, artificial slumber, his external sensory capabilities utterly deprived. His mind wanders in a half-dream, conjuring flashing images of duties past interspersed by stranger memories - those not his own, or those of a life not this one. Thosh communes silently with Pillar, their conversation made not of words, but of alien concepts and impressions. And behind it all is the sonorous murmur of The Great Maker's clarity, penetrating even into the mind of this least among Jade-Castes.

Time is nonexistent. Time is not an issue. As humanity whizzes by needlessly, the discussion of feeling rages.

Outside, uniformly-clad workers of the Populat attend the controls at Pillar's Vat, and the metallic lid clanks open. Innumerable spider-like automations fall into the fluid within, legs whirring and scrambling in the thick, transparent muck. After a time, a stray metallic leg catches hold upon one of Pillar's protruding Charms, and the spider that owns it latches on - pulling itself onto the Exalt within the Vat. And from there, it reaches out a tentative leg to snare another spider and help it to the soil of the Jade-Caste, then - aided by the new arrival - another and another, each successive spider helping more and more move through the liquid. Soon, all are rooted upon Pillar's body.

And no sooner is the final one secured than they split, clambering to different sections of Pillar's body. They reknit torn synth-flesh and smooth over cracked implants, polishing and perfecting both combat injury and the wear of use.

That done, the spiders regroup and swarm up to their subjects face, sprouting tiny surgical instruments as they scuttle along.

Small incisions are made, laying open the claylike skin of Pillar's nose. One of the spiders protrudes a small siphon, and begins to draw away the oily fluid that all Alchemicals excrete when injured. Yet another moves close, and begins to convulse as its companions look coldly on. After several moments, the shuddering spider vomits forth a shard of glittering Magical Material - and curls up, drifting slowly down through the liquid. Unsympathetic, the remaining automations graft the shard into Pillar's exposed nasal passage, and the process begins again - a new spider is sacrificed, and another shard of material is given forth and added to the first.

The process continues for methodical hours, the pace ritualistically unwavering. A Charm has grown up as the fruits of so many automation's labors and lives, and the last remaining spider deftly weaves the flesh closed. Once done, it checks over the newly-installed Charm for faults. Apparently satisfied, the final spider spasms, legs curling, and falls to join its companions.

Gauntlet, Facilitator, and Pillar meet up again at the complex. The Enforcer, in particular, has announced his intentions to return through the gate. "I will gather more samples, but I will also be practicing," he explains. He has brought with him a peculiar clockwork device, made up of several rods affixed via a gear system to a central supporting pillar. The clockwork seems designed to make the rods spin or change their height rapidly. Facilitator has seen such a thing before - a practice aid for the martial arts, a sort of 'dummy opponent'.

"There is something about that place which calls to me," whispers Gaunt. "Whatever I learn there, I will inform you of on my return."

"Then we will await you," Pillar replies. Already, the Stone Hand feels the greater enlightenment and attunement to the Maker that his comrades have achieved, and finds himself unsure of the appropriate reaction. In lieu, he opts for polite neutrality.

Facilitator nods slowly. "You intend to depart on your own?" she says curiously. "There are many dangers." She does not intend to do Gauntlet's cost-benefit analysis for him, but she is curious as to what results he himself had come up with.

"I do. There is.. training I require." Gauntlet pauses, then speaks more reflectively than his accustomed haunted whisper seems capable of. "For you, a greater connection to the Maker is a new thing. For me, it is something lost. If I find something I cannot face now, I will flee." He wavers, seeming ready to say more, but falls silent.

Facilitator eventually nods. "There is much I have to do in Autochthonia," she says. "There will be meetings to discuss what we have already found, and I would talk to Livia and discuss the book that we recovered before those occur. May your endeavors prove fruitful, Gauntlet."

With a curt wave of one hand, then, Gauntlet gathers up his things. The portal awaits him.

Two days pass. Business around the complex is brisker than normal. The recovery of valuable raw materials and the success of the mission has brought renewed attention from certain quarters - attention which Gauntlet, with the full cooperation of Thosh and the grudging admission of the Chief, would certainly be better off avoiding. Nevertheless the Enforcer returns in that time, with the two weeks' worth of food he packed entirely gone and a few of his other supplies missing as well. The gear-driven practice machine is intact, if battered.

When Gauntlet returns, he finds himself summoned by the Chief to his rather cramped office. It seems that success on one mission isn't going to make him smile. He sits at his desk glowering at Livia, who sits waiting patiently with the rest of the Assembly. She has long since given up smiling at the Chief, since his third or fourth growling that was punctuated with a him almost throwing something at her. She definitely has a way of getting under his skin without actually doing anything. Once Gauntlet arrives the Chief asks, "So, we got one good mission under our belts. You are all farther along. I think I can push the schedule for our next run."

Gauntlet then speaks, giving his report of what he had seen. "There is nothing there now," he whispers. "It has become something like a blight, and the Void will have it soon enough. I see no further use to be had from traveling to the existing site, so a new destination seems called for."

"I returned with a few samples of soil, and whatever else I could find of use." He retrieves a bundle from a pouch at his belt and extends it. A few twigs and cuttings are wrapped inside.

Livia sighs softly and nods. She reaches out to examine the samples, but draws her hand away when the Chief looks at her. "Well, it seems that we got there just in time to get what used could be gained from it, then," says the Chief. "Even with the one mission we gained a great deal more than we expended." He turns to Livia, "The question then becomes, can we succeed in this way again?" The strange girl shifts in her seat, looking somewhat uncomfortable. "I can find another place much like it," she replies at last. "Hopefully the next world will last more than a week after I connect to it."

Seated in his place, Pillar nods. _We destroyed a world. What responsibility do I claim for that 'good mission'?_ His eyes flicker. _Though our needs far outweigh the preservation of one empty world. I can only hope we do not unknowingly render the fate of destruction - or something worse - onto an inhabited place._

"I too hope we find a place that is less fragile... less tainted," remarks Facilitator.

"It was dying before you came to it," says Livia. "It was a world that fell inward, consuming itself more and more, rather than grow." She looks unusually thoughtful as she speaks, her voice more serious, "It is not like this place. This land has a will to survive yet. That one needed to be laid to rest."

"Perhaps so, then," Pillar concedes to himself.

Gauntlet hums. "Things die," he murmurs at last. "Worlds too."

"I have learned more of how the Gate functions," says Livia. "I think I can direct it with more accuracy. I simply need to know what you seek, so I can focus on it. Maintaining a connection with the dying world has helped me greatly in my comprehension. The altering resonation is guiding me a great deal."

Gauntlet gestures at the Chief. "He has a collection of soulgems," the Sentinel whispers. "Find the place they came from. That is my goal. If you cannot now, keep it in mind."
