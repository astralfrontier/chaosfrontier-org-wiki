Game Log: Chapter 2 - On The Trail


--------------------------------------

"Right," Yuri said. "We have to catch Kiel. And I also have to find a way to break the news to my father."

_Yuri is a young man of average height and wiry build, with sandy blonde hair and an easy, fluid demeanor. He has a ready smile and a glimmer in his eye. He is dressed in a leather jerkhin, light wool trousers, soft boots, and a fine wool clook, all in subdued grey tones. The hilt of a rapier is visible at his belt; otherwise, he seems rather lightly equipped._

Jane glanced over at Yuri. "News?"

"That he's going to miss his noon appointment," Tilara explained. "Right, Yuri?"

_Tilara is a young woman both pretty and possessing that indefinable presence that transforms mere attractiveness into beauty. She has bright red-gold hair and laughing emerald eyes in a tanned face. A graceful and athletic figure is accented by the brief jade-green tunic and red cloak she's wearing, a typical performers outfit. She carries a quarterstaff, and her tortoise-shell cat is usually either riding her shoulder or twining about her feet._

Yuri looked slightly sheepishly at Jane. "I don't think he'll be happy that I'm off hunting a criminal. He has... other pursuits in mind for me."

Andreth seemed pleased by this news. It's not like _he_ had any pressing business at noon, after all.

Jane raised one eyebrow. "Ah. Well. But do a good job, and you'll be mayor in no time. The Stars know the current one is bought, sold, and bartered regularly."

"Yuri's father's not who I'm worried about," Starguard grumbled. "Where Kiel galloped off too is. I think we might need to pack up for a bit of a trek."

_Brother Starguard is a tall man, strangely dressed in the brown work clothes of the acolyte cleric. The strange part is because he seems too old to be an student in the church. His thick, bushy, mustache and beard, once black, is now salt and pepper, the darkness interspersed with star-like flecks of white. His face is light and lively, blue eyes sparkling, though with a few hard wrinkles, a few laugh lines. His nose is a bit hawkish, giving him a bit of an intense look. His body seems in decent shape, if not particularly strong, but most of his form is hidden beneath the cloth of his clothes. He wears a midnight blue robe, short, with easy release clips so that he doesn't get caught by it in a fight. Depending on the situation, he may also wear his studded leather armor, but always has his morning star at his hip, in case of trouble. He walks more like a soldier than a priest...but the wooden symbol of the two stars entwined hung on the leather strap states otherwise._

"He rode off on a stolen horse, right? Can we get some horses of our own?" wondered Yuri, before realizing he knew pitifully little about riding horses.

Jane looked thoughtful. "But they have had only a half day to shift the weapons, and all the carts today have been coming in, not out ..."

Tilara nodded. "Exactly. Finding Kiel may be a bit of a problem, but he can't have gotten far with the loot."

"One horse won't go so fast hauling a lot of metal," Andreth said. "And Kiel won't go far without them."

Yuri hmmed. "So the weapons might still be in town?

"They can't be too far off," Starguard agreed.

"I suspect that the weapons are still around here somewhere. Kiel may have been planning to sneak them out with a merchant, but I doubt he expected to be found out so quickly," put in Tilara.

"So... Kiel will be coming back," Yuri concluded.

Starguard shook his head. "Not necessarily. Could have hid the weapons a ways out of town, near a road, and then load it up outside city limits."

"Maybe we ought to start with someone who knows tracking," Yuri suggested, "to check the tracks in the back alley."

Starguard smiled. "I've done a little tracking in my years, Yuri. Though I'm not the best, I'm not bad. A good hunter would be nice, though. Goodwoman Jane, do you know anyone trustworthy would might know the source of the red mud?

"Mud..." Jane pondered for a moment. "There's old Stanislaus. He likes to hunt; comes in for Spring and Fall hiring fairs only. But I haven't seen him yet today."

"Maybe we should look for Old Stanislaus, then," Yuri put forth.

"Might as well," Tilara said. "I don't know anyone else who might fit the bill."

Starguard nodded. "Let's check at the inn. Most everyone stops by there."

"OK," Yuri agreed. "Let's wander, then."

"I bid you fair hunting," Jane told them. "Jake will go with you to take down the tent. I will be here. Fuming quietly."

"We'll be back as soon as we can, Goodwoman," Tilara replied.

"We'll get 'em," Starguard assured.

---

A few moments later the group had left the weaponsmith, and headed back to the inn. As the nooning hour approaches, the roads were beginning to fill again with people leaving the Fair, but they were making good time to the Mother's Oak. Suddenly, Andreth spun round to his side as he felt something amiss!

A young boy, dressed in ragged clothes, crouched behind Andreth. "Please sir, didn't mean no harm sir, just slipped sir, please sir, don't hurt me sir, please sir..."

Starguard turned about. "Ho! What's this then?" He asked, reaching to collar the young fellow before he melted into the crowd. Andreth helped him make sure the kid didn't go anywhere, scowling mightily for a moment. Starguard knelt to come down to the little one's face level. "Hello there. You wouldn't be trying to pick pockets, would you?" he asked kindly, ruffling the hooligan's hair. Andreth grabbed onto the kid's collar, still snarling, before he remembered his training with Brother Oak and relaxed a bit. He still _looked_ like he's scowling, though.

Tilara checked her own pouch automatically at the outcry behind her, and kept a hand on it as she turned around. "Not very well, apparently..."

"Please sir, I didn't mean no harm sir, it was all a mistake sir, please sir, my brothers and sisters are starving sir, now that mum's gone and legged it sir. Just a small alm, sir?" The boy's whining tone suddenly changed. "I can trade you sir; information. I knows, sir, I knows ..."

Yuri looked amused. "Hey, there, lad. What is it you knows? You knows that they does to thieves in this town?"

Starguard sighed. "Ah, lad. What do you know that could help me? I'm just looking for some stolen swords."

"Thieves sir? I didn't steal nothing, sir, honest. I was just helpin' brother monk do his daily good deed sir. And my good deed was trying to help him do his, sir, so you see ... weren't stealing, sir. No need to put me in the stocks and cut off me hands or nuthing, sir. Honest. And I didn't steal no swords neither sir. Said I was too small." The boy kicks at Andreth's shin. "And I'm **not**!" Andreth casually moved his leg out of the path of the approaching foot, and merely tightened his grip a little.

Yuri hmmed questioningly. "Who said you're too small, kid? Maybe I want to have a discussion with him about it."

"Aye, who said that, my son?" Starguard asked. "You look pretty big to me."

Yuri looked around to see if anyone was watching this with his best 'So what's it to **you**, then, chappie?' glare. The boy kicked again at Andreth's rapidly disappearing shin. "Am not! Am _not_ small! But they only wanted big men. Said I was too small to wield a proper sword."

Tilara looked intrigued by that. _Ah-hah. I **thought** the stolen gear sounded like outfitting a band of brigands._

Starguard pulled out a silver, holding it to catch the light in front of the kid. "Who might 'they' be, my son?"

Yuri rolled his eyes and whispered to Starguard, "Oi. A real artist doesn't need that kind of help!"

The kid made a snatch for the coin. "Big Joe! Said he was recruiting. But he wouldn't take me."

"Hey, not so fast!" Yuri warned. "Why don't you show us where Big Joe is? **Then** you can take the money and run. Hopefully a lot. Far away from us."

Starguard grins at Yuri. "Eh, he's not so bad. Just needs a proper job is all." Starguard held the coin back. "Yes, hold up, little fellow. Do you know where Big Joe went with those swords?"

Andreth's scowl had returned at the mention of Big Joe. Noticing, Yuri mumbled to Andreth, "Do you know of this Big Joe?"

"Heard of 'im," Andreth grunted. "One of the nastiest thugs in the Middens. This kid shouldna get mixed up with **him** if he knows what's good for 'im."

The kid shook his head wildly. "Don't know. Can't go. Not Big Joe. But I can tell you about ...", he looks around carefully, and then leans away from Andreth's hand to whisper "... the swords."

Starguard smiled at that. "Aye, lad. All you know would be worth a silver. And maybe a little more."

The kid pulled Starguard forward, and whispered in his ear. "It's the old Goat, down by the tannery. They set up shop there; Big Joe says he'll train all comers, if he approves 'em. Don't know what he does to the bad ones though ...

Tilara hmmed to herself, the stage whisper all too audible. "Yuri, d'you think we might be able to pass ourselves off as recruits?"

Andreth coughed quietly. "Y'all don't want to try that. Fancy folks like you'd never fit in."

"Alright, lad, you've earned a silver...if your tip turns out good." Starguard pulled out a half-silver. "You get the other half next time you see me. I stay at the Temple of the Stars. You know where it is?"

The kid nods enthusiastically. "Father Pesci lives there. He always gives me a gold coin when I help him."

Starguard raised an eyebrow. "Nice try, kid. Go see him, and tell him 'the young swot' asked him to clean you up."

Tilara snorted at that as well. "More like a few coppers, I'd bet. But you'd do worse than to stick around with him, boy."

The kid nodded, and twisted loose before running off. Yuri looked off after the kid as he ran away. "Lad's got a lot to learn."

"There. A little more information." Starguard said, and grinned at Andreth. "Reminds me of you at that age," he ribbed the monk.

Andreth didn't seem at all perturbed. "Yeah, except I had better sense than to get mixed up wi' Big Joe." He didn't mention that the good sense in that situation was Brother Oak's, not his own.

Tilara chuckled. "He's got a lot to learn about picking pockets, that's for sure. Shall we go get that beer?"

---

"OK. So we have a Lead about Big Joe," Yuri said. "We also have a Lead about Old Stanislaus. Which shall we pursue? Or shall we split up so we can do more damage that way?"

"I'd just as soon find out what we can from Stanislaus first, and hit Joe later tonight," Tilara said.

Starguard looked up at the sun. "Almost noon," he noted.

"Ack! Noon! I have to come up with an excuse!" Yuri cried. "I have a brilliant idea! I'll try the truth! I haven't used that one yet!"

"Should we stop by and tell your brother to sign up in your place?" Tilara suggested.

Yuri nodded. "Yes. Hopefully Dad won't be there to mess it up." He turned to Andreth and Starguard. "Can we catch up with you in a bit? I have some family business to take care of, and I'd like to have Tilara there for her backbone."

Starguard sighed. "I have to admit lad, I don't see you behind a loom..."

"Course not," Andreth put in. "Ain't no loom here." Yuri boggled for a moment at Andreth. While Andreth blinked at Yuri. Obviously, if there's no loom here, Yuri can't be behind it. Made perfect sense to _him_.

"Tilara, will you accompany me to the _Grand Hall_ of the Popovs?" Yuri asked.

Tilara grinned. "Wouldn't miss this for worlds, Yuri. Let's."

---

As Tilara and Yuri left, Brother Oak walked by the standing Andreth and Starguard. "Ah, Andreth. Have you found a place then?"

Andreth nodded. "Got a job helping catch some thieves."

Brother Oak looked impressed. "Ah. Horse thieves? I'd heard there was a rash of those, today. Always a bad thing."

"That too." Andreth said. "It started out being sword thieves, but one of 'em stole a horse getting away."

Brother Oak nodded slowly. "A goodly job. But one that won't last out the summer. And next Hiring Fair isn't till Harvest time. Have you given that a thought, son?"

Andreth's face showed that he obviously hadn't, any more than Yuri had thought about anything except getting out of the job _he_ didn't want. He rubbed his chin slowly as Brother Oak sat down on a handy bench. "Well, there's always odd jobs floating around. I can keep an ear open, if that will help. But perhaps come Harvest time you could find a longer contract?"

Starguard shrugged. "If there's no work here, there will be in another town, Brother Oak. I think it would be good for Andreth to see the world anyway."

Brother Oak nodded again. "Well enough. So it's the road less travelled for you, Andreth? Mind the slugs."

Andreth quirked an eyebrow at that. "Rather slugs than stick around in _this_ town. No offense, sir."

"See?" Starguard asided to Brother Oak. "He doesn't know how nice it is here."

Brother Oak blinked. "I see, son. I did not know this company was such hardship."

Andreth shook his head. "Not you, sir. Just..." He nodded his head in the direction of the Middens.

"Ah." Brother Oak sighs. "A point well made. Still, they'll listen yet. So, tell me about your adventures when you have had them. I look forward to the tales."

Starguard smiled. "Ah, Andreth. A few days on the road and you'll be yearning for sweet Woolwich." He paused, then turned. "Say, Brother, do you know if Stanislaus has come into town? We think he may be of help."

Brother Oak looked at Brother Starguard. "Stanislaus? Sure. He's inside now, drinking his third and last ale. Then it's off for supplies and a visit to Father Pesci, and he'll be off again."

"Pardon us, then." Staguard said. "We should catch him before he leaves."

Brother Oak waved them off. "Go then, lads, and good hunting."

---

As Yuri and Tilara headed across the green for the Grand Hall of the Mighty Popovs, they spotted young Ilya dancing with a girl. _o/~ Ribbons in her hair and knots on her shoes, and she shall have pretties wherever she goes... o/~_

Yuri grinned the grin of the cat that's about to eat the canary, and approached Ilya, arm around Tilara, while Ilya danced energetically. Yuri called to his brother. "Ilya! Brother! You're looking well! Who is your friend?"

Ilya danced the girl out of the crowd, before kissing her enthusiastically and wetly on the lips. "Brother, meet the love of my life, the bloom of my youth, the mother of my children! In short, I present Elena!"

"Mother of your children?" asked Yuri, teasingly. "Brother, it appears that there are things you have not been sharing with the rest of the family!"

"And how are you going to support all these children?" added in Tilara, looking at Yuri significantly.

"Not yet, of course," Ilya said through a grin. "I've barely begun to convince her. But she will be. Look at these stitches, Yuri! They're - they're exquisite! They're breathtaking! I only wish I could weave cloth worthy of her needle..."

Yuri bowed to Elena. "Ilya, Elena, this is Tilara. You may remember her from a few summers ago."

Elena smiled, blushing, and holds Ilya's arm tightly. "I'm honored. But don't believe a word Ilya says. We only met today."

"'Weave cloth worthy of her needle?" Yuri smiled. "Why, Ilya, what an excellent idea! It's clear, you should refine your skill at the loom! You deserve to learn from a master!"

Ilya's eyes opened wide. "A master? But father said ... but I'm too ... a master? How?"

Tilara grins. "Ilya, have we got an offer for you..."

Yuri grinned so broadly it was a wonder that his head didn't split open. "Why don't we go and discuss that? I see an opportunity, and we have scant time to make the most of it."

Elena looked at Ilya, her eyes glowing. "Oh Ilya, my hero! I just _knew_ you would find a solution ..."

Ilya found himself lost in Elena's eyes. "Opportunity? Oh. Sure. Go ahead, Yuri."

Yuri beamed at Elena. "Oh, Ilya's quite clever. It runs in the family."

Yuri whispered to Tilara, "Can you talk to Elena for a few minutes while I describe the plan to Ilya?"

Tilara nodded to Elena. "Let's leave the boys alone for a few minutes so they can work things out."

Ilya turned to Yuri. "Quick! Before Father changes his mind again!"

"Yes, you are right," Yuri agreed. "It's nearly noon, Pernice is waiting."

---

Yuri mumbled to Ilya, "Now, Brother, I cannot be other than forthright with you. I do not share the family's fascination with the loom. It would be a shame to waste an apprenticeship with the highest house in the guild on one such as I."

"Pernice? I get to work with Pernice?" Ilya's eyes lit up even brighter. "He only ... he only takes one apprentice every five years! And then I ... oh ..." Ilya fainted dead away.

Yuri sighed and hoisted Ilya up, fanning his face. "Come, brother. If this is to work we must both have our wits." He looked around for something cold to splash in Ilya's face.

Ilya slowly came to. "You mean it, Yuri? You're not pulling my weft? You really want to leave the guild, and the loom, and go ... adventuring? And you'll give me your spot with Pernice? And Father **agreed** to this?"

Yuri sighed, and winces. "Father... is going to be taking some time to get used to the idea. You know how he is. He'll probably be grumping about it for a few days. Or more. But I'm sure in the end he'll see the wisdom of making this decision. I mean, it's an unusual arrangement... but we'll all be happier in the end, and what else could a father want for his family?"

Ilya tilted his head at Yuri. "That's if he doesn't disown us in a fit of rage and says things he can't undo later. Perhaps after I sign the contracts, you should warn Mother?"

"Yes, I'll do that. And maybe find a way to get the old boy roaring drunk," suggested Yuri.

"Drunk is even better," Ilya agreed. "Convince him its his idea. Mention Elena a lot."

Yuri offered Ilya a hand-up. "Come, we should go and get it over with."

Ilya nodded. "Where do we meet Pernice?"

"The guild tent, at noon. It's about that time now." Yuri told his brother. Catching Tilara's eye, he waved and motioned towards the guild tent.

---

Elena turned to go with Tilara. "Isn't it wonderful? I always told Father he should let me come to Woolwich ..."

Tilara walked off with Elena, practicing her juggling as she goes. "Where'd you come from, then?"

Elena admired the juggling. "Ooooh; when I try that the eggs always break. And that makes such a mess. We're from down Red River way. Three day's travel, but Father was looking to hire a new gatekeeper, and this is the first Hiring Fair of the season."

Tilara chuckled at the younger girl. "You don't practice with eggs. Start with stones until you've got the hang of it."

Elena looked at Tilara with worship in her eyes. "Why didn't I think of stones? How foolish of me. I will start to practice tomorrow, on the way home while Father is sleeping off his hangover."

"And start with one. Practice the motion for a while..." Tilara demonstrated, a single ball arcing through the air, then rebounding from her left to her right hand, ".. until you get the hang of it, then double up, and work your way up from there. It's not going to work if you try starting with a half-dozen eggs."

Elena looked on intently, before stooping over and picking up a pebble. Carefully - if ineptly - she tried to toss it from hand to hand.

Tilara watched judiciously. "Hmm. You'll need a lot of practice, I think. I did, too... and if your embroidery is really as good as Ilya says it is, mayhaps you'd do better to stick with that. But - do what makes you happy."

Elena smiled shyly. "I will. Sewing all day can get so boring ... But they're leaving. Should we follow them?"

Tilara glanced back at the brothers. "Well... if you want, but not too closely. They'll be meeting with Pernice and trying to convince him to take Ilya instead of Yuri. Best we not get in the way. I'm going to meet some friends by the Inn, and Yuri'll know where to find me. Want to come along?"

Elena nodded. "Sure. As long as we don't leave the Green; I promised Father."

Tilara pointed to the Inn. "It's right over there. As long as we stay at the outside tables, we haven't left at all." Elena nodded, and followed Tilara.

---

Starguard led Andreth into the inn, looking over the crowd, knowing it's likely to be packed, and it was fairly crowded. People hoisted a pint or two for luck, or to seal a deal, or simply as an appetizer for the main course. In the far corner, up against the wall, an old man in leathers was sipping slowly and watching the crowd.

Andreth followed Starguard at a discreet distance as the healer smiled, and waved to the old fellow, moving through the crowd with the practiced ease of an ex-soldier. "Stanislaus! We need to talk with you."

The old man looked up slowly, his eyes half closed. After he looked Brother Starguard over carefully, he motioned at the bench. "Seat's free. Talk." Stanislaus looked as old and weathered as his leather outfit, although appearances made it hard to judge age. By the mugs in front of him, he was on his third drink and his hand was perfectly steady. There was a single dagger at his belt, and a bow, unstrung, carefully propped up in the corner.

"We're looking to track down some bandits," Starguard explained, "that left red mud all over the crime scene. Would you know anything about red mud?"

Stanislaus nodded. "Red mud; tracking the antelope and the badger."

Starguard looked confused at this pronouncement. "I'm afraid you'll have to explain, Goodsir."

Andreth stayed quiet against the wall, his head bowed, trying to look inconspicuous, or at least non-threatening.

Stanislaus shrugged. "Only red mud roundabouts is at the bottom of the red river. There's a watering hole. Good place to hunt the antelope and the badger. One for food, one for fur.

"Could you take us there when you leave?" Starguard wondered. "We think that someone's hiding weapons there."

Stanislaus shrugged. "Sure. It's just out yonder, past the bridge over the river on the road. Less than half a mile upstream. Only an idiot can miss it."

Starguard blinked. "Oh. We could find it ourselves then?"

Stanislaus looked Starguard over carefully. "Now, you don't have the look of an idiot."

"Only sometimes, Goodsir," Starguard chuckled. "But that's the same for everyone, usually. Have you paid for your drinks already? You've helped me a lot, and I'd like to pay you back if I could."

A snort. "I've drunk three, young man, and all paid for by the barkeep himself. I'll be moseying on then; give the alms to Father Pesci, he needs 'em more."

"Thank you sir. Remind me to buy one for you in the fall, then," offered Starguard, and he headed out to look for Tilara and Yuri, following Andreth for a change. Andreth looked a little nervous, but took the lead, stepping to one side at the exit to watch Tilara's performance...

---

"Ilya, Pernice knows of your work, yes?" Yuri asked as he stepped into the guild tent with his brother. "Father has shown him samples? If so, this should be over quickly."

Ilya nodded. "Pernice actually complimented me once. Father was so impressed. You weren't there, but he bragged about it to _everybody_."

Pernice looked up from his table, before standing and swiping all the paper to one side. "Yuri! I am so glad to see you. Sit. Sit, boy, sit. And Ilya too? Ah, boy, come to be witness? Now, where did I .... Oh, by warp and weft, weave my own hair next!"

Yuri blinked, doing his best to look puzzled. "Sign? Sir? But Ilya is here to sign, and I am here to witness."

"Sign?" Pernice looked at Yuri. "But Ilya. You're too young, aren't you? And Yuri, I distinctly remember Moshi entreating me to take you on. Last hope, he said. Last hope."

Ilya looked uncomfortable as Yuri began his pitch. "Ilya is 16, and already twice the weaver that I am. It is **much** more fitting that someone of his talent train with masters. If you only take one apprentice in five years, why, by the time Ilya would get another chance to learn from you, he'd be far too old!"

Pernice nodded slowly. "A splendid point, Yuri. A splendid point. Well, it's nice to see that Moshi has found a better match for you then, boy. I know he was worried."

Ilya looked overjoyed. "Oh Master! I promise, on my honor, to serve you faithfully with all the devotion of a son!"

Tilara slips Elena a few coins. "Here, get an ale or something for us while I start my act." She smiles at the folks sitting outside the Inn at the tables set up for the crowded Fair, starts juggling a bit, trying to arouse a bit of interest.

Pernice smiled at Ilya. "I'm sure you will, son, and I'm glad for you, Yuri. You'd never have made an honorable weaver. Now, Ilya, sign here ... and here. And Yuri? Sign here. And here. And here's your copy, son. I expect to see you at dawn tomorrow, to string the looms."

Yuri nodded to Master Pernice, trying to stifle a grin. "Probably not, good sir. But there's more than one way to earn honor. I shall find another. You've known my father longer than I have. He's stubborn but in the end he just wants his family to be happy. It may take some time for him to be completely comfortable with the idea, but in the end he knows that this is the best use of all our talents."

Yuri waited for Ilya to finish the formalities, signed his witness, and clapped Ilya on the back. "Come, brother! We have much to do! Celebrations! News to deliver!"

Pernice nodded. "Now get along, boys. I've got contracts to sign. And where's ... ah, there it is. Run along, lads. It's not morning yet!"

"Ilya, I am forever in your debt," Yuri said as the happy brother left the tent. "I know not what the future holds, save that it shall hold several favors that I will gift upon you."

Ilya's eyes shone bright. "And I owe you my life, my happiness, and my future," he replied. "Oh, my brother, her father cannot refuse consent now!"

---

As Elena slipped inside, holding the coins tightly, a few catcalls rose up behind her as people cried for more balls, more balls...

"Patience, patience, folks," said Tilara as she added another pair while she talked. "Don't want to start the act with the grand finale, after all..."

The crowd settled in to watch Tilara, waiting for the first dropped ball, but Tilara wasn't dropping any today. After a bit, she added another pair to get up to 7, grinning at the group. "Now this is a bit too easy. Someone want to toss an empty mug to me?" One of the audience obliged, and she added the mug to the cycle, eight objects sailing through the air.

Tilara set the mug down after a bit, keeping the balls in the air as she did, and let the balls drop into it. _Plunkplunkplunk_. "That's the warm-up. Balls are easy, after all, and hardly interesting for a sophisticated group such as yourselves. Needs a bit of spicing up, it does..." she gathered up some mugs and pulled a brace of knives out of her pouch. This time the pattern was alternating mugs and daggers, the knives (blunted, actually, but they _looked_ sharp) flashing through the air.

The audience was spellbound. Not a single catcall. And barely any wincing.

Starguard tried to get Tilara's attention, as he hung on the edge of the crowd, encouraging her to 'cut' her performance short.

Tilara grinned at Starguard, and mouthed 'Yuri?' to him. She continued the act and her banter, working with various objects ready to hand, and at one point, had Mirra jump through the circle of flashing objects.

Starguard nodded, and starts searching the crowd to get everyone back together to share his news.

---

Yuri looked around for Elena, so she could get his news first, and said quietly to Ilya, "Well, don't rush in, little brother. If you truly did meet her just today, you'd do well to settle into your apprenticeship before making any plans."

Ilya, unhearing, tugged on Yuri's hand. "Elena! We must go tell her! She can start her trousseau tonight!"

Yuri sighed, and thinks to himself, _And they always said that _I_ was the impulsive one._

Ilya pulled eagerly. "I can see Tilara is working her magic! Come watch?" Yuri nodded, and let his brother lead the way.

Soon, Ilya joined Elena, and happily relieves her of one of her mugs. After draining more than half, he began to whisper eagerly in her ear while Yuri watched carefully. She looked surprised, and blushed often.

Yuri grins and waved to Elena, then looked around for Starguard or Andreth. Tilara appeared busy. Andreth was easy enough to spot in a crowd, of course, when he's not trying to hide his face. Which he wasn't.

Elena turned to face Ilya, and suddenly hugged him closely. "That's wonderful! Come tell Father!" she exclaimed, and dragged him off into the Inn.

---

Starguard spotted Yuri, and pointed him out to Tilara, as he watched her act, impressed with her skills.

Tilara concentrated a bit - this was technically cheating, for a juggler, but as long as it worked in the act... prestidigitation always impresseed the folks. She was working on knives and balls now, and with the help of the minor spell, they all vanished one by one at the top of the arc. She acted disgruntled, peering at the spot. "All right, where'd they go..." Just as she finished her words, they reappeared and fell, while she managed to field them all.

And the crowd erupts in applause. Several customers try to see if Tilara can field coins as well as she can knives, and even Starguard chuckled at the finale, clapping with the crowd. Andreth's eyes widened - he was simply astonished by the performance. Certainly not as impressed as when Brother Oak wiped the alleyway with a certain young and injudicious (and scar-faced) mugger, but impressed even so.

Tilara grinned and bows. "I think that's all for now, folks, the gremlins do appear to be about. Thank you, thank you..." Mirra sat up on her back legs and holds a small pouch for donations.

A few children came up, shyly, coaxed by their parents, and dropped small coins in the pouch. One pet Mirra very cautiously. The coins that were thrown to Tilara go into a brief juggling loop and dropped one by one into the pouch. Mirra purred for the brave kid.

"You're good," he stated Starguard as he came up, "Extremely so."

Tilara grinned at Starguard and whispered. "Thank you. It's taken a lot of practice over the years to learn that. It's a lot safer than picking pockets, though..."

Yuri sidled up to the group. "I've got to go speak to my mother, and then my personal business is done. What have we learned here?"

Tilara looked annoyed. "That Ilya swiped my beer."

Yuri chuckles. "Ah, there but for the grace of the Gods..."

Starguard said, "That the bandits are hiding near the Red River."

Andreth opened his mouth, only to have the question answered for him. "...what Starguard said," he finally adds.

"The river bottom, a few miles away, easier to find than anything, apparently." Starguard expanded.

Tilara grumbled. "That's thirsty work, it is..." She ordered another one, and drank it fairly quickly as the group got ready to move out.

---

Information was exchanged, and soon the party was packed up for an overnighter out of the town. It was getting into afternoon, and who knew how long they had to get the weapons.

Yuri's mother thought it was a splendid idea, but appreciated the advance warning, promising to think of a way to deal with Yuri's father. On the other hand, she suggested Yuri made herself very very scarce for a while. Yuri agreed, telling his mother that he would more than likely be out-of-town for a few days chasing Jane's bandits anyway, and he'd probably feel safer facing down an armed mob than his father, anyway.

Yuri jogged up to Jane's, dressed in traveling clothes and a soft leather jerkin. He had also picked up a small rucksack. His gear looked new but slightly dusty, like it was bought new but only used a few times over several years.

Starguard had grabbed his pack, but otherwise hadn't changed, his vestments good for traveling. After all, The Stars are gods of travel. He also put on his leather armor and his mace rested at his hip.

Mirra twined through Tilara's legs, meowing. Tilara had changed from the flashy performer's outfit into a much more practical one - leggings and tunic, with a cloak for cool or wet weather. She picked up her familiar, again touching noses before placing the cat on her shoulder.

"Mother took it well," Yuri murmured to Tilara. "She understands much better than Dad and she's promised to try and smooth the rough seas. Nevertheless, she suggested that I make myself scarce for a few days."

Tilara nodded. "No surprise. Your mother always did have more sense than your father about some things. I think we can manage scarceness for a bit."

"I'd rather face an angry mob of brigands than my own house tonight," admitted Yuri. "I feel sorry for Ilya, but he's so smitten with Elena, I don't think we have to worry that he's going to feel hoodwinked."

---

Taking the River Road, the party passed by the Merchant Houses on their way out of town. They were joined by a dwindling collection of carts heading out of town, a few celebrating apprentices, and many happy farmers eager to get home before the evening milking. The Red River, itself, was about a day's walk west of town, and was still a few hours away when dusk falls.

"How far to this watering hole?" Yuri asked. "And do we intend to go all the way there this evening?"

Starguard sighed, noticing the sun going down. "We're not going to make it, folks. Do you want to get there at night, and just watch, or show up in the morning?"

"We've had a full day already." Tilara noted. "I suggest we sleep for a bit. If we want to get there at dusk, we can do it tomorrow."

Mirra rejoined the party. _Noise of sawing logs?_

Starguard nodded. "We don't want them to escape, but we don't want to go after them in the middle of the night either."

Yuri hmmed. "I can think of advantages to both ways. However, it's been a long day for everyone - the bandits included - and we're unlikely to lose them by waiting one evening. So my bet's on camping out."

Starguard smiles. "Right. I'll cook supper."

Tilara nodded. "They might be setting up to ambush a merchant or two on the way home from the Spring Fair. That'll keep them around while we sneak up on 'em."

Every two hours or so they had passed a camp site by the side of the road, obviously prepared for travelers. There was another one such where they had stopped now. The site was recessed a little from the road, with a few trees affording a little privacy, and a fire pit ready to go. And there was a small pile of firewood by the fire pit. Looked like the last party forgot to replenish it. There was also a small spring.

Starguard began rummaging around his pack for soup stock, and pots, and his waterskin, trying to come up with the fixings for a decent meal. Starguard hmmed as he prepared. "Does Mirra like raw beef, Tilara? I brought a few bits along for the soup..."

Mirra overheard the word 'beef' through her mistress, and sidled up to Starguard, purring happily. Yuri took his cues from Brother Starguard as to what to do, because this whole 'roughing it' thing was new to him. Starguard supervised as some set up a lean-to, and others fetched firewood.

Starguard fed the feline little tidbits as he stoked the fire up, mixing ingredients together, perhaps spicing it a bit too much, but he liked it that way. Andreth helped with anything that requires a good strong back, but tried not to get in the way otherwise.

---

Soon the camp looked distinctly homey, as the air is deodorized with the smell of well-spiced soup and the lean-to began to look quite comfortable. The wood pile is growing nicely, and the spring water is remarkably fresh.

"So, Brother..." Yuri asked, "how do we do watches?"

Andreth looked around. "Watch?" he asked.

"That's where you guard the camp while others are sleeping," Yuri deadpanned, "so that we don't get surprised by bandits."

Andreth's eyes widened in comprehension, and he nodded. "Okay..."

Starguard chuckled. "Right. So who wants first watch tonight? Could be creatures out in the woods. Though probably not many this close to the road."

Yuri pondered this. "I will. That means I get to sleep through the night. I don't think I could sleep, anyway," Yuri admitted. "I'm too excited. I'm finally free!"

Tilara shrugged. "I can take second."

Starguard nodded, "I'll go last, if you don't mind. I need to pray before sunrise. And then cycle them another night? That seems fair..." he smiled, and worked on his soup, bringing it too a simmer as he snuck Mirra another bit of beef, right from the pot.

_Happy dead cow_ came the thought from the cat.

Starguard rubs Mirra's ears. "Cats are good luck. Well, in my book. Not everyone thinks so highly of them..." He said as Mirra lightly bopped Starguard in the shin happily.

"So, Brother. You've done this before?" Yuri asked.

Starguard nodded. "A few times. I was a Doctor down on the Lurinorian border. With the army for twenty years."

"And why does Father Pesci treat you like you're fifteen?" Yuri wondered.

Starguard grinned at Yuri. "Sort of a running gag. I am new to the cleric hood, and Father Pesci tried to teach me by the book. Unfortunately, the book calls for a different sort of age gap..." He chuckled.

Tilara chuckled. "A few times, indeed. You finally decided that magical healing would by helpful, I take it?"

Starguard sighed. "Those were...interesting times." He stirred the fire a little as he idly stroked the feline. "It's a very violent place, down there. And no, I didn't really decide anything. You see, Father and Mother Star...well, they visited me one night a few years ago..." he snapped up straight, shaking his head. "But you don't want to hear the dreams of an old man." He said, and changed the subject. "What are you going to do after this, Yuri?"

Andreth sat by the fire, looking out into the night and listening to the conversation as Yuri considered the question. "I'm not sure, yet. I'd like to travel a bit, get the feel of the larger world, maybe make and lose a few fortunes as a trader. The specifics are still open to interpretation."

Tilara chuckled at Yuri. "Sounds good. Think you'll need help for the losing half of that...." She turned to her familiar abruptly and stared into her eyes for a moment, then looks up. "Horse coming."

Yuri blinked, and looked up and down the road as Mirra jumped off Starguard's lap and disappeared into the darkness.

Starguard nodded, unconcerned, and smelled the soup. "Hmm. About ready. I hope you like it spicy... Hmm?" He peered out towards the road. "She going to go check it out, Til? That's quite a small friend you have there."

Yuri watched the cat go. "That's really something."

Andreth stepped unnoticed away from the fire and hid in the shadows by one of the trees.

Tilara nodded. "She's good about things like that. I raised her from a kitten.. for a while she was the only friend I had." It only took a few moments for Mirra to return. _Man on horse running_ she thought to her owner as the sound of the hooves became more obvious, raising to a crescendo.

Tilara passed on the thought message. "Just one man on a horse, galloping." She paused. _Kiel? Big black-hair we hunt for?_

_grey_

Starguard hmmed. "Someone should go take a look at his face," he whispered.

"She doesn't think it's Kiel," Tilara reported. "Shall we go look before he's passed?"

"I'll go," Yuri volunteered. Before more is said, Yuri melted into the shadows at a fast walk, moving towards the road, Andreth slipping through the shadows behind him. The horseman never slowed down, his cape streaming behind him in the wind. Silver shone on his tack, and the horse was only a darker shadow in the night.

Starguard moved the soup so it doesn't burn...and tossed a piece of beef to Mirra for her work, which Mirra promptly pounced on and gobbled it up, before going to thank Starguard again. As the sound of hooves fade away again.

Yuri came back, and shrugged. "One rider, moving really fast. Could have been anyone."

Andreth returned right behind and nodded. "Didn't see 'im clearly either."

Starguard hmmed, and ladled out the soup. "Perhaps we should leave early tomorrow," he mused. The heavy spicing wafted up from the steaming bowls. It was good, just strong.

Yuri resumed watching the road as Starguard did the dishes with the spring water. There were a few more stories that night before bed...

---

Yuri watched carefully, eyes propped wide open. But the only excitement seemed to have been the horseman. And the owls. Two of them so far. But it was time to wake Tilara up.

Tilara murmured in her sleep, in Lurinese.. _"You even think about joining me, Galmeth, and I'll roast your chestnuts once and for all..._", before waking all the way up. "Time already? Just a moment..."

---

Tilara paced to stay awake as the late evening slowly changed into early morning, and eventually roused Starguard to take the third watch. "Don't let the owls spook you. They seem to be thick around here."

Starguard came up quickly, stretching. "Right. Sleep well." He found an fairly uncomfortable spot, and sat down to watch, while Yuri snored quietly.

_hoot hoot hoot_

---

Before dawn, Starguard heard something, and turned to see a couple of human figures sneaking up in the woods. His crossbow was pointed in a flash as he used the lumpy rock for some cover. "**Halt! Who goes there!**" he yelled, his voice echoing through camp, hoping to wake the party...

A bag flew through the air, but landed about six feet short, while Mirra jumped on Tilara's face, anxiously batting her on the cheek, claws just barely sheathed. Once Tilara stirred, Mirra faded into the darkness. An arrow flew overhead, landing in the bushes across the campsite.

Yuri awoke quickly, sitting bolt upright, then lying back down again to avoid being a target. Andreth, hearing the cry, rolled over and got his feet under him, looking up at Starguard to see where he was aiming.

Starguard sent a crossbow bolt whizzing through the air, sending it into a tree near a figure with a thunk. "Get up!" he shouted. "We're being attacked!"

Tilara woke up at her familiar's insistence, and frowned at Starguard's yell. She paused to get her bearings, then reached out for her quarterstaff. Yuri grabbed the lead sap off of his pack, where he'd left it for the night, and crouched facing the onslaught, while Mirra meowed plaintively from the darkness.

Starguard aimed his crossbow for another shot, but was suitably surprised as a leather bag hit him in the chest, breaking open to cover him with some sort of sticky stuff. Quickly, it hardened, holding him in place, making it hard to move... He curses loudly, trying to get off another shot... and misses, sending it bouncing off the branches, while a second arrow flies over head.

Tilara saw the figures indistinctly in the trees and moved toward the nearest. _No sense in staying there until I get hit by something..._ She tried to get a clear shot at as many of them as she can before concentrating on the spell she first set off as a teenager. The wizards called it 'Burning Hands.' She grinned nastily as the flames lick out from her fingers, washing over both of the attacking figures.

One fell, ablaze, the other screaming in pain, as Yuri scurried around the edge of the camp, looking for people to thump with his sap. He saw the rush of flame, pulling up to avoid running into it, then dived at the standing bandit, but miscalculated and sailed past him into the brush.

The burning figure stops and rolls to the ground, putting out the fires, while Mirra disappears into the underbrush. Andreth sprung from his bedroll and plunged into the underbrush, confronting the hapless would-be attacker and landed a punishing kick in the ribs. There was a crunching sound, and a strangled cry as the victim stopped moving.

Tilara put out the other bandit - or whatever he is - who had stopped writhing in pain. "Any idea who these clowns are?" Mirra had vanished from sight, but she kept part of her mind in touch with her mistress. _Let us know if you find anything, love._

Starguard tried to scrape the goo off on him...and quickly got his hand stuck to his foot, causing him to curse that much louder. "Could I get some help here?

Yuri crawled out of the thicket and checked the condition of the two bandits. "They're very, very unconscious, maybe dead! Or so they look to me... Brother! How art thou?"

Starguard frowned. "Stuck! Bring those two over here and I'll heal them as much as I can.

Andreth slipped away from his luckless opponent as Yuri came up, moving as quietly as he searches in the hope of finding anyone else who might have tried to crash our party.

Starguard yanked at his hand, trying to get it free, but it was stuck tight. "Stupid glue! Bring them over here so I can heal them and they can tell me where the antidote is!"

Yuri dragged the two otherwise-motionless bandits back into the clearing. Yuri oofed. "These two are heavy. Andreth! Got a moment?

Tilara came back, fetching her belt knife to see if she could cut through the gunk that had been dumped all over the cleric. "Weird. What _is_ this stuff?" she asked as she worked at scraping the stuff off of Starguard, making slow progress. "Yuk. Maybe wine would work?"

Andreth came out of the underbrush and helped Yuri carry the motionless bodies. "I couldn't see any more... if there are any, they're lying low."

Starguard placed one hand \_very\_ lightly on the nearer fellow as he was dragged in, and prayed to the stars as they shone down. With a few words, a slight warmth filled the prone bandit...but he wasn't going anywhere soon, Starguard bet.

Mirra playfully batted at Starguard's foot after sending a simple _loneliness_ at her mistress. In a second, it was stuck fast. Tilara noticed Mirra just a moment too late to keep her familiar from sticking her foot in the sap. "NO!... oh, dear." Mirra meowed, trying to pull loose. "Don't move, love, you'll make it worse." She fetches a wineskin over, hoping that the gunk will wash off easier than it scrapes.

Yuri bound the bandits hand and foot after they are healed, but before they came to. "Will they live, Brother?"

Starguard pulled his fingers back, and healed the other with few words and a small pulse of blue. "They should be allright, with bed rest. Unless they go terminal. I can look after them a bit more in the morning."

"I'll help watch for the rest of the night, Brother Starguard," Andreth said. "The others should finish sleeping."

"Perhaps Starguard should sleep. That gunk looks...exhausting," Yuri suggested.

The two men lay prone on the ground, their worn clothes badly singed. Only the armor - leather freshly reinforced with studs - looked somewhat new. Blood leaked out of the mouth of the man on the left, while the other just moaned occasionally.

"Maybe we can get some answers out of them tomorrow," Yuri said. "And we should bring them back to town, just in case they turn out to be someone's sons."

"Here," Starguard held out his unstuck hand. "I was supposed to be up anyway, and let Andreth keep me company. I can scrape myself free if you'll lend me the knife."

Tilara yawns. "No problem, as soon as I get Mirra loose..."

---

Tilara was still working on it when it started to flake off a few minutes later. The rest of the night passed uneventfully. Mirra spent the rest of the watch carefully and very thoroughly grooming her paw, while Starguard scritched the feline gently while he worked, and sent Andreth back to bed. He relaxed until the Mother Star rose. Yuri had propped the two prisoners against a tree, and covered them with his blanket, then slumped back to sleep.

In the morning, which dawned bright and clear, the carnage became a little more visible. Brother Starguard was covered head to toe in dandruff-like flakes. Halfway between him and the place the men were hiding a leather bag was lying on the ground. Behind the tree a greatclub and a short bow had been dropped. Both were lightly singed.

Yuri carefully examined the area where the bandits fell, looking for other things they may have dropped. Then he searched the bandits themselves.

Tilara stirred as the light strengthens, and sat up to watch Yuri search the bandits. "Find anything useful?"

"If these guys are bandits, they aren't very good at it." Yuri told her. "Besides their weapons, they've got less than three silvers between them." He held up a scrap of cloth and a grocery list. "Less interesting than pocket lint. The arrows do have one of Jane's marks on them, but we don't know if they bought them today or if they're part of the swag. Perhaps we should bring it back and ask Jane?"

"I don't know if she'd be able to tell, anyway. Let's continue on," Tilara said. Then noticed something in Yuri's spread of the contents of the bandit's pockets. "Hmm... that red string. Did they both have one?"

"They went down quick, too." Andreth said. "That fire dropped one of 'em right off."

Starguard says, "We know where our targets are. This just told us that they may use this glue..." He picked up the bag carefully.

"Seems to be a pretty exotic item," Yuri commented.

"Effective, too," testified Starguard. "So, what should we do with these two?"

Yuri looked them over. "Ask them some pointy questions, then haul them in to town?"

"Hmm. If they'd both had the red string, I'd think it was an identification badge. With just one... who knows?" She pondered the bandits. "We're not heading toward town just yet. D'you think they'll survive if we just leave them here, Starguard?"

Andreth checked their boots for red mud. As Starguard shook his head. "I don't think leaving them alone is a good idea."

"Some small caravans will still be coming into town," Yuri reminded. "We can ask them to take them back."

Andreth tapped red splashes on their boots. "We oughta ask 'em some questions, at least. This one, anyway," he says, indicating the one he didn't kick last night. "Dunno if the other one's up to sayin' much for a while, 'less Starguard heals him some more."

Yuri took a look at the boots. "Andreth's got a point, there. This one probably knows something." He pondered ways of waking them up.

"I'd rather not kill them, but I don't see much reason to go out of our way to help them, either," Tilara decided. "They attacked us, after all. Turn 'em loose when we leave, and let 'em take their chances, is my vote."

Starguard nodded. "Leave 'em tied to a tree, with a note reading "Bandits" on their chest. But for now..." The healer moved to the less injured one, hands reading, mind full of spells.
