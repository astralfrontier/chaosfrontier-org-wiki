Game Log: Chapter 4 - Scouts Are Always Prepared


----------------------------------------------------

The brave (and well-chewed) heroes rested in their cave. Yuri and Starguard were recovering from their wounds, while Andreth fetched wood and Tilara fussed. It was now three days since Jane hired them; only eleven remained.

"Since it's going to be evening before we're ready to move, perhaps we should try going to the farm near nightfall," Yuri suggested. "I'd really like to do some investigation before we head back to town; it would be a shame to walk all this way for nothing."

_Yuri is a young man of average height and wiry build, with sandy blonde hair and an easy, fluid demeanor. He has a ready smile and a glimmer in his eye. He is dressed in a leather jerkin, light wool trousers, soft boots, and a fine wool cloak, all in subdued grey tones. The hilt of a rapier is visible at his belt; otherwise, he seems rather lightly equipped._

Tilara nodded. "That should work. The dogs are still pretty much out of the picture."

_Tilara is a young woman both pretty and possessing that indefinable presence that transforms mere attractiveness into beauty. She has bright red-gold hair and laughing emerald eyes in a tanned face. Her graceful and athletic figure is partially hidden by the practical traveling clothes she wears, dark green tunic and brown leggings with black boots and a dark grey cloak. She carries a quarterstaff, and her tortoise-shell cat is usually either riding her shoulder or twining about her feet._

"We can still go on, but I think we still need some sleep," Starguard offered. "I think that everyone will be as right as rain in the morning,though. You've only got a few bruises left, it looks like. Mirra said the dogs were back, though, so they'll know we're there.

_Brother Starguard is a tall man, strangely dressed in the brown work clothes of the acolyte cleric. The strange part is because he seems too old to be an student in the church. His thick, bushy, mustache and beard, once black, is now salt and pepper, the darkness interspersed with star-like flecks of white. His face is light and lively, blue eyes sparkling, though with a few hard wrinkles, a few laugh lines. His nose is a bit hawkish, giving him a bit of an intense look. His body seems in decent shape, if not particularly strong, but most of his form is hidden beneath the cloth of his clothes. He wears a midnight blue robe, short, with easy release clips so that he doesn't get caught by it in a fight. Depending on the situation, he may also wear his studded leather armor, but always has his morning star at his hip, in case of trouble. He walks more like a soldier than a priest...but the wooden symbol of the two stars entwined hung on the leather strap states otherwise._

Andreth quietly brought in more firewood, while Tilara fretted at the delay. She put the time to good use, however, having Mirra scout out the farmstead. Finally, when everyone was healed and ready to go. Mirra returned after her scouting. _Men. Barn. No cows. No pigs. No chickens. Whimpering dogs._

---

  
As night fell, the party members slowly creaked to their feet, and did a few limbering up exercises. As they followed Mirra to the forest's edge, there was plenty of music to keep them occupied, the spring mating calls of the many birds sounding in the night. The farmhouse sat in a large somewhat rounded clearing. It consisted of a large barn, and a taller, but smaller, house, attached to one side. The house was lit, lantern light shining in the windows.

Yuri turned to the others, "We should wait here a bit and see if anything moves outside," he murmured.

Starguard held back, worried. His spell casting was drained from the healing acts performed until he could see the Mother Star and ask her for blessings. "Agreed," he whispered. "I don't want to make any hasty moves."

Tilara nodded and murmured, "Mirra says there's men in the barn, too. Let's not get caught between them."

Yuri looked around for a convenient hiding spot at the edge of the clearing. "How about we crawl into the bushes? Or would the low-hanging branches of the trees at the edge be better?" Deciding on the bushes, Yuri dropped to a crawl and slithered into the bushes at the edge of the clearing, then sat motionless, watching the barn. Andreth, Starguard and Tilara set up behind the young lad, staying well away from the tree edge, and as quiet as possible.

The barn sat eyelessly, watching nobody. From within came the faint sounds of metal striking metal, overlaid with the whimperings of badly wounded dogs. The lantern light in the farmhouse window never flickered.

The sounds continued for a good twenty minutes, before they came to a halt. In the silence the party heard an inside door slam shut. The lantern in the window dimmed for a moment, as a hand passed before it. A second door somewhere shut.

Yuri motioned for someone to come up to join him at the tree edge. Starguard looked over at Tilara, giving her a questioning look asking wordlessly if she wanted to go. She nodded back and moved forward, as slowly and quietly as she could manage.

"It seems pretty quiet," Yuri whispered as Tilara came up to lay beside her. "Maybe they were doing weapons practice in the barn. You wanna ask Mirra to try sneaking closer?"

Tilara nodded. _Mirra, love? One more time, please. Can you sneak into the barn?_ Mirra rubbed her nose against Tilara's hand in reply, before the feline disappeared into the bushes. A few moments later a dark shadowy form slid across the clearing, dissapearing into the barn's shadow.

---

  
Some minutes later, Mirra butted Tilara's hand again. _Doors closed._

"Interesting," Tilara quietly informed Yuri. "The barn is in good enough shape not to have any gaps for her to get in. Thought this place was supposed to be abandoned?"

"Abandoned doesn't always mean decrepit, it seems." Yuri replied. "Still, I can't imagine a bunch of bandits taking the time to patch all the holes in the walls. Do we know if there's any lights showing in windows on the other side of the house?"

Tilara nodded, and turned to Mirra again. _Lights in back?_

Mirra looked up. _One lantern, this side. Smell roasting dead cow._

"Maybe we should try sneaking up from the other side," Yuri mused. "It doesn't look like they're being very organized about the perimeter here.

Tilara shook her head. "No. Just the one lantern. Someone's cooking. I do hope that little weasel wasn't lying to us."

"Well, I think we've seen what we're gonna see from the outside. Let's get closer."

Tilara nods. "Let's at least check if this is the right place. Andreth, what does Big Joe look like?"

Andreth smiled at Tilara. "Exactly the way his name suggests. He's tall, and very, very muscular."

"Any distinguishing marks?" Tilara asked. "That could be any tall farmer, y'know."

Andreth shook his head. "Huge muscles. You'll know, the moment you see him."

---

  
Yuri pulled his blackjack out of his sleeve, and moved to lead the party around the edge of the clearing to the side without the lantern before he noticed the old healer's frown. "We're gonna try to avoid any needless bloodshed, if that's what you're worried about, Starguard. I know it would be safer to wait, but time's a-wastin', and during the day they'll be able to see us."

"No, I'm just wondering what's the hurry?" Starguard shrugged. "They're there, and not leaving yet, it appears. Wouldn't it be better to wait until we feel up to our best? Look, folks. Just cause three of the dogs found us doesn't mean there aren't others, or twenty men, or -"

Yuri hmmed, thinking about getting mauled by a dog. A mangy, measly cur...

"Let's just see what we can see," Tilara suggested. "We're not going to start a fight tonight, Starguard. And Mirra's pretty sure there aren't any other dogs."

Starguard chuckled. "I'll trust a cat to know that, I guess. If you're set for this...well, if you're taking Tilara, we might as well all go."

"Maybe if I go alone?" Yuri asked. "I'm sure I can get away from anyone who tries to stop me."

Tilara considered. "All right," she agreed. "I'll keep watch. You want to take Mirra along with you?"

Yuri says, "Sounds good to me. I'm sure she can keep up."

Starguard nodded his agreement with the idea, though reluctantly, and Yuri moved off around the edge of the clearing on his own. _I hope I don't end up tripping over the cat,_ he thought to himself.

---

  
At first Yuri moved easily through the bushes, heading around the building. Escaping the lantern's light, he moved into the clearing now seeing the other side of the barn, as dark and dreary as the first, the house a gloomy shadow attached to the barn. The clearing, on his side, appeared empty. He slipped across the clearing to the side of the barn, and then along the wall, looking for a door or other entrance.

There were no obvious doors along the side of the barn. Only at the far end were the two double doors, clearly locked, and a smaller opening above, with some kind of joist, possibly for hay. In the other direction along the wall of the barn was the house, built right up against the barn, and then the porch, covered in shadows.

Yuri listened at the barn door to see if he could hear anything inside, perhaps the sound of snoring. Nothing. He check the door's lock, the old large, rusty padlock holding as he pulled on it. Glancing up at the hay mow, he considered the climb.

Mirra took one look at Yuri's intent face and faded into the shadows along the side of the barn. Yuri chuckled silently, and followed the feline, sliding around the side of the house.

---

  
As Yuri left, Starguard moved up as close to the edge as he dared, watching Yuri and Mirra slink through the shadows. His hand rested on his crossbow, the instrument loaded, as he watched for signs of trouble. Andreth lay a slight bit closer to the clearing, Tilara a little behind and to one side.

Suddenly, a step, another to where Tilara was on the ground behind him caught his attention, but too late! The knife was already held in his back. The healer swore silently, his hands raising slowly, and empty. "Good evening, sir or madam..."

Tilara froze, the feel of cold steel against her spine. "Ah... yes?"

"Right," whispered a voice behind Tilara. "Stand up slowly, and no funny gestures, or she buys it."

Turning, Andreth saw the two bandits, knives in place. Nothing to be done, he slowly rose to his feet, his hands fists at his side, eyes downcast.

"Any particular reason you're putting knives to the back of people looking down at a farm in the woods?" Starguard asked, trying to sound reasonable.

"Hah. Ferg'll tell you that. Come along now." The knife dug deeper for a moment, pushing Starguard forward. Starguard moved quietly, hands high, not willing to risk Tilara's life by breaking first.

The knife braced in Tilara's back dug in a little deeper as well. "And now you, missy. Slow and steady, and let's walk towards the light. You there, walk on ahead," and a hand waved Andreth forward. Andreth, in turn started walking slowly forwards.

Tilara leaned slightly forward, getting up as the knife pressure relaxed slightly. She kept her mouth shut, but warned her familiar to stay hidden. _Keep out of the way for now, love. We'll see how this goes. Be ready._

---

  
Mirra hid beside Yuri, butting his hand as the fivesome walked slowly into the clearing. Yuri rubbed a spot behind Mirra's ear as he watched them come. "I know, kitty. I see." He considered. Two bandits against three people was poor odds, but three versus one... _If I can take one out..._

Andreth kept his eyes and ears open as he marched, biding his time. Inwardly, he reflected that, just a few short years ago, he wouldn't have had the patience to wait for a better moment.

The moment came, an arrow flying between Starguard and Andreth, with a soft buzz. The guards stiffened at the noise, reflexively pushing forward on the daggers.

As the arrow thumped into a bandit, Starguard yelped as he felt the sharp press of the dagger break skin. But he was already moving forward, spinning as he drew his mace. Tilara had twitched earlier, at the sound of the arrow's flight, and had managed to break away from her captor quickly enough to suffer only a small scratch. _Mirra! What'd you let him do **that** for?_

She moved away, pulling a dagger out of her belt, glaring as her former captor moved towards her. "I don't think I want to talk to Ferg." Dropping her dagger, her hands came up, the guttural syllables of a spell directing the flames as they emerged from her fingers.

The man shrieked in agony as the fire licked over him, dropping to the ground, rolling to douse himself. Yuri ran up towards his comrades, stopping a short distance away to cover the fight with his bow.

"Surrender or die!" called Starguard, his mace swinging out, ready to retaliate.

Andreth had whirled on the sound of the screams behind him, and rushed to Starguard's side, ready to deliver a deadly blow, but stopped short as Starguard demanded surrender. He waited a moment beside Starguard, letting the thug to decide how lucky he felt.

The bandit snarled at Starguard. "Die, scum!" Dropping his dagger and pulling out his shortsword, he slashed at Starguard.

As the bandit charged in, Andreth and Starguard struck as one, swinging hard at the incoming target. The punch whistled over the guard's head as he ducked an inside, his sword pushing right through Starguard's gut. The priest's eyes widened in shock, crying out as he slumped to the ground, hands clutching his belly.

---

  
Andreth let out an incoherent yell as Starguard went down, seeing red. His kick was wild, sailing past the thug's ear as he attacked, as his control vanished in a cloud of anger.

Tilara took aim at the burning thug, but missed as he thrashed around on the ground. Hearing Starguard's yell, she winced as Starguard went down. "Oh, gods.. we've got to get out of here. Finish him off, already."

The bandit wasted not a moment's thought over Starguard's prone body, immediately turning and slashing at Andreth, opening up a long gash along his ribs.

Yuri growled as the second bandit opened a cut on Andreth. Dropping his bow, he pulled out his rapier, running up to engage the bandit.

Tilara stepped back as the bandit managed to put out the flames, missing with a hasty throw with her dagger. She pulled her third out, backpedaling. Her eyes widening as the bandit scrambled to his feet and charged. She called her power again, and the flames washed over her assailant a second time. This time, he went down, and unmoving.

Andreth finally remembered his training, and letting out a piercing cry to focus himself, lets fly with a fist - this time he connected, and dealt the thug a hard blow to the chest. As the thug staggered backwards, Yuri made a fencer's lunge with his rapier and shoved it through the bandit's chest, skewering him. "Bastard!" he hissed, and yanked out his rapier, letting the bandit fall to the ground.

---

  
As the bandit fell, Mirra was running up to Tilara, meowing anxiously. _Moving light!_

Tilara blinked, her eyes dazzled by her own fire spells, as Mirra gave her the alarm. "Gentlemen, we'd best be gone. We've made a bit too much noise. Pick up Starguard, please, and let's move."

"We don't have much time..." Yuri whispered, "They're coming to investigate. We have only seconds. How is he?"

Starguard shuddered, as Andreth tightened a quick bandage around the horrible wound. The blood was staunched, but his face was weak and pale. Andreth watched anxiously as his breathing slows...then stops.

---

  
For moments, there was nothing, no pulse, no movement. With a cry, Tilara pounds on Starguard's chest, forcing the air out in a death rattle, but somehow, his chest rose again, and in his wrist, ever so slight, blood continued to course.

"There's three people coming from the farmhouse. We don't have long before they discover the bodies, maybe just a few minutes," Yuri murmured. "Can we wrap up Starguard and get out of here? Is it safe to move him?"

"I don't know how safe it is, but it's not safe to stay, either. Back to our little cave for now, I think," said Tilara. "I've got one last fireburst in me, and then I'm tapped out."

Andreth breathed a sigh of relief. "Thank the gods, yes, we can move him. Let's go."

"Right. Let's get out of here," Yuri helped to get the old healer on Andreth's strong back. "Maybe back to town. He needs more help than we can give." Andreth nodded shortly, and carefully lifted Starguard up, joining in the march back to relative safety, while Yuri trailed obscuring the party's trail as best he could.

---

  
Tilara led the way back to the caves, with a little help from Mirra. It was still the same as it was when they had left it, less than two hours ago. The firewood is still stacked, and no wolves had decided to den here. Andreth carefully lowered Starguard down to the same spot where he lay before, while Yuri tried to erase all trace of the party's passing before entering the cave to sit staring, glumly, at Starguard.

Tilara sighed. "That was a bust. That's where they are, though, all right. It won't help Jane, though... the mayor won't send the militia on our word. We've got to get some of the stuff back. Can we carry him all the way back to town?"

"We can try tomorrow," Yuri said. "If we can make it to the road we might be able to flag down a cart or something. I think that under the circumstances, maybe we should go after clues in the Middens. This farm is proving to be the death of us. Besides, some of the weapons may be hidden with Big Joe himself."

Tilara nodded. "Might be worth a look. But I'm not sure it'll be any safer. Maybe we could get that little urchin to scout for us again?"

Yuri shrugged, waving off talk of the days to come for now. "I'll take first watch, I don't think I can sleep anyway. And the rest of you really need it."

---

  
The night passed uneventfully, barred only by the occasional whispered groan from Brother Starguard. A few times voices were heard, but always distant. The morning dew evaporated slowly under the faltering rays of Brother Sun's chariot, as clouds impeded his path across the heavens. But no rain. Not yet.

Yuri hmmed. "Shall we improvise a litter for Starguard?"

"Safest way to do it, I think," Tilara agreed.

Rummaging around in his pack, Yuri found some cord, lashing together a litter out of some of the firewood. After Starguard was gently placed on the rough litter, Andreth and Tilara lifted him up, setting off down the path, with Yuri and Mirra both scouting ahead.

---

  
Only once did they have to motion the party to a stop, thugs coming so close that Yuri could hear them. "Scumbags, come to muscle in on our territory," one man muttered to the other. "We'll post more guards tonight." The two men passed by, however, Yuri remaining unnoticed, crouching under a bush. "Now what was **that** all about?" Yuri pondered.

A few minutes later the main road was reached, Tilara and Andreth setting Starguard down for a rest. Andreth quirked an eyebrow as Yuri related the tale of the conversation he overheard, but said nothing.

---

  
The party set off down the long road home. Yuri, still, was in the lead, but not by near as much. Now the hope was to snag a ride, rather than to avoid everyone. Alas, not a soul passed - excepting one old man on a donkey, and he gave the party one look before kicking the donkey into a gallop. Late afternoon placed them back on the outskirts of town.

"I'll go get us a room at the inn," Yuri told the other two as he dropped back to talk. "I don't really want to go home right now and we REALLY need a decent place to sleep."

Tilara nodded. "Meet us at Father Pesci's, then."

"Sure, I'll get the room at the Mother's Oak, I think. it's right next to the temple anyway." Yuri said, then reconsidered. "Wait a minute, that's the wrong temple. Hmm... I'll get a room over at Old Ma Bethie's, and meet you at the temple. It's nothing special but at least the beds are clean."

Yuri split off as the group enters the town, and Tilara and Andreth finished carrying the litter to Father Pesci's small temple. Several passersby gave the trio some very nervous looks, expected, considering the blood still staining their clothing and the obviously poor condition of Starguard.

Father Pesci tut-tutted, as the litter entered his little temple. Looking at the badly wounded Starguard, he glared at Andreth and Tilara. "Is this any way to treat ... hmmm, put him down over there. No, on the table. And let me see what ... oh hell." With that he placed one hand on Starguard's stomach, tracing the wound. A blue light began to glow.

"We found the thieves," Tilara reported. "We didn't get away unscathed, I'm afraid, Father."

Father Pesci shushed Tilara. "Not yet, girl. See if this helps, first."

Starguard groaned as the healing power floods through him, and stirred. After a moment, his eyes fluttered open to look at the ceiling. "I'm getting too old for this," he muttered. "Where are we?"

Father Pesci leaned over Starguard. "Look at the ceiling, boy. Don't look at me; let's see now ... Eyes good. Turn your head? Yes, and the other way. And now, let me take this hammer and tap your knees ... Yes, excellent reflexes. Right. Now, miss, you were going to tell me how this young fool got himself ... ah, you're bleeding too?"

"Eh?" Tilara asked, confused, until she noticed the Father looking at her back. "Oh, that. No, that's old blood, just a scratch. Andreth got sliced up a bit worse than I did."

Starguard groaned, and rolled over. "Right. I'm just going to lay here and whimper a little if you don't mind."

Father Pesci turned to look at Andreth. "Wounded, hmm? Well, boy, come here. I can't examine you across the room. And if you're going to whimper, Starguard, please do so quietly. Upsetting patients is rude."

Starguard winced as he held back a laugh. "Yes, sir..." he said. However, he did whimper quietly.

Andreth nodded, walking over to Pesci to wordlessly show the rather nasty gash he'd taken as Tilara chuckled at the exchange between teacher and student. "We found out where the thieves went, Father. We didn't have much luck sneaking in and out, though. We got two of them, and their dogs, but we had to leave a bit more quickly than we'd arrived." She sighed, serious again. "We nearly lost him. Will he be all right?"

Father Pesci shook his head, tut-tutting sorrowfully. "You've been awfully careless with your ribs, lad. Let me see ... I'll have to stitch it up. Although ... well, in for a penny, in for a pound. Hop on the examining table, Andreth. Miss, can you help Starguard to the pallet over there?"

Tilara nodded, and took that as a yes to her question. She offered Starguard a shoulder. "C'mon, then. Let's give Andreth his turn." Starguard staggered over, the magic having a rapid effect, his near deadly wound almost completely healed.

Father Pesci slowly traced the gash on Andreth's ribs with his fingers. As a blue light shone into the wound, the edges slowly knit themselves back together. As he reached the end, he tapped down once, lightly, and dusted off his hands carefully. "Right, Andreth. Good as new. And remember, the Stars bless those who offer thanks."

Andreth swung his legs off the table and bowed deeply, grinning lopsidely. "Though maybe not so many as Brother Starguard."

Starguard nodded. "I suspect I owe you several days of service, Father..."

Father Pesci waved a finger at Brother Starguard. "Pfaugh. If the Stars don't heal the healers, who would? But belike, an offering, when next you have some time or money, would not harm at all, younglings. Now, miss, you were saying?"

"Heh. You're independent now, Starguard," Tilara put in. "We're supposed to support them financially." She dug into her pouch and pulls out some coins. "What's reasonable, Father?"

"A reasonable gift, miss? Well, for a healing such as Andreth's we usually ask a few silvers. Mayhaps a gold." Father Pesci smiled, waving around the small temple. "We're not Muirwen's followers, after all."

Tilara counted out five silvers. "More when we get finished and get paid, then. Thank you, Father."

Father Pesci smiled, accepting the coins. "Bless you, miss. We'll put this money to good use; the herbs are low again. And now that the young swot doesn't do the shopping any more, prices have gone up."

---

  
Yuri wandered in, looking around cautiously. "How is everyone?" Seeing Starguard conscious, Yuri looked visibly relieved.

Starguard groaned. "I thought the Stars were going to take me...I saw them, and then they told me it wasn't time yet." He looks over at Pesci, with a bit of theatrical exasperation. "And they called me a 'young swot'. I blame you."

Andreth hooted with laughter, leaning against the wall. Tilara joining in. "A young swot, is it? I'll keep that in mind... After all, who am I, mere mortal that I am, to argue with the Stargods?"

Starguard groaned. "I should stayed unconscious," he complained. "I feel about as old as the Gods at the moment... Let me at least get the herbs for you, Father. I've got connections, there."

Yuri stifled a chuckle. "Oh, Brother, you're only as young as you feel. By the way, I got us two rooms at the boarding house. I figured it might be nice to have somewhere to sleep tonight besides a cave."

Father Pesci, too, smothered a wide smile. "So, how goes your first job? Found the miscreants yet?"

"Oh, yeah, we found them all right," Yuri said. "We found them and then they did their best to carve us into dog biscuits."

Father Pesci looked perplexed. "Dog biscuits? But you don't us **human** remains for those ..."

"Tell the dogs that," Starguard rejoined rubbing his hand in memory. Yuri nodded empathetically, holding up the shredded sleeve on his shirt. "If it weren't for Starguard, they would have chewed my arm to a bloody stump."

"And I suspect if it weren't for you lot, I'd be lying on the ground dead of a sword wound," Starguard admitted. "Next time, hit them, \_then\_ ask for surrender."

Tilara snorted. "You're the one who asked for a surrender, Starguard. Don't blame me, I turned mine into bandit flambe."

Starguard nodded. "Just making a note to myself."

Father Pesci looked fascinated as he leaned up against the table. "Was that before or after he actually did anything to you, Miss?"

"That was after he'd stuck a knife in my back, actually..."

"That guy had absolutely no manners, or sense," Yuri complained. "He was outnumbered. If he'd surrendered we wouldn't have had to fight. His careless disregard for the odds shows that we're dealing with rank amateurs, and that makes them more dangerous."

"Maybe he thought he'd be okay till more of 'em showed up?" Andreth suggested.

"In that case, he could have surrendered and more of them would have shown up in less than a minute. There were at least three more in that farmhouse," Yuri noted, and sighed. "Anyway, what are we going to do next? We're no closer to recovering Jane's stolen arms. All we've proven is that some shady characters are out at that farm.

"And some in the barn," Tilara agreed. "Ah, well. What d'you think they meant with talking about someone muscling in on their territory?"

"Us?" Andreth put in, questioning.

"Hmmmm... maybe. Or is there someone already trying it and we got mistaken for some of them?" Tilara waved the thought away for a moment. "Anyway, we've got that set of arrows and the greatclub with Jane's mark on 'em, at least. Let's take 'em by her place and see if they're part of what got stolen."

Yuri nodded. "Good idea."
