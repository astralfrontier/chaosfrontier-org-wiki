Game Log: Chapter 7 - It Takes A Thief...


---------------------------------------------

_Brother Starguard is a tall man, strangely dressed in the brown work clothes of the acolyte cleric. The strange part is because he seems too old to be an student in the church. His thick, bushy, mustache and beard, once black, is now salt and pepper, the darkness interspersed with star-like flecks of white. His face is light and lively, blue eyes sparkling, though with a few hard wrinkles, a few laugh lines. His nose is a bit hawkish, giving him a bit of an intense look. His body seems in decent shape, if not particularly strong, but most of his form is hidden beneath the cloth of his clothes. He wears a midnight blue robe, short, with easy release clips so that he doesn't get caught by it in a fight. Depending on the situation, he may also wear his studded leather armor, but always has his morning star at his hip, in case of trouble. He walks more like a soldier than a priest...but the wooden symbol of the two stars entwined hung on the leather strap states otherwise._

_Tilara is a young woman both pretty and possessing that indefinable presence that transforms mere attractiveness into beauty. She has bright red-gold hair and laughing emerald eyes in a tanned face. Her graceful and athletic figure is partially hidden by the practical traveling clothes she wears, dark green tunic and brown leggings with black boots and a dark grey cloak. She carries a quarterstaff, and her tortoise-shell cat is usually either riding her shoulder or twining about her feet._

_Yuri is a young man of average height and wiry build, with sandy blonde hair and an easy, fluid demeanor. He has a ready smile and a glimmer in his eye. He is dressed in a leather jerkin, light wool trousers, soft boots, and a fine wool cloak, all in subdued grey tones. The hilt of a rapier is visible at his belt; otherwise, he seems rather lightly equipped._

Early this morning, Andreth, with one fierce flurry of blows, completely knocked out Big Joe. But goodhearted as the party was; they couldn't strike that final blow, and instead dragged into the Frothing Hogshead for a little booze and songs. Or at least discussions. The upshot of which involved the party being recruited en masse for Big Joe's gang.

Within a few minutes the party had gained entrance tho the Goat Warehouse, where Big Joe had pointed out their beds, and then gone to snore off his hangover/bruises/general unhappiness.

Starguard rests quietly. He's tired, the injuries he took, while healed, having caught up to him.

Big Joe is soon snoring loudly and happily, and there's no one else here. Smiling, Yuri wanders over to the largest barrels, climbing up to the top one and slowly working the lid loose. The barrel contains large quantities of randomly stuffed straw. A quick grope reveals nothing further. Shrugging he checks the smaller barrels, and finds more straw. And a few daggers.

Tilara stays near Joe's pallet - if Yuri does manage to wake him up, she'll distract him by whatever means necessary.

A few very sharp daggers. _Ouch._ Top notch work. Looks like Jane's work.

Yuri winces, and pulls on a pair of gloves.

Yuri hmms at the daggers, and then resumes looking around. The rags are just that, old rags piled up. Once upon a time they might have been clothes. The two casks are much more interesting; they're definitely full, and filled with some kind of liquid. Funny, alcohol doesn't usually smell this oily. And doesn't it usually slosh a little more loudly?

Yuri sniffs at the barrels and smells... lamp oil? Hmm.

Turning aside, Yuri wanders over to examine the crates. Straw. More straw. Tons of straw. But straw doesn't usually smell this bad. Digging a little deeper, he finds a leather vest. And another. And a third, with studs on. Upstairs, the snoring ceases.

Yuri quickly replaces the lid on the crate and sneaks back upstairs.

Big Joe slowly, ponderously, turns over on to his side. He mutters something about the honey and the bumblebee, and his hand pulls languidly at the blanket.

Tilara looks up, then grins as Joe turns over. _Just stay sleeping, boyo, and there won't be any problems._

Yuri returns to Tilara's side, draws her away from Joe, and quickly describes what he's found.

Yuri murmurs, "Those casks have lamp oil. The small barrels have daggers in them, the larger crates have leather armor. And really smelly straw. I didn't have time to check the maker's marks on the armor."

Yuri murmurs, "We should get word to Jane. Maybe after we go tomorrow, she can send some people over to pick it all up."

Tilara nods. "Wouldn't be Jane's, anyway. She isn't missing any armor. We're on the right track... but most of the stuff isn't here, it looks like. We'll have to go through with the whole charade... but you're right about that. I'll send Mirra with a message.

Yuri grins, and murmurs, "Also, ask her if she'd be willing to pay a finder's fee for Gerrold's armor."

Tilara snickers. "Why not?"

Yuri murmurs, "Have her go to the northeast door so I can let her in, I want to have a look in that small room anyway."

Andreth has been silently meditating on one of the beds through all this. Perhaps not the most dumb-thug-like pose, but no one's watching right now.

Yuri tries the inside door to the small room, and finds it's locked. Having no means of opening it, he opens the east window for Mirra.

Mirra jumps lightly through the window, butts her head against Yuri's shins once, and then heads upstairs to greet Tilara. She manages to convey a look of utter abandonment without uttering a sound.

Yuri sees the look of pathos on Mirra's face, and carries her upstairs, scratching the cat's head behind the ears.

Mirra purrs quietly, leaning into the scritches ...

Tilara retreats from Joe's pallet once Yuri is done investigating downstairs and scribbles a quick note. "Some gear - yours and your dad's - at The Goat. Investigating to find out where the rest of it is. Tomorrow we're heading out of town as recruits. Hope we don't find Kiel too quickly." She takes her poor abused kitty and cuddles her for a little while, then attaches the note to her collar. _Take this to Jane, then come back, okay?_

Mirra looks into Tilara's eyes while the note is being tied on; then she daintily runs back down the stairs and disappears out the window.

Yuri quietly searches for a key to that door. door

Yuri looks carefully for a key to the door, but there doesn't seem to be one. As he carefully meanders around, he wanders close by the wall and hears the sound of a hand slapping a surface in ... well, it sounds mostly like frustration.

Yuri's eyes widen, and he quickly sneaks back to tell the others, especially Tilara. "I think there's someone locked up downstairs. Might be that kid."

Yuri murmurs, "You know, Big Joe's rumored firebrand."

Tilara says, "Hmm. You sure it's someone locked up, not someone hiding?"

Yuri murmurs, "I can't get the lock open. Anyone else have a bright idea or three?

Yuri murmurs, "If he was hiding, he wouldn't have been pounding on the walls."

Tilara says, "Hmm. A good point."

Yuri says, "Anyway, how can we get in there? Andr... err... Brother? Other Brother?""

Andreth says, "Call me Tom." He shakes his head. "I can't get in there without waking up Joe."

Tilara says, "Well... we could always wake Joe up and ask him..."

Andreth stares at Tilara.

Tilara rolls her eyes. "I'm not serious."

Yuri says, "It could work. I'd rather not, though."

Yuri wanders over and checks the floor of the loft, over the place where the room would be, looking for chinks, cracks, loose boards, etc.

Tilara says, "I doubt it's the fire-user, anyway. If they were holding him prisoner, he'd just burn his way out."

Andreth rubs his chin, making a rasping sound. "Didja try to talk to the guy down there?"

Yuri shakes his head. "I recall there's a skylight over that area. I could try to climb in through it.

Yuri says, "I didn't want to talk to him without asking everyone else first."

Tilara says, "If you're going to try going in through a skylight, let me put the spell on you first. We don't need you falling off the roof again."

Yuri grimaces. "Umm... let's do what Andreth suggests and try to talk to him first."

Yuri sneaks back downstairs to the door, puts his face near the frame, and murmurs, "Hello, is there anyone in there?"

There is a moment of silence. Then something is dropped on the floor. "Dammit! I **hate** these little tests! Gah! What! Can't you see I'm busy! Go burn down a warehouse or something!"

Yuri murmurs, "No, I can't see you're busy, there's a door in the way. Who are you?"

"Oh blast! Did it fall ... Hang on, lemme get the key." There's the sound of rustling, and something being kicked against a wall, and then a key turns in the lock. The door begins to open. "Hang on, who in hell are ... Joe! Joe!" His voice rises to a crescendo, waking up Big Joe. Big Joe jumps off the bed and glares at everyone. "Who? What? Huh?"

Yuri scowls. "I WORK for Big Joe, you fool."

Starguard blinks, waking up. "Who? Wha?"

Behind the door, the young man is dressed in tunic, and trews. There are ink spots on his hands, and his bright red hair is poking out in all directions. He glares at Yuri. "Then you know I'm not to be disturbed when I'm studying. And why haven't I seen you before?" The kid looks at Yuri. "Feh! Your hands are too nice. Joe! We've got intruders!"

Behind the young man, Yuri can see into a room that contains large piles of candles, and a brazier kicked sideways and badly dented ni multiple places. There's a table, too, and a few loose sheets of paper on it.

Yuri scowls some more. "These hands are made for strangling, kid. Don't test my patience. Big Joe didn't mention you, and I don't know who the hell YOU are. And there's more of me than there are of you."

Starguard growls. "What the hell is all the hubbub!? I'm trying to get some sleep hear!

Yuri scowls some more. "These hands are made for strangling, kid. Don't test my patience. Big Joe didn't mention you, and I don't know who the hell YOU are. And there's more of me than there are of you."

Behind the young man, Yuri can see into a room that contains large piles of candles, and a brazier kicked sideways and badly dented ni multiple places. There's a table, too, and a few loose sheets of paper on it.

Tilara says, "Sounds like you forgot to introduce us to someone, Joe. He's making an awful racket."

Joe sits up, and smiles at Tilara. "Ah, bumble bee; wanna taste some pollen? Just let Stormy rant; he'll get over it. And meanwhile ...

Starguard blinks, coming upright. "Wazzat? Hey! Hold it down!"

The kid raises both hands, palm out. "Nobody threatens me! Get it? Nobody! Joe! Get these creeps away from me! Joe!" The kid pushes up against Yuri, trying to get him to back up.

Tilara grins at the bandit leader. "He's going to attract attention, Joe. Better introduce us."

Andreth grunts, getting to his feet. "You want I should get 'em to settle down, boss?"

Joe shrugs. "Sure; you're the new weaponsmaster. Say; what's yer name, anyways?"

Andreth says, "Tom."

Yuri nudges the kid back. "Fine, be that way. You're not going to make any friends by shouting at everyone ESPECIALLY when milady is trying to sleep."

Joe nods. "Right, Tom. Just go settle this down. Don't worry about Stormy; he knows better'n to burn down the warehouse."

Andreth tramps down the stairs. "Okay, okay, what's all da fuss?"

Starguard grumbles a little under his breath. "Right." Heading over to the balcony, he yells down. "Couldya keep it down to a dull roar? Some of us are trying to sleep!"

The kid's eyes begin to glow with a reddish light and his palms begin to shimmer. They feel hot on Yuri's shoulders. "You ... you ... you ... oaf! And what's this about a lady?"

Tilara follows Andreth - or Tom, now - down the stairs. "That'd be me, I think. What's all the shouting about?"

Andreth looks back and forth between the two. "Oi, oi, cool down, let's not you two fight..."

The kid stomps forward, following Yuri, and pushing him on the shoulder again. "Where's this .... ooooh. that ain't no lady; that's my bumble bee; come to taste my pollen! Hey honey ... wanna make some beautiful flowers together?" He hoots at the descending Tilara.

Big Joe waits a few more moments, sees that everything is under sufficient amounts of control, and goes back to bed.

Yuri says to Tilara, "I looked over the doors and windows. It's safe enough. This one (motioning to Stormy) was in the locked room."

Starguard comes down the stairs, glowering.

There's a scritching at the window, and Mirra jumps back in, sans note. _Jane; fish; tasty_ she sends at Tilara, before ducking behind her.

Tilara smiles as her familiar returns. _She's a nice lady. Stay out of sight while the others are awake, okay?_

Mirra meows once, quietly, and then hides behind a cask.

Starguard steps down into the middle of things. "Now lad, that's no way to talk to a lady."

The kid looks Starguard up and down. "You must be a customer; you're too old to be one of ours." The kid might be young, but he's got sneering and innuendo down to a fine science.

Yuri looks from Tilara to Stormy and back. "You want this kid to be a 'customer' or a nuisance, Milady?"

Tilara chuckles at the kid. "Now, now. Never can tell how useful someone is by looking at them for a few seconds. Anyway, he's part of the package with the rest of us."

Starguard gently taps the kid in the back of the head. "Show respect to your elders son. They've lived longer.

Andreth tries to step in to prevent Starguard's action... a fraction of a second too late.

The kid whirls around. "Nobody hits me! And no tart's customer is gonna ... " His eyes begin to glow an unworldly red, and his palms visibly heat up as he spreads his fingers. A sheet of flames spreads out from his finger tips.

Andreth flinches back from the sheet of flame, managing to pull back far enough to only be caught by the fringes. "Yeouch!" he yells, patting out the flames in his clothes.

Yuri has seen this happen before and the results aren't pretty. He dives to the side and tries to body-check Tilara out of the line-of-fire.

Starguard curses, and bats at his clothes. "Damn kid! You'll burn the warehouse down!" he cries, as he tries to put himself out.

The kid just smiles, and turns back to Tilara, completely ignoring the people whose clothes are aflame. "So, my little humming bird, would you like to come see my ... etchings?"

Yuri looks around to see if anything else is on fire, especially the casks, and if not, will try and beat the flames out on Starguard with his gloved hands.

Tilara dodges Yuri's well-meaning but unnecessary body-check and chuckles at the young sorcerer. "Maybe... You've got etchings in there?" She distracts the kid while the others extinguish themselves and anything else that's started burning.

Yuri, under his breath, swears a blue streak in Lurinese.

Starguard glares at the kid. "Brat. You keep doing things like that and someone will see how well you cast with two broken hands."

The kid nods, happily. "Yeah; I got this really cool one of this mage, see, and he's completely enveloped in flames." The kid looks wistful. "I wish I could do that. But come look! And I have a nice soft bed, too! Big Joe gave me a **down** mattress!"

Andreth growls, smoldering, but keeps his temper. "Okay, okay, dat's enough. All right, guys, we stop buggin' da kid, right?" he says, turning to his other male companions. He'll let Tilara work out on her own how she wants to handle him.

Yuri gives Starguard a Meaningful Look. "This is not the time for that."

The kid tugs on Tilara's hand. "Come look! I even have pillows! Two of them. You could borrow on of them if we ..." The kid stops, and begins to blush. And stutter. "Anyw-ways, who are you?"

Tilara smiles at the boy. "Keep practicing, and someday maybe you'll be able to." She suppresses an impish grin at his sudden embarrassment and lets him show her his room. "I'm Laura."

Andreth says, "I'm da new weaponsmaster. My name's Tom."

Yuri makes to help Starguard back up the stairs towards the loft, asking, "How badly are you hurt?"

The kid waves off Tom. "Right. Weapons. Ick. Big Joe will deal with you. Hi Laura, come on in." The room isn't big, but it contains a bed - with two pillows as promised - and a pile of papers stacked in a corner. A large etching is inexpertly tacked somewhat crooked on to the ceiling over the bed. The room also contains a table, and two chairs.

"I'm a little singed is all. The kid isn't that powerful, but thinks he is. If it wasn't me, he'd be dead by now," mutters Starguard.

Yuri mutters, "We're sitting in a tinderbox, old man. Try to remember that until we're on the road tomorrow."

The kid smiles up at Laura. "Wanna see me make fire?"

Tilara says, "Tom's our weapons expert, and Leo's not bad... the older fellow is Steven, and when he's not being pompous, he's quite clever. And there's a difference between being able to get back at folks who've hurt you and being rude to everyone who might have..." She grins at the request. "I think I just did. You don't have to prove it again."

"I didn't think he'd fire off. My father cuffed me like that all the time until I learned respect," said Starguard.

The kid looks downfallen. "And you're leaving for the farm tomorrow? Nobody ever stays here with me ..."

Andreth grunts, and sits on his bed, calmly studying the burns on his arm.

Yuri sighs. "I know, but this kid's fallen in with some hard men. He doesn't have any self-control and he's got a lot to prove. Perhaps Milady will be able to unwire him a bit."

Starguard sighs, and though he hasn't prayed yet, has a few spells left. He cure minors Andreth and Yuri both, leaving himself singed.

Tilara asks, "Lonely, huh?"

Yuri says, "It would be good to rest now, Steven. We've got some walking to do tomorrow, I gather. I'll keep an eye on Milady, as always."

The kid nods once, then looks up. "I could come with you! I'm almost done with my studies, and Ferg promised he'd show me more .... And I haven't burnt anything down all week!"

Yuri looks over at Big Joe to determine how wakeful he is.

Starguard sighs, and falls down onto the bed. "Kids these days," he grumps, settling down on the hard pallet.

Big Joe is back to snoring happily and loudly, one hand patting down his blanket.

Tilara says, "Ferg's a mage? Joe didn't tell us that. Cool... mages are usually pretty clever folks, too. Nice to have someone smart in charge."

Andreth relaxes a little as the pain subsides. As he lies down to sleep, he's careful not to lie too heavily on the singed arm, but other than that he's feeling a lot better.

Yuri goes off looking for Mirra, to see if she's got a return note.

Mirra is still hiding behind the casket, and avoid Yuri. But as she retreats he can see there's no note in the collar.

The kid shakes his head. "Ferg's not a mage, but he's ... he's really ... ummm ... well, he knows a lot. And the old man was right, we should take a nap if we're going to leave tomorrow; Big Joe likes to get up at dawn." He sidles over to the door and closes it. "Here; you can have the wall.

Yuri nods to Mirra, and withdraws to a bunk to take a nap.

Tilara smiles at the boy, and gives him a gentle kiss on the forehead. "I don't think Big Joe would be too awfully happy if he woke up and found us together. And he certainly wouldn't be inclined to let you come along. I'd better stay with my friends for now, and maybe later we can spend some time together at the farm."

The kid sighs. "I ... see. Well, I should get some studying in." he opens the door again, to let Tilara (Laura?) out.

Big Joe sleeps and snores all afternoon, and all night too. And the night passes uneventfully; nobody goes in, nobody goes out, nothing catches fire. In the morning, just before dawn, Big Joe sits up. "Wake up, lads! We've got a walk ahead of us!" He seems a lot more cheerful now.

Yuri crawls off the pallet, the scowl on his face only partially faked.

Starguard yawns, his communion with the stars done. Stretching, he de-cricks his back.

Tilara grumbles. "Too early... " but sits up anyway. She makes a point of stretching while Joe is looking her way.

Yuri walks to Tilara and asks, "Did you sleep well, Milady?", then softer, he murmurs, "Maybe we should ask Joe to bring Stormy with us. He'd be a nasty surprise to anyone who crosses his path... here or on the road."

Andreth grunts and stretches, sitting up, and not making any comment in particular.

Joe looks on appreciatively as Tilara stretches. "So, Laurababe, come keep me warm while we nap a little longer? Ferg isn't keen on sharing, so ..."

Starguard quietly chants, causing the last his burns to disappear, and he feels almost as good as new.

Guest1 \[Tilara\] grins at Joe. "I thought you wanted to get an early start?"

Joe smirks. "They won't mind the nap, and you and I can get up together ..."

Starguard calls out from his bed. "Hey! That's right! I took a sword in the gut and I never got paid for it! Old debts first, dear."

Joe pats the bed beside him. "Come on, my little buzzing bee. Come buzz for me ... "

Below, you hear the first stumblings, as Stormy opens up his door and emerges. "Joe! Cna I come this time? Please?"

Yuri makes an audible snort when he hears Stormy's voice. "That brat..."

Tilara takes advantage of the distraction afforded by the kid to wander away from the beds. "He's an interesting kid, Joe, if a bit hot-headed. Why not bring him along?"

Joe looks up, and sighs audibly. "Damn. Fine. Sure. But tonight we meet in the weapons hall, babe. Just you, and me." He sits up, pulling on a leather vest and strapping his club on to his belt. "Stormy! You've got a friend. Come kiss her in thanks, and let's get this show on the road."

Starguard is up, and ready already, grumbling. "I'm beginning to think most of the Gods hate me. Since leaving the temple I've been eaten by dogs, stabbed twice, and now burnt. I'm too damn old for this."

Yuri says, "Stay behind me, Steven. I keeps the Lady's customers honest. I also keeps her customers alive."

Starguard says, "I should follow Tom"

Starguard says, "...'s lead more often. The kid's got better instincts that I have."

Yuri murmurs to Starguard, "That baggie we found, keep it ready. We're heading for the deep end here."

The group slowly gathers, and exits the warehouse carefully. The streets, just barely post-dawn, are deserted, and Big Joe whistles tunelessly. Nobody questions you as you leave on the main road, and everybody you encounter shows a definite tendency to stay out of you way. In later afternoon, you reach the same farmhouse you had visited so recently.

Big Joe pauses at the edge of the field in which the farmhouse sits, and gives the call of a spotted owl, three times, before barking once. Then he walks to the kitchen door, herding everyone inside. In the kitchen, one man is stirring the cauldron on the hearth. "Ash! We've got some new recruits. Settle them in. I'm gonna take Stormy to see Ferg."

Ash shambles around a corner, looking for all the world like a man who just woke up. "Recruits, huh?" he mumbles, rubbing the back of his head.

Starguard tries to look like scum. With his experiences the last few days, it's not much of a stretch.

_A tall man with obvious muscles and unspecified source of income. He looks like a farmer's son, but carries himself with an unsteady grace and dignity befitting that of an aristocrat (or the son of one). Deep brown eyes stare out of a weather-beaten face and are accompanied by a hook nose, widely smiling mouth and dusky, unruly hair._

Stormy and Joe disappear through the other door, and you can hear Stormy nattering on excitedly about something or other.

Ash shrugs and gestures haphazardly down a hallway. "All right, you mob. Follow me." He ambles down a hall opposite the entrance to the kitchen, gesturing to the left and right. "Rooms." Around the corner to the left, another door. "Commons." At the end of the hall. "Practice room."

Yuri says, "Where's everyone else? I thought Milady had signed on with a major outfit here."

Tilara looks over Ash, at least simulating the practiced eye of a slattern. "So, who's this Ferg we keep hearing about?"

Ash brightens up. "The outfit is out, uh, out fitting. We do all sorts of things here: scout out new caravans ripe for the picking, waylay travellers in forests - all right, less of that these days - and intercept news of rich visitors to the region. Lots of those." He beckons, walking into the weapons hall. "Come on, you can learn more about Ferg in here."

The Weaponshall, a large rectangular area, contains several well-stocked weaponracks. Right now there are three pairs of fighters practicing in the center, bashing on one another with wooden short swords. There's a seventh man, circling the combatants ...

Tilara follows along. "Fair enough." She stops to watch the practice.

Yuri checks the faces of the fighters to see if there's any he recognizes.

None of the combatants look familiar, although one looks a smidgen badly bruised. The circling one singles him out for a little more one-on-one attention while his partner gladly gets out of the way. noticing Ash, he moves towards the door. "Hey! When's supper?"

Ash says, "It's coming, it's coming! Keep yer pants on."

Ash rambles into the kitchen to check on supper. ~\_~

Tilara winks. "Oh, like _that'd_ be any fun."

Starguard says, "Supper? What's being prepared? It's a long walk, and they mentioned I was going to help with the cooking."

The man approaches, and notices the newcomers. "Hey! Jonesie! Look what I found!"

The circler looks up, raps his opponent - disarming him in the process - and calls a halt to practice. "Hey, Kearney, whatcha found?" Kearney turns back. "Newfies, boss, came with Ash. Who says supper's nearly done. Good time for a break?"

Yuri realizes that he's damn hungry.

Starguard sniffs at the air. "Oh no! If I'm signing up, I'm at least eating well!

Starguard charges into the kitchen to 'help'. Take over, if he can.

The boss nods at Kearney. "Troops! Fall ... out!" The other men drop their swords gratefully, and slowly slink off to the racks to put them away, before disappearing into the commons.

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "Be good to get this lot drunk. Or something. Our job will be easier if they're loosened up.

Andreth glances around, taking in the surroundings, but does not speak until spoken to.

From the kitchen a screech of pain resounds, then loud and fluent cursing. Then: "Stew's JUST about ready!" A clattering of metal on stone. Another call. "How do you feel about soup, boss?"

Tilara nods. "That's for sure."

Starguard's army voice is heard at the door. "Out! You're burning it!" In a few moments, the smell of burning lessens...

The boss slowly faces Tilara, Andreth, and Yuri. "So; you're our new recruits are you? Lemme guess; the tart distracts the merchants while you ... beg a lot? Look pitiful? Well?"

Ash ambles out of the kitchen looking like the cat who swallowed the canary. "Well, that's off my shoulders now..." he mumbles half-aloud.

Tilara grins. "Something like that. I usually ended up _earning_ most of the money, though."

Yuri keeps the scowl on his face, and lets Tilara do the talking.

Andreth lets a smirk creep over his face.

Tilara says, "Figured it was time to try something else."

The smell from the kitchen slowly shifts from burnt to spiced...with a burnt after-smell.

The boss raises an eyebrow. "Indeed; so you're here to ... ah. You think you're diversifying. Well, mebbe you can keep me company after Ferg's through with you ..."

Tilara shrugs. "As long as he knows what he's doing. The boys are tough enough, but they don't do a lot of thinking, if you know what I mean."

Big Joe comes out of one fo the rooms. "Right, Jonesie, Stormy's here. Ferg knows and nobody died. These are the new recruits; Tom's gonna take over your job so you can go back to setting up your sets ... And Laura is for Ferg. I've got dibs when he's done."

Tilara pouts. "What, I don't get the weapons training, too?"

Jonesie looks at Big Joe. "So, she gets a knife, too? Won't Ferg worry about his jewels?"

Big Joe smiles toothily. "Nah; he's looking forward to Stormy's education. So which beds'd you give them, Ash?"

Tilara grins. "Oh, I don't need to take it in to see the boss. Just so I can use it if the recruits get fresh."

Starguard clangs a few times on the pot, signifying that the soup is edible. And he found buns somewhere.

Ash looks surprised. "Beds? Uh... I hadn't thought about that.. just yet. Let me look...." Off he goes into the common area.

Yuri says, "So... what's the rules here? Who gives the orders?"

Big Joe shrugs. "Ask Tom; if she hasn't stiffed him yet, mebbe he'll teach her. Anyways, I hear the melodious tones of our new cook. Wan to see if he's any good? If he fails, ... shall we say ... the gauntlet?" Jonesie smiles. "Yeah."

Big Joe and Jonesie head off towards the kitchen. Once there, they grab bowls, buns, and let 'Steven' serve them some stew. Jonesie takes a careful taste, just as a slender man dressed all in black walks in. "Ferg! We've found uis a cook; let's not spit him yet."

Starguard ladles out soup as people come for it, and giving a bun. "I think I saved it...."

Ash chimes in, "Right! Keep the alternate cook alive, I say!"

Starguard says, "Alternate? You talking about yourself, boy? You don't know how to use herbs and spices to save yourself."

Ferg takes a bowl and bun, and sits down on the only chair. Jonesie and Big Joe take the two stools. Ferg takes a cautious sip, and smiles slowly. "He'll do ... he'll do ... we'll keep him. Does he do tarts?"

Ash says, "Thought you did most of the tarts, Ferg." and runs."

Ferg is dressed in black from top to bottom, and has the black hair and pale skin to pull it off. A sword hangs loosely at his waist, and a dagger was in the sheath of his arm, but now it got thrown at Ash.

Ash takes the blade in the calf, just next to the seam of his leggings. Quietly cursing, he limps over to a stool to sit down and start bandaging it.

The dagger catches Ash in the calf, where it sticks for a moment before falling out. Ferg looks at Tom. "Fetch that, will you. And ash ... " Ferg's voice gains a little in volume " ... please learn that remarks like that are best left to your betters."

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "Well, at least he's your type."

Andreth retrieves the blade and returns it to Ferg. Hilt-first, of course.

Ash points at Ferg, addressing the new group. "And that's what you need to know about Ferg," he says, voice slightly strained. "He's in charge."

Starguard says, "Give me the supplies and some time to get some herbs, and I can make most simple honest food. It'll feed you, and taste good. You want a wedding cake, however, you'll need someone else."

Slowly the men wander in, collect bowls, and wander out again. Jonesie looks pointedly at the party. "The men tend to eat in the common room. Where would you like the tart, Ferg?"

Ferg looks at Starguard - or Steven rather - thoughtfully. "We could make him part of the recruiting drive; the food in your Middens is ... inedible."

Starguard begins working on the dishes even before dinner's completely served. He works quietly, generally arranging things in the kitchen to his liking.

Andreth snorts at that, and gives a lopsided grin.

Big Joe stands up, and collects Tilara, dropping her in his lap. "Would you like a little bun, honey?"

Tilara eeks. "Oh, you. Not during dinner."

Big Joe smiles sheepishly, and feeds her a piece of bun, dipped in stew. "Here; eat up. You mustn't let your energies flag. Ferg promised we could share."

Andreth eyes Big Joe for a moment, but heads for the common room without causing any further trouble. For now, at least.

Jonesie looks up after demolishing his first bowl. "Shall I take this ... Tom ... through his paces tonight? Or tomorrow?"

Tilara glances at Ferg, to see his reaction to Joe's comment.

Ferg smiles, whimsically. "I'm not so fond of tarts, Joe. I prefer them ... less experienced. And less willing."

Jonesie looks at Tom. "So; would you prefer the morning, or would tonight suit you just fine?"

Yuri carefully studies Tilara's face for a hint of guidance as to whether he should leave her alone with these... people.

Andreth shrugs. "I ain't in no hurry."

Jonesie nods. "See you tomorrow then. Tell Ash he's got the graveyard shift.

With that Jonesie finishes his bowl, and disappears into one of the rooms, the door firmly shut behind him.

Tilara winks at Ferg and settles in for dinner with Joe. "Suit yourself." She nods ever so slightly to Yuri.

Starguard says, "Right! Who's annoyed the leaders of late? I need someone to dry."

Yuri nods just-as-slightly back at Tilara and heads for the commons room. He carefully keeps the smell of fear out of his pores until he's out of Ferg's line of sight.

Andreth grunts. "Right." He follows Yuri, now.

Ferg looks at Tilara. Then he takes a second look. Then he smiles at the new cook. "Take the tart; Joe won't mind. She'll be all nice and clean by the time he's ready for her. And Joe? You may borrow Stormy's pillow." Joe smiles, and leaves his empty plate on the table before disappearing.

In the common room, the remaining thugs are slowly emptying their bowls and comparing bruises. One looks up as Andreth walks in. "Hey! You know anything about healing? Jonesie whacked me so hard I've got no feeling in my hand ..."

Andreth grunts. "Dunno much, meself, but I'll have a look." He goes over to examine the injured party.

The man looks at Ash's bandaged calf. "Ferg's feeling nice tonight. Sigh. Which shift did he give you this time?"

Ash says, "Night, I believe."

The man grimaces as he gets probed, then grins. "Only one shift, huh. Guess I'll take first patrol alone then. And thanks, ... say, what is your name?"

Yuri looks around the common room and sizes up who's in it.

Andreth, examining the arm, happens by sheer luck to recognize the problem as being similar to an injury Brother Oak once gave him in training. He tries the little twist Brother Oak used to fix him up. "Any better?"

Ash clutches his head and roars, "SHUT UP!" then abruptly jumps up (wincing in sudden recollection of discomfort) and staggers out.

Yuri . o O ( Let's see. Big Joe and Jonesie probably have their own rooms... Ferg certainly does... and they're the heavy hitters. The other six are in here; and then there's Ash, the dogsbody... )

Yuri says, "Hey, what's with him?"

Starguard sighs as he does the dishes, reminding himself of being a healer and helper in the army. "This is no wholly unfamiliar."

In the commons, Yuri sees 12 bunkbeds, two rows of three double beds, against opposing walls. There's chests by each pair of beds, and there's two large tables where everybody's wolfing down food. And there's tallow lights keeping the place lit. One of the fellows waves at the beds. "Pick ones that aren't in use. The chests don't lock. And ignore Ash. He's just ... moody."

Yuri says, "That looks like more than moody. Who's he talking to?""

Ferg finally stands up, after watching Tilara do dishes, and collects a last bowl of stew. He walks down the hall, going into his own room, where voices mutter for a moment before silence falls. These people don't seem to be big on social skills.

The man shrugs. "I'm Herb. Ash is probably in the weapons hall ranting at the powers that be. Thinks he's a better man than he is."

Yuri leaves the commons room and quietly follows Ash.

Meanwhile, the man with the numbed wrist smiles at Andreth. "Thank you again. I'd best be off, before Ferg sees me here. Or, "he shudders, "Big Joe. I'm Harry, by the way."

Ash is in the weapons hall, slamming his fist into the wall repeatedly and mumbling incoherently.

Yuri quietly walks up behind Ash, maybe six feet away and to one side, and watches for a moment.

Ash stops pounding and just stands quietly, breathing heavily. "What do you want?" he murmurs to the presence at his back.

Andreth nods curtly to Harry, then heads off to the weapons hall. Ash's storming rant out of the commons has piqued his curiosity.

Starguard turns to Tilara. "Do you think you can stave things off? We need a plan."

Yuri says, "Silver for your thoughts, old man?"

Yuri says, "I'm curious how you fell in with..." Yuri motions to take in the barn, the bandits, and so on."

Tilara murmurs, "I can try. At worst... it's nothing I haven't had to do before. I can handle it."

Ash spins suddenly, hands trembling at his sides as though ready to draw a weapon he isn't carrying. "Stolen silver isn't worth my thoughts, you gutter scum," he spits. "You and the rest of these THIEVES --" the word has an uncharacteristic note of spite, considering its origin "-- aren't worth... Nevermind. If I talk like this, something else will go wrong."

Yuri says quietly, so that only Ash and Andreth can hear, "Look me in the eye and tell me that we're common thieves."

Starguard looks at Tilara with a bit of surprise, and some worry. "You don't have to, you know. WE'll fight our way out if it comes to that."

Tilara says, "It might be easier all around to go along with things and gain their trust first. Right now we're under surveillance, make no mistake."

Andreth walks into the room just at "something else will go wrong." He hears Yuri's remark, and his eyes widen with astonishment. Deciding to follow his lead, he lets his gutter-thug posture slip, and walks over toward the pair with the graceful strides of his natural training.

Starguard nods. "Of course. You don't trust someone for a month, as a general rule. Unless they prove themselves."

Tilara nods. "Pity we don't have a month..."

Ash's eyes widen. "Alright then." He locks gazes. "If you're common thieves," he says slowly, trying his best to follow the vocal patterns he just heard used, "then I'm just the same as you." Breaking the gaze, he smirks. "And now I report you to Ferg." He begins making a move towards the hall.

Yuri says, "Tom?"

Starguard nods. "We'll think of something, Laura. Honestly, if we could get Ferg and Big Joe, I suspect this group would fall apart.

Andreth walks into Ash's path. "I don't think so."

Ash smirks. "How are you gonna stop me?" he demands.

Tilara nods. "The rest would squabble over who got to take over. The trick is getting them... they're both tough."

Starguard nods. "One, then the other. Big Joe's sure to get drunk, isn't he? I like odds where we badly outnumber the opponent.

Tilara grins. "I'm sure he'll be drinking, if there's anything around here to drink. Did you see anything?"

Yuri says softly, "We'd rather not have to. You don't belong with this bunch. Neither do we. We'd like to avoid bloodshed. Don't put us in a situation where we'll be forced to do otherwise."

Yuri says softly, "Tell me who you are and why you're here and I'll do the same. It's a game called the Truth."

Starguard says, "A little. I'm make sure we get a little more, as a favour."

Ash smiles and glances backwards. "Well, that's good. You passed. Any real member of this gang would have split me open for that." He shrugs. "The truth is that I'm here, I am what I am. I simply don't like it. And I want out. Nevermind why."

Yuri looks around carefully to see if anyone's eavesdropping, and motions at Andreth to watch the hall.

Andreth says quietly to Ash, "You remind me of where I would be, if I hadn't met Brother Oak." And with that, he takes up a position near the door, staying Hidden.

Ash glances around as well. "Alright then, what do you want? Why are you here?"

Yuri murmurs to Ash, "These bandits are behind several robberies in town. Most of us don't fit a tradesman's life, so we offered to get them back. It looks like we're in over our heads."

Yuri murmurs to Ash, "We're not trying to be heros, but it looks like unless we do something about Ferg, we're getting those weapons back over our own dead bodies. So we need to be more clever about this."

Yuri pauses to gauge Ash's reaction.

Ash breaks into a sudden, unnerving smile. "Alright. I'll talk to you again in ... four hours. Right now, I'm just gonna go for some air." And with that, he makes for the hallway at a leisurely pace.

Yuri sighs, finally relaxing, and murmurs, "And the Brother says HE'S too old for this..."

Yuri nods at Andreth, and walks back towards the kitchen.

Andreth quietly watches Ash go, noting which way he goes... as soon as Ash passes through a door, he'll head for the kitchen as well.
