Lan Leich studied his eager protégé, peering over a brimming mug of beer at the pub. The nymphs and feminine figures painted onto the ceramic mug seemed to dance in his bleary vision; he ignored it, concentrating on the boy. "So... I's here for today's teachin'!" announced the youth with all the eagerness that a lack of education and worldly wisdom permits. "Alright," sighed Lan as he leaned back into the wooden chair. He shook his head a bit to clear the mental fog, then began. "When the world was born, it is said that the gods begat other gods, and that some of them begat men - 'begat', gave birth to. Gods had children, basically. Sometimes they were other gods, sometimes men. In a few cases... the child was a little of both. "The gods.. treated with each other, in some fashion. They might argue, or go to war, but to kill one is a hard thing indeed. The gods do not age, or need for food, like we do. So, their rules are their own. It's our rules that I want to talk about. "We .. the race of men, that is.. we wage wars. We bicker with each other, quarrel with strangers, fight among friends. Most of us, though, submit to 'the rule of Law', which is to say that we obey a common code of behavior because we must. Otherwise, every man would slay every other man who gave him offense, and the world would be nothing better than handfuls of strong barbarians. "The rule of Law takes away the right of a man to say 'My actions are justified by my passions'. You cannot stab someone because he offends you, unless you also believe it's right to let another man stab you because you offended him. But by whose measure is offense judged? That's the problem. "Since no man wants to be stabbed because another man took slight, men agree that slaying their fellows out of hand is wrong - immoral - illegal. Similarly, a man wants to believe that his property and possessions are his own." Ash nodded, his unruly hair bobbing. "Right - nobody takes our land, and we don't take no other land. 'S why we build fences, right?" "Right. In this case, Law is a fence. No matter where you go, it travels with you. If you break down that fence, you no longer have its protection for yourself."

"Why did ya travel an' trade?" the boy asked, one day. "I mean, makin' money is good, but why did ya do it that way?" The old man paused, thoughtfully. Asking for motivation had been something he'd hoped to hear for a long time, and the burly youth from Lainsborough was finally doing it. He hoped a smile hadn't crept onto his lips, and forcing his face into a mask of educational passivity, Lan formulated a response. "We as a people build things - houses, wagons, swords, ploughs. We also build things you can't see, though. Family. Friendships. But, we can build things beyond those. We can build a kingdom. "A kingdom isn't just a lot of land with a ruler governing it. How did he come to rule all these people? Let us say the king went away for a year to battle the ogres of the mountains that are told in stories. In that time, how would things be different in the land?" Ash paused, turning this thought over and over in his mind. "I guess... I guess some things would be different," he announced finally. "Like what?" "Well uh.. the king's family," answered the youth diffidently. "They'd be there, and he'd be gone.. uh... oh yeah, taxes. We'd probably still have to pay those." Nodding, Lan pressed him on this point. "Taxes are part of a kingdom, and I'll explain in a moment. But go on now?" "Welllll..." The farmer's son mused long and hard. "What if someone needed to see the king?" he asked at last. "I mean, if you gotta see that something real important is taken care of...." He stops, a dawning realization holding back further explanation. "Right. Important things are what the kings and nobles deal with. A land-owner is responsible for what happens on his land. The king is responsible for the whole kingdom. If any part of it is threatened, it's the king's job to see that the threat is taken care of. The taxes your family pays help him do that. Imagine what would happen if, say, the Stormwinders came over the mountains tomorrow, but there was no army. Taxes pay for that army. They pay for many other important and useful things. "But to answer your question, I became a merchant because I wanted to be part of that larger system. I wasn't highborn, but I was clever.. for a time. I wanted to become important in something greater than just my family or my village."
