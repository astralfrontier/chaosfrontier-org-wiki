Game Log: Chapter 8 - The Practical


---------------------------------------

_Brother Starguard is a tall man, strangely dressed in the brown work clothes of the acolyte cleric. The strange part is because he seems too old to be an student in the church. His thick, bushy, mustache and beard, once black, is now salt and pepper, the darkness interspersed with star-like flecks of white. His face is light and lively, blue eyes sparkling, though with a few hard wrinkles, a few laugh lines. His nose is a bit hawkish, giving him a bit of an intense look. His body seems in decent shape, if not particularly strong, but most of his form is hidden beneath the cloth of his clothes. He wears a midnight blue robe, short, with easy release clips so that he doesn't get caught by it in a fight. Depending on the situation, he may also wear his studded leather armor, but always has his morning star at his hip, in case of trouble. He walks more like a soldier than a priest...but the wooden symbol of the two stars entwined hung on the leather strap states otherwise._

_Tilara is a young woman both pretty and possessing that indefinable presence that transforms mere attractiveness into beauty. In disguise, she is wearing a low-cut blouse under a tight half-vest, and a skirt that comes down only to the tops of her boots, and she's darkened her hair to a brick-red rather than her usual red-gold. Her bright emerald eyes are the same as always, though she's abandoned her quarterstaff in favor of a brace of daggers. Mirra, her familiar, is nearby but not with her._

_Yuri is a young man of average height and wiry build, with sandy blonde hair and an easy, fluid demeanor. He has a ready smile and a glimmer in his eye. He is dressed in a leather jerkin, light wool trousers, soft boots, and a fine wool cloak, all in subdued grey tones. The hilt of a rapier is visible at his belt; otherwise, he seems rather lightly equipped._

When last we left our brave adventurers, Ash had just left the farmhouse, and Yuri and Andreth had joined Starguard and Tilara in the kitchen for a little late night plotting, planning, and dishwashing ...

Yuri whispers something in Tilara's ear, and then sneaks back to the hallway door to keep watch.

Yuri whispers to Tilara, "I think Ferg might be an alchemist. Someone had to make those glue-balls that we found, and I think that when he was smelling the stew earlier, he was checking to see if it was tainted."

Yuri whispers to Tilara, "It's only a guess... but I'm a pretty good guesser. So let's be careful."

Tilara nods ever so slightly, and whispers back, "I'll make sure Star knows."

Starguard sighs, finishing up dishes, preparing what he can for tomorrow's breakfast, setting out some fruit for the early risers.

You hear footsteps approaching.

Tilara passes on Yuri's warning while they finish the dishes.

Yuri waves a warning at the others, then sits at a table and looks casual.

Starguard nods, considering as he waits to see who it is, idly checking the stocks.

Big Joe steps into the kitchen. "Still washing up, Steve? Must be hard being old and slow. Still, you'll not pull guard duties tonight, so you'd best be off to the common room. And your friends should join you."

Yuri looks at Tilara, as if for guidance, continuing his bodyguard act.

Starguard rolls his eyes. "Not that slow, friend. Remember, age and experience often beat out youth and energy.

Tilara chuckles and winks at him. "In more ways than one. Let's go join the others, Steve."

Big Joe smirks. "We'll see what happens in the ring tomorrow; grandpa. Even a cook must wield a ladle. And Laura? Dress carefully; wouldn't want you all bruised when Ferg's got time for you."

Yuri lets his face show a lopsided smirk.

Jonesie sidles in besides Big Joe, and eyes Andreth carefully. "Wouldn't want the wunderkind to be tired, would we?"

Starguard stretches. "Right. Just preparing for the hordes to descend in the morning. Fruit for anyone who's up before me."

Andreth gives Jonesie a grin. "Don't you worry 'bout me none," he murmurs in a gravelly voice, as he stalks off to the common area.

Big Joe snorts. "You'll be up first, grandpa. Ferg likes his hot tea and scones in the morning. Right cranky he gets, when he's not pampered right."

Starguard stretches. "As long as it's not before sunrise. I'm going to head to bed, then."

Yuri says, "He's got some high tastes for a bandit."

Big Joe shrugs. "Someone has to fence the loot. A well dressed fence is a simple merchant."

Yuri says, "Makes ya wonder what he thinks he can do with snipes likes us."

Jonesie looks thoughtfully at Yuri. "Mebbe you could start fencin' a bit, on the side like, you've got the hands and the face for it ...."

Yuri says, "He's gotta know better than we's at shaking them down."

Starguard brushes by the Jo's, heading for the bunks. "Night."

Yuri looks back at Jonesie. "I do knives, mostly, but yeah, I'd do something heavier if you tell me to.

Big Joe ambles over to the kitchen door, pulling out a key and locking it, before putting a bar across the door. "As for the rest of youse; a few more bodies always helps convince the merchant wussies not to fight."

Yuri nods, slowly. "Ah, yeah, there's always that."

Jonesie smiles at Yuri. "See ... Leo, is it? You've got the wit to be a fence. And the looks. And the hands. Can you read?"

Yuri looks at Tilara again. "I'm tired, miss."

Starguard notes the locking. "Going to give me the key for that, Joe, or do I get to wake you up in the morning?"

Yuri says, "Yeah, I can read some. It helps pass the time."

Jonesie smiles slowly.

Big Joe shrugs. "Use yer own door; one open door is easier to guard than two.

Starguard says, "Right. I'll see you in the morning. And probably in the ring. I still owe you for that lucky shot."

Jonesie looks around one last time, and then turns around, leaving the kitchen and disappearing into his own room. Big Joe looks lustfully at Tilara. "Lucky for me Ferg likes to share em out ..."

The night passes uneventfully. Around midnight, one of the other men come in and wake Ash. Shortly thereafter he goes on hi all night patrol, still favoring his wound a little.

When Ash returns from his peregrinations, he kicks Starguard's bed. "It's morning; I'm hungry.

Starguard sits up quickly, rolling out of bed like a true soldier. "Yeah, yeah, keep your boots on. I'm getting up." Blearily, he stretches. "Whaddya want, so that I can feed you and then get clean."

Ash grins. "Lemme see; I'd like a side dish of kippers, with some sausage links and a few tomatoes. Fried, of course, not boiled. And then some eggs hollandaise over some freshly toasted and buttered scones. And some excellent tea. And you silly bugger, what I'll get is the same thing I always get. Tea and sausages in blankets.

There are only small, dusty if not outright filthy windows in the common room, but even so it is slowly getting light. Dawn should be here any moment.

Starguard says, "Smartass. Save the wise-acre comments until when I'm awake enough to appreciate them." With that, he trudges to the kitchen, to get things started."

Ash shrugs and bounces into bed, playfully kicking the bunk bed above him.

Yuri wakes up and looks for Tilara.

Tilara is still asleep in one of the upper bunks.

In the kitchen Starguard finds the basic supplies; large containers of flour, a pitifully small pile of eggs, sausage links hanging from the rafters. And a small bucket containing a few leftover vegetables.

Yuri gets out of bed and walks quietly around the farmhouse and barn.

Starguard sighs as he gets things started, the smell of pancakes and sausage beginning to fill the house. Once things start to get going, he turns to the fading star light, meditating as he mindlessly works on breakfast.

Yuri checks the maker's marks on the weapons in the barn, finding that most of them came from Jane's.

Andreth grunts a little as Ash kicks his bunk, and peers over the side. Satisfying himself that it was a false alarm, though, he rolls back onto the bunk and takes the opportunity to meditate quietly while pretending to catch a few extra winks.

Yuri pauses at the foot of the staircase leading upstairs and listens.

Jonesie, woken by the noises in the kitchen, rolls out of his room and slides into the kitchen. "Steve; I'd like my eggs scrambled, with onions. Big Joe likes 'em boiled; he likes to take the ... what on earth are you doing?

Jonesie looks aghast at the pancakes. "My eggs? Big Joe's ... oh my god. Ferg!"

Jonesie walks closer, and begins to count the number of sausages in the frying pan. He also begins to turn red and pale white at the same time.

Starguard sighs. "What? It's not like there's a lot here to cook with, I know, but it's coming out alright..."

Yuri arrives at the kitchen door and waits to see what Jonesie is getting so worked up over.

Jonesie turns to look at Starguard. "Obviously you're new at this. Obviously you made a mistake, and were overgenerous in your estimation of the division of food. Obviously you haven't found the kitchen garden yet. And obviously Ferg is going to be dangerous if he doesn't get the breakfast he expects. Didn't Ash **warn** you?" Jonesie looks around once more, looking disgusted. He spots Yuri. "You! You will watch the food, while I take Steve to the kitchen garden. Don't let anything burn; if we're lucky Ferg will like pancakes."

Starguard says, "What? Ash said something about sausages and pancakes, so that's what I started making!"

Yuri blinks, a lot, and does as he's told.

Jonesie hmmmphs. "Well, we'll get Ash to take in Ferg's breakfast then. Follow me." With that, Jonesie glides out of the kitchen and through the commons room, pausing only for a moment to admire Ash's sleeping form. Stepping out into the morning dew he takes a deep breath. "Our kitchen gardens are a bit of a walk; you will be expected to weed it every day, and harvest it every morning before starting supper. The rank and file eat stew. In the morning, you will be expected to bake three loaves of bread, and no more. That is what the flour is for. We share up the eggs, when we can get them, with Ferg getting a double share and Big Joe and me getting a share each."

Yuri mutters, "All this trouble and we're going to get killed over _breakfast_?"

Starguard ohs. "I figured you had chickens out here somewhere. Or you all ate the same stuff." He shrugs.

Jonesie steps out rapidly, heading straight north. After a few minutes he has entered the woods, and reached a small plot of vegetables. "It's early yet,so there's plenty of weeding and not much to harvest. I assume you can weed?"

Tilara wakes up and stretches before getting down from her bunk. She wanders off to see what smells good in the kitchen, and is surprised to find Yuri holding the fort. She pitches in to help him keep things from burning.

Starguard says, "I have, on occasion, done this sort of thing before. Granted, I had better supplies."

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "It looks like the menu here is very particular. And the bosses gotta eat better than everyone else, or there's hell to pay. I can't believe that we'd come this far and get done in over breakfast."

Starguard shrugs. "Don't be too hard on Ash. A switch does this sort of thing."

Jonesie shrugs. "We'll get better supplies once the men become less inept. For now money is rare. But the potatoes are plentiful. And Ash will spend most of today digging them out for you, I'm sure. And he does so ... dislike ... digging for potatoes ..."

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "If you have any brilliant ideas for getting out of this, I'm all ears.

Starguard grins. "Right. Now I know."

Jonesie pulls up a few green-leaved plants and hands them to Starguard. "I'll talk to Ferg; it's your first day on the job. Just make sure you send in Ash with his and Stormy's breakfasts."

Tilara murmurs, "Nothing yet... let's see how badly Ferg takes it. If he abuses Ash over the deal, maybe we can get him to throw in with us."

Jonesie points at the field again. "One last thing; never use the same path twice. We don't want any paths forming."

Starguard nods. "Should I finish breakfast, or weed? Things are made up. Morale should soar for a day, anyway..."

Jonesie turns around. "Weed after weaponsdrill. You'll enjoy the solitude."

Andreth finishes his meditation, and stretches, yawning, before swiveling his feet over the edge of the bed, looking around and noting the empty bunks of Starguard, Yuri, Tilara, and the grunts on watch.

Starguard nods, and follows Jonesie back to the kitchen.

Big Joe's door slams open, and he soon stomps into the kitchen. "Fee fi fo fum ... I smell the blood of the cooking man ... Ah, Jonesie, smells good, doesn't it?"

Jonesie slides back into the kitchen and sits down at the table. "It's his first time, Joe. Let's not wake Ferg just yet, shall we?"

Jonesie smiles at Tilara. "Hey, honey, go and wake Ash, will you? He'll want to be here when breakfast is ready. And Ferg's up early ..."

Yuri turns over the kitchen to Starguard and sits down, wondering how deep we put our boot in it this time.

Andreth jumps down to the floor and wanders down the short hallway, to join the conversation already in progress.

Starguard idly works a bit harder on three dishes, adding what he can for the plates to the big boys.

Tilara complies, happily turning the cooking back over to Starguard and going off to roust Ash. She's a little wary, and pokes his ribs from arms length, just in case he wakes up violently. "Breakfast, Ash."

Starguard adds a couple a sprigs of parsley, rummages up some decent syrup, and sees if there's any powdered sugar for the higher ups.

Ash wakes up, grinning. "Ah, honey, I'd love to ... hmmm. That smells much better than usual. I wonder if ... oh damn." Ash's face falls, before he picks himself up and marches into the kitchen.

Starguard finishes up. "Ash, get your ass in here!"

Ash straightens up, coming almost to attention. He winces as he looks at the food that's being served.

Starguard says, "'Pigs in a blanket,' eh? You get to take this into Ferg. The good news is, they're darn good if he likes pancakes."

Andreth looks curious as Ash rushes past him in the hallway, and stands at the threshold of the kitchen, taking in the atmosphere (stressed, with just a hint of panic), and listening.

Ash takes the two plates and gingerly walks back out, knocking on Ferg's door. The door is opened, and for a few moments all is silence.

Jonesie looks pointedly at his plate. "Is it ready yet?"

Starguard nods, and puts Jonesie's together. With the bit of orange, and parsley, and the dusting of sugar, it _does_ look good. Granted, Ferg got a little cup of sugar.

Yuri leans over to Jonesie. "So... uh... Ferg's... ah... gore-man?

Yuri murmurs... "Y'know... fancy eater?"

Jonesie stands up, picks up his plate, pulls out his knife, and sits down again to enjoy his breakfast. Big Joe, meanwhile, glowers at the collection of people forming in the kitchen. Several of the other men have woken up and followed their noses. "The common room, gentlemen, is thatta way; this room ain't so big. Leo, you can help Steve with the dishes today."

Jonesie smiles at Yuri. "He likes good food; yes. Usually we rotate the cooks; on bad days Joe and I can always find reasons to be elsewhere."

Yuri nods, looking a bit nervous, and takes his breakfast to the common room.

Starguard sighs, and serves stuff up, feeding the horde with above average stuff, to say the least.

Andreth impassively follows Yuri with his own breakfast.

Yuri listens as they walk by Ferg's door.

There is an ominous silence emanating from Ferg's door, which is very firmly shut. The kind of silence that screams "Pain is being inflicted but no reaction is permitted."

Tilara lets Leo help with breakfast and wanders out to the common room with her plate. She flirts with Joe and Jonesie a bit, trying to play them off against each other a little.

Starguard makes sure he feeds himself as well. It might be a tough day.

Big Joe and Jonesie both smile lustfully after the departing Tilara before turning to look at one another. Joe speaks up first; "I found her; I get to try her first." Jonesie just smiles, and enjoys his breakfast.

Yuri finishes quickly and walks back to the kitchen to help Starguard with the dishes, again listening outside Ferg's room...

Back in the common room, several of the other men are tucking into their breakfasts. One of them looks up. "Steve sure can cook. But better'n we can. I hope he stays."

Shortly after breakfast is all cleared away, Jonesie glides into the common room. "We won't be joined by Ash today. Ferg has sent him on a little errand. But for the rest of you ... Big Joe has agreed to take over your training while I ... examine ... the new blood." The men turn pale, but rise in a group and leave for the barn. Jonesie turns to look at Tilara. "Now, Laura, do take care t not get hurt? Ferg's ... cranky."

Starguard shrugs. "Mind if I go first? I've got weeding and lunch to work on."

Tilara shrugs. "I'll try not to get hurt. Why are you worried about it? I thought Ferg didn't want me?"

Starguard blinks, looking up. "Does this place have a second floor?"

Jonesie smiles. Or is that a smirk. "He might still change his mind; and he likes his peaches unbruised."

Andreth rises smoothly to his feet, regarding Jonesie silently. If he heard anything overhead, he makes no sign - his focus is on the promised 'examination'.

Tilara says, "Hmmm. I'd prefer to stay that way myself. Let's see what happens."

Jonesie waves barnwards. "Well; the exam shall consist of two parts. In the first part, I shall attempt to kill you. In the second part, we shall see if you are any good with the light crossbow. And you, Steve, wished to go first. Well, lead on then, lead on."

Starguard stretches his arms out, pulling out his morning star, giving it a few warm up swings. "Wooden weapons, I wonder?"

Andreth just says, "Simple 'nuff."

Jonesie looks at Steve. "Wooden weapons? For the most part, yes. We're a little short on healers. He failed his final exam, unfortunately. Now, why don't you lead into the weapons hall?"

Starguard smiles. "Did some of that too, in my younger days."

Starguard mutters to himself as he heads into the training room, quickly casting a short spell on himself...then again, trying to keep his words and movements unclear.

Yuri gets up and moves to the door, getting between Jonesie and SG.

Andreth follows along behind Jonesie, 'Steve', and Yuri his thugs' gait quite authentically (un)practiced by now.

Jonesie pulls a slim brownish dagger out of his sleeve, as he waits for Steve to precede him. Smiling, he twists his wrist, the dagger sailing out from between his fingers ... and watches it land in Steve's shoulder.

Jonesie smiles, stepping out of Yuri and Andreth's ways. "Lesson one, cook. Never walk in front of your examiner. Now, why don't you go back to the common room; there should be bandages in there. Staunch the wound and I'll get back to you. Leon? You're up. Try to hit me."

In the weaponshall, everyone is working carefully in pairs in the corners. In the furthest corner, one of the men is getting some personal attention from Big Joe.

Tilara's eyes narrow behind Jonesie's back. _Bullies, the lot of them. We won't be doing anyone any harm by taking them out._

Yuri purses his lips, pulls his sap out of his sleeve and takes a swing at Jonesie.

Starguard yanks the dagger from his back. "Bah. It's only a scratch. I'll be fine."

Andreth grunted and tensed up a little, as if for a leap, when the dagger flew. But when the attack wasn't followed up, he relaxes again, watching 'Leon' take his shot.

Jonesie doesn't take his eyes off Yuri. "That was an order, cook. Go put a bandage on it."

Starguard shrugs, and heads off to do so...keeping an eye on Jonesie, this time.

Jonesie takes a step back, watching the sap swing by. "I see you think you're a hot little thief, Leo. Now try to kill me please, I don't have all day."

Yuri grunts, and switches to his dagger. "This isn't my kind of fight! I'm not used to fightin' fair!"

Starguard returns, a neat bandage on his shoulder. "Neither is Jonesie, I'd wager."

Jonesie looks down at the gash in his arm. "Not bad, Leo. Not bad. Go get a wooden weapon from the rack nearest the door. And you too, Steve. That's a neat bandaging job. I see you have multiple talents ..."

Yuri puts his dagger away and goes to fetch a wooden weapon, watching Jonesie out of the corner of his eye. _He's going to try something. I don't like his 'Rule One',_ he thought.

Starguard watches Jonesie as he picks up a wooden mace. "Yeah. I also do needlepoint."

Andreth strolls up to Jonesie, dagger drawn and in hand...

Jonesie steps aside, smiling at Steve's rejoinder, and disappears into his room for a few moments. When he returns, he's wearing a new top. It clinks slightly. He eyes Tilara and Andreth.

Andreth steps forward, draws his dagger and strikes at Jonesie, waiting for no further invitation.

Jonesie dances backwards as the blade turns on his clothes. "I think, Tom, that we'll leave you until last.

Tilara pulls one of her daggers out of her top and flings it at Jonesie while he's concentrating on Andreth.

Andreth steps backward, replacing the knife as he says, "Fine."

Jonesie easily dodges the daggers and smiles at Tilara. "I like a woman with spirit."

Tilara sticks her tongue out. "You moved."

Jonesie raises an eyebrow. "Of course I moved, dear. Men who don't move are awfully boring in bed. Unless you're into necrophilia, too?"

Starguard pauses, waiting, watching for his turn. He'd really like to smack this arrogant bastard.

Tilara icks. "I don't think there's enough money in the province to get me into that."

Big Joe notices the commotion near the front door and stops his fight by tapping his opponent on the temple once. He saunters over. "Well, Jonesie, want to try out the first three in the ring? We can use up the cook first; the garden needs work. And then Tilara. I've got some clothes need mending."

Starguard shrugs. "Fine by me..."

Jonesie nods. "We'll try them on the crossbows, too. I'll take them in the ring, if you'll get the targets set up. And the others need to work on their stamina; time for water duties I think." The other men, hearing this, queue up by the door.

Tilara just raises an eyebrow at the 'mending' comment. "You don't want _me_ mending your clothes. I went into my line of work 'cause I was not good at that."

Joe smirks. "Honey, you'll learn. It's amazing what a few carefully inflicted bruises can do for a woman's learning capabilities. Now why don't you come help me set up the targets?"

Andreth's eyes flicker toward Joe almost unnoticeably, showing no other sign that a mental counter was just incremented.

Jonesie walks into the ring. "For the purpose of this exam, Steve, you will swing at me three times. To pass, you must still be conscious after the third swing. And you may swing first."

Starguard enters the ring, none to eager to close, watching the cocky thief. He moves his arm a bit, faking a wince in his shoulder...

Jonesie walks around the ring, casually keeping his distance ...

Starguard circles closer, wary of his defense, and takes an experimental swing as he get within range.

Jonesie easily dodges the swing, following up with a counter blow of his own as a sap snakes out and slaps Starguard on the side of the head.

Starguard steps back, shaking his head to clear the pretty stars. "Nice tag," he admits. "Now, I have to swing twice more, or you do?"

Jonesie smiles. "You do."

Starguard swings twice in the air, nowhere near Jonesie. "How's that?"

Jonesie chuckles. "Pathetic, cook. Pathetic. I hope you can wield a crossbow; we need a cook. Or perhaps Ferg will take pity on you."

Andreth buries his face in one hand.

Yuri says, "Who's next?"

Starguard grins, and steps out of the ring. "I'll patch people up after they get stuck in, thanks. Leave the in close stuff to you young 'uns."

Jonesie smiles. "And now the pretty little lady. Three swings miss; weapon of your choice. What'll it be?"

Yuri gives Tilara a Look. _This OK with you, miLady?_

Tilara looks around. "Have you got a staff? I think I could handle that."

Jonesie points at the rack. "Help yourself."

Tilara fetches a quarterstaff from the rack, holding it deliberately clumsily as she comes back to the ring.

Jonesie steps into the ring. "Three swings, little lady. That's all you need to make. Three swings."

Starguard shrugs, and hangs up his wooden mace. "Might as well make a fool of myself with the crossbows, too." Noticing Big Joe's watching the fights, he shrugs and waits.

Jonesie waits patiently ...

Yuri waits, back to the wall, and watches what's going on in the rest of the barn.

Tilara shifts her hands to a better stance at the last moment before taking her swing. It doesn't connect, but at least it isn't a joke.

Jonesie dances back out of the staff's range, but fails to connect on his counter shot. His reach comes just a little short.

Tilara moves in cautiously, taking a rather ineffectual poke at Jonesie, but he still misses while dodging it.

Andreth wanders over to the racks as he watches, selecting a quarterstaff and testing its weight.

Tilara backs off, taking her time and finally darting in to take another swing. Unfortunately for her, this time Jonesie slips inside her guard and whacks her solidly with his truncheon. She folds up and sits down heavily, dazed by the blow.

Jonesie takes a step back, looking at the dazed woman. "Steve? Tom? Take her to the common room, please. An hour or two in bed, and she'll be fine ... And now you, Leo. What will your weapon of choice be?"

Yuri grunts. "Generally a garrote, but for today, this club will do."

Yuri takes a glance at Tilara, then steps into the ring.

Andreth leaves the quarterstaff in the rack and, with Steve's cooperation, helps Laura out of the ring.

Jonesie smiles. "A garrote. How ... refined. Well, you know the story. Three swings, conscious, you're in. Three swings, unconscious, you're out."

Yuri, with more grace than he knew he had, swings at Jonesie and raps him smartly across the shoulder, upsetting his counterattack.

Yuri steps in for another swing at Jonesie's shoulder, but is too wary of the better fighter's skill, and they both miss.

Jonesie waits for Leo's last attack to pass him by, then steps forward and firmly taps the young man on the occiput with his sap. "Right. After we're done with Tom, we'll try you on archery."

Yuri winces and backs off, to see if the fight's really over.

Big Joe steps forward. "Hey, Tom, you ready for us?"

Yuri says quietly, "You could mop the floor with me if you wanted to."

Andreth, returning to the weapons hall, selects his quarterstaff and swaggers into the ring. "Yup."

Jonesie smiles at Yuri. "Don't take it too badly; that first blow was nice ..."

Yuri nods, and backs off, still wary.

Big Joe looks at Andreth and raises an eyebrow. "A quarterstaff. How original. You're competing for weaponsmaster lad; you get three swings at me, and then three swings at Jonesie. But since I'm using my trusty greatclub, you only need to survive two swings to join us."

Stormy wanders into the common room, and notices Tilara. "Lady, are you alright? Did Ferg change his mind?"

Starguard grins. "Now we'll see a good match. Go to it, lad!"

Yuri sidles over to Starguard and whispers in his ear, _Be ready_.

Andreth grunts, "Lucky me," and wades in swinging...

Tilara blinks at Stormy. "Hmm... No, I've got a headache. Tried fighting with Jonesie. I'll be fine."

Stormy looks relieved, and sits down next to Tilara. "So, Laura, do you like magic? I like magic. It makes me tingle all over."

Andreth's wild swing breezes by Joe's ear, and the greatclub connects with the side of his head, sending him sprawling. He wobbles up onto one arm, then crawls into a crouching position, shaking his head as if in a daze. A nearly inaudible "dammit" is heard from ground level.

Big Joe takes a step back, and leans on his club. "Sorry, Jonesie; I didn't mean to break him. Shall we say ... one more blow?

Jonesie nods. "Shall I do the honours? He is at least the first man I've seen survive that club ...

Starguard says, "Can I have a minute with him, gentlemen? He's a bit scrambled..."

Yuri watches this, somewhat alarmed.

Jonesie takes a step back. "Surely, cook. Surely. Although I'm not sure what you could do ...

Tilara slowly opens one eye and looks at Stormy before closing it again. "Makes you tingle? I never really thought about it... Do you like it here at the farm, now that you've made it?"

Andreth wobbles unsteadily to a standing position, waving at Steve dismissively.

Stormy nods shyly at Tilara. "It was wonderful, being able to talk to Ferg. He answered al my questions. And tonight I'm to go practice out by the river!"

Starguard nods, and waits at the side of the circle...

Jonesie smiles, and steps forward again. "A spirited weaponsmaster is always a good thing ... And one who can stay on his feet when saps are flying by ..." As Jonesie talks he steps forward, swinging only at the last minute but completely missing Andreth.

Tilara chuckles and grins in spite of herself. "Don't set the whole forest on fire, okay?"

Tilara thinks of something else. "What happened at breakfast?"

Stormy shakes his head, blushing a little. "That's why we work out on the river. Water doesn't burn easily ..."

Yuri relaxes, but only a little.

Stormy giggles. "Oh, Ferg was steamed at Ash. He just had him stand and stand and stand, and then he threw some silver pieces at him. Ash is under orders to be back from Woolwich by tomorrow morning, with a dozen fresh eggs ..."

Big Joe watches Andreth, considering. "Well, we'll put him to bed. Maybe we can try him out again tomorrow, Jonesie. I think the food was too rich for him this morning."

Tilara says, "That shouldn't be too hard for him to manage. Don't quite see what all the fuss was, meself... Steve does good pancakes."

Andreth grins unsteadily at Joe, and backs out of the ring, using the quarterstaff as a crutch. "Got me back fair 'n square," he remarks to Big Joe as he heads back to the common room, gratefully accepting any assistance Starguard or Yuri might offer at this point.

Stormy chuckles weakly. "We can't really afford good food yet, and Ferg doesn't like wasting his money on untried troops. And none of us have been tried and true yet."

Starguard offers a shoulder to the poor young lad. "It's a pretty nasty club, innit?"

Yuri turns to Jonesie before they go. "What now?"

Jonesie looks thoughtful. "Well, I think Tom and Laura should have a bit of a lie down. Why don't you help Steve with his weeding, and we can finish the exam this afternoon. Obviously you're going to need a fair amount of training. But your wits are ... passable."

Big Joe nods. "Maybe tomorrow. Say Jonesie, you said Leo was a rogue. Think he's any good at locks?"

Tilara hmmms. "You'd think he could have you do some hunting, though. Stretch the money farther..."

Yuri nods, and helps Andreth and Starguard limp back to the common room.

Stormy nods. "Oh, Big Joe hunts. But Ferg doesn't want us out too much; says he doesn't want people to know where we are."

Jonesie looks at the departing Yuri. "Hey Leo! Picked any good locks lately?"

Starguard grins. "Go talk to 'em, Leo. I can handle him."

Yuri turns back. "Nope. Never had much call to do that."

Jonesie shrugs. "Well, he's not much of a thief, but he has a good wit and a quick tongue. We could apprentice him with Ferg. Take some of the pressure off Stormy ..."

Starguard helps 'Tom' into the bunkroom, peering around to see who's in here.

Big Joe nods. "I'll tackle Ferg after lunch. He's ..." Big Joe steps into the hallway, and opens Ferg's door. "He must be out just now."

Yuri blinks?

Yuri sees that the attention is off him, and goes back to the common room. To Starguard, he says, "I'm supposed to help you weed. Weed what?"

Yuri checks on Tilara.

Starguard says, "The garden. Can you distract them for a moment, Leo?"

Tilara is lying down, chatting with Stormy

Starguard chances it, quietly chanting his prayer to give Andreth a little boost.

Yuri motions at Stormy, in Starguard's view, but out of Stormy's, then sits at one of the common chairs in view of the door.

Stormy leans over at Tilara. "Want to join us tonight? I could make you some really nice fireworks ..."

Tilara chuckles. "I don't know if Ferg would like that. Tell me about it tomorrow, okay?"

Stormy nods, blushing to his roots. "I will. But I'm sure Ferg wouldn't mind. He knows I ... ummm ... I'll tell you tomorrow!" Stormy stands up and flees into Ferg's room.

Tilara chuckles to the others. "He's a nice boy, but shy."

Starguard stands, stretching. "Right. Shall we get going, 'Leo'? We've got a garden to weed."

Yuri nods, shoots Tilara a last look, and follows Starguard out the door.

As Yuri trots out the door, he is met by the other men, who each come carrying one filled bucket of water, to be taken through to the kitchen.

Yuri steps out of the way and lets them pass.

Starguard waits, and liberates the last bucket from the man in line. "Give me that. The garden could use it."

The man gives up the bucket, and ducks into the bucket hall, where Jonesie can be heard making caustic comments about laggards who walk when they should be running ...

A the garden, after Starguard had finished his praying for the day, and Yuri had satisfied that no listeners lurked in the shadows ...

Yuri finally relaxes, his shoulders dropping about four inches away from his ears. "Gods. This is killing me. It's too bad I'm not really a criminal, these guys definitely have the right idea about how to run a gang.

Starguard pulled small green bits out, tossing them out to the grass. "I know. The only thing I've thought of doing is adding something to the stew tonight..."

Yuri says, "If I wasn't so disgusted I'd be envious."

Yuri leans down. "Which of these are the weeds, anyway?"

Starguard blinks. And quickly points out a few of the significant bits of plant. "The ones like this, K?" He sighs. "Not particularly well done..."

Yuri says, "I think you have the right idea there, but ferLuriel'ssake don't try it on Ferg. He's got some taste in his tongue and I think he'd know in a hurry. For that matter, don't overdo it with the others, he might smell it even if he doesn't eat the same stew."

Yuri pulls on his gloves and does his best to pull the weeds, not the crop.

Yuri says, "Anyway, they're fairly lax about inside security. It would be a fairly simple chore to bind and gag the lesser crooks halfway between patrols."

Yuri says, "It's the bosses I'm worried about. Jonesie, Joe, and Ferg. Oh, and Stormy, too, but I think that Tilara can win him over. Or at least convince him that he doesn't want to be a problem."

Starguard says, "Just after the change would be better. And nailing the doors shut somehow..""

Yuri says, "It's hard to nail something quietly."

Yuri says, "But that's the idea. If we can come up with some way to slow down Joe and Jonesie while Ferg and Stormy are out practicing magic tonight, we can probably pull this off."

Yuri says, "I don't think we're going to be able to bring the bosses in alive."

Starguard shrugs. "Actually, I should be able to save them from anything but the worst wounds..."

Yuri says, "I'm a little concerned about the second floor. Did you hear any movement up there?"

Andreth stirs as he's recovering from his wounds. "You hear that, Til? Footsteps," he says quietly.

Tilara nods, and whispers back. "That's where Ferg is, I'd bet. Wonder what's up there?"

Starguard nods. "I did. There's someone up there."

Yuri says, "The door at the top of the stairwell is padlocked. There's no open windows, which means if we can keep it locked, someone coming down would have to break through a wall or a floor."

Yuri says, "The whole point is that we can't take on the whole gang at once, so we have to slow them down as much as possible."

Yuri pulls another weed. "What would you use as a drug, anyway? And could you protect us from it?

Starguard says, "Honestly, if we could get just two of them at a time, all four of us could take just about any pair.""

Andreth says, "If Ferg's up there, he's got another way in, cos it's locked from this side. Maybe he's got someone imprisoned up there or somethin'. I heard some kind of filing sound earlier, too."

Yuri says, "I have to admit I'm pretty damn scared. This is a lot more than I thought we'd run into. We could just take the weapons and run in the middle of the night and it would be mission accomplished... but somehow I think that Ferg and company would take that personally. You saw how much damage they can do with just tree limbs."

Starguard nods. "I'm the one who backed off, remember? It was a good tag."

Yuri rubs his smarting arm. "He got me, too, but not too bad. I should be fine for tonight.

Andreth sighs. "I can't think of any way to find out, though. Be awful suspicious, us crawling up that staircase to listen atta door. An' maybe it's just another Stormy or somethin'."

Yuri says, "I think I'm honestly scared that I didn't get knocked on my ass. I'm developing this illusion of competence that I don't have."

Yuri says, "D'ya think I should be praying or anything? My family's not too religious, but I guess it can't hurt. Seems to work for you, anyway."

Starguard chuckles. "No problem here, Leo. I've been getting knocked on my ass all week." He pulls up a last bit of green, examining the plants for anything that needs harvesting. "It wouldn't hurt. The stars are there to guide us all, but we do need to look up at them."

Yuri sighs. "You do your routine, then. I'll finish up. We need you in top form, too.

Starguard says, "I'm alright. And I'm thinking of cheating a little at the range..."

Yuri says, "We're almost done here, then. What are we going to tell the others? You need to figure out how to doctor the stew... apart from that, it's just 'get up at midnight and go'."

Starguard nods. "Sure. it'll be easy in stew." He shrugs. "Let's get back. I suddenly feel a little better about shooting."

Yuri nods, and gets up. "I'm glad. It would be hard to keep this charade up."
