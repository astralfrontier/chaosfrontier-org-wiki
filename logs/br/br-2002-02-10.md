Game Log: Chapter 9 - Aiming For Completion


-----------------------------------------------

_Brother Starguard is a tall man, strangely dressed in the brown work clothes of the acolyte cleric. The strange part is because he seems too old to be an student in the church. His thick, bushy, mustache and beard, once black, is now salt and pepper, the darkness interspersed with star-like flecks of white. His face is light and lively, blue eyes sparkling, though with a few hard wrinkles, a few laugh lines. His nose is a bit hawkish, giving him a bit of an intense look. His body seems in decent shape, if not particularly strong, but most of his form is hidden beneath the cloth of his clothes. He wears a midnight blue robe, short, with easy release clips so that he doesn't get caught by it in a fight. Depending on the situation, he may also wear his studded leather armor, but always has his morning star at his hip, in case of trouble. He walks more like a soldier than a priest...but the wooden symbol of the two stars entwined hung on the leather strap states otherwise._

_Tilara is a young woman both pretty and possessing that indefinable presence that transforms mere attractiveness into beauty. In disguise, she is wearing a low-cut blouse under a tight half-vest, and a skirt that comes down only to the tops of her boots, and she's darkened her hair to a brick-red rather than her usual red-gold. Her bright emerald eyes are the same as always, though she's abandoned her quarterstaff in favor of a brace of daggers. Mirra, her familiar, is nearby but not with her._

_Yuri is a young man of average height and wiry build, with sandy blonde hair and an easy, fluid demeanor. He has a ready smile and a glimmer in his eye. He is dressed in a leather jerkin, light wool trousers, soft boots, and a fine wool cloak, all in subdued grey tones. The hilt of a rapier is visible at his belt; otherwise, he seems rather lightly equipped._

When last we left intrepid party, Starguard and Yuri had just returned from the kitchen garden with a pail full of vegetables for that evening's stew. Tilara and Andreth had spent some time chatting with Stormy, who as a consequence had gotten all bashful and run away. And there were footsteps overhead.

Starguard rummages around the kitchen, "Hey Leo? How about you get some people to help cut veggies?"

Big Joe swaggers into the common room, four light crossbows nonchalantly draped over his shoulder. "Right, sissyboys. Time to earn your supper." He looks around, then hollers "Steve! Leo! Get yer butts in the weaponshall!"

Yuri says, "Uh oh. Sounds like it's time to get our asses kicked again."

Tilara says, "We just have to try hitting a target this time. Right, Joe?"

Yuri says, "Leave the veggies for now. We can find some help later."

Andreth swings his feet off the bed, and hops off onto the floor, following in Joe's train.

Big Joe smiles lazily at Tilara. "We have the butts set up at the far end. Three bolts; and we'll see how you do. After all, every member has to pull their weight ..."

Tilara winks at Joe. "I'm sure I can manage to pull _something_."

Starguard moves from the kitchen to weaponshall, worried. He's not the shot he used to be, and, let's face it, what he used to be wasn't that great.

Big Joe leads the way to the hall. Just inside the door, he hands out a crossbow to each of you. "Bolts we keep on this rack, same as the bows. Now these are not blunted bolts, so I recommend not moving away from the wall without permission, see? I don't know how good Steve is, but do you really wanna show his skills off by ... well, you know, getting an arrow up your butt? And Laura? Just pull the crank; these are not toys ..."

Tilara nods. "I've seen them before. I'll be careful with 'em."

Yuri nudges Starguard. "Don't worry, Bro. Ya don't need to be an expert ta rob people.

In front of the large closed barn doors, four archery butts are set up side by side. They look well used, but still usable. Big Joe points at spots along the wall. "For the first shot, you stand. Second, you crouch. Third, you lie down."

Starguard sighs. "Dammit, my job is to keep the rest of you full and strong enough for **you** to shoot straight."

Yuri says, "I'm sure Ferg can be swayed if you feeds him right."

Starguard says, "Mind if I use mine, Joe? Nothing serious, but it's easier with a weapon you know..."

Big Joe smiles at Starguard. "Sure, old man. Wouldn't want the cook to flunk out on a technicality; those pancakes weren't half bad."

Starguard sighs, and gazes at the targets. He offers a small prayer to the Stars, slowing his breathing. "Who's first?" he asks.

Tilara shrugs. "I'll go first, if no one else wants to."

Big Joe shakes his head. "Everybody ... aim! Everybody ... fire!"

Big Joe purses his lips and whistles. "Not bad, nt bad at all. All four of you hit the targets, and Laura and Leo; you almost shot bulls eyes.

Yuri says, "They's movin' less than yer average mark."

Starguard smiles, and pats his crossbow.

Tilara chuckles. "He's got that right. On the other hand, they're smaller than your average merchant guard, too. It's an even trade."

Andreth smiles at Joe. "Just needs a steady hand," he says, as he drops to a crouch, winding up the crossbow again.

Tilara reloads her crossbow and goes down on one knee for the crouching trial.

Big Joe motions. "Right. Everyone of you, crouch down, as if you're hiding behind bushes or a tree, or or summat like that, and try your second shot."

Starguard quietly reloads. "A little luck doesn't hurt, either..."

Yuri cranks it up and fires again.

The four recruits go down on one knee, carefully aiming. While Andreth's bolt goes astray, and Laura's bolt doesn't make it down the length of the hall, having embedded itself in the wall, Starguard's bolt politely inserts itself into his target, and Yuri's bolt goes straight through the archery butt. and lands in the door behind it. The archery butt, its structural integrity disturbed, dissolved into a pile of loose straw.

Starguard looks over at Leo, jaw dropping. "By the stars! Nice shot!"

Tilara giggles. "Leo, you _killed_ it."

Andreth mutters something inaudible as he watches his bolt spiral off course, and raises his head just in time to watch Yuri's target collapse.

Yuri looks pretty amazed himself. "I shoulda tried one of these a long time ago."

Big Joe stands up, coming to attention. "Hold your fire!" He moves forward, and kicks the pile of straw, before trying to pull the bolt out of the barn door. After a moment, he leaves it be and turns around. "You know ... mebbe ... mebbe you should take over from Jonesie. We could try you in the ring right after. For now, you can share Laura's butt; she's certainly not gonna break hers any time soon."

Yuri leers at Laura's butt behind Big Joe's back.

Yuri says, "Jonesie could smear me. I knows me limits."

Big Joe sighs. "Damn; and we hate training ...

Yuri looks at the ruin of his target, shrugs, and tries for Tilara's.

Big Joe resumes his post at the door. "Now, on the floor. We'll see how you do from that position."

Tilara frowns at the poor second shot and lies down for the third shot. This time she aims more carefully and braces herself. Her third shot goes right through the bullseye, but doesn't disintegrate her target.

Again the bolts fly. And again Andreth's bolt goes wide, as does Starguard's, while the other two bolts jostle for space near the bulls eye on Tilara's butt. Big Joe sighs. "Right, Tom, that will be two penalty laps for you; twice around the perimeter. And sprint. Laura, Steve, one lap each. And then I'll see you back here. Don't dawdle. Leo! You put the butts away."

Yuri shrugs, pulls on his gloves, and hauls the butts back against the wall.

Andreth nods at Joe wordlessly, lays his crossbow on the rack, and runs out to the edge of the camp in silence.

Starguard gets back up. "Eh, not bad for an old man," he says to himself, stretching for a moment before heading out through the kitchen at a good military lope.

Big Joe turns to look at Yuri. "So, Leo ... what do you think? Think you could run the artillery?"

Yuri looks like he's carefully considering this, which he is.

Tilara puts her weapon away and jogs after the other two. _Ouch. This disguise isn't meant for running._

Yuri says, "Dunno if I's as good a teacher as that."

Jonesie glides into the weaponshall, after watching the others exit. "She bounces nice, Joe. What'd she do? Miss?" Big Joe points at the bolt still stuck in the side wall. "Badly."

Starguard keeps Tilara company on the run. "Nice shooting, by the way. With two in the bullseye, that middle one must have been a loose feather or something..."

Yuri says, "Easy to do it meself. Harder to show someone else."

Jonesie whistles. "And the one in the door?"

Big Joe nods at Yuri. "Perfect shot; killed the butt. I'm thinking we make him a corporal, run the artillery. Some of the bigger ambushes, we need covering fire."

Tilara nods as she jogs along with Starguard. "I thought so, too. Ah, well... don't want them to think we're _too_ good, either. We'd threaten their positions in time if they realized that, even if they don't suspect what we really are up to."

Andreth is well ahead of Tilara and Starguard before he realizes it, and out of earshot. Ah well... he puts on a bit extra speed.

Jonesie turns to look at Yuri. "Think you can handle it? You'll spend time training, them, of course. But mostly you'll be running the covering fire during the ambushes. Ferg's been looking for a man like you ..."

Yuri sighs. "I does what I'm told."

Starguard smiles. "Nice to know that I'm still competent, though. If I had screwed that one up, they'd have thrown me out on my ass."

Tilara grins. "What, and have to eat Ash's cooking?"

Jonesie nods. "Right; you get the men mornings, right after breakfast. Give em time to settle after they break their fast. And you'll be responsible for keeping the water in the kitchen replenished too. The men should be back by now; check the commons room, and tell them it's time for afternoon weapons practice.

Starguard chuckles. "Good point." He frowns. "Figured out how you're going to stay out of other's beds for the night yet?"

Tilara snickers, then ouches. "After this? I won't have to pretend I'm hurting."

Starguard says, "Good. We're thinking about making a move tomorrow night. But...have you heard the noises upstairs?""

Tilara nods. "I think Ferg was up there when Jones couldn't find him this morning. I have no idea what else is up there. Want to check tonight while he's off watching Stormy practice burning the river?"

Yuri nods, and walks off to the commons room to see who's there.

Starguard nods. "I'd like to know what's going on before we do something stupid..."

Tilara says, "Or instead of, perhaps..."

Starguard trots into the kitchen, "Right. Supper to work on..."

Yuri steps into the common room and counts, somewhat uncomfortable with drawing attention to himself. "Right. Jonesie says it's time for weapons practice."

Yuri glances at the rest of the bandits to see what kind of physical condition they are in.

The men groan in unison, looking a tad wet and bedraggled - their feet covered in red mud, before heading off to the weaponshall. Peter stops a moment. "So, you'll be joining us then?"

Tilara comes in shortly behind Starguard, trying to move carefully. "Does that include me?"

Yuri says, "I dunno. What's afternoon practice, usually?"

Starguard says, "Well, Laura, I do need someone to cut veggies..."

Andreth never did quite lap Starguard and Tilara, but he finishes his second lap shortly after they finish their one. He comes in the door a few minutes behind Starguard and Tilara, breathing hard.

Peter looks over at Tilara. "I'll spar with you, if you like. I wouldn't mind going easy on those ... curves. But yeah; even Stormy spars in the afternoon."

Yuri shrugs. "Guess so. Looks like tomorrow I gets to show y'all how to handle crossbows.

Tilara glares at Starguard. "Steve, I didn't agree to come out here to be a full-time kitchen drudge. I'd rather spar."

Peter smirks. "Finally found someone who can aim, did they? Gods know, I didn't sign up for all this **work** when I took their coin."

Yuri shrugs again. "Ferg's a guy what knows how to make a better bandit."

Yuri says, "Gotta be either for a man like that, or against him. You take your pick."

Starguard sighs. "Don't suppose that someone could be spared to help, at least?

Andreth listens to the byplay in the kitchen for a few moments. "Time for weapons practice, eh? 'scuse me." he says shortly, weaving around Tilara on his way to the weaponshall.

Yuri looks back at Peter. "Who will Big Joe least likely care, if we send him to help Steve?

Yuri says to Andreth, "Be there in one minute. Promise."

Peter blinks. "What, Steve isn't in the weaponshall right now? I suggest he drags his butt over, before he becomes the new target. Ferg says that **everyone's** gotta be there.

Yuri nods, and hustles his friends over, muttering, "Safest to do it this way for now."

Starguard growls. "When the heck am I supposed to get dinner done?"

Yuri mutters to Starguard, "It's only gotta taste good to _Ferg_. The rest of us can live on boiled turnips.

The afternoon is spent in a bonegrinding round of sparring exercises, where Jonesie and Big joe pair people off in pairs, in foursomes, and in one-on-four battles. By the end of the afternoon the men look wasted, the tart looks crushed, and Ferg looks both satisfied and hungry. "Steve! You have an hour! Everyone else; to the river! It's washing time!"

Starguard groans, sore. "I need a veggie cutter!" he says as he heads towards the house...

Yuri mutters to Tilara on the way to the river, "Ai yi yi."

Tilara mutters, "I am _not_ taking a bath in front of this crowd. I hope he just means hands and face."

Andreth winks. "Don't worry, Laura, I'm sure Fergie doesn't wanna share your gorgeous bod with the whole crew."

Yuri says, "One step at a time. Did Steve tell you what he was thinking?"

Peter drags Laura along. "Come on! There's this natural hot spring ... and if we hurry we can get to the warm bit ... Although mebbe the guys would make room for ..."

Tilara blinks. "I think I'll wait until the rest of you go back to the house. Thanks anyway."

Yuri shoots Peter a dirty look. "Gotta negotiate first, bucko."

Peter shrugs. "Water takes a while to clear after we're done, and Ferg doesn't let people eat late. So it's your choice ..."

Tilara pokes Peter in the ribs. "I don't display the merchandise except to paying customers, boyo."

Kearney races on up ahead, and waits for everyone. Holding back the branches of a willow tree, he grandiosely waves everyone into a shallow cave, where water laps at your feet within moments. And within moment there are many naked men entering the water with blissful looks on their faces.

Yuri sighs.

Yuri mutters to Tilara, out of earshot of the others, "We go tonight, or later?"

Tilara shrugs, ever so slightly. "Tonight, unless you want to take a chance on Ash helping us."

Yuri says, "He won't be a problem. Better to be fast."

Yuri mutters to Tilara, "I better get in there. Your choice if you wanna join or not. I'll cover if you don't."

Tilara sighs and looks at the water. _Well, it's in character to go in. And it does look nice..._ She nods to Yuri. "If they get grabby, back me up, okay?"

Yuri nods, and sighs. "I'm running on bravado, here. This might make a religious man out of me."

Harry and Herb turn around, watching Tilara enter the pool. Harry whistles, while Herb blushes but keeps his eyes firmly riveted on her main assets. Big Joe examines her carefully. "You know, JOnesie, she might last past the first night ..."

Tilara sinks gratefully into the water, both for the warmth and the concealment. "This is nice..."

Yuri cautiously immerses in the spring, trying to stay in character. "This ain't criminal, bandits don't live this good."

Andreth grins at Leo. "Damn straight," he gravels, as he massages his tired legs.

Jonesie smirks, from where he sits. "She might ... she might ... But leo, how do you think we've recruited so many? The others should be coming back within a fwe days."

Yuri says, "Others? Hunh. I thought these weren't enough for the big jobs. Ya gots more?"

Tilara looks up at Jonesie and Joe. "That's good to know. I was hoping we weren't everyone."

Jonesie nods at Yuri. "The other half dozen are on patrol. Once they come back, you can pick four, mebbe five, and start turning them into a unit."

Yuri says, "'Unit'? Who's army? That's a mighty big word for us cutpurses."

Kearney sits down next to Yuri, and nods at Tilara. "So she's taking customers? Think she'll ... ummm ... "

Jonesie smiles. "Ferg's got big plans; we're going to **own** the trade routes. Once he gets Stormy up to par so we've got a bit of backup, and with the new supplies and all ... We've pretty well finished recruiting; the house won't sleep many more. If this keeps up, Ferg may have to open up the second floor."

Big Joe sinks deeper into the water. "I can't wait until we get the ball rolling; we'll be able to name our price ..."

Harry nods, and nudges Peter. "Glad we came in when we did ... in a month or two they wouldn'ta looked at us ..."

Peter dunks Harry, and the two begin to wrestle, splattering peoples ...

Harry in turn tries to dunk Andreth.

Meanwhile, back at the farmhouse, Ferg walks into the kitchen, smelling the air appreciatively.

Tilara takes the opportunity to get out of the water while they're preoccupied. _I'm going to need to get one of them alone and ask about that 'first night' crack._

Starguard rattles around the kitchen, flipping sausages, stirring the stew, trying to come up with something else to add.

Ferg lounges against the door. "So, Steve, you like being a chef ... do you?"

Andreth makes a brief attempt to resist Harry, just testing his strength, before letting himself be dunked. Unless of course Harry really is stronger than him.

Yuri says, "Second floor? I thought that was the attic."

Starguard smiles. "Always liked cooking. Good food, good health, in my opinion.

Andreth comes up after a moment, spluttering and laughing, and playfully shoves Harry back into Peter.

Jonesie nods. "Second floor. Ferg's kept it padlocked, for now. Last one in there hasn't been seen since."

Peter rebounds into Kearney, and drags him down. Kearney, spluttering comes up and gasps for air. "No fair! You shoulda oughta ... hey! Wha'happened to the babe?"

Yuri says, "Think she decided that was enough of a free sample."

Ferg nods once. "Yeah, good food, good health, good happy bandit. So; what kinda food would you buy if you had a fwe coppers, and a chance ta go to market?"

Yuri says, "So what's Ferg do all day, then? Is he some kinda magician, if he's teachin' Stormy how to do it?"

Kearney looks disappointed and sinks back to the bench. "Feh; first babe we've seen since the other one, and all she does is flaunt it ..."

Starguard hmms. "You need the basics. Flour, oats, cheese, a little yeast... And whatever the heck you want. I've got a sausage casserole planned for the night...

Jonesie smiles ... "Ferg? He's the cunning mastermind, the one who runs the ... ah, I see what you mean. Done a fair bit of traveling, he has. And he reads a lot. Got a whole trunk full o' books. And he's read everyone of them." Jonesie shakes his head. "I don't see it meself. But he's got a wee bit of a grudge against the merchant as fired him, so ..."

Tilara waits outside the cave, listening as she dries off and gets dressed. She suppresses a chuckle at Kearney's complaint. _You ain't seen nothing yet, boyo._

Ferg nods. "Right; make up a list then. Weren't any point in buying real food while the men we're burning it, but I think we might just keep you on as cook. And ... you mentioned needlework, I believe?"

Peter ducks Harry again, and Herb splashes em both. Big Joe begins to growl. "Right; you lads've had enough slack time; git!"

Starguard says, "Who? Me? I can mend a little..."

Starguard says, "A little too much practice sewing up cuts."

Ferg nods. "Right; you're the new housekeeper then. You're too old for the fighting, really, so you'll be responsible for the food, keeping the buildings maintained, and repairing any armor as gets damaged. You'll be excused from morning practice **only**. Understood?

Herb leaves the pool too. "So Jonesie, who gets the guard duty tonight? I watched last night ..." he whines ...

Starguard nods. "Have to plan supper a little beforehand, but sure. Someone else does the dishes, though, so I can practice. I used to be decent in a fight, and the mind is still there. The body needs more work, though.

Ferg shoots a look at Starguard. "What do you think this is; a democracy?"

Yuri says, "I'll do it. Always better to know what's outside the lady's bedroom."

Starguard says, "You don't need brains to do dishes, and I figured you want me competent rather than lousy."

Jonesie shrugs. "Kearney? You've got first. Harry? Second. Peter, third. Pick one of the newfies and take em along, show em the ropes ..."

Ferg hmmmms. "Right; take the tart. I want ehr cleaned up for tomorrow.

Starguard nods. "Sure. She could use the rest."

Big Joe grins. "Don't take the tart though; she needs her beauty sleep."

Kearney shrugs, and gets out of the pool. Sliding into his clothes he grins at the other men. "Last man back to the kitchen has ta sweep the common room!"

Andreth dries and changes quickly, joining the rush for the farmhouse, and doing rather well at it.

Tilara grins and starts back to the house at that comment.

Yuri doesn't try to rush, he's got too much on his mind.

Jonesie watches everyone else leave, sinking a little deeper into the water and gesturing at Big Joe to come closer. "We'll move Kiel tonight. He's been a little too ... active ..."

Starguard hears the tromp of booted feet, and quickly finishes things up, making sure the spice is right, and considering how to get the antidote to out side.

Ferg sits down at the table. "Well? When's supper finally going to be ready?"

Starguard smells, checking the casserole, and stew. "Stew's ready, casserole's close. Baking takes a little longer to do right."

Ferg nods and stands up. "Right. I'll be in my room. Send the tart to deliver.

Big Joe nods. "Right. Where can we stash him? Do you think ..."

Starguard nods. As Ferg leaves, he quickly gets out the antidote, ready to add it to certain bowls...

Jonesie hmmmms. "Nah, Ferg'd never go for it. What if we ..."

Big Joe nods. "Right; down the hatch, then.

Jonesie rises up out of the water, grabbing a towel. "Shall we see what the new cook has managed to accomplish?"

Kearney makes it into the kitchen first, followed by Andreth. The others follow in rapid succession and begin snatching up bowls.

Starguard serves up the stew, handing out full bowls...and makes sure that Andreth's is spiced special...

Eventually Jonesie and Big Joe saunter into the kitchen, collecting their bowls and sitting down at the table ...

Tilara gets in line with the others, fairly near the front since she had a head-start.

Andreth takes his bowl in turn, and adjourns to the common room after Kearney.

Starguard says, "Laura, the boss wants you to take his food in for him. Hold on a minute?"

The others collect their bowls, rhapsodize over the smells, and disappear into the commons room. Big Joe and Jonesie, meanwhile, are tuckering in. "Hey chef! Got any dinner rolls?" Big Joe hollers.

Tilara stops on her way to the common room and comes back to the kitchen. "Okay. Where's his bowl?"

As Yuri gets his stew, he gives Starguard an inquisitive look.

Starguard says, "Plate. Hold up, Joe, Jonesie, you've got casserole that's...ready, actually." He takes the pan out of the over, and the smell of sausage increases to mouthwatering."

Jonesie smiles widely, offering up his empty bowl. "Serve em up, old man. I think I'm beginning to like you ..."

Andreth catches a whiff of the casserole from the next room, and remarks to his fellows, "Damn, the big boys eat good. Not that this here's bad stuff."

Tilara winks at Jonesie. "He's useful to have around."

Starguard grins, and scoops it out. "There's enough in there you don't need buns, let me tell ya." He adds another plate to Tilara's load, making sure that his party gets the antidote spice.

Jonesie smirks. "Well, as long as Laura keeps her buns, Ferg'll be happy ...

Tilara snorts, and wiggles her hips as she carries Ferg's tray to his door.

Starguard grins, and keeps ladling out the stew. "Some sauce. Gotta get some sauce when I go."

Over dinner, Yuri whispers to Starguard and Andreth, 'I heard. Kiel's in the attic.'

Yuri doesn't wait for a verbal reply, just a nod, before going on, to minimize risk of being overheard.

Starguard huhs, eating stew...and a little casserole, of course. "Figures."

In the common room, the men are ladling up the stew, inhaling it almost. Kearney, first to finish, dashes back to the kitchen with his dish, hoping for leftovers ...

Andreth's eyes widen a bit, but he goes back down to his food. No need to comment.

Starguard says, "Touch the casserole and you're a dead man!"

kearney holds out his bowl. And behind him the others are queueing up."

Jonesie chortles. "Hey, chef! We're hungry!"

Tilara knocks on Ferg's door. "Dinner, boss!"

Starguard grins, and ladles out what he can. "Would that there being such a queue to do dishes..."

Andreth lingers over his stew, apparently savoring the taste rather than wolfing it down like the others.

Stormy opens the door, then scuttles through it. Behind him, Ferg is sitting at the table, reading a book. He closes it, and stands up courteously. "Come in, Laura. Come in. Where's your plate?

Tilara says, "I left it with Steve. D'ya want me to bring it in here?"

Yuri is, frankly, too worried to eat too much, and tries not to let it show. He drinks a lot of water instead.

Ferg shakes his head. "On second thought; no. Join me tomorrow night. Make sure you've bathed."

Moving further into the room, Tilara can see both the bed and the table, currently piled with books. In the corner, a wardrobe stands closed, and a little chest is visible underneath the bed.

Ferg points at the table. "Just put it down, girl, and scat. I won't eat you."

Tilara nods. "Sure thing." She puts Ferg's tray down and contrives to flash a bit of cleavage at the bandit chief while she does so. She heads back out again, wiggling her hips to stay in character...

Stormy scuttles into the kitchen, collecting his own food and electing to eat it outside, sitting in the grass.

After polishing off the last of the stew, the men collect in the common room, rolling into their bunks. Most of them begin to snore, although Kearney is happily humming. "Hey Tom; wanna walk the patrol with me tonight?

Andreth nods to Kearney. "Yeah, sure." He hops to his feet and falls in step behind Kearney.

Kearney grins. "Oh; we don't walk out yet, Tom. Not till it's dark.

Andreth catches Yuri's eye and nods quietly. Then ohs. "Oh, right. I'll get the hang of this yet..."

Starguard smiles, and begins working on the dishes, the sound of snoring music to his ears...

Andreth looks around. "Huh. Everyone else's nodded off. Think I'll go see if ol' Steve needs a hand with the dishes." He stretches, yawning a little himself, and heads for the kitchen.

Yuri says, "Think I'll just sit here for a while. Been a long day."

After a few minutes, Yuri gets up and walks quietly around the room, taking a few seconds to evaluate each sleeping bandit.

Stormy wanders back through the kitchen, dropping off his bowl, and disappears into ferg's room.

Yuri notices that Kearney and Harry are awake. "Hey, got a deck of cards? Got some time before patrol?

Kearney nods. "Sure. Poker?

Yuri says, "Yeah. Just fer coppers, OK? We gotta stay friendly."

Andreth hehs at Starguard as he washes dishes. "Ain't gonna have much help tonight - everyone musta stuffed themselves full."

Harry grins. "You have coppers? We usually just play for chores."

Starguard grins. "So they did. Must be tired, and good food can put you out pretty good..."

Yuri says, "I'm lazy, and miLady doesn't usually go places where they have chores. So I always keep a few pennies around."

Harry nods. "Right; we'll put up the water chores against yer pennies then. Deal, Kearney."

Tilara wanders over to the card players. "Need a fourth?"

Andreth scrubs a bowl. "Still got enough for patrol, though. Kearney 'n me'll be goin' out after dark."

Starguard says, "I'll see **you** when you get back then?""

Yuri says, "Your choice, miLady."

Kearney grins at Tilara. "And what'll you have to trade? We can't do yer chores for you ..."

Andreth doesn't miss the emphasis, and offers Starguard a covert grin, and an overt nod.

Tilara says, "Hmmm. Good point... But I've got coppers, too. Or maybe kisses?"

Harry grins. "Right, babe. Ante up."

Tilara sits down at the table and puts her pennies down, matching Yuri's stake.

Kearney oys! "You said you'd play for kisses. We want our ante!"

Tilara grins. "Oh, all right." She goes around the table, then, giving each of them a kiss and a hug to start the game, not leaving out Yuri. "Better? Let's play."

Yuri grins for the first time in a while.

The boys play enthusiastically and in no time at all, Kearney notices it's getting late. "Right; I'm on patrol. Harry, I'll wake you when it's your turn. Tom?"

Yuri thinks to himself, _Right. A poker game. Finally, somewhere that I'm not in over my head._

Yuri umms... "Who's third patrol again? I don't think it was me."

Kearney says, "Third is Peter. He hasn't picked a pardner yet.""

Andreth nods at Kearney. "Yup, let's go."

Yuri goes off to bed, but doesn't fall asleep.

Kearney holds the door open, before heading out into the forest. "Just follow behind me; we'll circle a few times, but make sure never to follow the same path twice. And walk very very quietly ..."

Andreth walks very quietly indeed. It's something he's good at, after all.

Andreth watches their path as he follows for likely trees to hide behind, falling a little further behind Kearney.

Kearney slowly moves through the trees, stopping every so often to listen.

Andreth steps behind a tree, and makes a soft 'urk' sound. Kearney hears the noise, and doubles back, whispering softly, "Tom?" As he passes Andreth's tree, the monk closes behind and swings a silent punch, missing the side of Kearney's head by inches.

Andreth mutters a silent curse, but spares no other words for Kearney, as he follows up with a kick at the man's midsection, which also whiffs.

Kearney whirls around. "What? Who? Tom? What the ... oh!" He swings his shortsword wildly ...

Andreth swings again, but again Kearney dodges clear of Andreth's fist.

Kearney dodges back, before bringing his sword back in to bear. "why, Tom?"

Andreth decides Kearney deserves a little explanation. "I'm sorry, I just can't let this happen. Kyah!" he cries, as he gathers his _ki_ and executes a leaping kick, sending the man sprawling, unconscious.

Kearney sprawls.

Andreth sighs, shaking his head. The man'll be conscious again in a few hours, and it won't do to have him blabbing. He sneaks back to the farmhouse, and seeks out Yuri and Starguard for advice.

Andreth quietly moves into the common room, avoiding the chairs and bunkbeds before finally reaching Yuri and tapping him on the shoulder. Yuri quietly climbs down, and follows Andreth outside.

Yuri whispers to Andreth, "Well? Where is he?"

Andreth hisses softly. "He's out in the forest... I know the way back. He saw me attack him, though, so we're going to have to do something to make him stay quiet until it's all over."

Yuri nods, and sighs. "Well, we're committed now. We're going to tie the others down; you take some of the rope and make sure he stays safe and immobile."

Yuri says, "Then hightail it back here. All three bosses are still inside, so we have to figure out how to keep them from rushing us."

Yuri thinks quickly, and gives Andreth his cloak and a dagger. "Here, feel free to cut this up to get something to bind him with. That will save time."

Yuri puts his hand on Andreth's shoulder. "He's alive. I think that's what the Oak wants. Let's not argue about it."

Andreth nods. "Sorry. The Spirit of the Oak was just not with me tonight." He takes the cloth and the dagger, and does as he's bid, binding Kearney as securely as he can, cutting an extra strip for use as a gag.

Yuri goes back inside and quietly wakes Tilara, then goes to the weapons hall for the rope.

Andreth sneaks back to camp afterward, giving Starguard a sign when he sees him keeping watch.

Starguard waves, and motions Andreth closer. "I think they're almost done..."

Andreth nods, and takes a pillow from his bunk. "Have we got Harry yet? We'll need something to keep him from making noise until we can get him gagged..."

Tilara whispers, "Harry wasn't very sleepy. We'd better be careful with him... I'll muffle him if it's needed."

Yuri nods, and whispers, "Thanks, I totally forgot. I'm nervous as hell."

Yuri takes a few deep breaths and nods. "OK. Wear a glove and put your hand over his mouth, I'm gonna try and wrap him up.

Tilara nods. "Will do."

Yuri mouths, "On three... one... two... THREE."

Yuri quickly slings the coil of rope around Harry and reaches under the bunk to go for a second coil.

Andreth takes a spare rag from the cloak and hands it to Tilara. "Gag him," he says, as he moves to hold Harry still while Yuri moves.

Harry wakes up, wide eyed. "What the ... Hey! Lemme go!"

Harry begins to flail wildly, feeling the rope constrict his movements. Tilara being the closest assailant, he clouts her upside the head, leaving her to see stars for a few moments ...

Yuri hisses, "Pin him!" at Andreth, and puts a dagger at Harry's throat, hissing in Harry's ear, "Shut up and you'll live!"

Harry freezes, his hand still raised in midflail, as he looks wide-eyed at Yuri. "Kearney?"

Yuri hisses. "He's fine. Now shut up and listen.

Yuri says, "We hate competition. We're taking over. Nobody's gonna die unless they give us trouble."

Andreth takes up the rope and finishes up Yuri's tying-Harry-to-the-bed work while Yuri's occupied keeping the knife to Harry's throat.

Harry nods mutely.

Finally, every man jack in the commons room is tied to their bunk. And all without raising a general hue and cry.

Yuri says, "Sleep it off like a hangover. Tomorrow morning, either we'll be dead, or you can go. So either way you don't have to do anything now except shut up and play nice."

Yuri says, "And if Ferg does kill me, feel free to tell him you put up a fight."

Yuri makes sure that Harry's got the picture before relaxing.

Harry sighs, and closes his eyes, relaxing as much as he can.

Tilara grins, and leans over to whisper to Harry. "That's better. Be quiet, and I might even forgive the black eye you just gave me."

Yuri whispers to Tilara, "That's the lot. What's for the bosses?

Tilara whispers, "With any luck, they'll be asleep, too. Starguard loaded their casserole pretty well, I believe. Let's check them one at a time... Joe first?"

Yuri whispers, "We should find some way to block the doors. Even just a few moments delay could save our hides.

Yuri whispers to Tilara, "Which way do their doors swing?
