Game Log: Chapter 15 - Ferg's Farm, Revisited


-------------------------------------------------

The intrepid party, having formed the White Company in honor of the difficulty of bleaching wool purest white without destroying the tensile strength of the wool, look at one another. "The dagger", they mutter. "The Farmhouse", they ponder. "The traps and poisons and really large rats," they consider.

Yuri hmms. "Didn't Ash accompany some families to that farm?"

Yuri says, "I thought I heard that the town had sent some people to occupy it."

Father Pesci nods. "And we've had good reports. They found some large mostly gone to wild but replantable vegetable gardens, and there's excellent forage for pigs."

Father Pesci smiles at Yuri. "And with the river close enough for the occasional fish, and enough room for all four couples, they've decided to homestead there. They haven't heard back from the rest of Ferg's party, either. Bad news travels fast."

Yuri says, "I wonder if they'd object to us having a look around in those tunnels."

Starguard says, "I'd think they'd be in favor. I mean, having a tunnel to who knows where under your bed..."

Tilara says, "I'd be surprised if they wouldn't insist on it. If I were them, I'd want to know what's down there."

Yuri says, "It's possible that they won't be back. If they heard what happened to Ferg, they might have decided to go somewhere else."

Yuri says, "In which case, they aren't our problem."

Tilara nods. "If they've heard."

"I'm sure they wouldn't, son. Just approach politely, and keep your weapons sheathed. Dom's a bit of a hothead." Father Pesci spreads his hands. "You can bring them a basket from me, too. Jen's still feeling a little nauseous."

Yuri says, "Then shall we go? We can pick up food on the way out of town. We need to hurry, because I need to get back while the caravan is here and negotiate a deal. It appears that Big Joe and company are back in the Old Goat and training. They should be able to stay out of trouble for a few days."

Yuri says, "We'll be happy to carry it, Father... umm... which one is Jen?"

Starguard says, "The caravan's showing up tomorrow, why not wait and go after they get here? We could all use a day's preparation time."

Father Pesci looks pointedly at Brother Starguard. "No, young swot. Army tomorrow, caravan the day after tomorrow."

Tilara says, "I definitely could use a couple days to practice... I've spent most of the last week in bed. No rush, is there?"

_And it was such a **good** contract too_, Father Pesci glumly considers.

Yuri says, "Well, the caravan gets here soon, but it doesn't leave for almost a week. I... think I want to be here to see them off. Part of it is that I want to make sure they stay out of trouble - and they're more likely to do that if we're here - and part of it is that I want to make sure that they're OK. After going to all the trouble to spare their lives... well, I don't want to see that wasted."

Starguard smiles at the Father. "It was good for two, but not for four."

Father Pesci nods, glumly. "Indeed. Well, lads, make yourself at home. I have an engagement with Brother Oak and a barrel of finest mead."

Starguard nods. "Good point. So leave today, and get the cricks out on the road?"

Tilara says, "Hmm... I suppose we could. Take Stormy along?"

Yuri says, "I suppose that we should. He's safest with us."

Yuri says, "We're not expecting to run into any monsters or dangerous animals."

Starguard winces. "Do you think he's ready, Til? He's just a young un...could we leave him with someone? I mean, he's getting pretty good swinging a stick around, but if we ran into bandits or something..."

Tilara says, "Hmmm. But the only bandits are what's left of Ferg's gang. Shouldn't be a problem."

Yuri says, "It would be best to leave him in the care of a mage, but we don't know any others."

Father Pesci raises an eyebrow. "You can't leave him with me? He has a fair bit of garden to repair, still ..."

Andreth grunts. "Who says there won't be dangerous animals? I mean, where'd that rat come from anyway?"

Tilara says, "Heh. We'll leave him with you if you're willing, Father. I thought you'd appreciate the respite from having to douse things."

Yuri looks around the room, at the buckets and casks of water and sand...

"He knows how to work the water pumps, miss. And undoing the damage he's caused won't do him any harm." Father Pesci strives hard to look like a benevolent old teacher. The kind of look Brother Oak can assume without thinking about it.

Stormy looks down at his feet, blushing. "I **am** trying, sir. I swear!"

Yuri says, "Well, I guess it's OK if we'll only be gone a few days. Just be careful, Stormy, please."

Stormy looks up at Yuri, and nods. "I'm always trying, sir."

Tilara nods. "Keep practicing the exercises we've been doing, and try not to ignite things that don't need it."

Stormy nods once, smiling radiantly at Tilara.

Tilara smiles fondly at the boy. "Let's be about it, then. Mirra? We're going walkabout again."

After carefully packing needed goods, with a side trip to the market for a few days of travel rations, the party set off for Ferg's farm. The weather being beautiful, if a trifle brisk, the party makes good time, and reaches the bridge shortly after noon. Here, where a path leads into the forest to Ferg's farm, is the first evidence of changes in possession. A sign, carefully painted, points up along the path. It reads "Four Families Farm: Fresh Eggs".

Yuri says, "Looks a lot friendlier this time."

Yuri listens carefully for guard dogs or other hazards.

The path hasn't changed much, merely a little cutting to push back the undergrowth. The path hasn't gotten any shorter either.

Yuri says, "Ash, you didn't run into any trouble before, did you? When you led them out here?"

Ash shakes his head slowly. "Trouble? Not really.... well... no, no problem." He's got a disturbingly cheerful smile.

Ash says, "Everything was fine domestic bliss as far as I know."

Yuri shrugs. "I suppose we can just go up and knock...

Yuri picks a path up to the kitchen door and knocks on it.

The clearing around the house contains a few loose sheep, watched by a young man who waves cheerily when he sees Ash. "Well met, fellows! What can we do for you!"

Ash waves back and calls over, "Brought some friends here.." He encompasses the group with a waving hand.

Yuri says, "Greetings. I am Yuri. I see you know Ash. These others are Tilara, Brother Starguard, and Brother Andreth."

Yuri says, "We were here a little over a week ago to clear out some brigands. However, we never finished our sweep of the cellars, which we know to contain at least one dangerous trap. We were hoping you'd allow us to enter and search for others?""

The man whistles once, and a large shepherd dog trots up. Patting it on the head once, he sends it towards the sheep. "Well, fellows, come on in. Anna's got supper in the pot and as long as you don't mind pot luck we'd be happy to share with you."

Andreth coughs quietly in Yuri's direction, holding out the basket he's carrying.

Yuri says, "Father Pesci at the Temple of the Stars asked us to carry a basket for Jen. Do the other families live here?"

The fellow nods once. "Jen and Dom have the big bedroom, I share one of the rooms with my wife, Anna, Tom shares with Beth, and Dobbs and Flip are using two of the bunkbeds.

Yuri murmurs to Starguard, "I'd carry the basket to your Flock. Andreth seems... uncomfortable with the role."

Starguard smiles, and offers to take the basket from Andreth. "Who's your midwife out here? You're a long way if something goes wrong, after all."

Andreth hands over the basket gratefully, and remains as unobtrusive as he can manage.

Ash loiters quietly. He looks like he's enjoying the whole scene, but there's a wistful look on his face as though he doesn't expect it to last long.

"I'm Pat, by the way. And we don't really have a midwife. Father Pesci promised to come visit when Jen's closer to her time." Pat shrugs, philosophically. "And beyond that, we've all seen lambs and kids born."

Starguard smiles. "Ah, he has? Good then. I'm a student of the Father's. He's a very good man."

Pat nods. "And amazingly learned. So, won't you come in? I can smell the fresh bread. Anna! We have company!"

A young girl sticks her head out the kitchen door, and waves, her braids blowing behind her. "Come ine, come in! Pat, can you call the menfolk? Time to wash up!"

Tilara smiles. "After jerky for breakfast, pot luck sounds fine... ooh, fresh bread?"

"Oh, hello, miss. Yes, fresh made. Want to come help me cut it up? Do come in; there's water behind me if you need to wash up, and what's in the basket? From Father Pesci? Oh good! Jen's lying down; she's not feeling so well."

Yuri realizes that he's somewhat edgy from the previous trips to the farm, and tries to relax.

Starguard grins, following in. "I'm afraid we didn't bring anything for the meal. Not well? Perhaps I could take a look." He smiles at the homey atmosphere of the barn and the people. So much has changed in a few days.

Tilara says, "Much more congenial than the last visit we made..."

Yuri looks around... _So much about the story of a place, depends on the people in it..._

Anna waves at Brother Starguard. "Go on through, you know where it is. She'd love some company, but we're just a little busy. We're still trying to get everything up and going. Try to cheer her up? And please, come in, come in, come in ..."

Starguard nods, and sets his pack by the door. "Andreth, could I get my kit from you?" In a few moments, he's headed in to check on the mother and child.

The kitchen looks much as it did before, although there are now eight stools around the kitchen table, and there's far more pottery and cookware. The scent of freshly baked bread hangs comfortably on the air, and in a large pot on the hearth stew is simmering along comfortably, occasionally going _glop_ with a satisfying little burst of air.

Yuri has a seat on a stool, and looks around. "So... Pat, right? How has it been this last week? The farm looks quite different this time."

Jen is lying on the double bed, a bowl beside her on the floor. The air smells stale, between the lack of window and the contents of the bowl. She smiles weakly when she sees Brother Starguard. "This one's kicking early, sir."

Andreth settles himself in with his companions, still staying quiet but unbending a little as the congenial atmosphere settles around him. He even manages a bit of a smile.

Starguard smiles. "Ah. Energetic? That's a good sign. Hmm, a bit stale in here. Oh, sorry. I should introduce myself. I'm Brother Starguard, a student of the father's. May I have a look?"

Tilara cautions Mirra to behave and offers to help in the kitchen.

Pat pops out a moment, and whistles loudly on his fingers, before coming in and sitting down. "Yeah, we've been working hard to get the old house up to shape. She's held up well, a' course, but we'll be putting in better windows by the bye, and we've plans for the barn and the loft. For now we just use the barn for the chickens, And the sheep at night. Tis amazing, to go from the little bit of land my fa could promise to this expanse ..."

Starguard presents the basket. "The Father sent this along for you, as well.

Mirra jumps up on a high shelf and curls up comfortably, licking one paw. _Milk?_

Tilara grins at her familiar. _I'll ask. But they don't have cows. Would you like sheep's milk?_

Jen sits up carefully. "He did? How kind. Ah; he must be a miracle man, knowing what it feels like. Oof; my sis's never had it so bad. I don't know why the babe is so determined to kick."

_Fresh milk_

Yuri says, "Well, I'm sure this isn't the only abandoned farm. And it was occupied under strange circumstances before."

Anna grins at Tilara, and hands her a kitchen knife. "There's the loaves, I just pulled em out. Cut em up, and the lads will be grateful.

Yuri says, "As to the tunnels, I think you haven't sent anyone into them, or you'd be the worse for it. So you must be keeping them closed, yes?"

Pat shakes his head at Yuri. "We've piled as much rock as we could on the trap door. That should keep it shut enough. And there's few abandoned farms, Yuri, as are in this fine a condition. And defensible, too.

Tilara takes the knife and starts slicing the bread. "Is there any milk? Mirra was asking..."

Starguard smiles. "Perhaps he's telling you get get some exercise. I think some fresh air would be good for you during the day. It's starting to get pleasantly warm out. Mind if I feel your tummy?"

Anna nods. "In the jar, over there. Fresh goat's milk. Would the kitty like some? Here, let me pour it out." She pours out a little milk and puts the saucer up by the kitten. Mirra smiles enigmatically. _**fresh** milk good!_

Tilara chuckles. "She says fresh goat's milk is fine. You'll spoil her, putting her dish beside her like that."

Starguard smiles, feeling. "Seems alright. Just an active little one. Just take the herbs to help with the nausea, and get some fresh air. Actually, airing out in here would be a good idea..."

"Och and won't it be making it easier not to trip on the saucer then?" Anna winks, smiling. "That's a good cutting job. And here's the menfolk. Dom; will you fetch some chairs from the common room? We haven't disposed of them yet, you see. They're useful times like this."

Four young men, and a young lady, file in. Their hands and faces are still dripping a little but are otherwise clean. Two of the men immediately walk through to the common room, returning with familiar looking chairs.

Yuri nods, slowly... "Well, we just want to make sure that all of Ferg's old devices are dealt with. Ferg was a nasty sort, and those tunnels shouldn't be used before someone's taken the sting out of his lair. And I'm sure you want the use of your cellar." Yuri smiles.

Jen smiles. "Aye. And I hear suppertime. Shall we go sit in the kitchen, sir? A little bread usually stays down, if I eat it slow."

Anna turns to look at Yuri. "You're going after the tunnels? Splendid! We weren't sure what to do with them, and ... it would be comforting to know where they lead."

Tilara says, "Might not be good for storage, though. Remember the rats?"

Starguard nods. "You've got to eat, the little one needs the food. Here's what. I'll make you up a tea, and you drink that with your meal, and you shouldn't have to worry about it not staying down."

Pat grins. "Oh, we've no need of the cellars yet, other than for the really bad wind storms when Luriel's throwing another tantrum. We'll be using the loft for storage for the time being."

Yuri says, "Well, as far as we can tell, they lead nowhere now. They may have led somewhere before; I've heard stories of bands of brigands that used them as hideouts and highways."

Jen nods gratefully at Brother Starguard. "Thankee. And if you'll show me the way of it, I can brew it myself in the future. It'll help; 'tis not fair my not being able to work."

Pat nods. "Well, will you be going after the tunnels tonight or tomorrow, then?"

Starguard laughs. "Don't you worry about it. Once you have a little one around, you'll find you'll do enough trying to keep up with them to more than make up for it." He smiles as he comes into the kitchen, opening the door wide. "Mrs. Anna? Do you have some hot water about? I'm going to show Jen how to make a nice tea for her stomach."

Anna nods at the kettle on the hearth. "We boil all our water, sir. Keeps the red flakes out."

Tilara shrugs. "I was thinking in the morning, so we'll have all day. We've had a long day already, getting here."

Starguard smiles, and takes a bit of the hot water, and shows Jen how to make the tea, listening to the conversation as it combines with good food to make a wonderful atmosphere.

Ash says, "Searching fresh makes sense to me. I for one would like to enjoy this while I could."

Anna claps her hands together. "It's settled, then! You can bunk with Dobbs and Flip", and as she waves two towheaded young men blush and look down at their hands, "and set down in the morning! Come, sit, sit, supper's a waiting."

Starguard grins. "So how do you like it out here? Having any problems?"

Anna bounces happily from hearth to table and back, juggling bowls, spoons and mugs. "We've had a wonderful time. We sold our first dozen eggs to some young men last week, and the garden's are coming along really nicely, and there's oodles of forage for the piglets da's sending along next month, after they've been weaned."

Tilara says, "Young men? What'd they look like? How many?"

Starguard pitches in on the table setting. "Looking for a new beau, Til? What about Dobbs and Flip here?" he asks, archly, teasing the poor girl...and the boys, too, of course.

One of the towheaded lads looks up. "Bout half a dozen, ah reckon. Bought two eggs a piece, and a gallon of fresh milk. They came up, greeted us, and went away with less coin and more food."

Tilara snorts at Starguard. "Not what I had in mind. Thought they might be Ferg's stragglers. They sound too polite, though."

The other lad looks up. "Well, we had dogs, ye ken. Dozer, and Crowfer, and Gerrout, and they wur awfu' loud."

Ash nods. "Then again, there's no sense in trying needless banditry if you're just traveling. So it's no proof."

Yuri says, "Ash, did any of the others have any distinguishing marks that our friends here might remember?"

Tilara nods. "That helps. Well, sounds like you've got things under control here. And the food is delicious... would you like a little entertainment this evening, by way of thanks?"

"That would be wonderful, milady. 'Tis what Jen and I miss the most; me ma has the loveliest singin' voice, and we can hardly hold a tune."

Tilara smiles ruefully. "Well, I can't promise you a song, I'm afraid. But I'm a fairly good juggler."

Dom smiles. "Tis a lovely thing to watch, milady, and we'd be grateful. And perhaps ye can share a little of the news? We never expected it would get so lonely here."

Starguard smiles. "Tilara's quite a juggler. How's the tea, Jen? Feeling a bit hungrier?

After supper is devoured, and the pots, pans, and dishes quickly scoured, the party adjoins to the common room where there's more room for Tilara to show off her skills. Late into the night, the group marvels, and applauds, and asks her to share her skills. Jen adopts Mirra for the evening, patting the kitten, who soaks up every caress. It's not till the candles die down that people notice the time and disappear to bed.

Next morning, Dobbs and Flip are up with the dawn, slipping away to attend to chores.

An hour or so later, the smell of frying eggs rouses the party. Anna whacking a frying pan with a ladle to wake up the house helps, too.

Yuri wakes, momentarily disoriented by the lack of ruffians.

Yuri saunters into the kitchen, pondering the plans of the day.

Anna grins. "Sit, sit. The lads are out, already, having broken their fast, but we know city people prefer to sleep late. And it was a late evening. Dom's moved the bed aside for ye, and Jen's agreed to help move the rocks."

Yuri says, "I don't think Jen should be moving the rocks. We've always moved our own heavy objects in the past."

Starguard smiles. "She'll be the supervisor, I think. We might be city folks, but we're pretty strong, at least. And she shouldn't be moving rocks."

Yuri says, "I always do what the doctor tells me, as best I can, especially if it's of the nature of 'Stop bleedin', ye damn fool! Yer stainin' the carpet!'"

Anna nods, and disappears into Jen's room, where voices are heard debating the issue, before Anna comes back out with Jen in tow. "Now sit you down, young lady. Sit. We've bread, and some more of that tea, and I won't be having any of this. Hush."

Andreth stretches his arms. "Movin' rocks I can do."

Jen looks gratefully at Brother Starguard. "The tea helped that much sir, it's great not to be waking every hour to heave."

Starguard smiles. "I realize it's tough, Jen. But try to take up...oh, drawing. Or making lists of things to be done. You really can't doing much physically now you're getting on in the pregnancy."

The rocks, individually not that big, are quickly piled to the side of the trap door after breakfast. The trap door opens as easily as ever, and the ladder is still there.

Yuri sighs. "OK... can we get a lantern from somewhere? I guess I'll be going first."

Yuri starts down the ladder, hoping Starguard and Andreth will light a torch before he reaches bottom.

Starguard works to light the torch Andreth has, then lets him head down.

The ladder, as before, is about twenty feet long. And the rungs are still as sturdy as ever.

Yuri says, "Well, at least we shouldn't have any new surprises to contend with... and since we're not in any hurry, I think I'm going to take this slowly."

Andreth carries the lit torch behind Yuri, holding it up.

At the bottom of the ladder, Yuri steps out into the tunnel, taking care to step exactly where the prior footsteps are. The ground looks undisturbed, with the exception of the footsteps that the party has added. So perhaps that's not actually saying a great deal.

Yuri looks around, prodding odd-looking bits of masonry with his rapier. "Everything's pretty much the way we left it..."

Starguard says, "Good news..."

Moving down the corridor, Yuri carefully stays with the footsteps, muffled as they are now. Exactly 100 steps in, the footsteps move to the left side of the passage. Yuri stops.

Yuri hmms. "I wonder why he'd duck left here... Ash? Any ideas?"

Tilara says, "We just followed suit last time, didn't we?"

Ash says, "Eh.... no real idea."

Yuri says, "Yeah... but now we're trying to sanitize this hole in the ground..."

Looking carefully at the floor, Yuri spots what could be - if his eyes aren't deceiving him - tiny holes.

The holes form a mesh across almost the entire passage for several feet, leaving only a foot's breadth of leeway along one side. Kneeling down, and bringing the lantern really close, he can see the edge of a pressure plate.

Yuri hmms...

Starguard hmms. "Spring it?" he questions.

Yuri says, "I don't know what this is but it looks nasty. We could try setting it off, it might be the kind of thing that only works once."

Tilara says, "As long as it isn't gas. You think it might be caltrops or something?"

Yuri says, "If any of Ferg's other surprises are indications, it will shoot poisoned needles. Shall we get some heavy rocks and find out?"

Starguard nods. "I think spiked rods, myself.

Andreth says, "This stuff might predate Ferg, y'know. And Tilara's got a good point 'bout the gas."

Starguard says, "Just throw a rock on it from down the hall a bit."

Tilara says, "So... we stand back and throw rocks. If it's gas, we hold our breath and run, and I toss fire at it to see if it burns."

Yuri says, "I don't think it will be gas. I think we should do what Starguard, suggested, and then break it once it's sprung."

Yuri says, "Who wants to go back for the rock?"

Andreth offers to go back for a supply of rocks.

Yuri says, "Please do."

Yuri gets everyone back about fifteen feet from the panel, and asks Andreth to heave a rock at it.

Andreth winds up for the pitch...

Yuri says, "I think it's just gonna pop up some poisoned needles... which we can then break off, and that will be the end of this problem."

Ash waits near the back, thinking.

As the first rack lands in the area indicated, a forest of slender needles pop up about three inches, before sinking away again.

Yuri says, "Ah, crap."

Yuri gets closer to look for a way to break the mechanism.

Yuri takes Andreth's other rocks and piles them on the pressure plate, then sets his pack on top of it.

The needles stretch for the ceiling, quivering at attention, their ends black.

Tilara says, "Nasty little trap. Someone has a sick sense of humor."

Starguard hmms. "Black ends..."

Tilara nods. "Poison of some sort, I'll bet.

Andreth watches Yuri bend down over the needles, and hands Starguard his healer's kit back for the time being.

Yuri says, "We could just break the damn things with a mace..."

Yuri says, "I think it's gonna be tricky for me to snip off all of these. Anyone have any other ideas?"

Andreth rubs his chin. "Pour a bunch of cement over 'em all? Course, we don't have any with us right now."

Starguard nods. "No worries. We can do it later.

Yuri sighs. "Starguard? May I borrow your mace?

Tilara says, "Wood would probably be cheaper and easier, though."

Yuri pulls on gloves and wraps a kerchief around his face. "We'll do this the easy way.

Andreth says, "Won't seem the easy way if you get stuck with one of 'em..."

Starguard hands over his mace. "Careful, those look as bad as most of Ferg's poisons."

Yuri, carefully maneuvering the mace around, swings at the needles. Mostly, he misses, hitting his backpack instead and sailing it down the corridor.

The needles sink back down into the floor.

Yuri says, "Shceiss. Oh, well. Step carefully, everyone, I guess we'll send some bricklayers out later for this one."

Starguard nods. "No need to tempt fate if we don't have to."

Yuri says, "Fate has no willpower. He has no resistance to temptation."

Yuri continues to check the walls and recovers his pack when the come to it.

Starguard follows, careful to step in the footprints. "Hey guys, we're kicking up dust. Getting hard to note where the trap is. Anyone got chalk or something to mark them off?

Andreth squints at the floor. "Yeah, we're /really/ muddling the tracks."

Andreth retrieves his rocks from the pressure plate before we move on.

Yuri hmms, and checks his pockets.

Ash frowns. "I'll go back and see if I can scoop up some pebbles or something. I doubt there'll be much else we can use for markers."

Yuri says, "I think that's the best we can do under the circumstances."

Starguard shrugs. "Maybe I can scratch something into the wall with my steel..."

Tilara says, "Just leave the rocks there."

Andreth nods, putting one of the rocks back as a marker. "I think we better tell them upstairs to still not come down here till we come back to make a permanent job of it."

Yuri continues searching the corridor, as the others make the marker.

Twenty steps past the last needle mark, the corridor is swept clean of dust. Yuri stops again, looking carefully at the floor. "I think I **remember** this bit." The bench is still lying on the floor of the passage.

Andreth sets down a second rock at the end of the mesh as he reaches it.

Starguard nods. "Or to build their wall right before the trap.

Yuri hmms.

Yuri says, "I wonder if some bricklayers could fix this one, too."

Yuri leads the party across the bench. "I don't think we can fix this one now, either. And we haven't found anywhere that dagger might be hidden. I'm getting worried.

Tilara says, "That's more likely to be in his rooms than out here in the corridor. We've only just started."

Andreth says, "Or maybe some hidden room."

Yuri says, "Well, we would have seen any hidden rooms by now..."

Another twenty steps, sixteen of them on dusty tunnel, brings the party to the first T-intersection. The footsteps - all of them - lead left, while the tunnel also extends right.

Starguard nods. "Hand me back my mace, by the way, Yuri? The rats down here are huge...

Yuri sheepishly returns the mace to Starguard.

Yuri says, "Wanna check the left fork?"

Tilara says, "Been there. What about the right?"

Yuri says, "We didn't search it very throughly."

Andreth nods.

Tilara looks at the dusty floor. "D'ya think Ferg could have gone down that way and.. I dunno... redusted the floor somehow?"

Starguard shakes his head. "Unlikely."

Yuri says, "I think Ferg was a supernaturally sneaky bastard."

Yuri says, "I wouldn't really put it past him to have something hidden down here."

Looking more closely, Yuri does see a slithery line, almost as if something long and stringy was dragged through the dust.

Yuri says, "Can we just give it a quick check? If nothing else, we should make sure there's no serious traps."

Yuri points out that markings on the floor. "It's a pretty good bet that Ferg himself checked it out at least once. I'd like to find what he found.

Starguard says, "Alright. Lead the way, then. Careful."

Yuri leads on down the passage, giving the walls, floor, and ceiling the same careful inspection.

Slowly moving down the right hand fork, Yuri spots something shift, right at the edge of ... as he takes another step forwards, he sees a rock fall, where the tunnel appears to have collapsed. And part of it is moving.

Yuri motions everyone to a stop, and then points out the motion on the rockfall.

Yuri murmurs to the others, "Uh... do we kill it?"

Yuri says, "Or do we salute it and call it 'sir'?"

Starguard says, "I suppose we better. Can't have something that big around farming. Can you imagine the grain that sucker would eat?"

Andreth puts a bullet in his sling, but just watches for the moment.

Yuri looks over at Ash, to see if he's got any objections.

Ash shrugs and waves ahead. "I'll support your decision," he hisses.

Yuri shrugs, and turns to the rat, wondering if he should formally declare war on it, and decides to just motion Andreth to sling at it.

Yuri blinks at the rat. "I... think you killed it."

Starguard raises his crossbow and shoots the rat in the body, watching it flop as the bolt tears into it.

Tilara says, "Good."

Blood drips artistically down the rockfall, pooling in a little puddle at the base.

Yuri says, "I guess I just didn't expect it to be that easy."

Yuri stalks forward to check out the corridor and the rockfall.

Starguard says, "Rats...well, in good hands, this is a better mousetrap."

The rest of the corridor looks unmarked. No traps, no hidden doors, no secret passages, just a large pile of rock and mud and wood, filling almost the entire tunnel. And a dead rat, still half stuck in the rockfall. With bolt.

Yuri pulls out the bolt and the rat and checks to see what it was digging at.

Starguard hmms. "Would Mirra like this big guy?" he asks Tilara.

Tilara says, "Not enough to warrant carrying it and it's fleas back to the farmhouse, no."

Starguard says, "Alright. The other passage, then?"

Yuri says, "Yeah. Here's your bolt back, by the way. Watch the blood."

Yuri leads teh way down the other passage.

Yuri keeps checking the corridor for traps. "One pincushion, one pit, one large rat... not great if you're a farmer, but nothing spectacular. I wonder how much it costs to have a set of tunnels dug.

The other fork is the same featureless dusty tunnel you had seen before. You walk down it slowly, checking in the dust, before finally reaching a Y-shaped intersection. To the left, you can clearly see another rockfall, less that 20 steps in. And no footsteps, either. To the right are the rooms you found Ferg and Kiel in.

Starguard hmms, ears perking. "Wonder what's behind the rock?"

Yuri says, "Anybody else hear that? Water..."

Andreth hmms quietly, looking contemplatively at the rockfall.

Tilara nods. "Have to work our way through them at some point. For now... I doubt the dagger is back there."

Starguard nods. "Seems unlikely."

Yuri says, "Anybody mind if I take a quick look?"

Andreth breaks from his reverie. "Yeah. Don't think Ferg'd want to clear all that rock if he needed the thing."

Yuri says, "Maybe not all the rock... maybe just one or two..."

Yuri checks over the rock fall and the corridor, especially for loose stones and the like.

There are a lot of loose rocks in the rock fall. Most of them, in fact. But, looking closer, Yuri notices that most of them look completely undisturbed.

Yuri sighs. "Well, that just leave's Ferg's other bedroom, Kiel's cell, and... that well.

Starguard says, "Right. That's impassible. The hallway?"

Tilara says, "And whatever's down there. Let's continue, then."

Yuri says, "Oh, someone remind me to tell the farmers about the hot spring. That's a rare benefit in the country."

Yuri says, "Yeah, the hallway. We can be reasonably sure there are no traps here or we would have sprung them when we were fighting. So everyone feel free to check the walls for hidden panels and the like."

Ash feels around warily.

Tilara says, "You told them, didn't you, Ash?"

Starguard says, "Mmm. Good point. A little resting spot there might be more profitable than a farm, actually."

Yuri says, "I'll check out Ferg's room myself, since that's where I'd do the sneaky stuff if it were me."

Ash coughs. "Hrm... uh.... well...."

Tilara says, "We'll do it when we get back upstairs, then."

Yuri says, "It's not a big deal if you forgot, Ash. They've only been here a week."

Yuri smiles. "And it's not like it occurred to any of us either."

Here, too, the hallway yields nothing of interest. Dust, splinters, the occasional drop of blood from that long ago battle, but no secrets, hidden or otherwise. Reaching Ferg's room, the party halts again. Inside, the room is as destroyed as ever, with the bed splintered, and blood spattered everywhere.

Ash rubs the back of his head nervously. "I uh, was thinking about other things. I got into a .... phase."

Ash says, "You uh... you can be sure that Ferg would keep his best stuff closest to him. So be careful."

Yuri looks over at Ash, somewhat concerned, then continues. _I wish I knew how to help him..._

Yuri grumbles. "I'm guessing his 'best stuff' would also mean his best traps. Just how big a bastard IS he? And what's his excuse?"

Yuri blinks. "Tilara? I found something unusual. It looks like it might involve those feathers we found. Wanna have a look?"

Starguard says, "I think his treatment of Kiel tells you of his character, Yuri. Be \_very\_ careful. As for his excuse..." The Brother shrugs."

Tilara says, "There _is_ no excuse for what he did to Kiel. That was one of his _allies_."

Yuri says, "Well, I don't like to believe that anyone is predestined to be evil. Not among mortals, anyway, though I gather it's always happening to gods and the like."

Starguard nods. "He's as evil a man as I've seen."

Tilara says, "Hmmm. Weird. Might be something to do with that poison gas we got hit with, you think?"

Yuri shows Tilara the brazier. "It's very clever. It's hidden in a small pit under the bed, under a flush paving stone. It looks like he was burning something in here - coal or wood - and see, half of the feather is left.

Yuri compares the feather to the feathers in the magic bag, to see if they're the same type.

Yuri says, "Same type of feather as these... any idea what it might be, before I try to lift it?"

Tilara hmmms, thinking about it. "Don't know how likely this is - teleportation's a pretty powerful bit of magic - but this sort of thing is how teleportal destinations are marked."

Starguard nods. "Yeah. I remember something like that from the army mages..."

Tilara says, "Burn them to release the energy, mark the destination."

Starguard says, "Perhaps we should bring it with us, and then burn a feather in a jail cell?"

Yuri says, "Are you serious? Isn't that a bit out of Ferg's league? If he could do that kind of magic we'd never have been able to take him."

Andreth rubs his chin. "Ferg cain't have been that powerful hisself. If Til's right, Ferg musta been working wi' someone."

Starguard says, "Seems like a pretty good scenario to me..."

Yuri says, "Who'd know more about this kind of magic? And can we... uh... disrupt the marker? I don't want Ferg escaping."

Andreth says, "Or anyone worse comin' in."

Tilara says, "I think this one is dead. And we've got his other feathers, so I don't think he can 'port out of the army."

Ash says, "Oh! The Brothers of the Waters, and their library. They've been acquiring widely."

Yuri says, "I've heard of them, too. A few days' travel inland, not all that far."

Starguard hmms. "Brother Oak knows a lot as well. Perhaps he might know something."

Yuri says, "Well, let's finish up down here. If the dagger isn't in the cell or the well, then it's not down here. Ferg might have sent it to his... boss."

Tilara nods. "In the meantime, we seal up this place in case he can get back. Shall we check the well?"

Yuri says, "Which would be... Berina's competition."

Tilara says, "Probably."

Yuri says, "You go ahead and check the well, I just want to make sure there's nothing else in Kiel's cell."
