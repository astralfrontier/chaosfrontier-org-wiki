Game Log: Chapter 16 - New Plans


------------------------------------

The party stands in the door of Ferg's room, where Yuri has found the brazier, with half a charred feather inside it. The tunnels are dead-quiet, with the exception of the party.

Starguard says, "Anything else there, Yuri? Or should we move on?""

Tilara says, "Either take that brazier with us, or put it somewhere that's sealed up. Don't want Ferg or his friends popping back in on the poor farmers."

Yuri hmms.

Yuri says, "Does anyone know anything about how this kind of magic works? I didn't even know you could do that kind of thing."

Starguard frowns. "They might be able to track us with it...maybe. I'm not really sure."

Yuri hmms.

Yuri says, "Well, we should probably take it with us anyway."

Yuri says, "If it's that powerful, we shouldn't just leave it out in the open like this. Where can we take things like this? Who can take care of dangerous magic?"

Starguard says, "Although I think only if we activate it. It should be safe. I think."

Starguard says, "It's not really dangerous if you only carry it..."

Yuri nods, and rummages around in his pack for a sack or bag or something to put the brazier in.

Yuri says, "If this is some kind of anchor, then perhaps we can use it to find Ferg's master. Most anchors have a ship at the other end of the chain."

Tilara says, "Possibly... but I'm not sure I want to have Ferg's boss land on us right now."

Yuri sighs. "Well, didn't someone mention a monastery or something?"

Starguard says, "Bring it with us. There's the rest of the tunnels to check out, then we can ask Brother Oak and Father Pesci about it in town."

Yuri says, "I'm sure they're better for handling this than us."

Yuri says, "Well, I'll go and search the other rooms. I think we've found all we're going to find in this one."

Yuri wraps up the brazier in a spare cheap shirt, and puts it at the bottom of his pack.

Yuri steps out of the room, and looks both ways down the tunnel. It's still quiet, and it's still dark, and it's still rather chilly. Then he turns to his left, heading down the tunnel. The door to Kiel's former cell is still standing open, as it was left all those days ago. He checks the doorway carefully, before stepping inside to check every inch of the cell. At the end of it he reaches two conclusions: he would really like to go visit the hot spring now, and except for these three tarnished silver pieces the cell only contains straw, filth, and manacles.

Tilara says, "Shall we check the well, then? This is a mess... let's close the door, though, to keep the rats in."

Yuri says, "Well, that was less than exciting. Yes, let's check the well."

Yuri gives the three silver to Starguard. "Here. A donation.

Starguard smiles. "I will give it to Father Pesci."

Andreth smiles lopsidedly. "Lucky him."

Yuri says, "I'm not really that good with wells, friends. Would someone better at sticking to walls than me, like to give it a try?"

Tilara grins. "You sure you don't want to try a spider?"

Yuri says, "Maybe someday. I don't really want to be involved in magic I don't understand, especially if it involves eating spiders. Unless we're allowed to stew them first, or something."

Starguard says, "I think any of us could do it, with Tilara's spell. Perhaps Andreth? I'm a bit too old for climbing down wells."

The party moves further down the tunnel. After about one hundred and thirty steps, the tunnel widens into a mostly round room, with an obvious hold in the middle. The room, perhaps three times the width of the tunnel, is empty.

Andreth looks down the well. "That looks awfully deep. D'you suppose the spell'll last long enough?"

Yuri says, "Someone remind me, when we get back to town, to buy a bunch of stuff at the dry goods store. Including spikes, rope, blankets, sacks, candles, and flints."

Yuri looks around for a rock to drop down the hole, and listens for the return echo.

Tilara says, "A very good idea. I can't get everyone to stick to the walls yet, and if I could I'd be out of spells for later. I'll go down for a few minutes, and if I don't reach the bottom, I'll come back up before it wears off."

Yuri nods to Tilara. "OK. Just be careful, and don't cut it too close.

The falling rock appears to bounce several times, before disappearing into the depths. After about five long seconds, there's a final thud, then silence.

The thud sounds moist.

Yuri frowns. "That's... deep."

Starguard nods. "Is it really worth going down? It's not like anything could come up it...

Yuri looks over at Tilara. "I think this one's up to you. If you're not going down, it's probably time to go back upstairs."

Tilara says, "That's deep, all right. I'll check to see if there are any side passages in reach, okay?" She's already rummaging through her pouch to find a spider. "Won't be long.""

Yuri makes a long search around the well room while Tilara is climbing.

Tilara takes out the spider, swallows it whole, and crouches down, swinging herself into the hole. As she moves down, she notices the sides of the well are uneven, and poorly finished. Quite jagged, in some places. And after moving for about half a minute she finds a ledge. It's empty, and about 2 feet deep. Just wide enough to stand on and pause for a moment. Shrugging, she moves a little deeper. There's still no exits, although now the ledges are spaced more regularly.

Yuri says, "I'm thinking that maybe we should just tell the farmers to nail the trapdoor shut and forget this is down here. I don't really see how we can make it safe for occupation without a lot of work."

Meanwhile Yuri searches the room carefully, looking for any sign of secrets. He finds a lot of dust, some bat guano, and the newly minted footprints from his partners.

Starguard says, "Just a solid wall just before the pit trap. Give them a nice cool cellar."

Tilara reports her progress as she goes, talking to the rest as she explores. "I'm down maybe a third of the way, and still no sign of side passages. Can you still see my lantern up there?"

Yuri says, "Hey, Ash... how did you end up in Ferg's employ, anyway?"

Starguard yells down. "Yes! I can see something blocking it at the edges, though!"

Yuri says, "He doesn't really seem like your kind of person. It sounds like 'there hangs a tale'."

Ash leans back slowly, gathering his thoughts.

Tilara calls back, "That'll be the ledge. I'll go a bit deeper, but it looks like there's nothing down here but a dry well."

Starguard says, "I don't think it's just a well! A well wouldn't have ledges to catch the lowered bucket!"

Ash says, "Well... here I came, traveling the roads as a bravo, just recently having completed a sort of apprenticeship with the Duke of a particular wine bottle - it was his, y'see, and he ruled over it with an iron fist - there was a bit of a misunderstanding.."

As Tilara moves deeper, the ledges continue unabated. Some have crumbled edges, and here and there she can see brown spots on the side of the hole. Looking down, she can see more of the same, going all the way down. The smell is getting more noticeable too, now; the smell of rot is beginning to clog Tilara's nose.

Ash says, "It concerned a passenger of the caravan, who had in his possession a set of jewels for some nobleman's wife. Or niece. Or both, I'm not sure. Anyway, he had a break-in one night, and expected us - the caravan guards - to somehow track down the culprit. Of course the caravan master told us no, we were moving out and that the man could hire his own henchmen for that. Well, he did - paid a few of my fellow guards handsomely, double the caravan's own fee. The master fired us all en masse when he found out."

Tilara sniffs as the odor gets stronger. _This isn't good._ "It's getting very rank down here. I'm coming back up now. Maybe Ferg threw his victims down there or something."

Ash shrugs. "Then he hired on a group of unsavory characters out of the town we were encamped near - probably the thugs what stole the jewels in the first place. It was about then I concluded banditry was the way to go. Of course, I acted rashly."

Yuri says, "Well, I don't really think that people should be penalized for a hasty decision if it does no harm."

Yuri hmms.

Ash says, "So as I'm sure you can guess, I see a lot of irony in Ferg's situation."

Yuri says, "Yeah. And in ours. I'm about to try and convince some other caravan master to hire a bunch of unsavory characters from town as guards. I hope I'm not making a mistake here."

Yuri says, "So you've probably seen a lot more of the world than most of us."

Tilara climbs carefully back up out of the hole and slips her boots back on. "No side passages at all, and I'm not sure the air would have been good all the way down. Smelled like Ferg used the hole to dump dead bodies down, or maybe the rats have a nest down there." She pauses, thinking about that. "Or both."

Ash says, "I wouldn't say more... just different parts."

Starguard shrugs. "Honest work, more often than not, pays more consistently, and has better meals. And you don't have to watch your back as much. Nothing really then, 'Lara? If they could fix the traps, it would make an alright cellar, actually.

Tilara says, "Or just seal it up before you get to the traps. You'd want to keep the rats out, after all."

Yuri says, "I get the feeling that this whole place was part of something much larger."

Yuri says, "Just look around. Who knows what's on the other side of those rockfalls? And this well might be natural, but it was also finished to a purpose. Someone meant for this place to be used."

Tilara nods. "But the tunnels are falling in. It's been a long time..."

Yuri says, "But I guess that will have to wait for later. Does anyone object to just telling the farmers that there's nothing down here, but they best stay out to avoid falling in any holes?"

Andreth says, "Maybe even seal up the tunnel before the first fork. Never know if there're other ways in, and they might clear out the rockfalls from the other side."

Starguard says, "I'd suggest marking the beginning of the needle trap with stones, and suggest that, when they can quarry the stone and pay a mason, that they make a nice tight wall and cellar."

Starguard...there.

Tilara says, "Sounds reasonable to me."

Yuri says, "OK. Let's go back, then."

The party carefully retrace their step, balancing on the bench across the pit trap, and then stepping carefully to avoid the needle trap, marked as it is by rocks on each side. Reaching the ladder, they carefully climb back up, only to find Jen sitting in a chair, knitting busily. "Perl one, knit too, perl one, knit too, skip skip, knit 5 ..." she mutters, counting as she slowly makes the stitches.

Yuri slips up the ladder first, making enough noise to announce his presence. "Umm... hello, Jen. We're back."

Yuri helps his comrades up from the ladder.

Jen looks up, dropping two stitches in the process. She looks back down at her knitting, sighs, and carefully rethreads the stitches. "Yuri; I'm so glad you're back. How did it go?"

Starguard chuckles. "Only one rat down there. Didn't even bag our limit."

Jen looks relieved. "So it's safe? We don't have to sleep with rocks under the bed anymore?

Yuri says, "It's pretty empty. Not much in the way of beasts or booty. However, I'd stay out of there as much as possible, and maybe get someone to brick up the passage when you can. There's a few nasty traps and you could easily break a leg in a few places."

Yuri says, "Breaking a leg underground is a very bad idea."

Yuri says, "I think those passages are as safe as the roads on an average day, but I still wouldn't use them too much. There's a nasty gadget built into the floor just a few dozen feet in, that the former occupant seems to have poisoned."

Jen nods. "We won't go down there, then. We really don't need the room yet, in any case."

Yuri says, "And a pit, a bit further on. We've marked both of them - the poisoned needle trap is marked with stones, and the pit with a large bench that we used as a bridge."

Yuri says, "I'd just nail it shut for now. It's clear that these tunnels served a different purpose a long time ago, but now, who knows? And to think it was so close to town..."

Tilara pops up from the hole. "It'll make a nice root cellar once you seal it off, but until then I'd leave it alone. I doubt that we got all the rats."

Yuri says, "Anyway, I've been told that nobody's shown you the springs yet. I could do with a bath, so I'll show them to someone if you wish."

Jen looks entranced. "There's a hot spring, here, as well? Oh my. I do wonder why the farm was abandoned."

Anna, hearing the voices, sticks her head in from where she was working in the kitchen. "Ah; you're back. So, we'll no be having a root cellar yet, then?"

Starguard smiles. "Not until you hire a mason to brick up a nice wall down there. But at least you'll have a hot spring.

Yuri says, "Umm... I don't want to impose, but I feel quite filthy. If you'll excuse me, I'm off to the springs."

Anna nods. "That'll be good; come winter the well water's going to be cold to be washing up in. So; why don't you show Jen the springs? I'm thinking you'd like to visit them now."

Jen nods eagerly. "I'd love to visit the springs too. It won't harm the baby, will it Father?"

Starguard smiles. "Brother, miss. And no, it should be good for both of you."

Jen smiles, blushing. "Yes, Brother. I'll go get some towels."

After a quick trek out to the hot springs, where everybody relaxes and soaks up the heat, the party escorts Jen back to the farmhouse. Brother Starguard examines her one last time, reminds her about the tea, and promises to pass on a report of her health to Father Pesci. Then the group step out, back to town. The tempo is high since it's already nearing noon, and Woolwich is still a few hours away. Far enough, that the sky is dark by the time they reach home. Father Pesci, however, is still awake, sitting at his desk, working on some herbal concoction.

Father Pesci looks up. "Don't wake Stormy; he's finally asleep. That boy can wear a man out in no time. How is Jen, you young swot?"

Yuri sits quietly in a pew, looking thoughtful.

Starguard says, "She's doing well Father. Needed some fresh air, and some good food, but well. Still, it's worrisome to be a day away from help."

Father Pesci nods. "Well, farmers lasses have been having children for longer than I can remember, and most farms are a fair way from town.

Yuri says, "Father Pesci... we found something interesting down that hole. We're hoping you might know more about it."

Father Pesci looks down at the mortar he's holding, then lays it gently in the pestle. "Oh?"

Yuri says, "Yes." Yuri fishes out the brazier and unwraps it carefully on a bench."

Father Pesci looks carefully at the brazier. "Looks perfectly plain to me. You can get these for a silver penny aty the market; they're a good way to heat food without a fireplace."

Yuri says, "We found this under a paving stone in Ferg's bedroom. We're not sure what it is, but it had the burned remains of a feather in it. Some of the others think it may be a magic anchor of some sort for travel spells."

Starguard says, "Do you know anything about it, Father? It was used to burn the feathers, and we were thinking it might be used in conjunction with a teleportation spell."

Father Pesci raises an eyebrow. "It doesn't feel particularly magical. How ... odd. No; I can't say I recognize it."

Yuri says, "Who might know more? We're worried that Ferg may have been working for someone more dangerous. I don't think he's capable of doing that sort of thing himself or he would have flattened us when we fought him."

Starguard says, "There's a few valuable pieces missing from the stolen items too, and there's no trace of them."

Tilara says, "And Ferg's not talking."

Yuri says, "Well... we haven't actually asked him. But I don't think he's going to help."

Father Pesci hmmms, pausing, and taking up the brazier again. "Know more? I'm not the most educated man in matters of magic; Brother Oak has seen far more than I. And there's always politics afoot, particularly with the birth of little Potapka. Citadel was stormy when I left. And that was before the emperor married Lady Marilan."

Yuri sighs. "Well, what of the caravan? It's late. I have a bad feeling that more trouble is afoot."

Tilara nods. "Should we head out that way, and see if we can find it?"

Yuri says, "I dunno. What about Big Joe? A big part of my plan is getting them out of town."

"The caravan? It's running late, but it left Red River Town a few days ago. It's still expected to arrive tomorrow.

Tilara shrugs. "So if it's there, we can come back with it. If not, we'll know soonest."

Father Pesci nods. "Well, Joe should have a job by tomorrow. Rumor has it that the current caravan suffered from some sickness, and was delayed for a fwe days, close by Agla's Harbour."

Starguard ahs. "So let's sleep well tonight. We all need our rest."

Andreth says, "Yeah." He grins. "We c'n panic tomorrow if it don't show up."

Father Pesci nods once more. "Tomorrow night, mind you. They're not due till late afternoon. Plenty of time to rest."

Yuri says, "Andreth, would you talk to Brother Oak about the brazier? He might know more. And if you would, ask him about the Brothers of the Waters, and if they'd know more about it."

Andreth nods to Yuri. "Yeah."

Ash will room at the Old Goat, asking about for a few hours of training in the sword - you can never be too good.

The party disperses, each to find a place to lay his - or her - head. Ash goes to the Old Goat, to join Big Joe and Jonesie and the lads, who have all gained more bruises in their vigorous practice sessions. Big Joe is happy to see Ash. "You tell Yuri we're all set to be hired tomorrow; we've licked the lads into shape, and worked in the weapons. And attacking more strongly? Sure, we can have a go at it on the mats tomorrow." Yuri rerents his old room, sharing it with Tilara, and Andreth, while Starguard stays with Father Pesci. That way he can tell Father Pesci all about Jen's prognosis.

In the morning, Big Joe wakes Ash up. "Well, we'll train for a bit before breakfast. Puts a better edge on things. Here; try this wooden sword, and we'll see what we can do." Big Joe strikes out at Ash, dancing around him in the loosely marked practice circle. "So; you're not joining us? Were you a stoolie all along?"

Ash parries and feints and practices in the training circle.

Big Joe hears someone coming in the front door. "Hey Jonesie; go check out the visitor!" Jonesie smirks, and saunters over, standing in the doorway. "Well, hello, Yuri. Come to check up on your chicks?"

Tilara takes the opportunity to sleep in, but finally wakes up mid-morning and decides to visit Stormy again. He's been improving, but Father Pesci's vegetables would probably never be the same...

Yuri grins. "Something like that. You've probably heard that the caravan was delayed. I see you've been making good use of the time."

Yuri says, "I've arranged for Jane to give you the leather armor and the short spears when the caravan gets here, so that you won't be going out on the road unprepared."

Reaching out, Big Joe taps Ash near the hilt of his sword. "Nice. Now; when you want to focus your attack, you need to concentrate. Concentrate hard, see, and use all your knowledge to put force behind your blade."

Andreth gets a good solid night's rest, then heads over to the Mother's Oak to visit his teacher, bringing the brazier and a head full of questions.

Yuri waits for a lull in the fighting to ask Big Joe about Ferg.

Ash nods, "Right.." Taking a few practice swings, he still lags a few seconds behind in the initial downswing.

Jonesie nods, once. "Good. These wooden sticks make poor equipment. But morale is still high. Jane has been sending food, so we don't starve."

Big Joe nods at Ash. "Yes; just like that. Only speed it up. Here, try again." The sparring continues for about a half hour, before Big Joe steps back. "Why don't you go get us breakfast, and we can continue after that.

Ash runs off to fetch breakfast for the gang of miscreants.

Starguard is out in the back with Stormy, dueling with birch sticks. Just some basic patterns from the army training, that breaks off as Tilara comes out. "Ah! 'Lara!"

Stormy notices Tilara. "Lady! We ... I ... uh ... "

Yuri shakes his head. _There's more to him than an errand boy._

Brother Oak is in his garden, lovingly tending the Mother Oak, when he notices Andreth come in. "Wll, lad?"

Yuri says, "Joe... We found something in Ferg's bedroom in the tunnels. I was hoping you'd know something about it."

Joe ambles over. "Oh? What'd you find?"

Yuri says, "He'd hidden a brazier under a paving stone. There was a burned feather in it. But he wasn't any kind of magician, so we don't know where it could have come from."

Big Joe looks blank. "How odd. Nah; I dunno bout it."

Yuri says, in a low tone, "I think he was working for someone else, and I think he was playing us for worse saps than we thought."

Stormy looks at his birch stick, and then at Tilara, and then at his stick, and he blushes. "Lady ... can I ... uh ... would you ... we have lots of water!"

Andreth bows, and pulls forth the brazier. He isn't one for small talk. "We was exploring Ferg's tunnels yesterday, and Yuri found this. Tilara thought it was part o' some kind of..." He pauses to try to remember the word.

Starguard chuckles. "I think the student is eager, TIlara."

Tilara waves at Stormy, then chuckles. "Still having control troubles, are you? Sure, we can work on things." _Y'know, I'm beginning to wonder if I'm not the right person to teach him. The Art is about **discipline**, and he surely does act like I'm distracting him._

Brother Oak sits on his heels, waiting for Andreth to finish, as he looks at the brazier.

Stormy shakes his head. "No, Lady! I meant ... uh ... would you .... uh ... like a drink? I can fetch food, too! Father Pesci gave me coins!"

Tilara blinks, then grins. "Stormy... are you asking me out for lunch?"

Andreth says, "...tel...e...por...tation magic. There was a bit o' burned feather inside. Know anythin' about this sort o' thing?"

Big Joe bites on his lower lip, then shrugs. "Ferg treated us fine. Well, mebbe not Stormy, but that kid had it coming. Kiel, too, the stoolie. I dunno if he was working for someone else, he seemed to know just fine what he wanted."

Brother Oak gestures. "Sit, lad, and put the brazier down, so we can have a look at it." After the brazier is put down on the ground, he examines it critically. "Burned feather, inside? Have you found any more of those feathers?"

Stormy nods his head vigorously. "If youwould ... ummmm ... care to, Lady? Father Pesci says that courting is done easiest over a plate of good food! And ... um ...." Suddenly realizing what he's said, Stormy turns beet red, and then runs inside.

Yuri says to Big Joe, "Well, you were working for him, and I think he was working for someone else. I just thought you'd want to know, because I know that I don't like to do anyone's dirty work but my own."

Andreth sits down. "Yeah. Ferg had a couple of 'em in a sack. I think Yuri's got 'em right now. Tilara said they had some magic on 'em when we found 'em. The feathers, I mean."

Yuri nods, and sighs. "Yes, late caravan is worrying a lot of people."

"Thanks, sir. We appreciate the heads up. But if we can find good work in the next day or two ... the lack of coin is beginning to be distracting." Big Joe spreads his hands out. "Ah; Ash! I see you've brought breakfast. Lads! Time to break your fasts!"

Starguard sighs. "You shouldn't tease the poor boy so. I remember my first crush."

Ash dishes out.

Tilara keeps a straight face as Stormy blurts out his intentions, then turns and looks ruefully at Starguard when the boy runs back inside. "Oh, my. He's smitten, isn't he."

Brother Oak gently touches the brazier. "It looks new. Barely used, in fact. I don't think it's been lit more than a few times. Made by Gerrolds', you can see the mark here on the bottom. It's one of their finer plain pieces. But how it would be used .... hmmm."

Yuri says, "Well, Joe, I'll buy the groceries for now. You shouldn't get stuck on short rations because the caravan's late."

The other future caravan guards file downstairs, clustering around Ash as he distributes his loot. Shortly thereafter, the men are all chewing industriously.

Starguard nods. "You'll have to let him down gently, dear. He's just a young lad.

Big Joe nods. "That's appreciated, sir. Though we'll likely be off your hands tonight."

Yuri murmurs to Joe, "Just stay out of trouble and watch your back. And remember my name if you come back this way, maybe we can do business again."

Big Joe nods once, and then offers a hunk of cheese. "Break your fast with us? Ash is learning more about fighting well."

Andreth nods. "Tilara figured, what you do is, you burn one of the feathers in it and you go somewhere else." He rubs his chin. "But that kinda magic is really powerful stuff, right? Ferg didn't have anythin' like that hisself or else he'd have wiped the floor with us..."

Father Pesci can be heard yelling from inside. "Starguard! Bring water!"

Yuri nods, and eats quietly with the rest of the company.

Starguard gahs, and grabs a handy bucket, running inside, looking for smoke or fire. "Where, Father!?"

Tilara winces at the shout, and runs to help. "Oh, not again..."

Brother Oak looks at the brazier again. "I doubt that it worked quite in that manner, Andreth. The brazier would bend if you stood on it. And surely Tilara would have been able to discern that kind of magic? Moving a living being takes a great deal of power."

There's smoke in the front room, where one of the pews is blazing merrily. Stormy, crying, is beating at the flames with his hands.

Starguard throws the water onto the flames, dousing much of it, cursing as he looks for another bucket.

Andreth says, "So... maybe it's for movin' small stuff, then? Or maybe it's for something else?" Being in Brother Oak's presence is reminding him to focus a little harder on his diction."

Stormy sees the flashing water, looks up, and then dashes into the yard to get the bucket of sand, dumping that over the last of the flames.

"Yes, Andreth. Something small. And are you certain the object came to the feather, and not from it? There's a light scratch here." Brother Oak points at the side of the bowl, on the inside.

Having finished his fast, Big Joe stands up. "Right, Ash, you practice with Kearney. He's learning too."

Starguard sighs as the pew is put out. "Stormy! What happened?"

Yuri finishes eating and leaves the Old Goat to walk around town and clear his head. _Late caravan... I won't feel better until it's here._

Ash gets back to practicing.

Stormy shakes his head. "I don't know! I just touched it! And ... " His face is now beet red, his lips beginning to visibly dry out. Father Pesci bustles in, and throws a bucket of water over him, too. "I'm sorry, Tilara. I hadn't realized how far advanced this was."

Starguard shakes his head. "I think we've imposed on you enough, Father. I think Stormy needs somewhere wide open and wet for a while.

Tilara gives the good father a _very_ brief glare, then goes back to trying to calm the overwrought boy. "Stormy, are you all right?"

Andreth hmms at the scratch. "So... there was this dagger we was- _were_ told to look for in Ferg's loot, but we didn't find it. So maybe Ferg already sent it away?"

Stormy, soaked, begins to steam. He looks completely bedraggled. "I didn't mean to! Honest! I just ... it .. ummm ... I'm all right, Lady. Just a little ..." he waves at the steam " a little steamed up, I guess. I'm sorry, Lady. I didn't mean to ... uh ... ummm ..."

Brother Oak nods. "A reasonable conclusion, Andreth. You're learning a lot."

Andreth smiles. "Thanks..." He stares at the brazier some more. "Hmm..."

Andreth says, "D'you figure it's one way only? I'd hate for someone to make a poison gas bomb suddenly appear while we was sleeping..."

Brother Oak touches the brazier. "I'd say it's two ways, lad, but you need to be burning a beacon either way."

Andreth breathes a small sigh of relief. "So it won't work unless _we_ burn a feather too?"

Tilara waits until Starguard leads Stormy out of the temple to clean up, and then turns and grins at the senior cleric. "Father Pesci.. could you teach Stormy about, umm, you know... what boys do when they're, umm, overwrought like he is? I think he doesn't know..."

Father Pesci nods. "We're going to have a nice long talk, after he stops steaming. I'm sorry, Tilara. I hadn't realized how ... how young he was. My apologies."

Brother Oak looks at the brazier intently. "I think so, Andreth. But I don't use these magics, so I can not offer you perfect assurance."

Starguard sighs. "You're going to have to tell him you think of him like a little brother, Lara. Assuming you do, of course.

Andreth nods. "Ash said something about the Brothers of the Waters and their library. D'you think we could find out more there?"

Brother Oak nods. "Yes. They would know more. Take care as you travel, though, the wolves in that area are hunting men this year."

Andreth nods, and bows. "Thank you, Brother Oak."

Tilara nods. "Well, more of a teacher-student relationship, but yes. I'll try to let him down gently."

Father Pesci sighs. "I think I'd better let him down gently first, Tilara. I hadn't realized he would go off like a hot firecracker."

Brother Oak stands up. "My pleasure, Andreth. Good seeking."

Around the supper hour, there's a commotion in the center of town. Even in the Middens, there's a sense of expectation, as people spread the word that the caravan has finally arrived. Yuri picks up Big Joe and brings them to the caravanserai where he dickers for a contract. After terms have been sealed, and hands shaken, Yuri is paid for his efforts, and in turn he hands over a tenth of the contract to the caravanseri master. That still leaves him with a handful of gold, which he pockets. Waving a last goodbye, he leaves Big Joe and the gang to be inducted into the caravan serai, where they are soon put to work.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party has spent time at the market, doing a little judicious shopping.

The party gathers again, at the temple, which is emptier with father Pesci and Stormy gone to visit Broth Oak.

Starguard organizes the goods and packs, trying to make things fair. He sets things up with a near-military precision, delivering not-quite-orders as he sets things up as he remembers the army did.

Tilara says, "_One_ problem solved. What about Berina and that blasted dagger?"

Andreth holds up the brazier, pointing out the scratch in the bowl. "Brother Oak figures this thing's only good for small stuff. Ferg prob'ly already sent it away."

Yuri says, "I think the dagger is gone. I'm sure that it and Berina will both come back to haunt us."

Yuri says, "Shall we be on our way?"

Starguard tightens straps and buckles. "Let's. It's a long way to go."

Yuri gives a small note to Father Pesci, addresses to his family care of his mother. Yuri explains in low tones, "This is a short account of what we've done and where we're going. So that they know. Someday I'll have to settle with my father. Maybe it will be better if he knows what we're up to."

Tilara sighs. "And it probably won't be a good thing when it does happen. I wish we knew what that dagger was supposed to be able to do."

Andreth observes, somewhat gloomily, "I 'spect we'll find out sooner or later."

Starguard says, "We could ask about that, too..."

Yuri says, "We should ask Jane about a better description. Maybe a sketch."

Yuri says, "We can do that on the way out of town."

Tilara nods. "Jane should be able to give us that. I think she's a better bet than Berina, at least. If that one is even still in town.

After dropping by Jane's for a more detailed description of the dagger, including a quick sketch, the party retires for the night. Form the sketch, it is obvious that the dagger is ornamented by more than merely a green stone; the stone itself is carved with a pine cone, while there are symbols etched in the blade.

Come the morning, the party sets out bright and chipper. It's a long day's walk up the road, with several more days to come. The day passes quickly, and reasonably uneventfully, with only a passing thunderstorm to spoil the mood.

Yuri has a spring in his step as the company marches. "I'm happy to be getting out of town again. I thought I'd be spending the rest of my life in front of a loom. Or getting run through by Ferg. One long and boring, the other short and terrifying."

Yuri says, "The only thing that could ruin my mood now would be if some inept bandits forced us to kill them."

Starguard chuckles. "It's a week's walk, Yuri. Long and boring comes to mind. Beats the other, though.

Andreth says, "With any luck, the bandits'll be fighting each other f'r a while."

Tilara says, "Let's hope so. I'm not going to trust to luck on that, though, all the same."

Yuri says, "Well, there's the other half of Ferg's gang."

Starguard moves back to beside Stormy. "How's it going, lad? Legs alright?"

Stormy nods, bouncing along happily. "I get to travel with the Lady. I can walk anywhere!"

Andreth grins. "Whatever happens, happens. No sense worrying about it till it does."

As the day passes, the party passes several possible campsites. In one of them they spy a few travelers, who have put up a tent and are sheltering from the rain. But by late afternoon the rain and thunder have all ceased. The road, on the other hand, seems to have emptied out too. And the trees are beginning to press closer. The closest thing to a campsite you find here is a small clearing, perhaps a hundred yards off the road. With a small sign indicating water further into the woods.

Ash keeps his hood up and says little.

Starguard stretches as they come into camp, walking beside Stormy. "Ah, to be twelve years old and walk miles without resting..." he says, chuckling at Stormy's obvious energy.

Stormy huhs. "I haven't been twelve in ages. I'm fifteen! Want some water? I can get it."

Tilara smiles at Stormy's exuberance, occasionally indulging in a little juggling as they move along - especially when it might distract someone they pass from looking too closely at Ash. "This makes much better time than a wagon pulled by an old horse." She pauses at Stormy's offer. "We're not in town, now. Better not to go anywhere alone.... just in case."

Starguard chuckles. "Oh to be fifteen again and have some experience to temper that energy." :)

Stormy bounces up and down. "Brother Oak says I'm going to gain experience. Brother Oak says that I'm too callow to court. Brother Oak says that if I learn discipline, I'll stop being callow. What's callow?"

As Andreth and Stormy head off to get water, the rest of the party makes camp. There's plenty of wood stacked up. Unfortunately it's all damp, and getting it to work is non-trivial task. Still, eventually the party manages to find enough dry dead wood to get the fire going, and after that the damp wood dries out soon enough.

With Stormy bouncing in the lead, the intrepid party of water carriers penetrates further into the wood, following a very small track. After a ten minute walk, sometimes sliding between trees, they reach a small spring, and fill the water bottles.

Andreth puts a hand on Stormy's shoulder. "Quiet," he murmurs, watching the bushes closely...

The bushes rustle and a large wolf steps out into the little spring clearing. He watches the two humans warily, while beside him several packmates step forward and lap from the water.

Ash paces about nervously.

Andreth takes Stormy's hand and slowly edges away from the pool, keeping an eye on the wolves. "Just stay calm. We'll come back when they're done..." he says to Stormy, hoping against hope that the lad doesn't do something stupid.

Stormy follows, completely quiet now. Not a single bounce. The wolf's gaze tracks Andreth and Stormy down the path, his lips lifted in an almost snarl.

The hair on Andreth's nape stands up straight, and he can feel the wolf padding along behind him for several minutes, following him back. At some point, though, the wolf is no longer there.

As you get closer to the camp, you smell...burnt food. And Starguard appears to be swearing in Lurinese.

Andreth returns to the party's clearing, sans water. "Some wolves decided they were thirsty."

Yuri says, "Wolves?"

Yuri says, "I guess watches are in order for tonight."

Stormy wanders over to inspect the pot. "What happened, Brother Starguard? Fire burned too hot?"

Yuri winces when Stormy mentions fire. _That kid knows a bit too much about incinerating things._

Starguard says, "Nah. Forgot about it while putting up the tent."

Starguard says, "You need to be careful and pay attention to what you're doing in all things."

Stormy nods. "We paid a lot of attention to the wolves. I'm hungry. May we eat?"

Starguard says, "You can try. It's going to be about half-charcoal, but there should be some good bits in there." He sighs."

Stormy nods, pulling out a bowl and spoon. "I'm starving! What is it?"

After a badly burnt barely recognizable meal, the party turns in. It's been a long day, and may well be a longer night.

Yuri's watch passes uneventfully. There's nothing to hear, over and above the usual rustlings. Andreth's watch similarly passes uneventfully.

But only an hour or so before dawn, Starguard hears some rustling in the surrounding forest. The sound of larger animals, passing by. The sound of larger animals ... running into the campsite?

Two of the wolves jump at Starguard, the first going for his throat, while the second is going for his hamstrings.
