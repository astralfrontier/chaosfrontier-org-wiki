Game Log: Chapter 18 - The Brothers of the Waters


-----------------------------------------------------

_

Brothers of the Waters  
The monastery - a walled enclave standing on a small hill in the middle of a cleared, grassy area - is surrounded by a moat. The drawbridge, currently, is up, and men appear to be patrolling the walls, armed with pikes or spears. Two banners bracket the great gate; one displaying the shield of Agla of the Waterfall, the other the shield of Muirwen the River God. The banners are about 20 feet long, and can easily be distinguished from a distance.

_

The party, perched on Gerrold's coach, pauses, as he gentles his horses to a stop at the meadow's edge.

Yuri murmurs to the others, "I didn't plan quite this far ahead. I'm not sure what we should do now. Anyone object to the direct approach?"

Ash shrugs helplessly. "The direct approach is all I know."

Starguard says, "I'd encourage the direct approach, for Andreth's sake."

Tilara nods. "Ask if they can help, and what the price will be. What else should we do?"

Yuri says, "Well... in negotiations, the idea is to convince the other guy that he really wants to give you what you want for as close to nothing as possible."

Yuri says, "I'm just not sure how to convince these guys to do that."

Gerrold looks back at Yuri, and then forward to the keep. "They look well-fortified, lads. 'Tis the last chance to change your minds."

Yuri shakes his head. "I think we're committed. The worst that's going to happen is that they'll tell us that Andreth is dead."

Starguard says, "Yuri, for Andreth's sake, this is one of those times that we need their help at any cost."

Stormy looks down from the top of the coach. "But we already **know** that, Yuri.

Yuri says, "Let's get on with it."

Gerrold nods, once, and lightly slaps the reins. The horses pull forward, straining for a moment, and cross the meadow. Their heads are beginning to sag, and it's obvious they've had a long hard haul behind them.

Tilara nods. "Not much point in putting things off."

_Entering the Keep  
The drawbridge is made of thick wooden planks, reinforced with iron, and crosses the moat. The water in the moat itself is clear, smells pleasant, and contains water lilies, and the occasional goldfish. There's an obvious current, suggesting that the moat is more of a diverted river or stream. Crossing the drawbridge, the front gates open into a dark cramped passage, barely wide and tall enough for one cart or two horses to pass._

Halfway down the passage, a single torch burns, and a man steps forward. "Halt!", he cries out. "State your business!" Gerrold pulls lightly on the reins, and the tired horses stand, heads hanging down.

Yuri dismounts from the carriage to face the guard.

Yuri looks briefly at the ceiling of the passage, then addresses the guard. "We're travellers from Woolwich. One of our number was badly injured and has expired. We've come seeking a way he may return to us."

Yuri says to the guard, "Who do I have the honor of addressing?"

The guard nods, once. "I'm Nolwen, one of the Gatekeepers. Alwen will fetch the captain. Are there any wounded among you, beyond the one who is ... I believe you mean he is dead, sir?"

Yuri winces. "Well met, Nolwen. Yes. He's dead. The rest of us have tended to our own problems on the way here, although I think that Gerrold would appreciate the opportunity to tend to his horses.

Tilara steps down to stand beside Yuri, shaking her head.

Ash stays quiet, sliding comfortably into the role of silent armsman.

Starguard frowns, but keeps his peace. He can get into detail with the healers later.

A second older man, wearing a crested helmet, steps into the light of the flickering torch. He carries a sword at his side, and looks well armored. He looks for a moment at the party, then turns to look at the horses. "Gentlemen, I am Agilnes, Captain of the Gate. I will escort you inside. Alwen, escort the horses to stabling." He turns on his heels, and walks through the passage, a third guard following him. Nolwen steps into a niche in the passage, waving the coach through.

_The Main Yard  
Passing underneath the walls, you step from darkness into light. In front of you is the main yard. To the left you can hear the ring of hammer on anvil. To the right stand the stables, where a horse occasionally whinnies. Further along the wall, still to the right, a giant outdoor oven, whilst further to the left are several buildings that could serve as barracks, or storage houses. Straight ahead lies the keep; a path winds around to the left side, where the great door of the keep can barely be seen.  
The wall is in excellent condition, both inside and out. The other buildings look a little older, and a little more worn. There are several monks working on one of the smaller buildings, repairing it._

Alwen takes hold of the bridle of the lead horse, and leads the coach to the stables, where two more men materialize and begin unharnessing the horses. Meanwhile Agilnes follows the path to the great door, where he waits patiently for the party.

Starguard emerges from the carriage, and with help, slides the wolf-skin wrapped body of his friend onto the litter. He looks to the others, except Yuri, to take a corner to help carry the poor lad...

Ash leans over, taking part of the load as well, with a sour look on his face.

Stormy gingerly holds up a corner, still looking a little green around the gills.

Tilara picks up her corner, and looks at Stormy until he takes the fourth. "Let's go, then."

Yuri turns to Gerrold and murmurs, "Thanks for taking us this far. If you want to get going, I think we're on our own from here. Tell Brother Oak that we are in his debt."

Yuri leads the way, walking point before Andreth's procession.

Gerrold scratches his head for a moment at Yuri's comments, then shrugs. He follows Alwen, to see that his horses are well cared for.

At the great door, Agilnes awaits the procession. Seeing the litter, he nods, and opens the great door rather than the smaller door set beside it. He steps into a great hall, whose roof reaches a height of several floors, as you can see from the two galleries circling it. The hall is filled with monks eating their evening meal, but there is a clear path up the center of the great hall and to a shadowed region beyond. Agilnes leads the party onwards, turning into a small chamber ta the far end of the Hall.

"Wait here; I will ask the Secretary to come see you." Agilnes makes one, small, bow, and leaves the room again, closing the door firmly behind him. The room you are now in is barely big enough for the party and the litter, and contains only the one door. Two candles keep it from being dark.

Ash lets out a short sigh of mixed relief and impatience. "My father had this sort of lifestyle in mind for me," he remarks to the air, as though defying the calm atmosphere with conversation.

Yuri says, "Oh? I guess you had other ideas?"

Stormy looks at Ash. "With breastplates and maces and stuff?"

Tilara says, "A monastery? Why?"

Ash shrugs. "More of the chanting part than the armor part, really. He had it in his head that a priest in the family would be a benefit."

Yuri says, "My father thought yet another weaver would be a benefit. It's amazing how fast everything has been moving, that was only three weeks ago."

"My father wanted ... well, never mind. He doesn't want it anymore." Stormy sounds unusually bitter.

Tilara nods to the boy. "Sounds like my own experience, Stormy. If you want to talk about it, I'm here."

Starguard sighs. "My father...died on the Lurinese front when I was a boy. I barely knew him."

Yuri says, "Then how did you end up in the Army, Starguard?"

Starguard says, "I enlisted at 16. I wanted to save other soldiers like my father, back in those idealistic days. I did, actually. Lost many, as well." He regards Andreth's body and silently adds _...but not this time._"

Ash gives another shrug, lifting the litter a bit in the motion. "What a father wants from his boy isn't stopped by little things like death."

Stormy shakes his head at Ash. "Especially when he's set trains in motion before the child is born."

Yuri says, "In that case, Ash, let's hope that Brother Oak has big plans for Andreth."

The door opens again, and a short stout man waddles into the room, carrying a brace of candles with him. He puts the candles on a small shelf and folds his hands over his quite substantial paunch. "Agilnes informs me you wish to see us. Perhaps I can be of assistance?"

Ash just looks down at the body, then back at the newcomer, as his answer.

Yuri takes a brief poll of the rest of the Company, glancing at their faces to gauge their moods, and then addresses the monk. "We are travellers from Woolwich. Who do we have the honor of addressing?"

The man rubs his paunch slowly. "I am Liowen, Secretary of the Abbot."

Yuri says, "I am Yuri. This is Tilara, Starguard, Ash, and Firestorm. On this litter is the remains of Andreth, a comrade of ours who died during an attack by wolves while we were camped on the road, two nights ago. We are seeking the wisdom of the Brothers for a way that he may be returned to us."

Starguard bites his tongue. Politics. He's never had much patience for this sort of thing.

Yuri inhales and exhales, deeply and slowly, and then says softly, "We call ourselves 'The White Company', and we've pledged to aid each other in our times of need. Andreth needs us and our means are insufficient. So we need you."

Yuri thinks, _All stories start with a name..._

Liowen looks carefully at each member of the party, before stepping forward to examine the corpse on the litter. After gently prodding it, he replaces the wolfskins. "I see, Yuri. But the kind of healing he requires is ", he pauses eloquently, "expensive. It is only rarely done. You do not look ... prosperous."

Ash casts a glance over at Yuri, curious to hear his reply.

Yuri says, "We know that it is difficult and rare even among people of wealth. Brother Starguard tells me that the process requires some exotic materials that are difficult to obtain."

Starguard says, "Specifically, a diamond. I saw it done, once."

Again Liowen lifts the wolfskin. "The body - with the exception of the torn larynx and hamstrings - looks to be in excellent condition. He makes a fine candidate. But the good Brother is correct; the materials we require are hard to obtain and costly to replace."

Yuri says, in a low voice, so that he does not appear to be bragging, "We have some skill in obtaining hard-to-find items. Perhaps we can retrieve the materials you require, if you will help us. And then the next person of stature asks for this service, you will be able to provide it to them without risking your own Brothers to acquire the materials."

Yuri carefully studies Liowen's face, making sure that his own is expressionless.

Starguard says, "And we do have some payment. The wolf skins are new, and if necessary, the mail I wear is expendable."

Liowen nods, once, his only expression one of genial hospitality. "We would care to hear more of your exploits, I think, Yuri. But not here, and not now. I shall send a brother to escort the body to the infirmary; we have a chilled room there which will keep it from decomposing. And we will offer you the hospitality of the keep; the brother will show you to the cells in which you may sleep tonight."

Yuri nods. "We are grateful for your hospitality."

Yuri says, "Brother Liowen... may I ask... what are the highest earmarks of a prosperity?"

"Prosperity? Fine clothes, good horses, a sizable retinue. And an entry in the peerage." Liowen smiles, once, and leaves the room, closing the door firmly behind him. He leaves the extra candles behind though, and the room is beginning to feel a little stuffy.

Starguard waits until the door closes. "Ah. And a stuffed shirt, apparently."

Yuri murmurs to the others, "Somehow, I thought that a high monk, would have higher aspirations."

Tilara sets down her corner of the litter, nudging the others to follow suit. "He did seem a bit ... shallow, didn't he?"

Yuri says, "Nevertheless, now we know what Brother Liowen expects of the world."

Starguard grumbles. "I'll need to go back to the carriage for our stuff. Full priest regalia for this guy. Spit-shine inspection time."

Yuri says, "If he underestimates us, that's no great insult, as long as we get Andreth back." Yuri glances at Ash, to see if his mood is any kind of barometer on the situation.

Tilara says, "Aye, but if we need his approval to get help - I wonder if he'd think my juggler's outfit would be more appropriate."

Ash's face reads like a stone wall - flat and featureless, though ready for an earthquake.

Yuri says, "Yeah... I have a better outfit than this in my pack. But remember, he's the secretary to the Abbot. I think that means that the Abbot will be hearing about this before any decisions are made."

Starguard knocks on the door, checking something.

Starguard hmms. "Strange. Cramped quarters for long term." He tries the door.

Ash seems lost in thought for a few moments. At length he speaks, in slow and measured tones. "Diamonds do not grow on trees. We shall have to sell our services to someone like a major landowner for this, I think. Or to the Brothers themselves. I get the impression of more than passing secular involvement here."

Yuri says, "There may be more than one way to do it. It may not be a diamond we're looking for."

Ash quirks an eyebrow. "That's what I was hearing we needed. What did you have in mind?"

Starguard says, "Yuri, you need a diamond. It's a technical thing about focusing a spirit back to his body..."

After more time has passed, a young lad, still wet behind the ears, eases the door open. "Sirs?" he gulps. "I've come to ... ah ... escort the corpse to the ... ah ..." He goes silent, goggling at the wolf pelts.

Yuri stands. "Don't panic, Brother. All the dangerous parts happened a few days ago. Just lead the way."

The brother nods, holding the door open. "If you'll ... ah ... follow me?" He leads the party through several dim corridors, and down a flight of stairs, to a small infirmary, where an older brother welcomes him. "The corpse can go right on the shelf in the next room, laddie. He'll not be disturbed."

Yuri makes a point of remembering the route. "Very well. Thank you."

Tilara helps carry Andreth's body into the room. "Thank you, sir. We appreciate the assistance."

Starguard looks the cleric over. "Hmm. You have the bearing of someone who's been down on the front..." he says. "Spent time in the army?"

"It's the least we can do, lass. There's nae hope for a man once he's all decayed; we'll not be having the raising of the undead here." The older brother settles in after seeing that the body is laid to rest correctly. He looks much like any healing oldtimer. A little haggard, a little tired, a little worn. He nods at Starguard. "Still serving, chap, still serving. And you?"

Starguard says, "I was called by the Stars a year back. Spent twenty years in the service. Couldn't save the lad though, not by myself." He pauses. "I wonder, would you know the best way to impress the abbot? He's a good friend, the poor boy.""

The older brother leans on his desk, chin cradled on both hands. "Now, is it Liowen yer wantin' to impress, or the abbot? Liowen's an easy man to impress; just be rich, and offer tae donate great sums to us. The abbot's more difficult; he lives for the mandate of the Brothers, he does."

Tilara grins in the background. _And that is something we might be much better at simulating. Good._

Starguard shrugs. "I was assuming the Abbot would be the one, but, quite frankly, whichever gets Andreth with us once more is the real target."

"Well, chap, it's like this. The abbot's yer only hope for the casting of the spell, but it's a drainin' endeavor, and the secretary don't like him to exhaust himself. We start healin' any lad as died, pretty soon we'll never get much work done." The older brother shrugs. "Sometimes 'tis just yer time tae go."

Yuri says quietly, "That may not be our decision. But we don't have to like it. Or believe it."

Tilara nods. "If it's his time, it is. But we're going to make sure it is before we accept it."

"Tis not what ye believe, laddie, but what the abbot sees that counts." The brother looks again at Starguard. "Now, I'm thinking' yer askin' for advice on how to approach the abbot? I'm thinking ye'd be best served by the truth, lad. Find a service ye can do him; a mighty one. Perhaps the wee lad over there can show you to the library so ye can ask the librarian fer suggestions."

Starguard nods. "I know, friend. There were many I couldn't save. What's our best route to save this one, though?"

Starguard smiles. "Thanks, friend. We'll do that. And if you need a hand with something, you ask me."

Yuri says, "I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm exhausted."

Ash shakes his head, looking stubborn as stone. "I'll be exhausted later. I want to at least talk to the librarian."

The older man chuckles. "Aye, chap, I'll mind me of the offer. Now, young Palla, show the lads the library. And be smart; librarian'll be asleep in an hour or so." Young Palla nods, almost bowing, and hurries out the door. He leads you throw a small warren of passages, back to the great Hall, which he crosses quickly. Then he runs up two flights of stairs into a large room filled with bookshelves and windows.

"Palla! What have I told you about running in the library!" a small, hunched over man steps out from behind the lectern where he's been writing with the aid of a candle. "And you've brought people with you? Reading hour is over, Palla. We'll have no more guests tonight!"

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "I think we're in for a hard sell..."

Tilara steps up to intercept the old librarian before he gets too worked up over the youngster. "We've only just arrived, sir, and the Brother at the infirmary asked young Palla to lead us here as quickly as possible. He was doing as he was told."

"Faugh! What's this! A woman! And in these halls! Palla; you'll be on ink duty for the next six months!" Palla pales, but stammers apologies, trying to explain he was instructed to bring the party here. The old man snorts. "Right; even to the infidel woman I can speak when needs must. Speak, infidel woman, tell old Rolwen what you seek."

Stormy pales, in anger, his hands balling up into fists.

Ash coughs meaningfully in Til's direction from somewhere in back.

Yuri says quietly, "Did not the Secretary say that we were to be extended the full hospitality of this place?"

"Speak, silly woman, speak! Come, if these boys will have you speak for them, then speak! Did ... what's that, you say, boy? Full hospitality? Faugh! Have I not extended every courtesy? You disturb an old man in his research, and you claim the right of hospitality? What are we? A tavern, to be used so? Now; what is it you want; I have books to copy, parchments to mend, scrolls to inventory."

Stormy's eyes begin to burn with a reddish gleam ...

Ash coughs again, looking nervously over at the kid.

Yuri grumbles. "Alright, you old goat, what we want is our dead friend back. And we expect that we're going to have to do someone's dirty work to get it. So IF you have a moment to spare, we were seeking to know what that dirty work might be. And I suggest you apologize to the young lady before the boy over there takes it _personally_. He's in an _incendiary_ mood."

Tilara doesn't even turn around. "Stormy. Outside. Now." She considers the librarian's somewhat impolite request, then blinks as Yuri growls back at him.

Yuri says, "My friend is dead, you parchment-skinned old grouch! And I'll not let you foul our chances of retrieving him!"

Ash steps forward, lowering a hand of rocklike strength onto Yuri's shoulder in a silent admonition.

Rolwen halts, and turns to face Yuri. "The boy speaks; speaks for himself! It's a miracle; a boy with a spine. Well, little girl, learn to walk quietly in the presence of your betters, and you'll do just fine." He shoos Tilara away. "Go follow yer lad; he's crying. Palla! Watch the boy; I'll not have the books harmed!" He turns back to Yuri. "As fer you; why didn't you say so immediately? I could have copied more than a page in the time you've wasted. Right. Dirty work. You **do** know what the Brothers mandate is, I hope?"

Yuri says, "We've been told that you are a research community. We know little more."

Ash pipes up. "You gather knowledge. Books."

"Yes; information! That's our mandate. And it's information the abbot seeks, trades for, quests for. Why, there are questions awaiting answers everywhere. Old musty tomes that have not been opened in centuries. New curiosities that confuse us every day." The man begins to look almost pleasant, as he expounds.

Tilara's eyes flash red for a moment - as bright as Stormy's - but she decides that since this tack is working, she'll not rock the boat. She puts a hand on Stormy's shoulder and gets him outside before things explode. "Heh. He's a cantankerous old goat, isn't he? Calm down, boy, he's not worth getting in trouble over. Yuri's got him in hand now."

Yuri lets him ramble on for a bit, eventually he'll get to his own point.

Palla follows Tilara and the lad outside. After he carefully closes the door, he apologizes profusely. Usually Master Rolwen is in a more cheerful mood, but he found evidence of mice in the library last morning.

Ash leans over and whispers to Yuri, "I think I understand the situation. I have a proposal."

Yuri whispers back, "I'm listening."

"So offer him information! Offer him answers! Go questing for the mysteries of the universe! Find an entrance to Ungfallen's Hall, or solve the mystery of the Fourth Spire, or find an untouched library!" The monk sits down, looking at his candle, which has burned more than halfway.

Yuri says, "Ungfallen's Hall and an untouched library, I can grasp. But what is the Fourth Spire?"

"The Fourth Spire? You haven't heard of the Fourth Spire? Do you know, at least, of the great Spire in Citadel which chronicles the history of the plains, and the two brother spires which chronicle the lands below and the foul stormwinds? Surely **everyone** knows that!"

Tilara says, "Mice in the library? Mirra? Mirra, where'd you get to?" She closes her eyes and concentrates - the cat never made it out of the dining hall, where she's shamelessly begging for treats. "Oh. Of course..."

Ash drags Yuri aside, smiling apologetically at the librarian. "Right. The man in charge wants information, but the man below him is watching the books, right? Can we get them an 'in' with any well-off families who have libraries of their own? Making introductions seems easier than much else we might be asked to do."

Palla nods eagerly. "You have a cat? The stable cats aren't allowed in here, ever since one had a litter in Master Rolwen's desk."

Starguard hmms. "I've heard rumors. A fourth tower, in the shadow of the great one. With a single word?"

Yuri nods, and speaks softly, "I wonder if Berina knows of any families of that type."

Rolwen nods enthusiastically at Starguard. "Yes! You ... who are you! Yes! That's the spire. What is a Samaela? Or who? Nobody knows! Nobody can shift the stone!"

Ash jerks his head toward the librarian. "It's that, or we go on a quest for the Brothers here," he replies quietly. "Which would YOU prefer?"

Tilara solemnly puts a hand on her chest. "I can guarantee that Mirra is not pregnant." She winks at young Palla. "Of course, she is female, so Brother Rolwen might still not like it. Let's not tell him, eh?"

Starguard hmms. "Perhaps...is this the greatest mystery in the realm? If we were to agree to search for Samaela, would the Abbot grant us a great boon?"

Yuri says, "It depends on what they're asking for. Berina's a hazardous quest in herself. But we should get out of here, I'm about ready to fall over. We need to find our stuff and get some sleep, we're not going to look either wise or impressive if we're bruised from fatigue."

Ash nods in agreement. "alright, I leave the rest to you."

Palla blushes, nodding. "Let's. I'm sure Master Rolwen won't notice, and perhaps if you make the offer through the abbot ... I'm sorry he acted like that. Usually he remembers the rules of hospitality."

Yuri murmurs to Ash, "Maybe we should let Starguard deal with Rolwen for the moment. I'm sure he can find us when he's ready."

Master Rolwen hahs at Starguard. "Solve the mystery and the abbot will personally give you the freedom of the keep. It's been gnawing at him for the past year or more."

Starguard nods, hmming. "Thank you, sir. We won't bother you anymore tonight."

Tilara says, "I've met bibliophiles before, Palla. Threats to their books make them all cranky, and mice are nasty little vermin for tearing things up. He's going to need to let the cats back in, though, one way or another."

As the rest of the party joins Palla outside, he leads you all back down the stairs to the great Hall. "We have cells lining the Hall for our guests; the first five have been made up for you. Gerrold is already asleep in the sixth." The cells, each a small six foot by six foot room, contain a bed, and a small stool. They lack doors, being closed only by a leather curtain. From Gerrold's cell, you can hear the snoring.

Mirra twines up around Tilara's ankles. _Nice food sources._

Tilara picks up her familiar. "I know, you hedonist. Keep a watch for mice, too. Palla here says they're in the library."

_Mice! Mice good! Hunt?_

Tilara nods. "We'll need to get permission from the librarian first. But if you want to hunt them anywhere else, go right ahead. You know about libraries, right? Lots of books and scrolls?"

Mirra taps at Tilara's nose. _Down! Hunt! No books! Books bad taste._

Tilara chuckles at her familiar. "Mice like them, though. If you go in there, don't let the old librarian see you." She giggles. "And definitely don't leave any kittens in his desk."

Yuri says, "I think that it's going to take more than Mirra's services to persuade the Abbot to help us. It might get us some points with the librarian, but frankly, I don't want to deal with him. I'm sorry if I scared anyone when I shouted at him, but I didn't have the patience to try and persuade him the easy way."

Tilara puts her familiar down to hunt. "It seems to have worked out... thought Stormy and I were both ready to fry him at that point. All's well that ends well."

Starguard nods. "Still, we come asking a favor. We should try not to offend anyone."

Yuri mentions Ash's proposal to the others. "The Abbot may like having a new library at his disposal. I'm sure that Berina could help us with that, but that's a hazardous undertaking of a different stripe."

Starguard says, "Or we could agree to help search for Samaela. That would likely be a great help... But let's sleep now, discuss in the morning."

Everyone gathers their gear, and chooses a cell. The night passes quietly, with the exception of Gerrold's snores. At dawn, a great bell begins to ring, and brothers file into the great Hall to break their fast.

Palla comes, and taps on the wall beside every curtain, inviting the party members to come break their fast.

Yuri awakens and dresses, taking the precaution of hiding his lockpicks in his boot.

Ash grumbles a bit, but moves out.

Tilara yawns. "Coming..." She puts herself back together and combs out her hair before stepping out. _Mirra? Where are you, girl?_

Mirra comes wandering by, a fat mouse in her mouth. _Good hunting!_

Starguard nods and wakes. "Good clothes today, lads and lasses." He washes, and dresses in his clerical vestments, the night purple cloth bedecked with yellow stars, the long cloak, and his holy symbol displayed openly. Quite a different look for Starguard.

Tilara grins. "Looks like it, dear heart. I'm glad you kept busy." She's wearing her jongleur's outfit - while not indicating high status, it's at least brighter and more appealing than her traveling clothes.

Palla looks awed when he sees Brother Starguard come out. "Sir! I never ... ummmm ... we break our fast in simple ways. Please, will you follow me to table?"

Yuri nods, and changes into his decent set of clothes... an artisan's outfit, but of the best cut.

Ash makes some effort to clean himself up, taking lessons from his old mentor, drunk though the man may have been..

Starguard sees what can be done with Firestorm, and suggests a ribbon for Mirra. "We ready?"

The table Pallas indicates has enough room left for the party. After he sees the party seated, Pallas looks at Gerrold's curtain and then visibly changes his mind. He sits down beside the party, across from Tilara, and breaks a piece of bread. "Liowen will see you at 9. The abbot will be there. Until then, you are invited to make free of the monastery; I will serve as your guide."

Yuri says, "It seems... but let's save any airs we might have for when they're needed. If Pallas says they break fast simply, let's not act like peacocks."

Tilara shrugs. "Easily solved for me, let me put my travel cloak over this."

Starguard nods, and dines simply, taking his time, worrying about Andreth.

After the early breakfast, Pallas leads the party to the Gallery, where he expounds happily on the history of the previous two abbots, and the recent founding of the monastery. He takes time to point out how well the outer wall has been refinished, and mentions plans to finish patching up the inner buildings too. Shortly before nine am, a young brother taps him on the shoulder and he turns to the party. "They're ready for us." Then he leads the party back to the great Hall again, choosing a single well lit passage with an ornate door at the end. Opening it, he announces your presence, and closes the door behind you.

Tilara stays toward the back of the party with Mirra, unsure whether or not the librarian's attitude is common here, and not wanting to disrupt things if it is.

Inside the room, Liowen is pacing and expostulating with the abbot, although he stills when he hears the door open. By the fire a thin elderly man is sitting, warming his hands, dressed in an old, patched, somewhat shabby robe. Liowen pauses dramatically and then turns to the party. "These, Father Abbot, are the lads that ask for extraordinary healing."

Yuri bows, not too deep, not too shallow.

The abbot looks up. "Yes? Liowen tells me you have an extraordinary request."

Ash follows Yuri's lead, standing off to one side and looking impassive.

Starguard bows with the group, nodding to the holy Abbot.

Tilara bows in the masculine style as well, and nudges Stormy to follow suit if he still looks rebellious.

Yuri says, "We do, sir. I am Yuri. This is Starguard, Ash, Tilara, and Firestorm. We're travellers from the town of Woolwich. We were attacked by wolves three nights ago and our friend, Brother Andreth, was killed. We've pledged to help each other in our times of need, and this is Andreth's time.""

Liowen nods impressively. "Yes, Father. Quite extraordinary. But perhaps I should let them speak for themselves." The Father Abbot smiles, suggesting that Liowen sit down. He himself stands up, moving to a chair that faces the room, while apologizing for his seated position.

Yuri says, "We understand that what we are seeking is difficult and rarely done, and so we wish to know what service we can exchange to the Brothers of the Waters in return for their aid."

Yuri watches the Abbot as he moves, trying to guess what kind of man he is.

Liowen begins to speak when the abbot shakes his head. "It is a great thing you ask, young man, and cannot be lightly bestowed."

Yuri says softly, "We know that. But we have to try. It seems that together we are good at finding lost things. Our lost friend is the most important yet."

The abbot nods. "It is a great tragedy, to lose a friend so young. And it would take a great working to undo the tragedy. We ... have been discussing this. Liowen, my good secretary, suggests that we request a donation which he seems certain you cannot make. I think, perhaps, I would like to know more about each of you, and about the young boy who lies in our morgue."

Yuri says, "Our only real items of quality are Starguard's chain, which seems to be enchanted, and the wolf hides we came with. But it seems you'd wish to hear our tale first. Does the Abbot have time for us to each tell our separate tales, and then I tell the end?"

The abbot shakes his head. "Tell me about who you are, young man. I have all day; I'm an old man and they find a thousand excuses not to burden me with work." Liowen begins to get up at this, and then sits back, a retort dying on his lips.

Starguard stifles a chuckle.

Yuri suppresses amusement at the group dynamics of the place, and gives the Abbot the short form of the history of the White Company, starting with the backgrounds of each member. He moves on to the events of the hiring fair, the infiltration of Ferg's gang, the recruiting of Ash, and the bloodless subdual of the bandits. He finishes with a statement of 'current affairs', including the journey to the Brothers for information about Ferg's feathers and brazier.

Yuri says, "It was important to us that we not be forced to kill the bandits, who were no better or worse than other men; and at the same time, we didn't want to just send them back to the slums to live hard and cause more trouble. It was not easy, but we believe we found a solution."

The abbot listens patiently, looking at each person in turn as their name is mentioned. "You sound ... like extremely enterprising young people. Why was it so important not to kill the bandits? Surely, as a weaver's son, you know what bandits do to trade?"

The abbot looks the longest at young Firestorm, and Ash. "And you have personally adopted these two men? I am ... impressed. With young people such as these, Liowen, Aglamar can regain its former ... glory. So tell me, young people, have you ever been to Citadel?"

Yuri says, "Before they went to work for Ferg, they weren't bandits. At worst they were bullies and cutpurses, and as far as we could tell, had done nothing worse than trying to better their position in the world."

Yuri motions to Ash and Firestorm. "Right now, we're the best place for them. It's up to them, how long they wish that to be so. We're not forcing anyone."

Ash shakes his head. "I have not been to Citadel personally, though I have often considered it."

The abbot smiles at Tilara. "And you, young lady, do you find it hard traveling with a band of young men?"

Yuri waits to see how Tilara answers that one, before mentioning that she's the only one that's been to Citadel.

Tilara grins, "Aglamar needs all her people working. Killing a dozen of them for not finding good opportunities seemed ... wasteful. Hard? Not really. When I was younger, I traveled with a group of performers, and that was much less pleasant even though I wasn't the only woman. We got to Citadel that time, but I had to leave the group shortly after our arrival there. Hardly had time to see anything, sir."

The abbot smiles at that. "You're a well traveled lady. And your company is obviously good at discovering things. I think, perhaps, we have a way of solving this conundrum that will benefit us both ..."

Yuri smiles, relaxing for the first time in several days.

"There is, in Citadel, the newly found Fourth Spire. Nobody knows where it came from, or how, but it cannot be shifted by mortal or arcane means. The emperor himself has finally commanded that it be left alone. And it contains only a single word, whose meaning nobody knows. Will you quest for that meaning for six months?"

Yuri looks to the faces of his friends, to make sure that this is acceptable.

Tilara murmurs "Samaela. This would be no hardship at all. I must confess to some curiosity on the matter myself. I'd heard something about it while I was there."

The abbot raises one finger, before glancing at Liowen, who looks fit to be tied. "There will be some conditions, of course. To satisfy Liowen, we will formally quest those of you whom are here. We will not, of course, ensorcel Andreth, since he cannot make this decision of his own free will. And after we do so, he may decide not to return. Some spirits prefer the Halls of the Dead."

Yuri says, "I believe, sir, that your offer is not only just, but quite apt. We accept. Shall we have the service of Andreth on this quest?"

Yuri sighs. "Six months questing for a solution to a mystery? If it would bring Andreth back, I'd allow myself to spend six years bound to the loom. I believe that we can trust you, sir, and I still consent. You'll have to ask the others individually, for I cannot presume to speak for them here.

The abbot waits patiently for each member of the party to respond.

Tilara nods. "If it's Andreth's choice to stay, so be it. But those were strangely behaving wolves, and something tells me his work here is not yet done. I agree."

Stormy nods, once. "I'll follow the Lady, honored Father abbot."

Yuri murmurs to Ash, "You never signed the papers, you don't have to do this. We'll still hire you on either way you decide."

Starguard nods. "Six months of our lives for what I suspect is thirty years of Andreth's? It's more than a fair trade. I would do it gladly for any of my adopted family.

Ash stays rooted where he is, looking grim. "These people put themselves on the line for my sake. I'll repay that by doing the same."

The abbot smiles. "You are a resolute young group of travellers. I will ask that you hold vigil in the chapel tonight, and tomorrow we shall enchant both you and your friend, Andreth. A quest is a frightening binding, but we will keep it honest, and leave you enough scope to breathe. Won't we, Liowen?" Liowen grumbles assent. "And Baerwen, our cleric, will lay out Andreth in the chapel too. A night of prayer will help our plight."

Starguard bows deeply. "Thank you, Abbot."

Liowen leans back. "We shall see how they fare, Father. I shall inform Rolwen that he is to answer any questions they ask."

Yuri winces when Rolwen is mentioned.

Yuri says, "Thank you, Abbot. We shall do our best."

The abbot smiles. "Palla will serve as your guide. He will bring you to the chapel tonight for your vigil."

Liowen stands, and summons Palla, who returns within moments, followed by Mirra. The cat has caught another mouse, and deposits it decorously at the feet of the Father Abbot. The abbot chuckles.

Tilara holds her breath, then chuckles as the Abbot seems amused. "Where'd you find that one, Mirra?"

Mirra, turning away from the dead mouse, looks at Tilara. _Small nest. Lots of books. Killed the nest. **Good** hunting._

Tilara grins at her familiar. "Ah, the library. We won't tell Master Rolwen, then."
