Game Log: Chapter 19 - Raising Questions


--------------------------------------------

After spending the morning with the abbot and Liowen, the party disperses after asking Palla a few questions. Yuri spends much of the rest of the day with Rolwen, carefully and politely picking his brain, while the others wonder around the keep.

Yuri takes some time before the geas to record on parchment some of the things that he's found, so that he doesn't forget, and to write a letter home to explain to his parents what's going on.

Starguard moves down to the healing areas, assisting Baerwen, leaving the studying to younger eyes. Andreth is his concern, and he helps anyway he can.

Yuri sighs, and thinks, _It's so hard to think about things like wool and weaving, at times like this. I write like it's nothing: 'Wolves killed my friend so we've gone to get him back, see you when we're done'. I wonder if they'll believe it?_

Baerwen motions Starguard to lift up one end of a stretcher. "We'll take him to the chapel, lad, and put him on the altar. After we wash him a little in the waterfall."

Starguard nods, making mental notes. Just because he isn't strong enough to call back the spirit of his friend yet doesn't mean he never will be. "Yes, sir."

Tilara spends time with Stormy, coaching him some more in the discipline needed to use the fire on demand rather than when the power begins to overload him.

Baerwen smiles. "The Dark Lord's willing, we'll have him back by mid-morning."

Ash takes as much time as he can to enjoy the open air, letting the freedoms of the wind bolster him against upcoming spiritual servitude.

Stormy nods, paying careful attention. He's **almost** got the burning hands under control; lately he's been dreaming about bringing forth light on command.

Starguard nods, a slight edge in his voice at the thought of this endeavor failing. "The Dark Lord willing."

And so the day passes in dreamy contemplation and hard work. Andreth's body is properly cleaned and laid to rest. Mirra amuses herself hunting mice. Yuri grows to understand Rolwen's irascibility, and Palla keeps flitting from person to person.

When the sun begins to set, Palla rounds everybody up, even Mirra, escorting them to the great hall for a light supper, before leading them to the chapel. Now that Palla has gathered the group together again, everyone else seems to be studiously ignoring them.

_The Chapel  
Situated under the cellars, in a large natural cave, the chapel is lit by glowing orbs that shine with a golden light. Behind the altar, the water from a fresh spring is gathered in a bowl, high on the wall. The water, in turn, falls down the side of the bowl, and splashing into a small ornamental basin lower down. The basin is decorated with small mountains, seemingly snow-topped, so that the water flows in rivers between them to a sandy beach and the sea beyond. The mountains feel almost feminine. Other than the altar, the flowing water, and the glowing lights, the chapel is entirely empty._

Andreth's body lies in solemn state on the high altar, shrouded in a clean white wolf pelt.

Palla, after seeing that everyone has entered the chapel, steps forward to the basin, where he ritually washes his hands in the small waterfall; before touching wet hands to forehead. Then, patiently, he waits.

Tilara follows the boy's lead, assuming that this is part of the ritual.

Firestorm steps up on the far side of Tilara, and carefully washes the grime off his hands. For a moment Palla looks shocked, but then he shrugs lightly, and touches his wet hands to Firestorm's forehead. "You're a braver man than I am, Firestorm."

Ash looks nervous, feeling out of place in his well-worn travel clothes in this, a monument to his world's highest powers during a ceremony invoking forces he cannot comprehend.

Yuri murmurs to Palla, "Aren't we supposed to wash, also?"

Tilara winces as Firestorm treats the ritual as a washing-up. _I hope that doesn't mess things up..._

Palla nods, at Yuri. "Certes. Hands and head; vigil will serve to cleanse the heart."

Yuri does so, with quiet reverence.

Yuri thinks, _Return our friend. You'll get us all eventually, but we have much left to do first._

Starguard goes through the washing up almost mechanically, quiet, eyes on the clean, still form of his friend.

After waiting for the cleansing ceremony to be complete, Palla steps to the altar, and lightly cleanses Andreth's hands, where they lie crossed on his breast, and Andreth's forehead. He kneels once, before the altar, and genuflects. "Gentlemen, Lady; the vigil is a time of prayer. Seek ye out your gods, and ask their blessings. Ask for a clean slate, and the tools to write on it. I will return come the morning."

Tilara is closest to Stormy when he washes his hands... she watches in dismay, then looks more closely. She nods and whispers to Yuri, "The water's magic. The dirt just ... vanished."

Yuri murmurs back to Tilara, "Interesting..."

Starguard kneels, head lowered. While the stars are only visible at night, they are still there during the day, outshone by Brother Sun. He calls on the Stars now to bless this act, and this young boy, and help him find his way back from Ungfallen's halls.

Yuri kneels down, in front of the altar. His gods are the gods of knowledge, and he considers again what he's found in the library. Much of what Rolwen led him to came in threes. And much of it is puzzling in the extreme. Finally he sighs, and speaks up. "As we meditate, we should consider what we've learned today. With Rolwen's aid we found three possible daggers, and three possible explanations for the feathers. And he was positively gleeful when he hug up some cautionary tales about geases. But the story of the Stormwind spire may be our greatest clue."

Ash lowers his own head, thinking of the harvest - the ravages of winter, the renewals of spring.

Firestorm curls up on his heels, arms wrapped around his legs, back leaning against a chilly wall. His eyes are closed, and he seems to be mumbling a simple repetitive prayer under his breath. He looks up, when Yuri speaks, his eyes wide, before curling up again.

Tilara kneels, reaching inside herself with the discipline she learned for her spells, but directing her thought outward this time. _Brother Sun? Are you listening? We've lost a good companion before his time. We need him back, and we will need your help to shed light on the mystery that we're pledged to unravel in return for the aid we need to call Andreth back from the halls of Ungfallen. Please intercede for us...._

An hour has passed, time quietly slipping away. Brother Starguard begins to feel a little light-headed. A voice begins to slide into his mind, singing soft lullabies. Soon the voice spreads to all, the lullaby pervasive.

The voice sings of mountain meadows, and shallow caves, and fresh running water. The voice sings of sunshine and rain and the light sea breeze. And the voice sings of sleeping, and dreaming, and passing on ... And then the voice begins to vary, singing to each person in turn. To Starguard, the song is one of welcome, as the Stars welcome him home. To Andreth it's a song of greeting, in his meditations. To Ash the song sings of longings inchoate and possibilities gained and lost, while to Yuri it sings of great trading houses. But to Tilara and Firestorm it sings only of everlasting sleep.

In the Hall, where Andreth's spirit rests, Merial again approaches him. "You are called, Andreth. Will you go?"

Starguard smiles, the Stars calling him...but he stays away as best he can for now. He's not wanting to go to the Stars just yet, only ask their aid in bringing another back...

Tilara fights the drowsiness as the voices sing in her head of sleep....

Wilthorwen appears in Starguard's mind. "You treat your friends well, friend. Will you travel where they go?"

Yuri thinks, _We bargain for our friend's life. What do we have that you want?_

Andreth raises his head from his meditations. "To what am I called?"

The voice chuckles, inside Yuri's head. "Everything. And nothing. We will take what you offer, and judge the price fairly."

Ash wobbles a little. "Too much.. left undone.." he mumbles.

Merial looks at Andreth. "To your future. Will you go?"

Starguard speaks back to Wilthorwen. "As long as these old bones are able, I will follow and protect best I can. I have failed Andreth once, I will try not to let anyone down again."

The voice inside Ash's mind turns more strident. "Undone! We are undone! what will be done now?"

A sense of great comfort steals over Starguard, as his head begins to droop. The lullaby becomes irresistible, as he slowly slumps into a deep and gentle sleep.

The voices torment Tilara a little further. "See your friend; see him slump. Will you not sleep, a little?" But then Firestorm looks up, and screams in agony.

Ash protests, half to himself, "father's dreams.. my dreams.. live for them both.. living make the dreams of the dead come to pass, s'what the Merchanter said.."

The voice in Ash's mind gets more insistent. "Which dreams do you choose?"

Tilara shakes her head in denial. "I will _not_ sleep. This is a vigil for Andreth, not a plea to join him --" She turns at the boy's scream, and moves toward him. "Stormy? What is it? What do you see?"

Yuri is somewhat unnerved by the voice in his head. "Death takes us all, eventually, and the coins of mortal man are especially ephemeral. The only true coin is life, and glory, and the stories we leave behind, and the ones we take with us. We're not done writing ours yet. Today it is short. If we return to you later, it will be a volume with gilded leaves."

Ash shrugs to himself, feeling the overwhelming urge to sleep clouding his ability to think. "Father wants land.. wants kids to be secure.. best way to do that.. title.. crown grant. Gotta be noble.. gotta earn it.. s'what I wanted anyway.."

Stormy looks up, eyes blank. "I see the gods, Tilara. And they judge ... they judge! They find me ... wanting!"

Andreth opens his eyes, and stands. "I will go where I must..." He fixes Merial with a stare as strong as he can muster. As feeble a thing as that may be. "But if I had my will in the matter, I would return to my friends, if I could."

"Yes; we will accept stories, Yuri. They are the coin that pays passage in every realm. Tell mighty stories, Yuri. Make your shield mate proud." The voice inside Yuri's head seems to smile, as a hand passes over his face, closing his eyes. He feels sleepy, but content, and as Yuri mumbles "Once upon a time ...", he sinks into a profound slumber.

Merial smiles at Andreth. "It is the wise man who asks for answers before he makes commitments. We shall not contest your will."

Tilara holds the boy. "They find us all wanting, Stormy, especially at first. Ask them for the will to overcome your flaws and the time to find your strength."

The voice inside Ash's head begins to badger him. "A noble? What's a noble? The Stormwinds are noble savages; will you join them?"

Andreth's eyes widen. "Then such a thing is possible?"

Stormy stiffens in Tilara's eyes. "I ... I don't know how."

Merial touches Andreth on the cheek, and even in this strange otherworld he feels a moment of burning. And then his eyes drift shut ...

Ash shakes his head, wishing to clear away the clouds. "Noble's what'd let m'dad farm his land without much fear.. noble's the people who don't have to farm, though.. they may not be 'the best', but they have the chance to be.. nobility's the door to greatness, I was told. 'S a good man who'll walk through it, but a good serf's got no chance at all..."

Tilara's eyes flash for a moment. "The same thing you must do when you control your power, boy. Concentrate! Ignore the distractions and reach inside yourself, and focus your whole being on what you wish to do."

Stormy nods, once, and kneels on the ground, his hands pushing into the floor. His eyes are now pressed shut, and tears flow freely down his cheeks. After a few moments, he begins to glow ...

The voice inside Ash's head quietens. "Be noble, lad. Be noble, and you'll be a noble. Now; dream of noble deeds, lad." Ash's mind finally clouds over entirely, and he too slumps into sleep.

Tilara blinks as Stormy starts to glow. _This is ... different. He's not usually glowing as he calls on his power. I hope he didn't get confused about what he's concentrating on...._

Slowly, Stormy slumps forward, as peace steals over his countenance. Now, relaxed, he looks quite different. Tilara has never seen him thus; his face is unlined, his eyed closed, but most of all the betraying tenseness of constant fear has slid from his shoulders. In this light he is ... a very comely lad.

The song inside Tilara's mind modulates. "You keep vigil. You will not sleep. Why?"

"The gods are fickle, Tilara. They aid the one and abandon the other. Are you fickle? Will you leave the boy as you left your parents?"

Tilara growls in her mind at the voices. "I am _not_ fickle, even if the Gods are. I give my loyalties where I choose, but I will keep them once given. The boy needs my aid and is willing to take my advice, so I will aid him as long as he needs. All people must leave their parents sooner or later, and mine wanted me to abandon my power, renounce my magic, and write the story of my life as a footnote to mediocrity. I did not abandon them, they drove me away with a choice between them and my proper destiny."

The voice inside Tilara's head chuckles. "We keep vigil, Tilara. We who watch. We will ... watch you. Keep vigil, Tilara, for the night is long."

Tilara settles back as the voice fades out in her head. She looks around at the others, all sleeping ... and shrugs. _I don't know what that was all about, but I'm the only one still awake. I wish I knew if that was good or bad.... but they did say we were to keep vigil, so I'd think **one** of us should be awake._ She watches the others, waiting for dawn.

The others slumber, quietly. The change in Firestorm is the most noticeable, but each of the slumbering friends looks a little more peaceful, a little more relaxed. And there's a new scar on Andreth's cheek; it looks as though four fingertips touched him briefly. The night passes quietly; sometimes keeping vigil is as tedious as it is uplifting. Still, Tilara hears the step of Palla approaching.

Tilara gets up as she hears footsteps, and nudges the others. "Time to wake, companions. We're supposed to be holding a vigil, not a slumber party... I hope this won't hurt our chances."

The companions waken easily. Their faces light up with smiles, as they recall dreaming of good things. But even as they try to remember, the memories fade away. As they sit up, the door to the chapel opens, to admit Palla, who is leading Rolwen, Liowen, and the abbot.

Starguard relaxes, rested, his eyes moving up to the abbot...

Ash blinks himself awake, smiling. "It was glorious," he breathes to himself with a broad smile on his face. Then a crestfallen expression sweeps across his features as angels carry away the personal heaven he so recently occupied.

The abbot steps up to the basin, where he, too washes hands and forehead, before sprinkling a little water on Andreth. Liowen, Rolwen, and Palla each step up in turn, cleansing hand and head ritually. Then the abbot turns. "I have asked Liowen and Rolwen for aid, for they will cast the geas spells. That will leave me the strength to call your friend's spirit."

Starguard says, "Is there any aid I can give you, Abbot?"

Rolwen steps forward, scowling at Firestorm, who is a little slow to wake up. "Shall we geas you first, lad? It's been a while since the last time someone survived a geas." Meanwhile the abbot shakes his head. "Nay, Starguard. Now we pray to the gods."

Yuri looks around the room, and across his companions. _Something happened... but... what?_

Yuri narrows his eyes. "We all go together, Brother Rolwen."

Rolwen snorts at Yuri. "We'll not make this a group geas; it's a choice each of you makes. Right, boy! Will you accept this charge?"

Firestorm kneels, eyes wide in a face that's suddenly drawn and pale.

Yuri says quietly, "If anyone's going to risk themselves, it should be me."

Tilara says, "It's all of us, Yuri. The Company looks after its own. Firestorm, this is not binding on you unless you want it to be."

Liowen hmmmmmphs, and moves to stand in front of Yuri. "Will you accept the geas?"

Firestorm looks straight into Rolwen's eyes. "I ... stand with ... my friends. I accept your geas."

Yuri looks into Liowen's eyes, unflinching. _I know the true coin of prosperity, sir. And I shall see more of it in my time than you._ "Yes."

Rolwen places his hand on Firestorm's head, and bows his head. Similarly, Liowen places his hand on Yuri's head. Both seem to freeze into immobility, as they begin to glow, their hair lifting away from their heads. The feel on Yuri's and Firestorm's heads is electric, heating and glowing, and suffusing. Then Liowen speaks. "Hear then the geas; for six months you will quest to find the name of Samaela. You will not turn aside from your seeking of knowledge until you have the meaning of Samaela. When you have the meaning, or when the six months have passed, you will return to us. This is the coin you pay for your friend's life."

Rolwen releases Firestorm, who sags slightly, before straightening out his shoulders. He moves towards the altar, to gaze upon Andreth for a moment. And then he stands aside. Rolwen motions at Tilara. "Come, little lady. Let's take you next, shall we? Liowen?"

Tilara nods, ignoring Rolwen's condescension. "Fair enough."

Liowen nods, releasing Yuri. He turns to Brother Starguard, then shakes his head. "Ash; will you accept the geas?

Ash nods his head slowly, though he's clearly got second thoughts. "Do it."

Again the clerics place their hands on Tilara's and Ash's heads. Again Liowen speaks. "Hear then the geas; for six months you will quest to find the name of Samaela. You will not turn aside from your seeking of knowledge until you have the meaning of Samaela. When you have the meaning, or when the six months have passed, you will return to us. This is the coin you pay for your friend's life."

As Liowen finishes, the abbot strides forward to face Brother Starguard. "Will you accept the geas? If yes, please kneel. I'm not as tall as I used to be."

Starguard falls simply to his knees. "I accept this geas."

The abbot places both hands on Brother Starguard's head, looking deeply into Starguard's eyes. "The gods spoke to me, young man. You should discover who you are. You all should; there are unplumbed depths in each of you. But on you, Brother Starguard, I place this geas. For six months you will quest to find the meaning of Samaela. You will not turn aside from your seeking of knowledge, but to succor these your companions who travel with you, until you have the meaning of Samaela. When you have this meaning, or when the six months have passed, you will return to me. This is the coin that you pay for your friend's life."

Starguard looks mildly confused as the geas infuses him. _Discover who I am? I know who I am...I'm a healer._ Still, the words unnerve the cleric a little.

Palla steps forward, giving his hand to the abbot, who smiles. "Now, then. We come to the greatest ceremony of all. I think I need to sit a moment. Ah. Thank you Palla." The abbot sinks down onto a stool Palla has provided from beneath the altar.

Yuri turns to watch, looking at Andreth. _You, at least, will be free. And that means that our hands are not completely tied in this matter._

Tilara straightens up, even more serious now than for the geas. _Let this work, please..._

Ash gazes on with a mixture of curiosity, wonderment and abject fear.

After the abbot has rested for a few minutes, he stands up. Tottering a little, he moves to Andreth's head, where he closes his eyes in prayer, both hands cradling Andreth's cheeks. His hands begin to glow, as do his closed eyes.

Starguard rises, looking at his friend. They've done what can be done, now this is the moment of truth...

Liowen steps to the basin, with a small object in his hand. "Unto the Waters we gift, From the Waters we request. Let this young man live, to rejoin his friends who have promised much for him. Let their promises ring true."

The abbot nods once, looks up, eyes wide, as the light forms a glowing nimbus around his head. "Let these young people learn who they are, before they forget who they were! Andreth; come to us."

Andreth's spirit hears the voices calling to him... and, true to his word to Merial, he begins the journey back to his former habitation. His friends call to him, or those from whom his friends have sought aid; and he answers.

The white wolf's pelt is slowly stained with red, as the wounds in Andreth's throat close. His hands stir, barely, and the color begins to return to his face. His lips open, and a first breath of air is sucked in. And then a second. And a third.

The abbot begins to sag, the light failing, as Palla catches him. Rolwen and Liowen each take one of the abbot's arms, as Rolwen commands the young un to stay with the body. The abbot obviously needs to see Baerwen immediately.

Starguard sees the abbot slump, his heart falling. Not enough? Is Andreth lost?

Andreth's eyes open, slowly, gazing at the tall ceiling of the chapel.

Yuri startles when the abbot falls. "Is he OK? What happened?"

Palla looks worried. "The abbot is ... old. And the calling requires a great deal of power."

Tilara starts toward the abbot as he slumps, then looks toward Andreth, who seems to be breathing again, at least. She's still undecided when Liowen and Rolwen move to help the abbot down to the infirmary. "I hope this wasn't too much for him."

Starguard notices the slight movement of Andreth, and moves to the altar, looking down. "Andreth? Is that you, boy?" He looks at his neck, smoothly attached once more, his veins and arteries reknit, bone and sinew mended...

Andreth's voice is hoarse from disuse. "I remember... wolves in the night... and then the hall of Ungfallen..." He doesn't sit up yet... he feels too weak to move just yet... but he's alive. "Starguard... What happened?"

Ash just stares on at the spectacular display, unlike anything else he's ever seen.

Yuri glances at Starguard, and then notices that Andreth is breathing... and his jaw drops.

Starguard hugs his friend gently. "Lay still lad. You've been dead for nearly a week. I thought we had lost you."

Tilara says, "That sums most of it up rather nicely, Andreth. We brought you here as quickly as we could and called you back to us. How are you feeling?"

Palla moves forward, to look into Andreth's eyes. After a moment, satisfied, he steps to the side. "I think, ladies and gentlemen, that we could move this reunion to the Great hall? There's been ... the brothers offer you a feast."

Yuri says, "Mighty tales, indeed. I have not seen everything, but it will be some time before I see the likes of this again. And for that I give thanks."

Andreth says, "A little... dizzy, maybe," finally venturing to sit up. "I was... really dead? It already begins to seem fuzzy...""

Starguard smiles broadly. "Easy lad, easy. Don't strain yourself." He looks over to the abbot, making sure that the holy man is alright, if weak...

Yuri just slumps down on the floor of the chapel, in a sitting position.

Andreth raises his hand to his cheek. "I remember... I was touched on his cheek..." His fingers rise to the fresh marks on his face, and his eyes go wide.

Yuri says, "We shall be with you presently, Palla. For now, I think we need a moment to catch up."

Palla nods. "I will leave you in peace. Come when you have resurrected bonds that were broken. We will feast you in the Hall."

Tilara nods. "Those marks appeared on your cheek in the middle of last night, Andreth. I wonder who touched you...."

Starguard says, "How you feeling, Andreth? Hungry? Thirsty? Do you think you can make it to the hall?"

Yuri levers himself upright, and murmurs to Starguard, "How does he look to you? Any injuries? Any weaknesses?"

Firestorm hangs back, awkwardly. He looks at Andreth, but wavers about intruding.

Andreth says, "I don't wonder, Tilara, I _know_. 'Twas the goddess Merial who touched me. I still remember the burning of her hand..." He slowly eases his legs off the altar, supporting himself on Starguard for the time being. "It is no small thing to call a soul back from Ungfallen's hall..."

Starguard nods. "I know lad. You've lost weight, tone. You need rest, good food, liquids..."

Tilara nods at that. "Merial Herself? I am impressed. The Abbot said we had unplumbed depths. Let's go find out what they are, then. Hungry, Andreth? They've planned a feast."

Ash chuckles. "I think the abbot must have heard about our excavations underground."

Yuri addresses his first words to Andreth. "Andreth. Welcome back. Much has happened, and I'm sure you'd like to hear all about it. It looks like it's time to turn the page."

Yuri says, "We have a new quest, but I think for right now, the powers that be won't begrudge us a drink. Preferably a very large one from a very old bottle."

Andreth smiles at Ash. It's a rare enough expression on his face, but warranted. "I think, if the abbot willing to grant such a boon, they were thinking far deeper than that." He nods to Yuri. "I've many questions to ask, like what it cost you to bring me back... but there'll be time for that later. Right now I'm famished."

Now that Andreth is, once more, whole, the party moves back to the Great Hall. There, they find the abbot in the high seat, and the feast in full swing. Palla spots them, as they enter the Hall, and bustles over. "Come, come. You sit at the high table tonight. Andreth, the abbot invites you to sit beside him. He would know much of the places you have been. Gentlemen, if you'll all join me?"

Yuri follows, allowing his usual composure to return. _It worked. For now, that's enough._

Tilara grins just a bit at Palla's choice of words, but assumes that if she acts as if 'gentlemen' includes her, no one will argue the point.

The feast passes merrily, lasting long into the afternoon. Gerrold, himself, stands to toast the young man as made Brother Oak fret. Baerwen stands to toast the party who have unthinkingly promised much for the chance - only the chance, mind you, lads, so don't be getting foolish - of their friend's return. Rolwen stands to toast Mirra, who has thus far delivered seven mice to him. he toasts her with a special saucer of cream. And Liowen ... sips his wine, blandly."

Starguard smiles, good humor returning as Andreth eats, and drinks, and lives once more. _You can have him later, Ungfallen. He's ours for a while yet._

Ash eats little and drinks less, still mindful of his lowly position amidst those who wield the powers of the gods. He does ask one very timid question during the feast though: "Have you prayed about the meaning of Samaela?"

The abbot leans over to look at Ash. "Yes; we have. Perhaps every learned priest in the empire has. But the gods are stubbornly silent. And Jurdah ... is as oblique as ever."

Starguard pauses in mid-bite. "Mmm. We need to start that soon. I can feel the urge to move already, to find a direction to search."

Liowen snorts, sourly. "Jurdah? All you ever get, for praying to him, is a vision of the four spires. Pfaugh. I still say, abbot, that you've exhausted us so these ragamuffins will travel for a sixmonth."

Yuri reflects, slightly sloshed. "It's a name. Gotta be a name. There's a name at the top of the Stormwind spire, and on top of ours, too, right? So it's a name. A name of someone who's going to be important."

Rolwen glares at Liowen. "Already they have questions to ask. They've asked better questions than you ever did. And **they** helped ride the library of mice. And ... ummm ... thank you, miss, for the loan of your cat." Rolwen blushes beet red.

Ash takes another bite, chewing thoughtfully. "Are the gods ever silent on issues they wish man to overcome on their own, or only on things they wish man not to trifle with?"

Starguard nods. "I would think a young name, as they have not done anything to make another word or phrase appear. Someone who will be great, but is not yet."

Tilara says, "Or perhaps a title... It's likely to refer to a person, at any rate." She grins at the librarian. "Not at all. She was happy to oblige. She does suggest that you might let some of the cats - not the ones that are expecting, she says, and not the dominant toms - back in to keep the mice out."

The abbot smiles at Ash. "Why, son, the gods are silent when they choose not to speak. And voluble when they do choose. They are much as their children, in that regard."

Rolwen nods at Tilara. "Perhaps she will ... mediate with the cats?"

Yuri says, "And, see, it has to be someone who's going to be important, in the future, because if they were already important, there'd be other markings on the spire. And we might have heard about them. Like Potapka... she's just a child now, and she's probably only a few runes on the stone. But later there will be more. So if it's another child, then he - she - whatever - is going to be, what, four years old soon? Isn't that about when they start getting into trouble?"

Tilara chuckles. "I can ask her, and she'll probably oblige... but cats are cats. Hard to give them orders, sir."

Rolwen breaks his bread into tiny crumbs. "A request, miss, will be kind. Thank you."

The abbot turns to look at Yuri. "Potapka? Nay, she's not on the spire yet. Nor are any of the princes. The last name is Glia-Gulmeshki.

Tilara says, "I'll see what we can do for you. I hate to see good books ruined by mice."

Starguard says, "Perhaps...a new Firstborn? An immortal in this day and age?"

Yuri says, "Then, sir, and it's good to see you ambulatory again, we must be dealing with someone exceedingly important, as important in their way as the Emperor is in his. A new, powerful tribe, in a new place."

The abbot looks thoughtful. "People are beginning to suggest that Glia-Gulmeshki is a Firstborn. Already, some of the princes clamor that he should go on a Totem quest. And yet ... to have two Firstborn in but a few centuries."

Rolwen completely obliterates the food on his plate. "Thank you, m'lady. And ... uh ... I ... uh ... ummmm ... I'msorryIyelledatyou."

Yuri says, "Oh. And someone Jurdah knows, in all likelihood, but of whom he is unwilling to speak. Wonder if it's a relative."

Starguard nods. "Truly, this is something worth questing for, even without bargaining Andreth's life in the balance.

Liowen snorts, again. "I'd not seek Jurdah, if I were you. He's been dead these ages past. He's ... old. You're looking for something shiny, and new."

Tilara turns back to the subject at hand. "Now, if I've got this straight, one spire tells the story of the plains, and one tells the story of the Stormwinds. The third is the story of the House of Ungfallen, correct?"

Starguard smirks. "A diamond is shiny and new, Liowen. But it has been buried for ages before being brought to light.

Rolwen nods.

Yuri sobers up a bit. "Yes, Brother. That was the cost. The Quest isn't the cost. The cost is now we can't go back to the fields and the looms and the small temple next to the cooper's house. The cost is that now we've made our choice between having the freedom to be obscure and let the wider world pass us, and standing up to be noticed, for good or for ill."

Liowen raises an eyebrow at Starguard. "And then it is a colorless, lifeless stone. Why not leave it where it rested?"

Rolwen pulls out three buns. "Actually, miss, you've got the order confused. First came the First Spire, which chronicles our lives even today. The second spire chronicles Ungfallen's Realm. It's the third, though it has grown past the second, that chronicles the Stormwinds."

Starguard says, "Why put a diamond on a crown, or a ring, Liowen? I'm simply stating that while I believe that Samaela is referring to something new, it may just be new to us."

Yuri looks over at the Abbot. _And you knew that, too, I'm sure. And you know why that's a harder price to pay than a mere geas._

Tilara nods at Rolwen's correction. "Thank you. Still, this would imply that the new spire - remember, Glia-Gulmeshki _Himself_ is only an addition to our Spire - the new spire is the story of a fourth House. Possibly a member of one of the existing Houses for now, until the schism takes place. Possibly a new child of the Gods themselves, but one would think they'd have mentioned it..."

Yuri says, "Maybe it's somewhere distant, Til."

Rolwen shakes his head. "Mention it to whom? Glia-Gulmeshki came from nowhere."

Yuri says, "But then I wonder, why all of the spires are in the Citadel. Wouldn't it be more appropriate for the Stormwinds' spire to be in their lands?"

Yuri has an idea. "You don't think... that it could be a Changer, do you?"

Liowen turns the argument on its head. "Why indeed put a diamond on a crown? Is it the gem that makes the wearer a king, or the wearer himself? Does it have meaning, or is it merely ornamentation?"

Tilara says, "Citadel is where the Spires all are. That was the original home of the Gods while they still walked this land, after all." She nods at Yuri. "Could be. No guarantee that this person is from the plains."

Ash watches the discussion go back and forth, and ponders quietly.

Rolwen raises an eyebrow. "A Changer? And who says there is no spire in the mountains. As you recall from the biography we found, Yuri, Jurdah traveled widely."

Tilara hmmms at Rolwen's comment. "That is an interesting thought. Has there ever been any sign that there are Spires in the Stormlands?"

Starguard nods. "The possibilities are wide open, certainly. The question becomes, which road should we take? Should we go look at the spire, or follow what rumors we can?

Yuri reaches into his shoulder bag, and pulls out some sheets of parchment where he's been making notes. "Right, right, there might be one in their lands too, but then why would there be more than one? Some parts of the Stormwinds history is also our history, and so that might be why we have a spire that tells it."

Rolwen looks at his buns. "Spires? Who can tell. But it is uncanny; in the legends the Stormwinds know who we are, even as we know of them."

Tilara looks to the librarian and the monks. "The Spire of the Stormwinds tells their story even yet, does it not?"

Yuri says, "And if that's true, it might be that this is someone who's going to be part of our history, as Flatlanders, as well."

Starguard says, "Wouldn't something of our history be on the central spire, Yuri? This isn't so much a new branch as a new tree, I think."

Yuri checks his notes for references to the Changers, and finds none. "I think we better have a look at the Spires ourselves, first. What they don't tell will be as important as what they do. And then, Starguard, I expect we'll have a lot of rumors to choose from."

Rolwen nods at Tilara. "The Stormwind's spire tells of Timron's defeat, and of the shrinking of their people - for many of them died in the last great battle - and their struggles to reassert themselves. Or so people think. The spires are not ... detailed."

Andreth eats in near-silence, answering whatever questions the abbot may have, but mostly just listening to the speculations surrounding him.

Yuri hmms. "Even if it's a new tree, it's going to grow in our direction sooner or later, if only because we're going looking for them. I mean, look at how much commotion it's caused already. In its own small way, Samaela - whoever that is - is having an impact on us."

The abbot nods at Yuri. "As is our own curiosity, Yuri. As is our own curiosity."

Yuri says, "I wonder... if they know about us."

"Which they, Yuri?" The abbot smiles. "Certes the prince will know of you in a span of days. Already the messenger travels with my letter. And I will have more letters for you tonight."

Tilara says, "The legends say the Stormwinds know us, as we know of them. Maybe there are more spires..."

Rolwen perks up, hearing about letters. "Ah, yes. Palla found these cards. They each seemed to ... respond to one of you. Perhaps they will aid you."

Yuri says, "Why, Samaela, of course. I wonder how much they - he, or she, or it, or them - know of the Flatlands."

Tilara blinks at the idea of letters. "To the Prince? About _us_?"

The abbot only smiles at Yuri. "And this, too, we would like to know." Then turning to Tilara, he smiles again. "The prince is our sponsor; surely we should inform him."

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "The Prince has ordered the kingdom not to interfere with the new spire. I think it would be good for us, if he knew of our quest."

Starguard peers curiously, reading the card. "It's a riddle," he says. "Elisabeth, Elsbeth, Betsy and Bess,/They all went together to see a bird's nest./They found a nest with five eggs in,/They all took one, and left four in." He pauses. "I think I know that one. All those names are derivatives of Elizabeth. So it's one person, not four, really."

Yuri looks puzzled. "'The land was white, the seed was black, I will make a good scholar, to riddle me that.' This one's a riddle as well, but it's more obscure.

Starguard says, "I've got it. A die. White fields with pips, or seeds."

Tilara nods to Yuri. "Ah. Good point. It's just... do we want to come to his attention?" She opens her card as well. 'Fire, Water, Earth, and Air, and every customer takes two pair.'"

Yuri blinks. "Perhaps. There's an image of a scroll, that the riddle is written on, and just an image of a flower inside."

Starguard nods. "Same as mine, Yuri. The only difference is in the riddles.

Starguard peers at Tilara. "Now that one's interesting..."

Yuri says, "I wonder if these are related to Samaela, or to some other oddity. These were in the library? Where did they come from, before that?""

Andreth squints at his own card, his lips moving as he reads silently, then he reads aloud. "A shoemaker / makes shoes / Without Leather, / With all the / four elements / Put together," he reads. He opens the card. "And the same flower inside."

Starguard grins at Andreth. "That one's easy. The fire, the water to cool it, the metal of the earth, and the air of the bellows makes..."

Tilara says, "Horseshoes."

Starguard nods at Tilara. "Or so I think..."

Andreth shakes his head, as Starguard trails off, not comprehending. Then his face lights up as Tilara speaks, and he nods.

Tilara says, "That's what mine means, too. Horseshoes. It's almost like two parts of the same riddle."

Yuri says, "Well, if every customer takes two pair, then that would definitely be horseshoes. The typical horse has four feet."

Ash blinks at his own card, reading it aloud. "..Odd.."

Andreth scratches his head at Starguard's riddle. "Four names for the same person... the four spires?"

Starguard nods. "Certainly a lot of fours, aren't there?"

Yuri says, "And you need all four elements to make a horseshoe."

Ash rereads it, struggling at the meaning as the words form on his lips. "Formed long ago, yet made today. Employed while other sleep. What few would like to give away, Nor any wish to keep.."

Yuri writes down the riddles on a parchment, for his notes.

Yuri asks again, "Where did these cards come from?"

Yuri says, "Dreams, perhaps?"

Rolwen shrugs. "Palla found them. He is usually good at discerning intuitions ... so I followed his lead."

Starguard peers at the blue rose, on the inside of his card. "Blue rose. Why does that ring a bell?"

Andreth says, "My own is yellow..."

The abbot looks intrigued by the cards. "Yes ... if Palla thinks they should go to you, then we give them with our blessing ..."

Tilara says, "Mine is yellow..."

Ash holds up his as well. "Yellow. Though it helps me not."

Starguard blinks. "Mine is the only blue one?

Yuri says, "Mine is green, also. Although the blossom on the rose is more yellow-ish."

Yuri says, "What color are the scrolls, on each? Mine seems to be copper-colored."

Andreth says, "Likewise..."

Starguard says, "Mine is copper as well."

Tilara looks at Starguard. "Maybe yours is the center, and each of the others relates somehow. Mine's got a copper scroll, too."

Starguard frowns. "Anyone remember seeing a blue rose, anywhere? Abbot? Does the blue rose mean anything to you?"

The abbot shakes his head. "I've never heard of a blue rose. The closest is carmine."

Tilara says, "Don't look at me. Red and white and yellow ones is all I've ever heard of."

Starguard says, "It's possible to create a blue rose, but they're strange. And often artificial, made by letting a white rose cutting soak up dye."

The abbot listens intently. "I would say, young Starguard, that Palla has found a worthy riddle for you."

Yuri sighs. "We can consider it while we travel. Is it safe to assume we're going to Citadel via the most direct route? That's days away."

Starguard nods. "A blue rose and an Elizabeth. A strange combination to be sure."

Rolwen nods. "Citadel is a long ways away. You'll be traveling for weeks."

Tilara says, "Weirdly symbolic, perhaps." She nods. "Citadel is quite a ways off."

Ash laughs suddenly. "What's employed every night? I was commanded to make every day - \`today' - my bed!"

Andreth hmms. "Dunno if the latter half fits - who wouldn't want to keep a bed?"

Starguard says, "No one wants to give it away, though. And they don't want to keep it with them..."

Yuri says, "Perhaps... this is... confusing..."

Tilara says, "Well, that covers the made today and employed while others sleep bits, but .... hmmm. The rest doesn't match. Punning? A sleeping bed vs. a flower bed or an oyster bed?"

Yuri holds his head for a moment, then nudges away his ale, and begins drinking water instead.

Starguard says, "Elizabeth, beds, horseshoes..."

Andreth shakes his head. "I weren't ever any good at riddles."

Tilara says, "And dice."

Starguard says, "And blue roses. What these have to do with each other is beyond me. Why were we given these, father? They were drawn to us, you said, can you explain it?""

The abbot shakes his head. "We've learned, over the years, to trust Palla's intuitions. But we don't know from when they spring.

The feast eventually winds down in the late afternoon, and the party troops into the library. Perhaps a few more answers remain.

Starguard notes a map on the wall. "Before we go searching for blue roses, let's figure out where we're going tomorrow."

Tilara sends Mirra to do battle with more rodents and looks at the map over Starguard's shoulder. "Good idea. I went overland the last time, we were looking for lots of little towns to play in."

Yuri says, "That's a good idea. We've got some serious traveling to do."

Ash shrugs dismissively. "There's more people in towns to ask about this matter if we go overland, but asking the fish as we sail seems useless."

Tilara says, "That's not really the quickest way to do it, I'm sure... " She stares at the map for a while. "Either overland, down the Agla River, or ..." She trails down the river that the monastery overlooks. ".. down this river through Lurinor, if we can get past the border safely. Does anyone else speak Lurinese?"

Yuri says, "I do. Starguard does. But... I don't know, that sounds awfully dangerous."

Starguard shakes his head. "I've been cursed in it, on occasion, but I don't speak it."

Andreth shakes his head.

Yuri says, "Ash makes a point. We can pick up more information going overland. Boats are faster, of course, but will it be much faster?"

Tilara nods. "Don't want to go through Lurinor if we can help it, then, even if it is a shorter route. Getting chopped up isn't on my list of things to do again. Boats aren't that much faster, unless you're carrying bulk goods. The water route is about twice as long. Look how the river swings around."

Firestorm looks downcast. "I ... speak only the tongue of Calais ...

Starguard says, "I think Lurinor is right out, as well. I've been down on that front. They don't look all that friendily upon foreigners."

Starguard says, "But the river...well, it's harder to be robbed in the middle or a river."

Tilara grins at Firestorm and reaches out to ruffle his hair. "Then you can talk to any Calaisians we meet, Stormy. The rest of us don't."

Tilara says, "As long as the boatmen are honest...."

Firestorm grins back. "And I'll translate everything. I promise."

Yuri says, "Then I guess we should go overland. And get our swords sharpened."

Tilara says, "Doesn't booking passage on a riverboat cost money? We may not have a choice."

Firestorm looks up. "They have a smith here."

Starguard hrms. "Well, either way, we need to get to here." He taps a fork on the map. "Perfirin. So that's our first goal, no?"

Tilara nods. "Aye. Perfirin. Should be able to pick up a bit of cash juggling there, too, as we go through."

Andreth clasps his hands together. "Or not swords, as may be. Though much of what I've learned of late has grown fuzzy... I fear I'll need to learn it once more."

Yuri says, "Maybe we should visit the smith, then. I'm feeling the need for something heavier than a rapier."

Starguard nods. "We need to prepare. We also need to look up blue roses."

Tilara nods. "I think so. I'll sketch the map while you look up roses, if that's allowed. Be nice to have a copy of it on the road."

Yuri says, "Andreth, do these monks also practice unarmed combat? Perhaps you can spar while we get packing."

Yuri says, "Although... most of our food from Woolwich, we still have. We didn't get very far."

Rolwen smiles at Tilara. "By all means, make a copy. Let me take the map down for you, and bring it to the table ..."

Andreth shakes his head. "Dunno... I could ask around, though. Oughta do that, anyway."

Tilara smiles at Rolwen. "Thank you, sir! I'll be careful with it."

Starguard says, "There are guards, and us. I suspect we're all rusty after nearly a week in here."

Rolwen nods, and watches as Tilara works.

Tilara is very careful with the map, measuring off distances from the edges of the document and marking the equivalent points on her copy, not getting the ink anywhere near the original.

The party studies, and prepares the evening through...
