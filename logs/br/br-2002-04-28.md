Game Log: Chapter 20 - Red River Town


-----------------------------------------

After a restful night, spent sleeping in the Cells lining the Great Hall, the party turns its face south westward. It's time, everyone had decided, to go to Citadel. The minor matter of the geas was just added incentive. Yuri had spent a great deal of time, yesterday, writing up letters for Brother Oak and for his own family, whilst the others had spent an instructive evening in the library. Much had been learned, although none of it seemed really relevant.

Spring is beginning to gentle the land, and Brother Sun is beaming down upon the earth today, providing good traveling weather. With the healthy Andreth leading the way, the party retraces the steps that Gerrold's horses once took. Travel goes slower on foot, though, and the day passes slowly.

Following the path is easier on foot, though the bushes press close and the wilderness seems keen to retake the land. Birds sing, overhead, in a mating call, and in the distance you hear loud thuds.

Yuri sighs. "Hey, Ash, you're petty good with the outdoors, right? Is there any way we can keep the wolves off our back?"

Tilara says, "And what's making that odd noise?"

Ash hrms. "Well yes, we can ride horses or stay in a wagon. That's the best way to avoid the natural hazards of the road."

Yuri hmms. "Maybe we should look into a wagon, then. Although at the moment we're somewhat cash-poor."

Yuri says, "What noise?"

Tilara says, "Those thuds." She waits for the next one. "_That_ noise."

The thuds sound like the banging together of great tree trunks, or large wooden clubs. And then there's a high pitched inhuman scream. The sound comes from well into the bush.

Yuri says, "I'm feeling sword-shy after this week. Do we want to fight or hide?"

Tilara says, "You left out run. Let's be somewhere else, okay?"

Ash says, "Someone's beating on something. I'm at least going to go look."

Starguard frowns, wincing at the scream. "But we can't just..."

Ash is already moving. "Come, those who want. If I yell run, run."

Firestorm moves closer to Tilara, staying on the path.

Andreth stares off in the direction of the scream, thinking... then Ash's move makes the decision. He moves in behind Ash, careful not to make a sound.

Starguard follows behind, moving quickly. He's right behind Ash, hand on his crossbow, making sure it's loaded.

Yuri shrugs. _Well, someone's gotta make the choice._ He follows Ash, stepping lightly.

Pushing his way through the bushes, Ash soon disappears from sight and he travels over a small rise. Andreth follows behind him, as together they top another rise. Beyond, in a small open area, they see two massive stags, fighting.

Tilara sighs. _Better go keep an eye on them, Mirra. I'll follow along behind._ She motions Stormy to stay with her and brings up the rear.

Ash hunkers down immediately, peeking over the rise but trying not to let too much of his scent into the wind overhead. "Look at that," he breathes in appreciation.

Yuri says, "Wow. They're big. Do they ever attack humans?"

Andreth breathes a small sigh of relief. "I'd rather not find out," he says softly, smiling a little. "Let's be on our way, no?"

Ash says, "Hmm? Them? Doubt it. They don't fight anything but wolves and each other. But with them out here, wolves won't trouble us so soon. Let's move."

Yuri says, "That's good news. Let's go."

Starguard nods. "Nothing serious."

Andreth is already heading back for the path.

Tilara peers at the stags. "Impressive. But I thought the fawns were born in spring. Why are they fighting now?"

Starguard shrugs. "Just to prove who's alpha male, Til."

Tilara looks enlightened. "Okay. You boys better not start doing that, though. Understand?"

Yuri says, "Alpha male? Never mind. I don't want this geas to think that we're dawdling."

Retracing their steps, the party regains the path. As the afternoon wears on clouds begin to gather overhead, threatening a thunderstorm. Or maybe two. As the first drops begin to fall, the party sights Two Crossings.

Starguard looks up, getting a raindrop in the eye. "Let's get into town and under cover. Ale and meat at the inn would be nice. We won't get it on the road."

Yuri says, "I like that idea. Who knows how many chances we'll get on this trip?"

Tilara says, "A few. Most of these little towns have an inn of some sort. Maybe I can do some juggling."

Named for the way it lies athwart two roads, Two Crossings barely qualifies as a village, let alone a town. Primarily it consists of a small inn and a smaller temple, while the third building on the green is the communal threshing barn. A few other houses dot the landscape, but most farms live on their land.

Ash nods in agreement. "We can't quest if we don't rest."

Yuri says, "We were here a few days ago. It hasn't changed."

Starguard snorts. "I suspect that the town hasn't changed much since Limera popped in for a drink on her way to somewhere else ages ago."

The inside of the inn is as dispiriting as it was before. It wasn't just Andreth's demise that made it seem gloomy; the inn simply is squalid. Although the smells from the kitchen are mouth-watering. A girl saunters out into the common room. "Sir?"

Yuri says, "We'd like rooms. There are six of us."

Starguard says, "And food and drink as well."

She smiles, uncertainly. "We have two small rooms, sir, though they each come with only one bed. But food, and drink, sir, we have aplenty. As long as you'll have ale and stew, of course.

Yuri says, "It will suffice, if we may sleep on the floor. Other tenants are unlikely this night."

Tilara says, "It smells delicious. We'll manage a place to sleep somehow."

The girl looks relieved. "We'll be happy to host ye, sirs and lady. Perhaps the lady would like one of the rooms? Or each room can sleep three if ye do not mind being close."

The girl disappears back into the kitchen, returning with bowls of stew and tankards of ale. The taste of stew and ale matches the smells emanating from the kitchen. As darkness falls, a fwe men straggle into the common room, putting down silver for the food and eyeing the strangers curiously.

Yuri watches the girl to see how she reacts to the men.

Ash eats heartily, not caring one way or the other who came in just now. All he wants is something warm in his belly - and an answer to the question he's been charged with, as recent events have stamped themselves indelibly on the forefront of his thoughts.

The girl smiles at each of the men, as they come in, putting down tankards and sometimes bowls of stew. Obviously regular customers, she frequently has the food ready before they can order.

Starguard relaxes. He's been in this type of in before. No trouble if you keep to yourself.

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "Must be the locals. I wonder if we should introduce ourselves."

One of the men sits down close to Tilara, occasionally glancing at her from underneath his hood.

Tilara shakes her head. "Let them make the first move, I think. Here... this should do it." She gets out her gear when she's finished eating and practices a few bits of juggling.

Yuri rolls his eyes. _Not AGAIN._

The men watch, relaxing, as they obviously now what they're dealing with now. One of them raises a cup: "A song, jongleurs! A song!"

Another of the men, after watching for a few moments, slips out.

Tilara blinks at that, and looks at her companions. "Anyone up to singing tonight?"

Ash shakes his head quickly in mid-swallow; his stew-spoon wiggles in a vain attempt to escape capture.

Stormy blushes a little. "I could give them the ballad of Wyshing Welles, m'Lady."

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "I could probably fake a duet with you. Or do you want to do it alone?"

Andreth shakes his head silently. He's definitely one of those not-even-in-a-bucket sorts.

Tilara grins. "You can? Well, good, then. You sing, and I'll do the juggling." She bows to the room. "I am Tilara, mistress of juggling and legerdemain. My young companion here is learning to be a bard, but his musical mentor is no longer with us, so I cannot make any promises about his ability. We shall do our best to entertain you this evening."

Stormy stands, mostly hidden by Tilara's balls, and begins to clap his hands together slowly. As the men begin to join him, he begins to chant an ancient lay about the dangers of wishing ... As he comes to the end he begins to blush, and abruptly sits down, noticing that his audience has swelled. The room is now brimming with young men, laughing and clapping and singing along.

A young man bursts into song now, singing a very bawdy ballad about the teats on the Mayor's cow ...

Ash almost chokes on his stew. Apparently low humor is still the center of his experience.

Tilara grins. _And we're off to a good start._ She starts her own routine in earnest, juggling in time to the song.

The evening passes pleasurably, between Tilara's juggling, and singing from all sides. When the thunderstorm finally breaks late in the evening, however, the men disperse as quickly as they came, leaving behind a handful of coppers for the party. Bedrolls are quickly arranged, and the party is soon asleep, and sleeping the night through.

Starguard notably, sleeps in Andreth's room, insisting that he gets the bed, not completely sure that he's healed yet.

Andreth feels good as new, but humors Starguard without complaint.

Tilara is content with any donations at all, having expected that the locals have very little ready cash. She drops off to sleep thinking, _A good practice session, if naught else. And young Firestorm can sing. Who would've thought...._

In the morning, the smell of fresh bread pervades the inn, waking the party and stoking appetites. Breaking the fast is a matter of fresh bread and hard cheese, and the girl approaches Brother Starguard about the matter of payment for the night.

Starguard smiles, and gently guides the girl over to Yuri, who has been keeping the finances.

Yuri hmms? "Ah, yes. The matter of payment."

The girl blushes a little, and nods. "Six good meals last night, sir, and sig breakfasts, and all of ye sleeping here. 'Tis ..." She gulps, visibly. "Comes to two gold, sir. And a silver."

Yuri frowns ever so slightly. "Now, you wouldn't be trying to take advantage of some strangers addled by a hard road, now would you? How do you know that we're that well heeled?"

The girl shakes her head. "It's not ... we're ... it's just, sir, there's so many of you. And cook says we're to charge 3 silver a person for supper and a night's roofing."

The girl stammers "breakfast, sir!" before fleeing into the back room.

Starguard says, "Three times six is eighteen, dear. One gold, eight silver."

A large woman, flour dotting her apron, comes waddling out of the kitchen, one eyebrow raised. "I'll not have you frighten my gr'daughter, lads."

Yuri says, "I'm not of a mood to argue with you. I just want to know what your business is."

Yuri fishes out two gold and two silver and plunks them on a table.

Yuri says, "Spend the other silver on a tutor for the young miss, there."

The woman smiles. "We provide good food, and a roof that doesnae leak. But we appreciate your custom; winter stores are low and the harvest's a long time yet. And aye, she'll take it to temple this afternoon. She's going ta be better than I ever was."

Andreth just scratches his head. He's having a hard time following the advanced mathematics, but he knows where he stands with breakfast.

After the woman waddles back into the kitchen, the girl is sent out with a small pot of honey to cover the bread.

Starguard frowns. "You should lower you rate a bit, especially since we shared your rooms. It's a good day when you take a gold in, I bet. Never mind two."

Tilara says, "Next time we check the rates first. Hard to haggle when you've already eaten the food."

Yuri says, "Guess I'm too used to knowing the town beforehand."

The weather is not near as pleasant as the fresh bread; cloud cover is low and the rain is pouring down.

Yuri keeps his hood over his head and tries to avoid stepping in puddles.

Ash mumbles to himself. "We'll probably have to buckle down and do some work along the way, at this rate," he remarks openly. "Unless we resort to brigandry." The tension that might fill any honest man's voice at the suggestion is notably absent.

Tilara sighs. "Not a nice day. But it won't get any better waiting here, and we've got places to go." Mirra complains bitterly until she agrees to carry her under her cloak, where it's at least a little bit drier.

Yuri says, "I hope it doesn't come to that, Ash. I'd rather be a hunter of brigands. Pays almost as well and has just as much job security."

The road is easy enough to follow though, and the girl is happy enough to point out which road leads to Red River Town, adding that there's campsites along the way, since it's a long day's walk.

Starguard chuckles dryly, the chuckle about the only dry thing in sight. "At least we won't get robbed in this weather. No self-respecting bandit would be out in it."

Ash laughs. "You know why most hungry men turn bandit instead of bandit-hunter? Caravans are easier to locate than outlaws. Simple matter of effort required."

Yuri says, "How about wolves? I hope they don't like rain."

Tilara says, "I suspect they don't. But neither do we, and we're out in it. Let's keep our eyes open, eh?"

Starguard grins. "Unless they're really hungry, they'll probably be inside too. However, the ducks may be out. Keep an eye up? Maybe we can catch dinner as we go."

The rain continues to pelt the party all day, before finally letting up in late afternoon. Between the mud and the wind, the going has been slow, and Red River Town is not yet in sight. On the other hand, the party does spot what looks like the glow of a bonfire, in a copse of trees.

Yuri hmms. "Maybe I should check it out before we all go tromping in."

Tilara says, "Sounds like a plan. See how many there are?"

Starguard nods. "If you need us, yell loud."

Yuri slips into the trees, watching his step as he slides closer to the bonfire. Once he can see the fire, he pauses, listening, before advancing further. But all he can see is a huge somewhat bonfire, lighting up the sky.

Yuri says, "It looks like a camp, but there's nobody there. It might just be one person, in which case he'll be back soon."

Stormy watches Yuri return, and looks confused.

Tilara says, "If it's one person who wandered off while leaving that fire burning, he needs a keeper."

Yuri says, "What's wrong, Stormy?"

Starguard frowns. "Something's not right here."

Yuri says, "Well, we going to check it out or go around?"

Stormy shrugs. "I don't know. How's the site look? Good for camping?

Tilara says, "I noticed that. Do you sense something?"

Yuri says, "There's a shelter and wood already cut."

Andreth says, "Funny weather to be campin' in."

Tilara just raises an eyebrow at Andreth's comment. "You don't say."

Yuri says, "Then maybe he's a bigger fool than we are. Either way, we have to make a decision."

Starguard shrugs. "Well, that fire could burn the forest down, so we might as well tend it."

Yuri looks around quickly to see if anyone strongly objects.

Ash nods quietly. "You folks tend it, I'll be roaming around the edges."

Tilara says, "There is that... And it's getting fairly late. Just... let's be careful."

Yuri says, "You sure you want to go alone, Ash?"

Ash laughs. "My company's not the best, but I won't turn down any volunteers. Still, not too many - no point in a fire that nobody's near."

Yuri says, "I'll go with you, then. The rain won't make me less sneaky if we need it."

Andreth says, "Dunno who's settin' fires out here, but whoever it is, good or ill, won't be likin' us hoverin' round it, I'm thinkin'."

Starguard chuckles. "What I want to know is how it got going so high in this weather?"

After discussing the fire between themselves, Ash and Yuri decide to patrol the perimeter while the rest of the party takes advantage of the fire to make a campsite. Given the weather, this is likely the only available dry firewood.

The fire is blazing merrily in the middle of the open area, while the wood is sheltered under some branches off by the side.

Meanwhile Ash and Yuri slowly prowl along the perimeter, listening intently. And all they hear is the sound of water dropping off leaves. Sometimes dropping right down their necks.

Starguard peers curiously at the fire.

Yuri sighs. "We're not seeing anything. Let's go back."

Starguard sniffs. "Sulphur?" Moving back, he tries to face both the fire and the wood. Quietly, he mutters, concentrating on his holy symbol. "Stars, make magic sparkle to my eyes like you do. Detect Magic."

Starguard blinks, his eyes snapping open. "By the Stars!" He blinks, looking for a source of water to put the flames out, to check what he saw.

Andreth was looking out into the darkness. Turning at Starguard's exclamation, he catches some of the older cleric's astonishment. "What? What is it?"

Stormy sidles closer to Tilara, looking worried.

Starguard says, "Damn it. It's a feather portal! Like the brazier!"

Tilara starts at Starguard's exclamation. "What? This big?" She casts her own dweomer to detect magic and then gets her shovel from her pack. "Couldn't be Ferg, could it?"

Starguard says, "I thought I saw a feather in there. It could be the same group!"

Andreth immediately begins gathering handfuls of mud to throw onto the blaze, as quickly as he can. "It's much bigger this time..."

Starguard gahs, and pauses. "It's fading though. I think they're already gone, but..."

Tilara says, "This explains why there's nobody here, though." She starts shoveling. "You think that fellow who snuck out early last night is involved?"

Stormy follows the party lead, and starts throwing mud at the fire. The branches begins to shift, as the fire belches smoke and sparks.

Tilara nods. "Just about gone. It's brief, however it works. I wonder... let's keep those feathers safe. We might just want to use them sometime to follow one of these folks."

The fire eventually gets buried in a layer of mud, sputtering to a close. At this point, Ash and Yuri rejoin the party ...

Yuri says, "We didn't see anything... hey, what happened to the fire?"

Andreth shakes his head at Tilara, throwing one last handful of mud on. "Not till we know where they're goin'." He looks up as Yuri and Ash return...

Starguard blinks. "Follow someone who may be an enemy into a portal? Erm... Let's put it this way, Yuri. Remember the brazier? This is the extra-large version."

Yuri says, "Uh oh. You mean person-sized, don't you?"

Starguard nods. "Looks about right to me."

Tilara says, "We think so."

Ash blinks owlishly. "Someone... jumped into a fire?"

Yuri says, "I wonder if that one guy in the inn used it."

Tilara says, "That was my thought, too. And, well... we might want to toss something through a portal after an enemy. Not follow ourselves."

Yuri looks around. "Is this an ordinary campsite, or someplace they might use regularly?"

Ash frowns. "No sense in wasting a good campsite, though, no matter what was done with the fire earlier."

Yuri sighs. "If any old fire will do... then potentially any fire-circle is a portal. At least one way."

Yuri says, "I wonder what's special about the other end."

Starguard shrugs. "Anyway, let's avoid burning the feathers for now?"

Tilara nods. "And I doubt they built the whole place just to jump from. They did say there were campsites along the road. Probably safe enough to stay here now. Did you find any water?"

Yuri says, "Yes. We have to press on. But I think perhaps we've been given reason to keep a low profile."

Yuri says, "Only what's in the trees, Til."

Andreth says, "Maybe we should re-light the fire?"

Tilara says, "Just a small one, though. At least there's plenty of wood."

Stormy looks around. "We could make a smaller fire over here, if we shift a few of the rocks. It'll be safe." with that, he begins to tug at some of the rocks around the old fire.

Starguard nods. "I'll start supper. He frowns at the wood. "There's a bit of sulphur on this stuff, I'm afraid.

Yuri says, "Probably to make it easier to light in the rain. Not a bad idea, if you can afford it."

Tilara says, "Keep that in mind. It might be part of the magic with the feathers, too."

Stormy grins. "I can think of a better way to make it burn. Good practice, too." After piling up a few branches, he holds out both hands, thumb to thumb, and looks at the wood. After a few moments, flames spring out and engulf the branches.

Yuri says, "Hey, Stormy's getting better about control."

Tilara blinks. "That's very good, Stormy. I think you've got it."

Stormy grins, while stepping aside so that Starguard can cook a splendid supper, after which everybody huddles under the tarp and tried to sleep.

The night passes, slowly but surely, while the fire burns slowly. And morning dawns, with the cloud cover still intact.

Ash awakens, sleepy but determined to enjoy the day anyway.

Stormy bounds up, relieved that the night passed safely. "Do you think we'll hit Red River Town today, Yuri? Gonna visit your brother's fiancee?"

Tilara wakes up, feeling damp and bedraggled after the previous day. "Well, here we are again. You think we should change routes? Might give whoever it is a problem tracking us."

Yuri is already awake, having spent the watch pondering what he's gotten his friends into.

Yuri says, "I don't think so. I think it would be better to travel fast. Whoever they are, they can move faster than us and will find us if we hide."

Starguard stretches, breakfast on the go already. "We don't know which way we're going yet, do we? How can they? Perfirin was where we were going to decide the water or land route."

Yuri says, "As to my brother's fiancee... well, we can't afford to take too much time from the quest. So only if we pass by."

Tilara sighs. "Well, let's go, then. They'll be waiting in Perfirin for us now that they know we're on this road."

Yuri says, "I wonder if we can throw them off somehow... maybe show up in a way they wouldn't expect."

Rejoining the road, the party reaches Red River Town by late morning.

_Red River Town is even larger than Woolwich, sporting an actual wall around the town proper. There are two main gates in the wall; one facing the road, the other the river, which is as red as the town's name suggests. Both gates are manned by guards wearing breastplates and carrying pikes._

Yuri says, "Wow. Woolwich doesn't have anything like this. I didn't think they were this big."

Tilara chuckles. "Wait till you see Citadel."

Yuri nods.

As the party approaches, a guard challenges them. "Halt! State your business."

Yuri guesses that he's the one doing the talking, and steps forward. "We are travellers, come from Woolwich, and we seek lodging."

The guard smiles. "Well met then. We're planning a faire a week's hence; you've arrived early. Town's under peace bond, of course. Step into the hut, and we can tie your weapons."

Yuri looks at the others, and then steps in.

Ash will follow, of course.

Andreth follows as well, though of course he bears no blade.

Inside the hut, a young blacksmith ties a strong cable around each weapon, sealing it in its scabbard. The cable is held together with a blob of melted lead, pressed around the ends.

Tilara doesn't have a weapon-sized blade, but submits her crossbow to the smith if they're concerned about it. "You don't need to seal up my juggling knives, do you? It spoils the act."

The guard shakes his head. "No miss; I'm sure your juggling knives are dulled. If not, we can apply a thin strip of lead to their edges, to make them safe."

Starguard shrugs, his mace and crossbow brought forward. He's not totally dependent on weapons, after all. Faith is also a weapon.

Yuri unlimbers himself of half a dozen daggers and knives. "Not sure how you want to do these..."

Tilara grins. "They are. I do occasionally miss."

The young man blinks a moment, then hauls out a leather sack. "If you'll place them in here, sir? And we'll seal the bag. Those are nice knives."

Yuri does as he's told.

The weapons are quickly peacebonded, and the guard welcomes you to the town.

Ash thinks. "They'll have men of learning in this town, travellers of all kinds... we'd best ask at the inn, then wherever scholars gather."

Moving inside the walls, the party is faced with a plethora of streets. People are hurrying here and there, and a small stall is selling sausages in buns. Beside it, a second is selling hot mulled wine.

Yuri hmms. "Well, I'd like to find out where my brother's fiancee lives... but I guess any inn would know that."

Starguard watches the crowd, and his purse, noting the rather thick crowd. "Just ask, Yuri. You know her last name?"

Tilara says, "And see what they have in the way of books and learning. We can search around for a little while without having the geas activate on us." She looks sheepish. "Wasn't paying attention to that the last time I went through."

A small urchin approaches the party, after obviously noting that the party is standing still and looking around. "Need a guide, sir?"

Yuri looks around quickly to see if other urchins are watching.

Yuri says, "We could use a quiet inn, and we'd like to know where the Pjurins live."

The urchin's face lights up. "There's lots of inns. Are you looking for a fine inn or a simple one, sir? And the Pjurins? They'll be in the Merchant's Quarter. I could bring you there first."

Yuri holds out a few coppers to the kid. "Simple inn, as long as it's got baths. Lead us there first."

Yuri says to the others, "I don't know about you, but after all the rain, I feel muddy. I don't want to go and play matchmaker like that."

Starguard shrugs. "I'm sure they know the road is hard, Yuri."

Starguard says, "Or soft after the rain, as the case may be."

The urchin carefully caches the coppers. "This way, sirs. The Swan's Neck is famed far and wide for her bath houses. They have two, sir, so the lady can bathe ta the same time."

Tilara says, "That's no reason to show up looking like we're too poor to afford a bath."

Yuri grins. "I've had a soft life, Starguard. Who knows how long I'll be able to keep it that way?"

Ash frowns a little. "No harm in bathing, either way. We took several days to travel about; a few more hours won't make a difference, right?"

Starguard shrugs. "Fine, fine. Though army showers, weekly, are more my style."

Yuri lets the urchin lead them, and hastily scribbles a note.

The urchin leads the party down one of the main streets, coming closer to the center of town, before dashing down a side street. He waits for the party to catch up, pointing out two temples, the bazaar, and Dyer's Lane along the way. Stopping before the Swan's Neck, he smiles. "They have lots of rooms here, and excellent food. And bath houses at all times." Recognized by a man standing in the doorway, the urchin steps up to whisper in his ear.

The man straightens, and approaches. "Well met, travellers, and welcome to the Swan's Neck. How may we help?"

Andreth's eyes watch the urchin for a bit, then he nudges Yuri.

Yuri says, "We'd like bath... huh?"

Yuri looks over at Andreth.

Andreth whispers in Yuri's ear.

Andreth whispers, "I think I saw the man slip the urchin a couple coppers. Maybe just a bonus f'r leadin' customers here, but..."

Yuri turns back to the attendant. "First I'd like to know what the custom is about paying finder's fees in this town."

The attendant smiles politely. "Finder's fee? We don't charge a finder's fee. If you mean Charlie here, he ran an errand for me earlier."

Yuri says, "Very well. Then we'd like to know how much for rooms and some baths. It rained heavily last night and I'm sure you can see that the mud has followed us home."

The man nods, smiling. "Indeed it did. So you'd like rooms, and baths. Laundry service, as well?"

Tilara clears her throat. "Possibly. How much?"

The man smiles. "Well, for a party of six, and considering we include breakfast and supper ... that would be 4 gold."

Yuri gives the note and a copper to the kid. "Here. I'd like you to tell me how to get to the Pjurins, and then I'd like you to run this to the Pjurins for me. Don't abuse my goodwill... oh my."

The urchin takes the note, nods, and runs off.

Yuri says, "What if the lady juggles? She's pretty good at putting on a show."

"That will buy you three rooms, of course." The man waits, pointedly not looking at your utter lack of baggage.

"Juggles? You're proposing to entertain? Well, why don't you step inside, and show me how good you play? We usually have a minstrel, but he's fallen sick this past week."

Yuri says, "Good. Perhaps we can come to some arrangement, then."

Tilara says, "Well, I juggle and do a bit of sleight of hand. The boy sings, but he's not a minstrel yet."

_The front door opens into a open hall, where a clerk sits ready, waiting for customers. To the left, a door stands open into the common room, while to the right two flights of stairs lead to hallways on the second floor._

The party steps inside, where Tilara unlimbers the tools of her trade. With Stormy singing behind her, she begins to juggle. The man looks impressed, and turns to Yuri. "Room and board for the entertainers; although if they're to sleep in the same hall, it'll be three gold total. And they keep all tips, of course."

Yuri says, "That sounds reasonable." He fishes out three gold from a purse now filled mostly with copper and silver.

The man takes the money to the clerk, who writes down the amount and asks everyone for their names, to enter in their ledger. Meanwhile the man steps through a door, and moments later a maid arrives, offering to take everyone to their rooms and then the bath house.

_Both bath houses are made along the same scheme. Located at opposite ends of a decorative garden, they each contain two rooms. In the first, large buckets of warm water and a serving maid await to sluice water over each bather until you're clean. The second room contains a large communal tub, contained steaming hot water._

Starguard smiles at the hot water. "Oh, that looks star-sent..."

After dropping off backpacks in the three rooms, the men are dropped off at the one bath house, before Tilara is borne off to the other.

Yuri aaahs. "Well, just because we're living among mud and weeds these days, doesn't mean that we have to like it."

Tilara grins as the boys are led to the other bath. "C'mon, Mirra. Let's get clean."

Yuri says, "I'm wondering what to do about my brother's fiancee. At the very least I want to let the elder sister know that we got Ferg. And then see if there's anything we need to do to get her married off." He frowns for a moment. "Short of having one of us marry her, anyway."

Ash blinks slowly in confusion.

Starguard chuckles. "What, Yuri? Maybe she likes younger men?"

Mirra steps into the bath house, disdaining the services of the maid as she sits down to lick herself properly clean.

Yuri says, "You might not have heard that part, Ash. Ferg... hurt a girl pretty bad. As it turns out, that girl's younger sister, is my younger brother's fiancee."

Ash nods slowly. "I see. That's......... to be expected, I guess."

Yuri says, "We didn't know that when we went after Ferg, it came out after. The younger sister, Elena, can't really get married until the older sister is, and it would be good for me if that could be arranged."

Yuri says, "I talked my brother into taking over my apprenticeship in the weaver's guild, so I think it will be easier to come home again - whenever that might be - if he's happy with his situation."

Andreth bathes in silence, nodding in all the right places.

Stormy just listens, carefully, his head bowed down.

Starguard nods. "Not to mention your brother would be happy. They made a nice couple."

Ash taps the side of his head. "Don't they have regular matchmakers in this town? Where I grew up, you had farmers' daughters coming from miles around and arranging something with my gram, because she knew everybody and could pick the kids best suited for each other. Must have somethin' similar."

Yuri says, "Well, I'm not to sure. It's her embroidery that he likes the most. But I don't think it can hurt to go and spend some time with them."

Stormy sinks deeper into the tub, his head bowed.

Yuri notices Stormy. "Hey, cheer up, kid. Not only are we not that kind of bad, we're doing something about the people who are."

Starguard blinks at Stormy, shaking him. "Are you alright, lad. You don't look so well."

Stormy mutters something, nodding, and then looks at Starguard. "I ... I ... I think I should go to my room. Tilara says I should try to meditate every day."

Yuri receives a reply note from Elena's family.

Stormy stands up, looking shaken, and the speed at which he is moving gives the impression he's fleeing the bath house.

Yuri says, "I really worry about what that kid saw while he was under Ferg's sway."

Andreth sits back, watching Stormy go. "Think maybe someone should go look after him?" he murmurs in a low tone, leaning toward Starguard.

Yuri says, "I also really worry about what Ferg taught that kid about right and wrong."

Mirra, from her vantage point, watches Stormy race to his room. Concerned, she thinks of her mistress. _FireStorm Crying._

Yuri says, "It seems I'm invited to dinner tonight, with Elena's family. I wasn't quite expecting that. I think I'd better go on my own. "

Starguard nods, and gets up, quickly drying himself off, toweling himself off, heading after Stormy...

Tilara blinks at Mirra's comment, and cuts her bath short. "Thanks, love. It better not be something the others said to him."

Yuri gets an uneasy feeling. "In fact, it might be better if I don't mention the White Company to them. And I think that when our geas is up we'd better make it a point to go check on Ferg and make sure he's having a properly miserable life."

Starguard finds Stormy huddled up in a corner of the room he'd been assigned. His eyes are tear streaked when he looks up at Starguard.

Starguard kneels down. "What's wrong, lad?" he asks kindly.

Stormy shakes his head. "You'll hate me. You'll all hate me. I ... I didn't ... I couldn't ... I ... It's no use. You should go on without me."

Tilara gets out of her bathhouse in time to see Starguard chasing after Stormy. _Good, he should be able to help the lad. I'll listen in from around the corner._ She slows down a little, now that she's reasonably sure the boy won't burn the inn down.

Starguard says, "It's alright lad. You're one of us, now. We have all done things we're not proud of. The role of religion is often one of the sympathetic ear..."

Stormy curls up even tighter. "You don't understand! He promised to let me **go!** And then later he laughed, and said he'd changed his mind, and that I was better. But ... but by then ... it ... Oh Starguard!" He breaks out in a torrent of crying.

Starguard hugs the poor lad. "Who did, lad? Ferg? Someone else?"

Stormy nods, hiccuping out a Ferg.

Starguard frowns. "He returned, lad? Come on. Tell me what happened."

Stormy shakes his head. "He always came back. He never let me go. He'll come back again, I know he will." But then Stormy straightens. "But **this** time I will be able to kill him. I'll burn the flesh from his bones; I'll boil the marrow till it runs."

Tilara waits outside, dreading what she fears is coming next. _I knew we should have killed him when we had the chance. Not only a rapist, but a child-abuser. That ... scum._

"The gods have **promised** me the time, Starguard! They **promised**! But how can they promise, when I ... when I helped him?" Stormy crumples up again.

Starguard says, "Yes, lad. But you don't need to kill him yourself. We're here to protect you as well. Andreth, Ash, Yuri, Tilara, myself, even Mirra will help protect you. The Gods? What did they say to you? Was it during the vigil?"

Tilara stands up and quietly knocks on the door. "Stormy? May I come in?"

Stormy nods, hiccoughing. "Tilara ... Tilara said to ask them for time, and they promised. Tilara! She's here! Don't tell her! Promise!"

Starguard says, "I promise, lad. But you and I need to have a long talk. Promise me that tonight, before bed?"

Stormy looks around, looking hunted, before sighing. "I promise, Starguard. I promise. And Tilara", he raises his voice, "please come in."

Starguard nods, and hands the lad his handkerchief, shielding him from the door for a moment...

Tilara opens the door and slips in, with Mirra in her arms. "She saw you running back to the rooms, Stormy, and she told me you were crying. Is something wrong?"

Stormy hurriedly wipes off his face, and tries to lean non-chalantly against the wall. "I'm ... I'm fine, Tilara. The bath was a little ... hot."

Tilara says, "Well, if that's all it was, I'll go get my hair brushed out. We're supposed to be entertaining tonight, remember?"

Stormy nods, straightening up. "I'll be singing. I wish I could play an instrument."

Tilara grins. "Well, maybe we can get you some training. I think you've got the spell down nearly pat. Gestures help you focus, you notice?"

Starguard smiles. "I'll let you two talk shop. I think I could soak these old bones a bit more."

Stormy nods, his voice still a little wobbly. "When I hold my hands just so, I can feel the power building. Thanks, Brother Starguard. I look forward to hearing more about the gods tonight."

Starguard nods. "Always nice to have people show interest."

Tilara turns to let Starguard out of the room, an eyebrow quietly quirked. She mouths _Thank you_ while her back is to the boy.

Starguard winks, facing away, and heads to the tub.

That evening, Yuri disappears to visit with his future in-laws, while the rest of the party tucks in to a splendid supper. Ironically, while the roast beef and side dishes are more elaborate than the stew at the previous inn, they don't taste as good. Afterwards, Tilara and Stormy entertain in the common room until well after midnight, Tilara putting on an act after Stormy goes hoarse from singing too much.

Tilara collects her tips as the evening progresses, never leaving too much out but never picking up all of it, either. At the end, she ends up with 5 gold and 17 silver.

She wanders off to find Yuri. "You still awake?"

Yuri is in his room, still dressed in his finery, mulling over the events of the evening. "For the moment. What's new?"

Tilara drops five gold pieces onto the bed beside him. "Tips. I've got a few silver, too, but I want to give them to Stormy. He's feeling very bad - ask Starguard about it - and I want him to feel that he's being rewarded for his help."

Yuri nods, quietly. "I didn't get to meet Elena's sister. I'm not sure we can help, here."
