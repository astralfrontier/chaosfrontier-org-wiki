Game Log: Chapter 21 - Night Words


--------------------------------------

Tilara smiles as she tallies up the donations from the evening's work. "Not bad, not bad at all, Stormy. You've got a nice voice, you know that? We need to find someone to play for us, so you don't wear yourself out."

Stormy nods, blushing. "Ma always said I sounded like an angel, 'fore she ... well, ummm, maybe I could learn?"

Tilara looks more closely at the boy, and her voice is soft when she asks, "Before she died, Stormy? Is that what happened?"

Stormy nods, again, looking down. "She and pa both. That year when the winter lasted seemingly forever."

Looking at his hands, Stormy looks sideways at Tilara. "Maybe we could find a mandolin, and I could practice on the road?"

Tilara nods. "I remember that one. The year before I had to leave home, it was, and I'm glad it hasn't been that bad since." She finishes counting, and sorts out the fifty silver that she's planning to put back into the Company's funds. "Don't worry about learning to play an instrument. That can be tricky, and you'd probably be better off improving your voice." She counts out 12 silver from the remainder. "And this is for you. Just in case you want to buy something, or there's an emergency. Since you're not part of the Company, officially, you should have some money of your own."

Stormy looks at Tilara, and then at the coins, and then he shakes his head. "I c-can't, Tilara. Wouldn't be right."

Tilara blinks. "Why not? You worked for it, you know. You earned it."

"But the company is paying for my room, and food, and ... and ... and it just ... uh ..."

"Do you really think I could improve on my voice?" Stormy looks shy.

Tilara nods. "Aye, but you're not getting a share of the Company's profits. You deserve something for your help." She grins, and goes with the change of subject. "You can always improve your skills, Stormy. Learn more songs, if nothing else. Performers are always practicing, working up new routines and such."

Stormy nods, eyeing the coins before sweeping them up. "I will, miLady. And thank you. Do you think we'll have time for a little shopping before we leave tomorrow?

Tilara says, "I don't see why not. We may stay a day or two longer, depending on what the others have found out today, and then we'll have plenty of time."

"But ... but won't the geas compel us onwards?" Stormy looks troubled at the mention of people finding things out.

Tilara shakes her head. "No. The geas is that we spend six months searching for the information. We think that going to Citadel will be useful, but if we think we can find information here, the geas will certainly allow us to pursue it."

Tilara says, "And the geas didn't affect us today, even though we were performing rather than actively searching, did it? As long as our activities are coordinated to the end it requires, we'll be fine."

Stormy nods. "You're right; although we did spend the whole day on the road, and Ash and Andreth are out questioning people, and so is Yuri ..."

Tilara says, "Exactly. And we were listening while we were performing... well, I was, at least, and you were when you weren't singing, right? So we're not neglecting it."

Tilara says, "If it turns out that we earn money so the others can look more effectively, the geas will allow it."

Stormy nods again. "Couldn't hear much while I was singing, though. Maybe I can find a songbook while we're here, then? Learn a few new songs?"

Tilara says, "We can certainly look."

Tilara stands up, and runs her fingers through the boy's hair, fondly tousling it. "I'm going to run this over to Yuri before I go to bed. If you want to ask me any questions, or tell me anything, I'll be back in a few minutes, okay?"

Stormy nods, eyeing the bed. "I think I'll just ... go to sleep. I'm awfully " _yawn_ " tired."

Tilara nods. "I'll see you in the morning, then."

Stormy nods again. "G'night, Tilara. And thanks. I've never been paid before."

Tilara chuckles. "You never had an appreciative audience before, I'll bet. Ferg was too interested in what your potential for destruction was, not your potential for creation."

Tilara says, "Goodnight, Firestorm. Sleep well."

Starguard taps on the doorway, peering in. "Stormy? You in here?"

Stormy opens the door slowly. "Brother Starguard ..." He looks apprehensive.

Starguard smiles. "Ah, good. Would you like to talk some more, about..." he trails off, looking at the young lad's face.

Stormy nods slowly. "Why don't we visit the bath house. It'll be quiet."

Starguard nods. "As you'd like, lad. My old bones could use another soak, anyway."

Slipping out of his room, Stormy heads for the bath house. He checks around each corner, trying hard to avoid attracting notice.

Starguard follows slowly, dawdling, letting Stormy set the pace. "Who are you looking to avoid?" he asks after a while...

The bath house looks and is deserted. Lighting a single candle, Stormy checks the water, which is still warm. "I'm sorry; they must have let the fires die down. But it's nice and quiet here. I ... just don't want Tilara to know. Or anyone else, really. You're a priest; you don't tell, do you?"

Starguard shakes his head. "Not confessions. Those are between you and the god that favors you. I'm just the intermediary, a helper."

Stormy sits on the edge of the pool, after pulling up his trews so that his bare feet can dangle in the water. "I ... I don't know. I ... wanted to forget. And then Yuri is going to ... will I ever be able to forget?"

Starguard smiles, settling down beside the boy, working his shoes off. "I suppose you will, my boy. When you get to be my age, you forget a lot of things. There are some things you'll never forget, but time makes any pain fade, blunted. Still there, though."

Stormy looks up through his hair, which is falling forward. "And do you think I'll ever be forgiven? What if ... what if everyone is so disgusted that ..."

"What if they ask me to leave, Brother Starguard? I ... I did bad things."

Starguard says, "Why don't you tell me what things, Stormy? I suspect they're not as bad as you think, but I can't answer without knowing what they are."

Stormy hunches up. "I ... Ferg had me trigger the ambush. I persuaded the girl to come help me ... and then he ambushed her. And several times he used me to start ..." He gulps, turning pale. "I started fires for him."

Starguard says, "Those are pretty bad things alright," Starguard admits as he lets his feet relax in the water. "But it sounds to me that you were in a tough situation. What would have happened if you hadn't triggered the ambush, or started the fires?"

Stormy hunches up even further. "I don't know; I ... I never thought about it. My uncle gave me to Ferg; what else could I do?"

"And when I gained the ability to kindle fires, Ferg was a lot nicer to me. Said I'd finally become useful as more than a bed-warmer and lookout. He even promised to teach me." Stormy pauses, his foot drawing circles in the water, before bitterly continuing. "Or at least, he promised to teach me. And I thought I might be able to buy my freedom ..."

Starguard says, "Well, I'll tell you what I think what would have happened. I think Ferg would have hurt you badly. You were afraid. With no-one to help you. You didn't really have much of a choice. I think that your acts should weigh on Ferg's conscience, not yours."

"But I betrayed her, and she was being nice to me, and ... and ... " Stormy wails.

Starguard pats the poor lad on the back. "It's alright lad. You made a tough decision in a tight spot. I think any of us might have done the same thing in your position."

Stormy hunches over even further. "But what will Yuri say when he finds out? Or Tilara? Will she still teach me?"

Starguard hugs the poor boy. "Oh gods, yes lad. In fact, I suspect that Tilara has been in similar spots. You should ask her about her past. Yuri will understand too, I suspect."

Stormy looks confused. "But ... but ... but I betrayed so many people. Why do you trust me?"

Starguard smiles. "When you betrayed others, it was because you'd get beaten if you didn't. And they weren't really friends, even if they were nice to you. With us...well, I don't think you'd betray Tilara for anything, would you?"

Stormy shakes his head. "Tilara? Milady? never! I'd ... I'd go back to Ferg for her ..."

Starguard nods. "I can see that in you, Stormy. You're a good soul. The others think so too. Even if you've betrayed others, they will understand. Tilara's had to make hard choices to. Ask her about her life, if she'll tell you."

Stormy's eyes shine, as he looks up. "You really think so? And ... maybe I will. But do I have to tell Yuri?"

Starguard chuckles. "I don't see why you'd have to. I haven't told him about all my army stories."

Stormy looks relieved, and still hunched over. "I'll just stay out of sight when he visits family. And some day I'll find a way to make it right. What Ferg did; I hated it when he ... and then ... and ... I'll just **have** to make it right."

Starguard blinks. "You mean it was _that_ girl?" His eyes widen. "Yuri's soon to be sister-in-law that you set the ambush for?"

Stormy looks down, nodding. "I ... I think so."

Starguard blinks. "Oh. My." He kicks his feet in the water. "I think that we better let Yuri know after all. Before he hears it from elsewhere. But keeping you out of sight when she's her might be a good idea..."

"Will you tell him, Starguard? I ... I don't think I can."

Starguard nods. "Perhaps I should at that." He smiles. "Feel better to let that out lad?"

Stormy nods. "A little. Not ... not much. But since the vigil I haven't dreamed ..."

---

Setting out for dinner, Yuri nervously straightens his vest. This is the first time he's mingled with the upper crust since he ran out on his father, and the Pjurin's might have heard more about that by now. Arriving at the walled enclosure, he announces himself to the guard.

Obviously expected, a page leads Yuri inside, where he joins the family in the parlor. Elena, recognizing him, stands up and walks towards him, smiling. "Yuri! We were so glad to hear you were in town. How are you?"

Yuri grins brightly, not letting his troubles show. "I'm doing quite well, thank you. My friends and I were traveling in this direction and I thought it would be a capital idea to ask after your family."

Elena smiles. "Your brother is doing well; he writes every chance he gets. He's worried about you, though."

Yuri lets his grin flag slightly. "Well... we've had some dangerous moments. But so far we've managed to get through them in one piece. I've written a few letters back to my family to explain what's happening. I don't want them to worry, although I fear that father will be a long time in understanding."

Yuri says, "I must admit that I'm not as familiar with your family as you are with mine. Will you be introducing me?"

"You're quite right, please, come meet my parents. Mother, Father, this is Yuri. He's Ilya's older brother. Yuri, this is my mother Anyanka and my father Minas Pjurin." The older couple nods, and smiles. 'And my brother Silkun, Yuri." She ruffles the hair of a young boy, scarcely ten years old. "My sister Ani won't be joining us.

Yuri grins, bows and shakes hands, as appropriate. "The pleasure is mine. I hope everyone is well."

After a few more pleasant exchanges, the butler informs madame that supper is served. She leads the way, with Yuri on her arm, to an elegant dining room, and seats him at her left, so she can ask him all about Ilya. Much of the conversation centers around Yuri's younger brother, as he is being politely, and subtly, interrogated about his family. As the desserts are served, she turns to Yuri again. "But forgive me, for prating so much of your brother. What of yourself? Are you traveling on behalf of your father, or the guild?"

Yuri grins a half-grin. "Ilya is a good man. Diligent, talented, and honest. While I am also these things, my talents are in different directions. On whose behalf I'm traveling is a complicated question, and at the moment it seems my friends and I are doing so on behalf of the Brothers of the Waters."

Yuri ponders, _I wonder if they'll believe it. It seems so strange even to me_

Anyanka raises her brow. "The Brothers? You travel on illustrious business, young man. Can you tell us about it?"

Yuri says, "One of our number - Andreth, a monk - was greviously injured just a day out of Woolwich. We brought him to the Brothers for healing, and agreed, as payment, to travel to Citadel for them. There's a spire there - perhaps you've heard of it - and its meaning eludes the Abbot, even though he is wise and has many agents."

Yuri says, "In truth, I'm confused why he'd consider us to be worthy of the task, when so many others have been able to divine so little, but it seems he has faith in our talent at locating lost things."

"Only one spire?" Minas's voice booms down the table. "I thought there were three?"

Anyanka smiles. "Well, young man, where will you begin to look?"

Yuri grins. "There were three. Now there are four. The newest is small, yet, and has only one word on it, which we think is a name."

Anyanka nods, while Minas listens, obviously waiting.

Yuri leans back and steeples his fingers, honestly considering the question, and answers Anyanka slowly. "With the tops of the other spires. Each one has a story to tell, as does the new one. Perhaps there will be some common thread that will give context to the name. Beyond that... I know not. I'm sure speculation around Citadel will be rife, and everyone will have their own opinion."

Yuri thinks, _How to get the message to them, that Ferg was jailed. They'll want to know._

Yuri folds his hands. "Much of this is new to me. The currents of rumor in Woolwich progressed much more simply, it seems."

Minas turns to his son. "Listen to the rumors, boy. Sometimes they're true." Anyanka, noticing that dessert have been finished, suggests that the party remove to the sitting room. Elena will play a little on the harp.

Yuri follows the Pjurins into the sitting room, and looks for a seat, trying not to be obviously opposite any one person. In the end he settles into a chair near Elena's harp, and relaxes, hands folded on his knees, looking over at Minas and Anyanka, gathering his thoughts.

Elena strums her harp, slowly, playing a melancholy tune. Anyanka leans closer. "Well, Yuri, where will you begin looking?"

Yuri hmms. "I suspect that the answer lies beyond our borders. More than that, I don't know. Each spire is tied to one mighty tribe, and each is a tribe that is a significant part of our history. So it must be someone near enough to be significant to the Empire, but not yet in regular contact."

Yuri shakes his head. "But I think we'll have to learn more to know in which direction they may reside."

Yuri says, "And for that, we're going to Citadel."

Anyanka nods, while Minas snorts. "If the Brothers lack the knowledge, who won't? But if you're going to Citadel, I can give you a letter of introduction for the Clothmaker's Guild there. It may help."

Yuri nods. "Yes! That would be quite generous. Although..." Yuri frowns slightly, in spite of himself. "I think we're going to try and maintain a low profile. Some things trouble me about our travels to date."

Minas looks distinctly curious. "Do tell, young man. You seem hardly to be the stuff of legends ..."

Yuri sighs. "There was a group of bandits, who had taken up residence outside of Woolwich. They had robbed Jane Gerroldsdottir of a large cache of weapons, and she'd asked us to recover them. The situation became... complicated..."

The boy seems to hang on Yuri's every word. "Complicated, sir? What was it like? Did you kill the bandits?"

Yuri realizes that the boy's interest may be a dangerous thing, but he allows himself to tell more of the story than he'd intended. "Well, Silkun, we're not killers. One shouldn't kill unless there's no alternative. We gained the trust of the bandits by posing as recruits, and our healer, Starguard, prepared a draught for their dinner that put most of them to sleep."

Yuri smiles slightly. "And we bound the sleeping brigands to their beds, while we searched for their leader. Most of them were just men fallen on hard times. But their leader was truly a villain."

Silkun ohs, nodding. "You mean you beat them, and they didn't even know they were in a contest? How wonderful!" Silkun's eyes light up, and Minas smiles briefly. "Well played, Yuri. Well played."

Yuri says, "It's better that way. Even hard men, in hard times, may still learn to live good lives."

Silkun nods, sitting on his heels. "And maybe, some day, I can do what you did."

Yuri says, "But their captain... well, we turned him over to the Army. He's going to spend two years down on the Lurinese front."

Yuri looks quickly at Minas for his reaction to that. _His father may have other ideas..._

Minas's face pulls tight. "Leader, you say? Who would that be?" Anyanka pats Minas on the arm, reminding him where he is.

Yuri says, "That's not an easy thing to do, Silkun. The choice is not one to be made lightly. Don't disregard what you have in the here and now."

Silkun pouts at Yuri. "What I have now is three hours of homework, every night. And they won't let me drill with Ani until I've finished."

Yuri settles back, hoping the boy will take some time to think about it. "A man named Ferg. And anything that happens to him on the Front will be too kind. I fear I haven't seen the last of him."

Yuri says, "I sincerely hope that fate spares us having to deal with him again, but I have reason to believe he has some powerful friends that are going to cause trouble for us."

At the mention of Ferg's name, Anyanka pales, and Minas frowns fearsomely. "The bastard is still alive, then? Which brigade did he get sent to?"

Yuri says quietly, "The Fourth Penal. I see you know of whom I speak."

Minas growls. "Yes. The fourth. I see. Elena, isn't it time for you to take Silkun to bed?"

Yuri says, "Certain items in his possession lead me to believe he had a more powerful master. Vile a man as he is, I suspect that this other will also cause us a deal of trouble."

Elena looks up from her harp, and nods. Silkun is a little less pleased about retiring, but is eventually convinced, by a frown from his father, to leave the room.

Yuri waits until Silkun leaves, and waits a moment to see if Minas speaks.

Anyanka leans back, fanning herself. Minas turns to look at his wife, and then turns back. "I do not know who Ferg's backer is. But when we've found Ferg, we **will** be sure to ask him."

Yuri also leans back in his chair, and thinks a moment. "I am no great judge to dispense justice, but having had the man try to kill me himself, I sincerely hope that he gives someone an excuse to give him what he deserves."

Minas snorts. "He already has, young man. He already has. But why don't you leave that to us; you have plenty on your plate."

Yuri nods. "We do indeed. I wish I'd brought you better tidings, but I hope this information will be of some use."

"But the news **is** good, young man. In fact, it's excellent. We will have so much to do ... please, if you will excuse us? I will send the letter of introduction around in the morning." Minas smiles, tightly, and stands.

Yuri stands also, and smiles humorlessly. "Our current business should be concluded in two seasons. If it pleases you that my friends and I be of service to you at that time, I'll be sure to return."

"Then I will look forward, young man, to seeing you in the fall. Killem, our footman, will escort you back to your inn. Thank you for joining us." Anyanka has also stood up, and summoned the footman, who now appears and bows.

Yuri bows back, and says simply, "Until then. Good evening, and thank you for your hospitality."

Yuri allows himself to be led back to the inn, halfway lost in his own thoughts.

---

Yuri re-enters the inn later in the evening, and sees Stormy and Tilara performing to an enraptured audience. He slips past the crowd and makes his way to the hall with the Company's rooms.

Yuri mutters softly, "So much unsaid. So many wounds, so hard to heal. I fear that sparing him was a mistake."

Starguard waits in one of the rooms, looking out the window. He's quiet, thinking. At the steps behind, he speaks. "Hello?"

Yuri says, "It's just me, Brother. I'm back from Elena's, and the merry-making in the common room does not suit my mood."

Yuri closes the door to the small room behind him. "We should have killed him. I never thought I'd say that of any man."

Starguard says, "Ferg you mean? Well, yes... I have one more bit of evidence to damn him."

Yuri slumps, and fishes out a hip flask. "Not sure I want to hear it, but I suppose I should. I didn't even see the older sister. I don't know what it's going to take to heal her wounds."

Starguard says, "Yes, well. Stormy says that he's pretty sure that he was the bait that sprung Ferg's ambush on that girl..." He frowns, watching Yuri for his reaction.

Yuri just looks confused. "Bait? Ambush? How can Stormy be bait?"

Starguard says, "When the girl was taken by Ferg, Stormy lured her into the alley where they caught her and...raped her." Starguard's face hardens.

Yuri says, "I... see. The next thing you tell me had better be that Stormy was being threatened with death."

Starguard says, "With Ferg around? I assumed it. He feels horrible about it as it is, Yuri."

Yuri just nods, and finishes the flask.

Yuri grimaces, and tosses it against the far wall, where it bounces with a soft metallic clatter. "DAMN him."

Starguard nods as Yuri throws the flask. "Quite. I almost wish I hadn't staunched the blood flow, and let him die."

Yuri says, "Well, I stuck him with half a dozen needles that I could have sworn had contact poison all over him. Just my luck those would be his fresh spares."

Yuri says, "We might not be able to make a happy ending out of this. But I think we can make a just one. I spoke to the father of the girl he raped. I think we've made... not a friend. But a contact, anyway."

Yuri says, "He didn't say it, but I'm sure he's going to do his best to get Ferg killed. Didn't take a mind-reader to figure that out."

Starguard nods. "Have faith, Yuri. In time, what was given away returns. And with the bad blood Ferg's spread around..."

Yuri says, "I told him we'd probably be passing this way in two seasons' time. I think he'd like to talk to us then."

Yuri feels the whiskey taking hold, loosening his tongue slightly. "Ferg's just the part where it's personal. Ferg was working for someone, and they're not going to like us much."

Yuri says, "The Abbot knew what the real price was. We don't have the choice to just fade into the background now. If we deal with Ferg, we'll have to deal with Ferg's master. You know the kind of people we are. I can tell that we won't leave the job half-done."

Yuri says, "I suspect in six months, ol' Minas will contract us to do some harm to Ferg. And if ye all will agree, I intend to let Stormy be the edge of the knife."

Starguard winces. "Yuri...I can't approve of that. He's a good lad who's done some terrible things. By killing Ferg, no matter how evil he is, we become more like him."

Yuri slumps. "Then what should we do for the girl? I didn't get to meet her, but I can't imagine that anything she's thinking right now is bright and sunny."

Starguard sighs. "I don't want to be a part of any more killing, Yuri. I'm a healer. I left the war to get away from the killings. Maybe even Ferg could be turned."

Yuri says, "Well, we've got six months to think about it. Maybe he'll meet with an unfortunate accident."

Starguard says, "Perhaps there's some good left for him to do, Yuri, even by accident. Enough of this though. We need to start thinking of which route we'll take to Citadel."

---

After a pleasant soak in the bath house, Ash heads into town, with Andreth in tow. Yuri will be interrogating the high mucky mucks, and Tilara will be entertaining the crowds, so that really leaves them to ask around the guards. Ash leads Andreth to the inn he vaguely remembers, where unemployed guards hang out and wait to be hired. This early in the evening, the room is near empty, although there's plenty wafting smoke in the low ceilinged common room.

Ash is explaining along the way. ".... See, most of these guys think they're pretty tough, right? Wrong. One guy I knew had practiced swinging his sword in one particular pattern for about half a year when he was growing up. He signs onto the caravan, shows 'em this fancy move, they assume he's the Sword Saint and hire him on directly."

Andreth gives a soft chuckle. "And how long did _he_ last?"

Ash gives a casual shrug. "Longer than most. He'd take up defendin' the boss's jewels, 'cos he'd overheard where they were kept. Didn't do anything but stand behind the curtain with his sword pointed out. Killed one guy that way. Ran right onto the sword-point. Boss thought he knew his priorities - he did, but he wanted to steal 'em - and promoted him to gang boss. Just goes to show that larceny pays."

A single man looks up, as the pair enter the common room. The man is sitting in the corner, wearing a hooded cloak, with a club lying on the table in front of him.

Andreth glances around the room, noticing the hooded man in the corner, but gives no sign. He doesn't know this town, and he's more than happy to let Ash do the talking.

Ash enters, looking about for any familiar faces and ordering a drink for himself. "Well well well," he smiles. "Friendly crowd."

Ash looks around and sees an empty bar. His sarcastic note goes unappreciated by any and all.

Eventually the barmaid saunters by, hand on hip. "What'll it be, gents. And why don't ay sit down?"

Ash jerks a thumb in Andreth's direction. "He's drinkin. I'm buyin. Ale, or whatever you've got for five silver pieces."

Andreth gives the barmaid a silent, but definitely affirmative, nod.

The barmaid nods. "For five silver? Th'owner just got 'is first shipment of fresh Midwinter Mops." She tilts her head. "Might be a bit strong, though."

Ash grins widely. "Sounds fine. But let's start slow, hmm?"

She grins. "Sure. Only a idit starts fast." She steps behind the bar, and digs out a small glass. After a cursory wipe. she fills it from a small keg and puts it down in front of Andreth. "That'll be your silvers."

Andreth takes his seat in front of the little glass, glancing up at Ash.

Ash lays down five of the shiny coins. "Hey friend," he calls to the man with the club. "You drinkin' too?"

The man looks up, his face still hidden in shadow. His right hand grips the club more tightly. "I'm drinkin', aye. Who'se askin'?"

The barmaid hastily picks up the coins. "If you need anythin' mor, jest holler."

Ash looks around as though expecting to see somebody else. "That'd be me," he replies with a faint smile. "Ash of Lainsborough, just in town."

"Aye, well, ya could buy me a drink and join me. The ale's thinner'n water today ..." the man suggests.

Ash nods and moves to take a seat. "C'mon, Andreth. Barmaid!" he calls more loudly. "You'll be able to find us in the press of the crowd if we move, right?"

The maid grins, hand back on hip. "A sexy young thang like you, you'd stand out in any crowd. As would yer friend; he looks like he's spit on Ungfallen's face."

Ash coughs a little, but says nothing.

Andreth picks up his glass, looking a little uncomfortable at the last remark, but manages a grin in the barmaid's direction, before he follows Ash to the corner.

The man leans back, hiding in the shadows. "So, yer new in town? And hunti' work?"

Ash says, "Well.... not really. We uh... we have an assignment."

Ash glances at Andreth, then looks back with a careful smile.

The man grunts, shifting his club a little. "So ye've got a job, and yer just here for the fun of it? Hell; nobody 'cept the bosses likes this bar, and they likes it cuz the guards is broke by the time they leaves ..."

Ash laughs, loving the feel of familiarity. "Well.... we're headed to Citadel," he explains. "I'm lookin for any caravaners who've come that way. Wanted to hear about good rest stops on the road, places to avoid, trouble they've run into, that sorta thing. Wanted to catch up with my mates, if any familiar mug showed itself."

"Well, yeh missed the last caravan from Citadel. They oughter be past the fete in Woolwich by now. But I've bin ta Citadel meself. Damn sewer pit." Waving his refilled mug, he expostulates. "Every month a new celebration. The kid burped. The kid spit. The kid said Mama. And every one of the princes in attendance, hoping the kid kicks it. Damn sewer pit. Wouldn't treat me own brats like that."

Ash chuckles softly. "We're told," he remarks, nodding towards Andreth inclusively, "about a new spire what sprang up. You there for that?"

The man spits on the floor. "Ah heard the tales. All silly nonsense; anyone knows the spires is fake."

Andreth hmms. "Lotta people takin' 'em seriously."

The man snorts derisively. "Lotta people wanna shine the prince's boots too. And clean the shit off. Aint no job for a real job. Idiots; they oughter be mannin' the borders, not pissin' in the wind."

Ash hmms. "Very interesting...." Then he glances down at the club. "Hard to peace-bond a hunk of wood, I guess."

"Peace bond an innocent peace of wood like this? Dinnae be silly. After all, 'snot as though **I** would start a fight ... So why're ya huntin' the spires? There's better bounty be found cross the land."

Ash grins widely. "You could say we dedicated his life to it," he answers, gesturing sidelong at Andreth.

The man leans forward, grabbing Andreth's chin and turning it side to side. "Ya coulda dedicated a prettier life ta it."

Andreth leans away from the man, his eyes glinting a little. "There's more to me 'n just a pretty face. And I'm a lucky man to have friends who know it."

Ash laughs softly. "Pretty faces or clever brains are no substitute for stout hearts. Caravaning taught me that. And he's got guts to spare."

The man leans forward, and Andreth can see the faint stirrings of interest in the man's black eyes. "Aye, so ya say. Ya must have pretty friends indeed. But yer nae here for work, and yer nae here for the likker. And there won't be much of a crowd tanight; caravan master got news he was to hire a large contingent of guards."

Ash perks up at that. "Go on," he murmurs. "Where?"

The man shrugs. "Where what?"

Ash says, ".. Where's the caravan bound for? Which route?"

"Caravan's bound past Woolwich, ta Changer's Bane. Which is a silly name for a fortress; commandant got a bee up his butt. I dinnae ken the guards will stay with the caravan, mind. Be silly to. And yer a little late ta enlist."

Ash nods slowly. "Well.... I like to know. Never hurts to keep track of the business, right?"

In one long gulp, the man finishes his ale. "Well, master weren't sayin'. I'm holdin' out for a better job."

Ash laughs. "For a moment, I thought you were 'recruiting'," he comments, pointing down at the club. "I guess that only works at sea."

"Recruitin'? Me? Nah; do Ah look like a pantywaist tubthumper? Me an' the sea is like ... like our prince and the Lurinese muckety-muck. Brothers 'n mortal enemies." Offended, the man looks at his empty mug.

Ash says, "No offense intended. But I've seen similar methods attempted on the road. Anyway, I'm curious - why do people think the spires are fake? Or why you do anyway."

The man stares at Ash. "Yer a silly bugger, if yeh b'lieve in that kind of magic. After all, who would care bout the Stormwinds; 's not as if the spires tell us how we can kill 'em all. And the third spire, that supposedly tells bout the underworld. Ye all know that's just myths ..."

Andreth bursts out laughing.

Ash chuckles softly. "We're big believers in myths. Magic, strange things happening, people rising from the dead again. Anyway, if the spires treat somethin factual - the Stormwinds - just as honestly as they treat somethin that might sound strange, who's to say what's myth?"

"Well, does it matter? Princes may care, but it willnae affect my job. I just wait fer the Lady ta show up, and keep mah nose clean." Turning to the bar, the man hollers out. "Ale! More ale! The lads hae promised ta buy me drinks!"

Ash nods along. "Still hurt to keep up, right? Myth might suddenly turn into reality. Then what?"

The barmaid wanders by, pitcher in hand. "Yer broke, y'awld sod. Put the money on the table first." The man growls, and points at Ash. "He's the nabob."

Ash gives thumbs-up. "I'm buyin, to a point."

The maid pours out more ale. "That'll be six coppers. He's drinking the middlin' ale."

Ash says, "Tell us anything else you can about Citadel? Neither of us have ever been there, to my knowledge anyway."

The man nods. "Well, ye ken, Citadel's a hobnobby place. When the old man kicks off, finally, word has it Citadel will be kep' neutral. None of the princes has claimed it yet, but all of them want it. 'Cept Aiscalion, a' course. He'll just hide, up there, behind his cliff, and let the princes take the hindmost. Still, there's scabby places fer ye and me ta hide."

Ash says, "Who would you say is the most well-informed in Citadel? That's not attached to the court. Some knowledgeable party or guild or sage or whatnot, say... that we might approach?"

The man leans forward. "I heard tell the lady likes ta talk to muffins like you. She's ... fond of slummin'. But if yer huntin' fer better jobs 'n guardin', ye could try old Mumbleguts. Lives in the slums, and sells knowledge for pennies. Wisdom's more 'spensive, a course."

Ash nods slowly. "Right..." He frowns a bit. "Know anyone else in town who might have just come from Citadel? Maybe a fired guard from them that went on?"

The door into the common room opens, and a few men stumble inside, carrying a wounded companion. Dropping him on a bench, with his head on the table, the leader shouts for mulled wine. Hot mulled wine. And lots of it.

The man in the corner moves his club off the table, holdin' it at his side, as he watches warily.

Ash glances sidelong at the newcomers as well, but says nothing.

The barmaid looks over, sighs, and heads to the kitchen. There's a loud snorted "Louts!" coming from over thattaway. The man leans even further into the shadows, and sighs. "I think, lads, that ye'll have ta stick with old Mumbleguts. Hire an urchin ta find him, and he'll not steer your wrong. Just make sure yer hearin's in prime condition."

Ash gives a quick, curt nod and rises to slowly approach the newcomer party. "What happened?" he asks, directly.

Andreth stands and bows slightly to the hooded man, then takes up station by Ash's side.

The leader looks over. "The idjit tried ta unpeace bond his sword. I tole him; ya get insulted, ya wipe the snots nose with yer fist. And if he draws steel, ya let it go. But no, **this** idjit had ta go after 'is sword. And the snot let 'im. And then the guards showed up, a course." The maid returns with mulled wine, which is carefully fed to the battered, bruised, and generally worn man.

Ash nods. "A shame, really. S'why some of us learn not to fight unless we have to. S'why other of us learn to fight without steel."

The man nods. "Yer friend looks right handy with his fists. But ware the guards; they're feelin' cranky tonight."

Ash holds up his hands in a peaceful gesture. "Nothing against the guards, not from me. You got anything against guards, Andreth?"

Andreth shakes his head. "Course not. They got a job ta do, same as anyone else. 'n if people're goin round tryin' to unwrap their swords, make their job harder, well, I'd be pretty cranky meself."

Ash says, "What happened to the other guy?"

The man nods. "Th'other guy? He jest watched the guards administer their beatin', and then left, prancin' away on his shiny little boots. We'll grab him tamorrer."

Ash doesn't look like he likes the sound of that. "You boys from around here?"

The man shakes his head. "Wouldnae be a peace bond if we were. But our merchant stopped off here, and let us go. And din't tell us, the sod, till the master had filled his slots."

Ash nods slowly. "Out to Woolwich, right? That's dirty business. Never had that done to me - left before I could get kicked off the train, myself."

The man nods again. "Aye; we were on the Citadel ta Fortress run. And it'll be a while fore we can catch a caravan back."

Ash glances backwards at the man with the club, then grins broadly. "We're headed that way ourselves, though not as part of a caravan. What's news on the road?" Lucky day, indeed!

The man sits down. "Road's pretty clear. The campsites is all set up, and we did a fair amount of firewood choppin', so supplies is good. If'n ya stays on the road ye canna miss it, and it should be a straight pull through. Mind ye keep the fires high though; wolves is fierce this year."

Andreth winces. "Ya don't say."

"Aye; Ah do say. Killt two, ourselves. Big suckers. And one looked odd."

Ash laughs suddenly. "funny thing. We'red headed to Citadel because of wolves, in a roundabout way. I'm Ash, by the way, my companion is Andreth. We're figuring on hitting the road sooner than later, but paying our way there's half the fun. When do you expect the next caravan out?"

The man grins. "I'm Harry. And Dickon's the beat up one. The other's Perf and Jermiah. And we're waiting on the next caravan too. But it'll likely be a while yet; they only run every coupla weeks, and like ah said the last one jest left. Haven't heard bout small caravans; everyone's bunchin' up."

Andreth interjects. "One of them wolves looked odd, you say? How d'you mean?"

Jermiah speaks up. "His snout wuz all wrong; and his paws looked like hands, see. 'Cept of course they weren't. But the digits were longer'n they should been. We skinned 'im, and put 'is 'ead on a stake, and th'caravan master has it still. Seems ta have calmed the wolves down some."

Ash makes a fist. "I knew something was wrong with that.." he mutters.

Andreth murmurs quietly, "Calmed 'em down for the caravan, but I bet it made 'em all the fiercer after. No wonder..."

Jermiah shrugs. "Mighta. But they took down four of ours; I think the exchange was fair enough." He turns back to Dickon, who is beginning to look more or less conscious again, and appears to give him a quick medical exam, before clapping him on the shoulder. "Naught broke, Dickon. Yer a lucky man."

Ash thinks quickly. "Tell you what - if we're still in town and you get an ear of a caravan or other work leaving, you let us know, and keep us up on whatever else you find interesting. In return... I know a priest who might patch your friend up right quick."

Ash widely grins. "One small favor for another."

Dickon looks up, and Harry nods. "Right enough. Where'll we send the information, and where's yer friend?"

Ash mentions his residence, then adds "Either of us can go track the good ol' boy down," once again gesturing in Andreth's direction.

Harry nods. "Well, why don't you and I go find the good friar, while Dickon rests a wee?"

Andreth nods to Ash. "Right," he says, departing the tavern to head back for our lodgings to fetch Starguard.

Ash points Harry after the departing young man, and settles in for a quick spell of mop and nursemaiding.

Enroute to the Swan's Neck, Harry is stopped twice by guards, and cautioned on not carrying his weapon. Finally, he sighs in frustration. "Let's make a stop by my room; I want to drop this off. They're still gunning for us." After that Harry easily leads Andreth to the Swan's Neck Inn. "Yer stayin' in a nice place, friend.

Brother Starguard is easily found, and easily convinced to come give the Dickon a helping hand. When the three men return, the cloaked and hooded man has slipped out, and Jermiah is explaining that nobody knows who the man was. He traveled with the caravan sometimes, but always with a lady. Brother Starguard takes one look at Dickon, and shakes his head. "Mostly bruises, lad. And a cracked rib. I can help those."

After Dickon's rib has been fixed, Brother Starguard returns to the inn, worried as he is about Stormy. Ash and Andreth are invited to stay the night, and swap tales ...

Ash will do so, gladly, regaling those interested with his days as a bravo.
