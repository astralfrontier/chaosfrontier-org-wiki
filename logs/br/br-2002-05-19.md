Game Log: Chapter 23 - Potholes


-----------------------------------

The caravan has left Red River Town, the five carts slowly heading towards Citadel. The first town they'll encounter will be Glencorgan, only three days out. And after that Perfirin, where they'll turn towards Citadel. With luck the road will improve as they get closer. Certainly the campsites will.

Tormel, his chest of books carefully stowed on the White Company's cart, has engaged Stormy to walk with him. He's carefully pointing out plants in the verge, and listing their abilities. Stormy, eyes wide open, is soaking in every comment, completely ignoring Tilara who is sitting on the cart.

Starguard follows along at the back of the row, enjoying being back on the road in a near-military formation. He talks with Andreth quietly, keeping his eyes out for wolves, or ambitious bandits.

The weather is pleasant today; a light dusting of clouds to break up Brother Sun's glare. The birds are singing, the horses' hooves are clopping, the four merchants are lazily watching the road, and one of them has broken into song. And he's not half bad. The occasional traveler is usually quick to step off the verge, so that the caravan can pass easily.

Tilara smiles indulgently at the boy and the scholar, happy to see the boy learning, and just as pleased that he's not fixated on her at the moment. _After all, I want to be his teacher, not his lover..._ Mirra, perched on her shoulder, purrs with amusement.

Late afternoon, Harry leads the way to a campsite, large enough to hold the entire caravan thrice over. "As you can see, Andreth, the campsites haven't moved."

_The campsite includes a large pile of firewood with a small cashbox beside it, and a small well with attached bucket. The main field, a grassy swain, looks reasonably clean, although there are shadows left from previous campers. There are also several firepits, and a sign pointing to latrines deeper in the wood._

Tilara pulls her cart into the campsite and reins in. "Didn't think they would, after all. So far, so good."

Ash is busy making a thorough sweep of the campground. He doesn't seem at all relaxed or ready to turn in early; but he doesn't seem unhappy, either. He's back on the job, and the tense thrill of knowing somebody's life is in your hands has been with him all day.

Yuri takes about an hour as camp is made, to speak briefly with everyone in the caravan.

Starguard quickly goes to unpacking for the meal, enlisting whoever's handy to help with the fire. The clatter of pots and the unraveling of fabric erupts as camp begins to be made, the horses unhitched.

Ash comes back into camp after a good long sweep, maybe an hour's worth of time while the horses first started being tended. "Got a rabbit," he remarks laconically, hefting the prize. "Plenty more."

Yuri says, "See any signs of wolves?"

Tormel curls up in the cart, after watching others unhitch the horse, his head now firmly buried in his journal. Harry saunters up to look over his shoulder, and Tormel sniffs. "Class was this morning, sirrah. Every morning; four hours." he buries his head back in his notes. Somewhat confused, Harry turns away, and looks to Yuri and Ash. "How do we stand guard, sirs?"

Ash nopes. "Spent lots of time lookin," he says to Yuri. "Birds and rabbits, is all." The latter is addressed to Tormel as well with a slow grin. "Let's hope it stays clear."

Tormel sniffs again, at Ash's comment, but doesn't look up. His pencil is flying across the page.

Yuri looks blank for a moment, then turns to Ash. "How about four shifts of two each?"

Starguard grins. "Ah. A bit of a jackpot, tonight then. Rabbit stew sound good to anyone?" He chuckles, relieving Ash of the rabbit. "Andreth, Stormy, could you set the horses in that longish patch of grass there?"

Ash shrugs. "S'fine. The more the better, obviously. Let me know when you want me standing, boss." No longer a member of a company, he's back in the professional mindset.

Stormy nods, and with Andreth's help the horse is quickly hobbled. Looking at the merchants, and then at each other, they quickly move to help the young men too. After all, each merchant is dealing with three horses, and is somewhat outnumbered.

Yuri gives a guard assignment to Harry. "Four shifts. You and me, then Perf and Tilara, then Jermiah and Ash, and then Starguard and Dickon. Andreth's still weak from his injuries, so he gets to sleep."

Harry nods. "We should walk the perimeter now, then. Get everyone familiar with the layout before it gets dark."

Yuri nods, and walks it with Harry, asking a few questions here and there about him and his fellows.

Starguard says, "Hey, Tormel, is it? You want to help but the tarp up? We promised you room and board, but you still have to help make your bed like everyone else."

The campsite, about twenty yards off the road, is bordered on two sides by forest, while the other sides stand open to the countryside. Along one side of the path to the campsite runs a ditch, overgrown with weeds. The latrines, located in the woods, consist of two one-hole setups. Evidence and experience suggests that they are moved every year or so.

Tormel looks up irritated, before Starguard's comments register. Sniffing most audibly, he puts the journal back inside his vest, and slowly ambles over. "If I must ... if I must. We're not sleeping under the cart?"

Tilara says, "You can if you want. Might be a bit damp if it rains, though."

Starguard says, "I'd rather see everyone together, with the wolves and all." He holds back a few pieces of the rabbit, toasting them over the fire as Mirra nuzzles against his arm. "Paitence, Mirra. It's better cooked."

One of the merchants ambles over. "Will you cook for everyone, Brother? We can contribute a little to the pot, in that case."

Starguard says, "Be glad to, my son. It's easier to cook for many, in a way."

Starguard chops up what vegetables they have, adding water until the stew begins to simmer nicely, Mirra getting her dinner first, a piece of rabbit.

As the supper cooks, Masci takes a moment to introduce himself and his compatriots. Masci, a softspoken young man, well and warmly dressed, smiles at Starguard. "We appreciate this chance, sirrah. Master Pjurin himself promised me a share of a profits, as did the other masters. Gerard, here, he carries the liqueurs for Master Wilkin. And Engeram is most cautious with Master Potter's porcelain. Most fearful of breakage he is." Engeram, looking sheepish, nods, affirming that the porcelain has been carefully packed although a chase could do great harm. "And lastly we have Ymbert, the fragrant emissary of Master Stronginthenose." Everyone chuckles, with the exception of Ymbert, who looks pained. But Ymbert really does smell a tad fragrant. Mostly ... hollyhock.

The young men seem to have two qualities in common; they are all well-spoken, and they are all cheerful. Apparently they've been given the chance to prove themselves in the big markets.

The guards are a little more quiet. Harry, the obvious leader, has taken the other three on a quick perimeter tour before supper is served, pointing out the latrines, the ditch, and the trees. During supper, Dickon takes a moment to thank the good Brother, again, for his healing help, while Perf and Jermiah stay quiet. And after supper the three younger guards see to their weapons and turn in to sleep, while Harry sits with Yuri.

Tilara returns from her own walk of the perimeter just before the stew is ready, settling in to eat with the others. "And our job is to keep things safe. Shouldn't be that bad."

Starguard smiles, nodding. "Glad to have you aboard, men. Hopefully this will be a quiet trip. If you need anything, let us know, or if you have anything to offer us. How are you four with weapons, by the way, in case of trouble?"

Dickon grins. "I'm the hothead. That's how my ribs get cracked so often. M'brother Harry, aye, he's our leader, and a fine man with his broadsword. Perf and Jermiah prefer staff and bow. But we're nae bad. Nae bad 'tall."

Starguard chuckles. "How are they feeling? You look good enough, but any lasting pain? Other than hunger, of course. It's been a long day."

Tilara grins. "That's not pain. That's anticipation."

Dickon shakes his head. "Right as spring rain, Brother. My ribs are strong enou, they always heal fast. But that stew smells fair good. I"ve a bowl ready, and spoon, too."

Starguard grins, smelling. "Darn, I've over-spiced it again. It always take a few times to get the proportions right for a big group. Still..." His ladle comes up, examining the meat, then clangs the side of the pot a few times. "Stew's on!"

Ash digs in willingly, still quiet, but with an almost gleeful look on his face.

Who knew guards could be so hungry? Or merchanters, for that matter. But tonight the pot will be emptied.

Tilara chuckles at Starguard. "Even your bad days are better than most cooks, Starguard. Don't put yourself down."

Stormy nods, right behind Tilara, as he wolfs down his second bowl. "Yeah." Even Tormel seems grudgingly impressed.

Starguard grins. "Thanks, Til." He digs into his own portion, chatting, checking everyone out.

Ash doesn't say much, but he seems content enough.

Yuri quietly eats, listening to everyone else's chatter more than he volunteers his own.

That night passes quietly. The four young guards work diligently, walking the perimeter at irregular intervals. When the sun rises, the caravan slowly comes back to life, woken by the smell of Brother Starguard's cooking. After a quick yet tasty breakfast, the caravan is on the road again. That evening they find a similar campsite, and Harry mentions that at this tempo the caravan will reach Glencorgan by noon, the following day.

Yuri spends mornings with Tormel, learning about the basics of reading and writing some unusual documents.

As Starguard cooks the following night, and Tormel reads, Starguard suddenly remembers something. "Hey, Tormel...would you know anything about making healing draughts? I know they exist, and it's something I've been meaning to try to learn. It'd be a good way to help people.

Tormel looks up, distracted, and grunts a "Yes." at Starguard.

Starguard blinks. "You do? Mind folding that into your teaching? Or perhaps lending me a book? I've done healing for a while, so I shouldn't require much teaching."

Tormel shakes his head at Starguard. "No books. This is basic knowledge. But I can teach on the morrow; Firestorm has some practicing to do."

Starguard nods, and returns to making a meal.

Tilara nods. "I'd like to hear anything you know about the Pillars, if you could."

Tormel chuckles. "I'm sure you would, missy. I'm sure you would. Now, let me see ... would you like possible origins, likelihoods, or myths?"

Tilara grins. "Let's start with possible origins, I think. There's supposed to be a fourth just growing now."

Tormel sighs. "No rest for the learned, is there? Well, fine. There are ... ", he pauses to flip quickly through his notebook. "Ah, yes. There are several possible origins. One myth ascribes them to the gods, as a way of keeping score. A second myth suggests that there are multiple spires, and that these are the only ones we know about. And then there's the notation about the labyrinth, but that one is the most farfetched of all. Hmmmmph."

Tilara says, "Labyrinth? I don't think I've ever heard about that one. What's the story?"

"The labyrinth? A child's fable. Next you'll be asking me about the Watcher and the Listener. But, ah, here it is. Yes. Legend has it that Jurdah, Child of the Gods, made history in a long labyrinth, where the walls of the passage traced stories. Where stories met, so would passages. Quite incredible, really, once the population began to expand."

Yuri says, "A labyrinth of stories? That sounds interesting."

Tilara nods. "But how do the Spires come into it?"

Yuri says, "Or at least, how were they discovered? They may have been there a long time."

Tormel snorts, once. "Sure. Interesting. Unbelievable, implausible, and probably impossible, but it keeps the children quiet, knowing that their actions can make the warren more confusing. Feh. As for the spires; well, who knows? Perhaps they provide a map?"

Tormel turns to Yuri, now. "How where whom discovered?"

Yuri says, "The spires. It all sounds rather odd, that one day, there should be a spire where there wasn't."

Yuri says, "So I've been wondering, how the spires were found. Surely they didn't just appear overnight like that."

A simple shrug. "The spires have always been there. No-one living remembers a day when they were not. The old lords wrote about them, the old mages used them to anchor their scryings, the peasants merely prayed at their bases." Tormel pages through his notebook, slowly. "But more than that ... I don't know." He looks pained.

Tilara nods. "They've always been there. Which makes the idea of a _new_ one all the more intriguing."

Yuri says, "Yes... if the new one has always been there, it must have been somewhere that nobody went, or at least, not very often."

Ash says, "I was under the impression they were close together.."

Starguard says, "I wonder if it could be a fake, a plot by someone in the capitol?"

Tormel sighs. "It ... has grown up in the shadows. It was thought to be a pebble, apparently. There are several letters noting attempts to remove the pebble, unsuccessfully. It has now grown."

Starguard says, "Not a fake then."

Tilara hmmms. "That sounds... ominous, somehow. I hope it's not a portent."

Starguard says, "Or at least, unlikely to be one."

"What's wrong with portents?" Tormel yells, "They're kinder to us poor useless peasants than direct commands. A little distance from the Gods is a kindness. See where their god got the abominable Stormwinds!"

Stormy looks up, disturbed by the yelling.

Yuri thinks, _Wow. That got him riled up._

Starguard blinks, looking at Tormel, disturbed. "Do you have a - problem - with the Gods?"

Tilara blinks. "I didn't mean it that way. Just that a portent of shadows seemed a bit... unpleasant."

Tormel visibly gets his emotions back under control, before spitting on the ground. "They gave birth to us, and then they abandoned us. When they don't meddle, that is. Meddling brats; if a lord acted as they have, he'd be dead, assassinated by his own people. But gods ... gods we venerate, we worship, we adore. Faugh. What kind of learned man loves the gods?"

Ash says, "One who's grateful to be alive."

Starguard frowns, his eyes developing a steely glint. "The Gods can be kind to those who show them proper respect. I've healed many since the stars called me."

Yuri sits quietly, listening to this.

Tilara nods. "There are things we don't understand about the Gods. Are they meddling? Or are they protecting us against _other_ meddlers? Or is it more complicated even than that?"

Yuri says, "I think that to believe that there are Gods, is easy. But to believe _in_ the Gods... is a personal choice."

A very visible shrug from Tormel. "Gods don't give life; they give pain, and suffering. They gave us the Stormwinds, didn't they? And the Emperor, requiescat pace, and his seven feud loving sons."

"But I digress; you did not request discussion of the merits of gods." Tormel sits down, closing his journal and putting it away. "You asked about the spires."

Ash spits. "A friend of mine is alive today because of the Gods. I'm waiting for the pain and suffering part, I've had enough of that from my fellow man. Never been smote down by a deity, though." He falls silent.

Yuri says, "It's uncharacteristic of you to share your opinion for free, Tormel."

Tilara chuckles. "One hardly needs to have to _believe_ in the Emperor and his children. They're rather incontrovertible facts."

Starguard says, "Without challenges, how are we to grow stronger? And besides which, the Gods want different things, creating conflict between them."

Tormel chuckles, bitterly. "That's not an opinion people will pay for, Yuri. It's decried to easily as heresy, by those such as the good Brother here, and young Andreth, who have gained from their contacts with the deities and their fractious offspring."

Starguard says, "I take it you've lost in your contacts, then?"

Yuri waggles his hand at Tilara. "Are they? Perhaps to some, but they're very distant from us, like the clouds in the sky. Sometimes they drop rain and sometimes they drop hail. And sometimes they aren't there at all, nor are we there to them. We've chosen to make ourselves known in those spheres. That's a very dangerous thing to do, then."

Yuri says, "To me, Tormel, it's an issue of choice. Perhaps we should get moving. It seems that the focus needed to study is absent today."

Tormel turns to Starguard. "Once, I taught the sons of princes. Now I teach the sons of ... " He turns to look at Stormy. "Sons of unknown provenance," he murmurs.

Tilara says, "And does that make him less worthy? Or a less talented student?"

"It makes him no less than what he is. It makes me ... less than I was." Tormel shrugs, and looks to the fire. "How comes the stew, Brother? I grow passing hungry."

Starguard says, "I helped keep thousands of men alive on the Lurinese front. Now a mere handful. I don't feel any less worthy. Ah! Right! Important things." He clangs a pot, and begins doling out the meat and bread that are on the menu for the night,

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "With all the animals and thugs out there trying to kill us, who'd think we'd get so fractious over _religion_?"

Tilara gives Yuri a grin and a shrug. "It's good for an argument, at least. It's not like they _tell_ us much."

Tormel eats listlessly, keeping to himself. Young Masci, in contrast, tries to lighten spirits by telling tales of the hills.

Yuri takes a walk around the perimeter of the camp, to clear his head, and check for signs of intrusion.

Tilara notes a movement in the roadside ditch about halfway through her watch, while her partner is off to the latrine. _Mirra... do you see that?_ She arms her crossbow.

Mirra stalks closer in the weeds. _Ugh. Stink! Rotting leather._ She backtracks, moving closer to Tilara.

Tilara frowns at her familiar's reaction. "All right. Stand up, whatever you are." She aims the bow to the point where she saw the movement. _Mirra... anything else around?_

Four humanoid shapes rise from the weeds, long sticks held overhead.

In almost complete harmony, three of the shapes fling their sticks at Tilara. Or rather, their javelins, as Tilara discovered when one of the javelins catches her in the upper thigh, creating a long, nasty scratch.

Tilara yells, "Perf! Get your butt back here, we've got company! Mirra, wake everyone -- #@$&\*!!" Her warning trails off into a screech as she's hit.

Tilara fires at the last figure, hoping to catch it before it can throw, but misses badly. "Perf, where are you?!" She collapses with the javelin from the last creature sticking from her chest.

Perf comes running, his hose half tied, bow in hand, when he sees the shapes advancing on the horses. Growling, he looses an arrow at the closest one.

Starguard comes up groggily. "Tilara? Are you... @$\*! Up! Up! Tilara's down!" He scrambles for weapons, and Tilara's side.

Ash has finished waking, grabbed his blade without thought, and is already charging out to defend the all-important horses after appraising the threat. He'll take a mighty swing at the closest of the creatures with his imposing greatsword.

Ash misses, but returns the favor by narrowly avoiding injury himself.

Stormy storms to his feet, running to Tilara. Kneeling at her side, he looks at the javelin and screams for Starguard, while keeping both eyes on the attackers.

Yuri staggers awake when he hears Tilara, shriek, and spends several seconds in stunned silence staring at her still form. He lets out a bellow, takes up his rapier, and charges the nearest dark figure. "_Bas**taaards!!**_"

Tilara stirs as Starguard calls on his Gods to heal her. "Ouch. What'd I miss?"

Ash spits a curse and takes a swing, once again targeting the nearest creature without a moment's hesitation.

Ash misses once again, and is missed once again. Karma stays balanced.

Tilara is still swearing under her breath as she gets up and moves closer to the creatures. _If I do this right, the flames will stop just shy of Ash..._ She halts, and speaks the guttural syllables that focus her control of the fire, which lashes out at the closest creatures.

Stormy follows right behind Tilara, his hands mirroring hers. As she finishes chanting, he takes up the chant. Fire shoots from his fingers, and, too late, he notices how far ahead of him she is. He screams.

Mirra squawls as she sees the boy aiming the spell behind her mistress, and Tilara dives as he launches the flame.

Stormy's flames catch Tilara, and she looks a little warmer than she used to, even though she manages to duck under most of the backlash. The creature, on the other hand, collapses, screaming.

Tilara yells, "Stormy! Watch what you're doing!"

Starguard, noticing that Tilara seems alright, and concentrates, calling for the stars. They seem to reply, something shining near Ash as the bass voice chants, calling forth power...

Yuri turns, still seething over Tilara's injury, and tries to run one of the shapes menacing Ash through, from behind.

Between the double-barbecuing and trading blows with Ash, the creatures are too occupied to notice Yuri coming from behind. In a fit of pique he rams his rapier through the torso of the nearest one in a solid and lethal strike, at the same time as Perf strikes it with an arrow.

Ash growls, once again renewing his attack with a furious volley of swings.

After the last attacker sees his comrade collapse around him, even disregarding Ash's missed blows, he panics. The attacker takes to his heels.

Yuri runs after the last one. "Stop, you, if you want to live!"

Tilara follows Yuri as backup, just in case he needs help. "Come back here, you!"

Stormy trails after Tilara, his hands kept guiltily behind his back.

Yuri catches the bandit by the arm, and tries to drag him down, but the bandit is stubborn and tries to break free. "Tilara! Glue ball us!"

Starguard finishes his chanting, the stars solidifying...into a badger, almost black, with glittering spots like stars on his pelt. "Help pin him," orders Starguard, and goes to see about the bandits.

The badger, eyes glittering, races after Yuri, tangling the creature's feet as he claws and bites.

Tilara gets out the tanglefoot bag as the badger rushes past. "I.. what was that?" She watches the badger attack the figure, and holds the bag ready. "Give it up, you."

Starguard looks to the dead bandit, and shakes his head. No help there. He turns to the nearest one he can help.

Tilara frowns as the bandit continues to try to get away. _Hate to waste this on the likes of him..._ She moves up, trying to subdue the fellow, so he can be questioned.

Yuri tries to grab the bandit again and misses. "Don't you know when you're beat? Give it up if you want to live!"

Starguard, having faith that the situation is well in hand, goes around to the bandits, binding their wounds so that they don't bleed to death where they fell.

The bandit dances on one foot, trying to take swipes at the badger with his axe. "Ad 'm cer , 'ch bastard! Ad 'm cer!"

"'ch yn llofruddio bastard! 'ch 'n fudr foch! 'ch malingering chorgi!" The bandit tries to disengage, and run away again, pushing past Tilara in his bid for an escape.

Yuri reaches out with his blackjack for one last strike at the retreating bandit. He lands a solid blow on it (his?) back. "Well, same to you, mac."

The bandit crumples in a heap.

The badger gives a little move that looks like a salute, and vanishes in a swirl of stars.

Yuri says, "Let's drag him back to camp."

Tilara says, "That was ..." She blinks as the badger vanishes. "Ah, that's what that was all about. That was not any language I recognize."

The creature is heavier than it looks, weighed down by the scale mail it's wearing.

Yuri looks Tilara over. "I saw you on the ground, and all I could think of, was Andreth, all over again. And we couldn't afford to do anything about it this time. I think I got a little carried away."

Tilara says, "I was hurt, but apparently not that badly. It's nice to have Starguard around."

She turns to Stormy. "However, someone needs to be more careful about his area of affect."

Starguard is doing his job back at the camp. Two of the bandits are trussed when you get back, the third being moved off to not draw attention from animals.

Perf steps out from the trees, looking sheepish, with his bow still held at the ready. Harry is kept busy, calming the horses, with the aid of Dickon and Jermiah, while the merchants are clumped together in the center of their carts.

Yuri looks at the dead bandit, his mouth hardening into a thin line. "Perf, Ash, if you would be so kind, please have a look around the perimeter and make sure we don't have any more guests."

Starguard calls out. "Are we all clear?"

Ash wanders the perimeter.

Perf nods, and follows Ash around the perimeter, paying particular attention to the wooded area.

Yuri takes a close look at the face of the bandit they've dragged back. "I think so. But I'm still not sure _what_ we're clear of."

Stormy, watching Mirra, nods. Mirra, after all, is now sitting on the ground, washing her paw.

Eyes closed, the bandit looks wild. Very wild. Almost, but not quite, inhuman. His cheeks have been scarified, great whorls reaching out to his temples, where matted, greasy hair is divided into strands.

Tilara limps back to camp with the others. "Did you have any healing magic left, Starguard? I'm feeling a little battered yet."

Starguard says, "Come over here, Tilara. Have you ever seen anyone like this?"

Yuri says, "Human, of course. But not of any tribe I've ever met. I have a bad feeling we're looking at the father of several sons, and now he has one fewer."

Tormel separates from the merchants' huddle. "What's this, then? Murdered in our sleep? Well, really!"

Tilara looks at the scars and general appearance. "Stormwinds. Almost certainly. This is .... not good." She lets Starguard finish healing her, stretching luxuriously as the magic knits her back together. "Thanks." She gives the cleric a hug.

Tilara says, "Ever seen anything like them, Tormel?"

Starguard chuckles, hugging the young lady back. "I think they've paid for their foolishness, Tormel. I can't heal the one."

Tormel leans over the bandits, examining each of them by turn while holding a burning brand over his head. He tsk tsks at the scarification, which is less advanced on the two other trussed up bodies. Finally stepping back, he goes to the cart get a lantern. Moments later, he's buried in his journal.

Yuri says, "Stormwinds? Here? We're weeks from the mountains."

Starguard says, "A raiding party, gone deep?"

Tormel looks up. "Probability of Stormwinds is low, actually. Not with those scars."

Tilara says, "No? What, then?"

Yuri looks at Tormel. "Well, what do you think? They have a really odd accent."

Tormel looks troubled, and resumes flipping through pages. "I don't know. I didn't recognize what he was shouting, either."

Yuri sighs. "Well, when they come around, we can ask them some questions. If we can get them to stop shouting. I don't know what he was saying but I'm pretty sure it included dark references to my lineage."

Starguard says, "They're pretty well tied for the moment. Let's make sure they don't have anymore weapons, though."

Tormel puts the lantern down by the bandits, and begins sketching the scarifications on a blank page. He moves just far enough out of the way so that Starguard can examine them. Not that the bandits are carrying any non-obvious weapons. Cheese, after all, never counts as a weapon. Even when it should.

Yuri nods, and searches the bandits.

Starguard hmms. "Alright folks. Back to bed. We want to leave tomorrow morning."

Stormy nods, staying close to Tilara. He even moves his bedroll, just so he can sleep next to her and keep her safe.

Tilara casts a detect magic, just to be sure, but as she expects, finds nothing.

Yuri sighs, and returns the small bag of pebbles to the bandit. The weapons are kept safely out of reach. "Whoever's on watch, one of you keep an eye on these jokers. Wake me immediately when one regains consciousness. Otherwise, I think it's time to go back to sleep." He then goes to explain the situation to the merchants.

The merchants take the news with remarkable composure, and soon they're back under their wagons, gone back to sleep.
