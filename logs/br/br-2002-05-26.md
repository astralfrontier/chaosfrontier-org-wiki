Game Log: Chapter 24 - Lost Children


----------------------------------------

After a short and heated battle, the brunt of which was suffered by Tilara, the attackers had been subdued. One lay dead, the other three lay tied up, their great axes and javelins thoughtfully stored out of harm's way. Out of reach of the attackers, too. The merchants have, in fact, gone back to sleep, while the guards are all restless and prowling around the camp.

Two of the attackers lies, hands tied, eyes open as they carefully observe. The third keeps struggling to sit up, his hands working furiously against the ropes.

Tilara is resting, letting the healing magics finish working. Having a spear stuck through one's lung is always a bit debilitating, no matter how skillful the healer is.

Yuri sits out of reach of the captives, watching them carefully.

He smiles, ominously, and spits at Starguard's feet. "Bora 'ch ceilliau 'n amrwd! Laddaist 'm chyfaill!"

Starguard says, "I'm going to assume that was an insult. You're lucky we didn't kill the four of you. What the heck possesses you to attack this many armed men is beyond me."

Tilara stirs as the bandit starts talking. "Can you make heads or tails of that dialect, Yuri? It's not Mar, and it's not Lurinese, either."

Yuri smiles back, sweetly. "Greetings. I assume you can't understand me, which is unfortunate because I'd like to tell you to behave or we'll run you through."

Yuri says, "I've never heard it before..."

Starguard shrugs, sitting down to meditate in the fading starlight. "Neither have I. Check with Tormel."

Yuri says, "He's asleep. He doesn't recognize the scarification."

Yuri looks around for a waterskin, and carefully offers it to one of the bandits. "There's no reason to act brutish, though."

The man spits once more, even from his awkward position. "Bastardiaid!" He glares at the whole group, and then scornfully closes his eyes, ignoring the offered water bottle.

Yuri sighs.

Yuri says, "Incorrigible. Big Joe was easier to deal with."

Yuri tries the other bandit, ignoring the one thrashing on the ground for now.

Yuri says, "Anybody find any maker's marks on their weapons?"

Yuri says, "Well, anybody know what the next town is? Maybe they're locals."

Yuri says, "Or perhaps a local problem."

Yuri says, "Well, what are we going to do with them? We just turn them loose, they'll probably try to mug us."

Yuri says, "They'll be troublesome to bring along."

Tilara says, "They'll be more troublesome to leave behind, I think. If they've got friends, they'll get loose and bring reinforcements."

Stormy stays back a little, watching Harry patrol with Ash.

Yuri says, "Hey, Harry! You got any idea who these guys are?"

Harry moves forward. "I'm not sure. I think ... no. I think that that would be too fantastical."

Yuri says, "You think they're Stormwinds?"

Harry shakes his head. "Stormwinds don't scarify like that. Those are **made** scars, not **earned** scars."

Tilara says, "It can't be any more fantastical than what we've come up with so far. How do you think they got those scars, if they're not deliberate?"

Harry turns to look at Tilara. "But I do think they're deliberate. Stormwinds take pride in their battle scars, but a battle scar isn't made, it's suffered."

Yuri says, "So... who are they?"

Tilara says, "Oh. All right, now we know what we're talking about. Who do you think they are?"

Harry shrugs. "Don't know. Haven't seen 'em before. But the omens are beginning to look ominous."

Tilara just raises a sardonic eyebrow at that. "Aye..."

Harry nods once, decisively. "Aye.

Yuri says, "OK. So how about we take them to the next village and leave them there?"

Tilara says, "Maybe they'll know more about them, at any rate. Sounds like a good idea."

Harry nods again. "Glencorgan'll take 'em. The army's always looking for levies."

Tilara murmurs, "As long as they don't end up with Ferg..." Mirra purrs agreement.

The remainder of the night passes slowly. Determined to build a bridge of communication, Starguard tries hard to make a good breakfast. Alas, the porridge is burnt, the sausage is overdone, and the tea is spilt. And one of the eggs was rotten.

Starguard grumbles. "See what happens when I don't get my sleep?" He sighs, and eats what ever he can manage. "Sorry folks. Probably better off on trail rations this morning."

Andreth crunches a sausage. "Save that for when we need it. At least trail rations keep."

Mirra turns her nose up at the scorched sausage, and pointedly wanders off to find her own breakfast. She eventually brings back a mouse for Tilara, as well.

Tilara says, "It's edible, Starguard. Just not up to your usual standard. We'll survive."

The three captives sniff the offered breakfast once, and then resolutely turn their heads away. Even the mouthiest one stays silent.

Starguard pushes down some lumpy glop disguising itself as porridge. "I can't blame them for not eating this, though."

Yuri grumbles tiredly. "Well, at least it shut them up."

Yuri says, "Anyway, let's get moving. Let's see if we can make better time today, I don't want these jokers with us longer than they have to be. We'll put them on the Company cart and secure their bindings to the boards, so that they don't get up and hit the driver over the head."

The merchants, smelling the burnt food, pointedly break their own fasts on day-old bread and cheese, with boiled eggs. Then, with the aid of Harry and Dickon, the horses are hitched to the wagons again while Jermiah and Perf keep watch.

Andreth mumbles something _sotto voce_ about how if the caravan business doesn't work out, we could all get good jobs as jail guards.

Starguard does the dishes, and camp is packed into the wagons. "Alright, tie those three up, and let's march."

Soon the three bandits are bundled into the cart. Masci offers to carry the weapons on his cart, carefully bundled in the company tarp. Tormel, looking at the cart's inhabitants, decides to walk today, pointedly letting someone else do the driving. He meanders over to Starguard, and begins to speak learnedly of the making of potions.

Starguard listens carefully, commenting on things to make sure he understands the idea.

Soon the caravan is underway. Everyone is paying just that little bit more attention, what with the unexpected night. But the day is sunny enough to lift anyone's spirits, and by noon people are somewhat more relaxed. Although the caravan continues marching right thorough the noontime meal, and it isn't until late afternoon, when they reach the next large camp site, that the party halts. By then Tormel has nigh exhausted his throat in speaking, and has begun to resort to grunts. The three bandits are still glaring at everyone, and if looks could kill, the party would be requesting a few more geases.

The campsite, much like the previous one, consists of a small field some forty yards off-road. Here, too, is a stack of firewood. Harry looks at it, troubled. "Yuri; you did remember to pay for the wood we used, didn't you?"

Yuri looks blank for a moment. "Umm... oops."

Yuri says, "I'll leave twice as much here tonight. In the excitement of getting robbed I forgot."

There's also a small well, and a well-used fire pit. No sign pointing to the latrine, but on the other hand, you can see the small hut from here. There's no trees to obscure the view; only bushes mark the edges.

Starguard joins in the unpacking, putting supper over a quickly made fire. He relaxes, stretching, making sure the tarp's up right, the bandits are moderately comfortable, the place looks safe... And then the smell of burnt meat assails him, reminding him of the stew he hasn't stirred in half and hour. He curses, running back to knock the pot over, spilling part of the stew, which results in more cursing, and the old cleric stalking off into the woods, leaving the stew to the less fortunate.

Tormel looks at the retreating cleric, and grunts something about honeyed tea. Then he turns to Gerard. "Sell me a drop?"

Yuri sighs, and rummages through his pack for hardtack and beef jerky.

Yuri says, "Methinks the Brother is letting the situation get to him."

Tilara sighs. "This is not a good day for the cook, apparently."

Yuri again offers water to the horse thieves.

Gerard nods at Tormel, and holds out a small bottle. "Try this." Tormel, accepting the bottle, takes a small sip and smiles. "Ah; 'tis a kindness to a man's throat, that." He also begins to weave just a little.

The thieves look at Yuri. The mouthy one spits, in his face. "Borwn na gwenwyna, bechgyn chan eist!"

Yuri loses his temper and smacks the mouthy bandit across the face. "Show some godsdamn respect."

Yuri drops the waterskin at the bandit's feet and stalks off to the latrine.

The bandit leans back with the blow, eyebrows rising to the heavens. "Na cowards!" Stretching his foot, he kicks the waterskin off the cart.

With the exception of the meal, the evening progresses well. The bandits remain unnaturally quiet, and watchful, while the merchants work hard to ignore them. The horses are tended, the stew is rescued, Brother Starguard is consoled, and the night passes.

The morning finds the bandits still sitting as they were; they look to have hardly shifted in the night. Their eyes closed, they are emitting ungodly snores that can be heard from beyond the latrine. The weather is still fine; a good spring day to get the last of the crops into the ground.

Starguard wakes in the early morning, praying for guidance and help from the stars, then goes about his morning routine methodically. As the sun rises, the most wonderful smells fill the camp, rousing sleepers with promises of well-cooked omelets, a sort of a breakfast mess of eggs and veggies and meat. Pancakes too.

Stormy is lined up next to the campfire, plate in hand, only moments before Tormel joins him. And the merchants are not far behind. The bandits, on the other hand, have closed their eyes.

Starguard grins, smiling, dealing out omelet and pancake to the growing line. "Sorry about yesterday folks. I lost my temper. Tea's over there, should be about ready. And a little honey for your throat, Tormel."

Tilara smiles as she wakes up to the promise of a delicious breakfast. "That's the Starguard we all know and love. You just had a bad day."

Tormel smiles gratefully at Starguard. "The jenever helped, too. Left a bit of a headache, but did wonders. I'll teach the boy today; he has more questions."

Stormy soon sidles up close to Starguard, mouthing something about seconds, and still being hungry, and being a growing boy ...

Yuri says, "I'd like you to finish up teaching me about... that way of writing... when we get to Glencorgan."

Starguard grins, and makes up a plate for the bandits, going over to check on them. He's even made the portions right, and those who can manage seconds will be able to get them...

The bandits completely ignore the proffered food, the only reaction is a vehement "Borwn na gwenwyna!"

Tilara watches as Starguard offers a plate. "Not unexpected. They haven't accepted anything from us yet. If they're trying to kill themselves by thirst, they've made a good start on it."

Yuri says, "They've gone two days without water. I hope they intend to drink something once they're in town or it's going to get really unhealthy for them. Fortunately, it won't be our problem."

Andreth shrugs. "If'n their pride's stronger 'n their will to live, 'tis not our fault."

Starguard says, "Starvation diet, huh?" He grins, leaving the plate just out of reach of their feet and eats his own, smiling at the taste. "Hmm. Too bad we didn't bring any beer. The next town, I guess." The smell wafts around the bandits, taunting them.

The bandits don't seem to notice the taunting. Much. Although the leader has begun to lead the other two in what appears to be a religious chant.

Yuri says, "Tormel, do you have any idea what they're speaking? They seem really out of place here."

Starguard says, "It's not like we're trying to poison them. It is from the same pot."

Tormel shakes his head, watching the chanting from afar. "I don't recognize the language, which is surprising. It seems to have few if any common roots. And those scarifications ... My. But ... hmmm. I wonder why they chant."

Yuri says, "I dunno. It's... uh... it's not a spell, is it?"

Tormel pulls out his journal even as he shakes his head. "Not a spell precisely. A prayer, I believe. An invocation. They mention Andvarr. Let me see."

Starguard says, "Clerical? How...interesting. So we're heathens."

Yuri looks blank. "Which one is Andvarr?"

After paging through his journal for a while, he purses his lips. "Fascinating. Truly fascinating. I wonder why ... If they are ... How extremely fascinating." he keeps reading for a while, muttering under his breath, while the bandits continue to chant.

Yuri starts to look worried.

Yuri says, "Tilara... Starguard... are they trying to cast a spell? Can we stop them?"

Tilara says, "It doesn't sound like a spell, really..."

Tilara says, "But we can always gag them if it's getting on your nerves."

Starguard ehs. "Probably a meditative chant. Trying to be strong against the temptation of breakfast. Alright guys, I'll take it away. Anyone for another plateful?"

Andreth says, "Me, afore we do that, I'd like to hear what's got Tormel so excited."

Tilara nods. "I agree with Andreth. If they're talking, we might learn something."

Andreth gives Tormel a significant glance... mindful of the fact that the professor's probably got his nose buried so deep in the journal that he won't even notice.

Yuri nudges Tormel on the shoulder. "If they're about to do something dangerous, we need to know, now."

Tormel sits up straight, his finger poised over an entry in the journal. "Yes! I swear; I must be the only man alive who! Oh dear! Well! This **will** be worth a pretty penny!"

Tilara says, "You know what they are?"

Yuri says, "It won't be worth anything if they bring down the wrath of some God on us. Who are they?"

Tormel slams his journal shut. "Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh **my** yes. These are the lost children of Andvarr. That's what the scarifications represent. Labyrinths. They carry the maps where others can see them, to help them home again! Ah!" He darts forward, journal open again to a blank page, and begins copying out the scars very very carefully.

Yuri keeps an eye on Tormel and the bandits, expecting one of them to kick at him or something. "Starguard, who is Andvarr?"

Andreth looks curious. "...labyrinths, eh? Same ones y'told us about the other night? Or a different one?"

Yuri says, "Which, Jorda's labyrinth? Is he related to Andvarr? I'm guessing that he's an underground god?"

Tormel nods. "Yes! Legend has it that Andvarr, first of the Lost Children, did much of the tunneling for Jurdah. I wonder if ... hmmm. He turns to the bandits, and passes one hand, palm outwards, over his eyes. The chanting stops.

Tilara watches curiously.

The bandits now watch Tormel intently, as he leafs through his journal, looking more and more worried by the moment. Finally, he stops at another page, and shows them a small heraldic symbol. The leader raises an eyebrow, watching curiously.

Starguard peers curiously at Tormel. "I don't remember anything, to be honest, Yuri..."

Tormel sighs. "I'm on retainer, aren't I?"

Yuri says, "Yes, you are. But you're free to renegotiate if you like. Although I'd really appreciate it if you didn't endanger anyone's life by withholding information."

Yuri says, "Besides, if you're thinking to part company from us to follow this lot home, you'd be risking your own life. They seem as likely to gut you for spite as anything else."

Tormel shakes his head. "You're in no danger from these lost children. They'll not harm you now. Though they'll not drink your water. But ... I could easily get hundreds of silvers for this at Citadel. It goes against the grain to ... " He pauses, invitingly.

Stormy scowls at Tormel, waiting near Tilara.

Tilara says, "We'll not undercut your price, good scholar. But we are curious, and it may help our own quest."

Yuri sighs. "We cannot turn aside from our mission to Citadel, learned one."

Starguard says, "If we hadn't signed you, you wouldn't have never learned this at all."

Yuri says, "And we could not aid you in yours unless it directly coincides with ours. Is there any chance that they may know who Samaela is?"

Yuri says, "And if you happen to know... what _will_ they drink? I have little patience with brutes but I'd like to avoid being one myself."

"Enfin, yes, well. The basic legend suggests - and this is a very old legend so I am not entirely certain how to calculate plausibilities - but as I was saying, legend suggests that these Lost Children carry a map of the Jurdah Labyrinth. Gather them all together, and you will see all of history before you. But none ever may see the scar he carries on her own face." Tormel leans forward, fingering his dagger. "The scalps sell for much gold, sir. And they'll drink beer."

Yuri scowls. "What do you mean, scalps?"

Masci, who has been listening to the entire conversation, grins. "I've family up northwards, where they work the mines. Water's foul underground, they tell me."

Tormel blanches. "You know, sir? He points at the bandit's face. "Scalps; mostly the facial skin."

Starguard says, "I've been in places too where you wouldn't drink the water, but the beer's OK. Anybody have any?"

"Connoisseurs will pay a great deal for these maps." Tormel shrugs. "Pictures are copied too easily; collectors won't buy 'em."

Gerard, listening in, shakes his head. "Nay; but I can sell you a small flask of jenever at cost. Cut about a hundred to one, it approaches the weakness of beer."

Yuri says quietly, "Are you seriously suggesting that we cut off these mens' faces to sell for money?"

Tormel shakes his head. "No sir, of course not, sir, no sir. I'm just commenting on the value these men hold."

Tilara says, "You're only commenting, I hope. I suspect we'd best let them loose again if that kind of vileness is a possibility."

Starguard says, "Suddenly, I feel very iffy about dropping these men off in town."

Andreth nods, scowling. "Value to others, danger to themselves."

Tormel nods energetically at Tilara. "Of course, of course, idle discourse only, I assure you!"

Starguard nods to Gerard, and buys a little off him, cutting it with water, preparing a drink for the prisoners.

Yuri says, "Umm... Gerard, you don't have anything less potent, do you?"

Yuri says, "Or possibly less expensive?"

Gerard shakes his head, as he follows Starguard. "Nay; we're sending only the finest to Citadel."

Yuri says, "Harry, are any of you lot carrying a hip-flask, perchance?"

Looking at Starguard, who is holding a waterskin, Gerard sighs. "That's not enough water to cut this. I can share a sip from my own personal supply, but no more'n that, mind." Pulling out a smaller flask yet from inside his tunic, he dribbles a small amount into the waterskin. "'Tis only for your cooking that I do this, Brother."

Harry shakes his head. "Nay. I'll have no drunkards on guard."

Yuri raises an eyebrow, but says nothing about Starguard's cooking.

Starguard says, "For today's cooking, that is." He chuckles, capping it, shaking it up. Uncapping it, he offers it to the bandits, letting them smell it first.

"Today and most other days, Brother. Yer a fine cook for such an old fellow." Gerard laughs, putting away his flask.

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "If we let them go... is there any way we can find them again?"

Each of the bandits, in turn, takes a long sip after cautiously smelling the liquid. The leader even smiles, momentarily, at Starguard.

Yuri murmurs, "Magically, I mean. Something like the feathers."

Tilara shrugs. "There are ways. I'm afraid I'm not skilled enough to know them."

Starguard chuckles, letting the bandits drink deeply. They're likely dehydrated. "The young have no patience for cooking."

Tormel listens intently and speaks ingratiatingly, eager to make amends: "There's always the Peak."

Yuri says, "What's the Peak?"

Tilara says, "The Peak?"

Tormel smiles. "Wilthorwen's Peak. Surely you know of it?"

Tilara says, "Not as much as I should. What about it?"

Tormel shrugs. "Well, that's where Wilthorwen and Kenilthwen live; they share a house at the summit. Lesser mortals worship on the flanks of the mountains, for to climb her is ... impossible."

Yuri says, "Isn't that all the way up the escarpment, north of Calais? If that's where they're from, they're a really long way from home. How did they get here, tunnels?"

Starguard says, "Maybe they're searching for something. Anyone know a little Calais?"

Tormel shakes his head. "Nay; they're not from there. But there you can leave messages for them, and they will come to you in the night. Supposedly. I have no records of a message being answered or delivered in well-nigh four hundred years."

Starguard says, "Stormy, didn't you mention knowing the language, once?"

Starguard smiles. "Erm, Tormel... They've spoke to me in my dreams..."

Stormy nods, slowly. "A little ... but Calais is a different language. More ... More guttural; less graceful."

Starguard nods. "They may know it, though. Try to speak to them?"

Tilara says, "I think he meant messages to the Children, Starguard. Not to the Gods themselves."

Yuri says, "I wonder, then, if they're trying to answer someone's message. If that's what's brought them so far into unfamiliar territory."

Starguard ahs to Tilara. "My pardons."

Stormy nods, approaching slowly. "Hei, hvordan er De?" The bandits look at Stormy, listening intently. The leader finally nods. "Hei."

Yuri stands quietly near Stormy.

Tilara hrmms. "I wouldn't think they'd be trying to steal horses if they were --" She stops and listens intently as the leader answers Stormy.

Stormy nods, emboldened. "Gjr De hvorfor angriper oss? Gjr De hvorfor slss?"

Starguard slaps his forehead. "They were going somewhere, and needed to be there fast."

The bandit leans forward, and haltingly answers "De har hester. Vi ... trenger hester. Vi ... reiser ... fort."

Yuri asks quietly, "What are you telling them, Stormy?"

Stormy nods at Starguard. "I ... think ... they're in a hurry to get somewhere." He turns back to the bandits. "De stjeler hester?" The bandit nods, once, his face completely blank. "Guden kommanderer."

Tilara says, "Well, it was a bad idea to throw pointy sticks at me after they'd been seen. They lost a party member and a day of time. Foolishness. If they'll promise not to do it again, I suppose we can let them go."

Stormy ohs, and steps back. "M'lady, Yuri, they say they need horses. They need to travel fast. I think ... I think they are ordered to do so."

Starguard says, "Let's find out where they're heading, first. And what they're up to. Can you ask them, Stormy?"

Yuri says, "Ask them where they're going. If it's somewhere on the way for us, this might not be as much of a problem."

Stormy nods, once, at Yuri. "Hvor De drar? Og hvorfor?" He turns back, "I'm asking them where they go, and why."

The bandit leader sighs, once. "Vi reise til slette og skog, vtil sjo, vi ... forteller ... ummmm ... budskap av ... ummm ... undergang."

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "His grasp of Calaisan must be pretty weak. He might not have enough words in common with Stormy."

Stormy moves closer to Tilara. "They're foretelling a ... something ... of .. ummm ... doom. And they're heading ... ummmm ... to plain? And Forest? And sea? I don't understand their answer."

Yuri says, "Do we have any paper maps of the Empire?"

Starguard says, "Didn't you copy down a map, Til?"

Tormel nods at Yuri. "In my chest, I have a small atlas.

Tilara nods. "Yes, we've got one here somewhere. Although Tormel's is probably better."

Yuri says, "Either will do. Can we show them?"

Yuri turns to Stormy. "Tell them that we're going to let their leader's hands loose, so he can see the map. And tell them... hmm... tell them that we're also 'under orders' but we mean them no additional ill will."

Tormel nods, and sighs. Climbing on to the cart, he carefully opens his chest using two separate keys, and pulls out a slim book of maps. Opening it, he shows Yuri the empire map. "Guard this atlas well; I'll have no fingerprints on it.

Yuri nods, and waits for Stormy to deliver the message, watching the Andvari leader to see his reaction.

Stormy nods and begins to speak to the bandit, his hands moving energetically. "Vi viser De et kart. Vi loser Deres hender bare. Vi er under forskjellige rekkefolger, en geas." He points at Tormel, who brings the map closer. The bandit points at the coastline, and the great forests, and the plains, his hand sweeping across it. "Dod regner ned fra himmelen! Barn dor! Folket forlater. Det er fire."

Stormy looks worried now, biting his lip. "He speaks of death raining from the sky, and people leaving, and then there are four ... I ..." He shakes his head. "It makes no sense to me, to be honest.

Tilara says, "Four. Ask him, four what? Four spires, mayhaps?"

Yuri says, "Also ask him if they intend to stop it."

Starguard says, "Try to give it to us best you can, and we'll try to piece it together..."

Stormy nods. "Fire? Fire hva?" The bandit grumbles, his hand sweeping again across the map. "Fire folk. Fire verden. Fire riker." Stormy turns to Tilara. "He says four people, or worlds, or empires." He turns back to the bandit. "Vill De stanser det? Will you stop it?" The bandit shakes his head slowly. "Vi advarer. Vi heter."

Tormel listens intently, then snorts. "They will warn us, eh? Fah. Useless."

Yuri says, "I... think I understand."

Starguard winces. "This sounds important, but we can't turn from our path."

Yuri sits in front of the bandit leader, and looks at him carefully. "Who is Samaela?"

Yuri says, "Stormy, ask him if one of the four leaders is Samaela."

The bandit cringes away from Yuri, his hands lifted to ward his face. "Tale ikke at kaller! Hun forbudt! Forbudt! Hun er god og ond!" Stormy, on cue, delivers a translation. "Don't say that. Forbidden. Forbidden! Good and evil!"

Starguard blinks. They know of Samaela! o.o

Yuri stands, and nods.

Andreth glances at Starguard. "You heard the man - don't say it." A faint smile touches his face, but his tone is dead serious.

Yuri says, "It seems that we may have part of our mission in common. They probably want to travel faster than we can, with the caravan. I think we can either let them travel with us, or let them go alone, or... I don't think we can spare the horses."

Tilara says, "I guess. Stormy, can you find out why it's a forbidden name?"

Stormy, at Yuri's request, tries again. "Hvem er ... ummmm .... Sa ... Er hun en leder?" The man shakes his head. "Forbudt! Forbudt! **Forbudt!** Tale ikke av henne, hun ikke visst!" Stormy hmmms, pulling Yuri back a few paces and whispering in his ear. "She seems to be forbidden. He says not to speak of her, that she must not be known."

Yuri says, "Stormy... are you certain that he said it's a she?"

Tilara mutters a curse. "So how do they know that she's forbidden? I hate arcane taboos."

Stormy nods, once. "Henne ... is her. Ham is him. Is very different."

Tilara says, "We're getting somewhere, then. It is a name, and a female one... and the Lost Children are afraid of her."

Starguard says, "We'll have to send a message back to the Brothers."

Yuri hmms. "I think that we should suggest that they travel with us. We can take them to Citadel, and they can get a boat south from there. We need to deliver the caravan, but I think we may also need to follow these men. They know the Answer already. Or part of it, anyway."

Yuri says, "Anyway, that's one thing we can do. Anyone else have some ideas?"

Starguard nods. "It'd be the fastest way, I think, for them. I would like to follow them."

Tilara says, "Or even travel with them. If they're at risk for their skins, they might need someone to screen them. Travel with them, perhaps? Get horses at Citadel, if they're headed that way?"

Yuri looks at Starguard, Andreth, and Ash. "Sound OK to you?"

Starguard says, "Sounds good to me. The question is, what do they think of it. Can you explain where we're headed, Stormy?"

Andreth rubs his chin. "I dunno. If they're in this much of a hurry, they may not wanna wait for us."

Yuri says, "If they're not going to wait for us, I don't think it's a real good idea to try and keep them here. If they're in that kind of hurry, lives could be on the line. No matter what they know, we can't keep them here selfishly."

Stormy nods, and turns to face the bandit again. Pointing at Citadel in the center of the map, he says "Vi er overskrift til Citadel. Det er mange hester der." Turning to Starguard, he translates. "I told him we're heading to Citadel, and that there are horses there." The bandit, meanwhile nods, one finger tracing the position of Citadel. "Vi besoker Citadel. Vi advarer Zamua."

Yuri sighs.

Starguard says, "Yeah, but if they go off on their own, they might get attacked by anyone who gets a look at their face."

"They're going to Citadel, to warn Zamua."

Yuri says, "Tell him that Citadel is the capital of the lands that are in danger... huh? Who's that?"

Starguard says, "Invite them with us? We're a little slower, but at least they'll all get here."

Yuri says, "Stormy, now might be a good time to tell him that their face is a danger. People who recognize them may try to kill them for it."

Stormy turns to the bandits. "Reis med oss? Hvem er Zamua?" The bandit nods, once. Then he points at himself. "Karlsefni." He points at his companions. "Thord. Arnlaug."

Tormel smiles broadly. "They're harmless now. They've introduced themselves."

Starguard says, "Nice to meet you."

Yuri says, "Is that significant? Like a promise or something?"

Starguard offers the remains of breakfast to the trio, idly grinning at reforming another bunch of bandits...

Tormel nods. "Strangers can be killed; but people who know you ... become family. And brother does not kill brother."

Yuri says, "I suggest that we introduce ourselves, then."

The bandits eagerly consume the remains of the breakfast, after which the leader looks inquisitively at Stormy. Finally he points a finger at him. Stormy, taking the cue, points at himself. "Firestorm."

Tilara says, "I was going to say..."

Starguard says, "Starguard."

Tilara bows. "Tilara." She calls her familiar to her, and picks her up. "And my companion, Mirra."

Yuri says, "Yuri." He points at the others, the merchants and the guards, and briefly names each.

Starguard grins. "I always found that sharing food is my bridge."

Tilara grins. "Didn't work yesterday..."

The lead bandit smiles at Mirra, offering her a piece of the cheese in his pocket. Mirra, and anyone else within range of the fumes, turns a little green. Smiling, the bandit offers again, then shrugs, and shares it with his fellows.

Yuri says, "Stormy, please invite them to travel with us. We can protect them as far as Citadel, and we should be there in three weeks. In either case I'd like to tell Karlsefni about our mission."

Tilara finishes untying the three once the introductions are completed. "We'll have to learn your language, I think."

Andreth rubs his chin and glances at Yuri. "If they know we're tryin' to find out about a forbidden name, what'll they think?"

Stormy spends some more time talking with the lead bandit, and together they pore over the atlas, Tormel watching anxiously. Finally, unable to bear it, he taps Karlsefni on the shoulder and requests his atlas back, before safely stowing it in his chest.

Tilara says, "A very good question... but if we're now brothers, they'd probably just abandon us to whatever retribution they're worried about."

Yuri says, "I think we have to be honest with them about that part, Andreth. I have a suspicion that we're not going to like who... she... is, and that she'll bring war to the Empire."

Yuri says, "If that's the case... then that's something that we'll all want to prevent. It's their mission and in short order it would be ours as well."

Andreth nods a little. "Maybe it's just the name they fear. Speak her name, and she might hear it?"

Starguard says, "Perhaps ask about she who can not be named?"

Yuri says, "I think we'll just tell them that it's a matter of life and death to us to find out who she is, and leave it up to them what to do about it. Stormy already told them we're under a geas."

Yuri says, "If they know what a geas is, they'll understand what our problem is."
