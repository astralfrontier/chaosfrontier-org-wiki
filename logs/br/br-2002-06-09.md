Game Log: Chapter 26 - Expanded Family and Increased Rivalries


------------------------------------------------------------------

After a restless night in the serai, with music, dancing, and good food a plenty, the caravan slowly wakes. It's going to be a long somnolent day, as most of the other groups are still struggling out of bed. Then again, they're not planning on leaving today.

Ash will take a few moments, in the early hours, to address a few questions to any guardsmen or town representative he can track down... hoping to at least find one with wakefulness and wits about him.

Starguard is up as early as always, watching the stars fade as he prays, getting breakfast ready. Soon, the smell of breakfast tea, sausage and eggs fill the air.

Yuri pays the four caravan guards this morning, thinking, _At least this way they won't blow it all on ale._

Harry grins, counting out his money. "It's been an easy job so far, hasn't it lads?" The others, gathering round, nod.

Tilara sorts herself out and wakes Stormy, as well. "Mostly, so far. There were a couple of interesting moments, though...."

Starguard chuckles. "I don't know. You've had to eat my cooking on bad days..."

Dickon grins. "Warn't so bad. Perf over here's a worse cook'n you'll eve' see." Perf, insulted, punches Dickon in the shoulder. "I dinnae hear **you** volunteering to cook."

Starguard hits the side of his pan. "Cut it out, gentlemen, and come 'n get it."

Mirra wanders over to look at breakfast cooking, and purrs at Starguard hoping for a snack.

Starguard tosses a few sausage bits over to the feline, smiling. He's made more than enough for the small army that is the caravan.

Yuri checks over the carts to make sure nothing is missing, and checks on the food. _We should have more than enough, even with the Andvari... hmm... where are they this morning?_

The Andvari roll out from underneath the sleeping platform, Karlsefnir grinning broadly. Within moments they've made a beeline for the cooking fire.

Starguard offers the tea first, curious if they'll accept it. A little ale is in reserve for the northerners.

Karlsefnir investigates the tea, sipping it carefully but grimacing a lot.

Tilara says, "Stormy... could you ask him what's wrong? Is it the flavor, or the temperature?"

As he spots Ash leaving the serai, Kovan steps forth to challenge him. "Greetings, traveler. What seek you?"

Stormy turns to Karlsefnir, and together they mutter for a while. "I think it's the taste, m'Lady. And the temperature. Tastes like volcanic runoff, he says."

Ash yawns a bit, still shackled by sleep, but manages to form a coherent sentence. "... Was wondering if Perfirin had report of missing persons, especially children or young people.. or if you'd had..." Again a yawn stifled. ".. reports.. from other towns?"

Starguard nods, and offers the weak ale.

Yuri reminds Starguard, "They prefer alcohol in anything... something about living underground, I recall."

Tilara nods. "Ah-hah. We do have clean water, or there's ale, I think."

Andreth follows Ash curiously, staying silent as his companion converses with Kovan.

Karlsefnir accepts the ale, sips it cautiously, and then shares it with his men. He nods once, at Starguard, and the Andvarri sit slightly apart to break their fasts.

Kovan hmmmms. "Funny you should ask. Perhaps you should speak to our captain. If you'll follow me?" The guard waves his hand, pointing at the serai, and new guards fall in both behind Ash and Andreth, and at the serai entrance. The smaller group walks towards the barracks, and are led into an office. "Wait here, I'll fetch the captain." With that, Kovan leaves Ash and Andreth in the small room, closing the door behind him.

Ash waits patiently, mumbling to himself, still half-asleep. "..gottamap"

Andreth shakes Ash gently. "Wake up, friend..."

Ash stirs a bit. "Map!" he bursts out, "I've got to have a map..oh, Andreth, sorry, I've been thinking..." Again he subsides into an uncomfortable calm, but he's no longer asleep. "... hawks, even big ones, probably don't eat kids. But why else would they want one?"

Andreth hmms quietly. "Can't imagine. Or rather, don't want to..." He makes a face.

Kovan opens the door again, and an older man steps in. "This is Branric, captain of the guard. He has a few questions for you." The older man nods at the chairs around the desk. "If you'll take a seat, gentlemen? Kovan mentioned you had some questions."

Ash sits dutifully, and repeats his inquiry - minus the yawns. Missing children or young people, or reports of the same.

Branric nods. "I'm surprised to hear you ask. But yes, we've been losing the odd kid here and there. Mostly urchins, so the town leaders aren't too worried yet."

Ash nods slowly. "And this may be important - were they usually in town, or out and about? Do you know for sure of any that went missing while outside?"

Branric looks thoughtful, and turns to Kovan. Kovan, in turn, shrugs. "We're not sure. Most of them weren't missed for days, so ..." Branric turns to look Ash directly in the eye. "Why do you ask?"

Ash answers evenly. "There'd been a story we were told of a giant hawk swooping down upon a family and seizing a child, out of nowhere. Very, very peculiar. Then just last night I heard tell of more, unnatural wolves stalking travellers and more, and we ourselves--" gesturing at his young companion "-- MET some of these very beasts." He pauses to let this sink in. "About how long ago did you notice the disappearances, if I can ask a last question?"

Andreth nods quietly in confirmation as he is indicated, subconsciously raising a hand to his throat to touch the scar there.

Branric hmmms, vaguely, looking only briefly at Andreth. "Well, the first reported loss - though the kid could have just run off with a caravan - was about nine weeks ago. Give or take. The first definite disappearance was four weeks ago. Guildbrat; he was reported missing immediately. And there was no caravan around at the time ..."

Ash frowns, but nods. "Thank you, Captain, for your time.. and," he adds as he rises, "I'd spread the word - keep children close. I don't think this is going to stop on its own." With that, nods politely and makes to rejoin the caravan.

The captain nods. "But thank you for informing us. We'll send messengers to the surrounding towns."

---

Tilara sits back and idly juggles a few balls, just to keep in practice. _We really ought to either get Stormy to sign on to the Company or start paying him for translating. He's doing a bang-up job for us._ She looks around for Yuri, and then sees him wandering down the line of caravans. _Oh, well, I'll ask him when he gets back. In the meantime, the boy gets a share of the last performance we gave, after all..._ She digs up seven silver and goes off to find Stormy.

Stormy, wolfing down his third helpings of breakfast, grins at Tilara. He eyes the money in her hand, but says very little. How could he? His mouth is full.

Tilara sits down with Stormy as he eats. "Just bringing over your share of the last performance we did. Now, this time, don't spend it on rubbish, got it? Make sure what you buy is quality."

Yuri returns from pumping the rumor mill and helps Starguard with the packing up. "It seems that the road ahead is clear, and there's a general undercurrent of a lot of wolf attacks. Someone also brought down a 12-point buck, which is big, but not unnaturally so. And something about slavers in operation hereabouts." Yuri cracks his knuckles. "I hope they try to start something with us. I'd like to take them out, but we can't afford to go out of our way to put them down. So it would be nice if they save us the trouble."

Stormy nods, blushing, and puts the money away carefully.

Tilara says, "Have you thought about joining the company? You're definitely pulling your weight translating for the Andvari, y'know."

Starguard hmmphs. "Be careful what you wish for, Yuri. You might get it." He pauses, looking over to where Tilara and Stormy talk. "I've been thinking. Do you think we should add new members to the company?"

Yuri shrugs. "I find slavery repulsive. I'd go out of my way to stop it, but we have bigger concerns. It would be worth it to me."

Ash returns to the camp in due course, looking gravely thoughtful.

Yuri chuckles. "You mean Stormy, do you? Perhaps. I'd personally like to wait until we get to Citadel, but if everyone else agrees, we can do it here in the field."

Starguard says, "I agree. I'm just thinking what would happen if we were defeated, and pulled from our path while geased." He nods to Yuri. "I think we're almost overdue for bringing him into the fold."

Andreth tilts his head. "Talkin' about makin' Stormy a full member? Sounds good to me..."

Yuri says, "Ah, you're both back. How's the town?"

Yuri says, "I wanted to mention - I've heard rumors about slavers operating hereabouts. But I think our do-gooder reputation precedes us and they told me little more. But I'd like it if we kept our ears open about it."

Ash chuckles softly. "Town was... not what we saw. I need to speak with Tormel... my brain's not enough for this."

Starguard smiles. "If they wander into our path, the stars help them. If they don't...we'll come this was again."

Stormy nods, once, at Tilara. "I'd be ... honoured."

Andreth amplifies on Ash's remark. "There's been coupla reports of missing kids round here. Mostly street kids so far, so they don't know much."

Yuri hmms. "Missing kids... but not large animals? Oh, no. I hope these slavers aren't going after kids."

Tilara smiles. "You're doing the work, and you're going to be better at the magic than I am, pretty soon. I've been learning some other tricks, and it's been distracting me from the magic a little bit. I'll talk to the others about it, but we thought at the beginning that we might take on new members. Finish your breakfast, I think we'll want to move out soon."

Tilara stands and heads over to where the others are talking.

Stormy nods, finishing his breakfast. After which he quickly packs up, and is soon ready to go.

Tilara says, "Find out anything interesting this morning, gentlemen?"

Ash wanders off again, meanwhile, and tracks down Kerron. A brief question is asked, Ash nods, and returns to the camp. ".. 2 years .." he's mumbling. "Gotta talk to Tormel.." With that, he's hunting down the sage already. Somebody's on the trail of something.

Tormel looks up from his journal when he spies Ash. "Yes? Am I teaching you again today?"

Ash shakes his head a little. "Not just yet.. I need a map. I need help with making some notes and such.." Briefly he outlines the animal sightings he's been told so far, in roughly chronological order - 7 weeks ago near Agla's falls in the case of Theo's sighting, proceeding to the present.

Tormel looks intrigued. "You've got a new speculation about the wolves? Hmmm. Hold a moment." He dives back into the cart, and unearths his atlas. Coming back, he opens it to the Aglamar page. "Well, we're here. And the falls are there, and ..."

Noticing the atlas, Stormy turns from his perch on the wagon. He listens intently.

Ash pats Tormel on the arm. "Thanks..." he says quietly. Something's still troubling him, but no more investigation seems forthcoming. "We movin' out?"

Starguard hmms. "Everything packed?" A general affirmative noise rumbles through the caravan. "Let's move out!"

Gathering up the wagons, and the merchants - who this time chose not to imbibe - the caravan moves back on to the road. The Andvarri fall into step in the center, so as to minimize the notice they're attracting. The roads begin to widen, even as the road becomes busier. There's more people heading for Citadel this morning, it seems.

Ash spends what time he can receiving instruction from Tormel, and still looking somber.

The day passes slowly, and steadily. By nightfall, you reach the ubiquitous campsite, with its supply of wood, it's aromatic latrine, and cooking circle.

The guards help the merchants hobble the horses, while the wagons are carefully circled. All of this has become quite routine.

Yuri quietly approaches Masci, the lace merchant, as camp is made, and inquires into any white fabric he might have.

Masci frowns. "Well, I've got lace... can't say as I have any cloth as such. I can sell you lace..."

Masci looks thoughtful. "We have some nice crocheted collars and cuffs, though."

Yuri hmms. "We need some white cloth for a Company ceremony. We don't need a lot... perhaps we can do something with those."

Masci's eyes begin to gleam, just a little. "I can do you a nice set of cuffs. And for you I can minimize the markup. Unless your lady would prefer this nice collar."

Yuri says, "It has to be suitable as an armband. Why don't you show me?"

Masci pulls out a pair of beautiful lady's cuffs, that extend halfway up the elbow, and a dainty lace collar. "These are the plainest I have."

Yuri sighs. "Nope. Sorry, friend. I can't offer you a sale tonight. We'll have to consider this later."

Masci nods, carefully stowing his lace away again.

In the gathering dusk, the entire caravan, including the merchants, the guards, Tormel, and the company proper, gather around the fire. Yuri and Starguard in the middle of the clearing, facing the others.

As evening falls, Starguard says a prayer to the stars and invokes their blessing on the gathering.

Yuri steps forward and makes a short speech. "We, the White Company, were brought together just over five weeks ago. We have accomplished much of import in such a short time; more than many would dare accomplish in a lifetime."

Yuri says, "While the road has been fast and hard, we have made several new friends. Tonight we honor two that have agreed to join their individual quests for glory with our own. Firestorm and Ash, please step forward."

Yuri presents Ash and Stormy each with a parchment scroll, each bound with a small length of woolen cord. "By unanimous vote of the standing members of the White Company, in honor of your unerring loyalty in the face of danger, you are hereby granted full membership in the Company, and all the rights and privileges that come with it. Welcome to the White Company!"

Ash smiles, letting his grim demeanor fall away for awhile. "Thanks," is the only reply he can make.

Starguard claps, smiling at the two new members, happy that the formalities are over.

Tilara stands behind Stormy as his name is called and claps him on the shoulder when the brief ceremony is completed. "Welcome aboard, Firestorm. You've earned it."

Andreth shakes Ash's hand. "You're a good man, Ash. Proud to have you on the team."

Stormy blushes and stammers and holds out his seven silver pieces. "Will this cover my share?"

Ash smiles. "I appreciate it.. hopefully.." But he doesn't - or can't - finish.

Tilara grins and ruffles the boy's hair. "No need. You've been contributing to the Company for a while now, that's something you earned on your own. From now on, you'll get shares like the rest of us."

Starguard nods, smiling. "Nice to have you both officially aboard."

Carefully putting the money away again, Stormy nods. Like an eager puppy, he grins at everyone. The grin is huge. Splits his face in more than two. "I never ... Oh. I ... ummmm .... errr ... what can I do to help, Brother Starguard?"

Starguard grins. "Have supper? Keep up the good work?"

Stormy vibrates, bouncing in place. Then he carefully unrolls the scroll, tracing out the writings, and then folds it flat so that it fits inside his tunic. Then he bounces off to get Starguard more firewood, and more water, and to tell Tormel all about it!

After welcoming Starguard, the party settles down into the usual watches. The night passes wholly uneventfully, although Stormy is the first man up so that he can fetch more water, and feed the horses, and get the firewood, and bounce around happily.

"Hi Starguard! Can I help? What can I fetch? How was watch?" Stormy vibrates in place.

Ash passes his assembled notes around during breakfast, soliciting comments or blank spots he might have missed. ".. This isn't strictly related, but everything seems to have started moving around this time," he remarks, pointing out various jottings.

Tilara says, "At least it doesn't seem to be following us..."

Stormy pores over his shoulder. "Is that when the sightings began? How odd. He points at the Perfirin entry. "Ferg took me there around that time ..."

Yuri says, "Took you where? To Perfirin, or to Woolwich?"

"To Perfirin. He wouldn't say why." Stormy kicks at the dirt.

Tilara says, "Hmm. I'd suspect almost anything of Ferg. You think he might have been doing something with the slavers?"

Stormy shakes his head. "I don't know. He wouldn't let me leave the room at the inn."

Yuri sits back and thinks. "And they renamed the keep to 'Changer's Bane'. The more I think about it, the more I think that this Samaela " - he pronounces the name oddly, so he doesn't disturb the Andvari - " must be related to them."

Tilara says, "Wouldn't let you leave his room...? Why'd he even bother taking you, then?"

Yuri says, "Of course, it's possible that there's two different plots afoot here. One involving kidnappings, and the other involving the wolves. But then why did that hawk try to carry off Kedruin?"

Firestorm becomes very quiet, digging his toe into the ground. "Ummm ... errr ... ah ... errrr ..."

Tilara says, "Hawk and wolves are probably related. Kidnappings might not be."

Ash shrugs helplessly. "I don't know what it means. I just know what happened and when...."

Andreth turns his head, noticing Firestorm's reticence. "It's okay, son, you don't need to talk about it if you don't want to."

Tilara blinks at Stormy's reaction, then thinks back on her younger days with some of the traveling players. "Oh... oh, my. Forget I asked, Stormy. But if you want to talk about it sometime, I'm ready to listen. I've had 'friends' like that myself."

Stormy nods, sitting down very very quietly, up against the wagon. "I'm okay, Tilara. Honest. I'm just ... I'm just hungry, is all."

Yuri says, "Maybe a better pattern will form if we get more dates and places. I'm hoping that we find reason to travel west, when we reach Citadel."

Starguard nods. "We're committed to the spires, for both the sake of what we're searching for, and the caravan."

Tilara nods, tacitly accepting the boy's explanation. "That we can fix."

After a somewhat subdued breakfast, at least on Stormy's part, the caravan resumes its travels. In late afternoon, Yuri on point can see the next town, Branceston.

_Branceston lies slumbering in the open fields surrounding it. No walls, no tall buildings, the place reminds you more of Two Crossings than of Woolwich. Although it's got a few more buildings._

Yuri hmms. "Pretty small... what say we rent the inn and celebrate some?"

Tilara says, "I'd rather wait until we get to Citadel."

Starguard smiles. "I think tonight is for celebration, yes."

Yuri says, "We've got one for and one against. Anybody else want to weigh in?"

Ash nods. "Celebration sounds good."

Stormy takes his cue from Tilara. "I honestly don't mind waiting ..."

Andreth shrugs. "All the same to me."

Ash reconsiders, chuckling. "If you can't get people interested in a celebration, it won't be much of one. So let's wait, hmm?"

Yuri sighs. "Sounds like we're split down the middle on it, anyway. OK, we'll put it off."

Tilara says, "We've still got to get the merchants up to the Citadel before we relax, I think. Time enough to party later."

Masci, taking advantage of the break, climbs down from his wagon. "How long will we stay in Branceston, Yuri?"

Yuri says, "Unless you've got some business to take care of here, I think we'd just like the one night."

Starguard says, "We keep rolling unless you stay stop, I believe."

Tilara says, "That was the idea..."

Gerard waggles his eyebrows at Masci's back. "A woman in every market, eh? What's she like? Does she like threesomes?" Masci whirls around, fists up, and tries to punch Gerard in the nose.

Yuri chuckles. "Well, if you want to make your own arrangements for lodging tonight, feel free, but your cart will be safer if you're near it."

Tilara whirls and sets off a Flare spell between the two fighters. "GENTLEMEN! Not here. Not now."

Masci arghs, hands over his eyes. "Ow! That **hurts**! You little ..."

Gerard, too, complains about his eyes. Although he's still smirking.

Tilara says, "And I can do a lot worse than that, Masci." She turns to the other fellow. "Gerard. Apologize."

Yuri frowns.

Gerard snorts. "Sure; Masci, I apologize for suggesting that your woman is ... easy."

Yuri scowls.

Andreth becomes alert. Tilara seems to have the situation in hand, but he's ready to step in as well if need be.

Starguard looks at Gerard, eyes steely. "Gerard..."

Tilara says, "...A real apology?"

Masci snorts, too, then turns his back on Gerard. "Anyways, just the one night then? You will guard my cart?"

Gerard, looking at Masci's back. "Sure, sure, Tilara. I'm am profoundly disturbed and deeply apologetic that Masci's woman has loose morals."

Yuri says, "We'll take all the usual precautions. But don't hold us up tomorrow."

Tilara just raises an eyebrow, but will let it pass as long as Masci seems not to have noticed.

Masci turns on a copper, diving at Gerard. "You! You! You son of fornicating wolves!"

Tilara sighs and shakes her head. _Damnfool rutting males. Don't know why I even bothered to try..._

Andreth is just as fast, leaping to intervene between Masci and Gerard, bracing himself for Masci's impact.

Masci smashes into Andreth, his fist still pulled back to punch Gerard. His fingers are clenched, and he tries to push Andreth out of the way.

Ash waits patiently, a black look on his face. He makes no move, until Andreth is actually assaulted - at which point he strides toward the journeyman, cracking his knuckles.

Starguard's words and hands flow, and starlike magic settles around Gerard like a vise.

Gerard, frozen in the act of moving behind Andreth, looks panicked.

Andreth rolls with the shove, spins, and pins Masci neatly in his arms. "Enough of that, mister. Y'can't let an asshole like that get your goat."

Ash stops in place, satisfied. "We protect you two gentlemen - even from each other," he remarks coldly. "Are we done here?"

Tilara says, "Most of the master merchants I know ignore insults... they just raise the price they'll charge the fellow who's being rude."

Starguard frowns, holding Gerard firmly in place with his magic...

Masci fumes. "You're right. Children of fornicating wolves have no opinions worth considering. I apologize, for disturbing the peace. And I think, just in case, that I **will** stay with my wagon tonight." He growls, face still entirely black.

Andreth releases Masci, though he does take care to stay between him and Gerard in case he changes his mind.

Yuri steps up and gives a hard stare at both Masci and Gerard. "You heard Ash. You know our job. You will not jeopardize our chances of getting paid, understand? That is all."

Masci stomps off to his wagon, still fuming. Stormy follows behind, quietly. Gerard, meanwhile, fumes until the invisible bonds release, and then steps back up to his seat. "Shouldn't we get moving?"

The caravan pulls into the small town; mostly an excuse to have a large inn, a large green, and a caravanserai. With, as usual, a guard at the entrance, demanding the usual fees. In short, with the exception of Masci and Gerard's rutting in potential displays, everything is just as normal as it always is.

Tilara sits down with Stormy over dinner. "There's more to caravaning than watching out for bandits, after all..."

Stormy nods, listening attentively?

Tilara says, "Almost worse than being attacked is having the teamsters start vendettas against each other. Have to watch out for it."

"Like today? Why was Masci all mad? And why did Gerard go all funny a nd offer weird apologies?" Stormy looks genuinely puzzled.

Tilara says, "Ah... now how would you feel if someone called me names, and implied I would sleep with anybody, Stormy?"

Stormy stands up, fists clenched. "Who said that? Who! I'll ... I'll ... his eyes begin to glow, his hands are turning red where they're clenched at his side."

Tilara pokes the boy. "Nobody did, Stormy, and if they did I'd deal with it myself. But that's what Gerard was saying about Masci's lady."

Stormy relaxes a little, looking wistfully. "I understand, Tilara. I know I'm not good enough to help, but ..."

Tilara says, "You lack experience, not power. Just watch and learn, and ask questions when you don't understand. But now you know why Masci was angry, correct? And Gerard wasn't willing to back down, which was why he was making new insults in his apologies."

Meanwhile Yuri and Tormel are conferring. Tormel has his journal out. "I don't know much about Changers, Yuri. The name, naturally, reflects the fact that in some way they can change, although no-one is entirely certain how. But the name has been associated with a variety of species. Wolves and hawks should come as no surprise. But there have been sightings of unnatural deer, as well."

Stormy nods at Tilara. "I think I do. Sort of."

Tilara says, "And _our_ job is to get them both to Citadel, intact. So we don't let them fight and maybe do some serious damage to each other."

Tormel shakes his head. "I don't know, yet, if these wolves are indeed changers. It would explain some speculations, but confuse others."

After a quiet night, punctuated by two glares that could etch any glass held between a certain pair of merchanter wagons, the caravan gets back on the road. Masci stops, for a moment to chat with Yuri, and arrange for a reordering of the caravan. Masci will stay on point, but Gerard is moved to the rear.

Back on the road, everything falls into its usual routine. It's all normal. Not counting the glares, but who does? By late afternoon, the usual campsite appears and the caravan pulls in. There's wood, a firecircle, two cranky merchants, an aromatic latrine. You could have sworn you were here only two nights ago.

Yuri wanders up near the front of the caravan as they pull out. "Hey, Masci. 'Child of fornicating wolves'? Where in Hells did you hear that one?"

Masci grins wolfishly. "Oh, not in Hell. Just the grapevine. Gerard's family is a little ... odd. They breed wolfhounds for a hobby. Or so they say. But they never sell the wolfhounds, and they never drown the puppies, and yet ... there's always ... Ah well."

Yuri says, "What? There's always what?"

Masci shrugs. "You know, puppies. You'd think she spawned a new litter every half year, but ... wouldn't that kill the bitch?"

Yuri says, "I don't know, I'm a weaver, not a breeder. Would it?"

Yuri says, "Are they always the same puppies or new ones?"

Masci pulls his horse around. "Sure. Master Pjurin says the best bitches shouldn't be bred more than once a year. Give them time to rest. But I've heard tales ..." He leans over, to whisper into Yuri's ear, "I've heard that Gerard's mother was out of town when he was born. And he was suckled by a bitch."

Yuri murmurs, "She was out of town, but he was born in town? Something about that doesn't follow."

Masci grins, one eyebrow raised. "Exactly."

Camp, that evening, is made more meticulously than ever before. The wagons are carefully circled so that Gerard can't see Masci, and vice versa. And the supper is strained. But other than that, it's a perfectly normal evening.

Starguard slips over to Gerard. "So, why do you keep prodding Masci?" he opens.

Gerard shrugs. "Didn't you hear what he called me? That dog! Just because he likes the village ... healer."

Starguard says, "I heard. I heard you prodding him pretty hard first. I'm not exactly surprised he went for your verbal throat, so to speak."

Gerard shrugs. "Oh well. His loss. His family will pay soon enough."

Starguard says, "His family? You want to expand on that a little?"

Yuri pulls Stormy and Karlsefnir to the side for a long and mostly whispered discussion. Just in case anyone else speaks A-Isian. There's a lot of handwaving, though, as the three try to communicate clearly. Karlsefnir turns to look at Andreth at one point in the discussion, looking him over very carefully and then shaking his head. But finally Karlsefnir nods. Stormy translates karlsefnir's final statement very carefully. "We will ... travel ... with you. She ... may be a ... a person who ... changes. She ... brings disaster to ... the world. Or perhaps the world ... gives it to ... her. The ... passages ... are unclear."

Gerard bites his lip. "No, Starguard. I don't think I will. Sorry."

Yuri asks, "The passages of History? The passages of Jurdah? They are unclear?"

Stormy turns back, listens carefully, and then sighs. "Just ... the passages."

Starguard nods. "Be careful, friend. I wouldn't want you to do something you would regret in the future."

Ash contemplates quietly. Plenty of puzzle pieces, but few of the right ones.

Gerard nods. "I won't.

Yuri nods. "What of our children? People in these towns say that children are missing. Are they part of the danger to us?"

Stormy turns back and more conversation ensues. Finally Stormy shrugs. "He doesn't know. The doom is not clearly specified."

Starguard says, "Try to be the bigger man, Gerard? Masci's is a little too easy to rile, and I don't want the trouble. Have pity on an old man."

Yuri nods again. "You risk much on behalf of our people. We are indebted to you."

Yuri finishes with a bow and goes to begin his watch.

Gerard nods at Starguard. "Sure. I can wait for him to catch up."

The evening passed much the same as always. Occasional trips to the latrine, good food over the fire, and then a settling down into slumber. On Andreth's watch, he hears an unexpected sound. Gerard has rolled out of his bedroll, and is quietly creeping out of camp.

After tapping Jermiah on the arm, and pointing after Gerard's disappearing form, Andreth quietly creeps after the disappearing form. Gerard walks for about ten minutes, crossing the road and sliding into a small copse beyond.

As Andreth moves in closer, Gerard seems to pause. And then he takes a few more steps. Andreth hunches behind a bush, his eyes peering into the darkness.

Then Andreth hears a small whine, and large creatures seem to be swarming Gerard, where he stands beside a tree.

Gerard crouches down. Possibly, he's hugging one of the creatures. Andreth hears a little more whining.

Andreth just waits and watches, though he does take a quick glance behind himself to verify his departure route.

Some time passes, with the creatures all collapsing into one large pile. Finally, Gerard stands up, and separates from the group. He walks, silently, back out of the copse, and tiptoes back to the camp.

Finally, Gerard crawls back into his bedroll, and begins to snore softly. Not entirely credibly, but softly ....

Andreth returns to his post, nodding to Jermiah. "Stay alert," he hisses. "I don't rightly know what his business was, but I'm worried..."

The rest of the night passes at full alert, and yet incredibly peacefully.
