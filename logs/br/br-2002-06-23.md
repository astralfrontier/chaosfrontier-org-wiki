Game Log: Chapter 28 - Dark Skies Ahead


-------------------------------------------

When last we left the intrepid White Company, it was a drizzly day, and the party was abandoning Launceston to its own amusements. Pat, desolated by the lack of a fair, was nonetheless ecstatic with the piece of ribbon Masci had given him.

The caravan quickly got back on the road, Masci in the front, and Gerard still eating the dust of all other carts. The drizzle, which lasted for most of the day, kept the roads muddy so that the party only reached the planned for campsite in early evening. After some frantic scurrying to get the horses watered and fed, and supper cooked, the party rolled into bedrolls and tried to get some sleep.

Before bedtime, Yuri takes a moment to talk to Stormy. "Hey, Stormy, I wanted to know... did Ferg ever take you this far west? Are we going through any towns you recognize?"

Stormy shakes his head. "We never went past Perfirin. We went north, but not west ..."

Yuri says, "How far north? Into Calais?"

Stormy nods. "He knew a way up the escarpment ..."

Yuri hmms.

Yuri says, "If we ever go that way, we'll talk more about it. Anywhere he's been, we'll need to watch our step."

Stormy nods slowly. "I'll try ... to remember to warn you.

After a nasty, wet night keeping watch, the camp is quickly broken down and the caravan makes top speed for Thorpenhow. Given the encroaching mud, this isn't a very high speed at all. The road is empty, with only the caravan slogging along. And today the extra horses are worth every pound of hay they've consumed, to keep the wagons going.

By late afternoon, when Thorpenhow becomes visible in the distance, tempers are frayed and Gerard is beginning to lag more and more. Kept company by the Andvarri.

_Thorpenhow lies atop a hill that rises above the surrounding countryside. Low walls mark the edge of the town, as does a moat surrounding most of it. Rising from the center is a single tall tower, from whence you are probably being watched. Once, Thorpenhow was a major fortress. Now, with many of the walls crumbling, it has fallen back into being a small town, albeit one with an excellent water supply._

Yuri hmms.

Yuri says, "Everyone seems pretty beat. We could spend two days here and catch up on sleep in slightly more comfortable surroundings."

Tilara is relieved when the watchtower finally comes into sight. _Miserable day. And letting the caravan spread out isn't such a good idea either._ "Wait for the weather to break, at least. No good trying to push carts through this muck."

Ash grunts a little. "Sounds fine. Let everyone catch up," he agrees, with a brief backward glance to the stragglers.

Andreth looks up at the watchtower. "Bet you could see a lot of hawks from up there."

Slowly the stragglers catch up. Gerard's horses are definitely tired.

Yuri says, "That's part of it", contemplating the mud on his trousers. "The other part is that I'm personally feeling strung-out and I imagine I'm not the only one."

Stormy nods, from where he stands beside the company cart. "Our poor mule is exhausted."

Tilara nods. "So they say, Andreth. It's still in use, even if the fortifications aren't. Lets them watch the roads for miles around."

Ash chuckles. "Better strung out than strung up, right? So let's enjoy ourselves, at least for a bit. And yes, we'll ask around," he adds, looking skyward and around.

Yuri says, "OK. I'll go break the news."

Yuri wanders back to tell each of the merchants and Andvari in turn that we'll be taking a slight delay in Thorpenhow.

Tormel, huddled on the cart, sighs, and then climbs off. "It's going to be a long haul up before we can start counting our warmth ... Stormy, perhaps you can help me push?"

Starguard says, "Mmm. Thorpenhow. It means 'Hill-hill-hill."

Yuri blinks at Starguard. "How... thorough."

After talking to the other cart drivers, Yuri runs ahead to hire some fresh horses to drag the caravan through the last bit of hill.

At the walls, a guard stands waiting, five strong horses in hand. "The major sends these, sir. He hopes you can join him later tonight, after you've settled in the serai."

Yuri stops short. "The... Major? Uhhh... thanks. How did he know? Do we know him?"

Tilara says, "Languages change over time. After a while, I guess the locals start calling it 'hill' in the new tongue, and keep the old name as a designator. Twice, apparently, here. Am I right, Starguard?"

The guard shakes his head. "Tomjon saw you struggling at the road. And of course he sent a message to the major. And the major sent me with these horses."

Yuri says, "Very kind of the Major... we'll have to pay our respects..."

Yuri says, "Forgive me for not trying to be glib, but if I don't get back with these in a hurry, I may face a mutiny!"

Starguard nods to Tilara. "I would think so..."

The guard grins. "Our major's a right smart lady. She'll see right by you. Now, take good care of these; I'll pick them up at the serai tonight."

Yuri returns with the horses and with no large ceremony brings one to each cart. "They saw us coming and sent these. Remind me to tip everyone heavily."

Yuri says, "Oh, Tilara, you'll like this. They were sent by 'the Major'. Major who, I'm not sure exactly, but I'd guess they have a garrison here or something. And the Major is apparently a woman."

Tilara says, "I was going to say, that didn't take long at all. Nice place, I remember that from the last time through, but... she _sent_ them?"

Stormy nods, and carefully hooks in the horses.

Tilara explains. "They still take their history seriously, here. Major is what they call the town leader, rather than mayor... hmmm... I wonder if that's where the word came from in the first place? She's well-respected and has held the job for a while."

Yuri says, "Oh... so it's not like the military has a special interest in us... well, that's OK, then, I was worried for a moment. Still... I think Ash would like this kind of city. Old responsibilities seem important to him."

Ash smiles silently.

After a long painful slog up the hill, the caravan reaches the serai. After a brief negotiation with the caravanmaster, the horses are led into the barns, and the carts are sheltered.

The guard returns, following the caravan master. "The major says the main inn, The Old Knight and the Older Dragon, has several free rooms and invites you to make use of them. And she asks that the principals join her for a late supper at eight."

Andreth smiles quietly. _They sure are courteous to travelers..._

Starguard says, "Hmm. Wonder if he does this for all the caravans..."

Ash hmms softly. \`the principals' does not sound like guards. "Enjoy dinner," he says lightly. "Me and the rest of the boys will have ourselves some fun."

Mirra looks at Tilara, and miaows pitifully. _Inside? No._

Andreth speaks up. "I'll go with ya, Ash. Fancy dinners ain't my thing."

Yuri nods to Ash. "That's your choice... and I'd be grateful if you'd keep any eye on things if you're not going to dinner."

Starguard says, "Hmm. How many do you think is wise, Yuri? Yourself, one of the drivers perhaps?"

Tilara says, "Stormy? You want to come along?" She murmurs more quietly to Yuri, "And what about our Andvarri friends?"

Stormy nods. "I'd love to, I think. Although ... I don't have anything to wear."

Yuri \[to Starguard\]: "I think just the Company."

Tilara pauses. "Hmm. A point. I was thinking of the Company as the principals. What would be good, Yuri? How many is reasonable?"

Tormel stumps up, wrapped in his cloak. "Shall we be staying in the dry inn, or should we plan on suffering the torments of sleeping in the rain?"

Yuri \[to Starguard\]: "Minus Andreth and Ash, that's four of us... which should be OK."

Yuri says, "Does anyone not want to go meet the Major?"

Starguard says, "I'll go, Yuri. A little age and religion tends to keep things polite."

Stormy looks longingly at Tilara. "Will we sleep inside tonight?"

Tilara says, "And if that doesn't work, I can juggle the dinner rolls." She glances to Yuri. "Sleep in a bed for once?"

Yuri says, "Yes, let's."

Meanwhile, the guard clicks his heels together, bows, and excuses himself to go check on the horses. He disappears into the barn, followed by the Andvarri.

The two barns holding the horses are plain, simple, and easily secured. The wagons stand in a row beside the second barn. Yuri examines the setup carefully. It's not terribly secure, although the entire serai is surrounded by a wall and scuttlebutt suggests this is one of the safer serais to camp.

Yuri asks Karlsefnir if he should mention 'the peril' to the Major.

The four merchants are carefully securing the tarpaulins on their carts. Masci is even joking about the Old Dragon.

Karlsefnir shrugs. Then, in his broken A-isian, he tries to explain. "We come ... to warn. But the major ... may ask ... what we cannot ... ummm ... offer answers for?"

Yuri nods. "Then we'll save it for the ones you seek. We should reach Citadel in 10 days or less."

Karlsefnir nods. "We watch ... the horses. They have ... good barns."

Ash draws aside Harry and Perf and speaks to them in low tones for a few moments, apparently interested in their agreement on some point.

Harry nods at Ash. "We'll stay with the carts, and Perf can escort the principals. That way you can send him over as a runner."

Ash says, "Good thinking. Alright, hopefully we'll all get to relax and do some serious drinking soon."

Tilara drags Stormy away, to find him some clothes that are more suitable for a meal with the major, while Yuri arranges for rooms in the Old Knight. Rooms are available, and have in fact been reserved by the Major on their behalf. After everyone washes up, changing into nicer clothes, the four of them set out for the Major's residence, led by Tilara who remembers the way.

Yuri says, "Gee, Tilara... you'd think we were VIP's or something. They send out some horses, reserve rooms for us at the Inn... I mean, every town wants us to spend our money there, but generally they wait to find out if we have any first."

The major's house, or residence, perhaps, sits on the outskirts of town. It's a large stately house, the walls made of a curious light brown stone that isn't found locally. Two guards, at the gate, stop the group for a moment. After identifying themselves, the party is escorted to the front door, where a butler meets them.

Tilara chuckles. "Aye. I have no idea what the fuss is, myself, unless word of our mission has preceded us. Maybe it's just because we're an early caravan and they want the news."

Starguard says, "When things don't seem to make sense, wait for the other shoe to drop, Yuri. And that's what we're here for."

The butler, dressed in an outfit that seems almost military, bows. "The lady major is in the sitting room. If you will follow me?"

Yuri, who above all else can at least handle pomp and circumstance, bows back. "Thank you, sir. Please show us the way."

Starguard nods curtly, the military aspect bringing forth instincts that are not deeply buried...

The butler merely nods, one hand raised to summon a footman. "Wilkes will take your coats." The footman, dressed similarly steps forward, and quickly collects cloaks before disappearing again. The butler leads the party onwards, to the sitting room. Opening both doors, he intones "Your company, m'lady." and then steps aside to allow the party to pass.

Inside, a single lady is sitting by the fire, working on a piece of embroidery. She looks up, and then stands. "Welcome."

Tilara follows along, keeping one eye on Stormy and happy that she wore her cleanest plain outfit rather than her performer's regalia for this dinner.

The lady is dressed in a plain short-sleeved gown, caught up high under the waist in the new Empire style. Long gloves cover her arms. A closer look shows the true cost of the garb, for those who can discern it. Exquisite tailoring, and edgings made of remarkable lace.

Starguard bows stiffly. "Good evening, Major."

Yuri bows as between officers. "Milady Major, the White Company is at your service."

Tilara tries for a military posture, and copies Starguard's bow, trying to catch Stormy's eye and get him to do the same.

The lady smiles, the lips twitching when Stormy slowly and carefully mimics Tilara's movements. "Greetings, gentlemen, lady. We are glad that you have joined us in Thorpenhow. A pleasant change from this unpleasant weather."

Yuri straightens. "It has been a long and interesting road. The rain and mud are inconvenient, but passive in nature."

The lady nods. "Indeed. Now ... let me see. The guard tells me you made good use of the horses I sent ... Master Yuri, I believe?"

Yuri's mouth twitches slightly. _Titles don't suit me, do they?_ "The aid was much appreciated. Our crew and our charges were nearly exhausted."

Starguard raises an eyebrow slightly. Excellent information sources.

The lady nods. "Indeed. But until the empire can afford better roads, Tomjon always warns me when a caravan is desperate enough to travel in this weather." She smiles, politely, still watching the entire company. Behind you, you hear the click of the doors closing.

Starguard smiles. "To be the first caravan, one can't afford to dawdle too long, sir."

Tilara smiles, joining the conversation. "Not so much desperation as eagerness. But we didn't expect the weather to stay like this."

Yuri nods, and smiles. "The merchants we are escorting are not desperate, they seek an opportunity at an early market."

A single chuckle. "The weather, once it turns, tends to linger. The crops enjoy it, but the merchants find it ... heavier going. Would you care for a light drink? Stiles informs me that supper will be served in perhaps half an hour."

Starguard smiles. "A little mulled wine would be gratefully accepted, thank you."

Tilara murmurs, "You are too kind, ma'am. Thank you."

Yuri politely declines. "I may have a watch later. Thank you all the same."

Yuri looks over at Stormy. _Kid can make up his own mind._

Stormy erms, and uhs, and finally stutters something about mulled wine being quite delicious.

The lady nods, once, at someone behind the party. One door reopens briefly, and you hear receding footsteps. A few minutes later the butler reappears with a tray containing five goblets of mulled wine. After serving the company, the last goblet is offered to the lady, and she sips slowly.

After a few more desultory remarks, the butler announces that dinner is served. The lady, on Yuri's arm, leads the party to a large well appointed dining room, where a sumptuous four course dinner is served. Conversation remains general, and the lady's interests seem to lie primarily in the ranks of politics. And geography. And trade, naturally. The thrust of her questions frequently hints at the military powers available in the countryside, but she never asks direct questions.

After the final, sweet, course is served and enjoyed, the lady looks down the table. "Shall we return to the sitting room? We have, I believe, been fencing long enough."

Starguard smiles ruefully. "It's not really the military style to fence, is it."

Yuri chuckles. "Certainly. But I think you over-estimate our importance."

Meanwhile, back in the serai, the weather continues to dribble. Ash and Andreth, standing in what little shelter there is, wait for the skies to lighten. And for the other shoe to drop.

Tilara chuckles. "Is that what it was? I thought we were just avoiding discussing serious business over food."

Ash says, ".... and then he does this foot sweep thing. What's the best way to avoid that?"

The lady stands, again leading the party to the same living room, where more mulled wine awaits them. Once there, she smiles at the Brother and Tilara. "Indeed. Good food should not be sullied with poor news. And you do not seem inclined to share good. But I commend you on your patience; not once have you wondered why I have asked you to join me."

Harry comes jogging up in the rain. "Dickon's gone and picked another fight, sir. With the caravan master's son. We conked em both on the head, so they're unconscious, but I'm not exactly sure what to do next."

Starguard chuckles. "Oh, I've wondered, Major. I just recognized that you would get to it on your own time."

Yuri frowns slightly. "If you didn't mention a reason... we'd know the reason already."

Tilara sighs. "And, unfortunately, there is little enough good news."

Ash sighs. "He's your guy, I trust your judgment. If you really want a suggestion, though, just dunk Dickon in the horse-trough until he comes to, then put him on wagon duty."

Harry nods, grinning. "Aye aye sir. With **pleasure**"

Andreth grunts. "Yuri 'n them'll have to sort this all out when they get back from dinner. No doubt there'll be trouble over this. Damnation..."

The lady inclines her head. "Indeed, I should indeed, perhaps, say that not once have you commented. Still, the time has come to speak of serious things." She sits down, slowly straightening her gown with her hands, taking longer than perhaps necessary. "You see, I have a small problem, that I am hoping you can solve." She plays with a ring on her finger.

"It isn't, necessarily, a large problem. But it worries me." She sighs, fiddling with her gown. "I must sound so silly. I assure you, normally ..." her voice trails off.

Tilara says, "Milady major, one thing I have never heard anyone here say about you is 'silly'. There are odd things afoot in the world right now, and the strangest things turn out to be important."

Yuri sighs, and sinks down into a chair, without slouching, and looks around for a servant. "I believe I'll have that drink now. I can see this is going to be complicated."

Andreth hrms. "Well, little else we can do 'bout it now. Just hope caravan master don't raise too much of a fuss right away." He stands up and stretches. "You was asking me somethin', Ash?"

The lady nods. "Please, do understand, I ... ah, please, won't you call me Lady San? Lady Major is so ... so formal." She fidgets a little more. "Well, let me ask you firstly, have you heard the rumors about great and unnatural animals?"

Tilara nods. "Aye, and seen them first hand, as well. Wolves and hawks, at least."

Starguard nods. "We've been attacked by wolves, and a boy up north had his arm crushed by a hawk."

Yuri leans forward slowly. "Well, now... if it's THAT kind of problem... tell us all about it."

Ash waves a hand at the monk. "Nah, not important. But you shoulda seen some of those moves. Those outlanders would be great in a bar fight."

Andreth laughs, settling down. "No kiddin'? I oughta spar with 'em sometime. Maybe we c'n teach each other a thing or two."

"It all began when Tomjon was on guard. We keep a watch at all times, of course. Honour dictates that. And that first time, when he told of the giant hawk, we weren't inclined to believe him. I'm afraid Tomjon is sometimes a little fond of the ... of the spirits, shall we say?" Lady San sighs, looking down. "But the second sighting was made by Sammy, and she's never drunk a drop in her life. She's a little ... strident on that point."

Yuri nods. "I can respect that. She saw the same thing?"

Karlsefnir, on his rounds, stops to watch the two youngsters, a smile on his lips.

Lady San nods, once. "Indeed. And so did half the town; the bird dropped a large container of burning pitch on the top of the tower. It was two days before we could again mount a proper watch."

Ash snorts. "Sure, I'd give gold to see that fight. I'm sort of curious, though. I don't see you with a weapon, but they fight normally, AND they have that practiced brawling style, similar to your own. Wonder why they'd need both.."

Karlsefnir leans up against the wall, making himself comfortable. The weather doesn't seem to bother him in the slightest.

Starguard blinks.

Andreth tilts his head, rubbing his stubbled chin. "Good question..."

Tilara blinks. "That's something we'd not heard of. There have been reports of them carrying off children, or trying to at least. But dropping pitch on a fortress? Very strange."

Yuri says, "They prevented you from mounting a watch for two days..."

Yuri says, "And I wonder what one would not want watched for two days."

Lady San nods. "Several times, since, the same has happened. Naturally we have taken precautions, but burning pitch is ... difficult to douse."

Andreth says, "Mebbe it's a tradition. No matter what the Way," he emphasizes the capital letter, "they're all big on tradition."

Starguard says, "So where do we fit into this problem, Lady San?"

Ash waves a beckoning hand at Karl.

Yuri nods. "So they've been direct, hostile, and undeniably intelligent... and that's all new."

Karlsefnir steps forward, grinning widely, and makes an excessively formal bow. The kind where arms flail, legs move, and one foot snakes out to sweep Ash.

Lady San bites her lips. "We're facing several problems. Naturally, we want to keep this quiet so that people don't panic, while at the same time alerting them. But that's my regiment, not yours. I've sent four messengers to Citadel, and four to Changer's Bane. None of them have arrived. Of the ones heading to Citadel, none have reached Githa. If nothing else, I would like to warn you."

Ash backs quickly up, his last encounter fresh in his mind, and flails a bit as one ankle is tapped. But he doesn't go down, not this time.

Karlsefnir straightens up, the same grin plastered all over his face. His hands are hanging loosely at his side, and he winks at Ash.

Yuri steeples his fingers. "That could be... a problem. If they won't let messengers through, then they surely won't want us to make it, either."

Ash jerks a thumb in Andreth's direction, smirking - _try my friend out,_ his silent challenge suggests.

Andreth's eyes widen in interest, and stands up, moving easily into a relaxed defensive posture.

Tilara says, "That is ... disquieting, isn't it? But we're better protected than a lone messenger, and they may not be thick enough on the ground to stop a slower but more powerful group. Forewarned is forearmed, and we would gladly carry your messages with us, Major."

Yuri says, "They're up to something, and it's organized. I fear this may have progressed further than we suspected."

Starguard nods. "We're committed to that direction anyway, so there's no reason not to carry the message."

Yuri says, "Lady San, if you give us a copy of your message, we'll get it to Citadel. We have a... compulsion... to go there. Although it seems that the object of our mission may come to us sooner than we can seek it."

Lady San nods. "I have a package of five messages prepared. One each for the mayors of Githa, Cairntor, Cairnstoke, and Cariston. And the last for the emperor himself. The seal will bring you to him, directly. But I must admit to personal concern; the last messenger was my son."

Karlsefnir steps out into the drizzle, two fingers waving Andreth forward. Behind him, the other Andvarri have come to watch too.

Tilara leans over and whispers to Yuri. "Shall we ask about Samaela?"

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "It was her son. I think it's personal enough that she should know some of those details."

Starguard bows his head. "I'm...sorry, Lady San."

Yuri leans back. "If the rest of the Company present agrees, I think we can tell you what we know, and some of what we suspect."

Lady San nods at Starguard. "So am I. But I am reliably informed he took at least one hawk with him. We sent out a detail, after seeing a far off explosion, and they recovered one badly burnt corpse."

Tilara nods to Yuri and turns to Starguard and Stormy. "Objections?"

Starguard nods, agreeing.

Stormy nods.

Andreth advances cautiously, for a few steps... then tries a simple feinting blow, just to test Karl's defenses.

Karlsefnir bends out of the way, still grinning.

Tilara clears her throat. "The caravan is a cover for the Company. Our current mission is to seek out information on one 'Samaela' whose name has appeared on the fourth Spire in Citadel. We've already learned that there have been dire portents among the Andvarri, as well, and they are worried, too."

Yuri settles in and tells the whole story, starting with an abbreviated description of rooting out Ferg's gang, going on to Andreth being mauled by wolves, the Quest for the meaning of Samaela, and the reports giant animal attacks along the way; meeting the Andvarri, and how Samaela is a dangerous name for them.

Andreth smiles and nods his head in acknowledgment, in the same motion lashing out with a body blow from the left.

Karlsefnir leans right, although not quite far enough. Andreth's hand hits him in the side of the ribs, and his hand comes up, trying to trap Andreth's.

Lady San looks confused at the mention of the Andvarri, although Yuri's story explains much. "So there are greater forces at work." She takes a sip from her goblet. "In these past few weeks we've felt quite ... isolated. There hasn't been a caravan from Citadel in several weeks now."

Tilara nods. "The last one we passed heading west was ... how long ago, now? We wondered why the roads were so empty."

Yuri says, "It seems clear to us that the Andvarri have foreseen the threat, and although it is still nebulous to them, they know Samaela is behind it. It also seems clear that the giant animal attacks are probably the Changers. Now if we can just get some indication that these are indeed the same threat, we can take action to prevent it. I think after tonight we're going to be assuming that that is the case... that the fourth spire, as we suspected, chronicles the Changers, and that they are a force to be reckoned with."

Andreth lets Karl catch his hand, but pulls back against his grip and uses it as leverage for his right leg that's heading at speed toward Karl's hip.

Yuri says, "Wait... what about the one that Berina was on?"

Karl grins, his second hand coming into play as he pivots, sweeping Andreth over his hip.

"Berina?" The Lady San looks confused.

Yuri says, "Caravan traffic is light this time of year... we know of at least one large caravan, that brought... someone we know... to Woolwich from Citadel a few weeks ago."

"Ah. I see. Well, we had the first spring caravan ... almost two months now. They always start early enough that it's still spring when they arrive at the end of the road." The Lady San smiles. "So we see them in late winter.

Yuri says, "And we've neither seen nor passed any going the other way, save the one in Perfirin that was occupying their Serai the same night as we were."

Yuri says, "But I do not recall which direction they were traveling."

Tilara says, "I'm pretty sure it was outbound. A week ago for us, and therefore at least two weeks if they came through here."

Starguard says, "Some sort of blockage...but we've dealt with a lot so far. We'll prevail."

Yuri hmms. "When we were fighting Ferg, I recalled an old story that I thought was important at the time. There were tunnels under the farm, reminiscent of some bandits who once harassed caravan traffic in the area by popping up all over and disappearing just as quickly... and it was thought they might use tunnels to do it."

Yuri says, "No town is dependent on caravans, really; they all grow their own food. But luxury items, messages... supplies for the Military... they all travel on caravans..."

Lady San frowns, lost in thought, and then rings a bell to summon the butler. "Stiles; please get me the diary of the fourth major."

Andreth's left leg flies out from under him, but not before his right connects, hard, sending Karl sprawling the other direction. His left elbow flies up, to prevent his arm being wrenched.

Ash hoots and calls and cheers. "You teach em, Andreth!"

Karl oofs, landing in the mud. After a moment or two he bounces back up, while behind him Thord claps. Again, he motions Andreth forward with two fingers, and again he waits.

Yuri says, "It would be potentially disastrous for Wind's Hammer, which I hear their commander is now calling Changer's Bane, anyway. It takes a lot of mobility to disrupt caravan traffic. Those old bandits did it with their tunnels; perhaps the Changers take advantage of their animal mobility to do the same."

Lady San nods, absentmindedly. "Tunnels, you say ... "

Yuri finishes his drink. "I don't like how this is adding up. Whoever they are, they want to soften us up. They wouldn't do that if they're not going to try and get something from us."

Yuri says, "Innocent people are going to die."

Andreth rolls quickly to fighting stance again, more wary this time. He circles around Karl, but doesn't launch another attack right away, choosing instead to test his patience for a time.

Tilara says, "They always do when the powerful start fighting."

Starguard nods, noting Lady San's distraction. "Do you know something that could help us?"

The butler returns, carrying a very old manuscript with wooden covers. Lady San moves to a small desk, and seats herself, opening the manuscript. "The majors keep diaries. Part log, part records, part speculations, and part common gossip and complaint. The fourth major, who served on the plains, mentions tunnels. I recall reading about it once, but none of the farms around here have tunnels. Or if they do, they haven't been found."

Karl waits patiently, while Thord and Arnlaug move to the side. Then, after looking around one last time, he takes two steps forward, and pivots rapidly on one foot, the other swinging around in a roundhouse kick.

Yuri says, "The tunnels were for Ferg. The Changers wouldn't need them. It would be convenient if Ferg had the same master; otherwise this way may be on two fronts."

Tilara says, "If they're all Changers, no... if it's a mixed group, then maybe they'd use the old tunnels, as well."

Lady San pages slowly through the manuscript. "Here we are. The major mentions only in passing that the empire's tunnels are collapsing. He laments the lack of manpower and funds required to keep them operating."

Yuri says, "You haven't seen any changes in the local brigand activity lately, have you? Either unusually high or low?"

Starguard sits back, listening...

Yuri hmms. "So they were the Empire's tunnels... they must be very old. Perhaps so old that few who live, remember their existence."

Yuri says, "And yet, our leaders are unaging... which is still hard to believe."

Lady San closes the manuscript again. "The tunnels have not been mentioned since the seventh major. And let me reassure you; the majors most certainly age, and eventually retire and die. In this case, though, I wish they were immortal. They leave only cryptic notes."

Yuri says, "The Majors aren't, but the Princes are."

Starguard says, "Perhaps they have fallen in, though. It is, however, a possibility. I don't think finding them will be a problem, though. They'll find us."

Lady San chuckles. "But a simple major like me does not speak to Princes. They have far better ways to spend their time. Wines to sample, clothes to design, dances to learn ..."

Yuri frowns. "Oh, it's THAT way, is it? I think I was always afraid it would be."

Andreth dives and rolls to the side as the kick passes over him, and leaps forward toward Karl as the Andvarri is still pivoting.

Tilara sighs. "Mayhaps a crisis will wake them up to their responsibilities."

The Andvarri finishes his pivot, and kicks out again, at head height, hoping to catch the leaping Andreth.

Tilara shakes her head. "If we can inform them of it. Else they won't even know there's a problem until the fall caravans fail to arrive. The timing here is ... suggestive."

Starguard nods. "What payment do you offer for delivering your messages?"

Yuri shakes his head. "It's going to be up to us, Tilara. I don't know how I know that, but I do. I think it's part of the deal we made... for Andreth."

Tilara nods. "Aye, that might be the way of it." She grins. "At least we'll know what's going on as things crash around us. I always felt sorry for the folks in the old stories who got killed in battles they didn't understand."

Andreth's head dodges quickly to the side, and he grunts with pain as the foot catches him on the left shoulder instead. Rolling with the blow, he catches Karl's leg in both arms and tries to throw him over his right shoulder.

Lady San bites her lip. "Gratitude, naturally, and what fame is contained in our diaries. As for funds ... We will gladly host your merchants and wagons here while you investigate. And naturally, your stay at the inn will be free. Beyond that, I can offer you this ring. My son made it for me." She pulls a plain golden band off her hand. "If he had carried it, he might have been alive today."

Ash rocks back and forth on his heels, waiting on the sidelines and watching with evident amusement.

Yuri says, "Your son was a smith?"

Starguard shakes his head at first, not wanting to take such a family ring...then pauses. "Is there something special about that ring, Lady?"

Karl laughs out loud, letting Andreth pull him up and over. And as he goes, he grabs both of Andreth's ears firmly in his hands.

Lady San shakes her head. "My son was a talented sorcerer.

Andreth roars and leaps forward after the falling Karl - as he tumbles, he grabs at the man's wrists and squeezes hard.

Karl holds on to Andreth's ears, as both crash to the ground.

Starguard nods, listening. "But we couldn't take a family possession, milady. It's not right."

Tilara says, "A sorcerer?" She glances at Stormy, and back to Lady San. "And quite powerful, if he could craft rings, I would think."

Lady San shakes her head. "I don't know quite what else to offer. Until the caravans come through the town is ... not rich. And as major, recruitment is strictly my responsibility."

And then Lady San turns towards Tilara. "Quite powerful. He could call lightning from the sky, and turn earth into a gaping hole. He was convinced that - traveling alone - he would make it safely to Citadel. He left the ring for me."

Starguard looks over at Tilara and Yuri, checking their eyes. The hospitality of the town is enough for him.

Yuri sighs. "Do we, the White Company, agree, contingent on agreement of our absent fellows, that we shall take this responsibility in return for the free support of our operations?"

Andreth growls, still gripping one wrist firmly, and reaches back with the other hand for one of Karl's own ears.

Karl grins, releasing both ears, and rolling out of the way, dislocating his own shoulder in the process.

Tilara says, "Aye. We need to go on to Citadel anyway, and I wouldn't have requested anything in payment for taking the messages. This is important for all the Empire, not a matter for profit."

A single tear travels down Lady San's cheek, completely ignored.

Andreth rolls up again to a crouch, panting, and rubbing at his ears. Glancing at the way Karl carries his arm, he looks up to him and raises a questioning eyebrow. _Enough?_

Starguard nods. "I agree. That she was willing to give up such an important thing shows the importance of this quest."

"I am ... pleased, that you will do so. Nonetheless, this is a mighty obstacle. If you have a sorceress in your party, perhaps they will join me tomorrow in his workroom, to see what we might share." Lady San smiles, slowly.

Karl nods his head, his arm popping back into its joint. Again he bows, with only a few fewer flourishes. Naturally, again the foot snakes out.

Tilara says, "Lady San... I would hate to take your son's ring when we might not survive to return it. What power does it have? I would also not wish to turn it down if it would aid my protege or myself to live through this journey... and yes, we are. We would be honored."

Lady San twists the ring. "My son told me the ring could make the wearer invisible. At will, simply by saying the key phrase. He didn't test it before he left, however."

Starguard says, "What is the key phrase, Lady San?"

Starguard says, "Though perhaps you better tell us while not wearing the ring."

Tilara thinks, _He should've taken it, then. He would've needed to disappear much more urgently than his mother, here in the town._ She chuckles at Starguard's comment. "What better way to see if it works?"

Lady San pulls a drawer open in her desk, and pulls out a small book. She leafs through it, a wistful smile on her face, then finally finds the right page. Pulling forward a piece of paper she writes two words on it, and gives the paper to Starguard.

Yuri says, "Perhaps we should adjourn for tonight, and perhaps return tomorrow. Our current plans call for us to stay here two days. We can take advantage of the extra day to scout the road ahead. I can manage quite a bit of invisibility through only mundane means."

Lady San nods, summoning the butler again. "Stiles will have your cloaks ready. Thank you, again, for your generous offer."

Yuri stands and bows.

Andreth is too slow to dodge the foot, and goes sprawling, laughing at being caught by such a simple move.

Starguard nods, and smiles at Lady San. "I see. It is for you, I'm sure. The ring is not meant for us."

Tilara stands and curtsies, Mirra nodding politely from her shoulder. "Tomorrow, then."

Lady San stands, watching the party leave. Stormy bows again, awkwardly. He's been very quiet all evening.

Starguard stands, and bows. "Be well."

Andreth crawls up to his feet, nodding to Ash. "You were asking about that? Well, there really ain't no counter for that move if your attacker does it just right. Which he did."

Ash nods. "So hmm. The counter is basically to beat him bloody before he does it right, I guess," he muses.

Karl grins, and steps to the side, where Thord offers him a bottle. He waves it at Ash and Andreth, obviously offering to share.

Andreth says to Ash, "Well, not quite," brushing the mud off his trousers. "No one does it perfect every time, 'n if he makes a mistake you c'n take advantage of it." He grins at Karl, gratefully accepting the offer.

Ash says, "Karl.. for what reason did you learn to fight that way?"

Karl looks blankly at Ash, and smiles.

Ash shrugs helplessly. "Wish Stormy was around."

Andreth nods. "They'll be back soon enough. Whoo, this's strong stuff..."

Ash laughs softly. "I'll pass then. I'm still on the job."

After accepting their cloaks, the party returns to the serai, where Ash and Andreth have been keeping watch. Andreth, in particular, has been watching the mud very very closely.

Although, for the record, so has Karlsefnir.

Ash snags Stormy immediately and hauls him over. "I need you to translate.... what the hell is so special about the mud, guys?"

Stormy oofs, following Ash. "You need me?"

Ash nods distractedly. "Yeah, ask Karl here why his people found the need to learn to fight without weapons."

Tilara chuckles at Andreth. "Well, he looks like he's been rolling in it."

Yuri says, "Yikes, was there trouble while we were gone? It looks like there was a brawl in here."

Andreth laughs, shaking his head. "Karl's been showing me a few of his tricks. He's damn good, too."

Yuri says, "Oh, by the way... we've got free rooms at the inn for the next day or so. We'll fill you in on all the details in a moment, but if anyone had any doubts, we're already booked at the Old Knight."

Stormy nods, turning to Karlsefnir. After he poses the question, all three Andvarri hoot with laughter. Then they turn to Ash, while Karl speaks. Stormy translates carefully. "In bar fights ... only a ... a man with no ... no bravery ... uses a weapon. A man with no bravery ... does not last long in the ... the ... the labyrinth?"

Ash shakes his head. "Not good enough. There's some skill behind that. But I'm not gonna press it."

Yuri nods. "That makes sense. You don't always want to or need to kill..." Yuri trails off. "Excuse me. I'm just going to check the walls again."

Stormy tugs on Ash's arm. "I'm not explaining well. It's ... it's a matter of honour ... to fight well without weapons."

Ash nods slowly. "I see. Well, I guess that makes a sort of sense."

After a little more discussion, the group moves to the inn, where the merchants have long since made themselves comfortable. Gerard has managed not to pick a fight with Masci, and the others are singing songs in the corner of the bar.

Harry's men have been appointed to watch the wagons in shift, especially Dickon. Now that he's conscious again.

Yuri says, "Hey... Ash... got time for a drink? I wanted to ask you about some things."

Ash hrms? "Sure, lead on."

Yuri picks up a small ale for himself, and one of whatever Ash selects. "Y'know... we heard something tonight that worries me... and I think you'll be interested."

At the inn, the innkeeper is personally greeting the party, and explaining which of the rooms have been set aside for them. While Yuri and Ash slide away, the others are brought to luxurious rooms, each with its own bed, basin, and window. With locks on both doors and windows.

Yuri says, "Apparently, the Majors of this town are a tradition to back when it was a military garrison. Since then, they maintain the form and tradition, but the military aspect is diminished. However... the Emperor and the Princes... they're ageless, right? So they should remember the old times, when things like this were new. But it seems they don't. Perhaps they think that they focus on what is important, but I think that it's more likely that history is passing them by."

Stormy bounces on his bed. "Look, Tilara! It bounces! And it's so soft, and the duvet ... wow."

Tilara chuckles. "Don't get too used to it, Stormy... we're back on the trail in a couple days. But it is nice."

Starguard smiles, looking around his room. Better than he's had in many a day. Perhaps a long, hot soak for his old, tired bones is in order.

Ash nods slowly, listening and letting his unsophisticated mind expand itself painfully, by degrees, into the larger scope of this idea.

Yuri says, "It's the people like this" - he gestures at the townsfolk around the common room - "that make history, minute by minute. It seems that there were once tunnels all over the Empire, built to the order of the Emperor, or at least a Prince, but they fell into disrepair generations ago. The Great Ones should remember, and keep them in order - or hell, at least tell the local leaders about things like that. But they don't."

Yuri says, "Those tunnels were made minute-to-minute, like the people in this room. Even if some history is written in the broad strokes of generations... those who live on that scale, aren't always the most noble. They've let so much slip away. There's probably entire tribes that have come and gone within the Empire, underneath their notice."

Ash frowns. "So whoever discovers them, in working order, pretty much has an advantage against the local militia, caravans, and whatnot..? Do ALL these tunnels interconnect?" He's still thinking tactically, attack and defense and concealment, but the larger aspect of politics is worming its way into his mind.

Yuri shakes his head. "It's more complicated than that. It's all the old secrets, and how they've been forgotten, even by the people that should remember. I... remember, for some reason... that you're concerned with nobility and tradition. I look at this town and I see your answer, although not all of it at once. I guess the point is that we're going to be up against some long odds in the coming months, and the minute-to-minute history will be made by people like us, and the Andvari, and the Major. I feel a lot of lives are at risk and we're going to have to be the ones to save them. It won't be the Princes, even though history would make us think they should."

Stormy bounces in Starguard's room. "Isn't this wonderful? Let's go bathe again! They have a wonderful bath house here. And I want to get my new clothes washed so I can keep them clean!"

Ash frowns again, but nods in eventual agreement. "Alright then.. hey, you know, that makes me wonder something... how d'you suppose princes and emperors got to be that way, when there WERE no princes or emperors before \`em?"

Yuri says, "We have only our one lifetime. Those with many, have let so many old secrets slip away, that we'll have to rediscover ourselves to save lives. And we _will_. Ask yourself who has the greater claim to honor."

Yuri shrugs. "It's been written that generations ago, the Emperor put the Empire together more or less with his bare hands... but there were a lot fewer people back then, and it was easier to keep in personal touch with it all."

Yuri says, "So I think he got to be Emperor by working hard, and then staying on top... well... out of habit."

Starguard smiles at the young lad. "Aye, aye. Just a moment, head off and I'll catch up to you lad."

Stormy nods and runs for the bath house.

Ash grins. "Well hey. That's what we're doing. So even if he forgets this stuff, as long as we remember.... " A pause. "We'll be better off. Alright then." He brightens visibly.

Yuri says, "I really hope that our leaders rise to the occasion. Things like the Brothers of the Waters... they're there to keep the old knowledge from being lost, to keep the memories of the princedom. Perhaps the Princes themselves really best serve as a means of providing direction, these days."

Starguard smiles, and begins to get ready, offering a quick word up to the Stars to keep the lad safe in the days ahead.

Yuri grins. "I hadn't realized that. We're part of that remembering, now, aren't we?"

Tilara says, "Looks like it."

Relaxing in the hot tub, Stormy turns to Starguard. "I think I understand why we can't keep the ring. But why can't we borrow it?"

Starguard blinks, considering. "Hmm. We could at that...though returning it might be a difficult prospect. It's a good idea, though."

Ash nods. "See? So hey. You know, my dad was the one who would talk to other farmers in our area. Before that, his mother went out to them. You figure.. hm..." This thought is a convoluted one. "That's what we're supposed to do, in part. Go tell other people, the important people, what's going on. The major, and the guards, and the family we met.. we listen to them, and we MAKE the people above us take notice of the problem.."

Stormy nods again. "Do you think we'll take the merchants with us when we go exploring?"

Yuri says, "I think that's going to be an important part in Citadel. The Andvarri want to talk to 'Zamua'. I just hope 'Zamua' wants to listen, or we're going to have to try really hard to get his attention... her... their... you know what I mean."

Yuri says, "Anyway... we're here for two days. I'm hoping it dries out some tomorrow... but I was wondering if we could check out the road out of town tomorrow, and see what we can find."

Ash smirks faintly. "We'll find out what we can. And we'll pay attention, and we'll see that it matters to the people who gotta hear."

Tilara grins.

After some quiet thinking, the party retires for the night. The carts are being guarded, the merchants have retired, and the rain has yet to let up. Tomorrow is obviously going to be very interesting.
