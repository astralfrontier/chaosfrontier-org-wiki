Game Log: Chapter 29 - The Way to Githa


-------------------------------------------

After spending an interesting evening either fencing with Major Lady San or examining the mud in the Serai up close, the party retires to the inn for a good night's sleep. In the morning, they gather in the common room, where a generous breakfast is served.

Ash chows down - hearty fare is to be consumed rapidly, so other business can be seen to. However, even under the circumstances a bit more time can be spared to enjoy it.. not every day you're the guests of the town's leader.

Starguard mms, smiling. "It always tastes better when I don't have to do the dishes."

Yuri eats, looking thoughtful. "We should go check out the road ahead, before continuing. Without the carts or the merchants."

Yuri says, "From what the major said, our... brigands... are probably camped nearby."

Stormy nods at Yuri. "And we could explore the workroom." His eyes gleam, and Tormel turns to listen.

Tilara chuckles. "Tell me about it. Dishes are no fun at all." She looks serious at the suggestion of scouting. "Probably a good idea. First, though..." She nods at Stormy. "Exactly. The Major has offered us a chance to look it over from a professional's perspective. I think we should. You want to come along, Yuri?"

Finishing his breakfast at top speed, Stormy stands. "Shall we go explore the room now?" Tormel, still obviously listening too, stands up. "Perhaps I can be of assistance?"

Starguard frowns at Yuri. "Shouldn't we go in a group? The more people that can swing a sword the better in my view..."

Yuri says, "The more people that go sneaking around, the less sneaky we are."

Yuri glances over at Tilara. "This is more your department. Do you want to take Tormel?"

Tilara says, "Hardly sneaking if we were invited. Or did you mean the scouting...?" She thinks about taking Tormel along. "Do you know anything about sorcery, scholar?"

Starguard says, "One sorcerer didn't do very well, you'll note. I'd rather have my reinforcements close at hand."

Tormel shrugs. "The less I know now, the more I'll learn. But if the man has a gift for potions ... I may prove useful."

Yuri says, "In any case, yes, I'll be going with you now, Tilara. I'd like to talk to the Major again. It's not going to be safe for the caravan to press on until we clear this up and so there are arrangements that have to be made."

Stormy stands, fidgeting, hopping from foot to foot ...

Tilara nods. "Come along, then. The more eyes, the better. And I think we should all go along on the scouting mission. One person alone is risky, and I doubt we'll be able to get out of Thorpenhow without being spotted." She smiles at Stormy. "All right, we're going..."

Ash speaks up. "If you're hittin the road, I am too."

Yuri says, "We're going back to the Major's residence, Ash. We're not going brigand hunting yet."

Tilara says, "When we get back."

Starguard says, "Not quite yet, Ash. Visit the major first, and then the road."

Ash shrugs. "Just sayin. Let me know when. I might not be in the Inn when you decide to go, so come find me."

Gerard approaches Yuri. "We've heard you're planning a stopover? How long?

Tilara glances at Yuri. _Bad news travels fast..._

Yuri says, "The Major... the local leader... says there's brigand activity on the road ahead of here. We want to check it out before moving on."

Gerard nods. "Well, with our host's help, I'm sure we can organize a small Fair."

Yuri says, "That would be a good idea. Hopefully we'll have some answers by the time that's done."

The party splits once more, the merchants heading for the inn keeper and the caravan master to plan a fair, and Tilara leading a party back to the Lady San's house, while the remaining caravaners lounge around town.

Arriving at the mansion, the party is quickly admitted to the house, where the butler Stiles welcomes everyone. Taking cloaks, hats, and the like, he shows the group into the same sitting room, where Lady San is sitting, working at her desk. She stands up when the party enters, and bids everyone welcome.

Yuri bows back. "We've returned. I think you've met everyone except Tormel; he's a scholar and an expert on many subjects."

The lady smiles, as Tormel awkwardly bows. "Scholars are a rare breed, but always welcome in my house. Before I forget, I had one of my men prepare a map for you. Here you are." She hands over a roll of parchment.

![Image; Map 
of Githa and Thorpenhow](../maps/Githa.JPG)

Starguard looks curiously at the map. "What's the flagged rocks? Or the battlegrounds?"

Tilara peers over the cleric's shoulder. "Those would be farmsites... campsites, maybe, for caravans...? A battlefield and I don't know what. Looks like a cairn on an island." She looks up at Lady San for an explanation.

The lady smiles. "The battle ground is the site of a great battle, some three hundred years ago, where the Stormwinds were temporarily routed. We buried our dead in a great tomb on the island. Similarly, the other cairn marks a major battle too. Although nowadays only barrows remain."

Yuri says, "The people who have been harassing you, could be anywhere... but somewhere that nobody is likely to go, is where they'd best be able to hide."

Starguard nods, tracing his finger on the map. "We should tour the first three farms as we head down, I think. Check to see if those folks are all right."

"The campsites mark places where caravans can camp, and my man also marked the largest farmsteadings. These farms are small hamlets by the by, with one family living in an extended collection of farmhouses." Lady San pauses. "My son was found on the shore of the stream by the first campsite."

Yuri says, "This cairn... " He points at the clearing in the forest. "Is this on a hill, or another high point?"

Starguard winces. "So they're not far in. Lady San? Has there been much contact with the farms?"

Lady San shakes her head. "If anything, the barrows are nestled in a slight valley. But it's hard to tell; that clearing inside the trees ... everything is dead. Only bindweed will grow there. And few people care to travel through bindweed."

Lady San turns back to Starguard, looking troubled. "I had not thought of that. The nearer farmsteads have been bringing food to market. The others come only rarely, so ... I had not noticed the time passing."

Yuri says, "Right... then I think we'll start with a tour of the farms and see what we can find out. Our merchants wish to organize a small fair; this may take a few days, so they'll have time."

Starguard says, "If we knew where the farthest farmer who has brought good in came from, we'd have a very good idea where the bandits are."

Tilara says, "Or at least a good place to start looking."

Starguard nods.

Yuri says, "If they're Changers, and they almost certainly are, they've got better mobility... they can fly."

Lady San nods. "I will have to inquire with the guards, and consult my records. Shall I have Stiles show you to my son's room?"

Yuri says, "I'll wait here while you have a look, Tilara. I'd like to think about this."

Starguard nods curtly at Lady San. "Please. Anything you can offer us would be of great help."

Tilara nods. "All right. Stormy, Tormel... shall we go see what we can find?"

Stiles, still standing by the door, opens it again. "If you will follow me?" He leads Tilara, Stormy, and the others out into the back courtyard, under a low gate, and to a small separate tower. Carefully unlocking the door, he climbs a circular staircase, finally unlocking the single door on the second floor. "We've kept this room locked up since the Master left. Please take care."

_The Sorcerer's Workroom  
The workroom has been left undisturbed since the departure of its owner. An owner who believes in an orderly proliferation of piles, apparently.  
In one corner, a work bench holds a variety of alchemical equipment, and along the opposing wall, a bookshelf holds a large collection of books, many with leather bindings. The center of the room contains a single large work table, which is covered with bowls containing pastes, gems, metal shavings, and unidentifiable powders, as well as piles of papers and a pot containing a variety of quills. Also a small inkpot._

Starguard hmms. "Seems more the wizard than the sorcerer, to be honest..."

Stiles coughs slightly. "The Master was a scholar. A fine scholar."

Tilara nods to Stiles. "We will, thank you." She shrugs to Starguard, and starts by casting a cantrip to detect magic. "The line is blurry, sometimes..."

Tormel slowly steps into the room, examining everything without touching anything. Finally, he stops in front of the bookcase, and turns to Stiles. "How will the books be disposed of?"

Starguard nods, and waits for Tilara to determine what is magical, and potentially hazardous in that respect. He quickly scans for anything obviously poisonous.

As Tilara looks around the room, the dim glow of magic is everywhere. On the work bench, two small bottles gleam particularly brightly. On the table, a small pile of papers glows too. And in the bookcase, three books are almost burning up; the aura is so bright.

Stiles ahems. "The books will be kept. The Lady San has not yet decided what she will do with this workroom."

Tilara says, "He may yet return... stranger things have happened already on this journey." She points out the enchanted objects to Stormy, encouraging him to use his own magical senses. "Those two vials seem to be potions, these might be scrolls - and those are apparently spellbooks."

Starguard says, "Careful. They might be trapped, even though it's unlikely."

Tilara murmurs to Stormy, coaching him in the spell's application. "See that? That color on the vials is evocation magic, and the white on the books indicates protection of some kind... abjuration, it's called." She hmmms at the papers, and picks them up carefully to spread them out. "These are all confused, we need to separate them."

Stormy nods, carefully watching everything Tilara does.

Tormel steps away from the bookcase, nervously eyeing the books Tilara has pointed out. Then, shrugging, he picks up a slim journal that's lying flat n the shelf.

Starguard says, "How...strong a mage was Master San, sir? What was he known to do?"

Stiles hmmms. "I don't know how strength is measured, sir, but he was strong enough to call lightning from the heavens, and water from the earth. We haven't suffered from a drought these ten years past now."

Starguard hmms. "Quite strong then."

Starguard says, "And a great loss."

Stiles nods again. "Indeed. The Lady San was most distraught when the Master was lost. As was the rest of the household. But we must go on; the Master would expect no less."

Tormel pages through the journal, then closes it, and steps back to the bookshelf. He seems to be looking for similar journals, if only because he pulls out two more. "I think, Tilara, that I have found Master San's log books."

Starguard nods, and moves over to the potions, picking up the two that Tilara indicated, and examining them. "Log books?"

Once spread apart, the papers separate into five separate scrolls. Some look far older than others, the handwriting far less well formed."

Tilara says, "His diary?" She smiles to herself at the military terminology that permeates everything here.

Tormel nods at Tilara. "But the cover indicates that these are his log books. A brief glance suggests that he has been experimenting.

Starguard unstoppers the bottles, taking a gentle whiff of their smell as he attempts to identify them.

Tilara picks up the scrolls and looks through them. "Dispel Magic... Lightning Bolt... Locate Object... Comprehend Language, and True Strike." She turns, raising an eyebrow. "Indeed? What did he find out?"

After putting the two older log books down, Tormel turns to the last pages of the newest log book. "Apparently he's been working on a way of bottling fiery breaths. He lists several experiments here, and suggests that these last doses may actually achieve what he expects. But he seems ... uncertain about the side effects."

Starguard says, "I know, I know."

Tilara blinks, and pivots back to where Starguard is investigating the potions. "Better be careful with... oh, dear..."

Starguard hurks, nearly retching as he hurriedly places the potion back down. "Water," he gasps, moving towards the door as tears run down his face.

Tormel continues reading, turning the page. "Ah, yes, here we are. He says he can ameliorate the effect with yoghurt or cream, and that holding the potion inside one can lead to lasting damage."

Tormel corrects himself. "Holding it inside one for too long. Fascinating; he seems to have found a way to spit fire."

Tilara snickers. "I don't think Starguard will think of putting yogurt up his nose. Someone had better go tell him..."

Starguard looks about ready to do it as he searches for water, or better yet, milk.

Stormy nods. "I think I can help. I ... I've been having this odd dream about frost." He points one finger at Starguard's nose, and concentrates heavily.

Tilara says, "Careful, Stormy! Don't let much of that loose, or you'll make things worse."

Stiles leaves the workroom at a run, going to find a water. Meanwhile, a ray of ice arcs from Stormy's fingertip, landing on Starguard's nose and cooling it very thoroughly.

Tormel resumes paging through the log book, after glancing at Starguard and deciding that everything is under control. "Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. The man was experimenting with fire; apparently lightning was too undependable. And such notes!" He puts the log book down carefully, picking up another one. "Ah, and here's a long treatise on the making of scrolls; a comparison of inks and parchments. My name, this man was ... was a genius!"

Starguard gahs as his nose goes from fiery to freezing in a moment, the cold painful. He yelps...but the ice quickly flakes away. "Doh jeez." he says as his sinuses clears. "I need t' sit dowwn. Tanks Tormy." **sniff** "Bud dat hurd..."

Tilara shakes her head and goes back to looking through things. "Really? I should take some notes for myself, then. Damn shame the Changers got him." She looks at the warded books. "I wonder what's in those."

Stormy stands erect, his finger held proudly in front of him as he turns to Tilara. "See? See what I did?"

Stiles comes running back holding a large jug filled with water, and a glass. "M'lord?"

Tilara grins. "Temperature control, in both directions. Very impressive, Stormy."

Stormy grins, prancing around. "Want I should do it again? I think I've got the hang of it now!"

Starguard erfs, his nose looking half-sunburnt and half frost-bitten. "Ow..." Digging in his pouches, he pulls out his 'aspirin'. "Nod as urgend, Diles, bud I cud dill use id."

Tilara says, "Not right now, dear. Save it for when we need it. Lesson for today - restraint. We're surrounded by magic, we don't need to be careless with our own."

Stiles nods, carefully pouring Starguard a glass. "I should have remembered; the Master always had a jug of milk on hand, lately."

Stormy nods, coming down from his jubilant high.

Starguard rolls his eyes. "Da diming of people around here is amazding." He takes his pill, letting it evaporate in his mouth so the healing abilities have less to go.

Tormel keeps leafing through the log books. "I think he's inherited those, Tilara. He makes a note here that he's not ready to open them yet. And here? He mentions that water will not harm them, nor fire burn them. Turns out he had a little ... accident in the lab."

Tilara raises an eyebrow. "Indeed. This is ... intriguing." _And I'd better keep a lid on my curiosity, after lecturing Stormy on restraint. Ask the Major about them._

Tilara says, "Anything in there about where he got them?"

Tormel hmmms. "Not here, and not ..." He leafs all the way back, and then checks the earlier book. "No. These are only his most recent log books. To go by the experiments he catalogues, I'd say he filled one of these every few years. And ..." He goes back to stand in front of the bookshelves again. "I can't see any other obvious log books."

Tilara nods. "Might be in storage, somewhere. We'll ask the Major..." She turns. "Unless you know where they are, Stiles?"

Starguard mmphs as he begins to feel a little better, his nose looking not quite as bad as blood begins to flow to it again. "Stormy. While I appreciate the intent, and the ice did get rid of the chemicals, I'd appreciate it if you didn't do that again. And I'll stop sniffing potions." He coughs. "At least I didn't taste it..."

Stiles shakes his head. "I'm afraid not.

Tormel looks over at Starguard. "Would you like some help with your identification efforts?"

Tilara nods. "A lot to go through, and we don't have the time... we'll do what we can, but one doesn't want to skim rapidly through magic..."

Starguard says, "At this time, Tormel, I think it wise to accept your offer."

Tormel takes up the two stoppered bottles and examines them carefully, comparing the labels with a notation in the book. "Yes; these are his latest experiment." He takes a minute sip, and burps a tiny flame. "And quite effective, too. I estimate ... about two doses per bottle. And quite inert while inside your mouth, except for a slight burning sensation ... Fascinating."

After spending several more hours in the workroom, Stiles leads the group back to Lady San. But those were very productive hours. Many of the books were examined, and proved to be collections of histories, and herbals, and alchemical treatises. The Master was an old-fashioned researcher, interested in everything he encountered, so that a drawing of a small plant might lie right next to an experiment with electricity.

But the definitive finds were the fire-breathing potions, and the scrolls.

Meanwhile, Yuri has been keeping Lady San company.

Yuri asks a lot of questions about the local area, trying to figure out where Changers might hide.

Yuri says, "If they've dropped pitch on your watchtower several times, they'll have a camp. If we can find it, we can learn more."

Lady San puzzles over the map with Yuri, and sighs. "I suspect, personally, that they came from the forests. There are untold mysteries hidden in there, and we have not had the manpower to roust the evil out since the great battles two centuries ago. Every Major wishes to clean the forest, but for now we husband our people, and strive to increase our population and take back the abandoned farm houses ..."

"I wish I knew more. Maybe then our messengers could have made it through." She shakes her head. "I'm sorry." She turns her head as Stiles reappears with the party. "Was my son's room helpful?

Yuri says, "Sometimes a few can do the work of an army. I think that's the strategy the Changers use against us now... and we can turn it back on them. My friends and I can be very effective when we remember to be subtle."

Yuri says, "I wish I knew why they wish to do us harm."

Lady San smiles sadly. "To improve their own lot in life?"

Starguard nods. "I wish I could have met him, milady. He was a genius in his field."

Yuri shakes his head. "There's really no need for people to war, especially when there are so few of us."

Lady San nods. "He was. And such a good teacher. Someday my grandchildren will inherit his room."

Yuri thinks, _We'll save who we can._

Lady San turns to Yuri. "Indeed. But we grow in numbers with every generation. A hundred years ago we couldn't run the caravans."

Tilara says, "Speaking of inheriting... there were three warded books in there, which he mentioned as things he wasn't yet ready to open. Do you know anything about them?"

Yuri says, "We know little of the Changers, but they'd stand to gain more by trading with us than making war."

Lady San pauses. "Covered in a black leather, and obviously warded? Yes. He went into the forest, once, with his wife. He brought the books out, and her corpse."

Yuri says, "And it's for precisely that reason. We're starting to run the caravans again... they need places to go."

Yuri winces.

Tilara nods. "I ... see. Did he ever say anything about where he found them?"

"Where he ... no. For months he lay in bed, almost dying of a fever. When he came to, he had forgotten his wife, and his children, and the books ..." Lady San sighs. "Although some memories returned, he was never the same again."

Yuri says, "I wonder, Lady San, if we might borrow some items from your armory."

Tilara nods. "I'm ... sorry to hear that, milady. I'm afraid I don't think we should touch them yet, either, in that case. The magics on them are incredibly strong."

Lady San nods. "Naturally."

Stiles, from his position by the door, coughs once. "Should we permit them to borrow from the Master's weapons, madame?"

Yuri glances at Stiles. "In light of what Tilara just said, do you think that would be safe?"

Lady San looks up. "Of course. How silly of me. I do believe we still have a few special cross bow bolts left. Please, send a footman to fetch them?" Stiles steps into the hall, and a low-voiced conversation takes place.

Lady San smiles. "My son had a deft hand with crossbow bolts. He carried no weapons this time, for he said they would slow him down."

Yuri says, "I wish that we'd gotten to meet him. It's... I think we could have learned a lot."

A few moments later Stiles returns, carrying a quiver. "We have 12 bolts left, Madame."

Lady San smiles at Yuri. "Take these with our blessing. And I will have the armorer informed that he is to aid you."

Yuri accepts the bolts, and nods. "We'll do what we can."

"And these are the letters. I have finished writing them." She hands Yuri a pouch wrapped in oiled leather, and tied closed. "To each of the towns, and the last to the Emperor.

Yuri examines the packet. "Perhaps you should hold onto this until we're ready to press on. I think for today we won't be going further than the farms."

The Lady nods. "Very well. They will be here, waiting for you."

As the Lady retreats to her desk, so the party retreats to the inn, there to discuss developments.

Yuri says, "Does anyone object to leaving our guards to guard the merchants? They're good with swords, but we'll be sneakier in a smaller group."

Ash says, "Four to four sounds like reasonable coverage.."

Yuri says, "And the five of us, off bushwhacking..."

Tilara says, "Or eight... what about our decorated friends?"

Yuri says, "I think... we should ask them. Given their mission, they may wish to lay low; given their pride, they may wish to fight. And we know they can hide when they want to."

Stormy nods, too. "I can translate for them."

Tilara says, "Probably our best bet. They may prove quite useful."

Stormy trots off, returning with Karlsefnir. "He says he'll fight. They'll fight. They don't like what they're hearing; they're all gloomy."

Tilara blinks at that. "What are they hearing?"

Stormy ummmms ... "I told them about last night. And this morning. And ... ummm ... they're ... ummm ... worried about the messenger. And they're quite determined to get to Citadel."

Yuri tells the caravan guards that if the Company doesn't return in a week, they should escort the caravan back to Red River Town. He pays them for two weeks now... the last week and the coming week.

Tilara nods. "That's perfect, Stormy. Thank you. I thought you might have meant they were actually hearing something we didn't recognize."

At the armory, Yuri borrows a crossbow, and hands out some of Master San's special bolts to each crossbow user... himself, Ash, Andreth, Starguard.

Tilara picks out a shortspear in place of her quarterstaff (which she leaves with the caravan) and a crossbow. She debates about a shortsword, and finally decides to take it, as well.

Stormy, overwhelmed with choice, decides to stay with club and quarterstaff. They're ... easiest to handle.

Starguard restocks his crossbow bolts back up to an even two dozen, and a few of Master San's special bolts.

Yuri looks over his gear, and leaves his shortbow and darts on the cart, taking a dozen bolts instead.

---

After spending some time checking equipment, picking up new weapons, and memorizing the map, the party sets out. As they leave Thorpenhow, the guards all wish them well. The road leading back down the hill is as muddy as it was yesterday, and the rain periodically falls down in great falls from the sky.

After following the road for about an hour, the party encounters the first marked side trail, and strike off into the bush. The surrounding land is mostly flat, and covered in bushes and tall grasses, with few trees in sight.

Yuri takes the point, and takes advantage of the relative quiet to practice sneaking as a group.

The first signs of farming consist of some fences, old and barely maintained, that are apparently strong enough to corral the cows. Old cows, young cows, calves ... all lipping at the long grasses.

The party, practicing its sneaking skills, walks alongside the path. It's hard to be invisible when the nearest ground cover comes less than waist high, but they can practice walking quietly, without making a sound. A practice that is desperately needed. A bard might describe their current progress as approximating a herd of stampeding cows.

Starguard sighs. "Sorry. I automatically march when I'm out here. I never had to do silent operations."

The cows look up, see the humans, snort, and go back to eating. Humans are nice, but chewing cud is nicer.

Tilara says, "Things look normal so far... if the cows needed to be milked, they'd be coming toward us."

Yuri shrugs. "Well, let's find a farmhouse. If there's strange animals running around out here, they'll know."

Following the fence, the party encounters tilled fields, where the crops are beginning to come up. But other than plants, the fields are empty. But beyond, you can see a collection of farmhouses, built in something approximating a circle. There's smoke coming from at least two chimneys, and someone is leading a chorus of kids in a teaching song about spinning.

And then a dog starts barking.

And a second dog.

And then the whole pack begins to bay.

Tilara says, "Well, that's got their attention. If they react badly, we'll know they've been having trouble."

Yuri says, "This plan... lacks subtlety."

And the whole pack begins to converge on the party. At full speed. At full howl.

Ash hrms. "You'd be better off, Yuri, getting those of us who can.. what the hell?"

Ash says, ".... Dogs' owners look unhappy."

Whoof! Howl! Bark! Growl! Grrrr! Nice puppy! Grrr!

Yuri says, "Hey! Call them off! We're friends! The Major sent us!"

Starguard's hand goes to his weapon, just resting there. Bloody mutts.

Tilara keeps her new spear at the ready, but doesn't make any aggressive moves. Mirra climbs to her shoulder, hissing at the dogs.

"Down! Down! Down boys! Dammit, down!" Soon, three burly farmers can be seen, wrestling the dogs to a halt. A fourth steps forward. "Welcome to the Eloy Syndic, lads. We weren't expecting you."

Starguard nods. "Well met. Energetic dogs you have. - Down boy! - We're here to try to deal with the trouble on the road to the south."

Yuri eyes the dogs warily. "I'm Yuri. We're the White Company. We're supposed to be running a caravan through here, but we're worried about brigandry. The Major asked us to check in on the farms while we're scouting."

The man nods. "Well, we're well enough. It's been a wolvin' season, which is why the dogs are loose. But we're fine. You tell that nice lady that we'll keep the food going in."

Yuri says, "Wolving season? You mean there's more wolves than usual about?"

The man nods. "Aye. Every decade or so, the wolf packs grow, and we has ta hunt them back down again."

Tilara says, "Noticed anything odd about the wolves, by chance?"

Yuri nods. "That's all up and down the road, they've been having wolf trouble. Anywhere in particular?"

"Now that the crops are in, we can go ahuntin'. And aye; most wolf packs are a lot ... leaner ... than this bunch." The man shrugs. "Aye; they comes across the border, they does. The dogs hae smelt em out."

Ash frowns deeply but says nothing.

Yuri thinks, _Up from Lurinor. That might mean that they're moving west from the mountains..._

The man waves at his partners, who begin to drag the dogs away. "So ye'll tell the lady, aye?"

Yuri nods. "She'll be happy to hear it, I'm sure."

Starguard nods. "I think the wolves might be a bit thicker than even your used to. Besides, we're committed to breaking through to Githa."

Yuri nods again, his expression slightly sour. "Hopefully that won't take long."

Ash calls out, "So we can relay to the Major, what's your family name?"

"Like I said, sirrah! We're the Eloy Syndic!"

Ash hrms. "Kept the same name, eh? Different from what I'm used to.."

The man shrugs. "We're all descendants of Old Poppa Eloy."

Yuri looks slightly perplexed, but doesn't really feel the need to ask more.

Ash grins. "Thanks, and good farming to you."

"And good travels to you, young uns." The man pulls back the last of the dogs, and waits for the party to pass, watching you as you pass him by. He peers particularly carefully at the Andvarri.

Ash mumbles as he goes. "strange strange. Then again, in ours there were outside marriages, so.."

Starguard sighs. "Look guys, it's no use. Try heading up ahead of me."

The party continues down the road, still trying to walk silently. Stormy's having a little trouble; he spends so much time watching where he puts his feet, he forgets to watch his quarterstaff. Which keeps banging into people. Until people separate a little ...

Ash says, "I was thinking about that, Yuri. We could send the quieter people around or off to the side or the back, as reinforcement, and let the louder of us - well, me, mostly - be bait."

Yuri murmurs, "It's not just you, Brother. It's hard to move in a group, even for me. Maybe especially."

Tilara says, "You keep tripping over each other."

Starguard nods. "Scout and army seems more logical."

Yuri says, "I don't like using people as bait, Ash. But we'll see. I get the feeling trouble will find us before we find it."

As the afternoon wanes, the road turns, to run alongside a small lake. A single boat sits in the middle of the lake, with - it would appear - a single fisherman.

The road turns further, leading to a second collection of farmhouses. Again, there is smoke coming from the chimneys, although - it being later in the day - there are no teaching songs being sung.

The dogs, on the other hand, are once more in full voice. A single solo leads to a joyous duet, which soon gives rise to a full chorus. Of howls.

Yuri sighs. "Is this going to become a regular occurrence?"

Yuri calls out again, that the Company are friends, sent by the Major, please don't eat us.

A single man comes out, shrugging on a coat. At his bellow, the dogs all fall down flat. 'I give you greeting; we are the Barton Syndic. Will you share our table tonight?"

Ash rubs his hands together. "Well that's more like it.."

Andreth watches the dogs flop on command. "Well-trained dogs, sir," he says admiringly.

Yuri waves back, and murmurs to Tilara, "I'd rather camp out tonight. What do you think?"

The man nods at Andreth. "A poorly trained dog is hardly useful. Ours will listen to every child, and defend them to the death." He pats one on the head. "But we talk in miserable weather, and the main house is warm, the fire's lit and the food is cooked."

Tilara says, "Well, I wouldn't mind eating with them... but we should keep moving, yes. Only if they're ready to eat now."

Yuri says, "Forgive us sir, but if we have dinner with you, we'd have to move on shortly after. We've been sent to hunt brigands, and the Major asked us to check the farms on the way."

The man nods. "Still, we'll see you fed. And we've news for the Major; you can bring it to her in person."

Ash hrms. "Speaking of news to pass along. For one of the farming families, Mr, Barton, the Eloy up the way seemed well, downright inhospitable. They mentioned wolves - anything else that might have put a fright into them?"

Tilara says, "Oh, they weren't that bad. Just didn't have their dogs trained as well."

Yuri says, "Then we'll gladly join you. I am Yuri of the White Company." He quickly introduces the others, pausing briefly to try and figure out how to diplomatically describe the Andvarri. "These men... have come from a foreign land far to the North, and travel with us for mutual protection."

Yuri says, "Well, they Eloy were polite enough, but I think we were unprepared for the racket the dogs made. I know it can be hard to know who to trust out here, but I tremble to think what would happen to a traveling peddler."

Ash frowns at Yuri. "That's a city attitude. If a man showed up on my father's doorstep, he'd be shown in, fed, fed again, and possibly dressed before he felt dust on his boots again. When you aren't used to being robbed blind by muggers or merchants, out here.. you can afford to be friendly."

The man nods. "I'm Jesh. Come and be welcome. Down lads. These be friends for the night." Obviously the man is talking to the dogs who jump up, tails wagging, and head back for the barn. He leads everyone into the largest house. "Maw! Eight for supper! Right, lads, break out the plates." As everyone enters the large front room kids erupt from the table, running hither and yon to collect mugs, plates, etc. The party is herded to table, where Jesh sinks majestically into the main chair. Filled plates and mugs soon appear in front of everyone. Dinner tonight will be a thick stew, and a good ale, it appears.

Yuri nods to Ash. "I have much to learn about customs away from the guilds and the looms."

Starguard quickly offers to help, pitch in where he can, either with the cooking or keeping track of the kids.

Tilara nods. "No burglars out here, Yuri. Wolves and bears mainly. The outlaw bands usually leave farmers alone."

The smaller kids are sent off to the other houses, where table space is more ... available. And soon only adults are left. Jesh fills up his pipe, and takes a pull. "So ye've seen the Eloy's, have ye? Feh. They're nae more a Syndic than they're farmers." He turns to watch Brother Starguard. "Sit, sit. Guests dinnae chase the kids; that's the elder kids' jobs." He points at the the plate. "Have a taste; Maw's the best cook this side of the border."

Yuri says, "Well, speaking of that, have any wolves or bears been seen in these parts? The Eloys mentioned that wolves were particularly thick on the ground of late."

Starguard mmms, delicious. "I could get used to this..."

Jesh turns to look intently at Yuri. "Wolves? Aye, we've seen wolves. We've seen cats, too. And summats stirrin' up the old battle site. We're putting the last of the crops in this week, while the rain holds. And then we're on a hunt. Smoked wolf is a fine delicacy."

Tilara chuckles. "If there were only a way to stick it in your rucksack to pull out every night, eh?" She looks rather disturbed by the idea of smoked wolf, but doesn't say anything. "Any odd birds?"

"Odd birds ..." Jesh sucks on his pipe, blowing out a smoke ring. "Nah ... we've seen the odd hawk or so, but none we could shoot down. Too high up."

Starguard hmms. "I think I see why the wolves and cats and the like would stay away from the farms."

Tilara nods. "They've been having trouble back at the town with birds... wondered if you'd noticed anything out here."

"Townies ... They just dinnae know how to cook a decent predator, do they?" Jesh chuckles, then sobers up. "We've heard the warnin's the Major sent round. And we've kept the crossbows loaded, but we've nae scored a bird yet. As I said, too high up."

Yuri says, "Perhaps you've seen which direction they come from, or which direction they go to?"

Yuri says, "It wouldn't be one of the old battlefields, would it?"

Jesh grins. "As I said, lad, there's summat stirrin' up the old battle site ...

Tilara says, "So, what _is_ happening at the old battlefield?"

Jesh shakes his head. "I dunno. Rumours fly about the island bein' haunted. And people finding old, tattered skeletons lyin' in the fields. All the dead were buried, my paw told me, and so they shouldnae be comin' up out a' the ground."

Yuri hmms. "What have you heard from farms down in that area? And what was it that you wanted us to tell the Major for you?"

Jesh grins. "We had a good calvin' season. We'll be sendin' two calves along for the young uns' festival, in a few weeks. And we've been expanding too. We've five new children, and only lost two of the elders over th'winter."

Jesh sighs, blowing another smoke ring. "And tell her bout the battle sites, too. We're a little short on priests if they come north."

Yuri nods, and rummages through his pockets for a piece of parchment. "I see. She'll probably want to record the names... and I'd better write them down if I'm to remember."

Yuri makes his notes and puts the sheet away. "It seems that the farms are mostly independent of the town. I mean, you have your own food, of course. That's enough by itself."

Jesh nods. "Shoona, Kern, Paul, Assandra - named her for the Major - and Kiern. We named him for her son. He was born two days ago. Screams fit ta burst a lung, when he's hungry. And old Kelly and Jen passed by." He pauses. "Aye, lad, we make do, we make do. There's a lot of land left to reclaim, this side o' the border."

As the last plates are emptied, a whole horde of younguns descend on the table, grabbing plates, refilling mugs, and arguing about who gets washing and drying chores ...

Tilara says, "Make it quick, kids, and I'll do some juggling for you before we have to leave."

The kids start moving even faster. Soon the entire room is empty, dishes put away, and Tilara is hip deep in kids.

Yuri reflects on the way and the length the stories are told, about life on these farms. _People like us take notes to the Major, and the Major writes it up in her journal... which later Majors may or may not read. But all the names and dates are still there, like the Spires. One's just a more visible form of the other._

Yuri grins at Tilara. "Clever."

Jesh smiles, watching, then turns to Ash, and Yuri. "So where will you and your decorated friends go next? Greer's, down the road?"

Tilara chuckles. "I'll take them outside while you finish up in here, Yuri..." She leads the youngsters outside and starts one of her routines...

Starguard nods. "We're going to stop at every place along the way. If we get to one that's empty and shouldn't be..." He shrugs.

Jesh nods. "Greer's is the last on this road. And they're hangin' fine. Had a weddin' just last week. Is how we lost our priest, bedanged."

Yuri says, "Is that the third big stead? Yeah, that's the plan. And then to check on the smaller farms, to see if anyone's been giving them trouble."

Starguard says, "Lost your priest?"

Yuri looks puzzled. "Ummm... did he die, or get married?"

Jesh grins. "If he'd died, lad, I'd a given you 'is name. Nae, he just married a Greer girl. And they had a spare house free. But his sister is comin' up saintly, she'll serve."

Ash asides to Yuri, "Years ago, a lot of land was unclaimed. Families started settling in. Instead of lords and farmers, you had fathers and their sons. The head of this family is um, well, basically the lord of the land, as far as anyone goes."

Starguard grins. "Would that our profession lost more that way. Though not all sects believe that you have to be single."

Yuri nods to Ash. "So those are the Syndics? Leaders of a group of farms?"

Jesh blows another smoke ring. "You're in the family, are ya, Ash-lad? Remind yer brother that we marry our priests; aint no reason they caint raise a few kids while they keep us healthy ..."

Ash chuckles softly. "My father wanted me in a temple, but he also wanted grandkids. I never imagined anyone would think the two were uh, mutually exclusive?"

Jesh looks Ash up and down. "Nah; yer da's a fool. Yer nae more a priest than yer brother is a monk. But which Syndic ya from?"

Starguard grins. "Actually, it's more the army life that's kept me from the second. Hard to marry and be on the move all the time.:"

Ash muses. "well, Lainsborough's where I called home.. family name's changed a couple times, but the homestead kept old Mama Lain's name in honor."

Jesh nods. "Nae kiddin'. We heard of the Lainsboroughs. Yer doin' well. Bring honor to yer Syndic, lad, and all. Now, you'll be stayin' the night. Maw's made yer beds. And we'll have ye fresh and hearty on yer way tomorrer."

Yuri says, "We appreciate the hospitality. Discounting last night, we haven't slept in real beds for some time."

Tilara settles into her act for the kids, and not a few of the younger adults of the farm. It's not her best performance - she's rusty, and worried about what could possibly be happening at the old battleground - but she doesn't make any obvious blunders, and the kids are mesmerized. As dusk settles in, she finishes up with the aid of some magical lights, juggling them as if they were physical objects before tossing them into the throng of kids and letting them pop like miniature fireworks. She bows as the others come out. "And now, I think it's time we were on our way. Thank you for being a great audience, kids!"

The kids applaud enthusiastically and politely, but let Tilara go as she requests. Especially when Stormy pulls off a quick juggle behind her back.

Yuri murmurs to Ash, on the way to bed, "Funny, I didn't think you liked to talk about your past much. So this is how you grew up?"

Ash chuckles softly on the way. "Well.. I wasn't much more than a farm-boy back then. Talking about it .... reminds me of the limited role my family wanted for me. I love my family, but... what they want for me isn't what I really want.. hard to explain."

Yuri says, "Nah. Not that hard. They wanted me to live my life by a loom. And today I'm out here, so I guess that pretty much sums it up."

Tilara shakes her head. "Might be hard to explain, Ash, but... I know exactly what you mean."

Yuri says, "Come to think of it, it goes for all of us, one way or another."

Yuri says, "But I think that's a longer story than we're ready for right now."

Ash nods and answers softly. "Then let's get back to our jobs."

The party is brought to big double beds, with much apologies for the lack of greater privacy. With little ado, blankets are provided, and soap, and hot water, and Tilara gets her own private room. In the morning, after a full breakfast, Brother Starguard is asked to bless the stead, although he's welcome of course not to, and they'll understand, but it would be a fine thing to hear a blessing. And the party resumes traveling down the road.

The weather has moderated a little, though the road is left muddy. Still, with a firm tread the party reaches the second lake well before noon, and the next farmstead is not far.

And this time, some of the dogs are in the field, so you're found early. By a kid about four feet tall. And a pack of about ten dogs ...

The dogs are in full force.

Ash sighs and lets out the loudest, strongest growl he can muster.

And in full howl too. Until the kid yells at them, once, at which point they fall silent. "Howdy. Whassup?"

And then the dogs begin to crawl away from Ash ... and the kid begins to look worried.

Ash looks smugly satisfied.

Tilara rolls her eyes. "Great. Now they think you're some kind of weird creature yourself, farmboy."

Starguard says, "Sorry about that. Who might you be?"

The kid ummmms. "I be Jellicoe Greer. Who're you?"

Yuri says, "We're the White Company. I'm Yuri. The Major up in Thorpenhow sent us to visit the farms."

The kid fidgets with her fishing rod. "I gotta go. The fish'll stop biting soon. And I promised Paw a full string. Paw sed if I wuz to see you ta tell you he wuz 'spectin' yuz and he gots a list of names for the Major and if you hurries you can have 'levenses. He's holdin' it for you. And I gotta go. Bye!" The kid splits, the dogs chasing after her, as she heads for the lake.

Yuri says, "How can anybody be expecting us? Nobody passed us on the road."

Tilara watches the kid disappear toward the lake. "Expecting us, eh? Interesting..."

Tilara says, "Of course, this is where the priest went. Maybe he's dabbling with clairvoyance."

Starguard says, "Ah, the country. No matter how fast you go, word gets there first."

Yuri says, "Interesting idea... but this is serious. Remember the Major's son."

Moving down the road, the party soon reaches another well tended syndic. And this time ... no dogs. Well, one dog. And a kid. About six years old. He bounces up and down and then settles down, with what is obviously a rehearsed speech. "Welcome to the Greer Syndic. We are honoured by your visit. If you will please join us? An' if you hurry maw made plum puddin' and that never lasts so ya gotta hurry! Come on! Maw sed she'd save my slive, but she promised nuffink bout yours and I'll have to give up mine if we're out!"

Tilara nods. "So we'll keep our eyes open."

Tilara grins. "Kids... always the same. We'll hurry, dear. What's your name?"

The kid bounces. "Hurry! hurry! I'm Smiths, I'm gonna beat up on metal some day!"

Ash laughs softly. "Yuri, it might surprise you to know I used to talk just like that."

Inside the farmstead, a single man is sitting with a whole clutch of kids. He stands to welcome you. "Greetings, and welcome to the Greer Syndic. Jesh sent word, so I've made up a list of names for the Major, if you'll take them. And Piers just went ta check campsite; he sez nobody's used it since Lady San's son died."

Tilara says, "Is that where it happened? We're trying to figure things out for her, too, as well as checking up on the farmsteads."

Yuri says, "If you know about the problem with Lady San's son, do you think it's risky to send out your own? I'm surprised word precedes us, but I guess by now it's probably gotten around that we're hunting the people responsible."

The man nods. "Aye. First we heard of the troubles, we saw the fireworks on campsite. Piers was just bringin' fresh wood, too. We're closest, so we keep the site supplied, ye see. Though it's rarely used, bein' sae close to town. And we send the lads with full packs of dogs. We've nae been bothered yet."

Yuri nods. "We're the White Company. I'm Yuri." He makes the other introductions, including the same diplomatic cover for the Andvarri.

The man nods. "I'm Greer. Fenton Greer. And welcome to you. I just wish we had more aid to give you. We don't even have any wolves for you to examine. Hunt's not till next week."

Starguard hmms. "I wonder if that's what they're waiting for..."

Yuri says, "I think we're just glad to here that nobody's been hurt. I feared worse when we left town."

Fenton grins. "Och, we're nae sae afeared. We've plenty numbers on our side. And a young priest who's keen ta get back to his wife when the trouble's over."

Tilara chuckles. "Aye, the Bartons mentioned him."
