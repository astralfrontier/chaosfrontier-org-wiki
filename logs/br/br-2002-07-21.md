Game Log: Chapter 32 - The Mounds of the Dead


-------------------------------------------------

While the wolves pad in small circles, patrolling, and Grargh's snores are enough to raise the dead, the party waits for daybreak. There's something comforting about going in to face the Barrows at full strength. Meanwhile, Andreth and the two scouts watch, and wait, taking turns to sleep lightly.

As the sun begins to rise, the barrows loom ever larger in the field. The bindweed shifts in the dawn, and there's no breeze to explain the shift. But as you stand, you can see that the barrows form two concentric circles around the two tallest barrows in the centre. And as the light improves, you can see hints of colour in the centre.

Yuri looks out over the barrows. "Where to begin..."

Andreth shakes his head... _It's no good, I have to find out what's going on._ He signs to the scouts to watch and wait, then creeps off in silence well away from their position, so that when he breaks silence he won't give them away...

One of the wolves pads up as Andreth approaches, sniffing him and whining. Soon three wolves surround him.

Andreth stops and makes no threatening moves. "I'm with them," he says, indicating the party with a slow and careful gesture.

The wolves move aside, herding Andreth into the midst of the party.

Ash scowls. "So we need two swords, right? Why don't we just go get two swords? Least this time we PROBABLY won't get jumped by wolves." He points at the nearest barrow.

Yuri says, "The nearest barrows are also probably the ones that have been most thoroughly looted. Even so, I don't want to go for the middle ones."

Yuri says, "How about the nearest one on the second ring?"

Starguard says, "We need two, Yuri. I'd prefer just to take the two closest."

Tilara clears her throat, pointing at a patch of bindweed. "There's a body in there. And it's not nearly as old as the barrows."

Stormy nods at Tilara. "There's a faint smell of decay on the air, too." He turns to look at Graargh. "I wonder ..."

Yuri says, "A... body?"

Yuri says, "How far in?"

Ash snorts. "I'd rule the cause of death was stupidity for approaching the bindweed," he remarks in a sarcastic tone.

Tilara says, "Probably. Let's not repeat the error, eh?"

Andreth says, "Maybe we should have a closer look?"

Ash rolls his eyes at that, making a \`is nobody listening?' facial expression but saying nothing further.

Yuri says, "Tilara... can you and Stormy burn us a path to any of the barrows?"

Tilara says, "We can try. You want the one with the bones, or a different one?"

Yuri says, "The nearest one. Less far to run if we have to flee in panic."

Yuri says, "Speaking of which... do these flowers have any medicinal value?"

Yuri says, "Maybe the guy got poisoned wading in."

Yuri says, "Guys... that's not the only body... there's more. And they were all running away at the time."

Starguard looks out upon the tangles of waving grass. "We can move slowly through that mess. But it looks like someone's farming it." He pauses, remembering the tangle bags that were used against us, less than a month ago. "It's a prime ingrediant in tanglefoot bags."

Ash frowns. "Seems like a good idea to burn the stuff away, if we're leaving in a hurry like these unfortunate souls."

Andreth hrms. "Guess they didn't get very far what with the bindweed."

Yuri says, "Interesting. We'll want to bring some of that back."

Tilara says, "Doesn't look that way. Shall we clear a path, then?"

Starguard says, "It doesn't burn well, I'm afraid."

Yuri points to a barrow on the far side. "See that one, near the wider path? Those have been the least molested. No, don't try to burn it, then, but let's pick one and get hacking."

Tilara pulls out her sword. "Let's do it, then."

Starguard pulls his crossbow. "Let's go."

Andreth looks down at his bare hands. "Anyone got a spare axe or somethin'?"

Yuri blinks. "Wait. Andreth. When did you show up?"

Andreth blinks. "I couldn't wait out there any longer without findin' out what you guys were up to."

Yuri shrugs. "Well, you're here, now."

Starguard grins, and turns to Andreth. "One more thing." Moving close, he lays his hands on Andreth's shoulder, chanting. "Give him the strength of a bull, to charge into battle, oh stars." Starguard's hands glow an angry red, celestial power infusing Andreth's muscles and bones.

Ash turns, looks surprised, but also smiles and offers his two-hander for Andreth's use in clearing the obstacle course while he relies on his longsword.

Ash says, "Ya should be able to swing this sucker around better than I can, with that blessing."

Yuri says, "Anybody object to 'around' and 'in', to minimize the time we spend cutting bindweed?"

Ash nods. "The faster we do this, the faster we're back on the road."

Yuri says, "Then I suggest that one" - he motions to the barrow on the outer ring, near the northern gap, which appears least molested.

Yuri says, "There's fewer bodies. That might mean it's less dangerous."

Starguard says, "Or it might just mean no-one's tried that one yet." Starguard shrugs. "It's the second one I'm worried about."

Yuri says, "We only need two swords, not two barrows."

Yuri says, "Let's get going."

Andreth says, "Well, we gotta start somewhere. If we gotta go in, that is." He swings the greatsword a few times, clearly never having handled a weapon of that size before.

The party cautiously makes its way around the open grave site, picking their way in and around the trees. The wolves follow along, curious, and Graargh, now awake, stands where he slept and watches. As they reach the barrow Yuri suggested, the bindweed seems to thin a little, suggesting an avenue. But even so, there's a fair bit of hacking to do to reach the entrance itself. By the time the entrance is reached, everyone is covered in snippets of bindweed.

Andreth returns Ash's greatsword to him as the last swath of bindweed falls. "Here. I ain't much good with weapons this big."

Starguard says, "Perhaps we should cut to the second one and make one run?"

The entrance is closed by a single slab of stone, about man height and two arms' lengths wide. It sits at an angle, as the barrow itself only extends about three feet above the plain.

Ash chuckles. "Hey, you did fine. Just remember, if it holds up a sword at you and is wearing quarter-inch armor, your fist is not your best bet. Bigger is better, sometimes."

Yuri hmms. "What are these? Marks on the door? Are they counters?"

Tilara says, "Four of 'em, whatever they are. Let's hope it isn't something tallying up its kills."

Starguard says, "Maybe this is barrow number four. We need to pull another sword, so let's cut to a second barrow now while it's still quiet?"

Yuri says, "How fast does bindweed grow back? Will it still be clear?"

Ash glowers. "That's remarkably optimistic, old man. But yeah, you got a good idea."

Starguard says, "It grows like grass, Yuri. We've got weeks."

Yuri says, "OK, yes, then maybe we should cut through it now."

Yuri says, "Umm... Andreth... if you would? The rest of us aren't as fast."

Andreth nods. "Sure thing," he says. "I guess you could gimme that back for a minute?" he says to Ash.

Ash returns the enormous blade. "Be my guest."

Andreth is soon off clearing a path to the neighboring barrow.

While Andreth clears a path to the next nearest barrow in the outer ring, Yuri carefully examines the stone. It doesn't seem to be hinged, and there's no lock, so opening the barrow should be a matter of removing the stone. Easy enough for two of you to do.

Casting his gaze further afield, Yuri carefully searches the bindweed. He finds a few bones, and three gold pieces. But the only recent signs of passing he finds are the body parts he's already noted.

The stone does appear to be a little younger than the rest of the barrow. And it shows signs of having been disturbed recently. Say in the past season or two ...

Yuri pockets the gold, and resolves to buy a round of drinks later.

Yuri says, "I think we have to wait for Andreth to move this..."

Yuri pokes around at the perimeter of the barrow while Andreth is gardening, trying to guess what's inside.

Starguard nods. "Get ready, folks. I have a bad feeling about this..."

Tilara says, "I don't think we want to break it. Let's wait until we have enough people to remove it carefully."

Andreth returns, handing back the sword once again. "So, what next? Get that big hunk o'rock off the door?"

Starguard says, "Yeah. Did you catch how the other barrow was marked?"

Andreth blinks. "Uhr, no," he says, shaking his head.

Yuri gets out a crossbow. "Let's keep him covered."

Yuri says, "There might be something nasty waiting inside."

Starguard levels his crossbow. "Might be?" he asks, looking at the skeletons.

Tilara nods. "You do the bow, Stormy and I will be waiting if we need flame." She steps back a little ways, trying to maintain a clear field of fire.

As the stone is pulled away from the barrow, sun shines down into the hole beyond. A steep slope leads into a narrow cave. The party pauses for a moment. Did something go clank?

Ash shrugs. "I guess that leaves me to lead off."

Yuri says, "No... let me."

Yuri says, "If there's any fiendish devices you'll need me to disable them."

Starguard nods. "You go right behind him, Ash. Then Stormy and Tilara, me, then Andreth."

Ash shrugs again, but nods his assent. "Alright. I got your back."

_... a scraping sound ..._

Yuri pulls out a candle and lights it, and proceeds slowly into the hole.

Ash tightens his knuckles around the hilt of his sword, the first steel he ever swung, and waits. This has officially stepped out of the realm of brigands, bandits and birdmen; now things are in definitely unknown territory..

Yuri draws his dagger and uses it to poke carefully at the area immediately inside the entrance, then moves cautiously inside.

As Yuri enters the hole the scraping sound intensifies. He takes a moment to look around. What with the steep slope, he can soon straighten up. He finds himself close to the centre of a room perhaps ten feet long, perhaps 8 feet wide, and filled with a large group of skeletons.

The skeletons press forward, slashing at Yuri as he awkwardly scrambles back up onto the plain. One connects, its fist smashing into Yuri's arms. But he manages to make it out ... And behind him the skeletons boil upwards.

Yuri says, "Gaah! We've got company!"

Yuri says, "Stormy! Tilara! Burn it!"

Starguard brings out the twin starbursts. "By the stars, let these dead men rest, and their spirits soar to the sky!" A light shines from the holy symbol and as it glows, the skeletons simply disintegrate. The zombie flee from the symbol, crying out as they run away to hide.

Yuri turns and stares back at the expanding puffs of bone dust, weapons drawn, and then his eyes go as wide as saucers. "Oh, wow..."

Andreth whispers softly, "Great are the gods..."

Tilara lowers her hands again, not needing a fire spell after all. "Very nice, Starguard."

Starguard says, "Hurry! The zombies will lose their fear in a minute!"

Ash thumps Yuri on the shoulder gently. "Me or you, buddy."

Yuri nods, closes his mouth, and skulks back into the barrow. "Stay _close_..."

Andreth follows close on Yuri's heels.

Starguard advances in line, his holy symbol held high...

Ash stays near Starguard, his weapon ready. There's no guarantee that this barrow is the only one with fell guardians awaiting, nor is there any promise that others haven't awakened.

Following Yuri inside, Andreth finds the second zombie cowering against the far wall. He sets to with his fists, which fly everywhere and are soon coated in sticky ichor. As his zombie collapses, he turns. Yuri is having a slightly harder time with his zombie, but with a little help the second zombie is soon disposed off.

The room contains only the two pseudo fresh corpses, and the two adventurers. And a trapdoor in the centre, which leads down. There's no obvious traps. No unobvious traps, either.

Andreth guhs, trying with little success to wipe his hands clean. "What a mess..." He eyes the trapdoor. "Heh, figures - we're only just gettin' started."

Yuri says, "Maybe they're all connected by tunnels. Wouldn't be the wierdest thing. Everyone else OK?"

Starguard calls down from the entrance. "All fine up here! Anybody left down there who's moving and not supposed to be?"

Andreth calls back, "Nope, just us!"

Andreth hmms. "Y'know, where were those guys before they came after us? Ain't any place for 'em to 've been in here."

Starguard says, "Right!" He bows, letting his holy symbol drop. "After you?" he says, allowing Tilara to go down.

Stormy hangs back in the doorway, eyeing the crowded room.

Yuri gets to work on the trap door, and it opens easily.

Tilara half-grins. "How genteel of you, Starguard." She pops down the slope, though, trying to stay out of the way. "Doesn't look like there's any space here for anyone to be buried. Further down and further in."

Yuri pokes through the trap door with candle and dagger.

Starguard sighs, looking skyward. "Goodie. Nothing quite like close quarters for fighting. Stars be with us."

Ash stays silent, observing Yuri's actions. "Stars seem to have been so far," he remarks with a hint of glee.

Andreth pulls a torch from his backpack, and gestures toward the candle. "Could I have a light?"

Yuri says absently, "Of course they are. The Gods are keeping their eye on us. We as much as invited them to do their worst when we got Andreth back."

Yuri sits up and lights Andreth's torch.

As Yuri leans over, he sees a far larger room below, filled with two foot wide and five foot long shelves. Many of which are definitely not empty.

Tilara sighs. "We've got their attention, now. This _can't_ be a good thing."

Yuri says, "Looks like shelves of bodies down there. Like a charnel house, or... catacombs."

Ash coughs. "Oil. Torch."

Starguard comes to the edge and peers down. "I can't turn that many."

Yuri says, "I don't think they're all mobile..."

Yuri leans back and takes a head count.

Yuri says, "Well... guess we better get on with it."

Andreth murmurs softly, "_Somethin's_ movin' down there..."

Yuri sticks his head through for another listen.

Tilara nods. "Very faint... but I heard something, too."

Mirra hisses and runs back to her mistress. "Yes, I heard it too. Something's shuffling around down there."

Starguard hmms. "Perhaps I should go first this time? The Stars will help me hold off the first wave..."

Yuri says, "Starguard." He points at several of the pallets. "Those... they're moving."

Yuri says, "Stormy... I know it's crowded, but come in here and stay close to Tilara?"

Stormy nods, moving inside. "Shouldn't someone keep watch? This stone door looks a lot harder to shift from the inside ..."

Tilara twitches. "Now _that_ was a truly disquieting thought, Stormy..."

Starguard nods, and moves to drop down. "No help for it, I guess. I want you guys behind me _quickly_."

Yuri says, "Yes, but if you watch from inside, you won't get ambushed from outside."

Starguard slides down, and then quickly hangs over the gap, using his arms to slow the drop. As he falls, his legs extend to hit the ground easily, one hand to the twinned stars...

Starguard oofs, falling as he hits the uneven stone, sprawling on the floor.

Yuri removes the rope from his pack and tosses it to Stormy. "See if you can find a place to tie that and follow us down."

Jumping down, Ash and Andreth follow Starguard, sword and fist raised warily. The room, a long uneven oval, is ringed with shelves stacked four and five deep, leaving a narrow empty oval in the centre. Many of the shelves contain bundles, and some of the bundles are shifting.

Yuri waits patiently up above, fingers crossed. _If you ARE watching... remember that the longer this story goes... the more interesting it will be._

Tilara jumps down, her landing a bit hard from the height. She shakes her head and straightens up, looking around at the shifting bundles. "See any swords?"

Yuri says softly, "It looks crowded down there... you sure you want me, too?"

Tilara murmurs, "Let's not overdo things..." Mirra mrrowls, peering down beside Yuri.

Looking around, Tilara sees mostly shelves. There are chests stacked below each shelf, but what they contain is not immediately obvious. Meanwhile, as Ash waits, two bundles resolve themselves into leathery corpses, advancing on him with arms outstretched.

Ash waits patiently, and as the first of the shambling figures presents itself he delivers three well-aimed, and very accurate cuts, a smile of confidence on his face. The look of triumph fades, though, as he realizes that the shock of pain that would down a mortal man hasn't laid a finger on this mobile corpse. The cuts are there, but still it advances.

Andreth, meanwhile, is facing off against another shambling form, and lashes out with a kick as it approaches, catching it heavily on the thigh, following up with a one-two punch - or at least an attempt at one, the first one connecting solidly but the second one whistling past the tattered remains of an ear.

A fourth zombie advances on Tilara, where she stands underneath the trapdoor, its arms outstretched. Starguard takes a quick headcount. Four zombies out in the open, and four others still moving off their pallets.

Starguard raises his holy symbol high. "Stars, protect us from these walking dead!" A holy light surrounds Starguard, and the four attacking zombies turn and cower. The four rising from the pallets seem unaffected, however, and move to replace the first four.

Tilara swings the blunt end of her half-spear at one of the zombies, but misses as it turns away.

The four rising zombies shamble in, zeroing in on Brother Starguard's holy light.

Yuri decides to stay where he is, and draws a bead on a zombie with his crossbow. From his relatively unmolested position, he fires a bolt that solidly buries itself into the chest of a nearby undead.

Ash lets his attention divert for a few seconds to the mass of dead flesh converging on the little group's salvation, he manages to dismember one of the creatures.

Tilara moves up and slams the butt end of her half-spear into the first zombie. The blow glances off the dead flesh, though, and doesn't seem to do much damage.

Andreth eases back to let the _ki_ flow through him, then leaps forward with a fist plowing straight _through_ the zombie's upper arm, following up with a sweeping kick that sends a rotting leg flying across the room.

Starguard chants further, and the soft light emitting from his holy symbol pulses. The blue seems to infuse the party, a blessing putting the Star gods firmly on the side of the living. However, the spell is not enough to save Starguard from the horde of advancing zombies, who fall upon him. Starguard's cry of pain fills the small chamber as bites and slashes dig deeply, blood spilling from the cleric. He goes down, under the weight of the undead, unconcious.

Tilara swears, slashing at the zombie nearest to her as it attacks their cleric. The undead creature's flesh cracks under the attack, but it still stands.

Yuri sees Starguard falls and jumps through the trap door to protect the old man, but lands badly and twists his ankle. Swearing loudly, he pulls his rapier and prepares to defend himself.

Ash frowns, and begins to swing again - but Yuri's unexpected arrival, and the subsequent shift in position of the zombie as it descends in its assault on Starguard sends his blade cutting through air instead.

Andreth can truly feel the _ki_ flow through him now, as well as the blessings of the Stars, as a roundhouse blow knocks the head clear off one zombie, while another fist crunches the ribcage of the next.

But the zombies continue to advance, fists hammering on Yuri as he tries to dance out of their way.

Tilara swings at her target again, but misses badly. She's worried now, the things aren't stopping nearly as easily as before.

Throwing caution to the wind, Ash brings his blade up and drops it in a mighty cleaving cut that sinks deep into the back of the zombie assaulting his comrades. With a satisfied look on his face, he withdraws the stained edge and glances around, spending a precious second to determine what's needed next..

Andreth draws in his breath to focus once again, and another fierce blow sends a zombie reeling, followed speedily by a second that knocks out the last of its unlife. It sways for a moment, then topples to the ground.

Yuri strikes the zombie before him with a glancing blow, barely able to stand, too wounded to even make a snappy comeback.

Tilara slips in front of Yuri to defend him, sinking the short-spear into the undead creature and ripping it up. "Stay dead, already! Foul thing..."

Yuri limps out of the way as Tilara takes up the fight, and searches Starguard for a potion.

Ash lops off the head of the remaining thing in reach, his brief but potent sword-stroke accompanied by a groan of distaste at the demise of the abomination.

Andreth smiles as he watch Ash's sword send a head rolling, then turns toward the wall to pummel another zombie into submission - the thing staggers, but just barely stays upright, raising a rotting forearm in a feeble attempt at defense.

Yuri finds a Cure Minor potion in Starguard's robe and pours it carefully down his throat. "C'mon, old man, I'm not going to make it up that hole without you..."

Tilara sinks her shortspear into the thing as it staggers away from Andreth, finally putting it down for good. "Let's get the rest of them. There had better be a sword down here..."

Starguard blinks, waking up. "Ugh. What happened." He holds his head, looking about to see how the party is doing...

Yuri says, "We won. The others are chopping up the last of them, Stormy's still topside. Some of us are hurt, especially me."

Andreth and Ash do the mop-up, between them methodically demolishing the rest of the undead.

Tilara stays out of their way, keeping an eye on the rest of the room just in case there are any more corpses that want to join the festivities.

Starguard ohs, and quickly casts a healing spell.

After the last of the bodies has been deanimated, the party has time to look around. There's a lot of bodies here, most of them incredibly well preserved. Necromantic heaven, as it were. And underneath each row of shelves is a locked flat chest.

Yuri says, "Let's rest upstairs for a few minutes before we try anything else?"

Starguard quickly heals Yuri and himself, groaning slightly. "Anybody see a sword?"

Tilara says, "Maybe in this chest. You want to give it a shot, Yuri?"

Yuri turns to Starguard. "Actually, before we start looting this crypt, could you say a prayer for the dead?"

Starguard nods. "Perhaps we should. They should rest easy, I hope." With that, Starguard begins to chant last rites over the fallen bodies.

Yuri says, "I mean, we're here on a mission to prevent bloodshed. I don't know who these people were or what they were fighting for - it's going to be different for all of them. But we're here to protect their descendants. That should be said before we go disturbing anything else."

Yuri says, "They might... object less."

Yuri says, "Stormy? You still up there?"

Stormy leans over the entrance. "I can't get the rope tied safely. Not so I would trust it, at least. But I can hold it."

Yuri looks up, and nods. "OK, I think we'll be sending some people up in a minute."

Yuri says, "If I'm going to try opening some of these boxes, we should do it when we're not surrounded by potential zombies. So let's get everyone up the rope except me as soon as SG's done, then I'll get some of the boxes and follow you up. Be ready to haul me out in a hurry."

Tilara says, "Probably safer that way, I guess. Hang on to the rope, Stormy, and I'll come up first. If you can't hold it for me, I'll use the spider-climb and help you anchor it for Starguard."

Stormy drops the rope. "I'm using the door as a counter weight. Come on up."

Yuri nods, and looks around the barrow, the first opportunity he's had to do a real search.

Tilara scrambles up the rope and out of the lower tomb. "That was unpleasant. Zombies don't smell very good." She brushes herself off and helps Stormy hang onto the rope for the next climber.

Andreth remarks dryly, "Yer tellin' me," wiping his hands on his pants, which accomplishes little except to spread the ichor about a little.

Stormy nods, looking embarassed. "I'm sorry I didn't help."

Starguard says, "It's alright Stormy. There wasn't much room down here anyway."

The upper room becomes a little crowded, as everyone climbs up the rope.

Yuri says, "OK... we'll take chests from empty pallets, one for you, and one for me. If nothing moves, we'll take two more. Sound good?"

Andreth nods to Yuri. "So what're we here for? Starguard said somethin' about a sword..." he says, grunting a little as he heaves a chest onto his shoulder.

Yuri says, "We should be able to pass them through the hole and then climb up, even in a hurry."

Yuri says, "We need to bring back two swords from at least two different barrows to prove we can fight. It's a long story. I sort of blew it with the leader of the Foramen tribe."

Andreth lifts the chest upward beneath the hole. "Well, ya got back alive. You can't ha' blown it _too_ bad."

Tilara says, "I'd say not... but we'll see."

Yuri tugs on a chest from another stack of pallets... "Oof. Let's just stick with one for now."

The chest is pulled up, using the rope, and is soon resting on the floor in the upper room. It's a flat chest, very non-descript. A simple somewhat rusted padlock keeps it shut.

Yuri says, "OK, let's get ourselves out of here."

Starguard says, "Let's make sure we have a sword first?"

Yuri worries at the lock for some time. "These are in much better condition... than I expected..."

Gingerly, Yuri opens the chest, examining the contents carefully. Five swords lay wrapped in sheaths. Beside them, five small leather bags sit lined up.

Starguard says, "OK, grab one, and let's go to the next barrow."

Yuri says, "Stormy? Tilara? Do any of these look significant?"

Stormy leans over the chest, mumbling under his breath. He stares intently at each of the swords, and then at the five bags. Finally, defeated, he shakes his head. "These all seem like perfectly normal swords and stuff to me. No magic."

Tilara says, "Shall we see what's in the bags? Or not?"

Yuri looks disappointed. "Maybe it's because this is one of the outer barrows. Oh, well." Then he has an idea. "Can you see magic through a box? Like, if you poked your head through the trapdoor, could you see if there was anything magic down there?"

Tilara says, "Not necessarily. It can be blocked."

Yuri, still gloved, opens one of the small bags carefully.

The little bag holds a double handful of old coins, some tarnished rings, and three small gems.

Yuri says, "I think we should take a sword and one of the pouches... just because they seem to go together and we may need to prove that we were here."

Yuri says, "And taking only one will show that we're not greedy."

Starguard sighs. "Well, they did try to kill us..."

Andreth frowns at that. "Rrhrm. I guess we _have_ to take the sword, but the pouch..." He rubs his chin, and glances at Starguard.

Yuri says, "And I would like to point out that, while I'm sure they were all quite competent and noble warriors in life, we don't have a place for them in our organization at this time."

Ash nods. "Take the pouch. If we need proof, we have it. If we don't need proof, hey, we can return it without too much effort."

Yuri says, "Stormy, if you would, please have a quick look through the trap door and see if there's anything magic down there?"

Andreth stares at Yuri... then bursts out laughing. "You sure? They'd be _great_ caravan guards..." he says, grinning broadly.

Yuri says, "If we don't need proof, we can donate it to the widows and orphans fund in Thorpenhow?"

Stormy nods, and sticks his head through the trapdoor. He hangs like that for several minutes, staring intently. "I don't ... I don't think I see any auras, Yuri. I'm sorry."

Yuri tries to look shocked, but degenerates into giggling in spite of himself. "That's why we're the good guys! We'll make a place for everyone! Even the long-dead!"

Tilara rolls her eyes. "Let's not get carried away."

Yuri regains his composure. "It's OK, Stormy. We'd probably have to leave it down there, anyway. Now let's get going. Enough has been done here already."

Stormy nods. "So will we try for another outermost barrow?"

Andreth nods, and closes up the chest again. "We oughta put this back first."

Mirra sniffs disdainfully at everyone and leads the way back outside.

Yuri says, "OK. If you don't mind, Andreth, you're the only one currently strong enough to do it quickly. So you go and I'll cover you."

Andreth nods, and snags the rope and slides quickly down it, waiting for the chest to be lowered.

Tilara says, "If more of them start moving, drop the box and climb back up. It's not _that_ important."

Yuri closes and locks the chest and hands it down to Andreth.

Yuri says, "So... which one next? The one that we cut a path to, or one more difficult?"

Andreth reverentially slides the chest back into its spot. "Rest in peace," he murmurs softly before climbing up the rope again.

Starguard frowns. "The one we cut a path to. We're beat up as it is, we don't need to see the graves of the captains instead of the rank soldiers."

Yuri recovers his rope and closes the trap door.

Yuri says, "In that case, let's put the capstone back... just in case something gets restless."

Yuri inspects the one sword. "Doesn't look all that odd."

After replacing the capstone, the party is surprised that the sun is still high in the sky. It seemed so much gloomier below. As they survey the field, the party notices the flowers. Stormy turns to Starguard. "I never knew a bindweed's bloom looked like a rose ..."

Yuri says, "Starguard... are these the same blooms that were on the plants when we went in?"

Yuri says, "Hey! These are from those notes!"

Starguard says, "Notes? What notes?"

Andreth blinks. "What?" He takes a closer look at the bloom.

Tilara says, "They are. Most curious...."
