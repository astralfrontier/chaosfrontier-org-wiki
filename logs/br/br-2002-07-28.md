Game Log: Chapter 33 - Flowers Blue and Yellow


--------------------------------------------------

The intrepid party, having handily survived their encounters with a few measly skeletons and the occasional zombie, survey the barrows. The bind weed lies dormant in the morning sun; the blue and yellow flowers blooming between and over the inner barrows. One sword has been won; one sword remains.

Shall the party choose another barrow on the outer perimeter; risking little and gaining less? Or shall the party move closer to the centre, where the barrows grow larger and more forbidding, offering hopes of greater gain at the expense of only a little more risk.

What is known, now, is that the outer barrows hold the bodies of the soldiers, mere cogs in the great battle those centuries ago. Logic suggests, then, that the larger barrows hold the captains and perhaps even the very mages that fought that mighty fight.

Yuri hmms...

Stormy surveys the bindweed field, his hands stretched in front of him. His knuckles crack, one after the after. "If the layout is similar, maybe we can plan better? Half of us couldn't reach the combat."

Ash coughs a little, during deliberations. "Eh, Starguard.. it's not going to really upset the dead to take away some of the stuff they have in the tombs is it? I mean, they were up and walking before we laid a finger on anything.."

Yuri says, "That's some good thinking... if the outer barrows are all arrange the same, maybe if we open the door and wait for the enemy to come to us, we'll have more flexibility."

Andreth raises an eyebrow at Ash, then shrugs. "It's been a long time... for 'em."

Yuri says, "Notice how there's fewer bodies inside the inner ring? Wonder what that could mean."

Ash blinks a little. "Those right there aren't walking much. Fewer of them, over in that direction --" He points, indicating the inner ring. "-- but maybe fewer braved that area."

Starguard considers. "True. And they aren't exactly going to have any use for it now. I guess taking the gold and the like...I still don't particularly like it." He pauses, looking at the inner ring, up the hill. "Hey. Flowers. Yellow and blue flowers."

Tilara says, "And they're roses, too. Unusual on bindweed. Think it's trying to tell us something?"

Yuri says, "Well, roses have thorns..."

Yuri says, "You know... I've been thinking... there are some parts of this that seem damned contrived."

Yuri says, "I mean, these fields... they look like they're being deliberately maintained, somehow. And ol' Grik and his bone armor... how powerful a necromancer do you suppose you have to be to maintain something like this?"

Andreth eyes one of the inner barrows speculatively. "I could clear the way to one of them no trouble..."

Tilara glances briefly skyward. "Like the Gods are playing games, perhaps? Or maybe they're just trying to lead us on."

Yuri says, "We know that the Foramen were the ancient servants of a wizard. I wonder if this is part of his mission."

Starguard notices the curiousity as the party looks inwards, remembering cards. "I think that we might want to head inwards."

Yuri says, "Yeah... we know we can survive the outer ring... we might learn something new there."

Yuri examines the card from the Monastery. "You mean these? The one in mine is green-yellow."

Stormy looks inwards. "Why don't we forge a path to the inner circle. Perhaps we'll know more when we get closer?"

Tilara says, "Let's be careful, though. We didn't get chewed up too badly on the first ring, but we're way down on healing now."

Starguard nods. "One blue one, and four green-yellow. And Betsy & co. took one egg, and left four. Perhaps a blue tomb?"

"How many healing potions do we have left, Yuri?" Stormy grins. "I don't have any, but perhaps we can save those for a last resort. And Brother Starguard knows how to make more."

Andreth pipes up. "I've got a potion left, if we need it."

Yuri says, "I'm... not sure. I think all we have right now are the Cure Minors that Starguard made."

Yuri says, "Andreth, if you would, I think we need you to play reaper again."

Andreth nods, borrowing Ash's sword to cut a swathe through the tangles fo weed.

Yuri says, "What was the marking on this tomb here? Four? And what was marked on the other one?"

Andreth looks up, a little sheepishly. "Didn't look."

Tilara snorts. "I'll go look at it."

Tilara returns shortly after trotting over to the other first-ring barrow. "Seven vertical stripes marked on that one."

After a brief discussion, curiousity about the flowers overrides the convience of the already cut path, and Andreth proceeds towards the nearest yellow-flowered barrow.

Yuri says, "Hey, SG, is there some way you can... you know... provoke an undead?"

The inner barrows stand longer, and wider, and are covered with blooming bindweed. As Andreth moves closer, he sees that the door, for lack of a better word, is once again a slab of stone. It looks a little thicker than the slab on the outer barrow, but still manageable with a little effort. And there are only two scratches on the outside, arranged in an X.

Starguard says, "I don't think provoking them will be the problem. Getting them out into the sunlight might be, but..."

Yuri says, "Well, like Stormy says, we all want to be able to hit them..."

Yuri says, "That's easiest if the come outside."

Andreth takes the edge of the door in hand. "Get ready, folks..."

Starguard says, "Quite frankly, giving them a good look at you then running away slowly should work unless they're controlled, and the outer ones didn't seem to be."

Yuri says, "Oh, well. Let's get the door off, then. If they're shy that won't be as big a problem."

Tilara murmurs, "... although it'd be nice if they couldn't all hit us at the same time..."

Starguard says, "The barrow is larger, this time. And walls for the undead to cower against is a good thing..."

Starguard pauses, looking over at Stormy, who has fire-breathing potion in hand. "Perhaps that might not be the best choice of weapon against things with only bones, and in enclosed spaces with us."

Yuri stands with his rapier drawn, waiting for Andreth to get the tomb open.

Pulling on the slab, Andreth slowly pulls the slab towards him, taking advantage of the angle at which the slab is set into the ground. The slab pulls loose very slowly, roots and flowers spilling on Andreth.

Starguard moves behind Ash, having learned his lesson the first time.

As the slab finally falls to the side, skeletons lurch out into the sun, shambling towards Andreth.

Ash grips the hilt of his great blade, ready for anything.

Starguard quickly calls upon the power of the stars, and holy light spreads from his holy symbol, the skeletons turning into dust, the sound of something in retreat heard from within.

Ash advances, sword held out and eyes narrowed for the first sign of danger.

Tilara follows, ready to flame any zombies that get past Ash's sword.

Moving cautiously down the ramp into the vestibule, Ash holds his greatsword firmly. By the light that filters through the doorway, he sees he's in a larger room than before, stretching further in borth directions than the barrow suggested. And against the far wall, two zombies stand pressed into the wall.

Ash moves closer, keeping eyes open from floor to ceiling and peering around constantly as he advances toward the foul creatures.

Tilara readies her short-spear. "Looks like they're not going to be much of a problem."

Yuri lights a candle and walks into the barrow.

Tilara follows Ash in, and Yuri is right behind her. The two zombies remaining are still cowering against the walls of the barrow, and the three rip into them with sword and spear. Soon enough, the undead are put to rest and Tilara steps back to the doorway to wave the others forward.

Yuri holds the candle up over his head, surveying the room more carefully now that its inhabitants have been quietened. The room is twice as long as it is deep, and there are three doors - not counting the front door. There are shelves on the wall, containing dessicated piles of what may once have been food. Or material. Or material wrapped around food. The door, straight ahead, is large, and made of stone, with shining yellow ornamentation.

Starguard follows into the antechamber, looking around in the gloom. "Charming. Reminds me of some inns I've been in."

Yuri lets out a low whistle. "Wow... this one's a lot bigger..."

Yuri says, "Til... Stormy... anything magic in here?"

The other two doors, one at each long end of the room, are similarly made of stone, with what looks like ornamentation. but exactly what kind of ornamentation is hard to tell, given the tarnish.

All three doors are set into lintels in the ground, and all are slightly angled. And the two smaller doors appear to have keyholes.

Stormy carefully steps inside, and begins to chant ...

Stormy looks around carefully. "Those doors ... they glow a little. But it's not coming from the door." He looks around again. "And here ... in the centre of the room. Something ..."

Stormy pauses, staring intently at the ground. "Tilara ... there's a glow coming out of the earth here. I've never seen that before."

Tilara casts her own cantrip, curious as to exactly what it is that Stormy is looking at. "Interesting..."

Yuri says, "Can this place... really be this big?"

Yuri says, "It looked smaller from outside."

Andreth looks down at the ground. "Comin' from the ground? Or maybe under it?"

Starguard says, "What's it like, Til? I'd rather not cast myself."

Yuri puts on his gloves and uses a dagger to poke at the bundles on the wall.

As Yuri pokes the first bundle cautiously, it disintegrates, spilling a handful of dried wheat onto the floor.

Tilara says, "It's some kind of protective spell. And it really does seem to be coming from the ground itself." She traces out the location with the tip of her spear.

Starguard says, "Food for the trip, so to speak. These are old graves..."

Yuri has a look at the doors.

Checking each of the doors carefully, Yuri looks thoughtful. The central door looks more complicated. No obvious lock, to begin with. But this ornamentation seems evocative. Shrugging, he moves to the smaller doors. Both have a lock. Each of the locks is trapped, but the traps appear fairly simple to disable. On the two smaller doors, there's a simple needle trap, set to go off should anyone attempt to pick the lock.

Andreth scratches his head, peering at the door. "Gold... hasta be. And what's it say? I can't read that..."

Yuri says, "Yes, it is gold. Nobody's been in here in a long time; that's all food on the shelves... very dried... and there's spider webs on the locks."

Yuri says, "Maybe the keys are under the floor?"

Yuri tries to read the writing on the wall.

Tilara says, "If so, I have no idea where. I suppose they might be buried here where the protection spell is, but... I don't know if the spell is protecting against good or evil or what."

Yuri says, "Protection From People Just Like Us, more than likely."

Yuri holds the candle closer to the golden rune, trying to decipher them. He moves closer, staring intently until his eyes water, but the meanings elude him. Still, the letters are arranged in an interesting way. Four sentences - for lack of a better way - each formed as a circle; the four circles making an arch on the door. And then a single word, underneath the arch.

Stormy squats down by Tilara's spear point, looking at the ground and biting his lip ...

Yuri shakes his head. "No idea. Maybe we should try digging."

Yuri says, "Stormy... where was the magic on that door again? Behind it? In it?"

Tilara says, "We do have that Comprehend Languages spell. Shall we use it on this?"

Stormy bites his lip. "It's like the aura here, Yuri. It's vague, but ... Tilara, could that be because the door is in the way? or it could be the door. I can't tell."

Yuri says, "Up to you, I guess. It seems as good a time as any."

Tilara says, "The spells are old. I'm not sure myself, Stormy. Something behind the door could do that, certainly."

Yuri digs gently at the spot Tilara has outlined.

Digging carefully, Yuri loosens the dirt. Less than a foot down, he finds a small leather pouch. It already begins to collapse as he touches it.

Yuri says, "Oh, man... this one's really old..."

Yuri spreads a handkerchief out and dissects the small pouch on it.

Yuri says, "I don't think anyone's been in here since the place was built. Unless Grikurgra's deliberately resetting the tombs after people enter them."

Tilara says, "I doubt he's bright enough. And these spells are _old_."

Andreth says, "What, putting the cobwebs back?"

Nestled inside the deteriating pouch is a red stone, cut to be almost round, with six eight sided faces, eight six sided faces, and twelve square faces ...

Starguard says, "It's not like there's a lot of clerics out raiding tombs, you know."

Yuri says, "Oh, wow... guys... take a look at this..."

Yuri says, "I wonder... could it be the key?"

Tilara nods. "That's it. The protective spell's centered on it."

Andreth looks over Yuri's shoulder. "Funny thing..."

Yuri says, "Tilara... please read the door? This is intriguing. Whatever is down here isn't just the remains of footmen."

[Animated picture of the stone](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~morey/rtcubocta.html)

Tilara nods and pulls the scroll out of its case. "I think that might just be a good idea." She looks over it, then starts into the spell, speaking harsh syllables that one cannot quite recall.

Yuri gets out a scroll and a quill and gets ready to transcribe.

Yuri mutters, "Someone needs to invent a word for going into old tombs, discovering old secrets, and getting attacked by undead... somehow I expected more blood and less ink to be shed on this expedition.."

Starguard says, "I believe the term is 'suicidal', Yuri."

As the spell slides off the scroll, the words embossed in the door begin to make sense to Tilara. She begins to speak, pointing at each of the circles in turn. "_The fires burn in eternal flame._ That's the first one. Then _The frozen waters flood the land._ And here _The damp earth is the tomb of all that was._" She turns to the last circle. "_The air resonates with the sound of thunder._" She looks down a little. "The last word is a single word, but it doesn't translate directly. The flavour of its meaning is _The thousand stories that have gone before will become the thousand stories still to be._"

Yuri hmms. "The four elements..."

Yuri says, "All that, in one word? That's... how is it pronounced?"

Starguard says, "...again. I'm beginning to suspect the Gods are busy..."

Tilara chuckles. "I'm translating it, Yuri. I can't speak it." She turns her attention to the next door.

Tilara turns to the leftmost door. The metal is tarnished, and far harder to read; entire words have faded away. "_Four ... riding, riding, ... the ... inn door ..._ " The rest is illegible. She moves to the far side where the moisture content must have been less. More of the words are still legible. "_Hallow's Eve ... Hallow's Night ... Blessing ..._ " Or perhaps not. But the second sentence is still legible. "_These our friends in safety keep._"

Yuri slips the stone into his pocket. "Right... well, I guess I better get cracking. Or picking."

Stormy nods. "Can we help, Yuri?"

Yuri says, "Just be ready when the door opens, Stormy. Or in case I accidentally get stabbed."

Bending over the lock, Yuri carefully inserts the tip of his dagger into the hole from which the needle ordinarily exits. Then carefully triggering the trap, he traps the needle, keeping the trap from resetting. Finally, carefully, he replaces his dagger with a small piece of leather. Enough to keep everything jammed. And now for the lock itself ... which seems to be a little trickier.

Yuri grumbles softly. "I got the trap, but the lock is old. Sorry, friends, this is going to take a few minutes to pick."

Working a little harder now, Yuri wiggles the lockpicks around until he finally hears the **click** he's been waiting for. And not a single _snickt_.

Yuri says, "That's it. Get ready."

Tilara ponders the writing on the doors while Yuri fiddles with the lock. She's not really any closer to understanding what it means, though, when he succeeds in opening the door.

Yuri pulls the door up and outwards. It opens into the room. Beyond is a steep ramp leading into a room that looks as big again as this one. Looking in, Yuri can see four pallets ... and movement.

Yuri says, "Form a ring around the door... let them come to us."

As the party forms up around the door, two shapes move forward. The stench is night unbearable; the odours of rotting flesh and oozing ichor filling the air. The larger of the two appears in the doorway. _Cursed ... cursed ..._ Tilara alone can make out what the man is crying.

Andreth lets the apparition lurch into the room, then swings a fist at it. It sways out of the way, and swings a clawed hand at Andreth, who easily avoids the creature's blow as well.

Ash takes the opportunity to dig the edge of his two-hander deep into the creature attacking Andreth, a fierce grin on his face.

Tilara swears as the creatures lurch out of the room too quickly for her to burn them. She strikes out at the one that attacks her protege, but misses.

Yuri scores a glancing blow on the first creature, since it's occupied with Andreth.

The smaller shape reaches out for Stormy where he stands, frozen in fear. A claw falls down his face as Stormy looks into the face of what was ... once ... a boy just like him?

Starguard calls forth his holy power, the faint blue light coming forth strongly. The undead flich at the power, retreating back into the crypt.

Yuri says, "Stormy! Are you OK?"

Stormy looks at the doorway, eyes huge, face pale, body trembling.

Andreth smiles grimly as the shambling creatures retreat into their lair, and follows after. But even as the creature cowers away from the holy man, it can still manage to dodge out of the way of his blows. Grumbling, he backs away again.

Yuri kneels next to Stormy... "Stormy... this is Yuri... Starguard's got them on the run... say something..."

Stormy looks up at Yuri; his eyes slowly focusing in on Yuri's face. "That boy ... "

Tilara says, "I'm pretty sure one of the things touched him, Yuri. Try to snap him out of it."

Yuri says, "Stormy, listen. I know. Terrible things happened here. But the rest of us are still alive, and we have to do what we can when we have the chance."

Stormy shakes his head, slowly, visibly, shaking off a fearful paralysis. "He just reminded me of me, Yuri. He must have been a squire ... and it felt as though he'd been buried alive. I didn't know the dead could transmit memories."

Yuri sighs. "I didn't know that either, until now. Sit here with Starguard and take it easy for a few minutes."

Yuri goes to help his other comrades in the next room.

Tilara waits at the doorway, ready to guard the entrance or flame the undead if something goes wrong. When the two creatures are destroyed and their moaning wails of 'Cursed!' are stilled, she sighs. "I hope this finally frees you."

Yuri says, "What was that, Til?"

Andreth's fists fly wildly but this undead seems to be more nimble than the ones before. He concentrates and swings slowly but methodically, two more solid blows finally sending the poor thing to his rest.

This room, hollowed out of the ground, holds four pallets. Two were once the homes of those poor benighted souls that have now been killed. The other two hold corpses that have long since rotted away, leaving only skeletons behind. Remarkably inanimate skeletons, mind you. A point that is carefully confirmed. Held in the hands of the skeletons are two rusty, damaged swords, carefully clasped in skeletal hands. One other sword lies abandoned on the ground. Shields stand at the foot of each bed; each carries still the stylized image of a running horse.

Starguard quickly moves to Stormy's side, looking into his eyes. "Stormy? Are you alirght?"

Stormy nods his head. "Yes. Yes. I'm fine. I'm sorry; I didn't mean to let you down."

Tilara turns back to sit beside Stormy. "Not your fault it touched you. Could've happened to any of us, and the important thing is that you kept it away from Starguard so we could deal with them."

Stormy nods, once. "Right."

Yuri says, "Starguard... perhaps a short mass for the dead, before we... borrow... this sword?"

Starguard nods. "By the stars above, rest now in peace, and mayyour journey end. Amen."

Yuri fingers the gem in his pocket, then picks up the sword.

The sword is a little sticky, but the slime can easily be removed. What's left is a well balanced short sword in remarkably good condition.

Yuri makes sure his gloves aren't melting off, then examines the sword for markings.

The sword appears to be unmarked. There is a single small gem in the pommel.

Yuri pauses to make a sketch of the mystery word over the central door. _Someone will know what it means... maybe Tormel..._

Tilara stares at the inscription on the center door until the magic begins to fade. "Eternal flame ... frozen water flooding the land, that's got to mean winter ... damp earth, that sounds like a tomb or barrow... and thunder..."

Yuri says, "Year? Seasons?"

Yuri says, "Or destiny? Or history?"

Starguard says, "I think we need to come back here sooner or later."

Yuri says, "It seems to be a word that means both destiny and history... the door probably wants that word to open. Maybe if we knew what it was."

Yuri says, "Yeah... but I guess the point is, we should be going now."

Stormy shakes his head, and moves to the entrance of the barrow. Outside, he stands soaking up the sun.

Tilara says, "Let's copy down the letters, then. Maybe our friends back at the monastery can sort it out later."

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "I think Stormy needs some help. He took that pretty bad."

Starguard says, "Let me look at that scratch, Stormy. Don't want it to get infected."

Starguard smiles. "Looks alright. It should heal on it's own."

Yuri says, "Ash... maybe you should assume the lead for now. I irritated Grikurgrah pretty bad. If you 'depose' me he may have more respect for you."

Ash shrugs a little. "If you like."

After Andreth carefully wrestles the slab back into place, the party gingerly makes its way back to where Grargh is waiting with the wolves. He greets them, counts the swords, and then leads them back to the encampment. In the late morning a few women are outside the women's tent, working on food over the fire. Two others are slowly scraping hides. Grikugrah himself is working on a small piece of wood, carving him.

After Grargh comes to attention in front of him, Grikugrah looks up. Grargh nods. Grikugrah turns to the party, and looks them over slowly.

Ash frowns a bit, stares at the \`tough guy' for a few seconds, then swivels his head a bit and speaks one word: "Swords." He points in front of his feet, indicating where he wishes them placed. Then his hard, cold gaze returns to the chieftain. "You didn't like how Yuri spoke," he explains, "so now I'm talkin'."

Grikugrah nods. "You have earned right to speak. Speak."

Ash says, "We want the changers - the hawkmen, the wolfmen. Either we talk or we fight them. We know you know them." What else needs to be said? A simple statement of intent. No threats; no posturing. The ichor on clothes and weapons is testament to the challenge the party faced already.

Grikugrah nods, waving at one of his foramen guards. The man disappears into Grikugrah's tent, and returns with a man. He smiles at Grikugrah. "You have summoned me?"

Grikugrah waves at Ash. "He want speak. You speak."

Yuri scowls, but says nothing. _Dammit. I knew it. I just **knew** it. They're not going to make anything easy._

The man watches Ash, arms folded over his chest. He stands an imposing six feet, thick brows over dark eyes, long brown hair flowing down his back with a single feather braided in.

Ash blinks once, then shrugs a bit. "You're one of the Changers. If not, you're worthless to us. We want to talk. We know there's something you want. We want to hear what it is."

The man shrugs. "We desire nothing. We are merely mercenaries, working for Grikugrah."

The man smiles. "Perhaps, you might say, we desire coin."

Ash scowls. "Hawks do not eat children, and children don't carry enough to make it worthwhile."

The man tilts his head. "Perhaps, you might say, you are speaking to the wrong person."

Ash shrugs again, starting to feel a little out of his depth. A suspicion. Do the hawkmen and wolfmen work together, or apart?

Yuri can't hold his tongue any longer. "Then where can we find the right person? Where is she? Who is Samaela?"

The man starts, turning to face Yuri. Then he straightens. "Grikugrah is our employer. We bring the children to him."

Ash says, "Do the hawkmen and wolfmen work together, or apart?"

The man smiles bleakly. "We work at our employer's direction. Grikugrah has hired both myself and Tiornel. You would undoubtedly refer to him as a wolfman."

Yuri says, "Ash, this man is concealing facts from you. And us."

Ash's face darkens. "Fine. How many more swords will it take for you to give us a straight answer? What the hell are you afraid of? If you're just mercenaries who want to get paid, that's fine, but we jumped through your damn hoops and you two are going to come clean right the hell now!"

The man smiles. "I come as ... clean, I believe you call it? I come as clean as I can. I work for Grikugrah. I find children for him. Tiornel hunts for him. They are good contracts."

Grikugrah grunts his assent. "Good men."

Ash hehs. "Okay. So why do you want children?" This question is distracted at Grikugrah.

Grikugrah smiles. "My tribe is small. My tribe will grow. And we will regain what our Master promised us."

Yuri mutters to Ash... "Their Master... the founder of Thorpenhow. Centuries dead."
