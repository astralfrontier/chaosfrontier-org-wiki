Game Log: Chapter 30 - Ambush on Ambush


-------------------------------------------

After greeting the party, with the Syndic children all around him, Fenton Greer invites everyone to sit down a for quick bite of elevenses before going on. Fenton Greer slowly smokes his pipe, obviously mulling things over. As he blows a smoke ring, a young well muscled man strides into the long room. "Campsite's still as empty as ever, Grampaw." Fenton nods. "Yon's Piers, back from the campsite. Now mind, Piers, answer their questions sharpish, lad."

Starguard says, "Have you heard much south of you, Piers? We know the ambush is somewhere, but it'd be nice to know exactly where...."

Piers shakes his head. "Naw. We don't hold with the Nickton's much, eh, Grampaw?" Fenton shakes his head once, decisively. "But ah checked both campsites; took the dogs out for a nice run. They're outside, Grampaw." Piers pauses, as Fenton glares at him, and mutters something about answering sharpish. "North campsite's undisturbed; there's new tracks at th'other one. Big hairy feet, mostly."

Tilara says, "Hairy feet? Any idea what that might be?"

Yuri says, "More like animal, or more like people?"

Piers shakes his head. "Naw; we sees the tracks sometimes, but haint never seen the critters as makes 'em." Fenton blows a smoke ring. "Legend has, lad, that once upon a time when the forest stretched from the mountain ta the mountain, there were great humans that lived in the trees ..." Piers shrugs. "All I knows is they looked like big bare feet, and there was a couple hairs stuck in one of em."

Starguard says, "The south camp, hmm? Which way to it?"

Tilara nods. "We'd like to ask you about the sorceror's death, as well. Where did that happen?"

Piers turns to Starguard. "Went cross country, sir. Yer better off goin' back t'main road, and takin' the track. Easier ta find." Then he turns to Tilara, blushing a little. "Happened in north camp, missus. Great fireworks and all. And then the lady Major's son, all torn up like. We barely recognized him."

Yuri says, "Have you seen any strange birds?"

Piers grins. "Aye. Fair huge wing, we found. All charred. We're going to take crossbows with us for the wolf hunt; mebbe we'll snag us a bird or two." He bites his lip. "But we've only seen the dead un, fer sure."

Tilara says, "There have been reports all along the road of such things. Be wary."

Yuri hmms. "They're awfully careful about being seen."

Yuri says, "Maybe we should get going. I'm sure that if nothing else, someone's going to take an interest in us."

Piers grins widely. "Aye. We'll keep a grande watch for 'em. Maw's promised ta stuff em and serve up a right royal feast."

Yuri winces, but says nothing.

Starguard nods. "We wouldn't want to keep them waiting, would we?"

Karlsefnir and the other Andvarris merely finish eating, enjoying the elevenses profusely.

Yuri thinks, _At least we're not going hungry for this part..._

After thanking the Greer's for their kind hospitality, the party resumes their trek down the path, reaching the main road after an hour of so of marching fairly quickly. Already the sun is past it's zenith, and time seems to be flying by. So, heading back towards Thorpenhow and the campsite where Kiern died, the party walks a little faster.

The sun is beginning to dry the roads out, which helps. And by late afternoon the party reaches the track leading to the campsite. Karlsefnir pauses, sniffing the air. "Bad storm coming," he warns Stormy, in A-isian. Stormy politely relays the information.

Yuri looks up at the sky for a moment. _Do they mean the weather is going to change?_

Starguard notices the path leading off to the campsire. "Andreth, would you come over here for a minute? I want to try something."

Andreth steps up to Starguard, nodding.

Starguard grasps the twinned stars of his holy symbol and mumbles a prayer to the Gods, eyes closed for a moment as his hands glow with a dark red of power. As he touches Andreth's shoulder, the power floods into him, to his muscles, reenforcing them with divine might.

Andreth's eyes go wide as he feels the surge of divine energy flow through him.

The party regroups, crossbows at the ready, and sets off down the path towards the campsite. The road is narrower here, but still easily wide enough to walk two abreast. And on both sides of the road the grasses grow tall. As do the shrubs.

Ash coughs loudly and slows down, turning his head and peering ...

Yuri notices something off the side of the road and quietly stops, pointing his crossbow at it. He takes a moment to tap the nearest Andvari on the shoulder, so the people ahead have some idea what's going on.

Karlsefnir, next to Ash, pauses to, his javelin held loosely in his hand, as he peers into the bushes. Arnlaug, alerted by Yuri, also stares intently ... But whatever it was, if it was there, seems to have frozen.

Tilara takes a quick glance where Yuri is looking, then continues looking around the rest of the area. _Don't want to be distracted by bait, after all..._

Andreth is a bit far back to see what the vanguard is staring at, but he is watching the grasses on either side. _Prime territory for an ambush, this is..._ He falls in a little closer behind Starguard.

As the minutes pass, the tableau remains frozen ...

Yuri holds out one hand parallel to the ground and makes a soft patting motion. _Get down..._, and then creeps forward towards the place where he saw the movement.

Ash hunkers down, crossbow at the ready. His hands twitch, ready and willing to draw real steel instead, but he follows the gesture's command.

The Andvarri hunker down, and Stormy follows their lead. As Yuri moves forward, quietly, he feels ... watched.

Starguard's crossbow is ready, him mind racing over spells...

And then the grasses move, just for a moment, as though a breeze had blown away from Yuri.

Yuri checks behind himself for a moment, and up. _It could be a trap..._

Ash glances back at Yuri, then jerks a thumb to himself and points forward.

Yuri nods to Ash, and points to Arnlaug, and then waves him towards Ash.

Arnlaug moves forward, so that he's even with Ash, while Karlsefnir moves closer to the grasses on the same side Yuri's on.

Starguard murmurs, as quitely as he can, mumbling a prayer to the Stars, as divine energy swirls, collecting into a compact ball, his hands around his holy stars as the magical sparkles solidify into a star-furred badger.

Starguard smiles at the little badger, and with a hand, motions him forward to investigate the tall grass.

A massive wolf seems to rise from the grasses as the badger, his lips pulled back in a silent snarl, as he turns rapidly, and runs into the fields.

Yuri says, "Wait! We don't have to fight! Why are you attacking us?"

The Andvarri hold their fire, watching the wolf run away. After a few moments the wolf fades into the tall grasses, hidden once more.

Yuri says, "Dammit! Let's follow it."

Stormy nods, ready to follow Yuri. "Yes! I can burn it, and freeze it, and ... and ... and whack it with my staff!"

Yuri murmurs to Karlsefnir, in A-isian, "So much for parley..."

Starguard says, "Easy Stormy. We're here to end the problem, not kill things."

Karlsefnir nods. "Waist high; wolves not grow that big." He looks around, sniffing the air. "Bad storm."

Yuri says, "In the air, or on the ground?"

Yuri says, "Anyone know how to track a wolf?"

Karlsefnir shakes his head. "In ... in spirit."

Andreth frowns. "Doubt we'll get very far talkin' to 'em, Starguard. Last wolves that attacked us weren't big on talkin', y'know."

Yuri says, "OK. Let's follow it. They know we're here; that's not a surprise. Let's see if we can find them before they have a chance to do something about it."

Starguard nods. "Those were those wolves. I'd rather not get attacked if possible. Even if they are wolves. And I might be able to follow. Put that fellow looked about half-ghost."

Tilara glances at Starguard, not sure if he's joking or not.

Andreth nods mutely to both Yuri and Starguard. "Let's go."

Yuri looks over at the badger. "Well, so does... that. Let him lead the way?"

Starguard shakes his head as the badger returns to the ether. "I'm afraid I can hold him here for long. Only a couple of minutes."

Yuri says, "Then I'll do it. I'm quieter, anyway."

Yuri waits a moment for objections, then moves up and tries to follow the trail left by the wolf.

Ash surrenders his lead position to Yuri, fingers tensely gripping the butt of his crossbow.

Yuri moves into the grasses. At first the trail is fairly obvious; it looks as though the wolf spent some time lying here. And then he jumped off, and ... obviously he raced off in that direction. Yuri heads deeper into the grasses, bent over to peer at the ground.

Ash will move to stand next to Yuri, ready to body-block in case something unexpected springs out..

Moving further into the grasses, Yuri slowly covers those first feet that the wolf covered so quickly. And then the land sinks into a slight dell; no wonder the wolf disappeared from view. And the tracks ... Yuri pauses. The tracks seem to have gone.

Yuri looks up. _What if the wolves can turn into hawks?_

Ash glances around, but still peers down from time to time - watching Yuri at work, though his attention would be properly focused elsewhere.

The tracks are more confusing, here. Almost as though there were two? Or ... As Yuri bends over, more closely, to look at a broken stem of grass, he hears a snarl. A dark form jumps over him, leaping at Ash.

Andreth leaps forward as soon as he sees the wolf emerge from the grasses, but Yuri and Ash have gone a fair distance ahead... _Please let me get there in time..._, he thinks to himself.

Ash gives a hoarse yell and brings his arm up to cover himself - the action is enough to bring his finger down on the trigger, and a crossbow bolt goes sailing off into the distance. The gesture, however, is enough to bump the wolf on the nose as its snout reaches for something to grab hold of..

Tilara hurries after Andreth, her crossbow at the ready and Mirra hissing from her shoulder.

Stormy goes pale, but races after Andreth and Tilara.

The wolf twists, mid air, landing on Ash's shoulders, and bearing him to the ground.

Starguard joins the charge into the grass, as Ash crashes under the wolf's great weight, worried now...

As Ash lies prone, the wolf worries at his shoulder, teeth sinking into the armour, and blood rapidly seeping into the grasses.

Yuri straightens up, seeing the wolf flying overhead and landing on Ash. "Dammit!" He turns, his finger pulling on the trigger, and a crossbow bolt sinks into the wolf's hide. Small lightning bolts arc along it's edge, and you can hear the smell of charred skin.

The Andvarri charge, following Andreth, and pause, facing back towards the path.

Andreth checks his pace as he approaches the field of battle, and unleashes a kick at the wolf's side, powered by the force of the Stars, which sends it howling.

Ash crawls away from the ground, leaving a red stain, and limps sorely away to catch his breath for a moment..

Tilara swears as the wolf leaps on Ash and the others rush in. She drops her crossbow in favor of the shortspear slung on her back as she runs in. _I'd more likely hit one of us than the wolf._

Stormy, looking very worried now, runs after Tilara, but then visibly changes his mind, and stops where he stands between the wolf and Ash.

Starguard's arms rise to the heaven, chanting covering the battlefield. "May the Stars guide us today, aid our hands in this battle, and fill our hearts with courage!" His words have a magical effect as his blessing affects the White Company and Andvarri, helping them.

The wolf, looking around, backs away from Andreth, past Yuri, and runs away at a full run.

Yuri finds himself with no ready weapon as the wolf runs past, so he just shouts and punches it in the flank.

Andreth catches the wolf with a fist of his own as it staggers away from Yuri's blow.

Yuri hastily loads a normal bolt into his crossbow, and fumbles the actual shot, letting it fly before it's even pointing at the retreating wolf.

The Andvarri advance cautiously, Arnlaug and Thord now both watching the road, as the wolf runs.

Andreth, seeing that the wolf is running far too fast for him to catch, stops to pull the crossbow from his back and takes a shot. He hears, in the distance, the howl as the bolt strikes home.

Tilara takes a swing at the wolf as it withdraws, but misses. She growls again and tries to switch back to her crossbow as it runs away, before realizing that she dropped it. She sighs as the creature runs, already beyond her spell range, then grins happily as Ash brings it down.

Starguard glances back towards the Andvarri and the road, eyebrows raised. "What's wrong?" he calls, hoping the tone of his voice will convey the question.

Ash lowers the crossbow to his side, his blood running freely over the wooden stock as he spits and glowers. "An eye for an eye," he murmurs.

Yuri hears Stormy's call. "Stormy? What's going on?"

The Andvarri keep glancing at the road, and the sky, and the grass, in a continuous circuit.

Andreth casually pulls on the cocking lever, mildly bemused by how much easier it is for the nonce. "One down, gods know how many to go..." He looks up at Stormy, then at the Andvarri.

Stormy shakes his head. "Nothing, now, I think. The wolf's down."

Karlsefnir taps on Starguard's shoulder, then points directly at Ash. Specifically, at his very chewed up shoulder.

Starguard moves over to Ash. "Here, let me see that wound. You're pretty chewed up."

Yuri murmurs to Karlsefnir, "What are you looking at, that way?", and motions over at the road.

Ash ignores Starguard's comment, and is walking off in the direction of the downed wolf. His crossbow is tossed lightly aside.

Karlsefnir chews his lower lip, seemingly looking for the right phrase. Then he points forward. "Ambush." He swings back again. "Ambush."

Yuri says, "Andreth, keep an eye on Starguard and Ash. This may not be over yet."

Starguard frowns. "Alright..."

Andreth sets the safety catch, then drops another bolt into the groove, following behind Ash. "Oi, stay with us..." he murmurs quietly.

Yuri says to Karlsefnir, "Let's get everybody close together, and watch... in several directions."

Ash continues his leisurely pace, unslinging the massive blade he carries on his back and cradling it like a child in the crook of his uninjured arm.

Stormy, looking worried, picks up Ash's crossbow, and follows him. They find the wolf lying on the ground, both arrows still stuck in its hide. A slim spiral of smoke hangs in the air for a few moments, and then fades away.

Yuri says, "Tilara, Stormy, let's give Starguard some cover while they're patching up Ash."

Karlsefnir, watching the party separate, shrugs. He motions the other Andvarri to stay with Yuri, and keeps an eye open.

Starguard'll stay with the Andvarri.

Tilara nods, running back to retrieve her crossbow and checking that it's undamaged as she rejoins the group. "You heard the man, Mirra. Let's keep our eyes open."

Yuri says loud enough for those near him to hear, "Karlsefnir thinks there's an ambush waiting for us. Let's look sharp and stay close."

The wolf lies, prone, on the ground, its blue eyes open and broken, gazing sightlessly at the sky. One paw lies folded under, the others are at full stretch. The pelt is thick, and would make a wonderful winterfur, were it not for the burn marks.

Andreth looks down at the scorched corpse, then back at Ash. "You see? It's dead. Now come _on_... we don't want to split up like this."

Andreth adds, "Besides, you need Brother Starguard to look at them bites of yours."

Ash looks down for several seconds at the animal before him on the ground, lost in thought. At length he steadies his blade in both hands, and brings it down in a vicious beheading stroke.

The head separates easily from the body, and more blood flows sluggishly from the stump.

Tilara raises an eyebrow at that. "If you need to talk about it, Ash... We're all here for you."

Ash reaches down with his blood-stained hand and retrieves the head, then begins .. strolling.. back towards the group, a low and tuneless whistle coming through parched lips.

Yuri thinks, _Oh, man. He's taking this really personally._

Andreth looks at the grim trophy, and shakes his head quietly, but says nothing about it, instead following behind.

Ash finally takes heed of the priest. "Fix me up?" he murmurs distractedly at Starguard, offering his pale arm.

The Andvarri watch Ash return, holding the trophy, and smile. Arnlaug holds up a skinning knife, and makes motions suggesting he's offering to skin the wolf.

Ash only nods in response, tilting his head back in the direction of the corpse.

Starguard blinks, but goes about his job quietly. He's seen stranger things in battle. He murmurs a healing prayer, calling forth a blue healing light...

Yuri sees that everyone's going to be busy... "Stormy, stay here, and watch in that direction. Tilara, how about you watch that way, and I'll keep my eyes on the trail back to the road. It looks like we're going to be a moment."

Arnlaug, with Thord in tow, heads for the wolf. He straightens out the corpse, effortlessly, and slits it from neck to navel. A few more cuts, and with Thord's help the fur is peeled right off the now bloody carcass. Overhead carrion crows have begun to circle.

Carefully folding the pelt, Arnlaug carries it back to Ash, presenting it with a bow. The pelt is still very rough, and needs to be cleaned, and dried, and tanned. Preferably within the next 24 hours. Thord pauses for a moment at the wolf's side, before carving out the liver. He offers Ash a slice.

Ash shakes his head at the liver and nods at the pelt.

Andreth quirks an eyebrow at this, smiling a little despite himself. "I guess they like the way you think, Ash."

Thord nods, as Arnlaug places the pelt at Ash's feet. The liver is flung aside into the grasses. Karlsefnir turns to Yuri. "Wolf not worthy opponent?"

Ash glances silently up and over at Andreth, eyes half-unfocused.

Yuri hmms, and replies to Thord, "Worthy enough, but I think it's not our way."

Stormy watches, wide-eyed, but moves to stand closer to Tilara. "What do we do now?"

Yuri reloads his crossbow. "I think we should head back to the road. There may be more waiting for us, so let's be careful."

Starguard says, "Keep looking. Our wizard friend wouldn't have been defeated by a single wolf."

Andreth comments, "Let's stick together. There might be more next time."

Tilara says, "We watch for more wolves, Stormy. Someone's got to keep their eyes on things, and we're elected for that at the moment. Our Andvarri friends have odd ways, but they mean well."

Tilara says, "I am much more curious as to what the wisp of smoke was when Ash killed the thing. That .... concerns me."

Yuri notices the bolt that Ash missed with, and points it out to Ash. "You probably wanna keep that."

Andreth hmms at Tilara. "Maybe just from the lightning?"

Ash nods, rises, and wanders off to retrieve it. On the way he flexes his hand experimentally from time to time - good as new.

Tilara says, "Maybe... and maybe not. We'll see."

After spending a few more moments regrouping, the party slowly makes it's way back to the road without seeing anything else. Well, anything else of note. There's grass, and mud, and all that other stuff. But nothing unexpected. Reaching the road, the group resumes it's trek to the campsite, and reaches it in short order.

Yuri murmurs to Karlsefnir, "Where'd the ambush go? Are they still out there?"

The campsite is currently empty, the woodpile well stocked, and the little bucket contains only a single penny. But there are a few obvious signs of the fight that must have occurred. Three of the four trees carry lightning damage, and the door to the single latrine is still hanging from its hinges.

Karlsefnir sniffs the air. "Here. There. Don't know."

Starguard sighs. "Should we make camp, folks? If we wait long enough, trouble will find us."

The campsite consists primarily of a grassy field, beside the stream. The four trees provide little cover, and the woodpile provides even less. And all around the small field, the grasses and shrubs wave in the light breeze, that has just begun to pick up.

Stormy shivers, as he looks around. "We don't really have cover here." He looks up at the trees, which look quite scarred. "We can't even really climb the trees."

Starguard nods. "We'll have to camp tight together. And double watches."

Karlsefnir moves down to the stream, examing the banks. Then he points something out to Thord, who also leans over. Arnlaug, standing beside them, looks down, and then lopes off to get Stormy. Soon the four are embroiled in a discussion that involves a lot of pointing at the mud.

Starguard moves over. "What's up, Stormy? Tracks?"

Stormy nods. "Wolf tracks. Large wolf tracks. And other tracks too. They say this is a ... a drinking hole. A place where animals come to drink, and perhaps to cross. And one track might be a footprint, but half of it is ... covered."

Starguard says, "Well, the wizard was here, after all..." He drops to peer at the tracks.

Tilara says, "And so was the farmer who told us about the place. How old is the footprint, Stormy?"

The tracks, in the mud, are quite clear. And there's a lot of them. Which means there's a lot of overlap. But yes, definitely wolf prints, and some smaller prints ... perhaps rabbits? And here ... a footprint.

Starguard shakes his head. "It's too wet here. This is fresh, from last night..."

Tilara hmmms. "But Piers was here this morning. We'll have to head that way in the morning if nothing turns up overnight."

Starguard nods. "It could be Piers, actually. And a few of these could be dog prints. But not all of them, I think."

Stormy gets dragged back into the conversation with the Andvarri. They all talk heatedly, and one of them baaas like a kid goat. And then Stormy is sent back to the party. Stormy, looking a lot paler now, sighs. "They say; make ambush, using a goat. They suggested I could make a _gulp_ good goat."

Yuri makes a sour face and speaks in A-isian, "That's not a risk we'll be taking. If anyone's going in harm's way it's me."

Starguard says, "Nothing personal Yuri, but you look a bit less like bait."

Karlsefnir grins at Yuri. "You make good goat too."

Yuri says, "Ordinarily that would be a compliment, but I think I can act sufficiently helpless for our purposes."

Andreth rubs his chin. "Be nice to not be the ones _bein'_ ambushed for a change..."

Yuri nods back at Karlsefnir, and says in A-isian, "I lead, even into harm's way."

Arnlaug and Thord baaaa helpfully.

Starguard nods. "Alright, Yuri. But let's make camp first."

Tilara snickers as Mirra miaows curiously at the goat noises. _"Milk?"_

The Andvarri each give Yuri one pat on the back, and then fade into the shrublands. Soon, they're gone from sight. Only the occasional baa suggests they're lying underneath some bushes.

Yuri sets up in the clearing as if he's camping, back to the woodpile.

Andreth hmms quietly. _Okay, hiding is something I'm pretty good at..._ He picks a different hedge nearby and hides amongst the brush.

Ash isn't good at hiding, but will take up a position maybe 20 feet from Andreth.

Yuri says, "Hide in pairs. That way they can't pick us off."

Starguard nods, and will join Andreth, taking pointers.

Stormy shakes his head. "I'll stay with you. I'm not good at hiding. And if you're all alone, won't they get ... suspicious?

Tilara nods as the others fade into the brush, and settles in not too far from Ash.

Yuri nods. "That's a good point. But stick close to the woodpile and if we're surprised, use that for cover."

Stormy nods, making up a little bedroll from a few pieces of wood.

Yuri arranges with Stormy to trade off sleeping, a few hours at a time.

After a cold and lonely supper, the party settled in for the night. Shortly before midnight, the wind picked up, and dark clouds covered the sky. And the rain began to pour, drenching everything for two hours, before coming to a stop. Stormy shiver. _I hate being outside in the rains._ As he waited for Yuri to wake him up, he looked around. _I wonder where everyone is._ Then, shrugging, he curled up.

More hours passed. Yuri and Stormy traded off wakefulness, as the night crawled along. As the Mother Star rose, Yuri was awake, Stormy curled up against the woodworks.

Andreth, from his hiding place in the brush, rises silently and looks out toward the stream...

Yuri turns carefully so that he can see the stream, if he looks sidelong.

Starguard stays still, listening, not trusting his eyes in the darkness.

Two large shapes cross the stream, trying to move slowly. Each is carrying what might be a club. But it's dark, and hence hard to tell.

Yuri nudges Stormy carefully.

Stormy nods, instantly alert.

Yuri narrowly avoids getting hit by one creature's club. Yuri quickly draws his weapons and assumes a defensive posture for himself and Firestorm, but is unable to block both blows and gets hit by the second creature's attack.

Taking advantage of Yuri's distraction with his partner, the second creature steps around and taps him on the head with a morning star. Not a hard blow, but still, there's some blood. Meanwhile, Karl rises from the thicket where he was hidden, and flings his javelin. It sticks in the back of the first creature.

As he throws, Karlsefnir gives vent to a guttural war cry; loud enough to wake the dead ...

Andreth leaps forward at that cry, swinging wildly at the second attacker and missing.

Tilara wakes to her familiar's agitation and Karl's shout. She reaches for her crossbow and fires at the nearest creature.

A ominous twange from a bush signals Starguard's contribution to the ambush, the bolt cutting through the air to bite into an unprotected shoulder. A beat later, lighting arcs, lighting up the clearing slightly as the enemy is shocked.

Stormy, meanwhile, moves away from the woodpile. Yuri's too close here. Circling up behind the creatures, he holds his hands flat, thumb to thumb, and prays for fire. The creatures, scream, as flames lick over them. In the light, you can see just how big these hulking humanoids are. They wear leather armour over furry skin, and are carrying heavy morningstars.

Ash growls and leaps out of the bushes, greatsword in hand. Though the blade is caught on the mysterious enemy's club, Ash doesn't seem to mind - he's got a fierce look of glee on his face, and his eyes burn with battle-lust.

As Thord rises up, javelin in hand, to cast into the clearing, something pounces on him from behind, bearing him to the ground and badly ripping his shoulders open. Unconscious, Thord simply lies and bleeds.

The smaller of the two creatures roars the pain of the fire, and swings at Yuri.

Yuri yelps as his assailant strikes him another solid blow, and hits back with the flat of his blade - barely enough to put the thing on the ground.

Meanwhile, Arnlaug sees what has happened to Thord. He yells, and flings his javelin at the shadowy creature, doing only a little damage. But that's more than the second humanoid did. He tried to smash Yuri's head in, only to foul his weapon in his partner's collapsing body.

Tilara frowns at the wolf-creature and slaps another bolt into her crossbow. She misses it in the dim light, however.

Following Tilara's lead, Karlsefnir spots the downed Thord. Moving economically to allow Tilara a free line of sight, he moves in and tries to club the creature. But in the dark, he misses.

Andreth roars a challenge, and swings a fist at the creature attacking Yuri, missing... but as his fist whistles by, he brings his elbow sharply into its ribs. There is a crunching sound, and the monster gurgles as it falls.

Starguard's voice raises to the heaven, calling down the stars' help, his chanting causing a familiar shining light form and colesce. But not in the ground, in the air! An eagle forms of stardust, crying out, circling above the battlefield.

Stormy stands over the two fallen warriors, and looks worriedly at Yuri. "Are you hurt?"

Yuri says, "I'm OK. I'm more worried about the Andvari."

Ash runs for the pile of pelt and head, scooping up his trophy, and waves it at the attacking lupine. "Come on, ya mangy cur! I got one of ya and I'm coming for you!"

The wolf bays at the wolf's head, and backs up. Then, making up its mind, it disappears into the darkness, heading for the far away forest at a steady pace.

Yuri sees that Thord's in a bad way. "Stormy, get some cord from my pack and tie these two up. I'm going to see to thord." He runs over to Thord and does his best attempt to keep him in one piece until Starguard arrives.

Arnlaug moves to stand over Thord, his hand caressing the downed man's brows as he looks up at Yuri. Then he picks up his javelin, and peers resolutely into the night.

Tilara fires after the retreating wolf, grazing it and eliciting a yelp, though apparently not much damage. She snarls as it departs, and turns to look at the humanoid things. "What were they?"

Karlsefnir follows Yuri, and he, too, attempts to staunch the bleeding. But nothing seems to work.

Yuri says, "Starguard? We've got a problem here!"

Andreth looks with concern at Thord, but if Karl and Yuri can't help, he'd be better off letting Starguard handle it. So instead he raises his bow and sends a crossbow bolt flying into the darkness after the wolf. Well, presumably he was aiming at the wolf, but the gods alone know what he actually hit, because it certainly wasn't the wolf.

The celestial eagle, summoned by Starguard's mighty prayers, comes winging down, and then with three strong wing beats, takes after the fleeing wolf. As it comes in for the kill, it barely hits the wolf, and does only glancing damage.

Starguard moves over to Thord's side, calling a minor spell forth to stop the bleeding, before determining what is needed for the fallen Andvarri.

Yuri goes back to the two downed wolf-things, and checks on their health.

Ash spits a curse at the departing wolf and turns to assess the situation. "I'm on patrol," he states curtly, nodding down at the fallen. "Yell if you need anything."

In the distance, the wolf is still fleeing. Probably. Considering he's now lost from sight.

Yuri says, "Starguard, if you hurry, we can have two prisoners!"

And flying above the wolf, harrying it along, the eagle keeps swooping down, doing a small amount of damage.

Starguard moves over to prisoners, seeing to them without magic.

Yuri says, "Andreth? Can you watch Ash's back?"

Karlsefnir and Arnlaug gather around Starguard and Thord's prone body, giving the good Brother all the room he needs to work. As Thord slowly regains conscious, they both lean over and pat him on the back. Much laughter is heard. Meanwhile, the night returns to quiet peacefulness, as the Mother Star continues to rise in the sky.

Andreth nods to Yuri, and follows Ash as his quiet shadow.

Yuri rummages through his pack for some cord in his climbing gear, and binds the two wolf-men... or perhaps just wild-men... so that they don't get away.

Yuri says, "Maybe... we should get back to town. We have a lot of questions to ask these two."

Tilara says, "Hmm. How do you expect to get them back there? I don't think we're going to be able to carry them."

As Ash and Andreth roam further afield, the sky begins to glow with the first rays of the dawn. Meanwhile Yuri gets a better look at these men. They don't appear to be even vaguely wolfish. If anything they look ... the noses are small, and the mouths are disfigured by large tusks of teeth. And the hair on their head is either kept cropped short, or is a thick fur pelt.

Yuri says, "Ugly... what manner of man are these?"

Yuri asks Karlsefner (in A-Isian), "Ever met any of these before?"

Karlsefnir shakes his head. "No. Not ... not think so."

Starguard thinks. "I've seen them in a book once. What was they called? Foramen."

Yuri says, "Foramen? Well, the Major did say there were strange things in the forest..."

Tilara says, "Have to ask Tormel, I guess. Do you remember anything about them besides the name?"

Yuri says, "But they aren't the Changers."

Starguard says, "They prey on single travellers and are rarely seen..."

Tilara says, "But then... why were they teamed up with another of those wolves?"

Yuri says, "Well, what can we do with these two? Maybe we can shake some answers out of them... or perhaps the Major would have some ideas."

Starguard says, "I have no idea, Tilara. I barely know what they are."

Andreth studies the features of the captives curiously. "Even if they ain't _involved_, they may ha' seen somethin' useful to us."

Starguard says, "They do speak, I think. Trade, anyway."

Yuri says, "You're right that getting them back to town will be tricky. Maybe we can get some answers out of them here."

Yuri turns to Starguard. "Do the Stars grant you any blessings in the nature of extracting truth, or do we have to do it the old-fashioned way?"

Ash shakes his head. "We send Stormy and the Andvarri out to one of the Syndic's farms, get a cart, and ride them back. We aren't secure out here."

Starguard says, "I might be able to come up with something. Might take a day, though..."

Yuri nods. "Then it sounds like we should get back to town. Ash, I like that idea. Does anyone object?"

Tilara says, "Works for me... if you think they're worth questioning."

Ash snorts. "They're the second enemy we're CAPABLE of questioning. It's worth it."

Yuri says, "If they're working with the wolves, it will be worth it."

After tying the two thugs up securely, Starguard jogged off with the Andvarri to the Greer Syndic, where they quickly talked Fenton Greer into lending them a cart, two horses, and Piers.

By noon, the cart was back, and the whole company had returned to Thorpenhow before nightfall. The prisoners were given into the care of the bemused guard, who carefully locked them up, and left to heal slowly on their own. The company, meanwhile, spent the evening in their rooms at the inn, recovering.
