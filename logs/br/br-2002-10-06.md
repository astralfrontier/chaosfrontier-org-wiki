# Birthright 2002-10-06

_Ungfallen's temple squats above Githa, stretching for the skies on square haunches. Four stories tall, the lowest, widest story is swallowed up by the buildings that surround it; leaving three stories to rise high. Each story is a squat cube, shorter and narrower than the one below, and each contains a large door that stands perpetually open. The four doors on the four stories stand perpetually open, facing the four cardinal directions, the doors crumbled away._

A short, heavy man comes walking up, huffing and puffing, one of the smaller boys by his side. "I am _huff_ the novice master. What can _puff_ I do for you?"

The man surveys Starguard first, peering at him, and then turns to look at Andreth. "I'm sorry, lad. We take our novices _puff_ a little younger."

Starguard chuckles. "That's not what we're here for, Brother...?"

The man leans heavily on the boy. "Oh?"

Andreth nods, smiling a little. "Just wantin' to learn a little, sir."

The man nods. "Learning is always good. Even as late at night as this."

Starguard says, "Ah, but death comes at any time, doesn't it? Even when the blessed Stars shine." He looks pious for a moment before chuckling. "Sorry, Father. We forgot how late it is."

" Ignoring Starguard, the man steps forward, grasping Andreth's chin, and turning his head this way and that. He hmmms, twice, and then nods. "People who come on the lady's business are never late."

The other boys gasp, crowding around Andreth, tugging on hand and sleeve, and tunic in awe.

Starguard raises an eyebrow, looking curiously at Andreth for a moment, then saves questions for later. "We're just looking for information on an ex-pupil of yours that we ran into. Do you remember Grikurgrah?"

Andreth's eyes widen, and he looks around at the little crowd forming around him, a bashful expression on his rugged features.

Straightening to his full height, all five feet two and three quarter inches of it, the novice master nods. His hand still grips Andreth's chin tightly, and he tugs the lad down to his own level, tracing the scars with his other hand. "Who? Grikugrah? Hmmm? Oh. Yes. Ran away about ten, fifteen years ago. Talented lad. Could have gone far, even with his looks." The man sighs.

Andreth kneels down a bit, for the aid of the novice master. "You c'n see it, then?" he murmurs.

One of the smaller boys tugs on Andreth's sleeve. "Please, sir; when you saw Her, did you hear the flute? Did you see the Book? Was the Flame burning?"

The novice master smiles, fingering the scar one last time. "Yes. He doesn't release many after she's marked them, though." He smiles widely. "But the temple is at your disposal, Marked One." He pronounces "Marked One" in three syllables, putting a lot of weight behind it. It sounds quite ... actually, quite pompous. But he's probably aiming for awe-inspiring.

Starguard stays quiet, listening. He hasn't heard much of Andreth's time...dead. He frowns, remembering his own failures to heal.

Andreth tries to keep up with the frantic questioning, and to squeeze in questions of his own.. "The...? There was a flame, but I don't remember any of the rest of that. What is the Book? And what's the flute for?"

The novice master looks at the lad. "Your catechism?" The lad nods, eyes opened wide. "The Flame is kept by Limera, who brings heat, and life into the underworld. Merial keeps the Book wherein all stories are recorded. And the Flute calls back the souls, to tell their stories. And Ungfallen marks the souls, and harvests them, and houses them in safety or in horror, all by the acts of the overworld."

The lad turns to Andreth. "So what's she like? Is she really ten feet tall, and granite black? Does she speak in gouts of flame?" The lad's voice fades away a lot. "Is she ... nice?"

The other boys all nod, looking intently at Andreth.

Andreth raises his hand to his own cheek, remembering. "Merial... she seemed almost human, actually... but noble, far nobler 'n anyone I've ever seen afore or since. And kind, as well..."

The boys all aaaah, in unison, looking joyful. And then they press forward. "Was she blonde?" "No, of course she wasn't, dummkopf, really pretty ladies always have red hair!" "Bah!" A little shoving breaks out among two of the lads. "And did you see anyone else?" "Did you see a baby?" "Did you see a girl, about this tall, and wearing a beautiful blue dress?" "Did you see my father?" The boys press closer.

Andreth leans away, learning to his chagrin that to answer young childrens' questions only raises more questions. "Slow down, slow down!" he begs, sounding rather frantic.

The kids press forward, until the novice master clears his throat meaningfully, at which point the shoving stops, with only a mumbled "Is too a redhead!". The man looks at each of the boys in turn, and holds up his forefinger. "One question. Each." He turns to Andreth; "that is, Mark-ed One, if you would be so kind?"

The boys press forward. "What was it like to die?" "Did it hurt?" "Peet already asked that, you silly, what a waste of a question! Did you see my Pa?" "What's it like to be underground?" Two of the boys hold back, waiting to see what happens.

Andreth thinks. "I didn't see no one else there... just meself and the Lady. Did it hurt? Well, being bit hurt," he says, touching the scars on his throat. "But the rest was just... peaceful and quiet. There was a room... with books, so many books..." He chuckles a bit. "Wished I was a better reader just then, I did."

Andreth raises his head. "Maybe they were all the Book, d'you think? If _all_ stories are really recorded, it'd take a lot more'n just one big book."

The boys hang back, disappointed. No last messages to pass on, it would appear. One of the two boys hanging back steps forward. "So if it was all so peaceful, and quiet, and there wuz all de books, why didn't you _just stay_? What made _you_ so special?"

Andreth says solemnly, "I didn't _want_ to stay, cos my friends still needed me. Needed me so much that they put themselves in the service o' the Brothers of the Waters so's they would call to the gods and ask for me back. As to why they _did_ send me back... I don't know. I think I'm s'posed to find _out_ why."

The last boy waits, quietly, for his turn, as the others begin to fall back. "Have you ever seen her again?" This is the same boy who first pointed out Andreth's mark.

Andreth nods to the lad. "Not _seen_ her face, with my eyes, but I have felt her presence since. Heard her voice, when I prayed to her. And saw... a candle?"

Starguard says, "The Flame, pehaps?"

The boy nods, once. Then, at the novice master's wave, the boys gather up the buckets and mops and other cleaning accoutrements, and vanish. "Thank you, Mark-ed One. That was kind of you."

Andreth grins. "Thank _you_, sir. I think I learned as much as they did."

Starguard hmms. "I didn't realize you were so close, Andreth."

Starguard seems lost in though, considering.

The novice master smiles. "The Lady's shrine sits on the top floor, if you've a mind to visit."

Starguard says, "Go, Andreth, if you like. I'll see what I can find out about Grikurgrah."

Andreth bows to the novice master. "Thank you again."

While Andreth climbs the stairs to the fourth floor, Starguard and the Novice Master compare notes on old soldiers, and old students. These have, as it turns out, much in common. Although Grikugrah ... Grikugrah was very quiet. Never mixed much, but very talented. Very talented indeed. Devoted to Ungfallen's worship; he had taken upon himself the maintenance of Ungfallen's Crypt, on the second floor. He had even repaired the doors, and the lad was most heartbroken when the Novice Master had to rebreak the doors once more.

Meanwhile Andreth finds the shrine. Or rather, he finds a niche in which a flame burns. As he steps closer, the flame burns a little higher. Composing himself, he prays to the lady, and the flame burns, dancing in a non-existent breeze. As he prays, he feels encouraged to tell of his tales, and he shares them with the flame. When, at last, Andreth comes to the end of the tale he feels drained but also refreshed. Stepping outside, onto the roof of the third floor, Andreth notices that the Father Star has long since set, and Sunni, too, is retiring for the night.

"There's not much else I can say about Grikugrah, really. He left the day before he was to take his final vows. Nobody saw him leave, and we've not heard of him since. You have news of him?" The Novice Master smiles, as the two older men exchange information, and he looks pleased to hear that Grikugrah has a family now.

Starguard says, "Does anyone have a theory why Grikurgrah didn't take the vows?"

The Novice Master shakes his head. "No. But he was powerfully upset when we rebroke the doors. Kept muttering about respect for weeks."

Starguard says, "Why are the broken doors so important?"

"Ancient history, really. When the temple was first raised, the Ladies would sometimes come to visit. But the head priest, a most proud man, set himself above Mere Ladies, and barred the doors. Ungfallen himself, in his only visit, crumbled those doors. And tis said ..." The novice master's voice drops several decibels. "Tis said that when the doors are closed again Ungfallen himself will turn his back on this world, and the Book and the Flame will be closed and extinguished."

Starguard hmms. "Interesting. Grikurgrah does have some rather...unfortunate attitudes about women. Thank you."

The Novice Master nods. "Those, he gets from his tribe. They're a little ... a little savage, still. Not quite ... not quite civilized. We had to teach him to read when he arrived, of course."

Starguard nods. "Thank you, Father. You've helped a lot."

After waiting a few hours for Andreth, the two rejoin the caravan. In the morning, the caravan sets out. The heat of summer is beginning to warm the mornings, and spirits are high. By nightfall, having passed three farmers, a merchant, and two boys herding geese, the party is well pleased to have reached the usual campsite.

As almost every other caravan campsite, this one too lies about a hundred yards off the road, near a small copse of wood. There's a fire ring for the cook, a pile of wood with a small bucket soliciting donations, and two latrines labeled "His" and "Theirs".

Tilara looks around the site, Mirra prowling at her heels. "Let's hope we have a quiet night."

The campsite certainly looks deserted enough.

Tilara stretches after the long day, and limbers up with a few practice juggles.

Yuri throws a few coppers in the firewood collection box. "His and Theirs? Either they've only got one man, or some extra genders."

Ash slumps near the fire, looking tired and thoughtful.

Yuri says, "I heard some things in Githa, just poking around. Some of the townsfolk have bad memories of Grikurgrah, which I guess doesn't surprise me. I don't really like him at all."

Yuri says, "Otherwise... there's what you'd expect to hear. Rumors about the undead rising in the battlefields; hunting is off; fishing is good, and a lot of strangers on the road. Including us."

Tormel walks the cats, who are being good as gold on their leather leashes. Stormy walks right behind, watching the cats warily.

The following morning the good weather holds, and the party makes good time, reaching CairnTor by nightfall. The caravanserai there stands just outside of town, in a pleasant meadow with a stream running through the lower end. No dragging buckets out of wells tonight. But the wall is only a simple hedge, well tended and thick, but still only a hedge ...

Yuri hmms. "Let's keep an eye on that hedge during the watches. Can we do anything to let us know if someone tries to crawl through it?"

The town itself lies nestled into the side of a hill, the high point ceded to a single barnlike building. That's where the Mayor, Samnulte, lives. On the roof, a single man stands guard, but he doesn't seem particularly attentive. He hasn't, for instance, responded to the caravan's arrival.

Yuri sighs, _This far south, there's an entire town and two days' travel from all the action on the road from Thorpenhow. I guess they figure they've got nothing to worry about, and that might be good for us. Or really, really bad._

Yuri says, "Anyone want to go with me to drop off the messages from the Major?"

Tilara nods. "I'll come along, if you want company."

Yuri says, "I think I would."

As the caravan settles in, guards assigned to watch the hedges and the animals, Starguard preparing supper, Yuri and Tilara head the for the top of the hill, home of the Mayor. CairnTor is a smallish town, smaller than it seems; people must live very close together, or else there is more to the buildings that a simple look suggests.

Arriving at the mayor's house, the two are quickly admitted into a large training hall, where the mayor is sparring with two of his guardsmen. He's practicing with the quarterstaff, and more than holding his own against the two men. Noticing the pair, the mayor disarms his opponents, and turns to give greetings.

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "Wow. He's good."

Tilara nods quietly. "Aye. Let's hope he's good at strategy as well as hand-to-hand combat."

Yuri bows. "I'm Yuri from the White Company. This is Tilara. Our caravan has come here from Thorpenhow and the Major there has sent messages for you."

"Greetings. I am Samnulte, mayor of this sleepy burg. And I am delighted by these messages." Accepting the messages, the man opens the letter quickly, scanning it. "I see; they've been busy up north, have they?"

Yuri nods. "Quite busy. Many and tangled plots and problems."

Yuri says, "We'll be happy to answer any questions that you have. We've been... we've made it our business to stay on top of these matters."

The man snorts. "Of course. Imagine Lady San not plotting ... The world would come to an end. But thank you for these messages. We will record them, and perhaps send an orphan or two with a handful of guards. Providing the lasses are willing, of course."

Yuri says, "You seem a skilled armsman yourself. Is there a similar military tradition in this town?"

Stretching, the man smiles. "Nah. I retired here, as did some of my troop mates. Good town for an ex-merc, this place is. And I train the young uns up, who wants it, of course. But mostly we're just simple folk. A little weaving, a little distilling, a little pottery ..."

Yuri says, "Distilling, you say? We're the first caravan to go to Citadel this year. Do you ever send your goods to the city?"

The man shakes his head. "Most of the goods we make go west, or to the farms. We prefer to stay local. It's Cariston as houses the fancy pants artisans."

After the offer to carry messages up the line is made, and refused, Tilara and Yuri make their exits gracefully. The camp is set up, and the night passes quietly, with the four merchants pleased that the party is making good time.

In the morning, having refreshed their supplies somewhat, the party once more resumes their journey. Citadel is getting closer every day now.

As the day passes, what were at first small rolling hills have grown into larger hills, and the evenings campsite is situated a little further away from the road than usual, in a small valley between two steep rock covered hills.

Tormel looks around admiringly. "These hills, if these hills could talk, these hills would have stories to tell ..."

Ash scoffs. "These hills would say \`we have been sitting here doing nothing since forever'."

Andreth hehs. "Only if they're interested in nothin' but their own affairs."

Yuri sighs, checking the party coffers. _Well, it's payday, and we're a bit short._ He dumps some of his own cash into the pile, and pays the four guards and Tormel.

Tormel hmmphs, turning his back on Ash. "Why, just trace the cave entrances. I would wager these hills are absolutely honeycombed."

Ash blinks. "Oh yeah? With what? Somebody just felt like digging holes?"

Yuri says, "Are these mines, or natural caves?"

Tormel sighs. "I don't know. I've never gone to look. But there's no tales of mines is these lands. There's precious few tales of anyone living in these lands"

Tilara says, "No? I'd think that people would want to live close to the Citadel."

Tormel shakes his head, and pulls out the atlas. "Most people in Aglamar settled in the fertile lands along the river, where repeated flooding had improved the land greatly. And others have settled along the East Trade Route, of course, your families included."

"But here, between CairnTor, and CairnStoke," he points along the route you're on, "the land is empty. Only the hills, and the marshes, and the beasts to keep it company."

Tilara hmmms. "I think we should keep a careful watch tonight, then."

Yuri says, "You know, it's fairly early. I feel like going for a walk, taking a look around. Seeing what's out there."

"In other words they liked farmin' better'n hist'ry," drawls Ash, taking a rare moment to deliberately avoid his more formalized speech.

Tilara nods to Yuri. "Indeed. I think that's a very good idea."

Ash nods in agreement as Yuri speaks, and joins in. "I'll come with you. I need to get away."

Tormel nods at Ash. "Exactly."

Yuri says, "Anyone else want to come?"

Starguard says, "I think I better this time. Dinner's ready, anyway, but there's a lot fo beasts around."

Andreth stands up. "I'll come along too..."

Stormy, watching, looks torn. "Shouldn't someone stay ... with the caravan?

Tilara says, "We've got the guards and the Andvarri to keep an eye on things, Stormy. Don't feel guilty about coming along if you want."

Yuri says, "It's up to you, Stormy. If you want to take it easy for a while, stay here and keep an eye on things. Be sure to make some noise if there's trouble. Or, you can go with us, and we'll leave things to take care of themselves for a while."

These hills are alive with the sound of ... with the sound of silence, actually. Not a bird in the sky, not a rabbit to be seen. It's very very quiet. As the party sets out on a bit of a walk about, in a wide ring around the campsite, they look around. The caves look natural, and vary in size from tiny holes in the hill to massive gaping maws. At the head of the valley a little spring burbles, flowing for a few moments, and then disappearing underground again, bringing a little sound to the walk.

Yuri sees something, and his eyes grow wide, and he motions everyone to get down.

Starguard drops looking about, searching...

Ash ducks early, but growls a bit. He seems to see the same thing Yuri's eyes caught.

Yuri taps Starguard and points to one of the caves, whispering 'Gerard' in his ear.

Tilara hits the ground just after Yuri. She peers around, trying to find out what he's seen.

Andreth is down on the ground with the others, watching where Yuri is pointing.

Yuri does the same for Tilara, and waits for the message to make the rounds.

As the party peers intently at the cave, some sixty yards away, you can hear a single pebble drop. But there's nothing else to be seen. The caravan still looks peaceful, everyone going about their usual routine. The merchants quibbling, Tormel scribbling, the cats lounging ...

Tilara frowns, and passes the information on to Stormy. "Now what?" she whispers.

Looking confused, Stormy passes the information along as he, too, drops to the ground.

Yuri murmurs, "Let's go find out what he's up to. And there's someone else there, too. So let's go quietly..."

Yuri says, "I'll go first, follow me a few yards behind."

The cave that Yuri has pointed out, or rather the cave entrance, is some seven feet tall, and four feet wide at its widest. It's a tad irregular, and doesn't appear manmade.

Moving into the lead, Yuri quietly sneaks into the cave, his party members sneaking not quite so quietly behind him. Ahead, all is silent. The cave stretches about deep, into the hill. Near the far end, the cave branches, into three irregular passages.

Yuri pulls out some candles and passes them around.

Yuri glances at the floor, to see if there's any hints of passage... disturbed dust, dropped bits of gear...

The floor is, well without knowing a lot more about tracking it is hard to tell if the floor is just naturally filthy, or if someone worked hard and long at this. Certainly, there's little bones everywhere, as though a predator once laired here.

Leaning over, Starguard examines the branchings. All three show signs of passage but the third passage looks as though it was traversed most recently. By humanoids, at least.

Starguard freezes, looking right...

Ash sighs a bit, clenching a fist and shaking it in frustration.

Yuri lights some candles, and nudges Starguard, an inquiring look on his face.

Ash begins creeping toward the third passage, his hand reaching for his sword.

Starguard motions towards the third passage, a worried look on his face.

Andreth's eyes flicker as he tries to be even quieter. Spotting Ash's movements, he glides silently to his side.

Looking down the third passage, Ash sees nothing. And he hears nothing more. The passage seems to curve even further to the right, a few steps in.

Ash motions angrily at Yuri, pointing ahead. His face contorts into an expression of extreme displeasure; his fingers play at the hilt of his sword.

Starguard extinguishes his candle, more worried about being seen than running into something.

Yuri snuffs out the candle, and tries to see or listen in the direction Ash is pointing.

Andreth extinguishes his own candle and puts it away, as much to keep both his hands free as to make less light.

Yuri whisper to Ash, "What is it?"

Ash keeps his voice low as he can manage. "Chuckling. Gerard."

Tilara nods to herself as the candles go out. _Much easier to sneak without dragging light along. I'll be ready to cast a light spell if need be._

Yuri nods, and starts sneaking down the tunnel. _If Gerard has a light, then we'll have all the light we need when we get there._

Stormy watches the interplay of candles going on, and off, a look of confusion on his face. But he follows Tilara's lead. She knows best.

As Yuri slowly follows the passage, one hand on the wall, the passage curves further and further to the right. After perhaps forty steps ...

... Yuri feels the ground suddenly swing away from underneath his feet. Startled, he jumps back, barely catching himself at the lip of a yawning pit.

Andreth hears a scuffling sound ahead of him and stops, listening warily.

Yuri turns his head back, and mutters carefully, "Dammit. Lights, or we're not getting through."

Starguard strikes a candle, holding it high...

Ahead of Yuri, the ground has opened up into a deep pit, that stretches the length of the passage, and is perhaps ten or twelve feet long, and substantially deeper. It's hard to tell, with the shadows.

Tilara says, "This looks familiar..."

Yuri thinks, _How the Hell did Gerard get across?_

The pit, if such it be, looks natural. A fault that opened up long ago.

Starguard checks the ground for the tracks.

Starguard says, "I think someone came this way..."

Yuri murmurs, "How did they cross the gap?"

Starguard hmms. "The last track is right...here." He points to a spot on the ground two feet back of the pit.

Tilara says, "I could get a few of us across... should I go look?"

Andreth says, "If you c'n get one of us across, they can carry a rope and we c'n get everyone else."

Yuri says, "We shouldn't split up that much. If anyone goes across here, everyone else should go back the entrance to keep an eye on the other tunnels."

Tilara goes back to peer at the place where Starguard claims there are marks. "Was he running?"

Starguard shrugs. "Hard to tell, but possible. He might have leaped."

Yuri says, "Can you get us all across? And back?"

Tilara shakes her head. "Not all of us. And the spell doesn't last all that long." She grins. "Besides, I seem to recall that the last time, you refused to try a spider."

Yuri says, "Then let's go back to camp and get our stuff. We can leave two people inside the entrance in case Gerard comes back. But I think going in here un-prepared - no rope, no lanterns, no poles - is foolish."

Ash nods. "I'll stay," he murmurs quietly, glancing down into the fissure.

Tilara peers down the gap. "Actually... this isn't like that steep pit we had to deal with back at Ferg's. The sides are rough enough to climb, especially with a rope."

Yuri says, "Wait at the entrance. And don't wait alone - who do you want with you?"

Ash shrugs in response. "Who wants to stay?"

Tilara says, "I'll stay, Ash. Magic and swords should be an effective combination."

Starguard says, "I will too. In case it isn't."

Yuri says, "OK. THe rest of us, back to camp - anything you want us to pick up for you?"

Ash shakes his head.

Tilara says, "What you said. Hurry back, we'll hold the fort."

Ash takes up restless guard duty near the triple junction, having followed Yuri and friends at least that far through the caves.

Having decided to head back to the camp to pick up proper supplies, Andreth, Stormy, and Yuri move at double quick time. Harry, seeing them come in, waves hello, and looks intrigued as he watches the three dive into the cart and retrieve supplies. Then Yuri pauses. He takes a headcount of the camp. Three Andvarri; check. Four guards: check. Sundry animals: check. Tormel: check. Four merchants: check.

Yuri says, "Harry. Where's Gerard?"

Harry blinks. "Gerard? Why, he's dicing with the other three. Right over there."

Yuri blinks back, and then walks briskly over to Gerard. "Hey! Hey, Gerard!"

Gerard looks up, sullenly. Most of the money in the dice game is lying in front of the other three men. "Yes?"

Yuri comes up short. "But if you're here... than who the blazes went down that hole?"

Yuri looks at the other three merchants. "You've all been here since we left?"

Back in the cave, Starguard quiets the others with a hand, his head turning toward the second tunnel, eyes and ears straining.

The merchants look up at Yuri. Masci nods. "We all stepped out for a short walk, and then settled down for some dicing. Gerard's not doing too well."

Yuri sighs, and turns to Harry. "Something wierd is going on. Tell the others. We have to check out a cave over there, I could have sworn we saw Gerard go into it with someone else. Watch who comes back, and don't assume it's us. We'll use a password - uh... 'Whitewash'."

Yuri says, "But for Gods' sake don't kill anyone. If you catch anyone just keep them on ice until we get back."

Harry nods.

---

The party reunites in the cave, near the three passages. Now, they have spikes, and ropes, and the like with them.

Ash waves to the returning figures, pointing into the gloom of the second passage. "We have two options," he whispers.

Andreth murmurs softly, "And we also got a Gerard back in camp," looking quite puzzled.

Starguard blinks. "Gerard?! In camp?"

Yuri says, "No kidding. He was there with the other merchants, playing dice... and losing badly."

Tilara says, "But then... who did we follow?"

Andreth says, "Only one way to find out..."

Yuri says, "I don't know. But I don't like it. You'll need a password to get back into camp."

Yuri says, "The easiest way to cross this is to lower everyone to the bottom, and then pull them up the other side... anyone willing to try the harder way?"

Tilara nods. "Easy enough. Do we try the third passage? Starguard noticed sounds coming from the middle while you were gone..."

Starguard looks over, rolling his eyes.

Yuri whispers the password - WHITEWASH - carefully to Ash, Starguard, and Tilara.

Yuri says, "I guess that would be a no, old man." He hands one end of the rope to Tilara. "However you want to do it, then."

Tilara nods. "Just a moment..." She pulls off her boots and murmurs the words to the spell, gulping down the sticky spider at the end. When the spell is working, she grabs the rope and goes across the chasm on the wall, then looks for a place to fasten it.

On the far side, Tilara finds several likely rocky outcroppings, any one of which could be used to tie the rope to.

Tilara checks the outcrops, then selects one and lowers the rope down into the fissure. "All set.."

Carefully, the party climbs down one at a time, and walks across. The ground here is broken up, but holding. At the far end everyone climbs back up. Here, the passage splits in two.

Starguard looks down. "Sorry, I have no idea," he admits after looking at the tracks for a moment.

Yuri pauses and listens.

Tilara gestures to the left, and whispers to Yuri. "I think I heard something down that way..."

Starguard looks right, hearing something as he takes the latern from Yuri.

Yuri says, "Let's go left."

Yuri says, "There's tracks both ways. We could go either way."

Starguard says, "Sound good to me..."

Tilara says, "Someone is trying to lead us on. I don't like that."

Yuri says, "I don't like it, either, but if we don't find anything, we can retreat in a hurry. There's nothing binding us to be patsies."

Leading the way once more, Yuri walks down the left passage. At first this passage moves straight, but then it begins to curve left, and begins to fall rapidly.

"I have a bad feeling about this," Starguard mutters...

The passage loops down for a long time, and then slowly rises again, turning to the left, before finally opening into a somewhat larger space.

Andreth remarks to Starguard, "Well, danger's all over, wherever you look. Least this way we get _interestin'_ danger."

Tilara says, "Let's not run out of light while we're down here. Where's the folks we're tracking?"

The larger space isn't exactly a room; it's more a brief widening of the passage. As the party looks closer, it looks as though someone may have done a little work, here, though. There's a ledge, high up, that looks less natural than its surroundings.

Examing the cave, for lack of a better word, Yuri searches carefully for traps, and finds none.

Climbing up on the wall, Tilara looks on the shelf. Mostly, the shelf contains rat droppings, but in the depths, right up against the wall, she can see two small leather sacks.

Tilara pokes the bags out with her dagger, holding her breath in case of traps.

Yuri says, "What have you found?"

The two small sacks, heavier than they look, slowly move to the front of the ledge and then drop with a metallic clang.

Tilara says, "A couple of bags. They don't look to be trapped, after all." She climbs down quickly, before the spell wears off.

Starguard moves to the far entrance and stands against the wall, hidden from view of the passage.

After finding no traps, Yuri carefully opens the bag. In the one bag, gold coins glisten in the lamplight. In the other, silver coins.

Yuri says, "Oh... wow..."

Andreth glances at Starguard's behavior, and takes the wall on the other side of the passage.

Tilara says, "Wonder how long they've been here...?"

Yuri says, "Well, guys, I think our payroll problem might be solved... if this doesn't belong to anyone who will object to us taking it."

Starguard says, "Maybe it's a gift from the Gods."

Yuri says, "Should we keep going?"

Tilara says, "Maybe a bit farther. Don't want to stay away from camp too long, though."

Yuri nods, and dumps the sacks of coins in his pack, and resumes the lead.

Starguard follows once everyone's past him. "I'm too old for cavern crawling," he mutters.

The passage, now having turned a definite left, stays fairly level, and after a few minutes, ...

... Yuri is about to put his foot down, when the floor disappears, showing a jagged pit below. Jumping back he manages to catch his balance before he falls in.

Yuri makes a small, startled cry. "Yikes!... another one!"

Yuri says, "Where... where did the floor go?"

Yuri says, "I think that was an illusion... or something... this is pretty wierd for some old limestone cave."

Andreth says, "Well, usually people don't leave their money bags neatly on a shelf, neither. Someone _lives_ here."

Tilara says, "I'm beginning to think we should turn back."

Looking around, the party notices that there is another passage, running alongside this one, that also leads up to the fissure.

Yuri says, "Maybe we should check out that passage. I can't imagine someone keeping a pit between themselves and their money, so... if there is someone living here... that's where they'd be. Between the pits."

Starguard says, "Not if they control the pits, though."

Starguard says, "Unless they live down the other passage."

Yuri says, "I have a feeling this might be the same one."

Tilara says, "Still be a nuisance to climb in and out of them. Most things would charge straight into the pit, and then you could come out and fetch them in for dinner. That's where I'd be if I lived down here."

Ash blinks.

Tilara says, "And... " She peers down into the pit. "Someone's down there already. Cover me..."

Ash grabs the back of Yuri's head with one hand, and tilts it downward.

Yuri says, "Huh? What... who?"

Ash points at a body.

Tilara renews her spell and skitters down the wall of the fissure. "Let's see who this is..." She turns the corpse over.

Yuri pulls his shortbow. "This is getting wierd..."

As Tilara turns the corpse over, she hears the whirring of bat like wings, and four overgrown mosquitoes fly into her face.

Two of the overgrown mosquitoes manage to find exposed skin; lancet-like proboscises sink in and as pincers grab a good hold, blood slowly starts getting sucked up.

As blood is being sucked up by the attached mosquito, one of the other two manages to find a good hold, and also attaches, doing a little more damage to Tilara.

Tilara yelps as the little monsters fly out from under the corpse and try to latch onto her. She tries to activate a Burning Hands to get rid of them, but the pain and lightheadedness from the bites makes her mess u the spell.

As Ash climbs down the pit, Yuri uses his short bow to shoot one of the mosquitoes, but the arrow flies overhead. Distracted by the blood loss, Tilara tries to fry the stirges, but the spell sizzles. Stormy, coming to the rescue, manages to freeze one of the suckers, but it seems to do little damage.

Starguard finishes weaving the stars into a solid shape, and the celestial eagle glides down into the pit, hunting stirges.

The eagle stoops on Tilara, as she lies unconscious, and manages to catch one of the overgrown mosquitoes, doing only superficial damage.

Starguard moves to the edge of the pit, and slips, sliding down, grasping the walls as his hands rip, his body hitting the floor with a hard thump.

Ash flurries around, his callused hands beating at insectile interruptions with some success.

Yuri, shooting again, manages to miss both the mosquitoes and Tilara.

Andreth hops off the rock wall and swerves around the giant insect hovering over him, rushing to Tilara's form and sending a fist right through the creature attached to her, in a splatter of gore. However, he's not fast enough to avoid the second swoop of his attacker, and he cries out as the thing drives its proboscis deep into him.

Starguard's slightly bloody hands drop to touch Tilara's pale form, calling the stars down to infuse the girl with healthy life again...

Meanwhile the eagle, after flapping its wings to gain a little altitude, stoops on Andreth, crushing the mosquito between it's claws.

Yuri, mostly out of spite, skewers the departing mosquito with an arrow, but fails to bring it down.
