# Birthright 2002-10-13

When last we saw our intrepid adventurers, Tilara had descended into a pit to investigate a corpse. And in the process, she disturbed a small number of overgrown mosquitoes that promptly sucked her almost dry. As the party raced to the rescue, Tilara swooned gracefully next to the corpse.

But fear not, gentle reader, for her friends arrived in time to save the stalwart Tilara and defeat the evil overgrown genetically modified mosquitoes. With the aid of the gods, Tilara was returned to consciousness, albeit of the pained and weakened variety. And while Starguard cosseted her tender wounds, the rest of the party congregated near the corpse.

Bending over the corpse, Yuri carefully tugs it up by one shoulder, rolling it over on to its back. The corpse's face is covered by bites that Starguard immediately recognizes. These mosquitoes, or their friends, have feasted before. But the puncture wounds are small, making it easy to make out the features of this man, who looks like the alabaster twin of Gerard.

Yuri says, "So... this is who we saw..."

Yuri says, "I really hope that this isn't the original. Didn't we see him following someone?"

Andreth says, "Whoever it was didn't think much of 'im, if they left 'im here to get et by giant mosquitos."

Ash turns to Yuri, looking disturbed. "He DID pay in advance, right?"

Tilara sits up, still horribly weak from blood loss. "Could have been almost anyone, if whoever it was can change his appearance. I suspect we've got an imposter back in camp."

Tilara says, "We should take the body back, to prove it to the others..."

Yuri says, "Hey paid half in advance."

Yuri searches the corpse carefully.

Yuri says, "This couldn't have been his home or he wouldn't have made such a simple mistake."

Starguard looks over Tilara's condition. "We found a dead guy in a cave. It doesn't mean anything Til."

Tilara says, "We found a dead Gerard in a cave. Look at his face."

Andreth says, "A dead guy who looks just like one o' the guys in the caravan? That means _somethin'_, though damned if I know what."

Tilara says, "My guess? This is the real Gerard, and he was lured here when we saw him before. Lured here and killed, so someone - or something - could take his place."

Yuri says, "This is interesting. He's got a letter on him."

The letter, or at least the scroll case, is elegantly sealed with silver runes that run up and down the length of the flattened case.

Ash lets his eyes wander up the wall to the path above. "We can find out which is which once we rope 'im back up and get outta here..."

Yuri says, "Wait... we should read this. Stormy, Tilara, do these runes mean anything to you?"

Tilara nods. "Speaking of which... I'm going to climb out of here while I still can. Bring it up with you." She leans against the wall for a moment, then climbs up out of the pit, panting with the effort.

Starguard says, "Here. Let me take a look at it." He pauses, holding it out a little to get a good look at it "Glyphs of warding, I think."

Yuri says, "Meaning... what?"

Yuri says, "How can we open it safely?"

Starguard says, "I'm not sure we can, without a wizard."

Ash huffs. "Right. You can open the letter when I've got some distance from you, Yuri."

Andreth says, "D'you suppose the money pouches were his?"

Yuri sighs. "If we do that, will it destroy the contents? Oh, well, not going to bother now." He puts the scroll case in his pack, and arranges to rope the Gerard look-alike out of the pit.

Tilara says, "They're glyphs of warding. Might not hurt the contents, depending on what type."

Tilara looks around suspiciously. "I hear something. Or someone. Laughing..."

Yuri hushes up and stops moving, so Tilara can listen.

Starguard says, "We've been hearing that since we got in here. I think they have a rotten sense of humor."

Tilara says, "Can you tell which way it's coming from?"

Andreth points down the passage we came from. "That way."

Yuri says, "C'mon. Let's get dead-boy out of the pit, then we can decide if we want to check it out."

Gathering a bit of rope, Ash makes his careful way up the walls of the pit, apparently intending to return the way the party came. At the top, he gets a good solid grip on the rope and braces himself against whatever rock may provide a convenient assist. "Whoever's coming up can come up," he calls, "and if it's Gerard, holler and I'll haul up."

Stormy nods, quickly climbing up the rope and then taking an obvious guard position, a few feet down the tunnel.

Moving carefully and a little more slowly now, the party retraces it's step. Past the shelf that held the money. Past the second pit that nearly caught Yuri. And then, gentle reader, the party found itself back in the entrance cave, where a young familiar looking man was dicing in the mouth of the cave.

Stormy steps forward. "Hey, Perf! Waiting for us?"

The young man looks up, grinning. "Aye. Harry sent me. Between us and the Andvarri, we gots plenty guards, so he thoughts as how I oughter guard yer backs like."

Yuri says, "Perf? What's the password, Perf?"

Tilara sighs. "He shouldn't have sent anyone up alone..."

The young man turns to Yuri, brow furrowed. "The password? Is ... it's, ummm ... I never was good with passwords. I know; it's White something. White laundry? White bleach? I know! It's white wash!"

Tilara visibly sags with relief. "Best of three. But it's you. Let's get back to camp."

Perf looks at Tilara. "You looks bad, missus. What happened?"

Yuri says, "I think we should be getting back to camp."

Yuri says, "How about you lead the way, Perf? Tilara's injured so we don't want to move too fast."

Tilara says, "Some nasty little bloodsuckers in there. We'll have to be alert tonight, in case there are more around."

Starguard nods. "And we've got a body to move. Familiar looking one."

Perf nods. "Sure thing, missus, I'll show you the easy path." He looks at the body and recoils. "Ooooh! That's Gerard!"

Starguard nods. "That's what we think. So who's dicing at camp?"

Perf shrugs. "Gerard? No ... that can't be right."

Tilara says, "Aye. Who. Or what?"

Tilara says, "It's either illusion or a shapeshifter of some sort. We'll find out when we get there. Don't say anything right away, Perf, okay?"

Yuri says, "Let's get moving. And nobody try anything funny."

"Okay, missus." He leads the way down to the camp, using a little used goat's path that circles round and deposits the party on the short road leading to camp.

Starguard says, "Hey, wait a minute. How'd you find this path, Perf? It's a tiny little thing."

Perf turns back. "Eh? It's ... ummm ... it's always been here. Found it last time we camped here with a caravan."

Andreth grunts, shaking his head. "You went wanderin' around the hills too, then?" he mumbles, shrugging.

Yuri says, "Didn't I say that everyone should stay in camp?"

Turning to Andreth, Perf nods. "Our captain at the time liked us to roam a little. Stretch our legs, learn the neighbourhood."

Turning back to Yuri, Perf shrugs. "Dunno. Harry said ta follow you."

Yuri nods... "Well, I think we better have a word with Harry then. Let's speed this up."

Tilara nods. "Not a bad idea. If you know the camp areas, you can tell more easily when something's amiss. You'll forgive us if we're suspicious at the moment, Perf... finding a second Gerard has us spooked."

Arriving back at the camp, the party sees Harry almost immediately. "Ah, Perf. You've found them. You're off now till third watch."

Yuri murmurs to Harry, "Who told Perf the password?"

Harry smiles. "I did. Just in case. You seemed so worried, and I'll not have my men killed for lack of information."

Yuri says, "Then isn't there something else you should be doing?"

Tilara sighs. "No, Yuri... I'd like him to see this. Get Tormel, too."

Tilara says, "Perf, stay with us, please?"

Harry blinks, then steps back. "Very well. I will check the pickets." But he turns back at Tilara's comment.

Yuri says, "No... you're supposed to ask us what the password is."

Harry sighs. "Oh, very well. What's the password, Yuri."

Yuri says, "Whitefish."

Harry blinks. "No, it isn't. It's whitewash."

Tilara sighs again. "You weren't supposed to tell us, though, if we got it wrong."

Yuri scowls. "What the hell am I paying you for? Think about what you just said. We're going back to camp. Now. And we're calling in all the pickets. Something foul is going on here."

Harry ohs, looking confused. "Shall I go call them in?"

Yuri says, "Yes."

Starguard scowls. This is no way to run a camp.

Andreth is startled himself by Yuri's vehemence, although he understands the need for it. Wordlessly he keeps close to the rest of the party - when Yuri's snappy, that usually means something bad is amiss.

Harry trots up, gathering up the pickets. Within moments, the four guards, the Andvarri, Tormel, and the merchants have all gathered near the central fire.

Yuri calls Tormel to the Company wagon, and discreetly shows him the corpse from the caves. "Keep your face neutral. Don't react. The implications should be obvious. This is life-and-death - I need to know what we're dealing with."

Tilara sits down on the ground beside the Company cart, leaning back agains the wheel while looking out over the camp.

Tormel nods, carefully bending over the corpse. He touches the bites. _Bled dry. Probably those overgrown flying insects._ He looks more carefully at the face. _That's Gerard. Hmmmm._ He looks back at the assembled group, and then down at the cave.

"The way I see it, Yuri, there are several possibilities. Would you like the probabilities too?"

Tilara says, "I would, even if he doesn't. Those little flying things nearly did me in, too."

Yuri says, "Consider it my lesson for the day, yes."

Yuri says, "And if you happen to have a means of... detecting whatever did this... I'd love to know about it."

"Aheam, well, yes. Indeed. Let me see." He looks at the corpse again. "Obviously, this could be Gerard's twin. Possible, but not likely. He was one of a set of triplets, but I don't think this is one of them." Tormel taps his chin again. "Of course, it could be magic. Some person who altered themselves magically; a spell like that will last for some time. Plausible, but still not possible. Or you may be dealing with one of those mythical beasts ... What's their name again. Excuse me."

Tormel flips through his journal. "No. I don't have the correct name. Sorry. But these are a group of people known for their ability to assume the appearance of others at will ..."

Tilara blinks. "Gerard is one of triplets?"

Yuri says, "Is there a means of detecting them? Color of their blood, anything like that?"

Tormel shakes his head. "No definitive methods are known no ....

Yuri says, "Lovely. Starguard, do you happen to have your truthsayer spell handy?"

Yuri rummages in his pack for the scroll case, and shows that to Tormel. "He was carrying this. I don't think it's safe to open."

Starguard says, "No. I don't. Sunrise, I will...but I don't think I want to sleep beside them tonight."

Tormel looks at the case, carefully. "No, on the whole, I think I would definitely recommend against opening that at this juncture." He hmmmms. "But I've seen them before ..."

Yuri says, "Where? Do the other merchants carry them?"

Tormel shakes his head. "I don't ... I don't remember. I'll have to think on it."

Yuri sighs.

Yuri looks over at the camp, looking for Gerard.

Gerard is sitting with the other three merchants, all four of whom look very perturbed.

Yuri says, "OK... we can call all four of them over, or we can call only Gerard over."

Yuri says, "I'm not sure what to expect in either case. I'm really hoping that this isn't the real Gerard or it's going to be exceedingly messy."

Tilara says, "Gerard, I think. If he really does have a twin... two twins? What do you call that? But there might be a way to tell them apart. Give him a chance to explain."

Yuri nods... "Andreth, please be so kind as to bring Gerard over here?"

Tormel looks at Tilara. "Actually, telling him apart from his sisters is easy. That's why the probability is so low."

Yuri just gapes at Tormel.

Andreth peers at Tormel quizzically, before standing up to bring Gerard over.

Tilara turns and blinks at Tormel. "Ah. That would make things easier, wouldn't it?"

Starguard looks starwards for insistance.

Gerard, escorted by Andreth, arrives at the cart. He looks right royally angry, which for him is rarely a stretch. "I demand an explanation!"

Yuri says, "Very well. Precisely what do you want explained, sir?"

Tilara says, "Funny... that's what _I_ was going to say, Gerard."

"We've been corralled, we've been herded, and you're treating us like criminals! And just when the tide was beginning to turn, too!" Gerard puts his hands on his hips and leans into Yuri's face. "We didn't hire you to boss us around."

Yuri pulls the tarp on the body aside. "Here's your damned explanation. Now perhaps you'd like to tell us a few things?"

Gerard leans forward, and gapes at the corpse. "I ... I ... he ... " He's struck effectively speechless.

Andreth, still standing behind Gerard, murmurs, "Y'see? Things ain't as they ought to be. So we're on edge."

Yuri says quietly, "I was hired to keep you safe. And I wasn't hired by you. I was hired by Minas Pjurin. As you can see, it's gotten a lot more complicated, so if I have to bring you all to Citadel in chains in order to keep everyone safe, then that's what's going to happen. Assuming that you are who you appear to be."

Starguard says, "I'd really like to know how come you're managing to be both dead and alive at the same time, Gerard. Because being dead and dead is much easier, logically."

Gerard jumps, as Andreth mumbles. His eyes are wide open, and he keeps looking back at the corpse in incipient panic.

Yuri flicks his eyes at Andreth. _Don't let him run._

Yuri pulls out the scroll case. "How about you tell me what this is?"

Gerard blinks at the scroll case. "Ummm ... a very nicely decorated scroll case?" He looks confused.

Tilara turns to look at the possible Gerard. Her brows draw together, puzzling at something....

Yuri says, "You know, Gerard, there's one thing about this whole arrangment that's been bugging me. The night you got into that fight, do you remember the one I'm talking about? Where Masci called you a son of a bitch?"

Gerard straightens up. "Yes. I remember."

Yuri says, "Why don't you tell me what happened next? Because you were gone for a while."

Gerard shakes his head. "I'm sorry; that's confidential."

Starguard says, "Not as confidential as you think, Gerard."

Tilara says, "You were followed, Gerard. Tell us who you were talking to."

Looking highly insulted now, Gerard glares at Tilara. "How dare you follow me! That was a business meeting! Between guild members!"

Yuri narrows his eyes, meaningfully. "What guild would that be, then?"

Tilara says, "In the middle of a forest? You're not the real Gerard, are you?"

"The Guild of Brewers, naturally! who else do you think I belong to." Gerard hisses, hands on hips. "Or do you think I'm a guild-turning traitor? Is that what this is about?"

Yuri says, "Go ahead, tell the lady what she saw when she followed you. Who were those other men she saw you with?"

Gerard growls. "Look, I'll tell you once, and once only, and then I'll lodge a complaint with Minas Pjurin and every CaravanSerai Master between here and Citadel. I met with fellow guild members. In the inn. I don't know what you're brabbling about forests."

Andreth shakes his head. "Ain't talking about that - there ain't nothin' wrong with that, ain't none of our business. We're talkin' about a different meetin', on the road."

Tilara sighs. "We were curious... and that was really your chance to establish your bona fides. You feign Gerard's mannerisms quite well, whatever you are, but ... humans tend to get pale when they're angry or frightened -" she breaks off as he _does_ finally react with fear.

Yuri narrows his eyes. "You just made a mistake."

Gerard shakes his head. "You're trying to trap me. That was the only ..." He stops, paling.

Yuri says, "Grab him!"

Starguard pulls back his cloak, crossbow pointed at Gerard.

Yuri steps up, but Gerard ducks under the sap, and twists away from Starguard's crossbow bolt, finally jumping over Stormy's burning hands.

Ash is ready, his two-hander lashing out through the evening air to carve a bloody trail through the surprisingly nimble merchant's belly. A good hit, but not a finishing one. The warrior swears quietly, readying his blade and feet to chase and strike again..

Andreth leaps in after the dodging Gerard, his fist flying, the ki nearly sparkling from his fist as it describes a graceful arc that passes right through the spot where Gerard had been.

Tilara scrambles to her feet and out of the way as combat erupts. "Harry! Perf! Stop him!" She stays back, looking for an opening for a spell, but sees none.

Ash follows his previous blow with an upwards swing, the edge of his weapon catching the merchant in a telling blow and leaving a great gash in his back. Already in motion, Ash seems intent on the kill now.

Starguard lines up his second shot, and with a twang the bolt whistles through the air. It catches Gerard square in the back, and he goes down with a cry.

Quarry safely down, Starguard quickly moves up to undo enough of the damage down so that Gerard won't bleed to death on the grass, and keeps an eye on the rest of the guards.

Yuri catches up to Gerard as he goes down. _Damn, I hope we're doing the right thing. If we aren't then we're in such amazing trouble. And if we are... well, it's just as bad._

Yuri says, "Right. Let's get him back and explain what's going on. Damn, I hate this kind of thing."

Meanwhile, Harry sends Perf over to investigate. Perf arrives, with sword drawn.

Ash heads off Perf, holding up both hands. "Hey hey, it's okay. We're gonna be coming back in a few moments..."

Perf holds up his sword, looking suspicious. "What happened? Where's Gerard?" Suddenly the sword shoots out, stabbing at Ash.

"What's going on!" Perf looks almost hysterical.

Ash dances out of the way quickly, his reflexes still hyped up on adrenaline. "Hey hey," he shouts, "Calm down!"

Starguard says, "Hold it! Gerard has a meeting with a pack of wolves. He's alive, but he tried to run."

Tilara says, "Perf, you _saw_ Gerard. He's dead. That's not the real Gerard over there."

Perf pushes forward, still swinging his sword wildly. "What kind of ... what the ... " He turns to face Tilara. "I don't understand. Gerard was running, and he's dead, and ..."

Tilara tries to calm the confused guard. "There's two of Gerard, Perf. The one we just chased down isn't dead - Starguard will put him back together if we need to. This one is dead. We need to find out which is the real one."

Perf shakes his head, lowering his sword. "Killing the merchants ... it's not _right_ ..."

Ash sighs. "WE didn't kill \`em. We uh.. wounded one, and found the other."

Andreth says, "We don't wanna kill 'im, Perf. Just keep 'im from running away, so's we can ask him what he's been up to."

"Wounding em's not right either. We protect, we serves, and we wenches. Where's the hurtin'?" Perf shakes his head, but backs off now. "Harry wants to know what's happening. Says the merchants is restless ..."

Yuri says, "We'll be going to talk to them all now, then. Let's bring both of the Gerards out and let everyone see what's going on."

Tilara says, "Bring them all over, Perf. We need to show them what's happened."

Yuri says, "I just hope these - things, whatever they are - don't work in packs. But they probably do."

Andreth laughs humorlessly. "They thought they was restless before, wait'll they get a load of these two."

Perf nods, relieved to have an obvious task. He runs off, and returns a minute or two later with the balance of the caravan.

Andreth indicates the surplus Gerards.

Yuri mururs to Tilara, "I think we can trust Perf. It's too hard to fake that kind of shock."

Yuri waits as the caravan is assembled. "I think that the problem here should be obvious. We've got two Gerards - one dead, one alive. The one that's alive, unfortunately, is probably not the Gerard we left Red River Town with." He pulls the scroll-case out. "Does anyone recognize this?"

Starguard says, "And for the record, we didn't kill the dead one."

Masci steps forward. "I do." He pulls a similar scroll case out of his tunic. "Each of us carries one."

Tilara nods. "This one was on the dead Gerard. I guess that proves which is the real one..."

Yuri says, "Dammit. I thought so. Then Gerard - the real Gerard is dead. This" - he indicates the wounded Gerard - "didn't recognize it."

Yuri glances at the faces of everyone in the caravan. _And he might not be the only one..._

Starguard says, "So on that note, would you all mind showing us your scrolls?"

Masci nods. "You've just seen mine." Engeram and Ymbert both pull out similar looking scroll cases.

Tilara says, "It looks like Gerard's the only imposter, then..."

Starguard says, "...of the merchants."

Stormy, meanwhile, produces a running translation for the Andvarri, who are looking both puzzled and worried.

Yuri says, "He might not have been the only one. We saw at least one other person leading Gerard - the real, dead Gerard - into the caves. Fortunately, we have a prisoner. That means that we're going to find out what's going on, very soon." He pauses. "So any imposters that want to identify themselves now can save themselves from a messy death later."

Everybody stirs, looking at one another. Harry, Dickon, and the three merchants all look very thoughtful. Jermiah and Perf, meanwhile, simply look confused.

Yuri says, "Nobody? Well, OK. I guess we'll find out in the morning. We apologize for the inconvenience, but I think you can understand, that we can't have anyone leaving the camp tonight on their own. Not for a walk, not to take a leak. So we'll be adopting a buddy system."

Yuri says, "In the morning we're going to ask everyone a few questions - including our new friend here - and then we'll be on our way."

Everyone nods, in a ragged unison. Already, people are beginning to partner up. The three merchants are clustered together. So are the Andvarri, naturally. Dickon moves closer to Harry, while Jermiah and Perf just look down ...

Harry speaks up. "Who's going to stand watches?"

Yuri says, "I think that we all are. I seriously doubt I'll be able to sleep tonight myself."

Starguard says, "I'll manage it. And Tilara needs it. We'll take morning watches."

Yuri works out a buddy system and a rotation of watches - Ash with Jeremiah, Andreth with Dicken, Harry and Yuri, and Perf and Starguard. Tilara, Tormel, and Stormy all buddy up with each other in the center of camp, along with the unconscious prisoner. The three Andvari each pair up with a merchant, and take secondary watches staggered to start halfway through each of the main watches, so that at least four people are awake at all times, and the transfer of the watches are staggered and harder to interfere with.

The night passes slowly. Everyone is jumpy, and twitchy, and those who aren't on guard take a long time to drop off. Still, sleep is a necessary part of existence, and slowly the camp quietens. The merchants, on watch, tend to spend most of their time jumping at shadows, while the Andvarri merely watch, and listen. The perimeter guard is staying remarkably close tonight.

Early during the last watch, when all has been quiet all night, Jermiah stirs. He rolls over, and nudges Perf. "I need the outhouse. I ... I can't hold it any longer." Together, they look at Starguard, as Perf offers to escort his friend.

Starguard shakes his head, and has the Andvarri go with him, holding Perf back. "Nothing personal, but he's going to make more noise if something goes wrong."

Perf awwws. "But ... I gotta go too! Won't this be faster?"

Starguard says, "What are ya, a bunch of girls? Gotta go in packs?"

Perf shakes his head. "But I gots ta go, and Jermiah gots to go, and we'd have to make too trips. Can't we just go together?"

Starguard says, "We'll all go then. Just to keep things friendly."

Perf nods. Grabbing a lantern, he and Jermiah head straight for the outhouses, letting Starguard follow as he will. As they walk, Jermiah keeps ribbing Perf about somebody's sister.

Starguard watches the woods, and the boys in front, worried.

The outhouses stand quietly; Perf nabbing the 'His' door and sticking Jermiah with the 'Theirs' door. Minutes later, Jermiah exits, belching. "Ah. Sometimes a man's just gotta, ya know." He turns to Starguard. "After you."

Starguard shrugs. "I'm fine."

Jermiah nods, as Perf exits too. Perf exclaims, looking in the underbrush. "Sir! What was that!"

Starguard blinks, his eyes suddenly heavy. "God, I'm beat. And I slept all night, too. Can you guys help me back to..."

Perf and Jermiah step up, carefully catching Starguard as he crumples to the ground. Then Jermiah arranges him, carefully, under some brush, to let him nap, while Perf creeps turns to the camp. He begins to chant again, softly, under his breath.

Meanwhile Thord and the Ymbert are watching the bushes intently. It's awfully quiet. They hear the chanting, but neither recognizes it. But it does make them feel sleepy. Sleepy ... Slowly they fall asleep, lying near the fire.

---

As the sun rises, Starguard wakens from a lovely nap, as do Thord and Ymbert. Thord jumps to his feet, yelling, while Ymbert faints dead away.

Starguard awakes, susprised to find himself under a bush, and then even mroe surprised not to be bound. he quickly runs into camp...

Karlsefnir rolls onto his feet, javelin in hand. He looks around intently, and then fires rapid questions at Thord.

Andreth is roused by the Andvarri's cry, and rolls out of his sleeping bag. "Whuh, wha?"

Tilara stirs at the shouting. "What? What happened?"

Yuri wakes up, hearing the commotion, and looks around.

The camp looks undisturbed. Nobody's hurt. But the prisoner is gone.

Starguard says, "Dammit, Jerimiah and Perf cast Sleep on me!"

Yuri takes a few seconds to catch up, and then starts swearing a blue streak in Lurinese. "Where the hell are they?"

Starguard says, "How should I know? Thord? Ymbert?"

Ash blinks lazily, rising as well. "Wha...?"

Yuri does a head-count, and looks at the wagons, and checks his own posessions to see what might be gone... then stops. "Starguard... how do we know that it's you?"

Starguard says, "Whitewash? Father Pesci? I know why we dislike dogs?"

Tilara says, "_Perf_ cast sleep on you? For pity sake, the man had trouble lacing his boots." She pauses. "A very good question. But where's Perf, Jermiah, and Gerard? If he's an imposter, why not just stay as one of them instead of imitating a spellcaster?"

###Editor : Reverse those....

Andreth rubs his eyes muzzily. "Maybe they got Perf 'n Jermiah too?"

Yuri says, "Get everybody up. We're going to assume that you're the real Brother Starguard, and you're going to cast the truthsayer spell on all of us. And we'll start by trying to lie. That will clear you, at least, and you question the rest of us. I'd suggest something to the effect of 'Are you the real John Doe, who left Red River Town with the White Company caravan?'"

Ash staggers to his feet, still trying to grasp all this. "Who got wha... oh shoot."

Tilara says, "Obviously, Andreth. Maybe the real Perf is still around somewhere."

Starguard says, "Right, I have to pray. Nobody trust anybody for a few minutes."

Ash reaches for his sword. "... Again?"

Yuri says, "If the Gods are merciful, some day, we will live long enough to be too old for this."

Starguard casts, a green light emitting from his hands, and you feel...encouraged to be less decietful than normal.

Everyone clusters together, keen to clear off suspicion. The questions fire fast and furious, but the upshot is that everyone proclaims that they are whom they appear to be.

Starguard rights, and asks the important. "So, does anybody know what the heck is going on?"

Tilara takes her familiar into her arms. "I'm going to the privy. Someone want to escort me?"

Masci shakes his head, speaking for the merchants, while Stormy eagerly volunteers to help Tilara.

Yuri sighs. "We're all here. They didn't bother to take anything, whoever 'they' are, except the half-dead Gerard imposter. They left us alive, which means they may have spared Perf and Jeremiah."

Tilara says, "If we can find them..."

Yuri says, "If they're alive, then they're probably holding them in those caverns." He pauses, then says in the general direction of the White Company, "I don't want to leave them behind."

Starguard says, "Alright, then. If you'll excuse me for a moment, I'm going to find out if the cats saw anything."

Yuri blinks. "Hey, do you think those cats can follow a scent?"

The cats look up at Starguard. Then, while the smaller one resumes grooming, the larger one blinks. "The bleeding one and the scentless ones traveled to the road."

Starguard nods. "Did they head back, or keep going?" he asks.

The cat blinks again. "Left where you returned, yesterday, with the bloodless one."

Starguard says, "Could you tell us if someone comes near without a scent? I'll make sure you get bigger pieces of chicken for meals."

Starguard rubs the feline ears to sweeten the deal.

The cat purrs, leaning into the rubbing. "Will hiss, yes. Attack?"

Starguard mmms. "Not right away. Thank you, friends. You've been great help. Is there anything you want?"

"Fresh kill. Hunt." The cat purrs, and the other one interrupts. "Want go hunt; miss hunting."

Yuri spends the time while Starguard is talking to the cats examining the campsite, making sure nothing is gone, or has been left behind. In particular he searches the area near the outhouses in case one of the attackers dropped something.

Starguard relays the info learned from the cats to the party, still rubbing the big cats ears.

Harry steps up to Yuri, his eyes darting from side to side. "Do we go on?"

Yuri looks at Harry. "If there's a chance they're still alive, I think we should try and get our men back. Don't you?"

Harry steps back. "Of ... of course. But who will guard the carts?"

Yuri says, "We can maybe use the cats to help us. If they have no scent, we can detect an imposter. And if they can tell that the wounded imposter had a scent, then they should be able to follow him into the caves."

Yuri says, "We have to poll the company, first. Does anyone not want to go and rescue Perf and Jeremiah?"

Tilara says, "We have to find them."

Ash nods. "That's how it works. I'd want you guys comin' after me.."

Masci speaks for the merchants, shaken as he is. "We vote to ... to spend no more than one half day. This camp site is evil."

Tilara gives Mascia a half-smile. "Can't argue with that. I don't want to do another night like last night..."

Yuri asks Karlsefnir, in A-isian. "Honor requires us to rescue our friends. Will you keep these others safe while we attempt?"

Karlsefnir nods. "Yes. We ... not help ... rescue?"

While Yuri's busy planning caravan defense, Ash tags Andreth, Stormy and Tilara and mumbles a few things at them, briefly..

Yuri nods to Karlsefnir. "I see. You want to be part of the rescue. We need someone else to watch the merchants; will you pick one to stay here with Harry?" He grins, slightly, and lowers his voice so only Karlsefnir can hear.

Yuri murmurs to Karlsefnir. "Some of the action may come here while we're gone. The merchants know that. Baa, baa..."

Karlsefnir nods. "Thord and Arnlaug stay; I come."

Yuri claps him on the shoulder. "I'm glad you're on our side. The Gods have mercy on the enemy, 'cause I won't."

Yuri gathers up his gear. "Masci... I know you don't like it here. But nobody is disposable to me. We'd be doing the same for you."

Masci nods. "Very well. We'll strike camp and be ready for your return."

Andreth leaves the discussion for a while to pray to Merial, for the soul of Gerard and the safety of our two missing companions.

After careful preparations, including new passwords and a short discussion with Tormel and the smaller of the two hunting cats, the party returns to the cave. Occasionally there's a single drop of blood on the path.

At the cave entrance the party pauses. Peering inside, they notice that everything looks just the way it was left the night before.

Yuri says, "I think I just felt... the geas..."

Starguard winces. "That would be it, yes. We can't turn from our path."

Ash scowls. "We're WORKIN' on it," he spits, speaking in a low voice.

Tilara winces as the geas washes over her. "I'm going to go back and back up the merchants. That's _very_ annoying."

Andreth looks uncertain, as his companions waver. "Should we all turn back?" he says.

Starguard says, "I think we have no choice. We could set the cats out hunting, but..."

Tilara says, "The geas is a bit too literal, but I think it's warned us for now. Go, find them. Hurry. "

Yuri says, "Geas or no. Nobody is expendable."

Yuri says, "We go on. If we can't continue because of the geas, then we did the best we could."

Andreth says, "Someone should escort Tilara back to camp, first."

Karlsefnir looks from face to face, confused by the pause.

Starguard says, "If anyone goes on, it gets worse and worse. It'll end when we turn back."

Yuri explains to Karlsefnir. "The Brothers of the Waters... in return for bringing Andreth back from the dead, we must find out about the Sa... one-of-the-forbidden-name... and if we turn aside from that mission, we suffer."

Tilara says, "Two. Else they can't come back, either. Stormy and Karlsefnir, for preference, they're not under the geas." She pauses. "Are you sure? It's not just a twinge? How about if we wait while the others search?"

Starguard says, "But...that should be it for the day... We shouldn't feel anything if we're on the road by tomorrow."

Stormy looks confused. "What if Tilara and Karlsefnir stay here? Someone should guard the cave entrance ..."

Yuri says, "I think we're already spread thin, Stormy. Besides, now we know... there's at least three of them, maybe four or more, and some of them are mages. We need all the help we can get inside."

Stormy nods. "I can see that. But that still leaves the entrance unguarded. What if ... what if they destroy the entrance?"

Starguard blinks. "He's got a point. If we didn't get on the road tomorrow..."

Tilara says, "Well, being trapped isn't the same as deliberately turning aside. If they crash the entrance, they'd have to have another exit, so you just need to find it."

Yuri says, "Sounds good to me. And we'll stick together. Leaving the entrance unguarded may not be the best idea but we're facing some bad odds anyway, it won't make it worse."

Stormy nods. "I'll help you back to camp, Tilara. Maybe Tormel could tell you a few stories?"

Tilara grins at Stormy. "Sounds like a plan."

Stormy and Karlsefnir escort Tilara back to the camp, where Tormel is badgered into making a comfortable bed in the cart for her. After which the two men rush back to the cave entrance, determined to make a good show of this.
