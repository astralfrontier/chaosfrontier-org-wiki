We last saw our intrepid band of heroes facing down four slavering wolves. But in the process Perf went down. Very down. Throat ripped out kind of down. The company is now pondering how to pick up the pieces, having wrapped the corpse carefully.

Starguard finishes wrapping Perf's corpse after taking one last look to make sure he's got all of him. "Right. Most I can do for now. What's up, Yuri?"

Yuri sighs. "He's not the only one who's died on this trip, you know. We didn't try nearly this hard for Gerard. And we didn't try at all for that fourth Andvari. We just left him to rot in a ditch."

Yuri says, "I'm not so much feeling bad that we're going to try for Perf, as that we didn't try for the others. I don't even know the fourth Andvari's name. Karl doesn't talk about him. I can't help but think they're hating me for killing him."

Yuri says, "I didn't really want to be responsible for people's lives, or deaths, Starguard. It's bothering me, a lot."

Yuri says, "You've seen a lot of both. What do you do when you realize you can't save everyone?"

Starguard shakes his head. "It was the army lad. You had to do triage. Save who you could, and your boys always to preference over the enemy. Sometimes you'd get someone who was savable, but you couldn't, because the time it would take would mean three others would die."

Yuri says, "You ever think that some of the people you saw die... that they would have been your friends, if it had gone another way?"

Starguard nods. "Lad. I had good friends die."

Yuri nods. "Well... thanks for listening."

Yuri walks away slowly, lost in thought.

Starguard turns away. "The Andvarri was an enemy at the time. Gerard was deep in a cave, far gone, and probably an enemy. We did the right thing."

Yuri turns back for a moment. "It's still not a decision I ever wanted to make."

Yuri says, "I guess not many people ever want to."

Starguard says, "No lad. But you've been doing a good job at it. That's why they all follow you."

Stormy watches quietly. _Did they worry about me like this? Is **that** why they adopted me?_ He looks pensive, as he takes up the reins on Gerard's wagon, and waits for the signal to move on, much like the other merchants are doing.

Tilara speaks up finally, after listening to the quiet conversation. "Those that want to make those decisions can't be trusted to do it. Who better than someone who worries about it?"

Yuri nods. "It's so perverse. I'd blame the Gods... but somehow I think that it's us, that made it this way."

Yuri says, "We should get moving."

Tormel looks over at Yuri. "But lad, we **are** the gods. Or the gods are us. Your choice."

Andreth has been lost in thought for this entire exchange, being a slow thinker, his only contribution to the conversation a slow nod now and again. He does blink curiously at Tormel as he puts in, though.

Yuri stares at Tormel for a moment, his jaw moving uncertainly. _No. Not ready for this today._

Ash is busy fiddling with the wagons, and says nothing. His face is hard and set; his belief has already been stated, and he sees no way to explain it any more clearly without repeating himself.

The caravan sets off uncommonly early, in the early dawn, the sun still rising over the horizon. Everyone is quiet: the three remaining guards are striding ahead, patrolling with narrowed eyes. The merchants look worried, and constantly look over their shoulders. But all is quiet: the day is dawn fair and sunny. Pushing the horses, the party arrives at Cariston shortly after noon.

_Cariston is a flat, flat ton, spreading out on both sides of the road. Few if any of the buildings are more than a story tall, and most of them come with small gardens attached. The people here are wearing simple clothes, embellished with some incredible embroidery, and the silver and iron work in their cloaks and pins is definitely noteworthy. Cariston must indeed be a ton of artisans. Protected under Citadel's umbrella, they prosper._

Yuri says, "Cariston. I'd hoped to stop here for a day, get us all some decent clothes before we hit the big city. But I think we're going to make this a short stop. Let's be moving again in an hour."

There are no walls to keep the caravan out, and no guards to challenge the party. A few children come running up, waving.

When asked, one of the children offers to lead you to the Silversmith. He's also the mayor, as it were. In as much as there is a mayor.

The silversmith looks up from his desk, when you are shown in. With a great look of relief, he closes what appears to be an accounts book, and invites you to sit. He listens intently to the tale, and accepts the letter gravely, reading it and then adding a few notes in the margin.

After that, he asks Yuri and Tilara a few simple questions about what has been happening on the trade road, nodding all the while, before finally offering his aid in any small endeavours. Jumping on the opening, Yuri explains that the company is hoping to dispose of a few simple assets and needs buyers. After establishing the precise definition of the assets the mayor nods, and sends Yuri and Tilara to a local merchant who handles in cloth.

Yuri considers a deal with the cloth merchant, who will give much more in trade goods than in cash. _I need to think of the items that would be most useful to the Company._

The merchant smiles as he sees the party coming. Showing everyone into a small tastefully decorated room, he carefully examines the contents of the chests you've brought. Finally, after working on a slate for a few moments, he smiles. "Gentlemen, lady, I can offer you a small fortune for these. In trade, naturally, gold coins are rarer and usually entail a small discount."

Starguard says, "Actually, there are some expensive herbs that would be useful if they could be acquired..."

The merchant nods. "Herbs ... herbs we have. We all keep little gardens, and there are some amazing herbalists in our little burg." His hands rub rogether eagerly ...

Yuri says, "Herbs, and fine jewelry. If coin is rare, perhaps we can negotiate a better exchanged for worked items?"

Tilara says, "Or for cut gems, perhaps? Things that are small and high value."

The merchant nods. "Certainly. Gems and jewellery are one of our specialties. We have a few sorcerors in town who work hard to enchant simple items that please the nobles. And with market day coming in two days, stocks are high."

Yuri says, "Sorcerors, you say?"

The merchant smiles. "Indeed. A few simple men, who live and make their living enchanting simples for the nobles. There are many fortunes to be made in simple rings that enhance one's beauty or perception."

Yuri murmurs to Starguard, "You know what we have to pull off with Perf. Anything we can do to make it more likely?"

Yuri says, "I think we'll take some of those. And I think we'll have to come back another day... I have a special project in mind."

Starguard says, "Yes, in fact. We need a large diamond. And more herbs..."

The merchant tilts his head. "Very well. Do you wish to choose, or shall I prepare a small selection for you? And can you enlarge upon this diamond you desire?" As he speaks, he has pulled out a card and is writing a few words on it.

Yuri nods, and turns back to the merchant. "Whatever the Brother asks for, then, including a diamond; and some of those rings; if there's anything left, then we can always use some liquid cash for Citadel."

Yuri thinks. _We might get luck here..._ "Would that have any rings for allowing people to communicate without speaking?"

The merchant blinks at Yuri. "Mind speaking? Those are exceedingly rare, and their cost vastly outstrips these few chests you show me today."

Tilara blinks at Yuri's request. "I could've told you that. It's a good idea, though."

Yuri nods. "Then for now, it is enough for me to know that such things exist. The minor enchantments concerning appearance and perception interest me. And I think that Miss Tilara and I would like to inspect the goods before accepting."

The merchant holds out the card to Starguard. "Here are directions to Hieron. He deals in herbs. He will give you any herbs you desire, to a maximum total of the agreed upon two thousand gold. Return with the signed card, and I will have a selection of gems and rings for you to choose from."

Starguard says, "Please make sure that we have a diamond in the 500 gold range. We need one of those."

The merchant nods. "I shall need an hour; I shall expect you then."

Yuri and Tilara spend the intervening hour talking with some of the locals. Tilara attracts the children, who in turn bring the parents, and while the children watch, Yuri engages the parents in conversation. To each person, Yuri puts the same question: where and who are the most powerful, most merciful, and above all most life-giving mages in the Citadel.

The answers he gets vary, and lead to each of the major temples in turn. Merial's temple is praised as she keeps the souls company while they wait to pass on. Lachlan, lifegiver, is praised as the lady who brings light and life into our lives, as is Sunni, the goddess who brings light to darkness and succour to the poor. But when the parents begin to discuss the question among themselves, they come to one unanimous conclusion.

Glia-Gulmeshki, Emperor, Beloved of the Gods, is surely the one Yuri seeks? For it is said that Glia-Gulmeshki holds the fate of every citizen in his hands. His is the court of last appeal, and the court of the first succour. He brings the peace into men's hearts and babes into barren women's wombs. And he, alone of all the gods and priests, does not require gold up front.

Yuri works hard to keep his face from shattering. "But of course! How could it be otherwise? I should have know all along!"

Yuri thinks, _Probably because I am, at heart, an optimist._

One of the older men chuckles. "Don't forget, lad, into His hands we commend our lives, and under His guidance we prosper."

When the group returns, Ash having joined them, the merchant accepts the card and reads it carefully, before smiling. "You've spent a fair amount on herbs. But I still have a few trifles for you." He opens up a small tray with flair. Inside, three rings are nestled in velvet, and a small collection of gems are placed enticingly. "These gems have not been cut yet, so that we can offer premium value. But first, I thought you might appreciate these three rings." He points out the first one, which is cunningly wrought in gold, with a pale amber stone. "This one, the best one here, is enchanted so as to enhance a person's physical beauty. It was commissioned by a minor Lady who wished to seduce a young man. Turns out she snared the man before she took the ring, and blessings upon her."

"These other two ... enhance understanding. The slim iron one allows you to convey meaning couched in seemingly irrelevant sentences. And this small silver ring, though not quite so powerful, makes its wearer uncommonly good at the art of bluffing." He fingers the gems. "I could find only one diamond of the size you requested: at four carats it is worth a little more than the price limit you set but I assumed you would prefer a larger rather than a smaller stone. These others are a collection of small gems, including topazes and spinels in a variety of colours.

Yuri eventually settles on giving up the Company's sapphire and necklace for the charm ring and the innuendo ring, and the large diamond; this in addition to the rare herbs that Starguard has already accquired.

Yuri blinks, seeing an odd aura around the rings. He shakes his head and it's gone. _What was that?_

The merchant smiles, obviously pleased with the trades. After a small bow, he invites the group to return, should they ever again have goods to ... dispose of.

---

Andreth pauses in his vigil over the mortal shell of Perf where it rests on the cart. A comment Tormel made earlier has finally got the better of his curiosity. He seeks out the scholar, and calls his name quietly.

Tormel looks up from his journal, in which he was scribbling notes. "Yes?"

Andreth asks, "This mornin' you said somethin... somethin about "We are the gods." What's that s'posed to mean? I thought the gods were..." He waves his hands vaguely. "well, _gods_."

Tormel smiles. "Well, yes, they are. But what is the child of a god?"

Andreth scratches his head, and thinks for a moment. "Uh, well, I guess a child of a god's a god too. Right?"

Tormel cleans under his fingernail. "So if a child is born to a child of the gods, what is he? Or she?"

Andreth puzzles. "I guess they're gods too..." he murmurs, hovering on the cusp of realization.

Tormel looks directly at Andreth. "Let me ask this a different way; how far can you trace back your family tree? Do you know who your first ancestor is? Or was?"

Andreth laughs a little. "Tormel, I don't even know who my parents was. But I see what ya mean... I had parents, and they musta had parents too..." His eyes go wide. "Wait... so you're sayin' if you go back far enough, we're all great-great-great-ekcetra-grandchildren of the gods?"

Smiling, Tormel opens his journal to an early page, and begins to read. "These were the children of Father Sky and Mother Earth, and they were Sunni and Muirwen, and these were the children of Father Sky and Mother Earth, and they were Lachlan, Potapka, Luriel and Lurithain. And from these children were born Agla, First Daughter, Wilthorwen and Kenilthwen, and from Lachlan and Father Sky were born Merial, and Limera and Ungfallen, and from each of these gods children were born, who bore children, who begat children, until this day." He smiles at Andreth. "We know we are the children of gods, for we carry their totems in our hearts."

Andreth nods. "Wow... never thought of it that way before..." He looks up again. "Totems? What's that?"

Leaning over, Tormel pushes Andreth on the chest. "In here, in a place where no one can see it, is your totem. Of all the gods, that god's blood flows most strongly in you." He shrugs. "Most people, nowadays, don't care. Or don't even remember. Much was forgotten after the war. But once, each child would go on a totem quest, to find out who they were, before ever they were called adults."

Andreth ahhs. "D'you know how these totem quests work? I think I wanna do that someday."

Tormel hmmms,and begins to leaf through his journal. "I have no ... definitive answer, Andreth. The few quests that have been recorded all differed substantially."

Tormel shakes his head. "No, I would need to do some reading. I've never been asked that question before. Ask me again tomorrow?"

Andreth nods. "I guess everyone's quest is different, right? Cos everyone's different." He bows. "Thank you, Tormel." He returns to his vigil, with a little more to think about.

Andreth keeps vigil solemnly, while the merchants refresh their horses. It's a day's drive from here, and everyone has agreed to push on tonight. And not just because Ash is a trifle intimidating on occasion. After the others return, the caravan gets back on the road, leaving a group of disappointed children behind in their wake.

Ash is still privately trying not to goggle too much at the sums of money changing hands. He's seen wagons loaded with trade goods frequently.. but never did they carry anything whose value in coinage crossed his hands, in any part or portion.

Tilara says, "There's not much point in arriving after dark. They lock the gates. Might as well camp for now."

Yuri says, "Then we'll camp here and plan to arrive early tomorrow." He turns to the surviving merchants. "I apologize for the pace of these last two days. We'll see you to your guilds by noon tomorrow, with luck; I'm afraid we can't say what arrangements, if any, can be made for the return trip."

The merchants circle their wagons quickly and efficiently, and soon the camp is made. After so many days on the road, the routine is well practiced.

Starguard puts the new herbs to good use, creating a powerful potion with the nights dinner, the smell of lemon filling the camp mingled with a thick beef stew.

Yuri seeks out Karlsefnir and speaks in A-isian. "Tomorrow we arrive in Citadel. It seems that we need to go to the Emperor to get help for our fallen man. You seek Zamua. Perhaps you would also like to speak to the Emperor?"

Karlsefnir nods, once, then tries to explain that he's worried about his appearance and those of his comrades. They will wear hoods, but ...

Yuri rubs his forehead, the burden of command weighing heavily. "We have our mission that we cannot ignore. And we have Perf to deal with. But if we believe that your mission is part of our mission, we can help you find Zamua. You already know who we seek. Is... She We Can't Name... related to the catastrophe you've come to warn us about?"

Karlsefnir shrugs. "We must ... must give message to Zamua. She will ... will know meaning. We hope. Or else all is doomed."

Yuri says, "I'll take it up with the others, then. Seeing the merchants to their destinations is easy. Our hirelings - Tormel and the guards - can take care of themselves, I'm sure. But your mission has more weight. Even though it is not easy, I think we should help you."

Karlsefnir nods. "We ... we thank you. We know only this. Zamua lives in the emperor's household, but is not his wife."

Yuri thinks, _I wonder if 'Zamua' is an alternate pronunciation of 'Potapka'._

Yuri says, "Then when we go to the Emperor's court, we'll look for such a person."

Again, Karlsefnir nods. "We will wait for you one day. And then we must go to find her."

Yuri discusses searching for Zamua with the other members of the Company. The mood is generally approving.

Ash gives his approval with most of the others, with reservations: "These guys basically came out of a bush with weapons. We've covered for them this whole way, despite the fact they won't tell us word one about the one damn thing we need to know about most.. Whether they find Zamua or not, though, if they need any help AFTER that, they'd better be ready to help us in return."

Tilara says, "Well, they have been helping as caravan guards. We'll see what happens when they talk to Zamua. Maybe she'll tell them to talk to us."

Yuri says, "I don't think that they know who she is... not entirely, anyway. But they say that Zamua knows what the threat is, the threat they're supposed to warn us about, and I think that it's the same threat that the Changers pose. And so maybe Zamua will also know who... she... is."

Tilara nods. "With any luck." She looks over at Gerard's wagon. "What are we going to do with that? Do you think that his Guild here will help?"

Yuri says, "Your point is taken. Once we're in Citadel, we're going to have to renegotiate who's protecting what. I'm feeling... stretched thin."

Yuri says, "Probably. This can't be the first time that it's happened."

Yuri says, "We can turn it over to the Brewer's Guild, and I'll keep my nose poked into it while we're in the city, to keep the Guild honest."

Yuri says, "I don't want Minas Pjurin and our other backers to think that we leave a job half-done. And I've little patience with corrupt guilds interfering with my life."

---

In the morning, camp is struck quickly and efficiently. The caravan returns the road one last time. Arriving at the Mar gate, the wagons are briefly assessed, and the merchants are carefully questioned, before everyone is permitted in. A bored looking sergeant unrolls a piece of paper and reads, monotonically, the usual list of warnings about behaviour in the city. Citadel is a truce town, above all. Fighting between citizens of the various princedoms is not permitted and is punishable by fines, banishment, and death. The warnings boil down to a simple "Don't pick fights, don't cheat anyone, and if you're sick, get help before it becomes an epidemic. There are free clinics available." The corpse doesn't raise a single eyebrow.

Yuri thinks, _Well, here we are. Wish I had less on my mind so I could enjoy it._

The White company spends the morning dropping off the various merchants at their guild houses. As each one is dropped off, he pays the balance of the caravan price in gold. Last to be dropped off is Gerard's wagon, at the Brewing Guild. The Guild Master accepts the wagon, and Gerard's letter of mercantile, personally, and agrees to speak with Yuri again once the contentshave been assessed and sold. Before Yuri leaves, the Guild Master gives him a small sack of coins, gruffly explaining that the letter lists this as the caravan's price.

Now that the caravan has been reduced to a single wagon, the company searches out a small hostelry. Located halfway between the inner and outer walls, the hostelry is small and clean, but not excessively expensive. And they can easily stable the single wagon and the horses.

Yuri pays the final week's wage to the surviving guards, doubling the amount as a bonus, and presents each with a letter of reference. "For a job well done. We're going to see what we can do for Perf. I'd appreciate it if you stuck around town for a few days. You're his friends. Your presence might be important if we find out that there is something we can do."

Yuri sets 20gp aside for Perf. _Compared to what raising him will cost, I won't begrudge him this small amount. Or his family's, if we can find any._

Harry nods. "We'll be stayin' in the serai. There's always work for guards there. We'll look for a local contract first." Each of the guards pats Perf's corpse on the shoulder, awkwardly, and then Harry nods once more. "We're grateful for what you're doing."

Yuri nods, quietly. "You're welcome. Thank Ash, also."

Starguard says, "Right. Enough of the goodbyes. There's work to be done."

Harry nods, and turns to Ash. "We ... we all hope things go well with you. You've been better'n most. Come down to the serai, and we can hoist a tankard together. Perf would have liked that."

Ash nods in agreement. "See you fellows soon."

Finally, Yuri pays 20 gold coins to Tormel. "For the final week, and for a fair bonus. We're going to be a few days, finding out what happens next. I'm sure a man like yourself can find all sorts of things to do in Citadel; my favorite would be finding a buyer for the hunting cats, like we agreed. After that, if you can stay over the next few days, we can discuss further engagement. Frankly, I think your services are well worth it, but it's just too early in the day to know what we're doing next... and you might not like it."

Tormel nods. "I will be back tomorrow night, with buyers. And the information Andreth requested, if it can be found. Will you be here?"

Yuri says, "If it goes as we wish, yes. If not, we'll try to leave a message."

Tormel nods. "Keep the cats in your room, and well fed. They will not take to strangers easily; there are too many here."

Yuri says, "Tormel... one last thing... I don't suppose that you already know who Zamua is, do you?"

Tormel shakes his head. "No; the name doesn't ring a bell. But ... will you be here tonight? I may know by then." He pauses, as though to calculate a reasonable fee, then shrugs. "Our contract will run out tonight at midnight."

After satisfyingly hot, long baths the party sets out on a quest for finery, carrying fiery brocade with them. The white silk remains in the room, while the party debates exactly what to do with it.

Finding clothes to wear is fairly easy, there's an endless supply of urchins willing to point the group in the right direction for a copper or two. Soon everyone is wearing clean neat outfits, suitable for dealing with a merchant or meeting an emperor. Assuming he doesn't look down on his poorer citizens.

Gathering the silverware, the party drops it off at the address they've been sold, where the butler gladly takes delivery, handing over a full pouch in payment.

At this point the company is flush with funds, and neatly dressed. And special tunics have been commissioned for Stormy and Tilara, to be ready tomorrow afternoon. Stormy is overwhelmed with the new clothes and the promise of a grand tunic. He blushes all evening long, and can frequently be seen caressing his new cloak.

Ash looks distinctly ill at ease, though somewhere along the line he's had enough apparent instruction to carry himself in his new garb.

Andreth looks even more out of sorts in finery, but he covers for it as best he can by carrying himself with good posture, like Brother Oak taught him. That, and not speaking unless spoken to, should get him through an audience with an emperor. He hopes.

After a satisfying day shopping, the company spends the evening relaxing in the common room. Yuri brings out one of the company's kegs, and tells the barman the party, that night, is on the house. Or at least, on him. The barman purses his lips, counting lost income, but finally nods, frowning. He seems somewhat less than keen on the idea.

In the evening's festivities, all are merry, and Yuri cunningly worksthe conversation around to the topic of the emperor. A topic everyoneenjoys talkin about. Wh, it was not yet a year ago that the emperor hosted great celebrations in honour of his daughter Potapki. Great feasts were served, kegs of ale were broached in great quantities, and tourneys were held were prince and peasant alike could parade his skill.

The bartender, meanwhile, having been pacified with the offer of the second keg, smiles. He pushes forward one man. "Go on, Jormik, tell 'em how you bested the emperor hisself at wrestlin'!"

Yuri listens carefully. _This man has met the Emperor. This is what we need to know._

Jormik makes himself comfortable on a bench, drinking deeplybefore wiping off his mouth. He's a big man, and muscled. Twice the size of Big Joe. And he looks more intelligent too. "Well now ... well now ... ye can say I wasnae the one to defeat him, for wasn't I the last in a row of a hundred men ta wrestle him? 'Twas luck as much as anything. But when I threw him, and subdued him, he gave me the prize right nicely: that purse held enough to see both ma daughters dowered, and wed, and one's already carryin' a bairn. Anda year ago they had nae prospects. None. 'Tis a fine lord, is our Emperor. A fine lord. Doesn't look a day older'n forty, no matter what they say."

A second fellow nods. "Aye. And he judged the women's contests fairly too. Anne, as lives two blocks over, makes the best ale man's ever tasted. She took't gold ribbon, there. And he orders a keg brought to palace, weekly. She's a rich lady now; meat seven days a week and schoolin' fer all her bairns."

A third man, barely more'n a boy, nods. "And remember the archery contest? We all thought the lord would take it, but lord love if his son, the one as he wasfeudin' with, didn't shoot the final arrow right in't middle. And never a complaint. He clapped him on back, and called him finest archer, and they drank a toast to the babe together. Not that th'babe noticed, mind, that her brother was so fine. She slept right though't."

Tilara chuckles. "Aye, babes do that a lot, don't they?"

The boy nods again. "Me sis says a good babe sleeps night and day, and the little one was one of the best. And Marilan'sa fine breeder. Popped t'bairn out after only eleven months of wedlock. There'll be more comin' there, mark my words."

Yuri grins. "More names at the base of the Emperor's Spire, yes? Which makes me wonder... what of the others? What news do the obelisks bring from far-off lands?"

Jormik snorts. "Them spires is as good as tea leaves. Or as useless. Ye dinnae know what the words mean, till the time's passed tae act on 'em. But aye, princesnear pissed their pants when the little bairn's name appeared on the spire. Ye'd think they was afeared for their very lives, the way they carried on. And all the plottin' and conspirin','twas enough to make a common man sick tae his stomache. Poor Lady Marilan. 'Tweren't no way ta treat a woman freshly wedded."

One of the others chimes in. "Aye. 'Tweren't nae way at all, claimin' she wasjust a peasant lass, and none too good for her lord, and he oughter hae just bedded her and be done with it. Them princes is gettin' uppiterever' year.

Yuri says, "Eh? What do you mean, no way to treat her? Did the Princes try to pull something?"

The bartender grins. "Can ye blame them? Seventy years, since the lad's've been back, and the old man shows nae sign of agin'."

Jormik nods, soberly. "Twas all over't city, how princes claimt an emperor couldn't marry a fine farmin' lass such as she. Had her tested for sorcerous skills, and claimin' she'd seduced him through magical means. And she stood for it, and took it, and told 'er lord 'twas right to let 'is sons care about him. Pish tush. 'tSons 're jest waitin' for the old man ta keel over."

Yuri says, "Well, that was the marriage, and the birth of Potapka. Do the Princes see no threat in the fourth spire? They don't even know what the words on it mean!"

The second man nods. "And the joke's on princes now. Fine bairn she carried, and nae doubt she'll carry more. Word's out the emperor's considerin' recarvin' the princedoms ... Word is he's gettin' right fed up. Canst blame him?"

A stranger, standing furtherback, spits on the ground. "What words? There's only one, and it has nae meanin' known tae man. Th'Emperor hisself has said the time will come when the meanin' will be revealed, but we all know what that means!"

Yuri says, "It means... 'Hands off, ye lot'?"

Yuri grins. "'Because I don't know, either?'"

The man smirks. "Aye. Th'emperor's not all knowin'. If he were, he'd ne'er ave ad to banish 'is sons in't first place."

Andreth nods to himself, smiling as he remembers Tormel's words. Truly, men and gods are kin after all. Perhaps even the older gods do not know for sure what is to come...

Ash stirs from his silent abstraction, giving voice to a question whose unasked contemplation etched itself into a curious expression on his face for several minutes prior. "How did the Emperor meet his wife?"

Jormik settles himself down, at Ash's question. "Aye, and therein lies a fine tale. Our lord was hawkin' as he likes ta do when the weather's fine, our in Celae, near the Reshki border. And 'thawk, spyin' what it thought was a fine furry rabbit, dove down as ahuntin' hawk will, and tried tae snatch the rabbit. But 'tweren't nae hare, down there, 'twere a young miss wearinga leather cap she'd skinned and tanned and sewed 'erself." Jormik takes a long draught from his mug, while someone else takes up the story.

"Right gory, 'er face was. Hawk's claws scratched all over. And bleedin' ... so th'lord came, and followed 'is 'awk, and sawwhat 'e'd doneta the poor girl, and hops off 'is 'orse and vows ta pretect 'er and 'eal 'er an and all." Everyone in the bar pauses, and raises their tankards to their beneficent lord.

Yuri follows suit. _I might end up liking this Emperor, and what a fine mess that will be._

Ash obeys the common trend, nodding in quiet consideration as he listens.

"And 'e carried 'er, back to tent, where 'is 'ealer said 'tscars were permanent. Guards found the girl's father, who was 'orrified at her face, and cast 'er off, on account of her never marryin' now. And this so angered th'emperor, he told 'er da, 'e'd see 'er married 'isself, to a man of fine standin'." The man grinned. "And so 'e carried 'er back 'ome, and by time they was 'ere, they was like two little lovebirds, oblivious to t'world. Th'scars never 'ealed, but what matter now?"

Andreth chuckles as he sips from his mug. "Keeper of oaths he is, 'struth."

Jormik nods. "She's a fine lady, and carried a good bairn tae term, on't first try. Th'scars dinna make her; no matter 'ow much they pains 'er stepsons."

The stranger in back of the hall stands up. "A toast tae the Scarred Lady! And may any man 'o calls 'er ugly die of a thousan' rottin' sores!"
