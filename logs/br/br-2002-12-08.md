# Birthright 2002-12-08

After an evening spent sharing the fruits of their labours with the locals, the party wakens in the morning with somewhat heavy heads. All but Brother Starguard, who spent the evening creating, rather than imbibing, potions. Stormy, eager to get his new tunic, is the first to be awake, banging on doors to waken everyone else.

Starguard is up, having given his morning prayers, and quickly corrals Stormy before he gets himself killed by the hungover. "C'mon, Stormy. Let's let them come awake slowly, and we'll go down to eat and head out early."

Tilara opens one eye and looks at Mirra, who looks back disdainfully. _You smell of nasty grasswater._ Faced with such a complete lack of sympathy from her familiar, she decides she might as well get up.

Yuri awakens, and feeds the cats first thing. _We'll end up owing Tormel... but perhaps it would be better to pay him off and give you both to the Emperor. He might apprecaite the gift, considering what we're asking for._

A burst of profanities, not at all shielded or weakened by the door, is all that Stormy receives from Ash for a few minutes. Finally, he too rises and staggers out.

Andreth, his morning meditation hampered somewhat by the little men with hammers jumping up and down on his head, staggers out of the room looking a little bleary. "Right... oof. Which way to breakfast?"

Stormy grins, bouncing in his eagerness to get moving. "Downstairs! Can't you smell the bacon frying?" He sniffs, appreciatively. "And the fresh bread?" Soon, he's gone downstairs.

Tilara looks sympathetically at Ash as she opens her door. "I think he took the talk about keeping a clear head a little too seriously."

Slowly but surely the party gathers in the dining room, where generous portions of breakfast are served out to all. Accompanied by your choice of tea, water, or ale. Stormy, grinning cheekily, takes a tankard of ale, but most of the party restrict themselves to water. After a slow breaking of their fast, the party feels a lot more awake.

Yuri sits quietly, thinking, and then speaks. "You know... it will cost us, because we promised Tormel that he could sell them... but we might be better off to give the cats to the Emperor."

Ash remembers the promised price, and eyes Yuri speculatively. "That's a hell of a gift," he mumbles. "Why the cats, as opposed to some of that jewelry?"

Tilara chuckles. "It would certainly be unusual. Might make us stand out a bit. It would cost us, though, we'd need to give Tormel his commission, plus we wouldn't get the money from selling them. But it'd cost us for any gift worth giving to the Emperor."

Yuri says, "Think of what we've heard of the Emperor. I do not believe he would care much for things that have no value other than money."

Yuri says, "He's a hunter and a sportsmen. The finest hunting cats in the plains would be worth more to him than the gold that they'd bring."

Starguard nods. "Would make a great impression."

Yuri says, "You know what we're going to be asking him for. I reckon that it might be just about the right price."

Tilara nods. "Let's do it that way, then."

Andreth scratches his head. "How'll we do it, then? I don't think they're gonna let us bring the cats inta the audience room wi' us..."

Ash nods slowly, realization dawning. "Yeah. But can I offer a suggestion? Can we at least do a bit of digging to see who might have sold those cats, before we unload 'em?"

Yuri says, "Well, we can ask him when he comes back. You know Tormel. He'll be back for his gold."

Tilara says, "No, but we can leave them with the huntmaster, I would think...." She pauses at Ash's comment. "That ... is a very disquieting thought. Could it have been anywhere around here? Could you talk to them again, Starguard?"

Yuri says, "They're as tame as kittens when leashed Andreth. At the rate we're going they might mistake us for circus folk, anyway. And what's a circus without dangerous animals?"

Yuri says, "Sorry, Til, did I miss something? Could what have been anywhere around here?"

Tilara says, "Could they have been trained around here."

Starguard nods. "I'd need another day though. You have to give me a morning's notice about magic."

Tilara nods. "We'll need at least a day to poke around and see how one gets an audience with his Majesty, anyway, I'd think."

Starguard says, "Personally, I'm willing to bet that the owner would be at court anyway. You'd need a lot of money to own cats like that."

Yuri says, "I don't think they could have been trained here. They were trained by Changers, we know for sure, and those are mountain cats. I don't think you'd get changers, mountains, and cats around here that easily."

Tilara says, "If you were a city lad, yes. If you were a Stormwinder?"

Yuri says, "Well, perhaps. But they came from the burning feather, yes? If that's true, it means that all those portals we've seen have been the doings of the Stormwinds and not the Changers."

Andreth scratches his head, looking lost. "How d'we know the portals are the Stormwinds' doin'?"

Tilara says, "We don't really know either way. We've been making working assumptions, but it's best not to get too convinced of what we think we know."

Stormy follows the conversation attentively, sitting quietly. _A tunic! In brocade! I'm going to have my own tunic! Wheeee!_

Yuri says, "I guess, come to think of it, we don't know. But if the Stormwinds and the Changers are both involved... well, we have no evidence of the first, and plenty of the second. We'll deal with one foe at a time."

Ash shrugs slowly. "Couldn't hurt to at least ask," he murmurs. His thoughts have been trailing ahead of the conversation, playing out his half-formed vision of what a meeting with the Emperor will be like.

Tilara nods, though her expression is worried. _If they **let** us do it that way..._

Yuri nods. "Well, we'll wait a bit until Tormel shows. Then I'll go and try and get the Chamberlain to put us on the Emperor's audience schedule. It would be better if some of you went with me, so that we can look more impressive."

Yuri says, "Otherwise, they'll just take our letters from Major San and turn us out on our ears. Which I suppose wouldn't be bad, but it would be harder to find healers for Perf."

Tilara says, "I don't think I have anything else to do today. Anyone else?"

Speaking of the devil, Tormel - in a brand new scholar's gown - enters the dining room just then. He smiles, seeing the party, and steps forward. He looks a lot less ... hungry ... now. Sitting down at the table, he pulls out his journal and turns to face the party. "I was sent on three quests. To find a buyer for the cats, to learn about Zamua, and to learn of the totemquests. I have a few answers." He smiles, lopsidedly. "And a possible offer of employment. I should have moved years ago."

Andreth shakes his head. "Nope..." He'd hardly know where to even _begin_ in a city this big.

Yuri nods. "Well, let's hear it, and let's hear any prices involved."

Tilara grins. "Lots of opportunity here. They just play rough sometimes."

Tormel nods. "In that order, I have two competing bids for the cats. The one offers cold hard cash, the other contracts and trade goods. I have also discovered who Zamua is." He smiles. "Given your desire to meet the emperor, you will be pleased to know, I'm sure, that Zamua is the lady into whose care the young princess has been given. With her mother's oversight, of course. As for totem quests ... " He smiles, apologetically, at Andreth. "I was informed by a lady priestess of Merial's that the answers differ person by person, and that she would be happy to discuss the particulars with you." He pats his robe contentedly. "These questions I answer free of charge."

Andreth nods to Tormel. "Thanks," he says, with a grateful (if still lopsided) smile.

Yuri says, "Two competing offers... Tormel, you should know that we've been considering paying you your fee, and then giving the cats to the Emperor, as a gift, for which we hope he will grant us a boon. Or at least take the sting out of the price."

Yuri says, "What would the cash offer have been worth?"

Tormel tilts his head. "Prince Lurin offered eleven hundred coin. Gold coin. Lord Mirrimay offered ... well, that offer is harder to price."

Yuri coughs. "PRINCE Lurin?"

Yuri says, "And the other... Lord Mirrimay... Lord of where?"

Tilara says, "Probably not in our interest to take that one anyway. We... are not completely free to move as we want. Prince Lurin? My, my... this could complicate matters. Would he likely be at court?" She shakes her head. "Doesn't matter, he'd know sooner or later."

Yuri says, "Umm... well, Ash? You were interested in knowing who would buy such beats."

Tormel nods. "Yes, Prince Lurin. He makes his home here, almost year round, and is quite fond of hunting animals. He spends much time with his sister."

Tilara says, "Spends a lot of time with the princess, does he? I'd certainly not want there to be a hunting accident that we'd be connected to..."

Tormel digs out his notes. "And Lord Mirrimay is a favoured grandson of Prince Mirrimor. He represents his grandfather at court."

Starguard whistles. "Big hitters..."

Tormel nods at Starguard. "Cats such as these do not come cheap; they are used by the armies, and as pets by the rich." He smiles again. "Lord Mirrimay offered me a position in his household ... He has two daughters of teaching age."

Yuri says, "That's quite impressive, Tormel, to have found such distinguished buyers on such short notice. Do you suppose he'd still extend that offer even if he doesn't get the cats?"

"I don't know, Yuri. The offer was not conditional ... It seems he has had words with Zamua, and does not wish to hire from the usual place." Tormel shrugs. "I will serve a seven day, and we shall see how it goes. I start tomorrow."

Starguard smiles. "Congratulations, Tormel. It's a very prestigeous position."

Yuri nods. "In that case, would you excuse us for a moment? I need to poll the Company on an issue."

Tormel's lips twist. "Or else a very dangerous one." He shrugs. "Still; Berina should expect some competition, now that her market has grown so large ..."

Yuri says, "Oh, no. Berina?"

Starguard blinks. "What does Zauma have to do with Berina?"

Tormel nods. "Berina runs the College of Accomplished Students. She places all the governesses and tutors. Zamua was hired on her recommendation, after much consultation with the emperor."

Starguard says, "So Zauma is the Princess's tutor?"

Tilara says, "I take it that there was some ... disagreement with the Princes on that issue?"

Yuri holds his head in his hands as if to keep it from falling apart. "You know, when they executed those shapeshifters, I didn't know which way to feel that it wasn't the real Berina."

Tormel shakes his head. "Oh no. Most of the princes approved. The College has been educating them and their children since it was first formed." He smiles, slyly. "But rumours suggest Lord Mirrimay was unhappy that she would not have him. And so he seeks ... alternatives."

Yuri says, "Tormel, if you're competing with Berina, I really hope you're up on arcane herbology. And you may wish to talk to Starguard about a preparation for use when having tea with dangerous ladies."

Andreth drinks some more water, looking more out of his depth than ever.

Tormel blinks at Yuri, then looks uncertainly at Brother Starguard. "You imply that ... Surely she cannot harm me, when she is not even in town?"

Tilara says, "She doesn't have to be personally present to arrange things, I suspect. And there's no guarantee that she won't return."

Starguard says, "I'd be cautious. She seems to be a rather...ruthless lady."

Ash nods along, lifting another mug to his lips - but this time, he pauses to glance down warily at it before drinking.

Yuri says, "She will be back, Tormel. And while Berina is arguably one of the two most fascinating women I have ever met, it is not for her face that I would never take my eyes off her for a moment."

Tormel nods, gulping. "Well, the contract is signed. I serve a seven day." He looks a lot less cocky now, though, and calls for a tankard of ale to soothe his suddenly dry throat.

Yuri says, "As to the cats, I think it best that we give them to the Emperor. I'd like to poll the Company on that matter."

Yuri takes a quick vote while Tormel is at the bar, and also asks for a suitable fee to pay him.

It is agreed to pay Tormel 330 gp, and one of the potions that Father Pesci gave the White Company to deal with Berina.

Tormel accepts the gold and the potion, his eyes widening. "I see. You have other plans for the cats ..." He straightens his shoulder, and carefully puts the pouch away. "I will be at Lord Mirrimay's, if you have further questions ..."

Starguard says, "Tormel, we could use your help on getting an audience with the emperor. And presenting the cats to him..."

Tilara smiles at the sometimes stuffy scholar and gives him a quick hug. "Take care of yourself, okay?"

Tormel hugs Tilara back, and then his hand steals back to the pouch. He gives a strong impression of not having seen quite so much money in his possession all at once. "I will, Tilara. And Starguard; I may be able to introduce you to the Secretary to the Assistant of the Chamberlain. He was an old ... study partner of mine."

Yuri raises his eyebrows at SG, more in surprise, than alarm. _Hadn't considered that angle, old man._

Starguard says, "We'd appreciate any help you could give us, Tormel."

Leading the party to the castle gates, Tormel speaks a few words to the captain stationed there. They are all admitted, under the limited escort of a single smartly dressed soldier, who leads the way. Soon, the party is ushered into a small office in a hallway of offices filled with bustling clerks. The clerk looks up, at the party crowding into his office. When Tormel is introduced by the soldier, he smiles, coming to his feet. Tormel quickly explains the errand, and the man nods.

The emperor, it appears, holds open court once each seven days, and the next open court is to take place in two days. The morning is always reserved for appointments, while in the afternoon the emperor will see all who come, until the hour of seven, at which point he retires to spend time with his beloved wife and daughter. "How may I be of service?" the man inquires, after explaining this.

After a brief conversation with Yuri, the man nods. "There is an early morning appointment open with the Chamberlain; I shall pencil you in for that." He writes a small card, and gives it to Yuri. "Present that to the Chamberlain. He will decide if you see the emperor."

Starguard nudges Yuri, reminding him of the difficulty of the hunting cats.

Yuri says, "We have a gift for the Emperor. Two large cats of exotic breeding. Can we make arrangements with the Chamberlain about those? We would prefer to present them personally."

The man nods. "Good, good, gifts, good. Yes. Bring them to the gate. The guards shall watch them; if the Chamberlain approves they shall be brought to you."

Yuri nods.

There's a definite suggestion that this man, too, would like a little gift. Although he's not making an issue of it, with his friend here ...

Yuri sighs as they leave the vice-chamberlain's office. "Well... how about the Spire, then? That's allegedly why we're here. And it will be two days before we can get in front of the Emperor. We'll need to tell the Andvari we know who Zamua is, and we'll need to keep poor Perf fresh."

Yuri says, "But for now... maybe we should do what we came to do."

Ash nods in agreement.

Tilara says, "Not a bad idea, that. Shall we go now? Or do you have to refresh that spell first, Starguard?"

Starguard shakes his head. "Tomorrow morning. This is the third day of the spell."

Yuri says, "Then let's be off. I don't know what we expect to find... perhaps the Gods will give us a sign, since we've been so gratifyingly amusing."

Tormel excuses himself, and the soldier escorts everyone to the gate first, so that Tormel can reenter the city proper. Then, with a smile, the young soldier leads the party to a large walled garden. He's become more talkative now that the party appears more bent on pleasure, and less on business, pointing out the barracks, and the Clerk's Hall, where you've just been. And as the party follows him, they notice other groups, each escorted by a soldier. Each soldier dressed as finely as this one.

Tilara drifts to the front of the group to bestow a smile on the young soldier. "Have you been here long?"

The young soldier smiles back, and nods. "Born and bred to the service, ma'am. Dad was a soldier, grandad was a soldier, great grandad was a soldier; we fought in the war in his home guard."

Yuri says, "We were wondering... where at the Four Great Spires? Some of us have interests in history."

Turning to look at Yuri, the young soldier points at the walled garden. "In there sir. Everyone comes to see those. We'll be there in but a moment."

At the walled garden, the party encounters a second guard, standing next to a small shed. He springs to attention when he sees the party approach. Beside you, your escort requests that you leave your weapons with the guard. The garden hosts treasures large and small, he explains, and fights have been known to break out in the past, so that the emperor has now decreed that fights shall be settled by means of fists, only.

Yuri says, "I'm... surprised. What would one fight over? All of these belong to the Emperor, right?"

Starguard says, "Meaning, Yuri. People can be passionate about knowledge."

Starguard hands over his morning star and crossbow.

The young soldier shrugs. "A Lurinese argues with a Mirrish-man over the meaning of a phrase. A Fallan-man argues with a Cala-isian over the placement of a royal gift. A scholar argues with a scholar ..." His eyes twinkle. "And those are the worst fights, by far. Blood has fallen, on the spires."

Tilara says, "And if a pickpocket comes to see them and plies his trade while he's there, things can heat up rapidly. That was always a problem with our performances... we had to watch out for them, lest the townsfolk blame _us_ for their home-grown criminals."

The young soldier blushes. "Well yes. But we do try to keep the riffraff out." He smiles. "As young nobles such as yourself must surely appreciate ..."

Yuri glances at Tormel, then hands over his weapons. _They have their own world. And judging from Berina, a nasty one it is._

Yuri starts for a moment when he realizes what the soldier has just said, but takes it in stride - he smiles and winks discreetly. "The line between nobility and riff-raff is in the heart. Right, Ash?"

Tilara hands the guard her quarterstaff and belt dagger (not having brought the heavier weapons along today). "I understood that the commoners were allowed here as well, though?"

Starguard says, "Not at the same time. It's tiring on the eyes to look down one's nose all the time."

The young soldier nods. "Of course ma'am. Of course. The gardens is open to all. But the riff raff don't like to be watched, ma'am. They take ... offense." He sounds shocked at the notion of barring the gates to any man. Or woman.

Tilara chuckles at Starguard. "You never met my cousin, though. He could keep it up for weeks without any strain at all."

Yuri says, "Right. Well, we're here. Let's see what all the fuss is about, then."

Tilara nods to the soldier. "I see. That is a good point, isn't it? That sort prefers to hide."

Andreth chuckles at the point-counterpoint, but otherwise stays silent. What is he going to say, after all?

The young soldier nods, having watched everyone deposit their weapons. "We've found, ma'am, that those who dislike being watched bear watching the most, as I'm sure you appreciate. Now, shall we step inside?" He opens the gate, and with a royal wave invites everyone inside.

The gate opens in the centre of one wall, leading into a large almost square garden; the garden is a place of much magic; it is divided in four quadrants, whose edges can easily be discerned. In the northern quadrant - the far left corner - snow lies heavy on the ground, and two boys are having a snowball fight under the watchful eye of a soldier and a young woman. Probably their governess. In the southern quadrant, to the left of you, the air feels warm, and the scent of summer is in the air, whilst the scent of early spring comes from your right. And in the western quadrant the plants of autumn bloom.

Starguard's jaw drops. "By the Stars..."

In each of the quadrants, near the centre, a spire stands. Three stand tall; reaching some four stories in height, and ladders on wheels are provided for scholars who wish to read the upper words. The fourth spire is surrounded by a small fence, to avoid trampling on it.

Yuri thinks, _Four seasons... four tribes of Gods... four spires..._

Ash's eyes open in shocked surprise; even what he's seen so far provides no buffer for such a scene.

The young soldier grins, watching the party take it all in. "I see you've not been here before."

Tilara shakes her head, stunned even past a performer's ability to recover from surprises. "The stories don't do it justice... and I thought they were exaggerations."

Starguard says, "The Gods have glorious works, don't they."

Andreth takes a few steps forward, looking up at the taller spires. "Wow..." is all he can say.

The soldier grins. 'It's funny; really. When people tell of the garden; nobody believes them." He nods at Starguard. "Our emperor is a powerful man. When people walk here, they remember that." He shades his eyes, as he looks at the snow, which is sparkling bright. "Come, let me show you around ..."

Yuri stands, silent for a moment, impressed, but not gawking. _Such wonders... the Gods truly do still have their hands in our world..._

Yuri thinks, _Tormel doesn't know what he's missing..._

Starguard nods, following. "We're very curious about the fourth spire. But you must get that a lot. The newest being the star."

Andreth walks slowly around the side of the Flatlands spire. "Lot more to read on these others, though..."

There is a path circling around the spires, and from there, paths enter each quadrant, stopping at benches, and small tables where people can sit and talk or play a simple game of skill. The young man takes you once around the center path, turning first to the right. "This is the is the Flatland quadrant. It's always one season ahead of our own; scholars measure the temperature to predict the quality of the coming season, and make their plans thereby. They advise the emperor too. At length, sometimes." The young man smiles. "And here, moving along, is the Stormwind quadrant. They are suffering from a cold fall; as they have every year for these past two decades." He shivers, a little, as the cold seeps in. "Their spire grows more slowly than it used to, I'm told." He quickly moves through to the wintry quadrant. "This is Ungfallen's Spire and quadrant; his seasons run contrary to ours; when we reach summer he reaches winter." The young soldier ducks a flying snowball.

"And lastly, this is the fourth quadrant. The emperor insisted upon it from the very beginning, but only recently did the spire appear. Until then it was always the nameless quadrant, mimicking the weather as it happens." And indeed, the weather in this quadrant feels much like the weather beyond the garden.

Yuri says, "If it was nameless then, what is it generally called now?"

"Now? Now it is Samaela's quadrant." The young soldier shrugs. The spire holds but two phrases, 'Samaela' and 'the Courtship'. Neither of these yields much information." He stops in front of the spire, bending over a little to point out the words. They have been written in the trade tongue, which is spoken by the well traveled across the empire. Legend suggests, in fact, that at one time only the trade tongue was spoken ...

Starguard blinks. "There's a second phrase now?"

Yuri says, "Oh... we hadn't heard there were more... when did this happen?"

Tilara leans against the fence to peer at the fourth spire.

Ash rubs his head in thought. "I guess she found someone after all."

The soldier hmmms. "About ... I believe it was but a week or so ago. Perhaps a few days more than that ..."

Starguard shakes his head. "I bet the scholars are abuzz."

Yuri says, "Huh? Ash?"

Tilara chuckles. "Aren't they always? We'll have to tell Tormel about this, or he'll never forgive us."

Starguard grins at Til. "Might change the odds."

Andreth says, "I bet he hears about it just talkin' with old friends."

A very emphatic nod. "They were. Two ran straight for the emperor, when they spotted it, both clamouring to tell him first." The soldier smiles. "And then he'd already seen it, of course. He comes here every morning."

Yuri remembers... _There were three... the Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone... so if this means something is happening with the Maiden, then it's going to be important to all of them._

Yuri says, "I wonder... have any others shown unusual interest in Samaela's Spire? Strangers like us?"

Andreth leans over the fence. "When'd the spire first show words, again?"

Tilara says, "Unusual interest? I'd think everyone's going on about it."

Yuri looks around the Garden. _For that matter, who else is here, right now?_

Yuri says, "Yes, but not everyone will be a casual observer."

The soldier looks pensive. "Right around the young princess's birth. Perhaps a season earlier? I think that's when the words appeared. But the spire was so small ... " He shakes his head, unsure of precise dates. Then he smiles at Yuri's question. "Everybody asks that. I don't know what would be unusual; we're all fascinated. Only a few men get to see a new spire ... "

As Yuri looks around the garden, he sees the two boys, who have reached a truch and are now building a fort in preparation to take on their escort soldier in a pitched battle. Others, most in scholarly gowns, are walking through the summer quadrant; many of them leaning over and examining the plants while taking careful notes. The fall and spring quadrants are empty; only a single lady is sitting by the small waterfall in the spring quadrant, reading a book.

Starguard says, "You must have had to fight hard for this assignment."

The young soldier shakes his head, politely contradicting Starguard. "We all serve as escorts, sir. Train a week, escort a week, and then two weeks of patrols."

Andreth is still quiet, gazing at the small spire, idly rubbing the scar at his neck. Even he isn't sure what he's looking for...

Tilara says, "Is there anyone important here right now?"

Yuri says quietly, "Everyone is important."

The young soldier looks puzzled at Tilara's question. "Well, ma'am, that's how you measure importance. Those lads is Prince Lurin's latest pair of grand sons. And the lady behind me, that's Aiscalion's great great grand daughter. And the scholars, of course. Every one of them the emperor's advisor."

Tilara nods. "Aye, they would be. It was a silly sort of question, I suppose. I was just wondering who you could meet here."

The young soldier smiles. "well, most anyone in the court comes here, ma'am. Lady Marilan comes with her husband, in the morning, and again at night with her babe. And as she does, so does everyone." He blushes, a little, obviously impressed with the lady.

Tilara smiles. "Gets a bit crowded, does it?"

The soldier nods. "Sometimes, ma'am. But usually the gardens ... they stretch far enough that it doesn't feel full?"

Yuri's eyes widen. "Oh, my. No matter how many are here?"

The soldier shakes his head. "No, sir. It's just that with all the walks, and the trees, and the way the gardens have been laid out ... There are a lot of private places. And the court, of course, doesn't require an escort."

Yuri nods, looking a little more relaxed.

Andreth raises his head. "The Lady comes here twice a day, y'say? To all four spires?"

The soldier shakes his head. "I do not know, sir. I know she comes, but I do not know her movements. 'Tis not for the likes of me to follow her."

Tilara says, "Of course not. We're just curious. We've not been to the Palace before."

Andreth nods. "Aye, right enough..." he says, returning his gaze to the stone again, which says nothing new.

The soldier nods. "Most people are. Curious, I mean." He smiles. "The lady has inspired much love in these two years, and not only in the Emperor."

Starguard drifts over to the edge of the winter's area and feels the cold snow, reminding him of his recent dreams. He watches the kids so intent on their fort, the guard looking wary... And he can't help it. Making a quickly packed ball, he hurls a long bomb into the fort, well out of the kids range, smiling impishly.

The boys squeal in excitement, jumping up from behind their fort. Within moments a fusillade of snowballs fills the air, as the boys rapid fire their entire supply of ammunition in quick order. The governess and the soldier watch on in bemusement, even as the lads, having run out of ammunition inside their fort, run out, gathering and throwing more snowballs.

Starguard grins, listening to the squealing, but is at somewhat long range. A couple more arc in before the old cleric waves, heading for the exit with a big grin on his face. And a little snow in his hand to slip down someone's neck.

The boys advance, but soon slow to a stop when the old cleric tosses no other balls. Then, taking the snow they have in hand, they go back to pelting one another. Back at the exit, the gates open, and beyond the guard still has the party's weapons.

Having explored the walled garden, the party leaves the castle, separating. Yuri disappears into the better part of town, hoping to trade coin for information in a friendly setting. Starguard has potions that need brewing. And the others follow Andreth. That mention of totem quest was most interesting ...

Yuri makes a quick stop, to find Karlsefnir in his room. Karl is grooming the cats, keeping them amused, and nods at Yuri's news that they have found Zamua. His expression turns urgent, though, when he hears it will be two days. He moves away from the cats, and begins to pen a letter.

Yuri blinks. "What are you doing? Is it that urgent?"

Karl looks up. "I write letter. You see letter gets delivered? Is urgent. Is very urgent."

Yuri says, "How urgent? Tonight urgent? Zamua is the governess of the Princess. She's not easy to reach."

Karl sighs. "Urgent enough to go tonight. She must know. Now warning makes sense."

Yuri says, "This would be easier if you'd tell me. And who the nameless one is. The words 'The Courtship' now appear on the spire under her name. You know what this all means."

Yuri says, "But we don't. What's going on?"

Karl nods. "One warning to Zamua, to her alone, was this; The Crown becomes a Noose. We did not know she was governess. The other warnings, go from her to the world. But that one goes to her." He looks worried, and finishes writing the letter, signing it with a complicated pictogram. "You must deliver. Tonight."

Yuri says, "Alright. But if I deliver tonight, you tell me who she-who-must-not-be-named is?"

Karl blanches, then nods, pulling out a second piece of paper. He writes down two words. One reads 'Samaela', the other 'Miardan'.

Yuri points at Miardan and says, "Ancestor?"

Karl nods, once, then crosses the name out. "Her name is not spoken."

Yuri says, "OK. I'll find a way to get this to Zamua."

Yuri stuffs the envelope into his tunic, and goes downstairs. "This isn't going to be easy."

---

Merial's temple is neither the largest nor the smallest. It sits, neighbourly, between temples devoted to Lachlan and Lurithain, and seems to celebrate Merial primarily as the patron of farm labourers the empire over ... The visitors are welcomed, and shown into the main hall. Farm implements are hung on the walls, some with shrines below. A small offering plate by the front door holds coins, unguarded. It would be as easy to take a coin as it owuld be to leave one.

Tilara drops a few silver into the plate on the way past. "Never hurts to be generous when you can be."

Ash, himself a former devotee by virtue of profession, salutes smartly and offers his own meager contribution. A brief smile touches his lips as recollection - of his time among the Company, and his earlier life - flashes to mind. It passes, and he follows the rest.

Andreth follows suit. He's had little need to spend money, thanks to his companions, and there are others who have far greater need than he.

Stormy follows Tilara's lead, dropping a silver coin of his own. He looks around, eyes wide. The temple is filled with young children, seated in circles, each holding a slate and listening - mostly attentively - to slightly older children. A school for the poorer children, it's obviously being run on the trickle down method. And it seems to work well enough. As the party moves ahead, a single acolyte steps forward to greet them, offering his aid.

Tilara greets the acolyte. "We were told that we could find out about totem quests here. Is this the case?"

Andreth looks to either side, at his companions, uncertain how to respond... relaxing a little as Tilara speaks up. He's just not comfortable being first, after all.

The acolyte looks sideways at Andreth, and nods. "The lady will be able to help you. Follow me." He leads the way into a warren of passages at the back of the temple, opening eventually into a small library. Two copyists sit, working assiduously, while an older lady is holding a book by the window. She looks up, at the acolyte's entrance, and nods when he explains his errand. Then she smiles at Andreth. "Come, into my room. There's people working here." She shows everyone into a small side room, containing a single table and seven wooden chairs, and invites everyone to take a seat.

Ash sits as invited, glancing over at Andreth. A curious expression rests on his face, as he waits to see what new twist of fate his friend will travel through in this part of his spiritual life.

Once everyone is seated, the lady takes one of the remaining chairs. She's still carrying the book she was holding, and the acolyte perches on a chair beside her. "I am told you wish to know of totem quests ... What would you know?"

Andreth sits on the edge of his seat. "I..." He takes a deep breath. "I want t'go on one, ma'am. But I don't know how t'start."

Tilara perches near the front of her chair. "Well... how they were done, I suppose. A scholar told us that everyone has a totem that shows which of the Gods they are close to, and we ... have been a lot closer to such things than we'd ever hoped. So now we are curious to see how we can find out how we are connected."

The lady nods at Andreth and Tilara both, then smiles. "There is no one way to find a totem. There are many. The search ends when you have found and touched your soul; the starting point is only that. The first step." She pauses, looking around the table. "But I am sure you would prefer a more straightforward answer, being young ... Very well; a common place to start was the tip of Wilthorwen's Peak, in northern Calais. The goddess looks fondly on those who would know themselves."

"Others have sought out the halls of Ungfallen. Merial, too, looks fondly on those who would know themselves."

Tilara grins, a bit ruefully. "We're already on a quest for someone else. We might be able to visit Wilthorwen's peak afterwards..."

The priestess smiles. "We keep a small chapter of the Book for the goddess. But ours is only a small part of the whole; there is much this world we cannot see." She nods at Tilara, and looks sideways at Andreth. "His quest?"

Andreth raises his head at that last. "Really..." he murmurs, touching his hand to his throat. "When y'say Ungfallen's halls, what d'you mean?"

Tilara says, "Well.... in part. The quest was the price for his return."

Turning to face Andreth directly, the priestess explains. "There are two lands in the Underworld. There is the land of the dead, where Lifall is king. And then there is the land of Ungfallen, where he lives with his sister-wife Limera, and with Merial. In the land of the dead, you can see your questions answered, but the price is high. It is not a price, Andreth, that you can pay many times ... In Ungfallen's halls, on the other hand ... " She pauses. "The children of Ungfallen are few, and rarely seen. Even more rarely understood, though Aiscalion has claimed knowledge of them."

Andreth nods, rubbing his chin. "I see... so if I was to go that way, I might start looking in Calais?"

The priestess nods. "Yes. Look for the scarred faces. I've heard 'tis hard to miss them."

Andreth sits up sharply, as understanding sets in. "That 'tis, milady." He nods quietly.

She looks startled. "You've ... you've seen them? Tell me; what are they like? Does Prince Aiscalion speak truth?"

Tilara says, "Can't say if he speaks truth about what he knows, but they are scarred. Tattooed, more precisely."

The priestess leans forward. "Truly? These ... tattoos ... Do they have meaning?

Andreth breathes a sigh of relief as Tilara answers for him. In truth, he wasn't sure he should speak of them at all, to strangers. But perhaps here, it is safe...

Tilara shrugs. "They are supposed to. I can't say yea or nay on that score, milady."

Andreth speaks up, "They don't like to say much 'bout themselves."

Ash stays quiet, reluctant to speak either way. Instead, he savors the enjoyment of watching someone else boggle at news the Company brings, rather than the reversal of convention.

The priestess looks disappointed. "We hear so little from the prince; he sends only that he has met them, and has made peace with them." She shakes her head. "'Tis ... 'tis difficult, knowing so little." She turns to Andreth. "Have you spoken with one?"

Andreth shakes his head uncertainly. "Not much, milady. I don't speak their language, and they ain't too good at Mar."

The priestess persists. "But you've met one. You've seen them. They exist." She clasps her hands together. "Well, you've found your answer, then. Oh ... " She sighs. "I just wish I'd spoken with them ..."

Suddenly she sits up. "But ... but where would you have seen them? There's been no tales of them past the Escarpment."

Andreth looks uncertainly at Tilara. This is not his tale to tell, he feels - she knows better than he what to tell people. In truth, he wishes Yuri were here...

Tilara says, "They don't speak much, though, even if you speak their language. We're from Mar, near the Escarpment. A few of them came down once."

The priestess nods, looking a little disappointed at the paucity of information. "I understand. Perhaps, some day, you will write down what you know for the Book?"

Tilara nods. "Some day. When the knowledge would no longer endanger them."

The priestess nods. "I will hold you to that promise, miss. And you will not suffer for it. And neither shall they."

Tilara sketches a bow, still seated. "Fair enough."

Andreth nods, bowing in place as well. "One last thing - once you've found a startin' point, what d'you do? Pray to the gods and ask their guidance?"

The priestess nods. "Indeed. You fast for three days, and meditate. Within those three days, the gods will send a dream, if they send any aid at all. Sometimes the gods will not send dreams. They do not always answer." She smiles. "But never do they answer after more than three days. So you need not fear starving to death."

Andreth nods. "I see... and if they don't answer... does it mean you don't have a totem? Or just they don't want you lookin' just now?"

The priestess shakes her head. "As a mere mortal, I do not know. Those who failed often turned bitter, and violent, and did much evil; perhaps they were not ready. And others returned, when they had aged a few years, and found their totems then."

Andreth nods. "Thank you much, milady," he says, bowing once more.

The priestess stands. "I thank you; I shall enjoy meeting you again."
