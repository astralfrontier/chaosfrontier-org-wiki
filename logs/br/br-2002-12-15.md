# Birthright 2002-12-15

After Yuri is given the urgent message from Karlsefnir, he heads straight to the Temple. With luck, he'll still be able to intercept the others. And he does; catching them just as they're leaving.

Yuri trots up, looking slightly breathless. "We may have a problem."

Ash just gives Yuri a look. "Yeah? So what else is new?"

Tilara says, "What's wrong?"

Yuri says, "One of Karlsefnir's messages, to Zamua. After I told him that Zamua is Potapka's governess, he said that the warning made sense to him - 'The Crown becomes A Noose'. He said we need to get that to her tonight. In return, he's given me some information about Samaela."

Tilara says, "A fair trade, I think... let's take along the official letter for the Emperor, as well, shall we? Might get us in easier."

Yuri nods. "So... we gonna just waltz right up and talk our way in with our native wit and charm?"

Tilara says, "Seeing as how the other option is to sneak in and leave something in what is probably the most heavily warded section of the palace, I'd suggest it, yes."

Andreth looks worried as he gazes off toward the palace. "Gonna need a _lotta_ that..."

Ash shrugs. "Better get movin' then," he observes, glancing up at the sky.

Stormy watches the byplay curiously, then nods at Ash's suggestion.

Yuri says, "Didn't they say that there's a particular time that Zamua and Potapka are always in the Garden? Just around sunset?"

Tilara snaps her fingers. "They did say that, didn't they? Let's move out."

The party hurriedly makes their way back to the walled gardens. Their first stop is at the castle gates, where a guardsman asks the party their purpose. Somehow he seems a lot less welcoming than the earlier guardsman that morning.

Yuri steps forward, and exchanges the usual courtesies with the guardsman before explaining that the party has come bearing a message for the Lady Zamua from the Princedom of Calais. The guardsman nods, frowning, but does step aside, indicating that the Lady will be taking the air in the Walled Gardens. Three soldiers are assigned as escorts, rather than the earlier one.

And these soldiers are a lot less less chatty. Instead they direct the party directly to the gardens, and wait for everyone to divest themselves of their weapons, before following the party through the gates.

The gardens are far busier now than they were before. In the southern quadrant, blankets are spread and a small group of ladies sit on the grass, working on their embroidery, while one older lady reads from a book in a good clear voice. A baby lies in the center and is currently giggling, as her tummy gets rubbed.

In the other sections other people gather in small groups. A moment's introspection suggests that everyone's movements gravitate around the ladies on the blanket, although nobody is so gauche as to make this plainly obvious. Well, except one older welldressed man, who is currently examining the fourth spire, and keeps looking back at the baby.

The three soldiers wait, watching the party.

Ash keeps his eyes glued on Yuri, some obscure instinct warning him that this is a time for obedience and hierarchy.

Tilara nods to Yuri. "We don't all need to go over to see her, y'know. Probably be better if just one of us approaches that group."

Yuri nods to Tilara, then quietly to the Guard, "Which one is she? We've never been here before."

Andreth stands by Ash, out of an instinct not so much for hierarchy, but for staying quiet when his mouth could only get us into trouble.

One of the soldiers looks at Yuri. "Zamua is the lady reading." The others nod, hands still on swords. These soldiers are definitely a lot more cautious.

Yuri nudges Tilara, hopefully so that the others can see; and inclines his head for a moment towards a particular man in the crowd.

Yuri says, "I'll go deliver the message, then."

Yuri walks over to the group of women, doing his best to look alert but unconcerned.

The soldier follows right behind him, stepping forward only when he reaches the group of ladies. He bows, once, and waits for the Lady Marilan to notice him. Up close, Yuri can see the scars, and they do look frightening. They cover her face in long diagonal streaks, bisecting both her eyes, and it's a wonder she isn't blind. But her smile is kind.

Tilara takes a closer look at the scholar by the fourth spire, and nods. _He looks - heh. More like our sort, then, isn't he? Well dressed but not afraid to do things._

Ash waits patiently, at last allowing himself to study those present. He feels a peculiar sensation - that of a man being ambushed, but by the unknown and unpredictable rather than some quantifiable threat.

Having been noticed, the soldier introduces Yuri as a messenger, bringing a message for the Lady Zamua, from Calais. Lady Marilan nods. Lady Zamua rises to her feet and steps forward, after giving the book to another lady. "I am Lady Zamua." She waits, hands folded.

Lady Zamua is an imposing woman; standing almost six feet tall, with long flowing hair worn loose in the new court style embraced by Lady Marilan. Her eyes are old. Older than her appearance warrants. But there are no other obvious signs of aging; she looks young, and pleasant, and waits politely for Yuri to explain his errand.

Yuri bows to Zamua, proferring the scroll. "Milady. I am Yuri. This message comes under strange circumstances. It may require some explanation, but the man who wrote it tells me that you shall know what it means. And if that is the case, I am at your service."

Ash, on impulse, leans closer to one of the three guards, hoping his mein is that of fellow-vassal. "Who is that man?" he murmurs with a curt nod.

The Lady Zamua accepts the scroll. Holding it in one hand, she chants a simple dweomer, testing it for magics. Satisfied that the scroll is merely a piece of parchment, she unrolls it, and slowly reads it, her gaze caught by the symbol Karlsefnir had included at the very bottom. She looks up at Yuri again, then turns back to Lady Marilan. "My lady; this message is perplexing. May I be excused? The young man has much to tell me." Lady Marilan nods, and waves her away.

One of the two remaining guards, catching Ash's comment, smiles. "Our lord. The Emperor."

Yuri glances at Potapka with a look of concern, and then at Zamua, hoping his meaning is clear. _Will she be safe?_

Ash smiles quickly, covering over his question. "An outlander such as I has not seen his face... but he seems.. quite like the tales tell."

The guard nods enthusiastically. "He is. And more."

Lady Zamua raises a single eyebrow. "Come. Walk with me, you and your friends. I will hear your tale." She walks back to where the others stand waiting, and dismisses the guards to watch from a distance, before leading everyone into the Spring quadrant.

Tilara looks back at Ash and the guard for a moment, then back at the man identified as the Emperor, then away again, her eyes tracking for something innocuous to look at. She nearly sighs in relief as Yuri comes back with Lady Zamua.

Yuri nods, bows to the assembled women - particularly Marilan - and waves to the others. "As you wish, milady."

Andreth's eyes widen slightly. Obviously the message has had some effect, but he can't yet guess what. He's content to follow along and listen... and learn.

In the spring quadrant, a small amount of privacy can be gained by stepping behind a hedge. As two courtiers have obviously discovered: after shooing the young lovebirds out, Lady Zamua turns to face the party. "So. You have an explanation?"

Yuri nods. "I shall attempt no deception, though I know not how much of our story you will believe. The man who penned that message is one of the lost children of Andvar, and they have come to the Flatlands from their home - which we suppose to be near Calais - with several warnings of impending catastrophes. They themselves do not know the meanings of all of the messages that they carry. We met up with them on the road from Woolwich, and after settling a misunderstanding, we have been escorting them through the Empire ourselves."

The Lady Zamua listens, nodding occasionally.

Yuri says, "All they knew of this message is that it was intended for Zamua - you. When we discovered that you are the governess of Potapka, Karlsefnir - their head man - became very concerned that this message should be delivered today."

Again Lady Zamua nods, courteously.

Yuri says, "I think he fears for her life. The is much more to tell, of course, but it seems that this is the thrust of their mission."

Now she smiles. "Well, I should like to hear the more. As would our Lord, I am certain." As she looks to the side a little, the older man steps forth. He nods, eyes narrowed.

Yuri says, "That being said, we should attend to courtesy. We are the White Company. I am Yuri; this is Ash, Andreth, Tilara, and Firestorm. We are at your service."

Yuri takes a moment to look over the Emperor, then bows as fitting one of the lowest birth greeting one of the highest. "My lord. I must admit, I feared this moment more than I needed to."

Tilara follows suit, with a deep curtsey to the Emperor. _At least, I hope that's true..._

Andreth likewise bows deeply as his name is given, hoping this is the appropriate response.

The man smiles, enigmatically, acknowledging the bows and curtseys with simple headshakes, then looks at Lady Zamua, waiting for her to continue. She nods. "There is little to fear. But we would like to hear more."

Yuri stands, and nods. "Then I shall tell you our tale."

Yuri warms up to his subject, delivering the rehearsed summary of the Story of the White Company (Thus Far). It is not a glib delivery, as a juggler may give in a tavern, or a grim delivery, as an old soldier may give around the campfire. It is told as an honest account of ordinary people living up to extraordinary situations, in the tone of a man who has been there.

Yuri says, "It began on the day of the Spring Faire in the town of Woolwich, in the heart of Aglamar, far from troubled borders. We were four, then, myself, Tilara, Andreth, and Starguard. We sought employment, and because of our preferences, we wished it to be of an adventurous nature. It happened that Jane Gerroldsdottir, the blacksmith, had been robbed the previous day, and was looking for someone to find her stolen weapons."

Yuri says, "Well, we followed the signs to an abandoned farm outside of town, which was guarded by far too many dogs for it to be so abandoned, and we discovered it to be inhabited by a band of brigands. Returning to town, we noticed that our local slums were remarkably free of crime, and so we surmised that the brigands had recruited the local cutpurses, and we might be able to join their ranks and find the stolen weapons if we posed as recruits."

Yuri says, "Cleverly disguised as men of low character, we entered the slums and convinced one of their leaders, Big Joe, that we were worthy of his attention through the simple expedient of beating him to within an inch of his life. He brought us to the farmhouse and got us inside, where Jane's stolen weapons were in plain view in the barn, which they were using as a training room."

Yuri says, "Starguard added a sleeping draught to the brigand's dinner, and so we were able to subdue them by tying them to their bunks. The leaders, Big Joe, Jonesie, and Ferg, did not succumb to the drug, and so we had to fight them man-to-man. Subduing Ferg was most troublesome, because he had retreated to some old tunnels dug under the farmhouse. The killer root cellar was dark, and Ferg had placed poison needles in many places to discourage interlopers, but finally, after much blood shed, he was defeated."

Yuri says, "Since we hadn't known the brigands to have actually robbed or attacked anyone, it was agreed that they should not be charged with crimes; Ferg, however, was sent to the Lurinese border patrol for two years, for robbing Jane. Now, that left us with a dozen highly-trained men who, left to their own devices, would just have gone back to petty crime in the slums, and so we used part of our payment to equip them with arms and armor, and arranged a contract for them as caravan guards, so that they would learn to earn an honest living."

Yuri says, "Now, it would be simple to assume that Ferg had been organizing a bandit gang to disrupt trade on the caravan roads, and he was certainly a nasty enough character to do that on his own. But, we found a brazier under the floor of his room, with the ashes of a burned feather in it, which Tilara believes is some kind of transportation magic. And then we needed to know, transportation to and from where?"

Yuri says, "We then decided that a team that works so well together, should stay together, and so we signed the charter of the White Company, that we should pool our talents for our own profit and glory, and of those we might meet along the way. With Ash and Firestorm added to our ranks, we set out for the monastery of the Brothers of the Waters, to seek their wisdom."

Yuri says, "And then, disaster struck. Less than a day from Woolwich, we were set upon by wolves, larger wolves than we'd ever seen before. Andreth was mortally wounded, and died during the fighting. Now, it became a matter of urgency to reach the monastery, because we believed that the Brothers could reverse his death, even though the price would be high."

Yuri says, "By negotiating for the services of a coach in Woolwich, we were able to reach the Brothers in less than two days. The Abbot listened to our tale and, blessed be he, agreed to raise Andreth. His price was to place us under a geas - for six months, we would quest for the meaning of a word... the word that appears on the fourth Spire, here in Citadel - 'Samaela', a word we now know to be a name."

Yuri says, "We went to Red River Town and decided that the safest way to reach Citadel was to ride with a caravan; however, it was quite early in the year, and there were none headed our way yet. Since we could waste no time, we decided to form our own caravan, and persuaded four merchants to send a cart, each with a journeyman. We hired four caravan guards, and a scholar by the name of Tormel."

Yuri says, "We made good time from Red River Town to Thorpenhow. We even found some new travellers; Thord, Arnlaug, and Karlsefnir, who come from a distant land, and who agreed to travel with us for mutual protection. But along the way, we heard disturbing portents - more attacks on common folk by unusually large wolves; even children being carried off by giant hawks! Once, we saw a strange fire in the woods that burned but did not catch to the trees around it. At the base of the fire, we found a brazier and the ashes of a feather, just like the ones that Ferg had. It seemed that whoever he was working for, he was not the only one!"

Yuri says, "We discovered Thorpenhow to be the focus of attacks by the giant hawks. Several times, they had come to drop burning pitch on their Watchtower, and the Lady Major San's own son, a powerful magician, had been killed while venturing on the road south to bring a message to Citadel. We agreed to investigate the source of the attacks for Major San, and went on a patrol of the surrounding Syndics. Finding that most of the farmers were well, we encamped near the road and tried to look as vulnerable as possible, to bait our enemies into attacking us. It worked; and we seized two Foramen, an extraordinary race that lives in the forests near Thorpenhow - descendants of servitors created by Methilwillani, original founder of Thorpenhow."

Yuri says, "Our captives led us to Grikurgrah, their leader; we discovered that few Foramen remain, and so Grikurgrah was kidnapping children to build up their ranks; and attacking the watchtower, because he believed it belonged to the Foramen, and not the people of Thorpenhow. We also discovered that Grikurgrah hired mercenaries of another strange race - men who can change into giant animals; at hawks, and wolves, and giant cats. It seems that Samaela is important to these 'changers' - a maiden; or a mother; or a crone; or possibly all three at once; although we know not if this was the title of the women who fill a role in their world, or the name of a powerful woman in their tribe."

Yuri says, "We were put to a test, to retrieve swords from the Barrows, where the dead of the last battle of Methilwillani rest uneasily. We faced walking dead in those tombs, but recovered two swords to prove our bravery to Grikurgrah. We were able to persuade Grikurgrah to sign a treaty with Major San, giving both parties access to the Watchtower; and the Foramen shall take in human orphans for, while they are a rough race, they are not savages; they value their children, teach them well, and give them a life."

Yuri says, "We were tasked with bringing the sons of Grikurgrah back to his camp, because that was to be his sign that the Treaty had been made proper. The sons sought to go hunting near our camp that night, and were attacked by giant hunting cats. It was no easy effort to save the lives of the sons of someone who had caused us so much trouble, but with the aid of our guards, and Karlsefnir and his companions, it was done, and the cats captured."

Yuri says, "Ash discovered collars nearby, and so we knew they were trained by someone, and that the cats could be made tame by putting their collars on. We followed the tracks back to their source, and found the ashes of a feather in a brazier... a sure sign that the cats had come from a fiery portal! It seems that somebody on the other side, did not wish for their to be peace between the Foramen and Thorpenhow; although the Changer mercenaries identified the hunting cats as being native to their lands, they did not admit to knowing anything of warmongers in their midst."

Yuri says, "The road from Thorpenhow to Citadel was almost clear, but not untroubled. Just short of Cairnstoke we were set upon by shapeshifters of another type, who kidnapped some of our guards, and a merchant, and took on their faces. We did not discover the deception until we found the dead body of the merchant Gerard in some nearby caves, while a living Gerard was in our camp just a few hundred yards away. We nearly killed the imposter, and posted heavy guards during the night; but two more shapeshifters came into our camp, and put us into a slumber by sorcerous means, and took their comrade back with them."

Yuri says, "Unwilling to leave our hirelings behind, we ventured into the caves near camp, though our injuries and our geas sore pained us to do otherwise. With Karlsefnir, we fought the three shapeshifters and their inhuman servants. Ash struck a mortal blow against their leader, Fernando; the other two were subdued, and brought to trial in Cairnstoke, and executed forthwith. Our guards were found, battered but otherwise unmarred; for poor Gerard, we gave an excellent funeral."

Yuri says, "That was less than a week ago. We reached two days ago, and we have seen our surviving merchants to their guilds. For the Andvari, we made inquiries as to who was behind the name Zamua; as I've already mentioned, when Karlsefnir heard that Zamua is the governess of Potapka, he insisted that we deliver his warning tonight. 'The Crown Becomes A Noose'. Clearly, he thinks Potapka is in danger. This is not the only warning he carries for the flatlands, but it seems to be the one closest to hand."

Yuri fishes out the letter from Lady San, and proffers it to the Emperor. "We were going to bring this to Your Excellency at the next court. It seems now would be a better time."

The Emperor smiles, at the long tale, while the Lady Zamua merely nods. Both stand, relaxed, waiting for Yuri to continue, the emperor now holding the letter loosely.

Yuri says, "As I said, I know not how much you will believe. We speak the truth."

Tilara nods. "And a strange truth it is. Karlsefnir and his companions are here in the city, your Majesty, if you should care to see them yourself."

The emperor nods, once. "I know." He unrolls the letter, perusing it briefly, before sliding it inside his tunic. "You have done well. The Brothers choose wisely." He pauses, stroking his chin. "I shall see them tonight, when the Morning Star sets. No need to emphasize their presence. But now we come to you. How fares your geas?"

Ash lets slip a hint of a smile at that, savoring the irony. To recover a man who has since died, he and others violated that very geas, and now they speak to the man whose powers of healing might restore him.

Tilara says, "It's only bitten us once, sire, when we delayed to rescue our captured people from the shapechangers. We've learned that it's a name, and now we've seen that there is more on the new Spire."

The emperor nods, again. "Yes. The Spire ... it brings new information. But not, yet, understanding." He strokes his chin once more. "But tell me, have you discovered much of this Samaela?"

Yuri closes his eyes, and bows his head for a moment, thinking. "We have learned much in the way of rumor and supposition. We know that Samaela is the name of a woman, and it seems to be a name that has been handed down amongst the changers. There are currently three Samaelas among them, the Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone. The Changer mercenaries we encountered indicated that the Maiden was maturing and would soon be taking a husband, and the new words on their spire - The Courtship - seem to indicate that this is progressing."

Yuri says, "The Andvari do not speak of her, and do not know all the details, save that Samaela is the descendant of Miardan, a hermit who disappeared 150 years ago."

The emperor raises one eyebrow. "Miardan, eh? The stew grows thicker, and I think it's time for a little stirring." He looks intently at the party. "Where do you go now?"

Tilara shrugs. "In search of information, your Majesty. We have no plans past the morrow, and even those plans have changed now - we'd originally thought to seek audience with you."

Yuri allows himself a small grin at the irony. "As the lady says, our timetable has accelerated. Our plan was to see our Emperor, of course, to bring Him gifts, tender our messages, and request a boon."

He nods, unperturbed. "A boon, you say. And gifts. This must be a great boon indeed, if you feel your service alone does not warrant it."

Ash says nothing, but is privately a little surprised. To his thinking, the service was to the Andvarri rather than to the Emperor. On reflection, a mission to save the life of the Emperor's daughter does seem like a service after all - albeit an unexpected one.

Yuri nods, his face losing expression. "As you may have guessed, Andreth's wounds were not only grevious, they were... fatal. It seems that history has repeated itself. Three nights ago, we were attacked by wolves, similar to the ones that have hounded our steps thus far. They killed Perf, one of our hired soldiers." He pauses a moment, barely believing what he's about to say. "We want him back. The People say that if anyone can find a way, it is you."

Yuri says, "But for the warning about the threat to your daughter - the Andvari can best describe what favors they wish themselves. If indeed they wish for any."

The emperor nods. "Ah. Then the service you claim is the delivery of the Lady San's letter?"

Yuri waits a moment, and dares to look the Emperor in the face.

Tilara chuckles. "Well, we didn't really know how important the other message was when we agreed to help deliver it."

The emperor smiles. "Indeed. It is a wise man who takes no credit for a service he did not intend. Still ... the warning was timely. My daughter is precious to me; I have great plans for her; she shall bring peace between the warring princes." He pauses. "But a man who is dead is not easy to raise; the dead are jealous of the living, and guard their companions closely. Where is this Perf now?"

Yuri says, "The service we claim is filling our roles. Clearly the Gods, both present in our world, and those removed from it, have need of people who will be the players in the coming game."

Yuri says, "Our original purpose as the White Company is profit and glory for ourselves. We all also have our own desires. But one thing we are all clear on - something is coming. Something important, and dangerous. Many lives are at risk, lives of people from nobles to beggars. People with names that will be recorded in song and people with names that will never be known by any outside the Underworld. Someone must step forth and face the challenges, or many will suffer and die, and homes - like our home of Woolwich - may be destroyed. We could all have been happy as farmers. We're not. We're going forth."

Ash stays still, tense and observant of Yuri's explanations. Here, he senses, is some key bit of understanding which has eluded him in the past.

Tilara snorts softly at Yuri's comment about being happy as farmers, but doesn't contradict him directly.

Yuri says, "I sense... I believe that it is not too late for reconciliation, for treaties to be signed and for trade to come. Whatever the catastrophe, it can be vetted before it grows too large, though some would obviously wish it otherwise."

Again, a simple nod, as the emperor listens courteously. He looks thoughtful, as though weighing options in his mind.

Yuri thinks, _We're going after her. Geas or not. I see that now._

The Emperor finally sighs, obviously coming to a decision. "You are young, Yuri, and Ash, and Andreth, and Tilara ..." He looks directly at each of the named people. "And you, Firestorm, are the youngest of all." He pauses again. "And you each pledge yourself? You pledge yourself to the service of all? You will pay the price, and count it fitting?"

Stormy gulps, at being singled out, and then surprises himself. "I do."

Ash shrugs helplessly, finally understanding a bit of what his mind has been groping for. "What else can we do, sir?" he finally answers. "Once you get a glimpse of a larger world outside your door..well, it's there, and you realize you ARE a part of it."

The Emperor smiles at Ash. "Many people close the door, then bar and lock it, and try to convince themselves that all that outside world was but a dream ...

Tilara straightens up. "Sire, when I was even younger than Stormy -- err, Firestorm -- I promised myself that I would develop my powers of magic and not become a bored housewife with a boring husband. It was not then my intention to sacrifice myself for the good of the Empire - but if it should so happen, then it will. Better that than to die of boredom. And those who enjoy a quiet existence can enjoy it, while those of us who don't will keep them safe."

The Emperor nods at Tilara, in turn, smiling at that slip of the tongue.

Andreth's eyes widen, as he begins to understand. He says, "An' if we close the door now, the world 'll come in anyway. Better to go out and meet it. 'sides, I feel as if I still owe the gods a debt for my own life... and if this is the way of it, I'll pay it gladly."

The Emperor nods, too, At Andreth, and then looks inquiringly at Yuri. "Will you speak for your missing friend? Brother Starguard, I believe it is?"

Yuri says, "I believe that he has already made his decision. He is, among other things, a healer, and it seems the Gods he is closest to, have informed him that They wish him to pursue this mission."

The Emperor smiles at that explanation. "The gods have been ... active in your life, have they not?

Yuri says, "And as for myself... well, until there is peace, I could not safely rest anyway."

Yuri allows himself to chuckle. "Oh, yes, Sir. In ways I think you're uniquely qualified to understand."

Turning to the Lady Zamua, the Emperor indicates the party. "With youngsters like these growing up, how can we fail." He turns back. "You give me much to think upon. Will you return tomorrow evening? The Lady Marilan and I will dine alone, and perhaps you would care to join us?" He pulls a ring off his finger, already confident of your answer. "Show this ring at the gate, and you shall be brought to us."

Tilara curtseys again. "We are at your command, Sire."

The Emperor nods once, then steps back and disappears through the hedge. The Lady Zamua, after watching him depart, turns to face the party. "Where do you stay? And do the Andvarri stay with you?"

Andreth watches the Emperor go, surprised to find a thrill growing in him. To dine with the emperor... who ever would have believed it, who'd known him in Woolwich? Would even Brother Oak have imagined such a thing?

Ash thumps Andreth on the shoulder, then, and smiles. "I feel a great swell of pity for the world if it burst through your door with hostile intent," he murmurs. "Guess it's time we make a good impression."

Tilara says, "It's called the Golden Phoenix, milady. It's between the inner and outer walls in the Maran sector, near the gate."

Yuri folds his hand carefully around the ring. "And the Andvari stay with us, yes."

Andreth grins at Ash, mock-punching him in the chest lightly. "Aye, thanks. An' if they try your door next, woe betide 'em..." he chuckles.

After that interesting interview, the party quietly makes it's way back to the Golden Phoenix. With Lady Zamua smoothing the way, the guardsmen become a great deal friendlier.

Back at the inn, Karlsefnir is eagerly awaiting Yuri's return.

Yuri orders a round of ale for the Company and the Andvari in the common room. "After all that... my only regret is that we paid three platinum to get on the vice-chamberlain's calendar, and we ended up crashing the old man's gate anyway."

Tilara chuckles about that after they leave the palace. "Can't blame 'em, really. They must hear that sort of thing over and over again from folks who want to get close to their majesties. Of course the guards would be nicer when it turned out we were legitimate."

Stormy still looks shell shocked.

Tilara says, "I wouldn't worry about it, Yuri. We'll see if Perf wants to come back, at least, and we end up getting a free meal out of the deal. With the Emperor. The only down side is that we can't tell the story back home. No one would believe us. "

Yuri takes a long drag on his pint before answering. "So what if they don't? He'll know. And we'll know."

Ash drinks steadily, now needing to calm nerves which graciously waited before becoming jittery.

Yuri says, "All this time, I thought, with the Princes squabbling, and the border skirmishes, and the pains of the last war still heavy on our grandparents... I thought, he'd be distant, and aloof. Cold and uncaring as the world."

The Andvarri toast the company, and with Stormy translating express their gratitude, and their best wishes. Apparently, they expect to leave in the early morning hours, with the emperor's emissaries. A fate which does not seem to disturb them unduly.

Yuri speaks to Karlsefnir, quietly, in A-isian. "This part's done. But there's one thing I need to know - your fourth man, what was his name?"

Tilara nods. "Aye, and he was warm and friendly and caring... y'know, I wonder if the Gods, for all their power, can actually _do_ that much directly in the world. Maybe it is that they're limited in what they can do, either for fear of breaking it, or spoiling their children by doing everything for them, or something else..."

Andreth seems content with the Andvarri's fate as well. _They met us by trying to take our horses for their mission... and they've ended up with the Emperor's. And may they be sped on their journeys._

Tilara continues, "... but just because they _can't_ do all they might like, doesn't mean they don't care."

Stormy looks up at Tilara. "Or maybe ... maybe the gods want to let us make our own mistakes? Maybe they're like ... like ... like parents?" He shakes his head. "Although I'm not really sure what parents are like. But ... don't parents let you try new things?"

Andreth grins. "Brother Oak surely did. An' he let me fall on my face if I tried somethin' that was beyond me."

Tilara nods. "Only way to learn. That could be it."

"Not all parents are like that," answers Ash gruffly. "Some expect you to follow the footsteps they lay before you..." A comment tinged with particular meaning for him, even as he drinks and meditates on the geas.

Stormy looks at Ash, sideways, and then gulps down more ale. "At least they didn't ... didn't ... didn't sell you. At least the godsh care."

Karlsefnir nods, under his drink. "Our fourth was Snorri. Always an ill fated name; but he died well.

Tilara nods, after that is translated. "That may yet be the fate of more of us before all is said and done. There are worse epitaphs."

Yuri nods. "We all got this far together. But my part, I did for him. You understand? Tell his family."

Karlsefnir nods again. "We will sing your names with his."

Yuri nods, again. _That part is over. Finally. Time to put it behind me, and concentrate on the living._

Tilara nods as well, respectfully, almost a sitting bow. "You honor us, Karlsefnir."

Karlsefnir stands, bowing once, and retires with his fellow Andvarri. They now have other paths to follow.

Ash raises his glass in salute to the departing Andvarri. "Savages," he mumbles, "but decent folk, once they stop tryin' to murder you."

Yuri watches them go. "So they'll have a guard from now on? And not us? It will be hard to get used to that."

Yuri says, "I hope that one day, Ash, we may say that of the Changers."

Ash turns his attention back to Yuri. "Sure sure. You heard 'em. We just have to buy 'em off."

Andreth nods to Ash. "I'll miss 'em." A little grin. "And that trip of theirs. I'll learn it someday, I tell ya."

Yuri says, "Tormel's going to go nuts when he hears about this."

Yuri says, "Think we should invite him?"

Tilara says, "Well... we could ask him if he's doing anything tomorrow night. But would it be good for his employment?"

Andreth takes a sip of his ale. "May not be for us to invite 'im. But I'm sure 'e'd wanna hear about it anyway."

Yuri says, "Yeah... I wonder what he's going to ask us to do, in return for Perf. We've played this scene out before, you know."

Stormy looks up. "And the Chamberlain? What do we do with the cats?"

Tilara says, "This is true. I don't think we should impose on him by asking if we can bring other dinner guests. As for the cats - well, we can keep them another day, and ask the Emperor if he'd like them."

Yuri says, "I think we can skip going to court, and we can ask about the cats tomorrow. I think we should definitely keep the courtier's outfits, though. Never know when it will come in handy to look impressive."

Stormy nods, then looks at Yuri. "You mean ... you were planning on not keeping them?" He looks horrified, as though he's about to burst into tears, as he rubs his hand against his new tunic ...

Tilara glares at Yuri. "Don't tease the boy. He's not used to it yet."

Stormy puts his jug down, and then stands up, swaying slightly. "Thish tunic ish ... ish ...ish **mine**. And I'm ... keepingsh itsh!"

Yuri says, "Oh? Oh! Absolutely we are keeping them! I didn't mean that we should give them up! I just meant that all the work we put into looking impressive... well, we didn't really have to, did we?"

Andreth can't help but laugh a little at Stormy, until he catches the lad's expression and stifles it.

Stormy deflates. "Oh. Oh. Ooooooh ... I don't feel sho good ..."

Yuri says, "But next time we have to look like we mean business, we will. White sashes and fire brocade... they'll know we're someone to take seriously."

Ash smiles thinly, watching the spectacle and musing. A year ago, he was learning stories of people who met the Emperor and other persons of station. Tomorrow he's becoming one.

Andreth tilts his head at Yuri. "Well, th'emperor's garb was pretty damn' fine. When it were new, it musta been _really_ splendid..."

Tilara gets up to stand with Stormy. _I think someone'd better take the lad back to his room before he gets sick on his fine new clothes. He'd never forgive himself if he had to visit the Palace in his old grubbies._

Andreth raises his head. "'n I think the lad's a little worsh... warsh... had a few."

Tilara nods. "C'mon, Stormy. Let's get you bedded down to sleep it off before you get sick on yourself."

Stormy looks horrified, and begins to bawl at the thought of messing up his shiny new clothes. Docilely, he follows Tilara to bed, where he soon falls asleep.

Tilara smiles fondly at the boy, and gives him a quiet kiss on his forehead before she rejoins the rest of the group. She comes back to see how things are coming along, still smiling to herself.

Andreth stands up, only swaying slightly. "I guess I better go sleep meself, afore the room starts spinnin'. Seeya all tomorro'," he says, pausing to take a long drink from his waterglass.

Yuri says, "Wow. Getting that jacket seems to have changed the boy's life."

Tilara settles in beside Yuri. "It may be the first new clothes he's ever had, and they're finer than anything he ever hoped to see. Of course he's protective of them."

Yuri nods. "Well, I think we've done enough for one day all 'round. I'm for bed also."
