Early the following morning, a veiled lady comes, and visits with the Andvarri, who leave with her. The only person to see her is the stableboy, who is all agog, and shares his knowledge with everyone. Much is made of the lady's beauty, and grace, and ... and the way she walks, as though she were made of spun glass.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party spends the day recovering from their excesses the previous night. Stormy, in particular, is carefully laundering and relaundering his beloved tunic, removing every last infinitesimal invisible stain. And Starguard, who would never dream of over imbibing, takes advantage of the opportunity to brew another potion or two.

Tilara gets bored by midday, so after lunch she gathers up her props and her familiar and wanders out to find a spot to entertain the passers-by.

Yuri sits quietly in the Common Room of the inn, not wishing to tire himself out before such an important event. He listens to the gossip, dressed in grey, waiting for a juicy rumor.

Andreth lights a single candle, across the room from Starguard, and kneels down to meditate in the way Brother Oak taught him, interleaving the ritual with the occasional simple prayer to Merial for serenity and tranquility.

Starguard smiles, resting his bones by the fire as potion simmers quietly.

It's a fine day, in early Lurimain, and Tilara easily finds a good place to do some juggling. After a quick set she is encouraged to move on by the locals who have the spot staked out, but there are many crowds. The sun is bright, and the crowds are in a giving mood. And by day's end Tilara has seen much of the city, and made a tidy penny in profit, besides.

Meanwhile, Yuri sits, quietly nursing a tankard of weak ale. The rumours around him fly. Everyone is talking about the veiled lady, who came in the night. But from the thick of that conversation he does hear mention of a curious market. One where the sellers and the buyers go masked, and meet in the dark of the night. One where ... where cats such as the ones now stabled here would make a good sale.

As Yuri pays more attention to one thread of many, he hears tell of an open market, one that moves from night to night. One that travels here, and there. One that is both hard to miss, and impossible to find.

Feeling a little caged, Ash sets out for a long steady walk. It's a new city, and knowing more of the roads and alleys can never be a bad thing. As he reaches one particular alley, he sees a man at the far end, holding a single sword. Which would not be out of the ordinary, were there not men on both sides, threatening the man. And yet the man seems completely unafraid. Unlike his companion, a ragged child.

Ash carefully edges into the alley, curious at the spectacle of confrontation in the famed capital of the Empire itself. He makes no move yet, but his fingers unconsciously flex in readiness.

The man smiles, idling stretching. "Well, sirrahs. Will you rob me, then? Or will you ... walk away?" His lips stretch in what seems to be a friendly smile, but his eyes ... his eyes are deadly cold. And his other hand rests on the urchin's head, calming the lad. The opponents begin to back away, slowly, before suddenly dropping their cudgels and slouching away as if they'd never intended to threaten at all ...

Ash blinks a few times. Superior odds don't always win a fight - an unreliable maxim, but one he's seen put into practice. Then again, fear is a useful weapon in itself.. "Well done," he calls uncertainly to the other.

Watching the putative robbers slink away, the man smiles in earnest now. Then he turns, quickly putting the sword in a guard position again, and shoving the urchin behind him. "Thank you," he calls out in a wary tone of voice.

Ash holds up two hands, a polite greeting mixed with reassurance. "I thought in this city of any, there'd be less of that sort of thing.. " The provincial traveller sounds genuinely surprised by this - to his thinking, a city of splendors SHOULD be freer of the baser products of mankind.

The man smiles, putting up his sword. "Well, not less. The weak prey on the weaker everywhere." He pushes the child forward, and leans to whisper in it's ear, after pulling off a simple ring. _You're safe now. Take this ring, and go to the Chapter House. They'll feed you._ Then he turns to look at Ash, as the urchin hotfoots it out of there. "But at least there is not more. We are working on that." He moves out of the alley, and in the better light it is obvious that he is a man of war, no matter how sumptuous his clothes. Fine worked leather makes a formidable guard, and the swords in his belt speak of an old fashioned fighting style.

Ash tilts his head a bit. "We? City guard?" The highest authority he knows, aside from the near-mythical army, is what he immediately assumes. This conflicts with what he just saw - who would try to rob a Guardsman?

The man shakes his head, smiling wryly. "Nay; I was not born into those families. We are ... " He looks around. "Come, let us remove to more pleasant environs. This is an old tale, but worth the telling for a man who would aid a stranger." His slate grey eyes bores in Ash's. "And you were planning to aid, I'm sure."

Ash says nothing. He only nods, and follows curiously.

The duo soon find themselves in a pleasant taproom, nursing tankards of fresh ale. Good ale, in fact. The man smiles, after a single sip. "Well; I'm Davan. A member of the Brotherhood. Sworn to serve, I suppose, the emperor." He looks at Ash.

Ash blinks in surprise, feeling somewhat overwhelmed at the pervasive presence of the Emperor, even on the lips of strangers. "Ash, of Lainsborough..." he offers slowly, then adds, "I guess.. you probably don't know where that is. We've heard of the Brotherhood of the Waters.." He pauses, confident this man speaks of another organization but trying nonetheless to draw parallels. He subsides then, waiting for more information.

Davan nods. "I've not heard of Lainsborough, no. And we have precious few brothers who engage in research. But we're merely visitors, here. We've come to establish a new Chapter House in Citadel, now that our numbers have grown large enough." His command of the common tongue is marked by a faint accent; his words sound sung, almost, as though he is used to a more lilting language.

Ash nods slowly, then asks the obvious question: "If you're sworn to serve the Emperor, and the Emperor is in Citadel, then.. where did you come from, and why have you only come now?"

Davan smiles. "We've traveled from Fallan. So we're sworn to Prince Fallon. But he is sworn to the Emperor his father, so ... " He shakes his head. "As to the timing; the Brotherhood was reestablished only a few short years ago when an old old man came to Fallon, and told him tales of his youth. The Brotherhood, you see, had died to the last man in that last great battle where Timron died. And with them had fallen their standard. So they were deemed ... a closed Chapter of history." Davan sits up a little straighter, as pride shines out of his eyes. "But we've reopened that chapter. Under the aegis of the old, wise man, we've begun once more to establish Chapter Houses."

Ash turns a bit pale at the mention of a prince's loyalty to his father, but wisely says not a word on the matter, instead nodding and listening patiently. "Pardon me.. but what was, or is, the Brotherhood then?"

Davan looks Ash over, consideringly. "Our values are simple, and sparse. Loyalty, of course. Loyalty to our oaths, our lord, and our people. The greatest songs are sung of those who lived and died for loyalty. We are the fighting arm of the empire." He looks down at his ale. "Or we were, when our numbers were larger." He takes a long draught. "Now we spend as much time recruiting as we do training ..."

Ash scratches his chin thoughtfully and takes a long pull on his drink. "It sounds like you've got a good thing going," he remarks at last. "Right now.. my loyalty is to the people I came here with, and..." He stops short of explaining more about the White Company, instead changing directions. "Who brought the Brotherhood back to life? I'd like to find out more about him when I get a chance.."

Davan smiles at Ash. "We've a chapter house here, now. Out by the outer wall where we can aid the emperor if need be. There are people know more, there. I'm just a rank novice, I'm afraid." His eyes twinkle, inviting Ash to share some joke or other. "But I have had the name drummed into me, as it is drummed into every novice. Rendaralion, late from the Glaciers and the Drumkins. Rendaralion, who rides a great stallion whose intelligence never ceases to amaze and whose speed is beyond compare. Rendaralion, who stands old, and stooped, and has thinning grey hair. And yet, Rendaralion, who has defeated every member of the Brotherhood in single combat." He indicates a slash in his leather tunic. "This was the death blow in our duel."

The slash is obvious, and yet has been mended with great care. What makes it stand out, though, is the colour of the silk used to sew it shut. The palest white, it forms a sharp contrast against the darker leather.

Ash's eyes take in the mark, and he nods slowly. "I hope to visit it soon," he comments with a smile. "Some of my companions would probably be very interested in such an organization.." Then he rises, offering his hand. "I have to return. But I hope we'll meet again, Davan."

Davan nods, standing and shaking Ash's hand. "I look forward to it, Ash of Lainsborough."

Ash makes his way out into the strange streets of Citadel, threading his way back to his resting place with thoughts of this strange order spilling through his mind.

The streets are more quiet now and Ash soon finds himself back at the inn, where most of the White Company are working, or meditating.

Andreth unfolds himself from his meditative posture as he hears Ash enter. "Ah, back from your walk... find anythin' innerestin'?"

Ash briefly outlines his encounter with Davan and the Brotherhood.

Starguard hmms. "Sounds like an interesting group..."

Ash nods, and shrugs a bit. "Sounded.. odd, but interesting. Makes me wonder how it all began."

Yuri says, "An interesting group of people... so many things in the Empire that we've encountered, seem to have had their seeds planted years, even hundreds of years ago."

Andreth's eyes light up as he scratches his chin. "An old order o' warriors, almost lost... and one of 'em faces down two muggers away from a kid and says he's only a novice?" He laughs. "Reminds me of how I met Brother Oak... 'cept I was the kid _and_ the mugger too."

Tilara wanders back in time to hear the end of Ash's tale. "You had more of interest happen than I did, I see. I kept having ... _discussions_ with the locals about which street corners were open for perfomances."

Ash chuckles at Andreth. "I'm learning that all sorts of interesting things happen when you mug somebody."

Yuri says, "If they were more oriented to trade and less towards military training, I'd say they were our competition. Even so, that wouldn't be a bad thing."

Starguard says, "As long as we don't trip over each other, we can all travel in the same direction, yes."

Andreth says, "Ash says they're defenders o' the empire, just like we're prob'ly gonna be. And in _that_ business they ain't called comp'tition, they're called allies."

Tilara says, "Competition in this business isn't all bad. The more of us there are heading the same way, the safer the roads get."

Yuri chuckles at Andreth's description. "Well put."

Stormy walks in, carefully holding his tunic, and hears the tail end of Andreth's speech. The notion of allies obviously intrigues him.

Starguard snorts. "Stars, yes."

Yuri says, "Well. Shall we go see His Excellency, then? I'm sure he'd have a unique perspective on this Order."

Tilara orders an ale and drinks it quickly. "All that entertaining gets to be thirsty work. Let's get washed up and be off, shall we?"

After washing up, and dressing - in some cases most carefully - in their finery, the White Company returns once more to the inner keep. The ring, which Yuri shows at the gate, sees the party escorted immediately through the courtyard and deep into the castle, where the Company is finally left in a large room with many apologies. The door closes behind them, but there is no snickt of a lock falling shut, and the windows open easily, should any choose to escape.

The room itself is well decorated, with a variety of comfortable chairs, and tapestries adorning every wall. Fine rugs cover the floor, cushioning the stone. The cats, still on their leashes, curl up on the largest rug, in front of a blazing fire, and immediately doze off.

Andreth grins as the cats immediately find the coziest spot in the room. "Guess all cats liketa nap, no matter how big they are."

Tilara chuckles as Mirra comments on this. "She wonders why this is even worth mentioning..."

Stormy nods, standing in the middle of the room, carefully not touching anything. Except his tunic. He keeps stroking that, as though it gives him courage.

Andreth says, "Eh, she's just jealous cause they got the good spot."

Yuri smiles, but says nothing, waiting for the dignitaries to make their appearance.

Mirra struts over and nestles down between the two larger cats. Tilara smiles again. "She says they saved a spot for her."

Starguard nods, looking around the room. "Wow. Definately imposing room. Well designed."

Ash stands straight, moving as little as possible and adopting as much of a conservative air as he can muster. The informal meeting in the garden was one thing, but his lessons and sense tell him this is to be something rather more .. ordered.

Tilara drifts over to the windows, looking out to see where they are. The view looks down on the garden where they met the Emperor the day before, this room turning out to be on the third floor. "Very impressive."

Stormy grins, admiring the cats. Then he jumps, as behind him the door slowly swings open. In the distance there's a trumpet fanfare, slightly off key, and someone uttering dire threats at the next trumpet blast. Threats which, apparently, are completely ineffective. There's a second fanfare. And with that, the Emperor sweeps into the room. He rubs his hands together happily, after glaring over his shoulder. "Glad to see you could all make it. Excellent. Excellent. We just put Potapki down for her nap."

Tilara curtseys. "I trust there have been no problems, your Majesty?"

Yuri genuinely smiles. _It's such a relief to know that he's a man, after all._

Starguard bows deeply. "Your eminence."

The Emperor looks around, making eye contact with everyone in turn. His gaze lingers longest on Brother Starguard, and he raises one eyebrow curiously. "You must be Brother Starguard? Somehow I had pictured you a little ... younger." He smiles. "But this explains much."

Yuri bows, and then motions towards the hunting cats. "We have brought a gift. These are the very cats of which we spoke. They've been remarkably tractable ever since."

Andreth is, of course, his usual taciturn self, sketching a deep bow along with the others, as formally as he knows how - and his time with the White Company is teaching him a little of formality. But only a little.

Starguard grins ruefully. "I am a bit older than the rest of the White Company. But I respect all their judgment. And am proud to be with them."

Ash waits patiently, reflecting anew on his encounter with Davan in light of what he knows about the Emperor himself.

The Emperor nods at Starguard. "Ah ... but do they respect yours?" He smiles. "Age far more often respects youth, than youth respecting ... wisdom?"

Starguard chuckles. "I don't consider myself all that wise. I just try to keep everyone moving and healthy as possible. Thank the stars things have mostly worked out so far."

Tilara chuckles. "Most of the time, Sire. He's had a lot more experience than we have."

Nodding once more, the Emperor turns to smile at Tilara. "Indeed, it would surprise me if he hadn't. Surprise, and, I might add, disappoint."

Tilara nods. "He gives us good advice, and he's not so impressed with his experience as to ignore our ideas. From what I've seen, the wisest always think they have more to learn. My father, in contrast, was convinced that he had all the answers."

Yuri chuckles. "There is, of course, the small matter of Starguard's healing abilities."

Yuri says, "It is easy to respect a man who has saved your life."

Yuri frowns inwardly for a moment. _Perf..._

Starguard blushes. "And mine has been saved by you."

That earns Tilara another nod, and a quick smile. "Parents can think that, don't they ..." His attention moves to Yuri. "A man who saves your life is a man you owe a great debt to, indeed." As he addresses Yuri, he moves to the fireplace, crouching down in front of the cats, who each open one eye warily. From a pocket he pulls out a small piece of bacon, offering it to Mirra.

Tilara nods. "We've all been through the mill a time or two, Starguard. But you're the one who's kept us mostly in one piece."

Andreth smiles and nods as he fingers the scar on his neck and glances at his companions, not needing to speak aloud the life-debt he owes them.

Mirra, after looking at her mistress, daintily accepts the piece of bacon. The Emperor smiles, stroking the other two cats briefly. "Marilan will enjoy meeting these: she's always been fond of cats."

Starguard says, "Anyway, I'm sure that the Emperor doesn't want to hear about who saved who."

Mirra purrs, and daintily takes the bacon from his hand, setting it down and licking the Emperor's fingers in greeting before going to work on it."

Stormy, following the conversation, moves to stand by the window, behind Starguard. _And you all saved me ... Over and over and over again._ He bites his lip, then straightens up. "And we all appreciated the help." He looks at Yuri ...

Ash simply smiles, and continues listening.

Yuri looks back at Stormy, not quite comprehending.

Yuri kneels down next to Stormy, and whispers, "Did I forget something?"

Stormy nods, leaning back. "Perf?"

Yuri nods, and says quietly, "I know. I can't forget about that. All in good time. I think that at the moment, the Emperor just wants to be among friends, and leave the business for later."

Stormy nods, biting his lip.

Yuri grins, and continues to speak quietly, "This may surprise you, but sometimes it's just as hard for the powerful to find honest friends, as it is for those who live in poverty. Relax for now."

The Emperor stretches to his full length again, smiling. "Marilan sends her apologies, by the way, dinner will be set back about a half hour. She is instructing Zamua, as to Potapki's care. They've been debating solutions all day." He sighs. "For some reason they've decided that a mere man like myself cannot possibly comprehend the steps they've taken." He looks around the room, then shakes his head. "There were supposed to be hors d'ouvres. Ever since Danior took sick ..." He steps to the door, opening it and issuing quick lowvoiced commands to the guard standing there.

Ash lets some of his assumed poise slip, watching this being comport himself like any other man, of any household you might find on the road or in a village. More assets than the humble warrior can envision, to be sure, but still..

Starguard says, "Sick?" Starguard's interest is perked, even realizing that the best healers are probably already attending an Emperor's man.

Yuri says, "I see. I'm not sure that I yet understand the import of the Andvari's warning, so I am glad if someone knows the proper action."

Stormy relaxes, standing behind Starguard. His shoulders are thrown back, his back is straight, and any observer would have to watch for at least five seconds to realize how nervous he really is.

The emperor smiles wryly at Starguard. "With great age comes ... Well, in this case, with great age comes aging retainers. Danior is getting on in years, and his heart isn't as strong as it used to be. His replacement, young Wenior, caught the measles last week and has been quarantined away from the family quarters."

Starguard hmms. "If your healers need any herbs, I have a rather...varied supply..."

Looking at Starguard, the Emperor's brow rises in an invitation to explain.

Starguard says, "I'm widely travelled, and have picked up some strange herbs on the way in. Maybe I can help."

Yuri says, "As you said, Sire, we have a half an hour. Is it not worth a look?"

Tilara says, "I'm not sure that's a good idea if the fellow's been quarantined. Perhaps after dinner?"

Starguard nods. "Supper first. I wouldn't want to miss a meal at the Emperor's table!"

The Emperor nods. "Indeed ... but not, I think, before the meal. Marilan is quite insistent on the quarantine; it has divided the household in half. Perhaps after dinner?" He turns to Tilara. "Indeed. Yes. And ah, here come the drinks now." A young footman wheels in a cart containing several plates with small appetizers. A second footman carries in a tray of glasses and two bottles of wine, which are put down on a table. Then, in turn, each guest is offered a choice between sherry and cognac, and drinks are served. The emperor looks pleased to offer these trifles.

Yuri subtly guides the coversation, at least, the White Company's side of it, so that everyone gets a chance to tell a few of the stories that they know - legends, personal experiences, philosophies. From Starguard, matters or religion and medicine; from Tilara, tavern tales and stories from her performing days; from Andreth, his meeting with Brother Oak; from Ash, the slice-of-life from the Syndics, as well as the man's unique perspective on class and nobility; and from Yuri, the details of the White Company's adventures. Yuri doesn't push Stormy to speak overmuch or too little, knowing that the youth is feeling under pressure and will not wish to discuss his past; even so, Stormy's take on many things, like the Barrows and the Brothers, are enlightening.

The Emperor makes a good listener, quietly ensuring everyone tries the appetizers, and asking the occasional question when someone seems shy or embarassed. He doesn't have many tales to tell of his own; when pressed, he speaks a little of the future. A future that seems to be in doubt, but will be led by youngsters such as the White Company and the various Brother and Sisterhoods that have been springing up.

Ash perks up at talk of this, but makes no attempt to speak - wiser heads than his are prevailing over the discussion.

Yuri looks over at Ash, to catch his attention, and mouths, 'Brotherhood?'

Ash shrugs, once, and speaks up at Yuri's prompting. "There was a Brotherhood, though it had no name.. founded by a man named Rendaralion, according to one man I spoke to. They swore allegiance to.. to you, sir, through your so.. uh, through Prince Fallon."

The Emperor looks suprised. "Rendaralion? I thought him ... fallen." He looks intently at Ash. "Which Brotherhood. What else do you know?"

"Well, er, they didn't properly give a name, sir," answers Ash slowly. "Just that they were building a Chapter house here, near the wall.. met a man named Davan, a novice of the order, and it was he that told me of them."

A single nod, then a long thoughtful sigh. "Will you go to that Chapter House for me, Ash? Learn what you can?" The Emperor looks into the fire. "I need to know what fealty they truly hold to, and what they are. And ... " He looks down at the cats, behind him, "It will be several days, at least, before you can leave to visit Samaela ... if you choose to go, that is."

Tilara's eyes narrow at that. "So long, Sire? Why the delay?"

Yuri looks a little worried. "We... don't have a choice in this matter, Sire. What do you intend?"

The Emperor spreads his hands. "I am awaiting the return of an emissary, you might say. He travels to visit Samaela, and I am hoping that you will travel with him."

Yuri feels his jaw drop, and then immediately shuts it. It takes several seconds before he finds his voice. "It's as simple as that, then? You know where to find her?"

The Emperor shakes his head. "Not yet. My emissary is ... a bit of a lone wolf. I am relying on you to report back in case he doesn't return."

Tilara nods. "This should be acceptable to the geas, then. As long as we continue to poke around for information while we wait for him."

Yuri nods. "I feel that our odds of success may be higher in the presence of such a man, and so the best course we can pursue to satisfy our geas is to aid him. Even if we have to wait... provided we don't have to wait too long."

Another single nod. "Indeed; the geas should not trouble you on that score. Keorn is due here any day now, and he is eager to be there for the Courting." The Emperor smiles. "Politics makes for strange bedfellows ... And your presence is very convenient."

Tilara chuckles, a bit wryly. "We've noticed that already..."

Andreth perks up a bit at the name Keorn. "Keorn... something about that name sounds familiar... like I've heard names like that before..."

Another nod, and a very relieved look. "Yes. A much better solution ..." At that moment, the door swings open, and the Empress Marilan enters, swooping down on her husband to give him a quick hug. "Will you introduce me, dear?"

Yuri rises to his feet, and motions to Stormy (and the others) that the same would be polite.

The Emperor, one arm on her shoulders, indicates each member of the White Company in turn. "Yuri, the ring leader. Ash, his right arm. Brother Starguard, the voice of wisdom I wondered about, Andreth, source of the geas, Tilara and Firestorm, the fire mages." She smiles at each in turn, then speaks up herself. "And I will wager, husband mine, that you've kept them talking, hungry as these younglings are. shall we feast?"

Tilara grins. "Your majesty, he's been the very soul of courtesy and has been feeding us hors d'ouvres while we waited on you. I trust that Potapka is doing well?"

Yuri doesn't bother to supress a chuckle. _She reminds me of my mother. No great surprise, I suppose._

Starguard smells the air, and scents of supper that waft faintly on the drafts. "Not that hors d'ouvers is a Emperor's main course, of course..."

The Empress nods. "Sleeping like a ... like a baby. Zamua has the watch. Along with the contingent of guards my husband arranged, who are all trying terribly hard not to clank." She frowns at him. "And I still don't think that that was necessary."

Andreth remembers the complaints about the trumpets on the way in, and barely stifles a chuckle at the comment about guards trying not to clank.

The Emperor blushes. "It might be ... it might be. Andvarr makes horrible prophecies, dear, you know that." He turns away a little, obviously trying to change the subject. "shall we be off then? Tilara, if you will walk with me? And ... Hmmm. Ash and Yuri, will you escort Marilan? I'm sorry the numbers are uneven, but Marilan did promise not to fret." He smiles, chucking his wife under the chin. She, in turn, merely raises one scarred eyebrow and waits to be flanked.

Starguard grins, and offers an elbow to Andreth and Stormy.

Yuri seems a little surprised, but does as he's instructed, and walks on Marilan's left, with Ash on Marilan's right.

Tilara looks a bit thoughtful. "Perhaps a roguish sort or two might be in order, as well, Sire. To guard against less obvious approaches." She's actually flustered for a moment as the Emperor offers his arm to her, but controls it and glides up to stand beside him with her best performer's smile.

The emperor looks down at Tilara. "A roguish sort ... ah. You, too, don't trust the simple magical wards I've set?"

Yuri, for once, looks a bit lost. _Is this Protocol, or precaution?_ He tries not to show it to Marilan, but he doesn't attempt to hide his confusion from Ash.

Tilara shrugs. "What one man can set up, another can circumvent, Sire. I'd think it best to have living minds watching over your daughter rather than depend on contingencies in a spell." She grins. "And I learned early on not to be too trustful."

The Emperor sighs, smiling. "Women, the world over." He leads the small procession down the hall to an intimate dining room, with places set for seven people. "Yes, Tilara, I promise. I have ... other watchers. Tomorrow, the cats will meet my daughter; I think they'll be good friends in very little time at all. She has that effect on cats."

Yuri thinks, _And now, however briefly, we are Honor Guard to the Empress. Oh, father. You really won't believe it!_

Ash walks quietly, his every thought bent on his escort, her role in this kingdom and her peculiar history. Doubts, too, filter through his mind, though more out of natural suspicion and lack of knowledge. All in all, the Empress' very existence gives him much food for thought.

Tilara smiles. "A very good thought, Sire. I should have realized you weren't depending on just the warriors. Still, one never knows if someone else has thought of everything that occurs to you."

Andreth falls in behind with Starguard and Stormy, curious about the peculiar arrangements, though his companions already are asking any question he could think to ask.

The Emperor seats Tilara at his left, while Marilan subtly directs her escorts to escort her to the foot of the table, across from the Emperor. The others are encouraged to find seats. The room itself is simple, decorated with only three pictures, and with large drapes which are currently held back so that people can see the skies beyond. Rapidly darkening skies. It is, after all, getting on in the evening.

As soon as everyone is seated, a footman circles the table, starting with Tilara, serving everyone a light broth. "We thought we would keep the fare simple tonight", Marilan observes. "This is a simple turtle soup." There is bread, in small baskets, and a second footman follows the first, circling the table and pouring wine. After the course is served, the footmen disappear.

Starguard smiles, sipping the wine, looking around the table. Gods, Emperors...this is an interesting path for a doctor to take...

The Empress, smiling happily, tries engaging each of the Company members in a little social conversation, while the turtle soup quickly disappears. She's quite keen in hearing about people's childhoods. Although even with her encouragement, Stormy says almost nothing.

Starguard tries to deflect attention away from Stormy's reluctance, switching things to other members of the party best he can.

As the last of the soup is consumed, the footmen return, one freshing drinks, a second removing the bowls, a third replacing them with plates. And then all three disappear for a moment, and return carrying three large serving plates with sliced roast beef, spring potatoes, and fresh steamed asparagus. Each, in turn, is offered to every guest, after which the plates are set on a sideboard.

Marilan eyes Stormy thoughtfully, then turns to Starguard. "My husband mentioned you were a healer ... has he told you of the epidemic raging through our household?"

Tilara chuckles. "It was all we could do to keep him from running off right away and ending up on the other side of the quarantine..."

Starguard says, "I have a little more caution than that, Til. But admittedly, I am curious."

Marilan nods. "A true Healer, then. Wenior lies sick with the measles, as do three maids, seven footmen, and twelve guards. We've sequestered them; food is delivered magically, and their nurses have all had measles themselves. But ... the disease seems to run faster than usual; while lasting longer than it should."

Starguard hmms. "Perhaps a new variety of the disease? Sometimes a disease can be stronger or weaker at times."

Marilan nods, slowly. "Perhaps. Will you come, in any case? Perhaps your herbs can be of aid ..."

Starguard says, "And if we're being paranoid tonight, it could be cultured, then passed on to a member of the household..."

Marilan nods. "That's why we have a tight quarantine." She shakes her head, looking down at her plate. "I don't understand the message we got: my baby doesn't even **have** a crown. How can it be a noose when it doesn't exist?"

Yuri puts down his utensils for a moment, and then speaks.

Starguard says, "Metaphorically. She's a princess, and royalty. Her power is the noose. The seven princes are likely to be jealous."

Yuri says, "The Andvarii live in a place where the very walls - and indeed their skins - are inscribed in stories, and metaphors for reality. So it's all very much subject to interpretation."

Yuri looks at nobody in particular as he continues. "As a result... a great deal of the outcome of a prophecy is... ironically... a matter of choice."

Yuri steeples his fingers and is lost in thought for a moment. "Potapki... Potapka... both make crowns to quiet an uneasy beast..."

Tilara says, "Perhaps a long-term warning... but that would not explain the urgency behind it."

Yuri stops speaking, and his eyes widen. After a moment he regains his composure and reaches for a mug of ale.

Marilan bites her lip, her fork slowly macerating a potato. When she looks down, she looks surprised, and then spears a small piece into her mouth. While she chews, the Emperor looks at Yuri and Starguard. "Yes; my sons are most definitely jealous. Some more than others. This is not uncommon between half siblings." He raises his fork, using it to point at Yuri. "But you will interpret your part in the prophecy. And I expect you will all", he waves his fork at the entire group, "make good choices that honour and serve the Empire."

Stormy, when the fork points at him, blushes, and stammers and tries very hard to fade into his chair. Marilan flashes a smile at him, in encouragement, and even winks.

Tilara nods. "And the citizens of the Empire. They are, in the final analysis, what really matters, correct?"

Andreth nods emphatically to the Empress, meeting her gaze. His mouth is full of roast beef at the moment, but he couldn't imagine any words to add in any case.

Starguard says, "We'll try, your eminince. Though I'm sure we'll mess up one or two and have to scramble to rectify things."

Yuri nods to the Emperor. "We have our roles prepared for us, and we have chosen to take them on. However, I'm sure Tilara will attest - the player makes the part, more often than the other way around."

"The citizens, Tilara, **are** the empire. Without them, I am just an old and happy husband, with a few wayward sons, a darling wife, and an adorable baby daughter." The Emperor smiles to take the sting out of his words.

Tilara bows to the Emperor then, or as much of one as she can while seated beside him. "And this is the Emperor I am proud to serve. Your sons do not always realize this, I fear."

Starguard hmms, "Would you mind telling us of your view of the political situation of you realm? You'd certainly have a different view than we would, I think."

Yuri sips at his ale. _So... if I'm right... she was born, so that he could retire. The burden of leadership must be heavy on him, after all this time._

The Emperor smiles. "My sons have been ... waiting. For a very long time. Now, they fear dying before me. And those who hunger for power the most, fear also." He looks at his wineglass, and takes a long sip. "I think, perhaps, I must tell you more of our history." He smiles down the table at Marilan. "After the great battle was fought, and our people lay dying, and dead, we began to rebuild immediately. I had one son, then, Lurin. He was old enough to fight, and did so bravely, and I had hoped that one day he would inherit the empire after me."

Yuri sits and listens quietly. Having finished with the food, he sips at an ale, considering the import of what is being discussed.

A deep sigh. "I did not expect to live as long as this." The emperor takes another sip, and then stands up to refresh his wine, before offering wine to everyone else around the table. "After the war, we gave him several brothers in fairly rapid succession. Cel, Fallon, and Aglamarno are all full brothers to Lurin. And then my wife grew older, and could bear no more children, and in time she sickened with age, and died. Curiously, I had not aged."

Starguard tightens a little at the mention of Lurin. It's been only a few years since he worked on that front...

A brief pauses, while he waits for that to sink in. Then the Emperor continued. "In time, three more princes were born. Mirrimor and Reshkino were born to Mirresh; Aiscalion was the son of Aisa Firehair. And when Aiscalion was born, Lurin was already in his third decade, and eager to inherit. And curiously, I had not aged."

Andreth rubs his chin as he listens to the story, not commenting so far, although his mind is churning. _How impatient Lurin must have been... and the others as well..._

"Lurin, on the other hand, had aged. He had become a leader, of sorts. A proud man, and inclined to bully his brothers occasionally." The emperor looked down at his wine. "He was not strong enough to lead the empire then, though he wished mightily to do so. But I was still alive, and he was proud. Too proud to try to overthrow me. Until his patience ran thin." The emperor's lips thin. "More fool he: he failed to understand how the empire works; and lost. Lost badly. I sent my sons to live with Ungfallen for a time, until he should judge them mature enough to return."

"In time, my sons were sent back to me. All, now, were much older than the span of years most humans expect to live. And I myself, had aged but little. All looked older than I did." The Emperor sighs, getting up, and refreshing his wine. "They were ... more mature than when they left, but I agreed with Ungfallen. None of them were suited to the role of emperor. You must understand; once the Flatlands were composed of a number of smaller kingdoms. We had all united to throw off the Stormwinds, but there was growing distress. Loud and bitter recriminations between those people who had lost many, and those who had lost relatively few. It was time to bring peace, now that the bickering had started ..."

Yuri says, "And so... you weave a Birthing Crown."

Yuri says, "Or... more accurately... you wish your daughter to do so."

Yuri sits quietly, rubbing his hands together casually, because there is little else to do.

The Emperor shakes his head at Yuri. "You jump ahead too far. We have not reached Marilan's part in the tale yet. Let me continue a little more. There were eight major kingdoms. One was completely destroyed; not a single citizen remained alive. So I divided the empire into seven parts, and gave them to my sons. They have most - but not all - the power that they will gain at my death. They have held this power, now, for three generations. It has mellowed some of my sons, who have raised large families and are content with their children, and grandchildren, and great grandchildren. It has angered others, who seek to expand their borders when I am not looking ..."

Starguard hmmphs. "Lurin," he interjects.

The emperor nods at Starguard. "Lurin. Who was quite infuriated that his empire should become a tiny kingdom. Much of his energy is spent on the Stormwinds, whom he harries as he can ... and the rest he spends on his borders."

Starguard says, "I fought three terms on the Lurinese border as a doctor. I'm well aware. But continue."

Tilara nods. "Aye. Prince Aglamarno spends more of his army warding off his brother than he does the Stormwinds."

The Emperor nods, sadly. "But ... short of killing my son, and setting his son in his place, and you may recall, Brother Starguard, that the son is less restrained than the father, short of that I can offer only moral suasion. I promised my sons that. And already, they think I have broken my promises to them by marrying Marilan." He pauses to smile at his wife. "But I would have married her were I a farmer, or a soldier, or, as I am, an emperor. And that would not have broken the promises. But they fear that I will redraw the lines, when my daughter is of age, and give her, also, a kingdom." Marilan's eyes darken, as she shakes her head wordlessly.

Yuri thinks, _I'm not sure that she likes this. She'd probably like her daughter to have more choice in the matter._

Marilan takes up the story. "They're wrong, of course. Our daughter was not planned, nor will she have any role to take up that she does not choose for herself. As an eighth child, she will have that freedom, if she has nothing else." Her words are as fierce as her tone, and she looks intently at her husband, down the length of the table.

Tilara nods, toying with the remains of her dinner and sipping wine. "So, what would you have us do when we go to find Sameala?"

Her husband meekly nods. "So you see; what the princes fear is not what we have planned for our daughter." He looks down the table. "Which is to say; we don't have any plans for our daughter whatsoever. Or for her younger sibling, when he or she is born in Willatha or Kenatha ..."

Tilara blinks at that. "You _know_ this will happen, Sire?"

Yuri says, "Oh, my. We'd heard nothing about that." He looks around at the company, pointedly. "And the public isn't going to find out about it from us."

Marilan glares at her husband, then turns to Tilara, one hand now cradling her still flat belly. "When Keorn goes to the Courting, he goes as a suitor. We need to know whom she chooses, and how. And ... Yes, Yuri, you're quite right. We haven't shared this information yet. We had not intended to, had we, dear?" Her voice could chill coffee to ice cubes.

Starguard sighs. "More children. That will not go over well..."

Starguard says, "Granted, a good pair of months, in my opinion." He grins a little, trying to take the chill out of the room.

Tilara says, "Aye. And we will not speak of this to anyone. Especially not Tormel. As well we didn't ask to bring him tonight."

Marilan sighs. "No. It won't. But ... I cannot rip the life from me, so it will be born. And we will cherish it, won't we, dear?" Again, her voice chills, and her husband nods, looking slightly abashed. "Of course we will", he insists. "We already do."

Tilara stays carefully bland at this exchange, sipping her wine again and wondering just what arguments went on in private....

Ash rakes recently-cleaned fingernails over his left knee out of sight, growing increasingly nervous at being party to such tension-causing information.

Yuri says, "Do you suppose... that we could send for something stronger than wine? I didn't expect this to be an entirely casual affair... but nor did I expect matters of such import to cross our domain this evening."

Andreth sips a bit of his wine, not commenting. This seems quite enough for him, frankly.

The Emperor nods, gratefully, at Yuri. "Yes. I do believe it's time for dessert. And if they bring in the cognac at the same time ... Marilan requested simple sorbets; she thought you might enjoy those." Somehow, footmen are summoned, and the table is quickly emptied. Then, each person is served a large strawberry sorbet, and a smaller glass of cognac.

Starguard smiles. "My compliments to your chef. And sorbet is an honor this late in the year."

Ash peers oddly at the dessert offering, trying to puzzle out the point. He peers surreptitiously over at the others, waiting and watching with as much subtlety as he can muster.

Marilan watches her guests try the sorbets, and smiles at their reactions. "But, as to Samaela. What we need are observers. Observers who are guaranteed to return."

Ash tries to lighten his own mood by replying, "I think you'll find that even death won't hold us back, milady."

Andreth mmmphs and nearly chokes on a spoonful of sorbet.

Yuri mentions distracedly, "Oh, yes, we've been through that one before."

Starguard says, "So far, at any rate. Kenilthwen and Withorwen willing, that will continue."

Tilara tastes it curiously and then her eyes light up. "I've never had this before. Nice to have a winter garden available, isn't it?" She coughs at Ash' comment.

Yuri tries the sorbet, distracted from weightier matters by the novelty of the confection.

Marilan blinks at Ash's comment. "Your ... strength of purpose ... astounds me. But this is good to know." She smiles at her husband, the earlier chill forgotten. "You were right, dear. They do match the prophecy. Five shall come, to save the one, and all shall see, and bring back word."

Ash decides he's in enough good graces to pipe up, "Er. Technically there's six.."

Starguard says, "Prophecy?"

Marilan smiles at Ash. "Yes. Andreth. He's the one you saved, isn't he?"

Ash nods thoughtfully. Point taken.

Yuri chokes on his sorbet. "Prophecy? Please tell me you're joking."

Tilara says, "I've got a very bad feeling about this...."

The Emperor turns to Starguard. "One of our retainers is given to prophecies. Short ones. No sense of rhyme. And frequently, no sense of time or place. But this one she made quite recently, and she was most insistent. I believe she spoke it the night you accepted your geas?"

Starguard looks upward. "Not that this is all that surprising, you know."

Andreth's scarred face colors like the sunset, and his eyes flick back and forth along the table.

Starguard says, "Depends. We took the geas on...what day is this?"

Tilara gives Starguard a twisted grin. "They do seem to have a bit of a warped sense of humor, don't they?"

Marilan smiles. "Today is Lurimain the 3rd."

Starguard says, "So that would have been then 22nd...no, the 23rd of Muirnin."

Andreth looks into his sorbet, as if it would provide some insight. "Will wonders never cease..."

Yuri sighs. "I don't suppose it changes much. We're going to do what we think is right, prophecy or not."

Starguard nods to Tilara. "I'm beginning to notice that, yes."

Ash asides to Yuri, "I think that's why the prophecy will work."

Yuri asides back at Ash, "Lucky for it, then. I think we're too busy to make it happen on purpose."

The Emperor and Marilan watch the discussion in bemusement. _I know what it's like to discover how the gods have rearranged your life_, she thinks, sending a smile at her husband. _Even the ones who don't know they're gods._

Yuri says, "So... Sire... do you know who she is? I mean, did you know before we arrived, and if so, why didn't you tell anyone? The fourth spire has been driving wise men mad with curiosity." He pauses. "And us, as well."

The Emperor cradles his cognac in his hands, and looks down. "I suppose ... I suppose you deserve to know what we know."

Yuri says, "With respect, Sire... I think you can believe that we're acting in the best interests of the citizens here. Even if it's by accident."

He looks at his glass again. "We did not know as much as we wished to know, Yuri, until you came to us. You brought ... connections, between seemingly unrelated facts." He pauses, then slowly takes up the line of thought. "We did not know the connection between Samaela and Miardan. That ... explains much. We had just learned that Keorn would go the Courtship, but we did not know who she was, nor what it was. Now ... now we know that my eldest son once did something that was ... evil." He takes a sigh. "There's more history in this."

"Once, there was a hermit, Miardan, who lived alone in the mountains. She was, eventually, courted by a young man, and bore him eight children, seven daughters and a still born son. And when her son died, so did she. The older children were brough to Lurin, by their father, and joined a small village. But things did not go well, and once, when Lurin was visiting, he witnessed one of the daughters changing into a hunting cat in front of his eyes. He went ... berserk, you might say, and demanded that they be hunted down, and killed, these unnatural villagers."

Yuri works on eating the sorbet as the Emperor speaks, before it melts. _The truth won't change. This, however, is a fleeting luxury, and I shall not waste it._

The Emperor sighs. "So these daughters and their children were cast out, by the village headsman, and their father, in his rage, killed a villager and his wife and child. It was not a peaceful parting of the ways. The villagers vowed to avenge Luriel de Lurin, and his wife Allana, and their young son. And Miardan's children were hunted deep into the mountains, where they disappeared. Until now."

Tilara sighs as she eats. _Oh, yes... unnatural. Just like I was an_ unnatural _daughter who wouldn't obey her father's dictates. Damn fool._

Another sigh. "Now, we know why her children would hate us. And now we know how we offended. So we send Keorn, who was raised as Marilan's foster sibling, and hope that we can make peace. And, we hope to send you." He looks around the circle. "Youth, and wisdom, ones who have lived easy lives, and others who have not. We send forth our best citizens, and hope we may bring peace before it turns into war."

Andreth's eyes widen, and he nods. "To make peace with the Changers..." he says slowly as the enormity of the task at hand.

Starguard says, "My..."

Tilara says, "....Gods."

Tilara shakes herself from that reverie. "If we can at least make contact with them, that is half the battle. We shall try our best, Sire."

Yuri steeples his fingers in front of what has become his 'thinking face'. "So... where does Samaela fit into all of this? One of the seven daughers of Miardan? We think so. But why is her name on top of the spire and not Miardan's?"

The Emperor nods. "If I go, they will deservedly cry bloodfeud, and there will be no peace. If my son goes ... they will not even cry, but will simply attack. If you go, you may be able to build a bridge before bloodfeud is declared." He smiles weakly. "This may be a fatal journey; the prophecy does not guarantee that you will all return." He turns to Yuri. "Samaela is one of the descendants of Miardan. In her, it is said, the blood of her father grows strong. She will ... unite the Changers. Or so we hope."

Tilara says, "And then we can negotiate with one paramount leader instead of dealing with angry barbarians with no central authority. One wonders what we must do if they decide that Lurin's blood is the price of peace..."

Andreth shakes his head at Tilara. "We won't _know_ till we try."

The emperor sighs. "Let us hope ... it won't come to that, Tilara. Let us devoutly hope."

Yuri says, "There's no need to consider that mess until it's upon us, Til."

Yuri says, "Somewhere on the other side, there will be people like us. People who know the value of peace, and how to build its foundations. We'll give them the allies they need, and they shall give us the same."

The Emperor nods. "This will be a long, arduous journey, I'm afraid. It will not be easy to reach them, and Keorn is not used to traveling with other people. I will gift you with a crystal ball; it will allow you to talk with the Abbot of the Brothers of the Waters. He knows you will receive it tonight." He sips his cognac. "And in the spirit of this quest, I will grant two other boons before you leave."

Yuri looks over at Ash, then speaks to the Emperor. "The first is easy for us to choose. If it's in your power, we want Perf raised. That will satisfy our obligation to him. The other... we'll have to discuss. I think we have plans to make."

Marilan smiles. "We rather expected you would spend one boon on Perf. It does you credit. We have already arranged his raising; we will know come morning whether it was successful." The Emperor nods, smiling also. "Yes. For the other, return in two days' time. Then, Yuri, you may return my ring, and I shall grant your boon." He pulls out a small leather pouch that was hanging from his chair, out of sight. "This contains a simple crystal ball, and a small wooden wand. Tap the ball with the wand; the abbot will be summoned. But please remember that he is an old man; he needs his sleep."

Tilara chuckles. "We'll call him in the morning, then. I assume it can be used more than once?"

The Emperor nods. "It's an old, enduring magic. When you break the wand, the ball will shatter."

Yuri nods, and accepts the pouch. "We'll use it with discretion."

Ash speaks up. "It seems, sir, that our role as observers would be best served with such a device.. if it is safe to report to the Abbot, and you can be assured that he will report discreetly to you, would that be a wise course?"

Marilan nods, smiling. "I am glad to hear that." She puts her hand on her stomache, again. "I fear, gentlemen, Tilara, that you will have to excuse me. I ... tire more easily, now."

The Emperor nods, once more, at Ash. "Yes. The Abbot and I converse ... regularly." He smiles dryly. "He was most anxious to hear of your arrival."

Tilara stands as the Empress leaves. "Of course, milady. Thank you for the dinner."

Starguard nods. "Should I return in the morning to talk to the healers about the quarentine?"

Marilan looks to her husband. "Perhaps he can see the healers now. I ... I am not feeling well." She looks a little green, but smiles at Tilara. "These first few months are ... difficult."

Andreth rubs his chin, after Marilan leaves, and he turns his head to the Emperor. "Um... somethin' else is worryin' me. That business with those people with the feather portals 'n all... stirrin' up trouble..."

Yuri says, "Could be a faction within the Changers... could be someone else who has an interest in making trouble for either us, or them."

The Emperor sits down again, after his wife leaves. "Yes. The feather portals are ... disturbing. There is another force at work in the Empire. We don't know what it is yet, or whom. Or how they create the portals; our mages have not been able to duplicate the effect."

Andreth says, "Are they happenin' all over? We only been on the road from Woolwich to Citadel..."

Yuri says, "I hope we find out who. We could just light one and see where it leads, of course, but that seems very risky."

Yuri says, "I'm having a hard time with them interfering with our efforts to make peace. It's getting... personal."

Tilara says, "There may be more to the ritual than just lighting one. We do have some of those feathers, though, if that would help their studies."

The Emperor nods again. "That would be ... most helpful. If you are willing to part with them. Merely observing what happens when we burn one will tell us much, I suspect."

Tilara says, "They're not really doing me any good. I'll bring a couple of them back tomorrow - who should I give them to?"

"Bring them to the gate, Tilara. With the ring that Yuri has. The guards will know where to take them." The emperor looks at the ring. "That ring is going to be ... busy."

Tilara says, "Earning its keep, then, Sire. I'll bring it by as soon as I've had breakfast."

The Emperor nods again, then rises once more to his feet. "I am afraid, gentlemen, Tilara, that I should attend to my wife. She ... dislikes being pregnant. Very much. It only seems fair I should bear the burden, rather than her maid."

As he stands, he turns to look at Andreth. "As for the feathers; we've found them in every Kingdom barring Calais."

Yuri says, "That in itself may indicate something. Although it would be unwise to jump to conclusions - Calais is remote, perhaps our troublemakers simply haven't had a need to go there yet."

He sighs. "Let us hope. Aiscalion was always a good son."

Tilara says, "Or perhaps they've been more circumspect. Either way, we'll need to find out."

Yuri stands and bows. "You have been quite generous, Excellency. We will do our best to justify your faith in us."

The Emperor smiles. He moves to the door, summoning a footman. "I apologize for the short shift, all of a sudden, but Marilan was ... greener than usual. Denis will escort you to the gate."

Tilara sighs. "I hope she's not getting sick."

Starguard says, "It's alright, Tilara. It seemed that it's the pregnancy, likely. Not abnormal."

The Emperor smiles, over his shoulder. "She'll be fine. Just a few more months." Then he disappears, down the hall, and the footman, Denis, stands, waiting.
