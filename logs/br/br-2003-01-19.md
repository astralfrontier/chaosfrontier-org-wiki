# Birthright 2003-01-19

After an interesting dinner with the Emperor and his wife, Marilan, the party is escorted back to the gate. En route, a footman rushes up, delivering a small velvet pouch containing a crystall ball, and a wand protected in a wooden case. The party makes it's way back to the inn.

Tilara puts her feet up after they get back. "A fascinating dinner, but just a bit nervous at first. He seems a normal person, though, in spite of it all. A lot less formal than his kids."

Stormy nods. "He was ... a lot less frightening than his sons. I ... I liked the empress."

Tilara nods. "Aye, so did I. But she hasn't been Emperor for over a century."

Stormy bites his lip. "But the Emperor has ... and he was still ... He wasn't really scary at all. Except sort of."

Andreth nods quietly. "No wonder folks love 'im. Wish his sons would learn from 'im rather than squabblin' like cats 'n dogs..."

Tilara nods. "Got that right, Andreth. It can't be any good for the Empire, either. They'll get us in a war we don't need at this rate."

Stormy shrugs. "I don't understand them. They had everything. Food, a roof, a family. And then they do this?"

Tilara gives her protege a hug. "When they grow up not having to worry about those things, some folks decide that it's not important - and they want more."

"Same reason I'm here," volunteers Ash, "at least, a similar reason. They saw more of the world and it interests them. Of course, I'm out to see it, they're out to rule it."

Stormy hugs Tilara back, blushing. "I suppose." He looks at Ash, sideways, and bites his lips.

Andreth says, "Guess they're just more selfish. Poor fella," he adds, nodding back toward the palace. "Must be awful to see your kids turn out like that."

Stormy drains his tankard, looking tired. "Should we make the report tomorrow?"

Tilara says, "I think that'll be soon enough. If he's more anxious, he can contact us, right?"

Starguard nods. "After weeks already, one day won't matter much."

Stormy blinks. "The crystal ball works in both directions?"

Tilara says, "I'd be surprised if it didn't. He did say he talks to them regularly." She stretches, yawning. "Let's call it a night, then."

---

After a quiet night, and a quick breakfast, the party gathers in the inn's parlour room which they had specially requested from the innkeeper. The crystal ball, lying on its pouch, gets pride of place in the centre of the table.

Tilara actually gets up early for once, interested in contacting the old Abbott and seeing what he makes of the information.

Yuri, after making sure everyone is present and the door is closed, smiles at Andreth. "Do you want to do the honours?"

Andreth nods quietly to Yuri. Looking round to nod at his compatriots, he reverently removes the wand from its wooden case and delicately taps the crystal sphere.

The crystal begins to glow, levitating about an inch off the table ...

Ash waits patiently and, truth be known, a bit uncomfortably. A sword, that's one thing, it makes sense. But a glowing ball of crystal that flies?

A light begins to shine in the centre. It pulses a few times, then steadies into a soft teal glow.

A voice comes through the crystal. It sounds ... familiar. "Yes? I'm sorry, Emperor, but the abbot is currently resting. Please may I take a message?"

Starguard says, "I'm afraid this is not the Emperor. This is the party of the geas."

Andreth starts as the voice comes through, giving a nervous look to Yuri, before breathing a sigh of relief as Starguard takes over for him.

The voice sounds surprised. "The geas? What geas? Who are you? Identify yourself immediately!" Raising in volume, the voice becomes more recognizable. It's good old Liowen, running interference as usual.

Tilara clears her throat. "He loaned us the crystal to report back, Liowen. Recall the young monk who was resurrected?"

"Yes. Yes." The voice is definitely testy. "Took the abbot weeks to recover. Don't tell me you've lost him again!"

Andreth laughs at that. "No, I'm alive 'n well..."

Tilara chuckles. "We're just planning to give a preliminary report on what we've found out about Sameala. When will the abbott be available?"

The voice gentles a little, at the sounds of Andreth's words. "Good to hear. Good to hear. Well; if you are willing to stand by for a few moments, the abbot will be ready to talk to you."

Starguard says, "We'll wait."

As the party waits, they can hear two voices, seemingly coming from a long distance. One is soft, and kidly. The old abbot, obviously. The other is obviously trying to dissuade him from something.

Andreth lets a trace of annoyance cross his face, and he sighs. "Some people don't know when ta quit..." he mumbles.

A few moments later, the old abbot comes on. "Hello? Hello?"

Andreth coughs. "Abbot, sir? It's Andreth 'n my friends. We got some news to give you 'bout Samaela..."

The abbot nods. "Ah. Andreth. Good to hear your voice, lad. What news?"

Andreth struggles with the words, trying to distill the flood of knowledge from yesterday evening. "Turns out..." he begins, "that Samaela is the name of... uh, I guess she must be like a princess or somethin. Of the Changers..."

The abbot sounds eager. "Yes. We've heard rumours of a Courtship."

Tilara says, "Aye, sir. Those words have appeared on the spire now, and we are going to be accompanying one of the Emperor's people to visit the Changers."

"Yes ... yes. Who will you be traveling with?" The abbot sounds ... almost worried.

Andreth scratches his head. "'is name's Keorn. We're waitin' 'ere for 'im to get back from... from... Starguard, where was he s'posed to be doin'?"

Starguard says, "I don't think the Emperor said, actually. Just that he'd be back any day now."

There's a long pause. "I see. Well, we've been doing some research here, too. Rolwen sends a warning; Palla found an ancient prophecy warning of the Courtship. Whatever you do, do not become a participant in the Courtship. And Palla asks if you still have those cards he gave you."

Starguard says, "We still have the cards, yes. But we're supposed to be going to the Courtship..."

"Good. Good. Palla thinks the cards may be important. The riddles. He's ... been dreaming again."

Andreth pipes up. "Abbot, on the way to Citadel, we found these barrows near Thorpenhow. They 'ad bindweed bloomin 'round them - blue 'n yellow, just like on the cards." He doesn't hold out much hope that this will provide the abbot any new insight, but at least he'll be able to share his ignorance.

"Blue ... and yellow? Bindweed? Did you disturb the barrows?" The voice sounds a little sharp.

Andreth gives Starguard an intensely worried look, but doesn't speak right away...

Starguard says, "Yes, sir. We needed to in order to slow a war..."

"Oh. I see." There's some whispering; almost impossible to make out.

"Well, nothing to be done for it now. So you go to visit Samaela. Have you learned anything else?"

Tilara says, "Sameala turns out to be a descendant of Miardan, the hermit. Lurin discovered that her children were Changers and drove them out of his kingdom... but now the prophecies say she may unite the Changers, and the Courtship may be critical. We're apparently in the prophecies, too."

Andreth's eyes widen still further, as he listens acutely, but he sighs. As soon as we can, he resolves, we must return to Thorpenhow, and see if we can help to restore the unquiet dead to their rest...

"Thank you." The voice begins to fade. "Remember ... don't enter the Courtship! It's evry important!"

Tilara says, "Can you tell us why?"

Andreth nods. "Thank you once again, Father," he says, with deep gratitude.

The light begins to fade. The abbot speaks a last time ... "It's dangerous! Failed Suitors may ..." The light is gone.

Tilara says, "Drat. Seems to have a time limit. Well, I'm not in the running for the Courtship anyway, I suspect. But you don't want to be a failed suitor."

Tilara says, "And ... now that that's done, I have feathers to deliver."

Stormy tags Tilara on the sleeve. "Mind if I join you?

Andreth peers at the ball as it rests on the table. "Uh... were we s'posed to give this back when we were done with it? I don't remember..."

Tilara says, "Don't mind at all, Stormy. We can work the crowds on the way back."

Stormy nods. "Okay."

Tilara shakes her head. "No, we're supposed to use it to report back in an emergency, Andreth. In case it looks like we won't make it out."

Andreth nods. "Guess so," he says, carefully re-stowing the precious device.

Tilara says, "It's valuable. But apparently the mission is worth the risk."

Splitting up, now, Tilara and Stormy head back to the castle. Time to deliver a feather, and perhaps do some juggling on the way back. Poor, inn-bound Starguard never does get to see much the city; he's still making potions as quickly as he can. And that leaves Ash, Andreth, and Yuri to pursue the other lines of inquiry.

The first of which is to get those other little items identified. Using Yuri's skill at gathering pertinent information, the trio quickly track down a mage who is willing to perform the identification spells for a erasonable price. But, they are warned, the endeavour will require some time. He keeps the items, and asks the trio to return in two days time.

Then, the trio turn their steps towards the Brotherhood. It takes some time to find the Chapter house, which is actually a fairly small, non prepossessing building. Obviously, once it was a warehouse. There are still large double doors, besides which smaller doors stand open. Inside, the main hall is a weapons hall, where fighters are training using padded armour.

As the trio approach, a young boy dressed in a simple tunic approaches them. "Good sirs?"

"Ash! Ash of Lainsbrough!" Davan comes sliding through the hall, stepping between the fights. As he reaches the trio, he pats the boy on the shoulder. He smiles at Ash, inviting Ash to join him, while directing the boy to attend to the other two.

Andreth bows in greeting to Davan, then turns to the lad. "What manner o' place is this?" he asks politely, his eye scanning the ranks of fighters and observing their style.

The boy's eyes light up. "Why, sir, it's home! Home to the lost and the downtrodden! We're going to ... " He pauses for a moment, trying to remember the catechism. " ... follow Fallon and Rendaralion and we will be the Protectors of the Empire. We shall slay evil men, and educate the ignorant! We shall protect the landman, the sailor, the tinker, the tailor, and we'll ... ummm ... we'll eat three square meals a day and sleep in warm beds." The last sentence comes flying out at top speed.

Ash's mouth is open - he had prepared to speak, but nothing could compare to the outpouring of enthusiasm the lad generated.

Andreth laughs. "Noble goals, all. Even that last one," he says, grinning and winking at the lad.

Davan grins, watching the boy. "Two weeks ago, that boy was covered in welts, and dirty from head to foot."

The boy nods. "Yes sir, noble patron, sir. Specially the last one." He hops from foot to foot. "Will you be joining us, sir? Shall I show you around?"

Ash says, "By all means, show us around."

Andreth nods. "I remember bein' like that, afore Brother Oak took me in," he says, giving Davan a respectful look - clearly anyone who would take in a street urchin gains marks in Andreth's book.

The boy sets off at a quick pace, Davan following indulgently behind. "Here's where we learn how to fight! It's very important to learn how to fight! The master says if we can't fight we can't protect those weaker'n ourselves, on account of there not being anyone weaker'n ourselves. I started learning the short sword last week. See? The only bruises I've got is old, I'm getting better, Master says." Davan grins. "What he means, gentlemen, is that he started learning to duck."

Passing along the edge of the hall, the boy points out several doors. "Dorm room. Dining room. Kitchen." The smell of good plain stew comes wafting out, mixed with the smell of fresh bread. "Upstairs is where the masters sleep. We can't go there yet." Davan steps forward. "Our libraries, Ash, are upstairs. Such as we have. You had ... questions?"

Ash scratches at his chin thoughtfully, hoping \`country bumpkin' prevails over \`agent of the Emperor' as far as his demeanor goes. "Well.. I'm no great shakes as a traveller," he begins, "so I can't claim to have heard much.. but how widely spread are you and your fellows now?"

Davan nods. "Well, I don't know everything, mind. I'm not a Master yet. But we have this chapter house here, and a full chapter in Fallan. And we've started outposts in Reshki and Calais. So ... we're growing." He strokes his chin. "There's been enough battle; our message of peace is very popular."

The urchin nods up and down. "Yeah! If people don't want peace, we smash em till they do!" Davan looks down at the boy, a frown creasing his brow. "No, lad. Not quite. We **pprotect** those that need pprotecting, and we **teach** them to protect themselves."

Ash nods along, smiling. "Takes quite a special sort of man to lead a band of such folks from almost nothing.. Surely he can't run it alone though. So how does it all fit together?"

Davan looks thoughtful. "I don't exactly know. Each Chapter house has a master, of course, and he has other Brothers working for him. And then there's Rendaralion. he keeps traveling between chapters. To keep the masters honest, he says." There's a short pause. "Most of the money comes from fallon, although, Ash of Lainsbrough, we always gladly accept donations to this worthy cause."

Ash laughs lightly at the last bit. "I'm afraid my meager purse can't match the coffers of the Prince or his kingdom.."

Davan shrugs. "We take each donation; we're not choosy. I, myself, work as a guard and donate my wages to the Chapter. Many of us, in fact, do the same. It allows us to stay focused on our skills, while supporting the younglings, like this one over here." He pats the boy on the head. "A youngling who should be training. Go on, lad. back to the hall."

Andreth nods, rubbing his chin. "Uh... the Brotherhood of what, by the way?"

"Why ... the Brotherhood of ... " Davan pauses. "You know; I don't recall. I never thought to ask. Come, why don't we go upstairs?"

Ash nods. "That'd be much appreciated."

Andreth nods as well.

Davan leads the party up a short flight of stairs. The hallway stretches the width of the building, with doors on both sides. Most doors are closed, but the second door on the left stands open. behind it is a room containing three bookshelves, mostly covered in bric-a-brac, and a large table containing a box of papers. An older man is pawing through the box. "Receipts ... receipts ... where are the damn receipts?"

Davan knocks on the door, and the man looks up. "These people, sir, were wondering what our full name was?" The man mutters under his breath, still pawing through the box. "Receipts ... ah! Found it!" He flourishes a piece of paper. "Twenty swords, ordered, bought, paid for, and yet to be delivered, by damn!" He looks up. "We're ... we're the Brotherhood of the Warriors, or now, the Brotherhood of the Two Spears. Under Glia-Gulmeshki, two centuries ago, we cleaved to a new standard. And then we died." He points at a thin book on a sagging shelf. "It's all in there!"

Ash inclines his head toward the book. "D'you mind if we look it over?"

The man waves his hand. "Go ahead. Go ahead. Don't let them keep it, davan. It's our only copy." he rushes out of the room, mumbling under his breath about a long conversation with a merchant who owes him some swords ...

The booklet is a simple quarto; 16 pages thick and bound in plain thread, with a handwritten cover. "The History of the Spears, by a simple clerk". An auspicious title page. Ash flips the page, carefully reading it. "The Brotherhood of the Warrior practised the way of the martial arts. We are not monks; we do not study simple forms and memorize them We are the worriors; we flow like the avalanche down the mountainslope, flattening all those who get in our way. But we are also the giant tree, cradling those who cannot escape." Several more paragraphs of overblown sentiments follow. Impatiently, Ash flips the page.

Andreth snorts quietly. "Simple forms..." he mutters, although without much heat. To each their own...

"The Brotherhood fought and died to defeat Timron. We fell, and are reborn from the ashes like the Phoenix of Old, under the tutelage of Rendaralion. We live to protect the empire. We have died to protect the empire. Under the leadership of Glia-Gulmeshki we have taken up the way of the Two spears. With one spear, we hunt men. With the other, we hunt." Again, more blathering about the aims of the Brotherhood. This simple clerk apparently believed in using a lot of words to bring very short points across.

Ash scratches his head for a moment, curious what else is hunted, but keeps looking.

Ash scratches his head again, and finally returns the book to its hallowed niche on the shelf. "Seems like.. a lot of poetry," he frowns to Davan. "Sounds like you could sum it up with: We protect people. We teach people to fight. We obey the Emperor and defend his Empire. I could fit that in uh.. about half a page, I figure."

Andreth nods, grinning. "And even I could read it."

Davan nods. "Nobody knows who this clerk was, but he did like to write a lot. There's notes, further in, from when we got reestablished. But they're a little cryptic."

Ash nods, and retrieves the book, and starts thumbing through it for the aforementioned notes.

Flipping a few more pages, Ash comes to a new section written in a different hand. "Have convinced Fallon to restablish the Brotherhood. Have convinced Cel and Reshkino to fund Chapter Houses. We will rise again: the people need protectors now more than they ever did before. And these protectors will be loyal to their kind, only, protected from petty local rivalries. We will seed our Chapterhouses well, and rotate our crops carefully."

Ash reads that last part again, then shakes his head in confused thought.

The writing continues for only one more paragraph. "We will learn the way of the sword and the bow and the spear, and we will eschew the shield, for it evokes weakness. We will be the shield; we will not use it. And the Brotherhood shall ride again!"

The last few pages are blank. Davan smiles apologetically. "We haven't gotten word yet that we're to add more. So it's a very ... slim history. most of the old papers were burned, after the Brotherhood died out."

"It mentioned..rotation," Ash says at last, after closing the slender volume. "So.. if I understand this aright, members of the order are expected to move from place to place, but the people they teach stay put?"

Davan shakes his head. "No; we all move from place to place. If I stay all my life in Calais, will my loyalty be given to my oath taker, Fallon, or to the local prince? If I stay all my life in citadel, who will keep my oath? And who will take it?"

Ash hrms. "I would think.. the Emperor would. This is all for him, ultimately, right?"

Davan bites his lip. "The Emperor takes Fallon's oath. We ... I ... gave my oath to Fallon. So I suppose the emperor is the keeper of the keeper of my oath."

Ash ponders, and finally asks innocently, "Why not just swear an oath to the Emperor directly, and let him apportion the Brotherhood's membership to the seven kingdoms?"

Davan shrugs. "When Rendaralion defeated me, and I was admitted to the Brotherhood, Fallon was there, and the Emperor was not. Fallon is my liegelord; I am sworn to him. We hope that someday the Emperor will attend the Dying Days, and take the vows of the younglings."

Ash blinks at this news. Then continues the questionining. "The Dying Days?"

Davan nods. "The final test; We meet Rendaralion, one at a time, and duel. And if we are worthy, we survive the deathblow he deals." His hand moves to cover the scar on his leather armour. "If we are not worthy ... we die."

Ash nods slowly. "How often does it happen?"

Davan bites his lips. "When I fought, I was one of ... three. And Robin still serves, now in Calais."

Ash nods. He has a final question, having heard sufficient information to draw conclusions. "Who would I talk to if I wanted to locate a past or present member of the Order? If you guys move around so much, I imagine there's some way to keep track..?"

Davan hmmmms. "best to send to the main Chapter House in Fallan then. That's where they keep most of the records." he gestures at the room. "We're ... not the best of record keepers."

Ash nods along. "I guess that's probably where I'd want to check next," he says at last. "We're going to be travelling pretty soon, and I'd be interested in locating your chapter houses along the way."

Davan nods. "Well, we've only two chapter houses now, besides the main one and this one. They're in the Reshkin and Calaisian capitals."

Ash laughs. "Then I might see them. I honestly have no idea where this business is going to take us." He offers his hand. "Good to see you again.. I hope you and your fellows do well here, and I promise you'll hear more from us."

davan smiles, shaking Ash's hand. "We shall surely meet again, Ash of Lainsbrough. I can ... sense it."

Andreth offers his hand as well, out of politeness. "Pleased to meetcha, sir."

Davan shakes Andreth's hand, too, and then Yuri's proffered hand. After reshelving the book, he politely escorts everyone to the front door.
