# Birthright 2003-01-26

Returning to the tavern for the nooning meal, Ash, Andreth and Yuri encounter Starguard. He's been trapped in his room all morning, brewing the potions he suspects they will need. And Stormy has returned too, with Tilara, after the feathers have been delivered. Which was a trivially easy kind of job. Too easy ... everything went too well. Stormy urged Tilara to return to their home base as quickly as possible; someone was ... was watching them.

Tilara says, "I didn't see anything, and neither did Mirra... but I'm not going to say he's wrong, either."

Yuri looks thoughtful for a few moments. "I wonder if they're the feathers'... owner."

Yuri says, "Stormy, what did you see that told you there was someone following you? Maybe I can find him."

Stormy shrugs. "Every time we stopped to juggle, there was a man in a red cloak. I ... I think it was the same man. I'm not sure."

Tilara says, "Either that or he liked the performance. Strange that I missed it, though."

Stormy bites his lip. "He was always in the back ranks. I'm not sure, even, if he was watching us ..."

Starguard says, "You're probably right, Stormy. We should ask the guard if they know. Or the Emperor."

Yuri says, "Well, it could be the man behind everything, or it could just be someone who liked your act. Most likely he's somewhere in between. If you see him, point him out to me and we'll find out. Perhaps he's the source of Red Lint."

Tilara says, "If he wasn't watching us, though... someone else was, and he was following him?"

"He never clapped, you see. Or paid a penny into our hats ..." Stormy sighs. "I dunno." He looks down at his lunch, already half inhaled, and then looks up. "Tilara; the magic is getting stronger inside me ... Do you think someone here could teach me more? It seems so odd; coming from inside. Can't I ... Can't I control it better than that?"

Ash sits quietly, following the proceedings and brooding over his own thoughts.

Tilara nods. "It does, doesn't it? I think you're advancing faster than I am, Stormy... I keep distracting myself learning how to sneak around. We'll see if we can turn someone up to coach both of us."

Stormy nods. "Or at least find some books?" He brightens up, visibly, at the thought. "Ferg lent me one book, but it was so vague ..."

Yuri says, "Do you learn from books, Stormy? I mean, magic is different for everyone. If magic books will help you, there surely must be some in this city."

Tilara says, "Books are good for the book-magicians. But what they do is different from what we can do. We'll see if we can find something, though."

Stormy shrugs. "I don't know. Ferg's book ... had good examples, but the exercises were hard. They never made sense ..."

Tilara nods. "He gave you a book designed for the other kind of mage. He wasn't one himself, was he?"

Stormy shakes his head. "That's why he adopted me. He ... needed my powers, he said. Preferably once I had them under control." Stormy sighs. "I wish I could master the other magic; it seemed so much more logical. Less emotional."

Yuri says, "Now there's a frightening thought. He didn't use any magic on us. Except for the toxic variety."

"Ferg could have been anything," adds Ash from his seat. "Kept a lot of secrets, he did."

Yuri says, "I don't know how many he would have tried to hold back when we were trying, very hard, to do him in."

Yuri says, "Which makes me wonder... if we're escorting this chap, what was his name, up into the mountains... I wonder if we'll have a chance to track down Ferg and extract some answers from him."

Yuri narrows his eyes. _And hopefully he'll put up a fight... it would be nice to have an excuse._

Andreth says, "'e didn't give us much answers when we 'ad 'im last time."

Tilara says, "Keorn, wasn't it? We'll have chances, I suspect, if he's involved. We should've killed him when we had the chance."

Stormy watches and listens quietly ... he looks a little paler now that the subject's back to Ferg, but he's still fondling his brand new tunic ...

Starguard nods. "He's done hangable offences. And escaped from the army. Wanted dead or alive, I'm sure."

Yuri says, "Wait... what about 'escaped from the army'?"

Tilara says, "Has he escaped? Or are we just assuming he will?"

Andreth says, "Well, if we find 'im all by 'imself, 'e'd have escaped, right?"

Tilara says, "Heh. If we find him away from an army unit, he'll have escaped. I think desertion is a hanging offense, so it'll be easy to justify."

Starguard says, "It is. The army work is practically a death sentence in itself, to be honest."

Stormy moves closer to Tilara. "Can we go looking this afternoon? I could spend tomorrow reading, with Starguard ..."

Yuri says, "I just don't want to assume that it's going to be harder than it has to be. I'd like to savor the illusion that something will go the way we want it to, without paying for it in unjuries."

Yuri says, "You know... there's that rumor about the night market. I bet if there's anywhere they'd have those kind of books, it would be there."

Tilara nods to Stormy. "Certainly. I'm ready for a break from juggling."

Stormy bolts down the rest of his food ... then pauses. "But I don't have any money!"

Yuri says, "Well, it wouldn't be until tomorrow morning, and I think that we'd all pay for those. Who knows, maybe others among us will find a use for them?"

Tilara says, "You're a member of the White Company, Stormy. This is Company business. We'll see what we can find."

Dragging back his end of the bench, Stormy surges to his feet. "When can we leave? Now?"

Andreth hrms. "The night market... they got more than just goods, I bet. Bet they know a thing or two about what _else_ goes on in the night, where no one c'n see."

Tilara nods. "But we're not locals. They won't trust us right away. I suppose I can play the part of a lady of ... negotiable affections again."

Andreth frowns. "Don't think you c'd get away with _that_ fer long without 'avin to prove it."

Tilara grins and drapes herself over Ash's shoulder. "An' why should I be worryin' wit' a big strong lad laik this'un to play me trick fer the evenin', boyo?"

Starguard hmms. "Still, remeber what haapened the last time we tried this."

Ash frowns and glances up. He says nothing, but his face darkens further into thought. Whatever troubles him has got a pretty good grip.

Tilara settles back in her chair, ignoring Mirra's disdainful look. "Last time we were infiltrating an organization where we played the part of subordinates. This time we just need to look like we fit in. A city this big won't have the clannishness of a smaller town's disreputable elements."

Andreth rubs his chin. "Y'think? Seems ta me there'd just be more 'n _one_ gang."

Yuri says, "If we go now, they won't be open for another half a day yet, Stormy."

Tilara nods. "Aye, but they have to interact. It's worth a shot, at least." She glances back at Ash. "What's on your mind?"

Yuri says, "I think maybe this afternoon we should look into other things. I'd like to see what horses will cost us. Anyone who can't ride?"

Ash scratches his chin, coming out of his thoughts for a moment. "The Brotherhood. And Ferg," he says finally, lapsing back into stony silence.

Starguard says, "The last time I was on a horse was basic training, Yuri. And that was a good bit before you were born."

Tilara shrugs. "I'm not really _good_ at it, but I don't fall off."

Andreth blinks at Ash. "Why them two things? Th' Brotherhood seemed decent enough fellas to me." He grins. "Though they dunno much 'bout monks."

Andreth turns to Yuri. "Dunno - never tried. Guess I could learn, though."

"Their organizations looked.. similar," remarks Ash slowly. "Just wondering."

Yuri says, "Wait... Ash... Ferg was trained by someone, you're right. Do you think it might be them?"

Tilara says, "From what he reported, Andreth... they assume that they're sworn to the Emperor's service - but no one you talked to actually knows that their superior is truly sworn to him."

Ash shrugs at last. "Dunno yet."

Andreth scratches his head. "Well, yeah, I guess..." He shrugs. "Either way, the emp'rer oughta know there's a buncha guys trainin' in arms in 'is name."

Tilara says, "You probably don't want to go poking around more right now - unless this Rendarilon, or whatever his name is, comes into town you won't learn anything more. "

Yuri says, "Whoever is behind the feathers, is behind Ferg."

---

That afternoon, the party wanders to the local animal auctions. It's a slow day, but there are horses, ponies, and the like available, including a single trained warhorse and two trained war ponies. And a much larger selection of riding horses. One of the lords has recently renovated his stables, and has decided his new herd should match the paneling.

A young ostler steps forward, politely greeting the party.

Andreth blinks, as he hears the rumor of the nobleman who sees horses as an internal decoration project. The idea is so baffling to him that it doesn't even _occur_ to him to be outraged over the profligacy.

Yuri says, "Hello, lad. We seek riding horses and saddles."

The young man nods, bowing a little. "Certainly, certainly. Does milord have a preferred colour or gait in mind?"

Stormy stays at the back of the group, his eyes constantly sliding sideways, to where a store seems to be selling books ...

Yuri shakes his head. "Appearances are less important to us than endurance."

Tilara grins at her erstwhile apprentice. "We'll check it out after we deal with the horses, dear heart."

Yuri murmurs to Tilara, "If you want to go there now, I can't imagine this taking very long."

Tilara stifles a grin and murmurs back. "An exercise in patience. It'll be good for him."

The young man smiles. "Ah. A connoisseur. Planning a long journey, m'lord? We have an excellent set of matched greys. High steppers, every one of them. And quite speedy ..."

Yuri examines a group of several horses of similar breed, reasoning that, even if someone rides on the cart, they may have their own need for speed occaisionally. While no expert in horses, Yuri does know what people look for when trading - good teeth and hooves, muscle tone, the condition of the coat, and so on.

Andreth looks around, and blinks as something occurs to him. He counts heads, slowly, then leans over and taps Tilara on the shoulder. "Looks like Stormy failed the exercise..." he says, nodding toward the bookstore.

Tilara looks startled, and then chuckles. "I'll go look for him." She mrrowls to her familiar, calling the cat over while she goes to see where the boy's gotten to.

Andreth has little interest in horse-trading himself, so he decides to follow Tilara. At a discreet distance, with an eye open for red cloaks.

As Tilara enters the bookstore, a little bell peals and an old wizened man looks up from behind the counter. Behind her, Andreth watches the door carefully. He sees people in a variety of cloaks, but none that are obviously conspicuous ...

Tilara nods to the man. "Did you see a red-haired youth recently, sir?"

Yuri selects six good steeds matched for the size and temperment of each of the members of the White Company, and agrees on a price of 550, including saddles, saddlebags, bits, and bridles. They aren't any kind of show pony, but they should survive a lot of hard travelling.

As Tilara looks around the store all she sees are bookshelves, haphazardly covered with books. Some of which have obviously not been disturbed in years, to judge by the level of dust. But ... no sign of Stormy. And the old man is no help either, as he shakes his head.

Tilara frowns, and looks worried. "Oh, my. I hope nothing's happened to him. Thank you...." She hurries back outside and gets Yuri's attention. "He wanted to go in there, but he wasn't inside... now what's happened to him?"

Yuri looks around for any other places that might have likely caught the lad's attention... or dark alleys where he might have gotten lost.

The area has a variety of alleys, most of them non-empty, it being early afternoon ...

Yuri grunts out, "Red cloak!" and runs after the place where he saw it disappear.

Ash follows Yuri, looking stern, without much of a backward glance at the horses. He's growing soft, trusting that things will be waiting for the party again when they return to collect..

As the party sets out in hot pursuit the cloak turns a corner and goes through a door ...

Tilara is right behind him. "Aye. He wouldn't have, would he? Andreth, stay with the horses!"

Andreth pauses in mid-step, then sighs, watching the pursuit from a distance.

As Yuri reaches the door, he notices it seems to be locked, but not barred from the inside. All he needs to do, then, is pick the lock. He looks down the alley. There's no windows he can use, either ...

As Ash and Tilara arrive in hot pursuit, Yuri looks at the door more carefully. No markings. No obvious clue what lies inside this two story building. But ... when they look more carefully at the door, it becomes immediately obvious that the door is very well maintained.

Yuri raps on the door, then sets about with his picks anyway.

The picks slip and twist in the lock, but do not manage to gain any purchase.

Tilara heads back to the mouth of the alley to keep watch. _This isn't at all like Stormy. What happened to him?_

Yuri raps again. "Hello in there! We're looking for someone!"

As Tilara steps out into the roadway, she sees two windows, bracketing a larger door. An open door.

The picks catch in the lock, pushing around the tumblers. A moment more, and Yuri grins. The lock's open, and the door swings open an inch before he catches it.

Andreth shifts from one foot to the other, holding a horse's reins and looking increasingly ill at ease. He watches in the direction his companions departed, looking for... anything. Red cloaks, Stormy, whatever.

Yuri says, "No windows... strong door... I'm not really liking the looks of this."

Ash waits behind Yuri, eyeing the door and the surroundings with an unpleasant expression.

Yuri pushes the door open and slips inside quietly, pulling on his gloves.

As Yuri slips inside, he finds himself in what looks to be a warehouse. There are crates stacked to his right, and there's a door immediately to his left. In the gloom from an overhead window he can see a door in the wall, but it's closed. He pauses a moment, straining his ears, but hears nothing ...

Tilara looks in the window, and sees bolts of cloth of a variety of colours. It looks like nothing more dangerous than a cloth mercer's store. Odd though, this didn't seem the area for a cloth mercer ...

Yuri looks around for red cloaks, and tries the door.

Tilara shrugs, and enters by the front door, half-expecting another bell to announce her presence.

As Yuri checks this door, he notices that it, too, is locked. But along the far wall, a single crate looks ... disturbed. Not broken, but instead it's sitting just that smidgeon out of alignment, as though someone ran into it, and didn't shove it back.

Yuri checks the crate to see if anything tore loose on it, and then checks the rear door.

Ash waits patiently, observing.

Inside, another bell rings. Thing one has the timbre of a deep gong, and brings three young men to Tilara's side. Two of them carry tailor's tapes over their shoulders and they all eye her curiously. "Yes miss? May we help you, miss?" They sound much like a greek chorus ...

Yuri examines the crate. Other than it's being out of place, it looks completely innocuous. No trace of lint, no marks of who passed this way. He sighs, and moves on, to check the far door, which is again locked.

Yuri motions to Ash, and murmurs, "Have a look around. He might be hiding."

Ash nods, stepping through the opened doorway. He takes care to close it behind him, securing the lock once again - just in case - and begins a methodical circuit of the room. His eyes stray to both doors now and again.

Tilara says, "Well, perhaps. I was curious. This seems an unusual shop for this part of the city. I don't recall hearing of you."

The men nod in turn, bobbing in a little circular motion before one of them steps forward. "We're the tailors. We tailor. May we help you, miss?"

As Ash walks around the room, he notices that the crates have been arranged atypically; some are far harder to reach than others. And one lane is almost completely occluded by some crates that overhang. The bottom crates are arranged normally, but the upper levels slowly lean in towards the centre of the pathway ...

Ash stays wary, ready to move quickly in case they should topple (or be pushed). He moves to test some of the crates, checking to see if he can get a better look at the concealed area.

Tilara says, "You said that. I do find myself in need of a nice cloak, something suitable for a proper evening party. Do you have anything in a nice green silk?"

The men recoil in horror. "Green! Miss, miss, you can't want to wear green!" The one without the tapes shakes his head the most. "No, no, miss, green is a bad colour. An evil colour. We don't use green, miss."

The crates seem to be simply and solidly constructed. As Ash slowly tests, he finds there is one crate he can move aside easily, leading to an open area of sorts, on top of some crates. And there, he finds a small velvet pouch, still fluttering slightly, and a brazier.

Again Yuri wields his lock picks. But this is a simpler lock, it would seem. or perhaps it's just easier. The picks catch, the tumblers fall, and the door is unlocked.

Ash whistles loudly for Yuri, and cracks his knuckles a few times in frustration.

Tilara pouts. "But I can't wear red. It clashes with my hair, nearly always."

Yuri leaves the door unlocked but closed for now, and goes to see what Ash has found. When he sees the brazier, the blood drains from his face... and then floods right back, flushing his face in a quiet rage.

"Yes miss, of course miss, no need to wear red miss, but only the evil ones wear green miss, we don't have green miss, would you like a cloak miss?" The men keep bobbing obsequiously.

Tilara says, "Well, now I'm not sure. I've never heard of green being a bad color before. What makes you say that?"

The men look at each other nervously. "You know, miss, that's why you came here, miss, you know what colours are good, miss. You mustn't test us, miss. It's not nice, miss." Odd, how the voices echo ...

Yuri says, "If that guy snatched Stormy, the way we're going to find him, is to light a feather here and see where we end up. If that guy didn't snatch Stormy, then Stormy is still outside somewhere, might have just wandered off looking for books or sausages or something."

Yuri says, "In either case, I want to have a word with the people that own this building. And then look around outside for Firestorm. And then, if we don't find him, light a feather and do some damage."

Yuri takes up the small velvet pouch and examines it.

The velvet pouch flutters in Yuri's hand.

Tilara says, "Well... blue is nice, also. Do you have anything to show me? What kinds of cloaks can you make?"

Yuri's brows furrow. "Why is it fluttering like that... does the ebb and flow of magic through this place deceive me? What secrets does it hide?"

The men recoil. "Testing! She's testing us! Not nice, miss! Testing isn't nice!" Then one of them steps forward. "Miss, we have the long cloak, and the short cloak, and the hood ... And we can, if you insist, embroider a small blue device. But please, miss, no testing ..."

As Yuri stares at the bag he sees ... he sees the faintest of glows. Perhaps. He's not sure. But the light fluttering in his hand stills ... And now the pouch feels as though it contains only air ...

Yuri says, "Ash... is this pouch... glowing?"

Ash peers. "Sure 'nuff," he replies laconically.

As Ash climb on to the top level of crates, he looks over the edge of the crate. In the centre he sees a second pouch, a twin to the one Yuri is holding. But this one is ... not moving. Merely glowing.

After quickly climbing down, Ash looks at the pouch. It feels heavy, and cool to the touch, but it's not the pouch itself that's glowing. He opens it, cautiously, and looks inside ... where two objects glow bright as day.

Tilara nods, changing tactics. "Very good. The short cloak, then. In red, but a shade that matches my hair, understand? Not just any shade."

As the spell begins to wear off, the statues become more clear. One looks like an obsidian butterfly, with paper thin wings, while the other looks like an iron statue of a flying bird with a long wingspan.

Yuri murmurs, "If the man in the red cloak snatched Stormy, and took him through a portal, it would still be burning... if these are... flying magic, I guess... then the bag might have picked up some of the aura. Either way, I think the man we were chasing is gone. But let's take these, and check out that door. Maybe if we can find out what this building is, we can find out why they wanted Stormy."

Ash shrugs, surrendering the items to Yuri and waiting for him to lead on. He stays silent, frown deepening still further.

The men nod. "Yes, miss, of course, miss, we have just the shade miss." Two of the men disappear under the counter pulling out bolts of cloth. The third looks at each of the bolts, and then at Tilara. "No, no, ruby is all wrong. Can't use garnet. Not salmon, maybe vermilion, or rose ... No, rose won't work. Crimson is royal but no one will mind when it works so well, miss, no one will notice miss, would you like this nice crimson miss? Or this simple cerise? Very elegant, miss, just your colour miss, and we can do a little device in maroon, miss, which is almost blue miss, will that suit you miss?"

Yuri carefully opens the second door he'd opened, slowly pulling it towards himself. Beyond, the room is pitch dark, with only the light from behind him to provide illumination. There's a strong, unpleasant smell, but after a moment he places it ... Dye. Someone's been dyeing here.

Tilara says, "The crimson would be very nice... and I don't really need a device. Let's use the crimson."

Yuri murmurs to Ash, "At least they're consistent. This is a dyeing workshop. Got a light?"

The men bob and dance. "Yes miss, have a seat, miss, won't take a moment, miss." One pulls out shears, and quickly and efficiently cuts the panel. It's obvious he's done this many times before. The pieces are collected and laid edge to edge on the counter top. The men bob their heads, each of them following a seam with their fingers, all of them muttering quietly. Slowly, the seams fuse ....

Ash digs out flint and steel, and quickly kindles a little light. In this room there are three large vats, each standing over a brick hearth, where the fires can be stoked hot enough for the dye to catch and hold. The walls are lined with firewood, in separate piles, sorted by wood type. Soft woods to catch quickly, and hardwoods to burn long and hot. And on shelves, above, large pots holding dried flowers and herbs ...

Tilara watches, curiously, and casts a quick detect magic when she notices they've completely forgotten her. And there is magic at work here; a weak field of transmutation as the seams continue fusing. Last is the hood which is trickier, since they're adding an attractive border to the drawstring closure.

Yuri says, "They're vats are all red... the stranger was wearing red... and Stormy was wearing that red jacket of his... I don't suppose that roll of red brocade was originally destined for these guys, was it?"

Tilara watches in fascination. _Have to see what Ash and Yuri found while I was distracting these creepy fellows. I've never heard of magical tailoring before..._

Soon the men are finished, and they hold up the finished cloak for Tilara to inspect. "We added a border, miss. To make it pretty, miss. It will make you look dainty, miss. Here you go miss."

Ash shrugs a bit. "If they're hiding still, we can't find them. Let's go."

Tilara says, "That's very nice, thank you." She puts it on, to check it for size, but doesn't put the hood up right away.

Yuri says, "Wait a moment... something about this woodpile..."

The men clap happily. "You look good, miss. You look fine, miss. You look nice, miss."

This one pile of wood isn't sorted like the others. Yuri notices that much, but doesn't see why. Ash, moving closer, does. The ends of the wood all seem to have been affixed to what looks like a door, or a flat surface. Picking up a log from this pile would probably be impossible.

Yuri says, "Think we should open it?"

Ash lets out a soft sigh of impatient annoyance, tapping Yuri on the shoulder and pointing down. "I'll stand guard, you round up the group," he replies.

Yuri nods... "Yes... you're right..."

Yuri says, "You want to wait here, or outside? This building might have other occupants."

Ash waves a hand. "I'll be fine," he says curtly.

Yuri nods. "OK. I'll be back as soon as I can."

Yuri quietly walks out the back door, and closes it without locking it. First he goes to find Andreth, and asks the stables to hold onto the horses until he returns for them, dropping a few silvers on the counter. He fills Andreth in on the brazier and the bird figurines, and looks around for Tilara.

Andreth glowers as Yuri relays the news, but nods. "I think I saw Tilara go inta that shop next to the alley you guys went down," he says, then heads for the alley.

Tilara twirls around, admiring the new cloak. "Very nice indeed. What do I owe you?"

"Ooooh, miss, no testing miss, testing isn't nice miss!" Then one of the men stops, looking aghast. "No, wait, miss, we forgot, miss, we have a pouch for the cloak, miss, just a little pouch, miss, here you go, miss. Isn't the red ribbon pretty, miss?"

Tilara says, "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that to you again. You are doing very well here. Keep up the good work." She takes the pouch they offer and tucks it in her belt. For now.

The three men nod and bob and bow annd then one darts out to hold the door open.

Tilara emerges from the shop, escorted by the three, just as Andreth is pointing it out to Yuri. She nods to them and twitches her head away from the shop.

Yuri nods back, and they head away from the shop, but still in the direction of Starguard.

Tilara fills them in on her experience as they head for their inn. "Weirdest thing I ever saw. Terrified of green, terrified of their own shadows, it seemed. Yuri, do you know anyone who makes a habit of using mending cantrips to do seams?"

Yuri says, "That kind of thing was generally beyond the people in the Guild. We stuck to needle and thread."

Yuri says, "How much did they charge you for that, anyway? It's superb workmanship."

Tilara says, "And they sounded like three bodies with one brain. Repeating after each other, almost echoing." She gives Yuri a very crooked grin. "That's the weirdest part of all. They didn't. Went into one of their 'no testing, miss, not nice to test' riffs when I asked. They did give me this pouch..." -- she holds it up for inspection -- "..which I am going to ask His Nibs to have his people check out. They insisted I should have it, and I don't know why."

Yuri stops dead in his tracks. "A roomful of tailors... made you a cloak... using _magic_... and they didn't expect to be paid for it..." He pauses for a moment. "That's not weird, that's... criminal!"

Yuri hurries over to the Inn to collect Starguard, and Yuri explains what was found in the cloth warehouse, especially the brazier and the glowing pouches.

Starguard quickly packs up his potion brewing equipment. "I think I better hand these out then and come with you."

Yuri nods. "We need to get moving. Ash is waiting."

Tilara says, "And only the Gods know where Stormy is."

Tilara says, "We need to leave something behind. Just in case... might be helpful if His Nibs knows what happened to us."

Yuri says, "I'm hoping he just wandered off somewhere, and that he'll show up back at the Inn. I don't think that he got snatched through a fire portal, or it would have still been burning."

Yuri says, "That's a good point. Let's take the Orb, and I'll leave a note with the Innkeeper."

Tilara jumps. "And this pouch is ... moving!" She swears in Lurinese. "What _are_ these things?"

Starguard erms. "Have you detected magic on that?"

Tilara is muttering the cantrip even as Starguard asks.

Yuri says, "The second one had these bird statuettes in them."

Tilara looks at the fluttering pouch. But no matter how intently she looks, there's no glow of magic. Although when she holds it in shadow, under her cloak, she can sense the faintest glow.

Yuri says, "I think that perhaps the bird statuettes have some kind of floating-magic and it rubs off on the bag. Or something. I don't know much about magic."

Tilara says, "It doesn't seem to show magic. But it's glowing. What's in them?"

Yuri says, "I... don't know. Let's wait until we're back at the warehouse to open them."

Tilara looks dubious, but nods. "All right. If you get me killed, though, I'm coming back to haunt you."

Andreth snorts. "Bah. We'll _all_ go 'n haunt Ferg."

Tilara chuckles. "I hope we take him with us, Andreth... but it's a good thought."

Yuri grins softly. "I could think of worse people to be haunted by."

Starguard says, "Alright, let's get going. Here. Everyone take a potion. They're pretty powerful, so be careful."

Yuri stops a few likely-looking people and asks them if they've seen a red-haired youth, or a man in a red cloak around; and, alternately, if they know what the tailor shop and warehouse are, or who owns them.

Most of the people Yuri stops look confused. Red cloaks are not entirely rare, after all. It's a very pretty colour. One man stops, looking intently at Yuri. "They make cloaks. It's a private shop. They only sell to people who have been properly referred."

Yuri says, "What, you mean, nobs and the like?"

The man nods. "Yep. They're very keen on referrals, they is." He strokes his beard. "But they do fine work, don't they, miss?"

Tilara says, "Aye, that they do." She smiles at the man.

The man smiles back, then bobs his head, and goes on his way.

Yuri says, "Right. Let's do it, then."

Back at the warehouse, Ash has spent a dull half hour or so, crouched deep in the shadows where noone can see him. Not that anyone's tried, mind you. It's been dead tired. Finally, Yuri returns, bringing the rest of the party with him.

Ash steps out, rising to his full height and standing expectantly. "been quiet," he reports.

Yuri nods.

Yuri says, "I really hope we're on the right trail here. I'm beginning to think that getting our companions lost is the fastest way to madness."

Starguard frowns, worried about Stormy. "I hope he's only lost..."

Yuri says, "Me, too. I'm hoping that when we get back to the inn he'll be waiting there confused and we'll have a jolly good laugh and then I'll drink myself into unconsciousness. But, you know, I think that's hoping for a lot."

Andreth mutters, "No harm in hoping..." as he watches Yuri at work.

After carefully checking the false woodpile for traps, none of which he finds, Yuri lifts up the covered door. It is hinged at the top and opens at an angle; when fully lifted, it rests against the wall and seems stable. And past the door he can now see a long rickety stairway, descending into darkness.

Tilara mutters, "If he's safe at home when we get back, I'll kill him myself..."

Tilara peers down the staircase. "Now why doesn't this surprise me...?"

Yuri says, "Please don't. Apart from my own feelings on the subject, I think Stormy would be traumatized for life."

Tilara snorts. "I'm not serious, Yuri. I just hope we don't meet the doleful trio..." She looks around.

The stairs wind down, into the deepest depths. Or at least several stories' worth, circling around and around themselves. At first the walls, as such, are reinforced with wood, but soon this becomes dressed stone, and then just plain stone, with the mark of the picks still present. Slowly, the party descends, Yuri checking continuously for traps. None of which he finds.

At the bottom, the stairs suddenly stop, showing only a single door, closed by means of a simple wooden bar. There is no window in the door ...

After carefully examining the door, and finding nothing amiss, Yuri undoes the bars, putting them down to the side. The door swings out, towards the staircase, and he opens it slowly and carefully. As the door opens wider, a glow of light begins to spill out ...

Yuri pauses, peeking around the edge of the door. He sees the strangest thing; in the middle of the room - whose walls are shrouded in darkness - Stormy sits tied to a chair. He's obviously sobbing, based on the way his mouth is moving, but there's not a sound. And the light comes from a large glowing ball levitating over his head. A large tiger eye ...

Yuri mutters back to the others, "Jackpot. Stormy's in there. So is this glowing orb-thing floating over his head. It looks like a cat's eye, and he doesn't look happy about it. Ideas?"

Andreth's knuckles whiten. "Does it look breakable?" he says through gritted teeth.

Starguard says, "Go in, and rescue him, without shooting the possible trap unless it shoots first?"

Tilara peeks around the door herself. She shakes her head, and murmurs the cantrip to detect magic.

Yuri says, "Well... if nobody has any other ideas... let's go in and get him. And then get out of here."

As Tilara concentrates on her cantrip, the entire room brightens. The eye glows so brightly that the very walls, some thirty feet away, become visible. Now she can see that the room is a round room, with shelves along every wall, and pentagons of several sizes inscribed on the floor. Including a magical pentagon, glowing only slightly fainter than the eye itself, on the floor. Stormy's chair sits in the middle of the pentagon.

Tilara mutters, "Great. Illusion, enchantment, and necromancy. Strong auras. Traps - there are hidden pentgrams on the floor, if you step into one you might not be able to get back out. This is ... most curious. It would explain the guys upstairs, though. Mind-controlled, maybe. Or some kind of undead..."
