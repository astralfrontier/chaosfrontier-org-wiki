The party clusters around the door at the bottom of the stairs. Beyond, they can see Stormy, tied up to a chair and trapped under the gaze of a glowing eye. Now that Tilara has pointed it out, the pentagram surrounding his chair is more obvious, although still difficult to make out in that dark dark room.

Tilara casts a detect magic cantrip and peers into the room for a moment. She whispers, "There are magic circles on the floor, and I'm not sure what that thing is, but it's full of magic. Doesn't seem to be a silence spell, but it sure looks like that's the effect. I'll lead the way... if I go down, Mirra can show you where the traps are. Any ideas on how to deal with the thing?"

Starguard says, "Do you want me to summon a creature to test for traps instead? Better a magical construct than us."

Ash waits patiently. He has little to offer regarding magic.

Yuri says, "It could be the real Stormy, or it could be an illusion. If it's the real thing, we don't want to do anything that will kill him. That includes disturbing the circle until we know what it is."

Starguard grabs Tilara's arm. "Hold on a moment. Let's let a magical beast do the exploring."

Tilara says, "If it's a normal magic circle, then breaking it should simply release him. It looks normal..." She nods to Starguard. "All right. Go for it."

Yuri says, "First Starguard's critters, then Tilara and Mirra. The summoned animals are... expendable. Gods, I hate that word."

Andreth tenses for action, in case breaking the circle triggers other guardians...

Starguard nods, and peeks through the doorway, ask the Stars to aid him with magical beasts...the light swirls and comes together near Stormy's chair.

Ash sighs a bit, readying his own weapon slowly..

The summoned badger appears in the center of the pentagram. It looks around, confusedly, and then move towards Starguard, as he calls to it from the doorway. Oddly enough, it passes right through the legs of both Stormy and the chair, as though both didn't exist. But as it crosses over the boundary of the pentagram there is a loud sonic boom, and the badger keels over, dead.

Andreth winces at the sound, but another component to the noise makes him spin around to look behind him.

Tilara says, "That ... is decidedly _not_ normal. But it looks like you were right, Yuri... it's an illusion..." She looks around at Andreth's reaction. "What's wrong?"

Yuri yelps at the noise. "Well... so much for sneaky."

Behind him, Andreth sees nothing moving in the darkness. The staircase extends upwards, seemingly undisturbed, except for a single small rock chip bouncing down the stairs ...

Andreth tenses in the darkness. "I think someone's comin'..." he whispers, as noiselessly as he can manage.

Ash lets out a soft sigh and gets a satisfied look on his face as he crouches to permit himself room to work in. Finally, something he can understand and deal with.

Yuri says, "We could move inside the trap room and jam the door."

A second rock comes bouncing down the stairs, chinking in a way that seems almost jolly.

Yuri says, "There's no room to fight here! It's better to get out of the way."

Andreth frowns deeper. "I... think that might be a good idea, Yuri..." he murmurs, backing toward the door.

Ash follows slowly, curiously.

Yuri opens the door and leads the way into the next room, checking for traps and any more magic circles.

Tilara says, "In that case, we should get out while the getting's good. That room is a deathtrap."

A third and fourth rock, both somewhat larger, are racing for the bottom, falling in large bounds. First the one, then the other, takes the lead.

As Yuri steps into the room he sees many more magical circles, of various sizes, scattered around the room. And the glowing eye is still there, as is Stormy's silent image ...

Starguard follows cautiously, not sure which is worse...

Tilara says, "There's a _lot_ of circles in there. Let's just get out of here!" She heads toward the staircase, looking up and then back as she realizes Yuri isn't coming.

Andreth hisses at Tilara, "Just come in f'r a moment. Somethin's wrong up top of the staircase, I don't like it."

Tilara says, "I don't much like that room, either..." She retreats to the doorway, but doesn't go in.

Yuri looks back for a moment. "Sorry, Tilara. I can't back out now and I'm hoping you'll forgive that. We didn't get this far by retreating from places that angels fear to tread."

Tilara grumbles. "That depends on whether or not we survive... I'll probably forgive you if we do."

There are no other exits in the room, though, no matter how carefully Yuri searches. And all the while, the eye follows him ... and yet watches Stormy at the same time. Very disturbing.

Andreth looks back to the shaft, hears only the occasional rock. His second fear - that of a collapse - is reduced somewhat, and he motions Yuri toward the door, pointing at the lantern, then pointing up the shaft.

Yuri comes over to Andreth, careful where he places his feet, and looks where he indicates.

Andreth says, "I wanna see what's goin' on up there," motioning toward the lantern again.

Shining the lantern up the staircase does not provide comfort; it's difficult to see, but just where the staircase turns past the point of visibility, there's impression of a pile of rock. A large pile of rock. The kind of pile that is piled higher than the ceiling, and generally doesn't allow much air to go through.

Yuri says, "Yeah. That was the _other_ possibility. I think I would have preferred the horde of unwashed thugs."

Inside the room, the image of a tormented Stormy slowly begins to fade ...

Andreth sighs. "Dammit. Guess we gotta take our chances with th' circles."

Tilara says, "Not good. We can wait for a few days and see if His Nibs will come looking for us - good thing we left that letter - or we can get wild and crazy and see if one of the circles is a Gate."

Yuri says, "Uh oh. It's fading... the illusion of Stormy is fading... Tilara, what are the odds that any of these are teleportation magic, like the feathers? I don't see any other way out and this hold in the ground is awfully deep just to be a deathtrap."

Now the eye is sweeping around the room, pausing to examine each of your in turn. Below it, there's a small flutter.

Starguard goes out to look at the rocks. "I'm worried about running out of air, myself. There's not a lot of cracks in that rock."

Andreth pulls out his pouch of lead shot. "We got ways of testin' the circles..." he begins, then trails off as he spots the eye. "Well, there's a thing."

Ash starts to whistle tunelessly, as he moves back out for the stairs.

Climbing up to the rockfall - admittedly not far - Starguard soon notices that while there are a lot of smaller rocks, behind them there appears to be a solid slab, that's slid down to fill the passage.

The flutter, Yuri discovers, turns out to be a butterfly, half stunned from the sonic blast perhaps, which is lying in the centre of the circle.

Starguard blinks, coming back down. "Um, folks. There's a solid block behind those little rocks. Air is a problem."

Ash is still at the barrier, scooping up rock after rock, as many as he can conveniently carry.

Tilara nods. "Ayup. And that circle is the only one that might be a teleport."

Yuri says, "I think that's our way out... but how do we use it?"

Tilara says, "Pouch, circle, ... and a burning feather?"

As Ash scoops up more and more of the rocks, the slab behind them becomes increasingly obvious. Still, he's left with at least a dozen fist sized rocks.

Tilara says, "Burn the feather to open the way, let the butterfly lead?"

The eye watches the discussion avidly, almost as if it could hear what you're saying ...

Ash comes back down the stairs. "Hey, you guys with magic," he calls dispassionately. "How long does an image like that last?" He nods towards Stormy's former occupancy.

Yuri fishes in his pockets for a rag and tries tossing it over the eye.

Starguard says, "Depends on the caster. Could be hours..."

Starguard says, "The eye i swhat's got me worried. I think it can hear us."

The eye, only capable of turning in place, it seems, is unable to escape the rag, and is soon covered. But possibly not for long; the rag begins to smoulder.

Tilara says, "Wouldn't surprise me a bit. It's not like we're giving anything away... hmm. That's not going to work for long."

Ash begins chucking rocks at the thing, quickly - doling them out into one hand, throwing with the other.

Yuri says, "It might only be reading our lips. If it could hear us it wouldn't have to watch."

The eye, hit by the first rock, shatters. The smouldering rag bursts into flame, and falls down in the circle, landing on top of the butterfly.

Tilara says, "Well... that's sort of encouraging. Whatever it is, it's fragile."

The butterfly bursts into flame.

Andreth sighs. "Poor thing..."

Ash scratches his head with his now-free hand. "Well, least it's not listening to us now?"

The points of the pentagon begin to glow ...

Tilara says, "Hello... something's happening..."

Starguard says, "Into the next room! Quick!"

Ash moves, mindful of the danger on the floor and equally mindful that the stairs have less magical deathtraps than the room itself.

Yuri says, "As Starguard says! Out!"

Lines of light begin to arc from point to point, forming a three dimensional pentagram, who'se highest point is about six feet off the ground.

Yuri says, "If that's a portal, it will keep burning for only a few minutes. I motion that we assume it is and go through it. Anyone to second?"

Ash chucks a rock through, as his second.

Andreth says promptly, "Second." Burning in a magical trap seems preferable to him than merely smothering to death underground.

The rock flies into the circle ... and then disappears.

Tilara says, "What the hey. Let's go for it, then. Might be better, and we can always call for help with the glass afterwards."

Yuri says, "Any opposed?"

Ash shrugs, and takes a chance. He moves forward, towards the diagram.

Yuri says, "I'll take that as a no." He follows Ash.

Tilara scoops up her familiar and follows Ash. "Banzai!"

Andreth waves urgently at Starguard, crying, "C'mon, old man!" then leaps forward into the diagram with the others.

Starguard blinks, watching people dissapear. "That might lead anywhere!"

Starguard follows, charging forward...

Ash steps through, dropping his rocks along the way and preparing his more effective sword as he goes.

Yuri says, "'Anywhere' is a place with air, old man!"

There is a brief moment of dizziness, as each of you steps through what appears to be a portal. Those arriving first arrive in darkness, but as soon as the lantern comes through, you see that you're in a large square room with foor doors, one in each of the walls. But somehow, that's not what makes the biggest impression on you. Instead, your attention is drawn by these two oversized ... dogs?

They drool, they slaver, they slink around you as you arrive, and then they pounce.

The first of the dogs circles around, focusing in on Ash as the most dangerous of his prey. He jumps, trying to bite Ash in the throat, and as he leaps, a gout of flame comes pouring out of his muzzle.

Tilara lets Mirra go and lowers her half-spear, moving to help Andreth attack the second hellhound.

Ash snarls, ducking low to avoid the worst of the flames. A little burnt, but thenew breastplate holds up. He responds with a downward cut, and his eldritch blade carves a path through air and into meat that'd down a mortal man if it connected fully.

Starguard sees the hout of flame, and quickly turns to Andreth, chanting for the Stars' help as strengthening magic flows red from his hands into the monk, imbuing him with divine power.

Tilara moves in, spreading out a little from Andreth to distract the beast. The ploy is successful - she slides the blade of the half-spear deep into its ribs while it's watching her partner.

Andreth's skin tingles as the magic rushes through him, then screams with rage as the dog's flaming bite rips into his throat. "Not again, dammit!" he roars, and lashes out with foot and fist, the sweeping roundhouse kick crunching into the beast's ribs while the punch whistles a bare inch from its head.

Yuri sees the furious assault of the first dog on Ash, and flashes back briefly to the time Andreth was mauled. _Oh, bloody hell!_ He plunges his shortsword into the flank of the beast in a single focussed lunge, causing a nasty wound, and is hung up for a moment trying to pull the blade free.

Ash sidesteps neatly as the hellhound leaps, and with a guttural snarl and a look of disdain on his face, his sword slams sideways, impaling the beast as it passes. He slips his weapon free after a moment, grinning savagely.

Starguard, seeing the first of the beasts going down, decides to save his spells for later, turning to swing his morning star at the remaining beast. He misses wide, too careful not to hit a friendly body.

Tilara swings the blade at the hellhound a second time, but this time it is paying more attention to her. Her stab misses as the thing leaps aside - right into Andreth's blows.

And taking advantage of the dog's distraction as it swerves away from Tilara's shortspear, Andreth ducks away from the monster's bite and delivers a devastating one-two blow to its head... the second punch making a crunching sound as the creature collapses with a last rattling breath.

Yuri glances over the carnage with some satisfaction. "Right. Who among us, not a dog, is hurt?"

The party now find themselves in a square room with two houndly corpses ... and four doors. There is no sign of the portal now.

Ash breathes heavily, but manages to give a feral grin to the rest of his companions. He doesn't mention his own injury, though it was clear he took some harm from the fire.

Andreth raises a hand to the charred wound at his neck, careful not to touch it. "I am." He glances across the room. "So's Ash, I think," he says, giving his comrade-in-arms a thumbs-up.

Tilara glances at her familiar for a second. "We're fine. Let's get fixed up and find out where we are, shall we?"

Starguard quickly looks at both the injuries, then turnes to Andreth first, healing blue glowing from his hands.

Yuri moves to check the doors. None of them appear to be trapped. Above each of the doors there's a number; 1, 2, 4, and 8.

Starguard turns to Ash, and decides that's good enough for now. He looks at the numbers curiously. "Doubles."

Yuri says, "Yes... I've got a bad feeling about this."

Andreth breathes a sigh of relief as his wounds knit... his neck is still sore, but he feels much better. He looks round the room, and glances at Yuri. "What, only just now?"

Yuri shrugs at Andreth. "I try to be an optimist and not assume we're going to die or anything until the fabled Hounds of Ungfallen are upon us."

Andreth ohs, prodding one of the canine corpses with a foot and grinning. "Gotcha."

As Yuri checks each of the doors, three of them open, showing small square passages. The fourth, the door labeled with an 8, is locked.

Tilara says, "Weird. So... insist on the locked one, or try a passageway first?"

Yuri says, "I'd be inclined to try the 4, but I consider a locked door to be a challenge."

Ash waits around, looking impatient now, and almost fidgeting.

On his first try, Yuri can feel the tumblers moving ... but at the last moment, his picks slip loose.

Andreth watches from a distance, trying to compose himself, and occasionally glancing at his more impatient companion.

Yuri says, "I can probably get it if I take longer. Should I try, or should we try another door?"

Ash eyes Yuri. "You pick, I'll scout around, if some of these other doors lead somewhere..."

Yuri prepares a determined assault on the lock. "Don't go alone. Take someone else."

Ash moves for door number one, assuming that anyone inclined to follow will do so...

Starguard follows, worried about Ash might find, frowning at the split up.

While Yuri continues working on the lock, Ash moves to the first door. It opens easily, and beyond it he sees a narrow passage that soon curves out of sight. As he walks a little further, now twenty paces from the first door, he sees another door.

Tilara says, "Impatient..." She moves to the door to make sure it stays open.

Ash peeks behind him after a moment, then gets a disgusted look on his face. "Don't lose your nerve, old man," he mutters. "We ain't gonna be but a stone's throw away. Keep lookin' back though.. just in case.." And with that he advances.

Starguard says, "I'll watch your back. Someone's got to keep you lot from killing yourselves in the pursuit of glory."

The lock Yuri is working on finally clicks open, and the door opens a bare inch.

Yuri says, "Got it." He pushes the door open a few inches while kneeling and peeks around the corner.

As Ash approaches the door he doesn't spot any obvious traps. The door handle turns easily, suggestion door isn't locked.

Yuri sees a narrow passage that soon curves out of sight.

Ash waves Starguard back, and hurries back down the passage to report.

Starguard leads the way back, emerging to see Yuri with the '8' door open

Yuri says, "It's open. So shall we see where it leads?"

Ash jerks a thumb back. "Curved passage, leads to an open door."

Yuri says, "This one is curved, don't know where it goes."

Ash shrugs and starts walking. "So we'll find out," he says as he goes.

Yuri says, "Wait, Ash. Let me go first. I'm better with traps."

Ash stops midway down the passage and shrugs, gesturing forward with his greatsword. "Your funeral," he remarks quietly, but waits nonetheless.

After about twenty paces, this passage, too, ends with a closed door.

Yuri takes the lead, and leaves it to the others to arrange themselves.

Yuri cautiously opens the door, and sees another squared off room, with doors in each of the other three walls.

As Yuri peers further into the room, he again sees numbers above the doors. Here the other doors are numbers 1, 6, and 36, and the one he came in is marked 0.

Andreth looks over Yuri's shoulder. "Someone's gotta funny sense o' humor."

Yuri says, "I'm guessing the numbers are room numbers. There's a door number one here, and it probably goes the same place as door number one in the first room."

Andreth says, "Wanna split up and take both doors number one 'n see if we come out in th' same room?"

Yuri checks the 1 door for traps and tries to open it.

Starguard says, "OK. So, our initial room was 1, 2, 4, 8, and this room (8 from 2^) is 1, 6, 236, 216?"

Tilara says, "So we have a pair of 1's. You think they go the same place?"

As Yuri crosses the room towards the door marcked with a 1, he feels the floor begin to give way beneath him. Jumping backwards, he watches the entire floor slide out of the way; two large stone trapdoors open and slamming downwards.

Yuri steps very carefully back from the precipice and into the hall. "Well now."

Tilara blinks in the sudden silence. "So what's down there, Yuri?"

Starguard says, "Well, I think we can assume that some rooms are trapped." The dryness in his voice could cause drought.

Looking down, the pit doesn't appear to be horribly deep. Perhaps thirty feet or so. And those glistening spikes are probably not poisoned. Likely they're just sharp ...

Yuri waits a few moments for his heart to stop pounding. "So... how about door number 1 in the other room?"

Andreth shrugs. "Might's well."

Ash shrugs, and ambles back down the corridor, whistling tunelessly.

Ash is back in the main room, finishing an apparent examination of the felled beasts. "Whatever these two were, they weren't starving," he remarks.

Tilara says, "So what do fire-breathing dogs eat, anyway?"

Starguard says, "Adventures, I'd guess."

Starguard says, "Besides which, they're probably demonic. And don't need to eat."

Moving down from the first room, through the door labeled 1, Yuri reaches the door Ash had found. It doesn't appear to be trapped, and opens easily. Beyond the room is entirely dark, swallowing up his light.

Andreth rubs his neck idly. "They're keen on it alla same."

Starguard says, "Reach up and try to feel for a number above the door?"

Ash scratches his chin thoughtfully, his mind working in compensation for the rest of him being forced into idleness. "Whoever set this up could probably magic themselves outta the snare-room back there," he announces at last. "but if not, they'd have to have come through here. So there'd have to be a safe way out. But why build all this?"

Yuri says, "Umm... if this is magic darkness... can we dispel it with magic light?"

Starguard nods. "I could do it, Yuri. Just not with the spells I have prepared."

Yuri sighs, looking somewhat deflated. "Oh, to see the sunrise in this place..."

For a moment Yuri lights up. And then the darkness swallows up his light.

Ash resumes his whistling, then ambles back for the 'starting room'. "Yell if you do anything useful," he remarks over his shoulder as he goes.

Yuri reaches up and feels for a number carved in the lintel on the other side.

As Yuri's hand enters the room, he feels a sudden tingle cross his fingers, and then his wrist. Above the door, he thinks he can trace out the number 0.

Yuri says, "This door is marked with a zero. I'm kind of afraid to feel out the other doors." He ties a rope around his waist. "Here, hold onto this. I'm going to check one of the others."

Starguard holds Yuri back. "Let's wait. We've got two more rooms, and I can always dispel this tomorrow if I have to."

Yuri nods. "OK, then." He puts the rope away and goes back to the zero room.

Behind the door marked 2, in the original room, Ash sees yet another small passage that soon curves out of sight. As he moves down the tunnel he gets a strong feeling of deja vu, and finds another identical door at the far end.

Yuri checks the doors for traps, and opens it.

There are no traps on this door, either, nor is it locked. Beyond, there is a square room, with doors on each of the other three walls. Clockwise, from the left, the doors are numbered 1, 16, and 64. In a far corner, Yuri can see a large iron chest.

Yuri says, "Every room has a different trick. Fire-breathing dogs... collapsing floors... total darkness... and now a chest."

Yuri says, "I suspect that opening it hastily would be inviting disaster."

Tilara says, "Suspicious, eh?"

Andreth says, "I ain't feelin' _that_ poor. Check the doors first?"

Starguard says, "Maybe not. Maybe there's a trick to the numbers."

Andreth grumbles, "There's all kinda tricks round here."

Yuri says, "Anybody got a pole or a stick or something?"

Starguard shakes his head. "Sorry. Not me."

Tilara wordlessly hands over her half-spear.

Yuri takes the spear and walks carefully into the room, uses the spear to check the floor for traps, and to prod the chest.

Moving into the room, Yuri carefully approaches the chest. There don't seem to be any traps, and the chest is perfectly inert. Nor does it appear to be trapped.

Starguard says, "The chest! It's alive!"

As Yuri turns away from the chest, feet suddenly appear on the bottom of the chest. It turns to face Yuri, and opens its maw, catching him on the heel.

Yuri yelps, and kicks violently back at... the chest? Looks of surprise, amusement, and anger rapidly cross his face.

Ash moves forward to strike, eyes gleaming - finally, something he can understand and deal with in a straightforward fashion. His sword arcs down cruelly, smashing - cutting - into the.. creature?

Andreth, hearing the sounds of battle, charges past Starguard, and, circling around opposite Ash, sweeps a kick over the thing's "lid", then brings his fist down hard onto it... coming away only with bruised knuckles.

Starguard tries to clear a path to the chest so Tilara has a clear shot. "Til! Use your fire spell!"

Tilara was arming her crossbow, but nods at the shout. "On it." She drops the bow and mutters the incantation, the flames streaming out and across the creature.

The chest turns towards Tilara, with a ... It looks hurt. As though you trampled on its feelings. And also alightly charred.

Yuri drops the shortspear and takes a wild swipe with his shortsword at the surprisingly agile piece of furniture.

Yuri thinks, _Oh, Gods. These people are sadists! What next?_

Starguard turns after the fire washes over the box and slams his morning star down on the violent piece of furniture after Yuri's attack. Unfortunately, he doesn't exaclty get 'good wood' and the attack bounces off.

Facing Tilara, the chest dances for a moment on its little bare feet. Then with an impossible smile of unholy glee - no lips, no mouth, no teeth, so what's grinning here? - the chest chomps Tilara, catching her knee between it's lid and body and doing a fair amount of damage. It no longer looks as though she's hurt its feelings. It looks perfectly satisfied now.

Ash tosses his head toward the others, "Get back! I can take care of this..." But as he returns his attention to the chest, his sword cuts through empty air. He snarls at the distraction, readying a few more swings.

Andreth growls, focusing his _ki_ and sacrificing the precision of his blows for sheer power. Which proves to be a poor balance, as his two fists whistle through the air without touching the chest.

Tilara swears as the thing savages her. She backs off, kicks her boots off, and after murmuring a different set of arcane syllables, skitters up the wall away from it.

Starguard moves up and taps the box with his other hand. "Timmus!" It shudders for a moment, then turns on the cleric.

Yuri cuts another swath at the chest, which bounces off with nary a splinter. "Think it's time to retreat!"

The chest tries to snap Starguard's hand off at the wrist, but is distracted by Yuri poking it, and misses.

As the greatsword rings down again, biting into the iron of the chest, Ash barks, "Back OFF damn you! Back to the last room.."

Tilara hisses as she puts weight on the damaged leg, but runs through the words and gestures of Burning Hands again. And again, flames wash out over the chest. "Burn, damn you!"

Andreth takes a deep breath, gathers his strength, and plants a solid kick right into the chest's side. Hopping on one foot for a moment, he calls out to Yuri, "Good idea!" and hurries back into the corridor from which we came.

The flames wash over the chest, with little effect. Although the feet dance for a moment, trying to maneuver out of the flames' way.

Starguard notices the feet dancing away from the flames, and gets an idea. Swinging low, he brings his morning star in a low, sweeping arc...and swashes through the feet, bloodying and breaking two of them. "The feet! Attack the feet!"

Yuri notices that the thing, whatever it is, seems to have taken a dislike to Starguard, and gets between Starguard and the chest, ready to see if it's going to take it personally.

The chest does indeed take it personally, it's lid opening wide as it chomps on Yuri's knee.

Ash growls and makes a few swings, becoming distracted by the constant swirl of motion and the confusion implicit in dodging.. a lid.

Andreth waits for the animated chest to dodge away from Ash's blow, then braces himself and, with all his strength, plants his foot onto the side, knocking the thing off its many feet and leaving it wobbling on its lid.

On the bottom of the chest, Tilara can see a pentagram, outlined in pale pink.

Tilara says, "There's a pentagram on the bottom. Mess that up and it should deactivate."

Tilara comes back down to the floor now that the animated furniture is on its back, and picks up her crossbow. She limps over toward it, while loading a quarrel. "That was very annoying."

Starguard notices the symbol, and quickly tries to correct his aim to hit it. He manages, dead center, but the adjustment took all the power out of his swing, and just bounces off.

Yuri smashes the pentagram with an off-balance blow, then sinks to his knees and sprawls flat, panting, as the chest 'dies'. "I wish Stormy was here."

Starguard whews, putting his hands on his knees, panting for breath. "Nasty little bastard, wasn't he?"

The chest rocks, lightly on its lid. As the pentagram shatters, the feet, and indeed the whole malevolent atmosphere, disappear.

Ash lets out a sigh as well, and checks over his weapon briefly. Steel on iron would have left a nasty dent in any conventional weapon, but he's briefly curious about a magic one... "Too much sorcery here," he remarks offhandedly. "Let's keep moving."

Andreth nods, looking around at the wounds his comrades suffered. "Tough, too..."

Tilara grimaces, limping over to retrieve her boots, though she just stashes them in her pack for now. "Any more healing available, Brother Starguard?"

Starguard says, "Let's see if there's anything inside, since we've went through all this effort. And yes, Til. One moment."

Yuri checks the mauling he got on his leg. "Anyone got a healing spell? Or a potion or something?"

Starguard carefully opens the chest. Inside, he sees what looks like a large cloth sack, and two candle sticks. Below them ... he thinks that that's a blanket.

Starguard opens the sack, holding it away from his face, just in case.

Yuri lunges for the candlesticks and grabs them. "Check for pentagrams! The chest might not have been the only one."

Starguard jumps back, still holding the sack. "Watch the blanket!"

As Yuri picks up the candlesticks, he feels them twist in his hands, both of them jabbing for his wrists ...

Yuri says, "OW! Dammit!"

Meanwhile, looking in the sack, Starguard sees an old, moth eaten book, and what looks like a velvet pouch.

A couple inches above Yuri's thumb, Ash's fifteen pounds of steel slice quickly and cleanly. Parts of the animated object come off...

Yuri takes a fraction of a second to have anxiety for his fingers, and then smashes the candlestick (or remaining parts) against the floor, base-first.

Starguard grumbles. "Damn stuff." He takes out the book and looks at it.

The book appears to be both old and entirely unused.

Andreth's fists clench as the candlesticks spring into action, then relaxes as they're dealt with promptly. "...a very _sick_ sense of humor..."

Yuri carefully checks the remains of the candlesticks, the chest, the sack, and the blanket for signs of life. Then he piles them up in a corner of the room and says to Tilara, "Keep them covered. If they move... burn them."
