# Birthright 2003-02-09

The party is standing in the room with chest, looking at one another and at the damaged chest which has been piled in a corner, along with its contents. With the exception of the book and the velvet pouch, which Starguard is holding.

Tilara stuffs her boots under her belt for now, preferring to be able to move on the walls while the spell lasts. "Small favors..."

Yuri says, "Tilara, maybe we should have a look at some of the adjoining rooms, while that spell is running."

Starguard hmms. "Now, let's see what all the guarding was about." He opens the book, reading...

The flyleaf is blank. So is the first page, and the second, and the third. Flipping through the book, Starguard soon discovers there is no evidence of ink anywhere.

Tilara nods. "I was thinking that, too. Room 6, perhaps?"

Andreth leans over Starguard's shoulder. "Simple 'n easy to read," he remarks wryly.

Yuri says, "That, or Room 1, to confirm that it goes to the same place."

Tilara says, "So much for the book... unless someone has a detect invisible spell?"

Tilara says, "What's in the pouch?"

Yuri says, "Perhaps some kind of secret ink? An alchemical device?"

"Yeah," says Ash sullenly. He looks toward the doors, fidgeting impatiently, then starts walking back to the \`center room'.

Yuri says, "Starguard, let me see that pouch. I wonder if it's like the other's we've found."

Starguard nods, and hands over the pouch, continuing to flip pages, one after another.

Yuri cautiously opens the pouch. Inside, he finds the desiccated remains of ... well, it could have been a butterfly. Or maybe a moth. Or something. Mostly, now, its dust. In fact, based on the dust, there may have been a whole swarm of them in there at one point.

Yuri says, "Perhaps this was a pouch of keys... keys to the fire-portals."

As Ash returns to the room where the party originally arrived, he wonders for a moment if he took a wrong turn. The corpses are ... missing. But when he looks a little closer, he sees blood on the floor in those places where the White Company bled ...

Ash sighs and jogs back toward the 'east room', and the party.

"Bad news," the big man reports. "The fire-breathing dogs are gone. Entirely. Like they were never there." He sounds sullen, but not terribly surprised.

Yuri says, "Tilara, you have a look at room 6. I'm going to have a look down door number one."

Yuri stops short. "Any signs that someone dragged them off?"

Andreth stares at Ash, his knuckles whitening. "Damn. What _now_?" he grumbles.

Tilara nods. "And the rest of us?" She waits for a moment to see if anyone is going to come with her.

Ash shrugs helplessly. "Do I look like a tracker?" he replies shortly. "No blood. No bodies. Nothing."

Starguard hmms, and uses the front page of the book to write out the numbers, considering. With a quick change, he sketches up a five by five table. "I think I understand how the numbers work so far. Would anyone mind if we went into room 4 off the first room?"

Yuri says, "I wonder if they were illusions."

Andreth steps nearer to Tilara. "I'm thinkin' we don't wanna split up too much."

Yuri says, "Let's follow Tilara to room 6, then check out Starguard's theory."

Tilara nods. "I'm beginning to think we don't want to split up at all..."

Ash leads the way down the corridor. "Come on," he mumbles. "If we're gonna be walking on walls, let's get to it."

Starguard nods. "Let's not split up. We've had enough problems with boxes already."

Yuri follows Ash down the corridor. "What kind of fruitcake would build a place like this, anyway?"

The company quickly returns to the original room, and head down the tunnel labeled '8'. At the far end, the door is still unlocked. Still open, too, the way Yuri left it. Beyond, the trapdoor in the room remains down.

Ash stops short of entering the room, impatient but not yet foolhardy. "Alright," he calls backward, "whoever's doing something clever, get to it."

Yuri looks down into the pit. "Well, Til... I'd suggest going along the walls and seeing where one of the other doors leads."

Yuri says, "Door 1 should lead to the dark room; the other doors should lead somewhere we haven't seen."

Tilara nods. "I'll take a quick look."

Yuri peers down the pit. "There's... something else down there. Not moving... not that I can see."

Tilara starts into the pit room, moving along the wall. After just a moment, she pauses. "That's weird. There's a shadow down there that doesn't seem to be a shadow _of_ anything..."

Tilara moves to door 1, keeping an eye on the shadow in case it decides to do something.

The shadow does not move in the slightest. The door appears perfectly normal. Or rather, it appears just like all the other doors you've found so far.

Starguard notices, and pulls out his crossbow, keeping the shadow covered. Or where the source of the shadow should be, rather.

Tilara shrugs and tries to open door 1.

The door appears to be unlocked; it opens easily under her hands.

Yuri pulls out his climbing gear, hammering a piton into the floor. "I'm going to climb down and have a look the old-fashioned way."

Yuri pulls up a bent piton.

Starguard calls out to Tilara. "Should we try door one in the sixes room? See if it leads the same place?"

Tilara says, "Stop making all that racket. I'll go down this hallway to see if it leads to the dark room. Be right back."

Yuri turns the bent piton over in his hands. "You know... I'm thinking... Jurdah. He built the spires and a lot of other oddball things. Maybe this is one of his earlier experiments in labyrinths."

Tilara hurries down the hallway, and soon reaches another closed door.

Ash waits quietly enough, tapping his sword lightly with two fingers as it rests cradled in his arms.

Mirra sits in the hallway, watching Yuri and washing her paws.

Yuri says, "Ash, Andreth, would you hold the rope while I check out the pit?"

After checking the door for obvious traps, Tilara opens it. Odd, how only the one door was locked ... beyond, she sees a room shrouded in darkness.

Andreth nods. "Sure..." he says.

Yuri hands one end of the rope to Ash, leaves the lantern on the floor, and shinnys down into the pit. At the bottom, he lights a candle and has a look around.

Tilara nods to herself. _That much is correct, then. Let's see...._ She reaches up to see what number is above the door.

From up close, the spikes are far enough that that Yuri can easily move between them. Reaching the shadow, he finds an alcove, dug into the side of the wall. There are markings on the deepest wall.

Above the door, Tilara feels the number '27' carved in the stone. There's a tingle as her hand enters the darkness.

Tilara pulls her hand back from the tingle. _What the hey? Yuri didn't say anything about that. And 27? Strange. That doesn't match._ She heads back up the corridor to rejoin the others.

Tilara says, "Yuri, did..." She looks around, then down. "Yuri?"

Andreth points Tilara down into the pit, where Yuri is checking out a mysterious shadow.

Yuri leans closer, looking carefully. There are two sets of distinct markings, one inside the other. The inner looks like a pentagram inscribed in a pentagon. At each of the five points, there's a simple word. He reads each of them in order, starting at the top point: rouge, cerise, solferino, gules, and indigo. And then, around this, there are four diagrams, arranged in a square.

Tilara nods and scurries down the wall of the pit to peer into the alcove that Yuri's found. "Whoa."

Yuri says, "There's some markings here..."

Each of the four diagrams contain four circles arranged in a square. The four circles occur in each of the four diagrams. In the top left, the first circle contains a pentagon, the second contains a candlestick, the third is completely black, and the fourth contains what looks like a web. In the top right the first circle is black, then the candlestick, the web, and the pentagon. In the bottom left, first the candlestick, then the black, the pentagon, and the web. And on the bottom right, the web, the black, the candlestick, and the pentagon.

When Tilara and Yuri look a little more closely, they see indentations in the centre of each of the four diagrams, and under each of the five words.

Yuri says, "Well, well. A map. But if this place is arranged like this... it doesn't make any sense. Some of the corridors should intersect."

Tilara says, "Assuming we're in some kind of place that _makes_ sense. I wouldn't be at all surprised if some of those hallways go places that they ... shouldn't go. I just went down a hallway to a dark room that should've been much farther away and in a different direction."

Yuri says, "What do you suppose these indentations are? Triggers?"

Yuri examines the wall of the alcove. "No detectable mechanism... it might be magic. Or perhaps we're supposed to find objects in each room that fit into these sockets, like fittings on a gem. In any case, if this is a map, there's one room we haven't seen, and we'll reach it with door number 4 from the entry room."

Tilara says, "No idea, yet. Four symbols... black, web, candle, and pentagon. We've seen the black, we've seen a candlestick... or could that be fire for a hellhound? I wonder if we're supposed to go through the rooms in some order to get back to where we started from and use another flame to go somewhere else? Or maybe the color as something to do with it. I've got that nice cloak the strange tailors made for me."

Yuri says, "I suspect the candlestick means the animated objects, like the chest."

Yuri says, "The color is supicious, and might explain their interest in Stormy. Red-headed lad wearing red with the name 'Firestorm' who casts fire magic. For all we know he's their long-lost son."

Yuri says, "Oh... see that? There's a seam here... like they're buttons... but I don't want to press them now. Let's go see what's down corridor 4 first."

Tilara peers more closely at the indentations. "Aye, they are, aren't they? I suppose we can come back. I'm going up before the spell wears off."

Yuri says, "They might... um... 'clean up' the rooms. If this place is very old, it stands to reason that we're not the first people to find it. This might be a means of resetting the traps and monsters for new victims."

Yuri says, "Yeah, go. I'll be right behind you."

Yuri crawls up the rope.

Yuri describes what he's seen to Ash and Andreth. "I think it's a map. There should be five rooms and we've seen four. Each room attaches to every other room - there must be some magic because the corridors don't cross - and that means that if we take the one hallway off the main room, we should find it. The symbols for the... 'trap'... in each room are a pentagon, a candlestick, a black swatch, and a web. So it's probably the pentagon or web we haven't seen."

Andreth nods. "Right. Guess we should check out da last room, then..."

Ash nods in agreement. "Right, let's get this over with."

Starguard says, "I would the web, as the pentagon might mean the hellhounds. Or the entrance from the pentagon."

Putting word into action, the company retrace their steps, and go down the last corridor. The one labeled '4'. At the far end, they see yet another door.

Ash sighs and stops, pointing downward.

Andreth blinks at Ash. "What, the spider web?"

Ash nods slowly, looking distinctly unhappy.

Yuri says, "Web? Where?"

Andreth points where Ash pointed, near the bottom of the door.

Yuri kneels and pokes at the web with a gloved finger, trying to guage the size of the spider, and the age of the web.

The web appears to be old. It's covered in dust. But the threads are thick. Unusually so.

Yuri says, "Spiders. Probably un-naturally large ones. Well, shall we open the door and see what happens?"

Starguard scratches the back of his head, frowning. He peers at the book, opening it, to check his numbers. "I think we have to."

Andreth hehs. "What happens is they attack us." He pulls out his sling and drops a shot into it.

Tilara says, "I suppose we should. I still have a couple fire spells left in me."

Yuri says, "In that case, do we have anything we can use to soften them up?"

"Me," replies Ash coldly.

Yuri says, "How about that fire-breath potion? You still have that, don't you?"

As Starguard opens the book, it falls open to a later page. A page with writing on it. At first, he thinks it's the page he wrote, but it isn't. He wrote a five by five table of numbers ... this too is a five by five table, but some of the entries consist of more than one number. '9', for instance, got replaced by '3 3'

Starguard says, "Hey! Hold it! There's writing in the book!"

Starguard shows it to the others, comparing his five by five table to the new one.

Andreth looks over Starguard's shoulder. "Huh. That's weird. Maybe you should write them color names in and see what they come out as?"

Yuri says, "Well... maybe it's giving us hints?"

Tilara says, "Or it automatically does that as you go through doors..."

Starguard goes back to his page, and, with Yuri's guidance, writes in the color names, closing it for a moment...

When Starguard reopens the book, it takes a moment to find the page he's hoping to find. On the first page, he had written Rouge, Cerise, Solferino, Gules, and Indigo, in that order. On the page behind it, there is now a list of five words. Names, it looks like. Specifically, Elisabeth, Elsbeth, Betsy, Bess, and Mary.

Yuri says, "Umm... weren't those names on one of the cards?"

Starguard quickly digs in his pack, looking for a particular card...

Tilara says, "Indeed. And if the names match the colors... but who do the names belong to?"

Yuri says, "The names probably aren't important, they're probably placeholders to indicate that there are four points, or something."

Starguard says, "Four squares. Maybe we each press a pair of buttons, then someone presses the remainder."

Andreth scratches his head and sighs.

Yuri says, "'Each took one and left four in...'"

Yuri says, "I propose that we kill the giant spiders before pushing any buttons. There may be more clues in this last room."

Starguard says, "So who's our Mary?"

Andreth nods to Yuri. "We might's well. For all we know, we haveta be _in_ all these rooms..."

Starguard nods. "A little exercise might get our brains working, too."

Tilara nods. "I was thinking that we have to go through them in some order to get to a particular place. Might as well see what's in here."

Ash moves forward, opening the door. While not locked, it resists his movements for a moment, before swinging open. Which is not surprising; the only thing Ash can see, after the door is open, is a thick mass of somewhat sticky webbing, some strands hanging loose where he forced the door through.

Ash blinks, and readies his weapon quickly. "Yeah, webs," he announces laconically in a laid-back voice. "Let's get some fire goin' here."

Starguard hmms. "Tilara? Your department, I believe?"

Yuri says, "No need to waste a spell."

Ash carefully applies a bit of the lantern's flickering flame to part of the webbing, then stands well back as it ignites.

Yuri thinks, _I hope we don't regret this. It's so imprecise._

Ash watches the growing fire with satisfaction. "Least one thing works like it's supposed to, around here," he comments with a smile.

The web burns away quickly, brightly, and with a great deal of heat. Once the last smouldering fragments have fallen to the floor, Ash can see into the room beyond. Which looks just like all the other rooms. One door in each of the three walls. And a slight girl, in the far corner, hands bound behind her back.

Yuri says, "Oh, Hell! I knew it!"

Tilara says, "That ... is not a spider."

Yuri dives into the room and towards the girl, cursing in every language he knows.

Starguard follows right behind, worried, looking for movement or reaction out of the girl...

It's amazing, how quickly the heat dissipated again. The girl watches Yuri, her eyes open wide, but otherwise completely still ...

Andreth is quickly behind his two companions, his eyes scanning the walls for anything _else_ that's suspicious.

Yuri says, "Oh, thank the Gods, she's alive!"

Yuri stops short, and motions his companions to stop as well.

Ash waits patiently, sword ready.

Starguard stops behind Yuri, pushing a little. "What?" He calls to the girl. "Are you alright?"

Andreth comes to a halt behind Yuri, looking wary.

The girl nods at Starguard.

Starguard looks to Yuri. "A trap?"

Yuri murmurs to Starguard, "Her mouth..."

Yuri speaks softly, "We're the White Company. I'm sorry if we scared you. Are you hurt?"

Looking closer, Starguard notices that the girl's teeth look unexpectedly sharp. And pointed. And perhaps just a little hollow? And those scars on the sides of her mouth look ... well, perhaps scars was the wrong word. They look more like small holes. She looks at Yuri, and then shakes her head. "No. I'm not hurt." Her trade is very precise, the words carefully paced and enunciated.

Yuri slowly squats, sitting on his heels, facing the girl. "And what are you doing in this maze? It's no place for sane men."

Tilara says, "Or women..."

The girl nods at Tilara, then bites her lip. "I got lost. Went through glowing door. Got stuck. Then spider bit me. Tied me up."

Andreth nods slowly. Then gives Yuri a brief glance and a raised eyebrow, but does not in any other way say "so what does that make us?"

Starguard says, "What's your name, child?"

Ash turns around from the girl, paying close attention to the rest of the room, with those words.

Yuri shrugs at Andreth and does not in any other way say 'Willing fools'.

Yuri says, "We came here through a glowing door, as well. We're from Aglamar - that's a place in the Empire. Where are you from?"

"My name is Elisandra de Dio de Muertos y Veneno. I come from Massilia." The girl struggles a little with her bonds.

Starguard turns to Yuri. "I'm going to look her over, alright?"

Yuri says, "Well met, then, Elisandra. I'm sure you'll understand if we're cautious."

Yuri nods to Starguard, without taking his eyes off the girl.

Yuri says, "That's a pretty name, Miss Elisandra. Do you have any sisters?"

Elisandra nods. "I have seventeen sisters. And one brother." She smiles at Starguard, as he moves closer. "I was born with scars, and teeth. They were always like this."

Andreth rubs his chin. "So how long you been down here?" he asks. "In gen'ral terms, I mean," he adds, in deference to the fact that one's unlikely to see the sun down here.

Starguard says, "She appears to be human. The teeth and scars are odd, but that's the only weird thing."

Shaking her head, Elisandra looks at Ash. "Hours? Days? A long time. I am very hungry."

Ash looks back for a moment. "Ya ain't eatin me," he announces firmly.

Yuri says, "If you speak the Trade Tongue, you must be from some place known to the Empire, though not known to me. I'd like to be able to trust you. But this is a strange place, and we are seeking a lost comrade, and so far no other part of this maze has given me cause to relax my guard." He motions to Ash. "My fellows are equally uneasy. "

Ash hefts over a dozen pounds of steel in both hands meaningfully.

Elisandra nods, very quietly, her eyes wide and luminous. "I ... understand. Who did you lose?"

Tilara says, "A boy, with red hair. Have you seen anyone come through here recently?"

Starguard idly digs through his rations. "Our apologies for not untying you, but we're just a bit paranoid at the moment." He pulls out some bread and cheese, cutting bits off. "She's not evil, Yuri. I can tell."

Elisandra shakes her head. "My sister also had red hair. I was seeking her."

Yuri looks at Starguard and allows his normally careful expression to slip into one of total noncomprehension.

Starguard says, "Would her name be Mary, Elisandra? Or something similar?"

Yuri holds up his hand.

Yuri says, "I'm going to suggest something. You tell us your story, in your way, at your pace, in your own words, instead of waiting for us to guess a question at a time."

Yuri says, "When you're done, I'll tell you our story. I swear that I will speak the truth, though I do not promise to tell you all our secrets."

Yuri says, "And then we can decide if we're going to trust each other. Okay?"

Elisandra shakes her head. "No. She is Anna de Dios de Fuego y Rojo. She went into her room, and did not come out. I came after her. I came to the room; it had webs. I do not remember more." As she speaks, Yuri looks her over more carefully. She's a slim girl, dressed in a plain light blue tunic, with grey leggings and bare feet. Her hair, bound in a thick plait, is palest white, as is her skin, and her eyes are jetblack. The ropes binding her appear to be made of a thickened silk, or perhaps spiderweb?

Yuri says, "Tell us more of your family, your sister Anna, and Massilia?"

The girl shakes her head. "I can not."

Starguard offers a bit of cheese to the girl. "Why not?"

Elisandra accepts the cheese, biting slowly. "I can not say."

Starguard hmms. "Magic, I'm guessing. And while you may not be evil, releasing you might change things. Signficantly."

Elisandra nods, eyeing the cheese.

Ash comments, "Change is good. There's no way out now, right?"

Yuri shrugs. "Then I'll tell you as much as you've told us. We are The White Company. We are adventurers, and we came here through a portal in an underground chamber in the Citadel, the capital of our land. We were looking for a lad called Firestorm, or Stormy, who has red hair. An illusion of him baited us into a strange, magical gateway, and we arrived in a room in this maze, probably the one through that door -" He looks around for a door marked zero and gestures to it.

Starguard feeds Elisandra cheese and bread while she listens. And some water too, as she wants it.

Yuri says, "If you can't tell us more, and you can't even tell us why you can't tell us more, then I'm afraid it's going to be difficult for us to trust you."

Yuri says, "The people who took our friend have powerful magic and are fixated on red and shades of red."

Elisandra relaxes on the floor. "I understand. I will die. And you will save your friend."

Tilara says, "Not necessarily. We can take you along without untying you right away."

Yuri shakes his head. "Nobody dies on my watch. I didn't say we'd leave you here. I just said we're not inclined to trust you."

Yuri thinks, _At least, nobody dies permanently._

Elisandra smiles, whimsically. "I understand. Will you untie me?"

Yuri looks around at the other members of the white company, to guage reactions to the girl.

Ash looks... displeased.

Andreth glances at the girl, then at Yuri, and shrugs, shaking his head, looking skeptical but not hostile.

Starguard waggles a hand. He's got no problems, but definitely wants to watch her...

Yuri says, "No, we're not going to untie you. If you don't attempt to impede us, you can accompany us as a guest, and I promise that, if we find a way out of here, we'll take you to a safe place. We'll protect you as we would one of our own."

Elisandra nods. "I understand. May I sing grace for my supper?"

Yuri cocks an eyebrow. "A custom of your people?"

Elisandra nods, again. "We sing after we eat, to thank the goddess."

Andreth looks intrigued at that. "Which goddess?"

Tilara says, "Seems like a nice enough custom. But no spells."

Yuri says, "Then do so, by all means. But be warned, Miss Elisandra. I also promise you that if you attempt to do harm to any of us, or anyone we're protecting, you won't regret it for very long. There are some things for which we have very little patience."

"De Arana y de la Tela. Our lady goddess." Elisandra smiles, and begins to chant softly, under her breath. The chant is short, and melodious, and seems to be sung in two part harmony.

Starguard hmms. "I think we can trust her, Yuri. The spells that may be on her, no, but her, yes."

Yuri relaxes when the song doesn't seem to have any ill effects. "Let's defer that decision for a while. I'm going to search the room. Then I'm open to suggestions on what we should do next. We could try the buttons in that alcove, and see if they have any effect on the central room. Or we could check out Starguard's book some more."

Andreth's lips move, as he tries to reproduce the notes under his breath, but stops as he realizes that she's singing more notes at a time than he's capable of. "That's some singin' voice, miss..." he says, finally.

Ash waits patiently, still wary, but makes no further rash motions toward doors. "Got a plan?" he asks to nobody in particular.

Starguard hmms, and has an idea. On his page, he writes a list of five colors, and a list of the four symbols. He places four arrows above the list. "Let's see if the book will play connect the dots for us."

Elisandra smiles at Andreth. "Thank you. I always sang grace for my sisters."

Yuri stands, and looks at Elisandra again. "I'm behaving like a cad, I'm sure, miss. But in situations like this, I have only one motivation - to get everyone home alive. When and if we do so, if you have issue with me, then I will make it up to you later."

After closing the book, Starguard reopens it, carefully leafing throught it. He finds the two versions of the table of numbers, the two lists of names ... and the one page he wrote. But every other page is still blank.

Starguard snaps his fingers. "Darn. Was worth a shot."

Yuri examines the rest of the room for other marks, traps, devices, or clues, and finds nothing else, no clues to the origin of the web. "Well... makes as much sense as everything else in here."

Elisandra smiles at Andreth. "Shall I sing you a song while we wait?"

Andreth shakes his head, not wanting to tempt fate. "Nah, it's okay - not right now. Maybe when we all get outta this alive..."

Yuri says, "Tilara, will you take charge of our guest, please? I think maybe we should go to the pit room now."

Looking downcast, Elisandra nods. "I understand. There is no trust." She relaxes, her arms still bound behind her, and waits fatalistically.

Andreth looks apologetic. But not any more trusting.

Starguard puts a finger under the girl's chin. "That doesn't mean we'll treat you badly. It just means we're not going to untie you."

Tilara nods, and moves to stand next to the girl. "I'm still concerned about the darkness room. Did you notice an odd sensation when you put your hand into the darkness, Yuri?"

Yuri says, "Give us some time to think it over, Miss, there will be."

Smiling at Starguard, Elisandra flexes her hands. "Please; can you retie my hands in front of me? My wrists have gone numb ..."

Yuri says, "I didn't notice anything in particular, Til, but all I did was check the carving in the lintel."

Starguard looks to Yuri. "It's a reasonable request..."

Yuri shrugs. "Sure."

Tilara nods. "Certainly seems so." She steps behind the girl, first testing to see if her hands are cooler than her arms.

Andreth unobtrusively moves into a ready position. If she's having her hands retied, that means for a moment they'll be untied. It's too bad for Elisandra that he, Andreth, has had bad experiences with unexpected strangers in dungeons before, but... well, that's how it is.

Ash follows the rest of the group, humming tunelessly. His earlier fire seems to be gone, and replacing it is a cooler patience.

Tilara nods. _Her hands do seem to a bit cooler. The bonds don't look too tight, but she'll be awfully clumsy with her hands tied like that..._ She unfastens the bonds. "There we are. Turn around, please."

Elisandra turns around, humming, her hands held out in front of her, wrists crossed.

Yuri leads the way back to the entry room, being fairly casual. "Anyway, all this other stuff aside, we've figured out that there are five rooms, and this place is heavy with magic. The architecture of this place is impossible without it - some of the passages have to cross, and they don't."

Starguard says, "Not really. If the tunnels curve up and down, it could deal with things easily."

Tilara reties the silk, not tightly - enough to impede her movements if she tries to attack someone or make spell gestures. She could probably squirm out of them, but that's why the sorceress will be keeping an eye on her.

Yuri says, "They didn't seem to go up or down, Starguard. Oh, that's something else. I'm Yuri; that's Tilara; Ash; Starguard; Andreth. As I've mentioned, our missing man is Stormy."

Yuri says, "We found a map, of sorts, in one room, that seems to indicate that there's five rooms here - one with a pit, one with a web, one with darkness, and one with animated carnivorous furniture. You were in the web room. The map is under the pit. Whoever built this place has a quirky sense of humor. We think it's a chap called Jurdah; ever hear of him? He's an old God, or kin to the Gods, and had this habit of building odd structures all over the world."

Yuri says, "Honestly, when we saw the web, we thought we'd be facing giant spiders or something. It wouldn't have surprised me, after all we've been through. We figured the fastest way through it was to burn it. I was even thinking, in the back of my head, that with our luck, there'd be someone in there, and we'd end up incinerating them by accident, and it would probably be someone's long-lost brother or something. Guess I wasn't so far off. I'm glad you didn't get hurt. I'd probably never forgive myself for it if you had."

Elisandra listens, carefully, her eyes held open wide. She shakes her head at every question.

Yuri keeps his tone conversational as he leads the way back to the pit room. "Anyway, this sort of thing seems to happen to us a lot. We sort of asked for it. I guess you have to be careful what you wish for, hmm?"

Yuri pulls out his rope again. "I'd like to be the one who does the button-pressing, in case it floods the pit with carnivorous fish or something. Anyone want to join me?"

Carefully lowering themselves to the bottom of the pit, Yuri and Andreth make their way back to the alcove. After looking at the markings one more time, Yuri leans forward, and lightly presses the button next to the word 'Indigo'. Nothing happens.

Meanwhile, back in the hallway, Starguard tries to question Elisandra. But after trying to get at the point from several different angles, all he can discover is that Elisandra can't tell him more, and she doesn't know why.

Starguard says, "You see. I suspect a spell's on you, and that's why we can't release you. Not until we find out why you can't tell me."

Andreth climbs up out of the pit again after Yuri. "Nothin' happened here. Let's go see what happened in the other rooms."

Yuri says, "If anything is going to happen, it's going to happen in the main room."

Tilara nods. "Maybe the darkness is gone."

Arriving back at the original room, once home of two ferocious dogs, everything seems exactly as the party had left it.

Yuri is visibly disappointed.

Yuri says, "We didn't even get the fire-breathing dogs back."

Andreth eyes Yuri. "You _wanted_ 'em?" he asks wryly.

Tilara says, "Good. That's not something we wanted."

Yuri says, "Well... I wanted something to happen. I thought maybe another portal would open. I guess we might as well check the other rooms."

Andreth nods. "Well, we'll keep lookin'."

Ash waits patiently, keeping a careful eye on the girl but saying nothing else. He is, however, visibly relaxing.

Yuri murmurs to Ash, "She _is_ pretty, isn't she?"

Ash eyes Yuri in turn. "Let's save our necks first, everything below that can come later later."

Carefully retracing his steps, and using only the corridors the company had traversed before, Yuri leads everyone to the other three rooms in turn. The dark room is still dark, the webbed room still has ashes from the webbing on the floor, and the room with the candlesticks still has the pile of rubbish in the corner. In short, nothing has changed. Elisandra looks around, curiously.

Yuri sighs. "Well, if we're going to camp here tonight, I'd like to search the dark room once, by hand, in case there's something we missed."

Andreth says, "We could try pushin' some other button first."

Starguard says, "My two button idea is sounding promising."

Yuri says, "Which two, then?"

Starguard says, "A color and a room. Which one with one is the question."

Yuri says, "Well... not the pit room. Not while we're in the pit."

Tilara says, "Which one _is_ the pit room? It's not all that obvious."

Yuri says, "The octagon, maybe? I guess it might also be the map room, and this is a five-pointed... umm... place."

Yuri says, "Wait... Starguard... let me see that book again."

Starguard hands over the book, nodding.

Yuri shuffles through the book, looking for a sixth page to match Starguard's fifth.

Yuri comes up blank. Only five pages have writing on them.

Yuri says, "Alright. Let's try pressing some buttons. We'll go back to the pit room; one person goes down the hole; one stands in the corridor and watches the main room. We'll try different combinations and shout if something happens."

Trooping back to the room with the pit, Yuri climbs back down and faces the buttons. The party deliberates, with Starguard finally announcing his conclusions. The party agrees, and with Yuri as proxy, decides to press the button in the top right square, and the one next to the Indigo label. Yuri hears a creaking noise from behind him, and the others see the spikes slowly disappearing into the ground. Then, in the centre, a wide column of stone begins to turn upwards, screwing its way out of the ground on giant treads.

Ash smiles in satisfaction. "Good work," he comments softly.

The column rises about eight feet, then comes to a halt. Facing Yuri, a door made of stone slowly falls open.
