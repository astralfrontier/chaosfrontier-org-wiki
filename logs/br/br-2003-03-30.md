You find yourselves in a small cramped room. As the arch fades out behind them, the room goes dim, but not before showing you Stormy, tied up in a chair and snoring softly. He looks a little worn, but not too badly battered. There's one door in this room, currently closed, and no source of light beyond what you carry with you. Luckily, you have a lantern.

Ash wastes no time, moving toward the door, his sword ready. He seems preparing for an ambush, or at least guard duty, trusting the others to attend to the party's young companion.

Yuri remembers the lethal circles in the first room, and checks the floor (starting with where his feet are) for traps and other unusual items.

Tilara heads toward Stormy, but stops after a moment. "Mirra, does he smell right? This isn't another trap, is it?"

Mirra carefully sidles up to Stormy's side, and sniffs the air delicately, before turning to look at her mistress. _Firey ashes. Friend. Smells tired. Smells sore._

Starguard, frowning, takes a moment to load his crossbow. "Careful, people. This smells like a trap."

Ash just stands waiting, smiling grimly and gripping and re-gripping his heavy blade.

Yuri grins a crazy grin. "Yeah. But for us, or our enemies?"

Andreth shakes his head, smiling, and whispering softly. "For Stormy, yes. But I kinda don't think they's expectin' us."

Tilara nods to her familiar, then moves to wake the young sorceror, putting her hand over his mouth to keep him quiet until he understands what's happening.

Stormy jerks alert, his eyes opening wide as his mouth pulls back into a quickly silenced scream. Seeing his friends, he relaxes marginally, but still tugs at his ropes.

Tilara nods, putting her finger to her lips, and then starts untying the boy. She whispers, "We've had a time finding you. D'you have any idea where we are?"

Stormy shakes his head. He looks around for a moment, then shakes his head again. "I was," he whispers, "in a laboratory. But I didn't talk! I swear, I didn't talk!" His voice rises, both with remembered pain and with anxious pride.

Andreth makes way for Yuri as the man moves toward the door. "Well, one way to find out where we is..." he says, nodding toward Yuri.

Tilara shushes. "Quietly, Stormy. We got here through one of those damned gateways, and we need to find a way back."

Cautiously, Yuri opens the door, after pausing a moment to confirm the lack of both traps, and of locks. Beyond there's a short hallway, and stairs leading up, as well as several other doors leading off the hallway. And there's a blank slate on this door, and slates on every door. One of them reads "Linen", another reads "Meats".

Stormy nods at Tilara, eyes wide, expression unreadable. "Why can't we ... go upstairs?"

Yuri says, "I think we're back in familiar territory, folks. Stormy... do you remember where they took you? I mean, where are we?"

Stormy bites his lip, and shakes his head. "I ... don't know."

Ash turns then, and asks, "What did they question you about?"

"There was a lab, and then ..." He stops, as the blood drains away from his face. "They wanted to know about the Company. The White Company. I swear, I didn't tell them anything!" Stormy shudders, and leans on Tilara's shoulder. "I promise! I didn't betray anyone!"

Ash shrugs, then moves around the door, clapping Yuri on the shoulder. "We're going, now," he says quietly.

Yuri says, "Relax, Stormy. We're getting you out. They're going to know more about us, soon. More than they ever wanted to."

Tilara hugs the boy. "S'all right. We're not worried about it either way. We're just glad to get you back. The White Company looks after its own."

Starguard says, "While not talking is admirable, Stormy, there wasn't much you could tell them that they couldn't figure out with spies. Or forcing us to go through the labirnyth that we did."

"They kept asking me why we were White. And they used a capital W, too. We weren't just white, we were White. And they wanted to know why ... and they were all wearing ..." Stormy rears back, noticing Tilara's new cloak. "This is a trick, isn't it. You're all illusions. I'm not going anywhere." He sits back down in the chair, and grips the seat with both hands.

Ash turns back, hefting his sword onto one shoulder. He faces Stormy squarely, patting his thigh. "Ferg's knife entered my leg here, for an offhanded comment about tarts," he murmurs quietly but forcefully. "I'll kill the man if I see him again. You knew him too, and I've told nobody that. Come now, we're in danger."

Tilara sighs. "This cloak is a ruse, Stormy. We're trying to sneak out, remember? You don't have to tell us anything right now."

Stormy looks wide-eyed at Ash, and then at Ash's leg. "Show me the scar, and I'll go with you."

Ash's hand goes to his belt-knife, and after lifting away the chain of his new armor, he gashes open a segment of his leggings and bares the roughened skin for inspection. "We have little time for this," he grates. "Yuri," he adds without turning, still facing the young sorcerer. "You lead. I'll be right behind you."

Stormy looks carefully, then stands up. He looks at Ash, and then at Tilara, and nods. "I ... believe you. I think. We need to go. There's another interrogation due soon."

Tilara says, "Best we not be here for it, then." She moves forward to stand with Yuri. "Just in case we meet one of them... I might pass long enough."

Andreth nods to Tilara. "And if you don't..." He grins unpleasantly. "...well, maybe this time _we_ can ask the questions."

Leading the way, Yuri quickly moves through the hallway, ignoring the other doors and quietly tiptoeing up the stairs. At the top of the stairs another door is closed, but not locked, and it yields easily to his touch. Beyond, he sees a large room, with a kitchen off to one side, and a pantry to the other. Tables here suggest this is a common room, where servants gather. Yet right now ... all is quiet. All but a single boy, tending the fires.

Starguard nods, agreeing with Andreth. "Kidnapping isn't exactly acceptable."

Yuri and Andreth cautiously move into the common room, carefully flanking the boy who is currently adding wood to the fire in the fireplace here. The lad is studiously building the fire up, completely oblivious to the sound of moving monks or bards, as he carefully counts out pieces of wood into a pyramidal structure, and blows to fan the flames.

Andreth nods to Yuri, and steps up behind the lad, who is taken totally by surprise when a dirty hand claps over his mouth and another arm pinions his limbs... not painfully at all, but quite, quite irresistibly.

Yuri puts a finger to his lips in a 'shush'.

Yuri mutters, "We won't harm you. We want to leave. Tell us where we are, who lives here, and how to get outside."

The boy looks at Yuri, over Andreth's hand, and nods once. His lips move, but no sounds escape past the hand.

Andreth looks up at Yuri as the boy is questioned, then adds a hoarsely whispered, "...and no screamin' of course," before uncovering his mouth, tightening his grip ever so slightly for emphasis.

Yuri mutters, "Do you want to go with us?"

The boy shudders, then nods. "You're in the common room, where we all live. And Lord Mehallin lives above." He looks around. "And ... just go through the big door. That street will take you straight to the City's centre ..."

Starguard hmms. "Perhaps we should mention this Lord Mehallin to the Emperor."

Tilara says, "Perhaps we should. For now, let's get out of here before we're found, shall we?"

Yuri says, "Later. For now... we're leaving."

Yuri looks back at the boy. "We weren't here."

Following the rest of the party out, Ash's massive weapon is levelled near the potboy, casually resting in his muscled arms. "He means it," the warrior rumbles. "If we must return here to hush some fool... we will." The blade whistles back into a ready position and he stalks past.

The boy nods, watching the scruffy party emerge from the stairway and exit through the indicated door. Mostly, his gaze is concentrated on Ash. Beyond, all is darkness - the kind of darkness you get a few short hours before dawn. The streets are almost deserted, although a single man scurries past just as Yuri opens the door.

Andreth nods to the boy one last time, releases him, and hurries out the door to rejoin his companions.

Spilling out into the street, the party soon spots the rise of the emperor's palace complex, not to very far away. Whomever this Lord Mehallin is, he certainly lives close to the seat of power.

Tilara says, "Ah-hah.. there's the Palace. If we're that close, this Lord Mehallin fellow is probably a courtier. Let's let His Nibs deal with it. I've still got that ring we've been using as a pass."

Ash shakes his head, responding to Tilara. "The Empire is larger than we ourselves. If we can't deal with this difficulty, who are we to call ourselves the White Company? Perhaps Runners To The Emperor would be a better name."

Tilara says, "We can deal with it, but would it be the way he wants it? We don't want to interfere with Imperial politics, after all... and there may be bigger fish than this one to net."

Yuri says, "Well, he's got a thing about the color red, and an axe to grind with we, the White. This could be something as innocuous as a warped color preference."

Ash says, "Then let's learn what we can learn first, at least. Surely we're capable of even that?"

Yuri says, "Inn, first, then, to rest."

Tilara says, "Now that is a very good suggestion. And let's find out which sector we're in, shall we?"

Andreth nods to Yuri. "'sbeen a long day, and longest for poor Stormy, I'll bet. We all need some rest." He glances at Elisandra. "And what'll you do, miss?"

Elisandra looks around, wide-eyed, and shakes her head. "I ... I don't know. Where are we?"

Starguard says, "Citadel, ma'am. Near the palace."

Tilara says, "We are ... well, _we_ are home. Citadel, the capital of the Empire. How close that is to where you live, I can't say."

Elisandra shakes her head, still biting her lip. "I'm sorry; I've never .. never heard of this Citadel."

Yuri nods to Elisandra. "We'll send for Tormel. He may be able to figure out a way for you to get home from here."

Turning to look at Yuri, Elisandra smiles, truly smiles, for the first time in this adventure. Suddenly, she looks a lot prettier than she used to. Absolutely stunning, in fact.

Andreth's eyes go wide. "Never _'eard_ of Citadel?" He scratches his head. "It's only the capital of the whole Empire!" A few more seconds thought sets his head to over-heating, and he shakes his head. "Yeah, we'll leave it ta Tormel. First thing t'morrow."

Tilara chuckles. "If even he has heard of her native city. The Empire isn't the whole world, Andreth. And ... perhaps the whole world isn't all there is...."

Yuri notices Elisandra's smile, and stops short, before hastily reconstructing his composure. "Erh... anyway... the Inn."

While still pondering this startling new development, the party trudges wearily back to their home base, where their rooms await them. Little is said, as people tumble into beds, soon falling asleep, and left to sleep until late morning.

After a leisurely breakfast, the party splits up to run a few simple errands. Tilara, in her new cloak, easily retrieves the Company horses from the local stable, while others retrieve the newly identified magical trophies. They don't all look equally promising, but there are definite possibilities here ...

Meanwhile, Yuri steps round to investigate Perf's health. Finding him, recuperating, in a local temple, Yuri looks relieved. Perf's looking a lot better now, and already he's giving the clerics grief about wanting to rejoin his leader.

After soothing Perf, Yuri heads out into town. Tormel is easy enough to find, although he knows nothing about Elisandra's homeland, and little about Lord Mehallin, who appears to be a minor noble and a minor merchant. And the recent inheritor of a large mansion, which he immediately put on the market.

Tilara scouts around the marketplace and turns up some good deals on cold-weather gear, since the party will be accompanying Keorn up into the mountains. She also hunts up grapnels and pitons and rope. _Don't want to have to try climbing without climbing gear again any time soon. No one else wants to eat spiders, anyway..._

To the four winds the White Company goes, and from all directions the White Company converges on a comfortable Inn room, laden with the fruits of their labor - information, climbing gear, or simply renewed confidence. Andreth brings an assortment of rocks and bags with quasi-magic properties, while Tilara shows off the far more mundane, but just as important, climbing gear for the mountainous journey ahead. Minutes of discussion pass, on the topic of Elisandra and matters of late..

Elisandra, sitting in the corner, watches quietly, listening to all that passes around her. Her cloak is pulled taut around her, suggesting the tension she must surely be feeling in this strange city, this strange world, where none know her or her family.

Tilara settles down with a mug of ale and turns to Stormy. "So what happened? How'd you get caught?"

Stormy bites his lip. "A man ... complimented me on my tunic. He said he knew a place where I could ... could buy a matching cloak. For very little money." Stormy blushes, under Tilara's gaze. "I didn't think ..."

Starguard nods to Stormy. "It's alright. Neither did we, either. They caught us too."

Stormy looks confused. "What did ... what did they do to you? And where did Tilara get that cloak? It looks just like ... like one of theirs."

Ash has been of the opinion that Elisandra's fate should be left to the Emperor as a second boon; he listens now to Stormy's tale, contemplating the possibilities. "This Lord must have wanted something from us, and been watching not only you but Tilara as well," he says.

Yuri says, "We found their tailors. Rather obsessed with the color red."

Looking at Ash, Stormy bites his lip. "I think ... I think they wanted the entire White Company. They kept asking the same questions: who were we, where did we come from, what were our intentions." He turns to Yuri. "And I _couldn't_ answer those questions. I wouldn't have if I could, but I _couldn't_!" His voice rises, again, in tones of mounting hysteria.

Tilara says, "Aye, that they were. Something I was wearing, or something I said, seemed to match their instructions. They insisted on making it for me, and didn't charge me at all. It was spooky. Every time I offered, they got nervous, and said I shouldn't test them."

"They probably wanted to know more about the strangers who could walk into the Emperor's palace with an invitation two days after entering Citadel," observes Ash thoughtfully. "I doubt it was personal."

Stormy looks at Tilara, and then softly strokes the cloak. "It's ... very pretty. Do you think ... I could have one too?"

Yuri says, "Wait... Stormy... you mean you couldn't, as in, you didn't know the answers? As if there was magical interference?"

Tilara chuckles. "Do you really want to go back to those tailors, Stormy? We'll find you something like it somewhere else."

Andreth scratches his head, peering into his mug. "I wonder if they think we're some kinda secret society like them. Only white insteada red." He chuckles softly under his breath. "Maybe they're right?"

Yuri he glances at Elisandra a moment. _She also has things that she can't speak of. And it isn't voluntary, or natural._

Stormy looks at Yuri. "I just don't know! I mean ... where did you come from? What are our intentions ... I know the immediate answers, but ... you've never told me what we want to do over the long term. I ... " He stops, huddling in his tunic, and gripping his mug tightly. "I was hoping, someday, you'd trust me enough to tell me ..."

"As far as I can tell, Stormy, we do things like rescue our friends and try to hold the parts of the Empire we can reach together," remarks Ash. "A simple job, but not an obvious one, since there's no obvious reward for doing it. The White Company looks beyond itself."

Stormy nods, slowly. "I don't think ... they would have liked that answer."

Starguard hrrms, frowning, just listening to this. He shifts his attention to Elisandra, focusing on her, and her reactions.

Tilara hugs the boy. "Oh, Storm, Storm... it's not a matter of trust. We can't tell you what we don't know ourselves. We're getting involved in deep things, now, but we never intended anything but a group of adventurers acting for the common good."

Elisandra looks up at Ash's words, a thoughtful look settling on her visage, before she turns to stare into the flames of the fire in the hearth.

Stormy hugs Tilara back, uncurling as relief seeps through his marrow. "I'm so ... so glad. It hurt, not knowing. It really hurt."

Yuri sighs. "Tilara's right. We didn't really have a plan. We ran into each other, and we've just been running on crazy momentum since. We volunteered for whatever game the Gods wanted to play, and that got us to here."

Yuri says, "We never told you, Stormy, because I don't think we knew ourselves. Didn't even know that there was any question to answer. I suspect that this... lord of the red lint, if I may call him that... probably doesn't believe that a group of independants like us, could come out of nowhere and change the balance of the entire market."

Tilara sits back, glad that Stormy is looking more cheerful. "Now if you want to know, ask away. I grew up in Woolwich, myself, middle child of a prosperous, pompous ass of a weaver."

Andreth chuckles, and nods. "I grew up in Woolwich, 'n was raised up outa the Middens by Brother Oak. No big secrets there."

Stormy nods, smiling. "And he didn't know what a treasure he had in you, did he, Tilara?" He looks around at the others, and smiles ...

Starguard hmms. "How about you, Elisandra? Where are you from?"

Elisandra looks up from the flames. "Massilia. I lived in a large house with my sisters and my brother, and the nurses that took care of us, the governesses that tutored us, and the guards that kept us safe. We lived ... well, as happy as nineteen siblings can live, really. We had our garden, our library, our dojo, and our little brother ..."

Tilara chuckles. "Hah! He thought I was an ungrateful wretch of a daughter, 'cause I wasn't going to let him sell me to the son of one of his cronies. Oh, they called it a betrothal, but it was a sale, same as yours. They just put prettier words to it, is all. I wanted to do magic and have adventures, so I ran away."

Stormy looks at Tilara, his eyes wide as saucers. "You ... you ran away, before they could sell you?" He shakes his head. "I couldn't. I didn't. I ..." He pauses a moment, gathering back his self control, and smiles shakily. "I took a little longer to escape."

Yuri says, "If we'd have been thinking... maybe that old man would have known a way home. Well... small matter. We'll find another."

Tilara chuckles. "Well, they waited longer to sell me, too. By the time he tried, my powers were starting to work, and I nearly burned down the house. He threw me out himself."

Starguard hmms. "I was simpler. My father died in battle on the Lurinese front when I was ten. I spent fifteen years on the front trying to make sure fewer children would have to go through that."

Stormy nods, looking wide-eyed at Starguard. "That's why you're so good at healing? And why the gods spoke to you?" He smiles wistfully. "The gods never spoke to me ... Except that once."

Yuri turns to Elisandra. "The lord of this land owes us a favor, in return for a favor that we will be doing for him. That will take us to a distant land, on a mission of diplomacy. It will take several months. We could ask him to provide you with safe haven here, and perhaps guides and tutors so that you may learn where you are and find comfort here. If a route is discovered for you to get home, then we can arrange your return." He pauses. "That is, if you'd still want to return. It sounds like you've been living in somewhat cramped quarters with your family."

Tilara looks pensive. "I think he was expecting me to come back and beg his forgiveness, but I wouldn't do that. No matter how hungry I got. Then I found Mirra, and the troupe of players passed through and I learned to juggle. Eventually I came back on my own terms. The next time I go back it'll be as a grand lady, I expect, with the Emperor's warrant of service. Daddy will have a fit."

Starguard pats Stormy's back. "I was 36 when the Gods first spoke to me. I think you're ahead of the game, son."

Stormy giggles at Tilara, and then nods soberly. "And I'm sure ..." His eyes twinkle. "Absolutely sure you won't lord it over him. At all."

Elisandra looks thoughtful. "They weren't cramped; we all enjoyed them. But yes, staying here and learning sounds like a good idea. I'm not at all certain where to begin looking for my sister."

Yuri says, "Hmm. Well... since we're all sharing our origins... I was the eldest son in a weaver family. I just... didn't want to be a weaver, so I went out and found a job, any job, to preclude Father getting me into an apprenticeship. It just happened that the job was to recover the weapons that Ferg stole, and... it's sort of snowballed from there."

Stormy smiles at Yuri. "You were right, none of this was planned, at all, was it?"

Tilara says, "Not by _us_. I'm beginning to suspect the Gods of meddling with things, though."

Ash doesn't say much, on the subject of background at least. Those of his friends who are here know already, and he has little wish to advertise himself as an ex-bandit and bravo to the rest.

Andreth rubs his stubbled chin. "Meddling... or trying to help? Kinda hard to tell the difference sometimes, y'know."

Yuri says, "Unplanned, Stormy. We're not here as part of anybody's grand design. At least, not that we know of."

Elisandra looks up, at the mention of meddling gods, and smiles weakly.

The rest of the evening passes uneventfully, as packs are repacked, and belongings are checked one last time. After all, Keorn is expected tomorrow morning, and the Emperor has already warned the Company that Keorn likes to travel fast and light. And his words suggest that Keorn may not wholly appreciate the escort.

Early the following morning, after a pleasant night resting, the party once more convenes in the common room, where Elisandra waits quietly, wondering whether the company intends for her to accompany them.

Yuri says quietly, "We'd like you to come with us to meet the Emperor. Whatever happens next, we have to see him first."

After Elisandra nods her assent, the company sets out for the palace. The ring, which Tilara still carries, grants the company a quick escort to one of the smaller rooms near the throne room, where the company is left for only a few minutes before the Emperor strides in. Behind him, a shorter thickset man follows. The man has a scowl on his face, emphasized by black beetled brows that are currently pulled into a highly intimidating frown. Once inside, the emperor smiles at the company and after greeting every person by name, introduces Keorn.

Yuri steps forward and bows. "We're here to prevent a war. We're given to understand that this is also your task."

Keorn snorts. "You? Prevent a war?" He turns to look at the emperor. "Will these fops even keep up? We're falling behind schedule, I'm going to be cutting across country."

Yuri frowns. "Don't underestimate us. You should have seen us yesterday."

Starguard raises an eyebrow. "May I introduce myself, sir? Lieutenant Starguard, Aglamar Healing Units, retired. But not very long ago."

Andreth laughs. "Yuri, don't sweat it, 'e'll see soon enough. Don't spoil the surprise."

Keorn raises one of his eyebrows. "Ah. Yesterday. Do ... tell. You were, undoubtedly, marvelous, as you prowled through the marketplace, paying full price for trinkets." He whirls on Tilara. "Do you even _know_, missy, how to use those tools you've bought? And did you remember to buy hats?"

Tilara says, "Full cold-weather gear is with our horses. These are ... disguises. We do know what we're doing. Yesterday... well, we need to tell the Emperor, anyway. Sit and listen."

Ash holds himself still, familiar with this sort of man - his father and uncle, for example, who swore that spring planting would wait for no man, and were generally right. He'll speak when spoken to, and let Yuri talk otherwise.

Yuri pulls out a throwing dagger, his hand moving almost too quick to be seen, and throws it between Keorn's feet. Alas, his speed has definitely cost him accuracy, and the dagger lands a little less impressively, about a foot short. Keorn leans forward, picking up the knife, and then steps forward to stand in front of Yuri. He shakes his head once, eyes narrowed, and then looks at the emperor. Seeing an infinitesimal nod, he turns around, and clouts Yuri on the side of the head with a very closed and very painful fist, leaving Yuri's ears to ring for several moments. Then he leans forward a little. "Don't throw daggers, boy. It ... doesn't amuse."

Ash sighs, and shakes his head at this display. "Keorn," he says, hoping his voice will drown out any groans of pain from Yuri, "we are at your disposal. We leave when you are ready."

Keorn nods at Ash. "Very well. We leave in one hour. That should give you enough time to retrieve your horses and deal with your guest." He looks once, at Elisandra. "And what a toothsome guest you have ..."

Yuri scowls, slowly realizing the extent of his injury. "There. Now you've tested us, as has everyone else we've met since the snow melted. Now that we've dispensed with the obligatory insults, perhaps we can proceed."

Tilara clears her throat. "If you boys are done playing... Your Majesty, we spent most of the day two days gone on a rather odd little journey through magical gates."

Andreth's fingers twitch as Yuri springs into action, and he takes a step forward. But only a step, as he watches the results, and slowly relaxes, stepping back again and letting the proceedings continue.

The emperor turns to look curiously at Tilara. "That would explain ..." His voice tails off for a moment, and then he nods. "Go on."

Keorn shakes his head at Yuri. "You don't get it, boy, do you. That's not a test. You're not ready for tests, yet. Now shut up, while your elders sort this out."

Yuri shrugs. They're committed, either way.

Tilara briefly describes the events leading up to Stormy's disappearance, the odd tailors, the hidden room, and the labyrinth that they had to pass through to get to Stormy once again. "We came out, eventually, in the townhouse of one Mehallin, according to the scullery boy there. Stormy's questioners seemed obsessed with our appellation as the White Company... somehow it offends their sensibilities."

The Emperor nods. "Mehallin. Very well. I will have that investigated. Although I suspect I know where their interest originated." He pauses for a few moments, then nods at Elisandra. "And what will you do with her?"

Yuri says, "We ask that she remain here, as your guest, until a means of returning her to her homeland is found, or she decides that she wishes to go elsewhere."

Starguard says, "Assuming that's alright with you, Elisandra."

Tilara nods. "We have no idea where her homeland is, Sire. We found her in that labyrinth."

Yuri says, "If we return from this mission, then perhaps we can make our own efforts in that direction. For now, we have our priorities committed."

The emperor nods. "Very well. We can easily find a place for her." He turns to Elisandra, waiting to see her answer to Starguard's question. When she nods, diffidently, he smiles, and turns back to the company. "Then there rests only the question of your remaining boon. What will it be?" He smiles at Keorn. "We are both ... curious."

Tilara looks nonplussed. "Well... that was it, really, sire."

The emperor smiles. "I see. No. That's not a boon; she'll merely serve as one of my wife's ladies. Name a boon." Keorn looks at the emperor, and scowls once more, before handing over a heavy, clinking pouch.

Yuri allows himself a small, slow smile. "I think we're happy enough with our situations, Milord."

Tilara shrugs. "Unless you have some kind of protective amulet that's just burning a hole in your pocket, sire. I sometimes feel rather acutely the lack of armor that Stormy and I have to deal with."

The emperor sighs. "I would like to see this boon cleared, Yuri, if I can. Some debts, when held too long, begin to fester."

Starguard nods. "Magical protection and arms are always of use, and hard to acquire. If nothing else, it would help us be sucessful in our mission."

Yuri says, "It seems that's all we lack, then."

The emperor looks at Keorn, and smiles. "What say you; shall we gift them with a passel of bracers? Those may serve you well?" Keorn looks back, grunting, and shrugs. The emperor turns to smiles at Tilara. "I have three pairs of bracers, unmarked, that will provide protection when needs must. Will these serve, and satisfy a boon?"

Tilara bows. "For myself, I would be honored, sire."

Yuri says, "It seems that we are agreed."

The emperor smiles. "Keorn will have them when he meets you at the front gate in an hour. If you will excuse me ... duty calls." With that he crooks his finger at Elisandra, gesturing that she should follow him, and leaves the room. Now only Keorn is left behind.

Tilara says, "Where precisely are we headed?"

Keorn smiles wolfishly. "The mountains. Simply follow me, and we'll be there in no time."

An hour later the company reassembles at the front gate, horses packed and in tow, where Keorn meets them. Brusquely, he hands out three pairs of bracers, which are soon seen to fit Andreth, Tilara, and Stormy perfectly. Each of them is made of finely tooled leather, but is otherwise wholly unmarked. Sardonically, Keorn watches as the bracers are carefully put on. Then he turns, leading the party out of Citadel, and into Lurin. By nightfall, the party has long since left the road, and is traveling cross country. The horses looking a little tired, Keorn calls a halt, and suggests the company make camp while he looks around.
