# Birthright 2003-04-06

When last we left our brave and intrepid party, they had just made camp. Keorn had stalked off, after depositing the party in a small copse of woods on the top of a slight hill. Well, more of a bump in the landside. But I digress. The night was dark. The stars were visible. There were no clouds. It was not stormy.

Ash spent parts of the trip explaining things to the rest of the party - open-air tactics. He's done some thinking since the encounter with the labyrinth and its denizens.

Starguard shrugs at Keorn's distance as everyone pitches in to set up camp, a well-practiced proceedure by now. He takes a moment, however, to get Yuri's attention.

Yuri says, "Hmm? Yes, Brother?"

Starguard says, "Just for the record, what possessed you to throw a dagger at someone that we're depending on for the next week or so to lead us through hostile woods?"

Yuri sighs. "Everyone we run into seems to have a test prepared for us, and insults whether we succeed or not. Only the Lady Major and the Emperor himself didn't give us a hard time. Keorn didn't give me a lot of reason to think he'd be different. I thought that if we could get the macho pissing match out of the way early, it would make the rest of this a lot easier."

Tilara twitches an eyebrow at Starguard's question and turns her attention to Yuri. "A very good question."

Starguard ahs. "No problem then. Just misread things a little. It happens." Satisfied, he returns to preparing supper, meat from town and fresh food available for the first night, at least.

Ash scratches his head, and replies, "well.. to be fair, everyone we've met recently has also probably seen us as a group of cocky strangers who claim to be on a mission from god and have wildly outrageous demands... however, we can still be CIVIL cocky strangers."

Andreth sighs a little, shaking his head. "Huh. Well, the woods're test enough, if y'ask me. And they's a fair test too." He shrugs. "As it is, I hope he hain't just left us to go on by hisself," he says, glancing in the direction in which Keorn departed.

Yuri says, "Yeah, well, I suppose that throwing knives at people can be petty uncivil. Except when it isn't. Grikurgrah probably would have been really impressed if we'd shoved a sword through his gullet."

Tilara nods. "Let our actions speak for themselves, and not brag. We're still unknown quantities in the Empire, even if His Nibs thinks we've got potential."

Starguard shakes his head. "He's a bit of an ass, but he's good, Keorn. And probably listening. Probably thinks he's earned the right to be an ass, saddled with us. He's wrong, but doesn't change what he thinks."

Yuri shrugs. "We've got our mission. That's enough for now."

Tilara chuckles. "He may not be wrong, either. Let's see how he does before we make that determination, shall we?"

Starguard says, "Have some faith, Tilara. We've handled things well so far."

Yuri says, "Maybe we should drill on those new tactics Ash has suggested. You can't go wrong with training, even if your observers aren't impressed."

Starguard nods. "After supper. We've been riding all day, let's eat before practice."

Tilara says, "But we should, then, yes." She tilts her head, listening to something only she can hear. "No, you don't have to, Mirra."

Starguard raises an eyebrow. "Perhaps she should, Til. She is a member of the company."

Tilara grins. "She either rides my shoulder or pounces on anything that gets too close. Doesn't make a difference for practice."

After Starguard's usual cooking endeavours, slightly limited by the way his legs are _killing_ him - who knew that riding a horse for eight hours could be so painful - the party drills the new combat tactics Ash has proposed, refining them slightly, and getting used to the way they drill as a unit.

Satisfied, finally, with their drills, they turn in for the night. Keorn hasn't returned yet, when Ash and Yuri separate to watch the countryside. And when, an hour or so later, Ash spots three large shapes skulking across the fields below, there still is no sign of Keorn.

Moving as surely as he can, Ash begins backtracking to where Yuri should be, describing in terse and hushed tones what he saw. He moves toward the campsight with all rapidity consistent with stealth, touching shoulders or shaking blankets one by one as appropriate.

The shapes pad quietly, soundlessly, closer. Under the light of the stars you can soon make out their fluid catlike shapes, the small square heads, the quiet ropelike tails.

"Wall up," hisses Ash, taking his place. "Identify yourselves!" he calls aloud into the uncertain gloom.

Yuri readies his shortbow, hoping that he can get one shot if he needs to before melee begins.

Tilara shifts into the position they practiced, limbering up her short-spear. _Anyone we know, Mirra?_

The creatures continue padding closer, spread out so that there's easily ten or fifteen feet before them. _Large sisters_ Mirra sends to Tilara. _Hunting sisters. Hungry sisters._

Ash's sword sings as it leaves the scabbard, and he prepares himself on one end of the formation.

Andreth falls into fighting stance, one callused palm held flat ahead of him. He remains where he is, Ash's discussion earlier having convinced him of the need to maintain battle discipline. For it looks like we will indeed be fighting...

The large hunting cats, for such they now clearly are, pad into camp, nosing around Keorn's bedroll. The biggest settles down with her head on his pack, while the other two curl up on either side of her.

Tilara says, "Mirra says they're hunting cats. She doesn't recognize them, so I don't think it's Keorn."

Starguard ahas. "Keorn! These are yours, I take it?" he calls out into the darkness.

The darkness stays stubbornly mute.

Yuri looks nonplussed. "Friends of his, I guess."

Ash sighs, backing off and lowering his sword in frustration. _At least we've established who the bigger show-off is,_ he thinks bitterly. "Let's stay alert for the moment," he suggests.

Starguard says, "They seem fairly tame. Can Mirra communicate with them, Til?"

Tilara says, "Not really. She's good at reading their body language, but she can't really speak with them the way that Starguard's spell works."

Yuri says, "Well... let's keep an eye on them. We've got the rest of the night to get through."

One of the two smaller cats hisses softly at Mirra, who stalks closer, tail held straight up in the air. They exchange scents, it seems, rubbing nuzzles together for a moment, before Mirra turns back to Tilara. _Odd scent. Cat. Not cat._

Andreth watches the beasts warily, staying close to his allies. "Well, they're more'n just dumb beasts, or else they'd ha' attacked by now. Or 'least try to take our food." He shakes his head. "I dunno if I'll sleep too good with these things around, though..."

Tilara settles back down, 'listening' as her familiar investigates the odd felines. She blinks at one comment. "Cat, but not cat, she says. Changers, I think." She clears her throat, addressing them directly. "Do you understand Mar, Changers?"

The tallest of the cats looks up, her gaze slicing into Tilara. Her eyes do not blink, and she remains motionless, her tail twitching againstthe ground.

Starguard says, "Well, you got its attention. Would you like a bit of leftover meat from supper?"

Yuri resumes his patrol, since the others seem to have the... guests... covered. Ash joins him.

The cats turn to look at Starguard, all three piercing him with their gaze. Their expressions remain politely inscrutable.

Tilara murmurs, "Hers, Starguard. I'm not sure that she understands Mar, but she recognized 'Changer'." She takes a bite from a chunk of leftover roast and moves slowly toward the trio, holding the rest out to them. "Be welcome, then."

At a tailflick, the smallest of the three cats rises, sniffing the left over roast, and then daintily catching it between her teeth, taking it back to share with her sisters.

Yuri calls to Tilara, "That one might be eating for a litter."

Tilara nods. "So Mirra thinks, as well. Scent differences."

Starguard nods. "I noticed too. I'd offer help, but I tend to specialize on human patients."

Tilara chuckles. "I don't think she's due right this minute, Starguard."

Andreth grunts softly, and settles back onto his bedroll. "Strange......" he says, scratching his head, and shrugs. "Well, I hope they ain't gonna cause trouble f'r us, that's all..."

Starguard hmms. "I'll ask the Stars to speak with them in the morning... Barring Keorn showing up to explain things, anyway."

The cats lie, lazily admiring the camp, the stars, or anything passing in front of their open eyes, as their tails switch in lazy patterns against the ground. As the Mother Star falls beneath the horizon, heralding the coming of the dawn. As one, the three cats rise, sniffing the bedroll one last time, before fluidly moving down the hill.

Stormy, noticing the cats leaving, looks at Starguard, waiting for guidance.

Starguard places a hand on Stormy's shoulder. "Let them go. If all they wanted was to share a fire for the night, that's no problem."

Stormy nods, looking out over the fields. Then he points at a single figure in the distance, who is slowly but steadily jogging closer.

Starguard hmms, and waves to the figure, guessing it's Keorn, looking for a response.

The figure slowly but steadily approaches, eventually resolving into what looks like Keorn. And in fact is Keorn, when he strides into the camp. He tur ns to Starguard. "Can we leave in an hour? There's trouble ahead."

Starguard nods. "Sure. We can eat breakfast on horseback. Do you know anything about the three cats that spent the night by the fire, for the record?"

Starguard motions for Stormy to wake the sleepers.

Keorn raises one hairy eyebrow. "Three cats? No."

Ash wakes slowly, mumbling ill-tempered curses aimed at the world at large as consciousness assaults him. His ears register the newcomer momentarily, and he begins to rise.

Yuri awakens, and takes a moment to reflect upon how foul his mood has turned over the past month. The haste to break camp registers upon him, and he begins to gather up gear and pack horses.

Starguard says, "We had three hunting cats, which appeared to be unusally bright spend the night. No fighting, so we let them stay."

Tilara yawns, having not had a restful night. Mirra had nudged her awake when the cats left, and she'd just started drifting off again. "They seemed to be interested in your bedroll, for some reason. They also seemed to understand us when we spoke to them." She stretches and starts packing up her gear. "And what kind of trouble are we talking about?"

Andreth stretches in fluid motions, his eyes still looking somewhat bleary. "Trouble, eh... figgers." He lets his companions tell the story of the night's visitors, focusing himself on awakening - middle watch is always somewhat stressful.

Keorn frowns, biting his lip. "Well, we'd best break camp as quickly as we can then. I don't like this." He moves to his horse, quickly saddling it.

After breaking camp at breakneck speed, hustled along every step of the way by a definitely cranky Keorn, the party once more sets off cross country, alternating short canters with longer trots. In late afternoon Keorn calls a halt. The horses definitely needs resting.

The party stops, again, at the top of a hill, though this time there are no trees to provide shelter. Only three rocks, in a burial formation, one lying on the other two. All three are covered in moss, and Keorn throws his bedroll underneath. "We camp here for four hours, and then move on. Double watches, please."

Starguard frowns at Keorn. "Want to tell us what's going on? We might react better if we had a clue."

Keorn looks at Starguard. "I don't know. The signs and portents are all wrong. There's a smell in the air of doom. Lifall walks again, the birds cry, and the rodents burrow deeper than usual."

Yuri says, "We already have two people on each watch. You want more?"

Keorn nods. "At least half on each. We pause for the horses, not you. There's stream at the foot of the hill: some of you should go get water for your beasts. Water mine at the same time?"

Ash is joined by Firestorm, and carefully leads the riding animals away, seeking water and refreshment. On his way, he continually scans the area around him, keyed up by last night's 'visitors' and wary of ambush every step of the way.

Tilara curls up to nap while Stormy takes the first watch. _Bleedin' mystical doomsayer..._

Yuri carefully examines each fo the standing stones in turn. In places, he even scratches the moss away. In a few places he finds seemingly meaningful scratches, but their meaning eludes him. but at the base of one of the standing stones, in the deepest shadow, he finds a series of pictograms.

The first of the four pictures shows what look like a hunting cat, a wolf, and a large deer, standing side by side, while a hawk flies overhead. Then in the second picture, the hawk has flown away, and the deer lies dying. In the third, the wolf, too, lies bleeding. And in the fourth, the cat is giving birth ... to four cubs. Who look like a deer, a wolf, a hawk, and a cat ...

Andreth stretches his legs as he leans against one of the standing stones. He doesn't comment on the soreness of his limbs from the unaccustomed hard riding, since surely everyone else feels the same. He just wishes the bowlegged feeling would go away faster...

Keorn watches Yuri scrabbling at the rocks, his hands loosely slung in his belt, before he sits down besides Tilara and closes his eyes.

Yuri points out his finds to Ash and Stormy when they come by. "This might be part of a Changer creation story. I'm going to make a sketch; we might find someone who knows more later."

Ash nods slowly, as he returns and glances, then stares, at the relief. ".. It's part of somethin'," he agrees thoughtfully.

Yuri says, "The odd part is that we haven't seen any deer-changers. Cats, hawks, and wolves, but nothing with antlers." He pauses. "I wonder who's buried here."

Ash says, "somebody who'd best stay that way. Let's keep sharp now."

Yuri says, "Yeah. I guess we don't have much time." He resumes watch.

Three hours later, Keorn's eyes open, and he stretches, standing up. "Starguard; why don't you cook a solid supper? The horses should be ready to go in an hour or so, if we feed them now. And I think the Company can use the steady meal. It's going to be a long ride tonight."

Starguard hrrms. "Night riding? We're not the most accomplised of riders," he warns, while working up a thick stew.

Keorn nods. "I've noticed. And your cooking needs work, Brother. But ... we need to move on. The horses will take you; just let them follow my lead."

Andreth returns from the patrol. "Must be in a hurry, then," he comments to Starguard. "We'll ride. We'll have to."

Starguard shrugs. "I've usually slept more. Helps when you're putting spices in."

Keorn smiles wryly. "Spices always help." He pulls out a spoon and steadily eats the stew, before standing up and looking around. "There's things you no doubt want to know." He looks at Ash and Starguard, patiently.

Ash nods slowly. "Well, we ran into some wolves," he begins, and in short, terse sentences briefly sketches out the party's continual dances with wolves (and hawks). To a man the Emperor trusts, there are few secrets, so he faithfully includes Andreth's demise (and recovery from it). ".. So basically, these two things are connected. We're very interested in knowing HOW, and what this Courtship business is all about. The Changers seem to have started stirring for it, as well. We've seen no Elk-type Changers, that we know of, but the pictogram suggested otherwise?"

Keorn nods, momentarily looking impressed. "You have learned more than I had guessed. Yes. The elk are the fourth Changer clan. And the Courtship will be a time of renewal, I think, when the Maiden becomes the Mother. The courtship addresses the question of fatherhood; the Maiden is known. I believe. I am not, entirely, certain." He pauses, looking out again to see if there are animals or birds around.

Ash nods slowly. "So I suppose the Crone... well, moves on." _Like winter, and spring.. but there's three of them, so it's not quite a perfect match. Still._ "What is renewed? The Changers? The world? Samaela herself, or themselves?"

Tilara says, "So. We've been warned not to get directly involved in the Courtship. Any idea why that might be?"

Keorn points at the pictograms that Yuri has uncovered. "This is the tale of the Changer origins. They were born, from where they do not know. And there was much hate among them, for the lion would not lie with the deer, and the hawk would not rest with the wolf. And then, when all had died, and only one Maiden remained, the Changers were reborn." He nods at Ash. "When the Changers are reborn, the world is renewed. So say the teachers. As for the Courtship, Tilara ... there are many prophesies. One speaks of the day the Maiden mates with one who is not a changer. And the world is not reborn."

Yuri says, "So... if the Courtship addresses fatherhood... then there is probably competition among the clans and families to be the one chosen as father. And if that's the case, we've been instructed not to get involved in the courtship to avoid tempting the fates to enact that part of the prophecy."

Tilara says, "How often do these renewals come about?"

Keorn sighs. "I don't know. When the renewal is needed? When the clans are weakened? When our god wakes, and reminds us?"

Keorn pulls out a dagger from his pack. "Three of these daggers have been found. A fourth is still missing. When that dagger is found, the Courtship will resume." He holds out the dagger for the Company's perusal. It's a plain steel blade, the hilt wrapped in leather, and a single brown gem in the hilt. "I carry the wolf's blade, as a gift from the Emperor and my sister."

Yuri speculates further. "And if it _does_ work that way, then it will bode ill for the Empire and our families if the mate selected as father, is one of the Changers who seems to want a war."

"It sounds like the Changers and Samaela work a bit like the Syndics, back home," comments Ash after a moment. "Lain was our matron, who created the farm and brought about our big family. I imagine Samaela is like that.. once a person, now something like a...a.. a role in a magic ritual, some woman who's descended either by birth or by..something.. from that first one.. and that when the Courtship comes about, this new Samaela - the Maiden - finds someone, and her mother, and HER mother... all sort of bear the title, but in different ways, at different times..."

Tilara says, "But this time, it appeared on a new Spire. Something about this one is different."

Yuri sits up and glances at Keorn's dagger, and then jumps to his feet. "Oh, dear Lord of All Trade. That's what it was. Jane's dagger! Except it had a green stone!"

Keorn looks at Yuri, his brows creased. "What dagger?"

Andreth rubs his chin, as a thought forms in his mind. If it is important that the Maiden _not_ mate with one who is not a Changer, then... His slow train of thought, however is interrupted - or perhaps sent on a new track - at Yuri's exclamation.

Tilara inhales and looks sharply at the dagger, then curses in three languages. "That's it, all right. Which one is missing, Keorn?"

"The Elk's blade. It has been missing for several generations now." Keorn sighs. "Though rumours swirl."

Yuri says, "Our first job, before we were the White Company, was just under three months ago. A blacksmith in Woolwich was burgled. One of the items she said was missing, was a dagger with a green stone. She wouldn't tell us what it was."

Starguard says, "In fact, it's a pretty decent bet that Ferg ended up with it, now I think about it."

Yuri says, "Her sister, Berina, came to Woolwich looking for it, but it had already been stolen. The theives were led by a man named Ferg. We don't know who he was working for, but they were possibly the same people that snatched Stormy a few days ago - they use the same fire-portals, at any rate."

Tilara nods. "Aye. Or he turned it over to his masters, belike, as we never found it when we took him down."

Keorn listens quietly, as he slides the dagger into a sheath hanging at his belt. Now, one hand holds the dagger at all times. "Ferg?"

Tilara shrugs. "The only name we knew him by." She gives a brief description of the man's appearance and habits.

Yuri says, "Ferg. Not a week goes by that I don't regret sparing his life."

Ash nods. "I knew him somewhat better, having worked for him for a time in a .. moment of rashness. He always kept his secrets, even from his top men. It's said that one of the fighting orders whose chapter-houses is now in Citadel had a martial discipline .. much like his."

Keorn turns to look at Ash. "This Ferg; you served with him. Whom did he serve?"

Ash shrugs helplessly. "Ferg served Ferg, to any extent that his behavior or words would indicate. Certainly he enjoyed some patronage, but to whom or where is a mystery. We DO have some of the feathers whose magic he employed for transportation," he adds, turning to Yuri questioningly.

Tilara motions Stormy over, as the discussion continues. "Anything you can add would be helpful."

Stormy bites his lips. "He railed against Berina a few times; claimed he would not be her lap dog. But he ... I never saw the dagger."

Starguard huhs, taking this all in.

Yuri fishes in the magic pouch, and recovers one of the feathers, wondering if it will have the bright coloration or not.

Yuri says, "Huh? Stormy, how did he know Berina?"

Stormy shrugs. "I don't know. He only railed at her when he was drunk. She was not there."

Keorn looks at each of the Company members in turn, noting the bright feather Yuri is holding but staring longest at Andreth's collection of throat and facial scars. "I see now, why the emperor sent you with me." His lips twist. "Younglings and untutored as you may be."

Andreth has, while all this been going on, still been watching Keorn and his dagger, and fingering the old scar at his throat. Finally, he speaks up. "You carry the wolf blade, Keorn..." his gravelly voice showing no emotion other than curiosity. "You of the wolf clan, then?"

Yuri says, "Lord Mehallin... does Berina work for him?"

Keorn turns to face Andreth, both hands falling to his dagger and sword, legs braced in an obvious fighting stance. In a loud, proud voice he declaims his lineage. "I am Keorn of the Wolf, foster brother to Marilan, sworn defender of the Emperor. I am kin to Wolf, kin to Cat, kin to Hawk, kin to Elk. I go to the Courtship bearing one of the Blades."

Yuri says, "So... that's why those big cats last night, acted so familiar."

Keorn shrugs. "My kin live over the mountain: those cats were strange to me."

Tilara says, "Indeed. Wonder what they wanted, then? They weren't hostile."

Andreth stands in response, but not as in a fighting stance, but that he may bow deeply in respect. "Well met, Keorn," he says, before taking his seat once more.

Keorn relaxes a little, and looks at Tilara. "I do not know, lady. The portents are not what they should be. Lifall should not walk."

Tilara waves a hand, deprecatingly. "We're not as knowledgeable as we'd like, Keorn, but we've learned enough not to react with unthinking prejudice. But ... that is unsettling. Should not, because the time is wrong, or because other signs are not right?"

Yuri says, "In any case, it seems best that we shouldn't advertise that to others, especially while in Lurinor."

Tilara snorts. "I don't believe we want to advertise even our presence in Lurinor, from what the Emperor told us about the past history they have with Changers. Does anyone else speak Lurinese?"

Keorn smiles wryly. "The emperor knows. My foster-sister knows. You know. None else know."

Yuri smiles a wry smile, and makes an unpleasant speculation about Lurin's experiments in animal husbandry in perfect Lurinese.

Keorn raises one eyebrow at Yuri, and smiles slyly, before responding in perfect Lurinese that most peasants lack the requisite swiving ability.

Yuri says, "Keorn... what do the daggers signify? If you carry a dagger to Courtship, it must mean something. That means that whoever ended up with the green-gemmed dagger wanted influence in the Courtship as well."

Tilara grins at the comments. "Very nice. If you're trying to embarrass me, it's not going to work, though."

Yuri deciphers Keorn's comment, and emits a startled cough. _My, that was blunt. Perhaps I'm going to like him after all._

Yuri allows himself a chuckle. "I know you better than that, Tilara."

Keorn watches Tilara, and smiles, before turning to Yuri. "To earn the Dagger is the first step of the Courtship. When the four daggers are presented to the Maiden, she will set the second test."

Tilara says, "But if the Elk blade has been missing for generations... can you start without the four?"

Keorn sighs. "We don't know."

Yuri says, "I don't think that it will remain missing for long, and we will learn much from whoever shows up carrying it."

Keorn nods at Yuri. "That is certainly the Maiden's hope."

Starguard hrrms. "Well, as we don't have a dagger, how could we get involved too deeply in the courtship?"

Ash says, "It's either we leave it be and trust SOMEBODY to show up, or we go in search of some group of people we have no knowledge of, employing magic that's leagues ahead of anything we can understand, much less deal with equitably."

Tilara says, "I've got this horrid feeling that Ferg will show up with it. How do the Changers feel about poison?"

Keorn sighs at Starguard. "The dagger ... binds itself to the bearer. And they are heavy to carry, quick to anger, and short on patience."

Yuri says, "In any case... it seems haste would be appropriate." He pauses, catching an implication. "So if you're presenting the dagger, you're competing for the Maiden's hand?"

Tilara says, "By definition. And this is one reason, then, that we were forewarned not to become involved. Unless one of you boys is a Changer and hasn't told the rest of us?"

Yuri says, "I hope whoever shows up with the fourth dagger is a Changer, then, at least."

Andreth grins wryly at Tilara. "Now we know how _not_ t'get involved in the courtship..."

Yuri says, "Because if he's also competing for the Maiden's hand, then... well... I don't enjoy witnessing the fulfillment of prophecies of that kind."

Keorn sighs, looking at the horses who look a lot more rested now. "In any case, that is the main of it. And Lurin has gotten wind of this expedition. Shall we ride?"

Starguard nods. "Let's go, people."

As te Company has learned more about their journey,the urgency has increased. While the light lasts, Keorn leads the party on a jarring canter, before slowing to a walk at dusk. The horses look tired, but still have enough energy to shy away when a pack of wolves flow out of a copse of trees, surrounding you.

Starguard pulls out his crossbow, frowning. "Yes?" he asks, mildly.

The wolves surround the party, pacing you as the horses nervously prance forward.

Ash shakes his head. "Think who we're with, Starguard."

Starguard looks to Keorn. "I'm betting if they're friendly, they wouldn't be encircling us..."

Tilara nods as the wolves join formation. _Calm down, Mirra, they're an honor guard, I think._ "Any way to convince the horses they mean no harm?"

Keorn looks at the wolves. "We ride until the moon's highest point, and camp. The pack will guide us."

Ash calls for a box formation, then begins guiding his own mount into position, in response to Starguard's wariness.

Yuri says, "Starguard? Did you say something about being able to speak to animals? How about telling our horses not to go crazy?"

Starguard nods. "I didn't bother after the cats left. A poor choice, now I think of it."

Yuri forms up behind Ash, and loosens the bindings on his defender sword. _Curious allies, indeed._

Starguard reholsters his crossbow. He's cautious, but not violent.

The party slowly moves through the countryside. At the wolf pack's urging, they turn south, no longer heading due west. And when the moon is at her highest point, Keorn calls a halt. Quickly, the horses are unsaddled, and the wolves spread in a wide circle, giving the horses the peace they crave; only the pack leader sleeps besides Keorn that night.

As the Mother Star fades from the sky, the wolves quietly rise, and pad away. All except one bitch, obviously pregnant, who pads to the fire, and drops off four plump very dead rabbits.

She noses Keorn, on his cheek where he lies watching, and then follows the other wolves. Once more, the party is left alone.

Yuri murmurs, to nobody in particular, "Even in the lands of our enemies, perhaps we shall find allies."

Tilara twitches an eyebrow at that. "Aye. Hadn't thought that would apply to Lurinor, but you may be right."

Yuri says, "I wonder if this is how the war with the Stormwinds got started. One small mistake at the wrong time, and the world comes down on your head. If there was a group of people like us, on a similar mission, in similar circumstances, history does not record their name."

Keorn looks at the rabbits. "Shall we feast?" He sits up against the nearest tree, obviously taking his ease. "We made good time, and we should not let this gift go to waste." He pulls out a small piece of leather, and begins mending it. "And besides, we have a short trip today: we will face the Wastes in daylight, or die. The wolves steered us away from danger, but ..."

Starguard says, "My, you're full of positive thoughts this morning, Yuri."

Starguard nods, and begins to skin and cook the rabbits, roasting them quickly.

Yuri says, "Our comforts and allies are both chosen the same way, Starguard."

Yuri says, "What are the Wastes?"

Ash is occupied with his own thoughts, and having studied the wolves earlier with some attention, seems now focused on them. He takes strides across the ground, pacing that of the animals, then spends a few moments ducking and weaving against empty air, steps back thoughtfully, and begins murmuring to himself.

Keorn sniffs the air. "A little further from the fire, Brother, and the rbabits won't char so badly." He looks at Yuri. "The Wastes are a swampland. A morass; there are few paths, and the dead have been known to frolic there."

Yuri thinks, and nods. Walking dead are not news.

Keorn smiles at Yuri. "Of course, when the world is dying, and being reborn ... the dead usually come out. It would be ... disturbing if they did not."

Tilara says, "So if that's a _good_ portent, what's a _bad_ one?"

Yuri says, "Thus proving my point, about taking comforts where you can."

Keorn looks around at the campsite. "We will leave after breakfast, and make camp in mid afternoon. Plan your evening well; we must prepare."

After finishing the charred rabbits, the party saddle up once more. Legs are finally beginning to adapt to this way fo traveling, and the pain is beginning to diminish. Still, a short day will be a pleasant journey.

Keorn leads effortlessly, heading straight to yet another outcropping on the land. And indeed, you arrive in the middle of the afternoon at an easily defensible position: a ring of standing stones perhaps thirty feet across; twelve standing stones in total. Although two have fallen against each other. Keorn calls a halt here. "We will camp. I will stand first and third watch with you.

Yuri says, "What are we expecting? Walking dead? Lurin's troops?"

Keorn shrugs. "Either. Or both. I don't know. In the Wastes we will fight the stinking ones."

Keorn watches a hawk fly overhead, and sighs. "Watch the camp; I will return in the morning."

Tilara says, "Make sure you do. I don't think we want to explain to His Nibs that you got killed on the way there."

Keorn smiles. "I will. Watch for me by sunrise."

Soon Starguard is busy, brewing his potion, while the rest of the company fortifies the campsite. There's much to be said for height, and ropes are being slung so that people can easily scale the stones.

Yuri examines each of the stones, carefully. These look younger than those he saw night before last. Less moss, less lichen. There's very few scratches, except at the base of each stone ... now that he looks more carefully, there's one picture at the base of each stone.

Clockwise, the oldest and most faded seems to represent a wolf's head. As do the next two. Then a hawk's claw, followed by a cat's footprint on three stones. Two more hawk's claws, and twice what look like antlers. The last stone ... is unreadable. Someone has chipped the stone just where the picture would be.

Yuri says, "I wonder if this is another piece of history."

Yuri says, "This may be the order of succession for the Fathers, or possibly the Mothers. There's three of each, not necessarily in order, except for two of the Elk."

Yuri says, "If there's supposed to be some kind of symmetry, that would bode ill for us. It would mean that Elk is supposed to succeed this time."

Ash shrugs. "If something is supposed to succeed or not, then why does it matter what second test Samaela puts anyone to?"

Yuri says, "I don't know. Perhaps fate is like a great weight, that you can only move with effort."

Yuri says, "Or perhaps the chipped stone means something else. I think it's odd to find these stones deep in Lurinor, don't you? Keorn has taken us to rest at several places that have markings related to the Changer story. Why didn't we run across these in Aglamar?"

Ash rubs the back of his head thoughtfully. "Uh.. you see a lot of well-maintained caravan roads around?"

Tilara says, "We didn't know where to look, perhaps."

Andreth shrugs as well. "Yeah, Keorn weren't leading us cross country in Aglamar. Anyways, we're rushin' to meet Fate now, we'll see what it looks like when we gets there."

The evening passes quietly. There's not a peep out of the local wildlife. In fact, there's no evidence of local wildlife at all. After a restful evening, the party sets up the watches, and settles in for sleep.

All is quiet, until Ash and Yuri both, at the same time, smell a faint ... smell. A foul smell, that leaves them slightly nauseous.

"Wake up," Ash shouts, recalling Keorn's words. "The 'stinking ones' are here. Wake!" He draws his blade and crouches a bit, ready to move.

Yuri remembers Keorn's comment about 'the stinking ones', and wakes as many people as he can, none too gently.

Starguard gets up quickly, reaching for his morning star and crossbow. "Where?"

Yuri says, "Just follow your nose. And get ready."

As the company wakes, figures slowly move up the side of the outcropping, on three sides.
