# Birthright 2003-04-13

After waking up the party quietly, Ash and Yuri go back to watching the approaching humanoids. The stench alone is becoming disturbing.

"Up the ropes, everyone!" barks Ash crisply. "Starguard, defend them!" He's already preparing his own weapon to strike, retreating backwards toward the nearest rope, willing to stand and if necessary die for those he's protecting.

"Andreth, lantern oil," adds Ash. "Grab and climb!"

Starguard nods, moving quickly, fumbling with his crossbow. "They aren't friendly!" he calls, watching one of the things lumber closer.

Tilara says, "No kidding. If you can get oil on them, Stormy and I can set it off."

Andreth blinks sleep away, then obeys the voice of command, scooping up a bottle of lantern oil and hauling himself up the stone beside Yuri's.

From a perch on top of one of the stones, Yuri carefully sights in on the monster approaching from the southeast. The arrow strikes it solidly in the torso, staggering it.

Andreth lays one of the bottles of lantern oil in his sling - if Ash thought it was so important that he bring it up with him, he _must_ want him to use it on the stinking ones, right? Swinging the bottle once, twice, three times - it goes soaring through the air and dashes itself to pieces square on target, dousing it with the oil.

As the creatures shamble closer, the stench becomes more nauseating, driving like jackhammers up everyone's nostrils. Still, most are able to shake off the side effects and continue on.

Tilara readies her crossbow as the creatures shamble closer. She's about to fire when the wind shifts and a wave of stench washes over her. Her stomach heaves and her shot goes wild.

Crouching on top of the standing stone, Stormy swallows, and then shoots his crossbow at the approaching monster. Worried about his friends, his aim is off and his shot goes wide.

Ash says, "Tilara, Stormy, get ready with spells when they close in.. missile fire concentrated southeast!"

"Cut the ropes!" adds the warrior, beginning to dislodge his own from the stone, prepared to literally cut through it if necessary.

Starguard yells as his attention is pulled from one creature to another as it chrages him, clawing and biting, long gashes spouting blood. "Bastard!" he cries, loosing a crossbow bolt into the creature as he steps back, staggering the creature as he quickly switches to his morning star.

Yuri sees Starguard taking a beating, and mutters under his breath. He sights in carefully at the back of the creature while it's occupied with Starguard, and lets fly; an arrow appears poking through the creature at the shoulder.

Tilara slaps another quarrel into her crossbow and fires again, trying to keep her stomach under control.

Andreth unlimbers his crossbow and takes careful aim at the creature that just slashed at Starguard. His aim is steady and true, and the crossbow bolt punches straight through the top of the creature's head and down through its innards. The moster twitches, and then falls forward stiff-limbed.

The creatures stalk down Starguard, catching him between them. So intent are they on avoiding his mace, however, that only a single claw scratches Starguard doing barely any damage. But the poison under that rotted fingernail is enough to drop him where he stands. He collapses, all conscious control of his muscles lost, and lies wide-eyed on the ground. Mostly, he can see the stars; unable to move his head, while his thoughts churn into overdrive.

Seeing Starguard fall, Stormy jumps down from his stone, landing awkwardly and bringing his fingers together to form a fan of flame to burn burn **BURN** these foul creatures! So intent is he on causing damage that the flames flicker only weakly.

Starguard goes down the stars shining down overhead, and then a rotting undead face looking down. Unable to even close his eyes shut, he prays in his mind. OhWilthorwen&KenilthwenIcouldreallyreallyreallyuseyourhelpherepleaselookfavourablyuponyourservant...

Ash growls and leaps from his stone perch, landing roughly and charging forward, his sword aloft. The blade flashes red as it reflects Stormy's fleeting fire, striking down in two cuts that would be deadly to any mortal man. "Andreth, fire!"

Yuri wastes an arrow, startled by Starguard's sudden incapacitation. _Oh, no..._

Andreth calls out to Ash, "Just oil?", readying his sling in any case.

Ash yells back, "Alchemist's fire!" as he grits his teeth, trying to pull his sword back into a defensive posture as the creature turns...

Andreth hesitates no longer, drawing a smaller flask from his belt pouch and sending it flying... the vial smashes cleanly against the back of the undead abomination and the creature utters a howl of pain and rage as the alchemist's concoction bursts into roaring flame.

Tilara shakes her head, clearing it as the abomination moves away, taking its fearsome stench with it. She shoots past Ash but misses the creature - and then Ash is down, something about the creature's very touch paralyzing him.

Turning on his tormentor, the creature reaches out with claw and tooth and mighty stench, blood welling slowly along the gashes he's opened. But the real damage is not in the blood, or the gash, but in the poison under those nails. Within moments Ash, too, collapses to the ground, eyes open, brain active, but completely paralyzed.

Stormy, scared, fumbles out the potion of firebreath. He takes a sip, and before the potion burns out his tastebuds, spits the hot fiery concoction all over the creature. Alas, he hasn't practised enough and his spitting technique is, at best, weak, causing only minor flames to lick out and damage his dodging opponent.

Yuri jumps down from his stone, Defender sword in hand, and drives it into the belly of the creature that Andreth just doused in flame, while it's distracted. The sword tears a nasty wound through the creature's rotted guts.

Drawn to Yuri, the creatures circle around him, attacking from either side. Fangs, today, are ineffective, but those claws are relentless. Another member of the company slumps to the ground, eyes open, mind churning, muscles completely unresponsive.

Tilara shoots again, and again misses. She swears, and measures the distance between the standing stones. _I'm going to have to get closer to use spells._

The second creature has just regained his feet, when Stormy sucks down the second dose of the potion and breathes a sheet of flames over him. This time the flames catch, and the remaining oil reignites, causing the creature to crumble.

Andreth calls out, "Stormy! Get back up, dammit!" as he pulls one of the tanglefoot bags from his belt pouch and slings it at the remaining monstrosity...

Tilara breathes a sigh of relief as the second of the three goes down, but there is still one left. She fires, and again misses. _Now how can I not be hitting these clumsy things?_ She shakes her head and starts to rummage in her spell pouch for components.

The last of the creatures advances on Stormy, hands outstretched, fingers curved into claws, but for once it is the fangs that deal the damage. And somehow the poison has no effect on Stormy. This time. Still, blood drips down his cheek as he brings up his hands in a frantic attempt to burn the creature.

The creature ducks under the flames, taking a little damage but moving relentlessly for the close.

Andreth shakes his head as the tanglefoot bag falls short, and switches back to the crossbow, sending a bolt clattering against the stone beside the monster even as it swings at Stormy...

And the close comes, for Stormy, when a claw scratches his hand. The wound is, at best, superficial, but does enough damage nonetheless to leave Stormy paralyzed. Now he, too, slumps to the ground.

Tilara quickly digs out what she needs for spider climb and casts the spell. Once it's taken effect, she runs across the tops of the rocks, jumping the gaps easily since she can't slip. "Leave him alone, you vile creature!"

Andreth is about to call out to Tilara in dismay, then checks himself when he sees that she's clinging to the rocks as she jumps. His concern assuaged, he goes back to crossbow mode, firing down at the creature and winging it.

Tilara snarls as the creature moves away and tries to climb the standing stone, but easily jumps to the adjacent one and aims fire at it. "Burn, foul thing!"

Tilara pants as the last creature falls. "Keep a watch for more of them, Andreth. I'm going to check on them." She skitters down the side of the stone she's on, moving to check Stormy first. She's relieved that he's not badly hurt, and she props him up against the nearest stone as she moves off to check the others. "You'll be fine. It's just their touch that messes you up for a little while..."

Andreth nods to Tilara, and stays atop his rock for the moment, peering into the fetid darkness. Of course, it wouldn't be so fetid except for the three rotting monstrosities ten feet below him, but...

Tilara soon has all of the fallen propped up against the stone columns, and is working on cleaning the wounds out, starting with Starguard - who's both the most badly injured and the most knowledgeable about healing. "I told Stormy this would wear off soon. It will, right?" But of course the cleric can't answer right away...

Starguard begins moving first, twitching a little, eyes beginning to flutter. The cleric begins to make slight noises is his throat.

Yuri continues his patrol, singing a quiet song that comes unbidden to his mind. He notices dimly that his wounds from the previous battle soon fade to nothing.

Starguard gets up, stretching lightly, checking on the scratches picked up. A quick concentration deals with the worst of the wounds picked up by Ash, Stormy and himself. Turning, he looks for Yuri on patrol. "Hey! Yuri! Come back in for a moment so I can take a look at you?"

Tilara curls back up with her familiar at the base of one of the stones. _I hope Keorn's all right._

Andreth grimaces as he lugs the foul bodies of the company's erstwhile foes out of the camp. Downwind, thank you very much. He returns to his bedroll, trying to wipe his hands on the ground, and soon falls asleep in preparation for his own watch.

Ash is leaning up against a stone, one knee up, his greatsword sheathed and propped against one shoulder. He's breathing quietly, looking down at the ground, occupied by his thoughts even as his wounds are closed by divine providence.

Yuri comes back to Starguard. "I'm not hurt that badly, Brother."

Starguard quickly looks Yuri over, a frown darkening his brows. "I think you understate the case, Yuri. You're not hurt at all." He hmms. "Did you take one of the healing potions? You scratches are gone."

Yuri lowers his voice. "I didn't take a potion. I was just... singing... I'm not sure I want to talk about it yet."

Starguard raises an eyebrow. "Singing?" he asks, curious. Shaking his head, he drops it. "I'd be very interested in listening when you want to talk. And you might want to offer a prayer Limera's way..." He leaves it at that, heading off to sleep before his watch.

The battle weary veterans of many a ... fight ... settle down to rest. First watch passes uneventfully, and Ash and Yuri are eventually relieved by Andreth and Tilara. In turn, these two keep careful watch.

Tilara paces as the watch continues, then looks up and makes her way over to Andreth. "D'you hear that?" she whispers. "Chanting, or something?"

Andreth nods, cocking an ear. "Yeah... we oughta see what it is. Wake someone up first?"

Andreth moves to Ash's bedroll and nudges him awake. Once Ash appears conscious enough to listen, he explains. "Tilara 'n I heard some chantin'. I'm gonna go and see what it is. If I don't come back _real_ quick, wake up the others 'n come carefully. Okay?"

Ash grumbles quietly, listens blearily, and mutters something that might end with ".. both arms right off." Nevertheless he staggers to his feet, taking up position behind one of the stones with his imposing weapon kept close.

Andreth quietly moves through the undergrowth, taking every care to avoid making noise. Mirra pads along quietly beside him. _Noisy human_, she editorializes, but she does stay out from underneath his feet. Beyon the first low hill Andreth finds nothing, but as he reaches the crest of the second low hill, a familiar stench assails his nostrils, even as he hears the chanting becoming louder.

Peering over the crest, Andreth sees a small campfire, barely giving out any light; but in what little light there is he sees two more of those creatures the party has fought, flanking a man who has a hand on each of their shoulders and is whispering some sort of chant.

Andreth's brow furrows intensely, and he heads back to the party's camp, making certain to be as quiet as possible...

Tilara frowns. _Can you stay and watch for a while, Mirra?_

_Watch. Wait._ The cat sends back a very affirmative answer, and settles in, under a bush, watching carefully.

Andreth emerges back into the firelight of the camp. "Two more of them stinking things, and some guy chanting with his hands on their shoulders," he recounts grimly.

Ash nods slowly. "So. Either we take 'em out, or we wait for Keorn and take 'em out, or we wait for Keorn and sneak away."

_No more chanting_, reports Mirra.

Andreth hms. "Those stinking ones 're dangerous if we let 'em get close. Mebbe we can lure 'em here where we're standin' on the stones?"

Ash nods slowly, finally coming awake. "Yeah. Climb the stones, take up the ropes and be prepared.."

_They're coming!_ The cat pulls back from underneath the bushes, and runs back to the camp. She makes for Tilara, and nuzzles her ankle. _This way._

Andreth nods. "Wake the others... I'll go get their attention," he says, fingering one of the thunderstone pouches... and then the cat streaks into the camp. "Too late!" he yells, shaking Starguard awake and scrambling toward a stone.

Tilara nods. _Is the human coming, or just the dead things?_

Ash sighs. "Everyone awake," he directs, "We gotta move now. Climb the ropes and haul them up behind you."

_All!_ The cat looks unperturbed, though. She remembers the last combat.

Ash also retrieves his crossbow and ammunition from Stormy. "Stay ready, kid," he advises. "You'll get this back if I need to wade in."

Starguard blinks, waking slowly, but quickly gets the idea, scrambling up onto the nearest rock.

Stormy nods, climbing the stone next to Andreth's, and pulling up the rope behind him.

Tilara says, "The caster is with them. Let's be on the lookout for him."

The company seems much more prepared this time. Each moves swiftly to their best position: Andreth, to retrieve his alchemical goods; Ash, to deploy the two mystic lanterns at the base of the stones, and bringing the third light-source with him around his wrist as he ascends the rope; Tilara and Stormy, to points where their talents can be put to best use; and so on.

A stench begins to drift closer on the breeze. A very familiar stench. Soon, two figures move into the light. They pause, at the very edge of the light, and then separate, moving to stay as far outside the light as possible. But this doesn't help them much. They remain excellent targets.

"Concentrate fire on the one moving east," directs Ash.

Tilara fires at the ghast that has turned to the east, but misses.

Stormy takes advantage of the lull to chant under his breath. Soon his skin feels thicker, without hampering his movement in any way.

Ash fires one of the party's remaining shock bolts, but to little effect. Already he's preparing to reload, crouched low on the stone, kneeling for cover.

Starguard fires right after Ash, kneeling to steady his aim. The preparation works, as the bolt streaks right through the heart of the creature, tearing out something essential. The creature falls, unmoving.

Yuri sees that Starguard has felled the enemy to the east, and fires on the other creature; the distance makes the shot difficult, and it goes wide.

Andreth drops a lead shot into the pouch of his sling and swings it round once... twice... and the sling slips from his hand and plummets toward the ground beneath the stone, the shot rolling away into the darkness.

Unaware of the missing pebble, the second ghast moves around to the west and north, trying to slide out of the light as much as possible. He doesn't seem to be aware of his partner's demise.

Stormy, lacking a crossbow, or anything resembling a range weapon, waits on his stone, the rope in hand so it can't be pulled down.

Tilara fires again as the hideous thing lurches forward, and this time the bolt sinks into the monster.

Ash prepares his second (and last) enchanted bolt, letting it fly just above the gap between two of the standing stones. It strikes the distant fiend, and a faint echo of the skies' spectacular light-show arcs over the creature.

Waving his hands around casually, the caster chants under her breath. As the chant proceeds, Andreth feels the stone beneath his feet become slick and slippery.

Andreth's feet go flying out from under him, and he falls off the stone - reaching out a hand to the side of the stone as he falls, he manages to get his feet under him for the landing. Dusting himself off, he pulls a thunderstone from his belt pouch...

Starguard turns and fires at the figure in the darkness, the intelligent enemy more dangerous. His bolt flies true, but seems to hit something and deflect. "He's got a shield of some sort!" he yells.

Andreth scrambles toward his sling, picking it up and sending the thunderstone flying toward the chanting mage. An incredibly loud bang resonates around the stone circle, but the enemy seems to shake it off within a heartbeat.

Tilara sighs. _Ah, well... this looks like as good a time as any to use this._ She opens one of the scrolls she's been carrying and starts to read the runes that generate a lightning bolt...

The energies gather as Tilara reads the scroll, and then the bolt lashes out, a blue-white flare across the darkness. It strikes the mage squarely, apparently taking him by surprise. There is little left when the light fades.

Ash aims and fires with sure deliberation, planting another crossbow bolt into the undead fiend's shoulder and through to the stone.

Yuri, distracted by the incineration of the enemy mage, scores only a glancing hit on the remaining monster. Even so, it collapses in a messy, stinking heap.

Ash smiles, and hops down off the stone with the assistance of the rope. As the rest of the party gathers to assess itself and what's left of the supernatural assailants and their unknown master, he recruits Starguard and together with Mirra's guidance, begin the wary trek back to the spot where the chanting was first heard, intent on gathering clues (and anything else they might find).

The camp looks minimally used. A small fire, left to go out, and a single backpack, containing only a blanket and a single book. Apparently, the mage was carrying most of his belongings with him.

After searching the five ghastly corpses, the party comes away with a handful of parchment fragments, all illegible. They do however find one oddity. A shining dagger, with a small tiger eye in the pommel.

Whistling, Ash returns to the camp with Starguard at his side, hefting a backpack and smiling. "Perhaps we can get some sleep now," he comments.

Yuri says, "Oh, dear. I hope this isn't from the Cat clan."

Andreth looks over Yuri's shoulder. "What've you g- oh, bloody hell. Yuri, tell me this ain't one of the Changer daggers."

Tilara says, "Keorn would know, at least. I hope it isn't."

Yuri says, "And I really hope that even if it is, it's just an imitation of the dagger used in the courtship, and not the real thing. There's any number of scenarios that could put it here and I don't like any of them."

Yuri says, "We'll wait for Keorn. It won't matter much until we get moving tomorrow. At least the mage didn't disappear in a column of fire lit from a feather."

Stormy moves closer, sticking to Mirra. He still looks a little green about the gills, and not particularly thrilled with this campsite.

Tilara says, "Ghasts are just animated bodies. If one of them was originally the Cat clan's delegate..."

Yuri shakes his head. "I don't want to speculate until we know more. Too many of the scenarios are too ugly."

The remainder of this watch, and the following one, pass without incidence. The sun rises after the Mother Star goes down, and all is once more right with the world. Chirping birds, fluffy clouds, and Keorn bounding into camp shortly after Starguard has started breakfast.
