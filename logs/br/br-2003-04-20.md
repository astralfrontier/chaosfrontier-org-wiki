After a fascinating night, in which the Company learned to appreciate stones for their intrinsic standing-ness, Keorn bounds into camp. "Good morning, Starguard! What's for breakfast? And what's that horrible smell?"

Starguard says, "Five ghasts and omelette mess. Not necessarily in that order. Also, we have a dagger you may want to look at."

Ash shakes his head. "The ghasts are the smell. The omelette's the breakfast."

Tilara says, "Don't forget the wizard briquettes." Mirra just wrinkles her nose and tries to stay upwind.

Keorn looks around slowly, and notices Yuri, who's still slumped over sleeping. "Well, I'm glad you made it through safe and sound. What's this about a dagger?"

Ash presents the acquired knife, looking somewhat worried.

Keorn looks at the dagger. "Hmmm. Looks like ... acceptable workmanship." He picks it up, after pulling on a glove. "No obvious maker's mark. Inferior tiger's eye gem." He tests it on a hair. "Amazingly sharp though." He shakes his head. "It's a dagger, Ash."

Ash actually smiles, for the first time since yesterday. "Well, I feel better then. These --" he points off in the direction of the buried remains of the ghasts "-- carried it. We were.. worried."

Starguard lets out a sigh. "Thank the stars. I was rather hoping it wasn't the cat's dagger, or even one of the others."

Keorn smiles. "No; these would not carry the dagger. Not for long." He looks around. "The weather's looking a lot better now."

Starguard says, "On the other side of the coin, may we ask where you were? We could have used a hand when stinking undead assailed our position."

Tilara snorts. "Technically, they _didn't_ carry it long... but it's good to know, nonetheless. Just offhand, what color would the gem in the Elk's dagger be?"

Keorn raises an eyebrow at Starguard. "I needed to confer with my brothers. The Suitors go to court Samaela. We also go as ambassadors. My brothers had messages that I will be passing along to the clan keepers." He turns to smile at Tilara. "The elk's stone is green, for the grass they eat."

Tilara twitches an eyebrow and glances at the others. "Berina."

Starguard says, "Alright, then. Good reason." He sighs at Tilara's comment. "Probably, but let's hope not. And breakfast is ready, and I suspect we'll need it."

Tilara says, "Can I have that for a moment, Ash? I want to check if it's more than just an ordinary dagger." She murmurs a cantrip as she takes it.

Tilara hmmms, holding up the blade and turning it back and forth as the spell works. "There is a bit of magic on it, but not a lot. Probably... yes. Abjuration magic. Protective spell, most likely. Anyone mind if I carry this for now?"

Starguard shakes his head in the negative and then swallows a mouthful of eggs and veggies. "Not at all, Tilara. I don't think anyone else uses daggers as much as you do, right?"

Stormy shakes his head, and looks over at the still comatose Yuri. "Nope. Say ... Brother Starguard?"

Starguard says, "Yes, Stormy? What is it?"

Stormy points at Yuri. "He hasn't woken up. At all."

Starguard blinks, and quickly goes over to Yuri's side. "Yuri? Yuri?" Worried, he checks over Yuri again, closer than last night. "Oh, stars. The surface wounds closed, with the poison still in him. He's going to be out for...however long it takes his system to clear the poison."

"Then say a prayer for him," suggests Ash. "But we'll have to move. If he's safe to move, Brother, let's get to work on how to lug him."

Starguard says, "He'll be fine. Just limp. We'll have to tie him to his horse, but he'll be alright."

Keorn nods, watching Yuri get deposited on the horse. Then he mounts his own horse, and leads the party down the hill. Within an hour or so the nature of the ground has changed, and Keorn reins in his horse. "Follow behind me now; a misstep will cost us dearly."

Tilara says, "Swamps?" She swings her horse in line behind his.

The ground is covered in small pools of stagnant water, with small grassy hillocks rising here and there. Occasionally, a frog jumps out of one pool, into the next.

As the company penetrates deeper into the swamp, a miasmic odor rises from the pools. At first only the scent assaults you, but by mid day yellowish vapours rise from the growing pools as the scents grow stronger.

Tilara reins up as her horse shies at something. "What is that vapor, Keorn? Doesn't look like any proper kind of mist."

Starguard says, "Sulphur. It'll make you naseous and dizzy if you breath it too long. Can we hurry through this part?"

Keorn looks around. "Sulphur is as good an explanation as any. After all, what do you know of the Ancestors?"

Tilara says, "Less than we'd like. Anything we should know about them right at this moment?"

Keorn looks around. "Perhaps." He pitches his voice so that the entire company can hear him as he presses on. "Once, this was a fertile plain, with a river running up the middle, and lake up north. A big farming community, under the leadership of Agla's grandsons." He looks around. "Luriel killed them, in a fit of rage; bringing forth storm and lightning, drowning them and burning them and changing the landscape forever."

"Then what happened?" asks Ash. "They just roll over and die?"

Tilara says, "Doesn't sound likely..."

Keorn looks around. "Those that lived ... fled. Those that died ... haunted the lands." He notices the vapours getting thicker, and nudges his horse forward a little faster. "The clankeepers claim that these souls refuse Ungfallen's haven until Luriel's demise."

"Long wait," remarks Ash sullenly.

Starguard hmms. "I'm one to believe the stories of the Gods as much as as the next man, but that is sulphur. Perhaps that's what sulphur is. The rotting spirits of the undead."

Keorn shrugs. "Something surely is rotten in the state of Lurin. Has been since the Prince came into power." He reins his horse in when he reaches a small island, barely large enough to hold a ring of twelve standing stones. One three of the stones, large hawks sit, watching the company.

Starguard's eyes watch the hawks as he follows into the ring at the tail end of the party. "Friends of yours, Keorn?" he asks, nodding to the hawks.

One of the hawks begins to shimmer.

Tilara notes the shimmer and watches closely. _Ah-hah! We've never seen them do this before. I wonder how .. it... eeeew. That's **nasty**_.

The shape grows, the hawk spreading its wings. As everyone watches in nauseous fascination, a man in a cloak appears where the hawk was, standing on the stone. The cloak flaring behind him, the man jumps lightly, landing on the ground in front of the horses. "Keorn."

Keorn nods, briefly. "Illath." He waves at the Company. "The White Company; ambassadors of the Emperor."

Starguard nods. "Illath," he acknowledges neutrally.

The other hawks watch the group quietly.

Tilara sketches a horseback bow. "Charmed."

Ash waits patiently, studying Keorn and the hawks, and flashes back to the Foramen village.

Keorn watches Illath intently, one hand on hip - not actually touching his sword, but certainly close - while the other holds both reins. Illath, in contrast stands grinning sardonically. Time passes.

Ash sighs a little. "Keorn. We're gonna be there for the Honeymoon at this rate."

Yuri says, "Starguard... what... if we have guests?"

Tilara says, "Guests?" She looks around, back the way they've come.

Starguard blinks, looking over at Yuri. "Guests?" he asks, seekingly.

Yuri shifts in his saddle against his bonds... _I must have had a very good time._

Yuri says, "Would you be so good as to untie me if we're presenting ourselves as diplomats? This isn't convenient."

Tilara says, "You feeling up to it, Yuri? The ghasts did a number on you. Wouldn't look too good to fall out of your saddle, either."

Starguard nods, and quickly moves over to undo Yuri's bonds. "Feeling alright, then?"

Yuri leans down and murmurs to Starguard. "Who are these guys? Friends? What's with the medallions they're wearing?"

Starguard turns to look. Medallions? He notices the brown circles around the necks of the hawks. "I don't know, Yuri. I'm hoping Keorn will tell us," he whispers back.

Tilara looks more closely at the hawks. "Medallions...? Ah, those medallions," she murmurs.

Ash waits patiently, watching this apparently pointless standoff. Whatever is happening, though, has some purpose. It just hasn't been made clear yet.

Keorn looks back at Ash. "We'll be there for the honeymoon, no fear." He grins, slowly and widely, and licks his lips. "The Maiden will be ... pleased." He looks at Illath. "You bring warning or a wedding gift?"

Illath shrugs. "Both. Or neither." His arm sweeps out. "Sleep in a High place tonight, under the sky. Sleep under the rock, and keep your weapons nigh. Sleep through the dawn as the Brother burns. Sleep through the night, while the Ancestor learns." He smiles lopsidedly at Keorn.

Tilara glances to her companions, and murmurs, "Contradictory advice..."

Keorn glares at Illath, then looks around. There are four obvious paths leading away from the standing stones, including the one the company used to reach this ring. He looks back at the company, one brow raised.

Yuri smirks. "Sounds like something from this book we've been reading."

Starguard says, "It does at that. And, I would appreciate not to choose the 'Brother burns' one, for the record."

"Not contradictory," says Ash. "Alternatives. We do one thing, we face its consequences. We do another, we face its instead."

Yuri says, "Nor I. I opt for 'sleep through the night'. That one sounds the most like getting some real rest."

Tilara says, "Which Ancestor would this be?"

Illath smiles at Tilara. "We were hoping, ma'am, that you could tell us. Clankeeper sent us."

Ash tries a different tack. "Why is it we who should answer?" he asks. "Not to challenge your question, only to understand what came before it."

Yuri says, "Clankeeper sent you to Keorn, or to 'us'?"

Illath looks at Ash. "Because we can fly. We make camp tonight ... far from here." He looks around. "There are four places in the swamp where you can camp; the Clankeeper sends you your choices."

Starguard says, "I'd say under the sky or a rock, depending on the weather. Under the rock, we can set an ambush."

Yuri says, "Why don't you try writing it into the book you have, Starguard, and see what it says?"

Tilara looks enlightened. "Ah. More riddles, then. The rock and the Brother don't sound favorable. Ancestor, or high places?"

Ash grits his teeth. "I'll do what I have to for SOMEONE to learn SOMETHING," he grates. "Even if it's this unidentified Ancestor."

Starguard nods, and reaches for the book, opening it, and pauses. "We need to choose before we ask for directions."

Yuri says, "I think I agree with Ash. I'd still like to see what comes out of the book."

Yuri says, "So... Illath... does that medallion you wear, signify your office as emissary of Clankeeper?"

Starguard frowns. "I think we should sleep up high..."

Illath nods, waving at Keorn. "No matter how badly he wishes to cry feud, I'm under Clankeeper Oath now." He grins, and begins to shimmer lightly.

Starguard says, "Brother may not mean me. There is also Brother Sun. Sleeping now."

Tilara says, "After the undead, sleeping during the day sounds a bit more attractive. And high keeps us away from the fumes."

Yuri nudges Starguard. "We should consult the book, and then make a decision. You know all the mystical lore, you figure out what to write."

Starguard puts the book back. "I don't think we need the book. The obvious descision is to sleep high and early, as we're not ambushed, and the Ancestor learns nothing. We want to learn things, not our competition."

Yuri says, "I don't think that the Ancestor is our enemy, but I don't have a problem with that otherwise. Any opposed?"

Illath jumps lightly into the air his cloak flaring into wings that sweep down, propelling him once more to the top of the stones.

Tilara shakes her head. "Sounds logical."

Starguard says, "Keorn? Andreth? Ash?"

Andreth blinks at Yuri. "Didn't Keorn say that the ancestors was the unquiet dead in this place?"

Ash shrugs. "Let's go, and see what happens. At the very worst I'll kick the doors open in Ungfallen's hall by tomorrow night, and track down his family for an accounting."

Yuri says, "One thing about undead, Andreth. We don't have to negotiate with them."

Tilara gives Ash an odd look. "Cheerful thought..."

Yuri says, "OK. It sounds like we're sleeping tonight, and we want the high road. Keorn? Which way?"

Keorn shrugs, and looks at the paths. "Each of these will lead us on." He looks at the three hawks, who watch curiously. "I have no preference; the Clankeepers know how fond I am of their trite, silly little riddles."

Starguard says, "Which is the highest elevation, Keorn? We'll take that one."

Keorn looks up at the hawks, one brow raised in silent enquiry. The hawks look back, before Illath takes to the sky, flying down the central path. Keorn looks back at the company. "If we believe the Clankeepers ... This will be the road to the high places."

Starguard says, "Well, lead on. Seems as good a way as any, I guess."

Yuri says, "Our greatest danger in a high place is either falling from it, or a hawk attack. So it would be a bad idea to make enemies of any Hawks we meet."

Keorn spurs his horse on, nudging it down the path, before looking over his shoulder at Yuri and smiling sardonically. After he turns back to face forward, the words "Blessed are the peace makers ..." floats back.

Starguard finishes the quote. "...for they shall take arrows from both sides."

Andreth chuckles. "All the more needin' a blessin', then. Let's ride," he says, urging his horse forward.

The path leads straight through the swamp, logs forming impromptu bridges where pools expand over the pathway. In time the vapours fade away again, slowly reducing to a foul stench. Overhead, the cawing of ravens occasionally disturbs the silence.

As the day comes to a close the path becomes rockier, and begins to lead up a spur of rock, out of the swamp. The road is narrow, barely wide enough for the horses to make their way along it, and a single stumble would be enough to requires Brother Starguard's most heroic measures. Stormy, for one, is turning distinctly green.

Starguard notices. "Eyes on the mane, Stormy. Let the horse follow the one in front of you."

Yuri says, "Perhaps we should dismount and lead the horses by the reins?"

Stormy nods, closing his eyes and holding on to his pommel with both hands.

Tilara says, "A bit too late for that now. If we get a wide point, we can."

Eventually the path widens up onto a wide promontory. A steep cliff descends several hundred feet. Keorn pulls up his horse, and looks over the cliff's edge, hand on pommel. Then he looks back at the company, and growls.

Tilara says, "What?"

Starguard says, "I'd say this is on high. Shall we sleep early, so we can be ready if we get attacked?"

Yuri says, "We can sleep here, but... how do we get down?"

Starguard turns to Keorn. "There is a way to continue after this?"

Keorn looks out over the cliffside. "I don't know." He looks around, eyes narrowed. "There had better be ..."

Starguard says, "Let's camp here. At least there's only one way to guard."

The promontory has only the one obvious exit; the path you followed as you came up it.

Yuri says, "Two. That way - ", he motions down the path, "And that way." He motions at the sky.

Yuri searches the limited area carefully, looking for other paths, or hidden features.

The rock is blown clean by the breezes that have begun to pick up, washed clean by the rain that the clouds overhead are beginning to presage. Slowly, Yuri prowls around the promontory, examining every dip, and every scratch. Nothing seems promising. Meanwhile, Keorn continues looking out over the distance, anger in his very stance.

Ash sighs, approaching Keorn. "If we're off course, we're off course. If to make it in time we need to leave, we will leave. Otherwise we may as well camp here - we're unlikely to be ambushed too badly. So tell us if we have sufficient time."

Keorn looks at Ash. "We have enough time. The Clankeepers have a ... a foul sense of humour. They want the wolf to fly, the hawk to swim, the elk to hunt ..." He looks back over the cliff. "Tomorrow ... we will fly."

Ash shrugs. "More riddles, Keorn? We've had a belly full of them. But as you wish." He turns, returning to try and make himself useful in setting up camp.

Keorn swings himself off his horse, and paces out the perimeter. Then he returns to where he started, and stands motionless looking out over the cliff.

Which is odd, since there isn't much to look at. The promontory extends over a large open area; below green shades of grass and bushes meld and blend.
