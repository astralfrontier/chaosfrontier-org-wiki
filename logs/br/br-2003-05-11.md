# Birthright 2003-05-11

The map is barely more than a long narrow scrap of scraped hide. Starguard looks at it in dismay, for what few symbols it contains are difficult to read between the leather's nap. He spreads it out carefully, holding it at top and bottom, and looks at the land spread out in front of him. After some consideration, he decides that the long narrow line must be the spring; it winds its way to the bottom of the scroll.

Along the spring's meandering path there are four large marks; each seem to denote some kind of symbol. The first symbol is either a cross, or perhaps a dagger. The second is a stylized web. The third is, or appears to be, some kind of bull. And the fourth consists of twelve dots, arranged in two circles; the inner circle with four, the outer with eight.

Starguard sighs. "Well, follow the stream, it seems. Shouldn't be hard to follow. Just four little surprises on the way."

After Illath carries a worried looking Stormy away, the sky begins to lighten. Perhaps an hour, and then the rest of the Company can set out. Above, two hawks fly in great circles. And either they're closer than they seem, or the Hawks, keeping an eye on the Company.

Ash nods solemnly. "It would be impossible to scour the area in the time allotted, I imagine.. so the four points represent points of primary interest."

As the Mother Star's glow washes over the scroll, Starguard's hands begin to tingle for a moment. Then a second, thinner line appears, inked, it would seem, out of pure light. It follows the stream past the first dagger, but then turns aside.

Tilara says, "Also to see how we do, I suspect. Let's see what... whoa. That's different. Much clearer. A shortcut? "

Starguard says, "Marching orders are in, folks. And I'm not sure it matters. Though the stars are meddling, possibly. Sun's up, let's go."

Andreth nods, squaring his shoulders. "No time to waste."

Following the spring is generally pretty straightforward. The ground is a little marshy, and the banks aren't easily defined, but by and large there's usually enough high ground to permit passage. After an hour's steady march, Starguard calls a halt. "The dagger or cross marks the spot at this turn."

Looking around, the party sees the hawks, still circling overhead, but no other creatures. The ground, around here, is less flat, with several large hillocks.

Tilara looks around carefully, conferring with Mirra.

Mirra carefully sniffs the air. _No one here._ She stalks over to one of the hummocks, tail extended straight in the air, and then sits down to wash her paw.

Tilara says, "Well, neither of us sees anything. Is this where the line said to turn?"

Starguard huhs. "Maybe it's just the point of turning, but you'd think we'd do something here. And yes. It is."

Tilara says, "So. Shall we turn?"

Ash observes, "It may also be that this is the safest point at which to turn, or at least the proper one for some reason. We should proceed."

Starguard says, "You alright, Andreth? It could be a dagger and not a cross..."

Andreth hmms, and pulls out the dagger to examine it.

The dagger is glowing slightly; or more accurately, a single rune just below the hilt is shining brightly.

Andreth raises his eyebrows. "Hm. Well, there's a thing." He shows his companions - hilt first, of course. "What d'ya make of this?"

Tilara says, "It wasn't doing that before, was it?"

Mirra finishes washing her paw, and then turns around in her spot, almost as though she was padding the grass down to make a bed, as a dog might.

Tilara glances at her familiar. "What?"

Mirra looks at Tilara. _Tired. Sleepy. Want catnap._ Her whiskers tremble a little, as though she were laughing at her mistress.

Looking concerned, Starguard concentrates on the hummock, invoking the aids of his patrons to detect the presence of evil. Within moments, the entire hummock begins to glow brightly.

Starguard says, "Mirra. Come here, Mirra. Come off the hill..."

Tilara says, "Not here, Mirra. You can sleep while I carry you."

Mirra stands up, stretches, and ambles back to Tilara's side. _Tired._

Ash watches with caution, keeping his weapon casually in hand. Something's happening, though he's not quite sure what yet. Whatever it is, one instinct rings clear as a bell. "We should leave this place," he says.

Tilara scoops up her familiar. "Sleep in my arms, then. We can't wait around here, and something's not quite right about that hummock. Let's be away."

Still holding the dagger out, so that he can see the length of the blade, Andreth moves towards one of the hummocks. As he moves closer, nothing seems to happen. But when he turns to watch Tilara scooping up her familiar, the dagger turns with him and ends up pointing at the hummock Mirra chose to make a bed. And a second rune appears. This one Starguard immediately recognizes; it is used both to depict danger and warning.

Starguard says, "Back! Don't go near that one!"

Andreth backs away slowly, watching the hummock. "I think Ash's right. Let's get out of here."

"Starguard, lead the way," suggests Ash. "Andreth, stay ready behind us, and I'll be right ahead of you."

Starguard says, "Sounds like a heck of an idea to me. Keep that dagger out. If that second rune glows again, we don't go that way."

Andreth pauses at that. "Maybe I oughta go in front, then, so I can point the dagger where we're goin'?"

Having reversed their marching order, the party sets out to follow the glowing line on the map. Starguard pauses a moment, concerned that the light seems to be dimming.

Andreth hears the sounds of marching ahead slow down and stop, and he comes up in front again. "What's the hold-up?"

Starguard says, "The light is dimming. They're not going to let us get by here without dealing with the test."

Starguard borrows Ash, prinking him so that he can overlay the fading line with a thin line of blood. "Not my favourite ink..."

Ash shrugs, holding his reddened fingertip steadily. "Not the first time this stuff has been used to help us, but hopefully the last," he comments with a weak smile.

Tilara says, "Indeed. So, shall we go see what this test is about?"

Ash nods.

Starguard says, "Reminds me of the last time at the other barrows. Perhaps I should offer a prayer for the dead."

The party pauses for a moment, torn between moving on and searching the hummocks more carefully. Finally, they decide to devote a few moments to the endeavour. Examining the ground carefully, it soon becomes obvious to Starguard that these are ancient barrows, the rocks guarding their entranceways overgrown by shallow vegetation. Andreth, too, looks around, noticing that the dagger's warning rune glows brightly only nearthe one hummock.

Starguard says, "Wanna bet the line glows again if we open that one up?"

Tilara sighs. "Let's give it a shot."

Andreth eyes the overgrown entranceway. "I bet we'll be too busy to look atta map right after we open it up."

Starguard says, "However, anyone want to put a copper on the line moving?"

Tilara says, "We might have to go underground to find him, perhaps. The turn doesn't follow the path because it's on the wrong level?"

Starguard says, "One way to find out. Andreth? Need a little magical help?"

While everyone debates, Ash moves closer to the rock that's likely marking the entrance. In only a few moments, the overgrowth is ripped away, leaving behind a rock that is heavy, but can be lifted and put aside. With Andreth's help, there should be no problem.

Once the two young men have shifted the rock out of the way, they see a small dark corridor leading downwards. After all these centuries, barrows design hasn't changed a whit.

Starguard readies, focusing, grasping his holy symbol to turn back the undead. "Perhaps I should lead, this time?"

Bravely holding their weapons at the ready, the party descends into the darkness. A moment's fumbling, and in the light of one of the continual torches the party sees a large round room. Empty. There are two doors, one to the left, and one to the right. Both are made of old rotten wood, and can barely be called doors at all.

Starguard hmms. "Andreth? What does the dagger say?" he asks, taking a look at the map...

Andreth aims the dagger at each door in turn.

The dagger holds two runes. Both glow brightly, but the danger glows more brightly at the left door.

Tilara says, "Does the map say anything?"

Starguard says, "Nothing. Let's pick the lesser of two evils, then..."

Starguard says, "Andreth? Would you care to 'knock'?"

A single knock can be heard when Andreth's hand descends on the rightmost door. And then a faint whoosh of air, as the wood splinters into piles of sawdust.

Starguard says, "You just can't get workmanship like that anymore..."

Beyond the remains of the door a small chamber once held two beds, on which the inanimate remains of corpses lie. In the center of the chamber a small chest stands. Unlike everything else, the chest is not covered in dust, and is actually shining, as though it were recently polished.

Andreth frowns skeptically, as the dagger fails to respond to the chest. Experimentally, he tries pointing it at the two corpses as well...

Ash walks forward, passing by Andreth and the others. He stays ready to strike should present itself as a threat, but for the most part he's interested in a close-up look at the chest.

The chest sits there, unresponsively. See how glossy it is; is it not well polished? There is no obvious lock on the lid, and in fact there are no bands or locks at all. There is a small carving in the center of the lid, suggesting a rose.

Standing back, Ash attempts to open the chest with his sword. He can easily place the swordtip so that it should lever the lid up. But the lid refuses to budge.

Trying the dagger has no better result. There's nothing holding the lid in place, except perhaps bloodymindedness, but nonetheless the lift is not coming up.

Andreth taps on the carved rose. "Wonder what this means..."

Ash says, "The other room may yield additional clues."

Starguard says, "Alright. Shall we?"

Tilara says, "This is not getting us anywhere. Maybe the line will like the other side better."

Moving to the other door, Andreth again knocks. More sawdust results. Beyond, there's a faint glowing light.

Ash walks forward again, willing enough to take a chance to discover what lies in this room.

As Andreth looks into the little room beyond, he notices the light is slowly moving.

Even as Andreth notices the light, it rushes at him. It turns out to be a glowing light of electricity, landing on him and shocking him mercilessly.

Andreth roars in pain, and swings a fist wildly at the glowing light, then rushes back into the doorway to the chest room... "Dammit, what _is_ that thing?"

Ash moves quickly, striking when he's in range, and fleetly stepping away as soon as it becomes clear that his trio of sword-swings had little effect.

Starguard comes out of his shock, to ask for the Stars help with this thing. As he finishes, a faint glow settles on the party. "Retreat to the chest?"

Tilara concentrates on something she's been practicing. The language is different, and the gestures as well - this time the fire streaks out to a longer range and stays focused rather than spreading out all over the place.

Turning in the main room, the glowing light slowly moves towards Ash, finally settling close enough to him for a small streak of lightning to reach out and shock him.

Andreth grimaces as his companion is struck by the thing's attack, and decides that the chest must have _something_ to do with it. Rushing back in, he hauls the chest off the floor and advances on the creature with it...

Ash backs away quickly, sword at the ready. He moves to stand beside Andreth, preparing himself for whatever may come next. Though sounding a retreat tempts him, he's not quite ready to fold yet.

Starguard continues to cast, trying to douse or short out the ball...water appears in mid-air, before dropping down in a solid mass on the creature. It sparks...

... and Tilara fires another pair of fire-bolts into the thing.

Faced with the choice of targets, the glowing ball, now sparking more rapidly as water sluices off it onto the floor below, advances on Andreth, catching him in the shoulder and showering sparks all over him.

"Retreat! And keep the chest," advises Ash, as he steps and sidesteps, keeping well away from the sparking fury.

Andreth sucks in a sharp breath as the electricity courses through him, shocking him clear to the bone. "Dammit, we can't do anything about _this_!" he cries as he retreats from the burrow, keeping the chest with him.

Starguard guards the way, letting the party retreat. "Stupid thing!" he cries, backing to the first step and out of the water before striking it one last time.

Starguard slips on the slick step, landing on his rear as the lightning ball advances. "Get the bloody rock ready!"

Tilara pauses as Starguard slips, trying to cover him. She glares and launches another pair of energy bolts at the creature. "This is not the time to sit around."

Advancing on the sitting paladin, the ball of light glows again, sparks catching and earthing themselves through the Brother's chainmail.

Starguard scrambles up the steps, getting back above ground. "Right! Close it up!"

Together, Ash and Andreth heave at the former covering of the barrow's sole door, both very much interested in restoring it to its former place.

Even as the door slams into place, sparks escape around its edges. But only sparks; the creature seems firmly trapped inside.

Andreth breathes a sigh of relief, and looks up at Starguard. "Did the line come back on the map?"

Tilara says, "So, we need the chest. For some reason. Let's march, shall we?"

Starguard says, "We have a line. Let's get going, and I'll heal you up a little."

After the healing is shared out by Starguard, the company resumes their trek. Now cutting cross country, they pass through a countryside that is changing from grassy plain to woods, with outcroppings of rock here and there. Finally they reach two standing stones, with a cross lintel.

Tilara says, "This is the one with the web, correct?"

Starguard says, "Huh. What does the dagger say, Andreth?"

Andreth hmms, and draws the dagger again, aiming the blade along the stone arch.

The dagger remains completely quiescent.

Holding the chest in front of him, Andreth pauses. The stones look almost like a doorway. But with no wall, and no obvious passage beyond, it's unclear why they're here. Straightening his shoulders, he steps forward through between the stones, and disappears from view.

Starguard says, "Andreth!" Starguard's eyes widen and he charges forward to the arch...

Within moments, Starguard, too, has disappeared from view.

Ash shrugs and actually strolls toward the arch. "May as well get this over w--"

Tilara says, "Oh, for... Starguard!" She mutters imprecations under her breath, then sighs as Ash walks in, as well. "It's just the two of us, Mirra. Shall we follow them, or go home?"

Mirra looks at her mistress. _Home? Milk? Mice?_

Tilara picks up her familiar. "No, not yet. We have to rescue Stormy first. I just hope this will help..." She ties a rope to a nearby stone, ties the other end around her waist, and steps through.

As each of the company members step through the doorway, they find themselves in a dark place, where the silence is absolutely deafening. Tilara feels the rope tugging on her waist, but for now it seems to be holding.

Ash oofs silently as he thumps into a solid somethingorother, like a human or at least something of that approximate shape... He feels around gingerly.

Andreth grunts, and spins round, grabbing at something that's bumped into him.

Ash begins tapping with his fingers on the solid ahead of him - once, twice, once, twice, then stops.

Tilara turns around, one hand on the rope, and slowly follows it back. Aftr a few steps she is once more standing in sunlight. Above her, a giant hawk sits on the crosswise stone, watching her thoughtfully.

Tilara nods to the hawk. "Interesting. So what are we supposed to find in there?" She lights a torch and double checks her rope while waiting to see if there's an answer - though she doesn't really expect one. "I assume you're not supposed to interfere."

Andreth pauses in his attempt to grapple, the tapping code alerting him that whatever it is doesn't have hostlie intentions. He rests his hand on the other person's shoulder, returning the taps in the same order, and then begins to slowly swivel around his companion, reaching out with his free hand for anything else.

The hawk looks at Tilara. Then it looks at the rope. It considers her, again, before returning to immobility.

Ash grins to himself, then begins visualizing Starguard, and with quiet steps he directs his insensate body forward.

His hand stretches out ahead of him, as Ash takes one small step. And then another. Behind him, Andreth follows, hand on his shoulder. Ash's hand touches something. Something solid. And cold. Like a ring. A whole web of rings.

Ash thumps his hand down once, then twice in quick succession, repeating the pattern again, and takes hold of what must be the shoulder of his companion.

Tilara steps back inside, hoping that the torch will work.

Starguard recognizes patterned taps, and follows, grabbing shoulder, reaching out with his free hand.

As Tilara steps through the stones, the torch goes out. Again, she's trapped in darkness.

Andreth follows along, since the person who's shoulder he's holding - Ash, he decides, judging from the metal beneath his hand - seems to know where he's going. Which is more than Andreth does.

Tilara swears silently and stuffs the dead torch into her belt. _I know you're in here somewhere, guys. I **think** I know that._ She walks ahead slowly, her hands out to search for whatever she can find.

Tilara turns, startled at a touch on her shoulder. _How'd they get behind me?_ She reaches out with her left hand, her right going for her dagger just in case. Mirra rides on her pack.

Ash taps once, then twice, then once, then twice, atop the hand he feels. This pattern seems to have been successful in the past, and once he's sure the grip stays steady on him, he begins the next part of this..

Tilara nods to herself. _Pattern. Clever..._ She repeats the pattern back at whoever it is, slips her dagger back into its sheath, and moves her hand to the other person's shoulder, tracing along his back to see if they've found anyone else.

After a few moments spent counting one another's presence using touch, everyone once more follows Ash, like goslings following their mother, as he steps forward carefully. Time passes, and he moves forward, feeling now a cool breeze on his face. But suddenly Tilara is tugged by the rope around her waist, and her grip on his shoulder tightens.

Ash waits patiently, trusting that Tilara (he thinks) will resolve whatever the matter is.

Tilara traces down again, moving her hand to his, and then bringing it to the rope at her waist. She then puts his hand on her shoulder and starts undoing it. When she's done, she taps his hand and gives him the gentlest push forward again.

Moving forward again, Tilara feels the rope slide away behind her. Trusting to Ash, she follows him, as he in turn follows the breeze on his face, finally reaching a narrow slit in the wall. Only two feet wide, he will have to turn sideways to pass through it. But the breeze comes from here, and seems warmer now.

Ash turns as needed, carefully connecting hands together one by one to form a chain of his friends. That done, he sidles through...

As he slides through the slit, he realizes it's longer than he thought at first, stretching into a very narrow passage. His hand behind him, holding onto a friend, he moves as far as his outstretched arm will allow, but the passage continues on.

Behind him, the human chain begins to form, sliding into the passage, allowing him to continue moving. Time passes unmarked, as he shuffles sideways. And then, all of a sudden, light floods into his eyes, and the passage comes to an end in a large cavern, heated by a burning fire in the centre. Luckily the fire is at least forty feet away; the flames easily spring two or three times his own height. Even so, the heat quickly becomes stifling.

Ash walks forward, moving far enough away from the \`exit' to make room for his friends; as he waits, he turns to inspect the nature of what the party just passed through.

Tilara has to slip her pack off to make it through the narrowest section, but she emerges behind Ash. "I do hope that was what we needed to do. What's the map look like, Starguard?"

As his friends emerge, Ash sees them come out of a narrow fissure, that looks almost natural, were it not for the very flat base. Looking around, he notes that this cavern they are in is large enough that even by the fire's generous light he can't see the ceiling. Or the far walls.

Andreth says, "Okay, so maybe goin' through that arch weren't such a good idea. Where _are_ we?" He looks around. "Don't tell me we're back in Jurdah's domain or somethin'..."

Starguard looks at the map curiously. The previous glowing line is completely gone. Now there's a single large image, outlined in line art, consisting of a stylized flame between two standing stones and under a lintel. He pauses, seeking out evil, and finding none, while the image tugs at his memories.

Starguard says, "This looks... The Lady of the Hearth and the Keeper of the Book of Stories. This is Limera's place."

Andreth looks around. "Dammit. If we weren't in a hurry to get Stormy back..." He glances at the map, puzzled by what it's doing now. "Mebbe there's another way out?"

Tilara says, "You're kidding." She looks around, registering things. "No, you're not kidding. It _does_ look like that, doesn't it?"

Ash rubs the back of his head, as he sheathes his sword. "Well.... is Limera likely to answer questions, or be helpful?" he asks. Pragmatic to the end.

Starguard says, "There's nothing. This looks like a second test. Search the room? Andreth? Stick with me? You've got a story in the book already..."

Andreth nods to Starguard.

As the company surveys the cavern, they is notice almost immediately that they came out behind the fire. Moving out beyond it is no challenge, barring the heat which is a trifle unsettling. Beyond, the cavern is huge. There is no better way to describe it. Flashes of movement between the stalactites suggest the Company is not alone, but nobody approaches you directly.

Andreth turns to Ash. "How'd you find your way here, anyway?"

Ash shrugs helplessly and smiles. "When your friends vanish into the air, and you go blind and dumb following them, all you got left to steer with is.." And with that he taps the side of his head with one finger.

Tilara says, "But is this where we needed to go? This is.. interesting, but we're on a time limit."

Ash nods. "Hey, the next place I aimed for was the door out. This is what the Black Void gave me in answer."

The walls are marked with crevices, many too narrow, or too low, for the party to travel through. Unless they're willing to slither on their bellies, and strip down to nudity. At the far end, now moving more closely into focus, are two large stone constructions. squinting carefully suggests that these might be thrones, but if so, the beings who sit on them would have to be giants.

Starguard says, "I can search for Stormy if you want, but I don't think we're in range yet..."

Tilara says, "I'd doubt it. We're only just past the second challenge, if we're even past it."

Andreth says, "Mebbe we'd just need better aim. If we go back 'n you think o' somethin' more specific..."

Ash shrugs a little, pointing ahead. "The path seems to lead forward. The real 'tests' seem to be hether or not we're willing to keep walking it."

Starguard says, "For the sake of Stormy? Wherever we need to go."

Andreth nods. "We owe him. And everyone else." He looks at the "thrones". "Now that's somethin' else..."

Moving closer takes longer than at first expected. This cavern looks as small as it does only because there are no clear relative markers to rely upon when estimating size. But eventually the thrones come closer. Leaning against the base of one is a gaunt man, his eyes sunken deep in his cheeks.

A hood covers his hair, a cloak hangs from his shoulders, showing hints of finely polished platemail. A large sword, larger even than Ash's, dangles lightly from his right hand, as he looks quietly at the party.

Starguard says, "Hail. Who might you be?"

As the firstborn syllables roll elegantly off Starguard's lips, the man straightens, sword held cautiously to the side. "Greetings, strangers. I do not recognize you."

"Nor us you," Starguard rejoins. "But we are the White Company, and represent the Wolf. You are?"

"This is my hall. My sister wife keeps the Hearth." His eyes narrow for a moment. "The Wolf? Which wolf?"

Starguard says, "The Wolf, of the Changers. We have a test today to search for our friend, Stormy, to prevent his death at nightfall." He blinks as his mind processes. "You...you are Ungfallen?!?"

The man sweeps a sardonic bow. "I have been known by that name, yes." He looks the party over. "But your presence intrigues me. None have entered by that entrance since the twins first created it."

Tilara's eyes snap back to Starguard and the stranger as that name comes through the gibberish of the language she doesn't know. She opens her mouth, then shuts it again.

Starguard says, "The twins? Wilthorwen and Kenilthwen, I wager? I serve them. Their guidance led us to the gate. And a chest."

Andreth's own eyes widen at the name, as well. His hands tremble with the effort of maintaining his composure. Certainly he says nothing.

The man smiles, wryly. "Yes." He looks Starguard over. "Yes. You have the look of them. The sincerity." His lips a moment. "As for the chest that the young man is carrying ...", he pauses, "The young man I missed meeting before. That young man; the chest he carries contains three keys. I recommend finding a way to open it before you find the boy."

Starguard says, "Erm... This is Ungfallen, for the way. And our way here was through a gate made by Kenilthwen and Wilthorwen. And the chest contains three keys, and we should find a way to open it before we find Stormy."

Andreth nods mutely, still wide-eyed. He swallows. "I... don't suppose you'd ask him how we might open it?" Hope springs eternal, after all.

Starguard turns back to Ungfallen. "Could you tell us the way out, or anything to help us? We would be grateful for any help..."

Tilara blinks, and murmurs, "I was so hoping he'd said 'no' when you asked him that..."

The man smiles. "For those who have not yet died ... there are many ways out of here." His eyes crinkle, laugh lines sweeping out to the sides. Odd, you would expect the Lord of the Dead to be more somber. He tilts his head. "But there are paths to the cage where your boy lies, insensate. And there are keys for every lock."

Starguard smiles. "Nice to know. Could you point us towards the right way, please? If you would?"

The man nods. "Certes. There's a lass here, who is eager to see the boy. She'll be delighted to escort you." A shade swoops down from the ceiling high above, vibrating as it swoops down to explore each member of the company in turn. The shade looks feminine, and young, and innocent, as it swoops around in glee. "I release her from the hall for one week. Her name is Anne."

Starguard blinks. "We have a guide, it appears. Anne." He turns back to bow deeply to Ungfallen. "Thank you for you help. Is there anything we can do for you?"

"Guard Anne well. If she is hurt ... again ... I shall not be pleased." The man smiles. "And do not let the boy come to me too early; that would displease young Anne mightily."
