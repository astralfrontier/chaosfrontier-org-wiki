# Birthright 2003-06-08

When last we saw the intrepid party, Starguard was meeting a man whom his patients rarely wished to meet. As they conversed in the ancient tongue, the rest of the party was left to watch, and ponder, and jump slightly as a shade swooped down to inspect each of the four remaining Company members carefully.

Finally, she hung in the air in front of Starguard, her form wispy, reminiscent of a small but highly mobile cloud in the sky. Still, she hung, soundless, as the Lord of the Hall released her, for a short time. Then she began to float along the side of the hall ...

As the company follows, she begins to speed up, always staying ahead of the group. If she were of the canine variety, one might almost expect her to be a setter, following the scent of her prey, quivering in eagerness. But she is only a small cloud, an evanescent wisp of dewy air. She traverses perhaps ahlf the length of the hall, before slipping into a passage abrely wide enough for Starguard and Ash, in their armour, to traverse.

Tilara glances at the shade Anne, and back at Starguard and Ungfallen. "Shall we go?"

Soon, the passage widens into a smaller version of the Hall you've left behind. Along every wall, at every height, small nooks lead to small chambers. As the first living Company member steps into the hall, shades flutter down from every nook, surrounding the party members. At first the fluttering is polite, the wisps staying at a distance, but as the party follows Anne down the hall, the wisps begin to press closer, giving off strong feelings of envy, and lust, and occasionally ...

... occasionally, you can smell the scent, the taint, of blood, and the lust for death.

The wisps are now pressing close enough that they are no longer transparent. Their touch is clammy, and cold, and the feelings of envy are intensifying. Measuring the length of the hall, it will take but a few more minutes to reach the large arch at the far end.

"Sleep, and be grateful you don't bear the burdens of the living," murmurs Ash to the air as he walks. "Many outside envy the peace you possess now."

Andreth's nose twitches, but he puts his head down and presses on, following our guide-shade. "Seems some of them brought their burdens with them. It's hard to let go, take it from me."

Starguard says, "Perhaps we should hurry." Starguard pushes forward a little faster into the swirling shades.

The shades twitch, still pressing in front of the party, but allowing them to pass. Still, they cluster at the archway as the party presses on, following Anne, who has gained some distance and is waiting for them.

Tilara says, "Agreed." She picks up her pace as well, while preparing a light spell just in case things get much worse.

Beyond the archway, the passage becomes a mere cleft in the rock, though one wide enough for the party to pass through easily. Still Anne floats ahead, urging the party on. But all come to a sudden stop when she floats serenely over a chasm, perhaps twenty feet or so wide, and certainly deep enough that the light doesn't immediately register.

Tilara says, "Lovely... I might be able to cross it, but how deep does it go? And what's at the bottom?"

Andreth peers down the chasm. "Ooops. Did we go the wrong way?" He glances up at Anne's shade. "Is this the way we gotta go?"

Starguard frowns, looking down as he holds his wooden symbol, praying quietly for the guidance of the Stars in the time ahead.

The shade hangs beyond the far edge, trembling ...

Ash looks about. "Down is not the way to go. How to get across is our problem, not Anne's," he says firmly.

As Starguard prays, he feels two distinct sensations. One of fear, unending unceasing fear, disorienting him. The other feels like rope slipping through his gauntlets, burning through his gauntlets, scarring his palms ...

Andreth nods to Ash. "Then let's get to it. You still got some rope? We left Tilara's behind when we came in, I guess..."

Starguard shivers for a moment, then shakes his head. "I...I'm not sure that rope is such a good idea." He looks at his hands, examining them for marks.

Ash has some rope around his waist, in fact, looped into a tight circle, with one of the party's grappling hooks on one end. He holds out the loose end for a moment, then puts it back, watching Starguard curiously.

Tilara nods. "I was concerned about anchoring in that gate, but I had to leave it behind. We all had rope, though."

Starguard says, "I'm a little worried that we may be encouraged to slip. Perhaps tying ourself to any rope might be a good idea."

Andreth peers at Starguard. "Why not? You got a better idea?" he says. He steps closer to the abyss, straining his eyes for any hidden pathways.

Starguard says, "No, I don't. But we need to be careful."

Tilara says, "Always a good idea. I'm still going to go with my spell, just to play it safe."

Andreth nods. "Well, we probably better start by snaggin' somethin' on the other side. It's either that or lower someone inta the pit 'n hope they can jump across ferther down."

Tilara looks down, gingerly. "Somehow, the bottoms of deep chasms in Ungfallen's Halls do not sound like a friendly sort of thing."

Starguard says, "No, not really."

Ash nods, and thinks for a moment. "Tilara, please take the hook here and secure it on the other side. Andreth and Starguard will follow, one way or another, and I'll come last."

Tilara sits down and pulls her boots off, then readies her climbing spell. "I'm off. Wish me luck."

After eyeing the chasm carefully, and taking a source of light with her, Tilara slowly clambers down the chasm's side. Her speed is not hampered by a lack of skill, but rather by an innate sense of caution. A sense she does not regret in the slightest when she's about fifty or so feet down. Here the chasm is less than two feet wide. From below, she suddenly hears this heartrending wailing, this screeching, this unhuman sound, pulled from vocal chords that cannot exist, surely, in Nature?

Tilara pauses at the hideous sounds, but was expecting something like this and steels herself to ignore it. The chasm is narrow enough now, so she reaches across to the other side and makes her way up as quickly as she can.

As Tilara scrambles up the wall a thin trail of liquid flies up into the air behind her, exploding in a ball of light.

As the light fades, a large amorphous blob oozes out of the chasm, slowly climbing after Tilara's rapidly escaping form.

Starguard shields his eyes against the bright light., and then sees the glowing ooze begin to chase Tilara. "Look out!" he cries, loosing a crossbow bolt harmlessly.

Ash blinks, but rather than scrambling around uselessly, he does something he's imagined, but never actually tried. Eyes shut, he breathes a few times, letting the effect of the light's glaring curse leave gradually as he enters the state of combative readiness he's so accustomed to. This time, it's a gradual transition, not the heart-pounding explosion of prior fights. He opens his eyes, slowly...

Reaching for the top as quickly as she can, hoping to leave the wailing as far behind her as possible, Tilara races for the passage where Anne still hangs, waiting anxiously. In moments, the grappling hook is attached to a handy outcropping of rock.

Andreth steps up beside Starguard and looses a crossbow bolt as well, which clatters on the far wall of the chasm. As he's hauling the string back, the creature's unearthly wailing assaults his ears, and he grits his teeth against the sound.

Ash looks about, but the wailing is too much. He starts looking behind him, suddenly and unaccountably fearful of the spectral denizens of the prior caverns.

Meanwhile, the blob, below, resumes climbing slowly and steadily, pseudopods growing out, reaching for podholds, and then being reabsorbed as the main body ponderously rises, following after Tilara.

Starguard, worried, quickly loads and fires again, managing to hit the target this time. The bolt sinks into the blob...and is absorbed. The wailing noise changes tone, however.

Tilara gets to the top of the chasm and glances back at the shrieking thing. _Only two spells left. I wonder if it's flammable?_ She readies Burning Hands and waits for the blob to crawl into range.

Andreth finishes re-winding his crossbow, and eyes the rope now secured across the chasm for a moment... then shakes his head - not unless Tilara needs help when the thing gets across. For now, he just raises the crossbow and fires once more.

The crossbow bolt whistles through the air and clatters once again harmlessly on the cliff face.

Another joins it, and Ash curses. "I think I can finally see at least," the warrior grunts ruefully.

The creature steadily crawls upwards stretching for Tilara. Only a few more seconds, and she'll be within its range. A few seconds that will allow Tilara to lay down a withering fire.

Tilara gauges the distance and flames the blob when it gets into range. It moves surprisingly quickly, though, and flattens against the chasm wall, avoiding the worst of the damage. _Wonderful._

Starguard's crossbow bolt comes winging in a moment later, well high, the stopping of the blob throwing off Starguard's aim.

Andreth looks at the rope, then looks down at the chasm and shakes his head. Too far to fall. Instead, he fires across the chasm once more, missing cleanly.

Ash fires his crossbow again, this time scoring a clean hit. "Tilara, grab the rope and swing!" he shouts, even as one hand rises up in time to block the unnatural flare the creature emits.

As the blob stretches forward, psuedopods fire out, reaching for Tilara's juicy flesh, resolving into slavering fanged mouths. Three of the mouths score long scratches across her flesh, but none manage to hold.

Tilara blinks, blinded by the flashes the creature produces, and fends off its attacks with Mirra's help. She stumbles back up the corridor, trying to get away from it, trying to clear her streaming eyes.

Starguard says, "Tilara!" cries Starguard, pausing a moment to make sure that she can stumble free. He fires a third shot, well wide, far from Tilara's fleeing form, but also the blob.

Andreth calls out for Tilara again, but she doesn't seem to be able to hear him over the wailing. "Lemme borrow your rope, Ash!" he calls, snagging the cord from his comrade-in-arms, and ties one end around his waist, then throws the other end over the rope and ties that to his waist as well.

Ash lines up his crossbow with the creature, steely gaze level and unperturbed as he sends another bolt deep into the bulk of the gibbering monster.

The wailing weakens, fading sometimes almost to a sob, but still the blob advances towards Tilara. Coincidentally moving away from these nasty crossbow bolt shooting people ...

Tilara stops as Mirra reacts to a foul scent in the direction she's moving. She mutters imprecations under her breath as she unlimbers the half-spear she's carrying across her back. _I just hope I'm far enough away that my vision clears up before it gets here..._

Starguard fires another shot, but misses. "We need to get over there!"

As Tilara blindly unlimbers her halfspear, paused in the corridor, wailing before her, and a foul smell now erupting from behind her. She hears the whoosh of darts, soaring through the air. Moreover, she feels them, too, as two of them land in her back and thigh, the one in her thigh digging painfully deeply.

Andreth nods to Starguard. "I'm on it," he says, tossing him the free end of his rope and grasping the other with both hands, starting out hand-over-hand across the chasm.

Andreth gets a few feet out into the chasm when one of his hands slips. "Dammit!" he calls out, and for a few tense moments he dangles by one hand before he can haul himself back up.

Another crossbow sails past Andreth, spending itself on unyielding rock, and the sound of Ash cursing can be heard.

Starguard quickly ties off the rope, anchoring it, and reloads another crossbow bolt. Another flare illuminates the cavern, blinding those who haven't shielded their eyes.

Tilara swears as her vision clears and she realizes she's being herded between two sets of opponents. "If this is the best route, Anne, I'd really hate to see the worst..." She charges the creature from the chasm, stabbing at it with her half-spear, but goes up the side of the tunnel at the last moment, trying to make it past and rejoin her compatriots as they cross the chasm themselves. "Go fight with the other thing, you miserable pile of slop."

A single pseudopod shoots out, mouth forming, spittle flying, and catches on Tilara's ankle. No matter how she kicks, it stays stuck, stretching a little but keeping her withing range nonetheless.

More darts fly out of the darkness, most landing short, or skittering against the ceiling, but several more manage to sink into her thigh, as Tilara rapidly begins to resemble a pincushion.

Andreth grits his teeth, and swings his body forward. This time, his grip is sure, and he's across the chasm and safely on the other side. Dropping to his feet, he gets to work unfixing the rope around his waist.

Ash drops prone, again blinded.

With Tilara caught above it, the pseudopods form quickly, and hungrily, shooting up to anchor on her feet and calves. She kicks, more feebly now, and while she kicks the one mouth loose, two others attach firmly while a third opens up another gash. But she's beginning to weaken, hoping against hope that the others will come to her rescue soon.

Tilara slashes at the sucking tentacles with her spear, trying to knock them loose from her legs. She succeeds with one, though pulling it loose causes still more damage. "I could really use some help here, boys."

Starguard quickly grabs the rope, beginning his way across, but slips! With a yell he plummets...but is caught by the safety rope. "Dammit!" Quickly, he moves to climb back up and get across.

Down the passage, there's a certain amount of jostling, and cheering, and then another full flight of darts come flying. Tilara, trapped now by the mouths, makes a splendid target. And she makes a beautiful hedgehog, now that she has close to a double handful of darts sticking out all over.

Andreth cries out, "Tilara!" as she goes down, and rushes up to her side. Pulling a potion from his belt, he forces it between her lips, and breathes a sigh of relief as she coughs and staggers back to consciousness. A few darts clatter to the floor as the magically healing flesh forces them out.

Fumblingly, the blind bravo manages to secure the remaining rope to himself, and serenaded by the sounds of his falling comrade, the raging fight on the other side, and accompanied by doubts as to the fate of those he cannot see and can barely hear over the gibbering, he moves as fast as fate permits.

Tilara shakes her head as oblivion descends and recedes again. "Thanks. What _are_ those things?"

As Andreth succours Tilara with a much needed healing potion, the blob sees its chances, mouths flailinig out and attaching to both the monkish lad and the bleeding lass. He manages to kick the one mouth free, but now two mouths have settled on her ankles, sucking her blood lustily, making her feel weaker ...

Tilara is momentarily revived by the potion, her more blatant wounds healing a bit, but as the thing starts to drain her blood, she passes out again, slumping against the wall.

Starguard climbs back up the rope and quickly scurries across the rope. Armed and ready, her prepares to charge the monsters attacking Tilara and Andreth.

Andreth glares at the amorphous monster. "Let go of her, you mound of flesh!" he yells, swinging his fists at it, but as another fusillade of darts fly from the tunnel mouth, two of them tear into him and spoil his aim.

The warrior stumbles out of the pit, a look of raging fire burning furiously in his eyes as he rushes forward. He darts to the side, his greatsword singing as it leaves its sheath, and as he finishes the spin the momentum buries the blade to the hilt inside the shuddering bulk of the mouther. Ash squats down, taking cover behind the body of the beast, hand still on his sword. A grim smile of satisfaction shows on his lips.

Tilara moans as the paladin brings her out of her stupor. "I think I'm getting a hangover. Thanks, Starguard. There's some kind of spike-throwing critters down that way. Be careful." She struggles back to her feet after the others move on, and takes a moment to reassure her worried familiar.

In the distance, there's more jostling, as the indistinct shapes become more visible. Small, ugly little creatures, each armed with a handful of darts. Darts that are thrown at the party, before they scurry backwards, trying to escape the light ... Darts that are suddenly far less effective, one clattering off Starguard's armour, and another just scraping Ash.

Andreth jinks forward as the hairy forms come into view, and raises his crossbow and fires, dropping one with a crossbow bolt right between the eyes.

Ash moves quickly as well, backing his friend up with the strength of his blade at the ready.

Seeing the two men advance, the creatures let loose their darts of war, and then retreat at full speed ... waiting for the two men to come to them. Possibly. There's a lot of shouting and whispering going on.

Tilara stretches as Starguard's healing spell works on her wounds. "That's a good deal better. Thank you." She's still rather battered, and her skin is pale with blood loss, but she sounds much stronger now. "Let's go help the others if they need it, shall we?" She loads her crossbow and then stands to follow the fighters.

Starguard nods. "I don't think they'll need much, but yes."

Seeing his friend about to run ahead and into further potential danger, Ash says the only word he can think of, the quickest one that will convey the importance of staying together and focusing on what matters most now: "Stormy, Andreth."

Andreth takes one step forward, but when Ash's shout reaches his ears, he nods and stops to take the time to load his crossbow and fire again, one of the foes falling over in mid-retreat.

As the party comes back together, standing over the corpse of the amorphouse blob, Anne dips closer. The cloud is turning almost grey with anxiety, dipping and twisting and trying to entice people to _hurry up_.

Ash follows Anne's apparent wishes as soon as his crossbow and rope is back in his possession, and his eyes continually take in the state of his comrades.

Starguard makes sure that Tilara is good to walk on her own before checking Andreth's state.

Tilara says, "Next time, Ash, _you_ eat the spider. This vanguard stuff is bad for my health."

Ash shrugs. "I've ate worse.."

Andreth says, "Suits me fine. Let's get goin'. Anne's in a hurry, 'n so are we."

Tilara nods. "Enough time has been wasted. Let's move out."

Leading the way, floating disdainfully over the short, misformed corpses that lie further down the hallway, with crossbow bolts sticking out and easily recoverable, Anne leads the party down this passage, turning into another, dropping down a steep slide, and finally reaching an open cave, which looks out onto a meadow.

A very familiar looking meadow, with a small, misshapen hut in its center.

Andreth stares at the hut. "Well, I'll be..." He turns to Starguard. "What's the map say?"

Starguard pulls out the map. "Huh. There's no more glowing line... Perhaps we should get back to the river?"

Anne hangs in the air above you, hovering.

Ash points down at the hut. "We can take a moment to ask. If Ungfallen knew about what's inside the chest, perhaps we may learn more here."

Andreth nods. "Certainly worth trying. If it's the wrong way, I'm sure Anne will tell us..." he says, looking up at the shade.

The shade, hearing Andreth's words, hovers, tilting slightly towards the hut ... then slowly moving a little towards the hut, then hovering again.

Tilara nods. "She wants us to go that way. Let's go."

The hut is a short walk away, and soon the party is once more facing its door, currently hanging halfopen. Inside, the old man is spooning stew into his mouth when he notices he has company. He turns around, smiling, and invites everyone to enter his humble abode, and perhaps join him in an early lunch.

Ash shakes his head. "We have a chest, with a rose and three keys inside. Unopenable by us at the moment. We seek information," he explains in crisp, spare tones.

The man nods, waving Ash inside. "Show me the key?" He smiles, briefly, at Anne, where she hovers by the window, and whistles three notes at her.

Ash says, "If there is a key we lack the wit to discern it."

"Aaaaah." A long drawn out sigh, before the man smiles. "I knew Anne would only visit me in an emergency ..." He waves a hand. "Show me the chest, then, and we will see the keys."

Andreth brings forth the chest and sets it down before the old man.

The man examines the chest, carefully looking at it, before picking it up and turning it over. He looks longest at the rose, and then puts the chest back down again. "Andreth ..." He looks at the young scarred monk. "Sing your life, Andreth."

Andreth nods, glancing briefly at Anne, then closing his eyes. He's never really been much of a singer, but this tune comes naturally to him, as well it might, and soon the notes issue from his throat...

As the notes issue forth, something begins to shift inside the chest. The rose, on top, shimmers, becoming a rose bud, that bursts into bloom, and then slowly wilts, leaves falling into the woodwork. As the last single growl dies away, the rose returns to its original state, as the lid opens a bare inch.

Tilara says, "Fascinating..." She peers into the opening. "Can we get them out this way?"

Andreth rubs his throat - the scar throbbing at the memory of the last note, and he openes his eyes again. "What in wonder..." He reaches to open the chest. "We had the key all along..."

Starguard says, "Only one way to find out. Andreth? I think you should have the honor..."

Andreth nods to Starguard, and opens the lid...

Ash gestures to the chest. "Why did that work?" he asks of the old man.

Inside the box, once the lid is lifted, lie three cylindrical objects. Scroll cases, it seems. The man touches each scroll case with his gnarled finger. "These are your keys. They are the keys to Stormy's life. And there is a fourth scroll, that you cannot see. It is the key to his death. It exists, and does not exist." The man smiles, wistfully. "Now, you must decipher the keys." He points at each scroll in turn, moving left to right. "Stormy's birth. Stormy's childhood. Stormy's future." Anne flies into the hut, hovering over the chest, almost touching the first scroll.

The man turns to Ash. "These roses are tended by the shades of those who were; they bloom when they hear a life's song. As the life fades, the lock releases, allowing the chest to be opened. Most such chests are opened only once ..." He looks at Andreth. "Since I can only play each song once, and most people do not survive to learn their own song." He smiles. "You have been gifted, child, with a great gift. One you can carry with you for a long time."

Tilara says, "So... how do we use them? I suppose we'll know when the time comes."

Starguard says, "Let's puzzle over these on the path. We can move and think at the same time, I trust."

The man smiles at Tilara. "When you solve the puzzle, you will find the scroll. The three scrolls, in turn, carry the three portions of the spell that will unlock the boy's cage. But once the fourth scroll appears ... the others fade away."

Andreth nods. "Let's find the path again and get going." He glances at Anne, and the scroll cases. "Do you hold the key to his birth, then?" he asks.

Tilara nods. "We use these scrolls before dusk, then."

The cloud hovers closer, as Anne almost reaches out to touch the scroll case, before shrinking back and moving closer to the old man.

Tilara says, "Anne? Can you lead us further on, or do we use the first scroll now?"

Anne moves closer to the door, hovering uncertainly.

Andreth says, "I guess we should be going, then." He turns to the old man once more, and bows deeply. "I thank you again for the gift."

The man smiles. "I thank you for your song. Sing it well and wisely, lad."
