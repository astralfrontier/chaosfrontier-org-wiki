# Birthright 2003-07-07

Four wanderers - three men, one woman. Eight feet leave their frail human imprint in the grassy earth beneath, treading the trail of inexorable destiny that has been laid out before them. The dozen standing stones beyond stand impersonally, awaiting their coming. Will those who follow look down and see the footprints they leave behind? These thoughts occupy the attention of the burly man who's walking point.

Running circles around the adults, young Anstar frequently darts off to investigate new and interesting phenomena. Leaves. A butterfly. A fox's footprint. It's as though, with his release from Ferg's bondage, the child has found an inner child who is releasing all his fears at once.

Starguard, on the other hand, is more concerned about the relative health of the physical. Andreth shows deep wounds and bruises, some of the worst. Sighing, Starguard uses his strongest healing spell to knit Andreth's body back together.

Tilara still looks a little pale from her encounter with the gibberer, but is not otherwise badly hurt. She stays toward the center of the group, watching young Anstar fondly.

As the standing stones approach, it becomes obvious that while, on first examination form a simple circle, the distances are uneven, so that there are four distinct groupings in the stone. In the center, four more stones stand, but these are only a few feet tall, and carry four altars arranged in a square.

Starguard steps back to examine Ash and Tilara in turn. No lasting injuries, though the poison has had some effect on Tilara, he notes. With a sigh, he uses the last of his most powerful healing spells on himself. Feeling much better, his eyes focus on the stones ahead, worrying.

Ash draws close, hand resting lightly on his sword. Without fear he walks through the boundary of the stones, eyes casting about for whatever mysterious nemesis may await the party here.

Strangely enough, there's an utter lack of obvious nemesis, although as Ash looks more closely he sees dried blood spotting two of the altars, and evidence of digging at the base of several of the standing stones.

"Starguard," says the warrior, conversationally enough. "Any ideas?"

Meanwhile, Andreth pulls out the Wolf dagger, cautiously directing it about the circle. At first, there is no reaction, but then he feels a slight tug, pulling him towards one of the trios of stones.

Andreth calls out to his companions. "'ere! It's pulling me toward this 'un. Guess this is the Wolf's part o' the circle, or somethin'."

Starguard hmms. "Sounds as good an idea as any. There first, then fan out to look?"

Tilara says, "Might as well. Any idea what we're looking for?"

These stones look old, and worn. Far more worn than that earlier circle. There are no obvious marks of the Changer clans, although shadows and light suggest that there were marks, once upon a time. The altars completely lack marks, with the exception of a single gully down the center of each; a gully that drains into a slightly wider channel, and from there into a basin below.

Anstar slowly steps up to the circle of Stones, and then pauses. "Andreth?" He sounds uncertain. "Why are we ... did you see the footprint, over here?"

Andreth blinks at Anstar, then comes over to look. "Footprint? Where, lad?"

Starguard says, "Let me see, lad? Show it to me."

Pointing out the footprint, which leads straight into the circle, Anstar squats down. "It's a weird foot, too. Half human, here in the toes. But the heel is all wrong." Anstar points out the heel, which looks almost like a cloven hoof.

Starguard says, "Well, they appear to be coming, not going. Which means they're either here, there's tracks leading out somewhere, or they left magically."

Tilara says, "So, follow them."

Andreth scratches his head, puzzling over the strange track. "Follow 'em which way, though, in or out?"

Starguard says, "Out, I would think."

Ash whistles tunelessly as he ambles in a circle around the area while wiser heads make what they can of the few clues available. He stays ready for a physical confrontation, one he's prepared for based on past experience with the trials, and personal inclination.

Casting around inside the circle for more tracks, Starguard and Anstar find two more. One near one of the used altars, and then a second heading out beyond the ring. Anstar runs ahead, and finds two more, one of them covered in blood. "They left, Andreth. They're ... "

Starguard says, "After the blood was spilt, though."

Andreth rubs his chin. "Wounded..." he murmurs. "What kinda thing makes tracks like this, anyway? Part human, 'n part somethin' with split hoofs?" He sighs. "We s'posed to try to follow 'em, I wonder?" Remembering himself, he smiles down at Anstar. "Good eye, by th'way, lad."

Nodding, Anstar pokes at the print. "Yep. Lot of blood though." He looks up at Andreth, and Starguard, and bites his lip. "And see where it depresses? He was carrying something heavy, now."

Tilara says, "So... we follow?"

Smiling at Andreth's praise, Anstar grins. "Pa taught me lots. We used to track the foxes to the henhouse, and then leave surprises for the farmer."

Starguard says, "I don't know what else we can do here. And he might have been carrying someone else..."

Andreth glances at the altar, then shakes his head. "I think we gotta do _somethin'_ else here, but I dunno what."

Starguard hmms. "This is the end of the map, though..."

Tilara says, "We still need to do something to work out the third scroll."

Andreth nods. "Stormy's future, they said. But what d'we haveta do with that?"

Starguard hmms. "There's no blood on the wolf altar. And the elk, who has passed, left blood."

Andreth nods to Starguard, and stands before the clean altar, the dagger still tugging subtly at him. "I guess we're s'posed ta sacrifice somethin' here. But what? And who to?" He looks up at Starguard. "Who's the father o' the Changers again? Far Seer, weren't it?"

Tilara says, "Sounds right. But what would we be supposed to sacrifice? We're not Changers ourselves, after all. I vote we just follow the tracks."

As Andreth stands in front of the altar, the knife begins to glow. Anstar, fascinated, creeps closer, standing on the other side of the altar, his senses straining as he concentrates on the knife to the exclusion of everything else. A soft gasp, and then he crumples to the ground.

Starguard blinks and rushes forward. "What happened?" he cries, moving forward to kneel beside young Anstar.

Tilara moves nearly as fast as Starguard. "What --" She bites off expletives, watching the cleric work.

Starguard checks over the lad. "He's alright, just fainted."

Tilara is visibly relieved. "Thank the Gods. What do we do now?"

"Follow the tracks," suggests Ash in answer, coming forward as well. His sword is now drawn, for even a fainting spell can hint of something deeper, in his late experience.

Andreth starts in alarm. "Anstar!" he cries out, holding the dagger still. As Starguard declares him merely fainted, he breathes out softly. "'e was lookin' at the dagger when 'e went down..." says the monk, staring at the blade, his expression hardening. "No..." he murmurs, "they can't mean..."

Starguard says, "This is the last place on the map. Eight around four..."

Andreth's fingers tighten around the knife hilt, and he looks up at Ash, his eyes glinting. "We follow the tracks. We haveta _know_ what's expected o' us."

Tilara nods. "Aye. Let's follow the tracks."

Starguard says, "I don't think we should. We need to be here..."

Andreth whirls round to glare at Starguard. "Be here ta do what? Sacrifice Anstar?" His voice cracks as he voices the foreboding that plauges his mind. "No. I ain't doin' that, not after what I promised 'im." He nods in the direction of the elk-tracks. "They bled somethin' out. Maybe they're one o' the other groups o' Chosen. What'd they use?"

Starguard says, "Drops, Andreth. Not to death. And they carry something heavy out. Like a fainted body."

Andreth stares at Starguard, his eyes wide, breathing heavily. Then he glances at the stained altars, seeing that the cleric's words are true. Finally he breathes a deep sigh. "Mebbe you're right..."

Tilara looks troubled. "What happens if we're not, though?"

Andreth glances at Anstar's fallen form, then eyes the Wolf dagger suspiciously. "But... even a few drops... it's still blood. It's still us cuttin' 'im and leaving 'is blood 'ere... and why?" He looks up at Tilara. "Til, ain't blood kinda a _really_ powerful thing in magic?"

Tilara frowns. "It can be, yes. Depends on the magic, but..."

Starguard nods to Andreth. "Yes it is...but...we're running low on time..."

Tilara says, "I'd still like to try it without hurting him, first. See if we can follow the tracks."

Andreth nods to the sorceress. "An' who knows what magic this altar's for? Not me." He glances out of the circle again. "Just a little way. Shouldn't take us long to see 'ow far the tracks go."

Starguard says, "Alright. Let's go then. But let's hurry."

In Starguard's arms, young Anstar begins to stir ... His eyes open, and he looks up, before fainting again.

Cradling the boy in his arms, Starguard bends over the tracks for a moment more, before straightening up. He gives the lad to Andreth, to free up his movements, and moves forward briskly, his eyes scvanning the grassy ground. Here a tuft of broken grass, there a bare impression in a tiny patch of grass. And every once and again a drop of blood to convince him he's moving in the right direction.

As the blood begins to flow more freely, Starguard speeds up slightly, until he's almost trotting, leaving the others behind him working to catch up. All is rewarded when, behind yet another small hill, Starguard finds a young boy, still bleeding from numerous wounds, lying unconscious on the grass. Bending over him, it's obvious that the boy is dying. His eyes are closed, his face is pale with the loss of blood; blood now pooled under his shoulders, his head, and under his hands, where cruel cuts drove through his palms.

Starguard is down beside the boy in an instant, checking him over, trying to save his life if he can. Praying to the stars, his healing magic spreads out over the boy, stopping the flow of blood nearly instantly. "Why those bastards," he curses.

The boy's eyes slide open, slowly, and he stills utterly; even his breath seems to be held as he looks up at Starguard. Long moments pass, as brown eyes look up intently. Then a hand moves, cradling the other, where skin has covered wounds. His lips move, and then his head turns, spying Andreth, and Anstar. He stills again, looking up, waiting resignedly.

Andreth gasps in shock as he sees the young lad. "Good gods..." He swallows. "Who did this to 'im? An' why'd they haveta do so _much_?"

Tilara speaks, then, first in the Trade tongue. "Who did this to you? Why?"

Ash waits silently, unobtrusively, in the back. He stands ready as ever to confront whatever dangers have left this youth in his current wretched state.

The boy turns his head, looking at Tilara. "We didn't know ... there was so much blood ... in the dagger." His voice is slow, the words being formed between the pauses, as he visibly works to collect scattered thoughts. For one who thought he was about to die, he is remarkably lucid.

Starguard says, "So much blood in the dagger? What do you mean?"

Hands raised in front of his face, the boy inspects his palms. "Only a drop of blood, from each hand. Only a simple consecration. But the bleeding wouldn't stop. It bled, and bled, and then the slashes appeared; the dagger flew like a creature possessed ..." Still, his words stumble out with pauses, but while his voice has grown softer, his diction has become clearer ...

Andreth's face becomes drawn, and he looks at Anstar's unconscious visage. _And we nearly did that to **him...**_ he thinks to himself in horror, and closes his eyes.

Tilara says, "The Elk dagger, was it?"

The boy nods at Tilara. "Yes. We came as the Elk's party. We have to ... they had to leave me behind; I was dying, but Jellin isn't dead yet. They have to save him. If he dies ... if I die, we don't fail. But Jellin carries the key ..."

Tilara says, "There has to be a blood consecration, then?"

Starguard says, "Why did you think consecration was necessary?"

The boy looks at his hands, still turning them, wincing as the healed wounds still stretch and pull. "We needed to know Jellin's future. We needed to _choose_ Jellin's future. We found the book, and the sword, and the shield, and we prayed ... and we argued ... and we chose." His eyes fall closed, as he lies back, looking utterly despondent. "Perhaps we chose wrong. I don't know. There were ... words on the scroll. But we couldn't read them."

Tilara looks at her companions. "Let's hope that the tasks are unique. We haven't found anything like that." She turns back to the boy. "How many scrolls did you have?"

Andreth says softly, "Then there _is_ a choice... there has ta be." He pauses. "There were words on th' scroll? Were they there when you got there, or did they only show up after... afterward?"

The boy looks up at Tilara. "Three; birth, childhood, future. The first two were easy. Jellin is ... he's my brother, you see. I was there, when he was born." His face crinkles up in pain. "I don't want to be there when he dies."

He pauses. "And I suppose I won't be, at that."

Tilara says, "Apparently not. But you'll survive, now, I think. You said you could read the first two scrolls, but not the third? Or d'you mean that finding the first two scrolls was easy, but not the third?"

"What would be the manner of Jellin's death?" asks Ash, from the back. He's been listening quietly heretofore, but now an idea strikes him.

Turning his head at the sound of Ash's voice, the boy winces. "I don't know. It ... They warned us it would be slow, and painful. We always thought they were just using that to goad us on, that's why Jellin volunteered. He pictured a day sipping wine, and nibbling dainties, while waiting for us to catch up ..." The boy rubs his chest. "But it feels empty, inside. So empty ..."

A longer pause now, as the boy digests Tilara's question. Then he sighs. "The first two scrolls made sense. The first contained his name. his real name. The one no-one but him and me knew. The second ... the second contained a few words that made little sense. That was when ... when we wondered if we should take the child with us. But we left her behind. But the last ... the words made no sense. We couldn't pronounce them. And everytime we tried, the letters had changed."

Tilara says, "Ah-hah. While we brought our youngster along. Mayhaps the dagger was hunting for different blood. This is strange..."

Tilara shrugs. "We may have to try it. Starguard, do you have any healing power left?"

Andreth looks up sharply. "What child? Who was she? Anyone you knew?" He pauses, then asks another question. "Your brother - e's the one who they kept and the rest of you 'ad to rescue?"

Starguard says, "Only one. And not my strongest."

Ignoring the interplay between Tilara and Starguard, he looks up at Andreth. "We thought she was Jellin at first. But she couldn't be. Jellin's ... he's not a _girl_." The vehemence in that last word is startling. "But then we wondered ... but she seemed content enough where she was. She'd be married tomorrow, and the husband seemed nice enough."

Ash suddenly laughs. He sheathes his sword, then, and looks skyward. "You heard that, you bastards!" he yells, without visible provocation. "Stormy's future ain't written yet, because he hasn't written it! And we're gonna help him! So you damn well better cut through this nonsense!" Then, eyes blazing, he confronts his companions. "If the gods knew the future, this Courtship nonsense wouldn't even need to happen. Stormy's in danger, and we're gonna find him. But we aren't going to do that by cutting open anyone, or appealing to gods who don't know any more than we do about what's to come."

Andreth stares at Ash. Then he carefully lays Anstar down on the grass, and rummages for the third scroll case, meanwhile asking his earlier question once again: "Lad, did the third scroll appear before they cut you, or after?"

The boy bites his lip. "I don't ... we didn't think to ... _everybody_ knows how this test goes! I mean ... we _all_ know the stories, we've heard them so many times ... So we found the items, and I remembered what Jellin had told me, and we chose, and we consecrated, and I gave my blood for him, since he is my ... my brother, by blood and by soul and by totem, and ... " He crumples, tears pouring down his face as he rolls over, one fst pounding the ground. "And we failed!"

Holding the scroll case, Andreth is disturbed by its weight. Unlike the others, it feels ... it feels heavier than a single scroll would suggest. As he moves it, he feels a slight metallic rattle.

Tilara says, "We haven't heard the stories, lad. Can you tell us, quickly? Sword and shield? All we've found are the scrolls..."

Andreth's eyes go wide. "Somethin' in here. Not a scroll, neither." He begins to fumble with the catch, then stops, looking up at his companions. "Should I open it?" he asks.

The boy looks at Tilara. "Didn't the shaman tell you, when you learned to Change? Don't you know the story of the rituals? We ... " He pauses, eyes narrowing. "I don't think I've ever seen a girl here before. How can you stand in for the Suitor, if he fails?"

Ash gestures impatiently, but wordlessly, indicating his complete assent to Andreth and the question of the case.

Andreth catches Ash's eye, and nods. Without waiting for the other two, he unfastens the scroll case, ready to catch anything that might fall out...

Tilara says, "I don't. It's a long story... but we didn't have a shaman to tell us."

Starguard says, "It's amazing what you can do when you don't know the rules. What are they, anyway?"

Rolling out of the scroll case are ... at first he thinks he's holding a small collection of charms, before realizing they're all connected to a bracelet. A charm bracelet. How ... charming. There's a small dagger, here, and a flame. A book, and a bell, and a long bow crossed with a quiver. A sprig of some plant Andreth doesn't recognize, and a shield. And two linked rings. The scroll, too, bears three words. "Choose, not chosen."

The boy looks at Starguard, confusion in his eyes. "What are ... what?"

Starguard says, "The rules. Nevermind, it doesn't matter. We've been muddling through alright."

The boy shakes his head. "If you don't know ..." He presses his lips together, and suddely becomes very wary, his posture changing to that of the hunted, the prey, seeing predators surrounding him. His skin bleaches, but one hand curves around a small rock, the only weapon near at hand.

Andreth hrms quietly, after the words of the scroll have been read. "Choose, not chosen..." He ponders for a moment, then bends down, gently shaking Anstar by the shoulder. "Hey, wake up, lad..." he says, trying to rouse him.

Starguard says, "Down lad. We're not here to fight. And if you are, I'd reconsider the odds."

Ash steps forward, then, eyes departing from the trinkets in Andreth's hand to focus on the lad. "You cannot trade our lives for your brother's," he says calmly, hunkering down and looking on with a calm expression. "So.. choose. Choose life, not death."

Anstar slowly stirs, eyes opening, then his hand moving to cover Andreth's. His eyes still look hunted, but he seems calmer now, having spotted the scroll. "You're ... the knife?"

Tilara says, "We're not your enemies, lad, even if we're not proper Changers. The Gods are meddling again, and we've been tasked to carry their baggage for the nonce. But we're playing this contest straight, as far as we understand it."

The boy looks at Ash, cradling the small rock in his hands. "If Jellin dies, I die. Don't you see? We ... we've killed him. I can't tell my mother that I killed my baby brother; I can't tell her it was my fault. Better to die ..." He thrusts himself up, trying to brain Ash with the rock.

Ash reaches out with one hand, lightning-fast, grabbing hold of the youth's wrist and holding it in a firm grip. "What mother wants to lose two children on the same day?" he asks, still calm. He shows no anger, no surprise, at the attempt on his life, feeble as it may have been.

Andreth tries to ignore the young Changer lad's outburst, his eyes focused on Anstar's. "'Choose, not chosen.' I'm not sure what that's s'posed ta mean, but... I think it means we shouldn't choose _for_ ya. It's yer choice to make for yourself. Whatever that means." He pauses, then holds up the bracelet to Anstar. "This was in the case with the scroll. I don't know what it's for either, but... does one o' these _look_ right ta you?"

The boy cringes, his wrist turning feebly in Ash's grasp. Then he slackens, the fight gone completely out of him. "Save Jellin? Take me, and we can ... trade places?"

Tilara sighs as the boy tries to attack. She doesn't want to hurt him, either. "Lad, bravery sometimes means _not_ dying, when dying is easier. Your mother would not want to lose you as well, just because you don't want to face her."

Tilara says, "Besides, you don't know you've lost him, yet. Don't give up."

"We'll help you however we can," says Ash evenly, with a smile. "But, the road to the future isn't fixed. If you aren't walking, kid, you're being carried."

Starguard says, "And we've got our own friend to save."

Anstar fingers the charm bracelet, carefully holding each of the charms in his palm. Pa taught me the bow, and the plants, and the book. Ferg ... he taught me the dagger, and the shield. The book, the bell, the rings ... I don't ..." The boy, now unusually quiet, considering his tender years, looks at the bracelet. He fingers each of the charms, before sliding the bracelet on his wrist. His entire mien is somber. A somberness eerie in one so small, so young. Fitting, but eerie. Finally he shakes his head. "I can't, Andreth. These charms aren't ... they're not mine. I don't think ... " He pauses. "I would ... I would choose the flame, I think. Or the bow. Perhaps the plant. I ..." He shakes his head, sliding the bracelet off his wrist and returning it to Andreth.

Ash asks a more direct question of his captive, even as his strong grip on the boy's wrist subsides. "When you have all three scrolls, and you've completed the trial, what happens next?"

The boy looks at Ash. "Then we race to the cages, and we read the scrolls, and Jellin will be released." He shrugs. "But we can't read the third scroll, so Jellin will die when the sun goes down. We have enough time, but we don't have ... we don't have the key."

"Where are the cages?" asks Ash.

The boy looks across the fields. "Follow the stream," he explains, "and when the water seems to disappear into the ground, there's a cave nearby. Narrow at first, but it opens up underground. That's where the Cages of Judgement hang." He shrugs. "Surely you knew that? Everyone knows that; you're born, you're taken to the Cages, you return for the Change, you ... it's the only place besides the Hall where we live in truce!"

"Every Changer knows that," corrects Ash gently. "Now, let's hurry. We'll find your friends there, if anywhere, I expect."

Andreth nods to Anstar and pats him on the shoulder. "It's okay, lad... we'll think o' somethin'." He studies the charms himself. "I wonder... you say these ain't yours, but you know what they are..." He looks up. "Maybe they're _our_ Stormy's? Mebbe _he_ chooses."

On an impulse, Andreth tries on the bracelet himself.

Tilara says, "That's good to go on with... hey, be careful!"

Although it's a tight fit, Andreth does manage to wear the bracelet. It ... glitters nicely in the sun. It hangs loosely once on his wrist, past his hand. But it gives off no unexpected feelings.

Andreth slips it off again, and shrugs. He didn't really expect anything - the bracelet may not be Anstar's, but it certainly isn't Andreth's.

Carefully lifting the boy in his arms, Ash holds him. "What's your name, boy?" gets a quiet "Kiernan" in response. Ash points out each of the others, turning his head at each and naming them. Then, following the boy's directions, he swings into the lead, the others following him. Andreth, for now, keeps an eye on Anstar who still looks very quiet, but seems otherwise recovered from his fainting spell.

After a steady half hour's worth of walking, the stream disappears into the ground as forecast. Beyond, there's a small opening into the ground that's hard to see until Kiernan points it out, although from then on it's perfectly obvious to everyone.

The size of the entrance is deceiving too; small as it looks, Ash doesn't have to put the boy down, nor stoop, nor twist to make his way through the passage. There's ambient light shining in from above, and perhaps a hundred yards in, as the tunnel has swept steadily downwards, a cave opens up. In the center, hanging from the ceiling, are four cages, each locked, and warded. Spell fire burns over them, and the figures inside are limp. The occasional moan acts as counterpoint to the steady drip of blood. Surrounding the cages are eight old men, each dressed in leathers, eyes wild, hair bleached purest white. Although two of the mean wear cloaks that appear to be made of feathers, not leather, and one of the others appears to have horns. They turn as the party enters, and gaze at them.

Beyond these men, beyond the cages, a pile of corpses rests, still fresh. You can smell the blood, and the taint of death is thick in the air. Kiernan stirs in Ash's arms, and then screams, once, before turning to hide his face in Ash's tunic.

Starguard looks at the four cages. "Stormy!" he calls. "We're here!"

Ash moves forward, stern and grim. "We have the three scrolls of the Wolf Clan!" he announces, loudly.

One of the prisoners stirs, crawling to the cage's edge. In front of him, the eight men stand, forming a wall. At Ash's words, they smile. And separate, forming an avenue to one of the cages.

Andreth glances to either side at the elder... _elder Changers, they must be,_ Andreth thinks, fleetingly, before stepping forward, the three scroll cases in one hand, the charm bracelet in the other. As he reaches the cage, he holds up the bracelet. "Stormy... I think this might be yours..." he says, then waits.

A single hand comes through the cage. Andreth winces, remembering how healthy Stormy looked only this mornig. The wrist that he sees now is gaunt, the fingers hooked into claws, that grasp the bracelet, holding it there, hanging in the air for long moments, before he pulls the bracelet back into the cage. His face, his body, is covered in darkness, so that it's hard to make out what he does, but the charms tinkle, as they collide, and he holds them, running his fingers over them, turning the bracelet ...

Andreth gestures Starguard to join him. He isn't much of a reader himself, and he doesn't trust his skills. Not for this, when it's a matter of life and death.

Starguard steps forward beside Andreth. "You'll be alright. I don't think I'm allowed to do this bit. You've got the knife."

Andreth looks up at poor Stormy, his face drawn in sympathy. "I... I think you gotta choose one..." he murmurs, the pain in his voice, as he watches the third scroll carefully...

Starguard says, "It doesn't say that, Andreth. Only that he must choose."

The bracelet clinks, as Stormy's fingers rest on one, then another, sliding along the bracelet. There's a whimper, and then a whispered "I can't ..."

Andreth nods, and sighs. "Then I hope this works..." He opens the first scroll, takes a deep breath and reads the words he remembers there: "Anstar Astil."

There's a moan, from the cage, then a dry sob, but no other reaction.

Another wince crosses Andreth's face, and goes on to the next scroll. "Bought," then "Promised," he calls out, in a ringing voice.

TStormy moves closer to the edge of the cage. His hands tremble as he continues to finger the bracelet, but he's moved into the light now, what light there is. He looks ... old. Older than he was this morning. Older than he's ever been. Anstar, watching from a distance, bites his lip, and looks at Andreth, one hand twitching when Andreth pronounces both those words.

Andreth gasps softly, and his lips move briefly as he looks in mute horror at the aged figure in the cage. Finally, he remembers himself, and brings out the third scroll. He licks his lips, then intones the final words: "Choose, not chosen."

Listening to those final words, the elders crack smiles. Hands move away from pouches at their belts, and suddenly they look a great deal less dangerous. Stormy, too, seems to take heart. He looks at the charms again, fingering them, muttering under his breath. He points at one and names it Starguard. Another he names Tilara. One he pauses over, then names it Yuri ... and another is Ferg. He freezes for long moments after uttering Ferg's name, before looking at the bracelet again. Then he touches one, and calls it Andreth, and he looks up, his gaze catching Andreth's. For a moment, the pain seems to fall away from him.

Tilara breathes again as the elders relax, though she's still worried about Stormy. She glances at the other boy, the young Anstar...

Anstar watches, his eyes wide open, his fists clenched at his side. He seems to be seeing things noone else there is, and sometimes his eyes dart to the elders. Looking at the elders, Tilara notices two of them, in turn, watching Anstar.

Kiernan, on the hand, looks away most resolutely. His face remains buried, where he hid it in Ash's tunic.

Fingering the charms, Stormy hesitates for a long time over two of them, then names on of them Ash. He looks up, looking directly at Ash, his lips curving into an odd and unexpected smile. Not a big smile, mind you, but a smile. Then he looks at the shade, the cloud, that flew in behind Ash, and fingers the two remaining charms. "Mother", he mutters. "This must be ... mother." He holds one last charm in his hand, and pulls himself up against the bars of the cage. The last charm he fits into the lock, pressing it into the darkness. The lock snaps open, the door swings wide, and Stormy crumples into Andreth's surprised grasp.

Andreth's arms wrap around Stormy and hold him, as gently as the young monk can manage. "It's okay, lad... we're here for ya... we've come for ya, just like we said we would..."

Starguard's hands go to Stormy's shoulders, his last spell flowing into the poor lad. "We gotcha now. We made it."

Tilara runs forward as the cage opens, her eyes bright with unshed tears. "I knew I shouldn't have asked you to do that, Stormy. Will he be all right, Starguard?"

Between them, Starguard and Andreth hold the boy, as strength slowly seeps back into his limbs. The aged, gaunt look is not as desperate as it could be, but the boy definitely looks older, tempered. Like hardened steel, the baby fat is gone, his cheekburns standing out in stark relief. His eyes are shadowed, now, and there's a streak of white in his hair. But he smiles, albeit weakly, at Tilara, and cradles the charm bracelet in his hands. "You came. You all came."

Tilara crowds past Starguard to press a kiss on his forehead. "Of course we came. We promised you we would. It was only a day for us, though. How long did it take for you?"

Starguard says, "Physically, he'll be alright in a week or so. He's been through a hell of a lot."

Turning away from Stormy for a moment, Ash directs his question to the assembled elders or representatives. "The Elk emissaries... I need to speak with them," he says. "Have they arrived?"

One of the men, the one who wears the horns, steps forward. "They came. They failed. We ... cannot let failures live." He turns slightly, so that Ash can see the pile of corpses. "They were the first to arrive, but they did not fare well. Jellin alone survives. For now."

Tilara frowns. "Cannot, or will not?"

Stormy looks up at Tilara, blushing brightly. A blush that brings much needed colour into his cheeks. "A day? A week? I ... I don't know. We all arrived in good spirits, but as time wore on ... the silences became longer." He looks back at the cages. "Jellin is going to die, isn't he?"

The man shrugs. "We did as the ritual demands. If they survive, then ... perhaps we should amend the songs. But none have ever survived."

"That is your custom. Where are the scrolls they collected?" asks Ash, staying calm despite the obvious pain his charge is undergoing.

Tilara murmurs, "Not if we can help it, Stormy. I don't know that we can, but we have to try. His brother helped us, we owe it to him."

The man shrugs at Ash. "Presumably, they still carry them.

Starguard blinks, moving towards the corpses. "Something moved there..."

Ash points toward them. "Starguard. Do what you can.. We'll find the scrolls. Kiernan, we need your help now."

Starguard says, "I need his help. I have a single weak spell, and I need to know who to save."

Starguard says, "They all live, but the blood is simply flowing."

Kiernan looks up from where Ash is still holding him. "Jellin. Save Jellin ..." He moans, ignoring the bodies. "He still lives. You heard them!"

Ash sets down Kiernan carefully. "We'll do what we can. Starguard, direct us in treating the wounded?" He looks to Tilara and Andreth as well, and Stormy even, silently inviting them to join in. "We'll save Jellin if we can, however we can," he says quietly.

The elders step out of the way, neither aiding, nor hindering, as the party moves forward. Somehow, they seem utterly to not care.

Andreth nods to Ash, and kneels beside the four young lads, trying to console them as best he can while Starguard works at healing them. "Don't give up, lads... there may be hope yet..."

Tilara does what she can to help, remembering what she's learned about staunching bleeding wounds from Starguard over the last few months.

Starguard begins to work, his last healing spell, a slight touch on one, bandages and herbs coming out for the others. "I think I can save them, after all. They may live."

Tilara says, "For now. Let's hope we can get them to fix what they did wrong."

Working quickly, and efficiently, Starguard manages to use his gifts, innate and more physical, to staunch the bleeding. The four boys are left weak, and barely conscious, but the bleeding has stopped. Kiernan, kneeling by one of the boys, strokes his forehead, and shakes his head. "You were supposed to ... to save ..." He looks up at Ash. "Ulrin carried the scrolls." He unearths them from the boy's tunic. "And Pierin the charms ... but there was no bracelet." Pierin, the oldest looking of the boys, the one Starguard tends last, carries a velvet pouch on his belt. Kiernan tugs it loose, and hands it to Ash.

Ash holds out his hand for a moment in a mute gesture of refusal, though he smiles. "Do this yourself, if you are able. Do you realize the choice that we made for our friend here?" he asks.

Kiernan looks at Ash. "Jellin ... Jellin had to choose?" He looks down at the scrolls, and then back at Ash. His face is pale, and he's trembling on his feet. "And we ... we killed him. We condemned him." Unnoticed, his hands crumple the scrolls, dropping them as balls of mangled paper at his feet.

Tilara says, "Not yet, you haven't. There's still time."

Ash shakes his head. "You have to choose as well," he says in a soft voice. "What I choose affects those around me.."

Kiernan looks at Ash. "I don't understand." He drops to his knees, suddenly gathering up the scrolls again, pressing them to his chest. "I don't ... I don't understand."

The warrior continues. "The Courtship... is about the future of the Changers. It is a ritual to _decide the future_. Not to reveal it. What happens can't be known to anyone, until it happens. The third scroll... Jellin's future.... it can't be decided by divination. Only by action. You have to find the power in yourselves to save your brother. You have to step forward, instead of letting yourself be carried by the powers of the gods, or anyone else. You... have to accept responsibility for the relationship you and he have. Save him. Not by relying on anyone else, but by just stepping forward."

Kiernan nods, his spine straightening, as he seems to gain a number of years in mere moments. Suddenly the boy has become a man, as understanding flows through him. He turns around, and tucks the pouch into his belt. Then he carefully opens the scrolls.

The elders, who have been watching impassively, now look at Kiernan. Their gazes are intimidating, and for a moment he almost falters, before he straightens again. He doesn't wait for them to form an avenue; shouldering through them as though they were mere flotsam in the river of his life. He opens the first scroll. "Named Ellinor Bethan, at birth, you were my younger sibling, carrier of the family name, sister of my heart." He pauses for a moment, then drops the scroll. "You were our hope, and our future, and the only memory of our mother. You were Memory, and Future, and you were Love." His voice breaks, as the creature in the cave stirs, moving closer to the edge. Stormy, looking up, blinks for a moment, and then turns back to help Starguard.

Kiernan opens the last scroll, looking at it blindly, his eyes filled with tears. For long moments, he can't seem to read the words. For long moments ... then it dawns on him that the words no longer move. Nor do they change. He looks up at Jellin, and stands straighter than ever before. "Ash spoke wisely, of the need to choose the future, not to be chosen by it. As the scroll says, Jellin, _Trust is not blind._" He stops, looking at the scroll. "_Love is not trust._" He moves forward, holding the pouch up to the figure in the cage.

Jellin's hand, no bigger than Anstar's, holds the pouch, then carefully pulls it into the cage. The pouch is opened, and each of the charms is examined carefully. The dagger, the shield, the bow ... As everyone strains to hear, they can make out what Jellin mumbles. "The dagger, the last hope of betrayed trust, the shield that protects, the bow that hunts and provides ..." There's a long pause. "The shield that protects ... the bow that provides ..." Then Jellin stands, pulling himself up to the lock. The dagger falls at Kiernan's feet. "There was no betrayal ... do I shield? Do I provide?"

The fumbling continues, until finally ... there is a decision. "I do not choose. I do not ... do not have to choose. I can ... can do both." The two charms fit into the lock, together, and this door too swings open. Having watched Stormy fall, Kiernan stands ready to catch Jellin, but crumples under the impact.

"You were almost betrayed by a future that nobody had yet written," murmurs Ash, but only to himself. He looks on impassively, waiting and hoping that somehow the best outcome can be torn from this situation.

Tilara nods as she watches from Starguard's makeshift clinic. _I wonder how the elders will react to this?_

Starguard shakes his head. "Youth, without guidance. I suppose it's no worse than our group without a clue." He goes to help the young lad and his sister.

Starguard shakes his head. "I wonder what kind of suitor chooses such inexperienced companions."

Andreth rushes to Starguard's side, ready to providing a helping hand as needed, either to Starguard, or the young Elk-companions - both of them surely weakened by their ordeal.

Ash shrugs a little. "One who must?" he asks, but again mostly to himself.

Tilara murmurs, "They did say that the Elk clan was having trouble..."

Kiernan and Jellin, sprawled as they are on the floor, are locked in a tight embrace that nobody can sunder. Not just yet. The elders watch impassively, until one of them is heard to mutter something under his breath. Something about rewriting the songs. He sounds grumpy, and somewhat less pleased than one would expect.

Starguard turns to glare at one of the elders, having little pity for those who prefer less work to less life.

Tilara gets up and steps forward, finally. "Perhaps it is time to rewrite some of them. Competition and testing has its place, but cooperation is a good thing, as well."

Andreth raises his head, as Kiernan and Jellin seem to be okay for now. He leaves the others to worry about the elders' disapproval, and glances at Stormy, then at young Anstar. _What do they make of each other?_ he asks himself.

Ash sighs, then takes three steps, his fist balling up tightly. Before anyone can say or do a thing about it, he drives the fist deep into the abdomen of the mumbling elder, grabbing his collar as the man nearly doubles over. "Now that we've finished this," he says conversationally to the man with horns, even as his fist withdraws, "where are we supposed to go next?"

Andreth then looks up, startled, as Ash takes matters into his own hands. "Ash!" he calls out, starting to his feet... then relaxing a little as sudden violence fails to come upon anyone else, and merely rejoins his companions.

Illath steps out of the shadows, deep in the cave. "Now, young Ash ... " He steps over the wheezing elder as though he wasn't there. "Now you rest. I think", he smiles, looking at Starguard and the wounded Elk companions, "I think we will keep you and the elks together."

Starguard says, "Will the Hawk Suitor be there?" Starguard's tone is pleasant and conversational, but noticably strained to the members of the Company.

Tilara just shakes her head at Ash. "A bit much, wasn't that?" There's a grin trying to crawl out from under the stern face she's forcing, though.

Meanwhile Stormy and Anstar are facing one another. Stormy holds the young boy's hands, tracing out ancient scars, and running a hand through the boy's hair. Then he slides the two rings off the charm bracelet, fitting one over the young boy's ring finger, and the other over his own. He smiles, slowly, once.

Ash helps the man to his feet, showing at least a modicum of concern and respect to the elder he just slugged. He nods to Illath. "We're at your disposal."

Illath shakes his head at Stormy. "No. There remains one day of testing." He looks at the two Companion parties. "Although ... it's going to be a very short day, considering what you have achieved here, and now." He smiles wryly. "Still, we preserve the forms. You will meet Keorn and the Elk Suitor tomorrow evening."

Starguard smiles faintly. "Good. I look...forward to meeting such an august person."

Tilara turns back to watch her protege and his younger self. "So. Does the Elk suitor have a name?"

Smiling, Illath nods. "Yes. But he chooses not to share it with us. Yet. You will meet him tomorrow night."

Tilara says, "I do hope it's no one we know."

Several young men are motioned forwards by Illath, and he addresses both parties. "Follow us. These men will carry the wounded; we will tend them tonight. They need to regain their strength." He himself lifts up young Jellin, straightening the hair over her brow, and looking at Kiernan. Kiernan looks startled, for a moment, then is about to say something when Illath shakes his head. Turning, Illath leads the way out of the caves.

Starguard says, "May we ask how the Cats and Hawks are doing?"

Illath smiles at Starguard. "The hawks are ... acquitting themselves well. Their leader should not give up hope. The Cats ... have run into some difficulty; the wolves do not set kind tests."

Starguard says, "Nor do any of the others, I think Illath."

Tilara says, "Certainly not the Hawks."

Andreth joins Stormy and Anstar, chuckling merrily - as much as anything, relieved to see that Stormy is all right. "Not every day you find yourself, is it?" he says to both of them.

Illath looks around. "Your team has made it through in remarkably good condition, Starguard. It is not often that the Companions survive to the final day; yet you have not lost a single member." He shakes his head. "We must have miscalculated a little; you have managed to increase your strength, rather than decreasing it." He turns to look at Anstar. "And you have solved a riddle for us."

Tilara says, "Oh?"

Illath's eyes narrow. "Yes. Anstar was ... not the test that we had chosen, nor the test that we had prepared. We had a different dilemma in mind. And yet ..." The man shrugs. "We set the tests, but Far Seer writes the scrolls. Sometimes he meddles." He looks again at Stormy. "So he's solved one riddle, and given us two new ones."

Tilara says, "That's a relief. I was quite concerned that your test had the power to meddle with time itself."

Starguard says, "We took, admittedly, a bit of a detour. The Gods had a finger in it. The Stars, to be specific."

Tilara snorts. "A finger? They've been meddling with both hands since we left Woolwich, if you ask me."

Floating down, now, caressing both Stormy and Anstar with tender wisps of smokelike substance, Anne follows them both. Illath, noticing the shade, nods. "Yes. The Stars do not usually meddle." His eyes narrow. "Then again, the companions are normally of the Clan, not outsiders." He shakes his head. "Candidly, we expected you to fail. You lacked rudimentary knowledge; you did not even know what questions to ask. And yet ... you have performed better than three generations of Companions."

Starguard says, "We work very well as a team, and we are both lucky, and do good turns. Those come back to help, often."

"Some of us are grateful for the gods' meddlin'," says Andreth, the man twice born, with a quiet cough.

Tilara gives Andreth a hug. "Didn't say I was objecting, dear. Just commenting."

Nodding, Illath carries Jellin to a simple pallet, lowering her carefully, and then tucking a blanket around her. She needs sleep; we'll feed her in the morning and help her recover her strength." He slides a pillow under her head, then sits down beside her. He doesn't appear to notice hor his hand rests on her shoulder, nor the way Kiernan crowds close to him. Rather, he smiles at the Companions. "Come, sit, eat, drink, be merry. Tonight I have the answers if you pose the questions."

Starguard says, "Has any group helped another like we have before, Illath? Is it allowed?"

Illath looks at Starguard. "No; this aid is ... unheard of." His hand smooths the hair across Jellin's forehead. "Entire new songs wil be written about this courtship. But if Far Seer does not stop you, then who are we to demand you cease?"

Tilara nods. "Apparently it _is_ allowed, or we wouldn't be sitting here. But it's new. Might be that's why we were added to the Courtship this time."

"Isn't that the point, though, Illath?" asks Ash, a little confused. "For something new to come of all this?"

Illath nods, at Ash. "Yes. Renewal is the purpose of the Courtship." He sighs. "A much needed renewal."

Starguard says, "You said that not losing a member was odd. How odd is it? Do most teams end up like the Elks?"

Tilara says, "Remember the first test, Starguard. If _that_ is routine, it almost demands a death."

Gazing somberly at Starguard, Illath nods. "If Samaela can choose between two suitors, after the tests are complete, she is deemed a fortunate young maiden. This time, she will perhaps gain a choice of three."

Starguard says, "May she choose wisely then."

Tilara sighs. "I just hope that the Elk suitor isn't who we think it is. We helped them, since they were young and Kiernan helped us, though he didn't realize it. But ... we're worried about who holds their Dagger."

Illath nods, looking around at the campsite. "Yes ... " His eyes close for a moment, hiding his thoughts. "May she choose wisely. Her choice is more important than you realize." He gazes at each of the Companions in turn, then looks at the stricken ones, who are being tended carefully. "Much more important ... She holds our future; we must all abide by the choice she makes."
