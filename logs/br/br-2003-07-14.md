# Birthright 2003-07-14

As the fire blazes merrily, provinding a warm counterpoint to the chilly evening, Illath positively unbends, and becomes a veritable fountain of information. He seems both bemused and intrigued by the White Company, but determined not to pose questions of his own.

Ash asks one of the things that is foremost on his mind, at last, and the depth of his opinion on this matter is revealed by the bluntness: "What is served by putting a suitor's companions through all this?"

Illath smiles at Ash. "The test of the companions tests several things. It tests the Suitor's ability to choose his people, and to condemn at least one of the people he chooses to death. Ours is not a peaceful life, and a leader who cannot choose who lives and who dies is not a leader who willlead us well. It also tests his ability to choose people who will persevere, and who will fight through to the bitter end, solving the riddles that are set." He pauses a moment. "We need leaders who value wisdom, as well as courage."

Ash sits back, considering this. "Then what is the role of the suitor, once the Courtship has ended? Leader of the Changer peoples, everywhere? Or..?"

Starguard blinks. "'Condemn at least one of the people he chooses to death?'" Starguard asks, not sure if he heard that passage correctly.

Smiling drily, Illath looks in the fire. "Samaela the Maiden becomes the Mother. Her Husband becomes ... the father. He leads, although he is expected to lead by convincing, rather than by fiat. Still, there are many Changers who will follow the Father blindly. Far Seer, therefore, meddles in every set of tests." His lips twist. "Yes, Starguard. One of the chosen dies. It is a death of honour, and the wise Suitor chooses a Changer who is close to dying."

Starguard says, "In our case, it was Andreth, correct?"

Illath looks at Starguard. "I am not Keorn. Perhaps you could ask him?" He pauses. "But if Yuri had not left when he did ... I suspect that he would have been Keorn's choice. Still, ultimately, the Companions choose who dies, but the Suitor chooses which group of Changers must face that choice."

Ash privately considers this apparent paradox. To prove one's leadership qualities, one sacrifices his closest friends. But why, then, is it so unheard-of that a party of companions should help the others? Is not mutual aid also part of leading a strong and capable nation?

Tilara nods. "Sensible. It certainly doesn't work well for the children of the current chieftain to inherit the position simply by right of birth. Maybe _we_ should adopt something similar." She shakes her head. "As if Lurin would accept that at this point without a war anyway... Kiernan mentioned that there are stories that 'everyone knows' relating to these Challenges. Could you give us the short version of them?"

Kiernan still presses close to Illath, though scrupulously not touching the far older man. His eyes keep straying to Jellin, who sleeps the sleep of the healing child.

Looking at Tilara, Illath smiles. "The shortest version? Let me see." His eyes dim, and his voice deepens, bringing forth the resonance of ages, as he chants, almost. _Once there was the Father, and he saw Samaela, and he did love her, and she did give birth to 8 daughters. From these were born the Changers as we know them today. Though they were spurned in the Flatlands, they made a peaceful life in the mountains, until the sons of the Emperor provoked them._

_Then the Changers turned their minds to War. Far Seer left them, promising them a Maiden, and soon a Suitor was found. Heron led the Changers, taking them deeper into the Mountains, where they found the Winds of the Storm. Thus caught between pincers, the Heron led the sorties, until at last he died. The Mother, disconsolate, gathered her children, and fled._

Tilara sighs. _Damn Prince Lurin, anyway. He started **this** war as well as the one with his brothers._

_Again, Samaela the maiden was born. Again we tested the four Suitors, as Far Seer had commanded. Oak, master of the bow, mastered the Maiden. A cruel Father, he led us into war on both fronts, and so much death came to us. His Samaela, in grief and mourning, killed herself after renouncing him._

His expression bleak, Illath looks around. "We have only this chance. The Maiden has again reached the age of decision; if we choose the wrong Suitor this time, we die." His hand strokes Jellin's brow. "And some of our suitors are not ... not wise."

Starguard says, "Including or excluding Keorn, might I ask. In your opinion, of course."

Illath looks at Tilara. "These are why we have the tests. We all know that one member will die, that there will be riddles about the birth, childhood, and future of one member, and that last of all, the companions will be expected to bring one Child of the changers through the third test."

Turning to look at Starguard, Illath shakes his head. "I thought, at first, that Keorn would destroy us all. The prophecies are not ... sanguine on the matter of non-Changers. After all, if Keorn dies, one of his Companions will take his place. And who among you ..." He pauses, smiling wryly. "And again, we thought the lack of information you had would render the point moot. Oddly enough, it hasn't."

Starguard nods. "We're rather glad you've been proved wrong so far. Though 'so far' it is. What lays in wait tomorrow? Can you tell us anything?"

Illath shrugs at Starguard. "This is the trickiest of the tests. We warn you what lies ahead, and let the gods sort it out. In short, you must bring forth a Child of the Changers."

Tilara says, "Prophecies are notoriously vague until after the fact. One wonders if the Gods just make things up that sound good... What is the danger? One of us - including Keorn, I'm sure - would not lead the Changers into war with the Empire, at least. I think your tale missed the mark on one point. It was Lurin, not _all_ of the children of Glia-Gulmeshki, who oppressed the Changers. "

Kiernan bristles at Tilara. "The prophecies are not vague at all. If a non-Changer lies with the Maiden, and becomes the Father, what will his children be? If we become ... " He glares for a moment, then suddenly pauses. "If we become like you ..." His voice has gentled, as he seems to be pondering a whole new idea.

"What if you did?" counters Ash. He waits expectantly, curious, now that the \`end of the world' aspect of this prophecy has apparently been toned down. But then again, to some people, becoming other than they are might be the end of the world for them.

Tilara says, "It might work the other way, for that matter. We might become Changers, like you."

Kiernan looks at Ash, and shrugs. "No; the Changer totems are not gifts that we can exchange at will. We are born Changers, we die Changers. Those who are born ... without the totem ..." MHe pauses, struggling. "Their lives are short, and brutal, and painful. When the Moon, and the Stars, and the Birthing Crown were born, the Moon did not live to see the dawn. She blazed brightly, and then died. The Stars ... lived among us, but their children have all died. And the Birthing Crown never followed us. She was the ... the renegade."

Starguard says, "This is all theoretical anyway. We don't plan to let Keorn die."

Illath smiles grimly at Starguard. "Of course not. And he only faces three Suitors ... now that you've left him one more enemy."

Tilara says, "What is the Suitor's final test?"

Illath looks at Tilara. "We don't know. The Suitors gather with the Maiden. In the morning, she emerges with her Husband and the first of her Children. The others are never seen again."

Starguard says, "Perhaps, we have won Keorn some goodwill as well. An enemy or ally?"

Tilara blinks. "The first of her Children, the next morning...? That seems... quick."

Kiernan looks at Tilara. "You're forgetting the third test."

Tilara smiles at the boy. "Not forgetting. I haven't been told yet."

Kiernan shakes his head. "Yes. You have. The third test is simple; to bring forth a Child of the Changers."

Tilara blinks. "Ah... I see. I think. How does one accomplish this?"

Starguard says, "I've done some midwifery before, but it's usually not that quick a business."

Illath looks at Tilara. "I can only repeat what I have already said. I do not know. This is where the gods meddle."

Tilara says, "This ... isn't supposed to be a nine-months test, is it?"

Illath looks exasperated. "No! You will have one day, from suns up to suns down."

Andreth has been pondering Illath's words in all this, and looks troubled. Finally, he speaks up: "This Child of the Changers we bring forth... does it haveta be a Wolf we bring through?"

Illath shakes his head. "No. The Prophecies are clear on that. But it does need to be a Child of the Changers."

Andreth nods, slowly, and looks a little relieved. "Is it one we pick, or is it chosen for us somehow?"

Illath shakes his head. "I don't know, Andreth. I'm not ..." He looks down at Jellin. "Believe me, if I knew, I would share that information."

Andreth hrms, and nods. "Well, I hope the gods're payin' proper attention, that's all I say."

Tilara says, "I just hope they know what they're doing, meddling with things."

Kiernan nods, once, wincing. "We all do, Andreth. We all do." He looks down at his sister. "I think they did, when they sent you. She would have ... I would have ..." Illath winces.

Starguard says, "You've paid us back for it, lad."

Kiernan nods at Starguard, once. "Thank you. But if we cannot find this Child tomorrow ..."

Andreth now turns to Stormy, with a different question. "I been wonderin'... back there, when you called out our names... which o' us was which charm? I see you were the rings, but who're the rest of us?"

Stormy fingers the ring on his finger, looking nervous. He looks at Andreth, and pauses, and looks at the ring, and looks sideways at Anstar, and then bites his lip. Finally he plunges in. "You were easy, Andreth; you've been entered in the Book, and you still live." He turns. "And you, Tilara, you're the flame I wanted to be. Starguard, the healer, whose gift from the gods was a satchel full of plants ... that was easy, too." He pauses, thoughtfully. "After that it was harder."

Tilara says, "We should be on an even footing. Our mentor here doesn't know what happens, either."

Stormy pulls the bracelet out again, thoughtfully, looking at the charms. "Anne was ... she was the bell, she sounded so clear when she spoke to me, all thought the day, chiming hope, and love. And Ash was the shield; protecting us bodily, where Yuri tried to provide with the bow." He shudders. "And what could Ferg be, but the dagger?"

Meanwhile, Kiernan turns to Tilara. "Perhaps. But you've solved two tests already. We have come so close to failure ..." He looks sideways at Illath. "Our fathers would not be proud."

Starguard says, "The fact that we have to do it in one night suggests it might not be as we would normally expect, either. And I, for one, want to get some sleep in tonight to be ready in the morning."

Andreth nods, resting a hand on Stormy's shoulder to steady him. "A pretty riddle they posed us... I'm glad ye came through it alive."

Tilara nods, her voice a little unsteady again, thinking about that. "Aye. But Starguard has the right of it, for now. Let's get some sleep."

Stormy smiles up at Andreth. "Yes." He looks at his ring. "It was so strange ... I thought Yuri was the ring, but ... " He looks at Anstar, and smiles oddly. "But he is me, and still not me."

As the night passes quietly, Jellin and the other wounded Elk companions slowly but surely regain their colour. They're still a little weak in the morning, but they are no longer dying, or even badly wounded. Illath waits for everyone to ready themselves, as the sun creeps across the horizon. Then he addresses both groups at once. "The wolves and hawks have passed the second test. This is what we know of the third test: you may return to any site you have visited for the first or second test. By sunset, you must have a Child of the Changers, or your Suitor's suit is forfeit."

Kiernan looks at Illath, and then at his companions. Overnight, he seems tohave become the new elected leader. Then he turns to Ash, and Andreth. "We talked this over, but we remain confused. May we join you, for now?"

Ash says, "I do not object to your company."

Andreth nods. "o'course."

The elks look relieved while Illath merely looks amused. "You have one last chance to pose questions, before I take my leave.'

Tilara says, "Just one... how old will this Child be?"

Illath pauses, thoughtfully. "Usually? Between five and fifteen, if memory serves."

Andreth rubs his chin, doubting he'll get a straight answer, but he has to ask anyway.. "How'll we know when we 'ave one?"

Illath looks blank, then sighs. "I don't know, Andreth.

Starguard says, "I don't suppose anyone present counts? I find it hard to believe that it's ever that easy."

"I don't know, Starguard." Illath bites his lip. "Believe me ... I wish I did."

Ash frowns. "I do have one question, actually. Is there a reliable way to tell if someone is a Changer? A prayer, or incantation, or birthmark, or somesuch? Or is it all unseen? And I suppose, a second: does a Changer necessarily KNOW that he is one, unless told?"

Illath pauses. "That question I can answer. Normally, one companion at least is a shaman, who can read totems." He shakes his head. "Although you can't ... and a Changer does not learn of his or her totem until they have passed puberty."

Ash turns to Kiernan. "Is that true? You have a shaman among you?"

Kiernan looks at his hands. "I ... I am in training. But we ..." He shakes his head. "We're all so young. I ... I think I can recognize a totem, when I seek it, but ..."

Ash nods. "It's settled, then. You guys are coming with us," he says, directing this offer to Kiernan.

Tilara says, "Well, we'll have to go and find out, won't we? If we hold up our end, I think the Gods will meddle enough to make sure we recognize her when we find her. Or him."

Kiernan nods, and the others fall in line behind him. Jellin stays closest to him, holding his hand, as she or he looks scared.

After some discussion, the party decides to head back for the second of the official sites; the site where a birth was witnessed and a young couple met for the first time. Setting off eagerly, the party reaches the site in an hour or two, only to find ...

... Blood spatters everywhere, but the site itself is deserted.

Andreth shrugs. "Can't ha' expected they'd wanna hang around. Still, mebbe they left some trail to say which way they went," he comments, glancing questioningly at Starguard.

Starguard nods, and hunts around for tracks, for any sign of mother and child.

Ash thinks slowly and carefully, face set into a scowl. "Is it that STARTING at a test site is what we ought to do..? Or that we can gain what is needed only by staying at such a site..?"

The tracks look about a day old, suggesting that mother and child, and the new father, have long since left.

Starguard points out the tracks. "Old, but there. Not necessarily a chance of catching them. And might lose the trail."

Kiernan looks around the site. "Ash ... what happened here?"

Ash thinks for a moment, unsure of how much to reveal. He at last settles for a short summary. "This was the site of one of our tests," he explains. "And in it, we dealt harshly with a few men. There was a birth here, a very ... natural one."

Tilara says, "He said that what they know of it is that you can visit any site you've been to in the first two tests. I don't think they know for sure what happens next themselves. Let's go with our instincts."

Kiernan nods. "Stormy's birth." He looks at the young sorceror. "Not a pleasant birth, by all sounds."

Ash nods, then thinks for more moments. "Kiernan," he says quietly, "It is my belief that young Anstar is the Child we are trying to find. I need a way to confirm it. We have... the shade of his mother, I believe, as a guide, and I am considering having her song sung, if we can."

Kiernan looks confused. "You ... you don't want me to read the child's totem, first?"

Ash nods. "If you can, by all means, if it won't hurt him..."

During the discussion, Andreth draws the Wolf dagger and turns in a slow circle - the rune in the hilt had given us guidance in the previous day's test, and it's his hope that it might do so this day as well. For the present, that hope is denied, as the dagger remains quiescent in his palm.

Kiernan nods, and looks at Anstar. The boy looks very hesitant for a moment, before stepping forward, with Stormy behind him, Stormy's hand on the lad's shoulder. "Sit, child, and let me look into your eyes." The boys sink to the ground, and once all three are comfortable, Kiernan catches Anstar's gaze, and looks for a long time.

Finally he looks up, his face white and drained. "I think ... no. I know. He's the strongest Wolf I've ever seen."

Tilara grins. "Well, well, well... Anstar, do you know what that means?"

Anstar shakes his head. "No?"

Starguard says, "It means we went on the hike for nothing."

Tilara says, "It means that you'll grow up to be a shape-changer. You'll be able to turn into a wolf when you want... " She trails off, and then looks up at Stormy. "... And... that .... oh, my."

Andreth shakes his head, grinning at Anstar. "I dunno what it means either, but it _sounds_ like it means you're the lad on the spot." He pauses, and glances at Stormy. "Hm... Stormy, wouldja like Kiernan to read yer totem too?"

Stormy looks back at Tilara, confusion clouding his eyes ... Then he looks at Andreth, and finally nods. His hands are fisted, one over the other, protecting the ring that he values about all others.

Kiernan looks into Stormy's eyes, his face tense, his body looking relaxed, as though every muscle were forced and bludgeoned into relaxation. Time passes ... and then more time ...

Finally, Kiernan pulls back, and shakes his head. "He's ... he's not a Changer, no. I see, in him ... I see ... I see two Shields."

Jellin looks at Kiernan, and bites her lip. "Kiernan ..." She pauses, and looks meaningfully at him. He, in turn, looks pale.

Ash says, "What does it mean?"

Kiernan looks at Ash. "I think ... I think when we let the marriage go through ... we made a mistake." He looks at his companions, and at Jellin. "But I couldn't, we couldn't, I mean ... the marriage would only ..." He looks at Jellin, holding out his hand in entreaty, but the girl steps away, moving to stand beside Stormy.

Starguard says, "I wonder what will happen if we bring two children, of different suitors..."

Tilara says, "It may not be too late. We've found the boy who is to be our candidate. Why don't you take us to where this marriage was taking place?"

Andreth hrms quietly. "Just one thing first," he says, kneeling beside Anstar. "Lad, if ye're a Wolf, then... I think I may have somethin' that belongs to ye." He draws the Wolf dagger once more, and offers it to Anstar, hilt first. "Ye don't have to take it if you don't want, but... it don't belong to me, I know that. I was just given it for a while."

Anstar looks at the dagger, and then touches it with a single finger. The dagger immediately begins to glow, the gem in the hilt bursting into a cold cold flame. Startled, he pulls his finger back.

Andreth blinks, and looks down at the dagger, then back at Anstar, concern written on his face. "What happened? Are ye okay?"

Tilara says, "I think that's a good sign. It recognizes him."

Anstar nods, his hand curling into a fist. "It was warm, and ... and welcoming. When a man carries that dagger, he can do anything, slay any monster, kill Ferg ..." The boy looks so old, all of a sudden, and the look of longing etched across his features is so strong ...

Andreth nods quietly to Anstar. "I think it _knows_ it's yers, lad. And mebbe... mebbe ye'll even get yer chance ta kill Ferg, too." He offers the dagger once more, this time with greater confidence. "It ne'er said anythin' like that to me. But then, it weren't mine, as I said."

Anstar accepts the dagger, cradling it in his arms. For him, it's easily a short sword, given his much smaller stature. Perhaps, if he lives that long, he will someday grow into the dagger.

Starguard hmms. "This is not the time for Ferg, I think."

Andreth bows deeply to Anstar, and takes a deep breath. Only then does he notice Kiernan's entreaty, and Jellin standing away from him. "What's the matter, you two?" he says, perplexed.

Jellin points at Kiernan. "He knew ... he knows why ... why I'm who I am. Jellin, not Ellinor. And yet he **still** let the marriage go through? That was the ... the childhood that he thought I should have?" She shakes her head. "That was **his** idea of Love, and Memory, and our family's Future? To give me to an old, fat man?"

Tilara gets up to stand beside the young girl. "He's just a lad, Jellin. He didn't know any better. Maybe we can go fix it still, eh?"

Kiernan shakes his head. "I ... you know ... the contracts ... they all said the same thing. Our father's first daughter ... You **know**, Jellin, that ... that ... that you're not Ellinor in all the ways that count!"

Jellin turns to Tilara. "How do men do that? How do they betray us, over and over and ..." She looks at Kiernan. "Why don't you tell them the rest of it, brother dear? Why don't you tell them why I wasn't good enough?" Her lips pulled back in a snarl, she spits out the words.

Andreth walks between the two young Elks, off to one side, and kneels down, looking at them both in turn. He says nothing, but his posture is of one determined to hear out both sides before he'll speak.

Tilara opens her mouth to reply, but shuts it as Jellin continues. She looks at Kiernan, then, her stare smouldering almost as much as the young Changer's. "I ran away from an arranged marriage, myself, boy. Why don't you explain this to both of us?"

Kiernan sighs, looking down at the ground. Every line in his body betrays his guilt, as he mumbles under his breath. He digs a toe deeper into the ground, then looks up. "We ... we'd promised ... but the merchant. He was ... when the contracts were signed, father did not know who or what he was. And they were unbreakable; our Mother's soul was part of the bond. It went to seal an old feud. But ..." He looks at Jellin, before looking down again. "But she wasn't a changer. If she had been a boy, she would have been safe, but she was a girl and the merchant would have abused her ... we could only ..." He looks up. "But the girl we encountered **was** a Changer. A Hawk, like her father."

Jellin looks up. "If she was to me what Anstar was to Stormy ... You sold her, Kiernan. Now you'll have to buy her back."

Ash rumbles, "What can be done, then? Will any of this help you find your own way through these trials?" The big man has been thinking for some time, listening abstractly to the discussion. "If so, I offer you the help of the White Company, if they will follow me. I believe we've concluded what we must do. But, if there is no more to be done about this today... Kiernan, you must decide what honor demands of you." He frowns a little as he speaks, considering his prolixy of speech. "If nothing were expected of us, we'd slaughter each other for bread and companionship.. but as people pay you their debt to you, you in turn must consider how to make good your own debts, if you carry any."

Kiernan nods, facing Ash. His spine straightens, and he looks straight ahead. "Jellin is right. You are right. We must free that child. She did nothing to deserve this. Perhaps ... perhaps he waited ... and postponed the bleeding. But he was so ... so eager." The boy collapses again, sinking in on himself. "So eager ..."

Ash asks more quietly. "Then, what is to be done?"

Tilara scowls, though not at the boy this time. "Feuds. Filthy things."

Jellin steps forward. "The merchant, the old fat man, travels slowly, with his entourage. We can easily defeat them, the guards are few, and weak." She balls her fists. "We will deal with them, and the merchant will never prey on my sister again."

Tilara says, "This could work. What, precisely, was the bargain?"

"And how was it made?" asks Andreth. "Were ye forced inta it?"

Jellin looks at Tilara. "My hand in marriage. he raising of a passel of Changer brats. He was planning a little trading empire of his own, you see. But since I was no Changer, and nor was he, so our children would not be either. And I was not forced; when I was born the contract was already a decade old, and my mother rejoiced that she had had only sons ..."

Tilara says, "Ah. The old man was of Changer blood, but not a changer himself, I take it?"

Jellin nods. "He was a renegade. But he ... He had some sort of hold over my mother, apparently." Kiernan nods. "He knew things he should not have, could not have known. Her daughter bought her life. And father thought ... he thought we would have only sons."

Ash says, "What was his name?"

"Illath. My father was ... is Illath." Kiernan and Jellin, in a muttered harmony, stammer out the same words.

Tilara says, "The same one who....?"

Andreth grimaces, looking troubled. "I see why poor Kiernan'd chose wrong," he murmurs to himself. "Ta break a contract... even one like that..." he sighs. "No... it can't be right ta make a woman give up 'er daughter to someone. Contract or no contract."

Kiernan nods. "The same one who orchestrated your tests, yes. He spent the night with Jellin. They said ..." His voice broke. "They said goodbye. He doesn't expect us to survive, and he **can't** intervene."

Starguard frowns. "No one should create a contract like that."

Tilara grins, now. "The contract is fulfilled, now. We will just go and add our own clauses, and no shame to Kiernan's family if the fellow dies with his purpose unfulfilled."

It's not a pleasant grin. Not at all.

Jellin looks at Tilara, and then mimics her grin, slowly and carefully. "Yes. Let us do that." Behind her, Stormy nods, too.

His back a little straighter now, Kiernan leads the party deeper into the valley. Hours cross, as his gaze sweeps the countryside. Finally in the early afternoon, the party reaches a large well used campsite. He stops. "Here they ... they married." He pauses, then collects himself. "They left late, this morning. See? The ashes are still steaming from the water they used to douse the flames."

Tilara says, "A few hours ahead, then, and moving slowly. Let's keep going. We can eat tonight."

Kiernan nods, looking around. The trail is easy enough to follow; the merchant was obviously traveling in comfort, not stealth. It is only a moment's work to distinguish the tracks of the merchant's arrival from those of his departure.

Following the tracks, keeping an eye on the distance, the party spots the merchant's caravan within a half hour. Kiernan stops, looking perplexed, and then turns to Ash. "He's doubled his guards, at the least. And they look a great deal more ferocious."

Ash keeps on walking, not hesitating even for a moment. "We'll talk first," he says, conversationally enough, as he moves.

Starguard huhs. "Mirrors the increase of the party behind them. Convenient."

Andreth nods to Ash. "You do the talkin," he says, fervently. "I bet they'd talk circles around me."

Tilara says, "The test does seem to mirror the available force, doesn't it? If Ferg is here, this time we kill him out of the gate."

Moving faster now, the party soon catches up to the caravan. Stopping at hailing distance, Ash hails the travelers, who promptly stop. Eight crossbows are raised. Three swords are pulled out of their scabbards. A sleek, oily man turns his horse, and sits, watching the party.

"I realize this is probably bad timing," calls Ash, in a sociable tone of voice. "There's a contract you entered into that we wish to discuss buying off you." If this doesn't provoke a fight, he muses inwardly, there's hope.

The man looks, quizzically, at Ash. "A contract? Do tell?" His voice sounds sleek, like a well oiled crossbow, as the bolt is slowly nocked into place.

Ash says, "To be more specific, you just got married."

The man nods, smiling politely. "Indeed. Last night. To a most tender morsel. She is ..." He pauses slowly ... "She was a most charming virgin."

Andreth's eyes bulge, and his hands clench. "Tender morsel?" he mutters, sounding disgusted at the man's choice of words and glaring at the ground in front of him..

Starguard's hand drops down on Jellin's shoulder at that, clamping down solidly. This would not be the time for youthful fire.

Apparently it's just not sinking in. Ash grimaces a little as he becomes more direct. "We want her. Name your price, if you want to be paid when we take her."

Kiernan steps forward, his hands balled into fists. But he stops, as the realization sinks in that he bears the blame for every step of this farce.

Tilara mutters, "Warn us if you're going to shift, lad. It's disturbing to those who haven't seen it often."

The man snickers. "I count ... ten on your side. And of those, at least five are mere children. Whereas I have seasoned warriors. I think, boy, that we will accept no money from babes in the wood. I have my morsel, and I intend to feast for many years while she ggrows round with babe after babe."

Tilara reveals that unpleasantly wolfish grin. "What makes you think that you'll come through the fight, even if your men win?"

The steel song of Ash's arcanely-blessed weapon is heard in the air as he readies it, shaking his head. _Why do people always insist on doing it the hard way?_
