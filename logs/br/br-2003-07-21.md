The standoff grows tense, as Tilara grins a simple threat, and Ash simply bares his blade. On the far side, eight crossbows center on the sorceress and the warrior, while three blades have left their scabbards, as the mounted guards ready for combat. The merchant sits, hands on pommel, smiling.

Tilara judges the range - too far for concentrated flame, she decides, so she falls back to the flaming missiles. The harsh words of the spell ring out and two bolts fly, aiming for the merchant and one of his minions.

Ash advances forward, not quite running due to the demands of concentration - he has no intention of getting hit by crossbow fire. "Take cover behind me!" he advises to the younger members of the company.

Heeding Ash's words, his sword drawn, Kiernan follows right behind him. Meanwhile, the merchant pulls his horse to the side, prudently moving out of the way of combat. The swordsmen slide off their horses, formign a three man wall while the crossbowmen shoot and release.

Looking at one another, the Elk lads advance behind Kiernan's lead. Jellin stays back though, hefting the crossbow Ash has left behind and aiming at the merchant.

Ash dodges to one side, twisting out of the way and pushing Kiernan behind him with one callused hand to spare the boy a hit a well. He feels his arm wrenching a bit at the suddenness, and grits his teeth. _Can't let myself get hurt too soon,_ the warrior thinks, as he continues moving forward, flexing his arm a little.

Starguard moves out of the way of the incoming arrows, getting behind a thick tree before asking the Stars for aid. Blue magic flares as Starguard chants, the area seeming to fill with bright sparkles, distracting them, making them a little easier to hit.

Moving forward as he sees the bolts hitting Tilara, Stormy places a hand on her shoulder, and concentrates carefully, thinking of thick leather, strong steel, and the cover that armour can produce. Slowly Tilara begins to glow, before the spell settles in her bones, providing her protection from these pesky bolts.

Andreth stalks forward, stone-faced, alongside his more armored companion, hoping to help provide some cover for the rest of the troupe. As one of the feathered shafts speeds toward him, his arm sweeps round in an attempt to block its assault, but is a moment too late - he winces as the tip grazes his arm.

Tilara frowns as the merchant ignores her attack, and repeats the spell even as Stormy's chanting wraps a protective barrier around her. Again the fire-bolts streak across the field, this time both flying at the crossbowman she hit before as the merchant backs up out of her range.

Ash continues to advance, calm and unperturbed by the impending hail of feathered death, knowing only that he's guarding those behind him with his life, and somehow knowing that even death at this point would be acceptable.

Behind Ash, Kiernan leads the other Elks forward, his stance and his movement mirroring those of Ash, whom he has come to admire, possibly even to emulate. Intent on their advance, they ignore the bolots flying around them. It helps that most seem to be aimed at Ash and Andreth, and the sorceress behind them. Still, Jellin does offer counterfire of her own, accurately hitting one of the horses. The horse bucks for a moment, while the crossbow man struggles to regain control.

Starguard sets up in the crook of a tree, aiming his crossbow at the bowmen, hoping to return fire. His first shot, however, is wild.

Stepping in front of Jellin, to provide her some much needed cover, Stormy concentrates once more, strengthening his own protections. He looks around then, and directs young Anstar to take cover in the trees.

Andreth maintains his steady advance, not wanting to get too far ahead of everyone else and find himself alone against a small army. He takes another quarrel in the hip, but a second one is sent spinning into the underbrush with a well-timed sweep of his arm, and a small smile creeps across his scarred face.

Tilara nods in satisfaction as her first target falls and repeats the spell a third time. She moves forward this time, slowly decreasing the range to her opponents.

_Wilthorwen, Kenilthwen, your priest is here. Lurithain, the courage you embody is here,_ thinks Ash, not merely to himself, as he walks, dodging another stray bolt. _I intend to see another dawn. If you see any merit in what we do here, give us the outcome our beliefs have earned us, whatever it might be._ He presses forward, his body a shield for those behind him, unmindful of the nagging and uncomfortable warmth of blood slowly seeping into his armor.

Advancing, still behind the wall that Ash and Andreth present, the boys look on in wonder as arrows are ignored. Arrows that fly overhead, mind you, but still. Meanwhile, the three swordsmen are beginning to look a little worried as they form a wall of their own. Smiling, the merchant rests his hands on his pommel, still watching intently.

Starguard lines up to shoot again, but it's tough to get a clear shot from his cover, and the bolt goes whistling wide again.

Now moving to the side, so that he can see Starguard carefully, Stormy begins to move his hands in a new pattern, one that the party has never seen before. A pattern that hurts the eyes, and makes Starguard's bolts glow in their holster, adding an extra unexpected punch.

As he continues to advance through the whistling crossbow bolts, Andreth decides to harry them a bit. Dropping a lead ball into his slingshot, he whirls it over his head and lets the shot fly. Harmlessly into the distance, as it happens, but at least it gives them something more to occupy their attention.

Tilara sighs, her target still up. She continues to walk slowly forward and fires again, the bolts again arcing toward the crossbowman. _Now why is that greasy slimeball still smirking?_

Ash pushes forward, grim determination etched on his face.

Holding firm behind Ash, the Elks advance, looking worried when a single bolt hits Ash dead on. He seems to stumble for a moment, but advances as grimly as ever and the boys behind him can seemingly do nothing but follow. Worried, Jellin shoots again, this time hitting the fourth bowman's horse. The horse stumbles for a moment, causing the bowman to lose his balance. She smiles, as the man hurriedly slides off the horse.

Starguard isn't shooting well enough from the rear, and watching the crossbow bolt tear through Ash convinces him. Swiftly, he moves from his cover, keeping behind the fighters as he moves up.

Following in his tracks, and with Jellin behind him, Stormy moves up too. His quarterstaff is held ready to deal with any foe.

Andreth winces sympathetically at the dull _thunk_ of the bolt puncturing Ash's armor, and narrows his eyes, whirling his sling round and round. Another lead shot whistles through the air, passing cleanly between two crossbowmen.

Tilara continues her advance, setting her sights on another crossbowman. For the fifth time, the fiery levinbolts streak across the field.

Ash continues moving, Kiernan, Ulrin, Pierin, and Manlo right behind him, and his right arm trembles as it leaves his sword's handle to retrieve the healing potion he needs. The liquid burns in his throat for a moment as he swallows too fast, the healing magic struggling against the sudden burning in his leg. The empty flask falls and shatters on unmerciful ground as the warrior continues his advance.

Starguard continues to move up from the rear, getting closer to the direct fighting...

And behind him, Stormy follows, quarterstaff in hand, a spell at the ready ...

Andreth's face hardly creases as another crossbow bolt thuds into him - there is pain, to be sure, but it hasn't hit anything vital yet. Although perhaps it's thrown off his aim, as his third sling shot falls wide of the mark... but the enemy is closer, so much closer now. It won't be long before he can properly show them why you don't cross the White Company.

Tilara grins to herself again. _The merchant dropped back, but not far enough. Time to remind him what's going on here._ She sends another set of bolts out, again splitting them between the merchant and the damaged crossbowman.

Ash easily evades the crossbow bolt meant for him; perhaps it's his pain, or the surety of purpose, or simply a rapidly-advancing experience in dodging projectile weapons. Whatever it may be, he grunts to the youths behind him, who stay closely packed, mirroring his movements and finding security of their own.

Grunting a little with the effort, her arms straining, Jellin manages to loose another bolt, discomfiting both the crossbow man and the horse he was riding on, and distracting him for a few moments.

Starguard grins, and raises his hands to the heavens. With a crash he brings them down, and noise fills the clearing. A cacophony, centered on the bowmen and their leader, making a din that has many holding their hands over their ears, and horses spooked.

Stormy, advancing steadily at a run, begins to catch up with the lads. He smiles happily at the clap of thunder, and happier at the sight of three horses bearing their burdens away from the fight. He pauses, as the merchant is borne away too.

Tilara grunts as another bolt grazes her calf. Her eyes narrow, and she splits her last pair of bolts between two of the swordsmen. She follows the guttural syllables with a taunt. "Don't want you boys to feel left out!"

Andreth's eyes widen in awe, and he grins broadly at the grace of the gods. "What, you're still here?" he calls to the two bowmen left, and whirls the leather pouch over his head once more, winging another lead ball past their heads.

Ash moves into range of the swordsmen, anger written clearly on his face. His sword rises, batting away his foeman's defense in the first stroke; it comes in sideways as Ash regains his momentum, carving a horrid wound into the other's chest.

Spreading out from behind Ash, the elks advance, swords raised, encircling the swordsman Ash has singled out. Blows strike, and most of them miss, as the boys are clearly far from trained. But the one lucky blow manages to add the final injury for the swordsman, who collapses on the ground.

Ash brings his sword back as his opponent falls from the final strike delivered by the Elk, and his parry of another man's attack would have been completely successful if another crossbow bolt hadn't impacted his sternum. As it is, he grunts in pain as his arm wrenches, but the armor saves him from the worst of the blow.

Starguard turns and fires his loaded bolt, sending it streaking for a warrior's head. The shot is true, tearing a hole through the man's cheek and killing him, instantly.

Andreth grins as Starguard's crossbow bolt whistles across the field and drops one of the remaining bowmen, and howls a challenge at the swordsmen as he closes the distance with a flying kick to one of their heads.

Tilara breaks into a trot as she runs out of spells, closing on what's left of the warriors while she unlimbers her crossbow. _Now, where did that greasy sunnuvabitch go?_

Ash draws up, and one of the remaining swordsman is cut down, the big man's big blade simply ignoring the armor his opponent wears. Eyes burning, face furious, Ash pulls his weapon like the divine blade of God from his downed opponent and turns to the third man, who's already dropping his weapon and holding out his palms in a gesture of surrender.

Ash aims the bloody blade of his weapon at the remaining swordsman. "The new bride. We want her," he says, plainly and with conviction, even as he pants for air. The big fighter's eyes crinkle as each drawn breath brings another song of pain through his nerves, but he stays steady, awaiting an answer.

The swordsman nods, gulping visibly. "The big wagon, the one with the cover. She's inside. She's all yours, sir."

Tilara says, "Any traps?"

The man shakes his head, frantically. "No, ma'am; not that I know of. No, not at all." He pauses, then shakes his head again.

Ash saddles his weapon on one shoulder, resting the comforting weight of the blade on the metal of his armor. "Kiernan, you do the honors," he says slowly. "As for you," he adds, speaking to the captive, "you are free to go, once we've secured what we're here for. If you wish to take any part of the caravan away for your own, you are welcome to it as far as I am concerned."

The man nods, once, looking relieved, as Kiernan moves forward to the wagon. Parting the curtain in back, he looks, and pales. "Starguard!"

Tilara glances at Kiernan, worried, but she keeps her eyes open for returning horses. _Go see what's wrong, Mirra._

Starguard drops his crossbow and runs for the door. It's obvious what the problem is, his name was called first. It's how bad the problem is.

Andreth grits his teeth at Kiernan's anguished cry, and glares at the swordsman for a moment, before realizing that the guardsman doubtless has little to do with whatever the problem is. He rushes to Starguard's side, pulling the cleric's healing kit from his pack.

As the cat jumps into the wagon, she smells blood. Lots of blood. Behind her, Starguard looks in, and sees the cause of the blood. The girl looks lifeless, perhaps even death, her features pale, and waxen, her hair lank as it lies upon the pillow. Kiernan, climbin in, grabs for her hand, and then looks back. "Jellin! Don't let Jellin in!"

Andreth drops Starguard's healing kit onto the edge of the wagon, then turns, raising a hand toward Jellin, palm outstretched. "Don' get in the way, lass. It sounds bad, from the sound o' it, but I seen Starguard work _miracles_, not just today, 'n if there's anythin' he can do for 'er, 'e will."

Jellin pauses, outside the wagon, and bites his, her, lip. "It's just ..." She shakes her head. Behind her, Pierin and Manlo come to stand on either side of her.

Starguard gasps, and reaches down to lay his hands upon the poor child, calling forth his strongest magic from the stars to pull the girl back from the edge of death. Her wounds close, and the healing magic works wonders...but something is still wrong.

Meanwhile, Andreth mutters under his breath to himself, his face livid, remembering the merchant's words. "Tender morsel? What'd 'e do, chew 'er up?"

Ash cleans his sword, then sits down with a thump on the ground. He begins the laborious and somewhat painful process of extracting the crossbow bolts, and meshed armor, from his body. _What would we do without the healing of the gods?_ he asks himself. _Would we all die that much sooner? Is the life they give for the purpose of living for ourselves, or simply extending our usefulness to them?_

Slowly, the girl's eyes open. She looks up at Kiernan, and then turns away from him, looking instead at Starguard. "Sir?" As the moments pass, her eyes empty of their tears, and turn cold.

Starguard says, "It's alright, dear. It's over."

Moving closer, Anstar huddles close to Ash. He eyes the wagon, obviously wanting to follow Andreth, and yet horribly unsure. The wagon is already becoming crowded, after all, and ...

The girl nods, once. Kieran turns to look at Starguard, guilt writ large on his face. "Ellinor. I never knew ... I ..." He shrugs, helplessly, and backs out of the wagon, conceding that she clearly wants nothing to do with him.

Ash leans back, beckoning Anstar to help him as he begins to remove the sections of armor that were damaged in the attack. He winces as each piece is taken from his much-abused flesh, but he lets out a long sigh of contentment at last. "Anstar, see if there's some water about," he murmurs. "Starguard will need some soon, I think.."

Andreth drops to the ground outside the wagon, no longer bothering to conceal his sullen anger. "Thought I'd seen the last of that after Oak took me in." He glares in the direction of the merchant's retreat. "That damn bastard. If'n I ever see his face again..." A sharp _smack_ resounds, as the fist smacks into his callused palm.

Tilara hands Kiernan her crossbow as he climbs back out of the wagon. "This is not something you can help with, boy. I'll stay with her for now. You watch for that slimy merchant to return." She climbs up into the wagon and chases the boys out, except for Starguard. "It'll be all right, lass. He's gone."

Anstar looks at the swordsman, still kneeling, who licks his lips. "Second wagon, behind the trunks." The boy nods, ignoring the trunks, and hastens back with a small barrel of water for Ash.

Starguard says, "Come on, lass. This isn't the place for you." Starguard offers his hand, idly considering what time they have left, and the direction the grease-ball travelled.

Ash waves it off toward the wagon and Starguard, then grunts as he rises to his feet. He limps forward, moving to fetch his own water and wash his face and wounds from whatever remaining supply of water can be found. He stays silent, considering what might be going on inside, but a few moments of reflection trouble him enough to stop dwelling on it.

The girl looks at him, then looks around at the wagon, and shudders. Slwoly, testing every limb before she moves it, she moves to accept Starguard's hand. Her hand rests lightly, at first, and then grips his tightly as she looks in his eyes. "Will I be safe? Will you protect me? Swear! Swear, or I'll not leave."

Starguard winces. "I...I swear by the stars, young lady, that as long as you need and want my protection, I will protect you."

The girl nods, biting her lip, and then slowly moving forward. "I'm Ellinor." She looks around. "Can we leave, please?"

Starguard helps Ellinor from the carriage. "Let's. Is there anything of yours that you want to keep in the carriage?" he asks, gently.

Tilara calls Mirra to her as they leave the wagon, and the cat makes a leap to her shoulder. "Or anything of his, for that matter. He owes you suffering-price, I think."

Ash finally limps back toward his armor, and starts shrugging it on, bit by bit. He says nothing to Starguard, knowing that his pain is his own to bear until the priest sees fit to attend to him, and knowing that a larger issue must be dealt with first.

Starguard admonishes Tilara lightly. "I don't believe that she'll want anything of his, Tilara."

She turns around, and then shakes her head. "No. I'm not ... I don't. No." She climbs out slowly, still leaning on the cleric, and smiles at Tilara. "Hello." When Jellin advances, she looks at her older ... older sister? Her smile grows wistful, for a moment, as she tilts her head, looking at Jellin, noting the bow in her hands, the sword at her waist. She pauses, then looks more intently. "I've changed my mind; I claim bride price and wergild. Every coin he carries, every gem he treasures, every scroll he reads, every books he prizes."

Kiernan starts, hearing that voice, but a moment's thought is enough to halt him in his tracks. That and the way the girl, young Ellinor, keeps her back to him at all times. Instead, hearing her words, he nods and disappears into the wagon, returning after a few moments with three satchels containing books, and a small but obviously heavy chest.

Starguard nods. "Would you like to meet Jellin for a moment? Stormy and Anstar would like to meet you as well, I think. I need to go see to Ash over there for a moment."

Tilara gives a twisted grin. "Little beggar got away. I don't think he'll be stupid enough to come back, but we can give you everything else he has here."

Ellinor nods, looking at Jellin, and then smiles at Anstar, her expression wistful as she looks at Stormy, standing beside him. She looks down at her hands, twisting one of two silver bands, and offers it to Jellin who eventually accepts it.

Starguard moves over to the horses, rounding them up. If nothing else, these bastards can walk back to civilization. It'll be good for their souls. "Ellinor? See any horses you particularly like? I think we should have them."

Tilara waits until the loot has been gathered together and mutters the words that let her sense the presence of magic. "Those three swords, these bolts, those rings, that chest - very strong aura, that one - that armor, the barding, and something in here..." She rummages through a chest full of necklaces and jewelry, trying to find what is causing the glow.

Andreth stands off to one side, not really participating in the examination of the merchant's goods. Such things are of little import to him - what matters is that Ellinor is safe now. He stands guard now, making sure that she, and the rest of the people he cares about, remain safe.

Tilara mutters cuss-words in three languages as she searches through the jewelry box, pausing only to recast her detection cantrip, and then swearing some more. "Something's screwy here. Whatever it is is hiding from me."

Andreth looks off into the distance, and frowns, shading his eyes. "'Scuse me, folks," he says, clearing his throat, "but we prob'ly better get a move on." He points off into the distance, where a black cloud has appeared over the horizon.

Tilara nods. "And we've got a time limit. Let's pack up and move it out. We can sort this stuff at leisure, later."

After packing everything up on the remaining horses, the much larger group makes heavy tracks back to this morning's starting point. There Illath stands, ready to greet them, his eyes warm as he sees Jellin, cooling as he sees Kiernan's downcast visage, and cold as he notices the way Ellinor avoids Kiernan's presence entirely.

Kiernan looks at Starguard, sideways, and then moves up to stand with Ash. Behind him, the other Elks lineup, with the exception of Ellinor who stands with Starguard, and Jellin, who stands with her and holds Anstar's hand. Illath blinks, then looks to Ash for an explanation.

"We got attacked by some armed guards and we responded in kind," says Ash calmly. "We found someone dying, or at the very least in a bad way, in one of the wagons. She'd been abandoned by someone claiming to be her husband. She asked for our protection and we offered it. She is here with us now."

Illath nods. "The children have been found." He looks at the girl. "Who swears for her protection?"

Starguard says, "I do, Illath."

Illath blinks, looking again at Kiernan, then sighs. "I see." He shakes his head slowly. "I wonder if the Ritual will ever be the same ..." he mutters just loud enough to carry. Then he turns around. "We have your horses waiting, although it seems you've found new mounts. It's time to head for the Hall. The Circling commences tomorrow."

Tilara says, "The Circling? What does that involve?"

"That's when all the Changers gather, Tilara." Illath smiles. "That's when we find out partners, and our children move to their Clans when the Change comes upon them. That's when we trade our tales, and our news, and gather our new Talespinners ..."

Tilara twitches an eyebrow. "Interesting. Anstar is our child, though, Ellinor belongs to the Elk clan. Things got ... confused."

About to turn away to summon the horses, Illath turns back. "Confused, Tilara?" He looks at the child. "Yes. Yes, she belongs to the Elk, but ..." He sighs. "We will let the Tale Spinners and the Elders sort this out, I think. For now, all you need to know is that you have passed the tests." He looks at Ellinor. "Although I wonder where the elk dagger is."

Ulrin and Pierin step forward in unison. Ulrin holds his hand on a dagger stuck in his belt. "I carry it. She refused it."

Tilara says, "Let's hope it's in that chest.... if that greasy - Ah. Good."

Illath looks less happy than ever, but sighs. "Come, let us mount up."

The party moves more quickly, and in a few hours, just after moonrise, ride over the crest of a hill to a bowl of a valley below. The valley is crossed and filled with tents, some smaller, some larger. The center of the valley is dominated by a circular building that looks far more permanent. Illath points it out and names it the Hall, where everyone will gather in the morning. For now, though, the party will camp in these tents on the outskirts.

As they approach the two large tents they see Keorn stand by the flap of one, and a young paleskinned boy standing by the other, waiting to greet them.

Tilara waves. "Still in one piece, Keorn? Illath tells us we've broken all the traditional practices, but haven't technically managed to violate the rules."

Keorn raises one brow. "Yes. I've had a wonderfuly relaxing time of it, meeting so many relatives I never knew I had." He nods at the pale skinned boy beside him. "And meeting other suitors. This boy is Illannan. He will carry the elk dagger." He mutters, sotto voce, about the boy's impending death. Illath's lips tighten, but otherwise he ignores the Wolf.

Starguard nods. "Ah. That would explain his choice in Companions."

Andreth draws in his breath sharply, and glances at Anstar, looking slightly discomfited.

Tilara chuckles. "Keep an open mind, Keorn. We've teamed up with the Elks a few times now, to our mutual benefit. It might be time to change the traditions for the last part, too."

Keorn smiles at the White Company. "Still, I see you've passed the tests, and all in good order. Splendid, splendid. The old man chose wisely after all." He pauses at Tilara's words, and then smiles widely. "Come, inside, let us feast and party, and tell me of your tales." He bows to Illannan, bidding him goodnight, and holds the tent flap open, inviting the White Company inside.

Tilara nods. "Sounds good to me. We skipped lunch. So, where to start...."

_This is why we're together,_ muses Ash to himself. _And why Keorn isn't a riddle or an obstacle to us anymore. It's because we put our lives at risk on his behalf, that I feel closer to him._ He winces a little, still, as the pain fades away under the ministrations of magic. _Maybe we'll all suffer more, but we'll be stronger for it.. but not tonight, thankfully._

Starguard mumbles, "What have the Stars gotten us into. More children for us to protect, the Elk group far too young... I wonder who Samaela will choose."

The White Company explains to Keorn what has happened; factually, formally and directly. Whatever virtues or vices this gruff man may exhibit, an appreciation for florid prose does not seem to be one of them, and Tilara recounts the party's adventures with this in mind, as an entertainer knowing her audience and expertly playing to it. As sleep claims the campsite at last, the benevolent and secret stars shine down from the night sky, twinkling as though winking to each other at some secret plan only they can know.
