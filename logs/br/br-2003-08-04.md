# Birthright 2003-08-04

As the party advances on the last tent, the tent of the cats, Stormy begins to look a little worried. Perhaps merely because of the distance; the cats have decided to house their Suitor in an isolated hollow, placing it both within and without the general camp. As with the wolves, a single man guards the tent, although he carries no weapons and is currently sitting, leaning against the tent post and admiring the party's approach.

Ash explains briefly the White Company's request to speak to the Suitor, as before.

The man sniggers. "We've heard the tale. Emissaries of peace. Useless nithlings, hoping to lull us into complacency. But come, I am delaying you. Step right in, Kalaecian is expecting you." He pulls out a short stick from behind him, and uses it to lift up a corner of the tent flap.

Stepping into the tent, the party is plunged into darkness. From somewhere, straight ahead, they can hear a dry chuckle, resonating through the cavernous interior.

Ash blinks for a moment, then steps forward. "We seek audience with the Suitor of the Cat Clan," he announces. "It is considered polite among us to show one's face. Either customs differ here, or we are mistakenly in the cave of the Bat Clan." And with that bold pronouncement, he waits.

The chuckle lengthens, turning into a rumbling purr. "A mighty little kitten, come wih its claws unsheathed ... we must admire him, mustn't we, my friends?" A momentary dazzle, a flare of light, and around the tent a multitude of lamps are lit at one and the same time.

As the light settles down into a comfortable glow, the party can see a single man, sprawled on a pile of furs, his hand resting on the head of a boy, if boy is the right word. Both would probably stand six feet tall, or taller, and their shoulders can carry a world, let alone this little courtship. The smaller of the two looks up, eyes blinking rapidly, before changing fluidly into a grace mountain lion, before stalking off and watching from a corner, tail twitching.

Ash inclines his head. "I thank you. We are the White Company, Companions of Keorn of the Wolves, as doubtless you have heard. We come to ask that you take an oath, for the good of yourselves and the Changers as a whole." He straightens up, then, the hint of obsequious politeness gone, and is again strength and determination in voice and face. "We ask that the Suitor, and his company, take up no arms tomorrow, except that they be in mortal fear of their life." He pauses to let this sink in.

The man smiles. "You ask much, little man, although we had not intended ... " He pauses to admire his long, sharp fingernails. "We had not intended to carry weapons. We carry the dagger, of course, but that is merely a toothpick."

Tilara looks around, distractedly interested in how the Cats managed the trick with the lamps.

Andreth lets a small smile cross his own face, in acknowledgment of the cats' preference against armament. A small point of common ground with him... but probably too small to be of consequence.

"You understand my meaning, being a wise man," Ash follows evenly. "Offense may be given with more than swords and axes, or even toothpicks. We wish for the fittest leader to be chosen, not merely the greatest warrior, or perhaps the most treacherous betrayer, as the case may be - I cannot say, being unfamiliar with the Trials. The other three Clans have assented to this oath. They will assuredly cut down whoever attacks them - this they have made clear to me. I request that you join them in this resolution, and prove your fitness and superiority." Big words, from a man who's most often heard such proclamations, or read about them. Now they come from his own mouth. They taste strange to Ash as they roll off his tongue, and he again examines the queer sensation of wielding authority by words.

Admiring his nails one last time, the man merely smiles again. "Come. Sit. Be my guests; let me not be remiss in the simple courtesies of life." He snaps his fingers, and from beyond the curtain dishes float into the room, all containing goblets of amber liquids.

Ash gestures to his companions, and steps forward to sit as directed. He sees no reason to offer offense to people he's asking a favor from - just common sense, not any fancy diplomatic technique.

Starguard clears his throat. "Thank you, but no. It's not wise to drink in the middle of a test like this. Dulls the senses. An old man thanks you for the furs, though."

Stormy steps forward, sitting crosslegged on a fur, and sniffing the contents of the goblet cautiously. He looks at Tilara, considering her lead, then sniffs again, and smiles. "It's Firewater, Tilara. Breath of life." He takes a tiny sip, and smiles as he enjoys it.

The warrior's eyes appear over the rim of the goblet as he finishes his drink, as he and his companions rest somewhat comfortably on the furs provided. His eyes are still firm, and steadily focused on this, the last Suitor of the last Clan. He makes no further mention of his request, of course, and only periodically breaks to look from face to face in the White Company, seeking answers among the wordless looks of his friends.

Andreth bows graciously and takes a seat upon the furs. As his goblet reaches him, he eyes it uncertainly and glances at his companions, torn between the desire to be courteous, and the suspicions he's learned on the road and before. As Ash partakes, though, he breathes a small sigh and samples the scotch himself.

The man, catching one of the goblets for himself, smiles. "A toast! I, Kalaecian, mighty Cat, will honour and salute all those whom will die tomorrow. Those that live by the sword will die by it, those that live by the Prophecy will perish by it, those that understand will ... " He smiles. "Well, those will likewise have to die for us to profit."

"May you profit without death," answers Ash, raising his own goblet in answer. "Living allies are more beneficial than buried rivals."

Tilara takes advantage of the toast to mutter briefly over her glass. Just in case.

Kalaecian smiles at Ash. "We can only profit when we exit the test; let those who fear death refuse to enter, and their lifes will no longer hang in the balance."

Ash nods to that - no obvious challenge, only the bald statement of the test of bravery implicit in the Trial, a fact already known. He drinks again, smiling slowly.

Andreth smiles and raises his glass quietly, nodding in turn to Ash and Kalaecian. The thought that the accuracy of prophecy is seldom so simple a question as right or wrong crosses his mind, but not his lips - although a swallow of whiskey does pass the other way.

"Tonight, gentlemen ... and lady," as he turns to toast Tilara, "cautious ladies indeed, who fear for simple poisons ... Tonight, we shall feast. I was about to dine; will you join me in my repast? I have heard tales of such outsiders as you are, and there is still much to be learned before the morning's early Dawn."

Tilara nods and sips her glass, grinning sheepishly. "We've had some bad experiences with such in the recent past. No offense intended." She clears her throat. "If the test needs to go that way. Our understanding is that no one is quite sure what happens in the final stage of the Test except those who have gone through it. We merely suggest that the assumption that it is a death-match may not be correct, and ask that you not go in with preconceptions. If it is a deathmatch, unequivocally - then we have no real objection to your trying to win."

Starguard says, "Trying to win, mind. Objections to you actually winning is another matter entirely."

Again, Kalaecian smiles at Tilara. "It is said that the young lack wisdom, for they heed no the tales of their Ancestors. It is said that the old lack wisdom, for they have forgotten how to hear the voices of the Ancestors." He pauses, admiring the goblet, turning it in his hand. "But there are those of us, who are neither old, nor young, who remember our Ancestors, and would have words with them ..."

Tilara chuckles at the catlord. "I would certainly agree. Age in this case .... is a state of mind."

Ash smiles in Kalaecian's direction. "We cannot in good conscience celebrate anything yet - our mission is not yet complete. When we have extracted four sworn oaths, I feel sure we can relax. But until then..." And he pauses, questioningly, looking at his host. "You understand, of course, the need to achieve one's goals even at great cost and forebearance of leisure, sir."

"Well, then, lad, let it not be said that Kalaecian does not feast his visitors well." The man smiles, muscles rippling as his loose coat slides off his shoulders. A second finger snap, and plates laden with a variety of delicate finger foads float in, each dish offering itself to every guest in turn. "I understand, lad, I understand. But can you not see, my hands are tied? The Ancestors who command me ... who live within me ... they will have me enter, and complete the Ritual as I have done so many times before. Will you deny me that?"

Ash thinks for a moment, then shakes his head. "A leader is one who commands. A follower is one who obeys. This is what I have always been taught." And this, no less a challenge than a slap in the face with an iron mailed gauntlet would be, hangs in the air between the two men.

Tilara blinks even as she takes a dainty from a dish. "As _you_ have done before? What do you mean by that?"

The man smiles, sideways at Ash. "And what is a man who is commanded by his spirit?" He shrugs, turning to admire Tilara. "Why, lady, as I said, I am neither a callous youth who listens not, nor an ancient elder who forgets the art of hearing. I am but in my prime, as I was before, as I will be again."

"He is not a man. He is a beast. Instinct and spirit are for the wild creatures of the wood. Men are greater," replies Ash coldly, looking from face to face among the White Company again.

Kalaecian smiles. "You mistake; lad. You listen, like so many of our youth, and hear only words. You miss meanings. The spirit is not instinct, not is it that which brings the wild creatures to life. It is the soul, the heart, the totem that binds us to our gods." He shrugs. "But hear what you will, child. In the morning, four will enter, and one at least shall live." He smiles. "The cats have survived before, and we - I - shall survive again."

Tilara just twitches a quizzical eyebrow at Ash when he looks in her direction. _Let's not push things too far._

Starguard says, "So you have done this before then? Are you born twice, or exceptionally long-lived?"

Shaking his head at Starguard, Kalaecian smiles. "Neither. I have not been through the trials before, in this body, but when I called to my Ancestors, they did come to me, and now I am One, and I contain Multitudes."

Andreth's brow furrows. "If ye set no store by prophecy, what makes ye so certain ye'll survive this time?"

Starguard says, "Interesting. You are sure it is the Ancients, I suppose, and not some foreign power doing a good imitation?"

Lifting a simple dainty, the man carefully considers it, before sliding it into his mouth and slowly chewing. After he swallows, he turns to Andreth. "Ah, but while prophecy is fuzzy on what happens in the Trial, memory is clearn, and clean. When our Ancestors conferred, they did send to me the spirits of those who succeeded. We have trained for half a generation, knowing this day would arrive. Where the Elks send an untrained boy, the Wolves a foreigner, and the Hawks a simple fighter ... where these men have been found on short notice, we have planned. How can we fail?"

Ash laughs softly at this. _We came to seek the Suitor. But we found only a messenger,_ he thinks to himself, derisively.

Tilara says, "Foreigner is a bit harsh. Keorn is a true Changer, and has many skills of his own. We will see what will happen. _Is_ the final trial merely one of combat, then?"

Kalaecian shakes his head. "Nay. Not combat. There should be no fighting, unless a hot head pulls a weapon. But there will be tests of wit, and cunning, and guile. And, of course ..." He smiles. "Those tests can only be completed by those who are of sound mind, as well as body."

Tilara nods. "This is ... good to know. So you are saying that you would not be the first to attack your fellow suitors, I take it."

Kalaecian places a hand over his chest. "I will cause no bodily harm, grievous or otherwise, unless I be stricken first. My emissary, likewise, is a man of peace."

Rising from the furs and offering a low bow indeed, Ash offers wordless contrition by the gesture. "Please forgive our departure, sir," he says, as he rises again. "We find no fault, however small, in either your ambition for the Trials, nor your hospitality toward those who by all right would be representatives of your rival. I wish you a good night, and all the fortune that is yours by right tomorrow." A somewhat diplomatic ending, and also a studied repetition of a phrase Ash heard through a door when younger, in a meeting between merchants. He wastes only a moment silently wondering how it will be received, and with that he walks out of the tent and into the night, satisfied that the White Company has at least accomplished something. Whether good or ill remains to be seen.

The remaining members of the White Company stand as well, each bowing in their turn to the Suitor for the Cats with the graciousness they find fitting, then following Ash through the flap of the tent. The party convenes again outside, and passes the long distance to the Wolf tent in relative silence, where Ash relates to Keorn the guarded success of the night's endeavour.

Listening, Keorn nods. "So; you hold three oaths, and now hold mine. I will not shed the blood of others until I see harm befalling me and mine."

Ash smiles and nods slowly in assent. "Whoever comes out victorious, I'm at least satisfied," he says, breathing a soft sigh of relief. And with that the big man almost collapses to the ground, laying out on his back and moaning in evident physical and emotional exhaustion.

Tilara says, "It does seem that the Cat believes it is not simply a battle. Let's get some sleep. We may need our wits about us in the morning."

Keorn smiles, watching Ash collapse. "You have done well. It is time, I think, for every one of us to take a nap. The dawn will come soon enough."

Andreth nods quietly in response. "Hope it's enough... or if not, that we c'n make it up tomorrow. Seems an uneasy truce... but time'll tell, I suppose. An' now we all need our rest," he adds, yawning hugely.

Ash's face is covered by his hands, as his fingers rub the bridge of his nose, and his temples. "Right. Sleep sounds like a great idea." And with that, he wastes no time in seeking it.

Starguard nods. "Get to bed, everyone. I'm just going to have a short walk before bed." Without waiting for a response, he slips out of the tent.

A few minutes later, he returns. "Safe in Jellin's arms," he mumbles, before turning in himself. It's going to be a long day tomorrow.

Tilara chuckles to herself at Starguard's comment, and wraps herself in her bedroll. "Goodnight."

Come the morning, the company finds themselves streaming into the center of the campsite, along with all the other Changers who have congregated here. Anstar and Keorn are led away, and the White company, as one band of honoured companions, are given front row seats.

Andreth attempts to follow Anstar, but two Changers politely but firmly bar the way, shaking their heads silently. Sighing, the monk simply catches Anstar's eye and nods. "I ha'nt forgotten me oath, Anstar. I'll protect ye, if I'm able. You do yer best for Keorn, y'hear?" He glances coolly at the Changer guards, and returns to rejoin the rest of the Wolf Companions.

Starguard watches carefully for Ellinor and Jellin, making sure they too are here on time.

Looking worried, Anstar nods and follows Keorn. Soon, the four Suitors are gathered in the centre, each flanked by his dfagger bearer. Four daggers are presented as evidence of the Suitors' bona fides. Then an old crone steps forward, to address the eight Changers. "These are the words of Samaela the Mother, these are the words of the Far Seer Hawk, These are the Choices Samaela the Maiden will make and bring forth." She pauses, looking around the Circle.

"Rare is the Circling where Outsiders gather, rarer the Circle that honours these folk. Still they are seated, serving the Wolf clan, serving the Emperor's personal man." She turns around, looking over the crowds. Her spine straightens, her voice sharpens, as accusation begins to leech into her words. "These are the ones who serve the murderer, these are the ones who deal with the weak, these are the ones who follow and wonder ... These are the ones who the Circle bespeak." She steps forward, dancing up to where the White Company sits, and waves a rattle. "Speak then, ye outcasts, ye unChangerkin. Tell us your thoughts, and your mind, and within. Bring out the words, for by Far Seer's command, we listen, and hearken, here where ye stand."

Tilara stands up to confront the accuser, bowing to her a bit sardonically. "Thank you for that introduction." She turns to face the crowd. "I'd like to start with a bit of prophecy that we only learned about ourselves a short time ago. 'A Man will come, and bear a dagger. His companions will come, and some will stagger. None shall fall, and none shall Change, And all that comes to them be strange, For the lack of wisdom left unshared, Have left this party unprepared. Let the Maiden choose, Let the Suitors loose, Children should not suffer. The elders are tougher.'"

The crone dances forward, chuckling, catching Tilara by the chin. "Prophecies ye speak, and sing, now the wisdom you must bring."

Andreth rises to his feet slowly and faces the elder Changer, meeting her gaze firmly. He speaks not of prophecy, though it may be wove around him, but of the thoughts of his heart, and the reasons for his presence here at the Circling. "We came here b'cause it was asked of us, madam. But we stayed the course b'cause our honor demands it of us, and b'cause it grieves us to see harm done 'less it be truly needed." His expression hardens subtly. "'n if ye think the Emperor is naught but a common murderer, I say ye know him less well than ye might believe."

The crone turns around, dancing. "Ah, but the father of a murderer is a murderer, does he not see his son denounced. The leader of a clan is a murderer, sees he not his tribesman denounced. A son, the eldest son at that, strikes fear and fury in our hearts, and kills the smallest of our babes, and still the emperor sends an emissary as a Suitor." She shakes her rattle, turning back to face Tilara again in this dance of words.

Tilara nods. "I know. Talk is cheap. But if there is truth in that prophecy, then we are part of it. Prince Lurin is ... a problem. What would you have the Emperor do? If he denounces his son, he starts a war that will kill thousands of his subjects. Can you not accept his offer to start the healing?"

Starguard says, "It is hard for any father to act against his own son. Even if he is wrong."

The crone spits on Starguard's words, the spittle landing just before his feet. "Murderer, I denounce him. Murderer is Lurin. The spirits of the babes cry out for vengeeance. The spirits of the mothers slain in pain and fear and suffering cry out in anguish. The spirits of the hunters ... hunt." She nods at Tilara. "You are a part of the prophecy; you speak where few may speak, and are heard when few are heard. The Suitors themselves wait upon your words."

Tilara nods. "Aye, Lurin is a murderer. He attacks his brothers as well as you, and we fear that he may try to kill his own half-sister. But the Emperor cannot denounce him as easily as you or I can - his words carry too much weight and too many would be needlessly crushed were he to speak unwisely - or even if he were to put honor too far ahead of wisdom. But he is doing what he can. He respects you, you realize. Why else would he send an emissary?"

Andreth's expression does falter at the crone's words, for in his heart he feels they are well spoken, and he shakes his head slowly as his companions attempt to answer the charge. He sighs, not wanting to gainsay his friends, but feels that he must. "How c'n there be peace, Tilara, if Lurin _keeps_ killin' their people? What else c'n the Emperor do then, but denounce him? For else the peace'll die afore it breaks earth." He turns to the crone once more. "I'm a subject o' the Emperor, not 'is lord. But if it were up t'me, I'd see yer accusation brought to Lurin's doorstep, if'n I had to do it myself. What he's done to yer people is _wrong_." The monk's hands bunch into fists briefly, then relax. "O'course, I'm a simple man. There may be a better way. But by the Flame, _somethin_ must be done."

The crone watches Andreth intently, a smile creasing her withered lips. Then she looks at the rest of the party. Still silently, she steps back a pace, as though waiting for further words.

Starguard says, "Nothing has, though. Many men too die on Lurin's borders, trying to stay his over-reaching ambitions. A war against him is already in process, but is quiet, with raids and forts and counter-strikes. Would more die if we all fought at once, or over a hundred years?"

Tilara nods. "Aye. Something. Clever subtlety, or blunt honor, is the question. So far, the Emperor has tried to work subtly. The time for that may be passing. For what it's worth, I agree with you, Andreth. _Something_ will be done."

"I'm Ash of Lainsborough," says that worthy as he rises, in a voice strong, more accustomed to bellowing challenges or threats than oration. "These are my friends. We follow Keorn, on account of a geas we swore in exchange for the resurrection of one of us. His death was brought about by wolves - Changers." He pauses for breath. "We've asked what we've asked of the Suitors, and we've done what we've done, for our own reasons. Mine is because of my family. Back home, land used to be given out by lords and rulers. Where I come from, land is claimed by family, and run by family. Everybody works together, because everyone is of the same blood." He pauses again, letting the last two words ring out.

"If you're looking for wisdom, we don't have it. But," says Ash, smiling. "We've spread ripples throughout a pond, here, just by taking action, and speaking to people. Just by telling people what we want, and working to earn what we asked for. If you seek justice against Lurin, or any other man, prince or pauper, follow our example." And with this he waits.

The crone looks at Ash, and smiles slowly and thoughtfully. "Wisdom indeed, from young and ..." She looks at Starguard. "From less young." She takes a step back. "Wisdom that earns you this; you will set the test of wit." She turns around, and beckons, and a young maiden steps forward, gowned in a cloak of supple leather, that covers all from the neck down. The leather is finely worked, quilled, and dyed, and ripples with her every motion.

"Here is the Maiden, who seeks out her Suitor. Here are the Suitors who seek now to woo. Here are the ones whom the prophecies warn of, and speak of, and praise, each in turn." The crone leads Samaela forward. "Come, set the test. Samaela the Maiden has chosen, decreed, decided that your words today she will heed."

The party confers, gathering together in whispered discussion. Winds blow and breath is taken and released as the White Company speaks within its own membership. At last, Tilara rises, clearing her throat and addressing the crone, and Samaela. "We're ready."
