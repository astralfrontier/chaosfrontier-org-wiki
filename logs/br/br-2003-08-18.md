# Birthright 2003-08-18

The Hall erupts into loud and occasionally puzzled applause as Samaela chooses each of the three Suitors in turn. Finally, as Illannan moves to stand next to his new bride the crone leads the last cheer and clap. Then Samaela disappears into her alcove, and the Suitors disperse, to be welcomed by their companions. Only the cats glower at her departure, huddled in a quiet corner.

Soon the spirits flow as loosely as the tongues, and hearts give rise to songs of bravery, valour, and hope, as the Changers host an impromptu party of massive proportions. The kind that guarantees everyone a hangover by morning, merely by being in the same area. Breaths are that alcohol laden, you see.

Anstar and Jellinor and the Hawk carrier celebrate in their own quiet way, as they celebrate vows of unexpected kinship. None of them expected to ever have siblings. True siblings, that is. All of them remain a little confused about the circumstances of their birth and early life, but they all remember the loneliness.

The morning dawns fresh and fair, the birds singing - until some kids head out after them with sling shots - and the sun shining - until someone pulls the shutters shut.

There are many hang overs, most of which pass unnoticed as people sleep the day away. Masses of huddled Changers, some still wearing clothes, don't begin to shift until late afternoon.

Starguard cracks his eyes open, and groans. "I'll say this for our hosts... the stuff they brew surely has a kick." He pulls himself up into a kneeling position and says his morning prayers - hoping the Twins will understand his tardiness, under the circumstances.

Tilara gets up at her usual time - which is normally quite late by other's standards, but today is quite early. She snags some leftovers from the previous evening's revelry and wanders off to find Starguard, coming upon him just as he's finishing his morning devotions. "Don't you usually do that at dawn?" She grins and sits down beside him. "So, shall we call the Abbey?"

There's a groan as a few spare furs move, and a very Ash-like grunt of pain as the pelt stirs a little more. A callused hand fumbles its way from beneath the covering, pawing around. "Water," croaks the voice of the warrior, now thoroughly defeated by his alcoholic adversary.

Starguard raises his head once more, wincing slightly. "I do, usually... and then, usually I'm _awake_ at dawn." He sighs. "Yes, we had better... I think they'll want the full report now. Liowen will not be pleased if he got the scribes together for nothing."

Almost bouncing, as he recovered quickly and easily from the alcohol he didn't drink, Stormy brings over a couple of waterskins, sloshing to the brim.

Tilara nods. "So, let's contact 'em while everyone is sleeping it off and bring him up to date. You give him his report, and I'll nudge you when you leave something out."

The hand seizes on a skin as soon as it's presented, making a hasty retreat. Ash throws off the fur as he greedily drinks, then wipes his sweaty face with one hand. "Report?" he grunts. "Has that no good bastard called us demandin' anything else yet?" He's apparently not fully conscious. Or is he?

Tilara grins at Stormy and his cheerful demeanor. "So what _did_ you do last night, youngling? You obviously weren't drinking much."

Stormy smiles at Tilara. "I was spending some time with Ellinor and Jellin, and Anstar. We've ..." He pauses, blushing, and digs a toe into the ground. "We've kinda made a sorta compact kinda like the White Company only smaller?"

Andreth hauls himself out of his own bedroll, his countenance (never the most appealing in the first place) definitely the worse for his own hangover. He blinks owlishly in the light of day, and yawns. "Wozza... time t'report in already?"

Tilara nods. "I thought you might. Strange beginnings for all of you, I think." She looks at the young sorceror quizzically. "Though I must confess, I wonder what the young Elk shaman-to-be saw in you to claim a double shield as your totem...."

Ash makes movement to rise to his feet, and accomplishes a third of his goal. He drinks heavily from the water-skin, wiping moisture from his lips after, and grins. "I saw some pretty crazy things myself last night, Tilara. Whatever the kid and his friends do, I'm sure it'll be good."

Tilara nods to Ash. "I think so, too. This whole thing looks like it will be good for the Changers."

Sormy shakes his head. "I don't know. He said he couldn't explain; apparently he'd never seen that totem before." Stormy shrugs. "So someday, when I'm grown up ..." He smiles. "After I've married, and settled down, and raised a family ..." He doesn't seem remotely eager to find out just now.

Tilara smiles fondly. "Is that what you'd like to do someday? It takes at least two, after all. You're not planning to leave us just yet, I hope?"

Stormy looks sideways at Tilara, blushing up to the roots of his hair. Completely bereft of speech, he looks at the crystal. "Time to ... ummm ... make ... ummm ... our report?" He squeaks out.

Tilara chuckles and nudges Starguard. "Get on with it, already..."

Starguard chuckles good-naturedly, and nods, tapping the crystal ball with its hammer. Much time passes, as the full details of the events of the past several days are conveyed to Liowen and the waiting scribes. Finally, the crystal dims, and Starguard breathes a sigh of relief, rubbing his throat. "I'll have one of those waterskins if you don't mind, lad," he murmurs hoarsely, reaching to take one from Stormy.

Tilara grins, and pulls a couple of her throwing knives out and juggles them just for the fun of it for a few moments. "And we're now our masters of our own fates again, duty to the geas discharged. What say ... we go talk to Sameala?"

As the crystal dims, Keorn and Illath stagger over to join the party. Sitting down abruptly, Keorn swipes the last of the water skins and drinks lustily before wiping his mouth. Illath collapses beside him, and both look atthe White Company. "Well ... we thank you." Keorn sounds grudgingly relieved. "You've done well for the Emperor." Illath smiles, too, enigmatically. "So; what shall your plans be now? In the morning, Samaela weds. She asks that you attend."

Tilara says, "We will, of course. Wouldn't miss it for the world, even if we're not forced to it any more. After that? Probably back to the capitol, and see if His Nibs has any more assignments for us."

Tilara looks at Keorn. "How about you? Are you going to stay on here, or come back and see if the Emperor can get you fixed up a bit?"

Keorn nods, slowly, while Illath looks around the Hall. "You have the freedom of the Changer lands, by Samaela's word." Keorn looks troubled. "Although already there are rumours that the Cats will not accept this choosing. As one of Samaela's counselors, I will stay. Illath has promised to help me relay messages to the Emperor. He hopes, as I do, that we may be able to broker a peace."

Tilara Frowns. "I was afraid of that. The Cats are used to winning this challenge? Or are they simply upset that their champions were killed?"

Illath shrugs. "The Cats, especially Kalaecian, were convinced they were invincible." He looks sideways at Keorn and then shrugs. "Far Hawk disagreed."

Tilara snorts. "_No one_ is invincible. Especially if they believe that they are."

"I hate to kick a man when he's down," remarks Ash. "We'll give the Cats a wide berth, unless obligated to deal with them directly."

Illath nods at Tilara. "Indeed. So it seems. The point, for no, is moot although there is no doubt trouble afoot. Hence, while you have the freedom of our lands, we wonder if you're planning on using it ... We would of course welcome you. You have brought much wisdom into our lands."

Tilara nods to the Hawk, deeply enough to approach a bow. "Thank you. We brought a fresh perspective, at least, with Far Seer's help. And for now - I think you are right. Let's not push our welcome until the Cats have had a chance to calm themselves."

Starguard likewise bows to Illath from his seated position. "Besides... where might we go, I wonder? We are still strangers to your lands, and so you'll understand that we might not know _how_ to avail ourselves of your welcome."

Illath smiles at Starguard. "My son and my daughter both have volunteered to act as your guides, should you ever desire it." He winces for a moment. "Ellinor will not leave our tent, and speaks only with Jellin, but in time, we hope to help her heal." He sighs. Heavily. Twice. "Sometimes the simple solution ... isn't." Keorn shakes his head in agreement, and then looks at the party. "once the situation stabilizes, I would be pleased to travel with you. There is much these lands I have not seen yet. The lands range from the ice fields in the north to the seas in the south, no matter the claims of Luriel's get."

Ash thinks for a moment. _Tormel would murder us..._ "Are there maps of the region?" he asks carefully.

Tilara looks intrigued by a sudden thought. "I have a feeling you'd make better neighbors than Luriel, too...." She nods as Ash makes his request.

Illath blinks. "Maps? Not ... not precisely." He smiles. "We have little parchment, and less need for maps. We sing the songs of travel, the songs of the mountains and the valleys. We keep our maps in song and word."

Ash nods again. "Would any take offense if we created some, on our own, then?" He turns to the White Company, and grins. "We'll recoup every bent copper we spent on that old coot, if we do this right," he comments, a question in his eyes. _How about it?_

Illath shrugs. "Not in the slightest. As long as you don't mark the holy places, or the secret passes ..." He looks at Keorn, one eyebrow raised in inquiry. Keorn, in turn, smiles diplomatically, and mumbles something about trusting the company.

Tilara says, "We'd be very poor guests if we didn't let you vet the maps before we showed them to anyone else, Illath. You have our word on that."

Illath nods at Tilara. "Thank you. We trust you, but you do not know always which are the secrets, and my son is young ..."

After asking Illath for help identifying the magical items they've found in their questing, the company spends the evening with a wizened old man who looks the goods over carefully. Sniffing, he offers to have the answers in a few days. The gods like to talk, but hate to be bothered, as he explains, and this is bothering magic. Finally closing the tent door behind you, his muttering descends into a low singsong chorus that lasts for some time.

Tilara chuckles after they're away from the tent. "An interesting way to put it."

But no matter. In the fresh morning, the Changers gather once more, to celebrate Samaela's wedding. Radiant in a silken gown that bears the devices of all the clans, Samaela stands beside her new husband, Illannan, as the wedding is consecrated by a young man whose eyes are as old as the skies. The wedding is peaceful, even the Cats taking place at their point in the ceremony. A ceremony that has obviously been revised for the presence of the two new Councillors, resplendent in furred and feathered cloaks, as they stand behind the married couple.

Behind the counselors, the single maids are already whispering and giggling, measuring both men for a wedding ceremony of their own in the near future, if at all possible.

There's a gentler feast, less given to excesses of food and drink, celebrating the new youngsters, and the new couple. Songs are sung, stories are told, poems are declaimed ...

After the wedding festivities have concluded, the Changers slowly begin to disperse. The party hangs around, hoping to learn what these magical items of theirs are. After several days, they're summoned back to the tent, where the items are divided into three piles. The first, smallest pile, he shrugs and spits, as he gestures at it. "Cursed. No way to treat a sword." The middle pile, which contains most of the items, he looks no more impressed by. "The bastard and the broadsword are a little sharper, and make you a little more adept, but ... eh. The barding will adapt to suit any steed. I think it's been used to tame a wild Hawk in the past, based on some of the scratches."

"The crossbow bolts have been enchanted, but only minorly so. Simple lightning bolts, much like the bolts you carry." The man spits again. "And that shield brings little blessing to the dead, for all it bears Ungfallen's device. It calls the dead back to his Halls, you see, to sleep once and for all." Then he stops, and turns to the last pile, which contains the plate mail, as well as the second shield and the second ring. "The plate mail ... it's enchanted, and the enchantment's not evil, but I'm not too sure beyond that. It weighs less than it should though, and will allow a fighter much movement." He holds up the shield, balancing it on his palm. "As will the shield. It weighs no more than a feather, but our greatest warriors could not dent it." He drops the shield, which lands with a heavy thud. "And lastly this ring. The gods refused to speak. It's not evil, and is certainly blessed, but ... beyond that I don't know."

Having learned much of what they hoped to learn, the party collected all but the cursed items, and walked to Illath's tent. One of the few Changers who stayed behind, he had lent the group his smaller tent for shelter and now welcomes them into his tent. Ellinor, in a corner, sits talking quietly with Jellin, and doesn't even notice the group coming in, so wrapped up is she in her conversation.

Ash for one waits patiently. Although he vividly remembers the pain of the assault in which the proposed items were gained, he's aware of the all too hidden wounds received by the party's young host. He's content to be recognized in due course.

Tilara nods to Starguard and heads in the direction of the pair. "Jellin? Ellinor? May we talk to you?"

Jellin looks up, eyes narrowing, then opening wide, as she smiles. Ellinor, in contrast, looks up and then shrinks away, before steeling herself. Perhaps Jellin's hand, now firmly clasping hers, is what is giving her strength.

Ash steps forward, inclining his head a little. "The White Company proposes to survey the Changer lands, at least briefly and temporarily," he says. "We've been told that the Cat Clan may bear emnity to any who they feel thwarted their ambitions. Hence some of the martial goods recovered from the.. from the wagon might be of service to us. We are here, rather than out equipping ourselves, because your claim is foremost." He pauses, clearing his throat, for a moment uncertain of how to proceed. "Although we think of our own safety, as any reasoning men must, we will not prefer it over your right. We come to ask - what is your wish, and how may we serve you further before we depart?"

Jellin looks at her sister sibling, pressing her hand. Her eyebrows fly up for a moment, then fall back down, as she turns to look at Ash. "We have heard ... in these past days we have heard tales of Celidan. How she captured Luriel. How Far Seer's birth was forced. How the Far Hawk hungered for a home, heartsick, as he roamed the lands." She pauses, measuring Ash's sincerity.

"My father has spoken of your desire to travel, and I offer myself as a guide. In exchange for those magical items you recovered," and Jellin's mouth twists sourly here, "we ask only a simple service." She looks at Ellinor. "My sister is heart sore; she is a Changer but rejects all that it means to be a Changer." Ellinor nods, looking down at the hand still cradled in her sister's.

Starguard bows deeply, the concern written on his brow, and he says solemnly. "Ask, Jellin... and if it is within our power, we will do it. I have not forgotten my promise."

Jellin looks directly at Ash. "The legends tell us that Far Hawk found his heart's ease in Samaela's bosom, and become our Far Seer once more. Now he is one and both. My new mother, Samaela, is not the Samaela that Far Hawk found; undoubtedly she is now crumbled to dust. But the tales tell of her tomb, on the very edge of the ice fields, where her heart lies entombed. It is said that her heart still bleeds for those who ache, and hurt, and the blood will ease the pain ..."

Ash has not the diplomat's arms, the tongue of silver and the shield which is worn over the face. Though he sometimes uses sweet words, they are words he summons from his memory, from tales he's told and men of high station he's guarded. Now he nods. "And we, who have come from the lands of the father of the hated Prince, who owe allegiance to that man and to others of his sons, have come here and befriended Changers. If we are fated to walk strange roads, let us walk them together."

Ellinor looks sideways, never directly looking at Starguard, but continually keeping him within her vision. At Ash's words, her face brightens a little, and she scuttles backwards, grabbing a well filled backpack. Jellin, in turn, looks relieved, as she too, retrieves her pack. "Then, the goods are yours. We'd have no use for them. Ellinor and I will be your guides." She smiles, wryly. "Even the Cats will not dare harm Samaela's Child this season. I hope."

Illath, who has been watching all this quietly, looks much relieved. Obviously, much had been worrying him.

Tilara grins wryly. "I suspect that the Cats would be far more likely to attack us if you weren't along, actually. There are other dangers, of course, but we should be able to handle things."

Jellin nods at Tilara. "We can leave now, or with the dawn."

Ash holds up a hand. "Leaving in the morning is always best. And we have other business, perhaps. But we will leave as soon as possible."

Tilara chuckles. "Dawn is better than right this minute. But you're welcome to spend tonight in our tent if you wish."

Jellin nods once more, carefully putting her pack away again. "We will be ready." Ellinor stands up, backpack in hand, and moves to stand by Starguard, her hand seeking out his. Behind her, Jellin smiles wistfully, and rises to her feet. "Yes. We will accept your invitation." She turns to look at her erstwhile father and brother, before sweeping both a low bow. Then she, too, joins the party.
