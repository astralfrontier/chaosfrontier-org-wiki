# Birthright 2003-09-05

After making sure that all is arranged for this brief exploratory trip, the White company gathers once more. Horses are found for the two girls, swords are sharpened, crossbow bolts redivided amongst the party, foodstuffs packed. Starguard spends some time with the local healer, comparing notes and herbal cuttings, improving the quality of his healing kit, in so far as one can better the herbs the gods gifted him with.

The others, too, are admiring and exploring their new equipment. The armour, especially, continues to dazzle. Light as a feather, the wearer is fully protected ... and yet can move as though completely undressed, so little does the armour weigh, and so well are the joints articulated.

Other weapons have been bartered, and traded away, to the occasional bemusement of the Changers, who nonetheless are willing to trade at fair prices with these strangers who have turned one of their largest rituals upside down. Certainly, smiles are the order of the day. Unless there's a cat around. Those are feeling all hissy.

Ash is less than pleased about just how well-designed and well-fortified armor is tested out, however, having become the de facto sparring partner of nearly every martially-inclined member of the company. Starguard's Changer-driven inspirations get good exercise, too, in dealing with the consequential bruises.

But all is well. The party is mounted, the supplies are bagged and packed, and the party gets underway. The first few days of travel are steady and slow; a short mountain pass is easily climbed, descending into a long valley. There's a lake along the valley's base, winding the length of the valley, and pine trees dot the mountain sides. There is both cover, and good hunting. Or rather, normally there is good hunting. Lately, the valley has been hunted out a little. The fish, however, are as eager to bite as always, and the journey is pleasant.

For several more days the travel is uneventful. The two girls are quiet, spending most of their time with Stormy. Few words pass between them, and those seem strained at best. Jellin, especially, frequently looks worried, insisting that one or another from the cmpany check their backtrail, and at least once taking the party on a lengthy detour away from the lake.

Ash almost casually comments, during one of these backwards glances, "If you're expectin' visitors, shouldn't we all be hearin' about the hospitality planned for 'em?"

Jellin looks at Ash, her lips tight. "I ... I don't have any plans. I ... we ..." She looks at her sister, and shrugs. "Our father thinks this journey is a good idea. Others ... don't?"

Starguard says, "Don't worry too much about it, Jellin. If they want to follow a party of seven, odds are pretty good they will. It's hard to cover the traces of seven horses."

Ash nods, encouraging elaboration. "Any others in particular?"

Tilara says, "And they'll get a rather warm reception if they do." She listens, wondering if Jellin will elaborate.

Jellin nods at Ash. "I know." She looks back up the valley. "Some speak claims of heresy. Others feel that visiting this tomb is blasphemy. A few worry about waking the spirits of the Ancestors." She smiles wryly. "When we fled, we left many Ancestors behind. Some were asleep and could not be woken. Others we would as lief not disturb. Now, some fear that we might wake them." She looks forward, down the valley. "But the first test should be more than a week away. The travel songs aren't completely clear on what happens after the next valley."

Ash can't hide the sigh that escapes him at the word 'test', but he nods his assent. "Fair enough. I think we're all basically waiting to be attacked anyway," he remarks with a somewhat forced smile.

Jellin nods seriously at Ash. "Yes. I know I am. Ellinor dreams every night." She shrugs, and turns back to face down the valley. "For now, the ride will be straightforward. We follow this valley, cross the pass, follow the next valley ..." She pauses. "And then the songs fail. Usually we travel further east, not north."

Ash chuckles. "Warm up your throats, then, because you'll need to be singing whatever songs come after. Can either of you sing? Or write a song, at least? Our Tilara and Stormy should be a help, either way."

Tilara says, "Should've brought a bard along, then. Could've added a few verses."

Starguard says, "Don't worry too much. We've rewrote a few songs in the last few weeks. Stormy, Tilara, Ash, Andreth...I'd take them over many men in my old unit."

Ellinor looks up, at Ash and Tilara's words, and hums a tune. Jellin grins. "Oh; we've already written a song or two." She grins, impishly. "I wager you haven't heard them yet; we made our brother promise not to share them until after we left."

Tilara grins and blows the old fellow a kiss. "Thank you, Starguard."

Starguard smiles. "Well, I would. And not just because you look a sight better than most of 'em, Til."

Tilara sketches a bow from horseback. "I'd have to say you're a lot more useful than most of the troupe I toured with last year, too, Starguard. It's been ... educational."

Starguard says, "Hasn't it, though. Think of what might have been if we hadn't been standing about when Jane put up her job."

Andreth rides on in his usual meditative silence, smiling quietly at the banter between his companions. He seems more cheerful than usual - perhaps it's that he no longer feels the burden of the entire Empire upon his shoulders. True, it has been replaced by a new burden for the time being, but the lives of two young folk is a burden easier for his simple mind to understand.

Jellin raises one shoulder, shaking her head, and nudges her horse into a brief canter. The wind streams through her hair, cropped short as it is, while she raises her voice in a yell of pure exultation. Pulling her horse up short, she waits for the others to catch up in a small clearing that shows evidence of habitation. Plants are growing in straight lines, vines climbing up stakes, and a small path leads between the trees. Nudging her horse to take a few steps back, Jellin backs up, until the horse no longer stands inside the clearing. Behind her, the others are quick to catch up.

The clearing isn't large, and while it is crisscrossed by paths, those paths are too narrow for a horse's widespread hooves. Jellin, turning to Ash, raises an eyebrow. "We could go visit ..."

Ash shrugs and smiles, sparing a glance back to his friends before returning to answer the question. "We follow," he says simply.

Tilara grins at Starguard. "Indeed. Though I think there was little chance of that. I think your patrons were meddling."

Starguard rolls his eyes upwards. "It does sound like that, doesn't it?"

Starguard pulls up with the party. "Hmm...habitation? Out here?"

Tilara says, "Well, _somebody_ was. Can't complain too much, though. It's been fun."

Sliding off her horse, the beast is quickly tethered to a stake driven into the ground. Jellin nods, leaving her bow on her saddle, and her hands empty. Ellinor, following behind her, looks at Jellin's bow worriedly, but nevertheless steps out. As the others, too, follow the path, it twists and turns, following the contours of the land. Perhaps once a deer trail, it is now only slighter worn, and passes through two more open spaces, both containing carefully tended plants. The third space is somewhat differently arranged, used to grow herbs rather than the more prosaic vegetables one can subsist on all year long. Jellin nods at Starguard's comment. "We live everywhere. Some are ... more prone to living alone than others."

Andreth, his mind more on the present than the past, glances down one of the paths, and smiles. "Why not?" he asks, getting off his horse. "Any idea who we're visitin'?" he asks Jellin lightly.

Tilara looks around. "This isn't a Changer place, is it?"

Ellinor looks back at Tilara. "We're all changers here." She looks around at the clearing. "Most likely an elk? But ..." Jellin takes up the sentence easily. "But not a social Elk. Or we'd have heard about her home at the Courting."

Tilara nods. "Well, let's not disturb anything, then. If she wants to hide, let's not give her reason to worry about us."

Moving further down the path, you reach a small peat soddy, half buried in the ground. A thin stream of smoke flows out of the chimney, if you can call that hole in the round roof a chimney. Behind the building, someone is humming a song quietly. A female, from the sound of it. A female who hears the party approach; the voice stills, and an older woman, dressed in draped, worn cloth, walks around the side of the hut.

Ash waits patiently, deferring to the pair of guides the party brought.

Tilara bows to the elder woman, respectfully, but lets Jellin and Ellinor take the lead.

She stands, a spindle in hand, and watches the party approach. The spindle never ceases turning, and she teases thread from the mass of wool she holds in her hand. Jellin and Ellinor both sweep a low bow, and then look at the party behind them. Somehow, it seems, they hadn't expected to be elected as spokespersons. Finally Jellin shrugs, and steps forward. One step.

Hand over her heart, she offers a second bow, and begins to speak. "Greetings. We are seeking the White Expanse that houses the Mother's Manse. We bring peace, and the gift of fresh fish." With that, she hands over two of the trout caught only that morning, in a tickling fest, now hanging from a short string. The woman nods, stepping forward in turn, and accepting the fish. They're hung on a hook near the low entrance in the hut, and the woman turns again to face the party.

Scanning the faces of each of the party members, the woman spins her thread. Then she catches the spindle in her hands, and steps forward again, poking Andreth in the chest. "You should not tempt the gods to slap you, young man. The scars deface."

Andreth gives the old woman a bashful smile. He's almost -- _almost_ -- gotten used to encountering people who can see how he's been marked. "It couldn't be helped, ma'am. But I'd like ta think I'm makin' the best of it I can."

The woman sniffs, once, thoroughly, and turns to Starguard. "And you, greybeard. You are the guardian of these children?" She smiles. "You have an interesting road to hoe, then. And a long one. But the Twins be with you, always."

Starguard says, "Guide more than guard now, I suppose. They show themselves to be strong, I've seen. Thank you, Lady. The Twins be with you as well."

Tilara watches with interest. _So, indeed. More than she appears, this one._

the woman .. well, cackles, really is the only good term for it. "They do, greybeard. They do." Jellin looks at Starguard a moment, wincing, before shrugging. The old woman now turns to Tilara, her eyes narrowed. "Your kitten is ... shy. She shouldn't be. I've my own cats, guarding your horses." Over the mindlink, Tilara can see huge cats that have ringed the horses almost silently. One is nuzzling Mirra, who seems remarkably unalarmed.

Tilara smiles. "We weren't sure who we would find. I left her with orders to watch and stay hidden. Your cats seem not to alarm the horses, which is quite a trick. Fearful beasts, they are, more often than not."

The woman nods, smiling. "My cats are harmless. Just overgrown balls of fur." Her eyes twinkle, inviting Tilara to join her in a private joke, it seems.

Tilara says, "So it seems. Mirra seems to want to be one someday."

The woman nods, turning now to Ash, her eyes still twinkling as she looks him up and down. She says nothing though, merely dropping the spindle and giving it a twist, setting it to spinning again.

Ash smiles, but says nothing in return, simply waiting patiently. Whatever's going on isn't immediately hostile, so he's content to be curious. And quiet.

After a few moments have passed; moments during which Stormy is definitely squirming, the woman looks at Stormy. Her brows lower for a moment, stilling the boy's movements. Then she looks back at the two young girls, and nods. "You have a long journey ahead of you. The songs you know will fail you at the pass. Perhaps ..." She pauses.

Andreth rubs the scar at his throat thoughtfully, then breaks the silence. "Well, ye seem ta know who we are well enough, ma'am," he says, as respectfully as he can manage. "Could ye please innerduce yerself?"

The woman smiles. "I'm a Talespinner, a Songsinger, a Keeper of Knowledge." Her words sound like an old, rusty ritual, the capital letters clearly enunciated. She looks at the girls. "For those who ask the right questions, I have knowledge, though not wisdom, to share. For those who pay the cost, of course."

Ash breaks his silence as well, on the heels of his friend's question, and on the mercurial answer. "That seems to be the pattern with all sages," he observes wryly. "Tell us, what is the nature of the costs you might assess to such as us? You seem to know us, so I expect you can make reasonable estimates as to what we might ask."

The woman smiles. "The girls will pay me in song; they will be teaching me much this evening, I'm sure." She looks the others over. "As for the rest of you ... I don't know. It will depend, I think, on the questions whose answers you seek."

Ash nods. "If they are willing, they might question you about the roads ahead," he says at last, turning to look at those with him. "As to the rest of us... well, let each ask who will, I imagine." And he subsides into silence.

Tilara shrugs, and nods in the direction of the youngsters. "This is their quest, for the most part. We're simply along to provide support."

The woman nods once at Ash's words, seemingly unsurprised that he has no questions. She nods, too, at Tilara, her eyes still twinkling, before turning to face the two girls. Jellin moves forward, just a trifle, obviously taking the lead. "We seek the traveling songs, Songsinger, the tales of Samaela's Tomb, Talespinner, and the knowledge of her healing ways." Jellin holds Ellinor's hand. "We ... my sister ... there is need of Samaela's help." She looks at the party beside her. "These good people come as our companions, and our guards."

The woman nods. "Well, go back and feed your horses. Dinner will be ready in a few hours. Greybeard; you'll find the makings of a fine stew to go with those stews in the hut. I trust you remember how to cook?" She smiles, spinning her spindle.

After the horses are fed, and watered, the party returns to the soddy in its clearing. From inside, there are occasionally mutterings, but a pleasant smell does waft out through the hole in the roof. A pile of bowls have appeared by the front door, left there by the Songspinner, who is seated on a stump, humming and spinning to her heart's content. The rest of the after noon passes peacefully, quietly, as the woman spins, and Starguard cooks. Dinner, when it's served, is a tasty stew that goes down easy, supplemented by a strange wine the woman offers around. "Cowslip and dandelion." It does not taste quite like the wines you're used to, being sweeter and less astringent, but still, it is enjoyed by even the most discerning palate. Finally, the meal over, the Songspinner turns again to the party. "Tonight, the girls will learn the travel songs to Samaela's Tomb. Tomorrow morning, they will learn the Peril Songs. But you have other questions ..."

Andreth clears his throat slightly, and nods. "We do, Talespinner." He takes a deep breath. "The tales tell us that every man has his totem. And after all I been through... well, I think it'll soon be time that I needta be seeking out me own."

The woman looks at Andreth, smiling. "Yes. You're a little old to be finding your totem. Still, a totem is a life long burden, or a life long gift." She pauses. "Easy to find, and hard to keep? Or was it hard to find, and easy to keep? Or is it merely hard all the way round?" She taps a nail against a tooth, and shakes her head, then grins. "Hard all the way around, and easy, too." She looks at Andreth. "The Goddess has given you the first lesson, you can learn more at the Tomb, if these your friends will guide and guard you while you seek ..."

Starguard says, "Speaking of such things, Talespinner, can you tell me how I, or any of us, might best guide and guard each other?"

The woman nods at Starguard. "Watch his back, while he meditates. In the Tomb, he will find a room that speaks to him. Do not enter, with him, but ... do not allow others to enter. Through any of the doors."

Starguard muses on that for a moment. "I will do that, Talespinner."

The woman smiles. "You will find it harder than you expect, I fear. Many a Changer has lost his way in his meditation, as forces from without tempt her to walk this path and that, dooming him to an eternity of motion, abandoning the land of her parents, his family, her clan."

Starguard says, "Talespinner, you spoke of the Stars as if you knew them well. Can you tell me what you know of them? I always am ready to learn about my faith."

The woman pauses, looking at Starguard. "I can sing you the songs, greybeard. I can tell you the tales of these twins, siblings, partners, mates ... " She smiles. "Did you know that their only daughter is the Mother of the Stormwinds? And yet she isn't honoured, in the ways she should be."

Starguard says, "No, Talespinner. Can you tell me the tales you know?"

Andreth perks up his ears at that, looking intrigued. "I'd like to hear those tales too," he says. "The man who saved me from the gutter was devoted to 'er."

The woman smiles, her spine straightening, before launching into a long and winding recital. Starguard listens intently, and learns of the only child of the Twins, a girl whose name is lost in the depths of time, but who is known now for her totem. Oak; daughter of the gods, and a god herself, who married the very mortal very human Wanfar, and followed him into exile when Luriel's followers - or rather, Wanfar - quarreled with the others. Oak, who survived the death of her husband, and raised his children, sons who were as quick tempered as their father and their god. Oak who lived with the Stormwinders until the day she vanished, shortly before the death of First Daughter. Oak who shared many laughs with First Daughter, and many lessons, and shared her friend's peace with the tribe.

The tale ends on a strange note; Oak vanishes, but nothing is said of where she vanishes to. The Song Spinner looks apologetic, as she stops; the very rhythm and pace of the tale suggests that the story is not fully told, but - as she explains - no more is known than that.

Starguard nods. "The break in that is strange. An unfinished symphony indeed."

Tilara listens and learns, but asks no questions of her own. She's never been devoted to any one of the Gods and is content to listen to the tales the others ask to hear.

The woman nods, once, her eyes twinkling. "Thinking on finding the ending, Starguard, if there is one?" She pauses for a moment. "Certes, the Twins would like to hear the end ... their Daughter has been gone for a long time now."

Starguard says, "Oh dear. If it's something the Twins want, I suspect we may be entwined into it. Though I go willingly, they do tend to meddle a bit."

Ash leans in as the terminus of the tale is reached. "It seems to me," he says, slowly and unsteadily, "that the gods, and their children, and their families, and all of that--" He waves his hand, indicating the world at large, it seems "-- it's all a quarrel. But, thousands of such feuds happen daily in the Empire, and perhaps further out too. Have the Gods not looked upon them, and seen how they must always end, and seen themselves in us as we have learned to?"

The woman nods, smiling. "Ah well, the twins do like to entwin people, don't they?" She tilts her head. "They have, after all, a fascinating sense sense of humour, and they enjoy watching the world below." The woman turns to Ash, and nodss. "The gods have ... Well, no. _Some_ of the gods, like the twins, have looked, and now meddle for a variety of reasons. Others choose not to look ..."

Starguard says, "We don't seem to learn how quarrels end, so why should the Gods, Ash? Besides, one can not always avoid a quarrel, and some quarrels are important enough to risk."

Ash shrugs, turning to the priest. "You've seen who I fight, and why. I will age and die, and nobody will remember what I learned. But the Gods are immortal, or as near as anyone can come to being.. They've had time to see."

Starguard says, "Wisdom is supposed to come with age admittedly, Ash. But not always."

Ash laughs softly. "So, what is the nature of your faith in the Stars, then, old man? That they will guide you properly? How can any priest be sure? Or any devout man. Once you assert that.... Well, you better follow the thought to its conclusion."

Starguard says, "That is the nature of faith, Ash. You can't be sure. You must simply trust that the path you choose to follow, and the people you choose to walk with are the right ones."

Tilara says, "One wonders how old the Gods actually _are_ in that sense. Maybe by their own standards they're still youthfully foolish."

Ash shakes his head. "No. I've walked with Ferg, and I learned cunning. I've walked with the White Company, and I've learned trust. But you walk along some dark tunnel. The Stars have provided you with magic, in exchange for service. You aren't following their guidance.. you're walking behind them as they grope ahead in their own darkness, it sounds like. And if not the Stars, then at least some of the Gods."

Starguard smiles. "We all grope in darkness, to some extenet. I believe that the Stars see better than I in what light there is."

Starguard says, "They certainly have a better vantage to look from."

Ash nods slowly. "That I cannot argue against." And with that, he turns back to the Talespinner. "We've spoken of how man flails blindly into the darkness. I have ever sought to learn why. Tell us now, if my friends are willing to indulge me more time, of why men act beyond their bestial instincts. I could kill for food, shelter, and companionship, yet I do not. What stories can you share of gods and men who have seen beyond the tunnel, and knew for which they sought? What of higher dreams?"

The woman pauses a moment, and ponders. "I can sing you songs of love, Ash. I believe those are the songs you are requesting. The love of a person for their family, for their clan, for their people. The love of a god who quests for knowledge, and the love of a god who would doom all to follow his firstborn son into the Caves." She smiles. "In the songs I have gathered, love lifts people up, and hatred casts them down. I don't know if that is the light you seek, but it is the beacon the Songspinners follow. From the time of Muirwen's sacrifice onwards ..."

Starguard shakes his head. "I have a different answer than you, Talespinner. A unit of soldiers can accomplish much more as a group working together compared to their individual works. It is advantage to work together for the whole, but one can often try to cheat, and get the benefit of the group, while focusing solely on their own self-interest."

Ash chuckles as he listens. "Then, old soldier, tell me why a man joins a group. With his family he has no choice, but all else is either voluntary or obligatory."

"Were these higher dreams, Greybeard, or dreams of avarice? Did these soldiers, who used their mates, not ultimately betray them?" The woman sounds slightly bitter.

Starguard says, "They did, Talespinner. And lost all advantage in the long run. But many are short-sighted."

Tilara nods, a look of distaste on her own features. "Aye, and the more who cheat, the weaker the group becomes. The trick is to identify the cheaters and cast them out of the group, while not confusing them with folk whose skills are valuable but not always needed."

Starguard says, "The group is stronger than the one. The greedy try to have it both ways."

The woman nods. "Yes. But the young man asked about people who see beyond the tunnel, and who seek higher dreams. He didn't ask about those who try to twist those around them."

Starguard says, "Ah. Then you try to focus the entire group on your goal. A difficult task."

"Yes. Yes it is. In any group." The woman turns to Ash. "Does that answer your questiong, youngling?"

Ash shakes his head. "Not really. But.. I hadn't considered love. I've never thought of war as something motivated out of love, and yet it looks like war will be required of us, sooner or later. I thank you." He inclines his head solemnly.

Tilara nods. "Oh, you can definitely fight because of love. You've never seen a mother bear defend her cubs?"

Starguard says, "The motivations of someone can bend and stretch and turn to many aims. Some...regrettable. Isn't that right, Talespinner?"

Ash shakes his head sadly at Tilara. "Love doesn't compel one to fight, though. I can also imagine a healer, who'd vowed never to take life, letting himself be struck down.. also out of love." He shrugs.

Andreth smiles. "But one can fight without taking life... although to be sure, 'tis an ever-present risk."

Tilara snorts disdainfully. "Vowing never to take life is a good way to limit your choice of action. If you're part of a group who will defend you, you might get away with it."

Ash raises a hand, on the verge of saying something, but shakes his head. Returning his attention to the Changer woman, he asks again for tales of bravery and honor, stories meant to inspire. And with that, some measure of the history of these strange and savage lands begins to draw itself out of the darkness of understanding, as the sun and moon make their slow spiral in the world outside.
