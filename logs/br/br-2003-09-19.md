# Birthright 2003-09-19

After an evening spent camped at the bottom of a tallish cliff, the party has managed to scale all three hundred feet of so of rock, reaching the top. The first to climb up, with Tilara's aid, scurried fast as spiders. Ash, and Andreth, waited below while those above looked around the plateau. There was much that disturbed them; odd depressions that looked unnatural, movement in the distance ...

With the aid of a lowered rope, Andreth was soon climbing up the cliff side, but when he reached the cave openings about two thirds of the way up, he heard footsteps. Redoubling his efforts he reached the top in almost no time, and immediately turned around to start helping Ash up. Ash ... wasn't so lucky. By the time he passed the caves, the footsteps had turned into flying rocks, all of which seemed to be targeting his backside. Tilara began to lay down a little fire support, but even so, Ash was hurting hard.

Tilara is ready when the creature emerges from its cave, firing a trio of fire-bolt missiles to distract it from the vulnerably dangling Ash. As always, they strike unerringly, but the creature seems more annoyed than hurt by them. "We only want to pass!" she shouts in the Trade tongue. "Why did you attack us?"

Scrambling with all his might, straining his muscles to their utmost, Ash strives for a goal of great importance to him: the preservation of his own life. He can feel the power behind the attack that struck him, and he has no wish to face such a puissant arm. Then, too, are the feelings of concern for the party's charges, and briefly his role as living shield is summoned from his memories. Pain and recollection and desperation crystallize, fused by alchemy into strength, and the warrior achieves the top of the plateau, panting.

"Vermin! Gerroutta my garden!" The man seems to be shaking his fist. "Gerouttamycavesyoulittlerats!"

Tilara is quite happy to keep the big fellow shouting. "We're trying to get out of your garden, and we don't want to go in your caves in the first place!"

"Gerroutta ... yer **IN** my garden, you little tinderbox." He glares up at Tilara, hands on hips, dust cascading out of his long unwashed unbrushed hair. "And there's more of yez in my caves. I can smells ya, ya little rats. I can hears yez, and see yer little tracks. And I'll not be havin' it." He hefts another rock, somewhat bigger than the one's he's been throwin so far. "Yer keepin' me wife from her sleep! Me food's cold, me clothes is dirty, and me pregnant wife is gettin' cranky!"

"We'll be happy to leave you alone immediately," retorts Ash. "Is there a different way down, when we return this way? If so, we'll take it."

Tilara says, "We came up from down below. It's not us in your caves."

Shaking his head, the man glares. "Yez not leavin till yez takes yer little friends with yez. Yer keepin' me dear darling wife, light of me eyes, blessed of my heart, feeder of me stummick, from gettin' her much needed sleep, and I'll not be havin' it. And it **is** yez. More of yez. I'll exterminate you first, then get the other ones."

"Let us meet them, they may not be ours," responds Ash hurriedly. "But we'll try to take them away quickly, if we possibly can."

The man raises an eyebrow. "Right then. Yez'll be catchin't 'em. Damn little rodents, scurryin' round behind me nice neat caves." He measures Tilara with his eyes. "At least yez'll be able ta enter theys passages, even if yez speaks true and izn't them."

Tilara blinks. _Oy. **Now** what have we gotten ourselves into?_

The man drops the rock over the edge of the cliff, letting it bounce the two hundred feet or two. "Right. Yez comin' down then? I'll show yez the passages, yez collects the little buggers, and gets theyz outta my caves, and then yez goes on yer way?"

Tilara shrugs. "We can try, anyway. What do the other ones look like?"

"Who knows? Theyz small, they have feetz that leavez trackz like yez. And they little buggers chip chip chip away at me bluidy cavez!" The man growls, and steps aside a little, making room on the ledge. "Comin' down, or do I hef to come getz yez?"

Ash answers by scrambling down, descending via rope toward the cave entrance.

Tilara sighs and scrambles down the side of the cliff, her hands and feet still sticking to the rock with the power of the spider-foot spell she cast. "Sounds like trouble, but let's go take a look."

Standing on the ledge, the giant - who now clearly towers over the party after they've all scrambled down - grumbles about vermin, chewing his unkempt moustache. Turning on his heel he heads into a cave. The ceiling is easily fifteen feet tall or so, leaving him plenty of headroom. In the distance, there's a grunting and a growling. The giant tilts his head. "The wife. Dinnae disturb her. Shez ... not feeling happy." He marches on, moving deeper into the caves. There are numerous side caves, dark holes in the flickering light cast by his torch. Finally the cave seems to peter out after a mile or so, ending in a blank wall with a small hole along the bottom, about three feet tall. Obviously too small for the giant to creep through.

The giant points at the hole and lowers the torch. On the ground he seems to have scattered rock dust, and you can see the prints of tiny feet ... longish feet, with elongated toes.

Tilara crouches to peer down one of the tunnels. "See? Toldja we weren't the same ones. That's almost too small even for us."

The giant shrugs at Tilara. "Yez all vermin. Yez gets rid of these, and I don't have to kill yez. Just bring back a few bodies ta show to t'missus."

Starguard says, "These aren't human. They're kobold tracks."

The giant peers at Starguard. "Ko-what? Verminz vermin. Yez killz em, brings a few for the pot, missus is happy, and I get me dinner."

Andreth cracks his knuckles. "Well, what're we waitin' for? Let's catch us some vermin."

Tilara purrs to Mirra. _What do you smell?_

Mirra looks back at her mistress. _Rats. Wet dogs. Grease?_

The giant nods at Andreth, obviously pleased with his response. "Right. Yez wanna see the other two bolt holes?"

Andreth nods. "Yeah, prob'ly best. Better if'n we know where else they might come out of."

The giant nods, slowly. "Right, then. Yez be goin' in here though. Theyz by the wife's chambers, they iz." He turns back, leading you back down what appears to be the main hallway before turning off into a subhall. There's another long hike, one that's probably a lot shorter for him, given the length of his legs. Certainly Jellin and Ellinor are beginning to flag. Eventually he steps into a well lit cave, light provided by glowing lichens and torches. On the far side, a very pregnant very large lady sits in a rocking chair, knitting slowly, and occasionally sobbing.

Starguard's eyebrows raise at the largest pregnancy he's ever seen. And glad he doesn't have to play midwife. He doesn't know if he'd have the strength...

Looking up, the woman notices the party trooping in. Her eyes on her husband, she sobs about the pitter patter of tiny feet, disturbin' her and driving her rocks. She shakes her head mournfully, and barely cheers up when he tells her he has some vermin killers ta fill the pot. Looking at the party, she sniffs. "Yez sendin' chillun's ta kill vermin. Ya unfeeling oaf!" Blinking, then blushing, the man begins to stammer while Jellin looks at Ellinor, and then moves forward to greet the lady giantess. Placing her hand on the treetrunk of an arm, holding the knitting, she smiles upwards very slowly. "We'll be fine, miss." She looks back at the others.

At this, the woman sobs, and rants in turn, making it clear that she's not having two such chillun's riskin' their necks when there's strong husbands as can kill them vermin hisself, is she making herself perfectly clear. Moments later, she's back to sobbing in her knitting. Perplexed, Ellinor moves to join Jellin. Looking back at Ash, she shrugs. "We could ... ummm ... stay with her? I think we'll be safe?"

Ash nods his assent. "We'll be back shortly."

Tilara nods to the giantess. "He'll stay here, ma'am, and kill any that we flush out of the tunnels. We'll be fine."

The giant looks visibly relieved. Very very relieved. Especially when he can leave through the far entrance, and point out the two bolt holes. Both have been blocked by boulders, but the back of the boulders show definite signs of chipping.

Andreth examines the stones. "Well, hopefully these'll hold if'n they're inna hurry. We'll just haveta make sure they _is_ inna hurry."

Starguard nods. "Oh, they will be." He readies his shield and crossbow. "Let's see if we can scare off the rats."

The giant nods. "I'll be blockin' em a little more then. Jest in case, yez has ta hunt em inta here. No disturbin' the missus." He looks over his shoulder, where the two girls seem to have distracted her from her sobbin'. "And if yez keeps the wife happy, I has a little summat yez might like, when yez comes back."

Back at the main bolt holt the party eyes the hole nervously. It's small. Not very high. If it doesn't open up relatively soon, they're going to be sitting ducks, unable to maneuver.

The shield tilted so that it fits, Starguard slides into the hole, clanking impressively. Within a few feet the tunnel twists to the left, and then again, to the right.

Moving along, at first the tunnel seems cramped, and obviously made on purpose, but as Starguard penetrates further, he begins to spot signs of unexpected niches in the walls. Places where it almost seems as if the little vermin started chipping ... and then changed their mind. Sliding his shield forward, he notices one such nick, running the width of the tunnel, right underneath the shield's edge. He stops, examining it carefully, sweat beading on his brow.

Starguard says, "Er, I think we might have a trap up here..."

Starguard says, "Sit down, folks. I'm going to poke around and see what I can find."

As he slowly inches the shield forward, his eyes moving across each wall in turn, taking the greatest care, he finds another nick, running the width of the tunnel. It's about three feet beyond the first nick, obvious once he sees it. A fine line running across. If he tried, his shield could just cover the floor of the tunnel, from line to line ...

Starguard tries it, carefully resting the edges of his shield on the front and back of the lines. "OK... I think I've got it. Let's try crawling over the shield? No weight between the edges, if possible."

Carefully sliding the shield so that it spans the lines in the tunnel, Starguard crawls across, holding his breath the whole way. After he safely reaches the far side, having traversed about three feet, he crawls on, making room for those behind him to follow. The tunnel slopes upwards, now, at a slow ten degree incline, and begins to open up a little. The ceiling looks a lot less worked, though the floor and walls still show plenty signs of chipping.

As he moves far enough forward, the rest of the party crawls across the shield, one at a time, Andreth being the last pulling it up and slowly passing it forward past everyone else, so that the paladinate turntle can crawl behind his shell again.

Andreth pauses, as he passes the shield forward... then puts a hand on Stormy's shoulder, and hisses, "I hear somethin'... pass it on."

His shield once more ahead of him, though it no longer covers him completely, Starguard moves on, slowly sliding up the tunnel. Behind him, Mirra's whiskers twitch, as she sends a pungent comment on the odoriferous side effects of rancid grease to her misstress.

At Tilara's suggestion, Mirra moves forward, sidling past Starguard. Soon, her nose begins to wrinkle in earnest. _Grease. Lots of rancid grease. On slope._ She trots back a little, refusing to advance. Behind her Starguard moves forward slowly and clankily, coming eventually to a scree slope. Or a greased slope. It's hard to tell. He, too, can smell it. On the other hand, at the bottom of the slope, which only runs for perhaps twenty feet, the tunnel seems to open out into a natural cave system. One in which he can easily stand.

"We'll use rope," recommends Ash in a whisper, after seeing for himself what lies beyond. "If it's a more subtle trap, it should keep us safe from falling into something unpleasant. And if not, we are under no great time constraint."

Andreth nods, lifting his crossbow. "'n we at the top'll cover 'im in case the "somethin' unpleasant" is one o' dem kobolds."

After a bit of deliberation, a rope is secured and unrolled down the slope. Starguard continues down, controlled, using arm strength to slow his descent, skidding a bit as he goes down. 20 feet down goes pretty quick, and rather surprisingly, keeps going! The floor appears to be illusionary.

As he moves down, through the floor, a moment of surprise that the floor isn't there, that, in fact, he's sliding hand over hand right through it. His hand slips, a moment, and he slides faster now, than he intended, landing awkwardly after sliding about one and a half times the giant's height. On to a floor liberally sprinkled with nasty sharp little caltrops.

Starguard cries out, grumbling, calling up to the party at the top. "Little bastards caltropped the floor! Be careful!"

Ash calls back down, "Coming up or waiting for us?"

Starguard says, "Come on down! I'll clean up for you."

After shaking the sharp spiky thing off his foot, Starguard looks around. There's not many ways out of where he is. Really, it looks mostly like a pit. One big enough to hold a giant.

One by one the rest of the party descends into the illusion-shielded pit, supported by the rope that Andreth holds. Wary of Starguard's fate, each holds the rope tightly, treating the slide as an actual climb and cautious of what lies ahead.

Carefully climbing up the wall that's most likely to lead to the continuance of the passage, Ash cautiously looks over the edge. Just as Andreth notices a shadow detach from the wall, arching down to hit Ash, a large slab of rock comes crashing down.

Ash lands safely, if not softly, and growls as he looks up.

Andreth looks alarmed as Ash goes toppling down back into the pit, but breathes a sigh of relief when the warrior gets to his feet, apparently intact. He waits, still holding the rope, to see what his companions will do next.

Tilara says, "Either there's some switch to keep it in place that we missed, or it's controlled from the other side normally. You want me to climb over it, or do one of you brave warriors feel like eating a spider?"

Starguard grumbles, rubbing his foot. "I think someone else can lead for a bit."

Ash raises his hand, grimacing but clearly volunteering for this duty. "Gimme a rope," he says quietly.

Tilara chuckles. "Oh, c'mon. they're not that bad." She waits until Ash has the gear he needs, then feeds him the spell's ingredients and casts the magic. "There you go. It'll last an hour or so, so if you need to bypass any traps on the ground, just go up the walls."

Working his way up the wall, marveling at the way his hands and bare feet adhere to the cliff face, Ash eventually reaches the point where rock slammed down, just ahead of his rapidly departing fingers. He pauses, then pushes, with one hand, and discovers the slab pivots easily, pivoting back up against the wall, which is also the ceiling. This tunnel is definitely not square. As he pushes further, it continues to pivot easily, allowing him to look further down the tunnel. He sees ...

... nothing.

... or rather, he sees more natural caverns, worked even less than the previous section appeared to be.

Ash reports what he sees briefly, then works as best he can to make sure his companions can climb up the rope, without likewise being inconvenienced by stone slabs.

Tilara beckons Andreth down once the nature of the trap has been solved, and shortly afterward the group has climbed past the rotating slab and joined Ash. "Odd. This looks less well worked. We're getting into another natural section. I wonder if the kobolds are responsible for all of this..."

\*chip\* \*chip\* \*thud\* \*chip\*

Ash beckons for Starguard to lead ahead, marching closely indeed behind the paladin. "I'm expecting missile fire. They can probably see better than we can," he murmurs.

Starguard says, "As long as we see the best in the end."

Andreth takes up his position at the rear of the formation and falls in behind, guarding the party's retreat, but ready to come forward as soon as he gets a chance.

Moving further through the tunnel ... the tunnel begins to open up into a natural cave, with stalactites and stalagmites, between which the party can tread, cautiously but surely. Soon, they find themselves in a huge cave, one that feels as though it were easily hundreds of yards wide and tall, though in the dark ... the light does not travel far enouh to confirm this. Certainly, the ceiling, barely visible as it is, appears to press down, and the floor, with its daggers of rock, presses insistently up.

Andreth gestures his companions to silence, listening quietly for the quiet tapping. As a faint thud resounds across the chamber, he seems to come to a decision and points into the darkness.

Moving off into the darkness, the party creeps between the rock daggers, taking advantage of cover, and moving as silently as the occasional clank permits. Ahead, there's a shine of light, barely noticeable given the party's own lights.

As Andreth slowly, quietly, moves forward, hands loosely held at the ready, the light ahead of him seems to grow brighter, teasing him forward. It's perhaps forty yards or so, and appears to be some kind of flickering candle. As he moves closer, slipping from cover to cover, he's just about to get close enough to see it, when it suddenly goes out. The entire cavern is in darkness.

Andreth freezes in his tracks, and flattens himself against the stalagmite, straining his hearing to the utmost. Even if he was spotted or heard, he hopes to hear them coming before they're close enough to harm him...
