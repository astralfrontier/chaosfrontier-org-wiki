# Birthright 2003-10-10

With the aid of a guide, the three youngsters soon find themselves back at the place where they first entered the tunnels. They've taken a shortcut or two, although the humans couldn't quite make out what they were. Still, emerging from the tunnel they see nobody.

Tilara keeps her voice low. "So far, so good. Let's scout back and make sure the tall ones aren't pulling a fast one on us, shall we?"

Ash nods.

Carefully retracing their steps, which wasn't hard considering the lack of side tunnels, the three soon reach the original cave entrance, where they're not particularly surprised to see how dark it is outside.

Tilara lets Mirra check things out in the dim light, not wanting to risk waking anyone up with the glowstone's light. _Big folks sleeping there and there. Our young ones in that corner._

After curling up in a corner of their own, and catching a little sleep, the three are awoken in the morning by the giant's wife, who heads into a back cave where a fire is soon lit. She's humming a bit of a tune under her breath - a tune that travels through the caves like gravel down a scree filled slope. Behind her the two girls are slower to wake up, but quick to cluster around Stormy once they do. Greetings are exchanged, and the girls look both healthy and rested.

Tilara takes the three aside quietly while Ash watches the giants. "We've made contact with the little folk they were talking about - kobolds. They're being pushed into this area by something deeper down, but they seem decent enough. They're certainly smarter than the giants. We might be able to work something out."

The girls nod, wide eyed. Jellin, especially, seems impressed. Somehow the warnings of the Talespinner seem to have paled in their minds; mfear replaced by curiosity. Neither, for instance, has ever heard of kobolds.

Tilara smiles and describes the little folk. "Kinda lizardish, really. Not very strong, but clever enough. There's a lot of excellent stonework down there."

Jellin looks at Ellinor, and she looks back. "I wonder if ... if ... after all, the Talespinner did say we would find the Builders in unexpected places."

Tilara nods. "Our thought, as well. _Someone_ down there has built some impressive things. If it's not the kobolds, it almost has to be someone nearby."

Jellin nods slowly. "Well, we do still have two valleys to get through before we reach ..." Ellinor bites her lip, and then shrugs. "What will you tell the giant?"

Tilara says, "That will depend on what we find deeper down, I think. If we can solve the kobold's problems, we can probably persuade them to stay away from here. If not ... we'll figure something else out. We've always managed so far." She grins at Stormy as she says this.

Ellinor nods, looking at Jellinor. Behind them, the giant begins to stir as the smell of breakfast wafts out of the other cave. Some kind of ham, or perhaps mutton.

After a few moments, the giant rolls out of his furs, and notices the newcomers. Scratching himself and wandering over, he looks the three up and down. "Yez lost two, then? Howz the vermin?"

Ash hmms. "We're here to talk about that. We can promise they won't be a problem, and in fact they may be a lot of help to you."

The giant sits down, making himself comfortable on the floor. "Tell; then we eat."

Tilara says, "They don't want to come up here, but something from deeper in the caves is chasing them away. We're going to see if we can help them get rid of it."

Ash briefly relates the travails the party endured working its way through the tunnels. Though no storyteller of any skill, he does his best to emphasize the stone-cunning the strange little people of the caves seemed to exhibit.

The giant looks up at the mention of stone cunning. "Yez says theyz stone workers?"

Tilara nods. "Very good ones, it seems."

Ash nods. "They're more useful to you alive than dead. And they've sworn oaths to respect your sleeping-hours."

The giant looks happier at this. "And yez sez they won't invade our caves?"

Ash smiles a little. "They no more want grief from you than you want from them. If you respect them, they will gladly respect you."

Tilara says, "We're trying to arrange it. Still details to work out, and they do need help."

Nodding, the giant calls over his shoulder for his wife to join him. She slowly walks in, carrying a large platter of slices of meat, and sauteed giant mushrooms. She puts the platter down, before sitting down next to her husband, who wraps an arm around her shoulders. Inviting everyone to eat, she listens quietly as he explains what the youngsters have told him.

Tilara pauses before taking any of the meat. "Is this mutton?"

The giantess nods. "We keep sheep in the meadow."

Tilara looks vaguely relieved as she takes a slice of meat to go with her mushrooms.

The girls, too, snag slices with their daggers, and chew happily. Meanwhile, the giant looks more thoughtful. "Yez sez ... arrangements?"

Tilara says, "We're trying to work out a way for you and them to co-exist, or for them to be able to go back to their old tunnels."

The giant nods, slowly. "So whats yez offerin'? The sleeptime schedules'll help the missus, and she's slept like a babe, all the night long, but whats ta keep the vermin from comin' up?"

"Simply put," says Ash dryly, "you most likely have nothing they want. And if you do, then they must trade for it, rather than take it."

Tilara says, "One of two things. Either you agree to let them come up at times you can live with, in return for them not bothering your property, or we get rid of whatever it is that's making them want to come up this far."

The giant nods, once more, while rubbing the missus' shoulders slowly. Then he pauses. "Yez sayin' ... they could trade?" He looks a lot more cheerful, all of a sudden.

Tilara nods. "I'm sure they'd be willing to trade."

Ash gets up, returning to the tunnel entrance. "Starguard," he says clearly, then clasps his hands together, mimicking the priest's pose of prayer. He points into the tunnels, then makes a 'shoo'-ing gesture, imitating the act of bringing the priest out into the cave.

Straightening up, the giant begins to rubs her shoulders more enthusiastically. "And yez sez they works stone, and theyz cunning little beasts we knows, and ... " You can see the wheels beginning to turn.

Ash holds up a hand to the guide for a moment, asking for a pause, then scribbles a brief note: BRING A TRADER. This he sends along with the dutiful kobold, and returns to Tilara, Stormy, and the giants.

Stormy looks up at Ash, grinning as he finishes his generous breakfast. "Isn't it funny how sometimes the biggest challenges ... dissolve?"

Ash shakes his head. "No, it's funny how sometimes the biggest challenges aren't really challenges. You just need for people to open their eyes.."

Tilara grins. "There are no challenges. Merely opportunities."

Stormy blinks, then looks wide eyed for a moment. "I ... I suppose." He shrugs. "So what will happen to the tusked monsters?

Ash shrugs a little. "We can only do so much. Can we desert one obligation to pursue another?"

Tilara says, "That remains to be seen. If they can be negotiated with, we can co-opt this whole region into something peaceful and prosperous. If they can't -- well, we'll kill them."

Jellin watches curiously, biting her lip at the mention of the tusked monsters. She's trying to ... to remember something the Talespinner said. Something about the Builders of Samaela's tomb.

Ellinor, looking at her sister, begins to whisper something about tunnels and passages. Finally Jellin nods. "The Talespinner told us that the Tomb was always hard to find, and that we needed to find the Builders first. But nobody knows who the Builders are."

The clinking of armor and his heavy feet on the stone herald Starguard's coming well before he arrives. "Ho, the cave!" he calls out, "I've brought a visitor!" The priest soon appears, a nervous looking kobold with him.

Ash waves briefly to Starguard, then turns to Ellinor. "How does one identify the Builders, then?" he asks evenly.

Ellinor shrugs. "We don't know. She didn't know. That knowledge was lost in the songs of time."

Ash nods, once, then turns to Starguard. "Before we begin this, ask your friend there --" he gestures downward, at the diminuitive creature "-- if he knows the name Samaela, or those who change into animals, or the building of any great monument in the past?"

Starguard turns to the kobold, speaking in Firstborn to him. "One question before we begin. Have you heard the name Samaela before?"

The creature, introducing himself as Utillirionin, shakes his head.

Nodding back, Starguard asks about the building of monuments next. Here, the creature is a lot more informative. He sounds almost eager to please, as he tries to explain. "We have built many monuments in the past. We build for the Brother and the Sister, and they teach us. We teach for the children of the Father, and we bring them to their Father when they've been lost by the tall ones. The Mother sings her songs to us, and Second Son teaches us the way of the stones." He pauses. "We learn well."

Starguard relates the words of the kobold, guessing Limera and Ungfallen are the Mother and Father, and the Brother and Sister his own Stars.

Ash nods. "Ask them of the god of the Changers - they don't know our names, I guess, so be descriptive. And of the Changers themselves.."

While Starguard translates, Ash turns to Jellin and Ellinor. "The song-trails to the tomb. What came next?"

Starguard nods, and translates to the kobold, using his recent experiences to describe the Changer god to him, and also Samaela, on the off-chance that a description might help.

At first confused, the kobold shrugs. "We build for the Mother and the Father and the Children. They are not animals; they are tall ones, pale and weak sometimes, and fond of feathers, but they fly not ..." He shakes his head once more, sorry he can't help directly.

Jellin tries to remember. "She spoke of the Builders, and of Samaela's lineage. 'In her past the future lies', she said." She shrugs. "Why would the future worry about telling lies though?"

Starguard shakes his head to Ash. "No luck."

Tilara blinks at the translation. "Fond of feathers? What's he mean by that, Starguard?"

Starguard asks the kobold what he means, suspiciously considering the other feathers they've found in their travels.

The kobold shrugs. "We burn feathers to communicate with the Mother's children. They come when we call to them, though they like it not if the call is not right."

Ash smiles suddenly, the very broad smile of a man who's come to a realization. He withdraws the crystal of the Waters from its safe hiding place, while asiding to Starguard - "one more question. Do others, the younglings they send out, the teachers that come - do those people also build monuments? And if so, when are some new arrivals expected? And no matter what, where are the monuments built, and in what relation to each other? Get an answer while I call the abbot..."

Starguard begins to quiz the little fellow about the monuments, how they work, and all the rest as Ash gets in contact with the abbott.

Utillirionin looks thoughtful, before answering the question at length. Boiling it down, it becomes clear that the teachers don't build monuments, but they do teach the ways of stonework and sourcery, which in turn have been used in great monuments. Teachers come at irregular times, and they haven't seen any in quite a few seasons now. As for the details of the monuments; they are all built underground. Some in the mountain that Brother and Sister inhabit, some near the halls where the Father lives. Some under the ice, and others over great pits of heated, melted stone. The monuments, it seems, tend to be very widespread and not particularly connected. Some, the earliest, were built under the aegis of the Teacher.

The crystal activates as rapidly as it always does. And just as always, Liowen is not happy at the interruption of his day.

Ash chuckles softly. "You people made our lives hell, you can suffer a little early-morning interruption to get something useful," he observes. "Now then.. the abbot, or someone else of importance?"

Liowen sounds frustrated, but defeated. "The abbot has been hoping you would use the crystal. Please wait." Moments later the old abbot speaks, welcoming Ash. "You have news for us?"

Ash nods. "Ask this being about feathers," he suggests, then presents the crystal to Ut. "Ask him in Firstborn," adds the warrior.

At first the abbot sounds puzzled, but then he switches smoothly to the tongue of the Firstborn, posing simple questions about the feathers. Utillirionin is tentative at first, but soon the two relax into longwinded explanations and counter explanations and the like.

Looking like the cat who got the canary, Ash takes a few minutes to explain to the giant: "Sorry to take your time, but we've learned something useful ourselves, and intend to profit too. This trader will speak with you about your needs and theirs, with our Starguard translating, as soon as possible."

Starguard follows along carefully, translating at times when the conversation lags, so that the others can follow along. The feathers, as it turns out, are a way of sending messages to the Children of the underworld, the Children that Ut talks about, the ones that have been found abandoned, raised, and have since raised children of their own. When the children communicate, they work with delicate gemstones, or simple statues; in all cases it's the destruction of the anchor that builds the temporary bridge. So the feathers are distributed by the Children, and Ir has several, lest he needs to summon a Teacher in haste. In old times the Children used the feathers, and Beronwen's children used the feathers, but somehow the rituals changed ...

Tilara listens to the running translation, a bit frustrated that she's missing many of the details. "You've got to teach me this language, Starguard."

Starguard says, "I certainly need to teach somebody..."

Ash lightly tugs at the crystal, smiling and nodding his head politely to the caninoid trader. "And now, sir... are you interested in talking further with the actual elders and sages of these people?"

Utillirionin looks up from his conversation, a look almost of dismay crossing his features, as though he understands that this fascinating conversation may soon come to a halt. He holds the crystal reverently, as yet not willing to let it go. He has found, it would appear, a new and worthy Teacher.

The abbot, too, seems fascinated. His voice sounds twenty years younger, at least, and he answers Ash with a short "Yes, I am." before switching back into the Firstborn tongue. Their speech speeds up even more, hurrying through the exchange of as much information as possible, the abbot seemingly intent on draining the creature dry.

Ash coughs a little more loudly. "Abbot... sir.... We have things for this Ut to take care of. Dangerous things. But we can direct you to a more knowledgeable scholar..."

The abbot pauses. "Ah. Yes. Ummm. Please."

Ash firmly retrieves the crystal, depositing in Stormy's hands. "Alright, lad.. Hopefully our guide is still loitering beyond, and you have a translator who can speak Firstborn here... Come back to us when you are ready, but.. and this is important.." He clasps the boy's shoulder with one hand, looking intently. "Do not let go of the crystal. We'll need it."

Stormy nods, cradling the crystal in both hands. The abbot's voice sputters a moment, before Stormy explains what will happen, and then turns into a catechism. While he's walking, there's no reason Stormy can't get a bit of learning in, right?"

Starguard smiles, and works closely with the giant and the kobold, acting as an interpreter to get them to reach an agreement...one that gives the White Company a percentage, of course.

Starguard quickly manages to help the two come to a deal. In exchange for what help the giant can offer, and letting the kobolds move towards the surface if necessary, the kobolds offer to help smooth out the stone work in the giant's cave.

After the negotiations, the company returns to the Kobold halls, both to speak further with Ir, and to retrieve Stormy, Andreth, and the crystal, which has finally gone inert, as its power is exhausted for the day. Not until the following morning will it be useful again.

During the next few days, with Starguard educating the kobolds in the ways of the priesthood and with the abbot's persistent patience in translation, the White Company learn much about the nature of their hosts. The Labyrinth, it seems, is a far larger thing than the party first anticipated, for these creatures are still building it. For Jurdah. For the Gods they build monuments, and perhaps this is where the journeymen and 'prentices of their people go to. If these are not the Builders, muses Ash, who else could be?
