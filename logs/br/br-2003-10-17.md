Among the kobolds, negotiations begin. Ash makes his argument, via Starguard, that whatever magical weapons of war the kobolds can be safely placed in the humans' hands, since they are setting out to accomplish something the kobolds may have been forced to do anyway. In the end, the party is presented with nearly two dozen individual items, created by the obscure powers of alchemy and sorcery that dwells even among these strange subterranean creatures.

After several minutes of consultation with the Builders' hunters, the White Company also arrives at what sounds like a functional plan. One tunnel, one with a vertical exit somewhere and a downward slope as well, is to be blocked off. The slope will be greased, resulting in a one-way trip down to the "plug" that blocks off the tunnel. From there, the comparatively defenseless boar can be killed with little to no risk of harm.

A few hours' time, and the assistance of the White Company, is needed to block off one end of the chosen tunnel, once the plan has been examined for flaws. The giant supplies a strong liniment whose odiferous properties should repel the tuskers for the time required. The tunnel's slope is greased, a rope is prepared, and Andreth prepares to perform the dangerous task of baiting the tuskers into the tunnel, which is somewhat outside the normal domain of these strange beasts.

Andreth checks his equipment, once he understands the plan. Bullseye lantern... check. A magic lantern as backup... check. A sling and plenty of bullets... check. Satisfied, he squares his shoulders and prepares to set off... when a thought occurs to him. Turning back to Ash, he says, "Okay, so how do I _find_ these critters, anyway?"

Ash shrugs. "If they like kobold, what do kobolds eat?" he asks. "Stock up on some of those mushrooms, maybe?"

Starguard hmms. "Just worried about these things being smart enough to get on our level as well."

Andreth chuckles at Starguard. "Well, we'll just haveta find out, won't we?" Confidently he sets out, directing the bullseye lantern down tunnels as he goes... carefully noting which tunnels he takes, and sticking to the larger ones.

After a few turns, Andreth realizes how good the odds of getting lost are, and turns back to borrow a piece of chalk. Now, he marks his treal as he wanders downwards. As he walks down the passages, following one tunnel after another and slowly moving deeper underground, Andreth notices that some of the walls have pictograms on them. And runes. And writing. Seven lines of text, in the alphabets used by the empire, as well as severl lines above in other possible alphabets. The words seem odd though; some kind of long genealogical expression.

Andreth puzzles over the new markings, his confidence ebbing... but not much, not yet. Perhaps these markings were left by the distant ancestors of the kobolds, or something else long-gone. And in any case, he's still confident that his legs will carry him out of danger. Still, as he continues, he keeps his own trail-markings well out of the body of the existing inscriptions, and makes a note to bring his more studied companions back here when the hunt is over.

After a while, though, Andreth notices that several of the markings are much more recent. This is much more troubling - unless it was the survivors of the kobold missions, there are other thinking minds down here with him. Enough is enough, he decides, and begins to retrace his steps...

All is well, and Andreth easily follows the chalk, retracing his steps until he comes to one intersection ... where the chalk seems to have been erased from the walls.

The lantern's beam shuttles from one wall to the next at the intersection... with no trail-mark to be found. Andreth sighs and curses softly, setting the lantern down by his feet and leaning against a wall, while he slowly and carefully ponders his next move.

Andreth reaches his starting point, and at the top of the tunnel calls out, "Ahooooy! C'mon out, folks, somethin' new 'as cropped up." Once the White Company reassembles, he explains his disturbing findings - not only are the walls of the deeper chambers marked in a clearly intelligent fashion, he found that something had erased his own marks when he tried to retrace his steps. "You was right, Starguard - somethin' out there's smart."

"The question is," suggests Ash, "whether it is the tuskers themselves, or perhaps their masters?"

Starguard says, "Let's not suppose any masters until we've seen 'em. We don't want to underestimate the tuskers."

Andreth shakes his head. "Either way, it ain't gonna fall fer a simple trap." He stares down the greased tunnel. "I kinda don't think any o'us should go out there wi'out nothin' better 'n chalk to find our way."

Andreth's companions point out that the earlier mark could've been rubbed off by something brushing against the wall. Against this, they affix the chalk to a short stick, and the intrepid monk sets out once more. This time, however, he tries something different. When he reaches the tunnel where the mark had been erased, he marks the ceiling and moves on as usual, letting a mushroom fall from his hand and onto the ground. Some ways down the tunnel, though, he shutters his lantern and doubles back a short distance, lacking the use of his eyes and depending on his ears to warn him of trouble, and a hand on the tunnel wall to guide his steps. When he judges that he's close enough to hear anything that might be coming after him, he stops and waits, close to the wall, and as silently as he possibly can.

After a few tense moments in the silence Andreth hears a faint snuffling. A shuffling sound, of leather sliding over the tunnel's floor, barely audible, and the snuffling of ... well perhaps of someone with a cold? Or something? Or ...

Sliding the shutter off the lantern, Andreth shines it down the tunnel. Back where he left the mushroom, he now sees a giant tusked swine, with leather socks on its hooves, its nose poking at the mushroom cautiously. Looking up at the sudden light, red eyes focus fully on Andreth.

Snorting, air blowing, the great swine swings around, agile and light on its feet, and charges straight at Andreth, eyes red, legs pounding, feet slapping against the rock. A mighty run that should have resulted in Andreth's death, were it not for one minor consideration. The boar missed.

Andreth swerves away from the creature's swinging tusks, and begins to maneuver around the creature in the tight tunnels. As he circles around, his callused palms lash out with repeated blows. One of them connects, but hardly makes an impression on the creature's tough hide.

Andreth and the boar duck and weave, the agile monk hard-pressed, but managing to keep out of range of the monster's attempts to gore him. He even lands another blow to the hairy flank of the creature, though without much more effect. Eventually, though, he has a clear space to the way from which he came, and ducking under one last swipe of a tusk, turns tail and legs it down the tunnel.

Behind him, Andreth can hear the board, snorting, snuffling, and running at full speed. Only with superhuman effort, in fact, can the young monk manage to stay ahead of the boar. He'd heave a sigh of relief when he reached the tunnel mouth, if he had the breath, but instead he manages to jump onto the grease, sliding it all the way down, as behind him the boar enters the grease less gracefully, blundering down at top speed. Isn't it nice how gravity works?

Andreth scrambles to his feet as he reaches the ungreased last few feet, deep in the tunnel-trap, and leaps up for the rope, climbing up it at breakneck speed and pulling it up behind him.

Ash holds up a hand. "No shooting, not yet.."

Starguard nods. But his crossbow is still loaded, and ready to shoot down...

Andreth dangles from the rope above the trapped tusker, and calls, "Halloooo down there! Ready ta rethink yer options?"

The boar snorts, struggling to regain its footing before rearing up, trying to gore Andreth where he hangs.

Andreth is well out of reach of the creature's tusks, fortunately. He hollers down the tunnel, "Starguard! It's got leather boots o' some sort! It belongs to some-un! Tell it ta sit! -in that funny lingo them kobolds use!"

Starguard nods, commanding in Firstborn. "SIT!" echoes through the tunnels...

The boar sinks to its haunches, still glaring up at Andreth, a thin line of drool dripping from one overgrown tusk.

Ash blinks a few times. "Well ain't that something."

Andreth laughs, and wriggles a mushroom from his pack and drops it down toward the boar. "Good boy!" he calls, grinning - although the creature may not understand his words, it'll understand the mushroom.

Catching the mushroom in midair, a single slobber disposes of it neatly.

Starguard blinks, shaking his head. "Stay," he says in Firstborn. "Well I'll be..."

With the tusker safely trapped - for the moment - the White Company withdraws to consider this new and unsettling arrangement. Just how many intelligent beings dwell in the depths of this rock, and how progressively stranger will they become?
