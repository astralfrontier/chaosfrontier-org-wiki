# Birthright 2003-11-28

The feast the Lady Achmadina serves is made up of many removes, each more delightfully tasting than the previous. As the evening wears on, tongues are loosened, and the White Company find themselves talking freely of many matters, much to Andreth's dismay. Still, as all good feasts must, this one, too, must come to an end. Smiling, drinking a last sip of the wine, Achmadina smiles at her torpid guests. "Would you care to guest overnight, dear friends? I have rooms for guests; the beds have been freshened, the pillows newly kneaded, the quilts properly aired ..."

"We really should get back," suggests Ash, voicing his most honest opinion in the most tactful manner he knows.

Starguard huhs, something hammering at the back of his mind. The rich food and drink has blurred his head...poison? Can't be. Not after a truce. "Before!" he says, groaning, fumbling for his belt and a particular vial.

Andreth wobbles as he stretches, glancing unhappily at his goblet one last time. He's felt out of sorts all evening, and from the... openness of the conversation tonight, his companions had it even worse. He shakes his head at the Lady. "We oughta be goin' back, really. Yer very courteous, I'll not be denyin' that, but we's imposed on ye enough for one evenin'."

Starguard quaffs a vial, letting it's healing properties course through him and up to his muddy brain, removing bits of poison.

Zinzer sits, dizzy from overindulgence. "Yes... we should return to our other hosts."

The lady smiles. "Well, I shall send my young friend along as your guide, then. He will show you to the upper tunnels, and will stay with you in case you wish to visit again ..."

Starguard says, "Yes. I think we should leave," Starguard seems very certain of the fact. "Now."

The boar rises to its feet, once again dwarfing most members of the party. After a single desultory snuffle at Andreth's pockets, it saunters up a wall, where two tapestries whisk out of its way. Tapping the ground, twice, with a leathershod hoof, it watches the door appear in the wall and slowly swing open.

Moving through, it waits patiently on the far side.

Starguard follows quickly, getting close beside the big pig. "Take us the most direct route," he whispers, "and I promise to get you a half-dozen truffles for your trouble."

Snuffling enthusiastically, the boar leads the company back by a different route. One that, oddly enough, takes them right back to the mushroom farms.

Andreth's eyebrows raise and he smiles weakly when he realizes where they've arrived. "Guess he was followin' 'is nose..." He shakes his head, holding it with one hand. "Somethin' about her... I dunno..." he mutters vaguely, eyeing the big pig.

Zinzer waves his hand dismissively. "She has power, yes, but she doesn't flaunt it. I think she's making herself look more potent than she is."

The big pig waits patiently for his reward. Or is it her reward? Who can tell. Ah well. Waited for at least half a minute. Long enough. Impatiently, it tries to nudge Starguard.

Starguard follows the pig, reaching high to mark a star high on the wall as they go through each crossing. Smiling, he heads into the farms, picking out the less...interesting truffles.

Zinzer frowns at the giant boar. "Now... I suppose you'll be hanging around for several days."

Starguard says, "Perhaps one of the kobolds would feed it. Make friends a bit, perhaps."

The pig looks hopeful.

Andreth says, "Y'heard the lady, Zinzer. The boars're gonna be around as long as there's mushrooms for 'em to be eatin' 'ere. They're 'er _children_, after all." He mutters a bit under his breath. "Now I think after a big meal like that wi'such _wonderful_ wine, we all could use a good night's sleep, 'n talk about all this on the morrow."

Starguard says, "Aye, Andreth. I think it's bedtime for everyone. Then you can all wake up and boot me in the rear for being idiotic."

Zinzer says, "Idiotic? Your only mistake was not drinking that wine. How many times in your life will you taste such a vintage?"

Starguard says, "I did. And I wish now that I didn't, Zinzer. Go to bed."

Andreth nods. "I'the _morrow_, says I," he says, tilting his head in the pig's direction, and without another word heads for the humble lodgings the party has among the kobolds.

The pig grunts, once, happily, eyeing the caves, and then hunkers down in front of one of them, his massive form blocking the doorway completely.

Zinzer awakens the next morning, groaning. "OH... what a dirty trick..."

Starguard is waiting in the gathering area as the party emerges, groaning from hangovers. A small burst of magic clears painful heads.

Andreth sits up from his bedroll, flinching slightly but shrugging off Starguard's offer to help. His system may have thrown off the worst effects of the drinking, but he is still left with a smidgen of headache. All the same, from the groaning of his companions, it's clear they're far worse off than he. "So next time we all get offered a drink by someone we dinna know, we're a-sayin' no, right?"

Zinzer says, "Sneaky does not imply powerful. We saw no evidence that her magic is all that great."

Starguard says, "Agreed, Andreth."

Starguard says, "However, see is a kobocidal, evil, warmongering bitch that needs to be stopped. Anyone up for that in about...oh, 35 hours or so?"

Andreth glances at Starguard. "Hm. Then what was all this about not refusin' hospitality?" His forehead creases. "Is that somethin' ta do with yer thirty-five hours there?"

Zinzer says, "I'll have to think about that one. I don't have any particular problem with her philosophy, but I do think competition like that is too dangerous to leave around."

Starguard nods to Andreth. "Harming someone within two days of breaking bread and salt is a very bad religious faux pas. The sort that brings the Gods down on you. Bad luck, so to speak. However, since she poisoned us before the bread and salt..."

Zinzer says, "Then the Gods are quite perverse, Starguard."

Andreth nods, sighing. "Yeah, and gi'n that we seem ta have the attention of the Gods anyhow, we don't wanna be provokin' 'em." He rubs his chin. "Quite a pretty mess we got oursel's in... but yeah, we gotta do somethin' about 'er. And pro'ly for the best that we got some time ta think about it, cos I don't think we want ta just tangle wi' 'er head on."

Starguard says, "Why not? We have an army at our disposal. Or at least a good sized unit."

Andreth counters, "And so does she. B'lieve me, I tangled with our furry friend down there," he says, nodding toward the mushroom farms. "'sides, our army's already come off the worst 'gainst 'ers. That's why _we're_ here, after all."

Zinzer says, "I think it's important to ask... what is SHE going to do in two days?"

Starguard says, "Set about three tons of traps, I suspect. She certainly knows how to use her magic..."

Andreth raises a hand theatrically, looking around at the doors and walls.

Zinzer says, "Hmm? Hmm."

As the party quiets down at Andreth's gesture, his roving eyes finally see what he's looking for, and his hand comes down pointing towards a doorway. Peeping out from the edge of the door frame is the tiny snout of a piglet.

Zinzer frowns.

Andreth nods to Starguard, and makes an unusual hand gesture meaning, roughly, _Keep talking, I'm going to try to sneak up on it._ With that, he lets the conversation continue as he creeps around the edge of the room toward the door...

Starguard says, "I mean, with all those spells, the food was too good to be non-magical..."

Zinzer says, "Perhaps. But she was quite cagey about what she shows off, and it doesn't take high magic to make good food."

Andreth lets Starguard's voice cover his footfalls, as he makes his way around the room. As he reaches the door, he opens it with a sudden movement and leaps forward to catch the piglet revealed on the other side...

"Gotcha, little friend," says Andreth as the piglet leaps back just a little too late for his hands to close around it. "Now what'll we do with you, I wonder..." He looks up at his friends. "No need to provoke the Lady too soon, says I. How bout we keep our little guest 'ere well fed on mushrooms till 'tis time for us to pay 'er a visit oursel's?"

The piglet squeals enthusiastically, obviously keen on this idea ...

Zinzer says, "Although one wonders what magic it takes to make a piglet able to handle kitchen tools."

Starguard says, "I think we should release the little bugger after the visit. Who knows how well it listens."

Andreth chuckles quietly, and feeds the small creature from his mushroom pouch. Not nearly so hard to keep this little one fed as it was his big brother. Or her, or her sister, possibly, Andreth's no farmer. "I say, it's easy enough to keep 'er children happy. Give 'em mushrooms and they're happy as... well, y'know. Pigs."

The piglet squeals again, nuzzling closer to Andreth.

Zinzer mutters a few words and waves his right hand, and carefully peers at the piglet.

Zinzer says, "She might become upset or suspicious if the piglet does not return. Starguard, do you not have some way with animals?"

Starguard says, "I can speak with them. Charming them is a little out of my league, I'm afraid."

Zinzer frowns. "Are you telling me you can't outsmart a piglet?"

Starguard says, "Outsmart, certainly. Convince it to change sides? That takes more time than we have, I think."

Starguard says, "I'm willing to try, mind."

Andreth grins at Starguard. "How many _mushrooms_ d'you think it takes?" he says, dangling another mushroom in front of the little creature.

Zinzer says, "Then go ahead and try. And... we must make our own plans. The question of what that woman will do in a day in a half still remains unanswered."

The piglet squeals again, stretching for the mushroom, it's little jaws snapping shut in vain and frustration.

Starguard hmms. "Might as well talk with both of them. See if we can convince them both."

Zinzer says, "You need only convince them to tell her what we want her to hear. And... perhaps to tell us all about their wonderful mistress."

Starguard ahs. Yes. He makes healing potions and coverts the pigs if possible. That's his objectives for the next day and a half.

Zinzer says, "The piglet isn't ensorcelled. If she's using it as a spy, it's indirectly. I don't think she's magically eavsdropping."

Andreth chuckles. "Well, y'never know. How 'bout I take our li'l friend down to visit big brother, while y'all have a chat?" He picks up the piglet, feeding it the mushroom at last, then takes it on out of the room. "If y'have any questions for 'im, Starguard, y'know where ta find us."

Starguard nods. "We'll both go down to chat. We'll see if I can convert them to our side with logic. And start brewing some healing draughts."

Andreth grins at Starguard, as they head for the mushroom farm. "I think the pigs'll pay more attention ta mushrooms th'n logic, but whatever makes ya happy."

Leaving Starguard in the mushroom farms to talk to the pig (and keep it happy with an adequate supply of fungus), Andreth returns to the quarters, and he and the rest of the party head back to Stormy, Jellin, and Ellinor. The previous night's encounter is described in much detail - the woman's appearance, the drugged wine that was served, her history, and her evident interest in the Changer girls. This last is described in apologetic tones, for the White Company's loose lips have potentially put Ellinor and Jellin in danger - and now they will be asked to briefly accept greater danger, that the threat may be dealt with once and for all.

While Ellinor looks apprehensive, clutching at Jellin's and Stormy's hands, Jellin looks more resolute. or possibly pissed. Either that, or she's constipated. Generally, she's not looking happy.

Jellin looks at Ellinor, who looks back. "Black skinned ... white haired ..." Ellinor turns pale, her eyes rimmed with moisture, her shoulder drooping in fear. Ellinor nods back, then turns to Andreth. "We have such tales. They are not kindly tales. These Children of Limera ... as they style themselves ... have little in common with their parent. They've adopted the colours of the dark, living underground as they do. One song tells that Brother Sun himself burned the skin black in vengeance for some ancient slight." She shrugs, nudging Stormy, who takes up the tale. "The dark skinned ones adopt foundlings. They raise them, and train them, and in time the foundlings begin to resemble their adoptive parents."

Andreth raises an eyebrow at Stormy. "Ye've learned much in yer time wi' the Changers, haven't ye, Stormy?" he says, wonderingly. "More 'n I have, I know."

Stormy shakes his head. "No ... not really. Ferg taught me of them. He sometimes threatened to sell me underground." The boy - actually, a young man now - shrugs. "It was one of his lesser ploys." He looks haunted, nonetheless, at the mention of his time with the Changers.

Down with the pigs, Starguard has cast a spell to speak with the big pig and this little piglet. "Really, do you want to be fighting these kobolds? I mean, you could work with them. And they could pay you truffles. While you could take them, we know you like 'em, and the kobolds might stop growing them if you're stealing them.

The bigger boar looks intrigued. "Work? Work how? Do what?" The little piglet squeals "Mushroomsmushroomsmushroomsmushrooms!", jumping up and down!

Starguard feeds the little one a mushroom to shut it up, and gives the big one one too. "Help make tunnels, or pull things. You're pretty strong, which is something that the kobolds might find useful."

The big one pauses, after snuffling the mushroom, and feeds it to the piglet cautiously. "We ... we leave Lady? We meats."

"Dead meats."

Starguard says, "Not if we defeat the lady. Which is what we're going to do. What if all of you fight with the lady? Pretty hard for even you to fight off hundreds of piglets, right?"

The pig looks aghast. "Fight my babies?" It snorts, nudging Starguard in the chest. "No hurting my babies!"

Starguard says, "No. I don't hurt your babies. But, if all fight the ladies, it's like all your babies pushing at you. Good chance they win. Why you dead meats if you fight the lady?"

The pig moves in front of the piglet, obviously trying to shelter it with her much bigger bulk. "The Lady ... She powerful. She ... she breed? Breed us up? Kill those who ... who ... who stupid." A brief pause to nuzzle the piglet. "She kill from far, and close. Kill slooow. Kill whole litter if one stupid."

Starguard hmms. "How far? Does the lady have to see you? Maybe run far from lady, so she doesn't kill you?"

A much longer pause. "Not know. Not tested. Never tested. Babies lived. Babies thrive. No want risk hurt babies."

Starguard nods. "So, if we kill lady, you work with kobold who make mushrooms?"

The pig pauses, one hoof tapping the floor meaningfully.

Starguard just feeds the pigs mushrooms for a while, scritching them, not speaking about anything important. Just seeing what mushrooms they like...

The piglet, especially, is fond of mushrooms, its belly slowly swelling and distending as it accepts everything offered. The bigger one is more cautious, and more discerning, sharing some with the piglet, enjoying others itself.

Meanwhile, the rest of the White Company begins to make their plans to deal with The Lady. They hope to use her interest in the Changers against her, but how this can be done shall require careful forethought - and a good deal of effort - over the remaining day and a half before the truce expires.
