# Birthright 2003-12-12

Ash speaks to the kobolds, receiving brief translation where necessary, about a simple question - 'are there any places in the area that interfere with magic, and what are they like?'. He is no sorcerer or spellcaster; the subtle and not-so-subtle powers wielded by his companions, honestly, fill him with a little bit of fear, even when they serve to save his life, and times past when such enchantment has meant his survival, and that of his newfound friends, comes to his mind as he speaks. Nevertheless he is a warrior, and thinks like one. The Lady may be wise and influential, but she may be stripped of her arcane power. Nor she does not look immune to honest steel.

The kobolds are quick and happy to sketch out a number of possible regions, which form almost a concentric ring. A porous ring, there's one tunnel that leads right between the zones ... But other than that each tunnel in this area leads to a space that is blacker than black; lights dim, magic refused to work, and death walks.

The areas are described much like a honeyed bottle trap; the innocent fly flies deeper and deeper through the one safe passage, before finally getting trapped, unable to turn around and retrace its steps.

Zinzer prepares a scrying ritual to see what Achmadina is up to. He chooses a small room near the center of the kobold settlement, and hangs a curtain on the door. The scrying focus is a silver bowl filled with clear, cold water. Zinzer spends the next hour making arcane markings of wax and chalk on the floor, walls, and ceilings of the room; it's difficult to tell if they're part of the spell, or merely for amusement.

Zinzer asks Starguard for advice on what to look for. "We only have seven minutes, and there's a real good chance that she'll notice what I'm doing. Can her... children... give us any ideas on when and what to look for?"

Starguard nods, switching to Firstborn, though his spell to speak with the pigs directly has long since run out. "When is your mistress busy most often? Morning? Lunch? Afternoon?" He's interrupted by a grunt. "Afternoon? Alright. Thank you." Switching back to Trader, he informs Zinzer.

Zinzer nods. "Should be right on time, then." He delays the start of the ritual until one hour after noon. The chalk drawings he's making now are very obviously for amusement only.

After centering himself, Zinzer bends over the bowl of water, the arcane syllables traveling past his lips, stirring the water. The water ripples, slowly becoming blacker and blacker, until the water resembles nothing so much as a flat black puddle of ink. Then a single light; a flame, begins to dance in the centre. It dances energetically, its shape twisting around a black object at first poorly seen.

Now the vision begins to lighten, as the flame's light spreads. The black object is a feather, already half burnt away, held in the flames by a single darkskinned hand. Words chant a mystic spell; one that Zinzer doesn't recognize. His hackles do, however, raising to their fullest height.

Slowly the vision expands further, driven on by Zinzer's curiosity. The hand, Achmadina's hand, drops the last of the feather in the brazier, where the flame consumes it, before flaring up high. From the flame she picks, delicately, a scroll case, and then she places a piglet where the scroll case hung in mid air. Moments later, all that remains of the piglet is a panicked squeal.

_Interesting,_ thinks Zinzer. _I wonder what mother pig would think of that._

Then the squeal, too, fades from all but memory, and Lady Achmadina leans forward to blow the flame out. Now, the entire room springs into focus, as though the flame had sucked up all the light, before. Here, there are no wall hangings. The room she is in, though it lacks windows and visible doors, is obviously devoted to study of the craft. On one wall, a bookcase stands, filled with scroll case. The brazier, in front of her, sits on a sturdy, scarred, wooden table.

The scroll case ... sits on the table. Picking it up, she taps it thoughtfully, before uncapping it and sliding out several sheets of vellum. "A shopping list, a few notes, and ..." She pauses, then glares. "Again! Again they reject my article for lack of proper formatting. Don't they see? Don't they ..." She stops dead, looking up. "Well. Someone certainly sees." Her eyes look up out of the bowl, her gaze pointing straight at Zinzer.

Zinzer blinks, and shrugs, and continues to watch. _Oh, well. I expected that. She's unlikely to do anything interesting now, but maybe we can see how she deals with interlopers._

The eyes loom large; soon, they seem to consume the entire bowl; there is little to be seen beyond them, as they look. There is a sense of doom here, and a sense of strong, righteous anger. And somewhere, a little girl is laughing and sucking on her lollypop.

Zinzer sighs. "Well, I suppose that's the answer to that question." He begins to wind down the casting and end the spell.

Zinzer says, "I should have tried scrying on the mother pig. She'd be unlikely to take so much offense. Well, that's that, I suppose." He stands up and goes to relate his findings, such as they are, to the White Company.

Meanwhile, down nearer to the truffles, Starguard sat with Stormy, helping him with potion making. "You're getting pretty good Stormy. I forget sometimes how much you're progressing as a crafter. And a sorcerer."

Tilara nods, looking a bit rueful. "You're better than I am, now. What happened to you while you were waiting for us during that Test with the Changers?"

Stormy shrugs, looking bashful. "When you were gone so long ... after the first day, we began to talk. By the third day we were both half starving, and hungry, and Ellin picked the lock. We ... we were in this strange valley." He stops, his face pale. "We had to improve quickly to survive, and even so we were losing more every day."

Tilara looks puzzled. "But we were only gone for a day. How long did it seem to you?"

Stormy shrugs. "Days? Weeks? Maybe a month? We couldn't tell. We were so hungry, and so thirsty, and ... we were trying to survive, Tilara. The grass would cut, the water would purge our bowels, and the mosquitoes - great flying beasts with sharp stingers, ready to suck us dry at a moment's inattention ..."

Stormy continues slowly. "The others, especially the Cat man, tried to find their own way out. They wouldn't speak to us. The Wolf was wounded early, and found a cave to die, but the Cat ... he called us weaklings, and nithlings, and would have nothing to do with us."

Starguard says, "So long...?" He frowns, the thought of Stormy suffering so uncomfortable for him. "I should have insisted that I be the one..."

Tilara says, "Weird. But that does sound like the Cats. They all acted like that."

Stormy bites his lip. "We didn't know, and I would have slowed you down ..."

Starguard says, "You're more use than we tend to give you credit for. You've been learning as fast or faster, that's for sure. These new spells..." He shrugs.

Looking at the cauldron, Stormy shrugs. "We needed them. They ... came ..."

Tilara opens her mouth, and then shuts it while Starguard says his piece. She nods, then. "You were as powerful a sorceror as I was at that point, Stormy, and you're stronger now. You're certainly not going to slow us down. D'you think we would've made you a member of the Company if we didn't think you could pull your weight?"

'I don't know, Tilara. But ... I learned more in captivity. We both learned. A lot." Stormy smiles a little wistfully. "Jellin is amazing, you know. What she can do with a dagger and a bow ..."

Tilara grins at the ... _no, not boy any more, and I'd best stop thinking the word. The young man._

Starguard nudges Stormy before he can get too lost in memories. "Stir your potion." He works on balancing his three draughts in attention, making sure none fail.

Tilara waits while the brewers attend to their magic. When they have another lull, she asks, "So how did you end up in the cages again when we got back, if you were roaming the valley trying to find food?"

Stormy shakes his head. "I don't know. I think ... He stops. We thought we were dying. We lay down, and we couldn't get back up, and then this shade flew up, and she ... I don't know what she did, but she led us to a cave, and from there to the cage. And then you arrived, and Jellin almost died, and ..." He stops for a moment, stirring the potion fiercely.

Tilara puts a hand on his shoulder, trying to be comforting. "But she didn't, did she? The Company came through for both of you. You love her, don't you?"

Stormy stirs fiercely.

Tilara waits to see if he'll answer, but then nods to herself as he just stirs. "Don't overdo it. I think you can bruise the potion."

Stormy nods, blushing beet red as he bites his lip.

Tilara says, "Thought so. You went through a lot together, and she's good people. Have you asked her how she feels about you?"

Stormy shakeshakeshakes his ehad, his spoon beginning to turn more rapidly.

Tilara nods again. "There'll be time on this trip. Wait until it feels right, and if you want to ask me anything, just ask. You were sort of like my little brother when we met, and now you've grown up. But I'm here for you, whatever you need me for. You know that, don't you?"

Stormy murffles something, still blushing and looking at the pot, and stirs, and stirs, and sloshes a little.

Zinzer wanders in, sniffing the air. "Ah. Alchemy. The distinctive smell of... umm... you know, I don't know what that is. But I suppose it's an improvement over braised rat."

Starguard says, "Lemon rind is a good part of mine healing potions."

Zinzer \[to Starguard\]: "I think I should have tried watching the mother boar. Her Darkness detected my interloping and prevented me from getting much. You might want to tell the mother boar that she's been using some of her piglets in experiments, though."

Starguard blinks. "Perhaps you should tell me exactly what happened, Zinzer, and I'll translate."

Tilara says, "Didn't she already know that the Black Witch was getting rid of the less intelligent piglets?"

Zinzer says, "Well, all I really saw was her burning something... a feather, I think... and when it was done, there was a scroll case left behind. She traded the scroll case for a piglet and the piglet disappeared. She made some odd comments about something being 'rejected' for being 'improper', and then... well... she blocked my spell."

Zinzer says, "All things considered, I would have seen more of her lair by spying on a piglet."

Tilara spews a sip of water all over the floor. "A _feather_? She burned a _feather_??"

Starguard stops in mid-stir himself, staring at Zinzer.

Zinzer says, "Yes. Rather odd, that, burning things for travel magic. I got the impression that there was a definite endpoint, someone she was corresponding with."

Zinzer looks around. "What, do I have a smudge on my lapel?"

Andreth is likewise startled from his meditation. Into the shocked silence, he says, slowly, "In our travels, we've dealt with... other foes what used burnin' feathers to travel from one place t'another. Pow'rful foes. Dangerous foes."

Tilara says, "Details. We need details. We've not seen them do it, we've been trying to piece it together after the fact. How do they do it?"

Zinzer sniffs. "Oh, well, then we've nothing to fear. You must be quite used to dealing with her ilk by now, yes?"

Ash chimes in. "We're used to dealing with such people, yes. That's why we have something to fear."

Starguard says, "Not...exactly. I think the best we can claim is a draw. However, I don't think anyone will have a problem attacking her now."

Andreth shakes his head. "Don't ye remember, Tilara? Once we followed such a portal oursel's," says the young monk as he continues. "Tryin' ta save Stormy what was captured. An' we ended up in a maze. In the Underworld." He looks around at the cave walls. "Ha' we come down ta the Underworld now? By the other way?"

Tilara says, "Exactly. We went through it and ended up in the wrong place. How did they control it? Was there an additional spell?"

Zinzer says, "I saw little else, Tilara. She was holding the fire in a flame, like a candleflame, and it drew the attention of my spell, so that I could see little else. I think perhaps it distracted Achmadina as well, which is why she didn't expel me sooner. There must be some concentration involved, and possibly some intent by the caster."

Zinzer says, "It also appeared to be a two-way connection... I don't think the piglet was... slain. I think it was exchanged."

Starguard takes a moment to relate all of this to big mama, seeing her reaction to it.

Andreth says, "How d'ye know it was the wrong place, Tilara? If ye remember, we burned our own feather there - warn't someone else. We don' know where the portal was s'posed to go, seein' as it were just an illusion o' Stormy in th' circle."

Tilara says, "Interesting..."

Tilara nods to Andreth. "Well, true - but my point is that we didn't control it, and we didn't end up quite where we wanted."

The large boar, listening intently, looks at Zinzer. Her hackles are raised, and somehow she seems taller than usual.

Zinzer says, "Perhaps you should tell me the whole story, starting from the beginning."

Zinzer edges away from the boar. "Starguard... can that oversize truffle fetch understand me?"

Andreth grins at Zinzer. "If she can, mebbe y'ought ta be more respectful how you speak o' her."

Starguard says, "No, I translated to Firstborn. However, she's not pleased." _It really isn't his fault. He just saw it._

Tilara says, "Tell you the whole story? Aye, I think you're right, we should... but it'll take a while."

The boar grunts something. The vocal chords are shaped wrong, but the grunt - the word - sounds like an ancient word for "school". Drawn out, barely comprehensible, but ... she doesn't sound angry. Not exactly.

Starguard blinks. _School?_ he repeats. "School?"

Zinzer keeps the table between himself and the boar, tapping a heel softly against the floor.

A single grunt, in the affirmative.

Starguard says, "Hmmm...oh no. Berina?"

Zinzer says, "This is how she sends the piglets to... school?"

Starguard is glad when the pig doesn't appear to recognize the name...but there still is a problem.

Noticing Zinzer's confused expression, Ash takes it upon himself to begin explaining. He is no great bard, though he carries some of the surety and conviction his mentor left with him, and through the old man's teachings and tales, he finds the words to adequately tell a tale. For the big fighter, things began at Ferg's gang, but some of what came before is known to him, as is the name "Berina". The steps from Woolwich to Citadel and beyond are laid out in his best speaking voice, describing the machinations of the assorted users of feathers and other arcane mysteries.

Zinzer listens, arms crossed on his chest, head bowed, eyes narrowed, thinking carefully. "All my life I chase such wonders... and you lot, scarecely out of your homes, find all of this with hardly an effort. As if the secrets of this world seek you out and are repulsed by me."

Ash shrugs ruefully. "If you wish to exchange destinies with us, you're welcome to try," he says with a smile. "I for one would not really object."

Zinzer loses his perpetual sour near-sneer expression for a moment. Just a moment. "Tempting." But then his mask resumes. "We should see if that destiny goes beyond these caverns first."

The question is broached to Jellin and Ellinor. Ash explains the situation, calmly and patiently, feeling a cold knot in his stomach as he proposes that the party's charges walk knowingly into danger. It's a hard thing for a protector and bodyguard to ask, and his voice wavers only a bit as he puts the question. A slow, proud smile sweeps over his roughly-hewn features as both give their assent. One weight lifts from his shoulders, moving aside so that another can settle in, and the fighter rejoins the rest of the White Company in its grim planning.
