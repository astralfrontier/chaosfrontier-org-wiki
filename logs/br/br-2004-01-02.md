# Birthright 2004-01-02

As before, a section of the rock wall moves aside, revealing the room beyond. The room looks a lot more subdued, without Achmadina's fascinating presence. The pillows still line the floors, tapestries still hand on the walls, and the throne stands empty, holding but a single pillow.

Zinzer shifts uncomfortable from foot to foot, his recent experience with the exploding runes still fresh in his mind... and in his nostrils. "So... umm... who would like to go first?"

Tilara moves forward cautiously, another cantrip to detect magic spoken as she tries to remember everything she ever learned from Yuri about mechanical traps.

Starguard raises an eyebrow. "I think it might be best if I guarded the doorway. You only have so many potions of healing on you."

As before the room positively glows with magic, although the throne is now curiously blank. That magic, obviously, came from Achmadina before. But the tapestries still ripple in the non-existent breeze.

Zinzer nods, and advances cautiously, a few paces behind Tilara, using his staff to probe the floor and walls around him.

Zinzer says, "I think it might be best if you stuck close, old son. I hate to admit the degree to which I'd have been hurt without you here a few minutes ago."

Starguard hmmphs. "Imagine the degree you could get hurt if I were unconcious, Zinzer. I'd prefer to stay back here by the door." He idly scratches big momma behind the ears, not budging from the doorway.

Moving a few steps further into the room, Tilara spots not a single trap. She does, on the other hand, spot the doorway into another room, carefully hidden by an ornate tapestry. A tapestry that seems to depict an oak grove.

Andreth is curious about Tilara's find. "Oak trees?" he asks, examining the tapestry as best he can. "Wonder if this means somethin'..." he mutters.

Tilara points to the tapestry. "Well, there's the fact that pigs are supposed to be fond of acorns. Let's see...." Having seen nothing to indicate traps, she takes the end of her quarterstaff and gently lifts the tapestry out of the way.

The tapestry ripples along Tilara's staff, stretching conveniently out of the way, showing the narrow passage beyond; a passage just wide enough for a single woman or one of the smaller piglets. The mother swine, having entered the main room, stands quietly, watching Starguard.

Zinzer moves towards the throne, carefully prodding the floor and cieling with his staff. _The seat of her power, as it were._

Starguard switches to Firstborn. _Mother Pig, would you caution my friends if they are about to touch something that might hurt them?_ he asks, worried as he watches his friends poke around the room...

Moving further into the room, Zinzer approaches the throne carefully, circling it to look at it from all angles. It's covered in gold leaf - unlikely to be gold all the way through - and set with gorgeous jewels, each easily worth a king's ransom. Well, a small king. Maybe a chieftain. Of a nomadic tribe. But still. The patterns are intriguing, forming shapes and sounds that could almost be runes ...

Nodding, pressing close to Starguard, the large boar snorts quietly. _There is no danger here to a piglet when Lady away._

Tilara is reminded of something as she hears Starguard speaking to the pig. "Ask her if this is where she takes the young ones?"

Zinzer puts down his staff and traces the patterns on the back of the throne curiously, drawing a notebook from his pack and making notes.

Starguard huhs. "Nice to know the piglets are safe. Ah, good thought, Tilara." _Is that the way the Lady would take the piglets to send them?_

_Yes._ The boar's voice is quiet, somber. _The only passage, my children run down, following her ..._

Ash notices Zinzer's actions and raises an eyebrow. "Hey, Zinzer... what're you doing there?" he asks, a note of worry in his voice.

Tilara turns at Ash's comment and her eyes go wide in alarm as she sees what Zinzer is doing. She yelps, "NO!" but a moment too late - it's only her juggler's reflexes that let her dive into the tunnel to escape the flames that erupt.

Ash's warning comes but a moment too late, as the patterns begin to coalesce in front of Zinzer's eyes into more familiar shapes. Shapes he'd seen only a few minutes and one pair of pants previously.

Shapes of runes, set to spill out flames, and fire, and general pain. Zinzer whimpers.

Ash coughs, waving away the smoke with both hands, as he wades into the chamber, Andreth close behind. "Zinzer, are you okay?" he calls out. "Starguard! See what you can do."

Starguard holds the door. "Bring them over to me. I'm not letting this door close and trapping us in here with all these booby traps."

Zinzer lies slumped against the wall, again charred, smoking and in pain. His lips work around the shapes to various words, his throat to charred to scream.

The dive takes Tilara headlong into the passage, and she finds herself skidding for a few moments, sliding under the flames, before coming to rest up against a wall. The passage, it seems, branches here, one branch turning left, the other right, although in the darkness there is little she can see. Especially after the flames destroyed her night vision.

Andreth nods to Starguard, as he and Ash carefully recover Zinzer, doing their best to take hold of him in unburned places, or by his robes, and get him to the entrance.

Tilara stands up cautiously and heads back up the tunnel to the outer chamber. _Note to self - don't read anything that isn't... actually, don't read anything._

Starguard is reading with his most potent healing magic. "Tilara! Are you alright?" he calls.

Zinzer groans. "It's... not that bad..."

Tilara calls back, "I'm fine! Thanks for the heads-up, Ash!" She comes out of the tunnel and shakes her head at poor Zinzer.

Starguard casts a healing spell on Zinzer. Zinzer stops him as he begins to cast again, reaching up and gripping his wrist. "Once is enough, thank you. Save it for someone else. Because I'm not going first again today."

Zinzer sits up and withdraws a sewing kit and the rags of his old clothes from his pack, and begins to mend his pants. "I would like the opportunity to rest for a few minutes and recover my dignity. And my trousers."

Tilara grins, trying to lighten the mood - though the whole place may be rigged with the runes. "I've got a spare skirt if you want."

Starguard pauses, magical energies fading on his hands. "Alright...Exploding runes. Very powerful, triggers when read, but can be taken out by Erasing or Dispelling them. If you don't accidentally set them off, anyway." He sighs. "They could be anywhere."

Tilara says, "And the trouble with Erasing them is that you can erase things you want to keep, too."

Ash remarks dryly, "And they will be, if we've encountered two of them in the space of ten minutes."

Zinzer says, "Maybe we don't have to erase them all... maybe just erasing a few will disarm the spell, but leave the sense of any non-exploding runes in place."

Starguard says, "And maybe it won't, and turn someone else into a crispy critter."

Zinzer says, "I can dispel some of them. It will take time."

Starguard says, "I think taking things slower might be...wise, no?"

Andreth nods. "Don't take any time at all to get yerself killed, if'n you rush inta things."

Tilara says, "Can Stormy help you with that?"

Starguard says, "Though if you're getting too close to them, I heal all your wounds before you even attempt it."

Stormy bites his lip, looking confused. "I don't even know why the patterns keep exploding."\\

Zinzer glances over at the fiery lad. "I don't know. You seem quite powerful for one so young. I think you know the risks. I wouldn't advise biting off more than you can chew."

Starguard says, "Stormy...can you read?"

Stormy nods slowly, and looks around. "Do we really have to search this room now? I'm ... worried."

Zinzer waves a hand at Tilara, and rummages in his pack for a spool of thread. "I suggest that the young lady make a quick survey of this place while she can still see the mystical rhythms... and then we can decide what the biggest hazards are." He hands Tilara a stick of chalk. "Use this to mark anything hazardous."

Tilara chuckles at her former protege. "They're magical traps, Stormy. The question is, do you know how to dispel another's spell-weaving? I can't do it... my talent doesn't run that direction."

At Starguard's question, Stormy blushes beet red.

Zinzer also hands Tilara a simple copper band. "And take this. Just in case you get lost."

Stormy turns to Tilara, shaking his head. "I can't. The spells I learned focused on protection ..."

Starguard chews his lip. "You'd recognize it as writing, though, which would be enough to set it off. Nothing to be ashamed of, Stormy. I've read of generals than could read, not to mention other great men. Useful thing to know, though."

Tilara glares at Starguard, and switches to Lurinese. "And what are ye embarrassing the lad for like that, ye big oaf? Ye know how he was raised. When would he have had a chance t'learn it?" She nods to Stormy, and accepts the ring from Zinzer. "For a locate spell, right? I'll do it as quick as I can."

Andreth scratches his head. "Well, we owe _somethin'_ to the momma pig, I know that. But... dunno if there's much I can do ta help..."

Tilara actually needs to renew the cantrip a third time, but she murmurs the spell and quickly marks off everything magically empowered in the room.

Starguard blushes a bit at Tilara's words. "My apologies. I didn't mean it like that. I thought that maybe not being able to read my be an asset here, to find the pattern of the runes, without setting them off. But it doesn't quite work that way."

Zinzer makes a patchworof his hat, and plops it on his (now bald) head. "Today, young man, literacy is not an asset. However, if you wish to learn, I will teach you. For one who knows magic, reading comes with only a little effort."

Biting his lip, Stormy nods at Zinzer. "Thank you. That's what Ferg used to say, too, when he ... when ..." He falls silent.

Zinzer watches Tilara work. "Think you can get that hallway to her study, Tilara?"

Zinzer pauses, and puts down his mending. "I am not Ferg, young master." And then, softer, "The wisdom of those words remains, despite the vileness of their source."

Tilara mutters distractedly as she works. "One step at a time... I can do the spell a few more times if need be." She does finish the outer room and moves to the T-corridor, but runs out of time before she can open either door.

Shaking his head, Stormy looks at the floor. "He said ... when he was beating ... he said ... it shouldn't be ... should come ... he said I was stupid for not knowing."

Starguard shakes his head. "Why would it, Stormy? You grab magic out of the air like pulling fish from a stream. It's us dusty old clerics and wizards who bend over ancient books observing rights and hunting old knowledge. There's a certain beauty in the way you do it. It's just a different way."

Both doors taunt Tilara with their closedness, their simple wooden shapes seemingly held motionless only with the aid of simple iron hinges, not a single lock to be seen.

Brightening a little, Stormy nods at Starguard. "It's just ... the reading never came ... not really."

Starguard nods to Stormy. "No reason it should. To fly, a soceress throws himself at the ground and misses. A cleric is carried by the Gods. And a wizard simply changes the numbers and facts of the rules."

Zinzer glances about uncomfortably, and resumes his mending.

Andreth grunts. "Ain't that the truth," he mutters. "Though Brother Oak was much more patient with me, I guess..." He sighs softly.

Zinzer says, "That's as imprecise a description of my path of power as it is of yours, old son."

Tilara finishes up and returns to catch the end of the conversation. "I'd be half-willing to bet that Ferg couldn't read well, himself."

Starguard grins. "I'm trying to be a poetic old fool, Zinzer. Leave an old man be."

Zinzer steps out to pull on his mended trousers. Not being particularly skilled with a needle, they do not fit well, but they suffice. He walks cautiously around the room inspecting the items Tilara has marked, careful to read none of them.

Tilara says, "There's two doors at either end of a T-corridor. Anyone want to guess which one is her study?"

Zinzer mutterrs an incancantation of his own and examines the tapestries, and the wall behind, being exceedingly cautious to turn away at the first sign of runes.

Andreth says, "I'll say the one on the left, just to pick one."

Zinzer taps the end of his nose. "Clever trick... but not all that powerful."

Starguard hmms?

Zinzer says, "Not that important. We have little to fear from the tapestries."

Zinzer says, "Did someone mention other doors?"

Tilara says, "Impressive enough, though." She nods. "While you were blowing yourself up the second time - there's two doors in opposite directions off a short T down this tunnel. Andreth says we should start with the one on the left, and I've got no reason to argue with that."

Standing in front of the wooden door, Tilara and Andreth look at it curiously. The passage here is narrow too, being only about three feet wide, if that, so that only one of them can look at closely at the door at a time. The door is held shut mostly by weight, it appears, the hinges on one side keeping it up, while there's no evidence of a lock, or a handle, holding it fast.

Hunkering down, Tilara inspects the bottom of the door, and spots a small peg, about piglet mouth height, that looks well chewed.

Tilara grins to herself. "Ah-hah. A piglet-type doorknob. Andreth? Let's check the other end before we do anything irrevocable, and see if there's a piglet doorknob on the other one."

Andreth nods to Tilara. "Sure, good idea."

Moving to the other door, Tilara again hunkers down, and finds a second equally well chewed peg.

Tilara says, "So. Both doors can be opened by piglets. Should be safe enough, then. This one, or shall we go back to the left side?"

Andreth shrugs. "Let's start with this one," he says. "I don't see no difference."

Pulling on the little peg, the door swings open easily, revealing a much larger room, mostly filled with barrels, caskets, and crates. In one corner, a cauldron hangs from a tripod in a hearth, and the scent of cooled mush fills the room, suggesting that the contents of that cauldron may have been intended for the pigs. In the opposite corner, in a basket, three piglets lie snoozing, snoring lightly.

Tilara grins. "Supplies and at least some of the piglets." She kneels down by them. "Hey little fellows, time to wake up..."

One of the little piglets jerks awake, looking at Tilara wide eyed, and then nuzzling her hand, licking and nudging, suggesting in the plainest of fashions that she's hungry.

Tilara chuckles. "All right, all right... let's go visit momma, shall we?" She stands up. "Or would you rather eat first? Hmmm..." She decides she can spare one cantrip on the piglets, and does a quick poison check on the cauldron of mush.

Andreth hmms and looks around. "I guess this's their bedroom 'n dinner room. Mebbe the next one's the study..." he says, turning to the other door whilst his companions tend to the latest collection of piglets.

Zinzer cautiously steps into the pantry and inspects it with his own dweamor-sensing magic. After a minute, he puts his chalk back in his pocket. "Nothing. Totally mundane. It is what it appears to be - the kitchen." He looks down. "And nursery, I suppose."

Tilara ladles out mush for the piglets, and suggests that perhaps some mushrooms would be in order to lead them out to their mother.

Squatting down, Andreth cautiously pulls on the peg of the other door, feeling the door open easily under his hand. Beyond, he sees a room, the corners oddly angled, with far too many walls. Eight walls, including the one in which the door is located. On each side, three walls are covered in tapestries, and straight ahead is a bookcase, filled with books and scrolls. In the centre of the room, a carpet is rolled up to the side, exposing the runes written in a circle below. Candlesticks hold candles, wax dripped as though great winds had blown in this room. Along the wall a simple table holds a deep bowl, now filled with inky water it appears, and a single notebook, left open to a page half covered in writing.

Andreth takes note of all these details, then quietly closes the door and turns around. "I found her study," he says flatly. "An' it's fulla... fulla..." he waves his hand as if trying to think of the right word... "fulla **stuff**."

Zinzer says, "Let me have a look. Here. You watch the piggies."

Zinzer pulls out his chalk and carefully opens the door to the room, looking for the telltale unnatural glow of magic.

Zinzer yelps, and closes the door again.

Starguard calls out from the main entrance. "Everyone alright?"

Tilara calls back, "I think Zinzer is spooked."

Andreth nods to Zinzer. "Bit much in there, isn't it? An' I can't even see the half of what you can, I guess."

Zinzer says, "It's... umm... there's a lot of... stuff... in there."

Zinzer says, "But it's definitely her study. It's where she was when I saw her before, save that she's got the carpet rolled up. I think she was doing some scrying of her own."

Stormy looks up from where he's standing at the entrance way to the passage. "She did insist on checking the wearabouts of the girls before she came with me to ... to ... to rescue them."

Zinzer looks queasy.

Tilara says, "Kidnap, Stormy. She would've tried to use them for her own ends, I'm sure."

Zinzer opens the door again, slowly, shielding his eyes, and tries to enumerate the sources of magic in the room.

Looking carefully, Zinzer sees magic everywhere he looks. The bookcase is glowing, the carpet is glowing, those fascinating runes on the floor are glowing, the tapestries on the walls are glowing. Only the bowl and the table aren't glowing.

Zinzer glances again at the runes on the floor, and sighs. "It's almost certainly a scrying spell... but I'm not taking any chances."

Tilara says, "Then don't. Everyone clear out, and let me do it."

Zinzer had raised a hand to begin casting a dispelling, then stops and looks at Tilara like he'd just gotten kicked in the (rather charred) seat of his pants. "YOU'LL dispel it?"

Tilara says, "No. I'll check it out, from as far away as I can. I know it's probably more of those damned runes, but I don't want to take the chance on erasing the portal to the rest of the piglets."

Zinzer blinks, and then trots off down the hall. And out the door. And flattens himself against a wall in a duck-and-cover position.

Andreth looks at Tilara. "What 'bout takin' a chance on _blowin' up_ the portal cos of those runes explodin'?"

Tilara says, "Hmmm... well, let's think about that. Was there any damage to the tapestries behind the throne when that one went off?"

Zinzer pops up. "Wait a minute."

Zinzer says, "Let's use logic here. The safest thing, of course, is to dispel the runes."

Tilara says, "Safest, but possibly resulting in loss of valuable information."

Zinzer says, "That's the only argument for NOT dispelling those runes, is if they are something unique, and therefore, not exploding runes."

Zinzer says, "If they aren't explosive... they they are almost certainly for scrying. And I know how to scry. Therefore, they are still not unique."

Zinzer says, "And so..." He stands up, walks back down the hall, and casts his dispel through the door. "I'm not taking chances. And I don't want you lot blowing up her library before we get a chance to inspect it."

Tilara says, "Hmmm. That does make sense. The braziers don't require runes on the floor. All right, go ahead and erase the things."

The runes boil up, out of the floor, spouting gouts of flame that reach for the ceiling. The floor begins to crack, and char, and then splits asunder, revealing a dark hole beneath.

Starguard jumps. "Stars! Ash, go an make sure everyone's alright, would you?"

Tilara shakes her head. "Looks like we were both right, Zinzer. It was exploding runes, and we should've left it alone until we'd cleared the place out. What's happened to the bookshelf?"

Zinzer blinks, turns around, and steps into the pantry. He closes the door carefully. The sound of a horrified shrieking shout emerges... after which Zinzer steps back into the hall. "I'm going to have a lie-down. Have fun."

Tilara peers through the smoke, and then mutters something pungently unladylike. "I think they're on fire." She charges in, right behind Andreth, to help put out flames.

Ash nods to Starguard, and goes back up the hallway, verifying to his relief that everyone is all right, although Zinzer seems badly shaken. Andreth, meanwhile, notices that the books seem to be smouldering, and rushes in to make sure they don't catch alight.

Tilara and Andreth race across the room, hurrying to the books. As they slap at the flames with gloves and hastily grabbed pieces of cloth, both feel the tingle of strong magic crossing their skin. Andreth breathes, shallowly, for the room is still filled with smoke, and shakes the tingles off, but Tilara feels herself begin to shrink. Looking down at her hands, she squeals.

Once so pale, and devoid of hair, they're now sprouting dark brown hairs, the fingers fusing together into cloven hoofs, the ground suddenly looming closer as she finds herself dropping to all fours, her clothes fading and melting into her body as Andreth stands looking on, aghast.

Andreth blinks once, and then again, shuddering. "Ye gods... is this just one of the Lady's little jokes? I hope so... I'd hate to think that the other piglets're once human..."

Tilara thinks _very_ dark thoughts. _Oh, yes. We killed her **much** too fast._ She tries to respond to Andreth, but manages mainly an outraged oink.

Zinzer is out in the throne room, oblivious, with the mother pig. He pulls a small hip flask out of his pack and takes a swig. Then offers it to the giant sow.

Andreth stares at the bookcases. "Dammit. I bet that's not the only spell on these, neither. Starguard!" he yells. "We got a problem..."

Starguard says, "What? Bring them over to the door! I'm not trapping us in here!"

Andreth hrms and nods, gesturing toward the door, on the assumption that Tilara's mind is still in there and capable of understanding. He glances briefly and curiously at the smoldering hole in the floor, but shakes his head. We've only just begun to uncover the dangerous secrets of Achmadina's study, to say nothing of venturing into unknown territory...

Tilara trots over to the soot left by the fire runes and lowers her snout to the floor. She manages a rather shaky 'DiSpeL ?' and then nudges Ash to look at it.

Ash grunts, as the party reconvenes in the throne room... one of its members looking charred and shaken, and another suffering from a most unhelpful change in shape. He sighs. "I think we should go back for now and come up with some better plans. And Zinzer, Starguard, Stormy, y'all put your heads together and see what it'll take to get Tilara back to normal. Maybe dispelling will be all it takes, but if not..." He nods to the newest member of the growing throng of porcine companions. "Don't worry, Tilara, we'll find something."

Tilara flops down on the floor, grunting in annoyance. She tries saying hello to the mama pig, to see if at least _that_ will work.

The mama sow looks at Tilara in surprise, and then shuffles closer. _Greetings. I don't recognize you._ The oinking and snorting, while incomprehensible to the rest of the party, is perfectly clear to Tilara.

Tilara snorts a chagrined answer back to mama. _I had two legs a little while ago. The female human?_

Nodding, and snorting her agreement, the mama sow smiles complacently. _I remember having two legs. Four legs is better._
