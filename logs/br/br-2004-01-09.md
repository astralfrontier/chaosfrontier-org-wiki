# Birthright 2004-01-09

Starguard blinks, confused as Andreth leads in another pig, quite a bit smaller than big momma. "What's wrong, Andreth? Did you find a new pig?" He kneels without waiting for an answer. "Hello there. I don't believe we've met."

Andreth smiles grimly to Starguard. "Ye believe wrong, I'm afraid, Starguard. This's Tilara. The Lady's study had a little surprise for us."

The new pig snorts. Mirra pads in behind it - her - and mrrowls in annoyance.

Starguard blinks, freezing, his hand in front of Tilara's nose. "Beg pardon? I think my hearing is going in my old age. I thought you just said that Tilara was this pig here. Silly huh?"

Zinzer says to Starguard, "It was a trap. A vile trap. A MAGICAL vile trap."

Tilara shakes her head.

"How is it to be undone, then?" asks Ash, doubtfully. Throughout the trip into the Lady's lair, he's been wary and reluctant to meddle in matters clearly beyond his own understanding, and this is merely confirmation of that conservative attitude.

Starguard blinks again, looking into the porcine eyes for sighs of recognition. "Til? That you?"

Tilara nods. Her coloration is the same, now that she's close up. The red-gold hair is now bristles, but it's recognizably the same shade.

Zinzer says, "Don't worry, young lady. I'm sure we'll be able to find a way to undo this."

Zinzer pulls a notebook out of his pack and begins flipping through it.

Tilara nods, and taps a hoof to get attention. Once she has that, she starts tracing words on the ground with her nose.

Zinzer says, "My notes are incomplete on the subject. We might find an answer in Achmadina's library."

Zinzer looks with interest at Tilara's tracing, and copies them down into his notebook.

Tilara nods emphatically. She continues tracing. Sp eLllB(smudge)oK

Starguard says, "Spellbook?"

Tilara nods. POljMorF

Zinzer says, "'Polymorph'. I've only heard that word a few times."

Ash nods. "Well, exercise caution, please. May I volunteer myself, if anything further needs to be read or touched? I cannot undo enchantments on a spell-caster who's been transformed, but one of you can probably aid me if something else happens, yes?"

Zinzer turns to Ash. "I'll back you up. But it might be better to wait until tomorrow, so I can prepare some countermagics."

Zinzer motions to Stormy. "I don't suppose you know how to do spellbreaking, do you?"

Stormy shakes his head, still eyeing the sow ... still eyeing Tilara cautiously from his position next to Starguard.

Tilara nods. She's got enough of her message through for now, and wanders back over to Mama. She and the larger pig begin a rather extensive grunted conversation, punctuated by occasional hisses and curious mrrowls from Mirra.

Starguard shrugs helplessly. "I...I don't have a clue what to do either, to be honest. She's perfectly healthy, just not human."

Ash nods slowly. "Well, then. Let's look around. Point me at what I should examine, and I'll try hard to stay safe."

Zinzer says, "Ask your young Changer friends. Don't they do this thing all the time?"

Tilara snorts and gives Zinzer a rather piggy glare.

Zinzer misses the stare, and follows Ash back to the library. "I've only got a few minutes left on my detection spell."

Tilara ponders things for a moment, then snorts an admonition to Mirra to stay with Starguard and follows them back. _I'm already transformed. Probably can't hurt me any worse than this._

Zinzer says, "Those bookshelves are still magicked. Stay clear or we'll all be oinking."

Zinzer has a look down the hole in the floor. He mutters a few words and light shines from the end of his staff; he lowers the end of the staff through the apeture.

Tilara snorts in amusement at Zinzer's comment, and goes over to the bookcase herself. She snuffles along the lower shelves, apparently searching for some particular odor, but gives up after a bit and starts pulling books gently off the shelf one by one and carrying them back to the mage.

The hole is only a few feet deep, and contains ... well, it contains a few small chests. Not a single rune, though, and the chests aren' arranged in any kind of suggestive order. It looks almost ... harmless.

Zinzer absently mutters, "Seems like cheating, to me... she claimed to breed swine up to par with men... doesn't make sense for her to turn men into swine. What if all her little piggies were once human?"

Zinzer stands. "That hole has the look to me of the pit of doom." He looks at the small pile of spellbooks.

Zinzer sighs. "Everyone... stand back. I'm going to try opening one of these."

Zinzer says, "I don't believe that it's trapped, but... you never know."

Ash frowns. "Better let me, then. You're of more importance now than I, until this is resolved."

Zinzer says, "Do you know what horrors might await you if you open that volume?"

Zinzer, sensing Ash's disregard for his own safety, backs out the door, and flattens his back against the wall, as if preparing for another blast.

Tilara pokes Andreth out the door with her snout and turns back to Ash, nodding, since he seems to want to try this.

With everyone else prudently putting distance between themselves and Ash, the swordsman kneels, reaching gingerly with a gauntleted hand for the clasp on one book. _This armor is itself enchanted,_ he reflects. _Perhaps it will protect me... perhaps it will only make things worse..._

Zinzer does something unusual. He prays... after a fashion. "I know you're out there. I know you're listening. And I know you've been avoiding me all my life. But please, just this once, let the sick jokes happen to some other poor deserving sap."

The clasp opens easily, serving only to keep the book from falling open inopportunely it seems. The embossed leather easily opens, the first page containing only a few words, easily discernible. "Achmadina Merilora", followed by "Book 6 of 8". As he glances briefly at the page, he hears a sudden loud clap of thunder, and a small snake seems to dart upwards for his face.

The snake disappears moments after sinking its fangs into Ash's cheek, seemingly vanishing inside his skin. His skin begins to glow as his awareness of the outside world fades away, and his worried friends see him disappear inside a glowing, shimmering orb of amber light.

Tilara squeals in alarm, then grunts in annoyance. She steps gingerly forward - she's still not used to her head being this far in front of where her feet are - and pokes her snout at the ball of light which seems to hold Ash frozen inside. Nothing happens, though - she can't penetrate the glow. With another grunt, she peers at the book. _6 of 8. We're on the right track, at least._ She tries turning to the next page with her snout.

Inside the amber barrier, Ash is motionless, caught between the sands of time's hourglass, by the look of him. His face is somewhat visible, caught in a contrasting swirl of frozen emotion. On the one hand is an expression of shocked surprise. On the other, there are definite traces of a strongly-felt resignation, a deep and abiding oneness with the world, a captured emotion that says nothing so much as "It had to happen, didn't it".

Zinzer inches his head around the doorframe, and sees what Tilara sees. "Oh, no..."

Andreth looks round the door, and sighs, his brows knitting. "Okay, what in Merial's name is _that_? And how d'we get 'im out o' it?"

Zinzer is silent for a few seconds, then says to Andreth, "You're a hell of an optimist."

Andreth looks further, and says, "And how come Tilara's still messin' with the damn book?" He strides forward. "Get away from that thing! Ye don' know what it's gonna do next!"

At first the pages seem to slip under Tilara's snout, but after a few tries the page begins to turn ...

Tilara grunts and puts her foot on the page when she succeeds in turning it. She grunts angrily at Andreth, nodding to him before looking at the next page.

Zinzer says quietly, but with as much authority as he can muster, "Back off, you two. Right now."

Zinzer says, "We're leaving this hole and coming back tomorrow when I'm prepared. I can deal with this... but not now. And we're only making things worse."

Even as Zinzer speaks up, Tilara's eyes travel down the page, which appears to be a simple table of contents. As she reads past Polymorph Other and Animal Growth, she hears a very loud bang, and a small snake flings itself at her snout.

Tilara jerks back as she feels the spell taking shape, and this snake sails past her snout before fading into a puff of nasty smoke. She shakes her head, and snout-writes a couple words. THiS 1. SPlL WARe OfF

Andreth nods. "Well, that's good to know. Now come _on_," he says, picking up Tilara and carrying her to the door. "We're gonna come back ta this later."

Tilara squeals and wriggles, not liking this idea at all.

Zinzer strides into the room to help Andreth drag Tilara out. "Right _now,_ you silly sow. There are far worse things than being turned into a pig!"

Starguard calls out from the doorway, hearing squealing, and signs of struggle. "What's the Stars is going on in there?!?"

Tilara thrashes around until Andreth drops her, and goes back to the book. She snorts, standing her ground over it, while pushing the book closed again.

Zinzer shouts back, "Tilara's being mutinous! We'll just be a moment!"

Zinzer mutters a few words to himself, and flexes his arms.

Andreth puts a hand over his face. "What's _wrong_ with ye, Tilara? Has Achmadina's spell stolen yer wits as well as yer shape? We ain't set up ta deal with this place right now." He circles around behind Tilara. "Now c'mon, or we're gonna have ta drag ya."

Zinzer lays a hand briefly on Andreth's shoulder, and repeats his spell. "You get her forequarters and I'll get her back."

Tilara nods, but taps the now-closed book with her snout. She seems to want to take it along.

Starguard appears in the doorway of the spellroom, taking in the scene in front of him. Ash is stock still, glowing amber, and Andreth and Zinzer fighting with Tilara the pig. He inhales, then uses his best army voice. "STOP! What the hell is going **on** in here? You, Andreth. What's going on?"

There's a soft, soft whisper, of stone sliding across stone.

Were there any justice in creation, the karmic repayment of Ash's demonstrable wisdom in staying silent and remaining well out of the fracas would be recorded in some divine ledger. As it stands, the act isn't precisely voluntary.

Zinzer's eyes widen.

Tilara takes advantage of the momentary distraction to pick up the book.

Andreth clasps his hands to his head, and looks at Starguard. "Well, y'see what happened ta Ash here? Well, this book in Tilara's mouth did that ta him, and almost tried ta do it ta her. And she _won't let go of it!_" he says, his voice rising to a yell.

Zinzer grasps Andreth by the shoulder. "The door! RUN!"

Starguard's voice has the steel of a drill sergeant in it. "STOP. RIGHT. THERE." He examines Ash's condition from afar, trying to determine what happened to him.

Tilara trots over to her now-smudged message, which by now looks like TH S l. SP l WORe Of

Ash sets an admirable example of silent contemplation and patient decision-making.

Zinzer says, "We'll explain in a moment, but THE DAMN DOOR IS CLOSING, old man!"

Tilara grunts and oinks at Starguard in a long and convoluted manner, apparently trying to tell him something.

Andreth shakes his head. "Fine. Let's hope she can. In the meantime, Tilara, just drop the damn book. We're gonna prepare tonight and come back t'morrow. In the meantime, do ye really think that's the only spell on the book? An' d'ye really wanna bet yer life, or worse, on it bein' so?"

Zinzer glowers, but says nothing.

Starguard seems unconcerned. "Mama can open the door for us. I was holding it for convienience sake. Furthermore, the book is already in her mouth. It's not going to bite us if we wrap it up and take it with us. And then we don't have to deal with any traps that reset. And on another note, can anyone move Ash?"

Andreth snorts. "It bit Ash. I still say messin' with it afore we're ready is gamblin'. And not on good odds, neither."

Tilara nods emphatically to Starguard.

Zinzer says, "Judging by what has already happened here, I don't want to touch him. Or the thing around him. Or anything else in this room. We need to get out of here, and prepare a proper study."

Starguard nods. "Aye. I'd rather have the books there with us." He removes his cape, setting it on the ground. "Tilara? Would you mind fetching other useful books, other than the one in your mouth? They'll be useful. I'm sick of jumping in that witch's home soil."

Andreth holds up a hand. "First, gimme a reason why ye canna do this tommorra."

Starguard says, "Because traps can reset. Or the fact that we've triggered traps could make more of them, or harder to get in."

Tilara nods and continues fetching books, after handing the one she's got to Starguard specifically.

Starguard puts it in his pack, with the other magical books he carries.

Andreth sighs, and shakes his head, turning to Zinzer. "Well, if anythin' goes wrong, I hope ye and I c'n deal wi' it. C'mon, let's leave these people to mess with stuff what they don't know what it does," he says, heading for the door of the study.

Zinzer follows Andreth down the hall, fairly bouncing off his feet. "And you people do this all the time? You're mad. You're all mad."

Andreth sighs at Zinzer, as they make their way back into the throne room. "Normally they got more sense 'n that. Leastways Starguard does. I dunno what's got inta them. Mebbe Tilara's just impatient ta not be a pig no more."

Dancing from foot to foot, Stormy looks torn between racing forward and staying by the giant mama pig. Around his feet, the piglets have curled up, mostly undisturbed by his twitching.

Andreth nods to Stormy. "Hey there. Starguard 'n Tilara'll be out in a minute, but if I was ye I wouldna touch whatever they'll be carryin' wi' em, less'n ye can make sure it's safe somehow. Ash's stuck back there, but Tilara thinks 'e'll be okay." He looks around. "How're the piggies doin?" he asks, somewhat more calmly.

Stormy, eyes as widely opened as they can go, listens to Andreth's calm recitation and heroically fails to respond. Then he looks down. "They were a little hysterical after Zinzer went and screamed at them, but Mama and I calmed them down again."

Tilara follows along, happy now that they've located the spell book that she thinks is the right one.

Zinzer rubs his plam over his forehead as he looks at the door, then sits down near the wall, somewhat apart from the party, and unrolls his bedroll.

Starguard comes into the room, holding the books and stuff at arms length. _Ma'am? Would you mind opening the door for us? We'd like to head home._

The mama pig looks up from her piglets, and moves closer to Starguard, nudging and suggesting truffled bribes ...

Starguard smiles. _I'm out, but we can get more when we get back with the kobolds._ Mama sees the wisdom of the argument, tapping at a certain spot on the floor...and voila, the door opens, mama eager to lead the party to the mushroom caves.

Zinzer shrugs, pulls up his bedroll, and marches out. "What do you propose to do with Achmadina's remains."

Starguard eyes the corpse. "I'm not sure. I'm afraid to touch it, really. Who knows what she might of had on her."

Tilara stares at the tapestries as Zinzer unrolls his sleeping furs and then packs them up again. She ends up backing out of the room, last of the group to leave, not taking her eyes off them until the wall slides shut again.

Zinzer says, "Then we'd better take her back with us."

Andreth hmms. "Some respect is due. Mebbe the pig'll have some ideas. We c'n ask her in the mornin'," he says, nodding to Starguard. He then glances at Tilara. "What is it, Tilara? Didja see somethin' interestin'?"

Tilara nods, but seems at a loss on how to convey it.

Andreth hms at Tilara. "Is it important?"

Andreth goes on, "I mean, is it important enough it canna wait till ye can tell Starguard tomorra?"

Tilara nods, then shakes her head, then nods again.

Andreth sighs, and shrugs. "C'mon, then," he says, turning to rejoin the rest of the group.

Tilara trots along with Mamapig, taking the other flank guard position and trying to keep the piglets between them.

The night is spent in mystic contemplation, and tempers cool under the influence of time. While Starguard prays earnestly and seeks for guidance, and Zinzer raptly contemplates, Andreth discovers that his prior experience with pigs does not apply to Tilara, and that diplomacy by fungus will not, after all, ease over every disagreement. Ash is content to stay just where he is, one assumes, because he doesn't move a bit.

Not that Tilara won't _eat_ the mushrooms, of course - she seems to be quite willing to eat like the pig she now is. She just doesn't forgive Andreth for picking her up before.

Andreth rubs his forehead. It doesn't take the insight of the gods to read the unpleasant glares Tilara is giving him. "I was just tryin' ta help, Tilara. Achmadina's stuff is _dangerous_, as ye of all people should know."

Tilara snorts. Pig or not, she's still the difficult and sometimes arrogant sorceress inside.

Starguard starts the morning off in a moderately foul mood, last nights events not exactly pleasing to him. However, perhaps today things can be set a bit right. The first thing on his list is to gather momma and Tilara and have a chat.

Zinzer isolates himself in the same room where he was scrying before, save for asking Andreth to stand nearby and keep an eye on him. He takes the pile of spell books and scrolls in Starguard's cloak and pushes them into a row on the floor using his staff.

In the corridor ourside the mushroom cave, the pigs sit down, gravely watching Starguard. As his lips move in the now familiar incantation, the pigs watch him carefully, curious as to what he has to say.

Zinzer mutters softly, and casts his detection spell. The nine books all glow faintly, as do the quartos, with a variety of magics; it's impossible to distinguish the types of spells. The scrollcase doesn't glow, so he opens that, the opening pointing away from his face and towards a wall, carefully emptying the contents onto the floor.

Tilara, unlike the others, can understand the humans, and she waits only for the spell to end before starting in as quickly as she can.

As the scrolls slowly slide out of the scroll case, a little pebble falls with them. When it hits the ground, it breaks, and a noxious mist rises, quickly vanishing but not before Zinzer breathes a few wisps of it. His throat burns, and he can taste blood, as he feels his lungs under direct attack by whatever noxious gas this is.

Tilara inhales as Starguard finishes his spell and dives right in. "First, the book I handed you has the polymorph spell listed on the contents page. I think the nine similar books are probably all spell books. Dunno about the quartos or the case. She's got sepia snake sigil traps on them - there were two already on volume 6. Ash caught one, but it's just a time-stop spell. He'll be fine in a few days or whenever Zinzer gets around to dispelling it. Second: Mama here used to be a two-leg. Says she likes herself fine as is, though." She pauses to inhale, and continues. "Third: We DO NOT sleep in Achmadina's rooms. The tapestries are programmed to attack anyone in a sleeping fur. I saw them start to edge toward Zinzer before we left yesterday."

Andreth watches Zinzer with concern from the doorway. "Are you all right?" he calls, carefully backing away and holding his breath.

Zinzer stumbles out of the room, coughing and hacking. "Damned... poison... gas..."

Andreth helps Zinzer out of the room, supporting him. "Do we need to go get Starguard?" he asks.

Starguard takes all this in, and just suppresses the urge to run to tell everyone else. "Wait, momma was a two-legs? Why's she so much bigger than you then?"

Tilara says, "She was altered after being changed, apparently."

Starguard says, "Can you tell me anything else? We've only got a couple of minutes left..."

Zinzer says, "No. But we should get that wench buried. Before I'm tempted to do a sacreligious mutilation of her carcass."

Tilara says, "That's the critical bits. Mama, can you tell us what Achmadina did to make you bigger?"

The sow looks confused, head tilted to one side. "She cast a spell, with the aid of a big burning man, and I started grow. It took many mushrooms, but now I am nice and large."

Starguard says, "I'd suspect Enlarge and Permanence, to hazard a guess. Big burning man?"

Tilara looks curious. "News to me. Some kind of giant, you think?"

"He was a man who lived in fire, lived in flames, lived in brazier. Big man. Very ... The Lady always very polite around him." The sow looks uncertain, not entirely sure of her answers.

Starguard says, "Ah. Communication spell, it sounds like."

Zinzer turns back to the room, this time staying near the door, and mutters some more. Though several yards away, he moves his hand as if he's picking up items from the floor, turning them and watching them from a distance.

Tilara says, "Lived in fire. Might be some kind of elemental, then."

Starguard says, "Is there anything else you'd like to tell me, momma?"

The sow looks confused. "I'd like more ... **oink? Oink! Oink!**"

Starguard sighs. _Mushrooms?_ he asks in Firstborn, quickly arranging lodging for the pigs, then returning to tell the other members of the party what he learned.

Zinzer sighs. "This is... irritating. Those scrolls could be anything. Some of them could be trapped."

Andreth nods to Starguard as he returns. "Zinzer got a lungful of some nasty gas, but 'e seems okay, just kinda hoarse. 'e might be able ta use a little healin', but nothin' serious."

Tilara follows along behind Starguard.

Starguard relates what Tilara has told him, and the mysterious burning man he discovered in conversation.

Zinzer says, "Warn the kobolds, Andreth. I'm going to try an experiment. This might get... loud."

Zinzer levitates the pile of scrolls into one corner, and the spell books out of the room.

Andreth shakes his head, staying well away from the books as they float by. "I just hope ye know what ye're doin', Zinzer."

Starguard says, "I could cast a spell to see if this is a good idea or not, if you'd like. I only have one, though."

Zinzer says, "I'll be honest with you, young man. I don't. But none of you is going to have a better idea."

Slowly and carefully, Zinzer sorts out the scrolls, using his mage hand to move them around through the air. The first is a rejection letter. The second is a rejection letter. The third appears to be some kind of report, while the fourth - the longest yet - appears to be some kind of impassioned argument. The fifth contains a family tree, the sixth contains a number of notes, and the seventh contains - near the top - a word that suddenly transforms into a little snake. Even as he realizes what he's up against, Zinzer hears the loud boom, and a snake flings itself through the air at him.

Zinzer ducks, and the snake sails harmlessly past his head and disappears. He stands up again and continues his study, muttering softly.

Starguard says, "I think, Zinzer, that a significant portion of the books are trapped. Would that we knew someone who dealt with this sort of thing."

Andreth, still at a safe distance, shakes his head. "Y'know, Brother Oak didna raise no quitter, but seems ta me like milady's got too many damn' ways o' keepin' her stuff save. At this rate, we're gonna be here fer _weeks_, if'n we want ta be alive 'n whole at the end o' it."

Zinzer says simply, "Patience."

Tilara grunts, and flops down on her belly. She doesn't seem to be in a hurry.

As he continues scanning the scroll, Zinzer concludes it can best be described as a receipt for some kind of bottle.

Zinzer gathers the scrolls to himself, and moves the spell books and scroll case back into the makeshift sack of Starguard's cloak.

Zinzer says, "We'll leave those for later. For now, let's read these. There may be some hints. After that... let's go get Ash out of his amber prison. And then we'll return here and have a look at those spell books."

Now rereading the scrolls more carefully, Zinzer realizes that many of these are related to the same basic issue, that of trying to raise better pigs. The report seems to be related to a request both for recognition and for funding. Or perhaps for access to a better breed of breeding pig. The writing gets a little convoluted here. The receipt is confusing, though; it's the one scrap of paper that seems utterly unrelated.

Turning back to the fourth scroll, the letter, Zinzer is disturbed to notice that the writing begins to sound a little paranoiac about halfway through.

Zinzer says, "She was communicating with someone. Hard to tell who. The... 'Journal of Breeding Practices'."

Zinzer says, "This receipt doesn't fit. I don't know if it was something she bought or sold or how it was delivered. Only that it's a bottle."

Zinzer says, "Let's go get Ash. And then let's try to figure out what to do with those spell books."

Starguard says, "Don't open it until I check out if it's a good idea."

Zinzer says, "The bottle's not here, Starguard. But there is some odd writing inside the scroll case."

Starguard hmms?

Zinzer says, "Don't read it. We've got more immediate concerns. And now would be a good time to heal me, if you can spare it."

Moving back to the Lady Achmadina's quarters, the door is quickly and easily opened with the help of the mama pig, who follows everyone inside. Ash still stands, as frozen as he ever was, in the centre of the work room.

Zinzer mutters a few words, standing in front of Ash, and waves his hands in a mystic pattern. At the end of the pattern, the amber globe dissolves like sugar crystal in rain.

"... Trap!" yells Ash.

Zinzer says, "Yes. Yes, it was."

Ash looks around, blinking. "Teleportation trap? That was harmless," he observes. "So that worked out pretty well... are we ready for the next book?"

Zinzer says, "I think we'll hold off on those for the moment, Ash. You have some... memory loss... from that trap."

Andreth shakes his head. "Not quite that, m'friend. It froze ye for a while. It's been nearly a day since ye set it off." He breathes a sigh of relief. "But at least ye're okay."

Zinzer says, "Starguard, maybe you should check him over, to make sure there's no aftereffects."

Ash looks confused. "What? No, but things in here got rearranged a bit. I got worried for a second that someone might ...you're serious?"

Zinzer frowns at Ash. "I'm an egotistical maniac. But I'm _always_ serious."

Starguard says, "He's fine. Just missing the last day or so."

Ash wisely says nothing, preferring to silently sort through his dissonance. "So.... where do we stand?" he asks.

Zinzer says, "We've brought several of her journals back to the Kobold town. We've read several pieces of correspondance between her and... I guess, an agricultural society of some kind. I don't understand it either. And that's it."

Zinzer says, "Now, if we can step back, I'm going to have another look at this room, and see if there's anything we missed."

Starguard says, "And mama pig used to be human too. And was transformed like Tilara was, probably, then later enlarged somehow, with the help of a man who seemed to be on fire."

Starguard says, "And don't use sleeping furs in this room, or the tapestries will get you."

Tilara snuffles around the room, searching for Achmadina's scent to see if it's more strongly present anywhere.

Sniffing around the room, Tilara detects the scents most strongly around the bookcase, the work table, and the remains of the magic circle - remains that now form a small pit in the middle of the room. As she passes the bookcase, she smells the scent of many, varied spell components.

Zinzer says, "The other items on the bookshelves seem to be spell materials of one form or another... valuable, but realtively information-free. Some of them might have mundane traps, but only if the lady was being excessively paranoid."

Starguard huhs. "All signs point to her being fairly paranoid as it is..."

Zinzer says, "If we want a clue on reversing her spell, we're going to have to read her journals. And if she followed a pattern, those will have some of those snake-rune spells on theme at one or more points. She probably wouldn't put an explosive trap in those because it would damage the book. Those books would be the most valuable thing for her. As we've seen from Ash, that trap is frightening, but harmless under the proper circumstances. I will pen some scrolls that your young mage Firestorm can read, which will un-do that spell, and read them myself. I'm best equipped to take that risk."

Andreth nods. "I guess that spell's there ta make sure she caught anyone readin' 'er stuff. Since she's not around no more to catch us..." he chuckles wryly.

Zinzer says, "Since she was quite paranoid, I suggest we withdraw and leave the basement alone for now, and read her journals. If we need ingredients for a spell to reverse Tilara's change, we can return. If this place gave us this much trouble I have no fear of a casual interloper being able to steal anything while we're absent."
