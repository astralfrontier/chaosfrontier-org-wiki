# Birthright 2004-01-23

The word "lair" seems to have been universally adopted by the White Company, in describing the former residence, laboratory, library and study of the Lady, even after she departed to a bourne from which there is no easy return. Even now, the group lurks warily outside the entrance. Whatever else the Lady may have been, care-free and easy-going in regards to her security would not describe her, and so caution shows on the faces of each member as they plot their next course. Their young charges are here with them, having been succinctly appraised of all that has gone before. Now they discuss the next steps on the ill-lit road ahead.

Tilara says, "We need to find her notes on the pigs, and anything about where she's sent the others."

Zinzer says, "There's that room under the study, full of chests. There might be other rooms down there."

Ash nods slowly. "Given our record of success so far, caution is indicated. But I would say the risk is worth the reward."

Zinzer says, "There might be clues to the location of the tomb you're looking for."

Tilara says, "And from what we've seen so far, we might want to let our porcine friends pull things out for us."

Zinzer says, "So... should we go get the momma pig?"

"The fire portals 're what I'm worried about," says Andreth. "If'n she was in league with the people what kidnapped Stormy... I wanna know about it. We got unfinished business wit' dem."

"Employing the pigs' aid seems only prudent," observes Ash. "The Lady trusted them more than us, obviously," he adds with a rueful grin.

Tilara says, "Hardly a surprise."

Ellinor and Jellin nod. From what they've heard, they're curious to see this lair. A little worried, but curious.

Zinzer says, "Starguard, would you go and ask her to accompany us here? We can go in and get started while we wait for you."

After a quick trek to fetch the sow, Starguard returns with the mother and two of the piglets in tow. The third, apparently, is sleeping off a case of 'green mushrooms', much like young lads suffer from the 'green apples' disease.

Zinzer cautiously steps into the lair. "We've tripped a lot of traps. As long as we don't touch anything on that shelf, we should be able to move around freely."

Looking around, Zinzer takes a quick inventory. Nothing seems to have moved in the Company's absence.

Tilara says, "Let's hope. Don't you touch anything until someone else has tried it, though - I'm not sure I could manage to un-pig you."

Zinzer says, "Oh, I'm quite sure. Quite sure you couldn't. I almost couldn't. No disrespect intended."

Zinzer pokes his staff idly through the hole in the floor, half-expecting a fireball to fly up in his face.

Zinzer says, "Something about fire mages... they're so... flashy."

Ash waits patiently, willing to take directions from the more arcanely-blessed members of the group as to what he should do next. For a man who's always been curious about new things, he's remarkably restrained. After two traps and other indignities, though, perhaps it's not so much restraint as conditioning.

Zinzer shuffles his feet uneasily on the edge of the hole. "There must've been a trap door or something there... umm..."

Following Ash's lead, Stormy and the girls crowd around the entry way. The girls' eyes are round, as they take in the tapestries. Ellinor begins to hum a little tune, and Jellin giggles.

Zinzer says, "I don't want to sound like a coward, but could someone take a look down there? Someone... not me?"

Zinzer says, "Those chests are magicked. Can't tell what's on them, though. Probably not those fire runes."

Andreth glances at the girls curiously as he passes through the hall. "Hmm?" he asks, a bit of a smile quirking his scarred face. "Some song 'bout what's on these tapestries?"

Ash approaches Zinzer and the hole. Carefully he checks the greaves and gauntlets protecting his arms, then pokes at each chest in turn with his sheathed sword, attempting to prod them into motion from a safe distance.

Ellinor nods, shyly. "Yes. Each of these represents a story ... a song, if you will. And in every one of them, a woman defeats a man using brains alone."

Zinzer listens to the song, and pulls a notebook out of his journal, flipping through it absently.

Starguard looks carefully around the room. "Did you want to ask the pigs to pull them out?"

Andreth scratches his head for a moment, then breaks into a grin. "That sounds like the Lady, right enough. Certainly thought a lot o' herself, didn't she?"

Zinzer says, "Yes, she did. And she was quite deserving of her self-image. She's nearly killed us twice over. And that was after she was already dead."

Zinzer sees Ash showing a remarkable lack of incineration, and drops down into the crawlspace to help him.

The chests, though small, are heavy to move. Tilting one, Zinzer can hear the coins clinking, promising riches that will fund many an expedition, should he ever be willing to venture out again. Ash strains; these chests are far from light, but they do shift along the ground. The heaviest of the four, the one Ash shifts the largest, appears to be the key. As he moves it a few inches, a small gully is revealed in the floor and smoke begins to eddy up from underneath the chest.

Ash scrambles out of the hole as quickly as his body and burdens permit, leaving behind the chest for the moment. One's life is not a commodity that can be bought and sold easily; wealth can always be found elsewhere.

Zinzer stands in shock for the barest moment, then jumps out of the crawlspace, dragging himself back pell-mell.

As the young warrior scrambles, the smoke thickens, gleaming redly. The smoke glows with menace, it boils with heat, it hisses into the crawlspace, and begins to form into a solid form.

The clanking of Ash's armor is loud and violent as he continues scrambling across the floor, getting a few feet of distance before rising onto one knee. His hands are already going for the heavy sword he carries.

Zinzer scrambles back and bumps into the wall. He rises to his feet, and makes a rushed set of gestures and mystic mutterings.

Tilara swears at this apparition, wondering if it's even real, but she readies a spell just in case.

The spell arcs off Zinzer's fingers, weaving through the gathering smoke, and making not a single dent. Rather, the form solidifies into a very angry looking man, made of molten brass, glowing in the confines of that tiny lab, raising the temperature with his ire. His hands go up, balled into fists, and he intones, in a deep voice, "You Dare!" Flames form around his fists, and he turns to face Zinzer directly.

Ash's voice is heavy with relief. "Finally, a trap we can kill honestly," he mutters to himself, before bellowing: "Stormy! Shield!"

Tilara snarls, "Aye, we dare. Begone, and live. The one who trapped you there is dead, and we have no interest in you." She'll pause long enough to see what the creature does, ready to throw the spell if need be.

Ash feints, his greatsword swimming forward through the air this way and that, handled by his well-honed muscles and striking true. The blade carves a grievious gash into the towering figure, coming away glittering with liquid brass, while the wound itself closes up just a bit. Less giving than human flesh, notes Ash dispassionately, as he back-steps quickly.

Tilara sends a trio of energy bolts at the creature, since it already seems to be past the point of no return. _Besides, it can always leave. Maybe this will encourage it to do so._

Ignoring the irritations of the people batting around him, the towering creature, the moving statue, steps forward. His hands blaze, as he punches Zinzer. Once in the stomache, once against the jaw. The snap of broken bones can be heard clearly, audibly, before the mage collapses to the ground, burns blistering his skin, flames beginning to eat at his clothes. The spell he had so dearly desired to cast utterly failed to protect him.

Starguard gasps as the creature smashes Zinzer, and runs forward to pull him out of danger. He concentrates on the Twins as he does so, healing Zinzer by touch even as he tries to pull him back out of immediate danger.

Starguard grunts in pain as the brass creature strikes him and breaks his concentration before he can heal the mage. Tilara fires another trio of magical bolts over his head as he pulls Zinzer back toward the doorway.

Ash swings again, striking another blow for the White Company against the brass barrier that rises imposingly above them all. He's already darting away from it as his sword sparks madly, and moving back toward the door, where his companions are gathered. A brief memory asserts itself, and he instantly abandons his earlier thinking. Nevertheless, he stands ready to defend his friends.

Behind him, Ash can hear young Stormy casting. A defensive spell, the incantation produces a glimmering shield, that Stormy turns to help shield the badly singed Zinzer and the somewhat singed Starguard.

The creature, stepping out of the charred crawl space, walks slowly and steadily towards the door, towering over everyone and giving off waves of heat.

Ash gestures wildly behind him, dodging and swinging his blade to fend off the fiery fists. "On Starguard! Shield potions!" he yells.

Andreth nods shortly to Ash, reaching into Starguard's backpack while the cleric occupies himself with reviving the fallen Zinzer. One potion he chugs down hurriedly - the other he holds on to, prepared to give it to whoever needs it the most.

Starguard casts a healing spell now that he is behind the front ranks. The pale glow closes the worst of the mage's wounds.

Zinzer groans, but discovers he's no longer at death's door... for the moment.

Tilara sends a third trio of energy bolts toward the creature, then steps back to clear the doorway. Whatever the huge thing is planning, it's not going to fit easily through the narrow corridors.

Ash snatches the remaining flask from Andreth's outstretched hand and downs the sorcerous draught, feeling its energies course through him as the magic takes hold. He tosses the flask aside, readying his weapon again in a defensive posture and gritting his teeth.

Keeping his body between the enemy and Zinzer, the shield now guarding his back, Stormy begins to chant again.

Zinzer's eyes snap open, suddenly wide awake, boosted by the magic. "Time... to leave."

Enraged by the magic, the creature leans forward, punching right through Stormy's shield. But the young man stands, steadfast, helping Zinzer regain his strength. Disgusted the creature whirls to strike out at Ash, who has been gouging his metal hide quite irritatingly.

Fortunately, luck, the gods, the forces of magic, stupid blind chance, or destiny conspire together. Ash escapes harm thanks to the radiant magic shield now protecting him, and the warrior grins widely at this turn of events.

Zinzer clicks his boots together, and the jewels in the heels sparkle. He grabs for Stormy. "Everyone out of the room! Let me get a clear shot!"

Zinzer steps out into the hall, far too quickly, and slips behind the door.

Andreth calls "Back! Back down the hall!" to his companions, and stands his ground to cover their retreat, keeping the molten giant at bay with his fists whistling through the air - not connecting with any solid blows, but at least keeping the creature busy.

Zinzer takes a second look at the glowing brass giant, bigger than it was when it flattened the mage, and rethinks his plan. "What he said! Time to begone!"

Starguard realizes that the corridor is crowded, and instead opts to remain in the fray. He reaches out to Andreth and calls upon the names of the Twin Stars to grant protection from fire in the battle against this most unnatural foe.

Tilara nods to herself as Starguard protects Andreth, and concentrates on her own magic. Once again, the magical bolts leap from her fingers and impact unerringly on the searing-hot giant.

Ash follows, ducking low, making four swings that are hampered indeed by the tight quarters. He grits his teeth, grumbling something under his breath about tunnel-fighting, but shows no hesitation in pressing the attack when he can.

The creature seems to shrink just the smallest amount, the wounds beginning to tell. He takes a step back. A second step. Stepping into the hole ... and then he seems to vanish completely.

Zinzer edges past the others in the hallway, the magical speed of his boots conflicting with the cramped, narrow space, and the people in it. He moves in short bursts, oblivious to the strange scene playing out in the study behind him.

Panting a bit, Ash hefts his sword, advancing warily back into the room. Has the threat been put down, or merely retreated, as would be prudent? How much volition could it show in the defense of its own life, he wonders to himself, peering down into the cavity wherein the four chests were.

"The chests remain. Our friend has fled," calls Ash, still wary. "Are we still interested in them?"

Andreth hesitantly steps up behind Ash, and circles around the hole. "Is he gone f'r good?" he asks, peering skeptically into the gloom beneath the floor.

Tilara says, "Are you sure he won't reappear if you touch 'em again?"

Ash chuckles softly. "Is anyone?" he asks knowingly, nudging the monk behind him. "Anyway, I'll try to move one again. If he re-appears unwounded, we flee. If he re-appears wounded, we'll talk. Otherwise, nobody should object, right?" And so he descends again, to see how protective the brass bouncer is of his charges.

Zinzer stands at the end of the hall, in the 'throne room', panting lightly, saying little. Well... nothing, actually. The bruises from the massive thing's metal fists are still fresh on his midriff. And his face.

Nothing interrupts the swordsman this time, as he begins hauling the chests out, one at a time, setting them up on the surface of the floor. He wipes his brow carefully, smiling. "Amazing," he remarks, after drawing breath. "Amazing things, amazing events..."

Andreth breathes a sigh of relief. "Where'd 'e go, I wonder..." he says, as he helps Ash move the heavy chests. "Mebbe that was the 'man of fire' the pigs was talkin' bout..."

Tilara gingerly enters the room as Ash pulls the chests out. "What exactly did you do just before he appeared?"

"Be sure to tell me if they talk about a 'man of invulnerability', then," grunts Ash. To the sorceress he says nothing for a moment, mentally reviewing his actions before replying. "I nudged at the chests. They didn't give much. I entered the pit and began to move one. Smoke issued forth. So, please warn me if you see any more."

Zinzer stalks cautiously back into the room, and nudges Starguard. "I don't want to be alarmist, but I think I'm two spans from dead."

Starguard smiles, a bit ruefully. "Certainly. I'm getting forgetful, I think." He casts another spell, calling on the Twins once more as the healing light spreads over the mage.

As Zinzer's injuries are quickly and surely closed, the others gather around the chests. Certainly they were protected; but are they still? Will they contain something of interest to the White Company, either loot or lore? Whatever they have opened in the Lady's lair has struck at them in some fashion, and cautiously they consider the puzzle as a whole, and the chests in particular.
