# Birthright 2004-02-20

It's been a long day. It started poorly, and has improved ever since. Now that Starguard is hearing multiple voices in his head, and the venison is stewing nicely, flavoured by rabbit and a handful of leaves and such that Jellin picked to flavour the pot. The stew tastes a little minty, still, given that the cauldron was in use for much of the morning to make potions, but even so, the scents match the flavours, and all together provide a mouthwatering experience.

_Lemme taste! Lemme Taste! Lemme TASTE!_ The little voice in Starguard's mind is incredibly insistent, and yet, somehow, he has no trouble ignoring it.

Zinzer flip through his notebooks. _I can't dispell it... I can't exorcise it... I can hear it, with magic... it's tied to the book somehow. Especially the idea of destroying it... but will that be good for us, or bad for us?_

Starguard sighs, stirring the soup, ignoring the voice for the moment as he focuses on what he's doing. It's not that bad, really. It's like having a four-year old running around your ankles.

"Anyone here familiar with excorcisms?", Zinzer asks, looking at nobody in particular.

Tilara says, "Don't look at me. I do fire spells."

Ash volunteers, "We had a saying, that the exorcised should be strapped down and salted, then left in the elements from sunset to sunrise. That, or burning."

Tilara says, "If you want anything burned, I'll oblige."

Starguard sighs. "He's not doing anything at the moment. Hungry a bit, but that's not a big deal." One haunch of the venison is front of Windrider, who's tearing it apart quite happily.

Stormy shakes his head, and Jellin and Ellinor follow his lead, biting their lips. "Will we ever reach the shrine, Jellin?" Ellinor's whisper is meant to be quiet, but it falls in a pregnant pause during the conversation.

Starguard frowns at Ash. "It's not a ghost, anyway. Actually, given the level of childishness and lack of sanity, I'd guess it used to be a wizard."

Ash shrugs. "Fire will probably still work, then."

Zinzer gives Starguard an incendiary look. "Are you making a comment about my profession, young man?"

Tilara coughs, trying to cover a snicker. She doesn't respond to Jellin's plaintive question, though, letting Starguard field that one if he wants.

Zinzer says, "How far is it to this shrine you speak of, child?"

Starguard says, "Actually, I suppose I am. I've always found the wizards I met in the army to be a little shell-shocked at best. Granted, in your case, I'm sure after having your pants burned off several times, you've probably degraded a bit."

Ellinor bites her lip. Jellin looks at Zinzer. "We're ... not sure. It's ... over the Mountains, and Far Away?"

Zinzer says, "You met wizards in the army?"

Zinzer looks thoughtful for a moment. "Yes... that about describes where we are, then."

Tilara says, "We're in the process of 'over the mountain', at least. If we're not far away yet, we're at least partway there."

Zinzer says, "Does this shrine have any other... distinguishing features? Unique construction, inhabitants... oh, bugrit. Tell me, would you sing me the whole song? Maybe there's something in there I could use."

Zinzer says, "It's more likely that you met sorcerors, Starguard. The way I do things is... different. And it does affect one's mind, yes." He waves a hand toward Tilara and Firestorm. "What comes naturally to them, people like me can only do through careful study and discipline. And sometimes bargaining our sanity. We all make our choices."

Ellinor nods, and begins to sing softly, the words carrying just fast enough. It's a long, and convoluted song, and speaks of many difficulties to be overcome - most of them mentioned only indirectly. And it seems to leave the party adrift. There's not much after the great monster, which quite plausibly could be the giant.

Zinzer takes careful notes in an odd shorthand, trying to find a theme that could be used to locate the shrine.

Jellin follows along, and then nods at Zinzer. "From here, we head North. We need to find the Shrine where Far Seer met Samaela. It's a little hut; there's a labyrinth below."

Ellinor tries to read over Zinzer's shoulder, but fails to make sense of the chicken scratches. "What we know is that our Ancestors are there. Well. Some of them. The ones that didn't follow us to our new home."

Zinzer nods. "That may be enough... shrine, hut, labyrinth, those of Changer blood, but far removed. Tomorrow, I shall try some spells to locate it. Leaving us with the question - what shall we do with today?" He looks at Starguard out of a corner of his eye.

Starguard hmms, tuning out of the conversation to pick one up internally. _"You must be a wizard, I think. You know magic, don't you? Do you know how old you are?"_

_I'm as old as the mountains, as young as the spring rains, and I'm hungry! Lemme taste! Trade you taste for answers ..._

Starguard idly tests the soup, seeing if the voice is honorable at least...

His tongue tingling, Starguard tastes the soup as it slides gently down his throat. _Aaaaaaaaaaah. Niiiiice._ Somehoe, Starguard feels satiated. _Me? I'm ... hmmm. I was about a century old when I was trapped?_

Starguard thinks, _"And when was that? Do you remember what year it was?"_

_Time isn't the same in a book ... Or at least, not in **that** book. I was ..._ The voice rummages around a bit in Starguard's memory. _Don't know how I'd reckon the years, but Glia-Gulmeshki wasn't born yet._

Starguard huhs. "Well, I finally got some information from my merry rider in here. He was about a hundred when he was trapped, and Glia-Gulmeshki wasn't born yet. That mean anything to you, Zinzer?"

Zinzer is silent for a long moment. "You mean apart from him being apallingly old? Yes. It means that, even though he's been stuck in a book for centuries, he can keep up on current events. He knows about the birth of Glia-Gulmeshki. And he also knows Glia Gulmeshki is an important person, important enough for us to have heard of, even if we haven't had personal contact with him. And he knows that we'd have common geography with the Emperor, as opposed to some other foreign potentat."

Zinzer looks at Starguard, and past Starguard. It's obvious that he's speaking to Starguard's 'rider'. "You know... I don't like you."

Starguard says, "Actually, I think he's rummaging through the ol' files up here." He taps his head. "Not the most settling of experiences."

_Tell him I don't like him either._ The voice sniffs. _Nasty little boy, in his silly little shorts._

Tilara shivers. "That is more than a little bit unsettling, you know. Bad enough that some creature trapped in a book is trying to get out, but to have it reading your mind?"

Starguard reports cheerfully. "He doesn't like you either. Calling you young and badly dressed, basically."

Zinzer shrugs. "The fashion sense of a ghost is not to be trusted. We're running out of today. Are you still going to be Starguard when you wake up tomorrow?"

_Of course. And I'll be your Jon Thomas, keeping up all appearances._ The voice snickers. _You go sleep. I'll keep watch in case the Brass Man reappears._

Starguard says, "That's the part that worries me. And with his riffling, I'm not sure you'd be able to tell the difference, if he can act worth a damn." He blinks a little, obviously listening internally. "Look you. I didn't have a dirty mind before you got in there, and there's no need to start now."

_Oh? Yeah? Well ..._ The little voice fires up a sketchbook, drawing Berina. Nude. _Tell me you never thought about this ..._

Starguard blushes red at the silent reply. After a moment, he clears his throat. "I think I'm ready for bed. Would someone kindly tie me down?"

_Ooooooh! I **like** that idea! Do I - sorry, you - get a gag, too?_

Zinzer says, "Not me. But... someone should. Your big feathered friend can probably tell us if it's you or not, tomorrow."

Starguard smiles at Windrider. "Keep watch on me, friend? I'm not completely myself at the moment."

Tilara says, "I think that we ought to leave him untied for tonight.. but he doesn't get a watch on his own. Possessed or not, he'll want to survive if the ifrit comes back."

The hawk pauses, eyeing Starguard thoughtfully. _I watch. I learn._

Andreth scratches head. "Th'important thing, I reckon, is we gotta keep the book away from 'im."

Starguard sighs, lying down on the cold, hard ground. "This is going to be a less than enjoyable night, I can tell. He tries to get fairly close to the fire, the lack of blanket and pillow unfortunate. His cape has been given to the girls."

The night passes quietly, and uneventfully, although Starguard's dreams are a little more autobiographical than he's used to. In fact, he dreams the dream sequence where he meets the Stars three times, in quick succession. Each of those three times, the dream seems to shift a little, as though something is trying to look at the events from different sides.

Starguard isn't in the best mood come the morning. He looks...haggard, grumbling as he sets leftover meat from last night on the fire for breakfast. His prayers, you might note, are rather intense, and somewhat specific on what trials he would like aid against, if the Stars are so willing.

Zinzer watches Starguard carefully. He takes the old man's fatigue as a good sign. _If he were totally possessed, the evil spirit would be trying to maintain a normal appearance._

Tilara wakes up as the sunlight arrives, chillier and less comfortable than she's been since before she joined the traveling players. "You still with us, Starguard?" She shakes her head. "As if we could tell..."

Zinzer says, "It's him."

The day dawns. Cold. There's a definite bite in the air. The kind that warns everyone that winter is dancing on tippytoes, waiting to be let in.

Andreth stretches, groaning a little at the ache in his muscles. "Well, looks like we got through th'night without another visit..."

Starguard nods. "My friend had my past replaying in my head all night. And the ground isn't as comfortable as the bedrolls that bastard effreeti burned. And it's hard to keep the cold off without blankets. I've had better nights. Though I suppose it could be worse."

Zinzer says, "We must find the shrine soon. I don't fancy being out in these mountains without proper cover."

Tilara nods. "We're no longer equipped for winter up here. If we don't find it soon, we'll have to turn back."

Zinzer says, "Unlikely. We've come too far. We'd get snowed in before we could make it out of the mountains."

Zinzer says, "But... consideration for later. That's only one of our problems. We find the Shrine, maybe we can do something about Starguard's... condition, also. And if it's underground it will be out of the snow. So. If the young ladies would aid me in a ritual, I'm going to see if I can localize it."

Starguard hmms, the thought of mounting up and the Shrine click together. "Windrider? Do you know of a Shrine nearby?"

The hawk pauses. _Shrine?_

Starguard nods, trying to describe what the shrine might look like from the song.

After a long pause, the hawk flaps his wings, and takes to the air. _The Mother's Nest?_ An image of a small hut crowds to the forefront of Starguard's mind. _The Nestlings know where this is. I carry you?_

Zinzer is silent. _Or, we can do that. I guess when your only tools are spells, all your problems start looking like... efreeti._

Starguard grins, looking skyward. "Gods help those that help themselves, huh? Well, we have a guide, ladies and gentlement. Pack up, and let's hit the road. Or the air, as the case may be."

Tilara says, "The three of you can take to the air, Starguard. We'll follow along as best we can down here."

After letting Starguard and his Voice climb aboard, Windrider stretches and jumps up, into the air. His wings flap once, twice, propelling the three of them up, before Windrider catches a weak thermal and rides it higher into the sky. The view from the hawk's back is as amazing as it was yesterday, and Starguard remains breathless as he holds the pommel tightly. The lack of breathable air at altitude is completely irrelevant, but the air sure is thin up here ... Windrider, feeling his rider weaken a little, flies lower.

Below, the party follows carefully, picking their way through the hills. It's a long day's walk, but they manage to crest the pass in late afternoon, after which the trail - for lack of a better word - becomes a lot easier.

Windrider circles back, staying above and in front of the party. He chafes only occasionally at their slow pace, but Starguard gets the impression that the Hawk could have reached the shrine long before now, if not for the White Company's much slower pace.

Starguard sighs, lightly suggesting Windrider get his agressions out hunting, passing over the party on the way to yell out their intentions.

Zinzer puffs his way up the hill. "You know... we're going to get there... ... and there's going to be a feather-portal there. Bet you a Sovereign. Could have... teleported from the Citadel."

Putting thought to deed, the hawk stoops, catching up a goat in his talons and swooping back into the air. _Where camp?_

Andreth strides firmly behind him, his rigorous training standing him in good stead. "Only if'n we knew 'ow to aim them. An' we don't."

Starguard hmms, having a nice overhead view, and looks for something moderately defensible, yet not too susceptible to the wall of fire attack that happened last time.

Zinzer shrugs. "I bet I could figure it out. On the very simple basis that I'm arrogant enough to believe nothing in this world is beyond my undestanding."

Andreth nods. "I b'lieve you. Just dunno if we got the time now." He ponders something. "Ye said ye might be able ta find the shrine by magic. C'n you find people that way too?"

Zinzer says, "I can find anything, but it doesn't always work. The better I know the person, the more likely I can find them. It's a long shot to try and find the Shrine this way. Someone we've met personally would be easier."

Zinzer glances sideways at Andreth, in that way he has. "Why, who did you have in mind?"

Andreth nods. "Someone' like our burnin' brass friend? We certainly met _him_. An' I think we'd all sleep a li'l better tonight if we had some idea of where he's hidin' out when he's not beatin' the stuffin' outta us."

Zinzer raises his eyebrows, and for once, says nothing. The look of shock on his face is enough.

Starguard hmmphs as he lands, giving Windrider a bit of a pet and removing the barding so he can preen properly. "I suspect watching us, to be honest. He seems to have taken that Dispel attempt rather personally."

Tilara says, "Well, let's find out for sure, then."

Zinzer says, "Let's try the Shrine first. It's less... pyrotechnic."

Starguard hmms. "How much father, friend," he asks the mighty hawk. "Given the speed we've been going?"

Zinzer prepares for his ritual, rolling a sheet on the ground and drawing runs and symbols on it. In the center he places the ornate basin, filled with water. He places Jellin and Ellinor at opposite poles of the magic circle, and asks them to sing the song of the Shrine. As the location is described, he casts his spell, and tries to draw the separate threads and clues - the hut, the underground labyrinth, the fork in the Changer blood, and the direction 'north' - together, to see the Shrine relative to the camp.

The hawk pauses, considering. _Two days? Three? Not far._

Starguard says, "Thank you." He cuts off the choicest piece of the wild goat for Windrider, then begins preparing the remainder with what herbs he has...

The water stills in the bowl, and slowly pictures begin to form. A meadow, high up, contains an abandoned hut in the very centre, only a single trail leading to it. In front of the hut, two giant mountain lions pace, tails switching to and fro.

Tilara blinks at the image in the water. "Oh, my... now that's very very interesting."

Zinzer continues the ritual, but the question on his face is obvious. _These are known to you?_

Tilara says, "We've been there before, somehow, or maybe she came to us. Remember the first day of the Test, my friends?"

Starguard hmms, perking up. "Windrider says it's two to three more days. What's this about the first day of the Test, Tilara?"

Zinzer finishes the spell, and remains seated. "Thank you, children. That was... most instructive." He looks at Tilara. "Test? What test?"

Tilara says, "The Shrine. It's the same hut as the one we went to the first day of the Test. Where Andreth heard his Song..."

Starguard raises an eyebrow. "Are you sure? It might just be a standard Changer design or something."

"Basically, Zinzer, the two children here are with us because of the tests of the Changers," explains Ash. "We entered those trials, and survived them, and are here travelling in the wake of their completion."

Tilara stretches. "Not the same _type_. The same hut, down to the details of the thatching. Only there were two really _big_ mountain lions lounging around outside it. They looked like guards."

Zinzer says, "So... what was in this hut, before?"

Starguard says, "Well, let's hope they're friendly. Or bribable."

Tilara takes pity on the wizard. "It's a long story. We'll tell it over dinner."

Andreth peers at the bowl, as if trying to see something even after the vision is gone. "So... I don' get it. Windrider's leadin' us totally the other way, so that ain't the shrine we're lookin' for now, surely? But mebbe there's some other sorta connection that they had to the shrine. C'n one place be in two places at once?"

Zinzer says, "Hmm. Very well. Do you... seriously want me to find the Brass Man? I think that idea is brilliant and insane. And consider what my standards for brilliance and insanity are."

Tilara says, "When the Gods are involved, Andreth? I think they probably could be, yes."

Andreth nods. "I s'pose so." He turns to Zinzer. "So why can't ye do that for the brass man?"

Zinzer says, "The thing is, if I make a mistake, he'll know. And he won't be happy. Because he's never happy unless we're hurting."

Starguard hmms. "I don't sense anything evil all that close. Which doesn't mean all that much..."

Zinzer says, "Do you want me to go ahead and do it anyway, knowing that if I fail we may be burned to ashes?"

Zinzer says, "Which, of course, may happen even if we succeed."

Tilara says, "Maybe we should wait until tomorrow. You didn't take ice spells, you said?"

Andreth rubs his chin. "An' may also happen if'n we don't try at all. But..." He raises his head. "If'n we ain't ready to fight him, let's leave it for now."

Zinzer nods, looking relieved.

The next two days pass quietly, the hours steadily slipping away as the party clambers. Windrider's estimate was just a little optimistic; after all, he can fly over the obstacles that the others have to clamber over and around. Still, by evening on that second day, the whole company can see what looks like a small building in a small meadow. A building that looks familiar. Very familiar. Andreth can even hear a wisp of music on the wind.

Zinzer whispers... "So... there was a priest in the hut... and he played a flute... and this is the same hut? Do you think it will have the same priest?"

Tilara says, "We'll find out tomorrow."

Andreth rubs his chin, thinking. "The old man plays the songs of the dead. P'raps his hut travels so's he can greet the dead to hear their songs."

Zinzer murmurs, "You lot, have the most _fascinating_ acquaintances."

Starguard says, "Y'know, pressing on sounds really good to me at the moment. A night indoors, maybe even on a matress."

Tilara just grins. "Aye, that we have. You want to meet the Gods, stick with us. They've taken an interest in us, I think. I just wish I knew whether that was good or bad."

Zinzer says, "I was about to say, why wait for tomorrow? If this is an old friend of yours, perhaps we can request hospitality."

Tilara says, "Can we reach it before sundown?"

Andreth says, "Whether we go on or wait for t'morrow... I say we treat this as if we was 'ere for the first time. Maybe it is... it may be the same hut, but different people in it."

Tilara nods. "And arriving at such a place at night - even disregarding the guardians... let's just wait."

After considering carefully, camp is struck one last time before the hut will be reached midmorning tomorrow. The fire's lit, the beds are made, the weather is cold, and the night is long.

Zinzer says, "Well... so we just walk up and knock on the door? It worked last time, right?"

Tilara says, "Pretty much. Although they were expecting us last time."

The morning dawns, just as chilly as the previous few mornings. Breakfast is a sketchy affair, and soon the party is on the road, riding right up to the hut, which seems utterly deserted. The door hangs on one hinge, hiding the interior of the hut.

Starguard blinks, speaking with Windrider. "Is this normal? Where is everyone?"

Zinzer says, "We're probably expected this time, too. At least, someone must expect this."

Andreth looks around as they approach. "We saw mountain lions in the pool. Where are they?" he mutters. "I bet we're _expected_, all right..."

_The Mother's Nest is old; no nestlings live here._ Windrider sounds slightly amused.

Starguard huhs. "This one is deserted, apparently. That would explain why the one in the scrying was in the other direction. It's a different one."

Tilara says, "Down in the tunnels, perhaps?"

Tilara blinks. "In the other direction??"

Zinzer says, "Starguard? I didn't understand that at all. Is this the right hut or isn't it?"

Andreth steps up to the dangling door. "Well... it don't _look_ like anyone's home, but we c'n at least check." He reaches up, as if to knock on the door.

The door hangs around in the doorway ...

Starguard shrugs helplessly to Zinzer. "Your guess is as good as mine."

Zinzer listens to Andreth's hollow knock. "So... look around. Does this look like the meadow you were in before? Is it identical?"

Andreth hesitates a moment longer, then knocks on the door. "Hello? Anyone there?" No sound answers him but the squeaking of the door on its lone hinge. "Think we should check inside? Mebbe a little rude, but as long as we don't touch anythin'..."

Zinzer motions to the trees and the topology of the meadow. "This could be important. Is this the same meadow?"

Starguard says, "Windrider says this has been abondoned for a while. I think it's fair game to check out."

Tilara says, "Let's, then. Maybe there's passages underneath."

Zinzer says, "If this is the same hut and the same meadow... I think this is the same place. The right place."

Zinzer says, "But... not necessarily identical. Just like a house at night is different from a house during the day."

Starguard nods. "Let's check it out anyway."

Andreth turns round him. "Yeah. Exactly the same. 'cept with more mountains round it. An' it's been 'ere longer. But we know the gods c'n play with time," he adds nodding to Stormy.

Zinzer says, "Yeah." He turns to Jellin and Ellinor. "I think we're here. Or almost."

Inside, the hut looks even more familiar. The same chipped mug, and plate, sit on the shelf near the hearth and the old cauldron is rusting as it hangs from its hook over the cold fireplace. A pile of rags is piled in the same corner, but this time it doesn't move ...

Zinzer prods the pile of rags gently, in case it wakes up.

The rags settle, giving off a huge cloud of dust. There is nothing under the rags, however, not counting the huge dustballs, and the other rags below.

Zinzer taps at the floor with his staff. "There must be a way down... anyone any good at finding hidden doors?"

The floor sounds hollow.

Andreth says, "I know I heard somethin' yesterday. A bit of music... There's somethin' here, e'en if it ain't a person exactly..."

Tilara says, "That's right. Maybe you should sing -your- song for them again...?"

Zinzer says, "I think... I think this is the _real_ hut. All the others are... just illusions, somehow. Or ghosts, or spirit artifacts."

Andreth frowns. "I dunno, Tilara. 'e told me, when 'e played it, that it'd give someone power over me if they heard it. I dunno if I want to be singin' it when I don't know who... or what... might be listenin'."

Tilara hmmms. "Good point. But we need to do -something-..."

Starguard blinks, concentrating lightly. He frowns. "Huh. I sense something..." He continues to concentrate. "Two. Below. Evil..."

Zinzer says, "We could check out the floor. It's hollow and... umm... well, Starguard thinks there's something bad there." He looks uncertain of his own suggestion.

Starguard continues to concentrate, though. "Hmm... Not too strong though. Not weak, though..."

Jellin steps into the hut, smiling. "The song says we must go down, to find Samaela's Heart."

Tilara nods. "So down it is, as soon as we find the entrance."

Zinzer says, "Be careful. I think this is a holy place. I mean, a really important, holy place. Don't disturb too much."

Starguard pauses. "That's just the strength of the aura. The strength of it physically could be quite different."

Ellinor follows Jellin in. "A trapdoor, maybe?" She pokes at the floor.

Andreth says, "If what we seek is down there... then that is where we're goin'." He too begins to search the room, respectfully in mind of Zinzer's words, but thoroughly.

At first, the company searches for the way down carefully but quickly. Ultimately, also unsuccessfully. The little voice inside Starguard's head is chortling, as it points out missed spots here and there. Buckling down to a serious square inch by square inch search, the company searches once more. Finally, the secret is found in the hearth, under the rusting pot. Move the pot, scrape away the ashes, and a small trapdoor - just big enough to fit one human at a time - can be opened.

Opening the trapdoor, the company sees a long tunnel leading straight down, iron rungs set into the side so as to give people a way to climb down.

Tilara says, "Starguard, might as well tell Windrider that we'll be going underground for a bit. Have him keep the horses out of trouble, will you?"

Zinzer glances at Ellinor. "This is it, right?"

Ellinor nods, looking entranced. "I think so."

Starguard nods. "I'll do that and come down behind you. Careful. There's something down there."

Tilara nods. "There always is..."
