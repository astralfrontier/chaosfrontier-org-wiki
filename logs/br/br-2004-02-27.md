# Birthright 2004-02-27

Standing around the lip of the shaft leading underground, the party debated whom to send down first.

Zinzer looks down the shaft. "Well... it's... umm... it's certainly a hole in the ground."

Zinzer says, "Brother Starguard, did you mention something about horrific evil waiting at the bottom?"

Starguard says, "If it makes you feel any better, Zinzer, there are two evil things waiting at the bottom."

Zinzer says, "Two evils. Lovely. No waiting." He looks around at the assembled White Company. "So do you lot have a standard procedure for things like this? You must have done this all sorts of times."

"Pretty much," replies Ash slowly, as he moves to descend into darkness. "Luckiest goes in first. Smartest goes last."

The shaft extends a long way down, but the rungs that Ash is climbing down seem in good repair. A little greasy, as if rustproofed, but otherwise sturdy. The shaft extends a very long way down.

Zinzer seems about to say something, when it becomes apparent that Starguard will today be rearguard... but he decides that perhaps he's not as smart as he thinks he is anyway, and proceeds down the hole just before the paladin.

Finally, after what seems like a minor age, Ash sees the ground beneath him. He stops, foot on the last rung, and looks around. He's in a small perfectly round room, and on the floor an interesting design seems to have been painted. Or scratched. Or etched.

![](/images/brstone.jpg)

Cautious by now, Ash calls upward to his magically-inclined colleagues, describing for them in low tones what he sees before he considers stepping down. The sound of the company's descent could not have gone unmarked; murmured messages will hardly worsen their position.

"Stormy?" Starguard calls down. "Can you see if it's magical from where you are? You're the closest..."

Closing his eyes for a moment, Stormy concentrates, and then looks straight down ... "No ... It doesn't give off any kind of magic at all."

Zinzer says, "Eight points... Samaela had two sets of quadruplets. Not sure what the rings indicate... can we get down? I feel... vulnerable."

Obligingly Ash concludes his descent, hopping off the ladder and slowly drawing his blade. He stands ready while his fellows follow.

Cicling around, Ash finds himself in a round room, the walls curving away from him along both sides. Two openings, one to his left and one to his right, both easily tall enough for any party member to stand upright. Carrying a ten foot pole.

Andreth rubs his chin. "But which of 'em do we want?" he murmurs. He thinks about this for a moment. "The quad-ru-pu-lets..." he says, carefully picking his way through the long word. "Were they male 'n female, o' each o' the clans?"

Starguard huhs, stepping down the shaft, checking down for evil presences. Nothing. "Huh. That's odd..." he mutters, then detects upwards...

Zinzer says, "I think so, Andreth... four clans, eight children."

Zinzer thinks for a moment. "Two sets of quadruplets... that poor woman."

Zinzer says, "No... as I recall... the first four were all girls. Of the second set, only three survived birth - two girls and a boy."

Andreth ohs, and scratches his head. "Well, okay." He looks across the hall at both of the two portals. "So... what d'we have to choose from? Anythin' different about these two openin's?"

Zinzer prods the map on the floor with his toe.

Zinzer says, "Well... not the doors, perhaps, but certainly the arrows in the outer corridor."

The map gives off a puff of dust, which soon settles back down on the ground. Long before Zinzer accidentally breathes it.

Starguard huhs. "Thought I felt something up there..." he mutters. "Just a single one, too. I wonder..."

Starguard curses. "Watch the left!" he calls, drawing his crossbow hurriedly...

Starguard huhs. "Or not. They're gone. I think they're just playing with that."

Andreth spins round at the call, then sighs. "Any better idea what it is, Starguard?" he asks idly, then cracks his knuckles. "Well, we need _somethin'_ ta go on. Mebbe we should hunt 'em, if'n we can."

Zinzer cats a sidelong glance at Starguard. "Young man. If anyone in this room is going to be having psychotic hallucinations, it should be me."

Starguard says, "They moved back out of range. I didn't have a lot of time to focus on them."

Starguard raises an eyebrow. "Well, I've already got the voice in my head, so I think I should have first go, actually."

Zinzer looks over at Ash. "It appears we are being stalked. The map of the area is at our feet. How do we meet this threat and chop it into tiny bits?"

Starguard says, "Carefully, I suggest. Two ways to go, each time. Want to bet one is trapped in each case?"

"Unless whatever's there has been blessed with the ability to detect meddlers, as our Starguard detects evil, I think we'll be okay staying here for the moment," replies Ash. "Let's think about this carefully before moving."

Zinzer says, "Well... each of the eight points is probably associated with one of Samaela's children. Six live girls, a boy, and... one stillborn. The question is, which of these is the one we seek?"

Zinzer looks at Jellin and Ellinor, mild expectation on his face.

"Well, if it's a tomb we're after," comments Ash. "You don't usually mourn the living."

Andreth nods to Zinzer. "But afore we get there... we got a choice of two. This one..." he says, pointing to the left, "and that one," pointing to the right. He turns to the young Changer-kin as well. "Know ye any songs for a maze like this?"

Ellinor and Jellin shrugs, helplessly, at Zinzer. "Sorry ..." They hold open hands. "The songs don't go this far."

Andreth nods. "Then we got what we see to figger this out wi'. Or what we c'n find."

Starguard says, "Huh. Probably should have asked Windrider what he knew before we descended."

Andreth tilts his head. "Wanna go an' ask 'im?" he asks in all seriousnss.

Starguard nods. "Pretty good idea, actually. He called this the Mother's Nest, which means he probably knows something. Should have asked him before we came down, really."

Zinzer frowns, and kneels to examine the map. "Eight children... but this is a tomb of Samaela, not her children..."

Zinzer says, "If I had to guess, I'd figure that this room we're in is the important one. But I guess it can't be that simple."

Starguard says, "Someone want to come keep me company? I don't feel like going up by myself with that efreeti still about."

Andreth nods. "O' course," he says, heading for the ladder.

Zinzer pulls out a notebook and flips through it. "Remind me again why we're here?"

Starguard follows Andreth to the ladder. "Try not to need me?" he asks, before climbing up.

After a climb that lasts at least as long on the way up as it did on the way down, Starguard and Andreth find themselves standing once more in the hut. A few more steps, and they're outside, where Windrider swoops down to meet his new friend.

Starguard smiles. "I'm sorry, my friend, but we realized that you were the one to ask about the Mother's Nest. Can you tell us what you know of it?"

Windrider bends his head, and nods once, in a very human fashion. _Samaela, wife to Far Seer, daughter of Miardan, burst her egg here, and grew her own chicks._

Starguard takes a second to translate that, mentally. "Ah. So this is Samaela's home, and where she raised her children... Do you know anything about the basement, and the maze down there, by chance?"

_The nest is larger than it seems, and smaller._ Windrider pauses. _The chicks hatched, and grew, and went out into the world. And then one day they returned. All except the chick that never left._

Starguard huhs, and relates that particular bit to Andreth as he tries to figure out what Windrider actually means by it.

Andreth nods, rubbing his chin. "The one that ne'er left... that must be the one that died at birth, I guess." He looks at Windrider. "Which way did the other seven go, when they all went out inta th'world?"

_They scattered, to their own nests, and raised nestlings. Some returned sooner._ Windrider seems unconcerned.

While the paladin and the hawk were palavering, a form appears behind Andreth. Fists swing, bracketing his head from both sides, and pounding him to the ground.

Starguard whirls at Ash's grunt to see the leering visage of the efreeti. "You!" he cries, infuriated. He's eyes flash as his morning star is raised, trying to distract the efreeti enough with a mighty smash so that Andreth can quaff a potion if he has one.

Windrider screams out a challenge to the efreeti, and hops into the air to make his own attack, claws slashing and beak coming down on the genie, though Starguard's attack had little effect.

With one mighty blow, the efreeti measures Andreth against the wall of the hut. Slowly the body crumples to the ground, conscious but bleeding, while the efreeti, still ignoring the hawk, turns on the paladin.

Starguard attempts to retreat from efreeti's range to Andreth's side while asking Windrider to hold off the magical being.

Starguard attempts to back out of the way before kneeling down and healing Andreth, but doesn't get far enough. Hoping that the screaming hawk would keep the efreeti busy, he called the Stars powers...only to get clobbered himself. However, he managed to serve as a distraction, with the hawk's powerful claws raking into the magical beast.

The magical beast is completely failing as a distraction, allowing the efreeti to get two more body blows into cleric. Near fatal body blows, as he collapses unconscious to the ground. The efreeti grins, standing over the two prone bodies, and turns to face the hawk. "Tell them I'm holding these two. I want the nasty one in his little shorts."

Windrider cries out as it becomes obvious that Starguard is very badly hurt. He rises up into the air, away from the efreeti, circling the hut...

Bundling both bodies into a large, fireproof sack the efreeti slings the bag over his shoulder, and strides into the air, only barely hampered by the weight of the two men. As the hawk watches, the efreeti strides upwards, eventually stepping into a cave, high up on the mountainside.

Windrider cries out once more..then confused, lands in front of the hut. And waits.

Zinzer says, "They've been up there an awfully long time."

Stormy nods at Zinzer. "Windrider must have had a lot of stories to tell ..."

Ash nods slowly, and begins ascending the ladder. "I'll take a look."

Zinzer looks around the small room, and realizes that only magicians remain. Magicians, and their young wards.

Zinzer says, "Tilara... Stormy... keep an eye on the passages. Just in case. With ash out of the room we're short on swordpower."

"Somethin's wrong," is Ash's summary of events, as he crests the top of the ladder. "Up, now."

Windrider cries outside, audibly...but Starguard and Andreth are nowhere to be found.

Zinzer says, "Or... we can go up. You lot first." He follows the others up the ladder, leaving the underground chamber empty.

Zinzer says, "... where's Starguard? Where's Andreth?"

Ash is already out of the way by the time the others ascend, and he points to marks of a struggle clearly indicated on the ground. "The bird saw it," he suggests, glancing at Starguard's mount curiously.

Stormy looks around, confused and worried. As a first step, he turns to the two young girls, warding them carefully.

Zinzer waves his hands and mutters a few mystic words.

Windrider opens his wings, squatting down a bit. He's looking from the party off towards the mountains, eyes flicking back and forth, crying out now and then.

Zinzer says, "What is it, winged one? Where did they go?"

The hawk screeches. _Caves! Hostage! You!_

Zinzer looks off towards the mountain, and back at the signs of struggle on the ground... and calls to the hawk, "Was it the burning man?"

_Yes! Man! Hostage! You!_ The hawk seemed more perturbed than ever.

Zinzer mutters, "I already know the answer. He can't leave us alone." He looks up again. "What do you mean, 'you'? You mean ME?"

The hawk glares at Zinzer, loathing evident in every muscle of his body. _You!_

Zinzer says, "Me." He turns to Ash. "I think it wants me... umm..."

Ash shrugs. "Everyone loves a wizard," he remarks. "Where at?"

Zinzer spins and shouts back at the hawk. "Hey, you can't blame this on me! I'm an innocent bystander! I have no control over malevolant, burning, powerful... _things_... that choose to have a grudge against me! It's not like I could have hurt him at all!"

_Cave! Cave!_ Still screeching, the hawk sweeps into the sky, his wings narrowly avoiding clipping Zinzer on the way past! _You! Hostage! Ransom!_

Zinzer looks around at the elements of the White Company that are left. "Alright... so... umm... is this the part where I have to be the hero? Go up there and get them, sacrifice myself so that you kids can continue your mission, that sort of thing? Get picked off like a mauled raccoon in the gutter of the muddy and rutted highway of destiny that the White Company treads so easily?"

Ash nods. "Yeah."

Zinzer shrugs, and takes off his pack, and removes his spellbook. The notebooks and other contents he leaves inside, and hands to Stormy. "If I don't survive, this is yours. It holds more and weighs less than other sacks. You may find the notebooks interesting... umm... don't read the last half of the third one until after you turn 18."

Ash shakes his head. "We're going with you."

Zinzer says, "And why, by all the gods I don't believe in, would you do that?"

Stormy looks at Ash, biting his lip. "We're ... But ..." He sighs, and nods happily as Ash adds his later comment. "Alright." He turns to the girls. "Stay with Windrider. We'll be back."

Ash just smiles. "'Cause we're the White Company."

After a long, lonely walk up the side of the mountain; a walk whose length and loneliness are alleviated mostly by the discussions about who has what potions remaining. Somehow, there's a shared conviction that they'll be needed.

Finally, many hours later, the remains of the White Company reach the cave mouth, where they find a small pot bubbling on a fire. The pot contains a reddish soup. Smells a little salty.

Zinzer pointedly ignores the soup.

Zinzer says, "It's me he wants, you know. I don't know why he's taking it so personally. It would be safer if you all left now."

Moving forward, Tilara looks at the soup for a moment, before casting her old standby. A few mumbled words, a sigh, and she shakes her head. "No poison here. Just some blood sausage soup."

Zinzer winces. "Could you not mention blood?" He thinks for half a moment. "Or sausage?"

Moving forward carefully, Stormy steps into the cave. It's a shallow cave, with a single ledge, holding a single propped scroll.

Zinzer says, "Better let me read that. It could be dangerous."

Stormy steps out of the way.

Zinzer carefully picks up and reads the scroll, facing so that nobody besides himself will be caught in the blast if it detonates.

The scroll contains only a short paragraph. "I have your paladin. I have your monk. You have the one who dispelled the picture of my dead mother. You have moments to decide to trade, before this cave will collapse."

Zinzer says, "Mother? Painting? _What_ painting? Can't we just get another one?"

Zinzer looks over at the others. "Get out. I have to do this alone." He tosses his pack at Storm, keeping only his potions.

Ash doesn't move an inch.

Zinzer says, "Don't be a fool. Get out before the cave collapses. I'll deal with him. Don't worry."

Ash shrugs. "Live together, die together."

Zinzer says, "I'm not one of you. Don't be an ass."

Ash only smiles. "Sure you are. Now are you going to keep wasting air arguing?"

Zinzer marches forward and thrusts the scroll at Ash. "It's spelled out. We don't know how much time we have. It's me it wants. Get the young ones and get out or we all... die... here."

Stormy looks worried from man to man, wondering what will happen next. Behind them, the cave mouth begins to darken.

Zinzer whispers to Ash, "I can't order you around, but don't take them with me. Go."

Zinzer says, "We'll meet again! I swear on my life! I'll be alright!"

Ash nods. "Stormy. We have an obligation to the kids. If those who stay can't meet it, those who go have to," he says, turning to look over his shoulder.

Stormy ummms, and bites his lip. His eyes are wide, as he notices the cave mouth sweep shut. He turns back to Ash. "Windrider has the girls. And ... I don't think we can leave."

Ash nods slowly. "Okay then. Let's see what we can see."

As the cave darkens, a newly opened portal begins to glow.

Zinzer looks at Stormy, one last time. "Just... get out of here. I can't convince you reasonably, so I won't try. Just get out. Now. Or I'll waste a spell throwing you out. I know it has to be this way. You and those two girls can't be seperated. So you have to go, now. I saw it in a dream. The answer's in the notebook. You have to go."

Stormy shrugs at Zinzer. "I can't." He points laconically over his shoulder. "Door's closed."

Zinzer shrugs, and begins to walk towards the new portal. "It's OK, I was lying."

Stepping cautiously through the portal, Ash finds himself taking two steps along a tunnel that suddenly ceases to be there. Flailing a little, he falls straight down, falling on a soft, warm body. A soft, warm, barely conscious body.

Andreth grunts in pain. "Careful..." he groans. "Still sore..." He squints, trying to see what landed on him.

Zinzer steps through the portal, and shrieks as the floor falls away... and collapses in a heap on top of Ash and a pile of injuries that looks like Andreth.

As Stormy, in his turn, steps through the portal, the party begins to take stock. Next to Andreth, Starguard lies dozing on the ground, his wounds carefully taped up, and cold clothes covering the worst of the bruises.

Ash sets Zinzer down carefully as possible before cupping a hand around his mouth and yelling "'Ware fall!"

Andreth wraps his arms around himself, shivering in the brief garment that wraps around his waist. "Well, hello there. Glad t'see y'all are safe and sound, at least." He glances at Starguard. "Can't imagine why 'e'd care ta patch us all up..." he says, clearly referring to the efreet.

Zinzer says, "You stubborn, headstrong, heroic fools."

Zinzer says, "Do you know why I told you to get out? Because I'm not worth dying over. We're all going to get fried, and it's going to be my fault."

Zinzer growls. "I didn't want that. But now we're all here. So now let's all try to get out of here."

Andreth shakes his head. "Why d'you think our fiery friend 'd be satisfied wi' just you?"

Andreth shakes his head painfully. "Ne'er mind that. Any o'you got a healin' potion on ya's? Starguard's still pretty bad off." He ponders. "So'm I, at that."

From up above a booming voice can be heard. "Well? What will you do now, puny earthlings? Will you risk all to save yourselves? Will you trade one for all, or will all die for one? Will you suffer, knowing the pain you have caused?"

Ash yells up. "Just come down here and talk to us," he says. "What is your grievance?"

Zinzer pops a healing potion open and pours it down Starguard's throat. "If he's up, he can heal himself."

Zinzer says, "That's right! Come down here and talk, madman to madman! We're sorry about your portrait, but you know, you shouldn't keep those things where they can burn! It's your own damn fault!"

"You have burnt the only existing picture of a woman who will now never be reborn." The efreeti glowers, as he slowly floats downwards. "That picture ... small as it was ... was the only proof of my lineage. Now I will never be a king of kings. I shall eat the dust of your wishes for the rest of my long, sorrowful life." He pauses, at Zinzer's words, and casually reaches out to deck the mouthy one.

Zinzer collapses in a heap, battered. "There's other proofs of lineage! In the secret places of this world, the history of everyone who ever lived is inscribed in the walls on mystic runes!"

Arrested, the second fist pauses. "Oh?

Zinzer struggles to his feet. _If I am to die, it will not be on my knees, dammit!_ "Yes. The labyrinths built by Jurdah... they tell the history of the world. Some say, they are the history of the world. And the future. All that anyone knows, or ever knew, is down there. I've been down there, to some parts of it."

Zinzer says, "Surely one as powerful as you can find other ways to accomplish a destiny. You needn't waste it incinerating us. Your answers are down there."

Zinzer coughs up blood. "Or you can grind me to a pulp for the small satisfaction it will give you. And I'll die knowing that I got closer to the mysteries of this world than you did."

The fist slowly sinks down to waist level. "Ah. Well. No. There are rules, you see. The rules require the picture." His brow furrows, in anger. "I like pulp. It won't make me a king of kings, but it will solve the question of what's for dinner."

Starguard says, "Rules? Speaking of rules, didn't we free you? Don't you owe us three wishes?" Starguard is coming around...

A single, tiny, minuscule shrug. "Technically, yes."

Starguard says, "In that case, for our collective first wish, I wish for a picture of your mother, in a pendant, on a chain, and the whole thing protected with a permanent fire-proofing spell."

A pause. A long, silent, pregnant pause. "As you wish." He claps his hands together, and with a great thunderclap and a flash of lightning, a small object drops into Starguard's hands. It appears to be a pendant, on a chain.

Starguard shrugs, and tosses it to the efreeti. "Does this mean you're going to stop trying to kill us now?"

The efreeti holds up the pendant, after examining the picture carefully. Smiling ponderously, he slips the chain over his neck. "Mine will be the glory, and the kingdom."

Ash coughs, and beckons for the party to assemble.

Zinzer limps over to Ash. "I like this solution. Except for the part about getting beat to a pulp."
