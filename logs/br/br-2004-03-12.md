# Birthright 2004-03-12

After examining the alcove carefully, the company sets off, counter clockwise around the outer circle. At regular intervals, more alcoves are encountered. Each, just like the first, a shallow alcove. Each, just like the first, utterly featureless. Occasionally, Starguard feels a twinge, but never anything he can put his finger on.

Tilara frowns. "Well, that didn't do anything. Back to the center and come out by a different route?"

Zinzer nods silently, looking speculative.

Andreth grubles quietly, as the party completes a full circle. "We might's well. Hmph. There's gotta be _somethin_ ta distinguish 'em... I mean, that riddle the voice gave Starguard didn't say nothin' about direction."

Starguard frowns. "We're walking blind. Is there anything you girls remember? Ancient legends. It seems like there should be six changer clans, for one."

Zinzer asks Jellin, "Any of these 8 speak out to you louder than the others? Maybe that's how you know one's the Elk... or whatever."

Jellin bits her lip, speaking up for both girls. "No. There are only four Changer tribes, by the ancient legends. And ... We've been talking. There's ..." She shrugs. "We're here, so that Samaela's Heart can heal her. But ... " She pauses, and Ellinor looks at her. "There's one song, a children's riddle, that speaks of four and four. But it doesn't meantion Samaela at all."

Tilara says, "These things are usually cryptic. Run it by us anyway."

Zinzer looks at the girl expectantly.

Jellin nods. "I don't remember the exact words. But there's the four parts of action, the hands that hold, the feet that walk, the back that carries, and the eyes that see. And then there's the four parts of being; the love that heals, the soul that travels, the heart that bleeds, and the mind that learns."

Tilara says, "Hmmm." She doesn't seem convinced that this is even related, but...

Starguard huhs, considering those pairings, and looking around the party. "Maybe...that's us?"

Jellin shares Tilara's uncertainty, with a shrug. "It's a song of four and four, and yet ...

Zinzer shrugs. "Well... we want 'love that heals', I suppose, but that doesn't get us closer to identifying which is which. Let's do as Tilara suggests and try another path."

Andreth nods. "I got no other ideas. Less'n you folks wit an eye for magic want ta try yer talent... an' so far there's just too many things down 'ere for y'all to look at."

Tilara nods. "I suspect that checking for magic would be like looking for white in a blizzard."

Returning to the first alcove, Zinzer steps forward, centering himself in the square little area. There's just enough room for him to stand, without his shoulders brushing any wall. At first, nothing happens. He waits, quietly, concentrating, and something begins to tickle the back of his mind.

Zinzer feels a tug at the back of his mind, like a stray thought, and jumps out of the alcove with a start. "Umm... OK. We can try that again if we're desperate."

Zinzer says, "Let's try walking around some more, see if any more options come up. Or if a mountain lion tries to eat us or something."

Andreth holds up a hand. "Wait. What happened to ye, Zinz?"

Zinzer says, "I just... I don't know. It felt like something was whispering into my mind."

Starguard raises an eyebrow. "Do tell," he says, his voice as flat as the floor.

Tilara says, "Oh? Interesting..." She looks at the alcove with curiousity in her eyes.

Ash shakes his head. "I can understand why you wouldn't stay in there," he says. "But perhaps somebody has to." And with that, he advances to the alcove, taking the position the wizard did.

Zinzer says, "I'm sure you know better than I, paladin."

Again, there is a moment of deathly quiet, and then a tickling in the back of Ash's mind. Slowly, the tickling expands, and he closes his mind, as a new world begins to super-impose on the old. A world full of blood, slowly pouring down the walls.

Ash begins speaking, in a low, calm voice. He describes what he sees, uncertain if the others see it too. Privately, he doubts it. Should he die, or worse, at least the White Company will have more information to add to its store. Should he live, a bold deed paid off.

Zinzer peers uneasily at the walls. _Blood... it would have to be blood..._

Tilara says, "Anything heart-like, Ash?"

Ash speaks further. "I see walls bleeding, with varying intensity. Candles are burning, thickly.." His voice quavers a bit, but he steadies himself and continues, seeking for some change in the vision or some hint that it has shown him all that's necessary.

Zinzer murmurs, "We should be ready to pull him out..."

Andreth says quietly, "Are ye okay, Ash?"

Ash shrugs a little, through his trance. "Sure.. I'm just fine," he says. "Blood's nothing strange to me."

Ash steps back at last, shaking his head and wiping at his brow with an armored arm. "That was it, I think," he says quietly. "I'll do the others too, if there are no other volunteers.." He shakes his head again, examining the sensation that lingers.

Andreth responds, "I'd like to try the next one. If that's all right wi' y'all..."

Zinzer says, "I wonder if the alcove shows you what's in your heart, or what's in the alcove... to be sure, someone else will have to try the same alcove again."

Starguard says, "If you don't mind, I'd rather not. I've had enough with voices, recently."

Ash holds up a hand toward Andreth. "Just a moment," he says softly.

Tilara says, "I'll give it a shot..." She looks toward Ash. "What?"

Ash shakes his head again. "Let me make sure this sensation is just an after-effect first," he explains, touching his brow with a pair of fingers.

Ash hmms, and smiles. "Thorns. A crown of them, almost," he concludes. "That was what I felt. The other alcoves should be safe, but keep an eye on me just in case."

Tilara says, "A crown? Interesting..."

Zinzer says, "I guess 'Crown', of the four that stayed, is the one that didn't live to maturity."

Zinzer says, "Too bad. In so many other legends, the Crown is a god of Peace... ever hear of Potapki?"

Ash nods. "Let's confirm the nature of the other alcoves, then decide what to do next," he suggests.

Zinzer nods to Ash.

Zinzer says, "Might as well try the next one over... umm... Ash? Will you test my theory, or should we try another volunteer?"

Ash smiles. "Sure, I'll go," he says. And so he does.

Once within, Ash follows the same procedure, outlining what he sees, hears and experiences: "eyes like a fish's, on the side of the head.. less light, more clarity." He reaches out with fingers, moving them languidly in the trance of the magic. "Lines, here.. like this."

Zinzer frowns, and sketches the lines on a page. "The hawk, perhaps?"

The lines look like the branches of a tree, leading upwards.

"Pressure on the shoulders, too," adds Ash, somnolently. "A great weight or burden. Not painful, but growing."

Starguard huhs. "The carrier, I suppose."

Ash backs away at last. "First are the sights and sounds and sensations," he concludes. "Gradually the alcove reveals what I guess to be the principal symbol associated with it. It's always something very personal, something you feel rather than something you see."

Zinzer shakes his head. "Don't know which one that might be... Mother, Father, or Moon... I'd expect the impressions of the Changer progenitors to be realted to their animal forms."

Andreth's eyes are closed, following Ash's example. "Sunset... facing to th'west... it goes down... and darkness... 'n loneliness..."

Andreth blinks, then closes his eyes again. "Brother Oak? Far away... so far away..." His foot rises in the air, as if to take a step forward... then he remembers himself and stays still...

"A tree, the point of commonality," observes Ash, quietly.

Zinzer says, "The father, I'd think. Or perhaps the moon."

Andreth turns his head, as if to survey the scene before him. "And there's all of you... and Father Pesci... and now you're gone..." He does take a step forward, this time. "No mooon... just blackness..."

Ash blinks. "Hmm. Perhaps not."

Starguard grabs the back of Andreth's collar, keeping him from moving too far...

Andreth steps straight into the wall, and staggers backward, stepping out of the alcove as Starguard pulls him back. He shakes his head, as if to clear the spots from his eyes.

Zinzer says, "Maybe it would be best if we don't have Andreth do any more of these... I must admit I'm curious, myself." He steps up to the fourth alcove.

Andreth shakes his head. "Nah, I'm all right... just don' unnerstand what I saw, is all." He nods gratefully to Zinzer. "Ye go ahead - mebbe ye'll know what ye see better 'n I did."

Tilara says, "Well, there is supposed to be one who died. Mabyt this one is the corresponding alcove?"

Zinzer says, "Things in my hands... claws on my fingers... little that I can see, but there are many within me... many who dance as puppets when I move my paws..."

Starguard says, "That's gotta be the cats. Rat-eaters that they are."

Zinzer steps out of the alcove. "Cats, to be sure... does the mean that the next three will be the other Changer clans?"

Mirra mrowwls curiously to Tilara. She chuckles as she responds. "No, dear, I'm sure he didn't mean that that was a bad thing."

Andreth shakes his head. "Sounds like th'hands that hold, from th' rhyme. Though what else, I dunno..."

Zinzer looks around, and sees that nobody is jumping at the chance to step into the next alcove, and so does so himself.

Zinzer frowns, saying nothing. A look of worry crosses his face.

Andreth tilts his head. "C'mon, Zinzer, speak up..."

Zinzer says, "Nothing... no... now a point of light, in the distance... I'm flying... I'm flying over a broad plain, flying west, sunrise is behind me... the sky is lightening... mountains... desert... oh... I see everything!"

Tilara says, "Travel. Gotta be travel."

Ash hmms. "A hawk's perspective."

Tilara pauses. "Or seeing? Could be either. But you're right, it does sound like the hawks."

Zinzer frowns again. "Gone..." He steps out. "Hawks, probably. I think I envy them."

Tilara says, "I'll take the next one, I think. This sounds intriguing."

She leads the way to the next alcove and steps inside.

Tilara's eyes flick from spot to spot as she stands there. "This is Vision. I can see everything - the dust motes, the imperfections in the wall, the pick marks that weren't quite smoothed over..." She glances down. "Even the pulsing of the skin as the blood moves underneath. This is... " She steps back out. "That was almost too intense."

Zinzer says, "I'm uncertain which tribe that would be... the wolves? The elks? The moon?"

Tilara says, "I'm not sure either. Hawks are traditionally the ones with good eyesight. Let's try the next one." She leads the way again.

Tilara says, "This one is.. dark. Light. Dark. Magic. First spell. Arguments. Not going to marry him, daddy. Potions. Poison. The White Company. Little Stormy. He's grown up now. There's Mirra... poor little kitten. Dark again. Firelight."

Zinzer looks at the others with a blank look. "What?"

Andreth scratches his head, looking puzzled. "Could be th' mind that learns..."

Zinzer says, "That just leaves one, then."

Tilara continues. "Nice old fellow, the abbot. And the librarian wasn't too bad, once Mirra brought him mice. Berina. Bitch... The palace gardens. Four seasons in one. The Empress and the Emperor and little Potapka." Mirra yowls in distress at the confusion in her mistress' mind, finally, and the others drag her out. "That was disturbing. Couldn't focus on anything."

Ash is the next to enter an alcove. His vision unfolds, and he again speaks in the quiet, distracted voice. "My feet itch, and hurt, from heavy use," he says, wriggling a little. "Patrols, and boundaries, and borders.. walking, always walking."

Starguard sighs. "The feet that travel. Did a bit of that in my day."

Zinzer says, "Well... we came here so that Jellin and Ellinor could find some healing... well, which one do we suppose is that?"

Andreth rubs his chin. "I... think mine may've been the closest ta the love that heals. But... Starguard's riddle... th' one 'is voice told us. D'ye remember 'ow that ended?"

Tilara says, "Knowledge alone will open the door."

Andreth nods. "Yeah. O'course, it coulda just meant knowledge as in, ye have ta figger out the riddle to open th'door. But..."

Starguard says, "Or the one Tilara was in before, I suppose."

Tilara says, "You wouldn't be able to figure anything out while you're in that one. It was like being flooded with all your memories at once. I couldn't even focus enough to step out on my own."

Andreth says, "Whereas mine was... emptiness. Nothin 'cept the people I know... people who've cared fer me, I guess."

Zinzer says, "Well... if I understand correctly... you sort of... died, once."

Zinzer says, "Maybe someone else would obtain a different result. In any case, I think that one is the best match, if only because the others don't seem to fit at all."

Andreth nods. "Yeah... I s'pose I have, at that," he says, rubbing at the scar. He tilts his head. "Well, whate'er the case, I agree, yeah, someone else should try that 'un. Just so's we know what's diffrn't."

Andreth says, "Someone else prob'ly wouldna ha' seen Brother Oak, f'rinstance. 'Cept Starguard, mebbe."

Starguard says, "Probably. I'd be there a lot longer, too. I knew...a lot of people."

Zinzer says, "Well... I don't want to be the one. I don't want anything to do with the 'love that heals'. There's nothing wrong with me, anyway."

Stormy steps forward, diffidently. "I could try it?"

Zinzer nods. "Ah, of course."

Andreth nods to Stormy. "Go ahead..." he says quietly.

Moving back to the alcove where Andreth saw Brother Oak, Stormy steps inside. "There's a great plain here, fires burning everywhere. And then ..." He stops. "And then there's Tilara, and Mirra." He pauses. "The fires are slowly burning out, and the heat is lessening. And there are Jellin and Ellinor." He stops.

Zinzer says, "Stormy?" He pauses. "Anstar?"

Stormy, stepping back out of the alcove, nods at Zinzer. "Yes?"

Zinzer says, "Well... what happened at the end?"

"At the end?" Stormy shrugs. "Nothing. Just ... Jellin and Ellinor." He tilts his head, thoughtfully. "Nobody moved, or said anything. They just appeared."

Zinzer says, "I think that's the one, then."

"Maybe one of them should try it?" suggests Ash. "Unless there is some unseen, long-term detriment to using the alcoves. They are safe in the short term."

Zinzer says, "Perhaps if Ellinor were to try it, she would see some of the answers she seeks. And if not, there's seven others. I can't imagine there being anything more mystical than these alcoves down here."

Andreth shakes his head at Zinzer. "Ye don't think so? If there's one thing I've learned in me travels, it's that there ain't no such thing as nothin' more mystical. But... that's neither here nor there." He nods to Ellinor. "It's up to ye... do ye want ta try it?"

Zinzer stares at Andreth, agape, but says nothing.

Ellinor nods, and steps in quickly. Her eyes close for a moment, and she sways. Her voice is barely audible, as she discusses her vision. "A field. Carts, everywhere. Blood. So much blood. And Jellin. And Anstar. And ..." Her hand comes to rest against her belly, and she sways, before collapsing to the ground.

Andreth's eyes widen. "I don' think we oughta stick around this time," he says, stepping forward to pull her free. "Starguard?" he adds, against the possibility that the magic may have injured her somehow.

Starguard quickly moves up to check Ellinor over, pulling her back out of the alcove in the process.

Starguard says, "She's fine, just...collapsed. Must have seen something."

Andreth nods grimly. "Hmph. Rather th'n her wounds bein' healed, she's been reminded of 'em again." He taps the stone wall at the edge of the alcove. "If this is th' heart that heals, there's somethin' gone awry with it... or else I ain't understood what it's for yet."

Tilara says, "She didn't seem alarmed when she fainted... we'll see what she says when she wakes up."

Slowly, Ellinor's eyes open, and colour returns to her face. Still pale, she struggles to sit up, and looks at Stormy and Jellin. "We're ... I'm ..." She stops, her hands cradling her belly once more. "We need to get back before winter hits."
