# Birthright 2004-03-26

Starguard kneels beside Ellinor, as the young girls hands go to her belly, looking over at Jellin and Stormy. "Are you alright, Ellinor? Other than being with child, I mean."

Zinzer quirks an eyebrow.

Zinzer says, "Oh, dear... umm... how long ago was that?"

Starguard says, "I'm not sure yet, Zinzer. Just reading the expressions. That'll be the next question."

Ellinor shrugs. "I think so?"

Starguard quickly checks the young girl over, nodding. "You're alright, all things considered." He looks over his shoulder at Stormy, eyebrows raised, not saying anything.

Stormy looks back, his expression bleak.

Zinzer rolls his eyes.

Zinzer says, "We could ask the Guardians of this place, what the key to the riddle is. If we could get them to not slash us to ribbons first."

Andreth sighs softly to himself, looking off into the distance. A memory of the Changer trials recurs to him, and not a pleasant one. _After all she's been through... though I s'pose it was inevitable._

Moving forward slowly, Stormy stands on the opposite side of Ellinor, then kneels down to hold her hand. Beside him, Jellin glares at Starguard.

For his part, Ash stands off to the side, muttering to himself and reciting the rhyme, and considering his memories of the alcoves. He's only mildly aware of the drama nearby; in his experience, bringing up human life is woman's work, and bringing up the crops is the man's. He knows nothing of what to do or say, and so, showing what wisdom he can sometimes manage, he says nothing at all.

Starguard shrugs, standing up. He's not surprised, but he had to be certain. "I hope that the child takes after its mother," he mutters under his breath.

Zinzer tries a hunch, and goes to stand in the western alcove - the one the Company thinks is associated with mind and learning.

Zinzer closes his eyes, and visions come to him. "I'm back in my father's shop... I'm staring at the facets of a gem... I see a flash within, and a place far away... Then I start writing in a book... the words and numbers follow, only as many days pass..."

As Zinzer watches the words form in his mind's eye, he reads them, recognizing a piece of lore here, a list of spell components there. And here a list of the habits of the common or ground squirrel. As he reads, the words begin to speed up, slipping out from his pen, and then disappearing as the pages flip. And then new words appear. Words he's never written.

_She glows, bright as the sun, lighting up the night. While she burns, the darkness is held at bay. But she burns from the inside, she burns up, her body burns in flame, until she is nothing but cinders. Darkness comes rapidly, as her ashes fall to the ground, where her children gather them, and bring her back to life._

Zinzer says, "Oh, my," Zinzer says. "That's the story of the Moon... I... I never wrote that..."

Zinzer steps out of the alcove and removes a notebook from his pack, rapidly flipping through it. "The sun and the moon... the moon burns at night to compensate for the missing sun... but it harms her, so she continually goes through cycles of burning and healing." He scribbles on a blank page.

Zinzer sits, thinking. "I wonder... how this relates to our expecting lass, here."

Ash breaks out of his reverie and regards the wizard. "Would it be useful to get a second set of experiences?" he asks. "I or another can try the alcove as well, while seeking for the door."

Zinzer says, "Perhaps. It seems clear we're lacking in the knowledge department, perhaps we'll all get a different piece of the puzzle."

Ash nods, and steps forward, resolutely. He takes his place in the alcove, remembering the insensate zone through which Ungfallen's realm was found. _I believe I possess the knowledge; I seek the door_ is his only thought.

Much of the vision Ash receives is not spoken aloud; he regards as private the stream of experiences he receives. "Childhood," he says, "and learning. And being struck for my temper, and losing it again.. Leaving, coming home, settling down, rising up in anger again, and always being taught. Be like the seasons.. a man goes through his own seasons." He recites languidly. "He was right, I learned that by being saved by the Company.. learned everything he said was right.. sorry, father."

Behind Ash's father, as the vision fades, a man stands. His visage is benevolent. Slowly, he steps forward, merging into then man Ash knows so well. And above him a single star springs up, then fades away.

Ash describes what he sees dutifully, feeling that the true import of the vision has at last arrived. This time, no detail need be spared due to his wish for privacy and pride.

Tilara nods as Ash finishes. "So. Moon and Star. I wonder... let me try that again, now that we know what it is." She steps back into the alcove, pausing only a moment to reassure Mirra.

Tilara tries this time to control the vision, and succeeds only slightly. "I... yes. Childhood memories. Years of learning, widening my vision, expanding my horizons... different, though. A woman, always watching. Motherly, but not my mother. Hearthkeeper?"

_Cats are roaming._ There's a sense of urgency in the voice, now ringing through Starguard's mind. _Call when you come._

_I ride the winds._ The voice fades, as distance breaks the bond.

Zinzer says, "I wonder if this alcove is showing us our totems... have you heard of the totems? Do any of you know your own?"

Zinzer says, "We can test the idea by taking someone who knows what their totem is, and asking them to stand in the alcove."

Zinzer looks around. "You don't know what your totems are? This could be tricky."

Tilara says, "Well... not really. Do you know yours?"

Starguard chuckles. "I have a suspicion about mind. As does Andreth, for that matter."

Ash hmmms. "In any event, I believe we're getting different outcomes based on the knowledge we now have. Let's get everyone to try the alcove, just in case."

Starguard says, "Hmm. Stormy, do you want to try? Or should I, as I know who I am aligned with."

Tilara says, "I think Ash is right. Both of you should."

Stormy looks at Starguard. His voice cold, he waves Starguard forward. "Why don't ... why don't _you_ go."

Starguard nods. "I'll go first, then." With some trepidation, as his heads been rather busy the last few days, he enters the alcove.

Zinzer murmurs to Ash, "Maybe you keep a watch? We don't want those overgrown mountain lions coming back and causing a distraction."

Ash nods, and casually takes up a position against one wall, scabbarded sword casually cradled in his arms and ready to be drawn.

Starguard's eyes lose focus as he gazes back over time. "The army nights, dealing with the casualties from the day, working long over so many bodies, so many fathers and sons... Coming out at the end of a long shift, ready to collapse as the stars shine benevolently over head, head full of instructions to save boys with little time to do it in...riding at night under the stars, going to the next battlefield. Then chosen, and peaceful learning with the young Father..."

Behind the vision the wolf walks, padding along ... keeping the young Father company in his dreams.

Ash nods slowly. "If it's a totemic association, that's secondary," he observes. "Notice the common points. A father, or a mother, or someone answering the same purpose. Not just a mentor or teacher, but something closer."

Starguard nods, stepping back. "I see your point, Ash."

Tilara says, "But what? I didn't recognize who the woman was in my vision."

Ash says, "What did you feel about her? What was your impression?"

Tilara says, "She was ... well, traveling with me. Keeping an eye on me, perhaps, but definitely accompanying me, somehow."

Zinzer says, "We each saw something that watches over us."

Zinzer says, "Ellinor... we may not have much time. Perhaps you should see what it is that thinks to watch over you?"

Ellinor stands up, slowly, and nods. She moves into the alcove in turn, her eyes already closed, her hand on the wall. "I see wide open fields. Some of my family is settling here; learning how to farm the land. I race across the field, bringing warning. The wind is lifting up my hair, as the braid slips loose. Between my legs, the elk's muscles bunch, as she carries me forward." Ellinor pauses. "But where is Jellin? Where are my brothers? The houses are empty; the windows dark. There is no smoke."

Stepping back, Ellinor looks around, her eyes wide. "Winter is coming."

Tilara says, "You had that impression from the last one, too. Is this a normal winter you're seeing?"

Ellinor shakes her head. "No. It's a cold, bleak, winter."

Ash says, "Who is the elk?"

Ellinor shakes her head. "I don't know."

Starguard says, "I suspect it's the Elk. The one born here."

Starguard says, "Ash, Andreth, Starguard, Tilara, Zinzer, Jellin, Stormy, and Ellinor. Eight."

Zinzer blinks at Startguard. "Huh?"

Tilara says, "Eight of us. Eight alcoves. One of us in each, simultaneously?"

Andreth nods to Tilara, pacing back and forth. "But which o' us where? That's the question..."

Tilara says, "Indeed..."

Zinzer says, "Stormy in the Shield, and Starguard for healing. Seems like good starters."

Starguard says, "Perhaps, just to make sure, we should all enter this one? Just to get our totems straight."

Zinzer says, "We're short on time. The cats are coming back, remember?"

Starguard says, "Admittedly that is a problem. However, I'd hate to find out what happens if we get this wrong, either."

Andreth pauses in his pacing, and stares at the alcove. "Yeah..." he murmurs. Now that it comes to it at last, he fears what he himself might see there. But... "I s'pose I oughtta try it next..."

Andreth steps into the alcove and closes his eyes. As with the others, his first vision is of his childhood. "The Middens... to survive, you had to know how to steal, how to fight..." He clenches and unclenches his hands. "Moving like a cat, like the feral cats in the alleys..."

Andreth remains there a while longer, then steps forward, shaking his head in confusion. "N,not quite what I'da been expectin," he comments quietly.

Starguard says, "Jellin, would you be so kind?"

Sighing, Jellin steps into the alcove. Her hand claps to her forehead and comes back bloodied, and she collapses backwards, her eyes rolled up. After a moment, she regains conscious. "The bleeding, Starguard. It won't stop.'

Starguard says, "So Stormy must be the Hawk then."

Starguard says, "And Jellin, Poptaka."

Starguard hmms. "So we need to align the four and four to the four changers and the four Gods. The elk is obviously the back that carries, and the wolf the feet that walk. So that would make the Cat the Hands that Hold and the Hawk the Eyes that see." He points to Ellinor, himself, Andreth, and Stormy in order. "Anyone disagree?"

Tilara shrugs. "This is more your line of expertise than mine. Continue."

Starguard frowns. "The other four... The crown is Potapka, with her thorns. And as you keep seeing blood, Jellin, I think the heart that bleeds. The father and mother are Keniltwen and Wilthorwen, and Sunni is the moon, but I'm not sure which goes with which there."

Starguard says, "From Zinzer's description of what he saw, I think that Sunni would be the mind that learns."

Tilara says, "Well, my experience certainly felt like a motherly mentor, so I think I'd go with Wilthorwen. But which alcove?"

Starguard says, "Were you always moving in your dream? Did you feel transported, Tilara?"

Tilara says, "Hmmm. No, not really, I'd say. Just that she was there."

Starguard says, "How about you, Ash? Zinzer? Did either of you feel like you were traveling?"

Zinzer says, "I didn't feel like I was travelling. I was seeing my own history."

Ash shakes his head. "But my father was there. He's a soul, right?"

Starguard nods. "I think that might be right. OK, Ash, Kenilthwen, Soul Travels; Jellin, Potapka, Heart Bleeds; Tilara, Wilthorwen, Love Heals; and Zinzer, Sunni, Mind Learns. Let's go to our alcove and enter together."

Tilara nods, and heads out to her designated location. When she arrives, there is already something in the air of the place, as if it is anticipating the group's action; but it feels wrong. She hurries back to confer with Starguard, and discovers that Ash has had the same feeling, so the two of them switch locations. She calls her familiar to her, and steps into the alcove with Mirra in her arms.

As the people, young and old, step into their alcoves, visions begin to sweep into their minds once again. The same visions, more vivid now.

As the world around them fades away, subsumed in the visions swirling through their head, Starguard feels a nasty slashing pain across his abdomen, slicing through chainmail as though it wasn't there, while fire explodes in his thigh.
