# Birthright 2004-04-02

Starguard roars in pain as claws rake across his belly, claws poking through the chain to carve a bloody, gaping wound, sending the paladin stumbling back into the hall, and alerting the rest of the party that something is most definitely wrong.

As he stumbles back into the hall, he sees his opponent. A giant creature, topping him by several feet, leonine features grinning down at him as claws rake once more, at will, across his belly. Chainmail offers little resistance, and the paladin feels the pain of a gutwound. As he collapses to the ground, a second creature steps over him, bow in hand, and looks down the tunnel in both directions. For a moment, it seems to hesitate, looking at the former creature. Then it looks down at the fallen paladin, and back up.

Tilara blinks out of her reverie as a scream of agony echoes through the hallways. _That was Starguard!_ She takes off at a dead run, trying to get there as quickly as she can, while Mirra hangs on tight to her mistress' shoulder.

Starguard bleeds heavily...but beneath the surface, his wounds clot almost supernaturally, blue light playing over the cut.

Zinzer starts, and steps out of his alcove to see what's going on. Seeing nothing around the curvature of the corridor, he clicks his heels together and begins running towards the screaming with unnatural speed.

Zinzer sees two huge humanoids with unusually feline-like features. He utters an explitive of surprise, which quickly turns into the first syllables of a spell for blinding. The bright, polychrome flashes leap from his fingertips to the eyes of the assailants. One stumbles in surprise. The other, with the bow, looses his arrow with spoiled aim, and nicks the shoulder of Zinzer's leather shirt without drawing blood.

Zinzer continues the arcane gesture, and the spray of colors intensifies into an electric crackle - and a moment later a sheet of lightning leaps from his hands. "Duck!", Zinzer screeches, and falls to a crouch. One of the humanoids does the same, but both are burned by the passing electrical storm, filling the corridor with the smell of burnt fur.

Enraged, the creature tosses aside its bow, and pounces on Zinzer, seemingly crossing the entire 20 feet in one hop. Or so it feels to Zinzer, as the creature's claw slices through his shoulder and across his chest.

Running up, Stormy pulls up short when he sees Zinzer attacked. Standing behind him, he tries to catch his breath and cope with these monsters.

Pouncing forward, the larger of the two leonines looms over Zinzer. Claws slash out, crisscrossing his other shoulder. The first spins him into the second blow, and sees Zinzer crumpling to the ground, leaving Stormy standing behind him, wide-eyed and very very pale.

Tilara slows down from her dead run as she gets close, hearing the flash and zap of spells and the growling of whatever is out there. She comes around the corner to see Stormy standing against two giant tiger-things. _Damn, I thought the Cats would leave us alone for a **little** while, at least._

Andreth pelts down the corridor with preternatural speed, and arrives just in time to see Zinzer fall to the claws of the tiger-creatures. Reaching to his belt, he pulls loose a bag of alchemical goo and calls out, "Hey, kitty! Catch!" As they turn to face him, he lobs the bag at one of them, which bursts, releasing a sticky goo that quickly hardens, attaching its feet firmly to the stone of the corridor.

Looking down at the frozen Stormy, who suddenly finds himself regretting his run up behind Zinzer. Lips curl up, and long paws reach out, claws fully extended. Digging deeply into his shoulders, they keep him stable for a moment as the creature bends down to leisurely bite at his jugular. Blood spurts, as the creature throws Stormy to the side where he tries frantically to scrabble out of the way.

Tilara slaps a magic bolt into her crossbow and fires, sinking it into the nearest creature, where it crackles with lightning. _I don't like the looks of this at all. We're split up and being defeated in detail._ She backs up slightly, trying to maintain a gap between her skin and those claws.

Andreth rushes forward as Stormy retreats and swings a fist wildly at his feline foe. The blow whistles harmlessly through the air, and two swats of the creature's great paws rip gaping holes in the monk's clothing... and skin.

Behind him, Andreth can hear the mumbled words as Stormy defends himself. A disk pops into existence, swinging around in front of Stormy, literally shielding him from these creatures.

For his part, Ash sees two downed figures and two more staggering with wounds as he rounds the corner. Discretion is the better part of valor, he reflects, as his hand grabs for a potion of _shield_ and he downs the hot, bitter product of sorcery.

Tilara fires another shot, but misses both while trying to miss Andreth.

As one of the tigers maneuvers around Andreth in the tight corridor, the monk takes another swing, which smashes the creature against the wall. The tiger-oid blinks, unfazed, and then pushes off the wall and past Andreth, the bruises fading even as the dismayed young monk watches.

Worse yet for the young monk, the creature slices back, with claws that do rend, and open long curving gashes in his skin.

Moving up a little, his own claws reaching out, the second creature plays with the much weakened monk, one paw daintily reaching out to swat him. Somehow, he misses. Hissing in frustration, he swats out with the other hand, and this blow connects, the damage causing the young monk to crumple to the ground.

Concentrating mightily, Stormy glares at the giant cats. Now it's down to Tilara, and to him, and hopefully to Ash. But ... he holds out his hands, pointing at the cats. His fingers spread wide, and ice shoots forth, catching both cats.

The smaller of the two, the one who had just finished playing with Andreth's now crumpled body, crumples in turn, collapsing on the young monk.

Around the corner comes Ash, his greatsword ringing as it slides out of its scabbard. It slashes through one of the feline-forms once, and a second slash barely misses. Ash is already rebalancing himself, fresh from his charge, the fires of hell burning in his eyes.

Tilara waits for the right moment, and sinks the crossbow bolt into the remaining tiger's back as it turns to fight Ash. The bolt hits perfectly, sinking deep and discharging its magic deep in the creature's vitals.

The feline spins around, facing Andreth. His claws come up, a smile still curving his lips as he reaches out and both claws miss. And then he reaches forward, still smiling, as his teeth close over Ash's shoulder.

Creeping forward, Jellin stops at Starguard's body. At first she looks worried, and then she kneels down, going through his pockets to find the healing potion she knows he has. Once she finds it, she pauses again, looking up the tunnel. _Starguard? Or Zinzer?_ Finally, she shrugs, creeping forward a little further.

Holding out his hands, Stormy can feel the power leaving his body. No great shards of ice; this time. Mere spicules, flying from his finger tips, missing the cat.

The greatsword swings again, jarring the air as it brings another ragged cut through the great beast. Ash growls, eyes darting left and right past the thing to see the condition of his friends before returning his attention to the shaggy hybrid.

A shaggy hybrid who is glad to take advantage of even momentary distractions, claws sweeping across the noble warrior's chest. That pain alone is enough to bring Ash's attention back to the creature, though, and he parries and blocks every other shot.

Tilara fires again, this time managing only a scratch as the bolt flies past her opponent. She swears, but is already loading the next.

Creeping up on Zinzer, Jellin looks cautiously down the corridor. She's holding the potion as she checks the mage. He looks dead, but ... No. The chest is still moving although his breath is shallow. Relieved, she pours the potion down his throat.

Ash bats the cat's claws away, and spins on his foot, positioning himself on the other side of the tomb wall from the beast. He turns away, backing up rapidly and swinging his sword underhand. It slides fully into the beast's guts and Ash forcibly backs up with a shout of rage. The cat is pinned against the wall, its padded feet a foot off the surface of the floor. Its blood courses down the greatsword as Ash steps away and turns, regarding his companions with blazing black orbs as he leaves crimson footprints on the ground. "That's how it's done," he announces grimly.

Zinzer staggers to his feet, and takes the remaining healing potion from his belt. Assessing the casualties, he decides that Starguard, if he still lives, will need help the most, and administers the potion to the downed paladin.

Tilara lowers her crossbow and nods to Ash. "Indeed. A timely arrival, I think." She asks Jellin, "Do you recognize them? Or aren't they Changers?"

Starguard coughs after a moment as the potion slides down his throat, his eyes opening as a bit of congealed blood is spit onto the floor. He groans. "I am getting far too old for this. Who needs my help the most?"

Tilara says, "Andreth. He charged in and found out he couldn't hurt them, I think."

Zinzer stumbles over to Andreth, not waiting for the potion to finish its work on Starguard. Too tired for a smart-ass remark, he simply says, "Andreth. And your foes, if you wish." Already he's seeing to the battered monk. "He's holding steady, but that's not saying much."

Starguard sits up and crawls to Andreth, checking him out for only a moment before using his strongest healing. His muttered comment reveals that he's either not interested in healing the cats at the moment, or is interested in finding Zinzer a feline mate. The former being more likely.

While the others concentrate on achieving consciousness, Ash rifles through the hybrids' gear. They're not wearing much. Belts with pouches, vests, and a few items strapped to thighs and such. Still, in the one pouch he finds four rods, all tied together with string, and in another he finds a small bottle, carefully stoppered. Then there are the bracers both creatures are wearing, and the cloak - now covered in blood - draped over the archer's body. In one pocket Ash finds a glowing gem, and in the other a second small bottle.

Ash piles it all on the floor of the tomb, for inspection in a moment. "I need one alive," he states, in a voice like ice.

Tilara says, "What for?"

After a few moments, the gem ceases to glow.

Andreth sputters, as the healing draught passes his lips. "gggh..." he mutters, looking around and seeing what's left of his foes. "What th'hell _are_ those things? It took my fist like I wuz just pettin' it..." He blinks, and stares at Ash. "Bwuh? Are ye out of yer mind?"

Zinzer is inspecting the remaining humanoid. "If you're going to discuss this, you don't have long to make up your minds."

Ash rests his hand lightly on the hilt of his sword, fingers drumming lightly on it. "I didn't say for long. Do it."

Jellin looks at both of the bodies and pauses. "I'm not sure." She steps closer. "Yes. This one ... this is Three Toes." She points at the former archer. "And I think the other is Prey Pacer. It's ..." She gulps. "It's a little hard to tell."

Starguard uses his weakest spell to stabilize the more healthy feline, the skewered one on the wall beyond his help, before turning back to healing his own side.

Tilara nods. "They followed us, you think?"

Starguard says, "I've been sensing them all along..."

Zinzer holds a dagger at the felinoid's throat as Starguard casts. "Ash... you may want to relieve me here..."

Starguard shakes his head. "He should be unconcious for a while yet, Zinzer."

Zinzer keeps his dagger pressed near an artery. "I'm unwilling to accept that risk, old son."

Ash draws his enchanted blade out of the wall, and dispassionately regards the remains of the Changer that slides off its edge and onto the floor. He approaches, hunkering down, and stares. "We need healin'," he says. "If this one won't die, let's check what they had, after that."

Zinzer steps back, and asks Jellin, "These are from your lands? From tribes and villages known to you?"

Jellin turns to look at Zinzer. "Well ... all Changers gather once a year, for the Tellings. Prey Pacer had just started a new clan two years ago. He was looking for mates for his cats. We had ... I had ..." She blushes. "At the time, he seemed awfully nice."

Ash gestures back toward the small pile of trinkets and trophies. "And that?" he asks of Jellin.

Zinzer pats her shoulder. "People are complicated." He raises his hands and begins to trace runes in the air. "But not so complicated..."

Tilara nods. "He probably would've _stayed_ that way if the Cats had won the Courtship."

Jellin nods. "Perhaps." She shrugs, looking at the trinkets. "Those bracers are probably magical. They look familiar. There's an artison, makes a lot of them." She looks at the other trinkets, and shakes her head. "I never was much good with magic, though. I don't know if any of them are."

Tilara grins. "Well, then. I can help with that." She casts the cantrip, since Starguard is busy with healing and Zinzer with the prisoner.

Tilara says, "Let's see... the bracers, the gem, these rods... I wonder what the heck they are? The cloak - better wash that, I guess. And this bottle. Not that one, though."

Tilara continues to concentrate. "As to what they do... the bracers are protective magic. The gem and the bottle seem to be illusion magecraft. The cloak is conjuration... interesting. And the rods are abjuration magic of some sort."

Zinzer says, "He's... unconscious. If he becomes conscious in the next six minutes, I might learn something."
