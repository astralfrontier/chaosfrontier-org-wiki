# Birthright 2004-04-09

After a long and painful fight, the party slowly but steadily regroups. Preypacer lies, very very dead, on the floor, while Three Toes slumbers, still unconscious.

Ash hums, eyeing the Changer. "Is he likely to be out for long enough for us to keep looking into these alcoves?" he asks at last, sounding a little more calm.

Tilara says, "I wouldn't trust him any farther than I could throw him. Starguard? You think he'll stay down for a while?"

Zinzer says, "Did anyone feel something unusual this time, before we got attacked?"

Zinzer says, "Regardless of the physician's opinion, I don't want to take those risks. Anyone have anything we can secure him with?"

Andreth nods. "Yeah. It was... more vivid when Ash 'n Tilara swapped places. Sharper."

Zinzer prods the big Changer. "Like, say, a boat anchor?"

Starguard says, "He should be out for days, too weak to move, really. He's lost a lot of blood. I can heal him, but I'm willing to wait for a little."

Starguard says, "Given limited resources, the enemy is healed last."

Zinzer says, "I suggest we secure him first, and then go back and finish our experiment."

Zinzer says, "I don't really feel overly concerned for healing him."

Andreth nods. "But first... Starguard, d'you ken if ye can tell if there's anythin' else comin'? I'd hate ta be interrupted again."

Starguard nods, turning about... "I don't sense anything...I think we're alone now. Would someone tie our guest up?"

While Ash uses what's left of the party's rope to securely bind the very unconscious felinoid fiend, Zinzer takes the time to examine the eight remaining alcoves, and the rest of the party fans out, staying always in earshot of each other and examining the tomb for any sign of further invaders.

Tilara leads the way widdershins, and stops at the first alcove - it's opened up, with a triangular room beyond, the former back of the alcove now the base of the triangle. And within it is a mummified corpse. A hurried check of the rest reveals the same for each - the corpse beyond the alcove identified as the Moon is tiny, apparently a baby.

Tilara says, "So it _is_ a tomb."

Zinzer says, "Oh, my... this is... rather morbid."

Starguard looks in the first room...and bows his head slightly. "Ah. Jellin? I think perhaps you should tell us more of the songs."

Jellin steps up to look at the little boy's corpse. "So .. so that was how the song ended. We never knew. Well, not really. Samaela told me she wondered why Samaela's heart would still be here, but when you look at it, it's obvious, isn't it?" She looks at Ellinor, who is standing back, hands covering a still flat stomache. "Can't you feel it?" Ellinor wonders. "It's all around us. Love, and hope, and sorrow."

Zinzer says, "'Knowledge alone will open the door...'"

Starguard nods. "This is indeed a holy place. I wonder why the Cats would dare attack us here."

Andreth says, "It's a holy place o' the Changers. P'raps they took issue wi' us comin' here."

Jellin looks at Starguard. "I think ... I think Preypacer was leading his group outside the clans ..."

Tilara says, "We were escorting one of Samaela's Children. It was not their place to gainsay her, as I understand their ways."

Tilara nods at Jellin's words. "I suspect you are right."

Starguard says, "Hmm. Too bad the changers aren't still assembled. I suppose we should tell Samaela, though, as soon as possible."

Zinzer says, "If I understand you correctly, the Cats lost much in the last Courtship. And they'd have reason to believe you lot were responsible."

Tilara says, "They couldn't stand losing, no. Poor sports."

Zinzer says, "These bodies... I've never seen anything like this before. They're visible as powerful magic in a mage's eyes, but... not ordinary magic. More a magic of importance, a magic of being from a very old and influential part of history."

Tilara gives Zinzer an odd look, and murmurs the cantrip herself. She ponders the result. "Most curious..."

Andreth nods quietly. "So... there's more ta legend than history, an' stories handed down. Even true stories."

Starguard hmms, and curious, tries the cantrip himself, to see if he recognizes the power.

Starguard blinks, a bit awed. "It's the power of...life itself. Not healing power, but just, pure...existing."

Andreth turns to Ellinor. "Surely this is... what ye came here ta seek." He pauses. "We've come with ye this far, but I don' know if any o'us can show ye the way from here."

Tilara nods. "It's certainly nothing I've ever seen before. But if this is supposed to help Ellinor.... what should we do?"

Ellinor looks around. "I think ... " She blushes for a moment. "This may sound weird, but I think I'd like some time, alone, with each of Samaela's children?"

Starguard winces. "I don't suppose someone could stay with you, just in case? We should have learned that lesson by now."

Ash gestures vaguely. "We'll cover the inner entrances. Yell if you need anything," he says. "Unless there is another, secret way in, you should be safe."

Andreth says, "If'n there's a more secret way in thn' the secret ways we've found... I doubt we'll be able ta stand against anythin' that could find them." He shakes his head. "Le's just make sure this maze is empty, then guard the one entrance."

Tilara nods. "Well, we could guard each room while she's inside. Don't want to get too far away, but we can stand back far enough to give her privacy."

Starguard nods. "Everyone split up and meet in the center? Make sure we cover everything?"

The party quickly splits, making sure to cover every passageway in the three rings at once, almost like some arcane dance as the party goes inward, by twos and ones until they meet in the center.

The White Company splits into two groups to watch each of the two entrances. Ensuring that the tombs are otherwise empty, they keep watch over the prisoner and Jellin while Ellinor meditates at each of the eight crypts. All is quiet and still, save for Ellinor's sporadic movement.

Finally, after the last alcove, Ellinor returns to the group. Her eyes are open, her pupils dilated, but there's a serenity about her that was missing, before. And her stomache is noticeably a lot less flat than it used to be. Jellin takes on look at her, and smiles. "Time to go hunting for fathers, Ellinor?" Ellinor nods. "Time to go home."

Tilara nods. "Time-slip again, I think. How long were you meditating, Ellinor?" Mirra looks curiously at the young woman, then leaps up onto her mistress' shoulder. _Kittens soon, yes?_

Ellinor looks down, noticing her hands moving. "I wasn't gone long, but ... " She smiles. "I will need four fathers, now."

Tilara grins and rubs her familiar's ears. _Probably just one, love. Humans don't ..._ She stops at Ellinor's comment. _Or maybe yes..._. "Four fathers, Ellinor?"

Ellinor nods. "Or one father. Samaela showed me the children I will have. We will need a big tent."

Starguard blinks, looking over Ellinor for a moment...then nodding. "We should hurry home. Still, what do we do with this big lug? Take him with us, or leave him here?"

Tilara shrugs. "Good question. Any insights, Ellinor?"

Jellin steps forward. "If we bring him back, he will be judged ... and will die. If we leave him here ..." She pauses. "But ... He will be hard to guard."

Ash eyes Jellin. "He's going to die anyway," he states, flatly. "We'll wake him up and see which way he wants it to happen."

Starguard says, "True. Probably worth it if we can manage it, though. I think we should take him back with us to be judged. Though the last time, that didn't really work out..."

Tilara says, "If he would be executed for this offense, I'd say we just do the job ourselves. Taking him back would be a monumentally miserable task. So... I think Ash is right."

Andreth quietly nods his assent to Ash.

Zinzer says, "Didn't we have some questions we wanted to ask him? Like, 'What did you hope to accomplish by ambushing us'?"

Ash nods. "I know exactly what I'm going to ask."

Tilara says, "But in any event, let's get the body and the mess out of here."

Starguard says, "I'd like to know who sent him, myself."

Through the silent tomb, and up, and out, the party lugs itself, the gathered trophies of a hard-fought battle, and the unconscious stalker. The sole survivor of the ambush against the White Company is trussed up tightly and redundantly, and Ash checks the ropes and bindings again as Starguard attempts to rouse the bestial fighter.

Shaking his head slowly from side to side, Three Toes' eyes open marginally, and he stares at Starguard. Within moments they narrow, and his nostrils begin to twitch.

Zinzer gestures to Ash and murmurs, "Some insurance?"

Starguard glares back. "I wouldn't try it if I were you. You'd never rise to your feet."

The blade of Ash's greatsword is resting lightly on the Changer's throat by the time his eyes have opened; the fighter is taking no chances now. "You have one chance to live," he declares, conversationally.

Three toes twitch. And then three other toes twitch. Other than that, Three toes doesn't respond ..

"If you can't communicate, you're a beast, and of no use to us," continues Ash. "In which case I'll wear your skin home." And the point of his sword presses a little more closely.

Three toes looks down at the sword. "And if I can?"

Tilara says, "Then you may still be of no use to us, but we won't skin you."

"Why did you attack us?" asks Ash, getting directly to the question.

The Cat shrugs. "Prey Pacer is ... was my leader. He tells us to kill Samaela's children."

Ash nods slowly. "Do you owe allegiance to the Changers at large, or just to Prey Pacer?"

Three Toes pauses. "While he lived, we were Prey Pacer's, to command. But now ... I don't know."

Ash flashes a glance to Starguard, then back to the cat, with narrowed eyes. "Speak the truth. Is your sworn vow of greater importance than your life, or will you break an oath willingly?"

Tilara says, "The vow dies with the one it was sworn to. Take it back a step, then. Why did Preypacer want them dead, Three-toes?"

A long, pregnant pause, and then a shrug. "The oath is fulfilled, now that Prey Pacer is dead. What oath would you have me foreswear, since I hold none?"

Ash sighs. "I am not a man who asks people to break oaths, under ordinary circumstances," he mutters. "But if you speak truthfully, then I give you three choices. Die here. Return to the Changers, Jellin and Ellinor's people, for judgement. Acquit yourself to them or die. Or swear an oath to the White Company, to be a guardian and guide until we return to civilized lands. After that, you are on your own."

Out of sight of the changer, Zinzer looks appalled. He speaks deferentially. "Perhaps a word with you, Mister Ash?"

A longer pause, and then Three Toes nods. "I will guide, and guard the little ones."

Ash nods. "If you betray us, you will meet your master soon," he promises, then stands, withdrawing the wickedly-edged blade. He beckons silently for the rest of the White Company and the party to gather, well away from the still-bound Three Toes.

Tilara glances back at the bound Changer, then looks to Zinzer. "Well? Did he mean that last?"

Zinzer murmurs to Ash, "He speaks the truth, but he doesn't want to talk about why Prepacer wanted the children dead. That means he must know. Also, his oath of protection was focussed on Jellin and Ellinor. You might want to have them make it clear that we are also their escorts. I suspect that Preypacer was working for someone else and Three-Toes finds more fear in divulging who that someone is than in his own death... which means it must be a truly important someone else. Important enough to fear more than death."

Zinzer murmurs, "This part where we don't kill him is disturbing to me. He speaks that truth but that doesn't mean he can be trusted. However, if he doesn't want to tell us who his boss' boss was, then I want to know even worse. What a terrible dilemma."

Ash nods slowly. "Since we're going to return to the Changers at large shortly, we'll have more time and better assistance in gleaning these answers than we would here, alone in the wilderness. Wouldn't you agree?"

Tilara nods. "You and I both, Zinzer. I thought you could read his thoughts with that spell?"

Zinzer says, "It's that part about crossing hundreds of miles of tractless wastes with someone who tried to kill us that's disturbing to me. I can read his mind like an open book, but it's written in a foreign language."

Tilara shrugs. "The traveling with enemies, we've done before. I would like to know who he was working for, though."

Ash holds up a hand, then turns, striding back toward Three Toes. He doesn't bother with his sword, this time. Personal force is all the impetus he needs - or hopes he needs - to receive the answer he wants. "Your oath is to the White Company and those who travel with it," he says sternly. "Not merely the two girls. And if you keep that oath with the same dread and integrity you keep the secret of Prey Pacer's motives from us, then I do not doubt you. Do you so swear?"

"I so swear." Three Toes intones the words solemnly, and with great force. "By the claws of my mother, and the claws of my father, by the wings of my grandfather and the antlers of my great grand mother, I so swear."

Zinzer nods, once. "So he does."

Ash turns back, inspecting his companions' faces, a drawn knife ready to cut the bindings should they assent to this.

Starguard shrugs. "I'm not too comfortable about this either, but heck. I'd love to see him at tribunal, but with the deal we gave him..." He shrugs. "Such is life, I suppose. Just have to hope for another long-term enemy."

Zinzer shrugs, noncomitally. "I'm just an advisor. Decisions are for your bonded ones."

Tilara says, "We beat two of them after being taken by surprise. We can take him out any time we need to if he breaks his oath. Do it."

Duly noting each word of support, Ash kneels, and cuts free the ropes. "We of the Company are not the children of Samaela," he says. "If there is any lingering animosity in your heart for us, I suggest you rid yourself of it now." He rises, sheathing the small knife, and offers a hand to aid the newly-sworn guardian and guide to his feet.

Rising to his feet, Three Toes looms over the entire company. Then he shrugs, his body shimmering and shrinking down into human form. "Will you return my tools?"

Starguard hmms. "We should fetch Preyfarer and deal with his remains as well. Shouldn't leave a body in such a place."

Ash says, "Prey Pacer's arms I claim for the Company. I've taken your loyalty in exchange for your life. I see no reason to withhold what is yours."

Andreth nods to Ash quietly. He has confidence in his companions, and that if Three Toes proves a peril, that it will be a peril dealt with readily enough.

Starguard scans the sky for Windrider, calling his friend.

The great Hawk comes soaring down. _Yes, friend? You ..._ He catches sight of Three Toes, and takes wing again, planning on gaining altitude and then swooping down on the cat. Or the human, as he seems to be just now.

Starguard blinks. "Easy, Windrider. He is sworn to us for now. Truce, truce!"

Windrider sails the skies, his mind troubled. _Truce?_ Finally, he seems to acquiesce. _Truce._

With that unfortunate business out of the way, the party turns next to the body of Prey Pacer. Only after he is safely and properly interred does the Company turn to his possessions, for the way back may still be dangerous, even with the addition of a potent guardian force. Magically-gifted rods, bracers woven with enchantment and spell, and a curiously deep quiver are all among the goods the party re-requips itself with.

The evening passes uneventfully. Jellin, Ellinor, and Three Toes trade suspicious glances, but no more. The rest of the party meditates and works fitfully, conscious of the wounds of trust and loyalty that are closing as slowly as the battle-scars from earlier. Ash and Zinzer do what they can to identify the path to the tomb, and report to the Abbot about the success of the venture. Tilara and Starguard in turn speak with Ellinor, Jellin and Stormy as the evening passes, though there are many issues left to face, and first steps are all that's appropriate for now.
