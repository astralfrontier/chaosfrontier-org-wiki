# Birthright 2004-04-16

Come the morning, Three Toes is packed, and ready to go. At first he seems willing to lead, but after watching the party head out in an unexpected direction, he shakes his head. "There is a shorter path, Ash. More direct. If we are to see Ellinor home before she bursts ..."

"Describe it," replies the swordsman, curiously. "What can we expect to find along that path?"

Turning to face directly south, Three Toes points at the mountains. "There's a pass, not too high, between those two mountains. We'll be in for a bit of a scramble, on the one scree slope, but the Bird can help the girls with that. You took the long route to get here." He pauses. "Past the pass, there's a long skinny lake; we've got two small punts tied up, so if we take those, we can just float down the lake ..."

"If they are missing, what is our contingency plan?" asks Ash, thinking ahead to possible difficulties.

Starguard says, "And winter's coming. Will we be able to get through the pass without being snowed in?"

A single nod. "We can be through the pass in three days. And then a week on the water, a bit of a slip up over a second pass, and we'll be in Samaela's camp. Just ... don't fall in the water. That lake's all glacier run off."

Ash nods. "Alright. We'll try it," he announces. "If we run into anything unexpected, Ellinor and Jellin can still be taken care of."

Starguard huhs. "Worry about an early storm, though. If we see something coming, we need to consider going around."

Smiling, Three Toes nods. "That's what I thought. And ..." He looks back over the original proposed route, and shrugs. Then, lifting his pack high on his shoulders, he turns. "Shall I lead the way?"

Tilara says, "Just stop in time to get wood together. Stormy and I can keep the fires going even if the stuff's wet."

Stormy looks confused. "I'd rather gather wood on the march. Just in case ..." Ellinor, behind him, nods.

Ash raises an open hand in an inviting gesture. "We'll gather what we need as we go. Lead the way."

Starguard mounts Windrider, taking to the air to scout and watch.

Several days are spent, trudging slowly up one mountain side, and across a shallow pass, before dipping down into a deeper valley. The wind blows cold now, stridently cold, and winter's demons are stirring, waking, rumbling. In the evenings, Three Toes shares warmth with the two girls, under Stormy's jealous eye, while fires blaze high. There's a surfeit of firewood here; nobody's thinned the evergreen forests in a long time.

---

At the head of the lake, three punts lie on the shore, each with two paddles. The wind is blowing colder, and this evening, as you reached the lake, the first flakes of snow began to drift down, harbingers of the weather in store.

Small waves ripple across the long, narrow lake, as it stretches beyond the beach. Cliffs rise, on either side of it, sometimes fading away a little into natural harbours that are guarded from the elements, and from creatures, by their very inaccessibility.

Starguard frowns as we get to the edge of the lake, flying down, accompanied by light snowflakes, and menacing clouds in the distance. "What do we do, boss?"

Tilara says, "Three-toes.... why are there three boats? Who else came up here with you?"

Three Toes looks at the third boat. "There were ... only two punts. Prey Pacer and I rode in the one, and our guide rode in the other ..."

Tilara says, "What happened to your guide?"

He shakes his head in confusion, moving closer to the third punt. "This one ... this one is new. Different paddles. And someone left rations behind." He looks up at Tilara. "Our guide? He flew home."

Andreth scratches his head. "So d'we wait for whoever had this boat ta get back? Take it, 'n hope he don't get upset, or that he's someone we'd be upsettin' anyhow? Leave it and make do with the two?"

Starguard says, "He did, did he? Huh. Perhaps we should leave one, then? The third might be some other traveller, who cound end up in worse shape than us."

Tilara says, "Indeed. He's probably counting on it being here when he gets back from whatever he's doing. You want to scout around, see if you can spot anyone?"

Andreth glances at Starguard and Three Toes. "Either of ye think ye can tell which way our sailor friend went?" he asks, gesturing to the lakeshore past the boats.

Starguard heads up into the air, breathing heavily as he presses close to Windrider as they fly for the sake of warmth. He returns shortly. "Nothing. Except cold and snow."

Tilara says, "Hmm. D'you think you could get a hint from your Patrons, Starguard? If it's meant for us, I'd hate to leave it..."

Starguard says, "If there's still food there, they can't have been too far gone. The squirrels would have raided it by now."

Andreth scratches his head. "Well, this _is_ a puzzle 'n no mistake. Someone wuz here, 'n isn't expectin' ta be gone long enough ta take all 'is rations with 'im. And yet 'e doesn't leave any trace o' where he went. Mebbe he c'n fly, but if so, why'd he take a boat inna first place?"

Tilara shrugs. "Who knows? Maybe flyers can't carry much. But I'd think the gain in speed would more than compensate for that..."

Starguard says, "Let's leave it, Til. We can manage with two, I think."

Tilara looks around. "It's already getting dark. Maybe we should set up for the night. Starguard, maybe tomorrow you should get one of those advice spells and ask the Stars whether or not we should take the extra boat."

Andreth chuckles wryly. "Assuming the matter ain't decided for us inna night." He looks around. "But if'n we do that, where do we camp? Preferably somewhere that cain't be seen from th'boats."

Tilara says, "Why not? I think we can handle whatever it is."

Starguard points upwards at the light flakes. "Under a cave or overhang. If we must stop..." He shakes his head. "I think we need to press on ahead of that storm, or risk getting stuck up here."

Tilara says, "Find a bit of shelter, and don't worry too much about hiding. If it's snowing, that'll do it regardless." She shrugs at Starguard's worry. "How far can we get in the dark? Three-toes said it's a week on the lake. I don't think spending an evening here or a few miles farther along is going to make much difference."

Starguard shrugs. "I'll go with the group, but if it snows, or the lake ices up a bit, we're walking through cold, wet, deep snow... That distance might help."

Andreth taps his chin. "Well, look at it this way. When our friend gets back ta his boat, 'e'll see that ours're gone, and _'e'll_ come lookin'. 'E c'n probably guess where we're goin' more or less. So why not set out now?"

Tilara says, "Because he might _be_ a friend. The chance of using the extra boat is worth the risk of an hour's travel."

Ash listens quietly through the discussion. "The hazards here make us unsafe whether we leave now or leave in the morning," he says at last. "We have lights that no water can douse, and at least some protection from the elements. We take two boats, and leave tonight."

Andreth nods quietly to Ash. "So... ye 'n Three Toes 're good with a bow." He smiles wryly at this last. "So ye should each be in diff'rent boats. Other 'n that..." He looks among the rest of the party.

Tilara shrugs. "Vote on it, I guess? Anyone else want to stay?"

Tilara looks at the others, but no one seems to think waiting is worthwhile. "No? All right, then... let's move out if we're going to. We want to make the next cove that Starguard saw." She starts loading her gear into one of the punts.

After a little more desultory debate, the die is cast. In the one boat, Ash takes the bow, while Stormy and Starguard man the paddles and Tilara sits in the stern. In the other, Three Toes takes the bow, his bow in hand, while Andreth and Zinzer experiment cautiously with the paddles. Overhead, Windrider soars, the two girls resting comfortably on his back.

After an hour or so, the skies darken as night falls. Steering in to shore, Andreth and Zinzer beach their craft first as Three Toes jumps ashore. Ahead of him, the two girls have already landed, and Ellinor has started a small fire with firewood she was carrying.

The overhang, small as it is, manages to keep most of the wind out. Overnight, the flurries slow down, and while everyone wakes covered in a thin layer of snow, the skies are now bright blue overhead. Heartened, the party takes to the lake again, helping the currents along with their paddles as they feel an uncertain need to hurry. Overhead, Windrider and the girls are having a grande olde time, romaning ahead and behind.

Several more days pass, just as the first. But on the fourth day, at noon, the skies cloud over, and the flakes begin to fall once more.

Starguard curses, and quickly makes sure that Ellinor drinks a potion as the tempurature drops. Her children need to be able to fight against the cold, even if the rest of us have to suffer a bit.

Tilara mutters something that probably isn't very ladylike. "We keep going as long as Windrider can fly, I would think? The sooner we get out of these damned mountains, the better."

Starguard says, "We keep going after that, even if we have to walk, and Windrider needs to fly ahead. We're in the middle, and we can't turn back now."

For his part, Ash says little to nothing about the weather. He's been spending days - now that the imminent threat is over - reflecting on the places he's been, and the environment he's passing through now. Privately he wonders how many of his family or friends would ever travel this far, and he warms himself with thoughts of a roaring fire at his back as he tells the tale of his journeys to the others.

Grimacing at the taste, Ellinor follows the orders Windrider so very obviously conveys. The bird sweeps out ahead, scanning down the lake. _A larger beach, Starguard. And shelter. A tent ..._

Starguard blinks. "Windrider says there's a tent and shelter up ahead. Maybe we can make it there if we push on."

Slowly, paddling down the lake, the punts reach the beach that Windrider was alluding too. Large enough, here, to beach the punts with room to spare, and further down, half under an overhang, a small Changer tent, smoke coming out the smokehole in the roof.

Windrider, carrying the girls, circles overhead, as yet unwilling to land.

Andreth studies the tents, and nods approvingly at Windrider's circling form high in the sky. "So, who wants to go 'n knock 'n find out who's home?" he says, in a voice barely to be heard above the wind.

The punt shudders as it encounters land, and Ash hops out, shakily attaining the beach and twisting his limbs about in random gyrations to ease the stiffness out. "The White Company hails a fellow traveler!" he bellows, one hand cupped around his mouth. "One man approaches in friendship!" And he starts walking - ambling, really, in a gait that could in no way be mistaken for either stealth or the rush of an attacker.

The tent's doorway slides open, fur being pulled to the side by a single dainty hand, and a small, feminine face looks out into the blowing snow. "Ho the White Company, and hail." She smiles, impishly. "Skies bring you to me, snow drives you, water carries you, and now skin will shelter. Come, the White Company. I've fresh tea waiting."

Ash smiles. "Thank you," he says, then raises a hand, beckoning for his fellows to join him. And until they do, he doesn't take even a single step forward.

Windrider swoops down, depositing the two girls on the beach before taking shelter in the cliff's lee.

Starguard says, "Fantastic, and thank you ma'am. But how did you know we were coming?" Starguard looks somewhat puzzled, but stranger things have happened before.

The door opens a little wider. "If you leave most of your arms behind, and if that big kitty shrinks a little, there's room enough for all to sit. We'll be close, but ..." As she smiles at the company, Three Toes seems to shrivel. Where once he stood seven feet tall, now he stands but five. A stocky ginger haired man, his clothes hanging loose on him.

Inside Tilara's tunic Mirra purrs. It's so nice and warm here. And then Three Toes transforms, and all hell breaks loose, as Mirra tries to get **away** from that strange gingery man!

Tilara yelps as her familiar reacts to the Changing. "Mirra! Stop that! You've seen changers before."

Smiling at Starguard, the girl stands in the doorway, swathed in layers of warm furs. "I could smell the winds, and hear the paddles. You ... are not the best of sailors."

Looking profoundly embarassed, Mirra sidles closer to Tilara, head butting in an obvious attempt to get picked up again. _Cold? Nastybad cold?_

Andreth grins sheepishly at the young lady. "Most of us wuz born miles from anythin' bigger'n a river," he says, as he folds himself into the tent. He bears no arms, so need leave nothing outside.

Tilara nods, gathering Mirra up into her arms. _I know, dear heart. What d'you think of our hostess?_

Inside the tent, a small fire burns in a brazier, under a pot of fragrant tea. The scents of roses and mint mingle in the air. Moving out of the way, inside, the girls sits down cross legged on a thick fur. Behind Andreth, the youngsters fold themselves into the tent, curling up like puppy-like next to her. "I'm Kalaeciana, late of the Cat clan."

_Furry kitten lady has nice tea. Smell?_ Mirra curls around, getting perfectly comfortable.

Tilara raises one eyebrow. "Late?"

"You'll pardon us if we bear a suspicious air," offers Ash. "We've had unfortunate incidents and betrayals of late. It's nothing personal."

Kalaeciana smiles. "No; not a problem. My Change came as late as my clan membership, you might say. Or it didn't come at all. And after my brother's failure, the leaders are intent on weeding out the weaklings."

Andreth ahs softly, not comprehending for several moments. Then his slow, quiet thought processes remind him who the young lady's brother must have been. "Oh! Uhm." He raises an eyebrow. "I'm... sorry to hear that," he offers lamely.

Tilara murmurs a quick cantrip over the tea while the girl is distracted.

A single shoulder tilts up. "I knew that the day might come ... Kalaecian was proud, and famed in the clan for his animal husbandry skills. He raised hunting cats." Kalaeciana smiles. "My kitty is hunting tonight, and will be back in the morning." She looks intently at Three Toes, as he enters the tent, and then she smiles again.

Stirring the tea, Kalaeciana serves it up in small leather cups. "But drink. The wind blows cold and bitter tonight." She smiles wistfully. "I would offer food, but my kitty hasn't returned yet, so the pickings are slim."

Starguard says, "Perhaps we can offer you something there, ma'am. We do have some supplies, and we can share."

Tilara nods. "We certainly can. I have a question, though. Do you know anything about the third boat that was on the shore uplake?"

For a moment, Kalaeciana bites her lip. Then she shrugs. "The Hawk and the Wolf are hunting in the passes. My job is to stay here, and keep this campsite up and running, against their eventual return."

Starguard says, "Glad we decided not to take their boat, then..."

Tilara says, "Well, we weren't going to without some kind of sign."

Andreth muses quietly. The mystery of the boat is resolved, and yet it deepens as well. "And... what d'they hunt?" he asks cautiously.

Kalaeciana smiles. "They hunt the Changelings. Under Prey Pacer's leadership - and isn't that a horribly pretentious name - the Changelings have decided to move deeper into the mountains, taking Samaela's Spirit with them." A single shrug. "But Three Toes is here now. Prey Pacer must be dead. The hunting will be slim for the Hawk and the Wolf." Three Toes nods, once, at her comment.

Tilara says, "Prey Pacer found us at the Shrine, and died attacking us."

A single nod from Kalaeciana. "I suspected as much. Then the shrine is real. I will inform the Hawk and the Wolf, when they return."

Starguard says, "Beg pardon, but you're being awfully nice to us...might I ask why?"

Looking at Jellin, already half asleep. "You carry Samaela's First Born, with you. And the brother of her other First Born. All Changers will offer you comfort." Kalaeciana pauses. "With the possible exception of the Changelings."

That evening, Kalaeciana shares her tent, and while the space is a little crowded, that serves all the better to maintain the heat. In the morning, the party resumes their journey, leaving a small amount of food behind to tide Kalaeciana over. The clouds are still overcast, but they are not, as yet, releasing their snowflakes to the winds. With Three Toes' encouragement, and a steady stroke, the party should reach the far end of the lake a few hours after nightfall.

And indeed, an hour or two before midnight, the punts beach under the moonlight on a shallow sandy beach. Beyond, the water trickles into a number of smaller streams, but none wide enough for the boats. By now, making camp is done quickly and efficiently, and the day eventually follows the night as it has every other time.

Come the morning, Three Toes points at two mountains. "We travel between them. We're only a few days walk from Samaela's camp now."

Tilara says, "Let's hope the pass is still clear."

Three Toes smiles. "It will be. Mostly. Come." He leads the way once more, a spring in his step, as his paws grip his bow firmly. Staying ahead of the main party, waiting occasionally for the stragglers, he chivvies everyone along. The pass is cold, and he insists on walking through the night to get past it. Snow is threatening, after all. But as a reward, after only two days painful march, he flourishes. "Samaela's Camp. We have arrived." He turns to Ash. "And I am released?"

Ash shakes his head. "Not until we are assured of safety. You have kept your oath admirably, but I have no desire to be struck down within paces of our goal. By the same token, I will not betray you. For the duration of your oath, you are under our protection if anyone in the camp has a quarrel with you."

Three Toes raises an eyebrow. "This is Samaela's camp. If I enter, I risk certain death. I doubt that even the White Company could keep me alive then." He looks at the encampment ahead. "These are civilized lands. I promised to take you so far, and no further."

Tilara clears her throat. "He's concerned that you might revert to your old loyalties if he releases you from the oath without a safeguard. I think you're smarter than that, Three-toes."

"Then we will resolve the matter by sending an emissary," offers Ash. He turns, regarding Andreth. "Will you carry news to the camp, while we wait?"

Three Toes shrugs at Tilara. "I made the oath I made. It had limits I could accept. Its terms end here. It did not come with ..." His lips twist in a grimace. "... with safeguards." He turns at Ash's words, and watches Andreth walk to the camp.

Andreth returns after a time, Anstar by his side. He nods to his companions. "Anstar wanted ta come back wi' me," he explains.

Anstar grins, hugging Jellin, and Ellinor, and gravely shaking hands with Stormy.

Ash then turns to Three Toes, and speaks. His hand rests lightly on the hilt of his impressive weapon. "You are released. Go now, without animosity between us, but remember this. The enemies you fear in that camp are those you've made for yourself, and whatever is made can be unmade. Goodbye."

Tilara smiles at the cat. "Make wiser choices in the future, Three-toes."

Three Toes looks hungrily at Anstar for a moment, and then turns on his heel, heading off in a steady lope for the distant mountain pass.

Along with the rest of the Company, Ash waits warily for the big Changer to recede into the distance. Only then does he turn, leading the way toward the camp itself, and not sparing a backward glance.

The camp is arranged in a simple circular fashion. Eight or nine smaller tents, circling the largest one. Anstar is already busily dragging Stormy towards the biggest of the tents. He's full of tales of his mother, and the Tales she tells, and the things he's learned.

Inside the tent, Samaela sits on a low pallet of furs, Illanan behind her offering her support, and a soothing back rub. The tent is still warm, though the chill of winter adds a tangy scent to the air. Watching the White Company enter, she smiles. "I'm sorry I cannot rise. But ..." Her hand slides over her leg. "An unfortunate journey."

Tilara follows along, letting Mirra down to explore the camp now that their travels are finished. "What happened?"

Samaela smiles. "We found a new crevasse on the glacier, while we were hunting for the snowflowers that aid the bite of the cold winter air." She looks down at her leg. "It will heal, but I'm on bed rest for a while."

Starguard says, "May I aid you, Samaela? The Star's given me strong healing powers."

Samaela smiles. "The healing has been done. Now, the muscles just need to knit again. It will be fine. But thank you, Paladin, your offer is kindly made."

Illanan rises, welcoming both Jellin and Ellinor in a long hug, and then looking more closely at Ellinor's face. Within moments she, too, is seated, and hot tea is being brought for everyone.

Tilara gratefully accepts a cup. "Well... we were successful."

"You've brought our children back, and we thank you." Samaela smiles at everyone. Resting a hand on Ellinor's shoulder, she squeezes lightly. "You've brought our Ellinor back, and I think I'm going to be a grandmother before I ever give birth." As Jellin and Ellinor relax, Samaela looks curious. "Where will you go now? Or will you winter with us?"

Andreth nods gravely. "We all found many things on this journey," he says softly. "Some of 'em we wish we hadn't found, but others..." A warm smile crosses his scarred face as he nods in Ellinor's direction.

"We've got horses and things to retrieve still," responds Ash. "As to wintering here or leaving, I think it'd be best if we spent that errand considering that matter."

Tilara nods. "I think it would be interesting, myself. But perhaps we should check in with the Abbott first."

Blinking a little, Illanan looks curious. "Did you leave them with the Old Talespinner? We'll be bringing her her winter supplies in a week or two." Jellin blinks, looking over her shoulder at Illanan, who smiles back enigmatically.

Tilara hmms. "Well, maybe we should just go along then. We're not in that much of a rush."

Starguard says, "We could go with them, yes. A quiet trip would be a nice change."

Tilara chuckles. "It certainly would. I wouldn't count on it, though."

Illanan chuckles. "With Samaela along? It will be ever so quiet ..."

Tilara sighs. "Don't be overconfident, Illanan. We had .... some problems with a few Cat Changers on the trip up to the Shrine. I'd keep an eye open for them even here if I were you."

Illanan nods. "Sure. But we're going in a large enough group ..." He waves at the tents. "After we visit her mother, we're going to move the encampment further south for the winter."

Samaela smiles. "Of course, you're welcome to join us. Why decide so early?"

Tilara says, "_I_ think it sounds like a great idea. I could use a quiet season. As long as there's no urgent need for us back in Citadel..."

Ash thinks for a few moments, and listens, and finally speaks up. "What is the extent of your connections with our emperor?" he asks.

Samaela shakes her head. "With the exception of his emissary, Keorn? None. Directly." Illanan nods, and hugs his wife. "That would have been an awkward wedding ... promising yourself to the Emperor's man, love."

Ash continues his thought. "The Changers are ill-understood among the people we know. Escorting one or more representatives back, either during or after winter, would give us a chance to rest in the places we call home, and remove whatever fears or doubts may linger about your people among ours."

The White Company looks at each other. They in turn look at Samaela and Illanan, and a short discussion ensues. At length it's decided: retrieve the horses, rest for the winter, receive training in the arcane arts and myriad fighting styles of a people born into conflict, and perhaps learn true cooperation with each other. And if the White Company can tame even the clans of the Changers in their association with the Flatlands, muses Ash on his way into the arms of sleep, what of the fissures of faithlessness that stir fitfully in the politics of the Flatlands themselves?
