# Birthright 2004-05-28-ooc

BirthGM says, "I hereby declare the discussion open. There's some correspondence posted. Ash has been doing some questioning of his own."

Zinzer says, "Guess that answers the question."

Andreth says, "'IC'. Note the title is Talk, not just BR."

BirthGM says, "The GM would basically like to know what the company would like to do ater a winter spent with the Changers."

Zinzer says, "Based on your letters, I'd guess that those are supposed to provide some leads for us to choose from."

Andreth heehees. Poor Yuri.

BirthGM says, "Yes, plus I will willingly answer any questions you have."

Ash says, "Questions first, then game direction?"

Zinzer says, "Oh, good. How about 'What the hell is going on?'"

Zinzer says, "Or would that be telling? ;)"

Andreth says, "Well, the letters in the Correspondence section say what's been going on in the world. Lurin's Gone Home on the news of the latest prince's birth, for example."

BirthGM \[to Zinzer\]: "I'm sorry; I can't tell you that."

Zinzer shoots his joke in the head to put it out of its misery.

Tilara says, "Sulking all the way. What's this about the other one? Sounds like he's fixing to turn himself into a lich."

Zinzer says, "Personally, I think any of these are interesting, but I think dealing with Lurin may be the most 'important', in terms of averting war."

Tilara says, "That and/or the feather-folk."

Zinzer says, "Yes... I wonder, with the brass man gone, will they still be able to conduct their war of subterfuge?"

Andreth says, "Working on the feather-folk may be a thread (textile analogies are _very_ appropriate here) to unraveling the whole garment."

Zinzer says, "And I think we should follow up on the school. For the piggie's sake."

Zinzer says, "I think no matter what thread we pull we're going to end up with the same skein."

Tilara nods. "Definitely have to check on the piggies."

Andreth says, "The loss of Achmadina and the Brass Man removes _one_ tentacle of their conspiracy, not the whole thing."

Tilara says, "Were they even part of it? I thought they might have been independent."

Andreth nods. "We've made a promise, and the one thing that characterizes the White Company, more even than do-gooding, is keeping promises."

Zinzer says, "Right, but what if the brass man was essential to their ability to teleport?"

Zinzer says, "There was some small indication that was based on fire-magic. And he basically WAS fire-magic incarnate."

Tilara says, "Then we've crippled them. I wouldn't count on that being the case, though. There's more fire-folk than in the City of Brass."

Andreth says, "If you read some of the background section on feathers from a couple years ago, it turns out that feathers (and butterflies, and other objects of that sort) have long been associated with communications between the upper world and the underworld."

Zinzer says, "On the other hand, considering how close we came to incineration last time, maybe it's better to let sleeping djinn lie."

Andreth says, "So I don't think that the feathers are dependent on the Brass Men."

Zinzer says, "Well. Dealing with the immediate. It seems clear that we'll be coming down out of the hinterlands, which means we'll be checking out Changer's Bane regardless."

Zinzer says, "From there, we could go several places. If we're going to Lurinor, we'll be going through Woolwich and Citadel anyway."

Zinzer says, "If we're going to go north, we'll probably be striking out overland from there."

BirthGM says, "Why would you have to go through CB? You bypassed the place last time ..."

Andreth says, "If we're at any point going to take the Woolwich/Citadel route, I want to visit Thorpenhow. Find out how the truce with the foramen is going, and see if the dead are any more restless than they were when we passed through."

Zinzer says, "Who was the missing prince?"

Zinzer says, "The one who didn't show for the birth of the new prince? And what was his territory called?"

Andreth says, "Prince Cel, ruler of Celais."

Tilara says, "Cel. "

Andreth says, "Oh, Ash, the image link in the Maps section isn't working."

Andreth says, "It appears that 'mode=image' in the query string is a problem."

Zinzer says, "His capital is south of Citadel..."

Zinzer says, "So we'd have to go that way to check up on him."

BirthGM says, "Try clicking on the image?"

Zinzer says, "I think we have two broad options - pick a southern objective, which will probably mean going to or through the Citadel, or a nothern objective (eg, we want to check out the melting glaciers)... you know, the glaciers aren't so interesting to me, unless it's being caused by fire elementals, in which case it's very interesting to me and I still don't want to go there."

Andreth says, "Yes, that works. It's just the inline image that doesn't work."

Zinzer blathers endlessly, don't mind me.

Andreth says, "anyway. now I know where Celais is (although it's labeled Celae on the map)."

BirthGM says, "Celais is a typoe. Should be Celae. Thanks for catching that."

BirthGM fixes.

Zinzer says, "I guess another northern objective would be to see what Berina is up to in Agla's Harbor, except that if she's been working with Jane, then Woolwich would be a better first stop, yes?"

BirthGM looks curious. "You know, I think ... it might be worthwhile mapping out general kinds of objectives, and then asking questions. Ash, for instance, spent some time questioning me earlier today."

Ash will summarize those now, if anyone wants.

Andreth says, "We've done a lot of brainstorming so far... it'd be good to pull things together a bit."

Zinzer says, "Yes, please do, Ash."

Ash says, "Politics: All the princes, excepting Aiscalion, have been unhappy to an extent about the birth. Lurin is apparently the noisiest. Fallon and the prairie kingdoms have been quiet. Some of the guilds are pissed."

Zinzer nods...

Ash says, "Lurin: has been stockpiling supplies upon his father's re-marriage and is apparently living off those for now. No estimates on how long he can remain isolated, though he is at least not economically self-sufficient in the long term. He lacks (apparently) the population and manpower to force the issue militarily. He apparently has a large number of personal descendants as well."

Ash says, "He can also deal directly with the Changers and Stormwinders (as directly as geographically possible)."

Ash says, "The Emperor: is happy with the kingdoms as they stand."

Tilara says, "Why would the Guilds be upset?"

Ash says, "Profits of military supplies are down, now that lurin's turtling up."

Ash says, "The Changers: are not (publically) planning any sort of foray en masse into the Flatlands. You'll note that some have hired out as sellswords in those lands before; the extent to which any Changer clans are in the Flatlands is something they are unwilling to discuss."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "I mentioned ways to find out about Citadel's popular opinion about the new birth, but never heard an answer on what the people actually think (beyond the princes and the guilds). It may not be relevant."

Zinzer says, "In general, the public goes ga-ga over babies and other small animals?"

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "The public is divided. The birth f the little prince has meant a great deal of feasting. Paid for by taxes. So some up, some down. Some forecast war. Others forecast assassinations. Others think the little prince will get Celae, consider Celish is dead."

Ash says, "Okay."

Zinzer says, "What do you make of the potential objectives regarding the restless dead or the melting glaciers? Where do you see them fitting into this?"

Ash \[to Zinzer\]: "you asking the universe at large?"

Zinzer says, "I'm asking you since you've done the most thinking about this so far."

Ash says, "So far we've seen very little on the 'restless dead' issue. We have a necromancer who had a few ghasts, and got lightning up the tailpipe for his trouble. we have barrows we shook down. The Big Guy himself seemed pretty relaxed when we visited him in the afterlife."

Tilara says, "Heh. True..."

Ash says, "or are you talking about Cel specifically?"

Zinzer says, "Hey, I don't remember a necromancer."

Ash says, "That guy? Who we used the scroll of lightning on?"

Zinzer looks blank.... "OH."

Zinzer says, "THAT guy."

Zinzer . o O ( Dawn breaks over Marblehead. )

Zinzer says, "Since he didn't have relatives that came chasing after us to exact vengence I sort of forgot about him."

Andreth says, "Don't forget the barrows near Githa and Thorpenhow. They were pretty quiet except for when we actually opened them up, but the abbot at Waters sounded awfully worried when we brought up the subject."

Zinzer says, "So you don't really think those things are so important... then it seems we're looking at objectives in the political arena."

Ash says, "well, sort of. I think we lack any solid information on either front."

Zinzer says, "You know, I'm kind of in favor of recapitulating our trip to Citadel via the same route. See how things have gone this past year. Kick some asses where need be, remind everyone to behave themselves."

Ash says, "The only possible connection with existing business I can make is that fire melts ice real well. But that's tenuous at best."

Zinzer says, "If our objectives are political, Citadel is the natural target."

Ash says, "Citadel is also where we can find the best news of the restless drowning dead. So it's a logical destination anyway."

Zinzer . o O ( It has often been said that all roads lead to Citadel. This is incorrect. All roads lead away from Citadel, but people often walk down them the wrong way. )

Ash will break down what he sees as the major possible objectives:

Ash says, "Outland stuff (flooding, restless dead). Political stuff (Berina's school, new kid, Lurin, Cel). Social stuff (the road to Citadel, as mentioned, Woolwich, Thorpenhow, etc.)"

Ash says, "if I missed some major points, please mention them now."

Zinzer says, "Well, homesteading by the fort, but that sort of goes with the road to Citadel, I think."

Ash says, "Right."

Ash waits for a few to see if he missed any, before proceeding?

Andreth says, "Looks good to me."

Zinzer notes the silence.

BirthGM offers no comments? :)

Ash says, "Alright. on the restless-dead issue, part of my problem in planning is that I DO NOT KNOW enough about death and the dead, and how necromancy works, in this setting. I'll point out that the party has one priest and practicing theologian, and at least two skilled and seasoned arcanists, as well as the Brotherhood (who provably understand enough about death to cure it), and ask the GM some questions."

BirthGM will answer questions, including ones you put in their mouth, Ash. :)

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "What is the general mechanism for ghosts and the dead coming back? is it a magic aberration, the work of one or more gods, the combination of both together, or either-or?"

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "Sorry; worst possible scenario. Either or. But lemme elaborate."

Andreth grins.

Zinzer . o O ( Silence, Pharoah speaks. )

BirthGM says, "Sometimes, the spirits become ... become lost, enroute to the underworld. And then they remain topside. Either inside their bodies, as zombies, or without bodies, as ghosts."

BirthGM says, "Sometmes, one or more gods bars them rom the underworld. Same effect."

BirthGM says, "Sometimes, a mage - if powerful enough - can summon a spirit from Ungfallen's Hall. He risks Ungfallen's wrath when he does so, but some are more foolish than others ..."

Zinzer says, "So that's what happens when the soul is involved... does it ever happen that someone reanimates a zombie without the soul involved?"

BirthGM shakes her head.

BirthGM says, "No. If the soul is (somehow) destroyed, then the spirit is gone forever. Now ... a zombie can only be animated by its original soul. Other, stronger undead can be animated by any convenient soul."

Zinzer nods.

Ash says, "more, or should I go ahead?"

Zinzer says, "So either you'd have to have a lot of cursed persons that never made it to the Underworld, or a mage sufficiently powerful enough to pull souls out of the Underworld en masse without getting bitch-slapped into next century by Ungfallen."

Zinzer says, "That second case sounds unlikely. I'm thinking, lots of cursed people."

Zinzer says, "I think we can go ahead."

BirthGM says, "Go ahead."

BirthGM says, "Hang on."

BirthGM says, "Remember those comments about a >great< many dead? Some of those spirits from the Great War still roam. Quite a few of them, apparently."

BirthGM is done now.

Zinzer says, "Well, we knew about those. Those are solidly in the 'never made it' category."

BirthGM nods. "exactly."

Andreth nods. "Let's say x% of souls become lost. The sheer _number_ of people who died in the Great War means that that x% comes to a high absolute number of lost souls."

Ash says, "That's what I was going to ask. Ungfallen can obviously police his realm pretty well, which mostly leaves the spirits of the dead who are lost. Are there mortal rituals that don't require the use of actual magic spells to put such spirits to rest - i.e. do you need to be a cleric to act as a psychopomp, or can any schmuck do it?"

BirthGM says, "Controlling those is a lot easier than controlling people who've already made it."

BirthGM says, "Think of it as the difference between kidnapping a runaway, and a kid in a small connected village. :)"

BirthGM says, "And any schmuck can do it. >If< they know the Way."

Ash says, "Can you elaborate?"

Andreth says, "Also. In other traditions, dying violently makes it more likely that your soul will be restless - is that true in this setting? If so, then the war dead are already inherently more likely to lose their way."

BirthGM nods at Andreth. "Yes. Dying at a time you're not ready makes you more restless."

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "The poblem lies in the very fact that there are many Ways to reach the hall, but only one Way will suit any one spirit. The Ways are usually anchored by the spirit's totem, which in turn forms a bridge between her and the gods ..."

BirthGM afks for a tick.

BirthGM returns.

BirthGM says, "So the trick is to know the appropriate way for the spirit - both to know its totem and to know that Way."

Tilara says, "So the totem controls it, eh? Another reason to want to know them..."

Zinzer says, "That's assuming we want to pursue that objective..."

BirthGM nods.

Zinzer says, "Are there any other mass grave sites similar to the barrows near Thorpnehow?"

BirthGM says, "Except, Til, that most people believe Totems is utter bunkum."

Zinzer typo.

BirthGM \[to Zinzer\]: "Sure. All over the place. Especially in Lurinor, which bore the brunt of the invasion."

Ash says, "The Changers obviously have some knowledge of such things. Do they have enough knowledge to be a benefit to the Flatlands in this regard?"

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "The Changers recognize four totems. Elk, Hawk, Wolf, and Cat. Those who are born with a different totem are considered ... flawed. Incomplete. They don't recognize the existence of other totems."

BirthGM . o O ( Some individual Changers do, but they are exceptions. )

Ash says, "Okay."

Zinzer says, "Lurinor. It figures."

BirthGM \[to Zinzer\]: "Yes. That's why you started in Aglamar. :)"

Ash says, "Do the Changers at least have enough reliable evidence of the power of totems to make Flatlander arcanists believe in the general idea? Enough to get a populace to buy into it?"

Zinzer says, "I wonder if there are similar places in the Changer lands. Probably fewer, since they weren't the places where the fighting happened."

Tilara says, "The arcanists aren't the problem. The rank and file are."

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "Changers believe that they can change shap because of their totem."

Ash says, "okay."

BirthGM . o O ( So any Changer has a totem. Anyone else is a freak ... ^\_^ )

Ash says, "I'd be interested to interview a priest of Ungfallen on this matter. It seems like such a person would have a better understanding of death than anybody."

BirthGM \[to Zinzer\]: "Nope. None, near as you know. You want to look in the Stormwind lands. But .. there are no specific stormwind lands. All the fighting happened in the flatlands ..."

BirthGM nods at Ash. Or Limera. Or Merial. Those are his sister wife, and his sister, after all ...

BirthGM says, "The changers have no priests, however."

BirthGM says, "The brothers primarily follow Agla."

Ash says, "Yeah. So one wonders why these things aren't more wide-spread. I mean, you would think that after the great war, those clerics would be first in line to be screaming for people to understand the importance of totems in laying to rest the uneasy dead."

Ash says, "Sure, both surviving clerics, but even so."

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "The Stormwinds were fighting with a numerical disadvantage. The first ones they took out were the clericcs, as mucha s possible."

BirthGM . o O ( Escpecially those clerics who could reason with the dead. )

Zinzer says, "I vote that any inquiries of that nature be done by Andreth. On account of him already having been dead once."

BirthGM . o O ( After all, how many times do >you< want to have to kill your opponent? )

Andreth says, "Oh, so just cause I've died, that makes me an expert? ^\_^"

Ash says, "Alright. So I think we have enough to plan for any restless-dead-related business."

BirthGM \[to Andreth\]: "And been slapped by Merial. Don't forget the slap."

BirthGM makes the scar itch ...

Zinzer \[to Andreth\]: "Let's say that you have a unique perspective on the matter that the rest of us don't really want to obtain."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "what do people use for communication? Pony express?"

Andreth says, "I'm just being facetious. Of course Andreth would have an interest in helping the unquiet dead find peace."

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "Generally? Letters sent by caravan. Messenger. Ravens. Pigeons. Feathers. Scrying stones."

BirthGM offers to briefly kill Zinny?

Ash says, "feathers and scrying stones aren't in common use, though?"

BirthGM won't take but a moment?

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "Among the rank and file, no. But the rank and file never leave their home village, and have no need to send messages."

Andreth says, "Game mechanics are a problem here, though. Unless he's going to act as a facilitator, this sort of job sounds like one thatd' require quite a few ranks in Knowledge-REligion, which is a cross-class skill for a character that only gets 4 points/level anyway."

BirthGM almost forgot. The guilds. The guilds will send messages for their memebers from chapter house to chapter house.

BirthGM \[to Andreth\]: "I'm willing to waive the cross class skill on that one specific field, considering the circumstances."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "Okay. It seems like the wide distribution of knowledge will require that even small villages send and receive messages. Such as occult knowledge for putting the dead to rest."

Andreth hms.

Andreth says, "hang on a moment, lemme check something."

BirthGM nods. "Yes. It would require the kind of system that at present does not exist." \[to Ash\]

BirthGM cues Yuri to jump in with this brilliant idea for a business venture.

Ash says, "Are we to the point, technologically, where a heliograph or sun-station (build a tower, build a mirror, write a code-book, hire a schmuck to sit there) is feasible?"

BirthGM says, "Technologically, yes. Manpower might be a problem."

BirthGM . o O ( Tormel could invent it. If he hasn't, already. )

Zinzer says, "Yuri would be all over that."

Zinzer says, "But I think heliographs would be... I dunno. Mythologically disruptive."

BirthGM nudges Yuri. "You've told the GM all about this business idea. Now tell >them<."

Zinzer says, "I'm not Yuri. Who is this Yuri of which you speak? c\_c;"

Ash \[to Zinzer\]: "the GM has also made it plain she favors a realistic game to some extent. Common sense and scientific progress is realistic, IMO."

Andreth says, "Okay. In the book, monks get knowledge(arcana) as a class skill. I never understood that..."

Zinzer nods...

Tilara says, "What's unrealistic is applying -our- arcane knowledge to an environment where the PC's wouldn't have the background to figure it out."

Zinzer says, "Well, something like the Discworld's 'clacks' system isn't out of the question."

BirthGM \[to Andreth\]: "So rewrite it as knowledge religion in your case. I can live with that."

Ash says, "If there's some compelling reason such a system wouldn't come into play, I won't insist. But in the absence of such a thing, if it's needed and society can do it, why not?"

Zinzer says, "Even if it's not automatic, just having guys on signal towers is a really simple thing. And Yuri and Tormel can work out ciphers and coding schemes to make sure the message is transmitted intact, and make efficient use of the manpower."

Ash \[to Tilara\]: "I'm not suggesting the party or its immediate allies be responsible for such a thing. I DO advocate us going to the emperor and the brotherhood and saying: You know all that knowledge you guys are sitting on? And some of the stuff the Changers know? we need to get that out, to everyone, and we need ways to coordinate a lot of people across distance."

Ash \[to Tilara\]: "and at that point the geniuses like Tormel step in and invent."

Andreth nods. "I think in the original system, the monks' abilities are arcane in nature; but since we've already established that the Way of the Oak is based on the _goddess_ Oak, perhaps we should shift that to being a divine monk rather than an arcane monk."

BirthGM notes that simple signaling based on lights is already used by the armies, occasionally.

Zinzer says, "There's also the potential for shoring up the banking system that way, enabling commodities trading and the like."

BirthGM nodnods at Andreth. Thank you for finding a reason. :)

Ash says, "Alright. So far most of what we've heard necessitates going to Citadel either way, if not necessarily as a final stop. Any dissent on that score?"

Andreth says, "Nope."

Zinzer says, "I concur."

BirthGM abstains!

Ash says, "that leaves the route there to be decided. I have no objection visiting Woolwich, Thorpenhow, etc. along the way. Do we want to retrace our earlier path, or vary?"

BirthGM points at the number of major roads on the map.

BirthGM . o O ( I.e. 1, if you go through Changer's Bane. )

Andreth hms. totally unrelated to Birthright as such... does anyone know if knowledge(arcane) ever provides _any_ mechanical benefit that enhances a monk in any way? As opposed to standing by itself... I mean, there's nothing in the PHB.

Tilara says, "Heh. I was going to say. A fairly -small- number..."

Ash \[to Andreth\]: "it does not. it's just what it is."

Andreth okays.

Zinzer says, "We went this way before mostly because there was only one major road. It didn't really branch; our only alterntive that even came close to regular transport was the over-water route."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "by 'retrace' I mean go to Woolwich, go visit the foramen, check the barrows, all the small stops."

Ash says, "well, not ALL of them. But the ones of any significance."

BirthGM nods at Ash. "Works for me. I'll have to ind the old notes and reread the logs, but ..."

Zinzer says, "As I've mentioned, I'm partial to the retrace idea. We can decide where to meddle on the way. I'd like to pass through Changer's Bane on the way there."

Ash says, "Changers Bane, and then the old route, sounds fine with me."

Zinzer says, "Maybe persuade them to change the name to 'Changer's Gate' or something, just to be politically correct about it."

BirthGM has one minor suggestion to the world at large.

Ash says, "?"

Start writing letters to Yuri?

Ash says, "Sure."

BirthGM says, "He shouldn't be getting his info about the party from Tormel."

BirthGM giggles.

Tilara says, "Now that we -can-."

BirthGM says, "Right now you can. Hawks will deliver. This will change, once more, once you hit the road."

Ash says, "Alright. I also floated the idea of a Changer emissary coming to court, with us or separately. GM, is that already in the pipeline or not? And if not, players, are you averse to escorting him/her?"

BirthGM says, "Well, Keorn has headed back to court, but if you suggest another one to Samaela, she'll take you up on the offer. Keorn is a Changer, yet none o the Changers >knew< him. He was raised in Fallon."

Tilara says, "I assumed we -would- escort an emissary."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "Right, another one would be a good idea. Someone who the Changers will trust the word of implicitly."

BirthGM grins. "Sure. No problem. One of the Children, perhaps?"

BirthGM says, "The adlt one?"

BirthGM says, "Adult one?"

Ash says, "hahahaha. Will Samaela permit that?"

Zinzer says, "I'm in favor of the Changers establishing a full diplomatic mission. Whatever that might mean."

Andreth says, "Arguably, Keorn is the Emperor's emissary to the Changers. A valuable role in itself, but which does not obviate the usefulness of the opposite role."

Zinzer says, "After all, how can you feed your opponents misinformation if you don't let them spy on you?"

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "Moral suasion alone. That's all she has. Which is a very powerful weapon, but does not permit her to limit the actions of her Children illogically. So if he wants to go, he will ... But ... likely, she'd prefer someone else."

Ash says, "I'll defer to whoever she suggests, and then go ask that guy."

BirthGM nods. "She suggests ... an elk. Actually, a mated pair. Her and him. Her as the emissary, him as the messenger. He's a hawk."

Andreth says, "We're not trying to pick the White Company's Changer emissary to the Emperor, we're suggesting that the Changers _have_ an emissary. :) The Changers' opinion should be the _starting_ point. n.n"

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "Good enough, we'll go ask them."

Ash \[to Andreth\]: "Correct."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "and if they don't want to go, well, we'll ask them who THEY recommend. And so forth."

BirthGM notes that having a hawk as an emissary would be impolitic, considering the Empress's facial scars. A cat would be dangerous, considering their actions of late. And a wolf ... well .. Keorn?

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "They agree."

Ash says, "Alrighty."

Zinzer says, "They'll send an Elk?"

BirthGM handwaves all this, since it would all have happened over the winter anyways?

Tilara says, "So, an elk. With a hawk as messenger."

Zinzer says, "Yeah, we'd have two months of impassible roads to figure out the details."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "so assuming there's no dissent, and assuming Will isn't violently against the suggestion, we'll be going through Changers Soontoberenamedwehope, escorting two people, and retrace our route to Citadel."

Zinzer says, "All opposed?"

Zinzer gets the Voter-B-Good stick to encourage accord.

Tilara says, "I'm cool with that. A layover in Woolwich, I assume?"

BirthGM nods ...

Ash says, "Sure. Not TOO long, but sure"

BirthGM . o O ( Too long could be unhealthy. Berina's been visiting there. A lot. )

Tilara says, "Just long enough to say hi to family and old friends."

Zinzer says, "Well, Berina is a danger, but... if she's going to be a danger to us, it will be regardless of physical proximity."

BirthGM chuckles.

Andreth nods. "We _might_ want to take the time to expand on what Father Pesci had to say in his letter to Starguard, about Berina... but if we poke too deeply, word of it will get back to her."

BirthGM digs ot the notes on Ferg.

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "Along the way, I would like to have the Brotherhood, or Yuri, or Tormel, or SOMEBODY, draft a letter that we can leave with the mayors or authorities of the villages we pass through, saying, 'we need you to understand and study the teachings of the totems, this knowledge may be vital soon. consult a Cleric of These Gods. this message with the blessing of the Emperor, Glia-Gulmeshki' - And obviously get the Emperor's actual blessing. Then we distribute copies as we go."

BirthGM nods. "Yuri should be able to help with that. Especially since the cleric you want will most likely be found in Citadel ..."

Zinzer says, "I wonder. Can we get that done in the two months before we head out? Exchange enough letters and messages via hawk and crystal ball to get it worked out?"

BirthGM . o O ( It's a 3 month winter. Yes. )

BirthGM decides not to make it a canadian winter.

Ash says, "okay. Guys, do we have a consensus on action?"

Andreth nods. "I believe we do."

Tilara says, "Looks like it. Once we get back to Citadel, we can branch off in whatever direction seems appropriate."

BirthGM . o O ( That was fast ... )

Tilara grins. "We're efficient when we want to be."

Ash says, "Along the way we'll also want to gather whatever knowledge we can about the princes, flooding, and so forth. That'll need to be assumed, I trust you can make Gather Information rolls (or call for them) periodically from us :)"

BirthGM nods.

BirthGM will make them in advance, and post updates on the websites?

Ash says, "That'd be great."

Zinzer says, "Also, as I said, all roads lead to Citadel. Literally, and in this case, figuratively."

BirthGM says, "Anybody want to volunteer to drat the letters?"

BirthGM pokes at her keyboard. The f key is ... picky.

Ash says, "If nobody else does, I'll handle it. Give me a list of what needs written (above and beyond a request for the restless-dead letter, the request for a heliograph/faster system, and the announcement of an emissary)"

BirthGM hmmms. "The precis you had so far seems suficient. You may wish to throw in a quickie explanation of totems - the bridge between the spirit and the god - and the mention of totem quests ..."

Ash says, "Sure."

BirthGM says, "You may also choose to include a description of the underworld per se."

BirthGM says, "Most people figure when they die, they're dead. :)"

Zinzer says, "I wonder how much it costs to build a really tall tower. Thorpenhow seems like a good place to make a switching center."

Ash says, "GREETINGS FROM HELL, WISH YOU WERE HERE"

BirthGM \[to Zinzer\]: "I think the costs are in the DMG. Feel free to look."

Zinzer says, "Some people might find it more comforting. Having direct credible nearly documentary evidence of what happens when you die kind of removes potential for certain kinds of hope."

Zinzer says, "I'll need to pick up a DMG. 9\_9"

BirthGM \[to Zinzer\]: "Or to put it differently, considering the White Company's penchant for giving away its profits, you'd have to float an IPO."

Zinzer ponders a trip to Great Escape Games this weekend.

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "On that note, there's a thing called the Lyre of Building or somesuch. It's a 15k gp investment. It drastically simplifies the creation of large structures. If we can get that sort of thing, we're in good shape."

Ash \[to Zinzer\]: "I have a spare DMG, which you can have for the cost of shipping, if you are willing to be patient to get it"

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "That would be a whole nother quest. They don't have any. You'd need to find the plans, the material, and the mage ... :)"

BirthGM \[to Zinzer\]: "And beore you agree, someone should confirm that on costs. I'm working strictly on memory. May be second ed had the costs."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "well sure. But I think some of that is simplified by a document reading 'give these guys whatever materials and assistants they require in my name - G.Gul.'"

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "if we can convince the emperor of the need for such a system, we've taken a big step forward in it."

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "Yes. But then you'll have to convince him. He's not exactly a rich man."

BirthGM afks again. Back in sec.

Ash says, "That's fine. I can name any ten ways that such a system would be a general benefit and money-maker anyway :) It could pay for itself fairly soon."

Zinzer \[to Ash\]: "The Emperor's credibility (and credit rating) can only go so far."

Zinzer \[to Ash\]: "A big problem for him is having enough subjects working, building, and being taxable to keep the Empire solvent."

Ash says, "Right. You guys have interest in hearing the economic case here?"

Zinzer \[to Ash\]: "But having an actual commodities trade - even a slow one - would, indeed, pay for itself, especially if it's an Imperially-sponsored institution."

Zinzer \[to Ash\]: "I'd like to hear other arguments. I'm just saying, the Emperor can't miracle the funds up."

Ash says, "I understand that."

Ash says, "Alright. Lyre of building. 13000 gp. Requires a 6th-level caster with fabricate to create, which is not the hardest requirement in the world to meet. 30 minutes of playing it = 300 man-days of work on some construction effort. it does NOT supply raw materials."

Zinzer says, "Holy Crow."

Zinzer says, "Even if you could only play it 30 minutes a day - in a week you could build any number of things."

Zinzer says, "It doesn't take 300 man-days to build a HOUSE, given the raw materials."

Ash says, "One tower (3-levels, stone) is 50,000 gp (DMG, p. 151). How fast can you build a 3-story tower out of stone?"

Zinzer hmms.

Ash says, "My guess is you can spend one bard-day per tower, tops, assuming you have the raw materials available. This requires a lot of stone, and quick transportation between cities, which I'll cover in a moment."

BirthGM says, "About ... About 3 months to 2 years depending on the design and the workforce."

Zinzer says, "Hard to say... I'd guess, a dozen men could do it in... a month? Two months?"

BirthGM says, "300 man days is a lot, until you realize for a crew of thirty men, that's only 10 days work."

BirthGM \[to Zinzer\]: "Based on experience in England? A crew of 60, about two months."

Ash says, "so 3600 man-days? No problem, that's a 12-hour day of strumming."

Zinzer \[to Ash\]: "How long can you play for a day?"

BirthGM says, "What kind o musical skills should the player have?"

Zinzer says, "And we'd need a Bard... um. Yuri's a bard. c\_c Sort of."

Ash says, "you make a DC 18 perform check to keep playing the lyre. A skilled bard can take 10 all day, since this is not tremendously stressful."

Tilara says, "There's a limit to how long you can play."

Ash says, "No, there's a limit how long you canplay without a Perform check, which is not the same thing."

BirthGM would start requiring con checks after the 6th hour. Still. That's also a lot of raw materials. Those will become the bottleneck.

Zinzer says, "Even so. At an hour a day, you could raise it in a week, assuming you had a pile of loose stones of approximately the right shape, maybe some cut logs, and some ironmongery."

Andreth says, "Even if you stop playing when you start to get tired, you've still reduced the manpower cost from 60 men and two months to one man and two days."

Ash says, "So let's say the guy spends 2 days of 6 hours apiece strumming. Even a 4th-level bard can sustain that. Now you have a tower in 2 days. The design is always the same - the major variation you'll need is in the foundation, which only adds a short amount of overhead."

BirthGM nods.

BirthGM says, "Bottleneck becomes the raw materials. What kind of shape do they need to be in?"

Andreth says, "And for that matter, the cost of transporting the raw materials."

Ash says, "Sure, I'll handle raw materials now."

Zinzer listens.

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "If your 60-men 2-months time frame starts from unworked stone instead of conveniently rectangular slabs stacked in a pile, then all you need is a big supply of stone chunks of approximately the right size. That means a ton of effort mining."

Zinzer gets out the Map of Really High Places.

Ash says, "there may be another magic item to help with that; if so, I don't know it off the top of my head, but it's worth researching"

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "It generally meant roughly shaped raw materials, but no more than that ..."

Ash says, "here we go. stone shape. Clr 3, 10 cu ft. + 1/level. So 15 cubic feet per casting."

Zinzer says, "Are there any mythological stories about great builders? Surely Jurdah didn't have to cut all the stones himself with a dull iron axe."

BirthGM says, "Jurdah ... used magic. He >was< the great Builder."

Ash says, "Volume of the tower approximates a cylinder 30 feet high, radius about what, 10-15 feet? If it's a cone, even an approximation is good enough."

Zinzer says, "Right. So he'd know."

Zinzer says, "And we've met him. We think."

BirthGM blinks. "You have? When?"

Zinzer says, "Radius of even five feet would be plenty, this is for a signal tower. But then, you can't do 30 feet high and five feet wide."

Zinzer says, "That's not a signal tower, that's a missle silo."

Andreth says, "We've met _someone_. Some guy in a tower in the Underworld. I still am curious who he was, and I certainly wouldn't leap to the conclusion that he was Jurdah. n.n"

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "the old guy after we went through the labyrinth and descended through the spider nest?"

Zinzer says, "You know... if all we want to do is get it in the air, we could do signal towers out of wooden trestles."

Ash says, "I have no idea who he was, but anyway. :)"

Zinzer says, "Old-fashioned Pioneering... did anyone get that merit badge?"

Andreth says, "And whoever he was, he was able to create a magical portal back to the upper world."

BirthGM . o O ( Oh. Right. Him. Forgot about him. )

Zinzer says, "The guy who never spoke, down in the labyrinth, Yuri left a seven-pointed star inscribed on his wall and surprised the shit out of everyone (most of all himself)."

BirthGM \[to Zinzer\]: "Leave room inside the tower for living quarters and stair cases. Winter is >cold<."

Ash \[to Zinzer\]: "Sure. I'm going 'worst-case' here. We'd build stone towers atop rocky mountains, and wood towers atop forested hills."

BirthGM . o O ( And for bonus points, keep an eye open for forest fires? )

Ash says, "sure, which is one more reason to favor stone."

Andreth heehees. Signalers _and_ forest rangers?

Ash says, "Alright. So, we can have a 5th-level cleric with enough spells crank out enough stone in 10 days, best guess, to build our tower."

Zinzer . o O ( The mighty Brontosaurus, keeping watch on the other dinosaurs with its long neck, staring out over the trees for forest fires... )

Ash says, "Cost to have those spells cast: about 3000 gp, at the going rate for magic use. Cost to raise the tower once we have sufficient stone: negligible."

BirthGM waits for the priceless line?

Ash says, "Value of demonstrating how useful magic is in making societal changes and advancing technology: priceless"

BirthGM chuckles.

Ash says, "We further have some schmuck with a really fast horse, the teleport spell, or SOMETHING, that will let our cleric/bard tag team get around rapidly. Cost to engage his services: probably 300 gp per trip. We'll pay our bard uh, 10 gp a day, so he gets 20 gp per tower. Not bad for sitting there building calluses and not doing much else."

Ash says, "so far so good?"

BirthGM nods. "So far."

Zinzer says, "You're talking about raising this whole thing completely overnight. At that rate we could have trunk lines to all the Imperial capitals and major settlements in under a year. o\_O"

Ash says, "Alright. Given that we are living in a place called the FLATLANDS, I don't think we're going to get much elevation advantage. So we have the horizon to contend with. GM, can I call us 5 miles to the horizon, on average?"

BirthGM nods. "On average, yes."

Ash says, "how far, typically, to the capital cities of the princedoms?"

BirthGM tries to remember what the alberta elevation is.

BirthGM says, "Make it 10 miles. And ... uh ..."

BirthGM says, "Right now, Ash, I don't know. My laptop is down. And it's the one with the maps on it."

Zinzer says, "On a terrestrial world, the curvature of the earth will prevent mutal line of sight at 23 miles for objects that are six feet tall."

Ash says, "No sweat. I'll see if I can find it online"

Andreth says, "Calais is gonna be a special case here. Towers perched on the Escarpment will command quite a view."

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "Basically, you can eyeball it? The towns along the route to Citadel were on average 2 days apart."

Ash \[to Zinzer\]: "is 23 miles enough to resolve a signal flash, though? Without telescopes?"

Zinzer says, "Hmmmmmm."

BirthGM doesn't think so. 10 miles will be a stretch ...

Andreth says, "Oh, speaking of the Escarpment, I've always wondered... what is the means by which people usually get up and down it? Are there stairs cut into the cliff?"

BirthGM says, "There's an elevator of sorts, right next to the waterfall. Beyond that, the whole point is that people generally >don't< go up or down. :)"

BirthGM . o O ( Traitors go down. Regularly. A simple push and wheeee! )

Zinzer says, "If we make the signal big enough, you could probably see it at 20 miles or more... but I take the point..."

Zinzer says, "Why don't we plan on ten miles."

Ash says, "a 30-foot tower above a mountain or hilltop? 10 miles is reasonable?"

BirthGM would plan on 5 miles. Redundant signals means the line doesn't go out if one tower does ...

Ash says, "Alright, 5 it is. I'm happier with that anyway."

Andreth nods to GM. "Funnily enough, I was just rereading The Fifth Elephant this evening."

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "10 miles is reasonable. Not sure about wise."

BirthGM grins at Andreth.

Zinzer says, "Well, you can build on the tens and then build towers halfway to improve reliability... but OK, yeah, every five miles as a goal."

Ash says, "it was 2 days from Cairnstoke to Citadel?"

BirthGM tries to remember how far the caravan traveled in a day?

Zinzer says, "That's every hour along a major road. How long did it take to travel to Citadel?"

Ash is assuming a caravan can top out at 20-30 miles a day.

Ash says, "30 mpd is generous, too."

Zinzer says, "It was one night's hard coach ride from Woolwich to Two Crossings."

Andreth says, "Actually, this is probably in the book..."

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "Assume 20. you guys were traveling slow. And ..."

BirthGM says, "Dammit, I really miss my laptop."

Zinzer says, "And I think it was nine times that distance to Citadel... so... 3-400 miles. c\_c;"

Zinzer says, "How many days did it take us? o\_O"

BirthGM \[to Zinzer\]: "See previous comment about laptop."

Ash says, "but 2 days' caravan time between towns and 20 mpd tells me what I needed - 8 towers between any two major towns, on average."

BirthGM says, "Cairnstoke was, I believe, only one day. But am not sure."

Zinzer says, "Does that seem like a lot?"

Ash says, "Well, something to remember here. The cost to CONSTRUCT a tower is strictly governed by how much the magician(s) involved will work for."

Andreth says, "Here we go. According to the PHB (p.143) A speed of 30 feet gives you 24 miles per day, and 40 feet, 32 miles per day."

BirthGM checks the ledger. Caravan was set up on day 29, and arrived in Citadel day 58

Ash says, "Those rates are based on the professional charge for casting a spell. If we can get the Brotherhood to volunteer a few guys, or the Emperor to give special authority for a select number of clerics and such, we can drive our construction costs down arbitrarily low."

BirthGM says, "But you had detours."

Andreth says, "The book assumes that you move at a walking pace for 8 hours a day (any longer invites Forced March constitution checks, so you wouldn't do that for a caravan)."

Tilara says, "Still need materials."

BirthGM points out that if you can somehow use scrying, you can build fewer towers ...

Ash \[to Tilara\]: "No, as pointed out, we have a cleric using stone shape and other magics to dredge up rocks."

Zinzer says, "So 3-400 miles seems about right. Remember we started further down the road than Woolwich, offset by the number of detours."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "I don't think we have any methods of scrying amenable to mass-production. Correct me if I'm wrong."

Zinzer says, "Zinzer should know that, he knows scrying."

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "You don't. Exactly. You have the crystal from the abbot, whichis insanely powerful ... in part because you can use it at any range. However, i you could make simple two way mirrors, say, with a limited range ..."

Zinzer says, "The mechanical accoutrements are simple - a bowl of water or a mirror or crystal will do, anything that bends light. But the skill to use it is harder to come by."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "Right. That's the sort of thing that is at the top of the towers :)"

BirthGM says, "The problem with building this many materials is not the construction at all. It's manning the towers."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "I'll cover that now then"

Zinzer says, "Maybe the shutters, painted black and white, WILL be the best option."

Andreth says, "GM has a point - one of the _biggest_ shortages in the Flatlands is people."

BirthGM nudges Zinzer. "Look for something similar to continual light? Something that would attune, say, two mirrors with one another, so that one would reflect what the other sees?"

BirthGM says, "Then if you could get the range to ... say ... 40 miles or so, you can station one in every village. Skip the lyre ..."

Ash says, "A typical Profession skill earns (half your check) in gold pieces per week. So we have a new skill, Prof: Heliograph Operator. The average 1st-level commoner will have a maximum of +3 in this skill. His work is worth 6.5 gp a week, or 338 gp/year. Say we have a regular rotation of 6 guys (3 duty shifts per day, with people alternating), that's about 2000 gp a year. That cost will dwarf the expense of building our network, so that's the one we need to address when we consider ROI."

Zinzer says, "I'm thinking that there's not enough benefit to these if they have to be within five or even ten miles of each other. Better to invent the optical telescope, or as the GM says, the short range 'remote control' continual light spell."

BirthGM notes this is the one difference between here and the Disc. Well, the one big difference. Severe shortage of manpower.

Zinzer says, "You wouldn't need to staff every tower 24/7. Ten hours a day, six days a week would be plenty. Not all trunks have to operate all the time."

BirthGM says, "Just like Europe, after a coupla Black Plagues ..."

Zinzer says, "Some stations may only relay at particular times a day, especially if there's not enough traffic to justify constant operation."

Zinzer says, "Like uunet."

Andreth says, "And we don't have gargoyles to pick up the slack."

Ash \[to Zinzer\]: "Sure. So we have one guy working 3 days of 10-hour shifts."

BirthGM \[to Zinzer\]: "Nobody's invented the reliable timepiece yet ..."

Zinzer says, "Doesn't matter, you just do offsets from dawn."

BirthGM says, "Do them >how Andreth says, "In that case, relay only on particular days of the week?"

Zinzer says, "'Be up the tower within a candlemark of sunrise. If we have messages for you, they'll have raised a flag at the next tower down the line. Raise yours when you are ready to receive.'"

BirthGM notes candle marks weren't reliable either ... :) But fair enough.

BirthGM says, "Better to ascend the tower at dawn. Then batch process the day's messages, and crash out again."

Ash says, "Sure, we can do 'zone mail hour' to cut down costs and manpower requirements."

Zinzer says, "Well, the point is, 'soon after dawn'. You make dawn the more-or-less universal clock synchronization and just tell people to be watching, say, from dawn until lunch or something."

BirthGM says, "How many kingdoms will you be extending the network to?"

Ash says, "If we do Zone Mail Hour, we also don't need dedicated operators. People from the local towns get paid to do the job, and receive training. They volunteer for 3 days of a few hours at a time, then go back home."

Zinzer says, "Surely you'd want to get all the capitals if you can."

Zinzer says, "So I'd say, go for all the Princes that agree to it."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "We'll extend to the capitals, from Citadel. After that, any prince who wants in on on the network more extensively can subsidize continued construction."

BirthGM nods. "Do it as a batch process at dawn, and local farmers can man many of the towers. After you teach them to read."

Zinzer says, "Yes, that whole 'literacy' thing was making me wonder."

Ash says, "We may not even need that much. The guys in the intermediate towers are NOT translating, just re-relaying."

Ash says, "Only the guys at our endpoints need to understand the messages."

BirthGM says, "They need to record the message before they can relay it ..."

Zinzer says, "If we can get it to the point where we only need one tower per 20 miles or so - one per town - then the odds of finding a literate person willing to do the work and not bag out when his cow has milk fever goes up."

BirthGM says, "Accurately."

Andreth says, "Even that, I think, is a step above total illiteracy."

BirthGM says, "Which is easier to do if you can read. :)"

Zinzer says, "Also, putting the tower in town means less odds someone will burn it down for kicks, or mug the attendant."

Ash says, "sure. As long as they have basic comprehension, and can count, they should be able to transcribe. And even a farmer can count :)"

Zinzer says, "I wonder if Yuri, Tormel, and Zinzer can concoct some error detection and correction codes. c\_c;"

BirthGM \[to Zinzer\]: "Can, yes. Would they? Don't know."

Ash says, "I'm sure they'd realize a need for it after a solid day of thinking throgh the problem."

Tormel shrugs. "The easiest way to avoid errors is to ritually disembowel those who make errors. Eventually the problem will correct itself.

Ash says, "So does that address the manpower issue?"

BirthGM grins. "Until Tormel spoke up? Yes."

Ash says, "we'll just push Tormel back into his box. c\_c"

Zinzer says, "I think this shows the Learned Man's own innumeracy. It would take a very long time to breed that out of your labor pool. It would be cheaper and faster just to send some people to school."

Zinzer says, "And... that means... more money for the tutors."

Ash says, "Alright. So these guys are getting a few gp a week, a few hundred gp a year, to man these towers. How do we recoup those costs? I have some ideas,but I'm sure everyone else does as well."

BirthGM rubs her hands together ...

BirthGM suggests that the White Company have a business plan ready, by the time they reach the Emperor.

Tilara says, "Telegrams."

Zinzer says, "Commodities."

Zinzer says, "Strategic dispatches."

Zinzer says, "SECURE strategic dispatches for the guilds."

Zinzer says, "Even medievel technology can develop practically unbreakable ciphers."

BirthGM says, "Including a description o how the men will be paid. If you're paying them all from Citadel, there's going to be a lot more gold traveling the roads than ever before. This could be ... dangerous."

BirthGM . o O ( To the gold, that is. )

Andreth says, "Well, basically what we've got here is that we can use magic and technology to cut down substantially on the startup cost. The fact that manpower is still a significant bottleneck does mean that the recurring costs are still relatively high."

Zinzer says, "Ah, now THIS is where it gets interesting."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "Citadel is paying Citadel's guys. The Princes are responsible for funding the guys in their territory, excepting the main trunks to the capital."

BirthGM . o O ( Yuri's been studying hard, has he? )

Andreth says, "But the money still has to go out _along_ the trunks, is what GM is saying."

BirthGM \[to Ash\]: "Many of the capitals are far from Citadel. "

Zinzer says, "The Templars, the Medicis, and the Fuggers all made their money by writing letters of credit. Buy a letter from them at one end, and they'll give you gold for it at the other."

Ash says, "Alright, you guys want payroll? I'll address that."

Ash says, "How often do these guys need to get paid? Weekly? Monthly? Daily?"

Zinzer says, "Minus a small fee."

Zinzer says, "If you establish the 'wire transfer service', you get to keep the wire fee."

BirthGM says, "Probably weekly or monthly if near a city. Monthly is fine out in the boondocks."

Zinzer says, "It doesn't even have to be disruptive of the Guilds. Just say... 'We provide a service for exchanging proof of payments that's far less likely to get robbed than a caravan' etc."

Zinzer says, "And eventually, you just pay the guys manning the tower with those notes of credit."

Tilara says, "Next question is protection. How do you keep the towers from being attacked by bandits?"

Andreth says, "Eventually. But we still need a now."

Ash says, "Alright. The system probably follows the main caravan routes. so we have a representative of the treasury go with the outbound caravans. He makes stops at the towers en route. We do NOT pay the guys in the princedoms - the princes do that. The princes ALSO receive the proceeds from the system's use. Citadel puts a percentage tax on those funds, perhaps. One nice way to keep things in line is to tax the princes based on the number of errors or unavailable transmissions - the emperor takes little for a smoothly-run network, taxes a lot for princes who seem to want to disrupt it. Citadel gets a cut because a lot of interkingdom traffic will go through it."

Ash says, "I amend myself. The treasury rep does NOT pay at the towers. He pays at the towns, when the guys come back from the towers."

Ash says, "That removes any incentive to mug the guys in the towers. You're going to basically shake up a farmer who has nothing on him besides clothes, and for what?"

Ash says, "The towers ARE vulnerable to anyone whose goal is to sabotage the network, which remains a problem. but the list of people who'd stand to gain there is kind of short."

Zinzer says, "That's when you send some professional troubleshooters."

Zinzer says, "Eg... we find the trouble, and then we shoot it. A lot."

Tilara nods. "Lighthouse model. Family or three lives at each tower, gets a stipend to operate it, farms or what-not on the side."

Ash says, "so far so good?"

Andreth says, "It seems like we have a framework in place. If this were the real world, the next step would be to itemize _all_ the costs and determine the break-even cost per typical message and compare that with the price we think the market will bear..."

Zinzer says, "So our major obstacles are - a means to raise towers in town, and a means to transmit messages from one to another over as great a distance as possible (preferably about 30 miles)."

Andreth . o O ( Math is hard. )

Ash says, "Sure. as mentioned, we can drive construction costs for structures down pretty low, so the costs remaining to us are things like optics, continual light spells, and so forth."

Ash says, "Whatever sort of technology we intend to use for the signalling. we also have training as a sort-of-ongoing cost."

Zinzer says, "Maybe our first task, then, is to dig up all we can about magical building artifacts (probably legends abour Jurdah) and the best expert in the world on optics."

Ash nods.

Zinzer says, "And some heavy number-crunching to come up with the codebooks."

Ash says, "This can be a major strategic advantage. If the Stormwinders decide to march into the flatlands again, the ability to coordinate an army and report on conditions at the front should be significant."

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "so yeah, we may have one other idea we can bring to Citadel here :)"

Zinzer says, "So... we have a plan. Was there anything else we wanted to accomplish tonight?"

Ash thinks we got done what we set out to.

BirthGM nods, and is impressed, too.

Ash \[to BirthGM\]: "is there anything further (aside from letters and a plan, which I can digest from this) you need from us?"

BirthGM hmmms, and shakes her head.

BirthGM points at Zinzer. "Your player and I need to talk about Yuri."

BirthGM says, "Next week will begin with some big handwaving poses?"

Ash says, "Any further discussion here, folks, or should I stoplog?"

Zinzer gets the 'deer in the headlights' look.

BirthGM hits the deer.

Tilara says, "Mmmmm..... venison......"

Ash says, "going once, going twice.."

Tilara says, "I'm fine."
