# Birthright 2004-06-11

After a bitterly cold winter - the kind of winter that teaches the true meaning of cold, and the true value of well hidden hot springs - the White Company has once more returned to Samaela's encampment. The winter has been well spent, as all have honed their skills, and improved their knowledge. But the world of the Empire is rumbling. There are new plots afoot, or perchance old plots that were never fully resolved. It is time, then, for the White Company to return home, and learn what has passed in these cold winter months.

Not that the Company has been wholly without news; with Keorn's survival diplomatic ties have grown between the emperor and young Samaela. Letters are occasionally exchanged, including ones written or passed along by Yuri. Letters that suggest that the empress's newly proven fertility is less than welcome. The kingdoms are beginning to break; some of the Princes are beginning to look at their father and wonder if he will ever retire. And to be honest, when a man who has seen more than two centuries marries a young, nubile wife and starts raising babies, the questions don't seem entirely unexpected or irrelevant. Nonetheless, this does not bode well for the Empire. And especially for those kingdoms bordering on Lurinor.

Still, Spring is in the air. Ellinor is round, and plump, and bouncing through camp like a young puppy. The babes she carry sit lightly, and she travels happily to and fro, supported by her life mates, young Jellin and young Stormy. This winter has wrought the biggest change of all in young Stormy, as he has found a home and a purpose. The White Company gave him safety and responsibility, but what he has found now goes beyond that. Slowly, through the winter, Stormy has worked out terms with the White Company so that he won't exactly be leaving the company, but instead, he'll travel with the Changers, and be eyes and ears.

---

Entering Samaela's tent that morning, the White Company finds only three people inside; Samaela herself is seated on cushions, a cloak hanging over her shoulder. Behind her two young people stand. Samaela nods, and bids the Company welcome, in unusually formal tones. After waiting for her guests to seat themselves on low pillows, the man behind her steps forward. "I am Azaril Catspaw and Deerfriend. I will be traveling with you." He bows once, lightly, and steps back. The woman, in turn, moves forward. "My husband says little, and explains less. I am Meliandre of the Alpine Meadows. Samaela sends me as her envoy, her ambassador, to the Emperor. My lovemate will be my shieldmate."

Meliandre is a young slim woman, dressed in plain green tunic. Over her heard the antlers of the Elk are embroidered, while a backpack stands at her feet. Azaril, in contrast, is neither slender not young. His hair is greying at the temples, and tunic and trews do nothing to hide a well developed musculature the envy of any warrior. At his belt hangs a sword, and a bow rests against his larger pack. A single chain hangs around his throat, the medallion eye-catching. The gem is a true tiger's eye, an eye that follows all that is happening before him.

Samaela smiles. "I send Meliandre, my friend, who will speak my words. I send Azaril, who will protect her. I'm hoping that you will allow them to travel with you. The peace Keorn brought is holding, but the forests are full of unhappy people."

Tilara sketches a seated bow to the young woman. "We would be honored, Samaela. It's a small service for the hospitality you have shown us this winter."

Her eyes twinkling, Samaela agrees. "Indeed; we have enjoyed having you as honoured guests. You have taught us much, and hidden little." She looks up at Meliandre. "Treat her well. She travels with my friendship as well as my voice."

Zinzer says nothing himself, watching these young diplomats work their curious art. His gaze is drawn to the odd tiger's eye on the chain around Azaril's neck. _You needn't be a willworker to know that that's enchanted. You merely need to have eyes._

Starguard nods quietly. His mind is on the road already. It's been a long time since he's seen the father or his family back in Woolwich, and with the coming of spring after the damned cold, he's looking forward to going home.

"The course of history is not diverted easily," Zinzer pontificates, eyes closed. "Still. We have opened a stream. Time will tell if we divert the river."

Tilara says, "It's past time that this river is diverted. The Empire is going to be in all kinds of trouble, if Yuri's missives are telling the truth. And you _know_ how much trouble _everyone's_ had with Lurin over the years."

Zinzer smiles wickedly and remains silent.

Starguard snorts. "Yes, Tilara. I'm quite aware of the carnage the Lurinese have caused."

Starguard nods. "We are honored that you trust us with your messengers and diplomats, and will do our best to convey them safely."

Stepping out of the tent, the White Company finds Stormy waiting, his two young mates on either side. He's blushing a little, but nonetheless ... He holds out a leather pouch to Tilara. "For the Company; they might find them useful."

Beside him, Jellin smiles. "We weren't sure what you would need, so we put in a little of everything. There's some to help you see in the dark, and some to help your endurance. And Stormy's specialty, of course. Just as he was our shield in the trials, these will be your shield now." The pouch clinks a little, and obviously contains a collection of small bottles.

Starguard smiles, nodding proudly. Stormy's become an accomplished potion brewer. "I wish you were coming with us Stormy. You always carried your weight, and then some."

Tilara peeks inside. "Thanks. We'll miss you, y'know. Take care of yourself, and ... " She nods to Stormy and his mates. "... take good care of each other, too. We'll be back, sooner or later."

Andreth is seldom a man of many words, and now is no exception. "We'll miss ya, Stormy," says the scarred monk, trying to sound gruff - but it's clear that this parting isn't any easier for him than anyone else.

Tilara sniffles a little, and holds her hands out to the young man she helped train. "Now give me a hug before we go."

Blushing, and hugging Tilara, Stormy grins. "We'll be raising a new family soon; we have the tent prepared. It's just waiting now ..." He smiles wistfully, as though, for a moment, he's tempted to go adventuring again. But it's not a look that lasts. The new life has an allure adventuring doesn't match. The hug lasts a little longer, and then he breaks it off. "Travel safely. Ellinor worries for you. Make sure you write."

Zinzer feels compelled to say something. "It's hard for most people to know that they're doing good, young man. I think you can rest assured that you're doing good here. You've made the right decision." He looks at the others. "And I think we should be off."

Tilara shrugs. "We'll write. I'm not sure how we'll get it delivered if we're not in the capital."

Starguard says, "Enjoy your family life, Stormy. I'm sure you'll be a great father. We'll try to visit sooner or later as well."

Stormy nods. "We'll keep our tent open for you."

Tilara nods. "I know you will. And if you ever need us - or if Samaela does - just give us a shout."

Stormy nods. "We will."

---

Meliandre and Azaril step outside Samaela's tent as the White Company mount their horses. Neither envoy has brought a steed, leading to a moment's confusion. But then Meliandre shimmers, dropping to all fours, and becomes a graceful doe. Her pack is tossed into a small pouch with his own, and Azaril too drops, becoming a giant cat who now wears a single pouch around his throat. Peaceably, the two amble down through the pass and towards Changer's Bane.

Zinzer shifts uneasily in his saddle. "When the lion lies down with the deer... it means a sleepless night for the shepherd." He pauses. "Or something."

Starguard says, "Let's roll out and head home, White Company!"

Tilara says, "I don't think this is quite the same thing, Zinzer." She nods to the two shape-shifters. "Let's move out, then." Mirra is perched lazily on top of one of the pack-loads. _Not walking this time._

The day is at best luke warm, and when the sun begins to droop behind the distant mountain, the company is happy to make camp. Azaril returns from his roamings, two large rabbits caught between his teeth. Meliandre merely smiles, and settles down, once more in human form.

Tilara lights a campfire and starts cleaning the rabbits. "What've you got to go with these, Starguard?"

Zinzer settles onto the ground with a motheaten blanket wrapped around him, "It doesn't seem that spring has quite arrived yet," he says, obviously unaccustomed to the idea of breaking the ice. After a moment he just plunges on ahead. "So Samaela has selected you as the ambassador. You must have some unusual skill with diplomacy?"

Meliandre smiles at the mage. "Skill? Hmmm. She trusts me with her Voice." She shrugs a little. "The Elk have not died out. We are, you may notice, the only non-carnivorous Changers." She looks at Azaril for a moment. "In their weaker moments, when the blood lust is upon them, we have been hunted. We know the safety of numbers, and we understand the strength of promises."

Starguard grins. "With rabbit, and this many mouths? I'm thinking stew, would that be alright for you two?" he asks the changers.

Azaril nods at Starguard. "We would be pleased."

Zinzer shifts his weight. "You say her 'Voice' as if it's a discrete thing one might carry in a pouch. Or is this a reference of tradition?"

Pausing a moment, Meliandre shrugs. "It's a tradition, and it's a fact. When I speak in Samaela's Voice, the words are binding. The promises are kept. Samaela knows the words, and ... sometimes they come from her, and sometimes from me, but ultimately they will bind her as they will bind all who follow her."

Andreth gives Zinzer a puzzled expression. "She's speakin' fer the Changers, ain't she? I guess that's wot they call an..." He pauses over the long word. "ambassader."

Tilara says, "That's _our_ word for it. This seems to be, perhaps, something more."

Zinzer thinks about this for a moment. "So... it's a means of knowing the words over long distances. That's a unique and useful ability." He looks lost in thought.

"And something less," observes Ash. "Samaela doesn't seem to be an authority figure like our Princes. Nor is she like the syndics, such as my family. Whoever follows her may be bound by her words, but they aren't bound to follow her at all."

Azaril sits quietly, the medallion at his throat blinking in the firelight.

Tilara says, "And what about you, Azaril? That medallion looks to be something arcane. Can you tell us what it does?"

Azaril blinks at Tilara. "It gives me strength." He falls silent again, suggesting in his motions that he is not a man of many words.

Andreth raises an eyebrow. "In arms or in spirit?"

"Yes." The simple word floats across the campsite. Azaril's eyebrow arches up, inviting Andreth to share the joke.

"There's no difference between 'em," comments Ash, directing his words to Andreth and his eyes to Azaril. "You fight with your spirit. Weapons are just the tools."

Meliandre curls up against Azaril, soaking up some of his warmth. "Of course, there's strength in our human side, too. Without it, we would be ... well, not enemies, but predator, and prey."

Andreth flexes and clenches his fingers. "Or not even that," he says, agreeing with Ash. "But there're some strong in spirit but frail in body. Great men in stoppin' fights from happenin', but not in winnin' em if'n they canna be stopped." He nods to Azaril. "I'd be glad ta know how ye earned it, if ye don't mind tellin'. An' if ye do..." He shrugs.

Zinzer watches with hidden amusement. _Warriors. There's no magic like the edge of the sword._

Azaril tilts his head. "There's no shame in it. Meliandre found the gem, and polished it, and imbued it. And 'twas a good thing she did, when the blood fever took me." He looks at his mate, smiling. "Now I have the strength of the blood lust, but I no longer lose sight of those I love in the red light."

Zinzer thinks, _Oh, dear. That doesn't sound safe at all._ "You must be curious about the Flatlands. We'd be happy to answer any questions you have. Forewarned is forearmed."

Starguard says, "I hope that you love us should we get into a fight, good sir."

Andreth says, "Ahh..." inclining his head in return. "A great boon, that," he adds, smiling.

Azaril nods. "Indeed. Some of my children will be as Meliandre, I am sure, and I would not wish to come upon them unawares ..." His teeth still look sharp, the incisors projecting a little longer than human teeth would.

Meliandre stretches a little. "Tell me, please of your Emperor. Is he a good man? A wise leader? A kind father? Why do his sons fight and squabble?"

Tilara says, "He is all of those things, now - good, and wise, and a kind father - but he is very old, and his eldest children did not, I think, benefit from that wisdom in time."

Tilara says, "Lurin, at least, seems disappointed to the point of madness that his father will not give the Empire to his care."

The White Company's swordsman speaks next. "The Emperor is a good man, and a wise leader, and a kind father, and all these things are true. What he knows, and what his sons do not yet is.." Ash hesitates, searching for the proper words. "That gaze and grasp are not always the same. But perhaps it is easier for him, because the Emperor's boundaries have been tested by great wars, while the princes' have not, so much."

Tilara hmmms. "I thought that the Princes were involved in the wars. They learned the wrong lessons, though..."

Meliandre nods, slowly. "So the elder sons are still young?"

Starguard says, "The problem with the Emperor and the Princes is that young and old don't really apply. None of them seem to be in much of a hurry to die."

Andreth scratches his chin. "They're... long-lived, not so much as their father. They've lived long enough ta know better, I'd think, an' I think th'Emperor is as puzzled as anyone else why some of 'em still don't."

Azaril snorts. "The cub will confound its parent until its parent swats it hard enough."

Zinzer says, "Well... there's one that may be dying. But we don't know much about that." He pauses.

Tilara says, "They age faster than the Emperor - but they are naetheless still young and at the same time much older than most of their subjects."

Zinzer says, "Cel isn't the oldest prince, is he? It doesn't make sense that he should be dying. Certainly not of old age."

Andreth looks troubled. "P'raps. And p'raps e's afeared that if he swats one, their siblings 'll set upon 'im." The monk sighs - neither a parent nor a ruler, the complexities of Flatland politics vex him.

Meliandre tilts her head. "I do not think he does. But not every child is as strong as his parent, or as close to his Ancestor?"

Zinzer says, "The Emperor's strength isn't entirely in his arms. He has a wisdom that comes from age. And like any man, I think he tires of taking responsibility for his childrens' misdeeds."

Zinzer says, "His goals are, for the most part, to get the population back up, since the wars have taken their toll on our people. And beyond that, to keep his people feed."

Meliandre nods. "Worthy goals. Samaela shares them. As do I." Her voice rings a little on that second sentence, and she blushes a little, shrugging, and looking at the pot. "How does the stew fare, Brother Starguard?"

After a pleasant meal, beds are made up and the long night passes quietly. Nothing to seriously disturb the watches. An owl hoots once, and some chittering as two squirrels fight over an acorn at sunrise. Nothing that presents a threat. In the morning, once more the two changers change shape, and lead the way across the mountain passes.

---

After seven days of travel, through mountains young and pointy - and taking quite a different route from the one Keorn led the company on the preceding Fall - the fortress stands on the far side of the river, at the high point of the final pass. Guards man the walls, facing both outwards into the mountains, and inwards into Aglamar, but beyond the walls a small village has begun to grow.

Starguard hmms. "Things are progressing, aren't they? The reclimation is certainly proceeding quickly..."

This last day, after the nooning break, Meliandre and Azaril have walked as humans. Now, standing still some ways away, they look up at the fort. "So; do we travel through her, or around her?" Meliandre looks at Azaril, who smiles and shrugs. Then she turns to the company.

"Through," decides Ash. "Best that people here know who we are and what our business is."

Tilara says, "His Nibs had _better_ have warned them we're coming through by this time. Through."

Starguard says, "Besides, a night in a bed is not an unappealing prospect, and I could pick up some supplies."

Zinzer says, "I concur. Besides... we've been away for some time. I think I'd like to get the opinions of the men on the street."

Zinzer says, "I think it's been... I forget how long, since I entered the labyrinth." He frowns. "In fact... for some reason, all my memories of the flatlands are hazy. Like they come from a time before waking."

Andreth chuckles wryly. "It's not been so long for me, I think, but long enough."

As the company approaches the gates, they're quickly and easily spotted. Not surprising, really. But the reaction is less than perfect. The portcullis slams down, and the gates are pulled shut between them. A horn calls out, ringing three blasts, and the tips of bows line the ramparts.

Tilara nods. "So - shall I scout ahead, or shall we just ride up to the fortress and announce ourselves?"

Starguard says, "I think you're a bit too late for that. My word. You'd think they've never seen anyone on this side of the gate before," he remarks dryly.

Eyeing the rumored bowmen for a moment, Ash raises both his hands slowly, spreading them outward. "We are the White Company, in the service of the Emperor himself," he calls, loudly and distinctly. "We would speak with the commander here."

A single man steps to the the front of the ramparts, his helmet cradled in his arm. "I am Lord Marrinan, lord of Changer's Bane, fourteenth great grandson of Aglamarno and I hold the fortress. We do not know the White Company. We do not recognize the White Company."

"We can furnish you with proof of our claim, if you will speak with us peaceably," calls Ash in response.

The portcullis is slowly raised, and then a single man steps through the postern gate. He walks forward slowly, his hands at his side. Clearly, he is carrying no weapons.

The man comes to a halt about twenty paces away, and waits quietly.

Ash speaks slowly. "We carry a magic crystal given to us by the Brotherhood of the Water, whose abbot communicates closely with the Emperor. We came with his man, Keorn, on a mission to the Changers, and have completed it. Use the crystal, speak to the abbot, and through him you will find proof."

The man nods, holding out his hand. "How is the crystal activated?"

Ash reaches carefully for the implements, then explains slowly how the device works, including (most importantly) what to expect when it turns on, and what to say when it does. "You may reach a lesser Brother; if so, ask for the abbot in our name," he concludes.

Accepting the crystal the man nods. "Wait here."

Holding the crystal carefully, the man returns through the gate, and the portcullis drops once more. Marriman disappears from the ramparts, although nobody else seems to be moving. Hours pass, and the sun sinks lower and lower in the sky, but little changes.

Zinzer says, "I think we've been had."

Tilara nods. "Possibly. Starguard, do you have a locate spell on tap?"

Starguard says, "I'm afraid I don't Tilara. I didn't know we were going to be doing this today."

Andreth sighs, and cracks his knuckles. "I hate it when people play stupid games," he says to no one in particular. "What're we doin' about this?"

When the sun is about to drop behind the fortress a single silent command is given. A troop of archers step up, and let loose their arrows. Most miss, but a few hit. The targets seem to be concentrating on Meliandre, on Zinzer, and on Starguard.

Starguard curses. "Why the devil are you shooting at us?!?" he shouts at the wall before retreating back, hopefully out of arrow range...

Tilara swears as she reins her horse around and heads back out of arrow range. "That's it. I don't care whose grandson he is, he's a dead man."

Changing rapidly into an elk, Meliandre runs back into the mountains, back the way they came, the blood streaming off her hindquarters. Behind her, Azaril falls into a crouch, his tail swishing before he jumps after her.

Starguard urges Windrider up and back, winging quickly into the air before circling upwards... Together, they fly up, and circle high over the tower, seeing how foolish the bowmen are. There tends to be at least one in ever unit...

For his part, Ash realizes that a fortress is not amenable to assault, and that lives are more important right now than vengeance. Wheeling, he follows the others as they withdraw at best speed, using himself as a shield for Zinzer as best he can.

Zinzer throws the spell he's been working on all winter, learned from the energies and rhythms of the frozen Changer lands. Even as he's feathered by several arrows, anger drives the casting, and a sheet of ice, thirty feet wide and nearly as tall, springs from the ground in between the White Company and the ramparts of the fortress. An inchoate shriek of rage escapes Zinzer's throat. "Ignorant, ARROGANT ass!"

There isn't one in this unit, however. There is a mage. A mage who has mastered lightning bolts. A mage who is now flinging a bolt high up into the air.

Behind the shelter of the ice wall, Meliandre stumbles for a moment, but then she regains her footing with a helping nudge from Azaril, and races on. Within a few minutes, the ice wall is all that remains of the White Company, as they have fled as fast as they can.

Evening finds the somewhat less confident company trying to make a miserly camp. The trees overhead and all around provide scant comfort, but better some than none. Azaril, now, is on the prowl, having left the group once Meliandre collapsed on the ground.

Starguard landed shortly after, rolling off the bird to heal the poor woman. "Dammit. Zinzer, do you have a warrant in that city or what?"

Andreth mutters. "Okay, they're agin us, gods know why. Only question is what d'we do 'bout it."

Zinzer stalks around the camp himself, his face florid and his arrow-wounds barely staunched by wads of cotton torn from a spare shirt. In deference to the tense situation he does not shout, but mutters and barks explitives. "Ignorant, ARROGANT ass. He MUST have known. He must want a war. I've never even heard of such stupidity except among the legends of the Gods! In a man, such wanton disregard for life is a sin. Such wanton disregard for MY life is unforgivable! I'll have his general's baton for a backscratcher before I'm done!"

Tilara stalks back and forth around the camp's perimeter. Mirra's tail switches back and forth in time with her strides. "I can't think of another explanation. Marrinan has to be a turncoat. Well, I suppose it could be the Brothers who've gone insane, but Marrinan seems more likely to be the weak link. I wonder how many pet mages he has..."

Ash holds up his hands. "Faster and easier to get to the Brotherhood than to get the crystal back," he points out. "And better that people know what is going on. If this is a mistake, we will find out. If it is deliberate, best that the Emperor and his advisors know now - if they don't already."

Zinzer says, "Ash speaks truth as always. Right now the only people that know of Marrinan's treachery - for only that can explain this insanity - are us. The rest of the world must know. And Meliandre must be protected." He spits. "You lot must be rubbing off on me. I'm putting the lives of all the innocents who would be killed in this war ahead of my own." He pauses. "Barely."

Starguard nods. "Windrider and I can make the best time, easily. But how will we find you again..." He hmms. "Andreth, keep my healer's kit close, and come back close to here in three days, and I will find you."

Zinzer says, "I've another idea." He hands a ring with a small ruby to Starguard. "Keep this on you and we can find you. That way we can go in both directions."

Starguard takes it. "Thanks, Zinzer." Blood runs down his leg from an arrow wound. "Should we take the lady with us? She's obviously a target..."

Tilara chuckles at Zinzer. "We're contagious, we are." She nods to Starguard. "Take Meliandre with you, I think. The Brothers can keep her safe even if Marrinan tries something crazy."

Zinzer says, "I think that's up to the Lady and Azaril."

Meliandre shakes her head. "No. We must learn more. Here. Azaril will return in two days time."

Zinzer sighs. "Are you sure that's what you want? I think I've read this book. We can't allow the diplomat to die. We've already allowed you to be injured. The only rational reasons behind this madness indicate to me that Marrinan will be gunning for you most of all."

Tilara nods. "So be it. But we do need to protect you, milady. The archers were aiming for you more than any of us. I find that ... disturbing."

Starguard nods. "Then good luck, White Company. I shall return quickly. Be careful..." He jumps on his hawk, and spurs him up into the air.

Andreth raises a hand. "I wonder. Th'fortress has a name. P'raps Marrinan's hatred for milady's people is greater 'n his loyalty to the Emperor. Ye did use their name at the gate."

Zinzer says, "Wait... Starguard!"

Shrugging, Meliandre touches the emblem on her tunic. "If I die, Samaela will know. If I Speak, Samaela will know. But I cannot Speak what I do not know."

Zinzer says, "Don't get shot down by the Brothers. Marrinan may have fed them all sorts of falsehoods by now, not the least of which is that a giant changer bird may come to them and attack them."

Zinzer says, "You might try dropping a message in the courtyard first."

Starguard nods. "I'll be careful, Zinzer. Thank you." With that, he's off...

Zinzer sits heavily on the ground and winces. "Damn. Forgot to ask the old fool to heal my wounds. Anyone got a healing potion?"

Zinzer stares over at Ash. "Ash. You know all about honor. What do you make of this?"

"If I knew all about honor, I wouldn't be with you lot," jokes the warrior, hoping to draw smiles. He grows more serious. "I read Marrinan as acting on someone else's orders. It took several hours for the order to attack us to come through - he had many opportunities to do so otherwise. We trusted him. He could have invited us inside, yes?"

Tilara twitches an eyebrow at Ash. "Damn... you're right. That does make sense. But who would he have contacted? And did he even try to use the crystal?"

Zinzer says, "I wonder why they waited until sundown. Maybe he didn't even bother, just told them 'Shoot them if they are still there when the sun sets'."

"I doubt he did. Why draw attention to himself?" asks Ash. "Best not to advertise that he even knew we were present."

Zinzer growls. "I still can't believe it. I wonder if they are following us."

Tilara says, "Depends whether he's following orders willingly or reluctantly. We'd best put up a careful guard tonight."

Zinzer drinks a healing potion and feels slightly less ornery. He channels his energies into more constructive endeavors, such as studying spells.

Andreth warms his hands by the fire. "I guess this means we canna trust anyone inna Flatlands less'n we've already met 'em once before..." he mutters, sighing. "What's the world comin' to..."

The others in the little camp go about their respective routines as well, but always there's a heightened watchfulness. The White Company feels the cold knife of attempted betrayal at their throats even still, and the chill of it enforces a sense of urgency and immediacy to the choosing and execution of the night's watches. Tomorrow will be more fruitful - hopefully.
