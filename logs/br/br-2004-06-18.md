The night passes uneventfully, although the watches are a little odd; Starguard is long gone, Meliandre mutters a little in her sleep, as the wounds - though healed - still bother her, and the wind keens through the trees. Still, no arrows fly, no axes fall, and no swords poke. In all, the morning comes nice and bright and early.

Tilara watches the dawn, as she fills in on the last watch for the missing Starguard. As the rest awake, she poses the obvious question. "So, do we try to go around the place, wait here for Starguard, or try to sneak in invisibly?"

Ash turns his head, frowning. "Just what would we gain by sneaking in?" he asks.

Zinzer looks surprised to be alive. "I think we can presume that they weren't intent enough on killing us to follow us into these woods last night. If it were me, I would have dispatched men, and dogs, and implacable hatred to cut us down while we were weakened." He snorts. "I suppose I should be happy those warmongering fools are inconsistent in their application."

Zinzer says, "I think our priority is to protect Meliandre and delivery her safely to the court. I don't think that entering the keep by any means serves that purpose."

Ash nods in agreement. "That leaves go around - which leaves Starguard out in the cold - or wait here, preferably quietly."

Tilara says, "Well, the fellow in charge might not have enough people he can trust to violate a truce flag and conceal it. You're probably right, though. I'd like to get the crystal back, but I think we can trust His Nibs to deal with this fellow once we get back."

Zinzer says, "Starguard has the advantage of mobility. I'm sure he'll be able to catch up with us."

Ash waves a hand. "The crystal is more valuable in their hands than ours," he points out. "The Brothers can supply Starguard with another. And perhaps they can trace the location of the first, if it should happen to move in unexpected ways."

Tilara says, "It still rankles, though. I don't like getting set up like that."

Ash shrugs a little. "Well, too bad," he declares, somewhat brusquely. "Being humiliated time and again rankles, but we've had our share of victories. Reap whatever your plot of soil will grow."

Zinzer says, "That crystal was probably unique. I don't think the Brothers have another."

Zinzer says, "They will probably be quite upset that we lost it... but I do not believe that our odds are good trying to recover it now. What we'd really need is an expert burglar, someone who can slip in and our un-noticed, with a glib tongue, and honorable heart, and a believable demeanor."

Zinzer says, "So... we try to sneak around." He thinks. "Give me some time to cast a spell. I may be able to help us."

Tilara says, "In and out unnoticed I can manage. Glib and believable I can handle. What's this honorable stuff?"

Zinzer says, "So that the thief will return the precious bauble to us instead of keeping it for himself, of coure."

Tilara says, "Ah. But I _am_ us. So that's not a problem."

Zinzer says, "Perhaps if the rest of you hid in one of those caves, and I cast the spell from some distance away... I can get a look at what they are up to and perhaps see a safe route around this dilemma."

Ash shrugs a little. "If it will not endanger the Company, and if you do not lead them back here," he says, "then do as you wish."

Andreth shakes his head, sighing. "Soun's awful risky. If'n they catch you, there'll be naught we c'n do to save ye."

Zinzer shrugs, an unreadable expression on his face. "That does not concern me."

Tilara says, "If they catch him, they still have to get here to do anything. We'll be able to head out before it's a problem."

After moving away from the camp, Zinzer settles down with a small mirror. A moment's concentration and a few spoken syllables, and Marrinan's face appears in the mirror. The man looks angry, and his eyes are narrowed. After a moment, words float through the mirror. Unkind, unpleasant words in a language Zinzer doesn't recognize. A few moments more, and Marrinan reins himself in, and continues in Mar. "You will now explain to me, precisely, what happened to your little boy, and why he is no longer in the tower room; the room with only one door, and one window? One window that was barred shut. One door that was locked and guarded. One boy that is missing." Marrinan's head turns a little, and an open hand flies by, followed by a slap and a cry.

A pause, and then a softly murmured comment. Marrinan looks up, and a hand appears in the mirror; it grows larger, encompassing the entirety, and then closes, crushing the little eye.

Zinzer returns to the Company. "I only got a few seconds. Marrinan was speaking in a language I don't recognize, and he seemed angry. He was talking to someone in the room with him about a missing boy - apparently a prisoner there, held in a room with one barred window and one locked, guarded door. The boy seems t ohave escaped. And then he slapped someone." He pauses. "I wonder if this is good for us, or bad for us."

Tilara gives a nasty grin. "If it's bad for Marrinan, it's good for us some way or other."

Ash hums. "Is that it?" he asks. "Any idea if they are combing the woods for us, or intending to?"

Tilara sighs. "But if he's that good at magecraft, I think I'll have to give up on the idea of sneaking in. We'll wait for Azaril to get back, and then try to go around?"

Andreth's scarred face quirks, but nods slightly. "Well, if'n we c'n find the lad first, 'e may tell us much that Marrinan wouldnae want us knowin'."

Zinzer says, "I think they knew they were being scried upon. I don't know if they know it was me."

Zinzer says, "So they might be coming, or not, but it's possible that they're too distracted to bother. Marrinan himself certainly isn't on his way here... yet."

Ash nods grimly. "They will certainly not have forgotten about us in such a short time," he concludes. "They saw someone conjure up a wall of ice; they know someone with magic is among us. Zinzer, Tilara, whatever you can do to defeat counter-scrying may be important now."

Tilara shrugs. "Not my specialty, I'm afraid - but I'll keep my eyes open."

Zinzer says, "I think it's safe to assume that we've made a new enemy, whether we knew it or not. Of course, I'm of a philosophical bent. I don't believe enemies are made. They just wait there, in potentia, for you to discover them."

Zinzer looks sidelong at Meliandre. "What would you wish, then? Our task is to escort you."

Meliandre looks troubled. "Azaril said he would return tomorrow evening; he needs time to scout thoroughly. But he did not tell me what his plans were." She pauses, and thinks. "I know that Marrinan has one son, a little boy about eight years old. I like this not."

Zinzer says, "He'd keep his own son locked up and under guard? Why would he do that?"

Tilara says, "Hmm. Imprisonment? Or protection?"

Meliandre pauses a moment longer. "Zinzer; this Marrinan, what did he look like? Does the scar the Hawks gave him still burn lividly on his cheek?"

Zinzer says, "What? I saw no scar. I suspect that here lies a tale."

Meliandre raises an eyebrow. "Changer's Bane was named, or perhaps renamed, after Marrinan's wife and daughters were slaughtered. He himself was left for dead, with one eye destroyed, and only the boy escaped unharmed, and that because the boy was ill with a fever." She shakes her head.

Zinzer says, "Ash... did the man you speak to yesterday have both eyes?"

Andreth furrows his brow. "If it isna Marrinan, then who is 'e? And why should he na include th'scar wi' his disguise? Surely all who knew Marrinan must know that 'e's marked."

Zinzer says, "Well, it might be that the man I spied on wasn't Marrinan, and only claimed to be, because Marrinan feared getting attacked by us. Or that there's an imposter claiming to be Marrinan. Either way, we've been lied to, and I don't like it."

Ash shakes his head at last. "We'd heard this tale," he reminds the others. "Apparently we forgot it over the winter, though it doesn't surprise me. Very well then. Meliandre, are you well enough to move?" His voice reflects concern. "If so, for your safety, we should stay mobile for the next day or more."

Andreth says, "Well, we been attacked too, and I think we all like that e'en less."

Meliandre nods. "Where shall we go? We need not return precisely here; Azaril will find us."

Ash waves a hand. "We simply need to stay away from a set camp," he suggests. "We may be scried upon, tracked or hunted now. And if there is more to this story of the boy, I think we must hear it, if you can tell it."

Standing, Meliandre looks around. "Well, for now, let us move deeper into the mountains, and I can tell the tale while we walk. It isn't long, and doesn't redound well on the Changers." She sighs. "While Samaela was still a young girl, and noone knew of her promise, the Changers were leaderless. Some traveled the plains. Some fought in the mountains."

"There were a lot of feuds, there still are, and Samaela has a lot of work ahead of her. We wondered if she would find four Suitors at all, or if the Cats would fail to show, and so ruin the Courtship." Meliandre shrugs. "But you were there, you know the outcome. Still, there is a large clan of Hawks who will have nothing to do with Samaela. They consider her weak, and her choices poor. Her parents were both hawks, you see, but were both outcasts. A different long story. In any case, these hawks have made a lot of trouble; they go forth, and sow hate. And why not? They can fly. Samaela suspects that it mwas members of this clan that scarred the empress, and likely killed Marrinan's family, too. Before then, he was a loyal captain, who held the pass against the Stormwinds."

"Now ..." Meliandre sighs. "Now ... I don't understand why they do this. They're dumping carrion in their own water source."

"From where do they hail now?" asks Ash as he walks, keeping a steady pace, with his eyes attending the surroudings. "Or is that known?"

"Up in the highlands?" Meliandre shakes her head. "Samaela doesn't know. Neither do we. Hawks don't leave tracks to follow; we can follow their carnage, but ... the attacks span the empire, and beyond."

Zinzer says, "Didn't you lot encounter some hawk mercenaries down in the plains, aiding some local bandit chief?"

Ash nods slowly, and scratches his chin, feeling the growth of stubble there and smiling for a moment at it. "Yes, but not hawks only, as I recall," he answers. "Still..."

Ash scratches his chin again. "We have had other contacts with hawks. Or rather, with bird-feathers. I wonder what kind of bird would have shed 'em.. Perhaps it's nothing."

Zinzer says, "So... his son survived. Do you know what he did afterwards, what he told the Flatlanders, what he did with his son?"

Zinzer says, "It might help to know if the man we saw as just lying to us about his identity, or was lying to the whole Empire."

"His son? Marrinan's son?" Meliandre looks confused. "Well, the lad's still a bit young for training, so he's been kept at home. But from all accounts, his father loves him dearly. After all, he loved the lad's mother intensely ... she was a Changeling, and he took the far away post so he could marry her."

Tilara says, "Oh-ho. The plot thickens. Do Changelings sometimes have Changer offspring?"

Zinzer says, "It seems there is much to conern us in that fortress."

Meliandre nods at Tilara. "Yes. The first Samaela was not a Changer, even though her first four children were; so in our ancestry there is Outblood, and sometimes it bubbles up."

Zinzer says, "It's odd. You act like those who cannot change are less than human, and Lurin acts like those who can are monsters."

Tilara nods. "Could be the boy's a Changer then, and his father is trying to -- what?"

Meliandre looks at Zinzer. "They are not, exactly, less than human. But they are not True Children of Far Seer, either."

Ash shrugs. "Okay," he says, "so they're not family, as you see it. But you're still hospitable to your neighbors and kinfolk, however far removed. Isn't that just common politeness?"

Andreth coughs quietly. "Politeness ain't that common, dependin' where ye are."

"Certainly. Unless your neighbours are trying to kill you, or your kin folk are weakening the herd." Meliandre shrugs.

Zinzer says, "Perhaps that's something your Syndics could teach these border captains, Ash. A little hospitality would have gone a long way yesterday."

---

After two days on the move, circling around the fort, the company is camped when a large cat walks daintily into their midst. Tail swishing, he sits for a moment, catching Meliandre's eye, and then stretches into Azaril's form. "There's trouble afoot." He begins his report immediately, assuming everyone is listening. "The fort is locked up tighter'n a drum. There's a quarantine, they've told the people, farmers and the like, living around them. Soldiers go in, and so does food, but nothing goes out."

Azaril grins. "The smith observed the shit must be piling higher and deeper than ever; they normally have to cart it away."

Zinzer says, "You know, if there is one place in this world I don't want to be, it's back in that hole where you found me. The other place is inside that fort. But I fear we must go there anyway. I suppose it's better than living on rat."

Andreth mutters under his breath. Then, out loud: "Did ye hear how long's this been goin' on? Is it just cos we arrived, or was this 'appenin' afore we got 'ere?"

Zinzer says, "It probably has something to do with the boy escaping."

"It's been going on about three weeks, give or take. Smith figures the messenger that brought news of the emperor's new son probably brought the disease, whatever it be, at the same time ..." Azaril shrugs. "And nobody knows what the disease is; nobody's seen a body, although they've smelled a few funeral pyres."

Zinzer says, "So how did you find all of this out? That's pretty specialized knowledge, and it sounds like it came directly from the people involved."

Azaril smiles. "The smith ... has a wife. She's very ... attracted to cats." He stretches a little. "And the smithy is a little apart, to avoid fire hazards."

Ash listens carefully, nodding at length as he hears answers. "Meliandre's safety guides our actions, Azaril," he says, stating a simple fact. "It sounds like there are things that would be valuable to know inside. However, we are not here to escort you to the fortress's holding cell. Shall we find a way past, or sneak through, based on what you learned?"

Zinzer says, "If they're locked up, sneaking by should be easier... but it seems this place is key to the politics of peace. Or war, as the case may be."

Azaril looks at Meliandre, and she looks back. "We will abide by your decision; Samaela sent me to learn of your customs. I am here to observe, as well as to Speak."

Zinzer says, "Can either of you describe Marrinan's son? Give me his name, tell me what he looks like, and so on? If he's made it out of the castle, we might encounter him." He pauses. "I know not if that is somethingt o encourage or avoid."

Tilara snorts. "If it's something to avoid, you just _know_ the Gods will arrange it, just to be difficult."

Shaking his head, Azaril answers for both. "The lad is eight years old, and well formed, and youngest born of a Changeling lass. That's all we know."

Andreth hmphs. "I just wish I knew why the man in the castle isna scarred." He rubs his chin. "How widely known's this Marrinan? And... ev'ryone around here must know. Why're they sittin' still? Did 'e tell 'em a fancy story about gettin' magical healing? Or are they just afeared of 'im?"

Zinzer says, "Or he lied about his identity to us on the prudent grounds that we might be there to attack him."

Azaril looks confused. "What do you mean? I certainly heard nothing of mystical healing. I heard much complaint about the Changers, and the scars the Lord bears to this day, but ..."

Zinzer says, "The man who introduced himself as Marrinan is unscarred and has both his eyes."

Zinzer says, "We aspied this through sorcerous means yesterday."

Andreth begins, "Then..." He closes his mouth, turning this over in his head. "They locked up the Keep tight, right. The people inna town don't _know_ what's happenin' in there. I'm wonderin' if it's knowledge rather 'n a plague they're tryin' ta keep from gettin' out."

A brief shake. "Must be a different man, then." He pauses, and looks at Meliandre. "But I should let you draw your own conclusions."

Andreth goes on. "The guy wi'out the scars, then, hasna had the _chance_ ta disguise 'imself, I guess. P'raps 'e figured that cos we ain't from around 'ere, we wouldna know 'e weren't Marrinan. And this'd explain why he'd tried ta lock up Marrinan's son." He shakes his head. "This is _bad_. But what c'n we do about it?"

"We can warn the people of Citadel and ask on the road," suggests Ash. "I maintain that entering the keep with any purpose other than exiting it is foolhardy. We don't know enough; we certainly weren't prepared for them last time, and little has changed since then."

Zinzer says, "Ash speaks wisely, I think. I regret that we cannot crack this nut at this time. There is much evil afoot here. But our current purpose is more important."

Andreth nods, and sighs. "True enough there. If'n we c'n safely get past, we mustna risk Meliandre's mission for our own causes. What's important is waitin' fer Starguard ta get back, an' then we must be on our way."

Andreth pauses and turns to Azaril. "Any word about us, then, and our meetin' at the gate? C'n we safely pass through the village, or is word out that we're to be captured?"

Azaril smiles. "No word at all. As I said; nothing comes out of the castle. Food goes in, and soldiers go in, but nothing comes out."

Andreth chuckles. "Except one young lad, so it seems. Unless he's wanderin' the halls and hidin' from the guards, which I s'pose could be true." He shakes his head. "But ennaway. We've gotta spread the word sometime that Marrinan ain't Marrinan. An' I know if this 'ere were _my_ village, I'd hate bein' the last ta know."

Ash considers quietly. "The keep may not be open to us," he suggests, "but we should at least spread the word on the road ahead - subtly."

Tilara sits pensively. "If it really isn't Marrinan in there, that'd explain why the boy was locked up. And this whole mess explains very nicely why they swiped our crystal... they don't want word getting out."

Zinzer walks a few minutes away from the Company camp and sets up his circle and mirror for an attempt to scry on the keep. After a few minutes of tripping over his own feet, mis-spoken words, and half-glimpsed visions of large rocks, he returns with nothing to show but a bad headache and a sullen disposition. "Let's move on."

Tilara suddenly sits up, shifting suddenly from pensive to alert. "_That's_ what's been bothering me. Azaril, you said that _soldiers_ were going into the fort? That wouldn't make any sense at all if this was a real plague - new arrivals would stay outside and wait for the disease to die down again. Something is definitely screwy here."

Azaril nods. "Apparently a new platoon arrived, and went inside immediately."

Ash waves a hand. "Of course it's not a plague," he answers, speaking up. "They're preparing for an attack somewhere."

Zinzer says, "Didn't Starguard have some trick he did to ask the Gods for their opinion on things? What we really need to know right now is how bad it will be if we don't try to put a stop to it right now."

"An' it happened when th' messenger arrived carryin' news of the new prince," comments Andreth. "Mebbe we should go inta the village, ask a few quiet questions. What did Marrinan an' 'is lieutenants think o' Potapka, f'rinstance."

Tilara says, "I don't think we need Starguard for that one, Zinzer. I'm going in, to see what there is to be seen." She nods to Andreth. "Do that. I'm going to go over the wall and listen to what the soldiers are saying to each other. I should be safe enough if I stay away from the mages."

Zinzer says, "I think the rest of us will wait for you elsewhere, Tilara, perhaps the village, or more likely, a camp outside of it."

"You have a responsibility to Meliandre too," says Ash, in answer to this. "If you bring soldiers with you, do not rush back to our position."

Andreth peers at Tilara. "If ye think ye can, go ahead. Though maybe Mirra c'n do it more safely. Specially if ye can make 'er invisible. They wouldna let a cat walk out, I venture ta guess, but that's only if'n they knew it were there."

Tilara says, "I can make us both invisible, actually. Though I think I'll leave her here in case we need to communicate while I'm in there."

Zinzer returns from the afternoon's scrying attempt, looking concerned. "It worked better this time. I think I found Marrinan's son. He's outside the Keep."

Zinzer says, "I think we have to get moving before someone else finds him."

Tilara says, "There's a lot of things outside the Keep. Do you have a more specific location in mind?"

Andreth nods, cracking his knuckles. "Darn straight. If 'Marrinan' don't want 'im found by outsiders, we want 'im found. I think Tilara said somethin' bout that earlier t'day."

Tilara says, "This takes priority. I can go peek at the soldiers later, and the boy might have the information we need."

After Zinzer describes the cave and the river's edge, Azaril looks up; it's a description he recognizes. "It's not far." He leads the way, and indeed, only twenty minutes later he waves the party to a halt. Gesturing at people to dismount, he leads the company closer to the river, finally hiding behind a low mound. In the river, a small boy is huddled, still scraping muck off his hide.

Ash stays back, knowing his presence and arms will not be the most suitable for opening a friendly dialogue. He draws his bow and prepares an arrow, holding both loosely and hunkering down as he methodically scans the landscape, acting as sentry meanwhile.

Tilara murmurs an incantation that the others haven't seen before, and her form shimmers as she shrinks to a twelve-year-old version of herself. "This ought to do. Let's go down to the river, Mirra."

Zinzer watches Tilara from behind some weeds, and blinks in shock. "That's a good trick."

Tilara chuckles. "Well, I didn't spend the whole winter with the Changers and not learn a -few- tricks."

Azaril nods. "Good thinking, miss. Good luck."

She lets Mirra go first. _Go be nice to the boy, dear heart. Meow at him and be friendly, let's see how he reacts._

The cat looks up, sniffing, and prances ahead. _Poopy head!_ Still, she moves forward, waiting on the bank until the boy notices her. Which he does, eventually. At first, he jumps in startlement. But then, spotting the girl, he smiles apologetically.

Tilara smiles back. "Hello, there. I'm Tilara. Are you from around here?" She pretends to notice Mirra. "There you are, Mirra!"

The cat looks back at Tilara, and then pounces on a floating leaf, moving further away. Giggling, the boy moves out of the water, shivering a little in the chill. "I'm Mar ... Marlin. Like the fish."

Tilara giggles. "That must be why you're in the river, then. Isn't it a bit cold for that?"

The boy nods, shivering dramatically. "Yeah. But ... I fell in, and ... uh ..." He stops, and looks at Tilara. "I don't think I recognize you. You must be new?"

Tilara nods. "I'm not from around here. My folks are traders."

The boy looks up eagerly. "Oh! When do you think you'll be leaving? And ... do you think they're hiring?"

Tilara says, "Ummm... we're leaving tomorrow, I think. I don't know about hiring. What can you do?"

Marlin bites his lip. "I can ... I can read and write, real good, and ... and ... ummm ... I'm good with dogs! And I can fish! And ... ummm ..."

Mirra hisses at the mention of dogs, and Tilara smiles. "I don't think they need anyone just to fish." She looks a bit more serious. "What about your parents?"

Marlin pales. "Never mind. It was a stupid idea." He shrugs, and begins to head up the bank. "I should get going, anyways. Before my _parents_ begin to worry."

Tilara calls after him. "Marlin? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. You don't have to go away."

Marlin stops on the top of the bank. "Really. I can't stay. I don't want to worry people." He looks smaller now, and worried.

Tilara says, "Are you in trouble? I can get my parents to let you come with us if you need to get away."

Marlin looks torn. "I ... I ... I ... don't know."

Tilara says, "Oh, c'mon back with me. At least we can get you cleaned up - you look like you fell into a stable midden. You don't want to go back to the village smelling that way, do you?"

Marlin looks down and giggles. "I do, don't I." He looks up. "I will."
