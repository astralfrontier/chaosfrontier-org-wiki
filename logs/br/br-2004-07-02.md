# Birthright 2004-07-02

After a long flight, Windrider circles over the Monastery to cries fo amazement from the young monks below. Finally he lands on the grassy sward in front, and Starguard clumsily climbs down, his legs still a little wobbly from the long flight. Agilnes, captain of the Gatekeepers, comes strding up, Nolwen and Alwen behind him.

Starguard kneads the muscles in Windrider's neck. "Good job, my friend. I hope we've been swift enough to make a difference." He turns to the approaching armsmen. "Ho, there! I come as a friend!"

Agilnes nods, curtly. "You look familiar." Behind him, Nolwen and Alwen smile, and Alwen approaches his captain. "Ah," the captain says, having been reminded, "Brother Starguard. I see. You'll be wanting to overnight here before you travel onwards?"

"That depends," Starguard begins, "on how my news is received. I bring grave tidings from Changer's Bane. I hope to have a few moments of the Abbot's time. It may be a matter of life and death." The paladin stumbles a bit as he speaks. "Although... I'm sure I'll need at least a short nap."

Agilnes nods. "Nolwen will find you a cot. Alwen, find a place for his steed to rest, and find feed for him. I will inform Liowen of your arrival."

Starguard says, "I'm afraid that we must change the order on those things. I must speak with the Abbot as soon as possible. We were attacked by the guards at the Keep, and they stole something the Abbot had loaned to us. We fear that Marrinan may be trying to provoke a war, against the Emperor's wishes!"

Agilnes blinks. "Indeed." He beckons Alwen closer. "Find him a cot. Stay with him. I will inform Liowen of his ravings." Turning on his heel, Agilnes strides away, leaving the two youngs guards behind to deal with the paladin and his steed.

Starguard scowls. "Ravings? We were escorting an Ambassador! Dammit, man! Do you understand what I'm saying?"

Starguard pushes past the younger guards and falls into step beside Agilnes. "We've spent the winter among the Changers. They've sent their emissary back with us. We must escort that emissary safely to the Emperor's court. We can't do that if we're fired upon by our own military."

Irritated, Agilnes looks at the paladin. "We have problems of our own to cope with, old man. You're obviously tired. You're not seeing things in proportion. Whether you know it or not, half the monastery is down with the flux, including our Father Abbot. The entire monastery is under a plague interdiction, and you should never have landed here, and you think we care about losing some bauble?"

Starguard keeps walking. "The damned bauble isn't meaningful. What's meaningful is the number of lives that will be lost if Marrinan provokes a war. How many more men will war kill than the plague? I've seen plenty of both." He sighs. "Speaking of which. I am a healer and herbalist of no small skill. If your seniors are stricken, perhaps I can aid in their recovery. Perhaps then you will listen to what I have to say."

Agilnes stops in his tracks. "You fool! You don't understand. By orders of the emperor, if you treat the sick, you will not be permitted to leave until the interdiction passes. As it is, it is only due to Brother Liowen's incredibly quick thinking that the interdiction is not complete and you may be permitted to leave at all." He turns away from the larger building to a small tent city, where he holds up a tent flap. "We live out here now. There's a cot in there. Sleep. Brother Liowen is out gather herbs and will return in an hour or so."

Starguard grunts and heads for the tent. "Then I will sleep for an hour or so."

Some time later, a gaunt, tired looking Liowen steps into the tent where Brother Starguard is catching a few moments rest. He taps Brother Starguard on the shoulder, lightly, and then sits on a small stool, next to the cotThe precise, snotty bureaucrat from last year is completely gone; what's left is an old, tired man, who has seen a lot of things in the past short while he wishes he hadn't. "Well, Brother Starguard. I am advised that you have news for me?"

Starguard just looks at the old man for a moment. "I do. And you probably don't want to hear it. You look fatigued. I know you don't consider us the most credible... I believe the term you used was 'ragamuffins'... but I think you have to hear what news I bring. And perhaps I must hear what has happened in our absence. Is this plague present in other parts of the Empire?"

Liowen sighs. "Apparently. Possibly. We don't know. The Emperor, before we got into trouble, did mention that one of his sons was sick." He looks around. "We don't know where or how the sickness arrived, but it seems to be horribly contagious. Right now, we're teleporting the food inside."

Starguard scrubs his brow with a hand. "We spent the winter among the Changers and know none of this. They're ready to arrange for peace. We're bringing a diplomatic message from them to His Highness. I'm sure you know I don't lie; when we presented the guard with the gem so that they could call you and verify our bona fides, they shot at us instead. We feared what lies they might spread with it; but I guess that anything they say won't pass beyond the monastery's walls."

Starguard continues, "We had heard a rumor that one of the Princes had taken ill. Is it related to the plague? And what sort of plague is it, anyway? What are the symptoms?" He pauses a moment. "And teleporting the food inside... that's some powerful magic. I thought only the Abbot himself would be capable."

Liowen shakes his head, answering the questions in reverse order. "We have a few capable sorcerers in our brotherhood, and it's the only way to avoid contagion. The symptoms are two fault; diarrhea plus intense nausea, leading to almost immediate dehydration. As well, there are long running lesions on both the legs and arms, but not the torso. We don't know why."

Starguard waits a moment to see if there is more, then asks, "And the thing with Marrinan's garrison shooting at us? Can you think of any reason for that?"

Liowen shakes his head at first. "No. It doesn't make sense. After all, Marrinan is sworn to that fortress, as his son will be after him. They have a fairly unique relationship with the land there."

Starguard sighs. "Someone wants a war. Perhaps someone also wants a plague. They've got the one. We're trying very hard to prevent the other." He pauses again. "These symptoms are unknown to me. I asked before; do they have this plague in other parts of the empire? By your manner, and if the Emperor has heard of it, I'd imagine there must be. And if that many people have heard of it, then if there were a cure, it would be known by now. And if the cure is unknown to the Brothers of the Waters..." He trails off. _Stars! Why now?_

Liowen sighs. "A lot of people want war. Lurin has been gathering adherents, and with the birth of the new prince he's got more followers than ever. But only a fool would want this plague; it has no known cure that we can find. And believe me, we're looking. So far, nobody's survived. It seems to kill in about ten days, and the Father fell ill seven days ago."

Starguard's face turns ashen. "What magic have you tried?"

Liowen shrugs. "We've tried everything we could think of. Rolwen died two days ago, so we're having a bit of trouble finding possible cures in the library. Especially since nobody is healthy enough to enter the library." He sighs. "Rolwen was cranky, but he was ... good at finding things. He even learned to like cats."

After Liowen leaves, to grab a short nap, Starguard composes himself to pray. He finds himself torn between the need to help the Father, and the need to return to his friends. But his immunity, surely it would help him as he tried to help the abbot. After all, there aren't any other paladins at the monastery. There aren't many paladins at all; the gods talk to very few people directly. The decision is painful, the old Father risked so much, only a year go, to help his young friend, and to walk - or fly - away now ...

As he closes his eyes and centers his mind, Starguard calls to his gods, the Stars themselves, asking for guidance ... if he stays, will this bring weal, or bring woe? There is a sense of doom, and yet a sense of hope. Nothing conclusive, though, and he considers the other option, returning. The signs are similarly mixd. The sense he gets, more than any other, is that the one star counsels him to stay, while the other counsels him to rejoin his friends and companions.

Sighing, Starguard bows his head. When even the Stars offer no definitive answer, only his heart is left to guide him, and it seems to him that he can best serve the Empire here at the monastery. As a paladin, protected by the gods, he will be safe from this dreadful scourge, which will give him unlooked for oppotunities to aid the brothers; opportunities that their own healers undoubtedly lacked. Standing, heeaves the tent, and informs Liowen of his desire to stay. The old man looks surprised, and not entirely happy, but at the same time, if a man is willing to volunteer to nurse the ill ... who is Liowen to gainsay him?

Sacks of supplies are prepared, and handed to Starguard. His armour is carefully stored, since he'll have no need of it, and promises are made that care will be taken of his steed. Finally, he staggers into the monasstery, after carefully prying the door open.

---

The party discusses possible ways to enter the fortress while waiting for Starguard to return, and eventually decides on the sneaky route. Tilara will cast invisibility over the party, and the whole group will use the immovable rods to climb over the wall. The sorceress will ferry the rods back down, using her own spider-foot spell, a bit safer from discovery than dropping them over the side every time. Once inside, the group should have a good half-hour remaining to find a secure hiding place and work their way down to the dungeons.

The boy and the ambassadors will be left outside, and Zinzer will scry the walls to determine guard routines before the first move is made. The only problem is that Starguard is overdue, and there's no sign of him at all. Eventually, they decide they'll have to go in without him.

Zinzer spends over an hour talking to Marlin about the Keep; the ways in and out, the buildings, the guards, their movements, and especially his grand-uncle the usurper, and the mage in his employ. He takes down the details in his notebook, and makes a plan for scrying on the Keep to confirm the lad's observations, and fill in any gaps in his knowledge.

Zinzer thinks, _Just one wizard among them, perhaps. A small cohort of people, probably much like this White Company, only... not so noble. If I could just get my hands on that man's spellbook... well... things could only get better._

In the hour just after dusk, Zinzer once again pours our a bowl of water and waits for it to still, and casts his spell on the miniature reflecting pool. The inside of the keep swims into view. The guards make their normal rounds, just as Marlin described; as to the plague, some of the people inside do indeed appear to have lesions on their arms, and move listlessly. _All of a sudden I'm not so eager to go in there..._ Zinzer continues to watch the grounds for many minutes to see if anything else of interest appears.

After the scrying, the White Company gathers together. They've got the equipment they need and everything else is left at camp. Carefully, they creep closer to the fortress under cover of nightfall, until they run out of concealing cover and Tilara helpfully casts invisibility on her compatriots.

A quick stroll and a short climb later, and the party has gained the wall, and entered the castle completely unobserved. Sometimes the right spell and te right tool really does make life a lot simpler. Now to find the cells ... Scuffling steps, as the party slides across the courtyard and collects besides the entrance to the dungeons. A door that is very definitely closed, and locked.

Tilara makes quick work of the lock, and soon they are able to slip through the doorway.

As Tilara slips through the doorway, she feels a tingle, and something brush against her calf for a moment, before breaking away.

Tilara whispers a cussword. "Drat. I just broke a tripwire. Who'd put a tripwire behind a door to the dungeons?"

Zinzer whispers, "Someone who was expecting a rescue attempt. Check that thing out, see if there's a way we can... umm... undo it. And we've got to move fast."
