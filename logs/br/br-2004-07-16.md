# Birthright 2004-07-16

Stepping into the Monastery, Starguard looks around. The main area looks deserted at first, but the air is full of the smell of death. Moving forward a little, he sees that pallets were moved into the main hall, for ease of nursing, and that some of the patients died unattended. The others lie, moaning, unmoving.

Starguard sighs. It takes him back, these rows of dying to many years ago... He quickly tries to flag down a nurse. While all of these people need his help, the Abbot must come first.

Starguard's instinct is foolish, though. There are no nurses here. Walking through the halls, he can feel the contagion in the air, stepping past the rows of beds, looking for a familiar face, heading towards where he remembers the Abbot's room is. His footsteps echo earily on the stone floor, only the occasionally moan punctuating his movements.

Stepping into the abbot's room, after a brief knock on the door, Starguard sees the abbot lying helpless on his bed. The old man looks as frail as he always did, but the lesions now cover his limbs, as they lie on the bedclothes, pale and trembling. Stained bedclothes, where he hasn't been able to contain his bodily reactions. His eyes flicker at Starguard's entrance, and beyond him the pale crystal ball pulses faintly.

Starguard goes slowly to the old man's side, trying to smile reassuringly. It's been so long since he had to do this sort of thing. Still. "Hello, Abbot. Let's see if we can do something about this nasty cold you have," he says, trying to make the old man smile as he gathers himself, asking the Stars help to rid the old man of the disease...

Starguard places his hands on the Abbot's chest, careful not to hurt him, calling on the Stars, his wooden twinned starbursts hanging down from his neck, free in the air. Soon it, and his hands, are glowing with the power of his deity, sweat forming on the paladin's head as his power chases the disease...but somehow, it's not working. The disease slips around his attacks like a skilled fencer, flowing around into the places he clears...the paladin groans, his ability to call the power expended. "Dammit. Tricky little thing..."

Starguard sighs. "My apologies Abbot, but brute strength isn't going to work, apparently. I will have to study a bit. Don't worry. I'll come up with something." Starguard tries not to look worried. His powers failed... Well, he's got more than just his faith. The Gods help those that help themselves.

Starguard soon is able to figure out the symptoms. It's quite simple, really. They're drying out. The bodies of the dead and dying are so light that it's easy to carry them to one corner of the main hall, which makes it easier to tend them, giving them as much water as they can drink, in hopes of at least slowing the disease while he studies in the meantime, trying to find some mention in the books of the clerics of such a plague in the past.

Unfortunately, the more water the patients ingest, the more they vomit, causing them to weaken even faster.

Starguard studies the water, shortly, creating some of his own for comparison. Perhaps the contagion is in the water?

The water appears, at first, similar. It's hard, after all, to discern differences. On second thought ... even on second thought, he can't discern differences. The water he creates himself has the same effect. The more water he gives the patients, the more water they expel, and it seems as though they always expel slightly more fluids than he was able to feed them, leaving them with a net loss, drying them out further ...

Starguard is flummoxed for a time. Water in either end isn't helping as it's not staying inside them. Obviously he needs to add water to their bodies, but...he searches the libraries for an answer, trying to find a way to get water into their systems.

Starguard tries a new tactic. Sweat and lost moisture are the enemies, so he soon arranges lukewarm baths for the seven, with their heads carefully above water. If nothing this should help somewhat...

The baths leave the patients feeling cleaner and more comfortable, especially when they're placed on clean bedding afterwards. There's no obvious change, beyond that, in their health though, and they remain as moribund as always, barely conscious. The abbot wakes only for a few moments at a time, his eyes flickering open and trying to catch Starguard, trying to convey some message.

Starguard comes over to the abbot at those times. "Can you squeeze my hand when I'm headed down the right path? Is it animal? Vegetable? Mineral?"

The abbot closes his eyes, a look of utter despair carved into his expression.

Starguard hmms, and tries what paladin powers he has, checking the area for evil influences with his will, then trying simply to heal the abbot without removing the disease.

Starguard lays his hands on the abbot, calling forth the simple healing powers of his faith.

Casting around carefully, Starguard doesn't detect any evil influences at work, although the disease ravaging these men seems evil enough in action, if not in intent. However, the laying on of hands seems to definitely ease the abbot. The lesions mend and while he still can't hold the water down, his colour becomes a little less pale, and a cursory examination suggests that he may be able to hold his own until the disease runs its course.

Starguard, surprised at his success, tries to use a spell to cure another, with little effect. Helplessly, he watches through the night, tending the seven, but when the sun rises, only four remain, including the abbot. His prayers fill him with power, and gently, he does his best to save those that remain.

Meanwhile, back at the fort, the White Company is gathered in the main hall with Marrinan and Firion, the latter under both guard and in a lot of chains. Not to mention a plethora of ropes. Defeated, now, Firion has freely ordered his men to put down their arms and surrender, and they in turn have traded places with Marrinan's men in the barracks.

Or they would have, were it not for the presence of plague in the barracks, and the refusal of the soldiers to enter the arracks. For now, they sit, sullenly, in the training square, kept under watch and guard.

Ash and the rest of the White Company have many questions for Marrinan and Firion. Most of them boil down to two major topics: the plague (where it came from, if it's related to Firion's power bid, and - especially - how to cure it), and the political situation surrounding Changer's Bane (why here, why now, and what else is happening in the empire, along with who's making it happen).

Both Firion and Marrinan speak freely, if - in Firion's case - somewhat bitterly. The plague ... well, Firion knows most of that, since it seems to have hit the castle only after his arrival. Vomiting, diarrhoea, and lesions, and invariably fatal. Marrinan looks surprised at this, and worried, and sends one of his men off to quarantine those who are ill, lest the disease spread further.

As for the keep ... Firion was in search of a safe place to live out the coming civil war. The one Lurin is set start soon.

Tilara says, "And our healer is off at the Brotherhood of the Waters, and overdue. We need to contact him. Where's our crystal, Firion?"

Firion shrugs. "I left it on the hearth, over there. It's probably still there."

Tilara mutters to her familiar as she goes to find the crystal. "I _said_ we might just have to assassinate him before this is all over."

Zinzer glowers at Firion. "And what of those who would die? What kind of madman starts a civil war just for the hell of it? What kind of man would aid him in doing so?"

Tilara comes back with the crystal and wand. "Be fair, Zinzer. He _said_ he was just finding a safe place to wait it out. Sounds like he had second thoughts about the whole thing."

Firion shrugs at Zinzer. "What kind of man waits forever to inherit? What kind of man makes his sons wait until they weaken and die, what kind of man never steps aside when his children are ready to take up the plough and the sword? These are the sons _and_ the daughters who start the civil war, and who will fight it to the end."

"That man is a fool," adds in Ash, quietly. "Inheritance is not a right. It is a gift from father to children. Gifts cannot be taken by force."

Tilara says, "And if the father's powers are as strong as ever, and he has serious doubts about the wisdom of his heirs? His duty is to the Empire, not to a pack of ambitious offspring."

Firion shrugs. "These are the men who will fight. I just want a safe place to wait. With young Marlin to control the power of this keep, I could have outlasted any civil war."

Growling, Marrinan slaps Firion. "My son will never be your pawn."

Tilara says, "He's waiting in the woods with the Ambassador we were escorting, Marrinan. We can have him here in an hour, if you want to risk it. So far the plague has stayed contained here."

"Any civil war is going to be very short," Zinzer grunts. "And if you outlive it, Firion, it may not be for very long."

"Easy, Marrinan. Yer son is safe fr'm Firion now," remarks Andreth calmly to the lord of the Keep. He then regards the prisoner evenly. "And now what shall we do with ye, to make _sure_ 'e stays safe from ye?"

Looking at Andreth, Firion decides to stay mum, for now.

Ash goes to retrieve Marlin, along with Meliandre and Azaril, and the four return a little later. Along the way, the swordsman has explained the situation to the two Changers, along with a slightly whitewashed version for the young man - though children become adults in time, and faster still when events force them to mature, but Ash is not inclined to push the process even more.

And in the high room, with the White Company and its prisoner and the Keep's master assembled, Ash bows low to Azaril and Meliandre. "I wish to apologize for the delay," he says as he rises, "and the trouble we've brought upon you. It was unjust to ignore our obligations to you for the sake of the Keep. It would have been equally unjust to ignore the situation here. I made a choice, and my friends made it as well. This was an irresponsible act, but I hope you will continue to travel with us." Turning, he regards Marrinan and Marlin. "We wish to go to our friend at the Brotherhood, who may know more about the plague. From there we go to Citadel. Our companions here willing, we will take one or both of you as an emissary, or any message you wish to bring to the Emperor."

Marrinan sighs. "While you were gone, Ash, I went to examine those who were ill, and I am sorely troubled. I do not recognize what they have, nor do I know how they became ill. There seems to be little logic to the way they became stricken while others remained healthy." He pauses, and looks at his son.

"Our companion is a priest of the Stars, and a man of strong faith and great wisdom where health is concerned," says the swordsman. "He is the best hope we know to turn the tide of this evil."

Zinzer says, "Perhaps we should remain here for a few days, to give Starguard a chance to return. His healing skills may be necessary here, and we could raise some sort of signal to indicate that our situation here is resolved."

Ash nods slowly. "Go or stay, we must consult with him one way or another," he says. "Tilara, the crystal? We may as well try it."

"Marlin, you have sworn to help these young men ... and young ladies, too. You have sworn to aid, and to abet them, in their endeavours, and the land has accepted your vow." Marlin nods at his father. "I think, son, you should travel with them to the emperor." Marlin nods again.

Tilara gets out the wand and the crystal ball and sets it up. "Let's see who's answering. C'mon, Liowen..."

In the monastery, the crystal ball pulses brightly, and then rings lightly in the abbot's room.

Tilara tries a few times. "I _know_ I'm doing this right. No one is answering." She gets a rather disturbed look on her face. "Does anyone remember the symptoms of that disease that was threatening the Citadel while we were there? I'm getting very concerned here. Liowen was always right there to yell at us whenever we activated this thing before."

Andreth's brow knots. "Something's gone wrong, maybe? Try again..." He too begins to look worried.

Once more, the crystal ball pulses brightly, and rings in the abbot's room.

Zinzer's brows knit. "Everyone have enough to eat? Because the way I count, we've got three of the Four Horsemen, all we need now is Famine to make an appearance."

A few minutes later, a ringing fills the throne room, as the orb comes to life. After a moment, Starguard's voice is emerging, telling the party about the plague, and the few that will be able to recover.

Tilara says, "Lovely. We've got a bit of a plague problem here, too. What's the cure?"

Starguard says, "If it's the same one, the hands of a Paladin, unfortunately. Though lukewarm baths help a little. Lesions, vommiting, diarreha, severe dehydration?"

Tilara says, "That's the one, all right. D'you think it's the same one we saw back in Citadel last fall? How widespread is this?" She goes on to give a quick rundown on what they've found out from Fiorin. "Is Liowen or the Abbott still alive? We need to pass this on to the Emperor as quick as we can."

Starguard says, "Both are. The Abbot was among the four I saved, and Liowen managed to avoid catching it, thank the Stars. I'll ask the Abbot, as he is feeling better."

Tilara nods, then realizes that's useless. "I'm pretty sure they had another way to pass messages quickly. We could use you back here, but if this is widespread you may be of more use back there."

Starguard says, "The one in Citadel was unrelated, Tilara. I think I've done what I can here, though. I'll be back as soon as Liowen will let me end the quarentine. Trying to get him to budge off a rule is like trying to nudge a house a few inches..."

Tilara chuckles. "So call Windrider over the wall and leave. What's he going to do?"

Zinzer says, "Umm... Tilara... what if it's contagious? Most plagues are, are they not? That's what makes them plagues."

Starguard says, "Not much, admittedly. But he does have a point. I could bring it with me. If it's air borne, I could spread it where I pass, as well."

Zinzer says, "If Starguard is a carrier he should stay where he is. The other Brothers may have the magic to enforce their will on him."

Tilara says, "What, while flying past? Just stay away from other folks, and go right in with the sick ones here. Should be safe enough."

Zinzer says, "If the only cure is the hands of a Paladin, that tells us very little about the cause."

"Firion's mage got 'em just fine when we tried dat a couple days ago", Andreth points out.

She sighs, acknowledging the point. "I just hate to lose any more of these soldiers than we have to. From what Firion's told us, we'll be needing them soon."

Starguard says, "I'm afraid I'm stuck here, Til. See if you can find another paladin?"

Zinzer says, "Another paladin? The only people we have here who might qualify for that ... is ... Marinnan ... and ... Marlin." He trails off and looks sidelong at the two nobles.

Tilara glances at Zinzer, and then at the father and son. "Indeed..." She clears her throat. "Marinnan... how connected to the land here are you, exactly?"

Zinzer says, "Hold on a minute, Brother. We have to check something here."

Marrinan blinks. "Well ... it's difficult to explain." He pauses. "I can't leave, my vows have bound me here, but I know who passes here, and the land protects me as long as I serve it."

Zinzer says, "You can't leave, but your son can... and he has some of the same abilities that you do. The land is also a form of god... its own divine institution, if you will."

Zinzer says, "I think that the two of you are the same manner of man as our Starguard."

Tilara says, "Hmm. According to our healer, he's stuck with the Brothers of the Waters, who have the same plague as your people here. Can you cure people? Heal them by touch? He says that's the only thing he's found that can keep folk alive long enough to shake off this disease."

Marrinan nods. "Marlin is still young, and he hasn't made his final vows yet. Those he will make when he is ready, and when he chooses to. He knows what they are. He must. But ..." He pauses. "I can infuse my people with the strength of the land. If that is what he means, then I can share that with them, and to a lesser degree, so can young Marlin."

Starguard pipes up. "Just a little bit helps a lot, so you can spread that strength among many," he suggests.

Ash listens to all this, and finally nods. "If this infusion will not cost you greatly," he says, "it may be enough. I urge you to try it."

Tilara says, "I... don't know if he means that or not. But if it's the same thing that our paladin can do, you can save at least some of your people..." She turns back to the crystal. "You were listening, Starguard? Tell us everything you know about it. We'll do our best here without you."

Marrinan shakes his head. "The land shares her strength. I will try it, and so will young Marlin. While you learn from your friend, if you will excuse us?"

Starguard says, "Good luck. I'll keep the orb near, and we'll see if we can find anything in the library to help."

After a little time passes, Marrinan and his son return, looking a little more worn, their shoulders a little more stooped. Still, there are wide smiles on both their faces, suggesting that their attempts were eminently successful. And indeed, the strength of the land was enough, it would seem, to halt the disease, and strengthen those who were ill. Time will still be needed, for a full cure, and rest, but the worst of it is over.
