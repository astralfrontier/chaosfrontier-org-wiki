After restoring Marrinan's control of Changer's Bane, the White Company sets off down the road to Woolwich. After this past year, they should be reaching their hometown just in time for the Spring hiring fair. And so much has changed. Young Marlin is full of questions, that he shares with everyone, chattering indiscriminately frm the back of his pony. By the end of that first evening, however, Zinzer is feeling quiet, withdrawn, and just a little dizzy. Not to mention nauseous.

Zinzer drags his feet through the day, sweating profusely, and griping a lot. "Dammit, slow down, have mercy on an old man," he says, just in time for his first occasion of vomiting into the bushes by the side of the road. "Oh, Hell."

Zinzer stumbles to his feet, leaning heavily on his staff. "Maybe you should leave me."

Andreth has observed the wizard's behavior during the day, and sighs as Zinzer stops to feed the plants. "Damnation. Ye're comin' down with summat, Zinzer, aren't ye?" He glances hopefully at Marlin. "D'ye know if there's anythin' ye can do fer him?"

Marlin bites his lip. "I can try. Father showed me how, and the land is strong here ..." He looks around. "If you make a bed for him, and ... and have him lie down, and ..." He looks a little pale. "I'll do what I can."

Tilara says, "If you can't do it now, you can wait until tomorrow. He'll live that long, I'm sure. I think we'd better either go back tomorrow or make camp here until we're all over it.... one way or another."

Ash stops, nodding in assent. "We'll do that now," he says. "But if he cannot be helped, Starguard is our destination, rather than Woolwich. We can't afford to fall on the road to an invisible foe - this is too important." He casts a brief glance back to the Changers.

Zinzer says little. He's been close enough to death before, and is in no hurry to live or die.

Andreth nods to Ash. "Aye. An' I don' wanna be takin' a plague victim inta me hometown. 'Sides, who knows how many o' the rest of us are carryin' it too, an' he's just the first to show the signs? We were alla us exposed just as much as 'e was."

"If Zinzer's stricken, we all must assume we are too," replies Ash grimly. "Marrinan's cure was not lasting, it seems." And so saying, he moves to grant Marlin's wish, and arrange a place for Zinzer to lie down. "No sense in waiting," he explains.

After the pallety has been prepared, Marlin leans over Zinzer, his small hands held wide. His eyes are wide open, and then he reconsiders, screwing them shut as he begins to mumble. His shoulders straighten, muscles tensing as his small body settles into a meditative pose that seems to sink into the earth. Slowly, his hands begin to glow faintly, ever so faintly, before the glow begins to cover Zinzer's body. Moments later it winks out, leaving Zinzer feeling much better but with a small boy sprawled all over him, unconscious.

Tilara says, "Marrinan didn't _try_ to cure us, Ash. We weren't sick when we left, and we hadn't been close to the barracks. If we're well enough to travel tomorrow, we go back, not forward."

Zinzer carefully extricates himself and leaves the lad on the pallet. "I hope he didn't over-exert himself. I'm not worth the effort."

Zinzer says, "Whatever we are going to do, let's do it fast. I don't know if this is a cure or a palliative. And in either case the boy will need to rest."

Andreth shakes his head. "We canna travel much further tonight in any case," he says, as he sets his pack on the ground. "And we shouldna travel till the boy's recovered. O'er dinner we'll discuss whether we should go on, or go back." He nods to Ash. "I'll go find firewood."

Zinzer says, "We cannot go to Woolwich like this, lest we infect the town."

Soon, the bedrolls are set out about a roaring fire as night begins to fall. "Now afore we decide where we'll go tomorra, we should make sure we all get through the night," remarks Andreth, looking around at his companions. "If ye're on watch and ye feel e'en a little dizzy, wake up someone else _right away_. Better for someone ta lose a little night's sleep than us all to get et by wolves or summat cause the man on watch passed out."

Tilara nods. "Not to mention it's hard to keep a good watch if you're feeding the bushes..."

The night passes quuietly, and uneventfully, and even Zinzer wakes in the morning feeling amazingly chipper, considering what he felt like the night before. Breakfast is a little burnt, and the smell is a little harsh to Tilara's tender sensitivities, but other than that ...

Tilara says, "Is it just me, or is breakfast a bit ... off? We're going to have to bypass Woolwich, I'm afraid, and head straight to the Brothers."

"Marlin," says Ash, once everyone's woken, and the swordsman is sure the lad is feeling well, "how resistant are you, because of your bond, to this plague? If you are neither carrier nor victim, you can approach Woolwich while we hang back and find out how things stand. We'll stay in sight of you. Are you willing and able?"

Marlin looks uncertain, as only a young boy can be. "I ... I ... ummmm. Father ... I think I won't get sick. I think as long as I serve the land, the land will serve me." He looks up at Ash, scared and worried. "I don't know?"

Ash nods slowly. "If you don't know, I won't ask you to risk it," he says in a quiet voice. "Company - to the Brotherhood, or do we risk Woolwich?"

Tilara sighs. "Would we risk _any_ town when we're possibly carrying a plague? The only reason to go there would be to see if it's spread to them... but if we meet anyone on the road, we could spread it that way as well. Best we leave the road as soon as possible."

Zinzer says, "The Brotherhood, says I. The risk is too great that Marlin may be carrier. Or even carry it with him on his clothes."

Andreth nods in silent agreement. His companions have already spoken what is on the monk's mind.

"I feel the same," says Ash. "Starguard's talent is unparalleled. If he has a cure, we can carry it to Woolwich. If he doesn't, we won't live for long without him anyway."

Having decided, the White Company decides to forsake the pleasures of family, friends, and the Spring Fair, and concentrate on reaching the Brotherhood as quickly as possible, striking off cross country. A trip that is slowed down somewhat both by the need to avoid civilization, and by Tilara and Ash's growing realization, throughout the day, that they, too, have come down with this, whatever this might be.

Tilara mutters to herself as the day goes on. "I really wish I'd been wrong about this..." Mirra mrrows in concern at the growing discomfort in her mistress's mind.

Ash spends little time being physically ill, though his face is pale with effort as the Company travels. He does what he can to bear up; though a big man, his tempers and humors have sometimes fought against his constitution, and now he must substitute willpower and determination for his normal reserves of energy.

Zinzer says little, but walks with cautious strength. "Perhaps if it's caught early, it can be supressed. I'm still feeling better."

Tilara says, "How about you, Marlin? I'm afraid we've got another job for you if you're up to it."

That evening, the company makes its camp listlessly. Dragged down by fears of how far the plague might have spread, and with two of the White Company still under the specter of infection, some of the usual vigor of the group has been sapped. Even the fire's crackle seems muted, reluctant to show a spark of life beyond what is necessary.

Zinzer says, "How is it that only men such as Starguard, Marrinan, and Marlin can stop this thing? No other plague is so virulent. There must be another answer. I can't believe this is natural."

Marlin looks at Tilara, and nods resolutely. "I promised to help, and ..." He looks at her. "Are you feeling sick now?"

Andreth shakes his head at Zinzer. "The Brothers o' the Waters may be a book-learnin' order rather than a healin' one, but we know they have great healers among 'em." He fingers the scar at his throat idly. "An' yet the Abbot 'imself fell ill. This cain't be natural."

Tilara had managed only a very little bit of dinner, and responds to the boy by stumbling off into the bushes and retching up what little food she'd eaten. "Afraid so...."

Zinzer says, "Perhaps some good may come of it. We need more people of that kind. And if this plague brings them to the fore..." He trails off. "But so much death, just for that? Do the Gods insist we suffer so, or do we bring it upon ourselves?"

Andreth rubs his chin, adopting the rather strained expression that is his wont when thinking hard. "The Gods do no' act as one, Zinzer. Each of 'em is as different from another as we mortals are. It could be just one God that brings this plague in 'is or 'er madness. Or mebbe... somethin' like a God but not a God?" He waves a hand distractedly, unable to express the dark thought that has come to him.

Marlin nods at Tilara. "Well, I'll try?" He takes a deep breath, downwind from Tilara's leavings and turns a little green. Moving to the side, he gulps, but prepares to help her. "If you will lie down ..." Once more, as before, he tenses and, eyes screwed shut, prays carefully to the land and the Mother Earth, letting the glow take him, and through him her, before collapsing in a sprawled boneless heap.

"It's no good asking the Gods for something they won't help with," says Ash, from where he lays. Reclining helps somewhat, provided he keeps his head propped up, and only his lips move - the rest of his body remains prone as he conserves energy. A technique taught to stave off hunger; he hopes it will help here too. "Marlin's blessing, you see," he adds, nodding toward the prone boy. "Somebody somewhere stretched forth his hand, but.. the healing magics the Brothers can muster weren't sufficient, apparently."

Tilara says, "And they tap into the God's power. What if ... there are other Gods? Opposed to ours?"

Tilara gets up once Marlin has worked his magic, and gently tucks him into his bedroll. She looks at Meliandre and Azaril. "How are you two holding up? Any sign of illness yet?"

Meliandre smiles wryly. "So far, we seem to be holding up." She sighs. "But I like this not. Perhaps this is not the time to visit the emperor after all ..."

"Now.. best time," murmurs Ash from where he lays, cracking a faint smile and controlling a momentary shudder. "In troubled times, important to see who your friends are.. The Emperor needs allies."

Tilara nods. "As long as we can cure the disease, it shouldn't be a problem."

Azaril nods. "You speak wisely, young man. And we can't return, risking our friends's health. We will press on."

During the night, on Andreth's watch, the plague-ridden swordsman begins to ramble to himself in a thick, slurred voice. Whether or not it's a fever brought by plague, or simply the bad dreams of a man who's been through much over the past few days, isn't clear. "No, no.." mutters Ash, in seeming protest to himself. "Not like that.. not.. following that man's footsteps..."

Andreth, mindful of his responsibilities to the party as a whole, keeps his ears well attuned to the night sounds of the forest - but kneels by Ash's bedroll, keeping watch over him. "Whose footsteps, Ash?" he murmurs softly, hoping the question will carry into his companion's fever-dreams.

"Haha.." The fighter chuckles and licks his dry lips, managing a smile. "Fir... that man.. got what I always wanted.. Command of a fortress... men under me... took no honor or station in life at all, just swords and guts.. could do it myself, if I wanted, instead of doing.. all of this. Could go take over..You think I'd live long, if I did that, my friend?"

Andreth's brow furrows. Suddenly, he is reminded of the short distance from here to that farmhouse - the farmhouse where he and his companions first met a man in the service of a cruel bandit and saw a diamond in the rough. "The question is, could you live with yoursel'? Knowing that you'd come to yer high place knowin' it's cause you stood on the backs o' innocent men?"

"Easier that way, though," whispers the fighter with a half smile, his voice a tad rusty. "Easier not thinkin' about such matters. Too much travel.. opens the eyes. But, the more you think, the more you see the reasons why.. men like him, and the princes, men want power.. I do too, I don't deny it.. " He falls silent for a moment, seemingly perceiving the direction of the monk's thought. "Yes, I'm remembering when you met me," he confirms. "I've grown. But.. I've seen men, great and important men, do just what Ferg did.. and I wonder, why am I really here.." But his voice seems to already know the answer. He simply doubts, like any man facing an approaching doom must.

Andreth says quietly. "Ye know well, Ash. We're here fer the men Ferg tramples, and those like 'im." He rises. "Now rest, me friend. We'll take care of ye. We take care o' our own. That's what Brother Oak taught me." And with that, Andreth resumes his vigil in the night.

This day's travel goes more slowly still; Marlin is beginning to look drawn, even after the party left the boy to sleep as late as he liked. The land hereabouts is wild, with brambles, thorns, and bushes the like pulling at the horses, and slowing progress down. Still, with a bit of luck, a day or two should see the company to the brotherhood ...

Zinzer thinks, _It's not right, to burn the young man out like that... and I think I owe him my life. Perhaps there's a way he can help without giving so much?_

Zinzer slows and falls back to walk with Marlin. He speaks simply and declaratively. "I would not have survived the disease on my own. I owe you my life." He indicates the rest of the Company with a wave of his hand. "I'm not one of them and I don't share their oath. And that means that you weren't sworn to assist me. Do you know what that means?"

Marlin shrugs. "The oath I made was to the group. You were a part of the group." He tilts his head towards the Changers. "I promised to aid my cousin, and you, and the White Company. Father says vows are made with _people_, not companies."

Zinzer shrugs. "Perhaps. Debts are also between people, and my debt to you is seperate from my debt to them. I am a selfish man, Marlin. I'm not one that any ruler would want making decisions. But... I can act like a just man when I have to. I have little to give except my knowledge. So if you wish, I will teach you. Your magic is not mine, but the stuff of history may be known to any who listen."

Zinzer says, "Also... the way you've healed us, is a strain on you. Perhaps I can think of a way to make it less so, so that you don't completely exhaust yourself each time. More will need you, before this is done. It is not fair to you that it should harm you so much... oath or not, duty or not."

Mirra drops back quietly to see how the boy is doing, and Tilara joins a moment later. "You look tired, Marlin. Are we still in your lands?"

Marlin smiles and bounces, almost. "Thanks, Zinzer." His eyes lighten a little. "I always enjoyed learning ... father said I needed t know who our Princes were." Turning to look at Tilara, he nods. "I ... think so." He shakes his head. "It's funny. Dad - Father says he can't leave the keep, that he's sworn to the land, but that I can travel freely, and that the Mother will carry me wherever I go."

Tilara nods. "We're working you hard, though, and Ash will need your help tonight if you can give it... but your health is important, too. Let us know if you need to rest. Ash will live to make it to the Brothers if need be."

Marlin nods, and looks worriedly at Ash. "I ... uh ... I hadn't noticed he ... uh ..." He straightens up. "I can help him. Just have him lie down. The land is ..." He looks worried now. "I don't understand why everyone's getting sick." Behind him, Azaril folds up too, collapsing into Melisandre's startled arms.

Zinzer stares at Azaril and Melisandre. "Oh. Perfect."

Tilara says, "Or... oh, dear. I thought he was feeling all right. Damn fool thing to do, hiding symptoms of something like this - unless it came on suddenly?" She heads back toward Melisandre, offering her help to deal with the suddenly ill Cat.

Andreth says, "It just keeps gettin' better, don't it?" mutters Andreth wryly. The gods have smiled on him so far, but he doesn't know how long his own luck - and his health - will last. "Lad, none of us know why we're gettin' sick. An' I just hope we'll all make it to where we'll have some hope o' findin' out. Cos find out we must. What's happenin' ta us here is surely happenin' a hundred other places on the Flatlands. An' who knows if it'll spread beyond e'en that."

Zinzer says, "Is there any way we can speed this up? It seems imperative we reach sanctuary, even though it might be hard on our mounts."

Azaril lies unconscious on the ground, his face pale and his brow burning up. Melisandre, after placing her cloak under his head as a pillow, and covering him with his own, looks worried. "Normally, he's more resistant to disease than most."

Tilara says, "We'll have to tie Azaril and Ash into their saddles if we do."

Slumping over in his saddle, Ash steers his mount shakily toward Marlin, as Tilara moves back in the train to attend to the Changer. "I'm not the one with a possible alliance for the Emperor," he mutters thickly, jerking his head back in the direction of Azaril. "They've gotta make it."

Tilara says, "You're not as sick as he is, yet, either, Ash. Marlin? You feel up to it?"

Marlin nods. "I'll heal him. Then lash us to the horses, and ride?"

Tilara says, "Straight through, if we can."

After a third, exhausting effort, Melisandre herself cradles the young boy in her lap, while Azaril is tied onto his horse, as is Ash, and the party makes full speed - slow as that might be - for the Brotherhood. All night, the party rides, and throughout much of the following day, arriving late that afternoon at the encampment outside the monastery, where they are summarily challenged, and bid to wait until Liowen himself steps forth.

The old man looks tired, and grumpy. "Your friend is in the monastery. He's saved the abbot. There's a quarantine. We can't help you. Go away."

Zinzer murmurs to Tilara, "Are all your old friends on this road so hospitable? Or did I misunderstand your tale when you said you went through this land sowing works of good?"

Tilara motions Liowen to stay back. "Some of us are ill, as well - we've come cross-country to avoid other people. We'd prefer to enter the quarantine until we're all cured." She chuckles to Zinzer, and murmurs "You should've seen his attitude _before_ we helped them out."

Liowen blanches. "You are." He takes several steps back. "Well, head into the monastery. Brother Starguard will be happy to see you, I'm sure. He's had his hands full. We'll keep providing food and water." He sighs. "Just don't use the monastery well. It's been fouled."

Zinzer says, "Fouled... how?"

Liowen shrugs. "I don't know how to define it. It's not so much that we got muck in it. Even in the shrine, the water isn't pure, and I _know_ we didn't throw up in the shrine."

Zinzer says simply, "That may be our answer. Let's go in."

Liowen nods. "By all means. The gates are open, of course. Just don't leave. Quarantine won't be lifted until the water runs pure."

Tilara says, "We'll keep that in mind. Uh, one other question - is there a fast way to contact the Emperor from here? We've been talking to Starguard via the crystal."

Liowen nods. "There's a crystal in the abbot's room. Once he's recovered, he should be able to use it. When we evacuated, and established quarantine, we had ... other things on our minds."

Throughout the arrival at the Brotherhood, Ash has been tottering in his saddle. He's the last of the Company's plague-victims, having denied healing so that Azaril's safety could be assured. He's content with that. Having lost sleep to nightmares where a Company much like his own destroys him at the moment of his glory in conquering a far-off fortress for his own, he's only half-aware of his fingers unsteadily picking at the ropes binding him to his mount. As the party passes into the quarantine area, he falls out of the saddle, hitting the ground.

The next thing he sees, as his eyes creak open, are a pair of stars, shining down from the heavens above with a knowing twinkle. The black sky is crowded with wavy lines as the stars murmur things to the fallen swordsman, words of comfort and healing, and as Ash blinks himself back to consciousness, he sees that they are not stars, but the eyes of a priest and champion, glistening with the half-formed moisture of tears. The night sky is his bearded chin, moving slowly as he speaks, and the rain falling from the heavens is the sweat on his brow as he exerts his divine gifts. "Not another soldier will fall on my battlefield," the old man is murmuring as he labors. "You'll be okay, lad."

Andreth breathes a sigh of relief. "Thank you, Starguard. It's been a long journey from Changer's Bane, and the poor lad Marlin wore 'imself ragged tryin' ta get us all here alive."

Starguard nods. "Aye, lad... and I'm glad you got here in time." The old cleric's brow furrows. "But why was young Marlin especially tired? Is it just that he's younger and couldn't keep up?"

Zinzer says, "Marlin and his father, as you may have guessed, share a bond with the land... they heal as you healed Ash. And many of us have taken ill, and would be incapacitated or dead but for Marlin's help."

Zinzer says, "It seems the 'land' is Mother to them... as the Stars are to Starguard."

Starguard's eyes light up with understanding. "Touched by the gods! Yes, yes that fits perfectly." In response to the puzzled expressions of his companions, he settles himself back, unconsiously adopting the pose of a tutor before his class. "Let me tell you a story, my friends. It's one you all learned in your youth, I'm sure, but now's the time to repeat it."

"In the beginning, there was Mother Earth and Father Sky," says Starguard. "They bore many children, as you well know, and among their sons was Muirwen. Muirwen saw that his mother's skin was seared by Brother Sun, and so he became the rivers, and the lakes, to soothe her."

"And so of all the gods, Muirwen is one of the most present in our lives, second only to his Mother, for the lakes and streams run everywhere. And yet he is also the most absent, for he pays little heed to the world." Starguard sighs. "And this is where the story comes to the present day, and takes a darker turn."

Starguard pauses, and goes on. "Of late, it seems that the waters of the world have run... fouled. And the taint is such that only those who have been chosen by the Gods themselves - like me, and like young Marlin and his father - who can begin to restore the balance."

Tilara looks aghast. "So... we've got to find a cure for Muirwen???"

Ash, now fully restored, is his usual self once more. "Somebody must. The more the better," he says firmly. "We must also discharge our obligation to our fellow-travelers."

Andreth grins crookedly, and touches the scar on his throat. "We've sought our own favors from th' gods. Looks like now's our chance ta return the favor."

"Surely if Starguard has realized what's happened, other clerics have too," observes Ash. "It seems that the greatest such holy men would be the place to go for answers, or to volunteer ourselves. Would they be found in Citadel, Starguard?"

Tilara says, "If they are, we've got to talk Liowen into letting us out."

Starguard chuckles at Ash. "That may be a place to start, at least. Certainly the biggest temples are there. Though we may find help in the unlikeliest corners. Was I to be found in Citadel? Or Marrinan, or his son?" He turns to Tilara, sighing. "I think the best way to 'talk' Liowen into lifting the quarantine is to give him reason to do so. To unfoul the wells of the Brothers of the Waters." He turns his gaze to everyone else, the stars twinkling behind his eyes. "If we are to heal the waters of the world, shall we not begin here?"
