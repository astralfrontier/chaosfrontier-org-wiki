# Birthright 2004-07-30

Situated under the cellars, in a large natural cave, the chapel is normally lit by large glowing orbs. Now the cave glows darkly, shadows hiding in every corner, as the orbs lie decomposing on the ground, their energies sapped and faded. Behind the altar that once held Andreth, the water from a spring is gathered in two bowls, one below the other, the lower one still faintly ornamented. But the ornamentations are crusted over with slime, green and black, that grows and spreads malignantly, stilling the once pleasant splash of the water into a nasty slurping drip.

Zinzer comes up short as he steps into the chapel. "Oh, my... this looks distinctly unholy. The sewers of Citadel run cleaner than this..."

Zinzer steps carefully towards the fountains. "Someone remind me why the Brothers consider this place sacred?"

"You noticed the device of Muirwen outside, as we approached?" asks Ash.

Zinzer says, "Yes... the Rivers and Seas... either the God Of, or literally, depending on your belief."

Tilara says, "We were here a year ago. It _was_ holy, then. You could feel it. This is.... wrong."

"But is this the cause or the symptom?" asks the swordsman, quietly. "In any event, it should probably be tended. I don't know if we're qualified to do that or not, though."

Tilara sighs. "I'm not. Maybe Starguard is. But if the Brothers themselves couldn't do it..."

Ash points out, "the Brothers were ailing badly. We should find out if anyone thought to come here, and if so what they thought upon seeing this."

She thinks about that for a minute. "On the other hand, the Brothers couldn't cure the disease, either. Maybe Starguard should try healing this place."

Zinzer prods the nasty slime with the tip of a dagger. "There's several ways to foul a well... one would assume that the Brothers would guard this one against any of the usual problems." The muck sticks disturbingly to the steel. "Which means that this must be a very unusual problem... I wonder if it's possible for a God to fall ill." He shudders at the thought.

Moving out of that rather depressing chapel, the party retreats to the abbot's room. Now that he's on the mend, he's been returned to his own room, where Starguard has been spending a lot of time tending him. The other three brothers have gotten, perhaps, a little less of Starguard's attention than they wish, but their basic needs have been met, and they've been able to keep one another occupied while he can concentrate on keeping the abbot alive. After all, the old man nearly died, and even now, he is still weak.

Ash describes briefly, in measured tones that conceal his own latent horror of the spectre this seemingly-divine plague has inspired in him over the last several days. He describe the condition of the fountain, and the shrine in general, holding his voice steady. "What does it mean?" he finishes, the question concealing a lack of answers and a plea for salvation.

The abbot struggles to a sitting position, aided by Starguard. "It means ... " His voice fades away, and he sips a little water, trying to regain his strength. "The gods ..." Again, he doesn't make it through the entire sentence. "Poisoned ..." Struggling, now, to convey his meaning in short simple phrases, he keeps trying. "The wells ... World ... Poisoned ... Rolwen ..."

Ash shakes his head slowly. "Rolwen can't help this time," he says in a soft, unsteady voice. "Starguard, can you do anything else for him?"

Zinzer steps forward from the wall, where he's been standing out of the old man's way. "Relax, venerable one. I think we understand. Just answer one question. A nod will suffice. This infection has many outlets... but is there a single source where the poison would originate? And a single source where we could clean it up?"

The old abbot looks gratefully at Zinzer. "Yes." Then he pauses and reconsiders. "No."

Zinzer nods slowly. "Yes and no? Both are true?"

Tilara says, "Is that yes to the first, and no to the second, sir?"

A deep breath. "Single source of poison." The old abbot leans back, exhausted. "God poisoned." There's a long silence, as he struggles for breath. "Poisoned again?"

Zinzer says, "That's enough. I think we can find the answer." He looks at the others. "They must have a library. Let me take care of this part, and let the old man rest."

"It seems that the library may be the place to learn more," murmurs Ash, after a moment, eyeing the abbot critically and showing visible concern over the man's health.

Tilara sighs, as her worst fear seems to be realized. "How could a God be poisoned? And how do you cure it?"

Zinzer says, "That's what we're going to find out."

Tilara turns back to the abbot. "Are they gods, or demons, or men? How do we find out?"

"The poison will tell." The abbot falls back. "Find the poison." A pause. "Before they use it again."

Tilara says, "Let's go find out, then."

The abbot rears up. "Find ... find the ones who ... who poison!"

Ash smiles a little. "We'll do our best," he promises.

Zinzer turns back to the Abbot as they depart for the library. "We shall. Although if things go the way they usually do, I'm sure they'll find us first."

After poring over several dusty tomes, and with several lucky finds for relevant volumes, Zinzer has located several relevant legends and tidbits of information. "It's not recorded that any of the Gods have ever been poisoned... but they can be coerced. Celidan once captured Luriel and fed him a powerful aphrodisiac... that's how he sired Far Seer."

A few more volumes later, Zinzer finds the origin of the spring. "It seems the Gods either heal naturally, or die of their injuries." He pauses as he considers that. "If that's so, it may be more than the Flatlands we have to worry about. In any case... the origin of the sacred font here is a set of caves far below the hills here. In some places they built pipes to bring it to the chapel... so there should be a way to reach it."

"Finally," Zinzer pedantically states, "The working of the plague, as we suspected, is more than merely physical. There's a spiritual component - a purging of waters. There's plenty of ways you can catch dysentary from mundane causes... but this is more like the body rejecting the concept of water to begin with. With fatal results." He shakes his head. "Water is everywhere. Muirwen has no one source. Any water is all water - so it's possible that poisoning one area could have effect over a huge distance. If there is a single source to cure, it's Muirwen himself. On the bright side... if any water is all water, an antidote introduced in one area could have a similarly wide effect."

"So our challenge is to find the nature of the poison, as the abbot hinted," suggests Ash. "Knowing that should suggest an antidote, which can be put to use more or less anywhere?"

Zinzer nods. "More or less. The closer to the hypothetical source, the better... so wells, rivers, and possibly Agla's sea would be the best places to put it. But since we're pressed for time... we'll probably have to use it locally."

Ash nods. "Alright then. We may also need to get past this quarantine. If this information is right, then no quarantine is meaningful anyway - wherever there is water, there will be sickness." He thinks a moment. "But for now, let's see if we can find whatever this source is."

Tilara says, "So we need to find out what the antidote should be, and then take it down to the source?"

Andreth adds, "We need ta find the people who poison, said the abbot. I wunner if'n we'll find some people what're poisonin' _this_ spring." He cracks his knuckles significantly.

Zinzer says, "If we do, Andreth, that means that they must have been in the Monastery to begin with. Or that there's an unknown way into those caves. Or possibly that they are still there." He glances at Ash. "You've only just recovered. Do you feel up to doing some damage?"

Ash curls his hand into a fist experimentally. "I'm not an old man yet," he says firmly. "I'll be just fine."

After explaining to the paladin and the Changers what will be happening, the remaining members of the White Company return to the Chapel to explore the source of the pollution. Based on the maps Zinzer has found, the pollution will lie in one of only one of six caves, if it can be reached at all. It's a simple matter of checking them out, one after the other. So after carefully packing the crystal, and leaving Starguard listening at the far end, the company starts exploring.

The shadows are darker than usual and seem to jump out, reaching and stretching for the young explorers.

The first cave is long and narrow, the water flowing through a man made trench in the centre. Moving quickly, the company advances into a second larger cave, where the stalactites and stalagmites reach out friendly hands, and the water drips from the ceiling.

Zinzer shouts as the party reaches the second cave. "Hey! What was that?" A globe of light flys from his hand towards a pool of shadows.

Shadows surround the party. Unnatural shadows. Shadows where light should be. Shadows that suck up the darkness. Shadows.

"Form up!" calls Ash quickly. "Zinzer, center!" He moves to where he ought to be, hand already on his sword hilt.

Andreth moves into position swiftly in response to Ash's command, then fires toward one of the formless shapes - muttering darkly as the crackling shaft passes right through the shade and clatters to the cave floor beyond.

Two shadows stretch, hungrily, reaching for Ash, their hands sliding through his armour, touching his skin, sliding into his skin, pulling out his strength and feasting on it.

Zinzer reaches out and pours magical strength into Ash, replacing much of what was stolen by the monsters. "Oh, Lord... I hope this works."

Ash steps forward, his sword moving and flashing in the magic lights the party brought. He swings it in a rapid spinning arc, catching one of the three shadow-creatures on the blade's edge, and a coruscant arc lights up his enchanted weapon as it comes close to ending the thing's unnatural existence. The forms of the other two flee from the oncoming light, only to regain their dark presence again in the wake of the blade's passing.

Tilara holds her hands out as two of the shadows approach. A few muttered words, and a spray of flame leaps out, but the shadows flow downward and away, escaping the full effect. "Stay with me, Mirra."

Which in turn completely destroyed their ability to counterattack, sadly enough.

Andreth gathers his energy about him, and the air crackles with the force of his punch. He curses, though, as the fist whistles through air without touching anything whatsoever.

Zinzer steps out of the ring to get a clear shot at two of the shadowy things that haven't been dealt with yet. Lightning flies from his fingertips in an arcane wave of destructive energy. The monsters give almost as good as they get, though, and Zinzer staggers back from their touch, noticeably weaker.

Again, the shadows reach for Ash, their fingers sliding through his armour, seeking out his strength and sucking it up ...

Again the swordsman swings his massive, magical blade. Again two of the shadows flee from its seeking edge. Again he connects at least once, doing considerable damage to the strength-sucking specter.

Tilara summons the flames again, the words harsh and somehow eerie in the echoing cave. One of the creatures disintegrates as the fire strikes it; the other slides away again, not destroyed, but unable to approach close enough to attack effectively.

Andreth, seeing that the shades are immune to his fists, wrinkles his nose as a foul-tasting potion goes down his gullet, and a shimmering wall of force appears beside him. Moving at uncanny speed, he dodges and weaves to put some distance between himself and his immaterial foes. Their claws rake him as he passes, and one of them draws a cry from him as it saps his strength.

Advancing slowly, one shadow reaches steadily for Zinzer. His clothes are not even the faintest hint of a barrier for freezinf fingers; where once the efreeti had introduced the fires of hell into Zinzer's life, now this shadow introduces the cold of the glacier's winds, as they blow through his soul. But all is not lost, behind him, the other shadows sink through the floor.

For a third time Ash moves, swinging to strike at the elusive shadow. Nevertheless he fails to connect every time.

Tilara mutters a different set of words this time. Three bolts of energy fly from her fingertips, two of them impacting the last shadow standing in front of her, dissipating it into black mist that falls to - and through - the floor of the cave. The third bolt impacts the last of the things, the one attacking Zinzer.

Andreth turns at the cave wall, and scrabbles in the quiver for one of the enchanted crossbow bolts. Unfortunately, in his weakened state, he misjudges the weight of the crossbow, and the bolt skitters across the floor, coming to a stop even before reaching the place where the remaining shade now stands.

Fingers stretching, enfolding the mage, seeking the warmth, the strength, the light that only Zinzer can provide ...

Zinzer is struck and weakens again, and panics, unleashing a powerful ice spell against the remaining monster... and unfortunately pummeling his comrades and himself for as much damage.

Tilara yelps as Zinzer's spell goes off, Mirra having run away as soon as the wizard started the spell. She shakes the ice out of her hair and snarls, "Idiot! Drop and get out of the way, I'm going to burn it!" She gives him a few seconds to comply, and then another sheet of flame burns the shadow where it stands.

Andreth trots to his companions as he puts the crossbow back on his belt, struggling slightly with the suddenly increased weight upon his back. "Gods... that was way too close," he comments. He glances pointedly at a nearby ice-stone, but otherwise doesn't remark on the wizard's hastily-cast spell. "We cain't handle things like that by oursel's. We need Starguard."

Zinzer just collapses to the ground. "Oh, hells..."

Ash carefully returns his weapon to its sheath, and nods. Even now, with the blessings of a god's might in his muscles, he feels weaker than he ever has. Carefully he walks toward Zinzer, offering a hand to help the other man back to his feet.

Zinzer staggers to his feat, leaning heavily on Ash. "They took quite a bit out of me... out of you too. I think we have to back off."

Tilara surveys her comrades, all of whom are moving with difficulty after the chill touch of the creatures. "I think we can safely say that something does not want us to get to the springs." She nods at Andreth's suggestion. "Agreed. Get you fellows back to your normal selves, and bring him along. This is not going to be a day at the fair. "

"I agree," says the weakened warrior, as he loops Zinzer's arm around his shoulder in support.

Carefully, the party works its way back toward the Brotherhood's enclave, feeling a lack in their arms, legs, and souls. Privately, as he half-heartedly assists Zinzer, Ash wonders about the shadows that assaulted them. Some remnant of the poison that corrupted Muirwen? Or a trap, set behind by the authors of that deadly deed?
