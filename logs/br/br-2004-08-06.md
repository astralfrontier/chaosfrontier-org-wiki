The White Company limps back into Starguard's makeshift infirmary. Some are wounded; some have been drained of their strength; some have suffered both predations. The encounter with the strange shadow-creatures is related to Starguard while the survivors arrange themselves on the floor.

Tilara comes in last, relatively unhurt but nearly drained of magical power after fighting the creatures off. "Never seen anything like that before. We need to look in the library."

Zinzer makes it as far as a straw pallete. "Bring the books to me. And possibly hold them open while I read... oh dear... I hope this isn't permanent..."

Starguard shakes his head ruefully. "Honestly, I can't leave you people alone for five minutes without the restless dead draining your souls..." he says, leaving the Abbot's side to attend to the physical injuries of his companions, though all he can do to attend to the uncanny draining is to make them comfortable. "I shall have to ask the Stars to help me restore your strength in the morrow."

Zinzer says, "Can we afford to wait here an evening? Do you think those... things... might follow us up here?"

Starguard shakes his head at Zinzer. "I've heard a few tales about the shades of the dead, but not many. I know they're motivated by hatred, but... whether they can travel far, I know not." He shakes his head, as Andreth starts to get up. "No, no, I insist! At least one full day of bed rest. You've all been sucked dry..."

Andreth returns to his pallet, shaking his head. "They faded through th'floor when they were leavin'..."

Ash is resting comfortably as well, his hands idly flipping a dagger about among his fingers, his eyes resting on his greatsword. The loss of his native brawn has unsettled him, if the tale told by his expression is any hint.

Tilara says, "They were tough to deal with. Magic seemed to work best on them."

Andreth shakes his head. "I couldna even touch 'em. I think it takes magic or summat ta even affect 'em." He nods to Starguard, significantly. "Or the power o' th' gods."

Starguard nods. "Yes, I suppose that would..." Something in Andreth's tone of voice gets through to him. "Hold on a moment, young lad. You're not suggesting I go down there with you, are you?" says the healer crossly. "Who'll take care of the abbot and the other monks when I'm gone?"

Zinzer raises his head off the floor. "Starguard... a lot of people died here... right?"

Without waiting for the cleric to answer, Zinzer continues, "So where are the bodies? They should be stacked up like cordwood."

Starguard nods grimly to Zinzer. "Yes... the plague was very virulent indeed. Nearly everyone who didn't escape to the quarantine zone, according to Liowen..." His brow furrows. "...You know, I have no idea. Odd, that..." he says, beginning to sound worried.

Zinzer eases his head back down to the floor. "That's bad news. How many?"

The old cleric stands up. "We should ask about that. The Abbot is still unwell, and I hate to disturb his rest, but this sounds like a very important question indeed."

Tilara says, "Maybe one of the others will know."

Zinzer says, "You could ask Liowen. Throw a note over the wall. And while you're at it, ask him if he's got anyone out there who's good at putting disturbed spirits to rest."

Starguard shakes his head. "From what Liowen told me..." he says, scratching his head. "I only found about ten corpses when I came in. So... we're about twoscore and ten bodies short."

Zinzer says, "Fighting these one at a time would be ill-advised. We need something more... comprehensive."

Tilara says, "I do hope we don't have to fight our way through all of them."

Zinzer says, "Do we still have that necklace that Firion had?"

Zinzer says, "We know magic hurts them. That's some powerful magic - fire magic. It may clear a path for us. In any case, we're not doing more today. And I need to re-memorize my spells." He stands and drops his pack, saving only his spell book. "I'll be in the library. Maybe I'll find something about putting lots of evil spirits to rest at once."

Starguard settles back into his chair, resting his chin in his hands. "How can we hope to deal with so many restless souls on our own? The Brothers could perhaps lay them to rest, but they can't come in while the quarantine is up..."

Andreth stirs from his pallet. "Then we gotta get the quarantine lifted first. An'... to do that, we're gonna need yer help, Starguard me friend. The shadows nearly put an end ta us, and we've hardly dealt with a tithe of 'em yet."

Tilara says, "The problem is that in order to meet Liowen's terms for lifting the quarantine, we're going to have to go down and cleanse the springs. Which means you're going to have to come along, Starguard, or we'll get torn to pieces by the undead. Marlin and the Changers can hold the fort here while you're gone."

Starguard looks up at Tilara, his face looking haggard. "I... I suppose so..." he begins. He stares into space, and finally nods. "And if we don't do something about the taint, the shadows may come for us all eventually. The Abbot and the other monks included." He rises slowly. "Tilara, can you go and fetch Meliandre, Azaril, and Marlin? I must speak with the Abbot - if Andreth's fists could not touch the creatures, then neither will my morningstar. Perhaps the Brothers will have a holy weapon that I can use..."

When the Changers return, with the young lad in tow, they quickly agree to take over the tending of Starguard's patients. Meliandre smiles, impishly, observing that this will be a good learning experience for the young Marlin, while Azaril promises to guard both his lady and the lad with his life if need be.

With the abbot's help, the party is feeling a little better equipped. After all, he has opened the armory to them. There's not much left; Agilnes remembered to remove most of the weapons, but a few remained behind, including a well polished magical mace, and an old quarterstaff once wielded by the abbot himself when he was a young wanderer.

The next morning, Starguard prays by the bedsides of the White Company, beseeching the Stars for their aid in restoring the strength drained from his companions. Kenilthwen and Wilthorwen bestow their blessings beyond Starguard's best hopes, and the doughty warrior and the intrepid monk find their limbs lightened with renewed strength. Smiling happily, Starguard advises them to keep to their beds for today, as their full strength is not yet with them. "And besides," remarks the old healer, "I do not wish to tax the Stars with too many requests. We shall need their blessings all the more tomorrow."

Tilara spends the day searching through the library, hunting for information on undead while Mirra hunts mice.

Early the following the morning, the party once more prepares to head down into the caverns beyond the chapel, now joined by the paladin, girded in the light of his faith. His prayers have held strong, and the Stars seem to be smiling down on him as he follows the others down.

As before the first cavern is empty, but the shadows are twitching in unexpected ways ....

Slowing down the party waits cautiously, and the shadows dance ...

The White Company forms up in a circle around the wizard, watching the shadows warily. Starguard murmurs, "Poor souls. Let's put them to rest..."

Zinzer rubs the necklace of firey missles taken from Firion. "Gladly."

Tilara says, "If they attack, at least. We can't stand here forever... advance, or try to repel them first?"

The shadows begin to waft closer, converging on the paladin, attracted and repelled by his presence.

When the shadowy forms begin to converge, Andreth's eyes narrow. "Enough," he says, raising the crossbow and firing a quarrel at the nearest shadow, azure energy wrapping itself around the shaft as it whistles through the air.

Moving up closely to Starguard, the shadows reach out, tendrils sliding through his chainmail, reaching out past his shield, ignoring his weapons and his open eyes to suck the strength out of the very marrow of his bones ...

Ash steps between Zinzer and the second shadow, swinging without effect. The creatures are particularly evasive today.

A third shadow steps forward, outstretched hands loving caressing Starguard's disbelieving face. Its fingers pass through the straps of his helmet, settling into his jaws, sucking his strength out, and leaving him so weak he can barely stand, his armour dragging him down to the ground ...

Starguard staggers to the ground, his armor clanking around him. Feebly, he raises the twinned starburst to chest height, wheezing, "In the name of Kenilthwen and Wilthorwen..." He gasps. "Foul shades depart!" The light of the Stars glows forth from the holy symbol, and with a shriek, the three shades surrounding him disappear into the rock.

Four newcomers rise from the underworld, and Zinzer and Andreth make marginal attempts to dispatch the spectral things before they can enervate Starguard completely. While their attempts are less successful, Ash's great weapon hacks solidly through one half-corporeal form and dissolves it into nothing.

Or perhaps their attempts aren't so unsuccessful after all; the remaining shadows sway forward, wrapping him in their tender arms, and suck the last of his strength out of him, before dropping him to the ground and turning to face the remainder of the party.

Zinzer sees Starguard go down under the onslaught, and screams as a wave of energy leaps forth from his fingertips. The electrical storm washes over the three shadows; one completely vanishes.

"Starguard! NO!" yells Andreth, stepping sideways and swinging at the noisome shadow with all his might. Zinzer's enchanted quarterstaff connects solidly, and with a wailing shriek, the shadow dissipates into nothing.

Stepping forward, Ash rams his greatsword straight through the heart of the last leering shadow, watching as it quivers in and out of existence. He times it right; the fell thing evaporates with a thin wailing, like a cold and lonely wind.

Zinzer casts a strengthening spell on Starguard's fallen form, uncertain if the arcane energy will save his spirit. He sobs as Starguard stirs, and whispers, "Starguard... if you can't heal yourself now... there isn't going to be a tomorrow."

Starguard's eyes flicker open, as Zinzer's arcane magic washes over him. Even that motion seems to tax him; he makes hardly another move except to draw in a feeble breath and whisper, "So cold... I'm sorry, my friends... their hatred... of the gods... too strong..."

Tilara watches nervously, Mirra guarding her back. "I don't know how long the other three will be gone. We've got to get Starguard out of here before they come back."

Tilara sighs with relief as Starguard answers. "Ash, pick him up. Let's get him out of here while we still can. Back upstairs. Maybe the Brothers can help him before those spells wear off." She chivvies them out, taking rearguard again, watching nervously behind her as they go. "As soon as we get him settled, we've got to try coming back down. If we can heal the spring soon, maybe that will help him."
