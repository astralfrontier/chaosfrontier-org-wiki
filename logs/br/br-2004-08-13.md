The group gives Starguard the potion of Restoration as soon as they get him away from the shadows, and are rather subdued when they get back to the monastery. Tilara spends a bit of time scouting around the monastery, and then asks if there is any objection to her 'borrowing' the diamond. "I found some reference materials in the library, and I think I can put a wand together." Hearing no objections, she takes the stone and some other things she's found in the storerooms and vanishes into a workroom. Mirra stands guard outside, hissing at anyone who approaches for the next four days. At the end, she emerges, disheveled, but triumphant. "Got it." She's holding a thin rod of ash wood, wound with copper wire, the diamond set at the tip as a focus - it glows with magic for those with eyes to see.

Starguard, the chosen champion of the Stars, bears the Shield of Ungfallen into the cemetary. A hunch from earlier sparked an examination of the burial ground, and the result was fourteen missing bodies, with three already prepared for burial but not yet interred. The ex-soldier has seen his share of the dying and the dead; the specter of mortality that hangs here is no stranger. What disturbs his peace of mind most is the thought of the cycle of life and death being disrupted. Surely the shadows, and whatever other unholy things walk in the catacombs beneath, are an affront to Ungfallen. He prays now for guidance to his twin patrons in the sky above, but also to a darker god in lightless caverns below, asking silently for the wisdom and power to dispel the abominations that plague the party.

For his part, Ash stands guard near the chapel near the cavern. His strength has returned and once again his enchanted greatsword can be wielded with the relative ease he's grown accustomed to. Between the Ogre's gauntlets he wears while on duty and the bolstering magics he's received from the party's casters in prior battles, he feels more confident in his own power than ever. He feels doubly confident from the reassurance that the un-dead beyond cannot (or will not) cross through the chapel. He stands here now more as a watchman than as a warrior, for he has no part in the magical preparations taking place elsewhere.

The White Company gets word to Liowen that silver is required to make Holy Water to fight the undead. The parsimonious senior monk is loath to part with the precious metal, but he is also loathe to allow his monastery to remain infested by such vile things. He expresses his willingness to allow the Company to remove the threat by sending in a monk to carry a large sack jingling with silver coins. The monk is dressed in ordinary, somewhat motheaten robes, that hide a scrawny frame. He looks around the courtyard with trepidation as if he expects something to jump out and eat him. "I am Ezekial, the fourth assistant librarian," he announces. "Brother Liowen has sent me to aid you."

Upon completing his prayers, Starguard returns to the abbot, doing what he has been doing for the past several days - checking up on the old man's condition. The abbot has become rather more talkative, and in discussing the prayers and meditations the holy man underwent, he informs Starguard of some of the powers and properties of the shield he bears. "On consecrated ground," he says in particular, "and with your power, Ungfallen can truly claim those you turn."

Zinzer spends the four days in the library, alternately gawking at the impressive array on titles, and scribing scrolls with protection spells for the Company. After the final scroll, he settles into a chair with a rare volume on gemology, and considers his future. _I could live my life in this room... no more people shooting at me... no more rat for dinner..._

Andreth, like Ash, can do little to help in the preparations for the third, and hopefully successful, assault on the shadow-infested caverns. He does help to grind the silver pieces at Starguard's direction, so that he may imbue the bright metal with the power of the Stars, but mostly he meditates in the chapel, praying to Limera that she watch over himself and his friends, and to reassure the troubled souls that the White Company hopes to guide to Ungfallen's Hall.

Meanwhile, Ezekial is persuaded to accompany the others on their next jaunt into the tunnels... it doesn't take much. "I am a student of the Gods, and they have taught me much about the sanctity of the Waters," he speaks. "If anything can be done, let me be a part of it. Too many of our fellows died already in confusion." His earnestness and naivete are marred by the following comment, "And perhaps it will be a means of filling time other than stacking books on shelves."

Starguard further requests permission from the Abbot for the use of the apothecary, for given the fearsome power of the shadows to drain the strength of the living, he or Ezekiel may need assistance if they fall. To Starguard's pleasant surprise, the Abbot offers the free use of the Brothers' supplies to make potions of lesser restoration, provided that the unused potions will be returned to the Brothers' stockpile. And so Starguard returns to an all-too-familiar pursuit - laboring over a seething cauldron for hours on end as he prays to the Stars to bless his labours.

As Starguard distributes the potions on the fourth day, Andreth surprises him by offering the loan of his enchanted bracelets. Indeed, insisting. "Nay, Starguard me friend," says the young monk. "Yer armor didna protect ye against the shades, so ye need summat more. As for meself, the Way o' the Oak is armor enough."

---

After all the preparations have been made, after all the prayers have been said, after the patients have been checked one last time and the abbot's blessing sought and given, the company once more descends below. The mood is perhaps a little grimmer now, The step a little more stolid. Starguard reaches out with his mind, seeking out the evil that lurks below.

The fountain in the chapel is as befouled as ever, the water filled with the growing scum, glowing with evil intentions. Nothing consciously evil, and he turns his gaze away after a few moments, troubled. Evil, certainly, but nothing he can slay. The true evil lies deeper within the caverns. Closer to the source. No, the company must move deeper.

Zeke says a final prayer to Agla. _My Lord, I go to do Holy work. Mask my presence from the evil that lies below, as the waters mask what lies at the riverbed._

Ezekial touches each of the Company on the shoulder, spreading the blessing to others. "Tread carefully, White ones."

Moving into the caves, the company passes quietly through the first cave. The cave is empty now, the shadows devoid of menace. In the second cave the shadows linger but they do not move, and Starguard, pausing to observe them carefully, is certain they contain no evil spirits, dead or otherwise. Here, at least, the shadows seem to have been vanquished.

Zeke says, "I don't like this. Where did they all go?"

Tilara says, "Back to Ungfallen, I hope. We did destroy several of them."

Beyond lies a long narrow corridor, just wide enough for two to walk abreast, the water gushing in a narrow stream down the center, The water is black here. Blacker than deepest night. Clear, but darker than it should be, and the evil emanates. Further down ... further down, Starguard begins to feel the evil glow. At the far end of this corridor, he knows, is another larger cave. In fact ...

He recalls the map he was shown. This corridor will open into a larger cave, where the water collects in a pool. There's a narrow opening there into the fifth and final cave. And there, in the fourth cave, he can sense evil lurking. Auras. As many shadows as before ...

Starguard puts a hand on Ash's shoulder and whispers softly, "The next cave. Our foes await. As many as before, at least from what I can sense..."

The fourth cave is wide, and round, and mostly round, the water gathered into a pool at the far end, where it cascades in a small waterfall. The entrance to the fifth cave lies behind that waterfall. The shadows are gathered at the edge of the pool, feeding in some strange way on the water, or perhaps on the thing that's lying half submerged at the water's edge? Nonetheless, they haven't noticed the party at all.

Ash feels odd, knowing that he's under the effects of magic, believing that he cannot be seen by the party's terrible foes and yet not seeing anything out of the ordinary about himself. Nevertheless he keeps his sword ready, prepared to use it when the time is right.

Zeke realizes the symbolism of the Waterfall, known in the pantheon as Agla, and murmurs a prayer to bless the area in the name of that God. He spreads dust ground from the monastery's silver coinage around the Company's feet, and prepares to smite the blasphemous shadows.

Not given to glibness of tongue, Ezekial simply speaks, "Foul things, begone!" He's surprised by the power in his own voice, for four of the things, indeed, are gone, fading instantly as if they'd never been. Two remain, and whatever strange thing waits at the pool's edge.

At Ezekiel's word, Starguard raises is crossbow and fires - the greatly reduced number of foes gives him confidence that he and his allies will prevail in short order. Unfortunately, his own shot fails to make the point, as the shaft clatters to the floor of the cave opposite.

Andreth's shot fares rather better - the bolt whistles through the still air, and the magic is caught by the ethereal substance of the shadow, eliciting a thin wail as electricity crackles around its ghostly form, filling the cavern for a moment with flickering azure shadows.

Tilara smiles as Ezekiel disintegrates four of the wretched things. She mutters the words, and three firey bolts fly from her fingers into the shadow that Andreth hit - it shreds under the impact, fading into nothingness.

The potion flask waiting on the swordsman's hip has been waiting for use, and now is the time to use it. Supporting his sword in one hand for a moment, a trick he has practiced innumerable times for such occasions, Ash snatches up the flask, breaks off the seal, and downs the magical concoction. As he does, a wave of magical protection engulfs the front field of his vision as the shield of force settles into place. While his armor has proven useless against such beings in the past, he feels confident of this alternative.

From the front line of the Company's formation, Zinzer throws an azure bolt of eldritch energy at the remaining shadow. _A pity I don't know anything more focussed,_ he thinks, as the creature dies the true death.

In the deep silence everyone waits, nervously. Starguard looks round, but the stench of evil has mostly departed this room. It lingers in the water, as it has throughout, and it lies faintly over what is now clearly a corpse lying half in and out of the water.

Moving closer, Starguard looks at the corpse. After a moment, his eyes open wide as he recognizes the former librarian, Rolwen. A man who no longer looks quite the way he used to. His features are drawn, and cold, and his aura is glowing weakly. His spirit hasn't risen again yet, but surely it's only a matter of time?

Zeke falls to his knees next to the old man. "Oh, no... oh, no no no..."

Mirra mrowwls softly as her mistress recognizes the body. _Nice man with mice...?_

Strangest are the librarian's eyes. They've not broken, as the eyes of dead men do, but they've blackened into orbs of deadness, promising death to all who catch his gaze.

Zeke says, "This area is Consecrated now. Restless spirits cannot be incited to walk on Consecrated ground. We have to haul him out of the stream, then put him to rest."

Starguard sighs softly, and gestures with the sign of the Stars. "Alas, Rolwen..." He nods to Andreth. "Will you give me a hand, lad? The man deserves his rest, lest the dark forces take him completely."

Tilara stands back to back with Andreth while the others work, watching for any sign of other undead creatures.

Zeke closes the eyelids on his former cohort. "Brother Rolwen... we didn't always see eye to eye... well... to be honest, we always were sand in each other's craw. But you were one of the Brothers of the Waters, and so was I, and that gives us common cause. We shall record your service to us... and if Agla wills it, I'll personally pursue those who brought you, and our brethren, to this end."

Starguard kneels beside Rolwen's still, bloated form. "And may Kenilthwen and Wilthorwen light your way safely to Ungfallen's Hall," he says, resting his hand on the cold brow. As he does so, he channels a bit of the Stars' blessing just as he did for the Abbot and others, hoping that the power of the twin gods will help to purge the taint from the former librarian's body just as it did for the living.

As he does so, he feels a... well, it's almost like a trembling beneath his hand, though the corpse does not move. A tremor of the soul, perhaps. Blinking, Starguard risks raising one of the closed eyelids... and to his delight and relief, the deadly blackness is gone from Rolwen's eye, replaced with the glassy white stare of an ordinary corpse.

Zeke stands, and looks towards the fifth and final cavern, a white-knuckle grip on his staff. "Let's make an end of this."

Starguard nods, rising. "We will return after to collect Rolwen's body, so that it can be given a proper burial. But for now..." His hand tightens around the haft of the Brothers' holy mace.

Tilara says, "Aye. One way or t'other." She checks that her crossbow is ready to fire, and her wand and spell components are ready to hand.

Casting his senses forward once more, Starguard faces the waterfall. Behind that watery curtain lurks the last of the caves, and the spring that serves the entire Brotherhood. And, behind the curtain lies the final battle. Even at this distance he can sense that one last aura, as it seems it can sense him. It's waiting. Simply waiting. Can something so full of hate be at peace at the same time? Or be amused? What a strange aura? So ... unsettling.

Zeke repeats his earlier prayer, a supplication to Agla to mask their presence from the greater evil that waits beyond. The prayer is much simpler this time. _Dear Lord, I hope this works._

After the careful, short prayer - much influenced by Ezekial's newly won experience with the undead - Ash moves through the waterfall, the others following behind him, Ezekial first in line. Behind the waterfall the passage twists and turns for a few feet, and he has to move carefully to make it through, but then it opens up into the final cave. The water here comes from a spring near the ceiling, and runs along a runnel on the left, before disappearing into the wall, only to reappear as the waterfall.

The cave itself is small, and contains, oddly enough, a bed, and a desk. And a creature, seated on top of the desk, watching as Ash squirms his way into the cave. Obviously, he can see Ash. His black eyes gaze malevolently as the party begins to squeeze into the cave and he watches. Starguard can feel the evil growing.

Acting out of instinct, Ash raises his greatsword and holds it horizontally before his eyes, blocking out the gaze of the creature while not obscuring the rest of it. Though he might not see its arms clearly, he will know should it choose to move.

Feeling a wave of unnatural discomfort washing through him, Ash feels gratified that he obstructed the thing's gaze in time. "'Ware its eyes," he calls behind him, steeling himself for a tough battle.

The creature's gaze sharpens as it recognizes the warning for what it is. Eyes narrowed, focusing intensely on the young fighter, he stretches, and manages to catch the young man's eyes for merely a moment. But a moment is all it takes, and the young man slumps to the ground insensate.

Moving forward cautiously, the creature seeks out Zeke, his hands outstretched in a gruesome sight. Where eyes won't serve him, it seems, he hopes his fists will. But somehow those fists would serve the moster a lot better if only he could locate Zeke.

Starguard rushes up the corridor and darts behind Ezekiel, raising the mace in one hand. His eye falls upon Ash's still form, and his face contorts with righteous wrath. "Die, creature of darkness!" he calls, invoking the power of the Stars behind a blow that lands upon the creature's ribs solidly.

Zinzer comes out of the tunnel and steps to the side. Seeing that the creature is staggering, he lets loose with another lightning bolt, hoping to catch it unawares. Unfortunately, the magic energy doesn't seem to do anything to the foul thing at all.

Tilara squeezes through the narrow passage behind Andreth. From the shouts ahead, she gathers that the creature is humanoid and has some kind of dangerous gaze. Ominously, Ash has been silent since that first warning yell. When she gets to the end of the passage, she keeps her eyes fixed on the floor, aiming a set of magic missiles by the location of the thing's feet.

Tilara nods to herself as the missiles fly, and closes her eyes against the thing's deadly gaze while she readies herself for her next spell.

Zeke has stepped out of the monster's way. He closes his eyes and tosses another handful of silver dust on the ground in a ring at his feet. The dust glows briefly and dissapears, but an aura of energy opposed to the evil thing's nature remains in the air around Ezekial.

The monster, in return for Zeke's trouble, punches Zeke in the gut. The cleric lets out a most unpriestly 'Oof' as the air is knocked from him.

His eyes still tightly shut, Starguard locates a pouch of silver dust on his belt by feel. Casting it around him, he calls out, "Stars, bless this ground with thy power!" The silver glitters like the stars in the sky as it falls, consecrating the ground around him against unnatural life.

Zinzer runs up to Ash's fallen form, and shrieks, "Oh my Gods, he's dead! Ash is dead!"

With his eyes shut, only Andreth's keen hearing allows him to sense where the fell monstrosity may be. But he takes a chance nonetheless, lashing out blindly with the quarterstaff. To his gratification, he feels the blow land on the monster's flesh.

Tilara says, "Been there, done that. If we can fix up the springs, the Brothers can bring him back." She concentrates on listening for the creature, then risks a brief peek to spot his feet so she can aim the spell.

Tilara misjudges the moment, and collapses, the spell unused. Mirra howls disconsolately beside her.

Zeke isn't sure what to expect as he raises the Shield of Ungfallen and calls on the name of the other God, hoping Ungfallen and Agla are on friendly terms... _but could such a powerful opponent be destroyed by such as us?_ "Fiend, Begone!"

The creature howls soundlessly; before collapsing onto the ground where it shrivels into a smaller and smaller pile, finally shrinking into a pile of dust that finally blows away in the faintest of breezes, leaving behind as only evidence of its passing the two corpses ...

Zeke cautiously opens one eye in the sudden silence, and then rushes to tend Ash and Tilara. _Maybe there is still time?_

Starguard senses the evil before him fade away even as he guards against its further attacks, dispelled by the power of Agla and Ungfallen. Only when it fades away to nothingness does he risk opening his eyes. He then sees Ash and Tilara's still forms and rushes forward, checking their eyes. Wincing as he sees the black touch he'd seen on Rolwen, he lays hands on both of them, invoking the direct intervention of the Stars to purify the taint left on their bodies by the foul creature. The darkness fades, but the glassy stare of death does not. His shoulders slump. "I can do no more for them..." he says mournfully.

Zinzer moves to examine the bed and the desk, pulling on a pair of gloves. "Odd sort of dead thing, that it would need furniture."

Zeke looks up at Starguard. "The Abbot is weak. Ironic that the last thing Tilara said, was that you'd recover Ash. I know not. What we did before for you... for Andreth... was extraordinary. It could kill the old father." He pauses. "And we still don't know what happened to the spring." He stands and surveys the waters.

The bed and the desk look ancient, made of stone and preserved through the ages. Both look unused. Perhaps, they were the refuge, once, of an ancient hermit?

Zinzer runs his fingers over the desktop. "Unused for decades. Quite a distraction."

Starguard raises his head, invoking the vision of the Stars once more, and turns to Ezekiel, smiling weakly. "But we do know what happened to the spring, Ezekiel. That foul creature's presence had tainted it - and perhaps the body of Rolwen tainted by its evil. Those things are gone now. The spring runs clean."

Zeke shakes his head. "It doesn't explain enough. Something like that doesn't just pop up in a place like this. And the plague is widespread; there may be... more." He shudders. "Please leave me. I wish to do some thinking in front of the waterfall. I will look after your friends, if you leave them here; as I recall, there is a common blessing you used on Andreth when you brought him here before. Or perhaps you would prefer that Starguard do that. In either case, I wish some time alone."
