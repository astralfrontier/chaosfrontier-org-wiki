# Birthright 2004-09-17

Although the plague was running wild in Fallan, it wasn't until Sonja and Harald had left the Fallanese forests that they could truly appreciate the damage it was causing. Small farms were abandoned. Cattle roamed free, untended. The spring sowing was far behind schedule in many places. People were gathered at the larger farms for solace, and company, although towns and villages lay half abandoned, shunned by the rich.

Citadel itself was deathly quiet. The temple bells tolled the hours over the countryside, but the roads were near empty. Only the dead walked, and they walked at night, mostly. Thus far, by dint of hard riding and the occasional skirmish, Sonja and Harald had arrived mostly unscathed.

But now the great gates of the city lay ahead. A moment's pause, and then the two travelers pressed on. The papers in their pockets and the knowledge in their minds were both pressing them, pushing them forwards. And then onwards, right up to the Emperor's Gate.

Sonja looks at the imposing gate, the unnervingly quiet street that passes through the gate, looks at her travel worn companion while holding the reins to her horse, "We have come this far, lets deliver these documents and see how we can help further."

Harald nods. "This is not what I had hoped to see. Old Hans said he had been here, and that you could enter and visit the gardens."

The guard at the gate smiles drily. "You can. However, just now, we're a little at sixes and sevenses. Is that why you're here?"

Harald says, "Messages from Prince Fallon for the Emperor. After that, we are at your service."

Sonja tries to look a bit more presentable by brushing off some of the travel dust. She also tries not to gawk and look around this strange place.

The guard nods. "The Emperor is in the Walled Gardens now, with the Empress." He looks around, and then steps aside to talk to another guard. A moment later he shrugs. "Follow me."

Sonja gathers up the reins of her hose and looks at Harald, "I guess we go."

The Walled Gardens are just that; a large square walled area. Outside the gate, two guards stand next to a weaponsrack. The gate guard stops there. "I'll see to the stabling of your horses, if you've the paperwork you mentioned. Weapons have to be left here, of course. After that, the Emperor is inside. He will ... be interested in your messages."

Sonja releases the reigns to her horse, "Can you please see she is groomed, watered, and fed. Unless that is asking too much, its not as if not been doing it all this time." She unstrings her bow and racks it, followed by the heavy mace joinging it in a weapons rack.

Harald nods, and hands the guard his copies of the parchments while he hangs his sword-belt on his gelding's saddle. "I wish we were bringing better news. Fallan has the plague, as well."

Sonja nudges Harald, "I think we are about to meet the Emperor himself and present the papers in our care."

The guard nods. "After you come out, ask for directions to the stables. We're a little understaffed at the moment." The guard looks morose, muttering _Good thing we're not being invaded_ as he leaves.

Sonja says a silent prayer that the land is spared from invasion and again prays for deliverance from this strange malady.

The gates stand in the centre of one long wall. One of the gate guards swings it open, beckoning the young adventurers inside. As they step through, they see a large walled garden. A path runs along the wall, with four pathways leading to a circle in the center. In each quadrant the spires reach for the skies, although today there is only the one scholar, standing on a ladder, reading the writings chiselled on the spire that stands in the winter quadrant.

And that's the most amazing part of the gardens. In one quadrant snow lies thick on the ground, while across from it the summer blooms are blooming madly. And between them in the third quadrant the spring herbs are growing thickly, while in the last, the plants of autumn grow green and thick.

Sonja whispers to Harald, "What is this place really? Dont remember any but tall tales of this place."

Harald whispers back, "Hans said that each of the four quadrants shows a different season. Some of them are actually showing the future... The spires give the history of different peoples. The Empire, the Stormwinders.. rumor has it that a fourth spire appeared last year. If we have a chance, I'd like to see it."

Sonja says, "Think that mystery spire might have a relationship to what is now going on?"

Harald says, "If it does, I suspect that the Emperor's scholars will have puzzled it out by now."

Harald looks around, trying to spot the Imperial party.

Sonja feels a bit nervous walking down one of these paths still somewhat dirty as she goes to meet the person who is supposed to be her Emperor. She also hopes the news they bring matters and is not just a repeat of someone else's discover.

Sonja looks at the man and woman, "Could they be the Emperor and Empress? Guard said they were here."

Harald shrugs. "Well, let's ask them. If they're not, maybe they'll know." He does just that, walking up to the woman on the ground and bowing politely, in case she's important. "Excuse me, ma'am. We need to find the Emperor; the guards told us he was in the gardens. We have messages for him."

The woman, her face haggard, nods, and points at the man atop the ladder. "He's here."

Harald blinks in surprise, then turns his attention upward. "Your Majesty? We bear messages from Prince Fallon."

The man, meanwhile, peers over to look at something fairly small. A moment later, frowning, he climbs back down. "There's not a clue in the lot of them. None of this makes sense." Turning to Harald and Sonja he smiles briefly. "Messages are always welcome. And surprising. We haven't heard from my son in weeks. I assumed he'd broken his crystal. Is he well?"

Sonja clears her throat and is nervous, but she decides to finally break her nervous sielnce. "Your Majesty, your son our Prince is doing fine. However two of his sons are ill and the third has died. It also seems to be striking magic users heavily."

The emperor nods, and sighs. "I see. I'm sure the news will arrive on the spires in due time. For some reason, even they are falling behind." He looks around. "Come, let us move to summer, and enjoy the sunshine, while you share your messages. After that, we will find you a room." He shrugs. "The innkeepers in town are a bit leery of plague bearers at the moment, proven or otherwise." At a look, his wife steps away, and leaves the gardens.

Harald bows. "You honor us, sire." He continues, in a softer voice. "I do not know if it was in the messages, but... the victims of this plague are not quiet. We've had several run-ins with the walking dead on our journey here."

The emperor nods. "We know. They walk in our cellars. The Thieves' Guild - not, of course, that I know who they are - has already lost some of its members to their own traps as they tried to escape their dead brethren. The spires are maintaining a roll of the dead and dying, to a point, but they're not identifying causes."

Sonja nods affirmatively backing up Harald's words, "Yes your Majesty. We have had encounters with walking dead. Was unsettling to say the least."

Sonja opens up the message case strapped to her waist, she gently removes the sheaf of messages she was entrusted with, and offers them to the Emperor, "Your Majesty I hope these messages will be of help with your researchers, your son insisted that the news get to you as fast as possible."

Harald chuckles drily at the Emperor's comment about the Thieves' Guild. "Of course you wouldn't know them, your Majesty." He straightens up, then, to his full height (as little as that is). "We are, of course, at your service. Do you have a return message, or some other task for us?"

The emperor nods, paging through the sheets quickly. "Ah. Yes. He writes as lengthily as always. Nothing he told you that isn't in here? No broad warnings, cryptic messages, or the like?"

Sonja at first shakes her head no, then pauses. "Well he did insist that if for some reason the message case was lost to remember one thing. "The water itself is not the problem, but the divine source of the water is the problem.

Harald nods. "Then he gave us two full copies of his messages, in case only one of us got through. We were fortunate, though, and didn't have any major problems aside from having to deal with abandoned inns and campsites."

"The water ... the divine ... Ah." The emperor reads. "Yes. He's buried that deep in paragraph 16, sub article 5. Sigh. Yes, ... Harald, is it? We will have more work for you. I will. We need to cure this plague. There's some good news, and you may as well hear it now. A cure has been found for those who are sick, but it is difficult."

Harald says, "That... is at least a little encouraging."

Sonja says, "From just a little hope, much can be accomplished. With hard work, and some divine help."

"Yes. I will be doing what I can, but my powers ... my bond with the land is not infinite. I can heal, but not everyone." He sighs. "Please, enjoy the gardens. Invitations have gone out; there will be a large meeting tomorrow. I hope you will attend."

Harald bows again. "Certainly, sire. We will be honored."

Sonja feels her cheeks flame red as she thinks she was a bit forward with that last comment. She stammers, "Of course your Majesty, Prince Fallon enjoined us to serve you in curing this illness and thence taking the true cure back to Fallon."

The emperor smiles drily. "Tomorrow morning I will explain more. For now ... Find the Chamberlain. He'll show you your rooms. I have some work to do here. Work best done alone."

Sonja is stuck in a quandry, bow or what? She finally gives a little bow while saying, "Thank you Sir for your hospitality and time."

---

Back at the Brotherhood of the Waters, matters have progressed quickly. Brother Starguard has already left, on Windrider, and is expected in Citadel within the week or so, after spreading news of the cure as fast and far as he can.

Carefully drawing a circle inside a circle, Liowen writes a number of runes in the rim. The circle will easily hold two or three humans, though not much more. Then looking up, he turns at Andreth and Zeke. "We can cast this once a day. The boy and the ambassadors will follow tomorrow." He pauses. "We'll put you in the Walled Gardens. Your weapons will follow in about 30 minutes. You may wish to explain to the guards why you're armed inside the gardens."

Ezekiel looks upon the circle with trepidation, both awed and unsettled by the Godless magic. "So... ummm... Brother Liowen... when was the last time you used this magic to send a living thing?"

Brother Liowen shrugs. "We haven't. Do let us know if you've arrived safely."

Andreth nods dryly. "Just do yer best. I think Merial'll be displeased if'n I pay 'er a visit instead o' helpin' her with the plague."

Ezekiel simply sets his jaw and steps into the circle, muttering prayers to Agla under his breath, and waits for Andreth to join him.

The abbot, watching carefully, nods. "We will, Andreth. We will. We're all praying for you."

Andreth steps into the circle, squaring up his shoulders. "All right. I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna be."

Moments after Andreth steps into the circle, a small brother steps forward and begins chanting. Soon, a circle of brothers surround the two young adventurers, and the power begins to grow, and rumble, vibrating through the young mens' bodies. Slowly, the light is leached from the sky, and all becomes black. The world begins to spin, and to shake.

Somehow, things begin to stretch, pulling the young men forward while leaving them anchored where they are. Time stretches as they do, until suddenly there is a loud, and painful, snap.

Two young men land in a tangled heap in the center of the Walled Gardens, Zeke on the bottom, sprawled and green.

Ezekiel tries to regain his footing, falls over, and crawls an entire 18 inches before vomiting violently.

At the garden's gate, the emperor jumps at the sound, and spins around, a dagger appearing in his hand.

Ezekiel mutters, "Agla, please bless this land in your name, for it is... not moving... oooh... my head..."

Andreth blinks, and takes a brief staggering step, but quickly overcomes his disorientation. "Zeke, are ye all right?" he says, kneeling down beside Ezekiel. The sudden sound of motion, however, makes him look up. "Y-yer Highness. Sorry ta drop on in on ye like this."

Moving forward, his eyes narrowed, the emperor advances on the two adventurers. As he comes closer, however, he recognizes Andreth, and sheathes the dagger. Looking down at Ezekiel, he smiles. "I see Brother Liowen was unnecessarily pessimistic about the new abilities they've mastered?"

Ezekiel realizes that Andreth is addressing the Emperor, and moves from a sprawl to a bow, then unsteadily to his feet. "At your service, Sire... Brother Liowen..." He stops for a moment. "I'm not doing that again."

Ezekiel remembers to whom he speaks, and pales, almost falling to a bow again. "Sire! I'm so sorry about the mess!"

Andreth glances at Ezekiel with some concern, but nots. "Well... mebbe not **too** much so. Looks like me friend's a bit the worse fer wear here." He pauses, then nods. "Ah. This is Ezekiel. He's one o' the Brothers, and 'e helped us out quite a lot."

The emperor nods. "I see. Well ... " He sighs. "We'll have to find someone to clean that up, won't we." He moves back to the gate, where the smell is less noticeable. "Meanwhile, Andreth, why don't you come with me. And lad, you go get cleaned up. The guards will point you at the bath house. Afterwards, join us in the throne room."

Andreth nods. "Aye, sir. Liowen asked us ta call back when we got 'ere safely..." he adds.

The emperor pauses. "Ah. I see. He wouldn't have sent along a way of doing so, would he?"

Ezekiel remembers something Liowen said. "More are following... our weapons are coming in about half an hour, and tomorrow they are sending... ambassadors. Some of your in-laws," he adds, lest the cover of the Changer emissaries be broken.

Andreth blinks, then smacks his forehead. "Oh, course," he says, pulling the crystal globe from his pocket and tapping it with the hammer. As soon as its effect manifests itself, he says, "Liowen? We're 'ere."

Ezekiel senses that it is time to take his dismissal, and approaches the garden gate. He explains the situation to the guards, and hopes that they'll believe him, since the Emperor is standing right there.

The crystal glows as always, and Zinzer's voice can be heard. "Ah. Good. What was it like? Did everyone survive? Symptoms?"

"Oh," Ezekiel adds. "A pile of weapons will be showing up in... about 20 minutes. It would be kind of you to please see that they are given to the young monk yonder, as undisturbed as possible?"

Andreth nods. "Well, we all made it 'ere in one piece. Though Zeke's breakfast dinna stay with 'im long afterward."

The sound of Zinzer scratching on a tablet can be heard. "Extreme nausea? Oh, dear. Please tell me he's uninjured."

"Yeah. Once 'e got it outa 'is system, 'e was fine. It was kinda dizzyin' though. Mebbe 'e just gets seasick easy." Andreth chuckles. "The Emperor was kinda surprised, though." He nods to the Emperor. "Got anything ta say ta 'em right now?" he says, offering him the crystal.

The emperor nods, accepting the crystal. "Zinzer ... Zinzer, tell the abbot to be careful. I will try to cure the empire. He needs to keep his brothers healthy. And tell him that we need to find every man, woman, and child who has a bond with the Land." After Zinzer's agreement, the emperor hands the crystal back. Pausing, he looks at the sun overhead and measures the time. "Andreth, there will be a large meeting tomorrow. Please bring Ezekiel, here. And tonight, you probably want to visit Yuri. He's found himself a home in Citadel. You have a lot of catching up to do." Then, pivoting on his heel, the emperor walks out of the garden, heading somewhere at a fairly rapid clip.

Yuri is surprised and happy to see Andreth in Citadel, and then sobers under the impact of the news he brings. The deaths of Tilara and Ash hit him hard. News of the plague have drained much of the humor from the young man, and the losses of the White Company drain still more. "We do all we can to prevent war," he mutters, "and still the Empire suffers. Someone does not intend us to have peace." His hand tightens on his sword hilt. "And Ferg is here. Oh, we must deal with him again. But I suppose the plague takes precedence."

---

The following morning, rumours are running through the city that the Emperor has found a cure! Some of the people at death's door survived through the night, being the first to live longer than ten days after the sickness felled them. There are few or no details, though, and the crowd is thick in the courtyard that morning.

When the emperor appears, the crowd stills almost immediately. "Ladies and Gentlemen. We will begin by sharing what we know. The plague is a manifestation of divine illness. Muirwen, who is the river and the seas, the lakes and the rain, has somehow been poisoned. We do not as yet know how, or who is behind this." He pauses. "We have all lost friends, lost family. But now we have two things; we have a potential cure for those who are sick, and we have a cause."

Sonja stands beside Harald somewhere in the crowd, straining a bit to hear the Emperor's words over the whispers and some excited chatter that surrounds her in the crowd which though sparsely scattered makes up for the distance with louder converstaion. Still she hears the news Harald and her brought plus once again something about a cure.

There is a longer pause, as the crowd surges forward eagerly. The emperor holds up his hands, to still the restless comments. "There are those of us who have ties to the land. Those of us who can use those ties to heal our subjects. As we heal them, as we bring them back to the land, Mother Earth herself helps cure them. But only those who are promised to the land can do so. Many of those people live as farmers, as landholders. We must find them; they hold the cure." He looks around ruefully. "Last night, I walked around Citadel, and cured who and where I could. But the tie that binds charges a price." His shoulders stoop a little. "By nightfall, my ties were so weak I could barely sense the Mother myself. In short, I cannot cure this empire alone."

Ezekiel grimaces. _I thought as much,_ he thinks. _Great Agla, will you sicken as well? How far will this threat go, if even the mightiest of gods is victim?_

Octavian hovers at the edge of the crowd, avoiding the press, and ponders "... how do you poison a God?"

"So we must find all who have made their vows, who live in communion with Mother Earth. That will be our first task." The emperor pauses a moment. "But our second task is far harder. We must find a cure for Muirwen." He looks around. "We must heal the gods. The world, ladies and gentlemen, this day has become a darker place."

Yuri sighs. _I knew it. He gives, and he gives, and he gives... we're fortunate to have an Emperor who deserves the rank. But who backs him up when he fails? How many in this crowd really understand the price he pays for them?_

Andreth remembers young Marlin, fainting from the effort of curing even one plague-ridden man, and tries to imagine what it would take to lay the Emperor himself so low. The effort impresses on him all the more strongly how vital it is to destroy the plague at its source. Even if the price is the lives of good people like Ash or Tilara. Or himself once more, if it comes to it.

Harald murmurs to his companion, "So. The other side of the bargain. The Gods sustain us, but now it falls to us to sustain them in turn. I hope we're up to the task."

Sonja feels her mouth hang open in shock at the news, Both its hope and its peril is so great. She offers a silent prayer and opens her eyes again to see all those now crowded around the Emperor. She sees the desparate need of these people to be given hope and reassurance. The speech does that for a moment, but at the same time she sees them recoil away again when the Emperor admits he can not save them all himself. She starts to pray again when Harald josltes her with his observation, she nods affirmative. "Yes, it is time for us to fulfill our part of the bargain."

"Our last task lies the lightest, for now. We must find out how a god - a _God_ - was poisoned, lest it happen again. We must bring the death, the murder, of our friends and our family to justice; we must find the murderers. Outcasts, I call them. They will have no help from us, once we have found them." The emperor looks truly angered now. "So who will work with me? Who will travel the empire, spreading the word and seeking the cure?"

"You know what this means, Andreth," Yuri murmurs. "It's back to work for us. For me, also, this time. I don't remember how we found this path, but it seems we are bound to it."

Andreth nods to Yuri. "I owe it to Ash an' Tilara," he says grimly. He steps forward, and calls out loudly. "I'm Andreth of Woolwich - and I'll help ta seek the cure."

Sonja looks around her as something nags the back of her brain. She sees all these people frozen as if in statis. She exclaims, "Can none of you step forward to help? Then I shall be the first. Emperor, though newly arrived, count my talents and myself as a volunteer."

Yuri steps forward and stands next to Andreth. "We're with you, sire!" And then, more quietly, "As you knew we would be."

The sounds of those two volunteers spurs the populace forward, and cries of volunteering come from everywhere. The emperor looks pleased, especially at Andreth and Sonja, both.

Harald joins in, his fist raised, "I will!" The crowd roars its approval as the shock wears off and the rest step forward.

Octavian is still lost in thought. " Poisoned. How? .... and how to harm a God. .... to get close enough. Perhaps a trap. Perhaps .... not poison at all, such as it's known amongst mortals." He looks up, startled by the crowd's movement, and nods to himself.

After the cries have died down, the emperor smiles. Standing a little taller, looking a little less exhausted. "We will form groups; it is not safe to travel alone while the dead are walking. I know that some of you have friends. You will work together, I hope. But now we move to organization." He chuckles. "So let me introduce my chamberlain. He enjoys organizing things."

Oddly, the man beside him doesn't look particularly thrilled with that description. But he has a small portable desk set up, and a pile of paper ready to go. At his encouragement, lines are formed as people list their skills.

Yuri chuckles. _Of course. I didn't expect to see the answer so soon. He's tied to the land - but so are we. When we fight for him, he is stronger._

The Emperor pulls Andreth and Sonja aside. "I would see you and your friends travel together. The gods are watching over you, Andreth. Sonja, you will ..." He pauses a moment. "I believe you will be able to help when the dead walk?"

Sonja looks startled that the Emperor already seems to know so much about her. "Yes your Majesty I do have some small talent in that area."

Octavian spies Yuri in the crowd, and wanders over, nodding.

Andreth looks at Sonja with respect - though he has never met the woman before in his life, they share the kinship that comes of heeding the call of duty. "Aye, and we'll need every bit o' that talent an' more."

The emperor nods, once more. "I will leave you in the Chamberlain's hands." He pauses, and takes a step back, addressing the crowd one last time. "This is a time of emergency. If there are tools you lack, inform the chamberlain. We will do what we can."

Yuri waves to Octavian as he approaches, and introduces him briefly. "This is Octavian. He's an artificer; far more skilled than any other I've met. Octavian, are you willing to lend us your talent? We're sore in need of it."

Sonja takes a long look at this man beside her, searching his face and eyes. She pauses for a bit more before glancing at the Emperor fomr some kind of clue or hint. All she sees is weariness and hope. She smiles. "Sir Andreth, we will need all the help we can find I think, both common and divine. And I will pray mightily."

Sonja looks around for Harald and drags him over. "And this is my boon companion Harald, We traveled from Fallon with some news and did witness the dead walking along with other devastation."

Harald nods to Andreth and Yuri. "And killed a few of them, too, when we had no choice. If that's the right word..."

Sonja says, "A better phrasing I think is what you are looking for? Well I would guess we assisted them in attainng a proper after-life."

Yuri says, "As good a word as any." He sighs. "We better get started. We should see to the arrival of the ones that Andreth travelled with, and discharge our previous obligations properly. After that... I know just who to ask, about the poisoning of a God." He scowls. _This may well be the most dangerous part. And we won't even be leaving the city for it._

Andreth nods grimly. "Th'undead are key ta this plague some'ow. 'Twas one such that poisoned the Brothers' spring, an' killed our friends. Only when Ezekiel put an end ta it did the waters run clear."

Sonja ohs, "Some forewarning perhaps?"

Harald looks intrigued. "Really? You'll have to tell us all about it."

Yuri says, "Is this Ezekiel going to be available? If he's so effective at dealing with undead?" He looks up and down the lines, looking for the man that Andreth described, but does not see him. "Well. Maybe we can find him later."

Ezekiel, as it turns out, is not available to follow the White Company; the Chamberlain has asked him to accompany another group of adventurers going in a different direction. He returns to say his goodbyes to Andreth, and introduces himself to the others just long enough to be polite. "It was an honor to fight beside you in the grotto," he says. "I hope we find some answers this time, as well. When it is over, I promise, come to the Monastery and we will do what we can for your friends." He turns on his heel, the same confused look of confidence and apprehension on his face.

Andreth bows to Ezekiel. "I thank ye, an' good luck on yer road. May the gods watch o'er us both."

Sonja looks at her notes. "We got a deity poisoned. Must chat with priests and doctors on how that can happen."

The new White Company departs from the courtyard to a large room at the inn where Yuri has been staying, to discuss strategy. Patronizing Tormel, inquiring with Berina, and possibly confronting Ferg are all suggested. Also, Andreth reminds the Company of the dire portents in a letter from Tormel sent last fall... Cel is ill; and the White Fields in northern Aglamar are melting. Clearly, the first step must be a plan. The ad-hoc Council of War is adjourned at noon to greet the Changer emissaries, and Marlin, who arrive in the Gardens and are safely delivered to the Emperor. The hope for peace with the Changers is overshadowed by the pestilence on the land... but perhaps the White Company can now consider their original mission, assigned almost a year ago, as finally and fully accomplished.

The five find an out-of-the-way corner to sit and discuss their options. Andreth brings everyone up to date on what the White Company learned from the Brothers and Zinzer's scrying of Melial's House as well as their missing companions. Yuri discusses the information he's learned while in the Citadel, and the others add their own observations. Tormel, it is decided, must be their first stop.
