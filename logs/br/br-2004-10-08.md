# Birthright 2004-10-08

Ingrid looks once more at the little group, smiling widely and innocently. Her eyes are open wide, with only the faintest of shadows lurking in their depths. Then, looking up at the tree, she nods once.

Sonja still holds Ingrid's small hands in her hands, she looks at Ingrid's face and then at all the acorns. She asks in a small voice, "All of these acorns? And your Mum has suggestions on where we need to go?"

Ingrid nods, letting the acorns spill into Sonja's larger hands. "Yes. Mum says ... plant these when the need arises. And ... And she thinks you need to talk to Grannie." Ingrid looks worried, darting another glance upwards. "And Kennie."

Octavian blanches a bit... but then straightens up, looking resigned.

Sonja carefully stores the acorns in her hands in her bag and ties it securely to her belt. She looks at her companions and then back to Ingrid. "How are we to talk to them? Is your Mum going to give us transport, these are not realms I am used to." She looks a bit flustered and unsure as she sits with Ingrid.

Looking confused now, Ingrid shrugs. "I'd ride a horse, if I were you. It's ... you want to go to Wilthorwen's peak, in the northern reaches of Calais, if you want to visit Grannie."

Harald nods, having suspected this from the comments already made. "It's supposed to be possible to ride to Wilthorwen's Peak. Not the safest journey, but not impossible."

Sonja clasps Ingrid's hands within her hands, bows her head in prayer, and thanks Oak for her assistance and the assitance of Ingrid. Looking up and into Ingrid's eyes, "We shall do as your Mum advises and go talk. And I will pray that I shall uses these acorns wisely and when needed." She gives Ingrid a small hug before releasing her, "Thank you."

Ingrid smiles, and hugs. "Thank you, Sonja. And blessings be upon you all, oak and beech, and trembling aspen."

Harald bows to the youngster. "Thank you, Ingrid. And thank your mother for us. We have a few details to finish here, and then we will ride out to visit your grandparents."

Sonja pats the bag now dangling from her belt as she stands up. She gratefully accepts the blessings and returns them back to Ingrid. "And to you Ingrid, may all the blessings be bestowed upon you. Thank you again." She looks about and memorizes it for later. "I think our time here is done. Now to get safely down tree."

Octavian says, "Yep."

Ingrid smiles. "Follow me." She jumps over the edge of the platform, onto a bough below, and darts back along a different path, finally leading to the original platform. From there it's only a short trip down, after all.

Cautiously, the party follows Ingrid, eventually making their way back to the streets of Citadel. The cramped, crowded streets, where buildings loom and bluster in the cold quiet, where people are noticeably absent. Every day the city becomes a little emptier; if things don't improve, trade may soon come to a complete halt, just as the trading season has begun in earnest.

Sonja shivers at this strange landscape where buildings tower so while the streets echo with emptiness.

Having earlier quickly copied the relevant information from the book, Octavian takes a detour to return the book. Alice is the gatekeeper as before, and Berina politely accepts the returned book. The visit is short, though, marred by only a single comment of Berina's. "Tell your friends that we are not enemies." It seems such a strange remark, even though she utters it in a friendly tone of voice, while smiling serenely. Strange enough to hang in his mind as he hurries back.

Yuri ponders the situation. "If we're going to be travelling that far... hmm. We've seen several kinds of magic that can cover a lot of ground in a hurry. We even went into the Labyrinth once, and that can go... well, everywhere. I wonder if there's a way we could make these feather-portals work for us for a change."

Harald says, "Hmm. D'you think the Emperor's people have 'em worked out yet?"

Sonja looks at Yuri with a puzzled look on her face. "Feather portals? What do they do?"

Yuri shrugs. "Considering how far we have to go, it's worth the diversion, I think." He answers Sonja. "Roughly speaking, you light them on fire, and a pillar of fire appears over them - a pillar that is also a doorway. Our enemies have used them to teleport in the past, and we know that Ferg, damhiseyes, had some of the feathers." He rummages around in his bag. "I think we still have a few."

Octavian looks a bit skeptical. "Burning feathers stink."

Sonja says, "So do you have some of these magical feathers on your person?"

Yuri says, "I think I do, but we shouldn't be pulling them out in public. You can never tell who might covet them."

Sonja nods in agreement, cities are strange places to her. She thinks back to Falan and has a thought. "Have you ever gone through one of these portals with a horse?"

Yuri shakes his head. "We've never found one when we were riding. I do think that they might be able to accept a horse, though, we had some signs that shapeshifters could use them, perhaps in animal form."

Yuri has another thought. "Have you ever seen anything like that in your travels?"

Harald says, "No, I've seen nothing like that. "

Yuri nods. "Well. We gave most of them to His Nibs for study. It might be worth checking what they came up with. It will be weeks of travel otherwise, and time is against us."

Sonja feels all these different ideas go flittering about her, so many strange ideas and suggestions. She feels a need for prayer so she sits down not mindful of where and starts to pray in earnest to Oak, asking Her for assistance in getting to whereWillowthen's house quickly since party members do not want to squander time that could cost more people their lives. She keeps her head bowed and eyes closed as she prays.

Yuri leads the party to shade in an otherwise-empty city square, so Sonja may pray in peace while the others consult.

Harald says, "It's certainly worth checking on."

Sonja keeps praying, seeking guidance from Oak. Unmindful of where the party is.

Octavian says, "I don't know about the rest of you, but I need to go pack."

Yuri nods. "You know where to find us when you are ready, Master Locke."

Octavian says, "When should we reassemble the company?"

Harald says, "In the morning, I'd think. Yuri and I need to talk to the Emperor's wizards, and you need to pack."

Octavian says, "I thought we were in a bit of a hurry."

Harald says, "We are. But it's worth spending an afternoon to see if we can chop out a couple weeks of travel."

Yuri says, "That's why we'll be busy this afternoon. Tomorrow we'll either have a way to travel quickly, or be faced with a lot of travelling slowly."

Octavian shrugs, "As you wish. I'll see you tomorrow then."

Octavian accidentally bumps into Sonja as he turns to go.

Sonja gets rocked by a bit of contact, her eyes flutter open and stare distractedly. She steadies herself and nods as Master Locke apologizes and mumbles about the company meeting up tommorow. She grows alarmed. "How can we meet on the 'morrow when all this time we were saying we must go now? Many lives are at stake, we can not afford to tarry any longer because this is a long journey. Either we try a feather now or we do not. IF we do not, then we must pack and ride now."

Harald says, "Sonja, we need to find out if we _can_ use the feathers. That'll take time, but it's a few hours today which we can make up if we have three weeks of travel ahead risked against cutting the trip down to nothing."

Yuri sighs. "We could meet tonight, if we do not mind our leaving being under cover of darkness... hey, that sounds like a good idea."

Harald says, "If you like travelling by night. With walking dead on the prowl, I'm not sure this is a good idea."

Yuri says, "The living have always been more dangerous, for I am sure it is ultimately a mortal that has stirred up all this trouble."

Sonja says, "Can we try the feathers while we travel? If they do not work we have not lost any more time testing them. People are dieing, we must be as quick as possible. For their sakes. The land itself is sick also."

Sonja sighs in impatience, "No wonder Oak never answered me."

Sonja looks about at the silent empty streets that only resound with the wind and the noises of the party. "Do what you want, lets get back to our quarters to pack at least."

After a quick bout of packing, the party looks at one another. The chancellor awaits, with what items he can offer. As does the Emperor's research staff.

Harald says, "We need to find out if we can cut this journey short. I am going to go talk to the wizards. Anyone coming along?"

Yuri says, "I'd like to. They'll remember when we turned those feathers over."

Sonja holds her saddle bags in hand as she hears you two discuss this plan. "I will visit Master Locke and inform him of the change in plans. Once I assist him with his packing, we will await the rest of the party at the Mar Gate."

Yuri nods. "Very well, then."

Quickly splitting up, Yuri, Harald and Andreth head for the castle. The Chancellor is tired, and harried, but still willing to help, providing the nunchakus Andreth has requested. A short spear is available for Harald's perusal, and rations are handed out willingly and as many as the company can carry.

Moving quickly on to the researchers, the three find the answers not quite as easy to follow here. There's only one researcher, and he isn't quite sure what the feathers are. "Focii. They function as focii. Somehow they tie together certain locations, but I am not ... not certain how. Nor how the locations are controlled." He pauses. "There are other focii, of course. We have found a few, but none that will send you in the direction you want to go. For that, you would need a focus for Wilthorwen's peak."

Yuri asks, "What's the northernmost focus you've found?"

Harald nods. "Even a sending partway would help."

The man pauses, and thinks, before diving into his desk. "Here. This little rock. It's from the bottom of Agla's waterfall. We're not entirely certain how to trigger it, but it certainly seems t be a focus. We have ..." He dives back in. "We have exactly two left."

Yuri frowns. "The feathers led to many different places. If this is so specifically focussed - to its home location - how could the feathers be tied to anywhere? Birds aren't places."

The man shrugs. "We don't understand that yet. Some function as anchors. Some function as ... as maps?"

Harald says, "It's sympathetic magic, Yuri. The feather provides the sympathy to flight for rapid movement. The focus ties the flight to a particular end-point."

Yuri mulls this over. "Do you think you can activate it, Harald? We can try when we have the others assembled. If it works, it will save us half the trip. If not... well, no harm in trying." _Or we could ask Ferg... but are we ready for that?_

Yuri makes a respectful bow to the researcher. "You may have helped us a great deal, if this works. And if not... well, we're no worse than we were before. Thank you."

The researcher nods. "Well, take them with my blessing. We need all the help we can get."

Harald calls the party to a halt once they've ridden out of sight of the walls of the Citadel. "Now, if I've got this right, we need to build a fire. A big one. I'll set the focus stone at the center of the fire, and when it's lit, I'll add the feather. If this works, we should be able to step through the fire to the other side."

The fire blazes merrily, the stone resting quietly in its center. When the feather is lit, the fire blazes up in great gouts of flame, and then a portal appears to open. Within seconds, however, it collapses again.

Yuri looks crestfallen. "So far, and yet so far." He shrugs. "Now we know. And now we can get on the move."

Harald scowls, making notes of everything he saw or sensed. "Almost. I wonder what I missed?"

After the fire is doused, Yuri picks up the stone in a gloved hand. He starts, and then removes his gloves, juggling the stone. "Totally cool. How odd."

Harald says, "That's ... interesting. If we try it again, we should probably burn the feather more slowly. You told me there was a bonfire once, but that may have been irrelevant."

Andreth shrugs. "Or mebbe they had more feathers."

Yuri says, "I do recall the portal lasting as long as the key that was burned. Perhaps too large a fire burns the feather too quickly?"

Harald says, "Maybe. But they did mention that they usually burned the things in a brazier. Probably should try that. Maybe a frying pan would do..."

Yuri chuckles. "We could try again now, or wait until later. Or just resign ourselves to a long trek. What say ye?"

Sonja busies herself with checking Gewn's girth strap to ensure it is snug enough before proceeding on to check bit and bridle, making sure the bit is not rubbing Gwen's mouth. Satisfied with taht; she checks each hoof for stones. Taking a small pick she removes one stone. After checking the saddlebags, Sonja puts one foot into a stirrup and with praticed ease is back in the saddle where she surveys the environment.

Harald says, "We can try it again; we've got an idea of what went wrong. Shall we?"

Yuri nods. "Last feather, then. Any way you slice it we're going to have a hell of a time getting back."

Harald says, "If we're successful, that'll not be a problem. And maybe Wilthorwen would help."

Andreth nods. "Aye. If'n we c'n do what we need ta do, then we ain't in such a big hurry ta get back."

Harald starts a small fire this time, setting a cooking pot over it as a brazier and placing the stone inside with the feather. "Keep your fingers crossed, but be ready to move.... Now!" He lights it, grabbing the reins of his own horse and watching for the portal to form.

Sonja decides to observe the proceedings of this experiment.

Again, the portal forms, now some feet above the ground. It holds for a few moments ...

... big enough for a horse and rider to charge through ...

Yuri sees something, and shouts, "Wait! It's waving too much!"

... and collapses.

Harald reins up, frustrated by another failure. "Waving too much? What did it look like?"

Yuri says, "It was unsteady. The others we've seen, were more focussed... more solid. And they all lasted a lot longer than that, several minutes sometimes."

Harald says, "Hmm. But then, what did we do wrong?"

Yuri shakes his head. "I don't know. Maybe we'll find out. These things keep crossing our path. We could go beat the answer out of Ferg, but I'm not sure that wouldn't make a bigger mess than we're already in."

Harald sighs, and retrieves the cookpot and the stone. "Oh, well. Let's ride on, then."

Yuri looks over the newcomers, now the majority of the White Company. _I hope Starguard catches up soon. And that he has enough brains to ask the Chamberlain where we went._ "Yeah. Here we go again."

Sonja poses a question to the veteran members of the party. "Any other time when you used an object for teleportation like these feathers, they were always destroyed in the process correct?"

Yuri nods. "Yes. The feather was consumed, and whatever 'focus' item there was... we never found it afterwards."

Sonja says, "So how come the rock still exists?"

Harald says, "Probably because we did it wrong."

Disappointed by the lack of success of their experiments, the party beats a hasty retreat to Citadel, where Yuri finds rooms for everyone.
