# Birthright 2004-10-22

As the party rests fitfully, knocks are heard on doors, and soon a small group of guards is herding the still sleepy adventurers to the dining room. They're very polite, but very insistent that everyone assemble in the dining room **now**. Even if the dawn is still a bare shade of light in the sky.

Harald grumbles but dresses quickly, following his guide. "What's gone wrong?"

Yuri stumbles downstairs. "What's the fuss... we didn't do it. Whatever it is."

Sonja tries to put things together. In town. The guards are recognizeable, so while still half asleep she decides to go along and see what is up after hastily donning some attire.

In the dining room, the chancellor is leaning against one of the tables. His expression is ... still as he watches the guards herd the adventurers into the room. Eyes narrowed, shoulders straight, he finally steps away from the table. "Gentlemen. Lady. The Emperor sends me to express his concern. You were the last group to leave the City, yesterday. The first to return."

Examining pristine fingernails, the Chancellor waits. He does not give the impression of amiability today. Or helpfulness. Or joy at being up at this ungodly hour.

Yuri shrugs. "We tried an experiment in teleportation. It failed. It was safer to return here than ride on. Today we ride again."

Harald says, "We have been gathering information and experimenting. We believe we know where to go, now; we will be leaving shortly, with your permission."

Sonja looks at the obviously simmering Chancellor and has a bad feeling about this.

The Chancellor raises a single eyebrow at Yuri's response. "Ah. Safer." He pauses. He looks at the guard. "Perhaps we should send along a few of our surviving guards, to keep you safe?"

Sonja gulps

"We came back," Harald says, glaring at Yuri, "To compare notes with your wizards on a failed experiment. It was not a matter of safety."

"Or perhaps the Emperor should accompany you? In case you feel threatened?" He stops. "Except that the emperor can't. He has spent all his power, all his energy, trying to heal the dying. But even so, he took time from his rest to send me, in case you were badly wounded. Or in case you needed more aid. Aid he will give, if it kills him." The Chancellor looks grim. "He has ... faith in you."

The Chancellor looks at Harald. "Obviously, then, I will render you aid in your endeavour. Come. We will roust our young wizards out of bed."

Yuri frowns.

Nodding at the guards, the Chancellor leaves the inn. Outside, horses await the Chancellor and the guards; a simple coach provides transport for the party. As eager as the Chancellor, the driver whips up the horses as soon as everyone is inside, and in moments the coach is careening through the mostly empty streets. Corners are taking at the same impressive speed, the guards cantering to keep up.

Thus, in far fewer moments than usual, the party sweeps through the gate, which is held open for them, before finally coming to a stop near one of the smaller wings. Two guards rush inside, while the others escort the Chancellor, and the adventurers, at a more sedate clip to a small meeting room.

Time barely passes when three disgruntled young men stumble into the room, still wearing robes over nightgear. Rubbing sleep out of their eyes, they look at the adventurers, and then at the Chancellor. "Yes?" the bravest of them tries?

Yuri sighs, and pulls out one of the multi-colored feathers, and a small stone. "We need to get far to the north. In a great hurry. We were given this stone from the waters below Agla's Falls. We have seen these feathers burned before, which opens a portal. In the past we have used these portals to travel great distances."

Harald nods. "We did some experiments yesterday, and this is what happened..." He goes into a brief but detailed description of what they had tried and what occurred.

The young man nods. "Yes, Yuri. I know. I remember. We gave you those stones because we hoped **you** might be able to solve the riddle. Thus far, we haven't. All we know, and that on the Emperor's words, is that they seem tied to Agla's Waterfall. We don't know more than that." The man turns to Harald. "We get wavering portals when we burn feathers, but ... we have no way of predicting where they open up." He shrugs, and turns to the Chancellor, who looks grim.

Yuri says, "The feathers are destroyed in the process. How might we destroy a stone, as burning destroys a feather?"

The man shrugs. "Usually, when you want to destroy a stone, you grab a hammer, and you whack it. Ask any convict." The Chancellor nods, muttering something under his breath about gravel for roads.

Sonja gulps again and says a silent prayer to Oak.

Yuri frowns. "That seems... too simple."

Harald says, "Hardly seems appropriate for a spell... still, it might work."

The second man looks at the Chancellor, and bites his lip. Then he shrugs, and turns to Yuri. "Yesterday we were worried that you were still here, but impressed that of all the parties you were the only one that didn't plunder the Emperor's cache of magic items. Now I'm just surprised. And tired."

Sonja keeps praying quietly.

The Chancellor nods, too. "Yes. We were surprised at your modest needs, considering the situation is so grave. You continue to surprise us." The Chancellor doesn't look like a man who likes surprises, mind you.

Harald says, "With any luck, we will surprise our enemies, as well. It does little good to go charging off in all directions at once without a plan."

Yuri shrugs. "We are not greedy. What we needed most, was to travel quickly. Even the Brothers of the Waters have little mastery of that kind of magic. And so our attempts to make a breakthrough seemed wise."

Harald says, "A calculated risk. The loss of a few hours, versus the possible savings of weeks. It did not work out as we'd hoped, but... we'll try again on the road. We may yet figure it out."

The Chancellor looks at Yuri. "Every other group pestered me, at length, for descriptions of the opponents they might expect to face. We know you've already faced them; you have everything you need to overcome them?"

Yuri frowns. "Am I to understand... that when you opened the armory... you really weren't holding back?"

The Chancellor looks at Yuri. "No. The empire could well die, if we don't solve this. If you don't solve this. And if the Empire doesn't die, the odds are good that the Emperor will kill himself trying to heal everyone. Against that, the Emperor opened up his entire warehouse. Arms were the first to be snatched up; if you had come earlier there were stronger weapons available."

Harald shrugs. "I have sufficient weapons, myself. If there is some sort of protective magic I've overlooked, it would not be amiss."

Andreth rubs his chin. "Other things too. I'm pretty good at goin' unseen an' unheard, but if ye've got anythin' that'll help wi' that..."

Yuri says, "Then if he's got any potions that can cancel fatigue or remove the need for sleep we'll take them. Since we're going into rough country, if you have clothing that is enchanted to protect against extremes of temperature, those would also be of use."

Harald says, "And healing potions, if any are left, though with the current emergency..."

The Chancellor looks at Andreth, almost happy at the request. "We have a cloak of Ungfallen's Hall, and boots that match. Few people requested those, and we still have one set left. We also have, which the youngsters may appreciate, two pairs of Glacier boots."

Yuri says, "And the means to avoid sleep, so that we can ride night and day, since faster means of travel are elusive?"

Harald says, "Anything that permits flight?"

Yuri thinks, _If the old man says anything about coffee..._

The Chancellor sighs. "Flight, alas, those rings were snapped up. As were the boots of speed. We outfitted two whole parties to fly." He pauses, and one of the young wizards disappears. "The stock of the more common potions is low; we still have three potions of heroism, however, and a half dozen of the lesser restoration ones. We were saving those for you on lady Marilan's suggestion."

Sonja clears her throat, "Lord Chancellor, is there perhaps items in the armory that could assist us in dealing with the undead?"

Harald nods. "Thank her for us, then. We did make some interesting discoveries when we talked to Oak's daughter, and we are going to be visiting the Twins."

Yuri frowns at this. "If they'll see us. If it's possible. Oh, one more thing. We need a hammer."

Sonja looks askance at Yuri, "Buy one in the market."

The Chancellor nods at Sonja. "Yes. The weapons, unfortunately, are gone. But we have a number of possibles. There's a strange set of goggles that seem to petrify opponents. Everyone else avoided that one. And then we have ... Ah. Yes. There are two rings left." He pauses a moment. "The Emperor ... is going to be spending a lot of effort restocking his warehouse. However, he still has two rings left; both can store spells. And we have a small hammer left; from Ungfallen's children, it's suitable for mining. Will that suffice?"

One of the wizards speaks up. "We have those mirrored goggles too, sir. We **think** they make the wearer immune to gaze attacks."

Harald says, "Spell storing? This sounds like something I could use. And ... the goggles sound like an interesting combination."

Yuri says, "We'll pass on the goggles. The hammer would be more than adequate." And then just bites his tongue. _Now is not the time to speak, old boy. Now is the time to just take the hint._

"And sir? We have that one ring? Not warmth, like the gentleman was asking, but ..." He pauses. "It's the regeneratin' ring, sir. We've been working on it; we think this one heals the body's strength and such, rather than wounds directly."

Yuri says, "Have you any rings, as this one that Andreth carries, that reduces the need for sleep?"

The Chancellor shakes his head. "No; those are all gone. The only one we have left ... is on the emperor's hand."

Yuri nods.

Harald says, "He needs it more than we do, I think."

"An' one of ye needs it more than I do," says Andreth, slipping the ring of sustenance from his finger. "Tilara once told me that she couldna cast more spells less'n she had a full night's sleep. But there's nothin' I do that needs it."

Andreth nods to the Chancellor. "An' me master once told me o' belts that'd give the wearer strength or speed. Do ye have anythin' o' that sort?"

The third wizard speaks up. "I finished those two backpacks, sir, last night. The ones that store much more than you'd expect? I would gladly donate them."

The Chancellor looks at Andreth. "Speed? Strength? No. But ... there weren't a lot of young men like you. We may have just the belt for you." He pauses, and consults his memory. "Yes. It's an older one, a little frayed, but still quite usable."

Yuri says, "Yes. That sounds like it was made for him."

Sonja looks intently at the third wizard. She asks, "how much can they hold? How much do they weigh full?"

"As near as we can figure, miss, mebbe twenty pounds or so, in each side pouch, and about eighty in the main? We didn't test to destruction, mind."

"And as for weighing? Well, it never seems to weigh more than a handful of pounds." The wizard gulps, and hands them both to Sonja.

Sonja rubs her hands together at the impressive stats on those backpacks. "May I take them off your hands then? I can store so much in there. And I bet Master Locke would like to have one."

The Chancellor smiles. "Ah, yes. Our young Locke smith. He's been very quiet. I wonder ..." He pauses.

Yuri says, "Please be sure to put some trail food in those packs. It wouldn't do to die of something as mundane as starvation."

After a brief moment, the Chancellor smiles. "Well, young Locke, this vest may not aid you in fighting, but it may aid you in solving other problems." With that, he pulls a plain vest out of a box, and hands it over.

Sonja looks over at Harald, "May I have those reflective goggles? Might help me when turning things."

Harald nods. "Certainly."

Sonja says, "I think I hear our coach outside. We dare not dawdle any longer I think."

Harald nods. "The sun's up. Let's not waste any more time."

Sonja frets and hopes Gwen has been fed.

After handing the last of the items to the party, the Chancellor escorts them back to the coach. With a few short wishes of good fortune, the adventurers are conveyed back to the inn, still at top speed, and dropped off unceremoniously in the inn's front yard.

Yuri says, "Since we're already up... perhaps we should be off."

Harald says, "I think so. Everyone still packed?"

"Before we go again..." says Andreth slowly, "There're some more things ye all should see." With that, he pulls aside a sheet to reveal a gleaming set of plate armor, and a number of smaller items. "Ash an' Tilara owned these when they died," he says. "They don't need 'em so much where they are now."

Sonja coughs on the dust created by the hasty exit of the coach. She also notes how empty the streets are and looks up at the sky. "We have plenty of time to ride today."

Yuri looks away from the items Andreth presents, stung by the pain of absence. "Yes," he still admits, "We need to determine who most benefit from those things now."

Andreth runs his hand along the shoulder of the armor, then reaches down. "I think ye could use this best," he says, handing a slender rune-engraved wand to Harald. "She called it a wand o' magic missiles." A pair of boots is handed to Octavian, with the explanation that they grant its wearer extraordinary speed and jumping ability - though of course in Andreth's far simpler diction.

Harald takes the wand, solemnly. "Thank you. I'll use it in her honor."

The mighty longbow, a pair of gauntlets granting magical strength, and a special quiver with an unexpectedly large collection of fire arrows, is offered to Sonja, who takes them with obvious reluctance. However, she is adamant about not taking the armor, and Andreth sighs. "It served 'im well," he says softly, before reverently wrapping it again. "I'll take it wi' me. It'll remind me o' him."

Last but not least, Andreth turns to the remaining member of the original White Company. "Bracers o' armor, like mine but better. Her ring. An' these," he says, offering the strange rods to Yuri. He demonstrates with one of them how, with a press of a button, it will hover in midair and take his full weight without visible means of support.

Yuri says, "Just for now. I'm holding onto them. Later we'll give them back." _Or say goodbye..._

Sonja carefully accepts all of these items and quickly vanishes to the stables to sort out her gear and its new additions. She ties the new quiver on opposite side where 100 arrows are already stored. She straps one backpack behind her saddle and slips all of her rations and rations for her horse in there, there is still much room to spare. She checks the saddle straps and bridle. She tsk-tsks softly and grooms out Gwen's coat with a brush. She next equips herself with the gauntlets.

Sonja carefully leads Gwen out with the other horses' reins tied to the horse in front. All of the horses are equipped with saddles, bridles, and what gear was in saddle bags\[untouched\]. "Are we ready?"

Sonja says, "We better get going. No matter what we maybe sleeping in the saddle as one stays awake."

Harald says, "We won't make time by killing the horses. But we can push for a few days."

Sonja says, "A steady pace with occasional rest stops will cover more ground than running the horse flat out for a few short hours ever will."

The horses seem eager, and spring down the road happily, beginning the morning with a canter before steadying down into a groundkilling trot. There are few other people on the road; most have already fled, or died, or won't be leaving. A late lunch stop in Cariston, and after pushing on till evening, the party finds a meadow of sorts to camp in. There's water available, though not much of it. Not much cover either. But it will suffice ...

Yuri says, "I'd like to try something. Stay on the horses for a moment." He fishes out the focus stone and the hammer, and gets ready to smash it. "If this works, then we'll have made a lot more ground today. If not... it's five minutes of our time where we wouldn't be moving anyway."

Harald says, "Shouldn't that be in a fire?"

The first tentative tap of the hammer smashes the rock into dust. As the rock ceases to exist, a portal springs into existence above it. The edges are strong, and wide; enough room for two people to ride through, abreast.

Yuri says, "Apparently not. Go! Now!"

Harald spurs his horse forward. "Go!"

Yuri grabs for his reins and leads his horse through.

Sonja hayups Gwen's reins and she leaps into a trot.

Andreth and Locke, needing no further encouragement, spur their horses forward into the flickering portal right behind the others.

On the other side of the portal, the group find themselves in a dank dark cave. The far end glimmers and shimmers, as waves of water fall down a cliff, letting sunlight slowly enter. There's a strong, unpleasant stench, and the horses begin to buck.

Sonja slaps her thigh in exasperation at falling off her horse. She hastily checks on Gwen.

Yuri is distracted by the stench and gets kicked by his horse. Fortunately, the pain masks the effects of the foul smell. "Hey, wait... that's familiar..."

The horses, panicking, race for the cave's entrance. There, they balk just in time to avoid going through the water and down the waterfall. Meanwhile, in the other end of the cave, shadows whisper and corpses shamble forwards, their stench permeating the cave.

Andreth falls from his horse, and lands heavily on the ground, turning his ankle. He takes one lungful, and coughs heavily. "Ugh..." he says. Odors notoriously form strong memory associations, so it takes the monk only moments to place the stench. "Ware undead!"

The stench hits Harald hard as he rides through the portal, and when Dawnstar bucks a moment later, he hits the ground hard. "Gah. What is..." The thought goes uncompleted as he vomits. He fumbles the new wand out, lightning bolts being a bad idea when he can't focus.

Sonja holds her shield in front of her as she commands the assorted foul creatures to begone in the name of Oak. Her words seem to have some effect as two of the creatures retreat into the darkness.

As two of the shambling figures retreat from Sonja's display of holy might, Andreth drops a bag into his sling, winds up, and lets it fly. Unfortunately, the bag of goo splashes harmlessly past the creature. As he moves into a guard position, he calls out, "Fall back, Sonja! They'll be comin' fer ye now! An' all of ye, try not ta let 'em touch ye!"

More of the undead converge on Sonja though, as they notice her turning. First a shadow dlows over her, leaving her weaker, before a shambling corpse descends on her, gnawing on her shoulder.

Yuri steps up between Sonja and the attacking undead, and swings at the more substantial one, carving a shallow cut in it. _Been a while since I had to do this..._

Harald aims Tilara's wand at the nearest shadow and fires it, three firey bolts streaking out and plunging into it. He staggers to his feet, trying to stay away from the hideous shambling creatures.

The second shadow flows over Sonja, flowing over, under, through her armour, sapping her strength in waves of cold. Meanwhile, the last ghast turns to Yuri, trying to catch him unawares. A hard thing to do, when your stench is as bad as that shambling corpse's is.

Sonja feels her lifeforce being sucked out of her from the attacks by these undead creatures. As she sways, she summons the last of her strength and concentration. She once again calls upon Oak to assist her. Tapping the special power of the shield tied with her call to Oak, Sonja blasts three of the monsters away. She sags against Gwen.

With a rattle of chain, Andreth's enchanted nunchaku leave the belt and flash through the air, and he leaps to put the ghast between himself and Yuri, as the wooden shafts smack against the undead flesh. "Let's finish this 'un off an' get outta here, afore the rest come back!"

Harald aims the wand again, the triplet bolts sinking into the ghast attacking Yuri. "Die, you foul thing."

Sonja feels a potion being shoved into her hand and is told to drink it. She gulps it down without bothering to argue. Something happens as she feels her strength start to return.

Gathering themselves, calming the horses, the party looks around the cave once more. Harald moves out to the curtain of water, testing it first with a hand, which is quickly smacked down by the water. Sidling to the cave's edge, he finds a little room at the side of the curtain. As he looks down ... and down ... and down ... there's easily a hundred feet between him and the lake at the bottom of the falls.

Harald says, "I hope we can go farther in. I don't think I can fly everyone down from here."

Sonja surveys the wounds of the party, she realizes she is the worse off. Holding her Holy Symbol in her hands she casts a spell of Cure Light Wounds upon herself and is restored 8 hit points. She thanks Oak for all Her blessings.
