# Birthright 2004-10-29

The cave is deep, dark, and dank, as the waterfall blocks what little light is available. The ash of the ghasts lies where it fell. Those, that is, that were utterly destroyed. The others have vanished into the depths of the cave. Looking around, the party notices that while the cave was undoubtedly natural, men have modified it. There are narrow shelves hacked into one of the walls. Shelves that are currently empty, with the exception of a single burlap sack.

Octavian eyes the sack warily...

Yuri stays between Sonja and the tunnel where the monsters fled. "This is... not what I'd expected."

Octavian says, "looks okay."

Andreth shrugs. "I wuz expectin' we'd be close ta the waterfall, an' that's bout it. An' I kinda figger we oughta expect undead _anywhere_, these days."

Octavian opens the sack.

The burlap sack is dusty. Not to mention almost entirely empty. There's a bit of lint in the bottom, and a smear of ... closer examination reveals that the smear is a remnant of silver paste. The nasty, smelly kind that adds a really good sheen to silver.

Harald murmurs the Detect Magic cantrip and looks around the cave, wondering what there is to see.

Sonja prays over her Holy Symbol and asks Oak's assistance to find if any more undead are nearby. She finishes her prayer and detects no undead within 60ft. Putting her Holy Symbol up, she looks around. "Shall we go? No undead within 60ft of us. Praise be to Oak."

Sonja ensures the magic shiled is secure on her arm while that hand holds Gwen's reings. In her other hand she holds her Holy Symbol. She gets ready to move out, but waits for est of the party.

Moving deeper into the cave, the walls curve, finally stretching into a long, narrow passage way that squeezes past stalactites and stalagmites. The ceiling is high overhead, but the sides of the passage are uncomfortably close, leaving just enough room for the horses. Again, there's evidence of mining in a few places where the rock presses overly closely.

Yuri rubs a hand over the walls as he passes. "What were they digging so high up the cliff? Iron? Silver?"

As the passage widens a bit, a cold breeze blows crosswise, catching Yuri.

Yuri stops. "Wait. Back up a bit. I felt a breeze." He inspects the walls on either side.

The walls here look unworked, but high above there's a small hole. It looks natural enough; no obvious markings from picks or hammers. Instead, the sides of the hole are coated with growing stalactites.

The party discusses what might be above the hole for a minute or so, and then Harald smiles. "Never mind. I'll check it out." He places his familiar on his shoulder, then concentrates on an intricate series of gestures, accompanied by the words that most people can't remember. A moment later, his form shrinks and twists, and then there are two bats, who flit up to the hole.

The hole is dark, and unlit, but the bats' sonar reveals moving creatures inside. Creatures that seem disturbed.

Harald chirps to B.T. _Lots of little things. Better get back down and warn the others, quick._ They dive back down the hole, Harald reforming to his human self as soon as he gets close to the ground.

Behind Harald, a swarm of batlike creatures come bursting out of the hole. The tiny creatures attack immediately, converging on the bat ... and on the young sorceror.

Octavian weaves a protective shield of arcane energy before him.

Harald concentrates on his spell as the creatures swarm. "Sleep!"

All around Harald, sleeping critters fall to the ground, collapsing in mid air.

Although two remain upright, and mobile, and up in the air. The latched ones, though, have sloughed off.

Andreth strides forward without comment. Not bothering to draw a weapon, he simply swings a fist at one of the fluttering creatures, causing it to divert its course for a moment...

... but not so far that the creature can't latch on to Harald, who is once more covered in oversized mosquitoes.

Octavian draws his blade and strikes one of the creatures.

Harald casts his own magic missile spell, the bolts blasting the last one into shreds. "Damned things. A good thing you noticed that hole, Yuri." He helps smash the rest of the creatures.

Yuri says, "Dunno about that, friend. If I hadn't noticed the hole, we might not have disturbed them. This is a foul place. Let's be off."

After the last of the little creatures is dispatched, and the blood is wiped off Harald's clothes, the party resumes their trek. After squeezing past a few turns, the stench hits Yuri's nostrils, as he smells dead and decaying corpses.

Yuri pulls up short and waves back to the party, miming a sour face.

Harald sniffs the air as he comes up to where Yuri is standing, and realizes why Yuri has stopped. "Go in ready, this time? I can probably get them both with a bolt."

Cautiously moving forward, following the widening tunnel, Yuri soon realizes that the tunnel is widening out into a much wider cave. One that has obviously been inhabited, given the bunk beds he can see, before his attention switches to the moving, swaying corpses that have just noticed his existence.

Yuri spots the two shambling figures and attempts to carve one up before it can react. Unfortunately, he's startled and distracted by the stench, and misses with his strike, stepping backwards quickly to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with those coming from behind him.

Octavian draws his bow.

Yuri steps up into range of the monster, retching again, more than a little distracted by the stench. He carves a solid chunk out of the foul being, allowing Andreth to come up and engage.

As the ghast screeches and turns to face Yuri, there's a motion of cloth from beside him, and Andreth's face appears behind the hood of Ungfallen, followed shortly by two powerful blows that smash into the thing's rotting flesh, and finally a roundhouse kick that slams its broken body against the wall.

Sonja brings her Holy Symbol in front of her where it combines with the shield as she begins praying to Oak to turn this fell creature and make it run away. Alas this time her prayer is not answered.

Harald growls the harsh words of the missile spell again, and four golden bolts fly from his fingertips into the last undead.

Lumbering forward, the remaining ghast focuses on Yuri, catching him in a random swip of the head.

Yuri snarls, his aim for his next stroke spoiled by the long gash the monster opens on his arm. "Dammit! Kill this thing... again!"

Andreth does his best to oblige. An axe-kick whirls the ghast around, only to catch a quick jab toward its jaw, and it only barely manages to swing out of the way of Andreth's counterpunch.

Octavian rapidly puts two arrows into the foul beast. It slumps down, moving no more.

No longer distracted by the moving, swaying, rapidly decaying corpses, the party presses forward, examining the cave. What they find is a large room. One that used to be inhabited, considering the four double bunkbeds, arranged alongside the walls. Two on the left, then another tunnel, a bed, a stretch of wall, the fourth double bunk bed, and that brings you back to where you are. In the center, a small depression has been turned into a firepit.

Yuri sits down on a bunkbed, and sees to the gash on his arm. "Ow... Sonja? Can you help me?"

As Yuri sits down, puffs of dust fly up, momentarily enveloping him.

Harald shifts to bat again, and explores around the room and a little ways into the next tunnel.

Sonja carefull steps around the remains and bends down to examine the wounds. She coughs at all the dust, "That will not help the healing all that dust. How do you feel Yuri?"

Octavian begins to carefully make a circuit of the place, looking nowhere in particular whilst seemingly noticing everything.

Yuri stands carefully and moves off a few feet before breathing again. "It sliced me pretty good and I have a headache from the stench. Can you help?"

Andreth watches Octavian's circuit around the room, and an idea comes to him. "Locke... ye wanna take a closer look at this wall o'er here? Seems odd that they'd have this empty spot b'tween the beds."

Octavian nods to Andreth... and peers intently at the wall.

Sonja examines the wounds some more. Holding her Holy Symbol she begins to pray over the wound. As she invokes Oak's name to help in the healing, she touches the wound with her Holy Symbol. The wound seems to heal some. Feeling no more healing energy, Sonja breaks the spell while giving thanks to Oak.

Yuri says, "Hey, Harald, don't go too far. Come back here until we're ready to move on?"

Yuri wraps his arm carefully in a cloth. "That does feel better. Thank you."

Octavian frowns, "Stand back folks... we may be blowing up in here."

Octavian gently blows on the wall, trying to blow dust out of the crack that caught his eye.

Yuri watches Harald's flying-mouse form. _The Changers had no Bat clan..._

Octavian reaches into his bag and brings out a roll of tools.

Octavian says, "OOps."

Octavian sighs.... "Okay, let's try that again."

Octavian smiles and looks back over his shoulder to wink at Sonja.

Octavian slips the roll of lockpicks out of his vest.

Moving down the tunnel, Harald spots more holes in the ceiling, further along. The tunnel is once more twisty, more of a fault in the rock than a cleanly mined tunnel. After moving a little deeper, he hears Yuri call out and turn around. But mere moments later, he hears the wings as creatures swarm him from behind.

Fleeing back, at full speed, for the comforting presence of the rest of the party, Harald still finds himself overtaken. By the time he reaches the cave, he notices that he is surrounded by the creatures in every direction. There are ... a first estimate place it at over a dozen, all crowding around him.

Harald heads past the others, trying to get beyond the rest of the party so he can shift back to human a bit more safely.

The creatures converge on Harald's small batlike form, crawling over him, dragging him down with their weight as they begin to suck the blood out of him.

Andreth leaps to his feet, and fists fly about the swarm attacking Harald. One solid blow connects, with enough force to punch through two stirges at once.

Harald's small form squeaks in distress as two more of the things latch onto him. Stunned and losing consciousness, he flutters to the ground at Andreth's feet.

Sonja stops in mid-motion of trying to strike at a stirge. Instead she kneels down beside the bat which is covered by stirges and starts to pray to Oak for healing of an injured party member. She cluthces a hand to her Holy Symbol as she does so. She feels the healing energies reach out and touch the bat which stirs with renewed vigor.

And as the bat stirs, the oversized mosquitoes sting the bat, sipping on his blood, pulling it out.

One of the giant insects has latched onto Yuri, which proves to be its messy downfall. The remaining beasts take their toll, however, and Yuri staggers. "I'm in trouble!"

Andreth draws back a boot, then kicks sharply forward, knocking two more of the stirges off Harald's miniature form before they can begin to suck.

And as Andreth moves forward, one of the creatures attaches itself to his arm, happily sucking on his blood.

Harald's small form shimmers, then rapidly grows, the tiny bat expanding into a rather annoyed brown bear.

Sonja makes a hasty exit from the strangely transforming bat and heads over to where Yuri is since it seems he is in grave danger from the stirges attacking him.

Sonja reaches yuri's side and recites a hasty prayer of healing to Oak. Once again it seems Oak is watching out for the party and the prayer is answered. Yuri visibly seems to get better.

As the bat becomes a bear, the stirges stay with him, sucking happily. The more blood, the merrier.

Yuri recovers enough to squash another of the foul insects, dismayed at the site of all the blood on his clothes that was just a moment ago inside of him.

The other sucker digs in a little more, steals a little more of Yuri's blood, and then slowly detaches and begins to fly away.

Buzzing around, the other stirge tries to settle on Sonja's back, but is hampered by her armour.

Andreth grumbles at the monstrous bug, and swipes it off him with a powerful backhand blow, then whirls and aims a careful kick at an insect clinging to the bear's back.

Sonja sees that Yuri is still staggered and weak from all the damage he has suffered so she prays to Oak for healing of him again. She seems to work a minor miracle this time, praise be to Oak.

Even as Sonja is praying, the last creature settles on her back, its proboscis sliding between her armour and through her skin, making merry with her blood.

Hardly has it even begun to suck, however, when Andreth strides over and bashes it with a one-two punch that turns it into insectile pulp.

Sonja falls forward, catching herself with both hands. She looks over her shoulder, "Thanks Andreth."

Yuri drinks one of Lady Marilin's potions and staggers to his feet. "And I thought the zombies were dangerous..."

Harald shifts back to human form and staggers as the blood loss catches up to him. "I _hate_ those things. What do they eat when we're not around?"

Yuri says, "Anything that bleeds."

Sonja picks herself up and walks over to the obviously injured Harald. Holding her Holy Symbol against his flesh she prays to Oak again. And praise Oak, her prayer of healing is answered as Harald is seemingly made whole again.
