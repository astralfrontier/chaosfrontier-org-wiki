# Cyber Chicago 2009-06-28

The man, who will soon (and predictably) be introduced as Mr Johnson, leads the montly crew down the ill lit subway tunnel back to a familiar staircase. An stairway to street. This would be a familiar place to Windwalker. The crew is quiet, save for cursiory introductions. Helmet is introduced as Matt, and the female as Poley. Helmet in particular seems to be rather jumpy down here.

Street around the Lunt access is that special sort of erree clean of those unable to afford to waste dirt. Matt takes over as you rise to Street level, leading the crew to a non descript grey door, a sign above reads simply 'Joe's', streaked with rust and faded with lack of care.

The inside is hardly less inviting than the out, for what seems to be a cafe. Matt waves to the guy behind the counter, and the group takes a booth in the corner. The seats are a ghastly read pleather, ripped with hardly any cusion left in them. The table is white, a fake stome pattern adorning it's top. The light above the table glows a warm, almost yellow light.

Matt starts, "So, we're contracted, by Mr. Johnson here, to go and rescue a young girl from Chicago Aerosol." He scoffs, looking around the bar nerviously. "We have entry. We know aproximate location." He looks at Windwalker.

The young man's eyes glance from face to face through the eyeslits of his hood. "Lead on, Livingston," he says, pointing forward.

Matt shrugs, and Mr. Johns quirks up a little smile then. "Okay. Whatever, man." He says, glancing over to Poley. "Is our entry ready?" The woman leans back, and looks down at something in her hands or on her arm. "It will be by the time we get there." She says, plainly.

"Terms," says Windwalker suddenly. "Find girl. Retrieve girl. How much for all this?"

Mr. Johnson looks at Windwalker. "Your cut would come to $1,500. Paid in cash, of course." The other two make little or no motion.

"Sho'nuff." Windwalker makes ready to follow the others.

Mr. Johnson nods. Matt and Poley get up, and lead Windwalker along Base, walking up and down streets. Occasionally a passer by will note the crew, but there is little note left of the crew. There is an ally there. Down a ways, Matt stops, and pushes a dumpster to once side.

Matt stops. "Okay. Once inside, we should be in a wiring closet. Poley will stop there." He pauses, and hands you over a communicator. Designed to fit around your ear. "Wear this. She will stay put, and hopefully guide us." Poley glares at Matt.

Windwalker reaches up under his tac hood and slips the radio over his ear, wiggling it a bit to fit.

Matt climbs in through the hole. It's about 3' around, big enough for people and things, but still a bit of a tight fit. Matt shuffles to one side, and looks out the hole, finding a light. "This looks like the place.. Come on in."

The closet is still not that well lit. Poley looks along the various conduits present here. Finding one. She looks over at Matt. "This one." She says, pulling a tool out of her wrist. "It'll take a bit..." Going to work on the conduit, to gain access. Matt opens the door, which leads into a cafeteria of sorts.

Empty, at this hour, the cafeteria contains various stainless steel tables, with chairs, that, upon inspection, will be revealed ot be bolted to the ground. A food vendor is installed on one side of the cafe. There's only one obvious exit. "Come on... Let's have a look around." He says, starting to crack the door open.

The cafeteria door opens onto a long corridor. To the south, doors are evenly spaced along the wall.. To the north, the wall is featureless, except about 30 yards ahead, where there's a four way corridor. To the east would be the exterior wall, and a dead end.

There's a crackle at your earpiece as Poley gets online. "Jessus Matt, Can't you wait 30 seconds?" She sighs, "Anyway, straight down the corridor to your west should be a security door. But I can't seem to get access to it. That's got to be the place."

As you guys pass the 4 way interesection, you hear a shout to your right. "Hey!" Matt rolls his eyes, "Couldn't have told us about this either?" He sighs. Down that corridor there's a couple of security guards.

Windwalker ducks backward, pulling one of his pistols out of its holster as he does.

Matt fired a volley down range, and hits one of the guards in the chest. He stands sqaure to them, the bullet finding it's way true. The guards both take shots at Matt.

The bullets fly wildly around, one hitting the side of the corridor, the other making Matt stand to one side. Matt draws a bead on the injured one, and fires off another shot.

Which flies wide of it's mark.

Windwalker comes round the corner, pistol out, and draws a bead on one of the security guards.

The Guards run down the corridor, closing in on you guys, and fire a few more rounds at Matt, who is still presenting such a nice target.

Matt rolls his eyes, "Poley, how far away is the door?" As he too takes an aim at one of the already injured guards. "About 50 yards to the east. Still a ways out." your headset buzzes.

Windwalker squeezes off a few rounds, which fill in some holes in the walls but don't manage to do much to the guards. He steps back behind the corridor's concealment once again, breathing quickly.

The guards continue to close, squeezing off fire around Matt's general area, all shot flying wildly. Matt gently squeezes the trigger.

The shots flying wide of the guards again. Matt glances over at Windwalker, then back at the guards, stepping closer to the other side of the corrider.

Windwalker is more successful with his next few shots, dropping one of the imprudent guards who chose to approach. Then again, he is now himself in the line of fire.

The other guard is not absent this fact. He stands still,a nd takes draws a line on Windwalker. Matt, on the other hand, is trigger happy as can be, and rips some rounds off at the remaining guard.

Matt's bullet hits the guard, but the man doesn't seem to be the worse for it, the bullet lodging itself into his jacket.

Gambling on success, Windwalker holds still to quickly line up a shot, and the gamble pays off. The other security man falls over.

Matt looks at Windwalker. "Well, you can handle yourself in a firefight, anyway." She shrugs. He spends no time with the bodies, and starts walking east, continuing down ther corridor. Poley says, "Look, you guys need to get in and get out quickly. You've redlighted all the patrols." Matt breaks out into a run.

Windwalker draws his other pistol and follows wordlessly.

After a breif run, you guys run into a very conspicious door. Large red letters spell out 'Forbidden' on the door. There is an box to one side, with a palmprint scanner and a keypad on it. "You don't have this open yet?" Matt says, as he looks over the system.

Matt tinkers with the device for a second, then looks back to Windwalker, "You think you can do anything?"

Windwalker peers about for a few seconds. "They have to breathe in there," he observes, thinking aloud.

Matt stares, "Alright. Hey Poley. We're going to need help with this door. And, as you noted, quickly." There's an audible sigh on the communicator system, as Poley packs up, and heads on over. It is a matter of minutes before you see her running up. She stares at the lock, and fiddles with it for a brief time. There's an hiss as the door slides over. "Hurry." She says, shortly.

Inside of the room are chemical showers, and a few clear room type suits, and another door on teh other side. An itnercom voice blares loudly, "Entering clean area. Please take appropriate precautions." Of course, this doesn't seem to be the plan, as Matt opens the opposite door.

The other door slides open with a hiss, and behind it is a young girl, attached to several machines. "I think this is it.." He says.

Windwalker, however, hears a voice. "Are you...?" And then again. There seems to be an air spirit here. "You seem... familiar..." The voice starts out.

"I am Windwalker of the Lodge," the young shaman replies, speaking not to his uninitiated companion but seemingly to the air. "I honor you and the planet."

Matt and Poley both look at Windwalker kind of crosseyed. But the spirit continues. "I have not heard of the Lodge. But I knew of some..." The spirit pauses, and speaks again, ".. that are like you? Or .. In any case, you may call me Hanna."

The young man nods. "Hanna, then. We're here for the girl."

"You may take her, of course..." The spirit says, as if it is unconcerned. By this time, Matt has disconnected the child from the machine, and dragged her into the clean room. "Oh dear.." The spirit says. As the doors snap closed.

The sounds of rushing air is heard, as the air is being sucked out of the room.. It's Matt, you and the girl in the room. Poley is on the other side fo the door.

"Hanna, where does the air flow from this room?" asks Windwalker. He begins twisting his fingers, working his magic to create pockets of air to replace that which is being removed. "Poley - can you open the door, please?"

Hanna's voice seems to be getting faint as the air is being sucked out. "At the vents, near the top..." She says. In the direction of her voice, you can see a large air vent. Poley responds, "I'm trying, trust me.."

"Matt, please block off the vents somehow," Windwalker suggests. "Air is not our concern."

Hanna's voice faces with a simple message, "Seek me out again...." And then, the presence passes, probably sucked out with the air itself.

Matt looks at you with disbelief. He shrugs, and looks for something to try and block the vents with. The point becomes moot however, as the exit door releases itself.

Poley looks around, "We should probably get out of here."

"Faster than expected. Good show, old bean," murmurs Windwalker.

The four run down the hallway, as much as is possible, carrying the girl, who is unconcious, but seemingly still alive. The exit out is uneventful, even with the alarms raised. As the girl is being exited from the building through the access hole, you notice a black car at the end with Mr. Johnson (Or, at least, you assume it's the same. Looks the same) standing outside.

Mr Johnson opens the door, and Matt loads the girl into the car. As the door is shut, the car drives off, and Mr Johnson hands you each an envelope. Inside of yours is the promised $1500, and, with the familiarity of a junky, 2 doses of what you know to be Axon 5. Mr Johnson speaks up. "I trust, Windwalker, we can work together in the future." He says.

"How did you get this?" asks Windwalker, narrowing his eyes. "What do you know?"

The Johnson smiles at Windwalker. "Ah.. your entire fee was in that envelope. Information is money, Mr. Windwalker. If you would like some more, perhaps I have another job for you, yes?"

The shaman pauses, carefully considering. This is a breach of Lodge security as far as he's concerned. He can't just ignore it... "You got it, pilgrim," he says at last.
