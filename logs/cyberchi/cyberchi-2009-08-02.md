# Cyber Chicago 2009-08-02

The ventilation shafts on the building were relatively easy to find. A large, fenced complex surrounds the air conditioning. The fence polls run right into the ground, and even the top is caged off. Signs in various languages warn of high powered current running through the wires.

The magic of the Lodge's hunters is erratic and idiosyncratic. For example, the bars of the cage surrounding the ducts present little barrier to the shaman. On the other hand, the primal fury of the storm - now captured in the electrical current - would actually be a hindrance. Windwalker acts accordingly.

Mindful of security cameras and other monitoring, he prepares a simple device prepared for him by his fellows at the Lodge - an improvised explosive in a can. A capsule once used for over-the-counter pain relief has been hollowed out and filled to capacity with a catalyst used to flash-heat soup cans. This pill is then dropped into a larger container with a mixture of gasoline and a few household chemicals discreetly obtained. Pressure will cause the pill to leak its contents, generating a small explosion.

Shifting into his aerial form, Windwalker discreetly drops the pill into place, and using a whispered spell taught by the sylphs which lurk behind the gloomy clouds of Chicago's skies, he guides it slowly unaided to tumble across the ground toward a crucial breaker. There's a short, sharp bang, and the fence loses its power for a moment. Windwalker surges forward, and in.

A flashing red light atop the structure is the only betrayal of any sort of tampering that seems to be set off by this. The power comes right back on as Windwalker slips past the fence, a generator to his left kicking on with a high pitched whine as power is restored. Quick enough, however.

The input into the venelation system is easy enough to find. He is quickly absorbed into the machine, diffued through several layers of filtering, and popped back out the otherside with the unmistakable stench of clean. Possibly the best bath Windwalker's had in a long while.

More or less at the mercy of the system, Windwalker is in the position of clinging to driftwood amidst a fast-moving river: he can try and exit the system wherever there is a vent into some room, but beyond that he must go where the air takes him, choosing his path but unable to truly stop. This is sufficient; he has magic enough to hold the spell indefinitely and no clear idea of where to go in any case.

The winds of the ventilation system push you through the building at an almost dizzying rate. In one sense, you can feel Hanna all around you, as if you are cradled and supported by you. As soon as you enter the building you can feel her touch. There seems to be a stronger presence leading what seems to be down and further into the heart of the building.

It seems to take a while, but the Windwalker manages to navigate himself into the heart of the building, where Hanna's presence is strongest. He is spit back out into a large chamber, dark. But the air in here is clean, and well circulated. A closet or storage of some sore, surely. Hanna calls out to you, "You have returned..."

"You .. you said to seek you out," says the shaman uncertainly.

The air fills with agreement as you speak. "Yes." Hanna says, slowly. "It has been a while since those of your scent were in my building..." She says. The gravity of her statement is obviously lost on her, sounding more like a lovesick teenager.

"We of the Lodge serve the Planet and the invisible world," continues Windwalker. "We are pledged to support you."

"The Lodge?" She asks. "What a funny name..." She trails off. "Support?" She questions this for a while. "I'm just glad to smell those like you again." Hanna is, as stated previously, love sick. She has missed talking to humans. It seems it has happened recently. She's not being deceptive or controlled in any way.

"Then... it's my duty to be here," says the shaman. "But.. what keeps you in this building? It'd be difficult for me to sneak in here regularly."

"Why would I want to leave my home, now?" Hanna speaks of an air as if you ask the impossible or absurd. She muses for a second.. With her presence so close, and you in air form, her entire emotions threaten to fill you. "Do you know one named Silvertongue?" This name is indeed familiar too you, another of the lodge. An older brother, one who was in the first batch, so to speak.

"Yes. An elder, I think." Windwalker blinks. "Then you know of the Lodge?"

"No. The Lodge I have not heard. I spoke to him..." She thinks for a second, the general confusion apparent around you, "Many years? I believe that is the right term. I was the first who found his mind open..." She trails off. "I should like to speak to him once more." She says.

Windwalker nods slowly. "If you accompany me, I can bring you to him. If you wish for companionship, we can meet outside. And you will always be welcomed among us."

"I cannot travel far from this place.." You sense that she is lying, but she is deeply afraid. "Perhaps you can bring him close to me?" She suggests. "It's been so long since I've heard your voices..." She is filled with fear again...

"I would be willing to accompany you a short way. But I cannot leave this area..."

"Very well." Windwalker considers this for a moment. "I... I can protect you, and keep you safe. Let me speak to Silvertongue, and we'll find a place nearby where we can meet safely. Will that be alright?"

Hanna glows with happiness, "Certainly. I used to talk to Silvertongue almost very day. Then one day, the voices were silent. I couldn't find him anywhere." She asks, "Can I have your name?"

The shaman nods. "In the Lodge, I am Windwalker. Before that... well, that doesn't matter any more."

"We all change.. yes... Lead on, Windwalker?"

You lead Hanna back the way you came, back to the entrance through which you came. As you get to the fence, Hanna calls out, "I can go no further." Again, she's lying, but a crippling fear is holding her in. "When will I see you again, Windwalker? When will you bring me Silvertongue?"

"Soon. I'll go and return right now," the shaman promises. "If you don't see me here soon, look for us at the next three sunrises and sunsets."

Hanna positively tingles with excitement as you state this. It is a simple matter for you to find the emergency breaker, and slip through the fence.
