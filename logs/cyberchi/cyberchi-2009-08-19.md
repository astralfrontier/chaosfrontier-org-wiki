# Cyber Chicago 2009-08-19

With his encounter with Hanna behind him, Windwalker begins thinking as he trudges through the tunnels. His hunter's instincts, honed to a knife edge despite being only months old, allow him to see the marks and observe the rites of security within the tunnels despite his mental preoccupation with a question.

And within the Lodge, he tells his story to the elder named by a strange spirit, a tale of the brief but violent rescue, a story of a corporate employer who knows far too much, and above all a spirit that may be inviting the shamans into a trap.

He explains his concerns: this could all be some sort of arrangement, or at the very least the situation contains a number of unknowns. And he asks for time to meditate and cast his mind adrift into the higher realms, seeking insight from the invisible world.

Silvertongue asks, "Hanna?" He gasps, the recognition on his face is an open book for you to read. "I remember a Hanna. It was long enough ago I thought she was only a vision." He looks off into space. You know from meetings past that often when he gets this stare he's that way for hours...

Windwalker nods slowly. He steps out of the alcove, back into the noisy chaos of the Lodge itself. Passing by two bloodied figures being escorted to their bunks by a third, he absently draws his pistols from their holsters and ejects the half-full magazines one at a time into his hands. He arrives at his own 'bed': a hospital gurney with a footlocker and restraints. Setting the ammo and pistols aside, he fetches construction earplugs from his locker and applies them, then settles in and lays back, staring at the rocky ceiling above.

Another voice, another awareness beckons to him. The Lodge calls it Big Brother: that mirror of his own personality which can see and speak to the spirit world truly. His brain begins the tenuous adjustment from mortal thinking to supernatural thinking, the ascension of consciousness into a higher plane, and the mortal self falls away into the dim recesses of his memory.

Your brain is lifted by Big Brother onto the higher plane. Your vision clears, and you find yourself in the, even after a few months, familiar surroundings of the supernatural. Slowly, out of the coulds of your own mind, Wolf appears to you. A stunning grey timberwolf. He speaks, as he always does, moving his muzzle, and words come out. Wolves should not be able to talk that way. "Why have you come to me, my cub?" He says, not unkindly.

The young shaman briefly describes the situation, including the Johnson who inexplicably knew of the all-important drug - in his mind, this cannot be coincidence. "So I distrust her fear," he concludes.

Wolf ponders on all you tell him. "You have told me a great many things, Windwalker. And I'm afraid our time would be short." He looks at what must be you in this place. "Many of us," He begins, "find ourselves tied to a place. I do not, myself, but a lot of my brothers and sisters have turned inwards during the Long Silence." The Long Silence you have heard of before. The persiod of time where few if any shamans existed.

"It seems likely that this Hanna fears the Silence, as many of the older spirits do." Wolf grufs at this. "There are a few rites to bind a spirit to a place, but fear is not one of them." He looks at you. "Many of the other things you have told me are surprising to me. Especially of this one who has the Axon. This.. Johnson."

"He's a larger, longer concern I have," concedes Windwalker. "I gotta sniff him out. The Lodge needs to be safe."

"This is agreed. Too many of **you** and the spirits might .." He trails off. Perhaps there are not words, or perhaps he is unsure. "Do what you must." Wolf says, "Protect your pack.." He says, as the vision begins to fade.

The vision fades slowly, and your consciousness slowly descends back into this material place. Always such a letdown after you're with the spirits. You are able to quickly find Silvertongue, who has since recovered from his trance. "You must take me to Hanna." he says, anxious for you to depart, but obviously having respected the meditation time.

Windwalker nods. Adjusting his pistols in their holsters once again, he nods his head toward the exit. "Saddle up, pilgrim."

Silvertongue follows Windwalker back to the ventilation system access. Hanna's presence is still there, flitting about nervously as you approach. Silvertongue runs the last few yards, and looks like he's going to touch the fence until something rebukes him sharply. Hanna's aura becomes happy, almost giddy. Silvertongue seems to just stand there, but you know this to be them talking.

Silvertongue is started out of his trance. "We were here!" He cries out... He looks up at the building,a futilie gesture at this level, since all you see is beams overhead. He looks at you, "Do you know what this means!?!?" Somewhat excited in contract to his otherwise stoic outlook.

Windwalker rests his hands on his guns, but says nothing. He remains watchful, and alert, not wholly pacified yet. Like the wolf, he thinks.

"We must fine out about this place." Silvertongue's eyes crazily scan the surroundings. He points at you, finally realizing you're still there, "You! You must find out about this place. We were here!" He cries out. Probably a little loudly.

"Shhh!" Windwalker puts a gun to his lips, realizing belatedly that he's already drawn it and that his thumb rests on the safety. "Tell me everything, elder," he murmurs.

It's a bit too late as the gun is placed to your lips, a voice cries out from behind you, "Hey Fred, he's saving us the trouble, look!" The voice belongs to what isn't exactly the most intimidating looking gentleman in the world. His sidekick, one assumes 'Fred' steps out from the side, carrying, of all things, a block of wood. "You gots lots of toys, man. How 'bout you hand them over."

With his left hand, Windwalker draws a bead on the first man and shoots, not even thinking about it. His shot goes wide, striking the shoulder rather than something more vital, but it's good first move.

The punks look at you as you shoot them. The vocalist, "Hey!" He pulls out a weapon, and plugs a few shots off, but they all miss wide. You hear Silvertongue behind you, "What's that.." It sounds like the Axon is hitting him pretty hard right now. 'Fred' is charging you, brandishing the makeshift truncheon in a menacing way.

Windwalker manages to snap off a kick, connecting with the board Fred was holding. He's slow in lining up his guns for a better shot.

Fred falls backwards, as the first punk starts to close, his gun firing wildly at you as he does so. Becoming a munch better target as he closes himself into yoru space. Silvertongue manages to wander himself to the side, just sweeping past the torrent of strays.

Windwalker's SWAT armor takes a round, leaving little more than a suddenly painful bruise underneath. Finally his own jumbled mind clears for a moment, and the window of lucidity is enough for him to guide his muscles together, returning fire with deadly accuracy.

And the other punk is plugged a couple more times with the shoulder that you hit initially. He does down. His friend Fred has stood up, but is running off. Obviously you look like better marks than you are. You find Silvertongue near the fence, talking again with Hanna.

Windwalker holsters his weapons and quickly rifles the downed punk for valuables, a practiced and long-established pat-down that he can do without thought by now. "So then," he asks at last. "What.. what is going on?"

Silvertongue looks at you, "Oh Windwalker. I'm glad you're here. It seems that Hanna knows that some of the Axom experiments happened in this building." He begins, looking at you. "We need to find out where and when this happened. I'm sure this isn't the company, but it may help us find them."

"Roger dodger," the shaman mutters.

Silvertongue talks with Hanna a bit longer, the wolf on point. He nods to you, "We are done, for now." And allows you to lead him back to the lodge. As you step in, he turns to you, "Oh, and you were asked for by name from one of our.. informants..." He peers, "Popular kid. A Mr. Johnson would like to speak with you." He hands you a piece of paper, with an address and a time, one day from now.
