# Cyber Chicago 2010-03-25

The post trip interrogation is somewhat long, and tedious. With all three of the parties not exactly coherent at the best of times, stumbling through ensuring that Windwalker has at least a Folstein score of 25 takes some time. Eventually, the restraints are removed, and Windwalker is 'freed'. At least from the mundane, physical restraints.

The ward is a familiar site. A High El doctor would go ballistic over the sanitary and lighting conditions present in what is an old pump room, many pipes lining the ceilings, making a convenient hangar for any IV drips or other such things that might be needed. The lighting is low, and flickers, but it is home, to many. This is the 'emergency' ward, where those who are normally high functioning are taken in emergencies. Those who are not so fortunate, or who are in constant parlance with the spirits, are kept at a different locale.

A hazy recollection comes to Windwalker, Wolf said something about a lake, and what can easily be assumed to be airplanes. Windwalker knows enough about the city to mettle out that he was probably talking about millennium park, which would have fit the description many decades ago. It's only a dozen blocks or so west, the opposite way from the warzone he visited last time.

A soy dog dipped in old relish is food enough; actual buns are a luxury for those who live like Windwalker does. He reflects briefly on the money he's made recently, and lets out a quiet sigh of regret. He could eat better. But there's no time for that. Throwing on some clothes and a coat over his tactical suit, and making sure his guns are out of sight, he prowls through the tunnels toward the surface world and emerges as just another worthless hobo. But unlike many of the derelicts he's seen, he has an immediate purpose.

Millennium Park is his destination. Whatever it takes now, whatever he has to do, he'll get there. He'll find the spirit of his contact - Gadhula - and find out Mr. Johnson's secrets. Some things are worth being hungry for.

As Windwalker continues to his destination, the throngs of people start to become thicker. Indeed, the park, one of the few places people below Sky ever get to see natural lighting, is a popular place any time of day or night.

Millennium park is one of the few places where the sky will be visible on street. It is night time when Windwalker makes it there. The shaft of visible light, at one time, was reflected and amplified by polished metal flashing all around the hive levels, but this hasn't been maintained, and many earthquakes, explosions, and just in the course of decay have ruined the effect. Still, even under the gibbons moon there's enough light here to make your way through the park. Even at night time there are many people around, from all walks of life.

Wolf wasn't exactly specific, when he explained where to go, but the answer is obvious. In 2024, the 'Cloudgate' sculpture in the park was cut in half, to create the Olympic torch for the Summer Games that year. And, spirits themselves know how, it has been kept burning all this time. It is one of the largest attractions of the park, and indeed, the crowds are thronged thick around the torch.

The flame burns many of the colors of the rainbow, the center of it's flame, a deep hot blue, the edges of it wisped with green as various pollutants are burned out of the air. As Windwalker shoulders his way to the torch, he can sense a spirit, dancing along the tips of the flames, putting on her best performance for the crowd.

The first thing is to find a phone. Windwalker briefly considers stealing one, but he spots a public payphone with gang bar codes laser-etched on the side. Nodding to himself, he returns to the torch. _This must be it,_ he thinks.

Windwalker thinks a bit more. "Gadhula!" he announces, hopefully loud enough to attract the spirit's attention. "Ifi'naan calls!" If anyone in the crowd thinks his behavior odd, fuck 'em. There's only one thing that matters here.

The spirit stops it's dance, the flame continuing on behind her. You feel the presence move, to the edge of the bowl, nearest you. "Human." She calls out, for your ears only, "How do you know that name for me?" She pauses, and replays the last bit of what you said, "Ifi'naan...." She pauses, "Iffi? Where is he!" S he exclaims, darting left and right, not leaving her bowl, but very excited.

"He is a phone call away," answers Windwalker, jerking a thumb backward at the pay phones. Mindful of the appreciative crowd, he continues. "Maybe when you aren't working?"

Gadhula grows slightly irritated, "I.." She moves, "I'm always working... and..." She is very obviously annoyed, darting back and forth, very anxious. She can't leave her bowl. Or at least, she can't leave without something else to focus on.

"Can you talk from here then?" asks Windwalker. "If so, I'll be right back."

An affirmitive air is felt.

A pair of happy strollers is entering the pavilion, a happy couple with baby strapped to her chest. This is obviously a family occasion for them, even at the night time, but they're taking in the sights enough that they would probably be oblivious to any attempts.

Windwalker spots his marks. He needs a phone, just a regular cell phone, and they'll do. Besides, both are so equipped - they won't need it. So resolved, Windwalker approaches unobtrusively. His command of the physical world, a gift from the spirits he's dealt with before, are enough to finesse one of the phones away without anyone being the wiser.

With his customary caution, Windwalker circles away and loses himself in the crowd - just in case. Once satisfied, he takes time to etch a picture of a cell phone on the stone near the torch - a mark commemorating a victory in the Lodge's war. And with that done he approaches the torch and calls to Gadhula again.

A small child notices Windwalker etching into the ground, but no other notice is taken. As you approach the torch, and call out to the fire spirit in perpetual dance again, she brightens up. "That will be perfect!" She says, the irritation and impulse gone from her voice, she is all smiles as you feel her presence leap from the bowl and into the phone that you just acquired. A short second later, you hear her speak again, "Okay. Now you can take me back to him." She giggles, and has that edge to her voice as one might hear in a love struck 16 year old.

Windwalker remembers Ifi'naan's instructions - just calling the PDA should be sufficient. And so he does.

Gadhula blocks the call as you try and make it. "I've already spoken to him. But we want to see eachother." A certain amount of pleading enters into her sassy, commanding tone.

Windwalker thinks quickly. "Alright, well.. they're going to be looking for this phone," he explains. "Is there some other way I can carry you?"

Gadhula pauses for a moment, "Iffi says I can blank the IDs on this phone, and rogue it on the network. So they shouldn't be able to find it. I'll have it done before we leave the plaza." She says, with more than a little pride.

Windwalker sighs in relief. "Good enough." He pockets the phone, skulking out of the park. Now that his business his done here, he'll find a nice anonymous street corner. From there, Mr. Johnson should be just a phone call away.
