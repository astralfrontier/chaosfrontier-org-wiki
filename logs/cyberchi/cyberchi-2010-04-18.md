# Cyber Chicago 2010-04-18

Indeed Sonia is there in the morning, and the wolfpack continues. Days are a bit harsh as Alpha heals, and he doesn't immediately take Windwalker's hints. Soon, time seems to pass like a blur in the wolfpack. After smoothing over several of the incidents that night, time seems less immediate, less fungable. The winter chill gives way to spring, and one morning, as the blossoms of spring just start to decorate the cold barren trees. Sonia is naturally chosen as the new Alpha, given no challenge from those present. The spring is short, and soon summer is upon us. Hunting is harder and harder, little food can be found. There's hardly a few mouthfulls to go around a night off of what the pack can bring down. Some blame Sonia's leadership, others blame the area.

Time comes back into focus again, less like a slideshow, and more real, more present. One night, hunger comes to a head, as Sonia's perfered mate, Leon is found bullying some of the pack members. "Leave!" he says, "You're a burden. When's the last tine you found game?" The victim, Myrra, cowers in fear, hardly speaking. Lean grows again, "Those who cannot hunt must leave. We cannot spare freeloaders." Sonia is watching, but makes no move to interfere.

"Stop," says Windwalker, crouching forward.

Leon looks over, and growls, "Walker... Not you again. Can't you go be holy somewhere else?" He turns to face you, Myrra ignored for the time being. Leon looks back at Sonia, who hasn't moved, "Though I am listening."

"If you eliminate any hunters less capable than the best hunter in the tribe, soon you'll be left with just one wolf." The shaman does not growl yet. But he's close. "You and Sonia? If you do without all the 'free loaders', how much can you hunt just for yourselves?"

Leon snarls, and is not at all happy. "They should pull their weight. Your belly is as empty as mine, Walker." He spits at the ground. Sonia stands, and approaches, "That's Alpha, Walker. And Leon is right. We can't feed everyone anymore." She starts to part from Leon. Leon looks like he's about to pounce, and attack, baring teeth, head low to the ground. Sonia is less provocative.

"It's an insult you've given before," retorts the shaman-wolf. "Now you bristle at it? How does it feel?"

Sonia looks at you. "Who are you to judge this pack, Walker?" She barks, loudly, "Who made you arbiter of us?" She looks at you, "Perhaps someone else is volunteering to leave, Leon?" Leon is still retaining his tough wolf posture, snarling and growling.

"Who am I to judge this pack? I'm a part of it. And so are you." Windwalker prepares himself for what he thinks is coming. "Leon is part of it. Myrra is part of it. We're all part of it. We're all hungry together, just like you said.. Alpha."

Sonia scowls, "Not for long..." She looks at you, and walks away. "Leon. Enough. It is not the day." She lays back down. Leon look at you for many long seconds, before obeying. Ultimately, he knows who's wolf he is.

"Wait," says Windwalker. He's not done yet.

Sonia turns, and looks, "Yes, Walker?"

Windwalker persists. "We haven't been hungry all the time. The pack is.. the pack. We should move. Find new places to hunt."

Sonia looks. "And give up our homeland? Other packs starve too. In other areas? Besides, where are we to go?" She snarls, and is sarcastic as she speaks. "Maybe we should all jsut follow you, that's what you want, isn't it?"

The shaman pauses. "It's what _you_ wanted, sister. And you got what you wanted." He lets this sink in for a moment. "If I thought you couldn't lead, I'd have challenged you already."

Sonia looks at you, "So, the going gets tough, and I'm just some power hungry bitch, is that it?" She snarls, and takes a bite at you. She doesn't come close enough to hit you, but her next jump will. You can tell it's more her emotions talking then her rational mind.

"I said no such thing. But you heard it, Alpha," persists Windwalker. "You heard it. You fear hearing it, don't you."

Sonia looks you square in the eye, "I fear nothing Walker." Her eyes stay keen on your own, as if judging your intent. "Hard times are hard on everyone, Walker. You should know that, as well as most. We cover more ground in a day then we ever did before." She looks at Leon, then Myrra.

Windwalker shrugs as best a wolf can. "Then don't fear to leave our lands. Don't fear listening to your pack. Be the Alpha we're already following. But lead the pack - the whole pack. All of us."

Sonia nods, "As you say. I will not have anyone say I am too proud to listen to reason." She finally manages to rationalize in her mind. Leon growls, but Sonia hushes him with a glare. "Walker is right. We must go to where the food is, and where the competition is not." Sonia looks at you, "We have a long day tomorrow, everyone, and it won't be fixed overnight. Walker has an excellent idea, and we will all. ALL" Sonia glares at Leon, "be departing early to get a good day in."

"As you say, Alpha." Windwalker inclines his head.

In the morning, the pack starts running on, Sonia leadign the pack, not in hunting patterns, but straight West, the direction of the setting sun...

As you are running, you suddenly become aware of your self again, the self in the present, the self that goes on two legs. The colors of the forest fade out around you, into the white nothing that is your usualy meetingplace. Instead of a pack, only one wolf, that is, Wolf, is beside you. He slows, and brings you to his pace, stopping, he sits before you. "That'll do, Windwalker." He says, finally, "Tell me. What did you learn? What do you think?" The wolf has a smile.

"I learned... I'm sure grateful for supermarkets," Windwalker quips out of a parched mouth. He thinks about it for a moment.

Windwalker turns his over in his mind. "Comfort... is the buffer against our true natures," he concludes finally. "Hunger, desperation, danger.. those things bring out who we are. Strip us of the choice to be something else. Takes away our masks." He reaches up, touching his own face, running a hand through his blue hair. "Masks, like Mr. Johnson. Like Windwalker."

"Johnson may wear a mask, or several, but sometimes an event does not layer on a seperate mask, but instead reveal one we didn't even know we were wearing, yes, Windwalker?" Wolf smiles, "You have done well."

Wolf seems nervous. Not for yourself, but more for himself. "Arranging to have you tested was.." He pauses, "Difficult. But never mind that. You have performed admirably." He inhales largely, then starts in, with that sing-song overtone of someone giving a prepared speech. "In old days those who communicated with the spirits, both like and unlike you, were sometimes chosen to be bonded with one of our number, for the growth of both involved." Wolf looks at you, "Humans may have all but forgotten us, for a time, but new spirits arise all the time. As humans build new places, assign importance to new things, and concepts. Sure, some change and adapt, but others are born, for lack of a better human word, into this world."

"In those times, well-regarded shamans were often gifted into a pact with one of these newer spirits, so that both may learn from each other, and such that the bonds between both worlds may be strengthened through mutual struggle, and common purpose." Wolf clears his throat again, a quite interesting sound from a canine, "As I'm sure you have guessed by now, you, Windwalker, have been chosen first to re-conduct this ritual. A new type of spirit has arisen from the urban jungle, and one of these will be bound to you." Wolf looks at you, "You may refuse. But doing so may have as many consequences as acceptance. Perhaps more." Wolf looks at you. He dare not ask, but he seems to be awaiting a response.

"It would be an honor," breathes Windwalker.

Wolf's relief washes over him so obviously that you can feel some splash upon yourself. "Know this, Windwalker. This is a trail to see if the human world is ready for our kind to enter back into a more active role in the lives of humans. There may... no, there will be many things asked of you in this." He smiles, "But I look forward to talking with you after you meet your companion."

"Yeah, actually...uh.." The shaman pauses. "Why me?"

Wolf looks at you curiously. "Many of this new wave of humans who can talk to us spend too much time with us to be of much use. Obviously it's not much of a test if humans never interact with our candidate." Wolf pauses, then continues, "You have been of much help to seveal spirits in the field in the past, both those who can directly help you, and those you simply come across." Wolf is hiding something else, too.

"I hope I don't need to know whatever you're not saying," remarks Windwalker dryly.

Wolf looks at you. "Part of it, too. Is that you found me. And in my circles, I'm the one who arranged these things in the past. It's my area of expertise, you might say." Wolf looks at you, "But you would have been chosen anyway. One who Walks with Wind."

Windwalker muses on this. "If I know why me, I can help the rest of the Lodge. We... well, we had nothing before. We were trash. You all... the spirits, you gave us all life, a new world. We owe you everything."

Wolf bows his head, and says, "There is no specific trigger. You can help by succeeding in this, Windwalker."

Windwalker bows in return. "I will. I'll make you all proud."

Windwalker awakes from his trip. A quick glance at the clock, and the ability to move his arms and legs, reveals he was out no longer than normal. The dull, poorly lit space of the spirit lodge unfolds monotonously before Windwalker. The only change, he finds, dangling against his chest, on a simple leather strip, is a wooden carving of a wolf paw, crude and gauged, as if made by inexpert fingers.
