# Cyber Chicago 2010-05-16

Dag Nabbit, through his usually rolling cadence of emotes and swearing, manages to describe a map to WinWalker. Dag Nabbit assures WindWalker that he can 'get the boom' there, which you are reasonably sure means weapons. The map is quickly scribbled on a slip of paper.

---

The packet that is provided to Bash has one other slip of paper in it, previously overlooked. A set of instructions for contacting someone named 'Wind Walker'. He would be good backup, it says, and as a bonus he has been to the building before. Apparently you go to a cafe in Street called Portos, and ask for 'Jimmy'... And you are supplied with a date and time to meet there.

Bash checks his watch. Better to follow up the lead while he's out and about. He puts out his cigarette and stuffs the packet into his coat has he gets up. A glance around the pub to make sure no one is looking to follow and he heads out the door to Portos.

Portos is a ways away from The Happy Ending, Bash finds no issue making his way down to street, and to the cafe. The cafe is on a corner, one of the brightest areas in this part of Street. The street outside contains but one garbage can, but it otherwise simply dusty, with little refuse or other notable junk. The door swings freely as Bash enters. There's a counter jockey behind the counter, and a couple of people. No one bothers to look up.

Bash makes his way to the counter. He leans against it, and motions to the person behind it with his cigarette pack before lighting up.

The counter jockey looks you oaver as you light up.. He steps over to the Point of Sale and gunts, "Yeah?"

Bash says, "I'm looking for Jimmy. Is he on tonight?" He looks the man over as he debates ordering a coffee in this place. It seems clean enough, but you never know when you get such grumps serving it up.

The counter jockey looks confused, but a cook, who was overhearing the conversation, yells from the kitchen, "Jimmy isn't on for a few more hours. Sorry boss." The meatier gentleman standing at the POS grunts again, "A few more hours. Anything on you?"

Bash takes a long pull on his cigarette. He's unhappy about the wait. "Coffee, cream and two sugars. This place is really hopping. Is it always this packed?."

Another grumt is all you get for all this banter. A real winner, this one. He produces a cup, and pushes a small plastic container of sugar and creamer over in yoru general direction, "Two bucks." demands the drone.

Bash forks over the cash. Sighing, he goes for broke. "Thanks. Hey, you ever get a guy named Windwalker in here? With such a small customer base, you must know everyone who comes through the door.?"

The counter drone was turning around as your question was asked. He shrugs his meaty shoulders, "Dunno." That seems to be all you'll get out of him.

Bash says, "Great." He turns around to the tables and picks one against the wall, sitting facing the door. He scowls as he reaches in his pocket for a small device. He turns it on and settles in for a long read. Lucky he has a new book on the latest processor architecture to pass the time or he'd lose it.

---

Most of the night is free after Windwalker gets some information from Dag Nabbit. Triton, another of the lodge's more permanent inhabitants, manages to find WindWalker among some of the disused train tunnels. "WindWalker" He looks you over, his face an undisguised mask of awe, "Umm, You've been called up again." He smiles a sheepish, almost ashamed smile, "No rest for a hunter, yes?"

"It's all about the money, honey," says Windwalker quietly, packing away his tools. "Where to?"

"Portos again, sir." Triton stammers out, now shuffling his feet,a nd looking at his white sneakers. Well, they were probably white at one point in time, but now betray the years of use and muck that they have been subjected too.

"Alright. I've got a couple days' stuff with me." The rest of the tools are secured in the knapsack, and Windwalker rises. "Thanks."

Triton smiles, and nods, and runs off. "Thanks, sir."

Windwalker shakes his head, mumbling to himself. ".. the hell is 'sir' about, anyway?"

---

Windwalker makes his way to the cafe. He's only been there a few times himself, but it's closer to home, as it were. He steps in through the door, and it's about as busy as it normally is. A young lady is ordering at the counter, getting much the same treatment as Bash.

The time while Bash has been waiting has not been eventful. Few people are in and out of the cafe. In the ensuing hours, a few people get up to leave. One or two come in, but the order, and shortly leave. Soon, a young lady comes in, followed by...

A man who looks like he ought to be panhandling, and probably has been. He has a shock of sky-blue hair, the drawn-out stare and sunken features of an addict or other dissolute sort, and clothes whose filth and disarray suggest that they've been slept in much but washed rarely. He walks with a sort of cautious slouch, like a feral cat intent on raiding one's garbage can.

Bash is sitting at a table in the back of the cafe, facing the door. He has a well kept shabby appearance. His dirty blonde hair is short enough to not brush his ears. He hasn't shaven in a couple of days. The thin wire-framed round lenses that sit on his nose reflect the glow of the screen he has been reading from for hours. He's draped his long brown coat over the back of his chair. The green sweater he wears has obviously seen better days. Still, even though his sweater has a hole or two in it and the rest of his clothes are very worn, he has a studious air about him. He glances up at the weirdo entering the cafe. Bringing his cup to his lips he prays to a god he does not believe in that this is not the Jimmy he has been waiting for.

Windwalker has a place. He assumes he'll be expected. The bar's the usual place to ask about such things, and so he does.

The cook looks through the glass, and nods to Windwalker. The cook points over to Bash, and nods. No words are spoken.

Bash lowers his head to keep up the appearance of reading, but keeps his eyes on the new guy. He thinks he might actually have had too much coffee if blue-haired beggars are wandering into cafes.

Windwalker fishes up a fiver and leaves it on the bar. Glancing in Bash's direction as well, he points at his chest with one finger and mouths 'me?'

Bash blinks at the man. He glances around to make sure that he is indeed the only person this man is trying to communicate with. He taps his lighter on the table for a moment before answering. "Your name wouldn't happen to be Jimmy, would it?"

The hobo slides out a chair and sits down opposite what he supposes is his contact, or client? Hard to tell now. "Windwalker. But I won't be picky, I'm looking for work. A new name'd be fine."

Bash turns off his reading device and puts it aside. "I see. Mr. Windwalker. My name is Bash. I've got a job, and was pointed in your direction for some help with it. What kind of skills do you bring to the table?" Bash lights yet another cigarette and scowls at the pack. Only a few left. He's been waiting for a while.

"I can do stuff," replies Windwalker carefully. "I've a willingness to try anything. If you want a profession, then, call me a magician."

Bash lets out a bark of laughter. "A magician? Please tell me you can do more than cut people in half and juggle." He takes his glasses of and rubs his eyes. He's losing his patience and hopped up on coffee.

"A lot more, but the trick is told when the trick is sold." Windwalker opens his hands on the table, palms up. "Let's start with what you need."

Bash rubs his eyes again. "Somewhere, a god is having himself a good laugh." He puts his glasses back on and takes another drag off his cigarette. "What I need, Mr. Windwaker, is someone who can reliably keep me from getting killed while I aquire some information from a certain company you may have some experience with. Is that within your vague skill set?"

The man mumbles something to himself. The salt shaker on the other side of the table slides itself in a steady motion from where it rested into his outstretched hand. The other hand remains just where it was. "I can try. With enough preparation, Mr. Bash, all things are possible."

Bash stares at Windwalker until he has finished his cigarette, thinking. "Alright."

Windwalker returns the salt to its position and clasps his hands together. "So. Where's it to be anyway?"

Bash says, "Chicago Aerosol. Sound familiar?"

Bash waves his cup at the server. He asks the magician, "Coffee?"

Windwalker backs up a bit, looking surprised. The look turns into a smile after a moment. "Coffee sounds good. I tell you what. Instead of cash, maybe we can do a deal. My services on your job, your services for mine."

Bash lifts up the cup and two fingers, asking for a second cup. "You're working another job? And you're asking my services without even knowing what they are?" Bash gives a crooked smile.

Another grunt is heard. Unfortunately, Grunt hasn't gone off duty yet. He nods and grabs the steaming pot. He plops down the cup and saucer , and pours a measure of black liquid caffeine into each cup. He turns to leave the table without a word.

"If you can get information and need protection, you're on premises," Windwalker replies, leaning forward. "It so happens that I want information. Maybe even the same information." He pauses for a moment, looking thoughtful. "Who sent you anyway? No names, just describe him."

Bash leans forward, cupping the hot cup between his hands. "He wore a black suit and a red tie. Pale guy. Not very talkative. Probably from High El. Creepily familiar with my career."

"Mother of mercy, is this the end of Rico?" mumbles Windwalker to himself. "Alright. We're going to go out youngsters, but we've got to come back stars."

Bash raises an eyebrow. He just sips his coffee and watches. Guy is definately weird, but probably not dangerous. Not right now, anyway.

Windwalker starts to stand up. "Well? You coming?" he asks.

Bash puts his cup down, startled. "I thought you said you needed time." He stands and pulls out enough cash to cover the bill.

"Yeah but not _here_. Got a car? Got anything?" asks Windwalker.

Bash says, "Cheap lot down the street. Hang a left at the door."

---

The econobox isn't sport, or particularly quick, but it's better than hoofing it everywhere. The pair trade information as they drive.

While Bash has never been into this building in particular, generally divisions within the company are all heavily firewalled apart, or completely detached. It will probably be imperative to at least be on the right general area. The floor above or below, close by. The paperwork puts the datacenter on Orange 5, which is around 20 levels above where the pair pull up too.

Windwalker describes his last job here. They found a little girl in a heavily protected medical lab, and escorted her back to Mr. Johnson. Who is, indeed, the same person as contacted Bash. Windwalker, at that time, faced what would be called 'light resistance' by most operatives.

Bash says, "How did you get in without causing a general panic? Your appearance doesn't exactly make you blend in."

Windwalker shrugs. "The first time we had someone running the cameras and such. The second time, I got in through the ventilation system."

He pulls back his coat and shirt a bit, revealing the thin synthetic materials of a tactical suit beneath the clothes. "Plus this stuff blends better."

Bash nods. "If we time it right, I should be able to hack security on the lower levels. I'll have to hack again once we get closer, but it shouldn't be too bad. It's the last hack that will be interesting." He glances at the body armor. "Yes. Very prudent. And here I usually steal a lab coat and badge to get into these places."

"I may or may not have someone on the inside as well," remarks Windwalker. He fishes about for the cell phone he carries and holds it up to his ear. He doesn't even bother dialing. "Gadhula. You there?" he asks tentatively.

Gadhula answers, "Yes?"

Windwalker clears his throat. "So our meeting with Ifi'naan is going to be a little delayed, but luckily I'm working with someone else employed by the guy who's carrying him around. So, uh, there's someone inside called Hanna. I'll see if I can get in touch with her as well. We want to avoid being spotted, and I hope that you and she can help somehow."

Bash gives Windwalker a look. "May or may not? Do you know someone who works there?" He runs a hand through his hair. "If we hadn't attempted this so quickly I might have been able to get us in as sanitary workers."

Windwalker shakes his head, looking away from the mouthpiece for a moment. "Just someone there, not who works there."

Gadhula answers, "I don't know of Hanna specifically." She sounds a bit snobby as she does so, "She must not be a fire spirit." She pauses, "This technology is great! I can talk to my Iffie all day! Isn't that great?" She sounds a bit giddy at this. Another pause, "Iffie says that he might be able to make cellphones ring, or effects like that, but nothing much more than that."

Windwalker scratches his chin. "Alright, thanks for checking." He turns to Bash. "Hey, what stops you from working outside anyway?"

Bash frowns. "What do you mean? Wireless?"

Windwalker nods.

Bash says, "The implant was too expensive. I'll get an upgrade when I have the spare cash. For now, I have to keep paying the rent and constantly upgrade my tools."

Windwalker turns back to his phone. "Hey, Gadhula. So if you and Ifi'naan can talk, I'm not hearing this thing ring. Can you do that with other things besides phones, like make a machine in there talk to one out here? Or if I can get you inside, can we use this phone to talk to one out here?"

Bash slowly peers at the man talking to strangely named people about making cell phones ring.

Ifi'naan speaks this time through Windwalker's speaker, "Well.. Maybe... " Gadhula makes kissy noises while the spirits think, "I can relay the info to a given phone, but Gadhula or myself will need to be on site. The job would be easier if we were at both ends, but you would need to come get me to facilitate th-" Gadhula picks up, "Iffie had to take a call." She explains.

Windwalker nods slowly. "Alright. Thank you both. Let's see if we can meet up first and prepare for this." He puts the phone away and smiles at Bash. "Alright. So we can do this remotely. We need to get back to speak to your employer, though, or at least it'll be better if we do. In the meantime I can work on getting you a floor plan as well."

Windwalker thinks a moment. "Hey, might be able to manage uniforms too. You said lab coats, right?"

Bash grins. "I think I can handle pulling data. Getting in touch with Mr. Johnson is going to be a problem, though. All I have are instructions for the drop off."

Windwalker makes a face. He pulls the phone back out. "Gadhula, can Ifi'naan do more than just take calls? Like can he look at a calendar or something on his phone? I want to know where Johnson's going to be."

Bash nods. "Research and development are mostly scientists and engineers. They wear lab coats and have to have badges at all times."

"Yes. He can also tell you where he is right now. Right now he is quickly moving up a ramp between Low El and High El. He has a meeting scheduled in about an hour at La Fremona." Gadhula explains.

"If I send another phone, can he hop to it?" asks Windwalker.

Bash says, "Lab coats won't be much good up close, but no one will blink if they see us walking down a hall in them from a distance. Sure blend in better than in plain armor."

"Probably." Gadhula says, after a long pause.

Windwalker nods distractedly. "Alright. I'm sending someone now." He hangs up again and smiles. "Alright. Bash, can you go to this La Fremona place? Get there an hour from now, just sort of mill about and look for your guy? You don't have to talk to him, just be near him, about uh.. I don't know, five meters? I'll know if you do it. I'm getting out here." He reaches for the door handle. "I'll come up with whatever badges and whatever I can, okay?"

Bash pulls over and stops the car. "I can get there. Any reason you want me to mingle? You also haven't told me what it is that you're looking for."

Windwalker thinks a moment, shrugs. "You'll be picking up a friend of mine, though you won't see him. Don't worry about it." He looks out the window. "You haven't told me either. That's okay. I think I know what we're both trying to find. I'm afraid it's more people like me." With that he opens the door and slides out.
