# Cyber Chicago 2010-07-25

The day and time of the run is upon you. Between the transfer that Bash made, and the various items liberated by Windwalker, the plan is in place.

The entrance closest to the lab where the data lives is in High-El. Bash picks up Windwalker, and they drive up, parking a respectable, but discreet distance away. The pair has a map to the building. The badges should get you into the building. Your disguise will help. The room the data is contained in is a sealed research lab with it's own network. The plan is to sneak Windwalker into the lab somehow, with Bash hacking through Windwalker's connections to liberate the requested data.

Bash gabs his computer bag, adjusts his glasses, and peers more closely at his badge. "Who were these guys?"

"The badges? Dunno. Just grabbed em," Windwalker answers.

The reception area on this entrance is open and airy. A large, friendly public face; at least to the right public. The ceiling is high, at least three stories above, and use the DeLanguie techniqute to similate a skylight. Such touches are those of a company willing to go the extra mile to impress. The angles, and tempurature of the lights need to be calculates just so to give the desired effect. There are even a couple of what look to be live ferns stanging guard over a foreboding door with a key fab panel next to it, discreetly decked out in a plastic carving. The other walls are done in blue and green, large stripes wrap along the walls.

A stylish, modernly styled desk sits to one side, housing a secretary. She looks up upon enterance. There is also a man in a suit, wearing sunglasses, standing next to the door. Common sense places him as security.

Bash scowls as he pushes the door open. He flashes his badge at the security guy. He turns around to make sure his partner follows closely. "Hurry up, will you. The sooner we start, the sooner we leave."

There is also another large door to the right. It's lavish, and looks to be real wood (though inspection close enough to tell would be at least rude.) The public face of the company, the maps show that this is where prospective deals are made. 100% disconnected from the rest of the building.

Windwalker nods. "You're the boss, boss," he murmurs.

Bash walks briskly toward the employye entrance. He fumbles with his badge for a moment, then swipes it under the scanner.

The fob sounds with a beep as it feels the presence of the wifi cards. Bash could go on about the various public and private key exchanges that go on over the low powered radio waves that emit, the no power circuit transmitting the key specifically traced into the badge. Additionally, you know the badges appear on at least some sort of security log. All such is common sense. The door automatically opens as it scans.

As you enter the employee section, after a right turn he walls get significantly more sparse, painted a dull, cool white. Security is light where you have come in, and you don't see any obvious guards as you make your way up. The lab is several levels up, and further into the heart of the building. The walk takes about ten minutes, making your way as normal folk would. As you enter the 19th story, where the lab lives, you note security is stepped up, the elevator, also activated with your fob, opens, and a security camera greets you down the far end of the single hall that is presented before you. The lab is down the hall, and to the right. You see another almost clone of the security guard at the elevator, but no pays you no mind yet.

Bash keeps an eye out for venilation ducks and rest rooms.

Windwalker says nothing, instead composing his features and gait into an approximation of casualness. Nothing blends in like something that already belongs; the trick is to never be a stranger to a place you're sneaking into.

You know from the map that there's a restroom to the left. You walk does the single hall, the security guard simply watching.. To the left, at the end of a hall about 50 feet or so is your target, a large, metal lab style door. There are several signs warning on the door. Nearby there is a conference room, that looks to be empty now. The bathroom, if interested, would be on your left.

Bash goes toward the bathroom.

Windwalker glances about, shrugs, and follows.

Bash checks to see if anyone is inside before turning to WW.

The bathroom is pretty typical faire, possessed of the luxuries generally afforded ablution patrons in this era. Notably, they have the new vacuum air toilets, which move and clean waist without the senseless use of water.

Noone is here.

Bash says, "How do your phone things work? You mentioned that we could hack from a remote location. How close do we have to be to the ternimal, and which level terminal do we have to connect the phone to?"

Windwalker thinks. "We have to plug the phone in somewhere inside the secure area," he explains from his partial comprehension of the spirits' explanation. "The advantage is that if they find _it_, they haven't found _us_, nor anything to trace to us. You can work from anywhere as long as it's not discovered. But we have to get it in there first."'

Bash says, "So I might be able to use that conference room while the connection is good inside the secure area?"

Windwalker nods. "Certainly."

Bash says, "Alright. I'll leave my deck here with the guard. We'll find a terminal, plug in your phone-modem-thing, then come back and work from the conference room. If that suddenly gets used, I can come back in here and moan through a fake stomach bug while I hack."

Windwalker bobs his head.

Bash says, "Unless you want to go in there by yourself and connect the phone. Your call."

Bash puts his hand on his pack of cigarettes and scowls. Can't smoke inside.

Windwalker hmms. "Nah, we'll both go."

Bash says, "Let's go, then."

Bash walks out heads toward the guard. "Hey buddy, there's a work order I forgot to sign inside. I don't really want to hassle anyone with my computer just to sign a paper. Could I leave it here with you for a few minutes? I've got a conference call," he points to the room, "coming up shortly and can't miss it."

The guard grunts a sort of non commital grunt. Not his job to watch equipment... But he won't really do anything either. THat's probably the best you'll get.

Bash pus his bag down next to the guard's desk, gives the man as much of a smile as he can muster, and walks on toward the imposing door. He reads the warning signs quickly as he approaches. Bash looks for a scanning machine.

The warning signs are various takes on 'If you violate the sanctity of this door, the company is no longer responsible for the stewardship of your body, as long or as short as your soul may inhabit it'. Typical stuff really. There is both a retinal and a hand scanner on the door. The hinges are unexposed, but the door obviously closes out.

Windwalker blinks. He nudges at Bash's arm and leans in to whisper. "Something's come up."

Bash stops short. He's getting tired of scowling, but can't seem to stop. Unexpected security makes him uneasy. He whispers back, "Yes. I see that. Any suggestions?"

Windwalker frowns. "Alright, plan B," he mutters, taking Bash by the elbow and dragging him away.

Bash loudly whispers, "You could have said something sooner. I nearly made an ass of myself." as he gets dragged down the hallway.

"I didn't know sooner," hisses Windwalker. "There's trouble going on inside. We need to find an air duct."

Windwalker thinks back. "Oh yeah, the bathroom." He pauses. "Alright. Go to the conference room. Wait there. I'll call you."

Bash nods, and grabs his computer from the guard's desk. "Seems my coworker already signed the order." He walks into the conference room, then closes and locks the door behind him. After glancing around the room briefly, Bash pulls out his computer and sets it up so that he will have a good view of the door.

Inside the bathroom, the shaman carefully inspects the ceiling vent, thinking about his route. _Good enough,_ he thinks to himself, then quietly incants the spell that transforms him into a roiling cloud of mist. So altered, he ascends and makes his way into the ventilation system as he has before.

It's fairly easy to control your passage through the ventilation system. You judge that you are just about over where the threshold into the lab would be. The spirit from before warns Windwalker again as before 'Don't come. Dirk is waiting for you.' Dirk... There's a vague name from the past. You know you should know who this is.

_Dirk?_ thinks Windwalker. _Who the fuck is Dirk?_ He pauses more. And then he continues. _I just need to open the door. Sounds like a porn star's name anyway._

You are otherwise uninhibited from entering the lab. An air vent blows down into the lab. For now, you can manage to hover around the vent. A figure sits in a chair, watching the door. You know this as Dirk. Dirk was one of the original Axon users, from the lab. He would work with the scientists from the lab. He always seemed on top of his game, even when you were dazed out.

You let yourself be taken down into the room, blown down to the floor.

"What is that my pet?" Dirk asks of Spirit A.. "He's already here? I presume that's one of you from the nasty cabal." He says this last as it to spit it out.. He makes no other moves or attacks. "Windwalker. Oh what fancy names we give ourselves."

The shaman's guns are out as soon as he's regained human form; his feet lightly touch down on the floor of the secure room. Both weapons are trained on the other. "I'm just here for some data," he says flatly. "Then I leave."

"Oh yes. Your little fetch quest." He smiles, pointedly ignoring the pointed weapons. He waves a black square around, "Here is what I asked Johnson to get for you." Drik smiles, "To bring you here. To my palace." He stretches his arms out, "Where is our friend, Mr. Culver?" She smiles, and tilts his head. "Ah."

Bash is sitting alone in the conference room, idly staring at his computer. Whiling away the time generally unobtrusively surveying the building's security. You see movement outside the door. It looks human.

Bash pulls out his phone and starts talking loudly into it, even though no one is actually on the other end. "Smith, I am telling you that this new tech is going to blow your socks off. When you see what Wesson has done with that robotics chip you gave us you're going to be kneeling at his feet!"

The guard walks into the office, and looks at you. "Hey!" He shouts, his hand hovering near his side, but still walking in your direction.

Bash says, "Hang on, someone just barged into the conference room." He looks pointedly at the guard, very obviously annoyed. "Yes? Is there an emergency? I'm on a very important call."

The guard makes his way around the one desk, "Cut the crap, you're wanted in the lab." He says ina gruff, overbaring tone. If you don't do anything he'll be on you in the next few seconds.

Bash narrows his eyes. "You're very rude. I'm going to complain about that." Bringing the phone back up, he says "Look Smith, I'm going to have to call you back." He hangs up. "Fine. But I'm bringing my laptop." He reaches for his deck and bag.

You see the guard begin reaching for your arm as you move it to grab at your deck. His muscles tense, even under his suit, and his hand shoots out, attempting to grab you around the wrist.

Bash grits his teeth. "If you don't want me to break that hand then I suggest you give me a moment to collect my equipment and follow you, like a civilized person, where ever it is you have been ordered to lead me."

The guard looks at you, and some moment of doubt passes between his eyes as his grip lightens up just a bit. "Hurry up. You have fifteen seconds. No keys." He says, his hand moving inside of his jacket in a normal tough-guy move.

Bash shoves everything into his computer case, and shoulders it. "Let's go."

A nod is pushed your way.. He insists on having his hand on your arm, but he guides you not lightly out of the room, and to the metal lab door. It opens as he approaches, and he guides you in. Inside you see Windwalker and a gentleman sitting in his chair.

The gentleman speaks. "Ah. We are gathered, I see..." He says.
