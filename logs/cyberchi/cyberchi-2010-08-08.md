# Cyber Chicago 2010-08-08

The lab is large, containing six research stations, each easily 20 by 30 feet. They are arranged three across and two deep. Windwalker and Bash are stationed in front of the middle one, facing to the back. Windwalker stands slightly ahead of Bash, who in turn is flanked by the guard. Windwalker has his gun drawn, and sighted on Dirk. The guard has his hand inside of his coat, and will have his weapon drawn soon.

The tension in the air could be cut with a knife. Before you, seated, is Dirk, smiling in what he hopes is an ironic fashion. He is in a typical office chair as he sits in the station of the lap, right in front of the reinforced door. Dirk has just said, "Ah. We are gathered, I see..."

"Hold it," barks Windwalker, looking at the guard, pushing his own gun forward half an inch in the air by way of demonstration.

The guard backs away, but doesn't take his hand out of his coat just yet. His eyes are on Dirk. Dirk barks, "I don't think he'll shoot me." In an air of smug confidence.

"You get paid enough to risk that?" Windwalker replies, still directing his question to the security man.

Bash turns to the right to keep everyone in his sight and not have the guard to his back. He eyes the guard and slowly reaches for his gun.

The guard shrugs, and continues to pull his gun out, you see the stock of his piece leave the breast of his coat.

Windwalker wasn't bluffing. He pulls the trigger, sending Dirk's blood all over the console, and has already started to tense himself to avoid the guard's own counterattack.

Bash steps back and draws his gun while he watches the guard.

As Bash moves away, Windwalker quickly swings his other hand about and opens fire at the security guard, dealing an equally serious injury.

Dirk falls of the chair, and lays prone on the ground, the chair and counter splattered with his blood. The guard finishes drawing his weapon, and trains it on Windwalker.

Bash fires his gun at the cranky guard and...misses!

Windwalker brings both guns into alignment and blazes away, regretting that the man with the gun out isn't the person he ought to be dealing with. The security man is out of commission for now, though, and Windwalker begins to turn, assessing Dirk's position.

The guard's lifeless body hit the floor with a dull biological thump. Dirk scampers behind the counter, traling blood, managing to hide his upper body from view.

Bash aims at the portion of Dirk's body that is exposed.

Windwalker walks to the counter, and looks over, seeing Dirk waving his hand in the air, from his prone position. You notice his wounds start to leak harder.

Bash says, "Are we killing this one, too?" Bash doesn't seem to keen to fire unless Dirk makes a move or WW says something.

Windwalker shakes his head. "Hold it," he replies, approaching warily, guns trained.

Dirk is laying on the ground, muttering urgently, his eyes closed, hands waving above his head, almost hitting the cabinets.

Windwalker changes his mind. "Shoot him!" he yells. Urgently.

Bash jumps a bit at the shouting. His shot goes way off target. "Damn!"

Viciously, Windwalker unloads both pistols into Dirk. "Abomination," he spits out, as the sound of his weapons fades away.

Bash walks over to the terminal and sits down in the chair. He places his gun down next to the keyboard. "Hold up. I might have something. Cover the door or something."

Windwalker has been looking around for the black square that Dirk held, but he nods, keeping his guns trained.

"The phones," hisses Windwalker. "Wire one in behind a console or something."

Bash looks up from the screen. "Can those things store files?"

Windwalker shrugs. "I guess."

Bash pulls out the phone from his bag and looks for compatible ports on the console. He has a few connection cords in the bag for connecting external devices.

While Bash works, Windwalker makes a quick check of himself and Bash. Bloodstains on clothes, bloody shoe-prints, or any other telltale signs of violence. They still need to leave, after all.

Bash runs a cord between the console and the phone. He immediately transfers the file for the data he was sent for. "Walker, what were you here to get? Is it data? I'm looking at a directory listing now."

Bash will probably need to clean his shoes off. Your white coats are showing off splatters nicely, but other than that you guys are mostly clean.

Windwalker steps over and peers at the directory listing. "Test subjects," he says after a moment. "Any research on humans. Anything with the keyword 'axon'."

Looking through the communication, Bash finds a list of names, some of which Windwalker will recognize, and emails between Dirk and someone who goes by Gregory only about the list, and Dirk's role.

And, among the emails, there are a few to a Mr. Johnson. With Bash & Windwalkers' names on it.

"I want copies for later," Windwalker mutters. "There's people who need to see this."

Bash copies over the pertenant email, then, along with anything mentioning Johnson, Bash, or Windwalker.

Bash looks for anything on storage locations for new tech or goods once the transfers complete.

There's a black box attached to the terminal that was mentioned earlier.

Windwalker lays hands on that as soon as possible.

Bash says, "What is that thing?"

"Something that abomination said we were looking for," replies Windwalker, holding it up. "We can plug into this thing somewhere safe, right?"

Bash leans over and grabs it to look for ports. "Yes. Standard port." He hands it back and returns to his search.

Satisfied, Windwalker strips off his bloodied lab coat and uses it as a pair of improvised gloves to sift through the guard's belongings, then Dirk's. "Your shoes," he remarks absently.

Bash kicks his shoes off, and hooks his socked feet over the bar under the chair so they don't touch any drips on the floor.

Bash says, "Ok. A few more second of search and we should get the hell out of here. We want to leave before the security system is engaged. I should hack an override to give us time to get out... Oh! Security footage! Where is that on this thing? Did he have access to the security monitors? Are there any in this room?"

Windwalker shrugs helplessly.

It is the work of a few seconds to loop into the security cameras, and look at what they saw. They seem to have been operational at the time of the attack, but they don't show anyone in the lab.

Bash says, "Clean my shoes."

Windwalker blinks. "'s long as it's not with my tongue," he mutters, grabbing the shoes and looking around for a sink.

Bash fingers fly over the keyboard once he spots something interesting. His glasses gleam from the light of the monitor. He brings up a seperate subroutine from the data he was looking for. The machine beeps at him helpfully when he reaches the last line.

Bash says, "Walker! Clean fast! Thirty seconds! Where are the bodies?!" He starts unhooking the phone and tosses it and the cord back into his bag.

"Too late," Windwalker answers, making sure what he came for has been safely pocketed.

Bash pulls the strap of his bag on and grabs his gun. "What do you mean, 'too late'?"

"Thirty seconds isn't enough time," Windwalker answers. "Get outta here."

The shaman remembers the spiritual presence from earlier, calling out silently to it now. "Unless you were Dirk's ally, please come with me now."

Bash runs toward the door he came in. "Whatever, man."

The boys make it out of the building with little difficulty, nodding to the disinterested secretary as they make it back out onto the street.

---

Once outside and holed up in a safer place, Windwalker lets out a sigh. "I need those phones and the data on 'em," he explains, and holds up the black square. "The abomination said this is what brought you here as well. But I need all this."

Bash says, "Fine. I need it too, so we both get a copy. Any problems with that?"

Windwalker smiles grimly. "Dirk had no business knowing some of this. He got shot for it, and he won't be the last. You helped me get this. Just don't get _too_ curious if you read something interesting."

Bash frowns. "That's broad. There could be data in here I can trade. What exactly is it that is supposed to be hands off?"

Bash pulls out his deck and hooks up the phone to start the data transfer.

Windwalker snorts. "You're asking me 'give me any information I should not know about'. Best thing to do is to go through it together."

Bash says, "I'm asking you for a subject line to avoid, not the encyclopedia edition."

"That's hard," Windwalker answers after a moment. "Y'see, I don't _know_ exactly what they were doing. Anything mentioning 'axon' is out. Beyond that, let's have a look and I can try to answer your question as we go."

Bash sighs and mutters "bloody hell". He shifts the screen a bit so they can both look at it. He brings up the file list. "I hope you don't read slow."

Windwalker stares at the screen.

There's three major threads of emails. One concerning a list of people, some of which Windwalker will recognize the names. Little is specified as to what waswith tehm, but somoene named 'Gregory' is looking for them, And Dirk was supposed to find them. Windwalker's name is on the list.

The second concerns the data that you were asked to grab. Mr. Johnson arraned for it to me Windwalker and Bash who came to get it.

Thirdly, the cube holds a huge mass of encrypted data. At least, that's what it looks like initially.

"You were used," Windwalker concludes. "Dirk was waiting for me. Me, specifically."

Bash says, "Who is this Dirk guy? Why were you calling him an aberation?"

Windwalker thinks for a moment, cracking his knuckles as he does. "He's a traitor to the people I represent," he says. "He received.. training.. that he misused. He was a danger."

Bash says, "The people you represent? Training? Do you realize how much you sound like one of the bad guys from 'Ninja Assassin', only dressed like someone who lives out of a cardboard box?"

Windwalker laughs. "Yeah, training. Like how I was already inside the security room when you got there." He stares at the screen some more. "There was a girl there, the first time I went in. Johnson took her away. Now I think I know where. This 'Gregory'."

Bash has decided that this has been one of the crappier runs he's been on so far. People shooting, two guys dead, magician hobo with mad gun skills that talks about things in a very vague way, being set up... Not a great night. "I forgot about that. You must shimmy through vents pretty quickly."

Bash says, "So, what is up with this encrypted black box?"

Windwalker looks up and shrugs. "About that. You've got another job offer. I need that encrypted data broken. I'll talk price with my people."

Bash says, "Alright. I'll take a sample to a contact of mine to see how complicated the job will be."

Windwalker nods. "I guess I'll go rob a bank or something," he announces. "This will probably take some cash."

Bash really has no idea if WW is joking or not, so he just hands the hobo magician the phone.

Windwalker takes the phone back. "Attica, Attica," he mutters.
