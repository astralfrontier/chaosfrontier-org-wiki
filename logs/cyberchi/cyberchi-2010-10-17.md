# Cyber Chicago 2010-10-17

A tense moment, the trio have found a hovel to hide in, evading the pursuit that was just on their tail. Bash pulls the curtain back to reveal... an empty alley way. No eyes can be detected on the crew and they file out of the alley.

Windwalker glances at Bash and Damien, shrugging a bit. They're the computer experts. For now he's just along for the ride.

Bash looks at Damien. "Do you have the equipment you'll need to decode what I have?

Damien has looked a little shell shocked throughout all of this.. He blinks, and looks at Bash, waiting a few agonizing seconds before realizing that he was, indeed, asked a question. He starts to speak, starting slowly, then gaining speed as he does so. "Yess.. well, I have my deck, and you have the cube, and I might need some storage, and power, and a hardjack would be nice and..." He looks between the two, and meekly trails off.

Bash nods. "I can get that. We just need a safe place to put you. Walker, do you know of any places? You seem like someone who might need to hide out once in a while."

Windwalker thinks a moment. "Give me an hour, I'll find a spot," he promises.

Bash grimaces. "Ok, kid. Let's get your supplies."

The crew manages to get out onto the street, and back to Bash's car without incident. Plans are made, and the party splits off again, both back to their homes, in opposite directions.

---

Bash takes Damien to a location he's gotten supplies from before. The office was recently remodeled. All of the old equipment was tossed into the alley as garbage. A lot of it was too old to bother with, but there were good cables and power strips hiding in the junk pile. "Whatever Walker finds probably won't be much to look at. We'll have to run power to everything directly from a wall socket. Let's grab a few of the strips and whatever connecting cables you think you'll need. I've got storage and tools that we'll pick up later. Anything else you need, we'll see if it's around here first."

Damien shakes his head, just nodding as you pick up the stuff you need.

Bash and Damien head out to Bash's neighborhood, and hide away at the back of a busy cafe until the call comes from Walker.

The call comes in, along with a street address and a badly taken photograph from Windwalker's camera. It seems he's no good at managing technology yet, but at least the picture got sent. It's a set of stairs leading down to a heavy-set metal door from 20 years ago, one that leads to a series of connected concrete tunnels below street level.

The tunnel system connects (badly) with an abortive attempt at evacuated subway tunnels and the sewer system, back at the time that ill-conceived urban renewal projects hatched by desperate city planners marked the last gasp before popular political governance fell into the abyss and fiscally prudent corporate control stepped in. The tunnels are the last signs of a lost age when men still thought they could govern themselves fairly, a relic of a war fought entirely on paper.

Windwalker is waiting. He's armed, and alert, but recognizes Bash and Damien as they arrive. "This way. We're tapped into electricity and communications for at least 30 days before anyone will think to notice. Needs a lot of work, though. This way, McGrath!"

The site Windwalker's found is a control room of some kind. The paint on the walls still shows the characteristic outlines where heavy machinery once rested heavily, and high-voltage outlets attest to the character of the machinery. Elsewhere the wall's been torn apart or drilled through, revealing a spider's nest of wiring. But the lights are on, and there's the characteristic hum of electricity. A transformer must be nearby. The door into this booth has a bolt lock, and there's four chairs and a fold-out table set up here.

Bash mutters under his breath that he hopes he brought enough electrical tape and sodder for this disaster, but follows Walker down the tunnel.

Damien beams, actually, looking around himself, "Wow.. it's just like in the 3ds." He smirks, bouncing on the balls of his feet as he's more or less herded into position by Bash. He takes up a chair in the room, and starts unpacking.

Bash sets his bag on the table, and pulls out his tool kit. He walks over to the outlets. A few minutes of fiddling later, he gives a satisfied grunt. "This will do. Good choice, Walker."

Windwalker draws his guns and removes the magazines, nodding solemnly. "I'll see to food in a bit," he mumbles as he starts cleaning the pieces.

Bash says, "How are we going to do this? All of us live in a small room for days, or take shifts guarding the place?"

Windwalker frowns. "I need to keep workin'. I'll ask some guys I know to keep an eye out. We'll take shifts. Okay?"

Bash smiles. "Good. I'd prefer that."

---

While Damien gets going, and after Bash has certified the electronic and electrical access he needs, Windwalker speaks up. "'Gregory'. And any other leads we can get our hands on."

Bash blinks. He peers at Walker. "Do you have any context for that?"

Windwalker shrugs. "We saw messages from Gregory to dear departed Dirk, right? Who is this Gregory guy? We gotta know."

Bash says, "Hmm. I'll see if there's anything in the header that I can use to trace him."

Bash pulls out his deck to get to work.

Windwalker squints. "Ah gots ta _know_," he mutters to himself.

Bash leans back from the glow of the screen with a frown. He reaches for a cigarette and lights it before speaking. "Well, these were sent on the same network that Dirk was on. So Gregory must have access. I'd bet he works in the same building."

Windwalker grumbles. "I ain't breakin' in again. What else can we get?"

Bash says, "Hmm. Nothing else from this. There might be something mentioned in the emails that will give a clue.""

Windwalker nods and gestures at the deck. He clearly seems interested in this.

Bash pulls up the body of the message and starts scanning for anything interesting.

Bash cracks his neck. "I figured that Gregory was a psudonym. Boring. The man has no imagination to use something that droll. He's higher up than Dirk was. At least his boss, if not higher. There's something about a drug. Hey. You never mentioned this was related to pharma."

"Yeah. They're.. uh, they're doing drug testing on human subjects," mutters Windwalker.

Bash frowns. "I need coffee."

Bash says, "There's no trace of him on the net. This guy is probably a big player who has his cronies do everything."

"Like Mr. Johnson?" asks Windwalker wryly.

Bash shrugs. "Maybe. That guy was certainly well connected, and didn't seem to hurt for funding.

Windwalker thinks a moment. "Shit. I missed it," he says finally. "That girl we hauled out. Chicago Aerosol, this building. Dirk, also working in this building. Dirk working with Mr. Johnson. But we went in armed..." He shakes his head finally. "What the fuck?"

Windwalker grinds his teeth together. "Why extract someone from your own facility?"

Bash gives the man a confused look. "What are you blabbing about?"

Windwalker cracks his knuckles, an angry look on his face. He looks Bash straight in the eye. "Alright. A girl, in the basement of that building we were in. We got a job from Mr. J to extract her. Didn't get a name, just a description. No idea what happened to her. But, I'm convinced she was one of the test subjects for the drug. With me so far?"

Damien just now looks up, "Coffee?" He asks.. then the moment is lost, and he's back to his task. THe kid is a machine.

Bash gives Damien an amused look, and pats him on the shoulder. "Soon."

Bash turn back to Walker. "What kind of drug are we talking about? Why would Mr. Johnson want her out of the building?"

Bash gets a horrified look. "It's not chemical weapons testing, is it?"

Windwalker continues, ignoring the questions about the drug. "Why he wants her out, who knows. But that's just it. He's working with Dirk. Dirk, the guy sitting pretty in a heavily fortified laboratory. Dirk, who gets emails from high-ranking guys. So, _why did they need my team_? Why not just have her moved by their own guys?"

Bash leans back until the chair creaks. "There must be multiple factions at the company. That's pretty common. I've seen it myself."

Bash says, "There's a _lot_ of money in new tech. Especially R & D. Development can usually go in more than one direction, and people fight over that to the point of bloodshed."

"There's... there's no way they can monetize this," Windwalker mutters, holding his hands up to his face and rubbing his eyes. "A lot of people might die before they realize that, though. I have to stop that."

Bash says, "You still haven't told me anything about it, other than bad men are making some kind of bad drug."

Windwalker drops his hands to his sides, staring at Bash. "Know why I shot Dirk? Why I'm after Mr. J? Because they know the answer to the question you're asking. You don't need to ask and you won't like the answer if you got it. Just... just be grateful you aren't already on someone's list."

Bash laughs. "That man knows enough about me that I don't need to be on a list."

Bash says, "Anyways. I need coffee. You said something about more supplies?"

Windwalker nods. "There's a toilet down the way, still works. One advantage of camping in a sewer. I'll get some cots and sleeping bags, a water purifier, few other things."

Bash entertains himself with his net connection. "Might want to get on that."

Bash turns and stares intently at Walker. "Don't forget coffee. I'm talking coffee maker and at least two pounds ground. And cups."

"Manufacturing drugs, huh?" mumbles Windwalker. But he nods as he heads out of the control room.

As Bash is out on a smoke break after his shift, Windwalker safely watching over Damien in his progress, Bash gets an odd message on his phone. One of the systems in his apartment has gone off. The intrusion alarm.

Bash sighs. He knew someone would track him down eventually. Bash walks back in and tells Walker about the alarm. "I kind of liked that place, too."

"Welcome to someone's list," Windwalker mutters.
