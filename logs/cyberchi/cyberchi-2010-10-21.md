Upon returning to the Lodge, Windwalker finds that the elders have requested to see him.. He is ushered into the ender's chamber room. This isn't the first time Windwalker has received such an honor, but the site is rare, in any case. This room, more so than the other converted spaces of the Lodge, has been carefully kitted out to resemble the spirit lodges of old. Dreamcatchers, with steel cable wound around cogwheels, little nuts in the middle as gems, hang from the ceiling. The seats and tables are more earthy, cobbled together from scraps of steal, and one even is lined with some fur. The lighting is always kept pretty low, the overhead lights giving off just enough light to define the outlines of shapes in the darkness.

One of the elders speaks, "We have learned you have discovered more, Windwalker..."

Windwalker sits and rubs his hands together. "It concerns Chicago Aerosol, and a mage named Dirk, who's been working with one of my corporate shadow contacts..." Slowly, painfully, he relates the tale. He's not used to talking at length, but the story eventually comes out.

The elders sit, and listen, prompting when required. There is a silence as Windwalker's story is done. Then, the one named Slivertongue speaks. "The place you have described is familiar to us. As you know, from finding Hanna again." He pauses, on the pleasant memory. "The actions of this Dirk were known to us previously, relayed by Hanna and others to our council. You have done well in displacing this abomination." He pauses, "We believe more research must be done at this place. They may have secrets we need. But caution too, as they will seek us out now, as they were using this Dirk to do." Again, a pause while he thinks, "Meditation is suggested, Windwalker. Dirk's departure has cause the spirits much joy, and you may find more gifts bestowed upon you to help in our inquiries." Silvertongue sits back, and looks at Windwalker

Windwalker nods. "The black box will be opened soon, thanks to the computer experts I mentioned - Bash and Damien. Then we may learn more. When that happens, I'll present my findings." He pauses. "If either of them learn too much, I'll terminate them. Still, they should be useful for now."

Silvertongue's brow furrows at the plain speech. "As such must be our ways, for now." He says. "Hope was one found in a box, after everything else was released. May the spirits guide us to find new hope..."

As Windwalker lies drooling and muttering on the secured gurney inside the Lodge, he finds himself floating back from the cascade of fantastic imagery that normally accompanies his use of Axon-5. There is a spiritual presence near, and he greets it silently with all the aplomb his addled mind can muster.

"The Lords of the Crystal Tower bid you greeting," the spirit states with a formality the shaman finds strange. "And one brings a message for you."

Windwalker shudders from the sudden sensation of a chill. He shouldn't be cold; his memory of a brief glimpse of the creatures so named is enough to cause it. The amorphous forms which clung to the sides of Chicago's skyscrapers and super-skyscrapers, the creatures he's glimpsed only briefly in his life during one topside excursion as they lurked at the very upper limit of the metropolis, are not spoken with. The Lodge has little knowledge of them and much wariness.

"The message is this."

"The cosmos is homogeneous at its extremes. Galactic super-clusters are faint clouds of fusion happening in a sea of black. The atoms which compose the cosmos are two particles circled by a third. Visible diversity happens only at the center. The mind is the same way."

"At the largest scale of collective thought, civilization ebbs and flows in predictable patterns and has for thousands of years. And in the depths of your unconscious, revenge and love and anger and fear and the other primal constituents of psyche are the same as those in any other mind."

"This one you seek to know, so alien to you and your ways, is built of that which already resides in you. He is known to us, but we wish to study him. We thus charge you with a task. Enter your own mind. Find this Dirk within yourself. Bring his shade to us for questioning. We will reward you for this service."

Windwalker blinks a bit. "I accept," he gurgles. The foreign spirit's presence fades even as he speaks.

Wolf's guidance comes to the shaman after an hour of meditation, the tool with which he has petitioned for help the spirits in the past. "I will show you the way. You will walk it alone. It is, after all, your mind," it whispers.

Accepting the sensations his patron offers, Windwalker feels himself sliding into a deeper sleep.

---

The young shaman wakes up. The remnants of that ephemeral vision called "life" are already fading; he can barely remember talking to Wolf, much less what brought him here.

He looks around. He feels unaccountably tired, and stretches his limbs a bit to ease out the sense of discomfort. Has he been walking? It feels like it. Regardless, he's at the house that he wanted to reach. The house with a single tree beside it, off to the left, out in the countryside. He doesn't even need to think about it; he knows, without a doubt, that this is where he meant to come.

The door is unlocked. The brass knob twists easily. The lights are off inside the house, but there's the gentle blare of a television in the living room. Windwalker steps into the narrow hall, turns left, finds the living room. There's an upholstered chair and a couch, both facing an ancient analog television. It's showing some sort of news reel.

Sitting on the couch is a man dressed all in black. He looks to be about Windwalker's own height and build, with black hair rather than the shaman's sky-touched blue. He's wearing a bandanna or cloth of some kind over his entire face. Two columns of strange characters, like Chinese characters or Nordic runes, are sewn into it, framing the blankness of his face. He wears black gloves.

He introduces himself by name, and Windwalker nods with distant politeness. "Have a seat," he says, gesturing at the seat. "The movie's about to start."

This is good. Movies are good. Windwalker sits down.

The television picture starts to change. The news story about some sort of laboratory accident shifts, replacing itself with a new picture: a view of skyscrapers as seen from above. Not the modern Chicago skyline, no. These are the gloriously gaudy constructs of the ancient 1970's.

"The city of the future!" announces the narration, in that unnecessarily optimistic way that old television always did. "Where all your dreams come true! Home is for the happiness. Find your root today!"

The man in black leans forward. "It's really exciting. You should try what they offer," he says. "You'll find me inside."

Windwalker is drawn toward and into the television screen.

---

He falls. The metropolis below, whose skyscrapers were gently waving like flowers a moment ago, twists and writhes. The tallest of the gleaming glass buildings contort themselves into jointed _fingers_. They suddenly thrust themselves out to snatch him from the air. He screams.

The blackness recedes. He was grabbed by something - the city, he thinks - and slammed down hard here by what felt like the hand of God. He's strapped down to a thick steel table. The room is a darkened surgical theater, with strange man-like figures hovering about him or performing unguessable tasks. Each is identical: dressed in pressurized white suits, wearing what look like diving helmets or gas masks to cover their faces.

The shaman cranes his neck; his vision is limited. But he sees needles running into his arm, needles which are connected by narrow tubes to what looks like a funnel. He begins to struggle.

The man in black steps out of the shadows and looks down, bandanna still covering his face. "Oh don't be like that," he coos. "Soon you'll stop being Windwalker and go back to being plain old ----- again."

The men in suits begin to wheel in tall racks of computers - not the sleek modern marvels of plastic and optics, but the old banks of reel-to-reel computers made famous in sci-fi horror like "Colossus" or "Forbidden Planet". They break down the computer components and start to pour them into the funnel. Windwalker watches in detached panic as the liquid computer pours into his veins.

On the other side, another suited scientist is squeezing his arm. He watches as a silvery substance - Axon-5 - is pumped out of his arm and into a waiting canister. "What are they doing?" he asks, strangely calm, looking up at the man in black. The observer gestures. "Extracting you, of course. When there's no more you in you, the vessel will be ready."

Windwalker stares at his body. It's starting to resemble a sort of glass and metal shell, a mockery of the human form. "Bring in the profane," drones one of the scientist. On the far wall, double doors swing open to reveal an abomination. It is a great creaking black statue, forged of iron, burning from within with the light and heat of volcanic lava. But the worst part is what is attached to it.

The angel is alabaster and pure. Even her tears are flawless. She is chained, spread-eagled, to the monstrous mechanical idol. Her wings are pinioned to the black metal. A hose slithers forward from the Axon-5 tanks and slips underneath her robes like a tentacle from a Japanese cartoon. She cries out, a mixture of pain and twisted ecstasy, as the Axon-5 is dispensed. Beneath her robes, her belly begins to swell with the unholy impregnation of the drug. The swell gains features; the features become the silhouette of a screaming face, struggling to tear free from its womb.

---

Windwalker realizes that he briefly passed out. He comes to, staring down at his own body from a detached viewpoint. It's now nothing but a crystalline shell. The scientists are pouring something into his mouth. The body begins to convulse. It strains with all its might at the straps holding it down, clearly in tremendous pain at whatever's being added. One limb after another is held down, and the doctors start to pull black cloth onto the shell. As the mouth opens in a final scream, the scientists tie a black bandanna, decorated with runes in two columns framing the face, around the head.

The man in black now lies on the table, panting heavily. He looks up at Windwalker's detached perspective. "I'm so hungry," he whispers in Dirk's voice.

Windwalker finds himself reaching down, trying to wrap his hands around the man in black's throat. To his surprise, the fingers begin to sink into the body. What was briefly a struggle to strangle this abomination has become an effort to extricate himself from the void. "More," whispers Dirk. "More power. More money. Sex! Excitement! I see the world and I want it all."

"I wanna consume, I wanna eat up a mountain, drink up an ocean, dream up a world. I wanna consume, I wanna smoke up a forest, shoot up a river, run up the bill.." Dirk is singing. Windwalker feels this song is somehow familiar.

"I want women and men, and when the whole damn thing is over, I want it all back again, yeah maybe I'll be happy then..."

Windwalker struggles hard to draw himself back. But he can't escape. "We'll ride the nightmare every night, riskin' our dreams, and then we'll fall from such a height, we'll split our seams!"

As Windwalker starts up the song, he becomes aware. Aware of the noise. The sound, the pain. This is it. the part of what it is that is still Windwalker thinks he hears something he recognizes, a voice, some words, but even trying to trace such thoughts for a second makes the others ring in his ears, until Windwalker thinks he can't hear anything else. Sing dance, distract consume destroy.. That's it.. he must.. consume...

---

Windwalker wakes with a start. He's screaming, drenched in sweat. He strains against the straps on his gurney, eyes bulging, as he tries harder than he's ever tried in his life to lift his hands just so he knows he still has them.

The attendant on duty. A youth that Windwalker doesn't immediately recognize, walks over peering down over his form. "Now now." The young lady smiles, "You had a pretty intense session there." She smiles, ever so sweetly, "Why don't we just settle back a bit and relax, okay?

Windwalker catches his breath, nods. After a few minutes, and a long drink of water, he feels a presence in his mind. The messenger-spirit from before, but something new has been added. _Madness, then,_ the voice observes. _We will take this for further study._ The sensations of the dream begin to drain out of him, leaving him enervated and shaky. _You will be given a token of our gratitude. It is neither necessary nor desirable for you to contact us further, for now; give this warning to any of your more adventurous fellows and to your elders._

"I.. will honor you and the planet," whispers Windwalker faintly, feeling a headache coming. The greater spirits have their own concerns, and their needs cannot be met by anything the Lodge has to offer. Trading favors with the weak and serving the powerful is the way the shamans have operated; Windwalker reminds himself that with some beings in this world, any contact is essentially supplication by a band of pathetic beggars.
