> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay. So, as mentioned before, We're going to be bringing Cyber Chicago to a close soon. I anticipate running two more sessions of this. Today, and the 12th of December."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "The other two between there are the 28th of Nov and the 26th of Dec."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "ANd I'll be gone."

> (OOC) Bash says, "Got it."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "So, we're going to try and speed up plans."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "TO that end, do either of you have anything you want to try and do before wonderboy is done decrypting. You have some time, but it won't be like weeks."

> (OOC) CyberGM idles to wash daughter hair, apperantly. c.c

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "just Bliss job as mentioned"

> (OOC) Bash says, "It might be worth going back to see if my place is under surveillance."

> (OOC) CyberGM hmmss...

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay, before those things can happen."

It's been a couple of days, and Damien, for all his incompetence, has been a little machine, going and plugging away at the code. Every once in a while he'll yell out something seemingly inconsequential, or stand up and pace for several hours, but he runs on little food and little sleep.

On the second night, Windwalker comes back into the room, Bash and Damien still here. Damien has been talked too, and it seems like there's between 1 and 2 days left of work, but he'll definitely have something at the end of that time.

As their conference comes to a close, a somewhat timid knock comes on the door of their little cell.

"Come in, you two," calls Windwalker.

As whomever is without hears the call, he opens the door, and pushes it too, mumbling a low rumble of words and curses. It's Dag Nabbit, from Windwalker's Lodge. "Hey Walker. Some waskley pewsons beel wookin for wou."

Bash looks up at the intrusion. He cracks up for a moment when the man speaks.

The shaman shrugs. "Guess it's urgent, huh? Thanks Dag."

Windwalker realizes he has other people present, and clears his throat. "Bash, Dag Nabbit. Business associate. Dag, Bash - computer expert on contract."

Dag looks over at Bash, and smirks, "What got his ticket?" He asks.. Then he looks up. "Oh Right!" He digs in his pocket, and produces a note with a cellphone attached too it. The cellphone is black. The note simply lists a telephone number,

Bash frowns. "Ticket?"

Dag shrugs, "That's all folks!" and leaves the little room.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Like you didn't know that was comin'..."

Windwalker waves absentmindedly. He's busy fishing out his own phone, and quickly thumbs each number in turn before putting it to his ear.

A voice speaks from the other end, obviously run through a scrambler. "Ah. You didn't use the one I supplied. A pity, but a long shot."

Bash watches the crazy man and his phones.

"State your business," Windwalker replies, eyeing Bash briefly.

"Buisness is good.... Let's see.. Walker I think.. you choose to call yourself. Dirk was still somewhat scatterbrained, even in his condition. You probably know me as Gregory."

Thumbing on the speakerphone option, Windwalker smiles. "Gregory. Fine. Speak." He briefly points at Damien, puts a finger to his lips ("silence"), then draws it across his neck ("or die").

Bash raises his eyebrows.

Damien is so lost in his own world, he just nods happily as he works. "I believe, Walker, or whoever you are, that you have something of mine. Also, let's just say I have a business interest in you. We invested a lot in you..." He spits at this last, even through the vocoder the vitriol can be heard.

Windwalker glances at Bash, then clears his throat. "You made a bad business decision. This thing can't be monetized. Dirk was insane. The rest of us are merely.. employed by someone else. Not a competitor to you. Just not you."

"You speak as if you have power, but you do not." The voice pauses, and continues in a more, controlled, friendly tone, "I would be obliged if your companion and yourself would have a meeting with someone. You can pretend that it will be me, if you like. It may even be. You need not bring the item. You may also choose the locale. You know where to contact me." The phone clicks dead.

Windwalker glances at the delivered phone. "Dammit, Dag," he mutters. "Alright. We're finding another spot to work."

Damien looks up, "What?" He melts out of his haze, "What did I do?"

Windwalker shakes his head. "You're fine. We're relocating. I'll handle it."

Bash says, "I'm confused. Your friend brought your enemy to you?"

"He might have." Windwalker looks at the phone again. "He might not have. Just in case, okay?"

Bash sighs. "Fine. Two days left and we have to move."

Bash says, "How long will it take to find another place?"

Bash gets up and pours coffe into a mug. He hands it to Damien.

Windwalker thinks. "Two hours," he says. "I'm going to meet with Gregory. You in?"

Bash frowns. "I'd like to say no, but if they kill you then we'll be in worse shape. Fine. I'll go. Can you get someone to watch the kid?

"Yeah. I'm calling in some people on this one." Windwalker hefts his phone again. "This is our business now."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Probably."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "GM, priorities are: find a new place to hang out; ditch the potentially tainted phone, or at least keep it well away from new location; call the Lodge and ask for a few hunters as backup; and call Greg back"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Let's pose through some of that, then. Gimmie a few seconds."

The Lodge is contacted through the phone. With what seems like twice as much negotiation than should be required, a compromise is reached. Damien will be housed in a location known to the Lodge, but not too close, a rotating watch of hunters will be assigned. Windwalker is given the location of the new place.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "There's some of the worry off of your backs, anyway. So A) What to do about the phone, and B) Gregory."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "C) anything else i guess. :)"

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "the only reason to keep it around is if I can't reach Gregory again with the provided number on another phone. Otherwise, destroy it."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "You guys can decide. It's reasonable to assume that the Phone number will work until Gregory doesn't want it too anymore."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "I would know that for sure when I try to call him. assume that Bash is informed of anything that doesn't actually mention the Lodge as such, so he can chime in about anything he thinks we should do"

Bash says, "I think we should leave the phone. Maybe burry it. Honstly, I'm not full of ideas for meeting someone who probably wants to capture or kill us. I hack security systems. No one has ever wanted to kidnap me for moving commodities.""

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Or at least, had the means."

> (OOC) Bash says, "I wouldn't know. n.n"

Windwalker hums aloud. "Yeah. And there's only one reason I'm interested in meeting in the flesh..." He doesn't really elaborate, though.

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "sounds like we're in agreement?"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Pose whatever action is being taken, pelase."

> (OOC) Bash says, "Yes."

With that decided, Windwalker calls one of the Lodge's contact numbers - both to appraise them of the evolving situation, and to inquire about a few hunters on tap for muscle, should it be needed. But of course, it will be.

The jist of the other end of the conversation ends up being "We'll back you up however you want, but be careful."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "You guys movin now, then?"

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "yes"

Bash writes up everything that he's learned so far, and sets up a script to blast the info to a hackers board 12 hours after the time set for the meeting. He can easily stop it if things go well, but if not... Well, at least he'll leave something behind.

The new space is a bit more, cramped than the old one. The only place that could be found close enough to the Lodge to allow hunters to watch is a dead-ended service corridor. The electrical hookups are in the ceiling, near a pair of access pipes. Damien, for his part, looks happy as a clam, and nestles into one corner. The black phone is left behind at the old location, and as much precautions as are reasonable are taken to avoid being tracked from there.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Callin' greg back, then?"

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "yah"

The phone is dialed again. "Ah Walker. I knew you would be calling back. Taking every precaution too, I see."

"As are you. Convince me why we should meet," Windwalker answers evenly.

"Surely you have as many questions as I. It would benefit us both to talk. Make no mistake, I will get what I want in the end. We are infinitely patient, we are. I'm just giving you and your friend, the hacker, the chance to get something back from it."

Windwalker spares a glance at Bash. "You aren't likely to give me what I want," he points out. "If what you want is your data, you can have it back when we're done with it."

> (OOC) Bash says, "Is this on speaker?"

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "yes - I thought I posed ICly that it was, if not, sorry"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "You gonna add something, Bash?"

> (OOC) Bash says, "No."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "your ass is on the line too, don't hold back if you hear a bum deal being made :)"

Bash says, "What could you possibly have to give to me? You're either talking out your ass, or you're dangling something. I just can't tell what."

"You don't even know what it is you have, do you?" The voice readjusts again, "Your lives, for one. Possibly even your precious Lodge could continue to exist. And Bash, did you like your stuff? Your plants? Cause that's just a taste..."

Bash blinks. "My plants? What the hell are you talking about?" He turns to Walker, and gives him the universal sign for crazy.

> (OOC) Windwalker is waiting for the moment

"Maintain what you wish, sir. Besides, what do you want from me? Assurances? What is that to you? I will come alone. This time."

"You. You specifically. If you send a proxy he will not return alive," Windwalker says quietly. "I will know. You have assurance of safe passage from me and mine."

"Yes Yes Mr. Walker. Whatever you like, of course. I fear no threat from you, of course, but your assurances are nice."

Bash snorts.

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "gimme some neutral spot I can think of, and I'll pass that on"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "WHere you met Bash is good. Both done communicating, I'll pose wrapup..."

"One thing. Dirk didn't think I'd shoot him either," Windwalker replies casually. "There's a bar..."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "goferit"

"Indeed I know the place. Where you met Johnson. I can be there in two hours." THe phone clicks off.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "That gives you guys probably 90 minutes before the meeting."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "Relaying to other hunters."

> (OOC) Bash says, "Not much for me to do other than tell Damien when we'll be gone, set the timer on my script, and load my gun."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay..."

---

Various preparations are made. A pair of hunters are loosened for Windwalker's use. It is agreed they will wait a building away, around the corner.. Out of site, and far enough to be out of detection, but at hand, as it were. One have a spirit who will follow Windwalker, and report back if backup is needed. At the appointed time, another hunter shows up, and takes custody of Damien, who is as oblivious as ever to the goings on.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Any other preps? Also, are you doing anything before going into the building, (Checking around, etc. etc. etc.)?"

> (OOC) Bash says, "I'd like to make sure we both know where the back door is, and make sure there aren't any goons around."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "checking for nearby buildings - good sniper positions, that sort of thing."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "we'll try to enter, sit and leave in places that don't permit line of sight very far."

Bash, in the intervening time, finds some blueprints of the building that are on file with the state. An old contact at the archival place hooks him up for some goods that were delivered last year, and hey, won't Bash call and hand out sometime. There are two entrances, the front door, and back through the kitchen.

As the pair approach the building, the street is just as desolate as ever. Cars are parked alone the street, but no other sign of life is around. The buildings all around go from ground to ceiling, presumably straight up into the El level.

Bash leans toward Walker. "How are we going to know which one he is?"

"He'll be the one that wants to talk to the blue-haired freak and the prep," ventures Windwalker.

Bash says, "Funny.""

Bash lingers by the door. "Are we good?"

Windwalker nods absently. Today won't involve gunplay - he hopes. What's needed today is the payment he earned for facing a nightmare.

The duo enter the restaurant. The few tables are there again, same grease monkey behind the counter. "Welcome. Git ur grub?" he asks, as the digital **DING-DONG** goes off from opening the door. The rest of the restaurant is empty at this point.

"Coffee," Windwalker grunts.

Bash says, "Coffe and soup. You have soup?"

Bash lights a cigarette and lets his eyes wander. This place kind of depresses him.

The cook smiles a toothless smile. "Yar. Da soup is soup." He smiles, and plops down a couple of cups, and fills both with coffee, then ladles up a soup. "Der." He says, and then looks at the door. That digital **DING-DONG** happens again., "Welcome stranger! Git ur grub?"

Bash peers at the door before grabbing his food.

At the door is a shorter japanese man. He appears to be about 35. "Hello boys." He says, as he notes Bash turning around, "I think we're here to talk, yes? You pick lovely locale."

"Are you Gregory?" Windwalker asks calmly.

Gregory looks at Windwalker, "Were you this untrusting before the drug? I wonder. Of course I am. At least, I am who you mean by that name."

Bash puts the cup and bown down on a nearby table. This place always feels surreal, but this is going in a new direction.

"Then sit down," and Windwalker gestures at a seat.

> (OOC) Windwalker rolls 3d for 12 (5 2 5) vs. 15, succeeding by 3

The man nods, and moves to take a seat, opposite of Windwalker.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Sry.. Some negotiation."

"I don't remember," Windwalker replies. "So far you haven't made offers, only threats. Can we do better than that?"

Gregory smiles at Windwalker, and then turns to Bash, "Is the coffee here good.. Bash, I believe?"

Bash sits at a table next to Windwalker. "I wouldn't use that word to describe it, but I've had worse."

Gregory shrugs, "Perhaps. I am not one that is given to compromise, you must understand. Especially with those who have no power. What is it you really want? I know what I'm getting."

Windwalker folds his hands together. "I want everyone who knows about the Lodge dead or silenced. I want end-to-end production capacity for me and mine. I sincerely doubt what's in the box is worth all that, but you asked."

"The people I represent will always have someone who knows, Mr. Walker." Gregory sighs, "Always the secrecy with you. And if you had the production, what then? Would you still have the Lodge? Or just a bunch of junkies with a really advanced fix?" He looks down at his watch, then looks back up at you both. "It's so good of you to come though. Arrangements can be made in the middle, of course. I'm willing to offer you all the drug you like. Dirk certainly got it. But I always have been. The haggle has always been the cost."

"Why don't you just leave us alone?" counters Windwalker. "Think of us what you like, do something else, but why not just leave it be?"

"Where is the money in that Mr. Walker? What does my company get, exactly?" He pauses, "This is bigger than me anyway. I'm just here to make contact. Assure my people that you are who you are, so to speak." He looks at his watch again, "It is about time." He says.

Windwalker holds up a hand. "If this is _just_ about money, then I have a deal for you. But is it?"

"Officially, of course, the stockholders believe it is. Between you and me. .And Bash. And the cook, I think they don't like to feel beaten. Even by a group of junkies."

"There's a way everyone gets to win then." Windwalker thinks a moment. It's either this, or eternal war. "Sell us the production line, enough to keep the Lodge running. We'll repay you for the value of the equipment, plus your R&D costs. We have a major hurdle to overcome, but... we can be good for it, given enough time and creativity. You get to wash your hands of some unpleasant business, everyone gets what they claim they want."

Bash clears his throat. "About that..."

"Yes, Mr. Bash?"

Bash says, "I'd just like to point out that I'm only involved in this because you people wanted me to crack into your lab. I don't understand why, but it's been pretty shitty since. The way I see it, you owe me. You know what I want? Life, limb, freedom...and money. I'm not asking to be made rich. But you do owe me for the job."

Bash says, "Oh, and my apartment, which I'm sure you trashed."

"I do believe you are correct, Mr. Bash. I am sorry.I will arrange remuneration as soon as I can. And perhaps something for your apartment as well. A shame really. Some people have no finesse." Gregory pauses, turning to Windwalker.

"Windwalker. You are surprisingly lucid for one of, them. Your thinking is wise, and I commend you for it. I will about it. Please call me when it's over." And with that, Gregory moves to depart.

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "ok"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "OK?"

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "well that went better than I expected, which was 'us dead in an explosion' or something."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Well...."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "'I will about it' - verb missing?"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "THink, sorry, fixing."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "I see no reason to stop him at this time."

Bash says, "Yeah, I'm sure it's not going to be this easy. If he was on a time table then we better get back to the box quick."

> (OOC) Bash says, "doh!"

Windwalker nods thoughtfully. "Yeah. We bought ourselves enough time to finish that. I hope."

As the door shuts behind Gregory, two things happen. One, Gram's spirit leaves Windwalker. And Walker's phone rings.

Windwalker answers.
