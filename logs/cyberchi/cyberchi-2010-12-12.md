# Cyber Chicago 2010-12-12

> (OOC) Log "CyberChi-2010-12-12" started by CyberGM at Sun Dec 12 19:10:02 2010 CST (OOC)

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay... remember where we left off?"

> (OOC) Bash says, "I had enough time to read the log. :)"

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "WW got a call sayin Lodge was under attack"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay. I'm going to assume both of you are off to defend? WW was specifically ordered to."

> (OOC) Windwalker is doin so yeah

> (OOC) Bash says, "I don't like the idea of being alone right now, so I'm with him."

The Lodge outpost that is being hit is am older one. Not connected with where Windwalker generally gets his orders and assignments, but the area is familiar enough for him. Windwalker knows of a seldom used access corridor that cuts 5 or so minutes off of the response time. The inside of the old cast iron steam pipe is corroded, but someone has welded rebar into ladder rungs to guide on the way down. The fit is somewhat tight, but not suffocatingly so. As the pair reach the bottom, shouts and gunfire can be heard.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Reactions? Actions?"

Bash pulls his gun. "I don't think this is a good idea. I think coffee with Damien is sounding rather nice."

Windwalker has his guns out. Charging in won't help yet. "Stay back then," he says curtly. There must be a way to surprise these guys, and he moves slower as he gets closer.

Still inside of the steam tunnel, the pair hears a scream, then the gunplay dies down. Wet footsteps clamor away, getting softer.

> (OOC) Windwalker will go check it out

Bash says, "I'll, uh, guard the rear."

The Steam tunnel lets out into what used to be a sewer. No waist is run through here, and the water is down to a mere trickle in the middle of the round passage. Windwalker sees a couple of men in black turn down a passage twenty or so feet ahead. They are heading for the outpost. A moan sounds from the wet, where a limp, bloodied body sits.

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "if I recognize the downed man as one of mine, First Aid-4."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "er, 14"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "He is. go ahead and roll it, and I'll pose some more into into the log."

> (OOC) Windwalker rolls 3d for 10 (1 4 5) vs. 14, succeeding by 4

The downed man, more of a boy really, as Windwalker approaches, is known as Cheezy. No one really knows why. He's one of the hopefuls, non Axon users that serve as grunts and foot soldiers for the lodge. He groans, and smiles, "I guess I'll be seeing the spirits soon." A smile on his face.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Go ahead and pose succeeding in getting him patched up,a dn whatever response you want, and then we'll continue."

Windwalker tears apart some of the kid's clothes, making bandages and halting the bleeding as best he can. "When you can move," he mutters, "get out of here. Until then, play dead." Readying his weapons again, he calls for Bash and heads further in.

Bash follows quietly. He pauses for a moment near the boy, then keeps going.

More gunshots are heard down the corridor. As the pair tears down the sewer, making the same turn that the suits did, they see four men with their guns drawn, in a face off with several members of the Lodge. The men now caught between the front of the outpost and Windwalker and Bash. The men are opening fire on the Lodge.

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "if they don't see me, aim first then fire."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "You guys can take actions until they detect your presence, then we'll enter combat time. Anything loud or obnoxious counts."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Go ahead and roll to hit with full aim, you can spare the time. Distance is 15 yards."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Bash?"

> (OOC) Bash says, "Same. Too close to pass up a free aim."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "15 yards -5, acc 2 and 3 rounds of aim +4, net skill 12"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay.. Full aim is whatever Acc on your weapon is +2. 15 yeards is -5.."

> (OOC) Windwalker rolls 3d for 13 (4 6 3) vs. 12, failing by 1

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "bah"

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "actually no that hits, I have laser sights now"

> (OOC) Windwalker rolls 2d+2 for 14 (6 6 2) damage

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "They can't defend an attack they're unaware of so... WOW."

> (OOC) CyberGM rolls 3d6 for 10 (3 6 1)

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay. One falls down. GO ahead and pose mowing one guy down. "

Out of the suits' field of vision, Windwalker and Bash have a few seconds. Drawing a bead on one man, the shaman carefully opens fire, sending a bullet on a bloody path through one of the shooters' chests.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Bash."

> (OOC) Bash rolls 3d6 for 13 (5 6 2)

> (OOC) Bash says, "My Acc is only 2, I think, and skill is 13. I'm not sure how that works."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "That means you miss. Gimmie a miss pose, please."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "if you have a TL9 gun or so, you also have a sight, so that should hit"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay then. n.n"

> (OOC) Bash says, "I have absolutely no idea what I have, since we never did EQ for my character. o.o; I'm not sure how that never came up before."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "you have no reason NOT to have a modern gun, so yeah"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "COmbat light roleplay, I guess. "

> (OOC) Bash says, "I was assuming an auto-pistol 9mm, since I just have basic skills in that area."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Go ahead and roll 2d6+2 damange too. We'll just give you WW's gun. :D"

> (OOC) Bash rolls 2d6+2 for 7 (4 1 2)

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay. That'll hurt, but he's not down. Pose 'em please."

Bash fires at the closest thug. The bullet hits the man squarly. He stumbles, but does not fall.

The suits turn around as Bash and Windalker open fire against them. The wounded one turns to return fire at Bash. The other two yell out, but continue their fire against the outpost. In the distance, you see a red smear as one of the outpost holders is hit.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay. CObat order should be Bash -> WW -> Thugs -> Outpost. Bash, you can go again. Options are: Aim and get +2 next round to hit(-3 total to hit). Fire wildly, but you'll be firing at -5. Or do something else."

> (OOC) Bash says, "Aim. I'm a lousy shot."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "'k WW?"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "We wont' pose aiming, cause it'll happena lot, I expect."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "Move and Attack. I can close the distance to 10 yards so it's kind of a wild shot, but still."

> (OOC) Windwalker rolls 3d for 12 (4 4 4) vs. 9, failing by 3

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay"

Windwalker rushes forward, opening fire in an attempt to spook the shooters.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "The thug turns his aim on Windwalker. The firefight between the Outpost and the attackers continues. Bash again. Each extra round aiming will give you an additional +1, up to 2 extra rounds, or you can fire at -3. I don't suggest sitting around and aiming, but the option is there."

> (OOC) Bash says, "Taking the shot."

> (OOC) Bash rolls 3d6 for 17 (6 5 6)

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Hrm.. miss again. Windwalker?"

> (OOC) Bash says, ";.;"

> (OOC) CyberGM patpats.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "You're a hacker, not a gunsmith. :)"

> (OOC) Bash says, "It's still embarassing to miss at this range."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "a single shot will probably miss. in a gun battle, only a few rounds need to hit."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "okay. Move and Attack again, closing to 5 yards."

> (OOC) Windwalker rolls 3d for 10 (5 1 4) vs. 11, succeeding by 1

> (OOC) Windwalker rolls 2d+2 for 9 (5 2 2) damage

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "wounded guy"

> (OOC) CyberGM rolls 3d6 for 11 (4 6 1)

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay, didn't dodge."

> (OOC) CyberGM rolls 3d6 for 13 (5 6 2)

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "And he falls down. Pose em. You're also breathing down the other two's necks"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Honestly, usually what happens is miss miss miss miss hit by 9, 3 bullets, full of holes."

Closing the gap, Windwalker finishes off the surprised shooter and ends up in dancing distance of his remaining targets.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "The other two are unaware, so you either of you can try something for a round or two if you like before they turn to check again."

> (OOC) Bash says, "Aim. ;.;"

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "like aiming for two rounds at the back of their heads? ^\_^"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "That's kinda what I had in mind."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "sporting odds - 13 + 1 + 4 - 7 is 11- to hit."

> (OOC) Windwalker rolls 3d for 8 (2 3 3) vs. 11, succeeding by 3

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Is your intention to ... Yes."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Two bullets hit.. 4d6+4 to the head = dead. I'll just pose through. :)"

Windwalker and Bash both walk up to the remaining guards, and provide their brains with some air conditioning. With the four agents' blood inking up the water in the sewer, Walker nods to the shaman who were guarding the outpost. One yells, "There's more resistance out front! Come on!" The two are guided down some halls, confusion and panic fills the outpost, shaman and helpers running around the place. They exit the front of the fort onto a large, pitched battle, but they seem to be late to the party.

Two of the hunters in particular are taking care of business. One is a flickering shade, wrapped on black anti-light, using a rough-hewn stick with deadly effect. The other is wrapped head to toe in synthetic faux-leather, and his hands are on fire. He's using a hard-hitting boxing style.

Bash stares. "What the fuck is that?"

Around them, the inhabitants of the Lodge are rallying or cowering. The people here have degrees of functionality, from the highly lethal but barely trained, to the incoherent and crippled. Their corporate attackers are almost absurdly uniform in their capabilities by contrast.

Windwalker blinks at Bash. "What's what?" he asks, not understanding the problem.

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Also, while you guys discuss that, decide what your next move is. You have a few."

Bash points. "The shadowy man and the burning dude! That's not normal. Is this your magical den or something? You're not going to suddenly burst out with wings, are you?"

"Ah, don't worry about that," Windwalker observes. He thinks for a moment. What's that word he remembers from the scifi movies? "Prototypes," he adds.

Bash gives Walker a stern look. "Your R&D is frightning."

Bash looks for some cover.

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "alright. check on the Lodge dudes to see where else we're needed"

The attack seems to have been seriously underwhelming, compared to the call that came out. A dozen or so suits at the front, and the half a dozen at the rear were all that were spared. THe fight winds down, with the last suit disappearing unto the black shade. Windwalker talks to several of the other hunters, but everything seems to be under control.

Bash turns to Walker. "Check in with the guards for D-boy. The timing for this worries me."

Windwalker moves about, administering first aid where necessary. "Alright.."

> (OOC) Windwalker will ask around

Windwalker calls the guards for the intrepid little hacker. The guards report that they didn't hear anything, and were kept on duty. But Damien on the background can be heard in the background yelling. "Oh, he's been doing that too."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "k, go check on him"

The pair don't seem to be needed at the outpost anymore, so Windwalker leads them back to the access corridor where they left Damien. He's jumping around excitedly and he looks at Bash. "Bash! Bash! Look!" He cries, pointing at the screen of his laptop. Discarded coffee cups are strewn about his warm little corner.

Bash leans over and peruses the screen.

Bash reaches for his cigarettes, and lights up carefully. He reaches into another pocket and pulls out a flash stick. He sets the data to copy over. "You did good, kid. Leave this alone for a moment. I need to talk to Walker. Go take a piss or something."

Bash motions to Walker to come closer. "This is chemical. It's got the chain and all the notes on the test subjects. There's a lot of dirt on here on CA. They've been playing with street drugs, trying to hook their own little group of junkies."

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "Chemistry-13, Pharmacy-13"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "It's all the info you could ever want on Axon-5. No specifics for any other drugs are in there."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Just vague references to other street drugs."

Windwalker grunts. "The entire thing," he says after a few moments.

Bash lights up another cig. He's got a scowl plastered on his face. When the transfer finishes, he pulls out the stick and stands up. "This will be the only copy. I don't want anything to do with this-" His phone beeps at him. A quick glance shows a much larger deposit than he expected. He sighs and offers Walker the stick.

Windwalker nods, and pulls out his own phone to dial Gregory.

"Ah yes. Walker. I had heard of our misfortune at The Lodge. Most unfortunate." Gregory sighs, "Dirk's legacy lives on, one supposes."

Bash takes a moment to stop his auto-blast that was set up before the meeting. Then he loads up a program to write over the drive 32 times.

"You said your guys don't like to lose against junkies," Windwalker answers evenly. "If they don't want to lose, stop attacking us. Think about my proposal."

Gregory clears his throat on the other side of the line. "I have given it some thought. What about Chicago Aerosol's cube?"

Windwalker allows himself a smile. "We cracked it."

"Excellent." Gregory says, in an surprisingly unironic tone of voice. "Then you must know." He says, but doesn't wait for an answer. "Very Good. I believe my last act will be formalizing the contract between The Lodge and Chicago Aerosol. After all, you have me up against a wall." He chuckles at this last.

Windwalker hangs up. He turns to Bash. "You got what you needed?"

Bash says, "I've been paid and I'm still breathing. I'll call it even.""

Windwalker turns this over in his mind. "We got what we wanted too. This will make a big difference for us." He pauses, then extends his hand. "Thanks."

Bash takes it. "You're welcome. It's been exciting and all, but don't take offence if I'm glad this is over and I don't see you for a while." He cracks a grin, then looks at Damien. "What about you, kid. I got paid, so you get paid. Are you going back to street hacking?"

Damien looks at Bash, "Well, honestly, this was my first gig. But I'd say it was pretty successful." He smiles, and looks at the computer, "But if you ever need someone, let me know." He says, hopefully.

Bash twirls a lighter between his fingers. "You've got some skills. I could maybe use a decrypter for odd jobs."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "I swapped those two."

> (OOC) Bash says, "Do you have anything else planned? This sounds like a good ending point."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "I think ww has something for us."

Windwalker claps Damien on the shoulder as well. "This is good work. Your coding teacher should be very impressed. Maybe impressed enough to.. well, go admit your feelings."

Damien blushes and looks at Windwalker. "How did you... How?.. What?" The boy turns a very nice shade of read, and turns back to his computer."

Windwalker smiles at Bash in turn. "Preparation. Down here, we're good at what we do, so don't forget about us either."

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Sehr gut?"

> (OOC) Windwalker says, "yah"

> (OOC) CyberGM says, "Okay then. n.n"
