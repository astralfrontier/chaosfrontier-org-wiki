# Demo 2009-06-20

Ezra says, "1. make sure you have your character sheet handy."

Ezra says, "There are a couple of sets of numbers that I will expect you guys to have ready access to:"

Ezra says, "- Your DEFENSES (dodge, parry, or block as appropriate). These will not change during the fight, so don't slow down and ask for modifiers or anything to them. there won't be any."

Ezra says, "- Your relevant ATTACK skills (like the Innate Attack skill, or Axe/Mace, or Spear, or whatever)"

Ezra says, "everyone have those handy?"

Ezra says, "how about Innate Attack, which you use for spells? Please talk IC, we aren't posing"

TidesGM says, "I didn't buy Innate Attack :/ Hadn't sorted all that out."

Ezra says, "go ahead and take Innate Attack now. take it at DX+2, for 4 points."

Ezra \[to TidesGM\]: "okay. got your defenses worked out as well? If not I'll give you those numbers now."

Saeren says, "Crud.. I don't have an innate attack ><"

Ezra \[to Saeren\]: "same deal. buy it at DX+2, for 4 points"

TidesGM has Parry at 3 + half weapon skill

TidesGM says, "and dodge at 3 + half basic speed. 8 both cases."

Ezra says, "dodge should be 3+ basic speed."

TidesGM says, "oh right. basic speed is half dex?"

Ezra says, "basic speed is (DX+HT)/4"

Saeren says, "Innate is 12, then"

Ezra says, "okay, that's pretty good. Kagarn should have at least a 12 as well."

TidesGM does.

Ezra says, "so yeah, compute dodge, compute parry. you only have to do this once in your life, unless your basic stats change :)"

Ezra says, "2. when ready, connect to maptool at www.memesis.org port 3300"

Saeren says, "So my parry is 10, dodge is 8, innate is 12, staff skill is 14."

Ezra nods

Ezra says, "Low defenses aren't that bad, for reasons we'll talk about as we go."

Ezra says, "3. Everyone give me your BASIC SPEED. this is used for initiative. The init order will not change during the fight, and there is no random roll."

Ezra says, "Your basic speed could have fractions, e.g. 5.25. Please give me the whole thing."

TidesGM says, "5.00"

Ezra says, "If you didn't record basic speed, it's (DX+HT)/4"

Nerai says, "5.25"

Saeren smacks lag.

Saeren says, "5 basic speed"

Ezra says, "Okay. You guys should see tokens for Shaman and Warlock at the bottom of the map, that's you guys."

Ezra says, "Brendan should see a single FOO unit north of them, that's his guy."

Saeren says, "I see no tokens."

Nerai says, "I see nosink."

Ezra says, "try now"

Saeren says, "there we go"

Ezra says, "it left the old map in the system, sorry about that"

Saeren says, "The shaman is a dog. Heehee"

Nerai says, "I see"

TidesGM says, "That's Ghost Wolf!"

Ezra says, "During your turn, you will have options: Move, Attack, Move and Attack, Wait, and so forth. in general you can just tell me your intent, and I will tell you the maneuvers you want, if you aren't sure."

Saeren says, "Okay :)"

Ezra says, "Also, attacks are built around: rolling to hit, rolling a defense, and computing damage."

Ezra says, "If you caster types haven't got as far as armor or gear, I will give you guys DR 2 light leather to wear."

Ezra says, "FOO guys have no armor and are scrubs, and will die quickly"

Saeren says, "Sucks to be them n.n"

TidesGM did, in fact, sort out light leather, except for the chest which is DR 4/2.

Saeren says, "Can I have an imp icon?"

Ezra \[to TidesGM\]: "Then lucky you, you have good armor :)"

Saeren says, "I'll take the 2, it's better than what I had ^^;;"

Ezra says, "okay, there's an imp."

Ezra says, "imp's Basic Speed is what?"

TidesGM says, "I tuned the weight of my combat gear to being just under my Unencumbered limit. Of course, this means I'm leaving my backpack on the ground or something."

Ezra says, "that's fine."

Saeren says, "Imp is also 5."

Ezra says, "okay. any questions before we begin?"

Saeren says, "It has dodge 8, no melee skills. It's basically a fire ball emitting doofus."

TidesGM says, "Not yet. Any other questions I have will arise as we play."

Ezra checks Brendan and sumi?

Saeren says, "I'm good."

Saeren says, "Let's get ready to rumble n.n"

Ezra says, "okay. combat begins!"

Ezra says, "FOO has the highest basic speed and so goes first."

Ezra says, "Combat turns are 1 second long."

Ezra says, "no posing or any such thing, just describe what action you try to take."

FOO1is running forward, trying to use the cover of the tree to hide his attack as best he can, which still maintaining full speed.

Ezra says, "okay. so you can move up to your Move score, and that's it."

Ezra says, "Reggie, Kagarn and Imp can all act in DX order. I assume you guys are all DX 10 or something, so Reggie, then Kagarn, then Imp."

Nerai moved 5

Saeren says, "Okay, can I see enough to throw a fireball?"

Ezra says, "you can start casting fireball sure. you won't have one to throw on this turn."

Saeren says, "Alright, I will prep fireball. I have 16 skill and magery 3. n.n"

Saeren says, "I think Kagarn is up now"

Ezra says, "okay. so roll to cast the spell, which will give you a fireball. you can invest 1-3 energy points. 1 energy = 1d of damage. how much?"

Saeren says, "I'll go for 1d :)"

Saeren says, "Success by 4."

Ezra says, "okay. with skill 15, you get a 1-point discount, so you pay no fatigue. you now have a 1d fireball which you can throw next turn."

Ezra says, "Kagarn, what do you want to do?"

TidesGM says, "I'll go for a 1-point lightning bolt. My skill's only 13 though, since I never did figure out how to buy spells properly n.n"

Ezra says, "okay. you have a 1-die lightning bolt ready, pay 1 Fatigue."

Ezra says, "(which is to say, just keep a note that you spent it)"

TidesGM says, "yup."

Ezra says, "imp?"

Saeren says, "Innate attack"

Saeren says, "I think it's in range, anyway.. I have range 5x."

Ezra says, "What is its range stats?"

Ezra says, "like the actual numbers? 1/2D and Max?"

Saeren says, "I don't have any stats recorded, just the 5x"

Ezra says, "okay. in the future, please be sure to record the actual ranges in yards :)"

Saeren says, "Sorry. n.n"

Saeren says, "If the range is 1/2D 10, Max 100 and then boosted with 5x, what does that mean?"

Ezra says, "for the record, Innate Attack is normally 1/2D 10, Max 100. if both of those are increased, it's 1/2D 50, Max 500."

Ezra says, "(we'll definitely want to tune that to bring it into line with normal spell attacks, which is fine)"

Saeren says, "I had no idea ^^"

Ezra says, "Getting an idea is why we are here today ;)"

Saeren says, "So let's assume it has the proper range modifiers."

Saeren says, "..."

Saeren oopses.

Ezra says, "Alright. At 15 yards, you're at -5 to hit (this comes off the speed-range chart)."

Ezra says, "so roll your Innate Attack SKILL at -5."

Saeren says, "Failed."

Ezra says, "okay. imp misses. Next round, Foo acts."

Nerai says, "Moar running"

Ezra says, "okay. On this round, FOO 2 spawns at the ruined tower."

Ezra says, "He will get to act next round."

Ezra says, "Reggie now acts"

Nerai says, "I'm in ur campsite, tryin' to pee on ur fire."

Nerai nods.

Saeren says, "Okay, my fireball is loosed on the guy trying to put out my fire."

Saeren says, "Cause I got some hot dogs to roast."

Ezra says, "okay. range is 5 yards, so -2 to hit."

Ezra says, "roll your Innate Attack skillz."

Saeren says, "I fail."

Ezra says, "okay. fireball is expended."

Ezra says, "Kagarn is up"

Saeren says, "I am beginning to suspect that I need to put innate attack through the roof."

TidesGM says, "Can I Aim after casting the spell?"

Ezra says, "we'll talk about that in a moment :)"

Ezra says, "Why yes you can :D"

Saeren says, "Aiming is for wimps!"

TidesGM says, "Taking a step backward and Aiming my Innate Attack at the doodz."

Nerai says, "Hmm Aim Action..."

Ezra says, "So this turn is spent Aiming. on any subsequent turn, you get the Acc bonus."

Saeren says, "Also for people who want to hit something."

Ezra says, "alright. ipm?"

Ezra . o O ( IBM )

Saeren says, "It only does one thing."

Saeren says, "Fireball."

Saeren says, "innate attack, rather."

Nerai says, "Initial Program Load?"

TidesGM says, "More like HCF"

Ezra says, "range is 9 yards, so -4"

Saeren says, "Made by 5"

Ezra says, "if you guys are wondering where I am getting these numbers, it's in the back of both Characters and the Campaigns books."

Ezra says, "okay. FOO, you can attempt to dodge."

Nerai says, "Made exactly"

Ezra says, "okay. FOO lives for 1 more second."

Ezra says, "Next round. FOO and FOO 2 can both act."

Nerai says, "Move & attackl - slam atacion against Warlock"

Ezra says, "okay. Make your roll to hit."

Nerai says, "Made by one with -2"

Ezra says, "... what?"

TidesGM says, "What's your skill again?"

Nerai says, "I made by 3"

Nerai says, "Er, sorry, I dum"

Nerai says, "I missed."

Nerai need to think UNDER not OVER. c.c

Saeren lives... for now

TidesGM bonks Nerai.

Ezra says, "okay. Your Slam misses, so you're right there."

Ezra says, "and I see Foo 2 moved."

Saeren gives this guy the most affectionate hug ever.

Nerai says, "Yes"

Ezra says, "Reggie's up"

Saeren says, "I'm going to prep wither limb. skill 16."

Saeren says, "Actually, sec."

Saeren says, "I will try death touch instead, since he's so close :)"

Saeren says, "skill is only 14, so I use 1 fatigue for 1d."

Ezra says, "okay. As a Melee spell, you charge it up this turn, and attack next."

TidesGM says, "This is the part that's gonna cause me trouble adjusting to GURPS. d20 made me allergic to casting magic with a foe in the next cell over."

Nerai tries to give Reggie a big sloppy kiss.

Ezra says, "roll to cast."

Saeren says, "I make it by 6."

Ezra says, "okay. kagarn, you have your 1d missile and the Acc bonus of 3 is added to your to-hit"

Saeren says, "I fail to understand why I didn't put this spell at 15, but this is a learning process.."

Ezra says, "range of 5 is -2"

TidesGM says, "Okay, So net +1 to my Innate Attack..."

TidesGM says, "made by 5."

Ezra says, "okay. FOO, want to dodge?"

Saeren says, "Take it like a man!"

TidesGM says, "Wow. :)"

Ezra says, "And he ninjas his way out of a lightning bolt."

Ezra says, "imp?"

Ezra says, "range of 5 yards is still -2 to hit."

Saeren says, "Can it step back and throw a fireball? How does it get out of this penalty to hit?"

Nerai issa NINJA

Saeren says, "I'm not clear if it should be closer, farther, or what :)"

Ezra \[to Saeren\]: "the penalty to hit comes from being far away from your target, just like hitting with any other ranged attack on the planet."

Nerai says, "You could take a turn to aim"

Ezra says, "The way to mitigate that penalty is to aim, or to have higher skill."

Nerai says, "Or get closer."

Saeren says, "I think I'll try once more to hit where it's at :)"

Saeren says, "Aiming cannot help rolls like that ^^;;"

Ezra says, "okay, imp fails."

Nerai says, "The RNG on this machine is merceless."

Ezra says, "FOO and FOO 2 can act."

Nerai says, "As far as FP works, I know I expend to sprint.. How does FP return? Just sitting still, some per round, or?"

Ezra says, "you get 1 FP back after resting for 10 minutes."

Ezra says, "so it won't come back in combat."

Nerai says, "Also, Foo tries to hit the Warlock."

Nerai says, "Makes his skill exactly."

Ezra says, "okay. Reggie can attempt to dodge or parry."

Ezra says, "Now:"

Saeren says, "If I have a parry of 10 is it better to try than to dodge at 8?"

Ezra says, "because this is a melee attack, you can also RETREAT, for a further +3 to either of those."

Ezra says, "Yes, always use the most advantageous defense you have."

Saeren says, "What's the downfall of retreat?"

Ezra says, "that you move back 1 yard."

Saeren says, "I'll do that, my weapon can reach."

Ezra says, "if you're on the edge of a cliff, not so good. Anywhere else, always retreat."

Saeren says, "Okay, +3 to parry."

Saeren says, "That makes it 13."

Saeren says, "Oh, but the staff is also +2 to parry :)"

Saeren says, "so 15"

Ezra says, "okay, you turn aside Foo's spear."

Nerai will follow up after attack, as is his perogative.

Ezra says, "that's fine. Foo acted, now Reggie's turn"

Nerai says, "Other Foo runs."

Nerai says, "So, ya"

Nerai says, "Well, doesn't RUN, but.."

Saeren says, "Gonna try to land death touch now."

Saeren says, "I can do this with a regular staff attack."

Ezra says, "okay, roll your Staff skill to hit"

Saeren says, "OI."

Saeren says, "Am I rolling good D&D characters tonight or what? :D"

Nerai The Legend will never die.

Saeren says, "I'm not sure this fight will ever end ^^;;"

Ezra says, "okay. you still have the spell and can attempt next turn."

Saeren says, "For the love of god, Mike, hit the bad guy."

TidesGM says, "Well, this round Imma chargin mah lazo... lightning."

Ezra says, "you spend at most 1 FP"

Ezra says, "no matter how many you were gonna invest."

TidesGM says, "ah okay."

Ezra says, "(so it's not a total assrape)"

Ezra says, "imp"

TidesGM says, "I only have PI of 1, I'd probably reshuffle some points to buy that at least to 2."

Saeren says, "step and innate attack okay?"

Ezra says, "Yes, you can step and attack"

Ezra says, "4 yards is still -2 to hit"

Saeren says, "Then it's exactly a hit."

Ezra says, "FOO can dodge?"

Nerai says, "No he can't."

Ezra says, "okay, imp does damage."

Saeren says, "Okay.."

Saeren says, "It's 1d :)"

Nerai says, "So, explain to me range and this table again?"

Saeren says, "><"

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "do you have either the characters or campaigns book?"

Saeren says, "Behold my works, ye mighty, and despair."

Nerai says, "I guess what I'm having problems with is... shouldn't the weapon involved have a say in how accurate it is?"

Nerai says, "I have both."

Nerai is looking at the table now.

Saeren says, "what page is that on, Nerai?"

Nerai is wondering what 'range 10/5' means, and also the question above.

Ezra says, "The reason you aren't getting any bonus for weapon accuracy is because, except for the one guy, nobody is aiming. :)"

Nerai says, "Campaigns 550"

Nerai doesn' thave characters open.

Ezra says, "Range 10/15 means: half damage out to 10 yards, maximum range 15 yards."

Nerai says, "So... I need to throw at like 12 yards?"

Saeren says, "Thanks, now I have it :)"

Nerai says, "And: THe weapons determines the range modifier?"

Saeren says, "Wow, I gotta be in your trousers to get 0 ^^"

Ezra says, "The weapon determines the range modifier."

Nerai says, "What about the aim bonus?"

Ezra says, "Muscle-powered thrown weapons, like spears, are based on your ST, BUT some weapons travel further than others per point of ST."

Ezra says, "Accuracy is all from the weapon."

Nerai says, "Okay."

Saeren says, "I imagine arrows would be great range per point. n.n"

Nerai is better now, thanks.

Ezra says, "A gun's range, or a spell's range, comes entirely from the spell - it doesn't matter how strong or smart you are, a fireball goes THIS FAR."

Ezra says, "Alright, pausing for any other questions. Please tell me to resume if we're good :)"

Saeren says, "Hm, no, I'm good :)"

Nerai says, "Weapon tables in characters or campaigns?"

Saeren says, "I think it's end of characters where equipment is found"

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "weapons are in Characters, starting at p. 264"

Nerai says, "Thanks."

Ezra says, "Murloc mooks use spears because spears are cheap :)"

Saeren is totally gonna thumb war this Foo Monster.

Ezra checks Mike for questions?

TidesGM says, "Good so far."

Saeren says, "Oh, why didn't the mook have a dodge?"

Ezra \[to Saeren\]: "he did, he just didn't succeed at the roll"

Saeren says, "Ah, okay"

Saeren says, "I missed the roll :)"

Saeren did 1 damage. Not sure if burning matters.

Ezra says, "Alright. imp did 1 point of damage."

Ezra says, "FOO is at -1 on his NEXT TURN for attacks or other rolls (except defenses)."

Saeren says, "He's proven the most accomplished warrior in the field."

Ezra says, "Foo and Foo 2 can now act."

Nerai hit warloc wif spear

TidesGM says, "First blood. Or burn, or whatever."

Nerai hits

Saeren says, "Stepping back, parrying."

Saeren says, "By 6 with my staff."

Saeren says, "This idiot warlock is pretty damn good at parrying >.>"

Ezra says, "quarterstaffs are just that good."

Nerai says, "He better be.. The mook hurts a bit."

Ezra says, "okay. Reggie?"

Saeren says, "Gonna try to hit the bad guy with my staff."

Nerai says, "Also, follow. FOoo2 moves"

Ezra says, "okay. Foo can dodge or parry (and retreat is also viable)"

Nerai fails to dodge

Saeren says, "I gotta look up my damage.. strenth 9, swing +2"

Nerai says, "1d-1?"

Nerai says, "Ya.. 1d-1+2"

Ezra says, "Right. swing damage for ST9 is 1d-1, so +2 would be 1d+1. so please record that as your staff damage."

Saeren says, "Okay :0"

Ezra says, "So do that damage, AND your Deathtouch skill goes off."

Saeren says, "I should roll my staff apart from the deathtouch, right?"

Ezra says, "nobody cares"

Saeren says, "I think deathtouch ignores dr."

Nerai has no DR

Saeren says, "oh"

Ezra says, "yeah. in this case it's fine."

Saeren clobbers him n.n

Nerai pats himself for the summon armor spell.

Nerai is hurt!

Ezra says, "okay. Foo is now at 0 HP. Foo, roll HT or keel over unconscious"

Nerai says, "If I tool 10 and I have 11 HT... arent' I at 1 HP?"

Nerai says, "Wait, no, obviously not."

Ezra says, "oh you have 11? my bad."

Ezra says, "you're fine, stay up."

Nerai says, "HT i 11, HP is 10"

Saeren says, "Yeah, HP is ST :)"

Saeren screwed that up too ><

Nerai says, "Oh oops."

Saeren says, "So you made your HT roll."

Nerai is now a Murloc Lich.

Saeren says, "You are on your feet!"

Nerai nods.

Saeren says, "I think."

Ezra says, "okay. Foo is at -4 on his NEXT TURN."

Ezra says, "Reggie is done. Kagarn?"

TidesGM says, "I'm going to live up to Kagarn's reputation! Move and Attack."

Saeren says, "After further review, death touch is kick butt."

Saeren says, "Not if you hit something and don't get pummelled you won't :D"

TidesGM says, "So that's at -2 for moving?"

Ezra says, "okay. if you move and attack, and you AREN'T slamming him, your highest attack roll will be 9."

Ezra says, "it's a flat -5 otherwise (doesn't matter how far you moevd)"

Saeren says, "God, the druid would be scary with her magic quarterstaff in this system n.n"

Ezra says, "if you just want to slam him, no penalty n.n"

Saeren says, "Slam him! Slam him! :D"

Saeren is guessing that Kagarn has no brawling skills.

TidesGM says, "Is there any compelling reason to just move vs. move-and-attack if you end up at melee?"

Nerai thought SLam still ate a -2... I'm probably wrong, in any case.

Saeren says, "I think next round the foo monster is in trouble.. just in time to be replaced by another faceless mook n.n"

Nerai says, "Oh wait, that's ranged, sorry, I can't read. :("

Saeren says, "and when you say -4 next turn, that means he can dodge, parry, etc. at full skill this round?"

Nerai says, "I don't think defences are effected in any case."

Saeren says, "Ah"

Ezra says, "okay, he gets to defend as normal."

Nerai miss defence.

TidesGM says, "What's damage for a slam?"

Ezra says, "(HP x hexes moved) / 100 dice. if that is a fraction, tell me the fractional value and I'll give you dice"

TidesGM says, "50/100."

Ezra says, "1d of damage."

TidesGM says, "Oh wait, HP."

TidesGM says, "75/100."

Ezra says, "still 1d."

Ezra says, "And Foo does damage to you in turn."

TidesGM says, "Interesting. Well, we found out."

Ezra says, "which should be (HP 10 \* 5), so 1d. He rolls that now"

Saeren says, "Kagarn will need to heal himself after this :D"

TidesGM says, "Ah, now I get what slam is."

Saeren says, "Slam is like ramming into something."

Ezra says, "yes"

TidesGM says, "Slam is something big guy does to little guy because he has an advantage in the calculation."

Saeren says, "Think of the old Roman ships and 'RAMMING SPEED!' and a bunch of slaves about to sink n.n"

Saeren says, "I gotta look into slam attacks with my paper dragon o.o"

Ezra checks Nerai for 1d damage roll

Saeren says, "He may be lamenting the likely loss of the poor f00"

Nerai thought Mike was gonna roll, sorry.

Saeren says, "Nice attack, though."

Ezra says, "okay. Kagarn takes this damage in return, minus his DR."

Nerai is dead nao?

Nerai isn't sure how that works in GURPS.

Saeren doubts it.

Saeren says, "Probably get to -HT or something"

Nerai probably needs to make HT-4 or something.

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "wounded and barely conscious but still up"

Nerai says, "Ah"

Saeren says, "Does he have to roll again?"

Ezra says, "on his turn, yes."

Saeren says, "Ah."

Saeren says, "Imp is up I think. :)"

Ezra says, "so Kagarn takes like 1 point or something, did 4, well done :D"

Ezra says, "Imp acts."

Saeren says, "He will start to aim at the incoming F00"

Ezra says, "okay. Imp aims at FOO 2."

Ezra says, "next round. FOO: roll HT or fall over"

Saeren says, "Yay."

Saeren says, "Does he ever get penalties on that roll?"

Ezra says, "no"

Saeren says, "When does he out-right die? -HT?"

Ezra says, "he risks death (that is, rolls every turn) at -HP"

Ezra says, "automatic death, no recourse, do not pass go, do not collect $200, is at -(5 \* HP)"

Nerai hmms.

Saeren says, "Wow, that takes a damn long time to kill someone n.n"

Ezra says, "that's for heroes. The GM can just rule that scrubs die at -HP and call it a day."

Nerai will fail HT eventually.

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "okay. you can now act at -4 on Foo"

Nerai says, "FOO2 Aim action"

Ezra says, "aim at who?"

Nerai says, "FOO All out attack against Warlock.. double attack."

Nerai says, "Shaman"

Saeren says, "backing up."

Ezra says, "okay. roll em"

Nerai says, "Hit once."

Nerai says, "I think.. I'm at -4 is all? "

Ezra says, "yes"

Saeren says, "Parrying with move at 15."

Nerai fails.

Ezra says, "critical success on defense, so hahaha."

Nerai says, "??"

Saeren says, "I parry so well that the very fabric of the universe rips and poop falls on my head."

TidesGM says, "..."

Ezra says, "Alright. Both Foos have acted. Warlock?"

Nerai says, "DOes that do anything?"

Saeren says, "Crit success on defense does jack."

Saeren says, "but I'm not hit"

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "nothing super relevant here, it's just nice."

Saeren says, "I'm going to just clobber him with my stick."

Nerai has no defense.

Saeren says, "I hit."

Ezra says, "(to be specific, he gets no defense since he used an All-Out Attack)"

Saeren throws damage out :)

Saeren adds to the fun. n.n

Nerai says, "DO I roll HT again?"

Saeren says, "On your turn."

Nerai says, "Or is that just when dropping below 1 HP?"

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "At the start of your turn, I'll tell you when"

Nerai says, "OK."

Saeren says, "Basically you are a pinata."

Ezra says, "but you're at another -4 on your next turn because of this damage."

Ezra says, "Shaman is up"

Saeren says, "Hint: don't bother hitting the pinata."

TidesGM says, "Foo1 seems well in hand. Turning round and trying to cast Lightning again."

Nerai says, "SO, -8 total, assuming I don't get 2 more points of damage or whatever."

Ezra says, "okay. how much energy?"

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "no - you're at -4."

TidesGM says, "1 point, max I can do with my given PI."

Nerai says, "Oh"

TidesGM says, "Let's do that again."

Ezra says, "okay, spell is ready."

Ezra says, "imp"

Saeren says, "I imagine my modifier is horrible.. does continued aiming keep adding?"

Ezra says, "it adds a further +1, no more than (Accuracy+3) possible."

Saeren says, "So I'm at -3 right now"

Ezra says, "ok"

Saeren says, "What the heck, I'll shoot."

Ezra says, "the bonus starts at your Accuracy, which should be 3?"

Saeren says, "Hm?"

Ezra says, "for Innate Attack?"

Ezra says, "it should have an Acc of 3."

Saeren says, "Oh, right ^^"

Ezra says, "so you get that on your first turn of aiming. on your second, you'd get 3+1 or 4."

Saeren says, "Ahhh"

Ezra says, "on the third, 3+1+1 or 5."

Saeren says, "So that means I made it."

Saeren says, "Skill is 15."

Ezra says, "okay. Defense?"

Saeren says, "by 2, I think."

Nerai fails to dodge.

Saeren says, "Hahaha, imp got no game."

Nerai says, "9"

Ezra says, "okay. imp hits FOO 2 for 1 HP"

Ezra says, "foo and foo2 now act."

Saeren says, "C'mon bad roll for f00"

Saeren says, "Nuts."

Nerai says, "DOes the -4 apply to my HT roll?"

Ezra says, "no."

Nerai says, "Phew"

Saeren says, "This guy is a scrapper!"

Nerai says, "Foo2 will throw this turn, at -3, if I'm not mistaken..."

Nerai waits for confirmation?

Ezra says, "Throw against who?"

Ezra says, "oh, shaman duh"

Nerai says, "Shaman."

Nerai says, "-5 for range -2 acc"

Ezra says, "yeah, that's correct."

Nerai says, "er +2 aim"

Nerai miiiisssss

Nerai says, "Step anyway..."

Ezra says, "okay. Kagarn acquires a new spear for his collection."

Saeren says, "foo is dancing about."

Nerai says, "Step and attack Warlock. All out attack again, double again."

Saeren says, "same thing, fall back, parry."

Nerai says, "They should both hit...."

Saeren says, "Is there a penalty to double parry?"

Ezra says, "no, just roll it twice."

Saeren says, "Made both."

Nerai misssss

TidesGM says, "wow, what kind of parry do you have?"

TidesGM says, "Oh right, retreating."

Saeren says, "And staff is +2"

Saeren says, "My skill outright is 14."

Ezra says, "here's a hint: the reason you always see fencers in movies backing away from each other or lunging forward? it's this shit :)"

Saeren says, "I pumped a ton in it, thinking only of its necessity in landing deathtouch."

Saeren says, "I wasn't aware of how ridiculously powerful it was in defense."

Ezra says, "Alright. warlock is up"

Saeren says, "I have a question.. maybe for later. How the hell does anyone beat my defense?"

Ezra \[to Saeren\]: "they can use Feint. they can use Deceptive Attacks (if they have high enough skill). they can use a heavy weapon (like a Slam attack!) and simply try to break your staff through force."

Saeren says, "Ah :)"

Ezra says, "For example, if Kagarn Slammed you and you opted to parry, your staff would probably break"

Nerai says, "Or just try and let statistics catch up with youre dice rolling ability."

Nerai says, "Also, they don't list a Main Gauche in the GURPS book. :("

Saeren says, "I'm going to prep fireball for 1d and no fatigue."

Saeren says, "Not sure if I name my target now.. it's the distant guy."

Ezra says, "FOO 2"

Saeren says, "Right, f00 2"

Saeren says, "So kagarn is up."

TidesGM says, "As far as I can tell, you don't need to name a target for a missile until you start aiming?"

Ezra says, "correct"

TidesGM says, "I'm gonna drop another point of fatigue into the missile I'm chargin. No new skill roll?"

Ezra \[to TidesGM\]: "no roll required, you just do it"

Saeren says, "imp is gonna innate attack f00 to keep that -4 going."

TidesGM says, "OK, so chargin up. gonna stay put where I am."

Saeren says, "That's a hit."

Ezra says, "okay. Foo defends?"

Nerai says, "Foo does not."

Ezra says, "okay, do damage"

Nerai says, "(aoa again)"

Ezra nods

Saeren says, "Oh, is his defense at -4 assuming he doesn't double attack?"

Ezra says, "his defense is not penalized because he doesn't get a defense at all."

Nerai says, "Nevar."

Saeren adds 4 more points of burn.

Nerai says, "Also, I'm dead."

Saeren says, "Not yet."

Ezra says, "Foo is at -HP. For our purposes we'll say he's dead"

Saeren says, "Unless you are mook dead at -HT by rule n.n"

Nerai assumes she qualified as a mook

Saeren patpats mook.

Ezra says, "FOO 3 has spawned!"

Nerai did pretty good at 25 vs 300. XD

TidesGM says, "So here comes the next mook."

Saeren says, "300? :P"

Nerai says, "Or whatever points you guys are at."

Saeren says, "150 n.n"

Nerai says, "Each"

Ezra says, "imp acted, so Foo 2 and 3 now act."

Nerai says, "Is there anythign I can do to disrupt the AIM?"

Nerai says, "I assume run out of LOS, which doesn't seem to be an option.."

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "you can find physical cover or otherwise be unseen."

Ezra says, "Yeah, there's not a lot of actual cover here - this is deliberate, because of the oncoming wave of FOOs."

Nerai chaerg.

TidesGM says, "Reg!"

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "you can also drop as part of your defense. it's just like retreating, except you drop prone instead of stepping back. The downside is that you must then spend an action to stand up"

Saeren says, "So I'm at -4.. gonna aim. What's my accuracy with a spell?"

Ezra says, "with which spell? fireball? +1"

Saeren says, "Ah, that's low.. hm."

TidesGM says, "Probably better to just come closer?"

Nerai says, "Fireball seems more like magic missle in this case. :)"

Saeren says, "I want to let go of fireball and prep deathtouch instead, I think."

Ezra says, "you can dissipate the spell as a free action"

Nerai idle for booze.

Saeren says, "And prep the other this turn?"

Ezra says, "you could also chuck it and hope you were lucky"

Ezra says, "yes"

Saeren says, "I could, but I want to be ready when they come in range. :)"

TidesGM says, "Where's the range modifier table?"

Saeren says, "page 550"

Ezra says, "it's on the character sheet at the back of Characters, or p. 550 or so in Campaigns"

Saeren says, "campaigns."

Saeren says, "I'm going to put 1 point into deathtouch again :)"

Ezra says, "roll it"

Saeren says, "Made it by 3."

Nerai says, "I think GURPS tables might become a storybook module...."

TidesGM says, "Okay, there we go. So I'm gonna Aim my lightnin at Foo2."

Ezra says, "okay, the spell is charged up"

Ezra says, "okay, LB has an Acc of +3"

Saeren says, "oh, and I can step, right?"

TidesGM says, "(next turn)."

TidesGM can step. won't.

Ezra \[to Saeren\]: "yes, you can step and concentrate"

Ezra says, "imp?"

TidesGM says, "3-foot step!"

Saeren says, "There we go."

Saeren says, "imp is gonna chuck fire."

Saeren says, "does that guy have any cover?"

Ezra says, "nooot really."

Ezra says, "cover is in the 201 class"

Saeren says, "okay n.n"

Ezra says, "foo 2 can defend"

Saeren says, "Success over the penalty"

TidesGM says, "So this raid instance doesn't have any way for the tank to do a ranged pull."

Saeren says, "nice d"

Nerai is like greased lighning.

TidesGM says, "Man, Foo2's just as much of a ninja as his fallen brother."

Ezra \[to TidesGM\]: "tank taunts is pretty much a function of the Intimidate skill, or a specialized power for it"

Saeren says, "Hopefully that means he ignites easily."

Ezra says, "okay. Foo 2 and 3 are up"

TidesGM \[to Ezra\]: "yeah, but he can't corner pull ranged mobs into melee, is my point."

Nerai says, "Is my Spear here? Can I pick it up (Next round with a parry action?)"

Ezra says, "well if you're around a corner, ranged can either sit there and beat off, or follow :)"

Nerai would like to move to where the spear is, anyway.

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "you can grab spear next turn."

TidesGM says, "Yes. If there were corners."

Nerai says, "A Ready action, not a parry action, duh."

Nerai says, "Okay. Move action."

Ezra nods

Nerai says, "Done"

Ezra says, "okay. warlock"

Saeren says, "Well, let's see... not quite in my attack range yet."

TidesGM says, "Now don't _you_ try slamming, squishy. :)"

TidesGM says, "That's for big beefy tauren."

Nerai says, "Or mooks who are into self-sacrifice."

Saeren says, "So my reach is 2.. I don't think I can step 2 and attack at full dice."

Saeren says, "So I will move by 1 and.. can I aim?"

Ezra says, "tauren are awesome for slams. ST 4 and a further +1 HP means 50% better damage than a typical human"

Ezra \[to Saeren\]: "yes"

Saeren says, "Okay, aiming."

Saeren says, "Got nothing else to do with this turn ^^"

Ezra says, "the specific maneuver you want is called Evaluate in melee"

TidesGM says, "Or for Bolvar Fordragon who's got like DR6 on his armor and probably 18 ST and HP bought up past that."

TidesGM says, "All right. I've got a 2-point lightnin bolt, Aim bought, my target is within 2 yards so no range penalty... I think it's time to get zappin."

Ezra says, "So actually you can only evaluate if you COULD step into range with the target."

Ezra says, "if your quarterstaff reach is 2, that qualifies"

Nerai says, "SHe can, tho."

Saeren says, "It is."

Ezra \[to TidesGM\]: "okay, go for it"

TidesGM says, "effective innate attack skill of 15."

Ezra says, "Critical hit, no defense."

Nerai says, "Oh, my bad."

Ezra says, "do your damage"

Nerai tried to ninja anyway

Saeren says, "That's gonna leave a mark."

Ezra says, "roll that again >\_<"

Saeren says, "Wow."

Ezra o.o v

Nerai staggers at -1

Ezra says, "Foo 2 is now down 11 HP by my count."

Saeren says, "He's probably in stun land."

TidesGM says, "So HT-5 or be stunned."

Nerai says, "Pretty lights."

Nerai says, "11"

Ezra says, "So yeah, Zot."

Saeren says, "Stunned and me with a deathtouch n.n"

Ezra says, "imp is up."

Saeren says, "Fireball into the amazing star gazer."

Nerai says, "Nuuuuuu"

Ezra says, "critical hit, do damage"

Nerai says, "-4"

TidesGM says, "Kagarn is the plate killer. Metal armor is treated as DR 1 vs. Lightning."

Ezra says, "foo 2 is up - and stunned, which is one of those rare special cases where defense is penalized. Roll HT or keel over"

Saeren says, "Bah n.n"

TidesGM says, "He's gonna need a new spell for underwater, though, unless he wants to shock himself and everyone around him."

Nerai is still standing.

Saeren . o O ( Yeah, yeah, yeaaaah! )

Ezra says, "FOOs 4 and 5 have spawned and may act this turn."

TidesGM says, "dammit."

Nerai says, "Okay. "

Nerai is done.

Ezra says, "warlock"

Ezra says, "ohwait"

Saeren says, "Hmm?"

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "what is foo 2 gonna do"

Nerai says, "Be stunned?"

Ezra says, "good. :D"

Ezra says, "warloc"

Saeren says, "Seems like a good approach."

Saeren says, "Step and pinata."

Saeren says, "Hit by plenty. I think pinata is going to suffer n.n"

Ezra says, "defend at -4"

Nerai says, "Yeah, no"

Saeren says, "That's gonna leave a mark."

Nerai says, "Splat."

Ezra says, "pretty sure he's past -HP so yeah, scrub death"

TidesGM says, "I've already learned one thing. Make sure your key attack spells are at 15 skill."

Saeren says, "Yep."

Ezra says, "shaman?"

Saeren says, "Or higher. You got an aoe move? :P"

TidesGM says, "Might as well try for another lightning."

TidesGM says, "no AOE here."

Ezra says, "okay, you have a 1d LB on tap."

Ezra says, "imp."

Saeren says, "Aiming at foo3."

Nerai says, "With?"

Saeren says, "The only thing he has, innate attack."

Ezra says, "the imp's fireball thingie"

Ezra says, "FOO brigade is up"

Nerai says, "Oh, it's 50/100, nmind"

Saeren says, "nice. Hahah"

Ezra says, "warlock"

Saeren says, "I didn't even know you could move them like that."

Ezra says, "(unless you are gonna chuck spears)"

Nerai says, "Yeah no"

Nerai says, "I'm out of range anyway"

TidesGM says, "At this point, though, the imps got a -6 range penalty to hit. Innate attack starts out at Acc 3, though, so he's at -3 now."

Ezra says, "okay. warlock?"

Saeren says, "Hmm.."

Saeren says, "Gonna prep explosive fireball for 4 points."

Ezra says, "roll em"

Saeren says, "or wait, reading this to make sure I understand what I'm doing.."

Saeren says, "I guess this would take 2 second to prep at that level."

Saeren says, "Just 2 points."

Saeren says, "I made it by 3"

Ezra says, "it's 2 energy per 1d. You can put up to 6 energy in per turn (any amount up to twice your magery...)"

Saeren says, "ohhh"

Saeren says, "than I'll use 4 :)"

Saeren says, "I thought I had to sit there and charge longer :)"

Ezra says, "okay, you have it. Shaman?"

Saeren says, "oh, and one step.. i keep forgetting that ><"

TidesGM says, "Charging my lightning"

Ezra says, "building up another 1d?"

TidesGM says, "Yeah."

Ezra says, "imp?"

TidesGM says, "Currently at 6/12 FP."

TidesGM says, "innervate plz."

TidesGM says, "(I'm joking. no one with any sense innervates the elemental shammy.)"

Saeren says, "sorry."

Saeren says, "I'm at +3 right now.. they are still too far."

Saeren says, "Gonna aim again.. I think I can get +4 :)"

Ezra says, "you cap at Acc+3"

Saeren says, "okay, adding on"

Ezra says, "sorry - I rechecked. You cap at aim+2"

Saeren says, "same result, aiming more. :)"

Ezra says, "okay. FOO brigade."

Nerai says, "Foo 5 is going to pull out his AK-74. and lay down surpressive fire."

Ezra says, "FOO 5 dies horribly in an inexplicable gastronomic accident."

Nerai says, "Sorry, they move."

TidesGM says, "Man, I've had chili like that."

Ezra says, "okay. warlock?"

Saeren says, "Hmm, 10 yards.."

Saeren says, "Gonna step back and aim one turn."

Ezra says, "shaman?"

Nerai says, "Yes, please step into effective spear range."

Saeren says, "Actually, I need to declare what I'm aiming for, don't I?"

Ezra says, "yes"

Ezra is assuming foo3 (the center one) by default?

Saeren says, "changing tactics, in that case.. I can't just say 'aiming for the ground'"

Saeren says, "so it's better to use this thing now."

Saeren says, "+4 aim modifier for targetting the ground under foo 3"

Saeren says, "so it's at +/- 0"

Saeren says, "hit it. all within 1 yard take 2d6.. not sure if they can do anything effective defense wise."

Ezra says, "they can dive for cover (I'm treating this as a basic dodge)"

Saeren says, "how far can they dive?"

Ezra says, "1 yard"

Saeren says, "They will still take some damage.. let me figure that while they roll"

Nerai says, "One missed, the other two make it."

Ezra says, "okay. I assume Foo 3, 4 and 5 in that order?"

Saeren says, "Okay, damage is divided by 3 \* distance in yards."

Saeren says, "rolling total to figure out what that means now"

Ezra says, "so foo 3 and foo 5 takes that: the first two because they dodged, the third because he was that far to begin with."

Ezra says, "foo 4 dodged and was 1 yard away anyway, so he takes /6 damage"

Nerai says, "So, they all take 3?"

Saeren says, "1 damage to the one who dodge, 9 to all others."

Ezra says, "err"

Saeren says, "I think?"

Ezra says, "two dodged, one missed."

Ezra says, "So Foo 3 and Foo 5 take 3 HP. Foo 4 takes 1 (9/6 but I'll round up)"

Saeren says, "Ah.. wow. That spell kinda stinks ^^"

Ezra says, "you put in a relatively minor 2d of damage"

Saeren says, "Dodge slaughters it, and it's fatigue cost is pretty high for poor results. Gonna have to put that on the ain't no thang list n.n"

Nerai says, "What do you mean it stinks? You ust did 10 total damage? .\_."

Ezra says, "okay. shaman?"

Saeren says, "For 4 fatigue, Nerai. It's a horrible return."

Ezra says, "I'll do the math after Mike declares his action, if you guys want to see an actual DPS calculation :)"

TidesGM says, "Hm... gonna go ahead and Aim at Foo 3."

Ezra says, "roger."

Saeren says, "Don't need to. All I need to know is deathtouch is this character's most potent offense against these kind of foes."

Ezra says, "Alright. Here is how things break down:"

Saeren says, "I'm sure other situations make explosive effective."

Ezra says, "(right, I'm not going to attempt to prove that EF is awesome, but I AM going to show you guys the factors that feed into magical DPS)"

Saeren says, "Go for it"

Ezra says, "ranged magical damage is a function of how fast you can charge up a Missile spell (your Magery or Power Investiture), and how accurate the missile will be once you fire it (your Innate Attack skill)"

Ezra says, "An enemy unit can mitigate damage with good defenses (like dodging, and particularly dropping prone if he knows a mage is chucking a 9d fireball at him)."

Ezra says, "Missile spells ARE generally affected by armor's DR."

Ezra says, "Different damage types are also relevant. For example, a fireball does burning damage. If you fired that at the ground where there's flammable stuff, it WILL go up, and the guys you attacked WILL have to deal with that."

Ezra says, "'but why should I care? they will just move past it'. Well yes. And when you melee them and they try to Retreat back into it?"

Ezra says, "Also pay attention to what you guys are chucking. Reggie's fireball is large and deadly to groups but can be evaded. Kagarn's lightning bolt is slower BUT IT CAN STUN. And stunned characters are at -4 to defend vs. a monster fireball."

Ezra says, "make sense?"

TidesGM says, "Lightning bolt is also a smidgen weaker: 1d-1 rather than 1d. but there's the stun."

Saeren nods.

TidesGM says, "Okay. So Kagarn just used Aim. Imp?"

Ezra says, "yeah, imp"

Saeren says, "Okay, I am at +4.. hm"

Ezra says, "currently aiming at foo 3?"

Saeren says, "Yeah, gonna fire at him."

Saeren says, "Hit"

Nerai ninja'd

Ezra says, "in the 201 course you guys will learn more about postures."

Ezra says, "for example, these guys dove for cover. which means they're now on the ground."

Nerai says, "Oh."

Nerai Hrm.

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "So these three guys...."

Ezra says, "oh I'm sorry. if you didn't want to dive for cover, I'd say:"

Ezra says, "So these two guys...."

Ezra says, "it's fine, we are learning :)"

Ezra says, "So your choices are: get up (takes a couple of actions), or crawl"

Nerai says, "Naw, that's fine."

Saeren says, "kneel before Zod!"

Nerai says, "They will all stand."

Ezra says, "they'll crouch anyway ;)"

Nerai says, "Oh yes?"

Ezra says, "standing is next action"

Nerai says, "Can they throw spears while crouched?"

Ezra says, "yes"

Nerai says, "Awesome."

Ezra says, "(next action)"

Ezra says, "Warlock"

Ezra says, "the FOO trio that hit the deck earlier is now rising to their feet."

Saeren says, "Hmm.."

Saeren says, "Okay, I'll just prep a freebie fireball at 1d."

Saeren says, "Not gonna burn through fatigue as wildly now ^^;;"

Ezra says, "okay, roll"

Nerai says, "ALso I think another lession here is that Spell casters need FP. :)"

Saeren says, "Sorry, was away.. that's by one"

Ezra says, "okay. shaman?"

Nerai does not dodge.

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "that's the cast, not the attack"

Nerai says, "Oh. Heh"

Nerai says, "WHat sort of penalty do I take from crouching anyway?"

TidesGM says, "THIS is an attack. I've got Aim on #3, and these guys appear to be ready to throw spears, so I'll take the net -1 to my skill."

Ezra says, "I'm not gonna worry about it right now. there is one, but we're trying to stay focused"

Ezra \[to TidesGM\]: "crit, no defense"

Ezra says, "rooooll that agaiiiiiiin"

Nerai says, "2: 4 4:9 5:7"

Saeren says, "2 is dead"

Ezra says, "Foo 3 should be down 8 HP"

Nerai says, "Well, 3 should be at 2"

Saeren grins

Nerai says, "2:2 4:9 5:7"

TidesGM says, "And now roll HT-2 vs. stun."

Nerai is stunned.

TidesGM says, "Shocking."

Saeren says, "I think the ninjas are having ht trouble now"

Ezra says, "imp is up"

Saeren says, "attack against 3"

Saeren says, "Hit."

Ezra says, "Stun imposes -4 on defenses"

Saeren says, "Yeah, they aren't well statted n.n"

Nerai miss anyway

Nerai says, "1"

Saeren says, "Imp is hillariously horrible."

Ezra says, "okay. FOO brigade can stand this round, or chuck spears, or whatever"

Nerai says, "Foo 5 aim at Shaman. Foo 4 and 3 stand"

Saeren says, "can you use acrobatics to do a rolling dodge that doesn't put your prone?"

Ezra says, "acrobatics boosts your dodge. It won't keep you from going prone when avoiding AoEs, but it does let you stand up in 1 turn"

Saeren says, "Ah, cool."

Ezra says, "okay. warlock"

Saeren says, "I will aim one turn to get +3 to hit I think."

Ezra says, "with fireball?"

Ezra says, "acc is 1"

Saeren says, "Ahh, okay.. well, might as well aim a bit more anyway :)"

Ezra says, "aim at who"

Saeren says, "Lucky #3 n.n"

Nerai says, "So, can you buy extra acc in spells like you can in advantages?"

Ezra says, "individual spells have a fixed Acc."

Nerai says, "'k"

Ezra says, "People who pay points for an Innate Attack can buy up the Acc of that attack for points."

Nerai nods.

Ezra says, "okay. shaman?"

TidesGM says, "hm."

TidesGM says, "hell with it, new lightning bolt attempt"

Ezra \[to Nerai\]: "so #3 was still stunned, right? Did I ask you to roll HT to recover?"

Nerai says, "THat's still this round, right?"

Ezra says, "yes, still this round"

Nerai says, "So, I think no"

TidesGM says, "Do you do your HT roll on your turn?"

Ezra says, "at the end of your turn"

Ezra says, "so go ahead and roll HT now, I missed"

Nerai succeeds

Nerai says, "He's probably still crouched, tho, in fact."

Ezra says, "yes, since you can't act (even to move) when stunned"

TidesGM says, "anyway. shaman now has another 1d lightning bolt prepped. Imp's turn."

Ezra nods

Saeren says, "Okay, I will chuck an innate attack"

Saeren says, "Misssss"

Ezra says, "critical failure. imp's ability is burned out temporarily"

Ezra says, "FOO brigade"

Nerai says, "HT roll to overcome stun"

Ezra says, "er, you rolled an 8 right?"

Nerai says, "Wait, he made it already"

Saeren says, "And nobody really noticed the lack of 1 damage per 3 rounds."

Nerai says, "I'm dum"

Nerai says, "3 stands, drops his spear on teh ground"

Nerai says, "4 advances"

Nerai says, "5 executed his attack."

Nerai says, "ANd misses."

Ezra says, "okay. warlock?"

Saeren says, "I'm at +1 right now, I think.. with -4 due to distance."

Saeren says, "With my skill as bad as it is I'm not sure those are good odds. I'm going to aim again."

Nerai says, "Plus he'll probably advance next round."

Ezra says, "okay. s haman?"

TidesGM says, "Aim at 3."

Ezra says, "for another turn, ok"

Ezra says, "imp is disoriented this turn but will be back in action next round"

TidesGM says, "wait, Last round I'm pretty sure I just started my Lightning..."

Ezra says, "oh yes, my notes are wrong."

Ezra says, "there we go."

Saeren says, "Imp is spinning in circles. :D"

Ezra says, "okay. imp will get to go next turn."

Ezra says, "FOO brigade?"

TidesGM says, "aaand I changed my mind. I wanted to aim at 4. sorry, I missed that 4 moved."

Nerai says, "3 & 4 move, 5 steps, and ready action to pick up the spear dropped by 3"

Ezra says, "if it's just a step, you have the thing now and can use it next round"

Ezra says, "warlock?"

Saeren says, "Gonna fireball #3"

Nerai says, "Yeah, that's the idea."

Ezra says, "ok"

Saeren says, "That's a hit. I think exactly a hit"

Ezra says, "3 should have his defense back"

Nerai says, "Yeah, but his mojo ain't workin"

Saeren says, "Neither is mine."

Saeren says, "but I think that's 0 now."

Nerai says, "3 is at exactly 0 mow"

Ezra says, "yeah"

Ezra says, "shaman?"

TidesGM says, "Firing off my 1d bolt at #4."

TidesGM says, "That's a hit."

Saeren says, "My fireball is more like being attacked with a bic lighter n.n"

Nerai says, "He fails to dodge too"

TidesGM says, "HT-1 or be stunned."

Nerai says, "He should be at 4 now."

TidesGM says, "(I'm assuming round down)."

Ezra says, "yeah"

Nerai says, "Stud"

Saeren says, "ninja mobs have totally lost the dice."

Ezra says, "imp?"

Nerai says, "Statistics catch up with everyone eventually."

Saeren says, "Fire at the nearest target"

Saeren says, "step first"

Saeren says, "Hit by a bunch"

Saeren says, "That's 4, sorry :)"

Saeren says, "defense, natch."

Nerai says, "Misssssssss"

Nerai says, "-1"

Saeren says, "Wow, imp is angry."

Ezra says, "I show FOO 4 as down by 9 HP, what did I miss?"

Nerai says, "3 stay awake"

Nerai says, "Nighty night."

Saeren says, "Naptime for 3 n.n"

Nerai says, "Er... 1 + 4 + 5?"

Ezra says, "ok"

Saeren says, "Our mooks are complicated."

Nerai says, "Either way they both fall down and spend their action bleeding."

Nerai says, "Foo 5 aims at Warlock."

Saeren says, "It's important to have hobbies."

Saeren uses Kagarn as cover.

Ezra says, "okay. warlock?"

Saeren says, "Gonna prep fireball at the free fatigue level."

Saeren says, "And I succeed."

Ezra says, "shaman?"

TidesGM says, "Prepping lightning bolt."

TidesGM says, "whiff."

Ezra says, "imp?"

Saeren says, "throwing fire"

Saeren says, "oops"

Nerai says, "Stop moving my mook"

Saeren says, "Actually, I will aim instead."

Saeren says, "Sorry n.n"

Saeren says, "I was trying to place him more strategically :D"

Ezra says, "okay. FOo 5?"

Nerai says, "RUN"

Saeren says, "Ahahah, brave sir robyn, leaving his friends behind."

Nerai says, "Friends hell."

Nerai says, "They're all sleepy time."

Saeren says, "-5 at this range.. hm :D"

Ezra says, "okay. what you failed to realize was..."

Ezra says, "they still owe you money!"

Nerai says, "Also, he has no weapon."

Nerai says, "You mean you'd rather I charge blindly into PC damage?"

Nerai says, "I can do that too."

Saeren says, "He is a ninja, his greatest weapons are his mind and his best friend's body."
