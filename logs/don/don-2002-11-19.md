# Dead of Night 2002-11-19

OHSU - Oregon Health and Science University. It's a school and a hospital all rolled into one. It's a scant few minutes from the heart of downtown Portland and equipped with one of the best burn wards in the area. Fortunate, for so many have been burned.

The wreckage of a local bus, vaulting off a bridge and onto the light-rail train passing below, managed to catch fire. In the conflagration, many were killed almost instantly. Many more died, or are dying now, of smoke inhalation. Among them are the driver of the bus, and a student aboard, himself attending classes at the university.

Light. It hurts the eyes, blinding with the radiance of the Second Coming and burning with the memory of fire licking at tender flesh. A brilliant glare, beating down and assaulting the fragile retina, that nevertheless resolves itself into the overhead lights of the trauma ward. Bed. The soft feel of white covers, the tortured cacophony of noise that's nevertheless only the sound of sheets rubbing skin. Other people, other voices, so far away... a rushing feeling, like a man driven to the surface of the sea after nearly drowning. Wakefulness.

Garfield gasps and chokes and tries feebly to bat away the blinding light. Cobwebs fill his head -- the last jagged bits of his memory refuse to fit together. "Christ... Jesus Christ. What the hell was I drinking last night?"

And then he remembers -- Coke. That's it, nothing more. And he remembers the crane....

Garfield does his best to sit up. "Can't be-- Doctor? Nurse!"

Edward's got a test due! Shit, his work work... work... Urf... He squints, closes his eyes, lifts a hand to shield the light. He feels like shit. Rested shit, but still the same horrible mucky feeling. What the hell hit him? "Someone turn the damned light off..." He tries to cover his eyes. Did he fall asleep on the bus again? He peers out the side of a hand, to see what's going on.

The sound of footsteps - Edward hears the call for an attendant, only a few beds away. One of the white-coated sentinels standing about jogs over, holding a clipboard. Brown hair, glasses, a ready smile. "Mr. Garfield.." The doctor's attention turns at the motion. "Well, we have two of you awake, I see," he says. His eyes are cold and distant, rebelling against the events that brought about the two here, but his voice is all welcome.

Garfield says, "Tell me I'm remembering it wrong. Please!"

Craning his neck, Garfield tries to catch a glimpse of another bed's occupant.

Edward attempts to sit up. Argh, side aches... He lays back down. Hands grope over his body. Okay, so nothing's Missing...

The doctor blinks for a moment, then consults his clipboard briefly. "Mr. Garfield... there may be some memory loss, but.. there was an accident. I want you to remain calm, and get some rest. You're not seriously injured."

"Accident?" Croaks out Edward.

Garfield says, "Accident?" He shakes his head, stops as pain surges. "The crane-- It wasn't me! The goddamn crane--!"

Quickly the doctor holds up a reassuring hand. "Mr. Garfield, don't worry about it! I'm not familiar with the circumstances but I am told there are plenty of witnesses to the incident." He turns with a smile to the only other patient awake. "Mr.. Banders?" he half-asks with a brief glance at his clipboard. "You were involved in an accident. The same one as Mr. Garfield here. But everything's going to be fine - just a little recuperation."

Garfield chokes down an urge to vomit. "How... how bad?," he whispers.

Dazzling white teeth flash as the doctor smiles. "Let yourself rest now, Mr. Garfield," he advises levelly. "You'll be yourself again in no time."

Edward lifts a hand to rub his face. Ugh. Beautiful. He has a paper due... Hopefully this can garner some sympathy from that teacher. It's not every day you're thrown into the hospital. "Did I break anything? Bruise? I can't feel anything immediately, but that can be just as bad a sign..."

Garfield falls back and stares at the ceiling. His head shakes slowly in mute negation.

Moving down the row of beds a few feet, the doctor once again consults the holy writ of the Chart. "A few bruises.. mostly you were banged up," he smiles, looking down at Edward. "Nothing broken, nothing sprained. Just a day or so for observation and you'll be back out and about."

"Grand..." Atleast Edward will get some sleep, right? Hospitals are known for putting you out. That'll be good...

Garfield pricks his ears up at that. If he's not seriously hurt, and that other guy's also okay, it really can't be that bad. Can it...?

Edward relaxes back into his bed, and settles in. One thought does occur to him. The dreaded Bedpan. Unless he can fight them to let him go to the privy on his own.

Meanwhile, in another part of the hospital, the clock seems to have crawled to a standstill: 4:45 pm. The second hand's interminable sweep seems to be the only thing moving in this examination cell. Beyond, the sound of a student consulting in quiet tones with someone else - a doctor, a fellow student, a stranger - is all that disturbs Drake's solitude. Bereft of shirt and feeling the residual sensations of half a dozen basic tests on his skin, all that's left to do is wait for his examiner's return. And deal with the twinges of pain which have grown progressively stronger.

Drake winces. The ache in his back isn't the only thing that hurts. He was too free with the liquor last night. He didn't take any pain killers, however, just in case that might futz the examination. He reaches back, absently touching at the scarring where he can. Buckshot. Part of the reason he wears a leather jacket these days...not as effective as kevlar, but better than nothing. He remembers how he got it, too. It was how Leo tried to put him down. And even now, long after he evened the score, it still hurts. His fingers twitch, and he reaches into his pocket and takes out his gold zippo, flicking and flipping it idly without actually trying to create a flame. _What's taking so long?_

The rising voice of the student outside answers the question in part - "But it looks like..." And here, some obscure suggestion causes the student's voice to subside back into a murmuring buzz. After a few moments, the boy returns with a wary smile. "Right, we're... we're going to proscribe .... here." He thrusts out a piece of paper, waits only for its receipt into Drake's hands, then wheels and almost runs out of the room.

Drake fights the urge to smile. Especially since a scared student doesn't mean a cowed student. He eyes the prescription curiously as he grabs his shirt.

And down at the pharmacy, the smiling woman who stands ready at the desk takes a look at the prescription. A few moments of typing at her computer commence, and flashing eyes begin to look doubtful as they peruse whatever hidden message the glowing box is relaying. At length she looks up again, all smiles. "It looks like Dr. Baumgartner realized your examiner made a ah, mistake. Please report to him in Outpatient?"

Drake looks at the woman steadily. He's still tense from the night before. "What sort of mistake?" he says, not threatening, not yet. He's thankful he doesn't go anywhere without his gun, even though that meant he had to hide it from the kid in his jacket when he stripped.

The pharmacist gives a helpless shrug. "I'm sure the doctor will be happy to explain. It's nothing at all that requires immediate attention, sir."

Drake taps his fingers on the counter. His trigger finger itches. But he smiles, and the attempt to look warm is somehow wrong on his face. "Right. Outpatient." He promptly heads there.

Dr. Baumgartner is easy to find - white haired, with a bushy mustache and florid face. He talks like a man who gargles with gravel but he looks friendly and open enough. Recognition on his part is immediate, and he steps out of his office and into the hall. "Sorry about that," he mumbles. "Nervous cases aren't the easiest to diagnose. The medicine you were prescribed has side-effects, so what I'd like to do is put you under observation for the evening, on pain-killers. Don't worry about cost," he adds, holding up a warding hand and smiles. "Nothing's gonna be added to your bill."

Drake tilts his head at the doctor. "i'm not sure I understand. Why give me a medecine that has side effects? Why not just prescribe something different?" he asks flatly. He doesn't exactly want to stay for observation by anyone. It increases the chance of someone IDing him.

Baumgartner's head tilts. "Because frankly, Mr. Watson, we thought that a few hours of dizziness would be less inconvenient for you than just putting you on morphine or something similar, which will treat the pain, but not the nervous tics you're suffering from."

Drake arches a brow. "I just came in for something for the pain. Are the nervous tics really all that important? I didn't even know you could treat that."

"Medicine is an ever-evolving science, Mr. Watson," the earthy doctor smiles. "Let us say that in a few years, if your situation was NOT treated, you would very much regret it. Fortunately, nervous disorders such as yours are easily dealt with. Come with me please." And he begins making his way down the hall, moving slowly enough to allow for a moment's consideration before catching up.

Drake watches the doctor. _Oh, what the hell. I'm not going to kill someone for just trying to do their job. Besides, then I wouldn't get what I came for. And he's not as much a prick as some doctors._ He follows.

Arriving in the ward - two rows of bed, in what looks almost like a high school gymnasium - Baumgartner greets his fellow practitioners of medicine, then indicates an empty bed. "Please make yourself comfortable here, Mr. Watson, and I'll take care of the administration in a moment," he directs.

Garfield says, "Hello? Doctor?"

Drake hesitates, and then takes off his jacket. He didn't bring his shoulder web, as that would be far too conspicuous, instead keeping his glock in an inside pocket. As he gets situated, however, he hides the gun under his pillow and lays down.

Edward eases up to peer down the rows of beds towards the doctor and the new applicant. _Huh. He looks pretty much under his own power... Probably has nothing to do with the accident._

Baumgartner - the visiting doctor - turns and regards the man in the bed near his assignment to Drake. "Yes sir?"

Garfield's voice is shaky. "Do you know anything about the accident? How many were hurt? I need to know-- I... I was driving. I need to know!"

Drake feels eyes on him...he tilts his head in Edward's direction and spots the younger man. His gaze isn't so much unfriendly as very..intense.

The white-haired doctor shakes his head. "I'm afraid I don't know.. so get some rest, hmm? There's plenty of time for questions later." And with that, he begins walking.

Edward doesn't pay Drake much heed, and instead pans off, towards the doctor and Garfield. A finger frets through the dark hair cropped about his neck. Thankfully the nurse hadn't lost his glasses, these pushed up onto his nose.

Garfield says, "But..." He starts to reach out toward the retreating figure, his expression forlorn, but stops, realizing the gesture is useless. His eyes stare down at the white sheets. He looks.... lost.

Drake, as Edward eyes him, appears to be in his late twenties, dressed in khahi slacks and a blue print button down shirt. He's taken his sneakers off, revealing white tube socks. He puts his arms behind his head as he goes back to watching the cielingm shaking a few strands of short black hair away from his face as he practices his dead-eyed stare at the ceiling with his grey pupils.

Garfield hestitantly glances up, not quite meeting anyone's eyes. The aging, chubby man normally rosy cheeks are pale, which turns them a ghastly pink colour. "I'm sorry," he whispers, to everyone and no one. His head falls again, and he shakes with quiet sobs.

Drake rolls his eyes. _Joy. I get to listen to someone whimper._

Eventually Baumgartner returns, a bottle of pills and a glass of water clutched in hand. He thrusts them out for inspection and acceptance. "Wash 'em down quick," he advises with a smile.

Drake smiles humorlessly back at him . "How many?"

Edward peers around. _Boring. Not a book in sight, the unfortunate fellow over there..._ Perhaps he can find some sleep, or earn some conversation out of the guy on the other side of his bed. The man looks in his early to mid twenties. Behind the glasses, those brown eyes often seem smaller, or more narrowed; pensive, sharp.

The doctor chuckles. "Take two every eight hours. There's only two in here, but we're leavin' you the bottle in case you need a refill tomorrow."

Drake nods. "Not to be taken with alcohol, I assume...but what about food?" he queries further as he takes the offered things.

Checking his watch, the white-maned doctor hums in answer. "We'll be serving dinner at six-thirty, so don't worry about it for now. They're safe with or without. Any other questions?"

_Alcohol?_ Garfield looks up at that. _A bottle, that's what I need...._

"Yeah. When do I get to leave?" Drake says after a moment.

"When the pain is gone and you aren't dizzy from the pills anymore," advises Baumgartner.

Garfield gets slowly out of bed. Like in a dream, he shuffles towards the closest exit.

Drake nods. "Anything specific I should worry about? Like, should I call the nurse if I start seeing carnivorous pink elephants?"

The bus driver is just as quickly noticed by the two doctors still standing on duty, and they move forward to intercept him.

Baumgartner laughs. "We've got doctors standing 24-hour watch in here, you just call one o' them if you need anything."

Edward watches the exchange with a bit of interest. A glance towards Drake. _Cute._

Drake shrugs. "Kay." He downs the first two pills swiftly.

Garfield says, "No, let me go. A drink, I've just gotta get a drink. A little one, I swear...."

Drake eyes the exchange between the doctors and the older guy in the flimsy gown. _I'd give you some of my Johnny Walker just to shut you up._

With gentle persuasion, and a bit of man-handling, the two men on duty guide Garfield back to his assigned bed. Both smile that friendly, hollow smile that means everything's okay as long as you don't know too much, and both return to their posts near the doors out of the ward.

Garfield curls up into a near-fetal position under the sheets and stares at a point a bit too far away to appear entirely healthy....

Edward hrms. That was relatively uneventful. A shrug, crossing arms behind his bed. _Six thirty, eh? Not too long away... I hope that guy over there doesn't snap._

Drake sighs as Garfield quiets, and he just lays back and relaxes, waiting for the drugs to kick in....

Time passes. The doctors, standing guard at the ward, are eventually called away for what seems like their own brief meal. In the growing darkness of the ward - for the lights are dimmed, as evening approaches - it's not clear how many people are asleep or awake here.

Edward rolls onto his side, and tries to get him some sleep. _Knowing my luck, I've likely got all the rest for the next three days..._

After a time, it's clear that the three men are the only ones awake here - no doctors have come back to replace those who apparently went for dinner. The ward is quiet.

A little calmer, Garfield levers himself out of bed. That kid's clothes are there, his own might be near his bed.

They probably would have taken his supply of booze, but he has to check. He **has** to...

Garfield's clothes are easily found. Rumpled, but otherwise unharmed - in all respects, in fact, except for that flask..

Drake is somewhere between sleep and wakefulness...the pain is gone now, but his vision swims slightly when he opens his eyes...when he hears movement, he tilts his head to look, trying to focus.

Edward's attention is caught by the movement. He props himself on his shoulder. "Are you seriously going to try for yet another break for it?"

Garfield whipsers, "Son of a **bitch**!" He looks towards the door -- _Proably useless, but what the hell..._ He jerks his head at the other's voice. "A drink's the only medication **I** need, kid. Leave me alone."

Garfield struggles with the ties holding the flimsy gown together. Eventually they give way, and he begins pulling on his clothes.

Drake chuckles quietly...and then absently checks his watch.

Garfield draws a hand softly against the smokey fabric, feeling guilt and sorrow and anger wash over him. "A drink. All I need is a drink..."

Edward rolls his eyes, as well as his body, peering toward the other direction.

The bus driver finally makes his way unsteadily to the doors of the ward. Checking them - unlocked - and opening them, he looks out into a hall utterly devoid of occupation. The hospital feels silent, as though everyone went to dinner at the same time and forgot those in the ward.

Garfield says, "There's no one there," to himself. He hestitates -- he'd been expecting to have to bully some nurse or something.

Drake shrugs and puts his arm back down. _Not hungry yet, anyway._ He listens for sounds of Garfield being aprehended, though.

Edward inclines his head, looking back towards Garfield. _That's strange. There's no reason why there wouldn't be anyone not on staff, especially with that guy over there and his pills..._ He needs to use the bathroom anyways. He gets up, himself, and grabs his pants.

Edward is quickly dressed, and on his feet - somewhat unsteady, but able to walk without interruption or incident.

Garfield steps out into the hall. _Would the cafeteria....? No, I'm not thinking straight. There wouldn't be anything alcoholic in a place like this. I need to find an exit, get out of here..._ He looks around for any visible signs.

With that, Edward starts after Garfield. He heads into the hall, and instead looks for a Restroom sign.

In a hospital, EXIT signs are everywhere. The designers have spared no expense to provide comprehensive, simple plans for evacuation, emblazoned on every wall. The restrooms, too, are fairly easy to locate. Two pairs of footfalls echo slightly through the deserted hallways.

Drake snorts to himself. _Darn. The amusement left._ He's patient, though. He's sure any minute someone will drag them both back.

Edward swiftly moves to the restroom, pushing through. _Surprised the halls are empty... Damn. That driver may actually get away._

Seeing the kid vanish into a toilet reminds Garfield that despite everything else, his bladder still functions. After contemplating the washroom's closed door for a moment, he walks off to find a different one.

Two bathroom trips are quickly disposed of, with Drake's spinning head keeping him comfortable where he is.

By that time, however, Drake is starting to wonder, even dizzy as he is. _Maybe the kid wouldn't have gotten stopped, but the old man?_ Finally, his curiosity gets the best of him and he decides to try standing.

Drake wobbles a little, bit makes to get upright. "Okay. For my next trick..." He starts looking around at the quiet ward, noting no personell of any kind. He moves over to one of the beds that seems to be occupied.

Edward exits the bathroom, wiping his hands. Despite the air of cleanliness that hospitals often permit, it's true that they are centers of disease. He looks around, continually perturbed. _This isn't normal._

Drake nudges one of then, trying to see if he can get the guy awake.

The body shifts slightly, but makes no further motion.

In fact, \`no further motion' includes breathing...

Drake stares. "Hey, wake up." he slaps the guy in the face.

The slap produces no effect whatsoever.

Edward starts looking into rooms that might have doors open, or seeing if he can spot a nurse station.

Drake checks the man for a pulse. _Did he go and croak?_

Garfield slows up in his dash for the exit, the emptiness of the place breaking through his immediate desire to quench his thirst. He stops and listens for any noise. They aren't just playing with him, are they, letting him get most of hte way out before stopping him? No, why would they do that?

Nurse stations are considerably easier to find than nurses. It seems that nobody is on duty right now. Drake, meanwhile, puts two fingers down and for two minutes feels nothing.

Drake starts to hear the Outer Limits music in his head. He checks another 'sleeping' patient.

The bus driver's attentive ears yield no sign of activity - wait - a door, closing, behind him...

Garfield spins and sees--

Edward looks for a nurse call button. "Okay, this is just Wrong."

And the man in the ward, head growing more and more cloudy with something beyond dizziness, finds another patient with neither breath nor pulse.

The bus driver and the student have met up in the hall, Edward on his way to call for a nurse, Garfield turning and looking at the sound Ed made coming out of one door. The two men seem to be the only ones present in the hospital proper. Dinner must be crucial.

Garfield says, "Christ, don't scare me like that. You see anyone? This place looks like it was evacuated or somthin'..."

"What the fuck." Drake says dully. He feels like Gary Sinise. He slowly makes his way over to the station in this ward, looking to see if there's a call button or a phone.

A nurse's station sits nearby, with a call button and telephone.

Drake makes his way over there, trying not to trip over himself and jams his finger on the button hard.

Edward swallows. "I know. This isn't normal. I mean, no signs of life. No phone calls, no intercoms calling doctors, no Anything." His hands situate in his pockets, "Something's up." He moves to one of the rooms with a chart on it, and picks up the chart, reading over it briefly.

Outside of the ward, Drake's call for a nurse goes unanswered.

Drake purses his lips and tries the phone next, looking to see if there are extentions on the set that are marked, since he'd have no idea otehrwise who to call.

Garfield says, "I'm checkin' an exit. Maybe the CDC's got us barricaded in and, if not, there's a bottle of whiskey or two with my name on it in the closest bar I can find."

The phone before Drake is clearly marked and labelled for calls inside or outside the hospital.

Edward looks over it. Fine. Patient seems in their room. He opens the door. "Excuse me?"

The room is empty.

Drake dials the extention for the front desk, seeing as he has no better ideas.

Though Drake dials, there's no answer.

Garfield leaves the kid checking out some room or other and resumes his trek past a series of EXIT signs.

The front doors of the hospital open easily enough for Garfield, and the cool air of evening brushes its way over his face.

Drake tries the next one, and the next. Nothing. "Okay...I don't know what the fuck is going on, but I'm not sticking around." He makes his way back to the bed, puts on his jacket and stuffs his gun in the back of his pants. Then he goes out into the hall, trying to figure out how to leave the building from the signs.

Edward puts the chart back, and is actually Scared. This is bothering him. This isn't normal, this isn't right. He looks around franticly... Ah! Just what he's looking for. He rushes over to a fire alarm, and yanks it.

The fire alarm resounds through the complex. Garfield hears it as he's stepping outside; Drake hears it as he's holding the useless handset of a useless phone in his hand; Edward hears it, even as his fingers release the lever.

Garfield looks around and then heads to the nearest busstop -- stopping in his tracks as the alrams blares around him. "What the hell--?"

Drake gahs! and puts his hands to his ears. "Hunh. Okay, maybe this place isn't a dead zone. Unless that's maybe the drug. Christ. Fucking loud siren. Well, someone had to pull it, so..." He starts looking for live bodies.

Edward looks around, expectantly. _Okay, nurses. Someone. Let's see some motion around here._ He starts to tug at his pockets, settling his hands inside.

It doesn't take long for Drake to discover Edward, and in a few moments more Garfield. The three of them run into each other in the front of the hospital.

Garfield looks reflexively above the hospital for any signs of smoke. Was there a fire evacuation? Was the power cut to the fire alarm until just now? No... there'd be fire truck all over the place, then.

Garfield notes, "I don't see any smoke."

Drake eyes the others. _These two jokers._ "Did one of you bozos jerk the alarm?" he growls.

Edward spots Drake, and starts to shake his head. "This is nuts! Where the hell is everyone!?" Fingers run through his hair. All right, there has to be a good explination for this... "Yes! And look. No _people_."

Garfield says, "Err.. there still ain't any smoke. That ain't a good excuse for pullin' a bloody **fire** alarm!"

Drake snorts. "There are people, they're just all dead. I'm outta here. Have fun playing with the fire systems. You'll probably get soaked with water in a second." He starts to move past Garfield.

Garfield says, "Waitaminute. Dead?"

Drake sighs, and turns back. "Yeah. Dead. As in not breathing, pushing up daisies, sleeping with the fishes. Are you gonig to ask more stupid questions?"

Edward stares at the back of Drake's head. "Hold the phone. Dead? Who? Did you find any of the staff? Or just some patients or..." He looks back down the halls. _How could they all die?_

Garfield says, "But... but how can they be dead? You're fine, I'm fine -- the crash couldn't have been that serious, right?"

Drake stares at Garfield. "Crash? What the hell are you on? What crash?"

Edward says, "We were in some sort've accident..." He rubs his eyelid. "I think a bus crash?"

Garfield says, "The bus crash! This big yellow crane smashed into my bus. Weren't you on it? I remember falling, crashing into a train... but that can't be right. We'd all be dead then. Goners."

Drake looks at Edward. he doesn't really want to be having this conversation. "Look, everyone that was in the ward is dead. And if you see no one else, there's probably a similar explanation. Now, I suggest you leave unless you want to join them." At the explantion, he shrugs. "I don't think a crash killed all the people in the hospital. It's probably a virus."

Garfield says, "A virus? What... what makes you say that?"

Drake groans. "Okay, so maybe it's not a virus. I have no fucknig clue? That make you happy? I just want to go back to my hotel."

_Virus? Shit._ That seems to have concinced Edward. He's allready moving his way through the door. "Great. I'm living the movie _Outbreak_ as we speak."

Drake smirks at Edward. "One of you is smart, at least." he follows.

Garfield shakes his head. His thoughts feels like they weighted with lead. "...movie? I... I need a drink." He turns and stumbles away.

Drake says, "That's your answer to everything. You'd probably try to cure cancer with a quart of Jim Beam." Drake calls back. Looking around for sirens or signs of life.

Garfield barely hears the jibe. He tries to think of the nearest bar.

Outside the hospital, things are as quiet as they were inside. No emergency vehicles answer the call; nobody comes running; no sign is given whatsoever of the presence of anyone who might care about the fire alarm.

Drake twitches, getting out his lighter and flicking it. _Soon as I stop feeling so woozy, I'm having a cig._ He watches Edward curiously, looking to see where he's going. And starting to wonder. _What, did someone really spill Capn' Trips into the air? Is the whole city like this?_

Edward does a little figuring in his head. _Okay, the apartment isn't THAT close to the campus, but I should be able to make it there after some walking. I hope everyone's home._ He starts off in the direction of the Apartment.

Garfield locates one on his mental map of the city, and makes a beeline there. His head and eyes are down, and he tries desperately to think of nothing.

Drake thinks about how far it is to his hotel, and decides he doesn't want to go that long. He starts looking for a cab...if there's no cabs, it will just hit home that the city **is** dead.

No cabs are forthcoming. Sufficient time will demonstrate that no bus is coming, either.

Edward, on the other hand, doesn't have far to go. However, the environs of his apartment are just as devoid of human life. None of the typical sounds - laughter, shouting, music, automobiles - can be heard. It's eerily empty.

Garfield stops and blinks back up the road. The bus should have gone by by now. Damn unprofessionable of the driver....

Edward Frowns deeply. _Now, I'm bothered. The couple upstairs isn't fighting, no loud music, no nothing..._ He rushes up to his apartment, fishing for the keys.

The apartment is as Edward left it - uncluttered, untouched.

Drake flickflickflicks his lighter. _Fuck._ He starts walking, looking for a bar. If there's a virus, and it's killed everyone, they're probably reporting about it on TV. Although he's surprised he hasn't seen even any dead bodies yet.

Thinking black thoughts about what his profession is coming to, Gar resumes his walk.

Edward walks through it. "Riley? Lina?" He walks through it. They're usually home, or atleast leave a note... He walks to the TV, touching it. Cold. They wouldn't have left without a note. Fingers drag through his hair. "There has to be a reasonable explination for this. I didn't just walk onto an Apocalypse Now set..."

Edward looks at the calendar. "Thursday. Usually Riley and Lina go down to the local bar on Thursdays... They're probably just there. Right." He gets his coat, and heads out of the house, heading down that way. "They're just with some friends for a drink... Completely sensible. I know this, no need for them to leave a note."

It doesn't take more than half an hour for the three explorers, each arriving one after the other, to step through the door of Murphy's.

Murphy's, the bar, is a one-story local affair - the last thing on your way up into the hills, your first thing on the way back down. Currently the bar is empty - glasses, however, line the bar. Some are half-full, some are nearly empty. Chairs, here and there, are pulled out as though in use. Nobody, however, is present. The bar is empty. Light and inviting... but empty.

Drake purses his lips, and then goes to the TV, looking for a switch to turn it on.

The television is switched on; Must See TV seems to be the order of the day.

Edward walks in, looking around, surprised to see the... only other two people he knows. A blink. Okay, now he Needs a drink. Walking over to the bar, he pauses at it. After looking a few minutes, he goes around, to find him something to drink. "This is ridiculous," He mutters.

Drake hmmphs and starts flipping the channels,looking for news, or CNN, or something.

With on bartended to object, Garfield hops the bar and quickly selects a bottle. Only the barest courtesy stops him from drinking straight from it, though. He fills a glass and his first shot burns its way into his empty belly.

Drake smirks at Ed's comment. "What did you expect? We're in the middle of the Stand, boy."

Alcohol is procured without protest. The news cycles through several channels, many of which appear to be unreceivable - only static greets the observers.

Drake shoots that offhandedly, but it's not as if he doesn't care. He does. But he can't bring himself to feel fear, at the moment. For all he knows, he's jsut dreaming.

With a second shot warming him, Garfield casually offeres, "You want something, kid? On the house.

Edward grins lopsidedly at Garfield. "Yeah. Nothing to make my head explode. Something just to... I don't know. Brandy. Just get me some brandy. Or Schnapps, or something." He ignores Drake.

Drake blinks. "What the fuck. Did it kill everyone within a half hour? There's got to be someone reporting on this."

Garfield scowls has he turns away. "Brandy?" he mutters. "Schnapps? Bloody kids." Nevertheless, he selects something appropriate and purs the kid a glass -- a big one.

Edward glancse over towards Drake. "What did you expect? We're in The Stand." He accepts the glass with a firm sip, flinching a little. Drinking isn't his big thing but... Mm. Another drink, as he finds a place to sit.

Drake glares at the kid. "People didn't die that quickly. It took days for the whatsis to travel the continent. This defies logic."

Drake starts looking around for a radio.

Garfield realizes that he doesn't really have to have his cheap usual. He starts going through the bottles more carefully, looked for whatever passes for the 'good stuff' here. Soon enough he's warming his drink with his hands and sipping contentedly.

Edward shakes his head. "Whatever the cause, it seems to have skipped us. Which makes no sense." A fret of fingers through his hair.

It doesn't take much time to discover a portable radio in the back.

Garfield says, "Wha's this 'Stand' thing you guys 're talkin' 'bout?"

Drake says, "yeah, well, one percent survived the plague in the Stand too. But there was more dead bodies, there...and like I said, it took longer." Drake mutters. he ignores Gar, turnnig the radio on and trying to get the FM stations.

Garfield says, "Stan', Stan' -- what the hell is it?"

The radio plays a merry tune of static.

"A book, made into a movie. Steven King did it." Edward sips his brandy, shaking his head. "Check WIT, 104.5. They usually have current news updates, with the DJs."

Garfield says, "Movie 'bout everyone dyin'?"

Edward says, "About a plague, yes."

Drake shakes his head after a moment. "Nothing. No FM, no AM." He drums his fingers in the bar. "Anyone know how to hotwire a car?"

Garfield says, "Hotwire? Yeah, I supposed. Been a hell of a while...."

Edward's nose wrinkles. "I could try." A glance to Garf, before he stands up, setting the glass aside.

Drake juts his chin. "Then get up and help me start a car. Not going to stick around here any longer than I got to."

Garfield says, "Sure, kid. Go ahead. I'll be along inna bit...."

Edward says, "Don't chug too much. If I can't pull it off, I don't want you drunk enough to elecricute yourself." He moves through the door. "That's no fun..."

Garfield says, "'member, cut the wrong wire and boom!" He laughs uproariously.

Drake rolls his eyes. "Fat fuck." he mutters.

Edward heads out into the parking lot, before looking around. Turning to spot Drake coming out, lips quirk into a smirk. "Do you want a compact, a Mini-van..."

Drake goes over to a four-door sedan on the street without answering. He consides breaking the window, and then decides to go for the subtle approach. He always has his picks with him, though most of his other equipment is at the hotel. So he gets them out and kneels, trying to jimmy the lock.

Garfield stares after the pair until the door closes. Lips pursed, he checks the bar to see if the barkeep had any goodies stowed out of sight.

Edward walks over to the car after Drake, before watching. _I'm dealing with a regular thug. Grand._ A sigh. Well, atleast the car can get wired and they find Something.

Drake gets the door open after a moment. "Okay, junior. Do your hightech whiz-bang stuff." he says unceremoniously.

Edward slides into the seat, and uses a pocketknife to get to the wires. With some work, and a little bit of elbow grease, the car comes to life. He slides over into the passanger seat. "There."

Drake nods. "Not bad." And that's as close to a thanks as Ed gets. He slides in and looks around. "Fat bastard comnig with us?" he grunts.

Garfield smiles as he lifts his find -- a decent enough bat. "Not bad," he thinks. "Not as good as mine, but okay." He looks again at the door. "Bloody kids. Better go chaperone 'em..."

Edward points to the doorway of Murphy's. "Right there. Looks like he found himself a piece of steel driftwood."

Garfield walks a bit unsteadily out the door, bat in one hand and bottle in the other. He spots the running car and heads over. "I figure I'd better go with you guys, keep you outta trouble..."
