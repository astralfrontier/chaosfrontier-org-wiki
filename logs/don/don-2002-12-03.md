# Dead of Night 2002-12-03

What was once in Garfield's mind an armoured tank under his deft control has become something else now, and the change has not been for the better. A box, the bus has become -- a box on wheels. Of course that's how anyone who looks at the large public transportation vehicles sees a bus, but to the bus driver, towering over even the steadily if stupidly growing SUVs, the bus was a champion.

Now, it was no longer armoured. It was no hero. It was a thin aluminum shell on some rubber wheels and the sorry state of his last ride gave terrible testimony to the fact that champions fall.

Garfield gives the steering wheel a soft caress as he pulls up to the corral's exit and reflexively looks both left and right down the eerily emtpy streets. It is the sort of touch one might give the hand of a friend in a casket, or the gentle kiss goodnight to love one passing on a hospital bed. The engine might roar when he tromps on the pedal, but the symbol the bus once represented to Garfield is no more. He shakes off the feeling. "Al'right, then," he growls. "Where the hell am I goin'?"

Drake checks the action on the last shotgun. He's convinced that with enough guns, there will be no threat. "45 Heathrow St. There's a seedy little hotel there I can't remember the name of." he grunts without looking up.

The stars overhead seem distant, imparting their light only grudgingly to a dark and empty little planet spinning through the uncaring void. And below, in the city of Portland, the headlights of TriMet's bus number 6037 illuminate the next empty city block, the next shadow-wreathed entrance to an unexplored alley, the next abandoned car parked against the curb. Buildings that should be radiant with light and sound and humanity are lifeless. The eerie uniformity of the city's desertion creeps its way into the bones of three people, each in his own way familiar with the pulse of urban living and each increasingly aware of the solitude through which they all ride.

The address is easy to find. Garfield can recite city streets by heart, engraved into the stone edifice of his memory. With that knowledge, in spite of his shaky nerves and an increasingly-undeniable sense of wrongness, the bus twists and turns through the night and finally arrives at the dingy hotel in which Drake lives and works and has his being.

Garfield says, "Heh. Early for the stop here. Guess I should wait a few minutes to get on schedule, hey?" His laugh is not pleasant.

Drake looks at Edward. "You think you can guard our chauffer?" he queries, pumping a round into his shotgun of choice.

Edward sits in his seat, half asleep, but still ideas float in his cranium. This is just bothersome. No, not bothersome, this is totally inconvenient and unfortunate. But is it futile? Is the next town, the next city, the next state just like this one? Was it local, or enormous in what happened? And what caused it. One thing's for certain; he's going to have to strap one of those things down, and examine it. He clings to his shotgun, an anchor in this grim reality, a safety blanket with an explosive charge. As long as he has this, he'll be stuck in this atmosphere of moving dead, but atleast it might be asafe one. He looks up, shaking his drowsiness like a cloak. "Huh? Yes, but I don't think I can protect him from the bottle."

Garfield says, "Guard? You seen what a couple of tons worth of inertia can do to a body? I'm keepin' the engine runnin' and my eyes open. And the bottle cap's closed, thank you very much, kid. Just hurry your ass up, hear?"

Drake just shakes his head in amusement. "I'm sure you'll do your best. Try not to die on me, folks." _Amusing little fucker._ He thinks to himself. "All right, all right." he says aloud to Gar, and hops out of the bus. _Wonder if there's any walking corpses in there. Not that it matters. Cause I got my boom stick, and I'm meaner than Bruce Campbell could ever be._ He tests the doors of the hotel.

The hotel is unlocked; inside, darkness reigns. The light-switches are most assuredly not next to the door when you walk in.

Edward smirks, and rolls out of his seat, before walking towards the back of the bus, and setting up his little guard post. A 20 oz bottle of coke, some chocolate, and his gun. That should keep him relatively awake. While Gar watches the front, he'll stay stationed in the back.

Drake throws the doors wide, in the hope that some light will be let in from outside. He doesn't bother being quiet. "Knock knock!" he says loudly, and then listens for the sorts of sounds zombies would make.

As void to the ears as it is to the eyes, the hotel hangs over Drake's head without a sound, aside from what he brings with him.

Drake sighs. "This is why I need my stuff. I need my flashlight." he says to no one in particular. He gets out his lighter, and flicks it to life, using the minor illumination to try and find a switch.

The sputter of fire, man's oldest tool, puts fear to a cluster of newly-seen shadows that flee across the walls and ceiling of the hotel's lobby. It's enough to see by, at least, if one walks slowly and is on guard for wind currents.

Drake edges into the lobby. He was planning on moving slowly, anyway. _Just in case zombies know how to ambush. They do in the movies._ His shotgun is held in his right hand, the lighter in his left.

Back in the bus, two pairs of eyes witness Drake's disappearance into the hotel, then the brief plume of light that serves as his illumination. As silent minutes pass, the tremors and soft sounds of the bus settling become more noticeable.

Garfield says, "Say, kid -- think I should have lent him the bus' emergency flashlight?"

Edward glances over his shoulder. "If not, then I wonder what constitutes an emergency."

Garfield says, "Dunno, my damned if I'm letting one sneak up on me. Look good back there?"

Edward says, "Looks like night in a dead city filled with monsters. Yeah."

Edward says, "Good as it'll get."

Garfield's mouth quirks. "Groovy."

Time passes. Outside the bus, a flicker of orange light can be seen shining dimly through the curtains of one of the hotel's windows.

More time passes. Edward, his fingertips pressed up against the plexiglass bus windows, is feeling the steady beating of his own heart reflected back into his skin by them. Garfield, further up, finds his eyes registering flashes of light off in the distance, well away from the hotel - up the street, in fact.

Garfield kills even the dim interior lights of the bus, peering ahead. What the hell is that?

Another dim flash is seen; though his eyes strain to catch further hints of it, Garfield is unable to get a clearer picture.

Drake abruptly strides out of the dark double doors, his duffel slung over his left shoulder, and his shotgun firmly held in both hands. _Easy as filching a wallet from a mark._ He moves up to the bus, and knocks on the doors. "I'd like a ticket to 'Anyplacethat'snothere', please." he says smugly.

Garfield thumbs the door release switch without really looking. "Hey, can you make out what's goin' on up ahead?"

Edward blinks, belatedly. "Hey, Garfield, what's with the lights?"

Edward turns around, this time. "What's going on what?"

Drake comes in, squinting out the front windows. "No, but...hold on." He grabs his binoculars out of his duffel and peers throguh them.

Edward eases out of his seat, and walks ahead, holding his shotgun like a cane. Grabbing hold of one of the bars behind Gar's seat, "What's up?"

Garfield says, "There's somethin' flashin' up ahead." to the kid. "Thinkin' of takin' a look."

"A closer look, if y'get what I mean," he clarifies at the kid's sudden expression.

Edward taps the butt of his shotgun. "I have a bad feeling about that."

The binoculars concentrate light. Without better light to go on, they only serve to concentrate darkness. Dim hints of shapes, polymorphously perverse even in the man's night vision, are all that he can make out.

Garfield says, "See a buncha darkness through them binocs, eh? Get in, let's go take a look-see"

_Hell,_ Garfield thinks, _it could be cops cars or ambulances or somethin'. And if it ain', I can jus' barrel on through..._

Drake winces, and takes the binocs away from his eyes. "Yeah, can't tell much at all." he agrees. "I bet it's mroe walking dead, though."

Edward settles into the seat behind Gar. "Well, let's find out one way or another."

Drake chuckles, hefting his shotgun. "Why not. We've got ammo to spare."

Garfield says, "Jus' to let you guys know -- I may have to break the rules and miss a busstop or two. Don' go reportin' me, okay?" His expression is ironic as he closes the door and revs the engine.

The bus creeps forward under Garfield's professional touch, its harnessed power ready to drive the mass of metal forward at its best possible speed at any sign of real danger. Outside the windows, the driver's sharp eyes are the first to note an oddity on the street.

Drake just shakes his head. _I think that accident knocked a few cards from this coot's deck._

A lantern - not a kerosene-driven camping lantern, but an ornate iron affair with antique shutters - rests atop the hood of one car. It's not lit, it seems, but neither is it the sort of thing one ordinarily sees.

Garfield says, "Now there's a pretty thing. 'Cept why the hell is it on the car?"

Edward squints through the darkness.

Curiosity gets the better of the driver, and his foot eases off the gas pedal.

Drake looks grimly at the object. "Why is it lit? Maybe there's someone else alive around here after all...and if there is, why use a dingly old lantern? I don't like this."

Garfield says, "It's not lit, dimwit. I want to know where the flashes are coming from -- it's obviously not that."

Edward finally gets sight of it. "Huh. That'd be worth simply snitching for the antique value."

No further flashes have adorned the driver's eye since launching his steel steed forward, and neither of the others can make any identification of a light source anywhere else.

Drake ignores the chiding, not wanting to admit his mistake. "Maybe it was lit, and that's what made the flashes." He taps the stock of his gun perturbedly.

Bus slowing, Garfield darts his gaze around, looking for anyting else out of the ordinary. "Right. Snort anything while you were gone? Maybe you dropped something?" His tongue is sharp, buth is mind is elsewhere, though. Where'd they come from?

Edward considers a second. "Gar, honk your horn a second. Send out a little 'SOS' if you can?"

Drake glances at Ed. "And it's only worth something if there's someone to sell it to, kid. Even I, the supposed 'dumb thug', knows that." He continues to ignore Gar. _He's not worth the bullets._

Edward spreads his hands towards Drake. "Call it a collectable."

Drake sighs. "Okay, fuck it. If we're going to get it, let's just get it and go. Old man, you want to bring this big metal dildo to a halt?"

"Balls," Garfield says, rather succinctly. He applies the brakes, and squaks as Drake reaches past him to thumb the door release.

Edward keeps the gunbarrel low, while he moves over by Drake, ready for the 'dumb thug' to make his exit. "I'll cover you; just make a point to keep yourself out of firing range."

Drake smirks. "I always make a ponit of giving buckshot the right of way." He strides out the open doors and edges over to the car, shotgun pointed.

The car is ordinary enough; the lantern is not. Some sort of lettering, probably a brand name of some kind, used to wend its way in a ring around the base of the squarish iron cage of it, and this has been ruthlessly scratched away and defaced. The thing is in otherwise good condition.

Garfield shoots a glare at Drake, and angrily stabs the door control to shut it again. A moment later, though, and the door's open and he's outside with his bat. "Kid're prol'ly blind from starin' at TV from three feet." He ignores the lantern, though, and studies everything else.

Edward snorts, and walks down the stairs to the bottom step, holding onto the railing with one hand, and holding the shotgun in the other. His eyes are on Drake's direction, while Gar watches the bus.

Drake doesn't stop to read it right now. He grabs it with his left hand and moves to get back in the bus.

From the darkened streets, alleys, and unlit porches they pour, bodies in various states of decay and decomposition. All of them are fixated on a single goal - the two people standing out in the chill night air. Not even a moan breaks their horrid silence, as bodies of once-living people rush forward mindlessly, their damaged hands outstretched and their pitted faces contorted with malice.

"Fuck! Gar, get behind the wheel. GAR!" Edward thunders, and leans out, hooking the butt of the gun against his shoulder, weaving it back and forth, while gripping the bar. As soon as anything gets close enough to be blown apart, "Drake, Move your ass!"

Drake isn't stupid. _Well, maybe stupid enough to stop for the lantern, actually._ He moves for the door, not stopping to shoot. Best to do your shooting from an elevated postion anyway. With a barrier between you and the flesh hungry zombies.

Garfield takes a bare second to stare at the onrush and sigh. _Bloody moron_ he calls himself. He pushes past the kid and takes the bus out of park.

Edward lifts the shotgun, and aims at two of the zombies heading to cut Drake off. The end of his weapon blows fire into the night, as the buckshot tears into one, and gives the other a staggering pause. Of course, Edward's slammed into the door of the bus, having not prepared for the kickback. The barrel lowers a second. _Ow..._

The walking dead crowd around the bus, reaching out hungrily for Drake as he sprints round the front of the vehicle. From the back, a shattering sound can be heard.

Drake would grab the door and swing himself inside had he a hand free. But that hand holds the lantern. "Let's gogofuckinggo!" he shouts, cornering the bus and leaping up the first two steps provided nothing grabs him...

Edward backpeddles up the steps, seeing Drake nearing. He holds his shotgun high, hoping to blast anything that might take root on Drake's person. If the man makes it the steps, he's going to be heading back into the Bus Proper.

Garfield barely flinches at the shotgun blast as he slams the bus in gear. _Sometimes,_ he thinks, just sometimes, I wish these things would go from stopped all the way up to dead slow just a bit quick-- What the hell was that noise? It better not come outta **my** paycheque! He checks to see if Drake's on board yet. "Think we overstayed our welcome at this stop?"

Drake's shirt is nearly clawed by a pair of dessicated hands, but he manages to get out of the way with a few inches to spare. Edward's weapon speaks, driving back or destroying the tide of decaying flesh whose odor now washes through the opened doors of the bus and brings gorge to the throat. With both passengers safely in tow, Garfield drives his vehicle forward, charging the ranks of the animate dead before it...

.. and in the back of the bus, Edward and Drake come upon the sight of three of the dead things being pushed through broken windows by their fellows still on the street.

Drake is a little rattled as the bus jerks into motion, but when he sees the zombies, he brings up his rifle. "Sorry, dickheads. This bus is strictly for the living. And moaning 'braaains' is a capital crime. Sentence is being turned into goo." He fires.

Two of the shambling figures, still struggling to rise, go down and are apparently content not to rise again. A third stumbles and staggers, but continues rising to its feet.

Edward sighs, walks forward. "I bet my coke is spilt, too." He doesn't offer any witicisms, but just lifts the shotgun, and lets the buckshot speak for him.

Garfield eyes the mirror which shows him the bus' interior. "You know," he comments with a calmness rapidly slipping away, "plexiglass is usually quite strong. Now I'm gettin' a bit worried." The bus continues to accelerate, carefully aimed down the middle of the road. He winces at the thought of feeling the wheels run over a human shaped object.

With Edward's assistance, the third monster drops. Meanwhile, Garfield is the first to feel the impact of bodies bouncing off the grill as the bus charges ahead, into the night.

Edward lowers his gun, rubbing his shoulder. Even if he's decently squared in the shoulder, that **hurts**. "I think... they should be shoved out the door back there, before they start to stink up the bus."

Drake glances back at Gar as he fumbles for more shells to feed into the shotgun. "Don't underestimate the hunger of a zombie, I guess. Not bad. Ed."

Drake hesitates. "Okay, Ed...why doncha take a look at the lantern, see what we risked our lives for. I'll unload the dead once we get out of range of the smelly speedbumps."

Edward nods his head. "Right. And, while you're at it, point your gun at their head when you do. Don't want them to jump up and pull you down." He sets the gun aside, before walking over to the lantern.

Meanwhile, Garfield's eye is drawn not to the road ahead, or the presence of any mysterious light-source outside, but to the flicker of his instruments. Could the creatures have done some damage to the engine, to explain the vehicle's increasingly sluggish performance?

Drake hmms...he puts the reloaded shotgun aside and draws the .357 S+W he picked up. "No need to waste the big bullets against these downed fuckers." he says aloud, going over to one of the fallen. He looks it over briefly, to see what they're wearing, and how decomposed they are. He keeps the revolver pointed.

Garfield mutters quietly to himself, "Well, this calls for a bit of celebration, dont'cha think? Yes, indeedy, Gar, ol' buddy!" Deftly he lifts a flask from a pocket, using his thumb to unscrew the cap.

The corpses are arrayed in common garb - rotted, tattered and damaged by their time in the grave, perhaps, but ordinary nonetheless. Their now-still faces are horridly disfigured by the firearms' discharges, and their bodies likewise. Pieces of the plexiglass through which they were sent still embed themselves in dead flesh.

Drake grimaces, and gets the leather glvoes out of his coat...putting one on his left hand, he starts dragging one body around by the leg, towards the rear door. "How we doing? We leave the walking dead behind ther, old man?"

Garfield says, "Well, I could stop an' you could go out for a peek. What'cha say?"

Drake smirks. "Thanks, but no thanks. I was just wondering if you saw any out front." he peeks out a back window as he drags.

Garfield says, "Streets. Empty ones. An' no cemeteries, as a matter of fact. Where d'ya suppose the guys in the fancy duds came from?"

Drake shrugs. "Who cares. Open the back door, please." he grunts as he gets the body into position.

Garfield says, "'Gainst the rules, openin' the door while the bus is still in motion. You're such a nice guy, though, I'll make an exception. Mind the step -- an' don't slip."

The lantern, on Edward's inspection, is perhaps ten to twelve inches high. It is apparently made of iron, shaped into a rectangle, with a squat base and three sets of shutters on its sides that are all opened independently - the light can be focused into one or two directions, or opened completely. On all four sides, some sort of writing used to exist - but it has been scratched away, as though a sharp instrument were scored through the portions of the iron. No identification of writing-system or language can be made. Inside, an oil-soaked wick can be seen, burned and blackened. This item was used for its intended purpose at some point.

The lantern feels cold to the touch, but no more than anything else in the night air. As to its smell... well, perhaps more can be learned when the pervasive reek of death is excised from the bus.

As the doors open, Drake nudges the body with his foot. "This is your stop. Mind your step." he informes the dead thing as he tries nudging the body down the steps with his foot, holding onto the railing with his left hand, still having his gun in his right.

Garfield rolls his eyes at the interior mirror and resists the temptation to indulge in a little evasive swerving.

Edward opens the lantern door, and presses his hand in, inspecting it carefully with the touch, moving from the top, to the wick.

The hand that touches the wick senses a lingering warmth, but with that touch, Edward feels a sudden stabbing sensation in his chest - a phantom pain, weirdly real and yet not. It has the qualities of a memory...

Garfield says, "Know what that smell reminds me of? Pork rinds. Disgusting things. Someone pass me a bag of Cheesy Poofs, hey?"

Slowly, one by one, the dead zombies make friends with paved road as the get kicked out, literally. The bus jumps slightly as the unmoving bodies are run over for good measure. Drake holsters the gun in the back of his pants then. "Ah. This calls for a smoke." He lights up and menthol and takes a drag, relaxing in a seat.

Edward jerks his hand back, wincing slightly and holds his hand to his chest. He rolls back onto his haunches, staring at the lantern with a bit of distate now.

Garfield says, "Hello? Cheesy poofs, please? I don' run on diesel, y'know."

As the bus continues its travels, fluctuations in the battery level, and an alarming drop on the gas needle attract Garfield's attention.

Edward stands up, and tosses Garf his cheesy poofs. "There." He calls, and walks back towards Drake.

Drake is very relaxed now, and he smiles urbanely at Ed. "Well, brain trust? Anything interesting on the lantern?"

The tossed bag is ignored as he taps at the guages. Downtown buildings flash by, unsee. "Oh, no. Nonono. Don' do this to me. Bloody mechanics! Come on baby...."

Edward shakes his head. "It's just a lantern, for what I can tell..." He looks back towards Garfield. "What?"

Drake looks in Gar's direction, taking another puff.

Edward yawns. Exhaustion - regular exhaustian from his normal lack fo sleep - and the night's excitement and terror is starting to wear on him. He staggers over to the seat, and settles in. "Hopefully, nothing exciting will happen again..."

Garfield says, "Either the gas guage was stuck, the tank was punctured or you guys are suckin' way to much diesel up a straw for it to be healthy...."

Garfield glances up at the mirror. "An' the battery ain't so hot either. Don' matter so long the engine's running, but if it stops -- say 'cause we're outta juice -- it ain't startin' again."

Garfield says, "I swear the garage monkeys should all just be dragged out and shot. Bloody **morons!**"

Drake chews the inside of his cheek. "Know any gas stations that have diesel around here?" Maybe we should stop for some. Like, fill up some gas cans.

Edward runs fingers through his hair. "Damnit." He lays his head back, propping it against a rail. He doesn't comment, but checks his watch instead.

Garfield laughs mirthlessly. "Hell, yeah, I'm all up for another ambush. What the hell, hey? I'm still feelin' lucky!"

Drake purses his lips. "You've got a point...but then again, if we try and get out of the city, and run out of fuel, we've fucked the duck anyway." he looks at Ed. "What do you think?"

Edward bobs his head forward, rubbing his eye with the heel of his hand. "Well, I figure that if we go to a gas station, they won't be prepared for an ambush because they didn't know we were coming. I'm shocked they were smart enough to set up their own trap..."

Drake's eyebrows tilt. "You know, you make a good point. That was awful contrived. I could almsot hear the movie them music in the background. But why bait a trap with a lantern anyway?" He calls over at Gar. "Best guess, how far can we get on what we got?"

Edward chuckles absently. "Because they didn't have any women to tie to a railroad track? I don't know."

Garfield says, "20 miles, give or take. Assuming the guage doesn't decide to drop like a rock again."

Drake nods. "Okay...get out onto the freeway, then. We're all dragging, here...find a gas station outside the city. And then we can hole up, get some sleep. And if the zombies want to follow, they'll have a bit of a hike, at least."

Garfield says, "If the bus konks out in the city, thief-boy over there can still hotwire us a car. In the country... dunno 'bout you, but I don't got hikin' boots on."

Edward lifts his head up. "Unless there are zombies outside the city..."

Garfield rolls his eyes. "Kid catches on quick. Bet you're a university student, hey?"

Drake shrugs. "If we go to a rest stop, and stay there, there's bound to be cars, though."

Drake says, "Let's at least give it a shot, huh? If they're thicker out there, we juice up and head in a different direction."

Edward nods his head. "Well, it should be away from the city, so hopefully there'd be no reason for the deadheads to amass where they likely can't find the living."

Garfield says, "Really? People park cars on streets in the city, no problem. They go inside and get killed, leaving lotsa cars aroun'. What're the odds of a rest stop mass zombification or whatever?"

Garfield says, "In the city, there's zombies, sure, but there's also rides and food and even bullets for that toy you keep fondlin'. In the country there's just a whole lotta nothin'."

Garfield says, "'Cept zombies, maybe. An' without a ride and no loaded shotgun, y'may as well just bend over cause you're gonna get screwed anyway."

Edward says, "You're also using this logic in a situation where hundreds of thousands of people just up and disappear, or turn into the walking dead."

Drake sighs. "Let's just go, huh? We can always change our minds."

Garfield says, "Christ. Fine. Let's go."

After careful consideration, the bus is turned east - through Gresham, down Highway 26 towards Mount Hood. There are towns and populated areas down the whole stretch, and in a pinch the emergency-vehicle depot for the mountain is halfway down the highway. Garfield steers his protesting beast through the night, while Drake and Edward keep their eyes open. The thoughts of each man follow peculiar paths, wending through the unexplored vastness of speculation and returning to the troublesome homelands of memory. In due course, down the highway and nearly to a small town, a gas station is sighted. Fortunate, for the bus has scant few miles left to it.

The gas station's signs are unlit. 1.39 9/10, the sign proclaims balefully. In the glare of the bus's headlights, the diesel pump - electronic, and dark like everything else here - is clearly visible. As the bus rolls in, the engine sputters and coughs. With a last shuddering heave the great behemoth grinds to a stop. The death-rattle of the engine is the last sound the trio hears, aside from that of their own breathing.

Garfield pounds a fist on the steering wheel. "Y'bent over yet?" he asks the other two.

Drake kicks a seat. "Shit on a stick. Do busses start with jumper cables?"

Garfield says, "Y'see any cars around?"

Drake looks outside. "No." he says wryly.

Edward peers out at the gas station, standing up. Whoo... Exhaustion has gotten to him. He shoulders the shotgun. "Well, if we're going to get fuel into this thing, we might as well go turn on the power to the station."

Garfield says, "He was blind but he can now see. Praise the Lord. Power to the station? Right... I real hopeful about that."

Drake thinks for a moment, looking around to see if there are Zombies.

Edward walks to the head of the bus, tapping on the window. "Okay, I might as well do this since Drake went after his stuff and the lantern. You give me pistol cover. Gar, let me out."

Drake sighs. "Well, without battery power, refueling is pointless. Maybe we should just tuck in and get some sleep."

Garfield says, "No power, kid. Go climb out a window."

Edward starts towards a window drowsily, before pausing. "Wait a second. The lever's right **there**. Has the liqour gotten to you allready?"

Garfield says, "No, but you ain't lookin' so hot. You want to haul the door open manually, be my guest."

Drake snorts and pulls out the revolver. "The liquor got to him long ago."

Garfield says, "Least it only soaked my liver. I'm wonderin' what interesting chemicals have been shortin' your brain cells..."

Edward grabs the lever and hauls his body into it, before wobbling down the steps. "I'm fine. I'm used to lack of sleep." He starts towards the gas station, and pauses, before walking back. "Gar, give me the flashlight."

Garfield says, "As you wish, honourable customer." He rummages in the emergency kit. "Hope these batteries haven't died too..."

Drake sighs. "Only think I use is American grown nicotine sticks, and the occasional nip of liquor, sot. Not nearly as muc or as often as you."

Garfield says, "Yeah, I heard denial is the first stage. Glad to see you're making progress."

Edward claims the flashlight, clicking it on. He walks towards the station, keeping his ear to the air. He may not have the best eyesight, but he can hear very well. Making it to the gas station, he pulls open the door, and looks around for the employee door, while being very still for a few moments. Then, carefully he moves towards the employee area, searching for a fuse box or power grid, something.

Drake cocks the revolver audibly. "You know, I usually only make it a point to kill other criminals and assholes. You're rapidly worming your way into the second category. Why don't you put a lid on your fucking mouth." He turns away to look out the window then, covering Ed. Because he said he would, despite the jackoff driver.

Garfield says, "Yes, sir, Mr. Customer, sir!"

After several minutes of fumbling around in the station's interior, flashlight in hand, Edward pieces together the arrangement of switches that'll restore electricity to the gas station. Everything is apparently on already, but a couple vicious toggles on the switches brings the unrelenting glare of overhead light and outdoor illumination to the lonely outpost. Three pairs of eyes struggle to adapt to the glow.

Garfield says, "So nice to announce our presence to half the country, don't you think?"

Drake shrugs. "You can't have everything." He's not really all that short tempered. But Gar is annoying. And he wanted to warn the fellow too many smart remarks could have him get his head ventilated.

Edward pockets the flashlight, and walks through the station, looking for batteries. _Y'know, we should see if anyone around the state is answering any phones..._

A few minutes suffice to locate a suitable battery. Less time is required to locate the phone in the back.

Garfield stands. "I need to take a leak. I'm gonna go see if I can find the key to the little boy's room." He pushes past Drake, bat hangling loosely from one hand. He calls over his shoulder as he walks to the building, "Don' worry -- I'll save you the key to the girl's room."

Drake sighs. _I hope he gets his dick bitten off._ He continues to watch for zombies.

Garfield says, "Find anything?" he asks the kid once he's inside.

"Yeah!" Edward points to the battery on the counter. "That should probably work, maybe, for the bus." He hits zero on the phone, tapping his foot. "C'mon... answer..."

The phone stays stubbornly, resistantly unanswered. Everything from 911 to the operator to his parents, relatives and friends goes through the dialpad, and not a single person answers. The phone rings, and rings, for as long as Edward is disposed to listen to the sound.

Drake sighs at the lack of activity...and abruptly decides to take a short nap. In the back of the bus. He's still woozy from the drug and lack of sleep...and maybe he'll get lucky and the whole thing will turn out to be a bad dream.

Edward slams the phone shut. "Damnit." A shake of his head. "The whole world's gone to hell." A look around the place. "I'll eat later. I'm tired. I'm going to the bus." He walks back towards the bus.

The student returns to the bus, finding Drake already camped out.

Edward finds himself a place to stretch out, exhaustion weighing him down like an iron blanket.

Garfield looks sourly at the heavy battery. "Sure, let the bus driver do everything. Somehow I think driving is more tiring than staring out a bloody window, people. Whatever. Where's the damn can?" Business complete and face freshly scrubbed with cold water, Garfield slings a set of jumper cables over his shoulder and struggles to carry both the bat and a battery back to the bus.

The battery is jumpered up, but the bus's battery refuses to take a charge. After twenty minus, Garfield realizes the situation is probably not going to improve. The bus will stay where it is.

Cursing and grunting with the effort, the driver manages to yank out the old battery and substitute a new one. A little rewiring, clamping and taping means the engine should at least fire up.. But when the key is turned, silence reigns.

Garfield mutters, "Shot. They should all be shot." He starts checking out what he can of the engine itself.

Garfield says, "It's the middle of the night, my head feels like its stuffed full of sand, I'm bent over a bunch of greasy engine parts and practially the only tool I've got is a double damned screwdriver. Someone hates me even more than I do." He enters the bus to announce that he's giving up the job and that they're pretty much screwed, just as he predicted.

.. and therein he finds Edward and Drake, resting peacefully and breathing in the slow rhythm of sleep.

Garfield wonders what a shotgun blast at short range looks like, then remembers he actually found out tonight.

Garfield stumbles out of the bus and looks around at the empty night. He almosts glances up at the station's light, but manages to resist. "Mum always told me to turn off the light when I go to sleep. Shouldn't disappoint her, hey?"

Walking slowly to the building, he considers the possiblity that he's gone mad and that the morning will bring, not sunlight or gruesome death, but the inside of a jail cell or padded rubber room. "Gotta be better 'n this," he thinks. A few random slaps at the light switches is enough to bathe the station once more in darkness. He looks outside. "Stupid bus. Screw that, I'm not sleeping there. Pure bad luck, that's what it is. Nice lockable bathroom right here. Not far to go if I gotta pee at night. Sold." The bat is still in his hand, but it's dragging on the floor as he enters the toilet and kicks the door shut behind him. It rolls away from him as he sinks down into a cold corner. He's asleep before his butt hits the floor.

Time passes. Sleep, and troubled dreams, possess the three. Edward and Drake come awake at almost the same instant, an insistent thumping sound on the side of the bus being the cause of their sudden and painful return to consciousness. Outside is a state trooper, smiling in the light of dawn, and eyeing the TriMet logos on the bus. "You fellows are a bit out of your way, ain't ya?" he inquires sociably.
