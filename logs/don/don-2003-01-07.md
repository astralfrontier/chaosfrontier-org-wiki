# Dead of Night 2003-01-07

Edward is starting to get worried. "I didn't shoot to kill," He points out, before simply gaping. _He's going to... well hell._ He can't exactly do anything more then simply stare.

Drake closes his eyes and pulls the trigger...and nothing. The gun does not go off. "Fuck me." he says around the barrel of the gun.

In the near distance, the sounds of sirens can be heard growing closer. After a few moments where nobody moves or even seemingly breathes, an ambulance whips into sight and screeches painfully to a halt about twenty feet away from the downed man with a gun in his hand. Two paramedics - both young, it seems - leap out of the vehicle, but stop their rush as they take note of the firearms present.

Drake just lets his arms fall. It's over. He can't even end his own life. The gun clatters from his hand.

Edward is still watching and waiting. He looks curiously down at Drake. A glance upwards, towards the paramedics. A point to the bus. "Gun shot victim, in the bus. I stopped the bleeding, but he's in shock."

Garfield steps down from the bus. "Yeah," he affirms. "The cop's in there. The guy on the ground is the one who shot him."

The back of the ambulance is cracked open quickly, and diffidence evaporates on the part of the two young professionals. The next few minutes feel hazy and indistinct; Drake's world, numbed by shock and shot through by bolts of piercing lightning as pain assaults his nerves, becomes one of far-off half-heard cries, while both bus-driver and student are likewise feeling a peculiar skewing of reality as everything settles in at once - the night, the day, the gunfight, an empty Earth and their next brushes with death.

Drake's mind goes far away, his body dying by inches as the paramedics try to save his life. But he doesn't care. He's basically given up, and lets whatever will happen, happen.

The trooper, and Drake, are quickly loaded aboard the ambulance aboard stretchers. Ironic, that two men who under healthier conditions might be trying to kill each other are laid out side by side.

Edward feels dizzy. It all seems to be over. Before, it took going with the flow, simply reacting, but now... now what? It all seems to just compress on down, earning the dizziness of exhaustion. He sways, before sagging to his knees.

Looking around at the carnage, Garfield fights off a staggering numbness. How in hell did he go from getting up one ordinary morning a scant couple of days ago, to this nightmare? Or was last night the nightmare and was this now just completely unreal? "Fuck," he states to the empty air. "I need a drink." That problem, at least, is easily remedied.

At this point one of the paramedics - the other is apparently tending the two wounded in the back of the ambulance - returns to the bus and the abandoned cruiser to take stock of those left. He's lugging a first aid kit and is clearly disturbed by the situation he's found himself in. Edward, then Garfield, is quickly checked over for injuries, and just as quickly left alone - men with weapons are not this man's area of expertise.

Edward stands up, and wanders over to Garfield, scratching the back of his head. "I have the feeling we have to stay for the cops. As much as I'd like to get the hell out of here, and home."

Garfield nods. "Yeah. That's probably for the best, and damn it to hell anyway. Think the medics'd give me an aspirin if I asked nicely? My back's killing me from sleeping on the floor last night."

Edward says, "No idea. Here, give me some of that."

Garfield waves the hip flask. "This? I don't-- Ah, hell. You've probably earned it."

It doesn't take long for a police cruiser, marked BORING P.D., to arrive. The siren isn't running; apparently it was following the ambulance. It pulls up abruptly, and two uniformed officers (one still bearing the morning's coffee) extricate themselves from their vehicle.

With a quick glance at the new cop car, Garfield quickly mutters, "Keep it simple. Some street punk kidnapped up from the hospital and everything that happened after just follows, right? He was high or nuts or both. Beyond that, we just took orders until he got sloppy and we reversed the situation.

Garfield shoots a sour look at the ambulance. "It's pretty much the truth, too. Why the hell did he shoot the cop? Christ."

Edward nods grimly, and looks back at the bus. "Our fingerprints are on the guns. Keep that in mind." He starts walking up to one of the officers. "Thanks for getting here, but we had to take things into our own hands a little bit. We were afraid he was going to shoot us, after the woman in the convenience store..."

One of the officers nods to the other, and the junior man lopes toward the store itself while the remaining cop stays to listen.

Garfield drops the returned flask to the ground and stands as well. He makes certain to keep his hands in plain view. "I sure wish you guys had been around last night. Being kidnapped was _not_ on my list of things to do before I croak."

"Kidnapped by ... ahh, that other character?" the officer inquires, in a provincial accent. Apparently he has been at least sketchily informed of the ongoing situation.

Garfield says, "The punk in the ambulance, yeah."

Drake dreams, in the ambulance. Or, he thinks he does. He's not sure if he's awake anymore. He dreams of Dierdre. The feel of her. The taste of her. The way they fit. It could be the drugs. He might be pumped full of painkiller now, and that's why he's hallucinating. Or dreaming. He doesn't care. There are worse things than Dierdre to remember.

Edward nods his head, looking towards the ambulance. "I was headed to a bar not far from the Campus to see some friends; hitched a ride on his bus, and before I got there, this punk climbed aboard toating some serious firepower. You'd think he was some 'world's going to end' nut."

Edward points to the bus. "We had to stop here because the bus just stopped working, and then the patrol car pulls up... and he goes apeshit. The bus driver got into the patrol car when he went into the store, and we decided we had to take him down. You'll find our fingerprints on a few guns. We passed the guns around a little; I grabbed a rifle because I was going to get him from the window, but then he walked on the bus. Then the driver came on, and I went to hand him a shotgun... he got another. So I decided to run, but I took a pistol incase the driver didn't take him down... But I didn't want to leave him." A slightly flustered look. "I didn't want the punk coming after me if he shot him down."

The officer nods for a moment, then beckons idly at the two men as he himself strolls towards the ambulance. The paramedics are still waiting nervously for some official word, but they haven't taken off - the wounds must not need absolutely immediate care. The cop makes a quick survey of Drake, then the trooper next to him, and nods and salutes to the ambulance drivers. The vehicle takes off with a squealing of tires.

"You fellas are either lousy shots or pretty humane," he observes at last. "Alright. Get in," he directs, nodding to the back of the police car. "We're goin' to the hospital to fix this stuff up, then we'll see about you two."

Edward is slightly worried. He hopes no one at the hospital takes notice that he's missing, or the driver. A simple nod, before walking to the back of the car, and easing on in.

Garfield says, "The whole situation was madness, but I still didn't feel like killin' anyone." He shrugs. "I think the hospital would be a damn fine idea." _Back to a hospital? Christ on a crutch, hope we're not there overnight..._ With a strained smile, he heads to the police car.

It doesn't take long to get rolling. The two cops are in the front seat; Edward and Garfield are in back, sans handcuffs or other restraints. The cops seem wary, but more of the general situation - one that falls outside the bounds of their experience, which judged by their discussion in the front seat seems to be catching locals at DUI or enforcing hunting licenses. The ambulance, rather than making for OHSU, is picking a closer hospital - Legacy Mount Hood Hospital in Gresham, several miles away from the campus and unaffiliated with it. Whatever else there is to worry about in the next several hours, it won't be recognition.

_Not being in handcuffs at this moment,_ Garfield reflects as the scenery goes by, is a very good thing. On the other hand, if the world fucks off again tonight and the zombies come out to play, being locked in a nice cell could start seeming like heaven...

Edward stares out the window. _Was last night real? It... could have been. I remember it. It wasn't some dillusion, and the oldtimer here also had it so... What happened? Why is the world back again?_ A sign.

The hospital slides into view, nestled amidst the trees and buildings of Gresham. The ambulance peels off to one side, heading for the emergency entrance; the police cruiser goes the other direction, parking in the lot out front. The cops get out, then beckon for their charges. "Gotta have ya checked out," explains one, shortly.

_I wonder if there really is a hell? If there is, I'm probably going there. But Leo will probably be there too. And Jake, and Guy and Kev. Hell could be very bearable knowing those assholes are already there, getting their feet burnt off._ Time loses all meaning to Drake. He barely knows where he is, or who's around him.

Edward slides out of the patrol car, and stretches a little while heading for the doors. "He didn't wound us, but the stress and exhaustion probably brought something on..." Commenting more to himself, or perhaps more to keep the story up, he reaches the door, looking back.

Garfield thanks the cop brusquely as the door is opened and held for him. Standing again, he rubs at the small of his back as he heads to the hospital.

The persistent sound of shuffling feet intrudes itself into Drake's hearing time and again, and now and then his wounds throb strangely, a feel of cold washing over his limbs despite his clothing.

Inside the hospital, things are orderly enough. One of the cops detaches from the little party to go talk to someone about something - police business, the mysterious interchanges of Society. The other grabs the attention of an orderly brusquely enough, and in whispered tones explains the need for some observation. A doctor is summoned, and soon enough Garfield and Edward find themselves together in two of the 79 beds the hospital sports.

Garfield blinks as a thought occurs to him. He turns to the kid and asks, "Think he'll start ranting about zombies again? I hated how he kept goin' on an' on about emtpy streets and dead things walkin' around."

Edward shakes his head sadly. "Whatever his problem is, hopefully they can get him treated for it. I didn't care for it either... Wonder what creeped into his mind, huh?"

"Prol'ly nothin' that wasn't stuck in through a vein first," Garfield replies darkly. "Damn looney."

No phone calls or messages come; the presence of the two men at the hospital has apparently not yet been announced. A blood test is taken about noon - "just routine," reassures the nurse - and lunch is brought into the rooms. The cops from Boring haven't left yet, although a heated discussion outside the door seems to indicate that a rather vicious discussion about jurisdiction is ongoing.

Garfield says, "Wonder how that first cop is doin'? Hope he pulls through after everything he did for us."

Edward eats. _Food! Finally. Even if it has little flavor except bad, it's something to Eat, which I havn't had in a while. What's that? I don't care. It doesn't taste aweful._ A look over. "Wrong place at the wrong time, sadly."

Garfield returns, "But right for us. We'd likely be bloody corpses now if he hadn't arrived." He finishes off the hospital food. "Uh, think we could order seconds?" he asks their police chaperone. "We sorta had pressin' concerns other than eatin' a proper breakfast, if you get what I'm sayin'. I got money in my wallet, if you want."

Meanwhile, Drake flutters in and out of conscious recall - at some point he feels the application of anaesthetic, but everything after that blurs together into a strangely soundless wonderland.

"If you gotta go to the can, yell," replies the man stationed outside. "If ya want seconds, I'll send someone in with another tray."

Drake thinks about the zombies. He wonders what happened. everything was normal in the morning, but it wasn't a dream because they were on the bus. Will he die? Will he turn into a zombie? If he does, he looks forward to chowing down on the fat fuck.

A second helping of lunch is delivered as promised. A sense of imprisonment is becoming more present - the phones don't work, either.

"Don't suppose we could take a stroll down to get a paper?" Garfield asks, more hopefully than anything else. "Kinda borin' just watchin' the seconds go by."

Edward glances around, after the second helping, wondering. _What's taking so long? Are they going to keep us here? Has the other hospital got ahold of them?_ Fingers tap the edge of the bed unnervingly. A glance to Gar's request.

The door opens and the cop strolls in. He's carrying a used newspaper, and presents it to Garfield without comment. "Yell if you fellas need anything else," he says amicably enough.

Garfield says, "Hey, thanks. Heh, after this mornin', guess I don't really need to take a walk to get my exercise, hey?" _Crap, crap, crap..._ He rapidly glances through the stories, looking for anything to indicate that last night was a perfectly ordinary night. And he's figuring that to pretty much everyone else, it was.

The paper is devoid of references, but.. nope, there it is, a brief note about a break-in at Tri-Met. No further details. By late afternoon, it seems like things are settled. A state trooper enters the room, closes the door behind him, and settles into a chair, legs crossed. "how you fellas doin?" he asks with a smile.

Garfield says, "Docs haven't told us we're dead, so that's somethin'."

Edward says, "Tired. I want to go home," He says, simply, looking back at the trooper. _He knows, doesn't he?_

The trooper nods slowly. "Well, I know the feelin'. The sooner we get things straightened out, the faster that'll happen." He shifts in the chair, looking for all the world like a man about to tell a story to a group of eager children. "Yer blood tests came back clean. So did that fella we got in ICU. Nobody's usin' drugs, which means y'all did whatever y'all did while clear-headed. And since we got a whole mess-a-prints on the guns in that bus - you's a bus driver, aincha?" he asks offhandedly to Garfield, before forging ahead "- we're basically waitin' on Rodney to wake up an' tell us just what went on." Then he sits back again with a smile.

Edward sits back. Well. That wasn't So Bad. The trooper didn't know anything that's too incriminating, and what he may recall is pretty much blotted out by the fact Drake pulled the gun off and popped him. Good. Nothing to fully worry about.

Garfield says, "I'm kinda wonderin' what the officer will say myself. What happened in the bus, kid? I mean after he started noddin' off and I quit tryin' to fix the battery, I went and locked my ass in the bathroom--nice metal door, that. When the garage lady opened the door and hustled me outside in the morning, I saw the police car an' thought everything was in hand, thank Christ, but then there was this shot and everything _really_ went to hell..."

_I appreciate you putting the ball back in my court, old man._ Edward shakes his head. "The trooper asked us to sit down, and then noticed our guns, and I wanted to know what the situation was. I was hoping he'd called backup, because I was sitting right Beside the nutcase. And then he flips out, and shoots the officer. And then he took his gun and went for the clerk. I had to patch the trooper up; he was going into shock, at the time. Luckily there was a first aid box on the bus."

Something crosses the trooper's face, a glimmering recognition of that all-too-rare commodity, The Truth. He smiles and nods. "Alright. Guys, here's what I'm gonna do. We're gonna have to keep ya here for a few more hours, at which time ol' Rod should be wakin' up. And after that, I'll see if I can send ya home." He rises, apparently ready to leave.

Edward lays back in the bed. _Good. Things seem well tied together. If the trooper tries to refute, I've allready said everything he could have, and how it 'really' was. I'm off the hook. Now, I have things I Need To Do. That paper..._

Garfield nods. "Great, thanks. Just hope my boss is too busy fightin' with the insurance guys to blame me..." He grins crookedly.

The trooper takes his leave, talking quietly with someone outside the door. Then he leans back in and comments offhandedly, "Phone works. Feel free to call family an' whoever." And he's gone, again.

Garfield blinks after the departed figure. "What family?" he says softly. "Doubt the woman would care one bit about any o' this..." He glances over at the kid. "Well, that's another day almost done. Another night in a hospital; oh, joy. I remember the last time I was in one--not a pleasant night. Place is bad enough in the daytime." He keeps his voice carefully neutral.

Edward simply nods his head, and lays back a little bit. "I might as well call Riley." He eases out of bed, and walks over to the phone, punching in his number.

Garfield brightens momentarily. "Hey, he said my blood was clean. Think that means my cholesterol's come down?"

"Hello?" "Riley, it's Ed. Don't panic. I was in the accident yesterday with the bus, but I'm fine. Just a little smoke inhilation and bumps, nothing more. There was some hubub last night, and I'm in Boring." "Boring? What the hell, Ed, yo-" "Things are fine, Riley. Just a little complication with the hospital. So... um... Where were you, last night?" "What? I went to the bar down teh street." "Right... Okay. I should be home tomorrow."

"You hope," Garfield puts in, sour once again.

Edward glares over his shoulder. "Okay, okay Ed." "Right, I'll see you, Riley. I'm fighting through red tape, at the moment. I'll see you." "Later." He hangs up the phone, and sags back into bed.

Garfield pats a hip flask reassuringly, and prays this night will be nowhere near as long as the last. He leans back and stares at the ceiling, waiting to see what nightfall will bring.

Nightfall. Outside the window, the shadows of trees across the lawn can be seen stretching out over the grass, until finally they fade away with the light of day. The room feels as quiet and confining as ever. Something about the newspaper, discarded on the side of the bed, catches Garfield's eye for a moment. Maybe just a trick of the light.

Edward looks out the window, regarding the night in consideration. _I hope we don't have another episode. That was just... a nightmare. A fluke. No sense in it happening again, right?_ He casts a look towards Garfield.

Brow furrowed, Garfield reaches for the paper. _Hmm...?_ he thinks idly. _What's that?_

Outside on the darkened lawn of the hospital grounds, a figure moves. Edward and Garfield's attention are both drawn to it, and as it turns a surprising resemblance is noted. Is that Drake out there?

Edward eases out of bed, and moves to the window, squinting through.

_Couldn't be..._ Garfield thinks dismissively, and looks closer at the paper.

Meanwhile...

In his room, arm and leg bandaged, Drake can only stare at a blurred pattern which may be the ceiling, or his own eyelids. His ears, sharpened by the darkness, can hear the shuffling of feet. A faint ruddy glow makes itself known in the bottom-left corner of his vision - a light in the hospital or OR, maybe - and a quiet mumbling grows more audible. The words are indistinct, as though heard underwater, and Drake can feel a hand on his injured leg.

In the room where Edward and Garfield have their being, the two men are staring out the window at the figure which disappears off into the trees. The treetops move briefly, inspired by a breath of wind from the north, then fall still again. Nobody else, and nothing else, can be seen outside.

A closer inspection of the newspaper reveals nothing out of the ordinary. The stories are all the same, the content.. perhaps it looks a little dirtier, with more jagged letters, but that's probably a consequence of the changing light levels outside.

Edward shakes his head, starting to get a little restless. Or perhaps, somewhere in his conciousness, a little spooked. "When is that cop going to wake up?" He mutters, and moves to the door. "Officer?"

Silence is all that answers Ed's inquiry.

Garfield shrugs and tosses the paper back on the bed. He gets up and walks to the door. "So," he mutters, and follows the kid, "let's see how hard God is laughin' tonight..."

Edward isn't up for this tonight. He yanks open the door, and looks out into the hallway.

The corridors beyond are empty and silent.

Edward swears. "Figures."

Garfield pats him on the shoulder. "Life's a bitch. You'll learn that when you grow up. Meanwhile, I gotta pee."

Edward shakes his head. "This means we're going to do this all over again... I'm going home. That's all there is to it. Now, where's a firearm?"

Garfield grabs his arm. "Don't be a fool. You feel like being charged with escaping custody in the morning and everything's back, nice 'n fuckin' normal? If we're not here when the sun comes up, there'll be hell to pay."

Edward points out the window. "Yeah? And that was a zombie on the lawn, how much do you want to bet. You want to stay here and let them just bounce in here?"

"At this point, we've got no idea exactly how much our nightly actions affect the daytime," Garfield retorts. "The bus was taken and torn up, and it was still torn up in the day. We didn't wake up in that other hospital, we woke up in the gas station. Think the cops'll like you if you're not here in the morning? Think they'll forget about Mr. Gutshot Cop? You wanna stay safe, that's fine. Not like I'm gonna argue that. But barricading yourself in somewhere here and heading back to this room in the morning is gonna be as safe as trying to make your way home and locking yourself in your apartment."

Edward eyes the old man. "You're not as stupid as our bullet-riddled 'friend' thinks you are. I know, that it will look bad. But there aren't that many good places to bunker down in a Hospital. And at the very least, I'd like something to use as a defense. There has to be a fire axe around here somewhere..." He trails off, before looking back at Garfield. "You think Drake's on 'our side'?"

"Damned if I know," Garfield replies. "But he's here somewhere and I got a feelin' that if he bites the dust, he's gonna come lookin' for me as a bloody zombie. I ain't bein' neighbourly to the bastard, but I still think we should go find him and see."

Drake abruptly walks in the door. There's a look of bemusement on his face. It looks like part of that might be because his arm and leg seem to be completely healed. He quickly spots Ed and Gar. "So. You are still here. And, like before, the only ones." he says sardonically.

Garfield looks him over, trying to keep from looking like his heart stopped for a good three seconds. "Well, well," he replies, scowling. "Miracles of modern medicine, hey?"

Edward regards Drake a moment, looking him over, and frowning. "Okay, hold on one damn minute." Thinking rather hard, "Drake, I have a bad feeling that when dawn comes, your going to be in a lot of pain."

Drake shrugs. "Maybe. Or maybe I'm dead, and in hell. And since you two jokers are here, there would be some weight to that notion."

Edward says, "But we're not dead yet." He walks out into the hall. "Well, then that's that. Let's go find the X-Ray lab."

Garfield glances at the kid. "Yeah, but somehow I think if we're killed tonight, we still won't just wake at dawn. I ain't too keen on testin' that notion." He stares hard at Drake. "Look, I'm gonna be right here come morning. If you wanna bugger off before the sun comes up and get away from the cops that way, go right ahead."

Drake snorts. "What's the point? You're not going to find anyone. You know that." he calls after Edward. He turns to look at Gar. "It's crossed my mind. I'm still trying to decide if I want to see if a fat man bounces when he hits the ground." he says bitingly.

Edward turns on his heel. "I don't care, the walls in the X-Ray lab are thick, and the doors are lockable. No one's getting in and out of it. And Drake, go. There's no sense in killing him. You shot the Trooper because you would get caught. We shot you because we thought you were going to do it to us. You do it now, and it's in cold blood, and I don't think that's what you do. Now when sunlight comes, you're a wanted man. Better get a jumpstart on time."

Drake arches a brow. "You've got sand, Ed."

Garfield smiles grimly. "No more 'n some hopped up punk. Think I haven't mixed it up a hundred times before?"

Garfield says, "Yeah, but he ain't that bright. The flip side is that come morning you could again be bleedin' out--but in some car or alley or other hole instead of a nice, clean hospital with caring medical staff looking after your every need."

Garfield smirks nastily. "Feel lucky?"

Drake knows they're right about getting a jumpstart on time. But they might also be right about his injuring returning to normal when dawn breaks. _Makes as much sense as anything else._ He doesn't answer Gar's jibes. And when the two head to the lab, he follows. He doesn't know why. But everything's turned topsy turvy already. So he's going with his gut, for now.

Edward nods to Drake. "There's no point in fighting. Look at the fact you'- Gar, Shut up." He flings his hand at Drake, "I'm asking him not to make you swallow those stained teeth. I can stop, because you don't deserve much help. Suck it up, or I'll just walk off and he can waste the second chance he has on your ass."

Garfield scowls. "Yeah, whatever." He pushes his way out into the hall. "Bloody X-Ray lab--what're we gonna do, kill 'em with cancer?"

The scurrying sound of feet can be heard, echoing somewhere in the corridors of the hospital

Drake perks at that. "Fuck. Looks like running is out of the question anyway. The freaks are already in the building."

Garfield looks sharply around. "Company's coming. Who forgot to call everyone and tell 'em dinner's cancelled?"

Edward says, "We're going to lock ourselves in." He halts. "Fuck. Too bad we can't wall up with a gun. C'mon."

Edward adds, "If nothing else, we pray the elevator works, and stop it in between levels."

The X-Ray lab is on the first floor, with many of the rooms, and easy to reach - it's not terribly large, but it is terribly well-guarded. At the moment, as expected, it's abandoned, and the trio make their cautious way inside.

Aside from three sets of lungs processing air, the only other sound to be heard here is the faint hum of machinery.

Edward phews. "I was worried about us locking ourselves in with the unliving in here." He turns, and closes the door, looking for the locking mechanism.

The door is easily secured.

"Wonderful," Garfield states dryly. "So, who feels safe enough to get some shut-eye?"

Drake looks around. "Not a bad idea, Ed." he comments. But he also looks around to see if there's a table or machinery that can be wedged against the door. "And...I got some good rest...you two can sleep, if you want."

Edward looks at his watch. "Well, we need to wake up at some point to shuffle on back to our rooms when the world comes alive. Let's see... I'd say dawn is about seven?"

The best prop that Drake's searching eyes can find is a light chair - not much comfort.

Drake wedges the chair in place. If it's the best they can do...

"Uh," Garfield ventures, "they're probably not lined up six deep out there just yet. Why don't we just go get something a bit more sturdy then that thing?"

Edward considers this, while setting the time on his watch's alarm for 5:30. "Well, you can," he comments as he looks at the door. "But, I'm locking the door when you go out, and unlocking when you come back. While you do that, I'm going to make sure the lungs are off, so they're suitable to lay in."

Drake scratches his chin. "I think the better thing to do would be to block some of the accesses to the lab, if we can. So there isn't a clear path."

Drake unlocks the door, and moves outside. "There going to be someone awake to let me back in?"

Edward stands beside the doorway. "Go ahead; I'll be waiting here. If you meet some undead, yell. Loud."

Garfield says, "Yell. Loud. That I can do."

Drake smirks. "I'll hope it's not because they're gnawing on me." He dissapears and gets to work.

Garfield follows Drake and steps outside again. "And I'm off to see the wizard... lovely." He looks around for a bathroom first, however.

Edward locks the door, and leans against it with a sigh. _Here's to hoping we make it uneventful through the night._

Drake considers gonig to find his lockpicks, but those could be anywhere. He locks what doors he can, but most of then require keys, and there's no latch he can tunr on one side of the door. Those he can't lock, he blocks with chairs andfurniture and gurneys.

Garfield looks after the vanished form of Drake, weighing if it'd be safer sticking with him or staying away. _Away,_ he decides. His bladder makes its presence felt, and he moves off, keeping an eye open for signs to the nearest toilet.

The bus-driver's passage through the halls back from the rest-room is disturbed only by the repeated sound of footfalls, moving swiftly and steadily in the distance.

Drake takes a moment, in the process to smoke. It's been hours since he's had one, and he feels himself getting a little jittery. He then starts looking around for a janitors closet, seeing if he can find any flammable liquids.

Washroom found, Garfield answers the call of Nature. Sighing, he considers his next move. _Can't get a good bat, but they likely wouldn't miss a mop, I think. Janitor's room, I guess..._

Drake is rummaging through the cleaning supplies when Garfield shows up. It's greek to him, but he takes a few jugs and bottles of this and that with him. _Maybe the geek can reccomend something._ He's also collecting rags and empty bottles. He ignores Gar when he shows up.

"Dunno if I hope you're plannin' on drinkin' any o' that or not," Garfield comments. He pokes his head into the small room and eyes the collection of fearsome cleaning implements before selecting a sturdy mop. "Just the thing to wipe 'em out with, heh?" he says cheerfully.

Drake smirks humorlessly. "If you plan to get that close. I'm trying to think of something more useful." he wheels the cart back to the lab, and raps on the door.

Edward listens intently. "Drake?" He calls out.

"No, Mila Jojovitch."

Drake smirks.

Edward says, "Good. I could use a congical visit." He opens the door, and peers at the cart. "What's that for?"

Drake flicks his lighter, in that common nervous twitch. "Ever make molotov cocktails, Ed?"

"Not much of a drinker." Edward says this with a straight face, before snorting, looking over the cart. "There's one problem with this theory. You set a zombie on fire, it keeps walking. Then you have a flaming corpse wanting to hug you."

Drake shrugs. "We have no guns. If we need a weapon, this is the best I can come up with."

Edward shakes his head. "WEll, we'll need to do something with it in the morning." But, he sits down, and does what he needs, mixing this and that - carefully - given how this room is closed in. The fumes could be dangerous. Poking the rags in, he nods. "There."

Drake nods. "Kay. Now at least we have something. I did what I could...but I'm not that sleepy. You two go ahead as conk out. I'll wait and see what happens."

Edward simply nods, and moves to shut off the lungs. No need to have the radiation machines on. Then simply crawls on in.

Looks up and down the empty corridor and then into the janitor's room again. He takes a second mop, just in case. _Now to find a wheeled bed or something. Probably gonna be a long night... So, where's the ER, hey?_ And as well armed as a certain space hero, he quickly starts following more signs.

Another sound of footfalls makes itself known to the bus driver. They sound closer.

Garfield halts suddenly. _What's that expression about the better part of valour? Back to X-Ray, pronto._

Garfield's steps don't slow as the reassuring door to the X-Ray room comes into sight. In fact, he almost sprints the last few steps. With a nervous glance over his shoulder, he drops one of the mops and knocks--well, pounds--on the door. "Open up, please!"

Drake is still awake when Gar gets back, and lets him in wordlessly. He doesn't seem able to hold onto his anger. What's the point? He relocks the door once he's inside, and sits on the floor, leaning agaisnt a wall.

Garfield looks sourly at the floor, but decides that the floor and a sore back are a better combination than a nice bed and ripped up flesh. He hunkers down, resolving to just doze, not sleep outright. His mops are kept close at hand, and he ignores the comtemptous looks Drake sends them. His eyes close...

With things more or less settled, Drake takes a seat and Edward and Garfield make themselves as comfortable as circumstances permit. The hours begin to pass; one awake, thoughtful, two sleeping. As the night passes, the numb cold of the thief's arm and leg begin to pass. They aren't growing particularly warmer; perhaps he's just becoming accustomed to the sensation...

The night's silence is broken, near midnight, as seemingly a thousand hammering fists pound on the door and walls at once, a racket that would wake the dead. The relentless deluge of sound floods the room with its noise, and the door itself creaks under the strain...
