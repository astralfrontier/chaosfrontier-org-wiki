# Dead of Night 2003-01-28

The incessant racket of a thousand fists pounding on the door and the walls floods into the little room, feeling more and more little by the second.

Edward nearly slams his forehead into the iron lung's roof as the sounds come rushing in. _Fuck!_ Poking his head out, the room seems relatively fine. The door is atleast anchored down. A glance to the explosive materials. No way they could get the door open, chuck them out, and shut the door.

Drake sighs. "Well, this is it then, isn't it? We're zombie food." He seems resigned about it. "Unless we kill ourselves cleanly, there's really no bright spot to this, is there."

Meanwhile, Garfield's keen eyes, ever alert for alternate paths when driving in hazardous conditions, note the slight but unmistakeable evidence of a vent overhead. Alas, it looks fairly well bolted on.

Garfield stares upwards. "What's that dumb saying? Something outside the box? Outta this box would be good right now. Anyone see anything around to get that vent up there open?"

Edward looks upwards, and considers. "Damnit. We should have grabbed a fire axe while we were at it." He scoots a bit of the lab equipment over to the vent, before climbing up to inspect the vent. "Let's hope we're not stuck in the basement with the gas key, here."

"Think the slots are big enought to jam a lever in?" Garfield asks the kid.

Drake stares dumbly at the door as it shudders. And then, on impulse, he goes up and listens at the door. Wondering if they're saying anything intelligible.

While Edward struggles upwards, trying to keep his balance, the others are likewise casting around for something - anything - to use to help their escape. Upon closer inspection, the vent is affixed with four plastic hexnuts, painted to blend with the decor. There looks to be something beyond it.... but as the student inspects more closely, he feels the icy grip of dead fingers on his ankle. For just a moment.

Edward nearly topples backwards, and jerks his foot. A lance of terror leaps up his body, a glance downward at his ankle. Gripping the walls, squeezing eyes shut for a moment, "Looks like we can handle this. Too bad we can't get something to clamp down on it and pull. Maybe if we have something big enough to ram through it."

Garfield pokes at Edward with the tip of one of his mops. "Here, use this."

Drake pulls his head away from the door. Nothing useful. He sighs. "Blasted dead things. Just give me a machine gun and I'd mow them all down." he spits. "Why the fuck is this happening?"

Edward jerks as Garfield pokes him. "Watch it!" He snaps, grabbing the mop. After a second, "The balance here is off; I don't want to break my neck." He levels the mop's blunt end like a ram, and jabs it with all his strenght into the grate. "Because we're in hell."

Garfield glances at Drake. "God's laughing at us. Can't you hear it?"

The vent breaks open - better that than the cheap mop handle, which looks like it couldn't take much more abuse now. A few seconds later, the thundering wave of pounding outside the little room ceases - abruptly.

Garfield looks rapidly between the vent and the door. "That can't be good," he comments.

Edward stops. His head turns around, before looking back at the vent. "I don't like that." Tentively, he begins to prod the vent. "Not one bit."

"Here," Garfield says. "Use this and look around in there." He tosses the kid his Zippo.

Drake looks up. He's taken to sitting on the ground by the door. "Will any of us even fit through that things"

Edward barely catches it. He's seen this scene replayed in far, far too many movies. Either he'll hit a gas leak, or catch sight of something within the darkness before it feasts on his head. Great thoughts to have. He pushes the vent aside, prying it open, before flicking the zippo, and peering in.

Inside the vent is a screen - a mesh of some kind, probably part of the shielding for the lab. It looks like it hangs on four narrow corner supports, rather than being bolted in place, and it could be removed without too much difficulty.

At the same time Edward makes his discovery, the silence outside is broken. This time, the sound isn't the cacophony of a thousand fists, but simply three forceful, measured raps - somebody or something is.. knocking.

Edward arches upright. A **knocking?** He looks at his watch.

Garfield starts. "_Definitely_ not good..."

Drake looks up at the door. "Who's there?" he calls. He can't bring himself to be surprised.

In answer to the question, the knock is simply repeated. Thud. Thud. Thud.

Garfield says, "Either they're getting tricky for a bunch of things with rotted brains, or there's a head zombie or vampire or whatever out there -- which is probably worse. I say we go up."

Drake looks at the others. "Thudthudthud's at the door. Should I open it?"

Edward just stares at Drake. "See if it can understand Morse Code." This of course is offered with an underlaying sarcasm.

Drake snorts. "What do I look like? A boy scout? I don't know morse code myself."

As Drake looks back from the others to the door again, he becomes aware that something is very horribly askew. His arm - the wounded arm, the coldly restored and curiously functional arm, the arm that felt all this time like it was hanging loosely and correctly by his side, is reaching for the door. But it doesn't feel that way - by every sensation he can identify, Drake is certain it should be near his pocket.

"Drake, don't you Dare," Edward snarls from the machine's top. "They've gotten tricky, you moron." He says this while jabbing the mop into the vent, to clear the screen.

Drake looks at his arm. Now he **is** stunned. "It's not me!"

Drake tries to throw himself away from the door...

Garfield blinks dumbly for a second as he sees Drake reach for the door. "Damned idiot!" He runs to intercept the movement. "You _want_ to kill us?"

The wounded leg collapses under Drake, and he feels a sharp bolt of pain course through it as he collides with Garfield. Both men fall to the floor, and both are barely missed by the leading edge of the vent-block as it tumbles from the ceiling and bounces off the floor inches from their faces. And again, outside, the drum-like knocking sounds thrice.

Drake hisses at Garfield. "If you want to live, fat boy, I suggest you hold me down. Because I can't control my body."

Edward lights the zippo again, while looking around in the vent. Cautiously. While listening for anything crawling through.

Garfield pins Drake. "Like I need you to tell me that! This is a hell of a time for an 'evil hand' routine!"

Nothing seems to be coming through the vent but air. It's clear of obstructions.

Garfield stares down at him. "Wait -- isn't that the arm that I blew away?"

"When you boys are done rolling around on the floor," Edward calls down, "Why don't you give me a hand. The vent seems clear."

Drake blinks. "Uh....I guess so...I dunno...no, you're right..."

Garfield mutters, "Lovely. So the insta-cure isn't with a price, it seems. I'm letting you up--slowly!--so try not to do anything..."

Edward says, "Take his gun."

Drake nods. "No arguments from me."

Garfield looks up. "What gun?"

Drake snorts. "No gun, Ed. They don't usually arrest people and let them keep their guns. Good thought, though."

Edward nods to Drake. "Right. I just don't want your hand being playful again and cap us in the process."

Garfield says, "Okay, I'm letting you up, now." And does so, carefully as he can.

Drake tests his arm. "Seems okay, now. But you guys should probably try to get out of here."

Edward shakes his head. "If that episode ment anything, you'll likely fall over by the end of the night. You're helpless. Can't let you die without defending us first." He grins a little. "Now, c'mon."

Garfield scowls at Drake. "Kid's got a point -- you're another body between us and the zombies. You're coming along."

Drake shakes his head. "You guys might be safer without me...not like I care, but...you know..."

Garfield offers, "We can always use you as a suicidal diversion."

Drake grins humorlessly. "Oh, well, as long as you have a plan."

"Yeah, and we may be saved by the Cheerleader Ninja Squad," The kid snorts. "I'm not making choices on an 'If'. And Garfield's right. Old man, drag him up here."

Drake sighs. "I can stand." he picks himself up, dusts himself off.

Edward says, "Good. Now, boost me up here."

Garfield says, "Let's get you up there first, kid. But if you step on my face, I swear I'll bite your ankle..."

Edward places the zippo into the vent, bracing himself in waiting. "It would be an improvement."

A third knock sounds at the door, fainter than the others, as the trio begin making their way up into the ventilation system...

The three last men on Earth make their way into the ventilation system and start climbing, spurred on by what waits for them back in the lab. In a particularly twisty vertical part of the vents, Drake's leg gives out again - painfully. It takes the efforts of Garfield and Edward to pull him along, and slowly the human chain continues making its way though the dark confines of the shafts..

After what feels like hours of crawling, three pained and bruised bodies emerge from an access point outside the hospital. They face the empty helipad, the side-road leading around to the emergency entrance, and a grove of trees - the same trees through which Edward and Garfield earlier saw a figure darting.

Drake lays down on the grass, groaning slightly in pain. "great. We're out. Can I lay down and let the zombies take me, now?"

Edward breathes in some fresh air, and slowly, carefully crawls out. "Okay. We have some choices. The patrol car may be out front with the weapons. And we can't run to far for the same reason we were going to stick around."

Garfield massages bruised knees and elbows after he almost but not quite falls to the ground. "So, now that we're out, how about we go back in and round up some Tylenol-3s?"

Garfield nods. "Looking for a cop car is a decent idea, but I wouldn't hold my breath. However, there's bound to be other cars around that we can, uh, borrow for a quick getaway, should the zombies decide to leave the hospital. We just need to be back by sun-up."

Drake grunts, and slowly gets to his feet. "What the fuck. Let's go for it. Nothing better to do. Besides, I'd feel better armed."

Garfield says, "As long as you hold the gun in your 'good' hand." He coughs and offers a weak smile. "Sorry."

Edward stretches his joints. "Right. Well, it looks like I should be doing the scouting." He scowls. "I'm likely faster then either of you. If you see something, scream."

Drake eyes Garfield wryly. "That's no guarantee of your safety." he says under his breath as he sluggishly moves towards the road.

Edward proceeds to lead the way ahead, jogging as quietly as he can, while moving toward the front of the building.

Edward is certainly glad there's no corpses roaming. For a moment, he's hesitant about having a cadaver come to carve Him up. Wouldn't that be irony? Spotting the patrol cars, the student moves as swiftly as he might, before testing the door.

Garfield smiles nastily as he trudges alongside Drake. "Ah, it's comments like that that almost make me glad Ed's shot put you off balance so I mostly missed when I unloaded my barrel..."

Drake just goes slow and steady, not putting any undue pressure on his wounded leg. He wonders, now, who was knocking. And in the back of his mind, he already knows. "Death." he says aloud.

Garfield catches his meaning instantly. "Wasn't God, I don't think, but either way, I'm happy we put off the introductions."

Edward grumbles as he discovers the door is locked. Of course. Turning back, "Drake," He hisses. "Give me your jacket."

Drake shrugs, and takes off his leather jacket, tosses it to Ed.

Edward wraps the jacket around his elbow, and slams it into the car window.

Edward, promptly shattering the window, pulls his arm back to run the jacket along, knocking out the glass. Unlocking the door, opening, he leans in to look for any weapons that might be harbored inside.

Edward claims his shotgun, and shuts the door with relative quietness. Turning back to the others, "Well, don't just stand there."

Drake sighs. He can't seem to manage any emotion about this. "Okay, okay..." He grabs his jacket, and moves over to the other cruiser, trying to smash its window as well.

Drake abruptly forgets and uses his injured arm. The pain briefly sends him to his knees as he fails to mash the window.

Edward just sighs, and moves over to butt the window with the shotgun's haft. While holding the barrel parralel to his body.

Drake groans as he slowly tries to get to his feet. "Why didn't I think of that."

Shattering the glass, Ed unlocks the door and retrieves the other boom-stick. He passes it on to the criminal. "Here. Now, back into the hospital, or shall we make a run for somewhere else?"

Drake takes it, and checks the action. He also roots around for spare shell anywhere. "Your call, Eddy-boy. Seems to be the general consensus is to stick around here, so the pigs don't come looking for you come morning..."

Garfield comments to Drake, "I think you're a bad influence on the kid..." He scowls at the damaged cars. "I hope we don't have to answer for this tomorrow."

Drake snorts. "Bite me." he informs Garfield.

Edward just smirks at Garfield, before waving the shotgun. "What about these, eh? We'll have to do something with them, perferably stashing them in an empty hospital room or broom closet come morning, when we go back to our rooms." He looks over at Drake. "You want to get out of here?"

Garfield starts to retort that shotguns are more effective than teeth, then remembers this time he's not the one with the firearm. He shrugs, then instead asks non-chalantly, "How's the arm?"

Drake ignores Garfield. "What I want is to find out what the fuck is going on here. I figure I'm half dead already. And whatever is behind this is in there somewhere." he points at the hospital. "So I'm going Death-hunting. You boys are free to tag along." He starts limping into the hospital.

What Drake sees through the glass doors as he peers inside is not encouraging. Silhouetted in the dim operating lights of the hospital, heads rise over shoulders in a black wave of slow movement. A couple dozen figures can be made out, wreathed in shadow, but nothing clear can be seen.

Garfield looks at Edward. "He goin' on that suicidal diversion, y'think? Or you goin' with him?"

Drake stares at them. "Why are they just standing there, do you think? Do they not know we're uot here?"

Edward looks out after DRake, and hears his tone. "Okay. Let's move. I'd like to run some experiments on the walking dead, but not while they're inmasse."

The ripple of motion inside continues unabated; the black bodies shuffle in place, seemingly impatient to move, but nevertheless motionless.

"So go in an' ask 'em," Garfield suggests to Drake. "You thinkin' with your arm again?"

Drake sighs. "Look, get ready to run, okay?" He moves up to the doors, shotgun pointed.

Edward stares. "Uh... Remember how fast they moved back when we were on the bus?" He shakes his head. "Drake, I have a better idea."

Garfield says, "Christ." He turns to the kid. "I think you should go hotwire one of those cruisers."

Drake stops in mid rush. "I'm all ears, kid."

Edward nods his head. "Right. I had a thought..." Moving back to one of the cruisers, he opens the door again, and begins to hotwire it.

Drake sighs, staring at the mass of zombies, trying to see if he can make out anything useful. He dislikes just standing there. Live, or die, he's a man of action.

Edward brings the car to life, and gets into the driver's seat. He drives the car back, and gets it in line with the doors. Finding a nightstick, he pokes his head out of the window. "Move out of the way."

Garfield shouts, "That's not what I had in mind when I asked you to hotwire it!"

Drake blinks, and moves. "Huh. Nice idea."

Nevertheless, Garfield quickly moves aside.

Edward grits his teeth. All right, it's time to be a little daring. He'd normally never do something this stupid, but... Taking the night stick, he props it up against the gas pedal, and presses the other end against the seat. Getting into a position where the kid can kick his foot down, wedge the stick into the pedal, and leap out of the open door. "Okay... One... Two... Go." He steps down on the night-stick, until he feels the car lurch. And then jumps out.

The car races forward. Inside the hospital, motion can be seen immediately - bodies moving this way and that, fleeing the oncoming attack randomly. The cruiser smashes through the front doors and glass showers everywhere. Inside the hospital, the sound of its engine can still be heard at a high whine, as tires squeal and the sounds of crashing can be heard. Then all is still, except for the screech of protesting rubber against immovable floor - the car's hit a barrier it can't break through. From out of the destroyed doors, the animate dead pour in an unending stream.

Edward, standing on the road, watches as the zombies come out. "Well damn. Now it's time to run."

Drake sighs. "Cool idea, though." He breaks into a lurching run.

Garfield isn't watching. He just runs for the second cruiser.

Swearing, Edward starts to run for the second cruiser himself. Though he doubts he'll make it there before the zombies.

"Brilliant, kid!" Garfield calls out. _When did college kids get so dumb?_ "Now toss me your shotgun and wire the other cruiser before we get ripped to shreds!"

Edward, as he pushes himself into a charge, holds out the boomstick as he moves towards the bus driver. "Grab it!"

Garfield regretfully drops his mop and reaches for the firearm. _Against one or two, I'll take a mop sure, but it's useless against a damn horde..._ He spins and levels the weapon at the oncoming zombies, hoping Drake will be standing beside him this time, not against him.

Edward skiddes to the car, and yanks the door open, while diving in. _C'mon, C'mon, C'mon!_

Drake does not appear to be arguing. He levels the shotgun, and starts unloading into the oncoming zombies...

The car roars to life thanks to Ed's quick fingers and growing skill.

Drake doesn't wait. "Hurry, fat ass, lets get in!" He opens the rear door and climbs into the cruiser.

Edward rolles into the driver's seat. "Okay! Get in!"

Edward taps his hands on the steering wheel, while foot itches for the peddle.

Garfield says, "Brillint, kid!" This time he means it. He dives in after Drake. "Go!"

Edward slams on the gas, and turning the wheel, Goes. Yes, he goes indeed, right out of the parking lot. A quick look at his watch.

Clawing hands reach for the ankles of the two men who make their way ungracefully into the purloined vehicle, and in a rush of exhaust and the whine of a protesting engine, Edward drives his stolen steel steed out into the night, away from the hospital.

Garfield says, "Keep an eye out for another ride. Remember how the bus just died on us?"

Edward nods his head. "Right, right. We need to find a backup, at a defensable point. Then hook it up and Go before sunrise."

Drake is, in the meantime, thinking. "Where did this accident happen? The one where lard ass got drunk and killed a bunch of people in the bus crash?"

Garfield stares at Drake coldly. "I - did - not - get - drunk."

Drake waves a hand. "Right, right, you were sober and killed a bunch of people in a bus crash. Whatever. Where was it?"

Edward thinks back. "I'd say two days ago? The day we were in the hospital with you, or before then?"

Drake says, "I'm talking where, not when. Where did the crash take place?"

Edward thinks back, before shaking his head. "I... don't remember." A Look over his shoulder, "Gar?"

Garfield wants to strangle Drake. "A fucking crane knocked the bus off the road. It wasn't my fault. It was probably two days ago, unless we were unconscious for multiple days afterward. And it was near a construction site on 82nd Ave."

Drake nods thoughtfully. "Okay...take us there, Ed."

Edward looks over at Drake for a moment, before simply following orders. There's little reason to do it otherwise.

Garfield sighs. "And the car will break down halfway to the city."

The accident site at 82nd has been cleaned up by the city's hard-working corps of engineers. Edward tools the cruiser around the deserted area easily enough, permitting convenient inspection.

Drake chuckles at Gar. "Apparently not. Now, isn't that interesting? Stop the car, Ed."

Edward leaves the vehicle running, while sticking his head out of the window. He doesn't feel safe turning the engine off, or leaving the car unprotected. "Who's staying with the car?"

Garfield says, "So the damn cop car works by my bus breaks down?" He sounds aggrieved. He glances heavenwards. "Quit laughing you!"

"Since we're here, I'm lookin' around," Garfield states. He looks distastefully at the shotgun, but doesn't relinquish it.

Drake gets out of the car. "I want to see what's out there. Why don't you stay with the car. If I find anything, I'll give a holler."

Drake doesn't feel the need to say anything further, or wait, so he moves into the crash site, looking around. He pokes things with his shotgun. And sighs in frustration as he finds nothing. "Fuck. Felt like a good idea when I had it."

Edward sticks his head out of the window, after waiting. He'd like to have looked but... "Drake, what is it you were looking for?"

Drake sighs, leaning on the car. "Something, anything. maybe another lantern. It's just...all we're doing is running and hiding, and it doesn't seem to be getting us anywhere. I want...I want there to be some logic behind this. I want to know who's fucking with our lives. This...this can't be jsut some random act."

Garfield wanders around, feeling increasingly nausous at the signs of the crash, the twisted metal, the disturbed earth, the burned ground. He refuses to stare upwards at the giant yellow crane, afraid the sight of it would goad him into something stupid. He walks quickly back to the care. "Get me out of here. I feel sick just being here."

There was another reason he wasn't arguing about staying in the car. Edward didn't really feel like getting out, himself. "I know how you feel, Drake. Get in. We need to go somewhere."
