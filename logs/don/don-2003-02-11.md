# Dead of Night 2003-02-11

The car ride back to Legacy is uneventful - thankfully - and quiet - not unexpectedly. The deserted shops, buildings, apartments, homes, and parks pass by the car's windows as the confused trio drive on.

Edward taps his fingers on the back of the wheel. "I don't get this. There are no clues, no obvious idea of what's going on, why we're here."

Garfield stares morosely out a window. "We survived this far into the night. That's gotta count for somethin'."

Drake seems, overall, frustrated. Tired. "Cept that death knocks." he comments. Edward nods. "Keep your eyes open for availible cars, in case this one dies easily." He pays attention to the car, looking for taletell signs incase it dies too far from availible cars; walking in zombie infested streets to find a suitable car isn't good. "We're going back to the hospital. But we need some more firearms."

Drake looks at Edward. "I'll stay with you till an hour before dawn...but then I'm out of here. I'll be back out front of the hospital at sunset tonight...assuming I'm not dead."

Garfield looks disgusted. "I'd really rather not keep guns around, but I can see the point. Keeping a stash of them for... nocturnal use would be a good idea."

The car drives past houses and other structures, nestled into the inky depths of the omnipresent shadows. Streetlights that each man remembers being well-lit flicker here and there or shine wanly, or in many cases not at all.

Edward nods to Garfield. "Right. We need to atleast clear the hospital." A sidelong glance at Drake, "And, we need to find a good place for you to hide before sunset. You'll no doubt be hurting by morning, so some painkillers and bracers work for something. I figure we can put the weapons somewhere like a dumpster outside, out back."

Garfield says, "'Til they get taken to a dump, o' course..."

Edward clucks his tongue. "Only if it's garbage day. They do not empty them daily. By tomorrow we will be out of the hospital, and can atleast return for the cache at a reasonable hour." After a moment, "Y'know, it's a shame we're going to have to hide in the hospital solely; I'd love to get my hands on one of those corpses and do some tests on it. The equipment in there would work well enough."

Drake tilts his head at Ed. "Why do you care?" He doesn't say it hostilely. He's more curious than anything.

Edward looks back over. "Care about what?"

Garfield scowls at him. "'Cause there might be a method to this madness? 'Cause if it ain't God doin' this, it'd be nice to find out who so I can strangle the son of a bitch? 'Cause we ain't got anythin' better to do other than staying alive?"

"About whether or not I find a safe place to hide. Or, much less...if I'm in pain or not. I suppose I can get the whole 'I'm in this with you', deal...but doesn't seem like you'd care about my overall state of well being. Considering you shot me and all." Drake murmurs. He's not even sure why he's asking. In the past, he wouldn't have even cared.

Edward smirks absently. "God is a very morbid scientist, Garf, or he doesn't exist. But, the more we know about these things, the better off we are. If we could figure out how they detect prey, then we can figure ways to avoid them. If their only sense is sight, that's one thing. But what about their nose? Their responses, their brain is something worth examining..." He glances over at Drake.

Edward chuckles a little at Drake. "Well, you know how to kill things efficenty, and get us into places where we can't otherwise. Yes, you're in this with us, but three is better then two, and that really helps when it's us against the world, right? Me, I'd prefer to be out of this little time delation and go back to my regular life, but I really can't until I know more about this place. So, that means surviving via the best means, and that includes keeping you breathing, not in jail, and with us. And we shot you because we thought One, we were next, and Two, it was our ticket out of jail." A sharkish smile. "Don't tell me you'd pass the blame to avoid getting jailed, eh?"

Garfield returns to staring out the window, feeling an odd combination of boredom and depression. "But where do they come from? Do they just appear like everyone seems to disappear? Or did they come from the hospital's morgue?" He looks around. "Is anyone else hungry? I don't think we had what you'd call a proper supper."

Edward chuckles a little wryly. "Leave it up to grampa back there to be hungry when we're on the conversation of flesh eating corpses. But yes, food would be good."

Garfield blinks. "They eat flesh? When did that happen?"

Drake's expression is neutral. "You can believe whatever you like. My plan was to kill him to get us all out of here."

Drake jerks a thumb. "Even fat boy."

Drake says, "Just because I'm a criminal, doesn't mean I don't have values."

"An' just 'cuase it'd mean flushin' our lives down the crapper didn't really matter, hey?" Garfield retorts.

Edward says, "Assumption. They're zombies. They slavor at the mouth after us. Brains, flesh, tickle us, they want us for some odd reason. Good enough." A smirk at Drake. "Yes, true, but then you would have killed yourself to avoid jail. Now you're telling me that you would only have tried to get us all out? Use an example of the past, if you want." A dismissive gesture. "From where we stood, we were screwed, or we could just screw you."

"Say what you want 'bout zombies, but at least they don't use guns. Cops do." Garfield finishes.

Drake shrugs. "I'm not going to explain myself to you. But I'm not going to argue with your concern for the crook among you." He smirks humorlessly.

Edward gives an absent nod. "Right, then. Now, let's get back to the hospital. Who says we get more ammo?"

Drake shrugs. "We can try knocking off another pawn shop...of course, I don't have my lockpicks." He then gets an idea. "Maybe there's a keygun in this cruiser?"

"A what?" Garfield asks.

Drake starts searching the car. "It's a device the cops use. Faster and easier than lockpicks. They might have one in here...be a longshot. But maybe we find something else useful."

Edward nods. "Well, then let's go find one, and then head back to the hospital."

Garfield looks sour. "Yum. More hospital food." He returns to staring out he window. "An' I bet they ain't even liquor licensed..."

The little car pulls back into the medical center's parking lot, having stopped by another pawn shopfor a quick re-arming. The engine is coughing a bit and driving the vehicle is a bit more sluggish. The cruiser's nose is still wedged through the front door. On further inspection, though, Edward notices something perhaps good, perhaps bad..

A body appears trapped under the car. A dead body, but one that's been dead for a very long time. It has but one eye; on the other side is an empty, decayed socket. It writhes now and then, like a fish on the hook.

Garfield gets out of the car and stares loathingly a the zombie. "Ask and ye shall receive, kid. Now try askin' for a steak and a pitcher of beer."

Edward rubs his hands together, kneeling down a little over the body. "All right. A specimen." He looks over the zombie, nodding. "Okay, I'm going to need to either restrain the arms, or cut them off. But cutting them off may damage the nerve system too much to have a good specimen. Damn. We have to move it first... Hm. What do you two think?"

Drake hefts a shotgun in one hand, with a revolver in the back of his pants. "Considering what we've encountered so far? Not much. Maybe you just managed to nail one."

Drake then looks sheepish. "oh. You mean about moving the body."

Edward nods his head. "Right. I want to restrain it. I'll need a gourney. Maybe unload some shells into it's hands to keep it from inflicting any damage. Duct-tape the mouth, maybe." A shake of his head. "First, I need to find a lab. We leave this one here."

Drake waves a hand. "Wait. Hold off. let's make sure wwe're not in imminent danger." He moves towards the doors of the hospital, checking for shamblnig zombies.

Edward hms. "It's a shame I don't have anything live to use as bait. No rabbits, mice, nothing. Unless there's something in the lab." He nods to Drake. "Right. But, for now, let's make sure there's a clear path, and we get our gourney."

"Well that answers the question for what Drake thinks." Garfield looks amused. "--Not much," he concludes with Drake safely out of earshot. "As for me, I'm thinkin' handcuffs. Assuming we're strong enough to cuff it -- and if we're not, this is pointless anyway."

The hospital seems quiet. Drake does a quick, cautious survey, then moves further into the building. A few minutes later he returns. Aside from the single trapped zombie under the cruiser, there is.. well, no sign at all of anything, alive, dead or other, anywhere in the building or its environs.

Drake grimaces. "Strange. Maybe they're in the city." He lowers the gun and starts looking for a gurney.

Edward grins at Garfield. "Perfect. Behind it's back. We'll shoot the shoulder first, dislocate it, that way we can get the arm behind." Rubbing his fingers, "Good good."

Edward stands up. "Then we bring it in, and I start poking it with reason. The thing will likely be very useful for us." Hands find his pockets. "And me without my voice recorder."

Finally, they discover a proper table. Ed puts a bullet into the zombie's shoulder, dislocating it from the ball-and-cup joint. Carefully wedging it from beneath the car, pinning it's head beneath a trashcan, they cuff the zombie and load it onto the gurney. Finding the lab is rather easy; the medical lab is glorious, or so Ed claimes. "Now, I need you guys out of here. I have to do the tests by myself, or you might contaminate them or touch something or Garfield belch and it distracts the specimen. The straps will hold it for the time being, and I have this pistol. For the meantime, Garf, go find some food."

Drake arches a brow. "You sure you know what you're doing, Ed?"

Garfield says, "He's happy as a pig in shit. Let's just leave him be."

Edward glances at Drake. "I don't tell you how to pick locks and roll bums or whatever it is you do. Trust me, those straps are used to hold down victims of severe pain, durable to hold stress and tugging. I'm sure they can hold one wounded, cuffed, half blind corpse animated for god knows what." Cracking his knuckles, "Now, it's time to know what makes it tick."

Drake shrugs. "Whatever you say." he smiles. "Doc. You want I should cover your ass, or do you mind if I go find my stuff?"

"I'm gonna go hunt down the cafeteria," Garfield announces. He smirks. "Page me if you need anything."

Edward glances over. "Go look for your equipment."

Garfield asks Drake, "You hungry? Or are we secure enough to go wandering alone?"

Edward glancse at his watch. "We have a few hours before sun up. We meet here an hour before sunup, check?"

Drake shrugs at Garfield. "We've got guns. Get me something bad for me. I've got some errands to run."

Drake nods at Edward. "You're the man, doc." He laughs.

Garfield shrugs. "Watch your ass." He heads out, holding his purloined shotgun distastefully by barrel, like he's more ready to swing it than fire it. Following the signs, he heads to the cafeteria.

After several minutes of looking, Drake whoops as he finds his duffel. "When you don't have many posessions, all of them count." he comments to thin air. His Glock is gone, but his bowie, his spare clothes, his blackjack, and most importantly...his spare cigarettes. He immediately lights up and takes a couple long drags. He sighs as he finds his wallet with the false ID. "Probably usless now." But he pockets it all, slings the bag over his shoulder, and heads back towards the pharmacy: he's been there once, so it's not too hard to find. Curiously, he also tests his arm and leg, seeing how they feel as it gets closer to sunrise, shaking them a little.

To the roving thief and survivor, the shot arm and leg are curiously chilly but otherwise functional. No further aberrant motions, no other signs of outside influence have shown themselves. Neither has any pain set in, fortunately.

Meanwhile, in the Morgue, Garfield is looking at the clipboards and notes, comparing them to the bodies locked away in this cold place warily. His eye, accustomed to tracking schedules and inventories and noting discrepancies in any situation, finds everything quite as it should be.

Drake purses his lips thoughtfully. _They're not under my complete control. I have to watch out for that. Maybe I don't have much of a life...but I'm going to die, if I die, on my terms. Not on someone who can move my limbs like I'm a fucking marionette._ He continues to the pharmacy. Once there, he first tries looking for the stuff they gave him that first time. The one with 'side effects'.

Garfield munches on a ham sandwich as he stands back and eyes the rows of stainless steel coolers filled with exactly the number of corpses as there should be. "Well isn't that a kick in the ass." He finishes the sandwich and heads back to the cafeteria to fix another.

Drake eyes the vial, once he has it. He gets curious...although he's not sure if he can find an answer, or if he'll understand it. He goes over to the computer at the front, to see if it works, and if it does, if it can tell him what the stuff is supposed to do, and what side effects it's supposed to have.

Drake grimaces as the computer tells him...nothing useful. He raids the pharmacy for a few other known painkillers, figuring Ed can tell him what's best to use, and then heads back to the lab.

Edward comes to the door, but doesn't open it fully. He pokes his head off. There's a paticularly nasty scent in the air that sneaks out. "What?" He asks impatiently.

Drake holds up his hands. "Just curious if you made any progress, doc." He smiles.

Edward nods his head curtly. "Yes, some. Fascinating. But you have to understand I'm working against time, so I'm kind've in a mad dash."

Drake shrugs. "I can wait. Let me know if you need me to blast something." He chuckles and finds a seat.

Edward chuckles. "If you hear me scream 'It's Alive' and cackle, just ignore me." He shuts the door.

Garfield winces as he downs the last of his drink. _Really shouldn't have mixed that final bit of scotch with orange juice. Just doesn't work as well as vodka..._ Looking at the empty cup, he decides to head back to the lab. He exits the cafeteria.

Two hours before dawn, Drake's arm and leg rouse fully and painfully to live, a searing agony that wipes away every hint of strength or stamina. He can feel the blazing heat of his wounds running like liquid fire through every vein.

Drake makes a strangled noise, but does not cry out in pain. "Doc...Ed, I could use your help here!" he calls out.

The cry is answered by silence from the lab. The pain grows stronger, sharper, demanding relief or escape.

Drake grits his teeth, and then pops open the vial of the stuff he took that first night. He pops two in his mouth immediately. Putting it away. he grabs the shotgun and hobbles towards the lab. "Ed? You still alive in there?" he calls again.

Again, no answer comes from the lab. Drake's arm and leg feel cold again, but curiously, so does more and more of his body. He remembers falling...

The bus driver, in his endless, aimless errands around the hospital and the surrounding complex, discovers Drake laying on the ground, shotgun beside him, unconscious. The lab door is open.

"Not torn limb from limb is good, I guess..." Garfield mutters. He hefts his shotgun, holding it properly with both hands. He quickly pokes a head into the lab. "Kid?"

The lab is a mess. The gurney the trapped zombie had been bound into is empty. The straps don't look burst. Edward, and his pistol, are nowhere to be found. On the table where he was apparently working is a handheld tape recorder, sitting on top of a handwritten journal, a ledger of paper from the lab decorated in the student's terse handwriting. Across the floor is a large pool of blood, still fairly fresh, and three other things. The first is a lock of hair, with a bit of flesh attached. It's stained red by the puddle it rests in; its original color can't be discerned just yet. The second is a scrap of jeans, the same kind and color Edward was wearing. The third is related. It's a set of keys to a college dorm room. The keys and the denim are mashed together, both marred by a series of indents that look like... bite marks.

Garfield swears harshly. "And then there was one." Ears sharp as he can make them he approaches the notes and recorder, stuffing them inside his shirt. "Sorry, kid, I'll try to use 'em well." He glances at the keys but decides to actually check on Drake... Drake? He checks his watch. His eyes narrow but he dismisses the thought. He retireves the keys first after all.

The bus driver slides the journal into his shirt, noting the several pages of thickness, and noting especially one note, on the last page, half-obscured by a deep red stain:

"Dr. James Mannitiste. Reed College. Extra dimensions. 1-503-".

_I didn't have anything to drink. But I fell asleep on the floor. That's not a good sign._ Consciousness slowly returns to Drake. "What the fuck." he says aloud.

"Extra--? Christ. Leave it for later." Garfield exits the lab and bends over Drake. He supresses a smile at Drake's rhetorical question. "You fainted."

Drake pulls himself upright. "I don't faint. I was...in pain. Ed wasn't responding. I took a painkiller, took two steps and...then nothing." He shakes his head, trying to clear the cobwebs.

Garfield assists Drake in sitting up. "The kid's gone. So's specimin A. Any idea what happened?"

Drake blinks. "I...no. He was in there. I was waiting for him...for you."

Surrepticiously, Garfield eyes Drakes hands, and watches his teeth. "There's a pool of blood in a corner. But no body."

Drake removes himself from Garfield grip and then moves into the lab. "Holy fuck." he says intelligently.

"The kid left some notes, and a name," Garfield tells him. "I've got them."

Garfield's shirt bulges more than it usually does.

Drake looks at Garfield. "This makes no sense. If there was a fight, why didn't I hear anything? If it happened after I passed out, why wasn't I hamburger au jus? And if Ed or someone escaped, why is there no blood trail?" He registers what Gar says finally. "Let me see."

Garfield says, "Somehow I doubt a bus driver or a... a... whatever you are will make much sense out of them, especially an hour before dawn. I think you need to be elsewhere real soon. How are you feeling?"

Drake sighs. "I'm fine...I wasn't before I passed out, but I am now." He shakes his head. "But I can't leave. I have to know what happened to Ed. Come on. Let's canvas the building."

"Been there, done that," Garfield tells him. "Nada."

Drake growls. "Fuck." he grits his teeth. "Is there anything of use in that fucking notebook?" he snarls. Strangely enough, he doesn't seem to be mad at Gar.

Garfield shrugs. "I saw a name, some prof at a college. I'm gonna call him in the morning. God knows what I'll say, though."

"Like maybe, 'help me, I'm being dragged to the cemetary?'."

"Look," Garfield states. "If he's dead, there's nothing to be done. If he's alive, he'll be around in the daytime and we can look for him then."

Drake sighs and looks at his watch. "Okay...go back to whereever you were. I'm going to find a place to hole up. If a guy called...ah...Porter comes calling for you, it's me." He tilts his head. "What the hell is your name, anyway?"

Garfield gives him a strange look. "Garfield. And no, I hate lasagna."

Drake smirks. "Last name? I think they're going to ask if I call the hospital."

Garfield shakes his head. "Garfield, like I said. You ain't my mother--you're not gonna need my given name."

Drake sighs. "Okay. Don't blame me if I can't find you though. Try not to have a heart attack on me." He grabs the shotgun, and hurries off towards the hospital entrance.

Garfield eyes the empty doorway for a moment. "Least it ain't one anymore." Then he remembers his shotgun and quickly heads outside to toss it in a dumpster after wiping his prints off it. _Can't be too careful._ He heads back to the room he and Ed were in at the start of the night, hoping to get through at least some of the notes before daybreak.

With a little effort, Drake manages to get back to his hotel room and locks the door. Laying on the bed he fills some glasses with water, and puts the vials he got on the table beside him. Then the sun hit his window and he nearly passes out from the sudden shock of pain. "fuck me...." he gasps. He grabs a vial of Demorol, shakes out one pill, and downs it with water. _Careful with that shit. Supposed to be addictive. I can handle the pain. I can. And then I'm going to find the fucker that's behind this and pay him back in spades._

A trooper reports to the room Garfield and friends were staying in, with an ashen look on his face. "Stuart Garfield?" he says. "Come with me." The man leads the way toward the front of the hospital, pointing out the tremendous damage of the car wreck, which is cordoned off by police tape. "The report... well, we got Rod to wake up and talk a bit. You guys mentioned a kidnapper? Well, we're pretty it was him that drove this car in here last night.. we need you to identify the body." He points toward the front desk, smashed beyond repair by the car. "The receptionist on duty was also killed."

Garfield isn't surprised by the car wreck, but most certainly is by the death of the receptionist. "What...? When... when did this happen?"

"Sometime last night," is the answer. "I wasn't around for it.." The trooper leads the way to the morgue, signalling to the attendant to prepare the body. What Garfield finds within the container is...

Nobody he has ever seen. The stranger is dressed like a street person, and extremely ragged, with numerous injuries from the wreck marring an otherwise-unpleasant face.

Garfield rapidly debates. _No, the trooper saw Drake..._ He shakes his head. "Looks like some homeless guy -- the kidnapper wasn't like that. He looked like a thug, sure, but decently dressed." Garfield gives a quick verbal sketch of Drake.

The trooper pauses, looking confused by this decidedly odd turn of events, but nods, escorting Garfield back out and to his room again. "Guess you're free to go for now," he says finally. "Just don't leave town, okay?" And with that, he walks out the door..

Back at the hotel, Drake quickly determines that he's not going to get anything done today. So he drifts in and out of sleep, keeping the pills on hand in case the first one wears off. The pain is dulled enough, fortunately, that he **is** allowed to sleep, on and off.

Garfield's eyes are itching from lack of sleep. "Don't leave town," he murmurs. "Woudln't dream of it." He retrieves his items from his hospital room. He heads out, stopping at the reception desk -- the makeshift one rather -- to get the name of a hotel and to leave word that a friend of his, a Mr. Porter, might call and to direct him to that hotel. Catching a bus he takes it to the hotel, resiting the urge to talk shop like he normally with the driver. After a few hours of sleep, he starts going through the notes the kid left.

Head swimming from too many technical references and too much jargon, Garfield finally gives up and flips to the page with the doctor's name. James Mannitiste. Of Reed College. Teling himself that a stiff drink right now would be counter-productive, he lifts the telephone and dials the operator. He asks for the number of Reed College in area code 503.

Finally, after secretary after secretary gets through playing with him, the phone to (hopefull) Dr. Mannitiste's office rings. "Um. Hello? Dr. James Mannitiste?"

James picks up the phone, he sounds somewhat impatient. Or perhaps eager. Either one. "Hello? This is James." The sound of a computer or something running in the background can be heard. "I thought you were going to email me?"

Garfield blinks in confusion. "Uh, sorry, Doctor. I don't actually have a computer. We haven't spoken before." Through the butterflies in his stomach, he wonders if the call is traceable if the doc decides he's nuts and tries having him committed.

_Pain is an illusion. An illusion that really really hurts._ Drake thinks. He's not sure how much time has passed. He coughs, and then winces at the pain that brings. He lights up a cigarette, and breathes deep. _Polluted air. Nothing like it. I don't trust air I can't see._ He wondering if thinking in movie quotes is keeping him sane. _Pain is your friend, your ally, it will tell you when you are seriously injured, it will keep you awake and angry, and remind you to finish the job and get the hell home. But you know the best thing about pain? It lets you know you're not dead yet._ He thinks of Dierde. Or dreams of her. He thinks, if she were here, she might take the pain away. A bullet through the brain could do the same. But he's not going to.

James blinks a bit. "Oh I'm sorry. I was expect ing someone else to call, and not many people are transferred over to this number y'know. Hmmm. So what can I do for you, and uh, who are you? Do you have anything to do with the Dimensional Research I had been waiting to hear about?"

_'Extra-dimensions'. Bingo--perhaps._ Garfield thinks. "Uh, maybe. Sort of. Sorry, I didn't get much sleep last night. I'm kinda tired. Err... how'd you sleep? Okay?"

James ponders. "Er... I slept well enough, I suppose? Why are you asking? Who is this?" He sounds more curious than Paranoid. But then, he has no cause to be paranoid. Not yet anyway.

Garfield clears his throat. _Damn! Guess it was too much to hope._ He imagines God chuckling softly somewhere and a bit of anger sparks. He shakes it off. "The name's Garfield. Stuart Garfield. You wouldn't know me, I'm out of, uh, Oregon Health and Science University. A friend of mine is interested in, uh, 'dimensional research', but is busy so asked me to look you up."

James nods, but then how does one send that across the phone. A video phone might be helpful here... but then, perhaps not. One never knows, really. _And to think, I could be doing... well actually this is better than what I could be doing._ "Ah, out of OHSU then? I lectured there once. A friend of yours is? Oh! Good. Which one? I'd been waiting to hear abotu this all morning."

Garfield rolls his eyes. _Good Lor-- Indifferent Lord. Whatever._ "No, this is more along the lines of... a bet. I don't do theory -- more practical, uh, engineering stuff -- but I got into an argument with this friend." He quickly racks his brains for every bad science fiction show he's seen on late night TV. "I said, purely, uh, in jest, that it was entirely possible to remove someone from, uh, this dimension and have them reappear in some other dimension. He scoffed and asked what universe I was living in." _Good question..._ "I said it was, er, unlikely, but entirely possible with our, um, current understanding of the universe."

James ponders this over the phone. "Mmmhmmm. The lines of a bet? You don't do theory? A shame. That's where most of the action is. In Theory. And all the other places. Come to think of it the actions everywhere. Nevertheless, you wished to ask me about dimensional removal?" _Poor sod, having a hard time keeping his thoughts straight. He must've been watching the Island of DOOOM last night on TV as well_ "What do you wish to know from me?"

_Well, he didn't hang up. That's something._ Garfield thinks for a moment. _Screw it, it's all hypothetical now so why not just tell him?_ "Okay, this is what I proposed: imagine you're sitting at home, watching some flick on TV. You look outside and realize that the sun's gone down and you hadn't realized it. You're hungry, so you pick up a phone to order Chinese. The phone just rings. You try another restaurant. Same thing. You call a friend. Ditto. Curious, you walk outside and realize the world is dead quiet. Nothing's about." _Not even zombies, flesh-eating or otherwise._ "You wander the streets. Buildings are lit, cars are parked on the sides of the street, but not a soul is wandering around. You're the only one left. Confused now, you go home and go to bed, to just sleep it off. You wake up and the sun's shining and the world has returned. Basically you, uh, well, you left this dimension for a night and the next day popped back into the 'real' one." He grins mirthlessly. "Well, Doctor? At all possible?"

James speaks into the phone. "Ah. Hmmmm." Well it's more like he articulates thinking sort of noises into the phone. "Sitting down and watching stuff on TV, lookoutside, realize that the world is dead quiet. Nothing at all? How unusual. You know, this sounds like an episode of the Twilight Zone." _There's... something... on... the WING_ "The one where the guy loses his glasses and wants to read. But...hmmm. It could be possible. Many things are, it's simply that no one bothers to presume they could be. Why do you ask?"

Garfield smirks. _Add the zombies and you've pretty much nailed Twilight Zone, yeah._ "Well... I had this dream, a really bad one, and it got me thinking."

James nods. "Dreams are like that. The unconsciousnesses way of dealing with the conciousness's worries. Now let me think. You want dimensional theory? I can spout some of that off for you if you'd like." He demonstrates, by spouting off a stream of technobabble. "So... it could be possible."

_Shit. Guess this proves that I'm not necessarily insane. Just very, very unlucky._ "I knew it. But what sort of gear would be required? And what, err... experiments could be performed to prove that the person either is in another dimension at night or, in the morning, that he had been in another dimension?"

James ponders. "Well... you know, I don't believe I know of any. I mean, maybe if you could wait around for a few hundred years we could get this problem solved. But... I don't have the money or the patience to get myself Cryogenically frozen."

Garfield can't resist a dig. "But what good's theory without a dose of practicality? Even Einstein had his..." _Um, um, um, damn, damn..._ "...thought experiments."

The tone of the phone on the other end changes; Garfield is left, after a second or two, with a rapid series of clicks, then a dial tone...
