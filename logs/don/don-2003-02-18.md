The phone clicks in James' ear, twice. As usual, shoddy service from the telco. Perhaps the caller will try again?

James hangs up the phone. Pondering. He stares at the phone, willing it to ring again. Ring. Ring. Ring. He stares wide-eyed for a moment, before he realizes that that was simply the alarm clock going off. "I've got to get a better alarm clock than this one... feh."

Volumous curses start to push their way up Garfield's throat as the line goes dead, but they die before being uttered. Why should he bother after all? It's not like he hadn't mostly expected to be hung up on. But... but that was strange place to do it. Perhaps it hadn't been the professor. But that would mean either Bell got its damed wires crossed yet again, or... He swallows, hard. How hard would it be for something to screw with a telephone conversation which could play with dimensions or whatever the hell was going on? Garfield's heart beats a little faster as he stares at the telephone receiver. _Time to go, I think. Ain't riskin' my neck to find out it wasn't a phone company glitch..._

James waits and waits and waits. He ponders. He ponders some more, and looks at the phone. He picks up the phone, and presses three buttons. _Bloody telco._ He dials \*69

Garfield gathers the kid's papers together. It's not like he really had anything else except his clothes. Hand on the doorknob, he starts to open it when the phone begins ringing again. He halts, peers over his shoulder at the noisy thing. _And who the hell's on the other end, I wonder?_ He hesitates, uncertain, before cautiously heading back to he phone and picking it up. "Hello?" he asks.

James speaks into the phone, after having it ring so many times. He sounds a little frustrated, but it's more with the telco than anything else. He can be heard muttering, "...oody Telco." Before he brightens up a bit, "Hello! This is Dr. Mannitiste again. The phone seems to have given out. Blasted company, I'd switch if the University weren't paying my phone bill. Now... what was it you were saying again?"

_The prof. Good. I think._ Garfield thinks. _What the hell was I rambling like an idiot about? Uh... Einstein... Oh, right._ "Practicality, professor. What good is theory without practicality? As I was saying, even Einstein has his thought experiments to keep him... ah, grounded."

James nods, "Right then. So... what about practicality? I mean, so far as I know, there's no practicality to finding out what else there would be in... other dimensions. But then that doesn't mean there aren't. I'm still not sure I'm following you though."

Garfield shakes his head impatiently, but tries to keep the emotion from his voice. _Damn eggheads... Can never see the forest for the trees._ "No, no. I mean, when I land in the empty world--err... for example, of course--what could I do to prove that I was actually in another... uh, dimension? And how could I prove that I had been in another dimension when morning rolls around?"

James listens, "Ohhhhh I get what you mean now. Hmmm. I don't know, honestly what you might do. The obvious thing would be to see what, if anything, carried over from one world to the next and examine it from there. Or you could conduct CAt scans or some other kind of Brain analysis. Hmmm. And as far as determining what, if anything, you'd been doing, you could always check yourself for dirt, injuries, strains. Get a thorough medical checkup to see if everything was the way it should be, or if it falls in line with the different worlds. And perhaps, hmmm. You could analyze all manner of things, really."

_Great. Everything and nothing. Buncha words. Where the hell are you, kid?_ Garfield supresses a sigh. "Med scans would require a doctor and I'm just a bu--" He coughs, suddenly. "Engineer! Sorry." His voice becomes, softer, more thoughtful. "But injuries don't carry over. Hmm... And the world mostly stays the same... But in the 'real' world, the kid didn't crash the cruiser, some homeless guy did. Damn strange. Ed wasn't driving... but then would any of us being doin' the stuff in the real world that we did at night?" His voice sharpens as he realizes he's actually speaking aloud. "Err... nevermind. Just thinkin' aloud."

James blinks at this. "Hmm. You say injuries don't carry over. Well let me think for a moment. You could try some rudimentary analysis of the, then, in each world to see what it was like. So what you are saying is that actions in one world affect the other?"

James says, "Is it vice versa, do you speculate?"

An ironic smile stretches Garfield's lips. _He didn't just hang up. So, which of us belongs in the looney bin more?_ His eyes narrow, invisible to the speaker on the other end. _Fine. Let's feed him a bit more, then..._ "A smashed arm was whole upon going into the night world. It's possible injuries from the night are gone in the day." _The kid'd know for sure..._ It's not a hopeful thought. "I don't think actions affect the other world." His mouth tightens as he tries to think things through. "I think they might be **copied**. A car is smashed in both worlds, but by one person in the night world and by another in the real world. But I don't know for certain." _Guess I should figure out how to check..._

James belongs in a looney bin. Probably. But not just ANY looney bin, he belongs in the discount looney bin where you can get twenty loonies for five bucks. "Hmmm. A smashed arm became whole? What about the muscular trauma?" He ponders again. "Well you know, you ought to figure out how to check to know for sure."

Garfield is getting tired of suppressing reactions. _What'd the kid see in this guy? I'm thinkin' he's too easy to impress._ "Uh, yeah. You're right. I **should** figure out how. Don't suppose you got any ideas?"

James ponders, "I'd need to see the evidence myself before I could make any kind of guess. I mean from what you're saying, there's a number of results that could work. As I've said, but..."

James says, "I'd need to know more before I could guarantee you results."

Garfield can't hold back a choking sound, but he does try to turn it into another cough. _Yeah, right..._ "Well, I'm currently... doing a little field research in the spiffy town of Gresham. If you'd care to visit, I'm sure we could go over my notes in great detail." Sarcasm doesn't quite drip from his voice, but it's damn close.

James nods, "Sure. I'm in. In Gresham you say? Well... let me know where to go, what to bring, and that sort of stuff. What kind of facility are you conducting your research in?"

Garfield takes the phone from his ear and stares at it, openmouthed. It's a full three seconds before he can return it to his ear. "Facility? Uh, Legacy Mount Hood Hospital. What to bring. Uh... clothes, flashlight, sh--" _Shotgun, **don't** say shotgun..._ "Uh, camera. And a camcorder, if you've got one. Mine, uh, died."

James nods, "Certainly. I've got one. What sorta labs have they got in Legacy Mount Hood Hospital? I'm curious. Well I suppose I'll see what I can find when I get there. How will I know you?"

James says, "I'll be the git in the labcoat, you know."

Garfield's lips quirk into a smile. _He's a nuts as we are. He'll fit right in._ He suddenly frowns. _Assuming he crosses over with us. Shit. How do I get him to cross over with us? Cuff him to a chair and stare him in the eye at sundown?_ "I'll be in the front lobby, wearing..." He looks down, decides that a bus driver's uniform isn't the most appropriate. _What the hell do professors wear?_ "Uh, jeans. Err...black ones. And a blue shirt." _Labcoat? Wonder if I can steal...? Uh, better not._ "Black hair, going grey. And I'm a bit, uh, chubby. What time can you get here?"

James says, "Uhm. I will arrive at in about an hour."

Garfield says, "An hour, eh? That's fine. Gives me time to get a couple of things done."

James then heads off to go find a way to get to... Gresham.

Tugging fitfully at the collar of his new shirt, Garfield relects that the front lobby may not have been the best place to choose to meet, what with the large gaping hole where a certain police cruiser plowed through the entrance, driven by God only knows who exactly. Or, rather, it seems it depends on which dimension you're talking about. He scowls at the confusing thought, and idly checks for the third time that he cut the price tags off the jeans and shirt. And the coat lying on the chair beside him.

Garfield glances at the makeshift reception area. _Drake hasn't called. I suppose I should hope he's feeling better, but somehow I don't._ Sighing, he settles back and waits.

An hour later, James makes his way down the sidewalk of the Legacy hospital. He glances about, looking rather confused by the police cruiser. Something dawns on him, "Hey... didn't that guy say..." He falls silent though, and begins looking around for Garfield. "Excuse me... did we speak over the phone? I'm Dr. Mannitiste..."

Garfield stands, remembering a second late that he should offer a hand. "Stuart Garfield. Uh, they had a bit of an accident here earlier. I was thinking that if you're okay with an early dinner, we could head to my motel room with a load of Chinese takeout and discuss stuff there."

James nods and shakes the offered hand. "Oh indeed. Are your files and such in your, motel room? You don't live around here then. Well it's only a ten minute drive back for me." He ponders, "Sure sounds good, heading back there. So what other work have you done? I'm curious about the others I'll be working with."

_Working--? Wonder what he'll think of Drake? And the kid--_ Garfield's eyes widen. _Crap, I forgot to ask reception about him._ "Uh, good. Could you wait here a second? Now that you mention it, one of the others... wandered off. I want to check with the staff here if they've seen him today."

James nods, "Sure. I'll wait here. You go and check on the others." He sounds slightly suspicious, but, it's probably nothing. _Engineers. Yeesh. Well... here I am about to go find new dimensions. Or to be labeled a total quack by people I don't even know. What a way to spend a day. Garfield nods briskly. "Thanks." He scoops his coat off the chair beside him, surrepticiously pressing through the material for the form of the kid's notebook zipped into an interior pocket. Reassured at its presence, he heads back to reception. "Hello, again," he says, almost politely, to the attendant who'd told him that no one had left him a message. "I was brought in yesterday with a... friend of mine. We seem to have been separated, however. I was wondering who I'd talk to about locating him...?"_

_"Who would that be, sir?" the receptionist inquires quietly._

_Garfield says, "A younger guy, name of Edward. Uh... Banders." That was what the kid had told the cops, anyway._

_"I have him recorded as checked out, sir," comes the answer after a moment of consultation._

_"Oh," Garfield says, blinking in surprise. "Really?" he finishes lamely. "Uh, did he check himself out? And do you have the check out time?"_

_"Yes, sir, and I believe he checked out sometime before dawn.." The receptionist isn't bored, or sleepy, but... definitely not in a good mood._

_Garfield's voice is tired. "Before dawn. Of course. That's why I coudln't find him in the hospital." _Before dawn...? Great. Just great. How the hell did that happen?_ "Listen, I called his house as well and he's not there -- did he leave any sort of contact info? I really need to get in touch with him."_

_Sighing, the receptionist shrugs. "No, that information is not available. I'm sorry, sir."_

__Didn't think so._ Garfield nods. "I'm sure he'll turn up." He gestures at the wreckage behind him. "Been a hell of a day, hey? Hope it gets better for ya. Or at least ends soon. Thanks for the help."_

_James watches Garfield and the Receptionist exchange banter between one another. He cocks his head a little, and moves a bit closer, so as to overhear what's going on. He looks back to Garfield, waiting for the fellow to finish up. _I hope the Chinese Takeout's good. Nothing like some Fried Rice to stimulate the brain for research.__

_Turning away from the receptionist, Garfield sees that the professor is watching him. He shrugs for his benefit. "Damn kids," he says as he approaches. "Take off at the damnedest times. I'm afraid it'll be take out from the yellow pages. I don't know what's good 'round here._

_James nods, "Ah. Your first day in town too then eh?" He walks towards Garfield, and when appropriate towards the exit. "Well let's go see what notes you've got. Perhaps you can even show me an example of this supposed dimensional travelling."_

_Garfield looks at him wryly. _So much for it being merely a 'dream'._ "Been here a day or two. Been living off hospital food. Decent ham sandwiches. Well, when you make them yourself, anyway. Let's get out of here."_

_James follows Garfield off to his motel room. He takes note of the route taken to get there, and of any unusual things along the way. After all... this is pretty cool. He talks on and off about certain technobabblish sounding things to Garfield, though he's mostly speculating to himself about things. He does seem eager to get there, but, he motions for them to pull over upon spotting a Chinese Takeout place. He hops out of the car and places an order, maybe ten, maybe fifteen minutes later, it's done. He returns with enough food to last the night. And fortune cookies. He ponders one of them and breaks it open, wondering what Fortune holds in store for him tonight._

_"You will find true love soon."_

_Garfield snubs the chopsticks in favour of a plastic fork, and helps himself to a plate. Both chairs are pulled arond the table the room boasts, not that there's much to boast about considering the table is rather pitiful. Besides their plates, there's only really room for the photocopied pages Garfield made from Ed's notebook. The pages produced were carefully selected to avoid any mention of the monstrosities infesting the night, dealing strictly with dimensional stuff. Garfield hopes the professor understands it better than he did._

_James goes over the research, looking over the pages left before him. He's more interested in the writing than anything else. Let alone the greasy noodles._

_James goes over the research, looking over the pages left before him. He's more interested in the writing than anything else. Let alone the greasy noodles. "Interesting. So...this is all you have on dimensional travel here and here? Hmmm. I wonder though..." He peers, and slurps up some noodles. "Was this your work? Or whose?"_

_Garfield glances at his watch. An hour 'til sunset. "A student named Ed Banders actually wrote it. There's probably more, it's just that's all Ed left me. As said, I'm not strong on theory. Anyway, we're all supposed to meet at the hospital just after dark so I'm sure your questions will be answered then. In the meantime, let's finish up dinner and look at the camcorder."_

_James nods, and goes over this. "These notes aten't very conclusive. Are you sure there wasn't more to it than this?" He ponders, "Indeed. Alright. Well let's go get the stuff set up, I suppose? I've got the camcorder here..."_

_Garfield suggests, "Let's record a quick segment to verify it works."_

_James nods, "Sure."_

_A few minutes later, footage is recorded of both Garfield and the professor grinning uncomfortably at the camcorder. Squinting at the puny LCD viewscreen, Garfield comments, "I think I'm looking thinner. Or maybe it's just the picture. Ah, well."_

_More time passes as Garfield has James familiarize him with the basics of operating the camcorder. The still camera gets a look over as well. "This isn't one of those new-fan-- err.. digital, I mean digital, cameras is it? Just uses ordinary film?" _Not that it's likely to matter...__

_James nods, "It's a digital camera. Easier to transfer the material to computers for analyzing you know. I'd have brought a computer along, but I only have my desktop. So we can review the photos instantly anyway, from the camera, rather than needing them to be developed."_

_Garfield nods uncertainly. "Sure. Right." His watch tells him he should start cowering under the motel's bed in a scant few minutes, not that he's likely to take such wise advice. He produces the remnants of the 40 ouncer he bought to refill his hip flasks and tips a measure in the empty Coke cans that came with their meal. He ignores the curious look the professor give him as he sets the camcorder on the nighttable, points it at the main table, and sets it recording. _This ain't gonna work. I know it._ He supresses a sigh. Pushing one of the partially refilled cans toward the professor, he raises his can and offers a toast with a sardonic smile. "To whatever comes. To destiny."_

_James nods a little. He ponders the time, and looks curiously at Garfield. Again. He finishes off some of the noodles, before pressing a finger against the research. He taps it up and down. "There's something to be found here, I'm sure. I just don't know what it is. Well... to Destiny."_
