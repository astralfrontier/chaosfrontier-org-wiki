# Dead of Night 2003-04-02

The pain and dreams run off Drake's consciousness like dirty water receding down a drain, leaving a sterile emptiness and the cold feel of an a hotel room at dusk. The ominous silences are becoming uncomfortably familiar, and the world begins and end with the sounds of his own breathing.

Drake blinks groggily, trying to look to the window. "Sun's gone down." he mutters. It seems like it's been milennia since he's heard a voice, much less his own. He tries to sldie into a sitting position, gingerly testing his feet againt the ground.

The room is as he found it - dimly lit, undisturbed since his passage into the hellish torture of half-conscious agony, dulled only by the drugs and ocacsional bouts of oblivion. The pain is gone, leaving only a dull ache behind, throbbing through the man's nerves with each heartbeat. Each joint feels stiff, unused, as though he'd been sleeping for days.

Drake slowly tries to refocus, trying to remember what was going on before the sun came up, and he was given over to the nightmare existance of daytime. "Gun." he says over a thick tongue. He finds the new gun he'd aquired last night, and his things, and the medications he stole. "Time to go to work." he says to the empty room. He gets a cigarette, lights it, and takes a deep breath, the mentholated tobacco soothing him.

When he leaves, he leaves the bag, and most of his things. The important stuff - the picks, the tools, his knife - he takes with him. He walks the dead streets...feeling strangely at home himself. He doesn't feel so alive himself, anymore. The pain proved he was alive. That's what he told himself. Now that the pain is gone...does that mean his life is gone with it? "I need wheels." he says aloud. He's not so much scared of what he thinks about, but practical needs supplant these unfamiliar thoughts that rack his brain. He starts looking for a taxi depot. He should eb able to find keys he can steal. Plus, taxis are pretty durable...and have those nifty bulletproof dividers. "Sounds like a plan." he mutters.

Walking and walking, Drake's eyes keep up a steady survey of the area. After twenty minutes in what should be the right direction, the depot hasn't shown up yet. There is, however, something he doesn't remember from last night - what looks like a crater, set into one of the two-story condos on one side of the street, as though some explosion in the basement had been set off.

"Good god." Drake breathes. Just to say something. A sight like that should not go unremarks. And then his lips curl up. "Well...on any other day, that might seems strange." he quotes. And he starts walking towards the crater, distracted from his quest for a taxi.

The opening, on closer inspection, looks less like an explosion.. more like something.. burrowed out, through concrete and metal and wood. Burrowed out of the ground, possibly, and through the condo's basement, which is somewhat exposed and can be glimpsed through the jagged pieces of concrete jutting out from the ground.

"Attack of the Giant Mole People?" Drake mutters to himself. He pulls back the action on his Beretta, putting a round into the chamber. Checking out what's going on might not be the smartest move, but it's only through daring that he's ever going to find out anything. "So far, life is a 100% fatal. The rest is just details." he mutters, making his way towards the basement, looking around cautiously.

The basement of the condo is in shambles. What looks like it was once a den and game-room of masculine influence has been reduced to rubble - the pool-table broken through, the television smashed, and one couch in the corner scratched up and torn unaccountably. The bored-out hole continues down into the depths of the Earth itself, and is easily six feet wide at its widest point.

Drake ignores the hole for a moment...no easy feat. He sifts through the rubble first, to see if he can find any purloined letters, or telltale hearts. SOmething to clue him in on what happened here.

The condo's contents describe a typical male's den - magazines, guns and other accessories for shooting in good repair, assorted action (and "action") videotapes... nothing that suggests this room, or any of the ones above, are in any way extraordinary. Aside from the gaping hole, that is.

Drake grabs a shotgun and a box of shells. "You can never have too many guns. But it looks like guns didn't help whoever was here." he comments to the pool table. The pool table just looks wise. "HMmph. Once more, into the breach?" he asks himself, looking into the hole. Leaning the shotgun on his shoulder, he gets out his flashlight, turns it on, and marches into the unknown.

The tunnel slips downward into the earth, packed tightly enough to remain stable, it seems. Layers of dirt and stone pass by as Drake descends, somewhat cramped in the close quarters. After several minutes of continuous movement, the tunnel begins to diverge, emptying itself out at last into a largish cavern beneath the city. Here and there, other tubes or tunnels can be seen leading up to darkness at every imaginable angle. There's also a large tube at the center of the cavern, at least twenty feet in diameter and belching out a steady stream of smoke, leading more or less downwards.

"Jumping into tubes of smoke is a no-no, in my book. I saw Volcano." he informs the smoke. He chews his lip, shining the flashlight around, to see if he can find any signs of life. Or unlife. Or anything out of place at all.

Out of the corner of his eye, the curious thief notes a flicker of motion, dodging back into one of the other tunnels.

Drake points the light. "Come out where I can see you." he orders the flicker of motion, pointing his shotgun. And wishing he had a roll of duct tape, so he could fasten the flashlight to the gun. He starts walking towards the tunnel.

Unfortunately, Drake's eye didn't catch one other figment of motion, this one infinitely more troublesome...

Drake comes to, as he's laying on the street. Green ichor stains the pavement near the rent flesh that was once his shoulder, and the once-attached arm is nowhere to be seen. The other, the \`warm' arm, is intact, to the extent that any part of his body is still undamaged.. soreness pervades him. Curiously, though, the severed stump of his arm hurts not a bit. In fact, it actually feels a little better, now. The street is covered with a black bile, and a half-dissolved shotgun bubbles quietly in the middle of it.

Drake stares at the spot where is arm used to be. "Great. Now I'm the guy that killed Richard Kimble's wife." he says dully. He can't quite believe the limb is missing...it's like...if he could only reach out with it and grasp something, he'd know it was still there. But it persists in being absent. "I don't know how the fuck I'm supposed to survive this in the morning." he mumbles. And then he notices the dissolving shotgun. "Fuck me." he mumbles. "What the hell is that stuff?" He stares for a while at the ichor. "Or maybe that thing was something out a Sigorney Weaver movie..." He tries reaching in his left pocket for a cigarette, and then remembers he no longer has a left arm. With a little effort, he finally manages it, and lights it, taking a drag. And then, out of curiosity, he tosses the cig into the ichor.

The cigarette disappears slowly into the viscous material, and as the lit butt touches down, the entire mass bursts into ready flame...

Drake stares. "Holy fuck. Okay, exit, stage left..." He turns and runs from the conflagration, trying to put a barrier between him and the burning blood...

The thief fortunately has enough guts left to hoof it away before the black mass disappears in a brief, but noisy, conflagration. The sound reverberates off the nearby houses, sounding unusually loud on the empty street, in an empty city. That was most certainly that...

Drake stumbles aimlessly, still in shock from the previous few moment's events. He doesn't both going back for another rifle...without two arms, it's harder to weild. Only having one arm makes certain other functions harder too. Maybe, with lots of practice, he could manage to drive a car one handed. But that's not happening right away. Then again, if he can find an automatic shift, and he drives slowly, it's still possible. So he seeks out the depot, manages to find keys, and slowly tries to make his way in his newly aquired vehicle to the hospital.
