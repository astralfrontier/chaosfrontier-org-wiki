# Dead of Night 2003-04-18

Sunset. Garfield and James sit quietly in the room, the camcorder's all-seeing eye surveying them. Time passes.

Garfield glances at the darkening window and then pins the prof with a sardonic grin. "You prol'ly thought I was nuts, eh? Bit wacked? Off my meds? You were just humourin' me, right?" He chuckles nastily at the other's expression, but only for a moment. As he jerks a thumb towards the door, all expression vanishes from his face. "Yeah, thought so. Well, listen up, bud, and keep the straigtjacket hidden a bit longer. Yer in in what I laughingly call 'my world' now. Zombies wanna crack yer bones and suck out the marrow. Your job is to stick by me, stay alive and figure out what the hell's going on. Get me?"

James blinks at Garfield. "Wacked? Off your meds... riiiight. I'll tell you what..." He smiles a bit nervously. "I'm not hiding any straightjacket, but uh... if there're zombies, then I should uh... get my shotgun. It's outside. I'll be right back." He then heads for the door, turning the knob so hee can get the heck away from this crackpot.

The door to the motel room opens at the doctor's touch. Outside stands a man, panting, his hair dishevelled, his face grimy. His eyes are agleam with feral menace. In one hand he's got a shotgun; his other arm is tightly wrapped in bandages, and hidden underneath the long sleeves of a coat which was not his own, as Garfield remembers it.

Garfield's eyes widen. "Drake? Geez, can't you go one day without takin' a beatin'?"

Garfield steps rapidly over to the professor and grabs hold of his arm. "Professor, meet Drake. Drake, this is the kid's idea of a genius."

Drake sighs. "Sorry. I've been having a very bad day, Garfield." He blinks at the introduction. "So...you got someone to cross over?"

Garfield shrugs at the prof's blank gaze. "Seems so. He's not tryin' to kill like a zombie, anyway. Didn't need no magic words or nothin'."

James's eyes are similar to dinner plates about now. The resemblence is uncanny. He starts backign away slowly, so as not to make any sudden moves. _Some days... you really REALLY shouldn't get out of bed._ Upon reaching the window, his hands can be seen to tremble as he tries opening the window.

Garfield tighens his grip. "Stay awhile, professor. But not forever, I hope. Just 'til the sun comes up..."

James says, "Sure... just don't hurt me..."

Drake sighs. "Mind if I come in? I don't like being exposed like this. We've got new problems."

Garfield says, "Be my guest." He waves the other in, but retains his grip on the professor.

Drake closes the door behind him. "We've got something new out there. Something nastier than zombies. It almost had me for lunch. Or...midnight snack, anyway." He seems less tense now, tired, even confused.

James seems to have given up on trying to escape for the moment. _Maybe if they get distracted... I can make a break for it. I ought to be able to outrun the two of them. The one looks out of shape, the other... well I just hope he doesn't know how to aim that thing..._ "By all means. Tell me then, uh... Midnight Snack was it? What precisely hurt you...?"

Drake eyes James. "Nothing of this earth, doc. It was big...with...oversized arms and legs and a huge fanged mouth. It took my arm before I was able to down it."

Garfield glances at the prof, worried by the high pitch to his voice. _Hope he doesn't crack... For now, anyway._

James nods, "Riiiight. Okay. So where was it coming from?" _Okay. This guys is obviously a madman. Perhaps if I just keep him talking they'll forget about the 'killing me' part. That's always a good bet._ "Maybe you were uh... followed?"

Garfield says, "If both those and the zombies are wanderin' the streets, how the hell are we supposed to stay alive? I think this joke's going a bit too far..."

Drake shakes his head. "This one wasn't wandering the streets...it travelled through giant holes in the earth. I don't know if it made them, or what. There's one building that's in ruins where one of the holes comes out. I can show you if you want..."

James says, "Yes. It's obviously a joke of some kind. Hahaheheh... funny..." He shakes his head. "It seems to me that uh, we shouldn't go looking for more of these arm-taking things..."

Garfield says, "Pass." He looks longingly at the bottle still on the tiny table, but doubts he could manhandle the prof over there without a fight. _Crap..._

Drake gives James a dead eyed stare. "Maybe not, Doc. But there's no way to find out what's going on if we don't take risks. Now, maybe you don't care about what's going on...I don't know exactly what fat....what Garfield has told you. But I'm not going down without a fight...and if you're a smart guy, then maybe we need you to help us figure it out."

James looks between the two nervously. "Right. Uh risks. Yes they uh, I played that game once you know. Just don't shoot me."

Garfield sighs. "I doubt the prof needs to be a shrink to think we're nuts. How 'bout we poke our heads outside and show him around? We need to go to the hospital, anyway, to see if the kid's around."

Drake nods. "Seems like the quickest way to get him with the program." he agrees, ignoring the professor's comment.

Garfield says, "Got a car or anything?"

Drake jerks his chin. "Taxi I stole. It's still running so far."

Garfield says, "Right." He nods at the camera, still running on the bed. "I'm thinkin' of doing a documentary tonight. Sort of an indie, ghouls night out type thing."

James nods, "Oh okay. We can catch a ride then..." _Okay. Great. Psycopaths. I've got to get away. If I can manage to get the shot gun away from the insane one, I can probably outrun the fat one. Or just outrun the two of them. The first step is getting away._

Garfield stares hard at the prof, practically seeing the thoughts cycle through his head. "You're not getting away. You can't outrun a bullet. Please don't try."

Drake laughs without humor. "Why not. The Portland Witch Project." He looks at the professor. "Don't try anything stupid. I doubt Gar would want me to kill you, but it's really hard to unshoot someone if something happens in the fog of war."

Experimentally, Garfield releases the professor's arm.

James nods slowly, neglecting to mention that shotguns fire pellets, not bullets. A minor technicality, really. "No, I don't think I can outrun a bullet. Maybe those other things can? Are you sure bullets will work on those uh... things?"

Garfield shrugs. "Have so far."

Drake nods. "Else I wouldn't be here."

James nods, "So how many bullets does it take to kill one of them? Or at least to get it to let go of your arm...?"

Drake says, "The zombies usually go down pretty easy...the monstrosity I ran into is a little more bullet proof. And it's faster than a normal person."

Drake absently wipes the sweat from his brow. "I was luckier than I had any right to be."

James nods, "Oh okay... so you had to use a few more rounds? Did you kill the thing? How many bullets do you think we have left to take care of them with?"

Garfield steps over to the bed, but detours first to the table and takes a brief swig, before picking up the running camcorder. He waves its lens at the other two, then powers it down. He doesn't have any spare batteries, and probably only a couple of hours of tape.

Drake says, "The one I came across is dead....when I woke up, my arm was gone, and its blood was everywhere...nasty stuff. Burns like gas and melts like acid. I shot him about...four or five times with the shotgun I had."

Garfield looks at Drake's banadged arm. "Er... gone?"

Drake turns that dead gaze towards Garfield. "It came back...sort of. I don't know how. And I don't trust it. That's the same arm that was controlled, if you recall."

Garfield scowls. "Bet yer ass I recall..."

Garfield says, "Waitaminute. It was lost during the night, and came back during the night?"

James hmmms. "Arm that was controlled?" _Geez, those movie store guys'll let ANYONE rent Evil Dead these days._

Drake nudges the Professor. "lets move along. It's not a good idea to stay in one place too long." He stops, at Gar's comment, and looks at him strangely. "Yeah....yeah, it did."

Drake says, "That's interesting. Maybe certain permanent changes can't happen at night...besides death, maybe."

Garfield shakes his head. "I remember some quote about 'beautiful theories' and 'ugly facts'. Prof probably knows it."

Drake sighs at James. "It's a long story, doc. Let's just press on. It'll get easier once you see the facts for themselves."

Garfield abandons the bottle, but reassuringly pats his flasks as he heads to the door with the others.

James nods slowly, "Riiight. The facts for themselves. Okay. So uh lets get out of here then." _I can get away outside. I have to. Or I'm dead._ "What facts will I see, exactly?"

Garfield says, "Well, watch the scenery, scope out the sights or whatever. There won't be any bikini babes to oogle, though. In fact, there won't be anyone." _I hope, else I've **really** gone over the bend..._ "Make a note of that in your notebook, professor."

James nods, "Right. I can't quite get"

Drake says, "Oh, the fact that there's no people. Maybe a score or so of zombies. If we're really unlucky, we'll see the brother of the nasty thing."

James nods, "Right. I can't quite get my notebook right now. I need one hand to open it, the other to right in. I won't run..."

James thinks. _And the Pope is Protestant too._

Garfield says, "An' one eye to see what yer writin' and one to watch for zombies. Yeah, yeah. Let's go."

James pats his pockets then, as though he were look for his notebook. "Uh... I don't have mine with me." _Notebook? Who needs a notebook? My own head's easy enough. And I don't lose that... hopefully._ "Maybe we can find one on our way? Let's go...?"

Drake nudges James towards the door then. With the barrel of his shotgun. "Move along then, Doc."

James walks along quite willingly. He glances all about, taking noye of possible escape routes and distractions. He steps outside the door, only to slam it shut immediately behind him and take off running. _That cab... if I can get to it before they do..._

Drake sighs, "I'm in no mood for this..." He opens the door and gives chase, trying to grab for the professor...

Garfield growls in exasperation, steps through the doorway and, crossing his fingers, shouts, "Stop or I'll shoot!"

Drake grabs James by the arm, and then pulling him into a headlock. "Nice try, doc. I really understand how this must sound. But we really have no choice in the matter. Don't make me handcuff you."

James struggles as he's being pulled into the headlock. He swings his fists around, bringing them to bear on Drake's injured arm. He starts running again.

Garfield rolls his eyes and thumbs the camcorder on. "And here," he sarcastically narrates, "we have the children working off their excess energy." He pans up and down the street. _Hey, maybe the zoom will come in handy for zombie spotting..._

James continues with his escape attempt. _Have to get away from them. I have to get away from them. The police... they should be around here somewhere. They'll help me. Guy with a shotgun is far more plausible than zombies..._

Drake curses, wincing as his injured arm is hit. _Fu-uck. And here I thought it might stop hurting._ Then he gets an idea. He tosses the taxi keys in Gar's direction. "Bring the car. I'll stay with him." He than chases after James...but stays right behind him, just enough that he could close the gap if he wanted, and so the professor doesn't get out of sight.

Garfield pulls the camera away from his eye as he makes a futile attempt to catch the keys. With a curse, he stoops and retreives them, then hurries over to the only taxi he can see.

James runs for the cab. He checks to see if it's running, or if it's at the very least still got keys in it. _Come on... come on... it has to be here. Crud..._

Garfield smirks as he sees the prof reach the car. "I assume you'll be 'shotgun'?" he calls to Drake. "I'll drive, then."

Drake strides up alongside James. "Hey, doc. I'm sorry, did you think I'd leave the keys in it?" He holds the gun loosely in his right hand.

James nods, "Well you did say it was still running. Uh I wanted to drive." His eyes dart at the gun, held loosely in the fellows right hand. "You know, with your one arm injured..." He then grabs for the gun, trying to wrestle it free from the one-armed man.

Garfield groans.

The professor makes a valiant attempt to snag the gun, dragging the shotgun towards himself with the wild energy of fear. Drake's other arm, the bandaged one, lashes out with inhuman speed and closes around the trigger. A grey finger, capped with a wicked-looking claw, snaps the bandage bindings, and the shotgun discharges itself at James...
