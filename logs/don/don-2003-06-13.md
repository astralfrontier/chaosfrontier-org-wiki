_I'm alive. The worst of it's over now. I got shot... but I'm alive. now, as soon as this blinding pain goes away, I can get home... I should probably call and let 'em know I'm still alive out there, somewhere._ James rests on the bed, trying to ease the pain as he floats in and out of consciousness. He takes pains to assemble his thoughts during these lapses of wakefulness.

after a moment or two, James sits up. "Oh... ow... I shouldn't have done that." His head is turned towards the door... "Was that someone moving about out there? It had better not be. They're not going to come try and kill me again. Relax James, you're in a hospital... and... you're talking to yourself..." He falls silent, internalizing his monologue. _As long as the doc doesn't catch me doing that. Okay... I'll call Mandy and let her know I've been shot, but that I'm okay. I'll tell them to continue with the project and ask if maybe someone can drive down and see about picking me up when they release me. The sooner I get out of this place the better. Bullets hurt. although I'll not be forgetting that anytime soon._ He settles back against his pillow, letting out a long, bedraggled sigh as he realizes just how true his last thought was. He's almost afraid to glance down at his bandages, yet there's this morbid curiosity driving him to peek... he attempts and backs down twice, before taking a deep b

After taking a deep breath, he inclines his head until he can catch a glimpse of what's been bandaged off. James goes wide-eyed and then decides, sleep is good about now. Unfortunately, sleep isn't the easiest thing to come by. He looks about for the nurse-call button. "Maybe someone can make the call for me..."

"Yeah... yeah... no. I got shot. I'm in the hospital. Yes. I'll be taking sick leave for the moment. No, I don't think I'll be out today, just go on without me, I'll call when I am well enough to go." James speaks into the phone, wincing with every word that is said. "Alright. Take care. No, it's best if you don't mention this to the people we get money from. Okay. Thanks... talk to you soon." He hangs up the phone, and offers a pained smile to the nurse. "Thank you."

_Wake up. Wake UP. I can't do anything asleep._ Drake thinks in his mind, inbetween dreaming and waking, his mind filled with strange dreams that he does not comprehend. Finally, his eyes open, his fingers twitching.

Drake blinks. It's morning. And he's...at the hotel? "How the fuck did I get here from last night." he mutters. He checks himself over. One arm, one healed stump. He supposes that's good, overall, seeing as the way the bad arm was acting before. But the way it's healed...doesn't seem natural. "And I'm not in pain. Weird." he says to himself. He goes to the window then, looking at the risen sun. It's up...but it looks strange. As if it's not quite right, for some reason.

Sol shines down on the Earth as it always has; a ball of incandescent gas providing heat, light and life to every growing thing. To Drake's eyes, it looks, and feels... different. As though he were watching it through a television screen, or in a movie. It's bright, but not blinding; brilliant, but not painful to look at directly.

"Cue the creepy music." he murmurs. He exits his room, and goes downstairs. No one at the desk. He goes outside. No one outside. Still as death, just like at night. He runs around, checking stores and buildings...but it all serves to confirm what he believes. "Fuck me. I'm stuck here. I'm not moving back and forth any more." he says dully to the nothingness around him.

Time passes as Drake wanders around, looking for any signs of anything. "So I was wrong. Dying doesn't end this nightmare." he says to a passing mailbox. The mailbox shrugs at him. He finds the liquor store, breaks in, and steals a bottle of Glenfiddich. He pulls on it as he goes, wondering if he can get drunk in this shadow world. "He's a real nowhere man..." he sings to himself. "...walking in his nowhere land, making all his nowhere plans for nobody...doesn't have a point of view, knows not where he's going to, isn't he a bit like you and me..." He's not very good at singing, but he doesn't care. He's not sure he cares about much of anything, anymore.

After what seems like an eternity of walking around, Drake suddenly realizes...he's tipsy. "So...I can still get drunk when I'm dead. How comforting." And then he gets angry. "Fuck this. I'm not going to be like fucking Garfield." He closes the bottle, and then tosses it as far as he can manage, which isn't far in his state. And he screams. "Where are you, you fuck! What do you want from me! Why don't you just come and get me, instead of leaving me to rot in this limbo masquerading as Portland!"

Drake sits on the sidewalk and tries to collect himself. "What the fuck do I do now." he says dully. Finally, he looks up. "The journal. If it's still there, I'm going to fucking find it." But first, he steals a bottle of water and a sandwich from a convenience store, to try and shake off the alcohol he swilled.

Drake makes his way back to the hospital, and into the tunnels. Then he tries to figure out, from where he is, where they found the journal. And he wonders, absently, if the monstrosity is still there. "Wonder what it can do to me. I'm dead now."

It only takes Drake a couple minutes, put he's finally able to find the spot...and the journal is there, right where Gar left it. "Well, one for the fucking home team." he says dully. He reaches out and flips it open, and starts to read.

Seated at his kitchen table, Garfield cradles his head in his hands. He is trying not to think of anything in particular, but his mind isn't being even remotely helpful in this pursuit. Too many images and feelings jumble together in his brain. He peeks above his fingers at the bottle standing on the table before him--there is no glass in sight--but his stomach lurches nausously and he quickly looks away. _What are bitchin' about?_ he growls silently at it. _I haven't even taken the damn cap off it yet!_

He stands abruptly. _Hell with this. No sense drinkin' if I'll just puke it up immediately, and if I can't drink I might as well do something else._ He considers for a moment, eyes on his (empty) fridge. _Food. Maybe some food will settle my stomach. I did promise myself a nice steak, didn't I?_ He shrugs into the coat he'd flung over the back of another kitchen chair. A glance at the stove's clock tells him it'll be steak for lunch rather than steak for dinner, but unsurprisingly he finds he doesn't much care one way or the other about that.

Remembering something, he takes a moment and picks up his phone. He dials into work, not the front desk, but the number to the bus drivers' common area. "Hey, Smitty. ...Yeah, I got home fine, care o' the city's finest. ...No, not the cops, you twit. I took a bus. Listen, tell the bossman I'm takin' some vacation ti-- Err... make that sick time. Hell, I go the perfect excuse, right? ...I dunno, next week sometime, when I'm feelin'... better, or somethin'. ...Yeah, thanks, I'll be sure the rest up. ...Yeah, you too. See ya..." He replaces the phone in its cradle.

Ready to leave, he pins the whiskey bottle with a last, sharp look. "And when I get back, you're goin' down hard, y'hear?" It neither answers nor quivers in fear. He turns away with a snort.

The professor's camcorder sits neglected in coat closet, a battered journal resting beside it, visible through the closet's half-open door. Gar stares at the items for a moment before reaching in and pulling a worn and musty coat of the hanger and carelessly tossing it on top of the items. He kicks the closet closed somewhat harder than he needs to. He then heads out, the door banging shut behind him.

"Stuart Garfield?" The voice is casual, edged with menace, like the house razor at a fine hotel, elegant and inconspicuously lethal. It belongs to a man in a dark business suit, waiting outside Garfield's modest dwelling and flanked by two other men, larger of build and, if brow and eyes are any judge, certainly less wit. Their leader smiles, extending his hand, in which can be seen the white rectangle of a business card. "Joe Ross, from Chicago. I'd like to talk to you."

Garfield blinks at Ross, then flicks his eyes between the two thugs. _Menacing?_ he thinks, rapidly revising his inital impression in light of new experiences. _No, zombies are menacing. And that creature last night was horrifying. This bunch is merely... ordinary._ His eyes return to the fellow in the centre--Ross. Gar's brow drawns down slightly. _Then again, I seem to be short a shotgun..._ Nevertheless, he summons bravado. "Look, I'll have my lawyers call your lawyers and they'll do lunch, or drugs or each other or whatever the hell it is lawyers do. Meantime, I've a lunch date of my own. If you'll excuse me...?" He's not shy about cutting across his lawn to get to the sidewalk and bypassing the goons completely.

Both men move, and both are possessed of greater swiftness than your average bus driver. Even an extraordinary bus driver. "My schedule is tight," deadpans Ross. "Inside with him." And he begins walking unconcernedly toward Garfield's door.

Garfield sighs, and lets himself be led. "Fine, but don't expect me to be civil about this. I don't think I'm even going to offer you a beer." He's surprised to find himself thinking longingly about his currently-misplaced firearm. A bat would be even better--he adds buying a new one to his rather short list of things to do today. _I'll get to it right after this little chat... assuming I'm both alive and still relatively intact, of course._

Inside, Garfield is almost literally tossed into a chair, with the two nameless men standing close watch over him. Ross is taking a seat nearby, his hands occupied with lighting a cigarette and bringing it to his lips. After letting out a slow and smooth puff of smoke, he begins speaking. "Let's get down to business. Drake Sheridan. Bad news, especially for a straight-arrow guy like yourself. Where is he?"

Garfield shakes his head. This isn't exactly what he was expecting. "Uh... Sheridan? Only guy named Drake I know is some low-life puke held me at gunpoint in a damn hospital, frog-marched me downtown, made me steal a bus, shot a cop and then had the bloody _gall_ to look _surprised_ when I pumped a shotgun shell into him. Whatever the hell he was doped up on I seriously wouldn't recommend it--it'll rot your brain real quick." He throws a dubious look at the thugs. He wonders briefly if it'd make any noticable difference with these two. "Anyway, the nice lady at the _next_ hospital's reception told me he kicked the bucket, and it couldn'ta happened to a sweller guy. Wasn't my fault, though, which is a damn shame. I'm sure if you and these fine fellows were to ask the nice reception lady, she'd be more 'n happy to give you a tour of the morgue, an' you could see for yourselves."

Ross listens to all this, nodding calmly. He summarizes his assessment of this remarkable story very simply. "Yep, that's him." He takes another drag of his cigarette, exhales, stands. "He took something, something we want back. It'd be in a suitcase or bag or something of that nature. You're gonna find it for us, or we're gonna deputize you to personally deliver a message to Drake. Which'll it be?"

Garfield scowls. "If it was that arsenal he was carryin' with him, the cops've prol'ly melted it down by now." He shrugs, putting a false look of sympathy on his face.

Ross shakes his head. "No, he wouldn't keep something like that on him.... a hotel, safe-house or hide out of some kind." The man frowns and rests the cigarette between his lips as he speaks. "So. It looks like you're leading the way. Gentlemen?" The thugs \`escort' Garfield to his feet by way of very firm grabs on his shoulders and a none too gentle heave.

Garfield resists momentarily, not that it does much good. "Uh, hello? I saw the punk in a hospital, a bus station, a bus and finally a gas station. Other 'n directions and threats, he didn't exactly say much. Believe it or not, I don't find having guns waved in my face particularly endearing, an' I'm sure he was none too happy with me when I spattered him across the gas pump. Not exactly the best of friends, get the picture? How in bloody hell am I supposed to know his 'safe-houses' or 'hideouts' or whatever? I'm a damn bus driver! I'd think _you'd_ know more about 'im than I ever would!"

"You're our sole lead," explains Ross, as though that solved everything. He follows out the door, politely closing it behind him, and the two goons escort Garfield to a deep blue Ford minivan with tinted windows. "Guess we're off to the hospital first."

Garfield rolls his eyes. "If I'm your sole lead, boy, are _you_ screwed. An' believe me, under the circumstance, this is something I'm _not_ happy about. Just a wild and crazy suggestion: there's this entire profession that prides itself on findin' out stuff. Y'know, detectives? Maybe they could trace his movement from _before_ he kidnapped me in the hospital?"

"That's how we found you," says Ross coolly. He's extinguished the cigarette and is now watching the terrain as it rolls past slowly. "Nice town," he remarks, after a moment, apparently for no reason at all. "Live here long?"

_He's chatting. Why in **hell** is he chatting with me?_ Garfield represses a sigh. "Born an' raised. Dyin's kinda up in the air at the moment."

Garfield throws a glance at Ross. "By the way, what's the name of that detective? I'm thinkin' I'd like to go... hurt his feelings."

"I didn't just hire someone out of the blue; he's uh, a friend of the family," explains Ross, then hushes up. Not a further word can be extracted from him.

Milk would curdle at the look Garfield throws at the van's window, but like the glass of the whiskey bottle on his kitchen table, the window is unfazed. _Is it a good thing or a bad thing that they're not secret agents or thugs from a secret lab? I dunno..._ Muttering in disgust, he settles in for the ride.

Drake grimaces, trying to make sense out of the journal till he figures out why he's having trouble. It's not all in one language. Some of it is clearly english, some stuff that could be latin, from a couple words he's familiar with in the text, and the rest...Arabic maybe? He's seen Arabic letters from news fottage before, he thinks. It does seem to be some sort of medical journal, dating from 1952 on. He skims through it, trying to spot anything relevant to his situation...

Drake reads. He's sitting on one of the boxes, seemingly entralled by what he finds. The dialogue's not complete, but...apparently, the doctor had a patient. A mental patient that was apparently complaining of the same things that have been happening to himself and Gar and Ed. He thought his patient was nuts too...until the patient attacked him, and the doc himself ended up 'between worlds'.

According to the doctor, he never believed he was actually in another dimension...he describes it as a 'virally transmitted mania' that he caught from the patient. He travelled around while stuck between the worlds of light and dark, supposedly finding places where the virus 'wore off': where he could interact with normal people at night, in certain places.

Drake goes back and rereads about the patient: he was apparently hauled away to a mental facility after the assault. The doctor never found out what happened to him after that, though it does mention a name: Siraj al-Del. He skips ahead then, wondering if the man ever found a way out. The second to last entry is a long and involved bit of Latin, with the odd title 'Gateway To The Maze - Proper Approaches' given in English. The last entry, dated in 1968: "My flesh for my life - I go into the Maze. God help me."

Drake just stares at the words. "God help him indeed." _And what does this mean for me? If what I supected happened...if I'm dead...there's no way back for me. Maybe._

Drake takes the journal with him, going back upstairs into the hospital. He raids vending machines for food and drink, pondering amusedly what must be happening in the real world to his actions. And he continues to read, trying to find out more about this Maze.
