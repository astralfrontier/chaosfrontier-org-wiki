# Dead of Night 2003-06-27

The professor's bed, as every hospital bed must, undermines his feelings of self-assurance. It worms its way through his back and legs and arms, crawling up his nerves like an obscene worm that burrows, and every so often, tremors of barely-suppressed disgust ripple through his frames. Forced to rise by his own anxiety, and noted by the doctor as safe to move about until he's discharged, James is moving about the hall. What he does not expect to see is Drake, the one-armed bandit he saw earlier, loitering across from a soda machine, a doctor's casebook propped up on his crossed legs. The man drinks, reading intently as he does.

Drake looks up for a moment...and then blinks. "Doc? What..." He suddenly looks around. "How did you get here? it's still light?"

_Well... smeg._ James is not the happiest person in the world at the moment, though he does realize that being shot in a hospital is something only a truly desperate... insane man would do. _Perhaps if I just proceed onwards, I can avoid a nasty gut-wrenching confronta... bloody smeg._ He blinks, "Still light? Uhm... yes... I have been here for the past few days... er... just don't shoot me... I won't say anything, I swear." He has of course waited for a brief moment of solitude to admit this, before he regards the man with a somewhat pained attempt at a straight and calm face.

Drake sighs. "I didn't shoot you the first time...though I don't expect you to believe that. Hell, the only reason I accept what's happening to me is because I have no choice." he looks up and down the hall, putting down the soda and picking up the book, looking around. "You're free to run away and bring the cops if you want...but if you're here, you're not going to find any. You might find some zombies, though. Try not to scream too loud when they chew on you."

"Uhm... Zombies?" The good doctor gestures towards one of the most decidedly not-zombie patients milling about. "He's most assuredly not a zombie."

Drake blinks. "You can...see people?" He looks stunned. "I...I don't see anyone."

Drake suddenly speaks up. "Okay, wait...if you see people...ask one of them if they see me."

James informs, "Perhaps you should get one of the doctors to check your vision..." He shrugs, and starts backing away from the fellow, quite slowly. _This man is decidedly a lunatic. I'm sure they'll know that soon enough..._ The doc sighs, and then James asks a passerby, "Do you see that fellow sitting over there, reading the book?"

The intern shakes his head. "Nope, haven't seen anyone here doing that. If you are looking for someone, check the front desk," he advises James with a smile, then keeps on walking.

_Alright. Then I suppose I'm the lunatic. And am talking to myself..._ James shakes his head, "Nope... uhm, they say you're not there..."

_Well now. This is an interesting twist._ Drake puts the book under his shoulder, and picks up the nearly empty soda can, and drains it. "But I am here. So somehow, you can see me, in the other dimension. Need more proof?" He tosses the can underhanded at the doctor.

James attempts to catch the can that's lobbed his way. _I may indeed be quite mad. Or this whole thing is some very very elaborate practical joke... I'm leaning towards the first one. Ah well. In for a penny..._

Drake reads the expression on James's face. "You're not mad. The doc in this book thought his patient was mad too...and he was wrong."

Drake chews on his lip. "Here...is there anyone between me and the soda machine, right now?"

"Not that I'm aware of," informs James, who looks quite concerned.

Drake nods. "Good. I'm not a complete psychopath." He hands the journal to James, and then takes out his Glock. "Tell me what happens on your end." He moves to stand with his back against the opposing wall, and aims at the machine...and then fires.

The discharge of the gun in these close quarters stuns James for a moment, and a flash of discordant memories surge to the forefront of his mind at the shocking sound. The vending machine rocks slightly, receiving the bullet. Nobody else notices, at all, as far as James can see.

Drake lowers his weapon, looking with interest at James. "Anyone react to that?"

It seems as though the good doctor has taken cover, as it were, and is now being looked at rather strangely. He coughs nervously, "I uhm... ahem... thought I saw a spider that no one else... must have uh, seen..."

Drake raises an eyebrow. And then he holsters the gun and touches the point of impact. "It left a bullet hole...cracked the plastic in fromt of the Coke logo. Is that invisible to everyone else too?"

"I'm... not sure." James heads near the Coke machine, and then fiddles about, as though he were looking for change in a pocket... he asks a passerby, "Do you have change for a dollar? I wanna get a soda out of the machine." He indicates the machine, by pointing right at the cracked plastice and bullet hole.

The visitor nods and shrugs a bit, fiddling in his pocket for four quarters. He gives no regard to the bullet hole in the machine, a hole that apparently only James and Drake are privileged to see.

The dollar is exchanged, and James gives the machine a test. He feeds it coins, and then presses a button. _Well if I'm mad... then well the machine should work properly... right? If not, then I'm insane. Certifiably._

James blinks, "Well the Machine's not working. So perhaps it's some kind of..." He shrugs. "I must be tired, and imagining things."

Drake sighs. "Doc...turn around a moment."

James turns around...

Drake slaps him across the face, not especially hard, but enough to sting. "**That** is not an illusion. You can't just dismiss this, doc. You're in it deep. Just like me and Gar."

James says, "Oh... I am most assuredly in it deep... I'll be even deeper into it if I stand out here. I'm heading back to my room, where I can talk to myself in peace."

Drake snorts. "Fine. At least give me my book back, then. I'm going to figure out what's going on." _What is this guy's malfunction..._

"The book?" James looks down at it, and curiously flips through a couple of pages, at least to see what this non-existant fellow was reading.

Four men enter the hospital. While one stays behind, asking questions at the front desk, three continue on - Garfield, Joe Ross, and one of his associates. "I could use a drink," remarks Ross, apparently to himself, as they turn the corner. He thrusts a hand into one pocket, reaching about for change.

"So could I..." mutters Garfield, reaching into a pocket for a flask.

Drake sees Gar over James's shoulder, and chuckles. "Hey, Gar...it's a regular reuinion here. Now all we need is Edward..."

Reflexively the nameless associate moves to reach inside his coat, but the action is stopped by the barest shake of Ross's head.

Garfield quickly looks between Drake and Ross, before calmly and deliberately unscrewing the cap and taking a deep swallow. He carefully says not a word.

Drake sighs. "Okay, fine, don't talk to me." he looks at James. "my book?"

Ross, meanwhile, is chucking quarters into the machine. He frowns for a moment, then thumps on it roughly with one fist. "This is why you gotta depend on people," he announces to the world in general. "'cause technology will always let you down when you need it."

"Oh indeed. Indeed. The book." James glancess down at the journal he's holding, unable to resist paging through it, before turning the thing over to Drake. He ponders Ross, and seems a little relieved that the machine isn't working. _Maybe I'm not terribly crazy..._

Garfield takes a closer look at Ross, glances at Drake, then back to Ross. "So, what'd this Drake character steal from you twi-- er, fine people, anyway?"

"Maybe you should ask him when you see him," replies Ross coldly, jamming his thumb against the Change Return button, to no avail. He lobs a rapid kick at the vending machine, sighs, extracts a cigarette from the pack, and puts it to his lips. The man's eyes trail up and left over the wall, observing the NO SMOKING sign, and he lets out a long sigh of resignation.

Drake looks baffled. And then realizes that he's talking to someone in the real world. "Steal...I didn't steal anything...well, except for the food just now...technically..."

Garfield presses on, directly eyeing Drake in front of him. "And you're certain it's the same guy? Short black hair, pale eyes an dskin, bit short, say five-nine, but hefty?"

"Sounds about right," says Ross, eyeing the cigarette he now holds between thumb and forefinger, as though deciding its fate.

Drake blinks. "Gar, who've you got with you? Cops? Or wait..." His eyes suddenly get wider. "Isn't not the Syndicate, is it? Fuck, what do they want? I'm fucking **dead** man....show them the fucking corpse."

Garfield divides a sour look between Drake and Ross. "Swell, Ross. Just swell." He resists a temptation to say anything mouthy to Drake.

Deciding that perhaps discretion is the better part of not being shot in the gut, especially when words like the Syndicate are tossed about, James turns as though he's going to leave.

Drake says, "Hey, doc...my book. You don't want to believe me, fine, but you're not stealing the journal."

Drake moves in front of James.

Grinning at Ross, Garfield offers, "Go ahead, light up. _I_ wouldn't mind if security tossed you out on your butt.

Drake suddenly gets a craving for a cigarette, patting himself down. "Come on, Gar, speak up...hand me a note or something. What do these pricks want? If I'm dead, game's over. I killed one of their guys, and they can't call me on it now, unless they want to draw and quarter the body..."

"Huh? Oh right... uh here you go." James hands the book over, before taking a side-step around these fellows with Garfield. "Although I dunno if they can't see what you can? And vice versa?"

"You guys know each other?" asks Ross suddenly, looking from James to Garfield curiously. "Or are we all just hanging around here having fun?"

A fragment of Ross' pervious words finally catch up with Garfield's attention. "And whaddya mean 'ask him when I see him'? He's dead, prol'ly lyin' on a slab somewhere in this hospital's morgue. Err... what? You're the one itchin' for a soda. I'm just tryin' to figure out what the hell you wnat from me, an' how to keep my skin intact." He addresses the prof. "Go back to bed, buddy You don't want none o' this. Believe me."

Drake takes the book. "They can't, doc...And I don't know why you can, unless us brining you over changed you." With a little effort, since he only has one arm, he manages to get a cigarette out, and light it. "Yeah, keep this Ross fella talking, please...I'd like to know what's the what, here..."

Ross flops down on the bench, while his associate remains standing, casual but ready. He sighs, checks his watch, then starts looking around as though performing some sort of eyeballed, government-mandated inspection. It's an action that carries hints of tension, an undercurrent of shackled impatience. It's then that the third man comes around the corner and approaches Ross. He leans over, whispering for several seconds in the man's ear..

"I'm off to bed, no worries there." James heads off in that direction, apparently talking to himself. Or Drake. "I suppose not. Just the same, I could use a bit of rest." He coughs, and makes his way back to his room... as casually as he can.

Drake sidles over right next to Gar. "I actually found some intersting shit out, man...now the trick is getting these Guidos away from you...if they're Syndicate, they'd just as soon kill you as look at you."

Garfield says, "Oh for God's-- Look, you invade my house with some bullshit story about a punk who kidnapped--_kidnapped!_\--me stealing somehting from you. An' while you won't tell me what it is, you expect me to help you recover it--despite the fact that blowing off the punk's arm is about as close as we ever got, the highlight of an altogether crappy relationship. And now you're havin' a whispered heart-to-heart like ya don't know what's goin' on. Y'know, it's enough to make me lose faith in America's finest criminal institutions...." He mutters some more unintelligibly, then takes another swallow from his flask.

"Excuse me while I shed a tear," says Ross, curtly, then receives the last few moments of whispered communication. "Apparently our friend Drake is seeing the police. Or, well, not seeing much of anything, though the police are seeing him. So, let's start by recreating the kidnapping, Mr. Garfield. Where did it all begin? Lead the way."

Drake chuckles wryly. "That's right...corner them with logic..." He scratches his stubble. "What the fuck do they want...all I had was seven-fifty in bills, my equipment, a change of clothes, and my false ID. I never stole the cash I was owed from the heist..."

"Mr. Garfield is my father," Garfield replies automatically. "Begin? Christ. In the university hospital. An' what's this about the police? They hire a psychic medium?"

"No, just a coroner, the usual," says Ross in a dismissive tone. "University hospital..." He leans over, receiving another whisper. "OHSU? Good enough. Let's go." And he begins walking again, while his two associates flank Garfield. "Always wanted to go back to college.."

Drake sighs, flicking his lighter nervously, in spite of the fact that **he** is in no danger. And then he puts away his Zippo and takes out his gun as he follows. "Where is this fuckhead Ross? Maybe, jsut maybe, I can put a bullet in his head..."

Garfield casts a frown over his shoulder at Drake. _Hmm..._ He makes as if to clap Ross on the back, halting as if he suddenly thinks better of it. "So, Ross. Y'say they hired a psychic coroner, then?"

"Sure. Right now he's reading my thoughts, and he hears, 'Shut the fuck up'," Ross says, ever the sparkling conversationalist. He leads the way toward the front door of the Legacy building, aiming for the parking lot.

Drake grins wolfishly. "That's a boy." He moves around Garfield, aiming approximately where Garfield was gesturing as he walks. "Hasta la vista, baby." He pulls the trigger...

The round echoes, though Garfield wasn't quite checking Drake's aim with his own eyes. One far-off wall puffs as the bullet passes through it. Ross continues walking, absolutely unruffled.

Drake glances at Garfield, looking hopeful. "I get him?"

Silently, Garfield shakes his head. _Ah, balls..._

Drake growls, slamming the butt of his Glock against the wall. "Fuck! Well, it was a good idea..."
