# Dead of Night prelude-drake

"Quality healthcare" is tough to find for guys in certain lines of work. Still, if one is subtle enough, the muscle-ache from an old trail of gunshot wounds can be passed off as merely one more of the difficulties involved in having a human body. When it develops into a persistent pain, though, enough to leave flashes in front of the eyes, it comes time to see someone with a little professional reliability. Thus, the phone call which has just concluded. Students are cheaper, less prone to notice odd signs, and often available. An appointment has been made for tomorrow; now, all that's left is to wait and ponder this new city and its potential.

Drake reaches into a coat pocket for a packet of Kool Lights he left there. He fishes out one of the menthol cigarettes, screws it to his lips, and lights it with his gold zippo. And then snaps it closed in that fancy way they always do in the movies. He likes the movies, even if he's the kinda guy that always gets killed in them. Taking a puff, he looks up and down the street. Being chased by the Syndicate does make one paranoid, but it's more than that. Wherever he goes, wherever he is, he's always on the lookout for potential marks. His stash of cash money is getting low, and if he's going to keep one step ahead of the Syndicate, he needs money. If he's going to live, he needs money. So, he looks.

Somewhere, up ahead, a cluster of men break apart and spiral off along their own separate vectors. Each drifts through the morass of hippies and bedenimed counterculturalists, the products of California and its mindlessly virulent memes, the men in suits and jackets who work here for Intel's throbbing hive of business and technology and all the parasites who cling on its corporate coattails. The bluebloods and tie-dyes mix together on the street, and through it all drifts one of the five men who just left Brannigan's - a business meeting. Influential customers. The man finishes pocketing his wallet, fishes for some cigarettes, his attention diverted. Simple.

Drake doesn't smile, not externally. He really dislikes those executive pricks. Of all the marks in the world, they're the sort that need to be taken down a peg. He wouldn't kill them, of course. He doesn't kill guys for just being pricks. But relieving them of their valuables is always a good use of his time. He strides over to the man, seemingly oblivious to his presence, and bumps into him as he glides past, enough to grab his attention...but not to something other than his hand that reaches towards the pocket the man's wallet half hangs out of.

Sure enough, knowing fingers deftly snag the leather, transmitting pictures of alligators up through nerves. The man moves on, none the wiser, half-silently cursing the clumsy fools who frequent downtown. For ten seconds of work, and the risk of a few decades in the clink, $108,000 an hour is not a bad salary.

Drake slips the wallet into his duffel for later perusal. _Easy money._ he thinks to himself. A delayed reaction reveals he hit a sore spot when he bumped into the man, but he doesn't even wince. He taught himself a long time ago how to ignore pain. Pain was information, but not something to be feared, and not something to slow you down. He continues down the street. Just one of the regular joes. No one important. Most people never looked twice at Drake Sheridan. Except when he had that dangerous look in his eyes...and if you saw that look, odds were you wouldn't live long enough to be able to spread the word that this ordinary looking man was a killer, when necessary. _Dierdre knew, though._ And as soon as he thinks it, Drake shuts off the thought.

It's just then that Drake decides he needs something to do. Thinking about Dierdre never helps. He grabs a newspaper out of a bin, and starts looking for a local theatre. A flick with gunfights will do, whether the plot's shit or not. Gunfights were actually relaxing, even more so when he wasn't the one being shot at.

A couple of hours spent in a darkened room, watching too much light flaring on a too-small screen with too-noisy theatergoers, isn't the best way to spend an afternoon, but it's far from the worst. Nearly everyone exhibits the same characteristics here - not in skin color, sex, age or any other physical definable. They're all college types, and the academic influence of the numerous colleges and schools in the area shows. Bookbags, backpacks, sacks, logo-stamped T-shirts and sweatshirts. Glasses. Eyes, still attentive, still unable to see the world for the tattered wreck it really is and looking instead at the shining mirage of youthful optimism.

Absently, as he looks at the kids stiffling laughter, or a girl cuddling up to his boyfriend, Drake reflects on what it would be like to be 'normal'. if he went to college, met a girl that knew nothing about shooting a gun, married, raised kids. Would the illusion make him feel better? Would it soothe the ache he feels now? He'd never considered a life other than his before the big score. Before Dierdre. The kind of money he'd have gotten, he'd never have to steal from another mark in his life. But then, what would he do? What would be be? And then he shuts those feelings off again, and smiles as he watches some scumbag get it right between the eyes. _That's simple, at least._

A briefly-startling sight out front - two somewhat bulky gentlemen in ill-fitting suits, looking dully unhappy and mumbling to each other. This momentary source of panic is dispelled when two women - wives, possibly, or girlfriends - come out of the women's room together and laughingly rejoin their company. The four stroll away together, apparently merely a pair of sociable friends or couples.

Drake stares dully after them. _Just folks. Not marks, just folks._ After a moment of watching them recede, he decides ti try it. Be something other than he is. Do something...completely different. He grabs a tourists map as he goes past a stand, and picks a place at random. Crystal Srpings Rhododendron Garden. Flowers. _That's normal, right? Normal people like flowers. Guys that don't make their living putting holes in other people's vital organs like flowers._ So he goes there, to see what he can see.

The Garden isn't open for more than a few hours longer, but Reed College is an easy landmark to find and the Garden isn't much further. A few acres of simple, blooming color begin to put the mind at ease, and even the twinge of pain that lingers even now in the spinal column seems appeased.

Drake finds himself surprised that the myriad blooms would affect him so. But , watching the patterns of reds, blues, and pinks, he finds that that might have been three dollars well spent. He almost forgets the weight of the glock under his shoulder. But as he leaves, the sky starts turning grey, and the first droplets of a coming shower begin to fall. Drake turns up his collar and keeps going. Other than that, he doesn't worry about the rain. He just screws another menthol to his lips and keeps going. _Like Bruce fucking Banner. Always wandering. That's what I've become._ Just like that, the calm he gained is dispelled, and he remembers why he's here. On the run, instead of being in familiar surroudings. Leo Guzman. He was a prick too, but this prick tried to kill him. So he returned the favor. Only that resulted in the big Syndicate boys coming after him, because they can't have some no-name scum offing one of their lieutenants. So here he is, in the rain, with a grand in cash, a change of clothes,

2 packs of menthols, and several thousand dollars in false ID. And no where to go except somewhere that he won't be killed.

Fortunately such intrusions, like all else in the city, are left behind at the doors of the Garden. A pair of thugs don't pop out of the pots and unload semi-automatic weapons. There is no car-bomb waiting. Walking through the arch was like diving into a pool of tranquility. Back outside, the restful waters of emotional peace have been replaced with the insistent, annoying drip-dripping of rain.

Drake wanders through the rain. "What the hell. Might as well find a place to stay." he says to no one in particular. At least now his wandering has a purpose, as he heads out of the commercial district, looking for some cheap shithole to call his own. Well, maybe one that has cable, at least.

The hotel is easy to find; it's the synthesis and sublimation of all cheap hotels everywhere. Low-rent, reliable, anonymous enough. The manager takes cash, and needs little else to ensure a comfortable room. The television doesn't work that well, and the bed is rough, but it'll do.

Drake is pleased enough. People who aren't chatty-Charlies and who mind their own business are the lifeblood of your average criminal. makes things much easier. He now has a place to sleep, and to lay out his duffel. He extracts the cash from the chump's wallet now, and looks at the licence. _Kyle Tucker. Christ. This guy even has an asshole's name._ it doesn't look anything like him, but he keeps the wallet for now. There was an associate of his that was heavy into video games that once said you should hold onto anything that could be useful, as you never know if you'll need it. _Of course, he was talking about Zork._ Still, a guy like him learned to trust his instincts. Then he tests the window leading to the fire escape. That's when a cat hisses at him. Drake stares dully at the cat. _I hate cats._ He considers shooting it, briefly. He settles for a quick violent sweep of the hand that sends it falling off the edge. But it twists in mid air and lands on something short of the ground, and hi

and hisses at him again. _I reiterate, I hate cats._ He closes the window.

He turns on the TV. He turns on the news, just out of curiosity. it doesn't reveal anythnig telling. There's no talk of a man named Jake Bafford found dead. Or a Guy Patrick. Or a Kevin Berthold. Especially not a week after he killed them. And there's definitely nothing on Leo. Or Dierdre. he wondered where she was. He wondered if she still loved him. If she ever loved him, or if he was just **her** mark. Leo died before he could shed any light. "It's officially time to get drunk." he announced to an empty chair. The chair didn't argue. They never did. He promptly leaves the hotel and looks for a liquor store.

"Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker," announces a half-remembered voice, some movie crawling its way out of the subconscious. Outside, two men are talking to each other on the street. Their eyes flash, simultaneously, to the departing figure as the door of the motel creaks outward in vain protest at his passage. The look is one of quick study, and after a heartbeat's hesitation they're back to their normal conversation.

Drake learned a long time ago never to trust appearances. Which is why the whole Dierdre thing sent him for a loop. His instincts failed him there, somehow. He pretends to ignore the men. But his hand slips under his coat, briefly, carressing the handle of his Glock. If he could, he'd swivel his ears to listen behind him.

A few moments of conversation, unheard and possibly without meaning, segue into two pairs of walking feet. As Drake makes his way down the sidewalk, moving through dusk on a surface of faintly-glistening, rain-stained concrete, one of the men ambles his way up the street in the same direction. The other has apparently crossed the street but seems to be moving in the same fashion. No more detail can be drawn without exposing oneself to scrutiny in return; casual, furtive glances around at mirrors and windows can only tell one so much.

Drake knew, then. _This, I'm trained for. Me and Steven Seagal._ The stalk. Pretending to be the mark, waiting for the right time to turn the tables on the hunters. This made sense. Not much else did.

Drake leads his shadows away, into the dark and the rain. Seeking solitude. And then, at the right moment, in between one eyeblink and the next of the man behind him, Drake is gone, ducked down an alley.

And there he crouches, lying in wait.

Moments pass. One of the men - the guy on this side of the street - passes by the mouth of the alley way and continues, apparently, on his own business. More time passes. Still more.

It's observed, however, that the man across the street has not passed by. The only possible place he could have turned on his side was into one of the many buildings and shops lining the far side. Whatever the case, though, ample time has been provided for him to pass by.

Drake taps the barrel of his gun. _Okay, so, either these guys are innocent - possible, but unlikely - or they didn't come from 1-800-Rent a Thug._ A smart man might try and just head away. Drake wasn't stupid, but he also wanted to know who these guys were. And he wasn't afraid of them, whoever they were. So he comes back out of the alley, zipping up his fly as if he'd just stopped to take a leak. And he scans the soggy streets.

Far Side is, apparently, having a chat with a decently attractive young lady with a folded-up, dripping umbrella - a tourist, judging by the city map she's holding onto and pointing at, with her companion providing narration. The rain has stopped, and with it the potential for social interaction has crept its way onto the damp streets. Near Side is nowhere to be seen - turned a corner, slid into a building, something.

Drake lights up another cigarette, watching the man. _If at first you don't succeed, the hell with it._ He starts looking around for a liquor store again. He's thirsty, damn it. Besides. If they are after him, they'd move eventually. And when it was over, there'd be two less folks sucking air.

The liquor store, like the product it sells, is wrapped behind a facade of innocent, vice-concealing brown panelling. It's manned by an overly rotund man in his late 40's or 50's, who greets the next potential customer cordially enough. Something about his mein suggests disinterest, and even as his eyes track the head movements of the newcomer they tend to defocus - he's lost in contemplation, inner-directed and uninterested in the affairs going on outside. Boredom, meditation, or habitual drug use, what matter? The three tend to blur into each other anyway.

Drake browses, and decides on a case of Sam Adams, a bottle of Jack Daniels, and a kitchy shot glass with the local college university's symbol on it. _IT's the little homey touches._ He makes sure it's all packed in one bag. If He's got to carry two, it'll take him an hour and a half to get to his gun. He pays and leaves promptly. Looking out for Mister Left, and Mister Right.

\*\*\*Delete last pose.

Drake browses, and decides on a case of Sam Adams, a bottle of Jack Daniels, and a kitchy shot glass with the local college university's symbol on it. _IT's the little homey touches._ He makes sure it's all packed in one bag. If He's got to carry two, it'll take him an hour and a half to get to his gun. He goes to the counter to pay.

It's at the counter that everything happens. The door swings wide - two masked men, their coats zipped up against nonexistent rain, ski masks warm and dry, features unidentifiable, duck well under the clearly-readable height markers on the doorjamb. Each has his hand wrapped firmly and professionally around the butt of a pistol, and each has his trigger at the ready. These are men for whom the safety is just one more moving part that can jam at the wrong time, and their body language screams aggression. "This is a holdup!" one jerks out, slurring the words in a deliberate attempt to confuse the particulars of his voice. "Don't nobody move."

Drake looks at the men like a cat might look at mice. _Wrong store, wrong fucking time._ he thinks. He doesn't say it, because, unlike a movie, it's a showy gesture of bravado that would cost him crucial seconds. All this goes through his mind like a bullet. His body is busy diving behind one of the wine racks. he rolls, and comes up in a crouch, his hand on his gun.

The roll is quick, full of effort, and painful - but less painful than the bullet whose ricochet off the floor so close to one's ear reminds its intended victim of the true thread from which life can hang sometimes. "We got a hero," growls one to the other, and quickly the man nearest the counter commands his spaced-out victim: "Money. Sack. Now, old man." A thumb caressing a hammer can be inferred from the soft clicking sound. Meanwhile, footfalls betray the efforts of the other to locate the solitary customer the store enjoyed.

Drake's breath eases out in an unheard sigh. A round is chambered in his Glock, and he whirls out from behind a colorful rack of cheap wines, and sends a Next Second FedEx of lead screaming towards the first ski mask he sees.

A snarled cry of pain and a welter of curses rises from the wounded would-be mugger, and his partner turns, having instantly assessed the situation. "Get outta here!" he yells huskily, then turns his attention back to the half-opened bag already on the counter. Snatching it up with one hand, waving his pistol with the other, he pushes the door roughly open and grabs his compatriot by the shoulder (eliciting a pained response in the process). Their moves were slick, professionally timed, even under surprise - fellow professionals. There really is no honor among thieves.

Perhaps in some sort of cosmic retribution or synchronicity of act with reward, Drake's wounded adversary stumbles through the door, and his passage makes visible the unobtrusive but all-seeing security camera which guards the establishment. Hard to see, unless you're looking right at it - as Drake is doing, right now.

Drake curses. _Well, fuck._ He makes an effort then to guard his face as he makes his way to the counter, looking for the store owner.

The few seconds of distraction were enough to send that worthy charging for the back room, apparently to call the police or perhaps just to hide.

Drake hesitates. He could just leave, but if there's a chance that that camera has his face, and that the tape is here, he's got to take it. He moves to the back room, pushing the door open, gun still in his hand.

The shaken liquor-store owner is already dialing the antique rotary, face white and sweat-streaked. He turns, trembling at the sense of intrusion, then smiles widely. "Oh, it's you.. man, I owe you big... Yes, hello? 911..?"

Drake comes over and puts the barrel of the gun on the hang-up switch. "If you owe me big time, then, you can tell me where the feed from your camera is piped to." he says flatly.

The man shakes his head, confused for just a moment. "A private security company," he replies in a daze. Then his eyes stray down to the gun. The thoughts that race through his head are clearly writ on his face - the gun, the camera question - all of it begins to collect itself. ".. Oh shit," he whispers, pale and trembling.

Drake chuckles internally. _I wouldn't kill you. It wouldn't help me, anyway. But it's nice to know I can make a guy sweat._ He smiles at the man coldly. "Let me explain how this is going to go down." He takes out his wallet, and counts out two hundred dollars. "This covers a bit of your losses, maybe all since they didn't get out witch the whole stash. There's no damage to your store. There was never a robbery here. I take my purchases, and leave. I was never here, and in a couple weeks, the tape with my face on it gets bulk erased in a week. This solution leaves you hale and whole. Otherwise, it's do not pass Go, do not collect Two hundred dollars. Comprende?"

\*\*\*\*\*\*And clearly, I'm tired because I put a redundant 'in a week' in there. Delete that, pelase. :}

"S-sure," stutters the now-fully-awake proprietor. He scoops up the proffered cash - a reflex whose execution will not be slowed or hindered even by an imminent threat on his life and prosperity - and stuffs it into one pocket, slowly edging the handset of the phone back to its cradle. "I.. I never saw you, mister," he mumbles, eyes downcast as if even now trying not to take in the details of face, posture and attire.

"Remember that." Drake replies. "Have a nice day. And buy a shotgun." He takes his purchases and exits. With any luck, he'll run into the assholes on the way home, and he can kill them for making him waste good money keeping a store clerk quiet. Either that, or he'll go home, get drunk, and puke. "And that'll be fun too.
