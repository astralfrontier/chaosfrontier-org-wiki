# Epochs 2010-04-17

Two adventurers stand willing to enter the theopolis of Thosh, a dwarven god-city. In the snowy wilderness at the main entrance, the dwarven priest Hemik pronounces a few short benedictions to protect them. And he also extends both hands, each gripping a peculiar glowing rock. "Aside from the rune-coins, take these as well. They'll provide light in the dark parts of the city." He has enough leather straps that the stones can be affixed to equipment, leaving hands free for more important business.

Kyshtym says, "Thank you, will they expire in any short time?"

"They are as eternal as Thosh himself," Hemik replies proudly.

Kyshtym says, "Outstanding! I'm sure they will come in handy then."

Lira nods in thanks.

Kyshtym affixes his stone to his pack.

Kyshtym says, "We'd best get a move on. Coming Lira?"

Lira shrugs, "Might as well!"

The tunnel presents itself - a gloomy corridor into the depths of the mountain. But with the lightstones, it reveals itself as nothing more than bare rock. Within a hundred paces, the pair find themselves inside the regularly geometric precision of dwarven architecture. The room is bare, with signs of drying bloodstains on the floors and walls. Clearly fighting has taken place here in the past.

Dwarven doors of iron, attached to the rock via a complicated hinge arrangement, lead out to the west and to the north. Between the twin doors to the north, a series of runes are engraved in the wall.

Kyshtym \[to Lira\]: "Do you read any dwarven runes?"

Lira nods to Kyshtym, "I'm probably a bit rusty, but yes."

Kyshtym says, "Better rusty than not at all. I'm afraid all I know is the common speech and draconic."

On closer inspection, ignoring the red stains, the runes can be made out to read: "Southern Barracks". Below this, a warning: "Speak to the warden before proceeding".

Kyshtym \[to Lira\]: "If there are any other survivors present, I would imagine they are resting in the barracks. Shall we take a look?"

Lira \[to Kyshtym\]: "Yeah, we'd better start looking around."

Kyshtym heads to the western door.

Lira chuckles, "I was just about to suggest that we start by checking out what's behind that door."

The door had provisions for a locking mechanism, but that appears to have been damaged by something heavy, like a sledge or a battering ram. Listening carefully, the dragonborn hero can make out the sounds of a crackling fire on the far side.

Kyshtym pushes gently on the door for a better peek inside.

Beyond the door, just a few feet away, is another door - lockable from its own side. Kysh realizes that this must be a security measure - a chokepoint, allowing the dwarven protectors of the city more protection from enemies breaking through the door.

Kyshtym says, "It is just another door..."

Kyshtym tries the handle of the next door.

Behind the door, he now hears signs of movement. Something has heard him speak, and is preparing itself.

Kyshtym says, "Sounds like something on the other side."

Kyshtym readies his shield and the rune-coin.

Kyshtym \[to Lira\]: "I will try to open the door, are you ready?"

Lira stands back and nods, "Go ahead, if something goes wrong I'm right behind you."

Kyshtym says, "Hail, I come to assist, hold your fire."

Kyshtym attempts to open the door.

The door opens. Kyshtym sees what's behind it immediately - a dwarven brazier, burning hungrily, and rows of bedrolls crudely placed along the walls. A grate lies at the far end of the room, embedded in the floor. Most importantly, he makes out two kobolds, and the least servants of the fire dragons - scuttling insects called fire beetles.

Kyshtym says, "Blast! Not the kind of company we wanted!"

Two of the beetles scuttle close to the door, intent on attacking the newcomer. One of them slashes with its mandibles at the paladin, but is easily pushed back. The other chitters in agitation.

Kyshtym swings a strike with his longsword at the fire beetle with a resounding crack on its shell.

Behind the beetles, the two kobolds chitter and gabble and scurry into position. Both heft their primitive spears, and one of them manages to catch the paladin painfully in the shoulder. The other clatters to the floor near Lira's feet.

One of the beetles scurries into the narrow corridor between the doors, biting viciously into Kyshtym's leg. And the other lets forth a gout of flame which ignites the corridor, washing over the closest beetle's carapace but scalding the dragonborn.

Kyshtym lets out a frigid blast from his maw at the beetles chilling them to the core.

Without weapons, both kobolds now reach down to the bedrolls lining the room, grasping new spears and readying them for the attack.

Lira fires, missing her first target but thrashing the closer mark.

The nearest beetle, close to death, vomits forth a gout of fire that finally overcomes the paladin's defenses. As he falls, its fellow rushes the troublesome archer in the back, biting at her leg.

One of the skirmishers rushes forward, slamming the door shut and gibbering at the other one. It seems discretion is the better part of valor - already wounded and chilled, they have no interest in continuing this fight personally. Let the surviving fire beetle do its worst.

Lira dodges about the room, firing at the beetle with such force it almost knocks the beast out cold.

From the south, Lira can hear something approaching. She looks down the tunnel to see Hemik huffing and puffing, making the best time he can. "They got this far!" he gasps, arriving in the barracks entrance to see the corpses of two fire beetles. "Ah, not again," he mutters. After a few moments he recites some prayers, directing restorative fire into the body of Kyshtym.

Kyshtym grumbles, "We really have to stop meeting like this. You have my thanks again, that is twice I owe you my life."

Lira lets out a nervous chuckle, "That really comes in handy, doesn't it?"

"What happened? Where'd they come from?" demands Hemik.

Kyshtym says, "From the barracks, there are still at least two kobolds inside."

Lira points at the corridor.

"Ah, this can't stand!" yells the dwarf. "Open the door, hero. I'll support you both. We can't let them hold ground so close to the outside."

Lira blinks and snaps to attention, preparing for a fight.

A surprised kobold skirmisher takes Hemik's crossbow bolt to the chest as Kyshtym re-opens the door.

As Kyshtym advances warily, shield up, he spots more occupants. The two goblins stand ready to attack. But to his right, a cruel-looking birdlike creature stands guard over two thoroughly bound and trussed figures: a human and an eladrin. Both look bloody and disheveled.

Kyshtym calls out, "There are others in here, they are in dire straights though!"

The kobolds attack - uselessly. But one of them whistles, and the bird creature flaps its way toward Kyshtym as well.

It flaps in the paladin's face, clawing and scratching, but he's ready this time, and its claws do little more than screech across his shield.

Lira moves quickly into position, firing into the room repeatedly to help fight off the menacing stirge.

Lira lands two shots soundly and grins, satisfied.

While Lira does well, the priest counts himself as less successful. A crossbow bolt twangs off the far stone wall, to no effect.

Kyshtym bellows loudly while stabbing the kobold squarely in the chest before retreating back to the corridor.

The surviving kobold has no particular desire to be first in line to be attacked, so it holds back. The stirge, however, has neither cowardice nor reason, and presses forward on its master's command.

Kyshtym swings at the kobolds sword arm, slicing a tendon in the process.

The wound distracts the kobold, who thrusts uselessly with its spear and misses entirely. It glibbers and gleeps, realizing that it stands alone.

Kyshtym shouts out to the others, "The last one is to the right side of the door!"

Kyshtym strikes true with another blow to the arm~

Lira finishes off the remaining pest, pelting it with arrows until it gets the message and dies.

Hemik lets out a long sigh of relief. "Well done, heroes," he breathes.

Kyshtym says, "We can pat ourselves on the back after we've seen to these two. I hope they are still alive."

Kyshtym checks the two tied up, and bloodied adventurers.

The two figures on the bed rolls are sorely wounded, but Hemik's ministrations slowly rouse them to consciousness. They are a human and an eladrin, perhaps adventurers like Kyshtym and Lira. The human is the first to speak. "Mor.. Morocco is my name," he manages, through parched lips. "Wineskin.. in the corner. Water.." Hemik hurries off to retrieve it, leaving the victors of the fight against the kobolds to question the wounded.

Kyshtym says, "What happened to you two? Was it an ambush?"

Morocco nods. "There's others further north, in the barracks proper," he replies, then takes a short drink of water. "We broke through here yesterday, fighting the Strife Hand goblins, only to be ambushed by kobolds. We.. we ran away, hoping to reach the outside. It's worse than we thought when we came here."

Lira raises an eyebrow, "Strife Hand?"

Kyshtym says, "If you're willing, we can help you find your comrads after you've healed. With the 4 of us we can make a good team against them."

Morocco nods. "The Strife Hand tribe of the goblin nations. Mercenaries, serving who-knows-who, but united under some sort of banner."

Kyshtym asides to Hemik, "Not that I'll count you out, but I'm sure you'll want to get back to your post if I'm not mistaken."

The eladrin receives a short sip of water from Hemik as well, and speaks quietly in the soft and musical voice typical of his people. "Rioja am I, late of the sky. Join you we will, and goblins we'll kill."

Hemik withdraws and nods. "I'm no fighter or champion or any such thing," he admits. "I'd be a burden to you, and it's not cowardice that speaks for me. But I'll do my best to send other suitable sorts in behind you, if they should arrive."

Kyshtym says, "Good, we should rest for now, and get our strength back."

Kyshtym \[to Lira\]: "Any objections lass?"

Lira looks thoughtful, "One stranger is as strange to me as any other. It sounds like we could use some help if we're jumping into this mess."

Kyshtym says, "I certainly am, but you're under no obligation to help them. Still, if we plan to go further, a true party would do best against any adversaries."

Further investigation of the little side-room reveals the equipment taken from Morocco and Rioja, which they're happy enough to reclaim. And there's something else: piled inside one of the drainage pipes on the western end of the room are other goods which neither adventurer lays claim to. One is a suit of black meteoric plate armor, and the other a suit of leather-worked armor of the sort Lira's already wearing, but with a series of arcane runes inscribed across its surface.

Kyshtym says, "Right, lets bar up this door for now and get some rest then."

Kyshtym checks, and finds two rune-coins among the spoils. Morocco and Rioja quickly reclaim them, and demonstrate their fealty.

Kyshtym nods.
