# Epochs 2010-04-24

With Hemik heading back to his post at the entrance, the two captives have been released and are now re-arming themselves. Morocco, the brash human soldier and Rioja, the eladrin spellcaster, briefly explain themselves as the group rests.

"Further in, you see, teleport circles brought he and me. We pushed south and found great danger, as did you, o paladin and ranger." Rioja takes a brief drink of water from his canteen. "Now the dwarves beyond are beset, and I think it's going we ought to get."

Morocco agrees. "The fighting's bound to be gettin' worse. We should get in there and help those guys soon."

Kyshtym nods, "I hope we don't chance upon a pile of corpses."

Kyshtym says, "If you are ready, I am. Lira?"

Lira nods.

Morocco finally gets up and heads back to the entrance room. "Beyond's the armory, where the soldiers would gather to make a stand to defend the entrance," he explains. "There's two doorways so as to let the dwarves block one if they need, or trap incomin' enemies."

Kyshtym nods to the right path as well.

With that decided, Morocco and Rioja take left. Carefully the warlord opens his door, mindful of making a sound beyond, and motions to the dragonborn to do the same.

The double doors lead into narrow, cramped hallways - tall indeed for dwarves, but with little more than a bit of headroom for bigger folk. Like before, there's a short corridor into which the defenders of this place could bottleneck their opponents.

Inside the chamber beyond - the very size and shape of the entrance hall - a series of barricades have been hastily erected. A crude campfire burns beyond. Two doors lead off to the east, and one in the northwest corner.

Most importantly, almost a dozen kobolds are here. Most are clustered round the eastern doors, with arms at the ready - they're prepared for something to come through, or perhaps milling about before actually committing themselves to going in. Behind the barricades, a pair of sling-armed kobolds are gabbling at each other in the kobold tongue. They are surprised indeed to see armed adventurers enter from the _south_, an area thought to be secured by their fellows.

Lira, taking advantage of the element of surprise, fires through the corridor into the kobolds. Both her first shots land soundly, killing the minions as if they had lined up to die.

The eladrin wizard recites a tongue-twisting incantation, and a cloud of energetic force knives springs into existence around one of the surprised slingers. They slash and cut and whirl, and the surprised creature yelps in pain.

Ahead of him, Morocco charges forward to block the two slingers from escaping - their barricades have now suddenly become a prison.

The other slinger retains enough presence of mind to stab at the man as he passes, but his objective has been met - trap the slingers, and in particular the one suffering from Rioja's ongoing force attack.

Lira moves forward, continuing to pick off targets one by one.

Kyshtym growls menacingly at the second slinger, chants a small prayer and swings, but aims a bit too high over the kobold's little head.

The scuttling slinger isn't able to use its sling from here, so it craftily stabs at the paladin using its bloodied dagger before slipping out from under his shield and blade.

The other slinger, seeing its chance, also manages to wound Kyshtym with its own knife, and finally escapes the cutting blades of force which have left it bloodied and ragged.

Through the door comes Rioja, raising a crystalline orb in his hand and shouting something. Patches of snow and jagged spikes of ice emerge from the ground in the northeast corner of the room, where the remaining kobolds are still coming to their senses.

Before they can act, they've fallen and impaled themselves, or frozen to death in the sudden and intense cold.

"Die ya maggot!" Morocco shouts, but his aim is spoiled. The slingers are agile little pests, and his chosen target eludes him.

The remaining kobold on the east side of the room scuttles north, and starts yiping at a quiescent fire beetle. These uncanny insects seem to be pets or companions of the kobolds, and the minion is rousing it to action.

Kyshtym swipes at the slinger that first stabbed him, and manages to knock the kobold on the side of the head.

Lira fires blindly into the room as she backs up in panic to avoid the approaching slinger, but in her haste fails to hit anything with a pulse.

The first slinger doesn't manage to injure Kyshtym, but does manage to back away from him. The second, seeing an easier target, stabs at Rioja, eliciting a grunt of pain from the wizard.

In response, Rioja steps backward through the door. He shouts his incantation again, conjuring a cloud of daggers to engulf the minion who scurried away.

"Get in there!" Morocco yells, distracting one of the slingers for a moment. Though his heavy broadsword sinks into the wood of the improvised barrier rather than the flesh of the kobold, he's positioned himself - and the paladin - just where he wants.

The fire beetle scuttles forward. Kyshtym remembers fighting these creatures before and braces himself when it unleashes a torrent of flame from its gaping maw.

Kyshtym's armor glows a firey red before he lets loose with a frigid blast from his maw chilling the second slinger and fire beetle to their marrow.

Lira feels a bit bolder and moves back towards the room, but still misses her mark as she gets her bearings.

The easternmost slinger backs away from Kyshtym, hoping to pelt him with sharpened stones. This doesn't end well, but at least he's out of reach.

The other, still bleeding from the wounds it took due to a cloud of knives, wants vengeance - and lunges at Rioja to extract it.

The wizard responds by vanishing from sight. He reappears in a surge of mystical white power on the opposite side of the barricade, and shouts out an invocation that calls forth a tremendous surge of lightning.

The kobold in the corner is out of range of it, by the fire beetle takes it full bore, and is slammed painfully against the wall - right in front of Kyshtym.

The warlord wastes no time in advancing on the slinger who intended the death of his partner, swinging his blade at the cowardly kobold and daring it to make a move.

The fire beetle shakes off its stunned state, looking around. Not being the brightest of beasts, it decides to try and chew on the paladin.

The pinned slinger is slippery indeed. It evades Kyshtym's bobbing blade and puts its back to one of the doors. But the divine magic of Bahamut still compels it, and it can't simply stab at the nearby wizard. It strikes at Kysh again with a gibbering curse.

His compatriot in the other corner has little better success with Morocco, and knows it.

Rioja casts another of his thunderous attacks, slamming the kobold hard against the wooden door and eliciting a pained yelp.

"Don't give up!" shouts Morocco from beyond the barrier, engaged in furious sparring with the wiry little creature. "Kysh! Get up, man!" And the paladin can feel it - Morocco's exuberant energy, the need to keep his compatriots protected, the need to press on.

The fire beetle spins about and clacks its mandibles together. It feels pain, but seemingly not fear. It bites again at the paladin, still its nearest adversary, not even caring about its nearby masters.

Kyshtym swings at the kobold slinger intending to hinder it's ability to toss stones only to lop it's head off.

Lira, having found a nice spot to work with, gets back to picking off the beasts in the room, wiping out what's left of the beetle.

The slinger makes a last desperate attempt on Morocco's life, but the big warrior interposes his shield with a grunt. Behind him, Rioja steps around the barrier. With a brief chant, the wizard brings about a new cloud of sparkling force daggers, ending the kobold's life.

A quick search of the kobolds turns up nothing more than their now-useless and inferior weaponry. The only thing of note is a sack in the corner, filled with a greyish crystalline sand.

Kyshtym says, "Well done all, that went better than our last few skirmishes."

Rioja studies the sand carefully while the others recuperate. "A ritual material I've found, excavated by kobolds from underground. Used in ceremonies upon a pyre, it transforms the very nature of fire." He glances up at Morocco with a worried expression. "I'd bet a platter of meat and flagons that this dust was to be used by the wicked red dragons."

"You mean that's what those dragons are doing down there, occupying the dwarves' forges?" demands Morocco. "The kobolds must be bringin' it down to 'em."

Kyshtym says, "What use would dragons have for that? What manner of rituals would they be performing that is?"

Rioja shakes his head and shrugs. "The volcano burns and the forges are hot, perhaps some power all but dragons forgot. Thosh is a god, remember it well, but as to what ritual? I'm unable to tell."

Kyshtym ponders to himself.

"Let's check the far room, at least," Morocco suggests. "The kobolds were massin' for some sort of assault here."

Kyshtym nods, "We'd be be after your comrads."

Inside the room, several crates have been stacked, and tables upended, forming barricades similar to those found in the guards' chamber. The eastern room is quite clearly an armory. Weapon racks run along the southern wall, and once did so along the north, but the wood used to build them has been put to other purposes.

As the doors are opened, three dwarves emerge. They wear mail and carry stout maces, and all look bruised and battered. In their native tongue, they murmur briefly. "Morocco!" calls one. "You live yet. We'd given up on you. Thought you captured."

The warlord grins widely. "Rioja and I were rescued. Other adventurers came to our aid." He claps a hand on the paladin's armored spaulders and on Lira's shoulder. "Kyshtym and Lira, just come to the city."

Kyshtym says, "We aided them not long ago. Thankfully we got to them in time before they could be finished by kobolds."

Kyshtym shows his rune-coin.

Lira waves quietly and offers her coin as well.

One of the dwarves nods approvingly. "You'll find Starb and Vale further north, in the corridors." He gestures to his companions. "We're getting out to rest up, do some hunting. Our supplies are low. If you'll stay here for a time, we'll fetch more food."

Kyshtym says, "I could stand for a breather, what say you three?"

Rioja nods. "Our captivity was hateful, for a good rest I'd be grateful." Morocco nods as well. "Kysh, let's move some of these barricades over by the door just in case. Then we'll camp here."

Kyshtym nods and assists the warlord to prepare the room.

The kobolds' barricades are positioned to block the northern exit - just in case something comes through while the party rests. The crackling bonfire here is just the thing to warm the body, and everyone starts to feel the aches and pains of their battles now that the adrenaline is no longer flowing.
