The party confers amongst its members about how to proceed. There is a pantry door to the east, but it bears a dire warning of corruption upon it. And there is the locked door to the north, seemingly the only way to continue further into the god-city of Thosh.

As the group speaks, Kyshtym is the first to realize something. The dwarven defenders, as well as Morocco and Rioja, must have come from further inside. They must have passed that door previously. Therefore someone on this side must have the key - or someone on the other side must be awaiting the proper pass-codes or signs before they'll open it again.

Neither Rioja nor Morocco know anything about this; when asked, they both explain that the door was unlocked when they reached this part of the barracks.

Kyshtym says, "I wonder if Hemik might have it..."

The paladin heads back outside. Hemik is still there, but the others have long since gone. "I sent them to the care of one of our outer watchtowers," the priest explains. "But they told me - and a vision from Thosh has followed - that whatever was sealed in that pantry must be eliminated. The curse of undeath lives in there."

The priest shudders. "To let such foulness into our god's home and body is unthinkable. We'd rather shut out our fellows than risk such corruption working its way further in."

Kyshtym says, "Do you know what dwells inside?"

Hemik shakes his head. "They said four stout fellows had gone in there. Heard 'em screaming, so the others sealed off the doorway and scribed runes of warning on it."

Kyshtym says, "Do you know if the key to the locked door is inside?"

The priest frowns. "That door.. it leads further in, and beyond it is one of the ramps down to the halls of our ancestors. No dwarf will open that door until that taint of undeath is gone. If it is, knock at the door and tell the defenders on the far side how it was done. It's their sacred duty - they swore the blood oath - to let you through or turn you aside."

Kyshtym says, "I understand. I of course will do my best to nip this evil in the bud, my only concern is convincing the others to join me."

Kyshtym says, "Thank you for the information, farewell."

Kyshtym steps back into the darkness to join his compatriots and inform them of his discovery.

Neither Morocco nor Rioja object to the presence of the danger in the pantry. In fact, both seem eager to dispose of such things. Morocco explains: "Both of us fought in the Third Ark War, against the southern necromantic council. We've neither any love for the undead."

Kyshtym says, "Glad to hear it! Your experience will no doubt be a benefit."

Kyshtym says, "Is there anything you can recommend as far as tactics?"

The warlord shrugs. "The dead come in as many forms as the living do. It depends on the specific sort of opponent."

Kyshtym nods, "The dwarf Hemik mentioned 4 people went in and did not come out, but did not give details on them. I pray they have not risen again."

Morocco makes a suggestion as the party considers the pantry, after taking a short rest. "We had barricades before, right?" he asks. "We have all those wooden bunks in the barracks. Let's close off the southern corridor, then lure them in here. When they come in, we can trap 'em in the bunks, then light 'em. What do you think?"

Kyshtym says, "Sounds better than charging in blindly."

Kyshtym says, "Shall I grab the barricades while you prep the room then? I'd want to prevent them from reaching Hemik."

Morocco nods. "We'll work together. That door's held this long. We have some time, I think."

Rioja frowns. "While the rest should wait, one will act as bait. I'll lure them to you three, with my fey step they can't touch me."

Kyshtym says, "Alright then, no better time to get started preparing than now."

Lira chuckles, "If nothing else it makes me a little less nervous about deliberately opening up the room."

Kyshtym mentions to Rioja, "I'm guessing that you or Lira would be best as both of you are lightly armored, but do your best to avoid missiles on the way too."

Kyshtym nods in approval to Morocco.

After looking at the arrangement, Morocco comes to one other conclusion: extra material should be put near the door, so the undead don't have an opportunity to retreat. If possible, he thinks, the bunks could be collapsed entirely on whatever creatures come out and lit on fire.

Kyshtym says, "Good, we've got a proper plan now. Are you prepared Rio?"

The wizard nods, clambering his way slowly through the bunk-barrier. As Morocco seals it up, he lopes off down the hallway.

Kyshtym calls out, "God speed, may Bahamut defend you."

A few minutes pass. Finally Rioja rounds the corner at a run. "Plague-rats behind me! Opening the door set them free!" he shouts. With a burst of fey energy he rematerializes on the other side of the barrier.

A swarm of rats, led by a gigantic and evil-looking vermin, are right behind him. But what would be a barrier to a man-sized opponent is nothing to rats. They look ready to dart right through the gaps.

Lira, panicked by the unexpected swarms fires into the bunks with as much force as she can. Having the new weapon helps, as she loads the trap with electricity, frying the giant rat and zapping its friends.

Rioja fares no better. Still exhausted from his run, he's not able to aim his Thunderwave properly, and all it does is scorch and scar the dwarven bunks.

Kyshtym takes a swift step back while inhaling the foul stench of the swarm and looses it upon them with a frigid blast as they crawl in.

The rat swarms dart through the barricade's gaps, converging on three targets: Rioja, Kyshtym, and Morocco. Unfortunately only the paladin is caught - in the wake of his breath, he's not quite quick enough to avoid nipping teeth.

Faced with a defensive action, the rats are unable to achieve much against Morocco - but neither is he in turn able to do much to them, A few manage to grab hold of his broadsword as he swings it wildly about, but that's at most a stalemate.

Lira tries to deliver a shocking blow to the scurrying rats, but does little more than deliver an annoying zap to a few of them.

Rioja's own thunder is far more effective - the entire verminous swarm is bodily thrown backwards through the barricade, squealing in pain as they are shocked to death.

Kyshtym, furious at being nibbled by the filthy vermin, sweeps his sword into a patch of them and skewering more than a few on his blade.

With a loud yell, Morocco manages to slice through several of the rats - the largest and least bloodied part of the swarm, that which Kyshtym is also fighting.

Lira shoots, missing one group but landing the other bolt soundly. The powerful strike reverberates as the electric current fires through the vermin.

Rioja follows up with a devastating lightning attack that consumes most of the swarm.

All armor has joints, straps, weak spots. The rats seem intent on finding every one of those spots in Kyshtym's defenses. Seeing the paladin go down, Morocco shouts. "Get up, Kysh! They're just rats! Bahamut is watching!" Something about the fierce courage of the human, and not just the taunt, revitalizes the paladin, and he finds new strength despite the plague-infested bites he's received.

Kyshtym rises to his feet and swings at the mass in front of him, several sharp squeeks are heard before all movement stops.

Lira and Rioja together finish off the verminous rats that have so dangerously plagued the adventurers. And just in time, for coming into the trap now are animated skeletons - dwarven skeletons, bones picked quite clean of flesh (and one need not wonder by what), armed still with the weapons they had in life.

"Wait until they get inside!" cautions Morocco, taking up a position against the bunk he intends to use to close off the trap.

Kyshtym pushes, but almost manages to fall forward with the bunks he's pressing against. Lira, Morocco and Rioja all fare better - the latter two exert just enough force to topple the carefully-constructed trap in on the skeletons inside it. "Light it, Lira!" yells Morocco. And indeed there are a pair of torches that have been set aside for this purpose.

Lira jumps, grabbing the torches and lighting the bunks, "Gladly."

The wood, already scored by repeated lightning blasts, doesn't take much to burn. And the undead, being mindless creatures of necromancy, simply stand there and burn as the remnants of the bunks topple onto them and crush their bones.

Just outside the trap, however, there is a fifth skeleton. And as the plague rats burn with their former victims, a greenish miasma rises from their corpses. It swirls hatefully about, animatedly dancing about amidst the flames, and settles bodily around that final walking corpse. A voice emanates from it, though its mouth does not move: "Well done, gnats. A little victory in the great war. A war which I will win."

The voice is cold, and horrid, and corrupt. And although the skeleton cannot grin, its bone-white leer is so suggestive of one that the adventurers cannot help but imagine it.

Kyshtym says, "Don't count your chickens before they've hatched, whoever you are. Consider this victory the first of many."

"You speak lightly of one even your god Bahamut fears to name," the voice continues. "Thosh will be mine."

_Not today._ This voice is new, but seems to emanate from the very stone. And as it speaks, the skeleton collapses into a pile, and becomes silent.

Lira spits and huffs, "A lot of talk. We're only just getting started."

_You have come,_ this new voice continues, and Lira and Kyshtym now find it recognizable. This is the voice of their dreams, the voice which beckoned them to this place. The voice of the god Thosh, in whose body they now travel.

Kyshtym says, "Great Thosh I presume? I am only doing what any of the line of Bahamut would do when evil shows its face. Rest assured we shall do all we can to end the blight infesting you."

_Then go with power._ And the four adventurers feel themselves wholly refreshed. Not just that - strengthened. New power, new dedication, new understanding flows through them. Wounds close.

_Tell the dwarven guardians to unseal the door,_ Thosh decrees. _Tell them this._ And the voice speaks a tongue-twisting word that even Lira has difficulty following completely. Still, it's memorable enough, and can be recited.

With the undead dealt with, the party clears out the barricades. Once again the locked northern door confronts them. But now they feel ready to face whatever lies beyond.
