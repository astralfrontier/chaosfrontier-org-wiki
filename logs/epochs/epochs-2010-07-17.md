# Epochs 2010-07-17

Kyshtym wakes to greet the dismally dark morning in the underground city. After a brief breakfast he looks for his comrads in the South Stone commons.

Morocco can be found playing a peculiar game involving bone-carved dice, apparently gambling. Rioja is watching him in evident bemusement. He waves, collects what meager winnings he's assembled, and joins Kyshtym.

Kyshtym says, "Good morning. Have you seen any sign of Lira? I thought now would be a good time to check the flues and air vents before we have to be back to escort the dwarves."

The warlord and wizard both shake their heads.

Lira, camped in a corner and staring in space, apparently daydreaming about something, catches sight of the group as they wander past. With a leap she jumps up, jogging until catches up alongside, "Are we headed somewhere?" she says cheerfully, "It's nice to get some rest but I'm itching to go exploring."

Kyshtym says, "I figured now would be a good time to see if we can improve the air down here. It's so stuffy that I can not get a decent lungful."

Kyshtym remarks, "'twould improve the morale here as well and maybe get the natives to lend us some better assistance."

The party is shown a map of this level of Thosh, and they start to appreciate the real size of the city-god when they are told that there's seventeen more levels just like this one - and some even larger. All of it buried in the solid rock of the earth, much of it found under inconceivable depths.

Though they aren't shown on the map, there are a number of ventilation tubes leading to the surface, and the dwarven guards are happy to point out the main shafts. They are wide enough so that artisans can enter and repair them if necessary, and they tap the flow of the underground rivers nearby to spin some sort of device which keeps the air flowing even without wind.

The nearest such one is to the west, and it is this one which is of most interest to South Stone's people.

---

The foursome travel along a previously unexplored avenue which zigs and zags its way toward the rest of the city, away from the trading post. Twenty minutes pass before they intersect with another major street. According to the guards' directions, access to the shaft is available through a building to the north.

Kyshtym says, "Remarkable... I never imagined Thosh was so large. Simply walking the path to get here didn't even show a fraction of the area on this level alone. The dwarves certainly have made quite an accomplishment."

Near the door of the ventilation entrance, Lira catches sight of something sitting shadowed in one corner. It's a half a loaf of bread, gnawed at roughly. What's relevant is that it's not gone bad yet - whoever ate and discarded it did so recently. And given the frugality observed at South Stone, it was probably not one of their people.

Kyshtym recalls a tale of lost children finding their way home by following a trail of breadcrumbs.

Kyshtym says, "If we use the bread, there's a chance our trail will be blown away once the air flows again. I don't suppose anyone has a ball of twine instead?"

Lira says, "I don't know that I want to leave a trail for whatever else might be crawling around in there. Does anyone have a bit of parchment? I'm sure we could start a simple map."

Rioja rifles through his pouch. "I purchased scroll-making supplies, we can use those to avoid surprise."

Kyshtym says, "Perfect! Good thinking Rioja. Well then, shal we get started?"

Lira nods, "I'm sure if we just keep our wits about us we'll be able to keep ourselves properly oriented."

Morocco nudges the wizard. "Come on, try it like I taught you," he says with an encouraging smile. Rioja pauses, nods, and speaks again. "I have everything - parchment, ink and quill. Make of that what you will.... " He scowls a moment. "I mean, you're.. free to use... them." Morocco beams proudly.

Kyshtym says, "I suggest we travel in the following order. I'll go first, followed by Rioja and Lira, then Morocco. That will put the melee on either end for defence on both sides wile allowing the two in the middle some safety mapping things out."

With light, and weapons at the ready, the group carefully cracks the door to the access building. It's the same as many other buildings the group has seen before - remnants of smashed furniture, with anything flammable or valuable having long since been looted. There's a large door in the back, leading to an iron ladder which ascends into darkness.

Kyshtym ascends the ladder first into the airshaft.

The ladder is a thirty-foot climb, and emerges in a circular chamber. To the west is a narrow arch carven into the rock, which leads to another room.

At the center of the cylinder is a gaping hole, leading down. A similar hole leads up into gloom. A much larger cylindrical gap is found in the square chamber. It, however, leads only down - one assumes to the deeper levels of Thosh.

The reasoning becomes clear to a couple members of the party - if one of these tunnels caves in or has something fall through it, the rest of the tunnel remains intact.

Kyshtym says, "I suppose we'd better start from the source. The air will be coming from above I should think."

Lira squints upward into the black hole above and grows tense, "Something is...not quite right up there."

"How about it, Rioja?" asks Morocco. The wizard shakes his head in reply. "My light spell would show us the stuff, but its meager range is not quite enough."

Lira pulls an arrow out, waves it around and grins, "Anyone have a light?"

In answer, Rioja incants a short spell. The arrowhead comes to life with arcane light.

Lira nods, "That'll do."

The arrow flies true, almost directly up. Its magical illumination sparkles for a moment like a star in the dark. In just a moment, though, Lira can make out what her eyes have been straining to see. It's a sort of windmill wheel or fan, oriented up and down inside the shaft. It looks for all the world like it's meant to be there - this must be the device the dwarves mentioned, which blows air downward from the surface world. It's struggling to turn itself. What's stopping it, and what's making the creaking noise, is a long rope ladder which extends down from above and has become wrapped around the shaft.

The fan must be at least 100 feet above the party's current position, and the ladder must lead still further up. But if it's dislodged, maybe that will restore ventilation.

The arrow reaches its apogee, pauses, falls again - a shooting star now. Rioja is ready. As the arrow plummets past on its way down the shaft, he quickly conjures a Mage Hand which snatches it from the air. As the Mage Hand presents the caught arrow to Lira, the wizard offers a gentlemanly flourish.

Lira chuckles and curtsies before taking the arrow.

Kyshtym says, "It looks like we'll have a job getting that rope loose, What i'd like to know is where it came from or where it leads to."

Lira says, "It seems someone has been using the shafts to navigate the place without being seen nosing around."

Kyshtym says, "I propose climbing up and having a look before we untangle the mess. What do you think?"

Morocco frowns. "We had bad enough luck with the last cliff face we tried scaling, remember? And we were going down."

Kyshtym says, "True, but how are we going to get it loose? Do you happen to have a fire spell Rioja?"

Lira says, "The distance up is the biggest issue, otherwise the arrow wouldn't have been necessary. We may have to find another way up."

Rioja shakes his head. But Morocco speaks again. "Wait a minute. It stands to reason that the dwarves could get people up there. So how did _they_ do it?"

Kyshtym says, "Good point. I suggest looking around the room. Since this is the main access to the tunnel there's got to be another door we missed."

Again it's Lira's sharp eyes that spot something useful first. The cylindrical chamber has a shaft which goes both up and down. Why down? The half-elf can make out slits in the ventilation shaft as it descends. Are there any above as well? She can't make them out. This must be where the air is acually piped outward into the city. But at the bottom, she can barely make out something. Rioja, noticing her attentiveness, again casts light on a small pebble and chucks it into the hole.

Morocco peers into the hole as he sees the light come on. The others look down as well. What they see is a sort of mine cart without wheels, a metal half-cage resting amid a pile of rubble. The group has enough rope that they could safely descend to it and return.

Lira sighs, "Well, I don't know what other option we might have. Who wants to head down first?"

Kyshtym says, "I'm no so good at climbing even without gear on as you know from our last trip down. I think one of you three ought to scout ahead."

Morocco gathers some rope. "Fine," he says with a smile. "I'll go. Lead with the head, they said. That's why I wear a helmet, I told em." He fastens it to the iron ladder the party took to get here, and tosses the other end of the rope into the pit.

Kyshtym peers down after him.

The warlord slides gingerly down the rope, taking care to hold fast and watching his speed at all times. When he gets to the bottom, he loops the end around his waist and braces himself against the wall. "Come down you lot!"

Kyshtym climbs down as best he can before the others. Taking extra care not to slip this time.

Lira and Rioja also descend. Once at the bottom, they can hear the same thing Morocco's evidently been trying to listen to - the sound of swiftly moving water, quite nearby. "Look here," the warlord says, pointing at a lever. "Rioja, what d'you make of it, eh?" The wizard inspects the lever for a moment himself. "The dwarves did say the river gave service, even if the method tends to unnerve us. I think this thing lifts and descends, so I'll work the lever, please mount up my friends." He gestures to the fenced-off metal platform at the center of the pit.

Lira groans and climbs in, "I feel a little uneasy about this."

With the others aboard, Rioja starts fiddling with the lever. The grinding of metal on metal is heard. The platform the three adventurers stands on lurches to life, and begins rising from the floor. "A metal support lifts you up top!" calls Rioja from below them, for only he can directly see the cause of it. "Just yell down when you want me to stop."

Kyshtym gets down on his hands and knees at the unsteady movement before pulling himself back up and peering upwards to give the signal.

Lira grabs the edge of the crate, grimacing, "What a contraption."

The device continues climbing. And climbing. Slowly enough. And in time the sunrods are enough to illuminate the spinning fan as it toils against the rope. But what is it doing here?
