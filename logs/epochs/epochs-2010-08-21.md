# Epochs 2010-08-21

The kobold chattel scurries forward, urged on by the shouts of their priest. One pokes at Lira with its spear, but the jostling from behind it isn't enough to score an injury.

Rioja calls out. "Retreat to hear, or we'll die I fear!" Outside his flaming sphere begins to move.

The ball of fire tumbles next to one of the kobolds, burning it horribly and sending it shrieking its way east - only to tumble into the pit of scrap with a final thud.

On orders from the wyrmpriest, the remaining drake rushes in to assault Kyshtym as well.

Chuckling evilly, the wyrmpriest gloats over the party's imminent destruction. Unfortunately his aim is not the equal of his ambition, for his attempts to conjure a globe of destructive energy backfire on him with a loud **bang**.

Lira scrambles backwards, missing as she tries to wipe out the kobold in front of her.

The assorted kobold minions do what they can, but the defenders - having been pushed back somewhat by the assault - are now rallying.

Kyshtym sees that Morocco is not in dire need of help and swings at the kobold Dragonshild, just puncturing its defenses before he steps back out of harms way.

The dragonshield steps forward, following his quarry. With the obscene cheers and support of his underlings, he knocks Kysh's weapon aside and delivers a painful thrust to the abdomen.

Rioja's flaming sphere cuts down two of the kobolds and scalds the drake as it moves. Slowly but surely the opposition is being whittled down.

Morocco's bluff succeeded. The warlord leaps to his feet, steps toward the kobold wyrmpriest, and hip-checks the surprised fiend into the pit of trash below. "That's how it's done!" he shouts with fierce pride.

Without the priest to bellow orders, the guard drake paws uselessly at Rioja's fiery sphere.

The wyrmpriest, on the other hand, can be heard from within the pit, cursing and trying slowly to ascend.

Lira feels more reassured with her team a little closer and she backs up another step- this time more carefully- dealing the final blow to the scraggly little spearman in front of her and grazing the dragonshield next to it.

Kyshtym, seeing the dragonshield bloodied by Lira's arrow, steps up to the dragonshield and bellows at the little kobold, "Surrender or die you worthless little pipsqueak!"

The dragonshield takes a look around, suddenly realizing that its allies have fallen. Behind it, emerging from the pit, the wyrmpriest's curses and mutterings are cut short by the point of Morocco's sword at its throat. The drake growls but stands ready, well-conditioned but having no orders.

Kyshtym raises his sword and shield, "_"_

_After a few moments of thought, the kobolds throw down their arms and kneel submissively._

_Kyshtym growls coldly, looking into the beady eyes of the prisoners, ""_

_"The sacred masters!" hisses the wyrmpriest in its own tongue. "It is commanded. We obey!"_

_Kyshtym says, ""_

_"That is our place," hisses the wyrmpriest. "It comes from faroff kingdoms, loyal to the sacred masters. Dragonborn like you! They make it!"_

_Kyshtym relays the information to his comrads, "Anything else you want to ask?"_

_Morocco has nothing, but Rioja asks a question. "What do they hope to gain, to go to all this trouble and pain?"_

_Kyshtym repeats the Eladrin's question to the kobolds in thier tongue._

_When asked this question, the wyrmpriest shrugs. "For the sacred masters to achieve godhood. It is their right."_

_Lira says, "Do they have any other routes?"_

_Kyshtym nods to Lira, and asks._

_The priest mutters. "If we don't return, they find another route," he is understood to say. "Don't know any other now, but we'll find one."_

_Lira says, "And what if they did return?"_

_Kyshtym says, "If I were to guess, these two are probably followers of Tiamat. They would tell of the route being closed and let their leaders choose a different route anyway. There's little chance of us bringing them to the light of Bahamut, and I would rather not have to drag them around with us. I wonder if the people in town might have a use for them though..."_

_Kyshtym says, ""_

_Lira says, "If you think there's anyone else that would be willing to pay for these little creeps then I suppose we can check, but as far as I'm concerned they've far outlived their usefulness already."_

_Kyshtym says, "It seems they choose death over salvation. I will deliver Bahamut's mercy upon them..."_

_Kyshtym steps behind the two kobolds and swiftly removes their heads from their shoulders with his sword. After cleaning the blood off and sheathing his blade he asks, Shall we head back to Southstone?_

_Kyshtym collects his belongings from the opposite room and starts the decent back to the city below, content with a breath of fresh air and some information to help the people of South stone._

_Lira follows suit, looking concerned as she thinks about the tasks that loom ahead._
