# Epochs 2010-09-04

The crew hauls sacks of the kobolds' dust, along with what's left from the kobolds, back to South Stone. The haul isn't too heavy to move, but the return trip is definitely slower than the original.

Once there, though, they are treated to a heroes' welcome. The merchants and soldiers have been breathing easier since the ventilation system was brought back into working shape, and one of the priests starts yelling as the party draws near the guarded gate. "Oi! Got any of that dust? We found what it's for!"

Kyshtym displays the sacks they carried from the ducts, "Will this do?

"Yah." Some of the dwarves begin clearing a space at the center of the main area. "Put 'er down here," directs the priest.

Kyshtym sets the load off his shoulder where indicated, "What have they been doing with it? As far as I know it's been serving to aid the ancient dragons in the lower reaches of Thosh.

The priest nods. "Our heirophant was in communion with Thosh. Apparently heard about you folks, in particular. Relayed something interesting. The dust will be ignited by the fires of our forges, make 'em too hot for anything but the dragons to use. They'll gain access to the holy magma of our god - his lifeblood."

Kyshtym says, "That is not good. I hope that we cut off the supply before it is too late to stop it. I might also say that what we did was only a temporary fix."

Kyshtym relays all that the kobolds told him earlier.

The priest rubs his hands together. "This is the best part," he explains. "There's an easy form of ritual to use the dust, and we learned it. We'll be setting better traps for the kobolds from now on, usin' their own dust. If they bring it back down the shaft, POW!" He claps his palms together.

Kyshtym grins broadly, "Outstanding!

Reiga, the merchant with the bag of everlasting provisions, comes forward. "I think you lot have earned it," he says proudly, extending the bag.

Lira snickers at the thought of unsuspecting kobolds getting what's coming to them.

Kyshtym accepts the bag, "Thank you. I am glad that we could be of some help so far.

The priests explain. To reach the catacombs, the group will follow a series of sewer tunnels beneath the metropolis proper. One of South Stone's scouts came back with word of massed goblins in the streets, so the previous route was considered too risky.

The party will sneak ahead, through the tunnels, marking the safe ones with a sigil on the wall at each intersection. The exit to the catacombs is to the northwest.

Finally, the tunnels themselves are trapped. There'll be dwarven runes indicating each trap in out-of-the-way places, so the group should go slow and keep a sharp lookout.

Kyshtym nods, "Lira here can read a bit of Dwarf, I'm sure we'll be fine.

Lira says, "Hopefully it's nothing too archaic. I suppose my usual approach of hanging around the back and waiting for the right opportunity to attack won't work so well here if I'm going to be keeping an eye out for anything unusual."

"A word on that," says Morocco gruffly, patting his ribs ruefully. "I've learned my lesson. This time, let the opponents come to _us_. You and Rioja should back up as necessary, but Kyshtym and I will hold the lines while you attack anything coming our way. Okay?"

Kyshtym says, "We'll all keep our eyes peeled. I don't want to brag but my eyes are pretty sharp."

Kyshtym responds to Morocco, "I won't deny that we got lucky then, but your ruse was well played.

Lira says, "It had me fooled. Things seemed pretty grim there for a moment."

Kyshtym says, "I'll take the lead, best to let the one with the most defense go first."

Kyshtym hikes up his sack and steps carefully into the tunnel entrance ahead of the others. Taking in as much as he can see to try and avoid the traps ahead.

Kyshtym looks in both directions, and decides to turn north.

Lira follows closely behind him, trying not to trace his steps so as touch anything unnecessarily and keeping an eye out for anything that may look out of place.

The sewer tunnels are clean and well-constructed. The dwarves, past masters of directing the flow of air and water through their underground construction, have created a system that's almost pleasant to travel through. Perhaps having this be the body of one of their patron gods has helped.

Kyshtym decides on a direct route first before taking branches and continues north.

Kyshtym makes a simple mark on the ground indicating the turn to the west, "Lets try west then.

As the dragonborn speaks, there's a sudden noise. Goblins! They must have been lying in wait for anyone who tried to sneak around their main force on the surface.

The warlord slides past Rioja and into the western branch. "Lira, Kysh, back up!" he calls. "We'll hold em here at the branch."

Squeaking voices from around the sewer tunnel's corner shout orders.

Lira and Rioja back up accordingly.

From around the corner, an armed goblin rushes confidently out - and right over the section of tunnel that's supposedly trapped. The goblins must have disarmed it before scouting into the northern tunnel.

Morocco nods. "Good job!" he calls as the goblin appears. "Hey, back another ten feet!"

At that moment, another goblin, this one with a nasty-looking hand crossbow, pops out and makes a very accurate shot at the dragonborn paladin. Fortunately Kyshtym sees it in time, and it does little more than strike stone.

Lira heeds Morocco's instructions and backs up another step, firing at anything in sight and squarely striking the closest goblin.

Kyshtym swings his blade in the goblins face half heartedly in order to distract it while moving back on Morocco's orders.

Rioja tries his hand at the crossbowman at the back, but is distracted by the suddenly-darting goblin warrior, who follows Kyshtym's retreat with his blade out and a sneer on his ugly mug.

The divine challenge stands; the goblin, clearly hoping to take a chunk out of Morocco, veers off at the last second to strike at Kyshtym.

Behind him, another goblin steps forward to chuck a javelin. To the challenge he certainly rose, but what he was aiming for nobody knows - it strikes the ceiling of the tunnel and falls to one side.

Morocco, now in position, tries his best to impale the goblin in melee with his broadsword, but without success.

The crafty crossbowman fires a covering shot as his warriors back up from the tactical trap at the junction, striking Rioja and drawing a rhyming curse from the eladrin.

Kyshtym steps forward for another blow, but the goblin is to wary after being struck by the rangers arrow, and sidesteps the sword.

Rioja has no better luck with his own magical attacks. "They're crazy with so few," he concludes, "They must be led, but by who?"

Cackling, the two goblin warriors retreat hurriedly back down the tunnel.

Morocco looks tensely at Kyshtym. "Chase 'em?" he asks quickly, though he himself makes no such move.

Meanwhile, the sharpshooter at the end takes another - very effective - shot at Kyshtym, and also retreats around the corner.

Kyshtym says, "They are either retreating because of their wounds or trying to lure us into an ambush, I say hold back for...Gah!"

Lira says, "Well it's not as if we can just leave them there."

"If we keep goin', they'll just backstab us," Morocco points out.

Lira says, "And our goal is to make the tunnels safe anyway, which we can't do if they're scurrying around."

Kyshtym says, "As I'd hate to admit it, we'd better follow them then, they may get reinforcements. Maybe, if we play the role in reverse, we can lure them back out and ambush them in another way?"
