# Fall of Eden 2005-10-01

2:30 AM. Houston's streets are as black as the sky. There's not a streetlight on for miles. The only light is that glaring from the front of a 2007 Kawasaki Ninja 250R. The air is permeated with sheets of rain, and the wind is finally starting to pick-up. The one who rides the bike is largely covered by a leather suit, her raven hair streaming in the wind behind her.

Behind her, and somehow coming on fast, are more lights as custom bikes close in. The sound of gunshots shatter the sounds of the building storm, ricocheting off the concrete ahead of the first biker. She tones them out, caring only that the side compartments of her bike are loaded with over 2 million in diamonds and almost as much in crack cocaine. Some loot walmart, but the one they refer to only as Jet prefers harder targets. As a bullet skims her left shoulder, it might seem that she'd have been wiser to just stick to the shopping malls of Houston's Galleria.

As she races down the Sam Houston, Jet waits until the very last moment, her bike leaning crazily as she suddenly swoops down an exit onto 1960. With a grunt she curls into the right lane, using the 180 turn lane to change her direction and carry her east, into the gaping mouth of the storm. The violence of her turn catches some of her pursuers by surprise, and one who tries to duplicate the stunt finds his skills sorely lacking as his turn plants him into one of the enormous concrete supports, his bike bursting into flames. Still, two of the bikers are able to keep up, and the others are already moving farther along the Sam Houston, ready to take away whatever options Jet might try to use.

Willowbrook Mall, Houston, TX

Jet races down FM 1960, noting the glow of her pursuer's lights in her mirror. She frowns thoughtfully, making a very dire choice. With a click she turns off her headlight and begins to veer off course, flying down Centerfield Boulevard towards the Willowbrook Mall. She purposely takes a curb to cut down the distance, flying over a median and then rocketing through the parking lot at more than 80 miles per hour towards an entrance.

Jet focuses her attention on the path ahead. Naturally the main entrances are all chained off, but there are still ways to get in. The regular display windows haven't been shut off, and its towards these that she aims, popping a wheelie and taking a curb to get some air. With held breath she ducks tight to her bike, letting the front wheel and the handlebars take the brunt of the impact, the shattered glass leaving a jagged hole in her wake.

The maneuver is not without a price, and a large cut mars the back of Jet, her leather turning slightly darker where blood seeps out. She has to curb her speed considerably, moving through the utter black of a store. She fortunately knows the layout of the place, managing to avoid most of the obstacles, though she finds one of the mannequins has been moved, and with a grunt is barely able to pull dodge away from it. She remembers to turn her headlight back on, but it seems that it was ruined in her stunt, and so she has only the feeble illumination of tired emergency lights to go by. Outside, the storm winds are starting to take hold, and the last of the two who were pursuing her comes to a stop near the shattered window, pausing to deliver GPS coordinates to the rest of the pursuers. She won't be getting out of the Willowbrook without a fight.

Inside the mall, Jet shows no interest in getting out. She's got to get _up_. She had planned for this little event, and so made sure to know of every security door in the mall. The first she finds will suffice. She regards it calmly, then with a grunt rams it in. She pauses to look down at her bike. Still, it was only a joyrider, so she won't get heart broken over losing it. She seizes the diamonds and the drugs, climbing up the stairs swiftly. She only hopes those idiots are focused on the exits. Fortunately the wide span of Houston also has scattered her pursuit, giving her a chance. Her target is obvious, and she reaches the roof just as the winds are beginning to get truly nasty, and the rain whips at her lick a lash as she moves over to the side, where a few days ago she left rope, a set of throwing knives, and two handguns.

Tucked underneath the butt of the handgun is a small note. Its message is simple: "$50". A request for a further bribe, from the security guard who normally would have reported such a find.

Jet sighs thoughtfully, and with the wind whipping around her, mutters softly, "Jesus, fucking Reg! Asking like that." She hardly has a problem with it, but now is just not the time for that shit! She peeks down from the top of the building. In the glare of lightning she sees one of her targets below, looking in windows. _Imbecile_ she thinks to herself. With the wind screaming she takes aim. He's such a slow moving target it's almost unfair. Jet slides glasses over her eyes, and she squeezes the trigger. She feels nothing as the wind swallows the noise of the gunshot. This is business. The rope is cast over the side and with a some difficulty she makes her way down the wall, dropping the last ten feet and moving forward to claim the ride of the downed man.

She leaves the light off, revving the engine as little as possible as she guides it towards 249, changing directions again. This time, Jet means to head south and catch on the Sam Houston feeder, where she might be harder to notice. She seems to have at least evaded the current pursuit, and they probably won't find a dark spec racing around in the middle of a hurricane. As she begins racing east, once again towards the storm, she mutters under her breath, "The fuckers better be there."

Jet has some ways to go, and eventually even she has to accept that full speed in the dark in a hurricane is absurd. The wind is pouring down along the Sam Houston like water down a canyon, and the rain makes turning on the headlight a pointless gesture. She can only make whatever headway she can, and pauses from time to time to figure out just where she is. She has someone to meet.

The people Jet needs to meet are not precisely the most religiously devout. Much like her, they are opportunists, taking what the world offers. Unlike her, their word means little, and they don't care who they cheat, steal from, or murder. They wait on the North Loop Freeway, in three black limos. Even in the insanity of a building hurricane three of them wait outside, their frames large, their expressions as bleak as the weather. When Jet shows up, they barely react at first, looking to each other. They come towards her as one, with guns held up and ready. There's no trust here. There's no honor.

It's not until the three get close up that two men step out of the limousines. Both Jet knows. One she just robbed. The other is a friend. He works as a security guard at the Willowbrook Mall. His name is Reginald Dickson, and Jet knows she's been betrayed.

The shock and pain of betrayal help cover the pain of the gunshot that spins her throws her to the ground. The man she just robbed-most simply call him Stone-nods to Reg. The man walks forward, pulling the goods away from Jet's grasp. "Sorry, babe. I got myself a better deal. I won't be working that dead job anymore," he shouts out, voice barely carrying over the wind. Even with her down, he makes his way back to Stone quickly, turning over the goods to his new employer.

Jet's growl isn't audible. Stone just nods to his thugs and two of them begin to head back to the other limousine while the other shrugs his shoulders, cracking them and taking a casual aim for her head, ready to pull the trigger. Jet's not ready to die, though...

Time seems to slow down. The wind picks up, blowing the clouds away. Overhead, a pale light shines. Jet hears the refrain of CCR playing. That old Southern song, "Bad Moon Rising". And she watches as someone steps lightly out of the limousine.

The limo's stereo says it all: "I see trouble on the way, I see earthquakes and lightning, I see bad times today..." The woman who rises gracefully smiles at the men around her. She's nobody Jet knows, and none of the others seem aware of her presence at all. Time crawls to a standstill, but the music plays on. She strides casually toward the biker, hips swaying to the music in an effortlessly seductive dance. And she kneels down, silver light reflecting in her eyes as she speaks. "Hey there, honey."

Jet's eyes settle on that woman, and with the pain racing through her mind, feels a clarity coming to her, as that light somehow pours through her every pore, driving every other thought from her mind. She meets those eyes and feels in her heart a mix of reverance and unchained desire, a lust for something that she isn't able to define. It doesn't matter. It is, and that is enough. Jet manages to speak only with difficulty, "Hey babe. Picked a hell of a night to step into my life."

"You're about to step out. Want more time?" the woman asks calmly. She doesn't seem like she's bullshitting. Her offer is genuine.

"I'd give anything for it," answers Jet. She looks back towards those Limousines. She hates someone there. She can't recall who. She just knows that the first thing she'll do if she's got another breath is kill every last person in them. She looks back to the woman, "I'll give anything."

"You will, honey, you will," the woman whispers, leaning forward. Her kiss is fierce, and passionate, and she pushes Jet down onto the pavement. There's pain, but that disappears, and the biker is so engulfed by sensation that she forgets to realize just when it is that the woman herself faded. Abruptly, time begins to speed up again.

Jet is on her feet so fast that the nobody seems to have time to react. A gun comes to her right hand, but it's not that which lays low the first man. He falls back with a gurgle, and a flash of lightning grants the two others their last vision, which is of Jet, her gun raised, her mouth dripping with blood from the torn-out throat of their companion, ending their lives with the blissful song of bullets.

Stone cries to the driver to speed away, sensing that something is very wrong. His orders fall on dead ears. Literally. An almost careless shot blows the driver's head off, and soon Jet is lazily coming to the locked door of the car. With a growl she drives her fist through it, grabbing Stone by the neck and lifting him out like a toy. She shakes him in the air, then brings him down, letting the betrayer see what his fate shall be as she bites out the throat of this man as well.

The last to die is Reg. He has a gun, but it does him little good. Terror makes for a rotten shot, and in moments he finds both of his arms broken and he lies twenty feet from the limo where Jet threw him. She walks slowly, a cat very much toying with her prey. She licks her lips as she comes closer, tasting the heart's blood of her first two victims on them still. Reginald's shrieks only come to an end when she's made him the third.

When the storm has finally passed, leaving a city utterly trashed from its winds, a few maimed bodies are to be expected. Still, why anyone would be out in a hurricane like this is going to be a matter of speculation for many reporters who cover the story of the curious death of one of the south's most notorious men. To Jet, that is no mystery at all, but the Lady in Silver remains evasive to her, that momentary meeting leaving a longing in her heart that never fades, only growing stronger in time. Someday she knows she will meet her again. Her bride, her sister, her goddess.

---

Jet's life never quite gets back to normal. The old ways seem too well-travelled, the gray and steel of the city losing its luster. She takes for the north. She has no idea where she wishes to go, but she must get away. She trusts her instincts entirely, confident that when she gets where she is going, she'll know enough to stop there.

Ardmore, OK

North on 35, heading for Oklahoma City and ten miles south of Ardmore, Jet spies an odd thing. A sign, crudely nailed to a post and driven into the soil just off the asphalt. It reads: JET PLZ STOP 1 MI.

Jet's seen a lot of weird stuff in her life. Still, somehow this is up there. Who the hell knew she'd be here? Who the hell wants to talk to her? She frowns thoughtfully, but she figures she might as well check it out. Besides, ever since she met the Lady in Silver she's found herself far more capable. She was hardly a slouch before, but lately she's felt stronger, more confident, and so focused. Even in her wandering she had no doubts. And pulling to a stop down the road, she is sure that no matter what she might find, she'll be more than ready to handle it.

A mile up the road, a pair of lawn-chairs are set out on the shoulder. Occupying them are a copper-skinned man with dark hair, who looks Native, and a whiter, brown-haired man. The Native is dressed in what might be called "traditional garb", but it looks far too much like practical outdoor-survival wear to be ceremonial. The other is dressed in a dark, double-breasted business suit and tie. Both rise as the motorcycle churns to a stop, and the suit checks his watch. "Told you," he asides to his companion quietly. "You're Jet." This isn't a question.

"You look absurd," answers Jet. She kicks down the bike's stand and slips off her ride. "But I imagine you want me for something." She doesn't waste time, wanting to get right to the point. She looks between the two, already sizing them up, trying to determine which would be the greatest threat.

"You need tattoos," the Native says, wheezing a tad. He doesn't look old, just wrinkled from too much sun, and he doesn't sound so much out of breath as exhausted by life itself. The suit nods. "We've got a van parked off the road. Wheel your bike off and we'll get started."

Jet does as they say, though she's not sure about these tattoos. "So what the heck is the deal with you two, anyway?" she demands gruffly. "As much as I dig the ink, I'm not sure if your work is up to par." She crosses her arms, making it clear that unless they spill a bit, she's not going to going to set foot in anybody's van.

"Get in the fucking van," says the suit curtly. He pushes through some trees, revealing a beat-up Chevy parked in a clearing. "We've got rounds to make, and I've already prepared all the relevant materials." Arriving at the back doors of the vehicle, he opens them and snaps open a briefcase waiting inside. He pulls this out and begins rifling through it while the Native climbs carefully into the back, making the vehicle bob slightly. The man turns, beckoning, and Jet can see on his forearm that there are intricate, beautiful tattooed swirls and patterns, mystical and flower-like.

"Woah," says Jet, looking at the arm of the native. "Like that?" she asks, barely even realizing that she's already up in the van. "Man, you did that work?" she asks of the tattooed man. She obviously thinks little chance of the suit doing anything like that. "Rounds? What the hell are you guys, door-to-door tattoo artists?"

"We're Exaltation professionals," the suit replies, coming up with a catch from his briefcase and snapping it shut. "Lose the leather. This is a full-body job." The Native smiles a little, more sympathetic to Jet's case, it seems. "Another one of Luna's Chosen," he hums to her. "The Great Spirit came to you like she came to me, and my fellow. We tattoo each other, find our calling. Now your turn."

Jet arches an eyebrow. "Luna? You mean the Lady in Silver?" She spares a moment to glare at the suit, but she doesn't waste time arguing the point. She loses her riding gear and what lies under it in short order. "What's he talking about, anyway, Exaltation professionals?" she asks of the native.

"He works. I talk." The suit's words are clipped, with almost military precision to them. The Native is already preparing some tools from the van's well-stocked equipment, stored away in steel toolboxes and plastic tackle-boxes and other things. The suit produces what he drew out of his briefcase and lays it on the bed of the van, near where Jet now sits. It's a manila folder full of papers, and apparently a few photographs - a dossier of sorts. "You'll have time to look at that later. For now, let me summarize the really important parts."

"You've been recruited into a war. It's a war for your life, for your existence, for your humanity, and you said 'yes' the minute you kept on living. The woman, or man, or whatever it was that visited you? They offered you a choice, yes? And you accepted it. You're in too far to say no now."

"To fight that war, you've been given tools. The first and biggest is called the Exaltation. A big god, or voodoo loa, or spirit, the moon-goddess, call it what you will, endowed you with some of her power. You fight faster, harder, and better than anyone else alive. You'll gain control over the power of magic, and we'll help you understand it. But first you got a mission."

Jet nods, "Why would I want to say no now?" she asks flatly. "And it was a woman, not that it's any of your damn business." She frowns deeply, considering this fast-talker carefully. "What mission, anyway?" She looks over to the native, then, watching what he's doing with interest, but keeping her attention no less focused on whatever the suit is going to tell her.

The man in the van with her has begun his work, inking and tattooing. It hurts, but the pain feels odd, not like Jet expected or is accustomed to. "You've got some animal important to you. It's calling you. You need to kill it and drink its blood. This is your _totem animal_, and your link to it will be the foundation of all your magic."

"My totem animal, huh?" mutters Jet. She looks back to the suit, seemingly untroubled by the pain of the tattooing. "An animal is calling me, huh? Is that why I'm heading north?" She considers a moment, wondering just what it might be. "I think I might know what you are talking about."

"You'll be able to take its form. You can take other forms - any animal whose blood you consume is an animal whose shape you can become. Just will it, and it will be so," the suit adds. "Except for people."

"Except for people," deadpans Jet. "That's a shame. I had such a good start with those." Her laugh is one of amusement, despite these very strange circumstances. "So that's the big thing? I go kill some animal and I'm ready for.. what?"

"That's in the dossier," the suit says, cutting off any further questioning about that with his tone. "Your first priority right now is to get to your totem. The file talks about how to meet up after that."

"Who the hell are you?" asks Jet again. "And why are these tattoos so special?" She looks to the native then, trying to meet his eyes. "This doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense to me." Still, she thinks of what the suit says and quickly demands, "Will I be meeting up with the Lady in Silver? With Luna?"

"She meets with you," the Native says. "My name is Roger Wolf Pads. Lakota, half-breed. My totem is Wolf." And he smiles, the way an older brother might. "The tattoos give us shape. They keep us from changing. Look up." And he points skyward, and though it is day, the moon can be barely glimpsed in the blue sky. "The moon, you see it? Sometimes full, sometimes hidden, ever-changing. That is how you would be, if we did not fix you in place."

"What will my place be?" asks Jet softly. She pauses for a moment, adding seriously, "My name is Jet. Half-Japanese bastard. My totem.." She nods, "I don't know, Brother." She watches the work of the Lakota closely now, wondering how the ink can possibly achieve what the wolf says it will.

"You'll find out," he says, reassuringly, and keeps working. The suit, his name still unspoken, remains silent.

In time, the work is finished. The man in the suit has checked his watch no less than a dozen times. "Clock's ticking, Rog," he says at last, and the Lakota nods. "It is done. She is a Full Moon now," he says.

Jet studies the tattoos closely, shameless and unembarassed by her nudity. She frowns at the suit, "What's your name, anyway? And what's your rush? I have a lot of questions for you, and I need real answers."

"Too bad," he says, gesturing with a thumb for Jet to dismount. "If you really want answers you'll ride convoy with us, but I'd rather you just read the file I spent three fucking hours preparing for you, alright?" He moves for the cab and opens the door, but before slipping up into the driver's seat he turns. "Anything else?"

Jet takes the file-and her clothes-and gets out of the van. She's busy getting herself dressed immediately, answering, "I guess that's it." She turns to the Lakota, nodding to him, "I'll catch you around, brother. And when I do, I'll be able to tell you who I really am."

The Native smiles, and grabs hold of the back doors, closing them once Jet is clear. The suit mounts up, and the Chevy roars to life. He revs the engine. The big van lumbers to turn around, Roger opens the doors again to retrieve the lawn-chairs, and the pair are off, northbound on 35.

---

Jet has little exact guidance on this. She curbs her travel, thinking if she's seeking a totem animal, she would be better suited figuring out which it is. There are lots of places with animals. She winds up biking across the Rockies, then curling down south. The San Diego zoo seems a great place to see a bunch of animals, though she finds zoos to be loathsome in general.

On Thursday, August 30, Jet walks into the San Diego zoo. She looks as far out of place as one could possibly be, wearing black leather and a pair of silver shades. Her hands are covered with black gloves as well, and though it's over ninety degrees, she's not even feeling uncomfortable. "Enjoy your time at the zoo!" the ticket lady says, though the usual, forced-cheer in her voice wavers a bit as Jet regards her. The Full Moon grunts and takes her ticket, stuffing it in a pocket and moving on in.

>  [![](/images/s-zoo.jpg)](/images/l-zoo.jpg)   
San Diego Zoo, San Diego, CA

Jet wanders the place with frown. She stares at snakes, at apes, and then heads to see the bears. Elephants don't enter her thinking much, but she figures she better cover her bases. Even the lions don't work for her. She stuns a woman leading her children through the zoo but muttering, "Man, what a bunch of shit," when she finds that Tiger River is shut for the day. The biker folds her arms over her chest, turning away at first, but she feels something. Something so strong it convinces her immediately that she's found the right thing at last. Still, it's hardly useful since she can't even find the right way to get to them. Not to mention it's hard to kill a tiger in a zoo packed with security.

Jet walks away from the sign, wanting to think a moment. She taps her chin, looking around slowly to see what other options might exist. Just as she's starting to come up with a good scheme, there's a noise, and a few people are rushing past her. It's irritating, but she decides to see just what the hell is going on.

She can hardly believe her eyes when she sees a full grown siberian tiger racing right towards her. Jet isn't one to look a gift horse in the mouth, though. She reaches up, pulling her glasses off. She then folds them and tucks them into a pocket, moving forward and putting herself between the same woman she offended before and a very large, angry tiger. The animal slows its path, though, sensing in Jet some signs of resistance, and when the Full Moon raises her hands, drawing them into fists with an audible crack, its jaw opens and it lets out a terrible roar.

The woman and her children cower behind Jet, and the Full Moon strides forward. She wonders why she didn't bring a gun for this, but the question is swiftly discounted. This is a battle of glory, and a matter of honor. It must be fought fairly. She raises a hand to the beast, the fist opening and then beckoning with a simple gesture. It begins.

The Full Moon hasn't the claws of the tiger, nor its strength, but she has superhuman speed, and she is Chosen of Luna, and it puts her on no worse than even footing, even against this massive creature. She answers the first lunging of the tiger by throwing herself back, her spine bending so that her feet and hands both touch the ground before she flips back, lifting both legs at once, driving her steel toes into the chin of the tiger and sending it reeling back from her.

Jet wades into combat swiftly, not letting her advantage pass her by. Her fists strike like hammers, and the great tiger leaps back, then forward again, its swinging paw raking over the forearm of the Lunar and rending her flesh. Still, it is not enough to stop the Full Moon, and she raises her other arm, drawing it down to slam her elbow into the skull of the tiger, forcing it to stumble back.

The tiger is stunned, but hardly very hurt. The blows of a fledgling Lunar are clearly not enough on their own to overcome it so swiftly. With a roar the siberian tiger leaps forward again, this time catching Jet square and driving her to the ground. The Full Moon grabs for the jaws of the tiger, prying them apart and making the beast draw back when it finds her grip unbreakble. Sensing her opportunity, Jet slams first her left knee then her right into the belly of the beast. The tiger yanks itself free and rushes away from Jet, turning back and gathering itself for one last clash. The Full Moon kicks herself smoothly to her feet, shaking her bleeding arm and then clenching it tightly. As one, Full Moon and tiger charge at each other.

Jet leaps at the tiger, and the tiger takes to the sky as well, the two slamming into each other in mid-air. The first clash settles the beast squarely on Jet, but it simply stops moving for a moment, and then, after several long seconds, it collapses on its side, its throat torn from it and Jet's face and neck coated with its blood.

Jet lies there for a moment, stunned and still trying to recover. She can tell she's still rather seriously hurt, but she'll live. She finds several security guards are flocking about her. They look at the tiger, but even so pull her away before starting to examine her wounds. She feels a little dizzy, and Jet finds herself slipping in and out of conciousness. Bits of words and sentences reach her. "Crazy.... hero of some sort?" ".. would have torn a person in half!" "A lot of blood, but most of it isn't hers." "Is she going to be okay?"

Las Vegas, NV

Jet finally snaps out of it and pushes herself to her feet. She can sense that there's trouble if she stays. "I'm fine," she says flatly. "You people should keep your shit together. Someone could have gotten killed!" She levels a glare on security, her fists tightening. "Now get out of my way. I think I've had my fill of your zoo." Her eyes are like ice, and the same stare that cowed so many before works once more, its power greatly enhanced by the display she just made. She is gonna get the hell out of her, and fast. She imagines there will be a lot of questions about this, and she'd rather not answer any of them.

When Jet next stops to think, she's in Vegas, pulling off I15 and heading for the Stratosphere. She needs to clear her head, and she needs time to read that file again. She's got some thinking to do, and a place like Vegas should make it easy for even the most eccentric biker to not stick out very much.
