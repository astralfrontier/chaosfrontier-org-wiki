# Fall of Eden 2005-10-16

Interior. Helicopter. A lone helicopter carrying four people speeds over Hong Kong. Inside it three of the four are busy fighting one another, while the fourth pilots. Punches, kicks, knees, and other maneuvers are tossed about in the cargo area of the helicopter. It is a spectacular display of martial arts, more showy than anything else. Then the door of the helicopter slides open and there is a shout. "CUT!"

There's a brief pause, and then the set bursts with activity. The actors and the stuntmen are given a brief respite from their duties while coordinators and cameramen set up things for the next sequence. It's going to be a difficult shot, to be certain. But then it is the crowning glory of the film. The helicopter is attached now to a crane and suspended over a cluster of warehouses that have been rigged up for this very occasion. Once this is done wires are attached to harnesses and harnesses are attached to suntmen. Lao Xin is one of these men. There are a few last-minute checks and rehearsals of the sequence. He's to be fighting in mid-air, after all, and it's no easy task. He climbs aboard the helicopter, taking his position when at long last preparations are complete. With a voice amplified by a megaphone, the director shouts, "ACTION!"

A camera mounted on another crane swings around. On a monitor stationed far below the suspended 'copter, the director watches as his masterpiece unfolds. The door of the helicopter slides open again, and wires reel back, dragging one of the stuntmen out of the door of the helicopter, sending him falling away and out of focus of the camera. He is lowered gently. Xin and the remaining actor scramble out of the helicopter, catching hold of the runner with an almost painful sounding metallic thud. They manage to gain balance on that narrow beam, eyes locked with one another. They have spared little expense in setting up the stunts and in making sure the stuntmen look good on the wires. The one facing him is good. Lao Xin is better. He takes to the wires as though it were second nature, balancing without showing the need for the support of the harness. He half-smirks as he delivers the dialogue, marking the place so the sound guys can dub in vocals later. Then, he advances on the other stuntman.

There is a dazzling display of cinematic combat. Wires spin and twist as the two stuntman go through their rehearsed routine. One flips into the helicopter, only to be knocked back out by a swift kick, and the fight seems to come to a standstill. The director claps. They do it again. This time from a different angle. And again. The stuntmen rest between takes in the helicopter's cargo bay, drinking water, going through the next part of the routine. "I don't know. It seems dangerous." "Right," says Xin, "But that's why we're here. Look... so much is faked these days. Digital this and that. Nobody's ever heard my voice or noticed my face on screen, not in a while... but look, I get to make what the big hero does real. It's us who give them their moments of glory. Who give the people who will come to see this their hope, their enjoyment."

"We help make the impossible seem possible. And that's why this..." here, Xin mutters an impolite and complicated phrase, "...director needs us. We're expendable, he says, we can be replaced, and this is true, but without us... well, there's no heroics. No big fights, no nothing." Xin laughs, dryly, and steps back onto the runner of the helicopter. He and his friend are hooked into a crane, for this next sequence will take place almost entirely in mid-air. Explosives have been set up around the warehouses preparing for the big impact. The director calls for action, and Xin takes to the air.

Multiple cameras have been set up for this shot. So every moment is captured and immortalized as the aerial fight ensues. Throughout his career, Xin's found himself suspended in mid-air, the world beneath him, the heavens above him... _I am the bridge between man and the heavens_ he's quipped on one occasion. He's learned the tricks of flying on wires. Of making it seem as though his weight's shifted elsewhere, of seeming to actually be flying. The way his body moves when he punches, when he flips off of his foe, is almost poetic. Then, he draws guns and opens fire. Spent cartridges tumble to the ground as the blanks echo across the surroundings. There's an additional snap then. A rather sickening snap. One of the wires on the crane with the helicopter has come lose, and the others cannot support it...

There's a groan of metal scraping against metal. The blades of the helicopter grind and twist as the wind picks up. _Ohgodohgodohgod_ or the equivalent thereof, runs through Xin's mind. He sees them running about beneath him, trying to bring things under control. Chaos unfurls. He can see it. _There's nothing anyone can do about that now. Maybe get out from under it... and... oh no..._ There is a sinking feeling as a proverbial dead weight drops into the pit of his stomach. At the angle the helicopter's in, he can see already how it might come crashing into him and his friend. He screams as loud as he can, "Get us out of here! Move the cranes! The helicopter's gonna hit us!"

Xin's mind lingers on things left to be done, on his life up to this point. _I'm not going to die here. I can't..._ there's an almost hopeless desperation to his thoughts now. Panic is overridden, though, and he tries to swing his body in the harness. _Maybe... maybe if I can get myself moving, maybe I can swing at him and push us out of the helicopter's path... I can't just do nothing... I can't die here. Not now. Please. I don't want to die._

The falling stops. The motion stops. The world, in fact, stops. This fact takes a few moments - or what are moments if nothing is moving? - to register. Breath still enters Xin's lungs. His eyes blink. But everything else has been reduced to complete stillness.

Motion is impossible, except to glance about with his eyes. He cannot move his limbs. But he can hear, when a voice calls up to him. "Ho there!"

Xin watches. He is stunned for a second. Unable to move he tries to glance downward, tries to call out to the voice, "I... I can't move. I... hello?"

A man's face comes into view. It is neither Oriental nor Occidental in its features, but perhaps a strange blend of both. The man's hair is black, and his goatee surrounds a mouth quirked in a smile of amusement. But his eyes are not smiling. They are deadly serious indeed. His voice shares in that same quality, and the man speaks again. "Lao Xin. Inheritor of four thousand years of cultural tradition. Actor, fighter, would-be hero. You are about to die. How does it make you feel?"

Xin answers. Even if he wished to ask questions, he finds he is unable to say anything except to answer the question. "Like... I don't know. Angry. Hurt. Afraid. There's still so much more to do. I've done my best up to now, and this is it? I die now because of some stupid screw-up. Good night, scene ends. No more hero, no more world, no more hope. Powerless. That's the word."

"I can give you power. Power enough to live now, to save those around you. Power enough to do much, much more." The man smiles grimly. "I have one condition, and only one. That you use that power, for as long as you do live. Nor do I promise that life will get easier. But I do promise this. All that you dream of will be within your grasp."

"You can?" Xin's mind works through this, racing, even though there is a sense of total serenity settling all around him. "Who are you? What..." He stops questioning, "Then... I shall accept this gift then... use this power to do whatever I can, for as long as I do live."

"I am the Unconquered Sun, patron god of heroes," the man says, voice booming. The light around Xin intensifies, though it does not hurt his eyes. "You were already cast in the mold of the hero you seek to be. Now you are given all that was missing - the strength that the role requires." The man's face is obliterated from sight as the light grows to unimaginable strength, and then Xin is left where he was - doomed. Time is again moving.

But it is moving immeasurably slow. Slow enough to plan, to think. And Xin discovers one more thing - he can feel everything and everyone around him like the scene were burned into his bones. He knows the exact tensile strength of the cabling, the exact mass and speed of the helicopter. He can compute trajectories, feel the exact angle of descent, know with certainty _what will happen_. It is not a vision of the future, but a perfect understanding of his every surrounding. His body, too, he understands to perfection. His muscles await his command, able and eager to contort him into exactly the places he wishes to be.

There is no doubt within his mind, nor was there from the first moment the voice called out "Ho there!" that what just happened was real. More real than anything he has experienced before. As the scene unfolds, Xin reacts instantly, body, mind, and now soul working in perfect union. He twists his body, sending the cable rippling up to the crane, and as it works back, he flows through the air. The snap of the helicopter as it breaks free is loud, though it does not surprise Xin. The helicopter snaps into his cable, severing it just as his body started to curve upwards, underneath it. Now he is truly flying.

The other cable, the one supporting the other stuntman rocks back and forth as Xin snags hold of it. A strong push sends the now passed-out man swinging out of the way of the helicopter as it tumbles past them. He reaches out, grabbing hold of the runner and swings. Every muscle in his body is taxed to the fullest, the cable tenses and the crane groans from the sheer exertion placed upon it. But Xin knows how much it can take. He knows how everything will flow, will shape, how it _must_ unfold. He kicks against it, hooking a foot on the runner as the helicopter's trajectory is changed, slight though it may be, away from the people beneath.

And Xin tumbles with it. He perches triumphantly on the underside of the helicopter, and runs. He runs and runs, his legs pushing off and twisting, contorting him into a rather complicated twist that sends him between the tail blades of the helicopter just as it begins the last of its spiral. It crunches, sinking into one of the warehouses and then a bright blossom of fire and metal unfurls behind Xin. The flash-bangs have been set off by the crash. He catches hold of the edge of another warehouse, and lays, panting. _I'm alive. More alive now than ever before._ And in the distance sirens of ambulances and fire trucks scream as they race towards what they were sure was certain disaster.

Later, when the sirens have subsided and the fires have been put out, Xin is called to answer for his crime. For surviving. For being a risk. The director screams, going on about how utterly stupid it was to have risked himself like this, and what was he thinking. Does he have any idea what kind of a liability this is, how much that equipment cost, how much those explosives were, what kind of hell there'll be to pay because of his stunt? Xin nods. "I understand." He's not afraid. No longer worried. "I did it because I could. Because someone had to do something, and I could. I'm done here. I know." And then there's the check up by the EMTs, the statement taken by the police. The report of the 'incident'.

_How do you like that. The most important moment in my life, and now, maybe it's nothing more than an 'incident' and some numbers on some accountants statement._ Xin is recovering now in a first-aid station. All that exertion must've been dangerous, they say, but they could find nothing wrong with him. He was healthy. Healthier than ever. All around him there's murmurs of disbelief from those who saw what happened, who saw more than money and effort going down the drain. Something incredible happened. And they know it. They should've died, but they did not. Against all odds, someone stood up, someone did something. Xin. Did something.

The stuntman, now recovering on a stretcher, wakes. He's covered in blankets, being treated for shock, and he regards the nearby Xin with eyes that are weary, but now at rest. "You... you saved me," he says. The words resonate with Xin. Something that throughout his life he'd been missing, but was never aware of until now, is no longer missing. He is filled with awe at what has happened. His very soul seems alive. The stuntman watches Xin, "You saved them. When we all were going to die. You did it. Thank you."

Two more people, people who by all rights should be dead, crushed beneath falling metal-now merely bruised and cut-approach as well. They know that their existence, their fates have been changed, and it is not an easy thing to realize. "That was good work," one says, as bandages are applied, and statements are taken. And as the crews work to clean up the wreckage, still more murmur things about how their lives have been touched. _A ripple in the pond_ Xin muses.

Hong Kong, Peoples' Republic of China

Over the next few days Xin finds himself back home. He lives in one of the myriad apartment buildings that can be found throughout the city. One of the poorer parts of the city. There's a restaurant below him, and his room smells strongly of noodles. There's a restlessness that has settled in on the first night back. His dreams are filled with the light of the Unconquered Sun, and when he wakes, "Use that power, for as long as you do live," echoes in his mind.

His neighbors have noticed his return. The 'big movie star' has been invited over for dinner by the couple who live across the hall. They've seen each and every last one of his films, they say, even though they never know much about it. Elsewhere in the building things are more peaceful. The old man who lives beneath him pounds not quite so noisily at Xin's floor, and the family above him doesn't seem to run around at all hours.

There's a desire to get out, get away from things. He needs to think, clear his head. He tried talking with his neighbors about what happened. He was met with disbelief. "You've been through a lot," they say. "Probably just stressed." Although not all discount his tale. "I've seen too many things in my day to discount things like this entirely. There's more to the world than it lets on." His body reacts as never before. What he wants to do, he can do. But he lacks direction, lacks focus. It's something he tries to find. By now word of what happened on set has spread. He finds that not too many want him as a stuntman, but that's just as well. With what he can do, with the way he's been changed, he doesn't think that it's what he's meant to do anymore.

Now's his chance to be the hero. To change the world. He tries. One night he sees someone being mugged and steps in to help. The fight is quick. Much quicker than it should be. Knife embedded in the wall, mugger slumped in the alleyway, and victim no longer a victim. Xin walks on. He continues to walk, finding no respite from the desire to see and do more. And as he walks, he leaves little ripples in the pond of life.

A passing stranger eating a bag full of 'Happy Dragon' dumplings convinces Xin that the same treat is just for him, both from the smell of the things and the look on his face. It's somewhere to go at least, and the man ducks under a curtain and into the establishment that makes them. It has been nearly a decade since the British ceded control of Hong Kong, but signs of that era remain: the Queen's portrait hangs on one wall, like a totemic invocation for protection against her police. The smiling proprietor waves with a cheery smile, and Xin takes a seat next to a man wearing a natty business suit, already eating.

"Hell of a thing you went through," the guy remarks. Xin can see a stack of paperwork bound into a manila folder resting on the counter in front of him, and the suit pushes it gently across the countertop toward him.

Xin looks up from the 'Happy Dragon' dumpling. It's the best thing he's eaten in a while, he decides, and looks curiously at the manilla folder. "Yeah... it was incredible. People say they can't believe it... but it's the most real, believable thing I think I've ever done. What's in here," he asks, as he takes a look at the contents of the folder.

"Your new job. The one you signed up for when you talked to.. the big guy." The man swallows, takes another bite. The Armani is spotless despite the somewhat greasy fare. "Good news. You're hired for life."

"You... whoa. You know about that? How..." Xin looks at the man with no small amount of surprise. News like this is best washed down with greasy food. The dumpling all but vanishes. "Hired for life. So... what you're a representative, then, of the big guy?"

"Nah. Employee of people he works with, if you want to think of it like that." A flawlessly manicured hand reaches for a Coke in cheap styrofoam, and he takes a long sip from the straw. "You guys are like the main actors. Principal cast. We're the production crew. Behind the scenes. We smooth shit out so you can do your jobs, you dig?"

"Yeah. I dig." Xin flips through the folder, reading over what's contained therein. "At least, I begin to. So... you gotta name? Mine's Lao Xin. Xin, to my friends. Which includes you now."

"Nice to meet you, Xin." Armani totally ignores the question about his name, instead gesturing at the folder. "This is all background stuff. There won't be a quiz, but since we're running low on time, I'd appreciate it if you would at least keep some of that stuff in mind. You'll get a real orientation after we round up a team. Until then just stay low, don't get flashy, and uh..ohyeah." The man turns, his eyes boring directly into Xin's, reflecting what must be the myriad street-lights of Hong Kong, for they cannot be stars. "Rent some really good action movies. Just think of it like an education."

Xin chuckles wryly. "Sure. I can think of one or two. Alright then. I'll see what I can do. I can stay low, keep from being flashy. I feel like I've got to get out and do stuff though." He takes a styrofoam full of soda, drinks. "Is there anything else I can do?" He speaks, but he's miles away, somewhere in the stars or street-lights reflected in the man's eyes.

"That's the problem, Xin," Armani remarks sullenly. "You can do anything you want now."

"Yeah. I know," replies Xin. "I guess that's where you guys come in. Make sure the script has a happy ending, kinda thing. I'm sure you know how to get in touch with me if you need me. When you get that team put together. You know, it's a kinda comforting thought... in a way it's nice to know I'm not the only one."

"You aren't," the man sighs. It isn't a tired sigh, or a frustrated sigh, but rather... the man taking the first step in his thousand-mile journey. "Be patient. We'll be in touch." He rises, throwing money on the counter, and steps out.

"Sure. See you around," calls Xin as the man steps out. He gathers up what's left of the dumplings and heads for home. _Well... this is it. No going back, but then, I don't think I'd want to, even if I could._ He looks up at the sky, stars blotted out by street-lights, and as he walks home, begins to laugh.
