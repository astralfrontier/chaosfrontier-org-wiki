# Fall of Eden 2005-11-23

"Dammit!" exclaims Andrew "Poe" Morgan, as he thumps his fist on the desk next to the keyboard. "I've got all the pieces, but they don't make a _story!_" A veritable snowstorm of scribbled notes surrounds him on all sides - the desk, the floor, anyplace flat enough to support a piece of paper. And it all needs to come together on the computer screen in front of him.

Morgan's usual beat at the _Seattle Times_ is white-collar crime, so the story he's working on - tracing the real funding sources behind the think-tank known as the Discovery Institute - isn't too far off the beaten track for him. The actual investigative journalism, in fact, was nearly a cake-walk - most of the major information was in the public domain, and it didn't take much digging to get the juicier tidbits just under the public facade. He's got all the information he needs to strip away the Institute's pose of intellectually honest discussion of science and public policy, and reveal its true roots in extremist right-wing politics.

But now he's faced with a different sort of problem altogether. When he's writing about the mob, or the usual corporate suspects, he's not had too much trouble keeping things _interesting_; corporate scandals affect the jobs and livelihoods of real people, and actual organized crime always sells papers. But in this case, the Discovery Institute's "intelligent design" propaganda is pretty rarefied, mostly targeted at swaying the intellectual elites and the faithful on the right. And for the life of him, although _he_ can so clearly see why it's important, he can't find a way to convey it to the ordinary voter.

Morgan sighs, and puts his fingers on the keyboard again. The only thing he's found that really removes a mental block is to start typing and see what happens. His fingers dance along the keyboard (and once again he's glad to have bought one of those Natural Keyboards - they've really helped with the wrist strain), and the black letters slowly fill the page of the Word document. And it does help - he can feel the ideas slowly turning in his mind - but he still can't hear the 'Voice of the People' - as he's called his inspiration at times; his fellow reporters laugh at him, but when Morgan's really in the groove, it's almost as if he can _hear_ his readers, looking over the story and talking about what they've read. But right now, the Voice is silent; his readers haven't seen anything that catches their mind or their heart.

The hurricanes of the Gulf Coast have driven people northward. Among them is a drifter, an outcast, a criminal - and a god. And in Las Vegas, the Devil's Playground, she met a woman with chocolate skin and tightly-woven braids of hair. She appeared behind Jet's motel room door, standing patiently to receive the biker as she finished checking into the anonymous flop, and spoke of missions and objectives.

Jet has a lot to hear, and a lot to ask. Her's is the kind that doesn't much like waiting on anyone, especially those that claim to know things about her that she doesn't. A simple offer is made, some project awaits her attention up north and after that, answers can be given to more of her questions. More, but not all. There's no joy in accepting it, but any answers are better than none. Besides, Vegas isn't as fun as it used to be..

The woman introduces herself as Mary - a name she silently defies 'Jet' to extract more details about - and also introduces Jet to her somewhat road-worn Dodge Ram. It has a full complement of tools in the back, along with three wooden crates with tarpaulins stretched over them.

Their destination is Seattle. Their departure time is now.

---

Just off I-5, near where State Highway 524 cuts rudely through the residential areas of Lynnwood, the truck comes to a halt. "We're close by," Mary says, pulling a flashlight out and waving it over the Rand McNally map spread out on the passenger seat. "Jet, you ever been up this way?"

"Maybe," answers Jet. More than one can play the secret game. She can't help but smirk. Her problem with authority clearly extends to these strange people who pop into her life with a lot of answers they aren't willing to give her. "You looking for some place in particular, _Mary_?"

The woman takes a moment to glance at her watch. When she finally speaks, her words are distracted. "Not some place. Some person. The Path of Paradise led me here, to him. Almost to him. I think I've lost it though."

"So.. what exactly do you want me to do about that?" asks Jet blandly. She can't help but roll her eyes. "I doubt I've met this person." Not only are they unhelpful, they are genuinely batty. "You better not be trying to cheat me out of those answers, _Mary_," she half growls.

"Well, that makes both of us. Anyway, I'm...." Mary sits bolt upright, then slams on the accelerator. The Dodge's tires squeal protestingly as she maneuvers the pickup out of the side-street in which she parked. "Come on!" she yells out the window. "This is where we do our thing!"

Jet sighs softly and shakes her head. This had better be worth it. With a distinct purring the motorcycle races easily along with the dodge. The Full-Moon narrows her eyes slightly, wondering just how much trouble this 'thing' will land her in. She's rather looking forward to it, actually.

---

The general outlines of the story are there in front of Morgan now, but they still don't breathe - they don't _live_. He sits back in his chair and goes totally silent, as if straining to hear the Voice. And then he does hear something - but it's not a voice. He's not sure _what_ it is, in fact - just that in this quiet neighborhood, it probably shouldn't be there. Quietly, he steps away from the desk, carefully avoiding the paper stacks, and unlocks the gun safe, pulling out his .38 AMT Back-Up and slipping the little gun into his belt. After his last story on the mob, he isn't taking any chances - and though in his heart he knows that it won't help him all that much if it really _is_ the mob, he at least wants to make them think a little harder about going after the _next_ journalist. Thus bolstered, he creeps through the darkened house, straining to hear where the noise came from.

Morgan grits his teeth as he barks his shin on the dining room table - turning on the lights seems an unwise move if there really _is_ an intruder in his home, and now his leg is paying the price. For a moment, he feels a little foolish. _Who do you think you are, Dirty Harry? Have some sense and let them come to you!_ he thinks to himself. And yet, he slinks on, slippered feet padding softly on the thick carpet. He's had to act the tough guy too many times when talking to mob informants, and a little of that has leaked into his personality.

The situation becomes somewhat more disturbing when two sounds, on opposite sides of the house, become audible. Too dissimilar to be echoes, they hover on the edge of his awareness. One thing is certain, however. They are continuing.

Morgan freezes, turning his head this way and that. _Two of them! Shit..._ He might be able to deal with one, if he's lucky, but the shot will alert the other, and he can't count on luck twice. Still... into the breach. Picking one source of noise at random, he makes his way back toward the study.

Outside, something discernible - someone dashing across the gravel-strewn yard - can be clearly heard. There's a muffled cough.

Further away, the sound of two distant vehicles. It seems that whoever is here is being joined very shortly.

Morgan moves quicker now - if someone's in a hurry, he may have a better chance, and he wants to deal with whatever it is before the vehicles get here. He makes his way to the living room, crouching below the window, and then peering carefully over the sofa.

The next thing he knows, a shot is fired. His irises nearly snap shut from the sudden muzzle-flash, and his ears ring in the confines of the house.

---

Mary is driving the Dodge in a fashion charitably described as 'reckless'. The protesting tires squeal as she viciously applies the brakes and throws on the high-beams. As the truck wobbles to a halt, the headlights illuminate a typical suburban house. Behind the Lexus parked in the open carport, two figures can be seen to crouch. The driver's side window, still rolled down, is all Mary needs. Her lithe body slides up and out and she acrobatically slips into the truck bed. "Jet! Guns!" she shouts. "Stop anyone packing!"

The tarp to one of the crates is torn off, and the woman flings the lid across the street. Her hands dip into the box and withdraw with a pair of sleek chrome pistols.

The Lunar looks all business, but inside something just.. clicks. There's nothing but her, the enemies she must dispense with, and a warmth that builds faster and faster. Since her little change, her bike has had a few 'special' mods made. Mary may stop. Jet does not. She leaps smoothly atop her bike and shifts a hand down to grip a rod which she tugs, engaging the brake and letting her full momentum sending her soaring forward, her body twisting in mid-air, bringing her feet forward in a blurring kick at the very last second.

The impact is so hard it rocks the car, the man crumpling bonelessly to the ground. The second lifts his head just in time to have his neck seized by Jet. She lifts him from the ground smoothly and pivoting swiftly brings him about to slam his full body through the window of the car. Her aim isn't quite perfect, so that his head first meets the steel of the roof before it follows the rest of him into the backseat. She releases his limp form with a snort of disgust, staring at the house through narrowed eyes.

Within the house, the single shot was not accompanied. The two invisible assailants are stalking Morgan carefully. The first gunshot was a miss, or perhaps it was meant to drive the man into a state of fear. Whatever its reasoning, the journalist is now very mindful of silence.

Morgan freezes behind the couch for a moment, blinking the spots from his eyes. His first realization is that he's alive. His second realization is that someone's trying real hard to change that. He vaults over the loveseat, no longer worried about not making noise, just concerned with putting something between him and that flash of light. The idea of returning fire doesn't even occur to him yet - being shot at is a lot different than the firing range.

Now that their presences are revealed, the two men in the house have no compunction against being noisier. Hoots and hollers of derision echo through the living room and the hallway, as the two change position to confuse their quarry.

Outside, it seems that vandalism is the rule - Morgan can hear the sound of his car being broken into.

Something about that laughter makes Morgan angry. He leans out from behind the loveseat and fires two shots in the direction of the muzzle flash, before ducking back behind his cover. The sound of tinkling glass reminds him that he needs to conserve his shots... but what the hell.

Outside, Jet glares down at the men she's struck, a bit puzzled. The first adds up. His crumpled, white form clicking in her head. The second that is motionless in the vehicle seems to Filipino, however. She files that away, but for now, she imagines she has to go in. She looks back at Mary, wondering what else she'll be running into. Part of her imagines this will be yet another place she can never come to again. Part of her just hungers for the hunt to continue. "More of them inside?" she asks in a harsh voice.

In that moment, a pair of shots from inside answer the question.

Well, that's all the answer Jet usually gets. At least she has an idea of what she's doing. She looks to Mary, "Am I just supposed to take out everyone here or what?" she demands, a deeper growl coming from her. She is making her way closer to the house, keeping low, even if the curtains appear to all be shut. A little bit of extra caution can hardly hurt her. She's going to hopefully get an answer before she starts edging closer to the front door. She's not fool enough to dream it might actually be unlocked. She's not that lucky.

The woman has hopped down from the bed of the Ram, and is warily wielding a pair of Berettas. "We're here to protect the guy who lives here. Umm..." Her direction seems to waver a moment. "Nail anyone who looks hostile, alright?" She takes a few shots at the front door's deadbolt, and splintering wood and shrieking metal reply.

Inside, Morgan hears more gunfire, and the meager protection of his front door is gone in moments as the lock withers under a barrage of bullets.

_Why do they need to shoot my door down? They're already in here!_ Morgan's ears are ringing now, from all the shots fired. Since he no longer hopes to be able to hear which way his assailants went, and he's sure they know where he is anyway, he calls out a challenge. "Oh, so one of you's not enough? C'mon and get me, dammit!"

For a few seconds, that brazen challenge goes unanswered. Unless Jet utterly misses her guess, that is the guy she's supposed to help. But how to help him before he starts shooting at her? The answer she comes up with first is quite simple. It is not a woman that enters the front door. It's a diamond back rattler, moving fluidly over the floor. It pauses for a moment, tongue 'scenting' the air as it considers Morgan before turning away to move deeper into the house.

Morgan blinks in sheer astonishment, almost as if he had been a mouse fascinated by the snake before being consumed. Just as he recovers himself enough to aim his gun at the serpentine intruder, it slithers away. "Oh, now that's just fucked up!" he yells, apparently assuming the snake to be part of some kind of mind game, like a horse's head in the bed. He peeks his head over the edge of the loveseat for a moment, looking for a more human target, before ducking again. "What, do you think I'm afraid of snakes or something?"

The rattler is definitely going to inspire a deep dread of snakes. If only briefly. She moves almost silently, the motions of the snake swallowed up so well by the floor. Her path is about edges, along walls. The reptile flicks her tongue again, finding another man by the smell of his sweat. With the unblinking, merciless eyes of a serpent, Jet waits for the gunman's hand to raise his weapon, her body coiling. There is no rattling, just a sudden strike that turns her into a blur and buries venow-gouting fangs into his flesh, the gun falling as instead of a gunshot, a shriek of pain and surprise comes from the man.

Morgan can't help but laugh. "Hah! Maybe you should try getting your men out before you pull that stunt next time!" His voice is drunk on panic and adrenaline, but even in that state he can't help but be amused by the biter bit.

With him stumbling back, Jet strikes again, her aim higher this time, fangs no longer just disarming. This time they shatter flesh and glide effortlessly through his jugular, sending him staggering one step farther back, then collapsing as blood begins to pour from the wound and into the greedy maw of the serpent.

Morgan also spies an attractive black woman, wearing jeans and a billowy tank-top. She has come through the door in a moment of inattention, which is hardly surprising right now. She is incongruously armed with a pair of sleek Beretta pistols, which she raises - almost - to aim at him. "Drop it!" she shouts, in a commanding voice, eyes on his snub-nosed .38. "Drop it now!"

She has the gun pointed at him - his isn't pointed at her. And at least she doesn't want him dead right away, unlike the other person, or persons, who opened fire with no further prelude. The Back-Up falls to the floor, and the hands reach for the sky. "Fine, fine," Morgan growls, clearly displeased with the situation.

"Jet, report in!" the woman barks, turning her head without wavering her aim to look over one should into the house.

The 'report' is the sound of a rattle as Jet turns away from the first victim to hunt for the second, her tongue still scenting the air. She moves faster now. Eager. She is the hunter, but she's a very cautious one, as well, pausing to change once more as she senses her prey once more. Where there was a snake now is the form of her totem, a ghostly white siberian tiger on the prowl. Letting out a deep growl, she continues her hunt. She smells just one more in the air. Disappointing.

The last attack, when it comes, is fast, relatively painless, and utterly final. There's a shout of surprise, followed by the sound of something hitting the floor hard. There's not even very much blood. Jet returns to 'report' in one last time, the eyes of the tiger making it clear that her mission is as complete as it can possibly be. She doesn't change back, rather liking this form at the moment as she settles down, a soft growling coming from her as she looks at Mary closely.

"Pay attention," the woman barks again, directing herself at Morgan. "Listen very closely. We need to move outta here."

Morgan steps back - being attacked by gunmen was traumatic enough, but this... "What the **hell** is **THAT** doing in here?" he asks, wide-eyed, so bewildered by the enormous feline in his house that at first he doesn't even hear Mary's instructions..

The woman shoves her pistols into her belt, then grabs Morgan's shirt and hauls him up. "I said listen!" she practically shouts.

"Oh! Right, right. Move outta here. Right. Lead the way, lady." Morgan falls into step behind the strange woman, occasionally glancing suspiciously at the tiger.

"You're...." She falls silent for a moment, struggling as though recalling a faded memory. "You're a journalist. You're working on a story. I want you to get your computer, get whatever your materials are. We're leaving, right now, before the police come."

Morgan nods, and runs back to his study, grabbing a handful of notes and copying the story-in-progress to the laptop. It doesn't occur to ask how she knows who he is - indeed, he simply assumes she'd probably read his articles.

The tiger will change back to a woman by the time Morgan returns from his study. Jet might just be doing this to amuse herself at this point, honestly. Still, she has far more sympathy with Morgan than she does with Mary. On the other hand, Mary owes her something now. Not that she's expecting much! She will rush out to the front and get her bike back up and ready. A few more little dings, perhaps, due to her abrupt dismount, but nothing serious. She'll leave it to Mary to badger Morgan to greater haste. "We almost ready or what?" she shouts back at the house.

Though it seems longer, it's only a few minutes before Mary emerges, with a paper-encumbered Morgan in tow. The black woman bundles the journalist into the passenger seat of the Dodge and guns the engine. As she leads the way back out of Morgan's housing development, she unexpectedly takes a right turn, and as Jet follows, she can see in her rear-view mirror a police car, lights and siren blazing, cross the street behind them.

Jet sighs softly, looking back at the car. That's going to be another messy thing for someone to explain. The Full-Moon doesn't think about it for long, though. She's just going to casually follow Mary. She keeps her distance. Attention is the one thing she has no intention of drawing.

Morgan has been thinking, as the adrenaline slowly drains from his system. "So who were the other guys, anyway?" he asks, having figured out at least that his present captor - savior? - has nothing at all to do with whoever it was that had started the shooting. He hadn't had much time to look at the broken bodies next to his Lexus, either, but it was clear that either the black woman or her mysterious partner had taken care of them. Or possibly that tiger.

Mary answers with a brief look and nothing more. Her posture makes it rather clear that there will be very little conversation until this little trip is over. From all the turns she's taking, one might think she's lost. Or that she knows the area like the back of her hand. Jet finds it extremely irritating, but keeps up, secretly thinking of how to wring all the answers she wants out of the irritatingly secretive woman.

Morgan sighs, giving up, and tries to collate the hastily grabbed notes. "Fine. Why's it so important that I write _this_ story, anyway?" No answer to that either, and he just flips through the pages. Well, they do say that you don't get anything done if you try to focus on something too long without a break. "Helluva way to break a writer's block," he mumbles, as he tries to marshal his scattered wits around financial dealings once more.

---

The Dodge sputters to a halt in the parking lot of a Motel 6, and Mary dismounts. She gestures for Morgan to join her. A few minutes and a credit card later, the three have a room to themselves. Mary strips off her tank-top, leaving nothing of modesty but a lacy bra, and immediately takes possession of the bathroom. The sound of running water can be heard, along with her voice floating airly out. "Alright. So let's talk about what's going on."

"Sounds good to me!" Morgan calls. He's already plugged his Dell into the power outlet next to the lamp and is booting it up. "I mean, I'm just sitting there, minding my own business, when these guys come in and start shooting at me. And then _you_ two turn up and take care of _them_. What am I missing here?"

"Oh yeah. I'm missing the snake and the tiger," Morgan adds. "Maybe now's a good time to explain that."

The bathroom door opens; the water shuts off. Mary comes out wearing a towel over her shoulders, smiling hesitantly. "Look, umm, I apologize for that, sir. Introductions, then. My name is Mary. This is Jet. And you are?"

Morgan stands up and offers a handshake to both women, if they'll take it. "Andrew Morgan, Seattle Times."

Mary shakes, then draws back to make room for Jet - if she accepts as well.

Jet is going to just sit on the floor of the room, plucking at her clothes with a frown. She's wearing her usual: black button-down shirt, black leather pants, black shades. She looks up at Morgan's hand, arching an eyebrow behind those shades. She's polite enough to remove them at this point with her left hand, the right rising to shake the man's hand. Firmly.

"Jet and I are.. well, what we call the Exalted. You could think of us as endowed with some sort of extra energy or power. Or you could think of us as divinely blessed. Jet is one of the Lunar Exalted, Chosen of the goddess Luna. One of her talents because of that is shape-shifting."

Morgan hardly expects less than a firm handshake from the other woman - she's clearly at least as tough as her biker-chic outfit advertises. He sits down on the bed again, pulling the laptop onto his knee, but still looking up at the other two, skeptically. "Uh huh. So you're telling me that _she_," he says, nodding toward Jet, "was the snake and the tiger?" He doesn't sound like he believes a word of it - although the skepticism is tinged with a bit of uncertainty.

"I'm waiting to hear a better explanation." Mary's voice is cheerful, but her gaze is tense, and she falls into expectant silence.

Jet's growl carries very strongly and she looks over at Morgan with narrowed eyes. "If you think I'm going to just demonstrate for your amusement.." she says, trailing off into a silent warning. She has better things to do than that.

"The tiger's the tough one," Morgan admits. "I didn't see it come in. But then, I didn't see or hear those other people come in, either." He shrugs. If they want to believe in shapeshifters, that's fine by him. "So what do you want with me? I mean... er, thank you very much for saving my life," he says, feeling belatedly that that ought to be acknowledged, at least.

"What we want is for you to live, to do whatever it is you are going to do. Writing a story, it looks like." Mary frowns a bit, then something inside her seems to collapse. Emotional toil shows itself clearly as she flops down onto one of the meager beds. "I'm sorry. I.. They tell us to act calm and collected, to give the other Exalts confidence. But I admit I don't know what I'm doing, at least somehow." She looks up. "Mr. Morgan, we really do have your best interests at heart. Not because of who you are, personally, please don't be offended. But because of some greater good you can do."

Jet looks at Morgan for some time. "The tiger _is_ me," she says finally, her voice hinting at indignation. Her fists clench tightly and for a moment, it looks like she might actually give that demonstration. She looks over at Mary, opening her mouth to say something, but instead deciding to be wisely silent for the moment. "So, what exactly will you be writing about, Mister Morgan?" she asks abruptly.

Morgan sighs. "All right," he says, smiling a little. It's always flattering, to a reporter, to be told that he can serve the greater good. "Though _this_ story seems like a little thing, after I've just been _shot_ at. Probably for some other story I've already written - whatever the Discovery Institute does, I don't think they do hits!"

Morgan shrugs, and turns back to it. "No, what _these_ people do... and y'know, I think they may even think they're doing the right thing... is something that'll hurt society over the course of decades, without a shot being fired." He looks over the words he's written. "Now if only I can make that _clear_..." he mutters, and starts writing again, copy-and-pasting blocks of text in an attempt to build up the idea in a way that seems natural.

"What is it that they do?" asks Mary, curiously.

"Lie, distort, and prevaricate about scientific evidence," says Morgan. "But with a veneer of emotional appeal that's hard to fight head-on. And," he says, fingers stabbing at the keyboard, "support the whole thing with funds from extremist right-wing groups, while maintaining a mask of intellectual neutrality. They'll even change the names of their sub-organizations to try to cover their tracks, and expect people not to notice."

"Well, what is it they actually advocate?"

"Their biggest product's something called 'intelligent design'," Morgan says. Somehow, explaining this to someone else helps him organize his thoughts - it's almost like he has a Voice of the People in the room with him. "It's the idea that life on Earth is so complex that it can't possibly have evolved naturally. And hell, maybe that's even _true_, but the proof _they_ offer is bogus. A very _clever_ bogus, that plays off people's desire to feel special." He pauses, and looks up. "Of course, you two _are_ special, or so you claim," he says, with a wry smile. "Maybe I'm not talking to the right people here."

Mary nods slowly. "I see....Well, that explains a bit more about why you were attacked, I think," she says at last. "Mr. Morgan, I can't say I know all the answers. But I owe as much as I know to Jet for helping me save your life, something I couldn't have done alone. I do know that... well, that you should write your story, then go back to your life. After that's done, this won't be your fight any more. And if it should happen that you do die, at least let me offer the slim comfort that you'll reincarnate."

Morgan's brow furrows. "I _still_ don't believe that the Discovery Institute does hit squads - character assassination is more their style than the more physical sort. But... hm," he says, looking at the screen again. "That does give me an idea. Maybe I can add something about how our specialness doesn't need to depend on any _particular_ ideas about God. However we came to be here, we _make_ our own specialness..." He trails off, and his fingers clatter away at the keyboard again.

Jet shakes her head and sighs, "Not that special in origin," she says softly. She looks at Morgan closely. "Why exactly are we so very special?" she asks seriously. "If we tear away that veil of imagined divinity, what remains?"

Mary hums. "Whatever was always there, I think. Even mortals like Mr. Morgan have their parts to play."

Morgan's fingers stop again. "What remains... is our minds, and our hearts." He waves a hand around the room. "We have the ability to reshape our environment to our own will - and to reshape our own ways of thinking, as well. Whether God gave it to us, or whether it grew up by itself somehow... we have it now. Thinking minds, exploring our universe. And whatever God may want of us, I don't think he wants us to stick our heads in the sand and make up comforting fairy tales."

Mary laughs out loud at this. "That's great!" she exclaims. "For a mortal to say that, here, of all places!" Genuine amusement rings in her voice. "Mr. Morgan, I'm sorry I can't tell you more, but... it's just so ironic."

Jet arches an eyebrow at Mary's outburst and shakes her head. "She is very good at not telling people things," she says to Morgan. "Unless she decides it's something you need to know, of course." She looks at the woman with a growing frown. She will get her answers.

Morgan's smile is a little fixed - being called a mortal all the time like this is a bit off-putting. "If... if you say so, Mary," he says, chuckling. He turns to the laptop. "What these people do - even if they think they're fighting for the truth, the fact that they lie to do it... that I can't allow. Won't allow. The truth will set you free..." He pauses, as something finally registers. "Hang on a minute. What do you mean, this won't be my fight? This article's not going to put an end to the Discovery Institute all in one go, and hell, even if it does, they'll just reform again under a new name. It'll take generations to convince people they don't need tales like these to go on living."

"The article will set in motion a proper chain of events. The people who attacked you were probably inspired to prevent that, by someone capable of foreseeing it." Mary's reply is calmly measured. "As long as it gets written, what else is there for you to do in this thread of fate?"

Jet growls at Mary. "You know, sometimes I am tempted to gag you and throw you in the truck," she says flatly. She turns to Morgan, "Hopefully what she really means is that after this, you can get back to living a normal life in which shape-shifting biker chicks aren't killing armed men in your house."

Mystic stuff again. Morgan decides to humor this woman as best he can. "This thread? I dunno... not much. Maybe a follow-up article later on, unless something new comes up. I'd be doing other stories, of course, about things like corporate fraud and mob dealings, but that's probably not part of _this_ thread. Unless these threads of fate of yours are tangled in really weird ways."

"They are." Mary casts an apologetic glance at Jet. "I forget that you don't know what it's like for us. He doesn't know either, probably will never know. I can't explain it very well... but I _feel_ what I must do, all the time, and I _know_ the right paths to take. Even if people die, even if I have to make people die, I know it's all for the best."

Morgan nods at first. Then he sets the laptop aside and stands up. "And what happens if you're wrong?" he says, growling. "How many people are going to be 'made to die' for no reason, if you get it wrong?" He points at the laptop. "_Those_ people feel _they_ know what they must do, and if they succeed they'll put us back in the Stone Age!" he says, shouting now. "How come _your_ feelings are so much better than theirs?"

"And you don't seem to remember what it's like to be on this side of things," notes Jet softly. "You should occasionally consider dropping that facade of mystery. God forbid you act like a normal person for even a few minutes, though." She shakes her head at Mary and turns back to Morgan, not sure just what to say to him at first. "I'm not sure you will really believe the answer. I am not sure I do," she finally offers.

Mary listens to this quietly, anger filling up in her eyes. Finally she bursts out a response. "You don't know what it's like to be this! You have no idea what it's like to feel _how things will be_, down to your bones! Or to know.. that you _decide_ when people live or die! You think it's easy? You think I'm smug? Like I'm some sort of know-it-all? Like I choose to be this way?" Her reaction could be to either person, for she seems mostly to speak for the sake of speaking. "I'm not a normal person! I'm one of the fucking Chosen! But I have no choice anymore."

"There, like that," says Jet, smiling warmly. She looks at Mary closely, nodding. "Was that so very hard? To reveal yourself for just that moment. That was you."

Morgan takes a step back at Mary's outburst. "You really believe, don't you," he says, his voice still raised. "I dunno if that makes it better or worse!" He seems to realize that he's shouting, then, and calms down a little. "But I'm more like your friend here, for all that I can't go turning into snakes. We don't have these mystic feelings of rightness. All _we_ have to go on is what we can see with our eyes and our minds. We can't go around killing someone because we just 'know' they're in the way or something. We need to _see_ what they're going to do that's so wrong that they need to die for it."

"Then I envy you," Mary murmurs, and shuts her eyes. For her, the conversation is at an end.

Morgan breathes heavily, and sighs. "Well, you seem to think I _need_ to write this story, so I better get back to it..." he says, sitting back down and pulling the laptop back onto his knees.

Jet looks over at Mary, not quite sure what to make of the woman at this point. She rises smoothly and goes to sit down on the bed that Mary has flopped down on, reaching out to set her hand on the woman's shoulder, if it's allowed. She says to the woman, "Just rest for now. The universe can settle on other shoulders for a few hours." The Full-Moon turns back to Morgan then, watching him curiously, almost as if she's never seen someone work on a computer before. "It must be pretty strange, thinking that whatever you type is going to be read by thousands of people," she says softly.

"One and a half million, potentially," Morgan says, as he keeps typing. "Of course, that's just people who get the paper. I'm sure not all of them get that far past the front page and the comics to read _my_ articles," he says, grinning to himself. "Tens of thousands, at least. Maybe hundreds."

Jet continues asking little questions of Morgan. For her, it's just a novelty to get answers for a change. The topics might vary a lot, but they inevitably focus on the man's past. Why he became a writer, where he grew up, that sort of thing. Under the surface of that brawler is a rather different curiousity. Still, she has to let him get that article done, and will eventually fall into silence, settling down by Mary so Morgan can use the other bed. Not that Jet is going to be sleeping any time soon..

That evening, as Morgan's face is illuminated only by the Dell's monitor, and the only sounds he hears are his fingers striking keys, he realizes that another noise has revealed itself - a key of another sort, rattling in the lock to the motel room. He hears the door open, and turns, seeing a trenchcoated figure framed in the doorway.

Morgan gets up hurriedly, setting the laptop aside again. "Who are you?" he demands, his voice quavering more than a little - it is _not_ a good night to have more unexpected strangers dropping in, but since not all of tonight's unexpected guests have been trying to kill him, he forbears to make any assumptions about this one.

"When is the next eclipse, do you know?" comes the figure's voice, deeply masculine and assured.

Morgan blinks, though he does relax a bit - a question like that puts the new visitor strictly in the 'mysterious but not trying to kill me' category. "I don't know..." he says, leaning back down to type out a query on the laptop. "Nnnnext September, it looks like. On the 11th."

"An inauspicious date for you Americans. Allow me to change that. Come outside." The man gestures. Through the still-open door, the night wind blows warmth.

Morgan looks briefly at Jet and Mary, then shrugs, walking outside. "Okay..." he says, still wondering what this is about, but if there's one thing he's learned in the business, it's that people who talk as if they have a big mystery to keep like to take their time getting to the point.

Outside in the parking lot, the night moon shines. The man's trenchcoat rustles, and he stares upward. The lunar light reveals a handsome visage, with black hair and a goatee, and curiously bright eyes. "Andrew, isn't it? Say when, and look to the moon."

Morgan blinks, and looks at the stranger's eyes. "Say when what?" he asks, sounding puzzled as he glances upward, almost by reflex.

The stranger reaches out with a hand, seemingly grasping at air. From around the silver ring of the moon there begins to shine a faint light. It grows in power, becoming a visible disc. It is the corona of the sun, for the impossible has happened. A solar eclipse - at night, months away from its projected occurrence. It cannot be real, but it is. Morgan's eyes do not lie to him.

Morgan takes a step back, pop-eyed in shock. "It... it shouldn't do that," he says weakly, rubbing his eyes. "It..." He stops, and looks sharply at the stranger, then at the inexplicable solar eclipse. "How... how did you _do_ that? Or how'd you know it was going to happen?"

"The Eclipse. A crossing of Sun and Moon. Two opposites, coexisting harmoniously." The man smiles, looking across at his fellow moon-gazer. "Your world was the product of 'intelligent design'. Your world is a sanctum set aside for people who did not want to risk taking part in the shaping of fate. But you yourself.. you seem to want to take part in it again. Is that what your heart says?" The man's voice is calming. Effortlessly it wipes away doubt and fear. It resonates with truth.

And besides, if you can't believe your own eyes, then whose eyes _will_ you believe? Morgan shakes his head... and then nods. "Yes... yes it does. That's why I went into journalism in the first place."

"You have a chance to learn some of the truths about this sanctuary you live in. You have a chance to defend it. The Pharos of your soul can shine forth." The man smiles. "I am the Unconquered Sun, the sun-god, and what you see in the sky is my doing. I will give you my power. And in return I will charge you with my commandment, and give you my promise." He turns, and his gaze bores into Morgan's eyes. "Are you prepared?"

Morgan does not think to doubt those words - even if the reassurance of this being's voice were not enough, the unseasonal eclipse is undeniable. Morgan looks back into those eyes, and almost quails - he's used to looking people firmly in the eye in his job, but never has someone's gaze bored into his soul like this one has. But the gaze finds something in Morgan's heart, something that drives him to meet the stare unblinking. "I am prepared," he says.

"This is my commandment. That you use your power as a Solar Exalt, Chosen of the Unconquered Sun, to unite all under Heaven." The man smiles. "And this is my promise. Rely on your light, and it'll all be fine." And in that moment, the solar corona of the moon vanishes. Morgan is nearly blinded as it re-erupts, this time bound to his forehead in a burning brand. There is no pain, no hurt, no doubt, only an endless tide of energy outpouring from him. And then it is gone, leaving only an incandescence glowing over his eyes, just out of his vision.

Morgan blinks a few times, then looks back at the Unconquered Sun. "The Chosen... Mary spoke of the Chosen," he says softly. He looks up at the moon again, now innocently glowing alone in the sky once more. "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set ye free," he says, speaking the quote in full. He turns to ask the Unconquered Sun again: "Is there anything else you can tell me? Of what my... my light can do?"

"The divine spark now resting in your soul affects whatever you decide to do. It will perfect and ennoble whoever you already are. You will discover that its uses come to you naturally. But there will be training you need to use it properly for those things. This, too, you will discover."

"So you don't intend to teach me now," Morgan says, but without heat. "Fair enough. I _did_ sign on to take control of Fate, did I not? I can't go around having people just _telling_ me things - as long as I can find out for myself."

"I do not need to teach you. You have learned the first lesson yourself," the Unconquered Sun remarks with a paternal smile. "Now. You must decide what to do about your two companions."

Morgan blinks, tilting his head. "_I_ need to decide what to do about _them_? What do you mean?" he asks, sounding puzzled. "They seemed pretty capable of taking care of themselves. What do they need from me?"

"That will be your second lesson." And in a flash of brilliant golden light, the man who stood before Morgan is gone.

Morgan stands there for a moment - but only for a moment. His whole life has been turned upside down in a moment, but his _self_ is intact. And his sense of duty has his own demands. He returns to the hotel room, to check on his companions - trusting in the words of the Unconquered Sun, and in his own 'light', to see whatever it is that must be done.
