# Fall of Eden 2005-12-23

Separately, two men receive invitations from Hel, the master of the private Swiss chalet and bunker which acts as one of the safe-houses of Earth's Sidereal forces. Separately they arrive at opposite doors to the study, and separately they enter, seeing each other as strangers for the first time.

Hel is waiting in the study. Vivaldi is playing, an ethereal sound coming from hidden speakers. The man closes his book and sets it on the table, rising and bowing perfunctorily. "Thank you for joining me, both of you." He gestures at each man as he speaks to the other. "Dr. Benford, Jack Jones, automobile courier and nascent Sidereal Exalt. Mr. Jones, Doctor Newton Benford, noted physicist and nascent Solar Exalt."

Benford nods to Jack, and offers his hand. "A pleasure," he says, a bit prefunctorily.

The dark-haired Chosen of Journeys, Jack, takes Benford's hand in one of his and shakes it. Oddly, he proffers a plastic packet of rock candy with the other. "Can I tempt you?"

Benford smiles, in spite of himself. "Easily, sir. Especially this early in the morning." He accepts the packet of candy and pops a piece in his mouth.

Hel speaks. "The gods have chosen you for your respective roles, gentlemen. It is our duty as the European Convention to facilitate those roles while you are on European soil. It is a consequence of the Exaltation that most of the actual training we can provide is mundane. Essence manipulation is a skill that none of us are particularly proficient in, and we have found that the best results come from a student's own delvings. Pursuant to that, I am requesting that both of you carry out a brief assignment which will assist all of us."

Jack offers a lopsided grin, taking a seat and noisily shifting his own piece of candy around in his mouth. "What've you got for us, Hel?"

"You will find your physical, mental, and mystical abilities taxed, but not overtaxed, by this assignment. In brief, you are to penetrate a NATO military installation incognito, and install something for us. That something is a node of what we call 'The System'. The optimal time for penetration has been predicted to be February 5, 2007. This leaves just less than two weeks. Please familiarize yourselves with the assignment, and with each other, in that time. If you have any questions, I am available during my normal hours."

Benford raises an eyebrow. "If you're seeking to keep a low profile, sending two associates to infiltrate a military installation is awfully risky. Do you have a cover prepared or should we see to it ourselves?"

"Consider that part of the training. It is a skill you will need anyway," Hel replies calmly.

"Sounds like fun," Jack presents in place of a question of his own.

Benford eyes a thick manila folder on a nearby table, one of Hel's trademarks. "Is that information we can use in planning?"

"You have that. You have whatever other information you feel you need." Hel smiles. "Part of the lesson to be learned here is this: people are people, but at the same time they are assets to you. Use the expertise of anyone in this chalet, including myself, to achieve your end."

Benford nods, slowly. "Then let's have a look over that folder and see what options we have. Jack, maybe we should leave Hel to his other duties and try this in the library."

With a nod, Jack stands to take up the folder and starts to move towards the library. He gives Hel a casual one-handed salute as he passes, unwinding the file wordlessly and beginning to flip idly through.

Benford follows Jack a few steps behind, sparing Hel a nod.

The dossier begins with an explanation as follows: 'The System is not a single object, or entity, or concept. Rather, it is something which binds such things together. It is a tool for interfacing physical existence to metaphorical truth. It is the mechanism by which we Sidereals access and manipulate Earth's destiny. Principally the Sidereals do so through computers, and many aspects of The System are structured along computing lines. There are other sorts of access, including the oldest - the stars themselves.'

The document explains further, but the more Benford reads, the less he understands. There are glyphs, or symbols, written on cards which should be shown to as many people as possible within the facility. The dossier says that it is important, but not crucial, that neither of the Exalts actually see the symbols. There are several 'black box' components - some with Ethernet jacks or USB connectors, some with power plugs of the standard type, some with odd connectors for cables of an unknown type. There is software on CD-ROM.

Finally, there are words which should be spoken, at specific times or places within the facility itself.

Benford says, "Good Lord. What a hodge-podge. There are several pieces to install, and some of them are hardware. It seems most likely that at least one of us will have to be on site for this." He pauses. "Forgive me for asking this, Jack, but do you have much experience with being in places against the will of the rightful owner?"

The Sidereal chuckles briefly, crunching the last of his rock sweet. "Enough, perhaps. I'll see what I can get set up."

A skilled forger is employed nearby, and Hel dispatches one of his un-Exalted associates to retrieve identification from the woman. Her work will take three days to complete, once she is given the final specifications for what she'll be forging. The answer to this question is tied to the reason the date was so auspicious.

A new commanding officer recently took charge, and a large amount of political baggage followed him into the position. As such, security procedures are being overhauled on a regular basis, and several defense contractors have been invited into the facility in spite of regulations and clearance. While it is hardly the most corrupt operation ever, security is as lax as it is ever likely to be at the installation.

For hardware, a nondescript local car is provided. Electronic lockpicks and tumbler guns are made available for forced entry, while a list of contractors and their hotels is provided in the event the pair wish to acquire and duplicate keys.

Benford scowls at this news. "If we can do this, then it's a safe bet that the bad guys can pull it off too." He pauses. "Assuming we're the good guys." He glances over the list of contractors. "I'm going to go have a look at these. It would follow that whoever originally supplied the security is on this list, it would be convenient to get the plans to the place and a master key from them."

Steve Browning is a contractor, like many other men in Europe. He wouldn't know that he was the target of a break-in attempt if the thieves left a monogrammed thank-you note on his bedside table. He's a traditional engineer, schooled in the traditional manner. He's a member of the Freemasons. He wears glasses. He's married, has pictures of the wife, and likes to hike.

The security man glances at his photo badge, his eyes glazed over from the Dutch romp video playing on the television. Steve's badge slides over the electronic scanner, which is far more vigilant. He enters the office.

Steve isn't stopped by anyone here. He doesn't have colleagues or friends. These men come and go, hired for their expertise and released back to the States with a substantial bonus. Some spend it here, in the city of Geneva, where the offices live. Some are wiser.

Most don't think about the far-off bases they work on, buried under bedrock and wired to intercept the satellite and radio transmissions of a hemisphere. Most are content to do their job and keep their head down. Government work is like that.

That's why nobody thinks twice when Steve checks out the CAD files for their latest project, slabbing them onto a USB thumbnail drive. Most people do work from home anyway, because it's easier to work long hours when you have a beer next to your computer.

Steve makes small-talk with the man who rides the elevator with him, and gets out on the first floor. He asks the receptionist for a few extra drafting pencils for his office, then heads out.

On the drive home, he stops being Steve Browning and resumes life as Jack Jones. One metaphorical mask is traded for another. In that moment, Steve Browning ceases to exist.

Jack spends intervening time pouring over what parts of Hel's documents deal with the layout and specifics of the NATO installation, and supplements the data with what was learnt under the guise of Steve. His plans cover entry and exit, as well as contingency routes for various circumstances that could develop. It is a task the courier set himself to many times prior to his Exaltation, and it is a simple matter to perform it now with expert precision.

Benford examines the information that Jack retrieved, visibly impressed. "This is quite thorough. I'm glad I'm working with you." Within an hour he's got a simulation of the building running on a computer and catalogs the security measures, noting weak points and overrides. He briefly retires to the workshop in the basement to construct countermeasures, including a ringful of master keys and keycards to search for override codes.

Early on the morning of February 5th, 2007, Jack and Benford roll up to the gates of the NATO base in a 'borrowed' Mercedes, a vehicle with a little more power than most, but common enough among the trickle of visitors to draw no special notice. Jack, of course, is at the wheel; both he and Benford are dressed conservatively in business outfits common among the civillian contractors. The boot holds two steel briefcases, one for each of them, where the physical components of The System are hidden among mundane items like screwdrivers and testing terminals.

Jack and Benford present their clearance papers to the guard at the gate, which identifies them as employees of IBM's Federal Systems Division, with top secret clearance. Again, the clearance is common enough to be useful without being memorable.

The soldiers have seen it all. This is more routine. Everything checks out. Even things the soldiers don't consciously expect check out - the faint odor of Gaku Gaku herbal green tea on the paperwork, the characteristic signature at the bottom, the slight overexposure the photo-badges always produce in the final pictures, the immaculate green-screen with the silhouette of the open door.

Jack and Benford are waved through without further ado. Their presence is logged in the computer system just as it always would be. Nor do the soldiers seem to notice at all when the men flash their glyph-laden cards. It is as though they are forgotten the moment they are witnessed.

The two Exalts park near the main SigInt building and retrieve their briefcases from the trunk. Benford pulls a small package from his pocket and hands it to Jack. "Present for you. This is a non-smoking building. I thought you might want this." It's a package of Nicotrol nicotine chewing gum, as prescribed to smokers trying to quit. "See you at lunchtime."

His boot crunches on the road as Jack steps out, taking the gum with a wry grin. "Let's get this party started, then," he murmurs, striding towards the complex entryway with one of the forged ID tags bouncing about his neck.

Benford falls in a few steps behind. Once within the building, the two split up to their separate tasks.

Benford follows his part of the plan, checking cryptic notes in a small, cheap wirebound scratchpad in his pocket. He's nervous at first, until he realizes that the whole place is little different from CERN - billion dollar hardware, sensitive instruments, hazardous materials and crazy clearances. The guards have bigger guns, but that doesn't frighten Benford much; even in a secured area, the military police aren't likely to shoot an unarmed man. Hel's little toys install easily in equipment racks. The strange incantations are hidden in a thick technical manual and are little different from the other obscure mutterings therein. After two hours he's even getting a little bored, and reminds himself that even walking the boring cinderblock halls is still better than being confined to a wheelchair.

Silvery case in hand, Jack works his way around the building with the air of efficiency expected of a contractor's employee paid by job - the sooner this undertaking is complete, the sooner payment is rendered and the next can begin. He flashes rune-inscribed cards wordlessly at all those he passes, working through the progression of tasks that Benford laid out for him to follow and chewing absently on the nicotine gum. Wire-framed glasses with lenses tinted yellow are perched upon his nose, preventing passers from taking note of the Sidereal's unusual eyes.

Benford's last task is to insert a CD into a server in an equipment rack in the basement. He swipes one of his special keycards through the reader on a door, waits a moment for the decrypter to work, and then swipes it again. The warrant officer sitting at a small desk at the end of the hall doesn't even notice. The click of the door opening is lost in the white noise of the hundreds of cooling fans inside. The inside of the room is festooned with racks of patch panels and cable runs thick with ubiquitous blue network cable; the blue color indicates that this is an unsecure part of the network. Benford frowns and considers this, then removes the CD from his briefcase. It's a rewritable type that just has 'Software Patch' scrawled on the top in black magic marker.

Benford turns the CD over and inspects the data side, and immediately realizes that something is unusual about the disc. As with any disc, the microscopic encoding of data turns the light into rainbow patterns, but the refracted image shifts and wobbles in his vision, like a living thing. Benford frowns and turns the disc over quickly, remembering Hel's warning to avoid looking at the glyphs on the index cards, and slips it into the server: a firewall device that interfaces between the nonsecure network and the public Internet. The notes indicate that the program will erase the disc when it's done running. His task complete, Benford retreats to the entrance.

---

Newton and Jack meet up, and find a message on Newton's Quicksilver. It's not even video, just a plain old-style text message: NODE ACTIVE. GOOD WORK.

Benford shows the phone to Jack. "I guess the client is satisfied. Shall we go?"

The Sidereal nods, and the two retreat to the entry and outside. Jack extracts the gum from his mouth with a disgusted look and throws it upon the ground. He exchanges it for a cigarette from his pocket swiftly, taking the first thoughtful puff and giving Benford a nod of appreciation. "Your plans went well."

Benford says, "Thanks." He grins. "I could get to enjoy this."
