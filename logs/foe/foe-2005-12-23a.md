Sleep had to come sooner or later. Becca is camped out on Jet's bed, while Mary and Morgan both occupy their respective bunks. Jet cannot stay awake forever; the body has its demands, and since her Exaltation she has become keenly aware of the wisdom of these ancient instincts.

In her dreams, Jet roams as a tiger. Her black-and-orange fur ripples with exaggerated muscularity. Her fangs hold the power to rend and tear. She stalks a forest with other tigers. Most are cubs - hers, she feels, for she recognizes Becca without the woman's face or form, but rather as a young tigress who timidly hangs back to learn the hunt.

The forest which forms the backdrop for the hunt is no ordinary place; Jet's dream-feeling tells her that. But her senses can encompass it, meaning her instincts can command it.

Her prey flees before her, and Jet gives chase. Her fellow tigers and tigresses follow her lead - curiously unlike tigers. Perhaps, like Jet herself, they are more than they seem. The forest is shrouded in the darkness of midnight, but the moon's light shines through the canopy. And where moonbeams strike, Jet's eyes perceive darting prey.

_Hunt,_ the Moon urges. _Hunt in the name of all you are._

The voice echos in Jet's very blood and soul, her fur glinting with moonsilver as she charges on, darting almost soundlessly through the brush, flying past the boles of trees, faster and faster. Sensing a change in the air and the noise of shattered leaves the Full Moon slows only until she spots the beginning of a sharp descent, a near cliff that dives down into a mist-flooded valley below. Her pack minds her well, and they follow carefully where Jet leads, claws finding purchase in the steep decline, but she must slow to see that her kits are making their way safely.

With her family at her side Jet rushes off, no longer relying upon her eyes to stalk her prey, but upon her nose. She takes measure of the trees and the wind, the wet air no bar to her skill. She rushes on, the other tigers following swiftly, all eager for the kill, yet not the Lunar herself. This is itself her hunger. The hunt. With the wind flowing over her and the leaves dripping with dew above, she embraces a part of herself that must be held back in the waking world.

The chase leads on down deeper into the valley, and the sound or rushing water is ahead. With a low growl the great tiger guides her prey along the bank, snuffing the air and minding carefully the mud at the side of the river. Some half mile downstream the trail is clear. Prints. With a rush the tigers barrel through the churning waters, climbing onto the other bank where the prints go on, into a more dense part of the wood yet.

The other bank, curiously, is made out of concrete, and the pack must hunt by scent instead of tracks. The trees are no longer wood, but steel and glass, though they are still clearly what trees _are_ - hiding places, obstructions to vision, and camouflage for the cunning hunter. The tracks become ATM deposit slips and credit card receipts in trash-cans, but they are still what tracks _are_. The quarry is moving on two legs rather than four, but it is still prey.

The tiger's instincts serve just as well in this place. Men stand aside as the tiger's roar intimidates them, or move about in groups that let the tiger hide itself from detection. Swaying like grass, the inhabitants of the urban forest perform the same duty they would in a more organic setting.

The rest of the pack has changed too, but what they _are_ is the same - fellow hunters, red of tooth and claw. Here, an innocuous college student. There, a sanitation worker with access to every room in the building. Their claws and fangs have changed outwardly, yes, but they still _are_.

The Moon whispers, _Hunt with your pack. Hunt and take your fill._

Jet finds herself hunting in whole new ways. The smile, the look, the caress, the fang in the throat. They are still there, but outwardly they seem different. The pack sweeps through cities, finding their prey: the corrupt, the injust, the murderous. Trails are words, streams of digits through cyberspace, and sometimes pure instinct. This forest is not so different.

In this new forest, the hunt doesn't lead just to single prey, but to beasts that have no face. The tiger needs to be clever, lying in ambush and baiting its prey with soft words and subtle promises, until finally weakness is revealed and the last stages of the hunt can begin. The taste of blood may not fill the mouth, but the glory of slain prey is more than sweet enough to takes its place.

Five found dead in failed bank robbery. A record heroin bust at the docks. A strange amount of money moves through the wires. The scents are strange in this hunt, but connections can be found. Every forest makes sense when one knows what feeds it, what drives it. Greed for money, greed for power, they are the primal force driving those she hunts. It makes them strong, and it makes them weak. Fits of vengeance and overly complex plans leave many loose ends. The tigers prowl along them all. They are no longer a pack running side by side, but one large animal with ten eyes and a score of hands, all acting with their own talents, seeing from their own minds and making for a terrifying beast of prey.

Finally, the hunting pack reaches the shore of a great and boundless ocean. The Moon sparkles down on the water, teasingly. _What will you do now?_ it asks, in a gentle voice.

There is no hesitation. Into the eternal sea leaps the tiger, this great beast striving for greast pursuit of all, the Moon herself. Jet knows no finer hunt, nor any sweeter prey, and nothing so small as the neverending sea shall stop the Chosen from finding her mistress again.

But the sea is the sea, and a tiger will not survive in it. Jet finds herself suddenly deprived of air as she sinks, and only frantic flailing brings her to the surface - and then, only for moments.

But the Lunar is many things, and just as her patron changes constantly, she too must change herself. When the way is barred, the rules must be changed. The tiger no longer is a tiger, but in a shimmering becomes a great shark, prowling the seas, its pale, unblinking eyes turning ever upward, and the hunt goes on.

Yet the seas are not empty, nor are they naught but more prey beneath the waves. There are dark things in the deeps, and the great shark must find them. The great shark must slay them in the name of the Moon. Enormous squids, darting eels, and great whales face the shark, and one by one are slain, yet each leaves a mark, a wound of honor that shall be worn with pride, no less a badge than the moonsilver pattern that glides like hair above the shark's head.

Here in the deeps, where sounds carry farther than sight, there are other sorts of prey. The dreams of men swim here in schools, unaware of the predatory nightmares swirling about them. Minds project themselves out into the dark from their shallow lives and swim. The cunning hunter can eat, but also listen to their whispers as each blindly seeks for its fellows.

And here Jet finds herself facing, suddenly, that which haunts her own dreams. She throws herself awake, crying aloud.

Morgan was sleeping only lightly, having had most of a night's sleep earlier. He blinks at the sound, and rolls over on his own bunk. "Are you all right, Jet?" he hisses softly.

Jet is, as usual, on her feet as fast as possible. Her breath comes in gasps and she shakes from head to toe. She shuts her eyes tightly and answers in a false calm, "It's nothing. Just a dream."

Morgan rubs his eyes, sitting up. "Well, I've watched you rouse from sleep three times, and each time you've done it with a gasp. Something troubles you in your sleep..."

Jet frowns and sits down on the bed, "Yeah, well.. what are your dreams about?" She looks back at the man almost defiantly. "You probably wouldn't want to be bored by that sorta stuff anyway. Shouldn't we be talking about what we're going to do today?"

Morgan shrugs. "I don't usually remember my dreams that well..." he says. If she doesn't want to talk about it, he won't press the issue... for now. "But... what _are_ we going to do today, come to that? Our hostess here -" he gestures in Mary's direction, "hasn't given me many details yet."

"I'm sure she'll take us somewhere," says Jet softly. Her mind is clearly not on this, nor is her heart in it, either. She lowers her face into a hand, cupper it across her eyes. "I wish this gift meant I wouldn't have to sleep ever again," she mutters.

_In time, child, you will hunt even nightmares,_ the Moon whispers, to Jet and to Jet alone.

Morgan just shakes his head - all this is beyond him, as yet. "Have you managed to get a little rest, at least?" he says softly, hopefully.

"I guess," says Jet. She smiles strangely, though Morgan cannot see it. That voice is a comfort, and yet it feeds her hunger. "Just doesn't feel like it sometimes. We flee hardest before the things we know we cannot escape." She looks over to Becca, making sure she is still asleep. Seeing her eyes shut peacefully draws a soft sigh from the Full Moon.

Morgan nods - a soft rustling in the dark. "That's good, at least," he says. "Do you think we should let Mary sleep some more, do you think?"

"There is no reason to wake her," says Jet. "Let them both sleep. It seems they've both had very long days. For one, at least, those days should grow more comfortable, though I think Mary's troubles, like ours, are only just beginning."
