# Fall of Eden 2005-12-31

Departure from the motel is swift and expedient. Mary has everthing in her truck by 9 in the morning. The only stop the little convoy makes is for gas and food, and even that is drive-through from Jack In The Box. By 10:30, the truck and Jet's motorcycle are burning through Olympia on I-5 southbound. Mary signals a turn at the junction with Highway 101.

Northeast until almost noon, then south along the coast. The September weather is nippy but certainly bearable, with abundant sunlight. Off the coast, the clouds gather to gossip amongst themselves. The drivers experience brief flirtations with rainclouds, which thankfully go nowhere.

Becca and Andrew ride with Mary for now; the hidden guns and ammo she has in the flatbed are all secure. Jet rides alone - without leathers, any passenger she took would become quite cold in a short amount of time.

Jet rather likes a nice ride, even if it is chilly. Her mind is on all sorts of things. She's not worried, though. She has someone to take care of, which she finds curiously uplifting. It's enough to make her think that things really are taking a turn for the better. Still, there is a long road. Something in the new her knows that it's not going to be easy.

The vehicles pull into Crescent City, at the junction of 101 and 199, well after dark. Lunch was Grant's Pancake and Omelette House up the coast; bed and breakfast will be courtesy of the Crescent Beach Motel. Mary checks in with the same tense energy she displayed during the night raid on Andrew's house, and directs everyone to get "what sleep you can".

Jet will be happy to get as little sleep as she can get away with. She has a rather different way about her as she examines the motel. She can't help but think of ambushes, chart out the fastest way to get out of there in a tight spot. She's a bit peculiar, perhaps, but she's not safisfied until she's stalked about the building twice, sniffing the air and checking the ground.

Jet finds the place rather nice aesthetically, but really not great for defenses. The walls look like they'll only stop weak firearms. The windows she amuses herself by picking a few times. Ah well. It'll do. She will head inside after a few moments and assure, "We should be pretty safe here." Hardly makes sense to really expect anything bad to happen, anyway, right?

Mary shrugs a bit at the news. "We're not safe until we know just what the opponent is, right?"

Jet smirks, "Assuming that knowledge does you any good. I was trying to instill calm, but since you want a dash of realism. The walls are weak and easily shot through, the windows might as well be wide open for a decent thief, and the doors won't take more than an average man's kick. So basically this is like just about any normal place we'll see."

"Then nobody will come looking for us," is Mary's flat reply. "Get sleep."

Jet sighs and stretches, heading for the bathroom. She pauses to put a hand on Becca's shoulder and ask, "How are you holding-up?" She carries herself differently when she's near Becca, becoming far less threatening in her posture, and her touch is a tender gesture. The soft answer is, "I'm okay. Can I ride with you next time?" Jet smiles and sighs, "Only if we get you some clothes first. You'd freeze like this."

Becca nods reluctantly but does not argue the point. Jet doesn't really seem to leave this topic open for discussion. She will head into the bathroom, leaving Becca to wait on the bed. She pulls her shoes off, quite eager to curl up under the covers and obey Mary's orders. "Sleeeeep," she sighs out, sprawling back on the bed. "So where are we going, anyway?"

"San Francisco," the dark-skinned woman answers. "One of our headquarters."

"I've been there before," says Becca softly. "It's really beautiful. Do you think we'll have time to look around a bit?" She will tug the covers down on the bed and slide under them, fully-clothed. She'll get undressed for bed under them, so nobody sees anything in appropriate. Jet comes out of the bathroom and has no such issues, throwing her jacket and shirt aside before she even gets her boots off. "So we got a ways to go still, it seems," says the Lunar flatly.

"We always will. It's like that for us," murmurs Mary. She smiles over at Becca. "We'll talk to each other in strange ways, dear. Don't mind it, okay?"

"I try not to," says Becca softly. "I know that something odd is going on, but.. it doesn't matter." She rolls on to her side and watches Jet very closely. "You ever see a movie and wish you had a life like that? That you were near something so special and exciting?" She looks to Mary, "It's weird, but it feels like that." Jet laughs softly, but it is not unkind. She throws her pants over a chair and goes to join Becca in the bed, sliding in with a sigh. She looks exhausted, but she also looks like one who wants nothing to do with sleep, making a point of propping herself up with pillows.

"Movies are scripted," says Mary. Her voice takes on a curious tone. "The hero, the heroine, the supporting cast. Everyone knows what they are doing. There is a director. There are cast. The script has been written. Maybe the director will let you ad-lib your lines, or make suggestions for how your character should act. But isn't the script out of your hands?" She shakes her head. "That's not the life for everyone. Though it's a very pretty dream. As long as you are the heroine.."

"I don't mean to be the heroine," says Becca. She looks pointedly to Jet. The Lunar will do her best to pretend not to see that look and cough softly. "This isn't much like any movie I've seen, but it is interesting being swept up in the moment and taking risks. The best thing for us is not always what we expect." She leans in to whisper to Becca, "I cannot claim to be a hero, but I will take care of you and keep you safe until you wish to be on your own."

That seems to satisfy Becca. After all, that's what all heroes would say. She is still trying to figure out exactly what her relationship with her new friend is. She has a feeling it's going to be fairly complex, and she's proceeding with a mix of caution and playful curiousity. For now, she will just curl up at Jet's side, smiling when the Lunar strokes her hair fondly. "Get sleep, dear. You are safe." Jet turns her focus to Mary, then, "I'm still curious though. Why ride to Frisco. Isn't it faster to fly if we're in a huge hurry? Why are we in a hurry?"

"Security checkpoints. Computers." This is all Mary has to say on the matter, it seems.

Jet frowns at the very terse explanation, but imagines that her employers have their reasons. "Works for me. I'm rather used to working for people who don't want to answer questions." She shifts just a little bit on the bed, getting a bit more comfortable. She even shuts her eyes, though she's not planning on sleeping until she is too exhausted not to. "Do you know where our assignments will take us, Mary?"

"Darkness.. Desert... That is all I see," the Sidereal woman whispers. "We will know more soon..." Her breathing stabilizes as she rests, taking on a slow and easy rhythm.

"That doesn't sound encouraging," replies Jet. The Full Moon smirks and sounds amused. "We'll deal with whatever comes. I do the job. I imagine you wouldn't be interested in me if you didn't know that, though."

There is no reply. Mary has already fallen asleep, tired from driving all day.

Jet sighs softly and turns to look at Becca. "Sleeping, Becca?" The girl shifts slightly, answering quietly, "Almost." She wears a lazy, relaxed smile. Jet decides not to bother the girl for now, instead caressing her hair and helping her relax. "I'm glad you are here. I know you'll be happier this way." Becca nods, her reply very soft, "I already am."

Only after everyone else sleeps does Jet really consider it. She knows what is waiting for her. "One more time," she whispers quietly. With a mocking smirk she drifts off to face her demons. They will always be waiting for her.

---

It feels like the middle of the night, although Jet's body isn't aching with exhaustion. Her eyes open. The hotel room is here, but a light breeze is playing through the open window, bringing with it the tang of the sea air.

It takes her a moment to recognize that a shadowy shape is crouching on the table, staring at her with luminous eyes.

Jet rises swiftly, looking at that shape with narrowed eyes. "What the hell are you?" she demands. She hardly expects a peaceful encounter. Few have been lately. She also has this suspicion that this isn't going to be a simple conversation. She's ready for a fight.

The thing drops from the table to the floor with feral grace, and the light from outside shines off a formidable set of talons. The thing is revealed to have a flowing mane of hair on its head, and is at least somewhat humanoid in its lithe outlines. _Follow,_ it whispers, soft as the wind, then bolts through the window in a single, powerful leap.

Jet cracks her knuckles and follows swiftly, leaping easily through the window. She doesn't really wish to have the grounds for a battle chosen by the enemy, but she'd rather face that than get her friends hurt. "What are you here for?" she hisses angrily.

_You,_ the voice answers. Jet wheels to find the shape - an athletic female human form, perhaps, if people had fur - clinging to the side of the motel. It swiftly ascends to the roof, disappearing over the edge.

Jet sighs and looks upward. Well, that's quite a trick, she has to admit that. She has gained a few abilities herself since her changing, and though she is perhaps not quite so graceful, she follows effectively and quietly.

On the roof, the feral woman with her long hair is crouched as before. She holds up one hand, with its talons, showing them retracting smoothly into her fingers. Soft-furred skin melds into place over them, and she has an ordinary, albeit hairy, hand. _Imitate,_ she insists.

Jet looks at the woman and shakes her head, "I cannot do that." She doesn't like saying that, for some reason. The revelation is a twofold annoyance. It is both a lack of ability and she's having to reveal something of a weakness to a potential enemy. "What is your name?"

The crouching feral form hisses angrily. _Imitate!_ she whispers again.

Jet growls, "I cannot do that!" She flexes her hands and stands ready. "Maybe you didn't hear me the first time.." She holds up her hand and, as is the way with things, tries to control the power that flows into her. She knows there must be more she can do, but she hasn't quite got the grasp of _how_ it can be done. She tries to envision talons on her hands, focusing her mind on it utterly.

_Essence,_ hisses the figure. And to Jet's surprise, her fingertips begin to tremble slightly.

Jet tilts her head, feeling something. "Essence?" she asks quietly. She can feel.. something. It's like flexing a muscle for the first time. It's hard to even get it to fire, and the movement it takes is far from controlled. She concentrates more and more fiercely, growling now not at the other, but at the limits of her own will.

Frustrated, the figure grabs hold of Jet's wrist and holds her hand out. It thrusts the other hand against the back of her forearm - and miraculously, pushes _through_ the skin. It is not a wound, and does not hurt. More of a melding of some kind. The sensation is indescribable. The woman-beast stops only when her own hand is thrust in up to the forearm, and it seems as though she now wears Jet's hand like a 'glove'. _Essence!_ she howls to the night wind, and Jet feels a thrill of power surge through her. Her 'guide' is manipulating her hand - she can feel this for certain - and claws pop out of her fingers. The skin and bone seals itself perfectly around these extrusions.

Jet narrows her eyes, shuddering a bit at what she sees. "What is Essence?" she demands softly. She tries to focus on the way the claws are forming, hoping that somehow she can copy this. It's hard to focus, though. Hard to even think of anything when that other weird sensation is flooding her senses.

Abruptly the feral woman pulls her hand away. Jet's claws subside back into her hand, and so does the strange, tingling feeling. The woman points up toward the bright moon hovering in the sky. "Magic. From Her." Her voice sounds strange, coming from a throat unaccustomed to human speech. "You have fought, and ridden. It is the Rush. It is the Zone. It is the Thrill."

Her. Jet crosses her arms and looks at the strange woman, eyes going over this curious visitor. "How do I learn to use this magic?" she asks seriously. "Is it dangerous to learn on my own?"

"Yes. So I come." The woman smiles, exposing a mouth of white teeth, and fangs to match. "Your dreams. They are soft. Easy to enter."

"My dreams are rarely 'soft'," answers Jet, sounding at least a little bit angry. "And what gives you the right to slip into my mind like this?" She frowns and studies this strange guest more closely, "Why are you helping me, anyway?"

_I.. you.. the same,_ the woman replies, answering once more in the feral whisper of the night wind.

"So you are one of Her's, as well," says Jet. She still is wary, of course. She wouldn't have lived this long if she were quick to trust. "Have you spied on my dreams before?"

"I am always in your dreams," the woman whispers. "You .. I .. not the same type. We are the same. I am you. You are I."

"What? How can that be?" asks Jet. "You are.." She nods. "No, I don't understand it."

"You die.. Her Gift moves to another, yes? What of you?" the woman asks, still crouching on the rooftop.

"So you are the part of me that moves on?" asks Jet quietly. "But if that is true, why don't you walk my dreams every night?" She might sleep a lot better that way.

"Old.. make way for the new," is the whispered answer.

"I don't know what you mean," murmurs Jet. "I don't think it matters. What else can I learn about essence tonight? I don't know how much time I have left before morning." She plans on using it well.

In answer, the feral woman rises, looking down with a smoldering exception, then casts her head back and howls to the moon. In answer, her back surges and swells. White bird's wings erupt suddenly, sweeping outward, foot after foot forming. The nascent wings snap into place, and the woman leaps from the edge of the motel roof. The powerful wings start to beat. "Essence.. Courage, hope, and desire all make it. Remake yourself with it!" she calls. "Walk as woman, walk as beast. Mate with both. Understand both!"

The woman flies off, heading toward the ocean until she can no longer be seen.

Jet watched that other part of her fade into the nothingness, shaking her head. "I think that kind of understanding is going to have to wait," she says softly. She hopes that the mate part was just a metaphor.

Jet will leap agilely from the rooftop, then crawl back in through the window. She takes the time to shut it, laughing a bit at the idea of doing this in a dream. "Good habits," she murmurs quietly.
