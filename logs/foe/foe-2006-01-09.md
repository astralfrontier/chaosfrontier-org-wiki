# Fall of Eden 2006-01-09

Benford has had more exposure to Switzerland than Hel's chalet. Here and there, he has taken trips - always accompanied by Jack, at Hel's insistence - to the high lakes and mountainsides. In the earliest days of spring, walking through the grassy fields, the pressures of life can subside a little. The senior Sidereal considers such peaceful retreats as important to the scientist's Exaltation and miraculous recovery as any exercise program or training.

The sun shines brightly, flashing rays across the waters of a lake by which the pair have set up camp. In this, the spring of 2007 is much like the spring of 1607, perhaps even the spring of 2007 B.C. There is a changelessness in the air.

It is during the evening of one such sunny day that Benford, alone, finds that someone has approached his tent. Jack is off by himself, doing whatever it is that Jack does. The stranger is dressed like a hiker, with Germanic features and slicked-back black hair, and he hails Newton in English as he draws near.

Benford stands, leaning on a heavy walking stick - both a prop to cover his 'recovery', and a means of defense, if it comes to that. _No mere prop for the aged._ He levers himself upright with more effort than is strictly necessary, and greets the approaching stranger. "Hello," he calls. "I'd say you're far from home," he continues, grinning, "but then, so is everyone who's come out this far."

"I'd say not far at all," the stranger says, and laughs in a peculiar way. He drops his backpack to the ground and sits down next to it, exhaling with exaggerated effort. From one jacket pocket he withdraws a handful of wooden puzzle-pieces, of a type Benford recognizes as forming a cube when the puzzle is solved, and absent-mindedly begins to play with them as he speaks. "My name is Selber. Do you have something to drink?"

Benford raises an eyebrow. "I assume you mean other than water. It's a lot of effort to carry bottles up this far. But... as it happens..." He retrieves his rucksack and fishes out a bottle of Hefewiezen, which he passes to the stranger before resuming his seat. Still not being the most trusting sort, Benford merely pops the top on a Nalgene bottle filled with plain old water. He watches the stranger's puzzle with some interest, but doesn't offer any unsolicited advice for the moment.

Selber chuckles quietly and accepts, and tosses back the first part of the bottle in a truly heroic display. He pulls it away from his lips and lets out a belch. "Interesting," is all he says, before passing over his puzzle in return. It's an unremarkable piece of craftsmanship, except for the letters etched into the blocks at different angles.

Benford wonders if this is another of the portentious coincidences that have become unsettlingly common around Jack and Hel, or if this is truly just the odd traveller in an alpine meadow. He stuff the thought away for now. _Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar_, he thinks, and experimentally moves a few pieces. "When I was much younger," he says, repositioning a pyramidal section, "I had a Rubik's Cube. Have you ever seen one? My mother brought one home one day, and left it sitting on the kitchen counter."

"I've heard of such toys," Selber says, nodding. "Did you play much with it?"

"Quite a bit, yes," Benford answers. "I have to admit that at that age I wasn't the brightest person. It took quite some time to solve by twisting and turning. But then... I had a stroke of genius, a way to solve the puzzle within a few minutes every time." He grins. "I found that the coloured chips could be removed with a butter knife and replaced in whatever order necessary. That made it pretty easy to recover from unsolvable mistakes. My mother was quite amused." He frowns. "My father, less so. He had every respect for original thinking, but he was quick to remind me that sometimes you're not allowed to think outside the box. Or that you won't want to." He holds up the wooden puzzle, partially solved. "And so out of respect for that lesson, I consider it only fair to try things by the rules first."

"Sometimes it is you who are making the rules," Selber says, and gestures at the puzzle. Newton looks down, shocked to see that the letters on the completed portion spell out his name.

Benford sits shocked for a moment, and then rubs his forehead with his palm. "There was a time when there was such a thing as coincidence," he states simply, then continues to work on the puzzle. "What about you, then, Mister Selber? Did you know what you sought, coming to this meadow?"

"I sought to meet you. But I have been with you since your Exaltation," Selber replies with a smile.

Newton wakes with a start. The camp is still there, but it is night; he has been sleeping. Jack is nearby, half-asleep.

Benford hops to his feet, more than a little startled, and searches the area for Selber. There's no sign that he's been there, or that anyone else has, for that matter, but it's clearly hours later. He stares at Jack, somehow impeccably dressed even in the middle of an open field. "Did you see any of that?"

Jack jerks his head upright. He pulls a smoldering cigarette from where it hung in his lips to scrunch up his face and blink away weariness, then he focuses on Benford. "What?"

Benford says, "Selber? The old fellow with the puzzle box?" Benford explains quickly. "He said he came here to meet me, but that he'd been with me since my Exaltation." He frowns. "That doesn't make a lot of sense. I've been alone most of the time since my exaltation. Did he mean he was spying on me?"

Benford fishes around in his rucksack; the bottle of Hefeweizen is still there, unopened. "What the hell?" he says, uncharacteristically ruffled.

As he returns attention to Jack, Benford's eyes are drawn to the Sidereal's lap. There sits a partially-solved Rubik's cube - initial confusion is replaced with the knowledge that Jack brought it with him. A complete plane of yellow is visible on the side facing the scientist, but from what he can see of the others, they are muddled hopelessly. "Uh-huh," Jack replies, drawing Benford's gaze back up. The Chosen of Journeys settles back into his chair, apparently relaxed, and takes a puff on what's left of his cigarette. "Curious."

In place of a campfire, Benford has brought a Coleman lantern, which he now lights before settling slowly into his camp chair. The soft hiss and bright glow of the machine is a comfort to him - mechanical, predictable. Simple. "So he wasn't here. Not physically, anyway. That makes him a dream... or a ghost." He sighs. "That bothers me. I liked my universe ordered. What about you, Jack? Does it bother you that we're running into spooks and mystics?"

"It takes some getting used to," Jack admits. "But certainly makes life that much more interesting." He shrugs. "I'm no scientist, and my world wasn't all that ordered before this." The Exaltation. "So I have it easier than you." And conveyed in this is the impression of a life taken as it comes.

Benford nods, slowly. "Maybe my expectations of order are too high, then. Still... anything like that happen to you lately?"

"Not yet," Jack murmurs. His gaze is elsewhere, staring off into the night and towards the ghostly silhouettes of trees in the distance. "Would you give it all away? Make it never so?" the tone is casual, but something about the question carries weight.

Benford thinks for a long moment, before answering. "No," he finally says. "I don't know why... yet. I do know that this is the way it has to be... so far, at least." Another pause. "Or whatever way things have to be, we'll make it that way. It amounts to the same thing."

"Then you have the heart of an Exalt," Jack declares, and it is obvious that this is the response he expected. "And certainly so. Without it, you wouldn't be one. But perhaps your mind still needs to catch up a little." He shrugs. "I think we all need to do some catching up. Just in different ways."

Benford fishes two bottles of the wheat beer out of his bag and offers one to Jack. "Let's have a drink, then." He pops the tops with a blade from his Swiss army knife. "A drink to the simple times, when we get a chance to catch up."

A grin crosses Jack's face as he takes the bottle. "I'll drink to that."

---

Newton is shaken awake. The sun is nearly done setting, but he can still see Selber's face illuminated by the fading rays. The dark-haired man is hunched over his sleeping bag, grinning. "Wake up, or you'll miss it," he says.

Benford jumps up, wild-eyed, and springs a few feet away from the old man. Benford's absurdly dressed in sweatpants and a t-shirt, and barefoot, but he hardly notices. He stares and Selber, and stammers. "Who... what... am I dreaming?"

"'Course ya are," the man replies with a lopsided smile. "You don't think crazy travelers who know your name will come knocking about while you're awake, do you?"

Benford is somehow reassured by that statement. _I'm being mocked by a dream. I take myself way too seriously._ "It's hard to tell sometimes," he says. "Nothing is coincidence, lately. Like you said... I'm making the rules around me, whether I know it or not."

"Come on, we'll miss it!" Selber has already turned and is jogging clumsily for the nearby lake.

Benford pulls on a pair of slippers, and jogs after Selber. It's easy to keep up with him, after all the physical training of the past few months. He totally forgets to say anything to Jack, who dozes serenely in a camp chair. "Miss what?" he calls.

"Thiss.." Selber has stopped at the edge of the water, and as Newton approaches, he grabs the other man by the arm and tugs him forward, to lean over the edge of the lake. In the rays of the setting sun, Newton can see only one reflection in the water - Selber's face, perhaps younger-seeming. He stops a moment, realizing that he is looking straight down at what ought to be his own reflection, and there is no second face in spite of the man's presence beside him. When he looks to the reflected image of his face, all he sees is Selber.

Benford presses his eyes shut, and opens them again, then glances back at Selber... who is still there, grinning like the lunatic Benford mistook him for. "OK. Not every puzzle has a solution... and you're not necessarily a puzzle. But... are we the same person? Which part of you am I? Or which part of me are you?"

"You ask questions you don't want answers to," Selber says, calmly. He produces the puzzle, extending it again. Looking down, Benford sees other characters inscribed on the blocks. He recognizes his own name. Do the remaining symbols spell other words? Other names?

Benford accepts the puzzle again. "Everything I am is to find answers to questions, whether I like them or not. Solutions to the largest puzzles." He reaches to move a piece, and stops. _This is not how I solved the Rubik's Cube. I can't pry off the chips. But if I study the symbols instead of the puzzle, maybe I can find the order of the words without the order of the device._ "And what of you? Do dreams have aspirations of their own? Is there some goal I can help you to reach?" His attention is still on Selber, but he's preparing to memorize the marks on the cube - or at least try to.

"My aspirations are gone." Selber's voice grows calmer still, but not wistful or bitter. "I had my life. Now you have yours. And 'I' - this memory you speak to - is my final gift to you, my successor."

Benford prods a few pieces on the box, and picks out letters spelling another name: Selber. He's silent for a moment, then he looks back at Selber. "I understand. Thank you. I promise you that I'll do what I can. But you know that's what we always do." It's not a question.

Selber smiles at the puzzle. "'Selber' is a German word for 'yourselves'. You'll remember that when you wake up. You'll learn my name, and meet my colleagues, in due course. But nobody said you couldn't pry the colored squares off, one more time." And with a smile, he and the dream are gone.
