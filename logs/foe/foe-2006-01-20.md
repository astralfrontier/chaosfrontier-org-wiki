Morgan laughs briefly. "Heh. She's following fate again," he remarks. He's only known Mary for a few days, so this is _still_ quite strange to him - but he's also always been of the opinion that if you go around saying "that's weird" all the time, you'll never get anything done. This has proven even more than usually important since his entire life went weird.

"Hmph," mutters Jet. She slips offer her bike, tugging out the key with a grimace. She looks to Becca and considers for a moment. "I think it's probably safest to stay here." Fate so far hasn't seemed to be the best guide when it comes to peaceful meetings.

The King's Table is mostly deserted. Mary is talking over her shoulder again, directing it mostly at Morgan. "Anyway, when we get there, I want to make sure that your article made it into the newspaper. It seemed important somehow, and I think.." The motion is almost too fast to catch, but the woman has slipped her hands into the belt of a man standing in line near the cash register, and come out with something. "...it's important to follow up."

Morgan blinks, still not certain what he saw. "If you say so," he says, skeptically. Normally he'd be quite enthusiastic about anyone taking an interest in his work, but right now he's starting to wonder what kind of company he's keeping these days. It's one thing to report on those who live on the other side of the law - but something else entirely to work with them.

Jet notices the little move with a smirk. She's lifted hundreds of times, and it's always nice to see someone who is skilled in the craft. "Full of surprises, full of suprises," she murmurs quietly.

Anything Mary might have said further is drowned out by a shout, which triggers screaming: "Hands up! This is a stick-up!" The man Mary passed has drawn a pistol and is aiming it with two shaky hands at the cashier, whose face abruptly drains of color.

Jet smirks to herself. Then she notices the gun. What the hell? Then it clicks. It's time to cover some tracks, it seems. "Mary? Does Fate say I can kill this man now that he's served his purpose?"

"Fate doesn't dictate your actions," Mary says quietly, flashing the small pistol she palmed from the gunman for a moment. "Your nature dictates Fate."

Morgan jumps sharply away - he's gotten to be a little more nervous around guns than he'd used to be. And then he takes in the brief exchange between Mary and Jet, and relaxes a little. He slowly takes a few paces away from the two, while making a point of obviously keeping his hands to himself; aloud, he says, "Mister, I think you're making a big mistake..."

"Bad luck, pal," says Jet more loudly. She knows the look of a rookie. Hitting a restaurant of all things? Pathetic. Naturally he's going to spin around to face her. The thing is, he moves naturally, and his nature is nothing compared to that of the Lunar. Jet lunges for the arm handling the weapon, waiting for the precise moment when it's aimed at no one. Her fingers dig into his flesh with a force unlike anything he's likely experienced. At the same time, the biker slams her head into the gunman's face, shattering his nose and slamming him back towards the register. Releasing his arm frees her hands and both are pulled back, then slammed forward right into the disarmed man's solar plexus, putting him to the floor in the space of a few racing heartbeats.

Morgan shakes his head and sighs, stepping forward and kicking the gun lightly in Mary's direction. "Such a shame..." he says, shaking his head. "I think we should have a talk with him - make sure he doesn't get a chance to get good at this sort of thing." The shaky hands didn't escape his notice; this would-be gunman was desperate, and he wants to know why before tossing him to the police to sort it out.

Jet stands ready for a moment, waiting to see if he has any kick left. It's quite unnecessary in this case, which she sees in a few moments. "Better get him to a hospital. He probably has a concussion." She reaches out to grab a napkin, wiping blood from her forehead, "And a broken nose. He ought to live, though. I think."

Mary extracts a leather wallet from one pocket and flashes the badge within it about quickly - a little too quickly, Jet notes, though the restaurant patrons don't seem to notice. "It's taken care of, folks. Andrew, can you take some quick statements while we book him?"

Morgan hardly misses a beat. "Sure," he says, pulling out the ever-present notebook and pencil. He's interviewed enough cops, and watched enough arrests, to do a passable job of asking a few quick 'had you seen this man before today' type questions. He learns from Mary's example too - keep it short and sweet, talk quickly, and don't give people a chance to wonder if maybe all isn't as it seems. Accordingly, his 'statements' are taken and complete even before the door has shut behind Mary. "Thank you very much, sir," he says to the cashier. "Take care of yourselves." And with that, he too departs.

The would-be robber has been hauled out to Mary's truck. Becca is waiting out there, and looks apprehensive about this turn of events. Morgan follows shortly. "We'll drive him to the hospital, then leave," Mary decides.

Jet shakes her head and says to Becca, "We are going to get you some better clothes so you can ride with me." She wants to give the girl something to look forward to, and to take her mind off this little oddity. "You know, you guide us in pretty interesting directions, Mary," notes Jet. "I just hope that something of use comes of this."

"Me, I hope he comes round," says Morgan. "I wonder what's gone wrong in his life that he felt the need to do that. He's never done it before, I'm sure you both saw that."

"Very sloppy work," agrees Jet. "Probably got backed in a corner. Horrible mark, too. Restaurants never have enough. Better to hit some..." She pauses and looks to Mary thoughtfully. "Better to pick on someone with money, rather than a place scraping by with less than $100 in cash on site."

Mary says nothing. Only after the truck has stopped by the hospital and deposited the man out front does Mary speak, for she clearly has no desire to be questioned.

"Is Becca of use to you, Jet?" she finally asks.

"Absolutely," says Jet. "It is not something I can easily express, but part of me.. needs to care for others." She smiles at Becca and says, "I imagine she has a lot of useful talents, as well, but that is not really why I wanted her to come with us. It is perhaps a selfish thing, to want to find some measure of greater purpose in teaching another, but I believe I will give back enough to make an adequate apology."

"Well, keeping people from getting shot is of use to me," Mary replies. "My gun has no bullets. He'll get a lighter sentence this way." But she says no more. The truck drives on.

---

Evening. Past San Rafael, Mary slips onto I-580. San Francisco is brilliant now that the sun has set, but the woman does not stop to sightsee as she has done earlier. This close to their goal, she dares do nothing that will interfere.

"Too bad we can't slip off to see Angel Island," murmurs Becca softly. She stares out to the west, shuffling that off into things to ask of Jet later. She's still debating what to make of Jet's answer, but being useful in some way seems good to her. Naturally jet is saying nothing, riding her bike with a solemn, serious expression that hides her emotions like a cloak.

It is 10:30 when the little convoy finally comes to a stop. The building is a medium-sized apartment complex, with a pair of compact satellite dishes bolted to balconies. Mary parks the truck out front, and gestures for Jet to pull in next to her. She hops out and walks quickly for one of the apartments. "We're here," she announces.

Although he doesn't say anything about it, Morgan's starting to get a little excited. Finally he's going to get to learn a little something about what happened to him that night, when the Sun came out in the middle of the night. He gets out of the truck in silence and follows Mary inside.

She doesn't even need to touch the door-handle; the door opens for her. Barry is inside, and smiles casually. "Come in, come in all. I've got coffee brewing."

Jet parks her bike, looking it over carefully before moving to join the others. She stays near Becca, clearly protective of the girl. She looks at Barry closely, her expression more stony than normal. She hopes that this meeting doesn't leave Mary so upset. She'll be very unamused if that happens again.

"Coffee!" grins Morgan. "Sweet elixir of life." He gratefully accepts a cup, then leans against the wall. "Good to see you again," he says to Barry, conversationally.

The apartment is a relic of the 1960's in architecture, although its furnishings are modern enough. Connecting doors seem to lead to other apartments, making this a higher class commune. Barry is the only person here, although several computers and laptops are set out around the apartment, and he has several telephones.

Jet looks around the apartment with an arched eyebrow. Becca just stays quiet, having no idea what the heck is going on here. "I'll take some coffee," she says casually. "It goes well with information exchanges, I've found. Unless you have something a bit harder. That goes better still."

"I'm glad you all made it." Barry takes a seat with his own coffee mug, and Mary joins him on a nearby recliner. "This is my apartment, and I've prepared private areas for each of you in the complex. I'll give you keys that will let you into any room in the complex, except for private areas."

"As for information exchanges, at this point I know enough to be comfortable. I'd like to help you understand us and what we do. Where would you like to begin?"

"Well... where I'd like to begin is to learn about where to begin," says Morgan, smiling. "I know that the Unconquered Sun spoke to me, telling me that I need to let my light shine... but I'm still trying to figure out what that means."

"I feel _different_ now, that is true," continues Morgan. "But I can't fight like Jet here, or even Mary. There's got to be something more to it than that..."

Barry smiles. "What does fighting mean to you as a journalist?"

Morgan laughs. "Something I avoid as much as possible," he answers. "Fighting doesn't ask questions, nor answer them. In fact, it can make it harder to get answers - it's hard to answer questions when you're out cold, or worse."

Barry shakes his head. "That answers my question. In this discussion, you're talking about fisticuffs, knives, guns, barroom brawls. I'd like to invite you to look at the larger picture. What is 'fighting' - really?"

Morgan furrows his brow. "You're asking about more than the mechanics," he says slowly, pacing around the room. After a while, he says, "Fighting... is getting what you want, or not getting what you don't want, through violence."

"Not precisely," says Jet. "I would say fighting is the exertion of skill to achieve your aims while others who are opposed do the same." She smiles and notes, "Not all wars involve the standard definitions of violence. You should know the power of words, and they can have an enormous influence without being violent."

Morgan tilts his head. "I... hm, you have a point. I cover all sorts of things that are called 'fights', like the big Alito confirmation fight a couple years ago, and as far as I know, no one even came to blows."

"There are many conflicts where non-violence has bested violence," says Jet softly. "A man named Martin Luther King demonstrated that quite well, don't you agree?" She look seriously to Barry, then. "I am curious about a few things, but I have a feeling you can't tell me much about the Silver Lady."

Barry smiles. "I have heard the name. I know little else, personally. I'll introduce you to Meyer, though. He's dealt with the Lunar Exalted."

Morgan rubs his chin. "All right. I guess that's a start. I'm not good with my fists, but I'm good with the turn of a phrase. And now... now I'm even better. That article I wrote... it's as good as I've ever written. And it was... almost effortless."

Barry nods. "A fist to the face will make many bad situations worse. But yes, there are other ways to fight. Your approach will save the lives of your friends, mark my words."

Jet looks thoughtfully from Becca to Barry. She's paying attention, but she already had a feeling that Morgan's talents must be something special. Sadly, it's rather beyond her to truly grasp all the subtleties of his talent, but she knows when words move her. "Even to someone as uniformed as I am it seemed remarkable," she says sincerely.

Barry smiles amiably. "The Chosen aren't given their power for their good looks, Mr. Morgan. What you have is important enough to make you one of roughly two hundred such people on this entire planet."

That is enough to make Morgan pause. "Two hundred... on the entire planet..." he says, slowly. He knew he was good at what he did, but _this_... this is something else entirely. "That's... not very many."

Barry sets his coffee mug down, and ticks off items on his fingers. "Julius Caesar. Martin Luther King, who has been named. Mohandas Gandhi. Alexander the Great. Leaders in war and peace. Isaac Newton. Albert Einstein. Joan of Arc. Mother Teresa. Geniuses and leaders. These people have something in common: great personal power, force, drive, and ability."

"You don't mean to imply that they were like we are, do you?" asks Jet. That would be.. fascinating. "Though they had great talent, there have been no reports of them that seem precisely supernatural."

Barry shakes his head. "It is more that.. people who would become them in the fullness of time are Chosen."

Morgan scratches his head. "They were _not_ Chosen, then? Why not"

"Because there were no Chosen before the 1990s." This is Mary, speaking up. "Perhaps earlier, perhaps later." She glances at Barry, who says nothing but nods approvingly, and continues. "Because something, something at that time, changed about the world. The Chosen could be found here."

"What change would that be?" asks Jet. "And what would bring it about? Have we been created by something alien, then?" She would normally snort at such an absurd thought. It's hard to do that when you've been saved from death by a Silver Lady that no one else seemed capable of seeing..

Morgan nods slowly. "I suppose that makes as much sense as anything else that's happened to me this week, at least." He is quiet for a while, sipping his coffee as he digests all this.

Barry speaks again. "The Chosen are warriors. Soldiers. Weapons of the gods. Born to fight, lead, and rule. Whether it's to mobilize the un-Exalted human race behind their cause, or to go toe-to-toe against an enemy, the Exalted are meant to be at the forefront of the fight. The logical conclusion is that there's now an enemy worth fighting, that needs our power."

"But what enemy would that be?" asks Jet. "Is this someone who hasn't arrived yet? Or are they concealed from our eyes?" She stretches and looks more focused now. If she has an enemy to fight, she's going to know everything about it that she can.

Barry reaches for one of the laptops sitting on the coffee-table. He begins typing, humming a tune all the while. Once finished, he slides the laptop over for Morgan's inspection, and Jet's.

What is shown on the screen is a slideshow of pictures. One after another, it depicts a man in a long coat. He wears sunglasses, and in every picture his face seems to have the same relaxed expression.

"This man doesn't exist. He isn't human," says Barry calmly.

"What is he then?" asks Jet seriously. "And what are we supposed to do about him?" The latter, to her, is the more important question right now.

"If he doesn't exist, why are there pictures of him?" asks Morgan, aware that he's probably being a little difficult - but Jet already asked all the other questions.

"We don't know what to call him yet. But he has no fingerprints. His photo does not appear in any government or law-enforcement database. We've scoured one site he was at, and there was absolutely no forensic evidence available."

Morgan's brow furrows. "And you - we are Exalted, and yet they could hide the traces of his presence from us? That _is_ worrying."

"Yes. If presence, then certainly also motive." Barry pulls the laptop back and closes the display. The other teams have reported similar individuals in their zones. Where do they come from? Nobody knows."

"This much is clear. They are developing connections with arms dealers world-wide."

"War is coming," says Jet quietly. "That makes sense. If others like myself have been raised, it can only be for that reason." She flexes her hands, cracking her knuckles, "We had best do all we can to prepare for them. The question remains, however.. who will they arm? Can these non-entities lead men in combat? Do they have their own forces hidden somewhere?"

Morgan rubs his chin, frowning grimly. "It won't be easy to track them even through their intermediaries. Arms dealers are a close-mouthed bunch. They take customer privacy _very_ seriously."

"And now you see the power of a man who can persuade anyone of anything." Barry smiles blandly.

Morgan grins. "I didn't say _impossible_, did I? I just said it wasn't _easy_."

"That is something that history has shown us many times," responds Jet. "But yes, I think if we are the Chosen, we will, in one way or another, prove up to this challenge. I imagine there are many who are trying to learn the nature of this new comer? Can we even be sure that they are our enemies?"

Barry shakes his head. "We are not sure. But it's the only unexplained thing we've seen, aside from ourselves. And they are ahh, 'interesting' enough to investigate anyway, yes?"

"And whoever they are, _they_ are preparing for war," agrees Morgan. "It makes sense for us to do the same, whether our world is their target or not."

"I think that goes without saying," agrees the Lunar. "Still, there might be some hope of preventing a conflict." Perhaps a curious thing for a Full Moon to say. "Or of delaying them while we prepare. What kind of arms are they securing, though?"

"That's not clear. They may in fact be _selling_," says Barry quietly.

"Still worth following up on, even so," remarks Morgan.

"If they are selling, they may be trying to encourage chaos and conflict," suggests Jet. "It's a good way to disrupt delicate balances of power in gangs. Get them to destroy each other when they think they have a leg up, then move in when both are decimated."

"In fact, it's almost time for our conference call," says Barry. "It's morning in Switzerland." He stands and moves to one of the desktop systems, setting his coffee mug down as he goes. A few keyclicks and mouse gestures wake up the system and start a video window on the screen. He uncoils a camera, which snaps onto the side of the monitor.

A face appears on the screen, and blinking the sleep from his eyes is a darkly-clothed Sidereal, his identity given away by yellow irises. Smoke drifts intermittently over the screen from the cigarette he is puffing upon.

"Good morning Geneva!" calls Barry, smiling.

"You're unnaturally cheery," the face comments dryly, lifting into view a large mug of coffee and swapping it with the cigarette. "What's news?"

Barry gestures behind him, and gets out of the view. "Sun and Moon, my friend, Sun and Moon. Both North American."

The Sidereal nods. "This is Jack. Care to introduce yourselves?"

"Andrew Morgan," says the Eclipse. "Journalist and chosen of the Sun."

"The name is Jet," comes the answer of the Full Moon. "Nice to meet you, Jack," she adds more warmly. "Full Moon Lunar," she adds, the words almost an afterthought. She turns to the other girl, "This is my friend Becca." The girl jumps a bit as she is spoken to, waving a little and offering a shy smile. "So, Geneva, huh? What's going on?"

Barry begins to speak, but is interrupted by a loud "SHIT!" and a thump against one of the connecting doors. The door bursts open and a short man, bespectacled, almost falls into the room, panting. "Sorry! Sorry!" He rubs his short hair with a hand; his fingers are long and distinct. Barry smiles placidly, the very mask of acceptance. "Jet, Mr. Morgan, this is our third associate here, Meyer."

On-screen, Jack nods to the assembled Exalts after Meyer has calmed down. "Andrew, Jet. Welcome to the Celestial ranks," he says in a difficult-to-place accent. "Expect a lot of early mornings."

Barry chuckles. "Jack, is your physicist in?"

"Benford? Not at the moment," the Chosen of Journeys replies. "Something you need to tell him?"

Barry nods. "We've been tasked with something we call Operation Greenspan. What he's been working on is important. And with Mr. Morgan here, we may have found the perfect weapon to finish it. Just let him know that we may have a use for his invention soon."

Jack runs a hand through his messy brown hair, and nods. "I'm sure he'll be characteristically overjoyed," the Exalt replies slowly. It's difficult to tell how serious he is.

"Alright. Give Hel my best," says Barry, saluting smartly. He terminates the connection and turns. "Ladies and gentleman, this is Meyer. Meyer, some introduction?" The other man laughs quietly. "I'm the financial whiz here, you might say. I do some intelligence work, I play a mean game of Solitaire, and ah, I _used_ to be Jewish." He adds this last bit with a brief glimmer of the Caste Mark on his brow.

"Meyer's here to help us with Operation Greenspan. We're going to start into the planning stages." Barry gestures at the doors. "For now, you've got plenty to think about. Let's all get some rest. Oh, and.. pleasant dreams."
