It's the first week in February, and it's snowing in Geneva. Jack and Benford are on top of the old bank building where Benford first met Hel. A few inches of accumulation cover the roof, while fat, fluffy flakes drift lazily down from a cloud cover that arches over the city like a second cieling, less than a thousand feet overhead. The steel fire door bangs shut behind the two men as they step outside.

The glowing end of the cigarette in Jack's mouth races upwards as he takes a long drag. "Exaltation lends great power and potential," he begins, stating nothing unknown, "to those who already have it in some measure." He drops his cigarette, hissing, into the snow, and shrugs free his jacket, draping it over a nearby banister. "Thanks to this, you will find yourself, untrained as you are, a formidable adversary for many unExalted opponents. That is not enough." The man's tie follows suit, stored on the railing.

Benford glances around at the snow on the roof, and unzips his flimsy windbreaker. He doesn't look to certain about this. "A month ago I was in a wheelchair." He folds the jacket over a railing. "I don't know anything about fighting. How could I defeat anyone?"

"Magic," Jack replies with a half-grin. "You might not know it, but your body is ready to learn any task set before it. If a man strikes you, you will know something of how to strike back. That can be improved upon."

"Ideally, your training would be thorough and prolonged. But we don't have the luxury of knowing how much time we have, so this will be the crash course. Just as martial technological advance is sped by warfare, so is increased personal fighting prowess sped by conflict." As he speaks, Jack slowly rolls up the sleeves of his shirt.

Benford takes a few steps out in the snow, and turns to face Jack. "I get it. This is going to be a hands-on demonstration."

The Sidereal's reply is simple; he removes his yellow-tinted glasses and sets them down carefully. "When you're ready, Newton."

Benford takes a deep breath and releases it, focussing his attention on Jack. It seems as good a way to begin as any. But then what to do next? He raises his fists... _It's not like a particle problem... or is it? There's energy, and vectors, and collisions.._ He steps forward and takes an experimental jab at Jack's chest.

As Benford's fist sails in, Jack slides a foot back and raises both hands. He arcs one downwards, slapping the blow aside easily.

"You can do better than that, Newton," Jack declares. "Again!"

Benford takes another swing at Jack, with the other hand, and meets a slap from Jack's other arm.

Twisting Benford's striking arm away, Jack slides to one side - and raises his leg, pushing it out at the scientist's exposed flank.

The attack connects, but snaps against Benford's side only briefly. Jack's restraint is obvious, and he rests the foot down to step away.

"You can do better," Jack repeats, lunging forward. Open-handed strikes fly out at Benford, pressing him to defend.

Jack launches a flurry of countering jabs that takes Benford by surprise. The scientist, to his own surprise, ducks out of the way of the first quite easily, but winces as he catches the second on his arm. The third blow lands squarely in the middle of his chest. He lands badly on his backside, mashing the snow underneath him.

Jack nods approvingly. "Good movement." He takes a few steps away. "Well, at first," the Sidereal finishes wryly.

Benford stands up and huffs once, heavily. He'll feel that bruise tomorrow, and he knows that if Jack were serious he'd be battered, or dead. _It's still a ballistics problem... but it's also a poker game._ This time he tries a some serious jabs at Jack's midsection, but is on guard for whatever blow comes back.

Jack leans to one side as Benford comes to strike out at him, and neatly grabs the man's extended arm with one hand. "Faster, Benford," he chides, fingers clenching tight.

And then Jack's feet clear the ground, as he deftly tugs Benford's arm forwards - throwing his balance askew - and vaults _over_ the Twilight, bringing a fist into the small of his back.

Benford collapses to his knees with a shout, feeling his back go numb. For a horrified moment he can't feel his legs. _No! Not again!_ And then his vision is briefly suffused by a golden haze, and a fire races through his nerves. His back is sore, and his feet are tingling, but he can feel his legs again. He jumps back to his feet and spins to face Jack.

Jack blinks in momentary bewilderment, then smiles. "Good, again." And he holds his stance, letting Benford set the pace.

Benford crouches and sweeps a leg through the air where Jack's legs were just a moment ago. The Sidereal's jump left him just out of reach, and Benford's fear left him a bit too slow.

Jack lands lightly beside Benford and lashes his hands out at the scientist's limbs, attempting to entangle and impede them.

And the Sidereal latches on. He twists, and the two roll to the floor, shifting grips and levering weight to restrict each other's movement and place pressure on joints. Jack quickly gains dominance, rolling Benford onto his back and locking his arms together painfully.

Pinned beneath Jack, Benford struggles, but to no avail. The man has him held tight. "Yield?" Jack asks in a lighthearted tone.

Benford grinds his teeth, arms locked. _But what did I expect?_ "Yes...", he says. "For today."

The Sidereal's response is to spring lightly from Benford's back, alighting on his feet beside him. "That went well," he says, rolling one shoulder to chase away stiffness, then offering a hand to the prone man.

Benford takes the proffered hand, half-expecting Jack to flip him again, and staggers to his feet. "It did?", he asks, with genuine bafflement.

"Of course," is the reply, thrown over Jack's shoulder as he returns to his jacket. "You learnt, I taught. And you did better than I expected, for an academic who only recently left his wheelchair-bound existence." He shrugs. "You'll get better. Because you get to do this all over again, tomorrow."

Benford dusts the snow off. All he can say, after several long moments, is "Yes."
