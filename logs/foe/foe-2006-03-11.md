# Fall of Eden 2006-03-11

Jet's had a lot thrust on her in the past few weeks. Still, she has many questions. She wants to know more about herself, and she wants to understand things. She's rarely been the kind to worry about such 'deep' thinking, but her life has changed to much she needs to get a grip on what has happened, exactly. She doesn't really trust this new house that much, but she feels she can rely on Mary to be honest enough with her. She also thinks that Mary is perhaps normal enough to be straight with her, as well.

When Jet reaches Mary, she is fortunately not busy with something else. If anything, Mary seems to almost have been expecting her. "I need some more answers," the Lunar says quickly. "You have a minute? I know we're not really alike, but I'm hoping someone can help me sort this all out. I need to really get to know what I am. What it means to be what I am."

Mary opens the mini-fridge in one corner of her room and pulls out a pair of beer cans, extending one in welcome. "I'll do what I can," she offers.

Jet accepts the can and opens it absently. "Becca looks up to me," she says suddenly. "I mean she really idolizes me. She's young, I know, and I know I've changed a lot, but I want to understand.. A year ago, there's no way I'd have tried to pick-up a girl I've never met. At least not like this. It's complicated." The Full Moon is clearly frustrated by her words, and is defying her nature by trying to wrap them up in subtleties. "Is it natural for me to be more.. I don't know, like an animal in these things? Part of me sees her as a child I must protect and care for, and part of me sees her as.. I don't know. I can't find the right word. It feels as if I am her mother, sister, and lover all at the same time, I guess."

"You're the first... of your kind I really have got to know," Mary confesses quietly. She pulls the tab back and takes a drink of beer. Her eyes are focused on Jet, contemplative but not fearful. At least that is something. "You met a Sidereal and a Lunar together, right? Did they tell you anything?"

"Very little," replies Jet. "They were rather busy it seemed, and wasted little time. They gave me the tattoos, but I had little time to get detailed answers. My best guess is that it somehow ties to the Silver Lady. Just like everything else surrounding my changes. I hadn't met Becca yet then, and was just running aimlessly at that time. I don't know how to seek out those who are like me, and part of me quite honestly thinks that'd it would be very hard to be around others like me. I don't think it matters if that makes sense or not. I have to accept things as they are."

Mary nods slowly. "If you have to accept, then... there is no answer I can really give you, is there? None that'd make any difference?"

"I suppose that you might say that," replies Jet. "Yet part of me thinks that knowing is worthwhile. Is this what I was chosen to do? To gather those I can protect and to be.. I don't know, almost a goddess to them? I say this because I know that I'm going to actively look for more. So long as I can support them, I think I'll keep looking." She laughs softly and takes a deep drink, "I don't honestly know where I'm going to keep more of them, but I'm sure we'll figure it out before it becomes too troublesome."

Mary smiles. "Jet.. Each of us was Chosen to do, as far as I can tell, and as far as I have ever felt myself.." She stops, struggling for words to articulate an important feeling. ".. we're chosen to do what.. what we _would have done_."

"So you are suggesting I just follow my instincts?" asks Jet. "What is it like for you, Mary? Take that hold-up, for example. Was that you just doing what you felt? Will I have impulses like that as well? I know we aren't the same. I guess I don't really know what the differences are."

The woman shakes her head, and takes another drink of beer to buy herself time. At length she speaks. "I feel... I feel things, but I don't know where they come from. I feel impulses. Like anger. Fear. Umm. I have thoughts, or ideas. Memories come to me." She's clearly struggling. "Like... I remember how heavy something was to carry, all of a sudden, like from my childhood, and I'll know there'll be some lifting involved."

"That's really strange I imagine," says Jet softly. "For me I just.. I don't know. It seems like I just do what I want, I guess. It's almost like complete cockiness. It's the kind of swagger I used to have dealing with hoods back in.. back where I came from." She doesn't like to talk to much about that, it seems. "But somehow it's more geniune. It's not just to show off. This is going to sound foolish, I am afraid. I want to impress Her."

Mary smiles gently. "If that's important to you.. then who I am to question it? I can't say I feel the same way about the.. woman.. who Exalted me. I don't really know _how_ I feel about her. But I believe in what she stands for."

"What was the woman like?" asks Jet. "I imagine she must not be much like the Silver Lady. It was obvious from the moment I saw her what I wanted." She doesn't bother elaborating on that right now, though. She is more interested in what Mary has to say.

Mary scratches her chin for a moment and takes a final drink. "Desire is a part of it, I guess. Venus, Maiden of Serenity.. She's... everything she is, everything she does, is about gratification, satisfaction, or peace. Of some kind. No, not peace. Contentment."

"Sounds pretty nice to me," replies Jet. "A little contentment can go a long way." Not that Jet has ever really demonstrated any signs of contentment recently. "So there really is a Venus, then? A Goddess of Love, hmm? So what does that mean for you?" The Lunar studies Mary with an appraising eye. "You don't seem to have the whole bow and arrow thing going on," she says, teasing just a little.

"I'm... I'm not about romantic love. I pursue other forms of gratification." Mary doesn't seem particularly willing to talk further, and her face registers her discomfort.

"It's alright," assures Jet. She can read people as well as anyone, and she reaches out to pat the woman's shoulder. "We all have our delicate spots. Sorry to touch on one of yours so clumsily." She turns her attention to other things quickly enough, "So is it okay for us to leave the house and take a look around? Do you have a cover story for this place, or do I just make up my own if I need to?"

"I'll make a phone call. Someone will come pick you up at the door."

"Come pick me up?" asks Jet. "You mean I'm not supposed to ride any more?" She takes another drink and stares down at the can, "I need to go buy some things for Becca. I promised to get her some clothes so she can ride with me. She seems really eager. Oh, I don't suppose anyone around here knows a good mechanic? I think my bike could use a bit of maintenance. Maybe even a little touch-up in other ways, as well. I'd like to get a nitris kit installed." It's clear the Lunar's mind is wandering. Something is distracting her.

Mary smiles lopsidedly. "You can ride. Just go this way for today, okay?"

"Another impulse," murmurs Jet. "I'll trust your instincts.. because mine tell me to do so." She rises smoothly and finishes her beer. "I think I've decided that I like you, Mary." She adds with a smirk, "I don't think it'd be right to try to take you in like Becca, though. Mm, but I imagine we could have a lot of fun." The Lunar winks teasingly and slips off to head to the door. She's obviously enjoying herself.

---

The knock at the door comes within half an hour. Jet hasn't seen anyone else in the house, and upon answering, finds a woman waiting for her. Night-black straight hair hangs nearly to her waist, while dusky sun-kissed skin reflects life in sunny California. Her clothing is a mixture of feminine allure and masculine power. Blouse and skirt set off her curves, while gold jewelry more common on high-powered execs, and a high-powered business tie on her neck, balance her image.

"My name's White Rabbit," the woman says by way of introduction, extending a hand. She winks. "I was told I'd be meeting a new playmate."

Jet can't help but look her over. The Lunar in her is not just about war and strife, but has a very strong interest in the sensual. She reaches out to accept the hand, but rather than shake it, she roguishly cups it and bows over to press her lips to it. "It's a pleasure to meet you, White Rabbit. I take it you are a friend of Mary's?" Jet can't help but wonder if she's been sent a distraction. Still, there's something to this woman that makes the Lunar strongly suspect that this beautiful woman is far more than just eye candy.

"Don't know who you're talking about, honey, it doesn't work like that," says White Rabbit, smiling the smile of a woman who has said these words dozens of times before. "We're just going to go for a ride." She gestures behind her to her car - a sleek black 2007 Lanta - and begins walking, hips swinging as she goes.

Jet raises an eyebrow. "Well, I'm sure wherever we are meaning to go, the ride will be more than half the fun," answers Jet. She'll follow along, adding rather lazily, "Oh, the name's Jet. I don't suppose you are going to explain anything more?"

The car's engine purrs itself to life and White Rabbit wriggles her way into the body-hugging driver's seat. As Jet climbs in, she glances over and smiles. "Spoilsport," she pouts, then grins. "Well, Jet, I've been asked through my 'network' to give you a tour of the town. Introduce you to people who are in the game, so to speak." She glances over her shoulder at the empty back seat of the two-door sportscar. "I've got some deliveries to make too. Don't worry - you aren't playing that game with me. Not today."

"Mmm, well, maybe we can play a few other fun games sometime soon," replies Jet. She can't help but tease with this woman. "It's always good to know who calls and who answers," says Jet. "I haven't really scouted much turf this far away from my own haunts. I have a feeling the games are all the same, though."

The car has taken off, and the woman is expertly navigating the streets at a perfectly safe speed. "Then you'll fit right in."

---

White Rabbit has shown Jet almost a dozen buildings - businesses, mostly, along with one warehouse and a large private mansion - which she has identified as part of 'her network'. "Anyone here can find me. And they'll trust you, since I trust you. You're hip." Elsewhere in town, the woman has stopped her car and retrieved plain brown-wrapped packages from her trunk, making her 'deliveries'.

Jet makes a point of not asking too many questions. Deliveries always fascinate her, though, as do territories. She's very sensitive to that now. "I imagine you know a way for an enterprising young woman to make a buck or two, as well?" She's not really sure just how to react. She's following the White Rabbit, after all. This is quite surreal.

"So, you're looking for business, not just pleasure, mmm?" White Rabbit is driving just as casually, still confining herself to the less-traveled roads. Jet recognizes what she's doing: her circuitous route bypasses the traffic cameras which monitor congestion. "What are you good at?"

"Getting in and out of places that I'm not supposed to be," answers Jet. "And I tend to look for both business and pleasure. If you are doing the right thing, you should be able to both enjoy it and profit, don't you agree?" She smirks at her driver and suggests, "If all you wanted to do was have a good time, we wouldn't have really needed to leave the house, right? I hardly want to hold back and lay low anyway. I want to keep my skills sharp."

"Let's try you out then, honey," winks White Rabbit. Then her voice grows more serious - all business. "You'll do my next delivery. In, out, nobody sees you. If you make it, you're in all the way. If you don't, you don't know me, and I sure as hell don't know you."

"Heh, sounds fair enough," says Jet. "You name the place, I'll see it gets done." She knows better than to ask just what she's dropping off, or who exactly she's working for. "I just hope that there's some good money in this game out here. You know how it is. None of us work for charity."

"I break all my costs down," the woman says calmly. "You'll get the cut of delivery." She gestures at the glove compartment. Jet opens it, finding a map of the bus lines inside. "You'll take the bus. No vehicles with license plates. No security areas. You'll be carrying a backpack. The address will be on the package inside. Get there, get back, report to one of the places we drove past earlier, and ask for me. Understand?"

"Works for me," says Jet. She smirks and wonders just what she's got that is so very hot. Not that it matters much, but she's always a bit curious. "I think it should be pretty easy." Especially considering what she's capable of these days.

For Jet, this sort of thing is pretty old hat. She's done at least a few hundred of these sort of runs, and usually for people she's never met. Rather like this time, actually. She finds the bus a rather easy way to travel, anyway. She takes a seat and opens the backpack, examining the contents with a bored yawn. Of course it's all part of the act. It's just a backpack, and whatever is inside shouldn't seem that important to her. She notes the address, committing it to memory with casual ease. Getting there seems easy enough. It turns out to be nothing more than a very normal apartment building. Her instincts tell her to be more wary yet. It's when things seem easy at first that they are likely to turn out really, really ugly.

Jet decides that the best approach here is to simply get in and see what the playing field looks like. First, she takes a moment to case the building. She checks for exits, looks at what vehicles are present, what windows are open, which have the curtains drawn. She's careful to make sure she knows just what she has here. It seems to be pretty vanilla, though. This doesn't look to be a drug house, nor a brothel, nor really anything else that would seem to justify this sneaking. She'll enter through one of the side doors. Just in case. They generally require a key, which would bar most from the building. Jet is rather used to getting past things like locks, though, and with the simple ones they use on apartment buildings, she's in very quickly.

The room is on the second floor, so Jet wastes little time. She doesn't want anyone to see her, and she pauses to listen intently before entering the hall. The nice thing about apartment buildings is that people rarely are in the halls. Most of them hide from their neighbors, or just plain pretend they don't have any. It makes Jet's work that much easier.

Inside the apartment is a man, along with what might be his son - except that the man himself is rather plump, and very Caucasian, while the boy of perhaps eleven years is distinctly Hispanic. Not Mexican, for Jet's Southern eye is more alert to the nuances, but perhaps much further south.

The arrangement is one he seems familiar with - there is already a fat envelope, which rustles with green inside, which he extends upon seeing the backpack. The boy looks vacantly at Jet as the transaction proceeds.

Jet says very little. That's the best way to handle these transactions. She will take what is given and leave what she has brought. The details may be interesting, but a courier doesn't get many jobs asking a lot of questions after a job has been accepted. She just offers up the contents of the backpack, reaching out to take the envelope as well.

Something changes in the air. Jet's aware of what it is even as it happens, with senses and instincts that put to shame what she used to command. The neighbors have gone silent; a police siren which nobody else could hear has abruptly cut off. The cops are coming.

Well, that is hardly going to cut it. She's been set-up, it seems. Jet still makes the transfer. That's what she's here for, after all. She can still get out of here in decent enough shape. The trick is to not be where they expect. She certainly has a talent for that. She will get out of the room in a hurry, looking along the hallway. Since the heat is already coming, she might as well make herself a little distraction. This complex, like most, uses ceiling mounted heat detector and sprinklers in one. Jet's quite familiar with the way they work. A small, temperature sensitive chemical rests above the spout. With just the right flick, she can set it off. The flick of a lighter, that is. One trick she's learned is that it is really quit easy to be unseen in a crowd. Especially a frantic one, like those fleeing a building they believe is on fire.

The voice of a boy behind Jet gets her attention - "Wait!"

Jet looks back, "You have something in mind, kid?" she asks. She is open to suggestions. It's not like she'll have trouble getting out of here, exactly. The cops are highly unlikely to catch her if she doesn't want them to. "I'm kind of in a hurry here."

"This isn't right," he says, plaintively.

"Nothing much is right these days," answers Jet evenly. "Pretty soon a whole lot of things won't be right. The police are on the way. They are a bit clumsy, got too close." She looks at the boy with a frown, "So either speak plain or get out of my way."

The boy doesn't know what else to say, or what words of conviction will sway this person. All he does is look at her with eyes that reveal fully the pain of a child. It is like no other feeling, and can be expressed like no other.

Jet sighs, thinking quickly. "Well, might as well.. seems my destiny," she mutters softly. "Let's get out of here, kid. If we stay, we're both in big trouble. It's up to you, but you can't think very long."

The youth's eyes well up, but he silently begins to follow.

With the police a critical step behind, Jet isn't in nearly as bad a situation as she might have feared. It helps that she already spotted a great alleyway to slip into. It's not even that far to the next stop of a bus. There's nothing very flashy or glamorous about it, but she gets the job done, and that's all she really cares about. "So what's your name, kid?" she asks. It's the first thing she's said to him since leaving the complex, and she only says it when they are stepping off the bus and making for one of White Rabbit's warehouses.

"Timothy," the South American child replies. Adoption seems likely. He isn't crying yet, but he seems ready to.

"Where are your parents, Timothy?" asks Jet quietly. She gets down to speak to him at even eye level. She knows how annoying it is to have to look up at someone when you talk to them. She makes a point of not asking about the package. It hardly matters now.

"That was my daddy," the boy says as they walk down the street, inconspicuous and unnotice. "I'm Timothy Leary Cinnochiro."

"Your father must be in a difficult business," replies Jet. "I have a feeling he'll know a trick or two to get out of trouble, though." She hopes so, anyway. For the kid's sake. "So why did you stop me, Timothy? What was wrong? I don't think I know just what you want to do. Shouldn't you have stayed with your father?"

"I want to know why you bring him that stuff every week," Timothy says quietly.

"I don't know," says Jet. "That's the first time I've done it, and in my line of work, you don't ask questions. The people who pay me prefer I know as little as possible. For my own safety, I tend to not look too deeply into such things. My guess is, whatever it is that he was brought, he needed it very badly."

"It hurts him," Timothy says quietly.

"Then why does he pay so much to get it?" asks Jet. She imagined it had something to do with drugs. Almost every unlabelled package does. Or something stolen, and that guy hardly had the look of a fence to her.

Timothy just shakes his head. "I don't _know_," he whines, a child lost and adrift in uncertainty. "Please. This isn't right!"

"What would make it right, Timothy?" asks Jet evenly. She's not the best with kids. They make her a bit uncertain, and they are both more obvious to her than adults and yet more confusing.

"I don't know!" the boy says again, and this time he does start to cry. Even if it's a thin trickle of salty tears from his left eye, Jet can feel the dam from which this leak is coming.

Jet sighs softly and reaches out to brush at one of the tears. "Let's get inside. We can talk more there." Jet offers a hand to the boy and looks towards the warehouse. "I'm sure we can find a decent place to talk in here, anyway, then we can figure out just what we have to do to make things right again." Assuming things can ever get right again, of course.

Jet will head on into the warehouse, saying that she's looking for White Rabbit. Hopefully she won't get blank stares. Hopefully she'll figure out what to do about this kid. She wasn't really planning on picking up _that_ sort of package on this little courier run.

The name of White Rabbit is the key which unlocks this particular door, and the foreman goes for the telephone. A few minutes later, the Lanta pulls up and the woman leans forward to peek out the window. "Who's this?" she asks, nonplussed at Timothy's presence.

"A guest," replies Jet. "He was there while I was doing my thing, and kinda wound up tagging along. His name is Timothy. Timothy, this is a friend of mine." Jet hopes that this woman can help her make sense of this situation. "I'm hoping she can help us figure out how to get things right for you again."

The White Rabbit doesn't seem very clued-in herself. "Well, whatever," she says at last. "Does he need to be dropped off somewhere, or do you need bus fare?"

"Timothy, do you have anywhere to go?" asks Jet. She has a feeling this isn't going to get her anything but tears, but it's worth a shot. "Was there anyone else?"

The boy shakes his head slowly. "I wanna know."

"Then you can ask her," says Jet, looking to White Rabbit. "She is the only one who might know. It's really none of my business, though, so it's up to you to ask, Timothy."

"Are you getting in?" asks White Rabbit, sounding terse. "We've got places to go, honey."

For his part, Timothy doesn't speak. He simply keeps staring at Jet.

"Not without the kid getting his situation figured out," says Jet. "I'll ask for him. His dad was the buyer. He wants to know what was in the package. Not that it'll be too hard to figure out. The police were right on our tails. I'm kinda curious just how they got there, too."

This last bit makes the woman distinctly uncomfortable. "I don't know anything about that," she says emphatically. "I'm assuming you're still hip, but I'd hate to find out I'm wrong. You're supposed to be new in town." Her eyes glance down at Timothy. "I don't know anything about buyers or packages either." She smiles sweetly, then stares up at Jet again, all ice. "Now you've brought this kid along. If he goes to the cops, I'm selling this car. You really fucked up."

"I rather doubt that there is going to be any of that," answers Jet evenly. "And while I am new.. I may be sticking around a while." She smirks impishly, "And I have a feeling that things are going to change quite a bit." She looks intently at White Rabbit, "Quite a bit." She looks over the car thoughtfully, clearly considering getting the answers for the kid. "I don't think I was right about you, White Rabbit. You aren't one of Us, aren't you?"

"I don't know who 'us' is, but I'm through. If I hear that you've made trouble for me, we'll talk again," the woman says. She shifts gears, ready to drive off alone.

The Lanta peels out and White Rabbit drives off, dropping a white envelope out of the driver's side window. Presumably it holds Jet's pay. Timothy looks up at Jet again, curious and sad.

Jet looks at the envelope. She'll bend down to pick up the envelope, though she doesn't open it. That she slides out of sight. Maybe White Rabbit got prints on it. "Let's get out of here, kid," says the Lunar. "We need to get you some place safe." Though really are there many places safer than at the side of a Full Moon Lunar? She'll help get Timothy back to the the headquarters, and hope that she can figure out from someone else what to do. She doesn't know much about kids.

The bus ride is uneventful. Mary is waiting at the door when the two appear, and she smiles quietly. "Welcome back."

"Hello Mary," says Jet. She leads Timothy by the hand, "I'm afraid I blew it with the contact. Near the end, I was thinking of fracturing her skull." She turns to the kid and says, "Oh, Mary, this is Timothy. He's been rather swept up in things. He had a question, and I am going to see it answered, one way or another. You don't happen to know someone who is good at tracking criminal records with very little evidence, do you?" The Lunar very carefully draws out the envelope, "She left this, and I know a lot of locations she's used. I imagine they are all clearing out quickly now, though."

Mary sighs tiredly, and shakes her head. "The question isn't one anyone else can answer," she says cryptically. "In this, accept what fate has presented you."

"Let me at least say that I foretold something like this, after you came to me with your question, and that my phone call set events in motion which needed to happen."

"Then I guess we should go inside," says Jet. She looks to Timothy, "So, you want something to eat? I'm sure we'll be spending a few days together at least, so we might as well get comfortable until things can be right once more." She looks back to Mary, "I'm going to need to buy some more things for my quarters."

"They have already been prepared," the woman replies. "Determine what else you need, and we'll get it."

"Sounds good," says Jet. She will lead the silent boy with a reassuring smile. "I think we'll be just fine," she says confidently. "I've been through just about everything you can run into. Twice. We'll figure it out."

The next morning, Mary slips a note under Jet's door. A transcription from the police blotter, detailing the arrest of Timothy's father on drug-possession and corruption charges.

Jet looks at the note and sighs. "Looks like I've got my work cut out for me," she says quietly. She rubs at the back of her neck, folding away the paper and keeping it out of sigh. Still, she has a feeling there's nothing she can't survive, no problem she cannot fix. She just has to think on it.
