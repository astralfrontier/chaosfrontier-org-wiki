# Fall of Eden 2006-03-20

Jet has faced many rough situations in her life. She was used to the harsh realities of living while other girls were still dreaming about being princesses. Still, relaying the roughest edges of light to a child is something that requires a certain measure of tact. Even so, it doesn't take her terribly long to face Timothy's question. Only a few hours, in fact and she calls the child (now fed and perhaps the slightest bit more relaxed) to her room for a conversation.

Timothy comes. He still has the sad, careworn face he did before, and it's clear that he has done some crying between now and the time Jet last saw him.

"You have asked to understand something," begins Jet rather abruptly. "Something that is very hard for most to really grasp." She gestures to her bed, inviting Timothy to sit there, and when he does, she joins him. "You know that what your father was getting made him feel bad. But he couldn't stop buying it. Before you can really get it, you have to think of something. I want you to imagine a time or a place that makes you happy. Something that makes everything okay."

Timothy thinks hard, taking several moments. He looks up and shakes his head slowly. "What if it's not a time or place?" he asks in a hesitant voice.

"Anything that always makes you happy will do," says Jet. "Just imagine it. Wrap your mind in it," she instructs seriously. "If you can share it, it might help as well. That's up to you, though."

Timothy nods slowly. "It's .. when I was adopted. And when my father got married. And when the Shriram deal happened. And when I solved pi. It was whenever my father was smiling."

"Imagine that someone came to you one day, like this day, when things seemed bad, and they gave you something that for a moment seemed to make you happy like those things did," says Jet quietly. "Wouldn't that seem really good?"

The boy nods slowly, after turning this over in his mind. "I guess."

"So you try it once, but it does something in you," says Jet. "It breaks something, and at first, you think all you need to do is use it once more and it'll be alright. You think you can handle it. But you're wrong. It soon makes everything else awful. It's not about being happy anymore. It's just about not being miserable. Soon when you aren't using it, you feel like you do now, only for no good reason at all."

Timothy looks on, uncomprehending. "But then.. if you know this.. why bring it to him?" he asks at last.

"In this case, because I wasn't entirely sure what I was bringing," says Jet. "Not that I haven't sold drugs before. That's what it was. Before I did it because it was a good way to make money. It was something I had to do." She looks down at her hands. "This time I should have known better. I'm above that now. I'm sorry, Timothy. I made a mistake. The reasons I used to give to justify it were pretty useless. Just because someone else would sell it, just because they want it so bad is no real excuse, is it?"

Timothy shakes his head. Tears are starting to come again. "I don't understand," he pleads.

"People do bad things, Timothy," says Jet softly. "I did a very bad thing. It didn't seem so bad at the time. When I did it before, I was trying to fool myself into thinking it didn't matter. I even sometimes thought they were getting what they deserved." She sighs softly, "I was wrong."

"Why do people do bad things?" he asks, softly.

That question makes Jet fall silent for a time, "Because we sometimes forget about others and think only of ourselves. We may not want to, but the thought that you are the only thing that matters in the world is pretty attractive. It's not true, though."

The lad listens to this, but says nothing more. He's thinking hard about this, it's clear. But it doesn't seem like he has come to any new conclusions. It's simply a great deal to digest.

"Timothy, you can stay as long as you like," says Jet. "I'll do all I can for you. I can't make it all go back the way it was, but maybe we can fix things for the better. Would you like me to give you some time to think?"

Timothy nods slowly. He slides off the bed and onto his feet, rubbing his eyes clumsily with his hands.

"You want to rest here?" asks Jet. "The bed's pretty good, and I'm thinking I won't be needing it tonight." She has a feeling she has some hunting to do.

Timothy nods slowly.

Jet leaves Timothy to sleep, turning her mind to gathering information. She isn't sure just what she's going to do, but she has this desire to deal with White Rabbit one way or another. It won't necessarily help fix matters, but she's got some ideas. First thing she wants to do is talk to Meyer. Might as well start seeing what these people at 'hq' can do for her.

Meyer has an office in one of the complex's many apartments. It's scattered with papers and filing systems of all kinds - a disorganized, impossible mess. Meyer himself seems unconcerned with his seeming lack of control over the sprawl, for he's casually drinking Red Bull when Jet walks through his door. He waves and smiles, gesturing at an office chair stacked a foot high with boxed files. "Sit down, sit down," he offers.

The financier guzzles down the last of his energy drink and tosses the can cavalierly behind him, over one shoulder. It clatters to a stop in some forgotten corner of the office. "What's on your mind?"

Jet looks over the files and casually lifts them up and nonchalantly drops them to the side. In this mess, who really cares? "I was hoping you might help me out with a little project. As you probably know, my little foray into the wilds got me back here with a lost contact and a young boy. I'm not sure just what I can do for him, but I'd like to help his old man get a fair shake. I think I know how. I think if he can help take out the White Rabbit, he might get off a lot easier."

Meyer listens, pauses, then laughs out loud in amusement. "Oh?" he asks. "How interesting. Tell me what happened, first, please?"

"I stepped out of the house and met someone named White Rabbit," says Jet. "Obviously some fairly well set-up hood in the area. She showed me a few places, then had me do a drop for her. It went wrong and the cops showed. Someone knew I was coming. I got out, but with the kid. His father was the buyer and got nailed. I'd like to get him out of trouble. For Timothy. That's the boy's name."

"Is that what you'd like?" asks Meyer, curiously. He reaches for his telephone, having to shove aside a stack of _Forbes_ back-issues to do so, and dials an extension. "Barry? ... Yes, come over, please." Hanging up the receiver, he returns his attention to Jet. "Barry will tell you what he can about the White Rabbit, and about Wonderland. Forgive the whimsy, but I'm really quite fond of it." He chuckles. "For my part, let me give you some advice."

Leaning forward, Meyer clasps his hands together and props his elbows up on his knees. "Jet, fate is a funny thing. Our lives touch other lives, and those lives touch still more. This spiderweb of interconnectedness is intricate, but not perfect. We have it in our hearts to make it as perfect as we know how, of course... but we don't always have time to look around us, to see the strands that connect us. For example.. this boy, Timothy. Was he in the best household for him? Is it better that a man like his father go free, or be put in jail? Have you asked yourself these things?"

"I haven't had a lot of time to think," says Jet. "But then again, part of me feels that I'm not so good at handling these situations. I'm used to the, hmm. You might say the other side of the law. My darker side has kept me alive a long time. I won't pretend that I'm turning over a new leaf. I just don't think I need stoop so pathetically low again. I don't really know what I can do for the boy, but I don't want to just dump him." Something clearly wrankles there. For those that know Jet's history, it probably makes pretty good sense.

Meyer nods. "Perhaps you and he were drawn together because the law _is_ the wrong answer for the boy. Or perhaps because you needed to see the value in the law. I'm not familiar enough with the situation to say, and this sort of business is really Mary's area of expertise.. families, relationships, that sort of thing. I'm better with unimportant intangibles. Like money." Meyer chuckles wryly.

Jet catches a presence behind her - the odor, the barely-heard footfalls. Barry is here, but isn't interrupting.

"You are more my kind of person, then," says Jet. She pauses and says, "But we have someone waiting on us, and I do hate to leave others in suspense." It's not like they don't already know she can sense things far better than most. "Besides, I could use more perspectives on this. It seems that it is at least possible that what is best for the boy is to stay with us here. I don't know what he wants yet, nor even what family he has left, but I won't discount it completely as an alternative." She sighs softly and notes, "I'm not really much for being a parent figure, though."

Barry chuckles and steps in - and over, in some cases, given the condition of the floor. Meyer briefly explains what has been discussed and Barry nods. "Let's go to the living room and talk about Wonderland, Jet." Turning, he leads the way out.

Jet rises smoothly and waves to Meyer. "We'll talk later about that meaningless stuff you and I like so much," she promises. She focuses her attention on Barry then and asks, "Why was I hooked up with someone who was going to lead me right into a trap? Is this more of that fate business? I think my fate is getting kinda screwed-up lately, really.."

"I made the call that tipped off the cops," says Barry calmly, as the pair enter the living-room area. Barry takes a seat on the couch, crossing his legs and getting comfortable. "Let me at least say that interfering with White Rabbit will cause Mary a great deal of trouble in her operations."

"So why did you set me up?" asks Jet, just a little touch of ice in her voice. "Was there some special reason you threw that kid's father in jail? It's not like they are gonna help clean him up." She is not pleased.

Barry shakes his head. "You won't like this answer. But it was simply his time for a change. I manage transitions, Jet. Transformations. Death is one of those. Life imprisonment is another. Rehabilitation is a third. There are others."

"It was Timothy's time as well."

"His time?" asks Jet. "How can you be so sure that it was the right time? And why when I was there?" She isn't precisely doubting Barry. She's not sure that would be wise, considering things. She's also kinda banking on these new friends having a good idea of what they are doing.

"It was his time because it was." Barry shrugs, but not casually. His face is not the unreadable mask of the man making excuses, but the open face of a mentor or guardian talking about his charge. Compassion rings clearly in his voice. "You were involved because we wanted you to understand the sort of thing we do here. To see it with your own eyes, before you judge us and truly decide to trust us."

"But now he's tied to me," says Jet. "Which isn't really that great for him," adds Jet quickly. "You have any great words for that? I'm not sure what to do, and the kid is very confused still. I can't press him on what he wants to do now. He's barely able to understand what I've told him. I don't think I would have at his age."

Barry nods. "But you're an adult now. We were fully prepared to see to his well-being even without your presence. So this need not be your problem...." He steeples his fingers. ".. Unless, of course, you choose for it to be."

"You know I won't let it fall into other hands unless I'm completely positive that they are better than I am," replies Jet. "And even then, the child should get a say. He's not a piece of furniture to be passed around!" Her voice turns into something of a growl at the end, the sound distinctly like that of a great cat. "Still, if he decides to stay here, he will need a school or.. or something. That's important. It'll make him happy, and it'll help him become whoever it is that he is meant to be."

"Jet... Right now, he IS confused." Barry frowns gently. "He may not know what's best for him. I think it's right to take his feelings into account. Your feelings about him are important too. But so is good judgement. If you don't feel comfortable handing him off to us to take care of, then do what you _know_ is best for him."

"I'm just not entirely sure I'm qualified either," points out Jet. She crosses her arms and adds, "Not that it matters right now. Until he's less confused, we have to just let things go. It'd be stupid to try and make any big or long-term changes at this point. He needs time to get back down to earth. I want him comfortable and left alone unless he wants company. I hope you guys don't avoid him. This is a bad time for him to feel isolated."

Barry shakes his head. "I've already talked to him briefly, although he may not remember right now. He was quite confused at the time. We'll speak again." The man offers a gentle smile. "I don't intend for him to hurt any more than he must right now. We're pulling a poison arrow out of a very deep wound, Jet."

"I'm not a very good healer," Jet says quietly. "But I'll try. At least I have an idea of how he feels. I don't think I want him to have the same approach to things." She smirks and says, "Isn't it just like an adult to want to spare a child from making their mistakes, though? It's so.. arrogant."

Barry smiles. "In my years in pediatrics, I would say it's rarely arrogance. It's usually called 'parenting'."

"You were a pediatrician?" asks Jet, sounding stunned. "Anyway.. I suppose you are right. Still, I don't know if I'm the best call. I will do my best, though. I just have this feeling I'm going to be all over the place, and a child needs some stability in their life."

Barry nods. "We're prepared to find a proper hmm, creche environment for Timothy. Raising him shouldn't be the responsibility of just one or even two people."

"He probably could use extra attention, considering things," agrees Jet. "Umm.." She laughs softly, "You know, I have this feeling that the way things are going, I may be able to supply him with something of a family. I think Becca wouldn't mind a little brother, anyway. It might help them both heal."

Barry nods. "And Becca has her own needs as well." The reminder is calm, not pushy. "We'll all help each other. Okay?"

"Certainly," says Jet. There is just a little edge to her voice, though. She's very protective of 'her' people. "I only want the best for them. Becca at least is seeming to be better off, though I think she may be starting to need me too much for her own good. I have some ideas to help her regain confidence, though. That's all for another day I think."

Barry nods. "I'm here. If I can be of assistance, let me know, alright?" He smiles amiably. "Now. Let me at least tell you about Wonderland."

"That would be nice to understand," replies Jet. She seems to be putting the other concerns on the shelf for the moment. She knows better than to try to handle three separate issues at once. "What is with all the Wonderland references, anyway?"

"Meyer's idea. 'Wonderland' is our term for our operations in California. The White Rabbit liked what we called her enough to choose the name, ah, professionally. Mary is our liaison to her, and by extension to most of the 'soft' underworld activities we monitor, or sometimes control. Meyer interfaces with the financial and legal aspects, while I'm more of a coordinator."

"So you let her run her show?" asks Jet. "She's nice to look at, at least, though I think she doesn't like me much now." The Lunar sighs and shrugs it off, "A pity, but that's neither here nor there. Still, a rather weird name for it. I wouldn't call pedalling drugs 'soft', though. It's just a more slow and destructive form of assassination."

"I consider murder, vivisection, and organ theft 'hard', Jet." Barry's eyes narrow. "All of these things happen, in an organized fashion, in Los Angeles. _My_ war is against such things, and I'm not above using drugs to achieve those ends."

"You mean people really do the whole organ theft thing?" murmurs Jet. "Always thought that was just an urban tale. Sloppy, really, and rather pointless. And vivisection? Really weird. These California hoods must be really screwed-up to piss around with that crap. It's a lot less work to just steal money than to pass body parts around. If you do it well, you can stay pretty clean, too. So now that I'm here, what is my part in Wonderland? I'm not really that interested in being subtle with murderers or rapists, though. My solution to those kind of problems tends to operate outside the world of appeals."

"We haven't decided on a formal position for you yet - that was provisional on your performance with White Rabbit, which of course ended as it did." Barry hums. "So we'll consider it, and take your input when the time is right."

"You didn't really give me a very clean shot with White Rabbit," notes Jet. "You decided that whatever the hell little bump of fate you were arranging was more important than my getting in with her." Jet doesn't sound precisely thrilled about that, of course. "Still, I suppose I should be nice and not do things my way.. yet. I'll give you time to find a place for me. I'm not exactly liking the thought of being bored and cooped-up in this little complex much, though. You know what I am. I need to be active. This already feels a bit too tight for my tastes. So let me know, but don't take too long."

Barry nods. "Let me just say... that I don't think the rift between you and White Rabbit is permanent. In fact, it may be healing itself rather soon." His eyes twinkle in amusement. "Call it a hunch."
