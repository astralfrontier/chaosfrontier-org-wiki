# Fall of Eden 2006-03-31

September 2007. Jet, Timothy, and Meyer are alone in the communal apartments. Mary is off taking care of business, while Barry has volunteered to assist Becca in finding a new job. Poe is out taking pictures, helping to set up what Barry has promised him - a reliable alibi for his extended absence from his Seattle home and journalist's job.

There is a video-conference call between the West Coast team and other 'safe-houses' around the world, something the Sidereals have organized. Today, it is to Europe, and Jet watches as a strange face appears on the screen. "Doctor Newton Benford," a European voice says from off-camera, by introduction, and Jet watches a face appear.

For his part, Benford sees a mixed-race woman and a ten-year-old boy, in addition to one of the Sidereals he recognizes from Hel's dossiers, a man called Meyer. It is evening for him.

The conference is being held in the impromptu laboratory Hel has established, with a white-board full of equations and diagrams behind the camera. Jack is absent from the chalet on 'business', leaving Benford alone with Hel for the evening.

Jet has been bored all day. Having Becca away has made her a touch irritable, though strangely when she's around the boy her rather harsh personality is mitigated. At least a little. "So what's exciting in Europe?" She turns to look at Meyer for a moment, then turns back towards Benford. "I imagine that these calls are for more than just idle chat, right? I could use something to do."

Benford raises an eyebrow. "I imagine excitement would be more Jack's department. I've been occupied with this lately," he says, as he waves a hand at the whiteboard. "I'm curious about your young friend. Did someone choose him?" The subtext is obvious: are the Gods now exalting children?

Timothy peers at the screen with wide eyes. He seems shy, though a few moments before the call he was chatty as could be. For better or worse, Jet doesn't seem to intimidate the kid in the least now. "Nah, it's not like that. He's a bit too young to get into whatever it is we're in for," answers Jet. She frowns thoughtfully, her attention shifting for just a moment away, and then back. "So what is all that, anyway?" she asks. "Oh, and I'm not from MIT, so speak English."

Benford blinks, twice. "I _am_ English, Miss... Jet? But I guess you mean to keep the technobabble down. Very well." Benford turns to the whiteboard, the camera tracking across the lab. The whiteboard is only one of a dozen, covered in multicoloured scrawls of equations and diagrams. The scientist stands by one diagram in particular, a sketch of a cylindrical device which, despite being drawn in marker, is as intricate and rich as a da Vinci notebook. "I'm a nuclear scientist. Our associates have asked that I revolutionize all of human industry by inventing a new kind of power plant that is cheap, non-polluting, scalable, and reliable. This is it." He pauses and strokes his chin. "Or it will be, eventually. The best minds in the world thought this might take thirty years to develop. I'm trying to speed things up a bit."

While Benford is talking, Timothy has crept forward toward the wide screen. Picking up the light-pen, he starts to doodle. And the whiteboard software built into the video-conferencing system obligingly retains his scrawls in glowing pixels on the screen.

Benford watches the graphics appear on his own display. He turns, mentally flipping the doodles around, and realizes what Timothy is doing. He's solving the equations.

Benford's jaw drops. "Um... let's defer this discussion a moment." He picks up a light pen in the Swiss lab and sketches an equation of his own - a simple quadratic equation. "Timothy? You're very good at maths, aren't you? Do you know the solution to this problem?"

Timothy watches the light-lines appearing on the screen. He promptly draws out his own solution, then looks up at the screen again.

Jet sits back, arching an eyebrow. She looks over to Meyer. For the moment, she's silent. She has no idea at all what is going on. The kid is just.. drawing. It means nothing at all to her, of course. She spent most of her days cutting classes.

Benford smiles. "Excellent. Might we try something a little more challenging?" He sketches out a few simple problems in geometry, which Timothy solves. And then several differentials, and simple integrals. Timothy only slows down on integration of trigonometric functions, at which point Benford stops. "Thank you, my friend, that's enough." He puts down the light pen. "Our young friend here has quite a talent. Did you go to a special school, Timothy?"

The South American youth shakes his head slowly. He turns his head, looking uncertainly at Jet.

Benford infers a lot of psychology from that glance. For whatever reason, the tough-looking woman is standing in for the boy's parents. Benford addresses his remarks at Jet. "Your friend has a real gift," he says softly. "Maybe you'd like to talk to him about it?"

Benford draws 'IQ = 180+' on the screen with a finger, just to get the idea across.

"Whatever he's done, it's beyond me," says Jet. "But I will look out for him, and make sure that whatever goes down, he'll be safe." She reaches out to put an arm around the boy, her motion broken for a moment of hesitation that is swiftly overcome by instinct. It's not like anyone who wants to live would give her crap for showing a bit of softness. She'd correct them fast. "So do you enjoy math, then, Timothy?" she asks curiously. To her, that's far more important than just being good at something.

Timothy nods slowly. "I guess.."

"Well, you'll get a chance to figure it out," promises Jet. She looks back to Benford, studying those equations for a moment. Not a clue, really. Her mind works in another world. "So how much faster do you think you can reach your goal? And if we're meeting, I'm guessing it's to give you something if you need it, right?" She is angling for a major roadtrip, it seems.

Benford is expressionless. "Will you excuse me for a moment?" He mutes the microphone and addresses Hel off-camera for a minute.

Benford comes back on the mic. "I've been advised that I should go to you. As far as what I need... I'd prefer to think that I'll be able to help you. I think we'll know, when we meet."

Benford thinks for a moment and adds, "Timothy? I'd like to teach you some advanced maths. It may be that you'll be the one who helps me, very soon, and it's very important work. It will help a lot of people. May I visit you and talk it over?"

Timothy looks back again at Jet, eyes wide. He is hopelessly at sea.

Jet turns her eyes to Timothy. She speaks to him, first. "All of us are meant to do something. Something that nobody can stop us from doing. In our guts, we know when it's right. I think you should meet and give it a try, Timothy." She manages a rare, reassuring smile for the boy that vanishes when she looks back to Benford. She naturally isn't sure of this guy, but he seems harmless enough. "I'll be with you two, just to make sure things go well. We'll need to put in a lot of breaks. He's a boy, not a pocket calculator, and I know how you brainy types can go for 16 hours without blinking."

Benford says, "There's no need to rush," he says slowly. He spends a while looking like he's trying to think of something else to say, and gives up. He simply shrugs and says, "I'm at your service, Miss."

Jet isn't used to that kind of talk, and for a moment she has to pause for thought. "Hrm, not sure what I'd do with a scientist, so maybe you should just carry on. If I need anything special, I'll let you know." She smirks and leans forward again, "I don't suppose you can do anything with bikes.."

Benford lets a bemused expression cross his features. "Try me and then we'll both find out, Miss."

This guy is too nice to be trusted. Jet isn't sure if the whole 'miss' thing is charming or insulting, though. For the moment, she's decided that she likes having at least one person who treats her like a fairly normal person. "So I guess this is the last time we'll have to talk this way, then? You'll be heading this way soon?" Jet can tell Timothy's getting a bit bored, from the way he's squirming at her side, so she quickly adds, "I'm sure we can handle the rest when you are here."

Benford says, "Yes, my friends here tell me that we'll next speak in person." He turns back to his sketch, for Meyer's benefit. "As of today, the power plant is possible and likely. It's just a question of when. I'm guessing that's what you most wanted to know. Do you want me to go into specifics, or shall I just brief you in person?"

Jet looks down to Timothy and nods, hoisting the kid up. She swats just enough at his behind to get him going, "Head up, I'll be there in a sec. We're almost done." She will just wait for Meyer to wrap this up.

Meyer closes the connection, and only then does he laugh loud, and long. "That was magnificent, Jet," he says, upon finishing. Wiping tears from his eyes, he explains himself. "You see.. Our Timothy here.. Barry and Mary both knew about him, somehow. That he needed a new place. But.. bless my heart, they had no idea why!"

"We must look like fools to you, I imagine," he grins.

"I fail to see how that is so amusing," replies Jet. "The kid has a long road ahead of him. I have no idea of what I'm supposed to do about it all, but I do know one thing. If anyone tries to use him, or cause him harm, nobody will ever know what happened to them except me. I think you knew that already, though."

Meyer smiles. "Well," he replies, "whose care is better for him? The care he had, or the care you and I are arranging?"

"But were you sure that things would end well for him?" asks Jet softly. "Did it even matter? What if you make a mistake?" A thought occurs to her suddenly, "Wait a second... I'm not a scientist. I'm not some great writer. I'm here for damage control, aren't I?"

"This may be hard for you, Jet," says Meyer. "But, Barry, Mary, and myself act on impulses that we _know_ are true. Even if we can't explain why."

"You have to realize how that sounds to me right now," answers Jet. "You know the world I operate in is nothing like the others here. I was told there'd be work for me. I want to know what that work is. I came a long way, and I don't think you wanted me just to pick people up for you."

Meyer nods slowly. "The work we do may not be for you. In which case, we'll try to find something else for you. But that's Barry's job. Mine is to keep you funded."

"I think one thing I'm going to do is deal with the White Rabbit," says Jet softly. "Wonderland needs a Queen of Hearts, don't you think?" She looks up, her ears perking. Timothy is used to being able to just say her name and have her come without shouting. "Anyway, I'm going to go see what the is up to." She pauses before leaving the room, saying over her shoulder, "Oh, and he wants pizza. Just cheese on it this time, or I'll break the delivery man's legs."
