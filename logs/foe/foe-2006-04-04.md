# Fall of Eden 2006-04-04

Barry has introduced Andrew Morgan to Special Agent Ivan Delaney of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Delaney is 'our man in the Bureau', as Barry puts it afterward, and will be providing an indispensable part of covering up Morgan's departure from Seattle and subsequent silence.

Later, over crepes at an outdoor deli, Barry explains the situation. "Delaney has certain vices, certain interests, that Mary and I feel we can fill without violating our personal morals. In return he has been useful time and again in the work we do."

"For example, the matter of your family and friends. You cannot easily explain your newfound condition without introducing a host of problems. Yet the feelings of those you left behind are of importance to us. Despite its reputation, the men and women in the Bureau will provide as much comfort and consideration as they can. These are people who are acquainted with suffering, Mr. Morgan. They will be as warm as they are able to the people you care about."

Morgan chews on his crepe, pondering this. "I... see," he says, moodily. He still hasn't fully adjusted to the idea that he has, at least for now, left his old life behind - though he understands the necessity. He sighs deeply, and nods. "Have you learned anything about the people who attacked my apartment?" he asks.

"We're investigating it. When you're ready, you will probably do a better job than all of us combined. The search for truth seems to be in your nature, Mr. Morgan." Barry laughs quietly. "You will find that, from now on, whatever is in your nature will be almost effortless."

Morgan raises an eyebrow, and smiles. "Well, that's something, at least. So, when will I be ready?" he asks with a grin in return.

"It sounds trite, but I think you will know when you are. For now, I want to discuss another matter with you." Barry rises from the deli table and gestures at his car. "Shall we go for a drive?"

Morgan chuckles. He half expected that answer from the man - and he knew in his heart that it was true anyway. "By all means. For the time being, at least, my time is yours."

The two men drive in Barry's car, a purring 2008 Honda hybrid. The Sidereal's in-dash MP3 player sets a gentle background ambience to their conversation. "We're a paradox. We have dealt in vice, drugs, and more, but we have also cured addictions, saved lives, and rooted out corruption. Mary, Meyer and myself have found ourselves increasingly drawn into a sort of 'management' role. Management as opposed to leadership, Mr. Morgan. I fully believe the latter is the role of the Solar and Lunar Exalts. But we are responsible for bringing things to the attention of our Celestial peers."

Out the window are men and women on the street, some walking, others simply slumped down in doorways. One holds an illegible cardboard sign. Many are dressed heavily, even for California. Barry nods in the direction of the sidewalk. "Things like this. Poverty. Drug abuse. Violence. Corruption. Ignorance. I have taken the time to read a few of your recent articles online. These are things you have taken note of as well."

Morgan rubs his chin and nods. "Often," he acknowledges. "There are always those who are ready to exploit their fellow man - and sometimes their victims come to demand it, which is most tragic of all."

"I offer you the chance to do some direct good for such people," Barry says, taking a right turn onto another street. "You'll feel rather sick for a few days - physically - and I'll be undergoing the same procedure. Interested?"

Morgan sits back in his seat for a moment, looking at the roof. Finally, he nods. "Well, I don't seem to have anything else on my schedule..." He turns to Barry with a wry grin. "And if nothing else, I've seen that you have a clear sense of your own importance to the world. So if you're that certain it'll only be a few days, I think I'm willing to take my chances too."

"Of course. This is a procedure I've undergone before, several times." Barry pulls into a parking lot and stops the car, then turns to look at Morgan directly. "I want you to understand what I'm proposing. A doctor will be injecting us with a virus. Your body will be producing antibodies to fight it, as mine did. These will be harvested and used as a treatment."

"So why us?" asks Morgan. "And for that matter, why at all? If you or I can fight off this virus so easily, why is it..." He pauses, and knots his brow. "Those questions have the same answer, don't they. It's more than just being able to do things that come naturally to us... Are you saying we're physically hardier, too?"

Barry holds up his left hand. "I was shot through this hand by a mugger," he says calmly. He turns it round and round, demonstrating that there is no scarring at all. "We haven't begun to explore the possibilities."

Morgan grins. "So I'm part of a cutting-edge research project," he says. He's a little less reassured now, but... once again, these 'Sidereals' have not struck him as gamblers and risk-takers. "Do I want to know _which_ virus you have in mind?"

Barry sighs a bit. "Human immunodeficiency virus. HIV. The AIDS virus. The one that's killing infected infants right now. We can do something about it, Mr. Morgan."

Morgan pales. "You really _are_ sure of yourselves, aren't you," he says softly, almost in shock. "I knew a man who died of AIDS. It... wasn't pretty." He stares off into space for a long moment. "You said you've done this before. What virus did you take?" he finally asks.

"AIDS, same as now," Barry answers.

Morgan is speechless for several long moments. "You're serious, aren't you?" he whispers. "You've _already_ done this." He shakes his head in astonishment - can this really be true? Then he remembers his Exaltation. If the sun can go into eclipse months out of season, who is he to say what's impossible? "All right," he says, nodding slightly. "If I only could've saved Mark's life, I... I'll do it."

Saint Francis Memorial Hospital is near the Bay Bridge. There's good parking, and Barry parks the car near the door. He makes a call on his cell, letting whoever is on the other end know what's going on, and hangs up as the pair enter. He seems to know his way around.

The door labeled DR. IYENGAR is answered by an Indian woman with piercing eyes, who seems to recognize Barry immediately. "There's two of you now?" she asks in an unsteady voice, and Barry nods. "This is Andy. We're here to donate."

Morgan raises an eyebrow, but says nothing. _Donate?_ he wonders to himself, knowing full well that Barry's words are meant for hearing by the wrong ears, but wondering whether this Dr. Iyengar knows the real story. And if not, how she'd react if she did.

"Alright then..." The doctor closes the office door behind her and begins walking down the hall. Barry follows, beckoning for Poe to catch up. "She's hip," he explains in a whisper. "Well. Half-hip. But trust her, okay?"

"I trust _you_," replies Morgan, likewise _sotto voce_. He wishes he'd thought to ask Barry about the full cover story back in the car, and resolves to do so as soon as he gets the chance.

The two men are escorted to hospital beds, curtained off from the rest of the ward. Dr. Iyengar prepares a syringe for each, and Morgan finds himself injected a few minutes later. He glances over, watching Barry receive the same treatment. "Rest now," says the doctor, her voice quavering. Morgan recognizes the same quality he has felt - a disbelief in miracles that are happening right in front of your eyes. With that, she closes the curtains, and the two men are left to relax.

Morgan lies back in his bed. "What will you do once you have it?" he says softly. He doesn't know who might be listening on the other side of the curtains, but he's certain that Barry will understand that he's asking about the cure.

"Funny thing, biology," Barry says. "We can produce antibodies as part of our immune system. We just can't share them widely. There's only so much to go around. And you can't just stick them on a biological Xerox machine and photocopy them. So... someone chooses a recipient."

"You can't?" says Morgan, with a faint smile. "Maybe you just need a proper scientist to be blessed by the gods, not just some newspaper reporter..." He looks up at the ceiling. "For now, though... one infection, one cure?"

"No. I produce enough serum to cure almost a hundred people at a time. I expect we'll at least double that.." Barry hums. "Our cells can't be mixed with tumors to form a hybridoma, either. If I could just leave a donation of cells behind, I would. It's rather personal this way."

Morgan chuckles. "I don't mind personal," he says. "It's just inefficient, that's all. Just the two of us, a hundred each at a time... that won't even make a dent in the spread of the disease." He ponders this for a moment. "I guess that puts you in the position of deciding which tiny handful will live. The old lifeboat problem..."

"I prefer not to choose them myself," Barry murmurs. "You're free to talk to the doctor, though. If you know anyone...else."

Morgan seems to be studying the ceiling tiles. "I might..." he says softly. Then sighs. "And they'd have to be discreet about it, wouldn't they. If word got out..." Morgan had covered the WTO protests in 1999; stories of an AIDS cure, with such a drastically limited supply, would make that look like a wet firecracker.

Barry chuckles. "Yeah. This isn't something you can easily write a story about. Not yet."

"Quite the contrary," agrees Morgan ruefully. "This is just a stopgap, a way to save the people who need it most." He sighs again, then smiles. "Still, even this little bit's worth it, isn't it? A hundred people saved from death, and it only costs me a few days of bed rest feeling miserable." His head turns slightly, facing where the sun would be if the roof weren't in the way. "If just my _body_ can save so many lives so easily... I wonder what happens if I put my _mind_ to it."

The next few days are a hassle. Morgan has developed a fever, and Barry seems to have it as well. The doctor keeps the pair as comfortable as possible, and they are easily able to move around, keeping a minimum level of physical activity. Meals are as normal, if more bland, and Morgan only once has any trouble. Even then, he does not become much more sick.

Four days pass. Morgan's skin becomes prickly and red from the repeated injection of needles, but he never once bruises or blackens. He feels like all his blood has been taken from him, and yet there is always more to give. And at the end of the four days, he and the Sidereal are back on their feet, like nothing happened.

"You have had a follow-up screening a few months after, of course?" asks Morgan. He doesn't usually cover the health beat, but the Health and Lifestyle deputy editor never tires of explaining to anyone who will listen that it can take two or three months after exposure for the virus to show up in standard tests.

"It's been a year since I first started doing this," Barry answers.

Morgan nods. "I think I'll get tested myself, all the same." It's still hard for him to believe in miracles. If he'd been Thomas the Apostle, he'd have insisted on interviewing the tomb guards personally.
