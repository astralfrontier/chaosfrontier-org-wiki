# Fall of Eden 2006-04-10

The van that pulled up in front of the house is familiar to Jet. She received a mysterious set of tattoos in the back of the van. Looking out through the window-drapes at the noise, Jet watches as the man in the suit and Roger Wolf Pads climb out and walk toward the door. A few moments later, they knock.

Barry and Poe are out on the same business they have been; nobody has given specifics, and Meyer has privately confided in Jet that whatever it is, it's one of Barry's personal sidelines.

Which leaves Jet alone with her curious family. "House guests," murmurs the Full Moon softly. She watches the two very closely. It's not precisely surprising that they are here. After all, they dropped Jet off not so long ago. Still, the appearance makes her eager. "I think it's okay for you two to come down," Jet says finally. She doesn't have to look at Becca or Timothy to know that they are excited.

Jet looks over Becca and Timothy carefully, her motions having taken on something of a lazy grace. There is no rush, the wasted energy is minimized. She'll answer the front door herself, of course, and greet her guests with an amused grin. "You rang?"

The door opens to reveal the man in the suit, and Roger. "We were talking," the nameless Sidereal says abruptly. "Let's go for a drive." He turns and begins walking back towards the vehicle as though the deal were already finalized. Roger shrugs and smiles benevolently.

Jet sighs softly and looks back over her shoulder, "Wait here. I'll be back soon." She figures one way or another that will be true. She shuts the door behind her without giving time for argument. She isn't up for a fight right now. "So care to clue me in on what you were talking about, exactly?" asks Jet.

The suit is already opening the van's driver-side door. "We're taking you to meet more like you and Roger." The door slams shut with him inside, and the engine is already warming up.

For reasons Jet can't really explain, something in her sours to that. "More like us, huh?" She crosses her arms, looking to Roger, "So what is this, some kinda pow-wow?" She'll get into the van, but she's guarded now.

"Something like that," says Roger softly. The van doors shut, and the vehicle speeds off.

---

Jet is with the suit as he enters Saint Francis Memorial Hospital. Somehow he's different. His impatience has been replaced with another quality which Jet recognizes as universal among police detectives - the jaded alertness of a hunting bird. He's got a badge and he flashes it twice when confronted. The sight of it seems to be enough for the nurse and orderly who question him.

Finally the man arrives at his destination. He pulls back the curtain partitioning off a pair of beds. Poe is resting in one; Barry is asleep in the next bed over. "Get up," the man says. "We're going for a drive."

This little twist surprises Jet quite a bit. "So this is what you guys are up to?" asks Jet. She pauses a moment, "Um, so what is it you guys are up to?" She looks around slowly, sniffing at the sterile air with a frown. "I never realized how bad places like this smell.."

Morgan lifts himself up off the bed. "Ah... you must be one of Barry's colleagues..." he begins, and then his eyes widen and he smiles - the other face is quite, quite familiar, in sharp contrast to the unmemorable visage of the man in the suit. "Jet? This _is_ a surprise. To what do I owe the pleasure?" He inclines his head in the man's direction, grinning. "Or has he not told you anything yet?"

"I'm getting accustomed to asking few questions of these guys," replies Jet. She will settle herself by Poe and ask, "And I don't suppose you are going to tell me why you are here? You didn't go and get yourself sick, did you?" She nods to Barry, as well, but keeps her attention on Poe. He's more likely to spill the beans.

Morgan nudges the dozing form next to him. "We've got company, Barry. Friend of yours, I think," he says, then turns to Jet. "Well, you could say that... it's a long story, though. Probably better told on this drive which it appears we're suddenly going to go on."

"I'd rather he not wake up while we're here," the man says, curtly. His eyes drop to the chart affixed to the bed, then back to Poe. "Get up, Mr. Morgan. We can talk and walk at the same time."

"You okay to go with us?" asks Jet. She looks to the man with a frown, then focuses on Poe again. "If you aren't up to this, these guys can wait for another time. The way I've been sitting idle these past few days it can't be all that urgent." Of course, she's itching to go. Anything to get out and do something.

Morgan hmphs. "Fine, fine," he says to the man, looking briefly at Jet as if to assure himself that it's all right. This man may _act_ like one of these Sidereals - that is, acts as if he owns the world - but Poe doesn't trust him yet. Jet he trusts, though - _which is probably why he brought her,_ he thinks. "Yeah, I'm fine. We're just about over it by now, and I wouldn't mind getting a breath of fresh air."

Jet will help Poe up (even if he doesn't need it.) "This guy is okay. He is a pushy bastard, but seems to have a knack for showing up when I need help, and I think you'll like Roger. He's cool." She smirks at the man, trying to see if he reacts to her friedly barb at all. She's probably going to be disappointed.

The man seems to ignore Jet's remark, right up to the point where she's about ready to give him up as lost. Only then does he speak, as though reading her mood. "Pushy bastard beats craven weakling nine times outta ten. Now come on."

---

The van is on the Interstate. "We're goin' out of town," the man explains from the driver's seat. Roger and Poe are in the back; Jet is riding shotgun. "Gonna meet some people Rog and I know from down south."

"How far down south?" asks Jet casually. "I know a few people from south of the border myself. I have a feeling that these aren't quite the same kind of people, though. My friends were mostly pushy bastards. With guns."

Morgan leans back in the seat, stretching his arms. Being bedridden for several days, and all the rest of it, has left him somewhat sore. "You're the boss, mister," he says, chuckling dryly. "Or at least the man behind the wheel, which in many circles is the same thing."

Roger speaks from the back. "A Lunar has come from Mexico. Another has come from over the ocean, from Russia. We met them recently. They have important news. They wanted to speak to Solars. You were the only we knew of."

"A cousin from Mexico," murmurs Jet softly. "Should be fun. And from Russia?" Her eyebrows shoot up and she looks to Poe. "And they want to see see him, huh? That's pretty interesting. Seems like a very long way to come. I hope you can give them whatever it is they need."

"Well, I'm sure I'll do my best," says Poe, shrugging. "I've got a lot to learn, but then again maybe I'll have to learn by doing. Over the past couple days, I've learned that I can't know what's impossible for me till I try."

"Well, if they try to give you any crap, I'll get rid of them," says Jet. "So at worst they've come a long way for a conversation. At best.. well, I guess we'll find that out when we get there." The Full Moon looks ahead, watching traffic closely, "So you gonna tell me what you were up to back there?"

"Working on a cure for AIDS, according to Barry," says Poe. "On a rather _personal_ level. Rather astonishing, the sort of thing our kind are immune to."

"We're immune to _that_?" asks Jet. "I never even thought about that part of the.. you know, the gift we've got now." She turns in her seat to look back to Poe, "So did you guys have any luck with it? And why didn't you guys ask for my help?"

Morgan shrugs. "Well, if everything went this time the same way it did for Barry the last time, it worked out well enough. I guess we won't know the rest until later. Maybe Barry just hadn't got around to asking you yet. I'll ask him about it when I get back. Or you can ask him, if you get the chance."

"I think I'll let you ask," replies Jet. "I don't think I am getting on too well with Barry right now." She ignores that for now, though. "Still, if you could do that.. that'd really save a lot of people. Pretty gutsy, too." She can't help but size-up Poe again. "Hmmm.."

The suit chuckles softly. "If you aren't getting on, that's probably why he didn't ask you," he comments.

"Not that many, yet," admits Poe. "Only a hundred or so at a time. I'm hoping someone will find a way to make that stretch farther. But I figure _that's_ going to take one of Us that's more of a medical scientist."

"Perhaps," says Jet. She grins at the Man, "I don't think Barry understands me. I'm afraid I'm not the kind of person he expected me to be." She sighs softly, "Still, you'd think he would have looked into my past a bit more closely. I have a feeling that you know me better than Barry does. Or perhaps you are just more like me in some way." And then to Poe, "He's found me twice when I needed help. Both times when I didn't really know I was in trouble."

Morgan nods. "That seems to be the pattern. You and Mary showed up right when I found out I was in trouble." He nods to Roger. "So I think it's safe to say that we'll be showing up _just_ in time to help our friends from Mexico and Russia."

"Or maybe we're all just in time to help each other," murmurs Jet. She seems more relaxed, somehow. They aren't after her. "Not much farther, is it?"

"Gonna be several hours," the suit says. "Get comfy."

---

The van is parked under the shade of a deserted gas station's 'island'. The main building is quite damaged and shows its age clearly. The windows are dusty and cracked; the paint is faded and bleached by the California desert sun.

Morgan gets out slowly. He's met people before in places like this, and it's always made him nervous. But then, in the past he's had no protection, other than his reputation for protecting the confidentiality of his sources. This time is different, of course - but he's still a little nervous, all the same.

Jet steps out of the van, immediately moving to stand near Morgan. She can sense his tension, and it seems to infect her, as well. Perhaps it's a strange trick of the light, but it seems her ears actually perk at times, and she sniffs at the air, frowning at whatever it is she catches. "Well, here we are. Seems a pretty likely meeting place." For the worst sort.

Morgan nods. "Certainly is. Ah well, I'm sure our friends will turn up soon enough..." And he wonders what exactly it is that he can offer them.

Behind the gas station is a fire-pit and a small stack of tinned foods, all peeled open. A few cooking staples are nearby, as are a handful of small bones - prey animals which have been expertly skinned, filleted and stripped of anything useful, possibly.

Jet looks over the camp slowly, insisting on going first to have a look at what prints might be left before other feet muddle them entirely. She wants to see just how long it has been since these new friends were at the camp.

Morgan opens his mouth to comment, and then falls silent as he catches sight of Jet's intent expression. He follows in silence, careful not to disturb whatever it is she's up to.

The camp is a fairly recent thing - no more than a week. Jet glances about, spying tracks in the dust. Her thoughts are interrupted by a screeching sound - a hawk or some other creature overhead.

Jet looks up and considers for a moment. "Unless I miss my guess, they know we are here now, and will arrive soon. They haven't been waiting too long." She settles herself at the camp, lidding her eyes and adding, "Sit and wait."

Morgan knows this game, or one like it. They're waiting for a signal at a rendezvous. The details may change, but the shape of events stays the same. He sits down cross-legged beside Jet, and waits patiently.

---

In a few minutes, Jet's expectations are met. The bird she heard earlier alights on the roof, dropping out of sight over the edge. A white-haired woman comes over the edge instead, lightly dropping to the ground on booted feet. Her hair billows out around her, sparkling in the light. Her features are foreign. When she speaks, it is in what Morgan recognizes faintly as Russian, or a dialect thereof.

The man in the suit answers her in kind, curtly. He gestures behind him, speaking names one by one. Whoever this woman is, she may not speak English.

Jet nods to the Lunar slowly, but does not stand up. She looks over to Morgan and smiles for a moment, hoping to keep him relaxed. This is what Jet expected, really. She will wait and see what is translated-if anything-and keep her eye out for the other friend.

The conversation is short and to the point, by the sound of it. The suit turns, but before he speaks, something catches his attention. The others look as well, and spot a coyote dashing toward the campsite. It skids to a halt, flowing and shifting as it does, and where the canine stopped moving, a man has begun. He's wearing the uniform of a Mexican law enforcement officer, and has a big grin on his swarthy face. "Hola! Hola! Welcome!" he calls, jovially. The Russian woman nods politely, and he grins. "You see? They came. Santa Muerte always keeps her word."

Morgan smiles up at the man. "Good day to you," he says, rather bashfully relieved that at least one of their contacts speaks his language. "My name's Andrew."

Jet looks over the newcomer with a wide grin. That's an entrance she like. She greets him with a laugh, "Que pasa?" she replies. She will keep an eye on the other Lunar, but for the moment at least, most of her attention is on the Mexican.

"Hey, pleased to meet you!" The Mexican cop extends a hand, and shakes Poe's vigorously. "I'm Ricky, and uh.. well, I speak better English than her. But we do okay together."

Morgan chuckles, and shakes Ricky's hand. "Fair enough, fair enough. What can I do for you two?" he asks.

"Well, it's like this..." Ricky begins talking, non-stop. The Russian woman listens, a haughty, icy smile playing over her lips. Though she may not understand the language, it's clear that she's silently commenting on the rapid-fire chatter.

Jet sits back, now, relaxing. Well, she's as relaxed as she'll ever appear in the presence of so many strangers. She watches and listens everyone who speaks, and she keeps at least some of her attention on the sound of the rare winds here, and the occasional odd noises that are natural to old, dilapidated buildings like the station.

Ricky has worked on Border Patrol and as a police officer, and hints that he learned about this isolated outpost of civilization in connection with that job. He's also worked further east - his skills as an investigator and tracker were considerable, at least to hear him tell it. During that time, he Exalted when he was crushed by a jeep and abandoned during a running gun-battle with a drug cartel.

Since that time, and since his encounter with Roger and his anonymous friend, Ricky has waged his own war against the cartels, patrolling the border and doing whatever he could to fight back. During his time, he met with a figure calling herself Santa Muerte - 'Saint Death'. "She could lay hands on you and you'd feel no more pain. She was a true saint, a healer. She could stop a child from crying just by looking in his eyes, or feel true love in a virgin's pulse. They said she stopped the rain by singing one time."

"Had a golden crown on her forehead, where the Lady's Kiss is on my own forehead. When I saw Roger again, I told him that, and he said, 'that is a Solar'. So I wanted to meet one. And to tell him what Santa Muerte told me."

Jet continues to listen in silence, leaving it to Poe to sort out just what it is that is needed to be done. She spares him a brief glance that winds up turning into a longer study as the powers of this other Solar are explained. She can't help but wonder just what Poe is capable of.

Morgan's forehead glows briefly with a golden circle within a circle. "And so you have," he acknowledges. "Which means, from the sound of it, that you've met one more Solar than I have so far! And a healer too," he says, musing on his recent experience. "I too would like to meet another Solar - though I don't doubt that I'll have a chance soon enough," he chuckles. "She has a message, then?"

Ricky nods quickly. "She said that the cartels are gathering in strength and numbers. She said that they have prayed for her blessing and that she granted it, provided they swore a holy oath to her. She said that death would come for them if they harmed more villages, and they heeded her warning. She said something is driving them. Some new leader or influence."

"She wanted to know if something like that had appeared in America as well."

Morgan rubs his chin. "There..." he says, and then scratches his head. "If there is anything of the sort, I have yet to hear much about it. Just rumors and hints - and most of them from our friends here," he says, nodding to the man in the suit. "I was attacked in my home, but I've made enough enemies in my mortal life that I can't say for sure if _that_ had anything to do with it..." He shakes his head. "I will keep my eyes open."

The Russian woman has begun to speak in low tones, and the suit translates for her now. "She says there is something moving in Africa as well. She flew over the continent, apparently. The fortresses of local warlords were burned and deserted, like the army had come in. She says a man came to her one evening while she was resting, like he'd been waiting there. She says he had skin black as night and eyes like the stars. He said to her that they have had enough, and that he and his allies will be fighting back."

Morgan tilts his head. "Eyes like the stars?" he says, raising an eyebrow as he directs the question to the man in the suit. He sighs. "Well, things are stirring that are foreign to the world I thought I knew, that much is certain. We all, standing here, are proof enough of _that_."

Ricky laughs genially. "She and I get along well enough, but... these things worried both of us." His voice grows sober. "I think she's planning to leave soon. I'm going to keep at my work. If we need you, can we send Roger again?"

"We trust each other. I think we can trust you. But.. it's tough, not knowing who's the good guys, yah?"

Morgan nods slowly. "Who the good guys are... may be a matter of point of view. Nevertheless, those of us who know each other, we must stay in touch. The man in the suit, he and his friends seem to know where to find us... I don't know about Jet here, but I would probably find it hard to hide from them even if I tried, and right now I think I could use all the friends I can get."

"You guys could hide," observes the suit. "Just do me a favor and don't. Wastes my time and yours."

Morgan chuckles. "Wouldn't dream of it. I'd have to have a darn good reason to risk that the _wrong_ people would find me again before you did."

---

Roger is driving this time, and the group of demigods pile into the van. Detroit engineering roars to life, and the group leave the forgotten gas station behind. In the rear view mirror, Morgan - now sitting shotgun - can see the Russian and Ricky waving goodbye to them. Then the two figures are lost in the dust kicked up by the van's wheels.
