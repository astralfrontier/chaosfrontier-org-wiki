# Fall of Eden 2006-04-13

"http://www.myspace.com/lunaslight"

This is the address that sits in the Opera browser window. Becca sits and stares at the screen. A half-shocked, half-smiling expression is on her face, the look of the newly-accomplished who is thinking: I did this?

Behind her, standing, is Meyer. "Alright, young lady!" he says briskly, and points at the MacBook on the desk. "We have our anonymizing proxy set up now, so you can do whatever you like. If you have to restart, let me know. Otherwise, go ahead." Becca turns, nodnodding so fast her hair flies over her face. She grins and returns her attention to the keyboard. Concentration builds on her fingers as she begins typing, one finger after another jabbing down on the keys.

As Meyer leaves, Becca's words flow in a gently babbling river across the screen. She types and types, as she is accustomed to. Invisible daemons of electric automation correct her spelling as she types.

"September 15 is my birthday!!!!"

"Happy birthday to me! I'm 24 today. And I have a job. And I have dreams again!"

"Today I went to work for the FIRST TIME\*\*\* I was answering phones from where I am living now. I took orders for people! It's a phone ordering company and people call in to place orders out of a catalog. They pay by credit card number and I put in all their info on the computer."

"\* First time since I got here - I was so worried about finding a new job."

"\* First time I've ever done anything that PAID well."

"AND! \* First time I really felt like I was doing something useful for myself. I'm learning all kinds of things."

"Anyway, I should get going. Bye for now!"

---

Meyer leans back in his chair, and regards Jet with a knowing smile. The invitation came unexpectedly - 'meet in my office' - and Meyer didn't explain further at the time. Now, however, the Sidereal speaks.

"It's my obligation to tell you what's going on with your er, ward," he says. "Inasmuch as she is here of her own free will, it's not kidnaping and you are not legally liable. However, because her disappearance from her former locale could cause trouble - for her, for you, and for us - we've taken steps to ensure everyone's security."

"Barry seems to think he can find the perfect job for her in San Francisco. This is all well and good, provided her face doesn't show up on a milk carton or something similar. Do you understand, Jet?"

"Yeah, I imagine that would have its issues, wouldn't it?" muses Jet. She sighs softly and looks to Meyer seriously, "Maybe it'd be easier if we just told her parents where she was, though? Assuming she wants to, that is. Would that put whatever it is we're doing in danger? She wouldn't tell them anything beyond the bare minimum."

"That's your decision." Meyer reaches for his phone and holds it up as a prop of sorts. "I have them on speed-dial, if that's what you decide. There's another choice, though."

"What is the other choice?" asks Jet. She looks at the phone with a smirk, "You do plan ahead, don't you? It's almost annoying at times." She flicks a hand through her hair and sighs, waiting to hear what she hopes is a less awkward solution to the problem.

"The other choice is that we make her family and friends... less inclined to think about where she is," says Meyer, his eyes boring into Jet's. "This is very serious business, and I suggest it only if there's a chance that Becca can be traced here." He smiles, suddenly becoming his usual amiable self. "Or we just let her call her parents on her own, and explain things. Decide how likely you think that is, versus how necessary it is."

"I will talk to her about it," says Jet. "She has some say in this. If she wants to talk to them, that's fine. If she wants to visit them that's fine. I'm not going to keep her away, though I would prefer she stay here." Jet flexes a fist, knuckles cracking ominously, "I won't take kindly to anyone who causes her grief. I think you know that, though. I appreciate the help, as well. I would hate to have to cover her trail in more.. conventional methods. It's never as pretty."

Meyer smiles blandly. "The best-covered trail is one where nothing got stained, my dear," he observes.

Jet looks down at that statement and nods. "Too true," she says lamely. "I think I better talk to her soon and get the trail covered. For her, I think it best to have some contact with her family. Perhaps by a cell phone. Do you guys have a way to fake the location of one of those? In the interest of security."

Meyer just starts laughing.

"A simple yes would suffice," Jet points out.

At last he regains himself. "Who do you think we are," he says amidst fading giggles. "Of course. All our phones are anonymized here."

"I think you are a bunch of oddballs who collect others who might be of use," says Jet. She grins wryly, "It doesn't help that you picked me up, and you haven't a clue what you've gotten yourselves into. Mary probably has the best idea. She's seen a bit of what I'm capable of."

Meyer chuckles. "I prefer to think that we're levering a diverse array of resources toward a goal which requires a holistic approach. Or, in non-bullshit, 'when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail' is a warning against specialization."

Jet nods slowly, "I suppose. I hope you realize how restless I am getting. This is the longest I've stayed in one place since I was Chosen. It feels wrong somehow. I read a bit about myself. Tigers like to have a territory of about 400 square miles. I don't think tigers have access to bikes, though."

"Nor do tigers engage in discussions with Jews about the welfare of young adults," Meyer points out. "Usually the Jew got eaten."

"I don't think I'll ever be that hungry," retorts Jet. "I prefer mexican, anyway." She tries to get things a touch more serious, at least, "My wards aren't causing issues at all for anyone, are they? It seems that they are finding themselves. I don't know how, but it's obvious they are doing better here."

"If they came here, to this place, they were meant to be here," says Meyer with a smile. "Just as you were meant to be here. This house does not harbor coincidences."

Jet snorts and rolls her eyes. "More of that fate stuff, huh? No matter how we dress it up, what happens is the only thing that matters. What might have been is just a waste of thought," she says vehemently. "Our past is enough without entertaining ifs."

Jet has apparently had enough of this conversation. "I'm going to go talk to Becca," she says abruptly. "We can talk more later." But not about this.

---

Jet's rather hasty departure from Meyer isn't abnormal. Most conversations with her have a way of ending rather quickly as of late. Still, for all her moodiness with the Sidereals, she has kept her rougher side well away from her 'wards'. The Lunar doesn't think too much about her attitude with them at the moment. For now, she finds herself in the hall, pausing to listen. Timothy is asleep. Or he's faking very well. She pauses at Becca's door next, raising a hand to knock softly. "Becca, can I come in?"

The soft sound of humming can be heard from the other side of the door. It stops, and the girl's voice floats ethereally through the wood. "Um, come in?"

Jet slides into the room with a small smile. She settles herself back against the door, closing it behind her. "I'm glad I didn't wake you," the Lunar says gently. She looks over Becca slowly, drawing in a deeper breath to catch her scent, as well. Even slouching Jet's feline grace is somehow present, the tiger in her giving a sense of readiness in her every breath.

Becca is flopped out on her stomach, feet waving above her knees slowly. She's doodling in a notebook with a sketch pencil. Even from here, Jet can see the outline of a unicorn taking shape, walking across what might be a bridge. "It's okay, I was just drawing," the girl says with a smile. "Is everything okay?"

Jet strides across the floor to take a closer look before settling on her knees at the bedside, propping her elbows on the bed. "That's really pretty," Jet says warmly. "Oh, and everything should be fine. Meyer and I were just talking about some things. It's nothing to worry about." She pauses for a moment and reaches out, gliding her fingertips through the girl's hair. "I was wondering if you would like to talk to your parents and let them know you are okay. I know things are a bit crazy right now, and they probably don't want to hear you ran off with some biker chick, but if you do want to talk to them, we will certainly let you."

Becca flinches. Not at the touch, but at the words. She bites her lip and looks back at the sketchbook, continuing to pencil for several seconds without replying. Her eyes are averted; if the eyes are the windows to the soul, she is closing the blinds as best she can.

Jet doesn't seem put off by that. "You know you can tell me anything you want or need," she says softly. "There's no need to even worry about it right now, anyway. In fact, I'll make you a promise." She turns her head to try and meet Becca's eyes, "I won't mention this ever again. If you ever change your mind, let me know." She doesn't give Becca time to think too much about this point, though. "Are unicorns your favorite thing to draw?"

Becca shakes her head quickly, now freshly embarrassed. She slaps the sketchbook closed with a slapping noise, then sighs at herself. "Sorry.. I guess it's just kind of a girly thing to draw, huh?" she asks lamely. "But, I have dreams and I like to draw them. It's really fun."

"What's so girly about doing something you love?" asks Jet curiously. She looks to the sketchbook for a moment and nods to it, "I wish I could have dreams like that. Since I can't, I hope sometime you can share yours with me." Those searching eyes turn back to Becca's face then, and Jet's smile remains calm.

Becca looks up, mouth agape. Her eyes wander away from and back to Jet's for a few moments. "Well, uh.." She stammers a bit, finally grabbing hold of words. "I guess... Mr. Meyer said he has a scanner. I .. I could put them up on MySpace. Or.. uh.."

"I hate computers," Jet points out softly. "And hon, we're living together. I'd rather curl up on the couch with you and look them over together. I'd like to hear you talk about your dreams." She laughs gently and shakes her head. "There's no need to hide from me, Becca. I hope you know that you can always be honest with me. You also can tell me to go to hell if I'm being pushy or asking for something you aren't ready to give."

"Really?" The girl hesitates, grappling inwardly with this. She frowns, then, and only after several seconds does she respond. "I feel like... like you're _watching_ me, like, umm.. like you're going to ... I don't know. I feel I'm safe, but not like _it's_ safe. Does that make any sense?"

Jet looks thoughtful, trying to figure out what Becca might mean. She sighs quietly, doing the best she can. "The truth is things are happening that might make the world a lot less safe. From what little I understand, that is why I am what I am. There's a lot of things shifting in the background, just out of the corner of our sight. We don't know a lot about what we're up against yet, but I doubt they're trying to gear-up the Salvation Army." She keeps her eyes on Becca, "And I will protect you. No matter what."

Becca nods slowly. Something twists within her, reflecting itself in her eyes, and she flinches just a bit. Then: "What do you think I should do about my parents, Jet?"

Jet gets rather tired of her vantage point and crawls up to settle on her side by Becca. "I think until you can answer the question confidently, dear, we should put it off." She tries to help the girl think of other things, turning the conversation to something a bit more mundane. "So how is the new job going? It must be really exciting for you."

"Come on," she says, whining a bit. "This is important. I'm sorry I haven't done anything about it, but... really. What should I do?"

Jet sighs softly and shrugs, "I don't know your parents. If they are cool, I'd tell them right away. If they are going to try to make you come home.." She frowns and snorts dismissively, "Well, I'd really rather you stay. I've grown rather attached." She playfully musses up the girl's hair. Her words are serious, though. "For now, relax, and think on it. You don't have to figure these things out on the spur of the moment, anyway. I'd say it's best that you do talk to them sometime soon, but it doesn't have to be tonight, nor tomorrow. You are just getting your feet under you."

Becca nods. "I guess.... I will call them. But not tonight. Okay?" She glances over at Jet, eyes searching her face for approval.

Jet nods quickly, "I think that's a very good decision, Becca." She sighs gently and lets her smile return to full dazzle. "So for now, we just relax. Oh, Meyer tells me you've been racing around on the internet doing all sorts of things. I hope you have all you need here."

"Sure!" Becca's happy grin returns now that the weight has been lifted, at least for the moment. "Umm, I set up a MySpace page, and um, Mr. Meyer showed me about the Orderscan that I'm using on the job. And I tried out the Navispace page, you know the one that shows you photos of the streets in your city?"

Jet hasn't a clue about computers, nor the net. She still listens closely, filing away what she's told, even if it doesn't mean anything to her right now. Becca cares about it, and that's really enough for her. Something there catches her imagination, though. "It shows you photos of streets? Can you see people and things like that? Oh, and is MySpace that place where people chat and pick people up for.. umm, you know?" she asks curiously.

"Oh, they ban those people," says Becca, unconcernedly. "And Mr. Meyer told me about what _not_ to post. Like my name, or photos outdoors, or stuff like that. I'll be careful. Aaaaaaaaanyway, they have some really neat photos of the Bridge." In San Francisco, there can be only one 'The Bridge'. "Sooo, I was using those as the backdrop for this sketch.." She hauls out the sketchbook, opening it to the unicorn picture again.

"Oh wow," says Jet. Now that she can get a closer look at it, she's able to pick out more details. "That's a great idea. Mixing an element of fantasy with the modern day." She laughs at herself and suggests, "I'm afraid I'm not very well book smart, Becca. I like the picture, even if I'm not really very great with fancy words." She doesn't dwell on that, of course, immediately asking, "So you dream of these images?"

Becca nods slowly. "Is that okay?" she asks, voice tinged with apprehension once again.

Jet nods, "A lot better than anything I have dreamt of," she says. "If it makes you happy, Becca, and it doesn't hurt people, it's got to be okay, right?" The Lunar runs a hand through her hair, futilely trying to keep the locks from spilling like a veil over her eyes. "Oh, I still owe you a road trip, too. Something fun to do. We should celebrate your new job, don't you think?"

"That'd be fun!" Becca grins. "Umm, there's all kinds of stuff I saw while I was online. Places to go, and um, there's a rare-books store and art gallery, like three stories tall, downtown. Can we go there sometime? And.."

Jet lets the girl go on. And on. Finally she laughs softly and suggests, "How about we make a day of it, then. We can check a few places out, and then maybe hit up a concert. I have a feeling I can land some good tickets, even on short notice."

"Okay!" Becca rolls onto her side, lunging towards Jet with a tight hug. Unfortunately she overbalances, and both fall to the bedroom floor with paired 'oof!'s.

Jet certainly didn't expect that. She doesn't land like a cat, though she does shield Becca from most of the impact as the Lunar lands on her back. She finds her arms wound around Becca and she laughs softly, "I am glad you are looking forward to it, too. I think we'll have a lot of fun. I have a few ideas for the later hours. Hmm, I should probably check out your myspace to see if I can get a few more hints for things we can do together." She impulsively kisses Becca on the cheek, "Seeing you so happy makes me feel so good. Is that too girly?"

"Nope!" giggles Becca. She lifts herself up and involuntarily yawns. "But... I'm tired now."

Jet sighs softly and nods. She has no hands to muffle her yawn, which follows Becca's like magic. "I hate sleeping," she mutters. "The worst part is a cold bed, isn't it? The floor here is more comfortable I think." The Full Moon stretches out, her muscles drawing into powerful cords under Becca for just a moment before resting once more.

Becca extracts herself from Jet's arms and crawls up on her bed. She looks back and says, "Your bed is that bad? Mine's really comfortable." She adds less confidently, "You could sleep here tonight. I mean, it's no big deal, right?"

Jet lingers for a moment on the floor, looking thoughtful. "I suppose it isn't, really." She does have her own rules about it, though, which is why she changes into one of Becca's night gowns before sliding under the covers. After a few more eager thoughts of what to do tomorrow, Becca drifts off. Sleep comes slower to Jet, and she fights it, losing at last when Becca's soft breathing sends her drifting off.
