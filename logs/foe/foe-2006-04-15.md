# Fall of Eden 2006-04-15

Rather than simply driving the group back, the anonymous Sidereal explains his proposal to Jet, Poe, and Roger. "We're gonna find this 'Santa Muerte', this 'Saint Death' person. I'll be frank with you. Those three in San Fran? I don't trust them. And if you do, that's great. If you don't, best you know allies who aren't tied up with them."

Jet snorts, "I don't trust much of anybody these days. It's always good to have another contact, anyway. Still, two of those three haven't really done too much to make me suspect them, even if I don't precisely like them at the moment."

With no objections, the group resume their drive. Stops at small diners, grocery stores, and similar staples of rural America keep them fed and maintained. The Sidereal always pays, and always in cash.

Their goal is east, always east, along the highways and back roads. Sometimes the van will stop for no apparent reason, or pull under an underpass. Sometimes the driver will divert off-road entirely, parking in a barn.

On this last such occasion, he simply shrugs by way of explanation and says: "Satellites."

---

The trip through west Texas is remarkably dull. It's simply a lot of land, and most of it with few people. When asked about the area, Jet shows little knowledge. Her time was spent in Houston, and occasionally she'd hit Dallas, as well. This was never her turf. As the great expanse of the Lone Star State is traversed, civilization becomes more obvious. When Houston is within a few hours, Jet says, "I'd like a little time to myself. I have a few things to attend to."

Morgan raises an eyebrow curiously. With a smile, he asks, "Are you going to be as mysterious as our friend here about that?" gesturing to the man in the suit.

Jet looks to Poe curiously, "Well, it's rather a private thing." She looks out the window, watching the miles pass by, "It's rather lucky we are going this way, honestly. I need maybe a day or two. I have a feeling you'll know where to find me." She guides the Man's course in Houston, arranging to have herself dropped off at a club called 'The St. James', on Rankin Road. "If I hear nothing else, I'll meet you two here in a couple days, okay? Otherwise, it'll be you finding me." She looks to the vallet's near the club and then back to Poe and the Man, "Maybe you guys can check out the place where I used to work later. I think you are a bit too busy right now, though."

"A private thing..." Poe murmurs, still puzzled. "Jet, I can understand if you want to keep things to yourself, but..." He chuckles wryly.. "Well, this is a chance I can't pass up, d'you see? This sort of place is... well, if it's to do with your old line of work, it's a place of professional interest to me. And it's always handy to have a contact on the inside at times like this." He winks at Jet.

Jet looks back at Poe, already having stepped out. "You want to see where I used to work, hmm?" She looks hesitant for a moment, then seems to find the idea somehow very amusing. There's a sparkle of mischief in her eye. "Alright. I suppose you've never seen one of these places. This is one of the best, and we'll meet some friends of mine who can help us out. I have some things I want to pick up from this place, too." She looks to The Man, "So how about you? Do you mind a little delay? I can cut down the time, and be ready to go tomorrow night."

The Sidereal shakes his head. "Do what you need. Finding Saint Death will be days, if we're lucky."

Morgan laughs as opens the side door and drops to the ground. He's about to remark that of _course_ he's seen places like this before, but... something makes him decide otherwise. For once, he would like to seem a little more innocent that he is. He lets the chuckle pass unexplained, and simply says, "Lead on then, Jet..."

"Then let's go inside, Poe. Should be verrry educational." Jet laughs a little and wags a finger, "Just make sure to not cause trouble, okay? These are people I know, and they'll expect you to be on your very best behavior, even if they aren't." She does her best to keep Poe's attention on her, and not on the signs that might let him know just what he's getting into. "Oh, and the food here is great, too," she adds as the heavy, oaken door is drawn open by a large man with no discernible neck.

Inside, the club is gently lit, remarkably dark after the dazzling light of a Texas day. There's a lot of loud music, and a stage dead ahead, with many little tables set about it. To the right and to the left, there are small stages with poles on them, and on each are topless women. To the right and left of the main stage are bars. Jet ignores all this and makes for a table right by the stage, gesturing to a padded chair and settling herself down on another across from it.

Morgan can't keep the blush from his cheeks, but he can keep from staring at the women as they make their living - although he remembers that he's supposed to be new to places like this, and makes a play of having a hard time refraining from staring. As he settles down into the chair, he's surprised that he has no trouble at all sounding hesitant as he asks, quietly enough not to be heard very far over the music, "So... uh... you used to work in a place like _this_?"

Jet shakes her head at Poe. "I worked at this place, actually," she corrects. "You have any idea how much money a girl can make doing this?" She grins impishly, letting herself relax. It seems she's remembered here, and an ill-aimed bra is cast from the stage onto the table by a slender, white dancer. "So welcome to the St. James, Poe. I hope you have a nice time." She herself shamelessly watches the dancer, noting, "Eye contact is one of the most powerful tools of a dancer. It lets her connect to her audience, and to see what your intentions are. Looking away is a polite way of declining. Keeping focused, though, is an invitation. Amy is very good, don't you think?"

"A... valuable insight," Poe remarks, still hesitant. He looks up in the direction the bra had apparently been thrown from, and only the briefest glance below neck level makes it clear that yes, this is probably the woman who threw the bra. He looks back up again, gives the woman a bashful smile in return, then returns his attention to Jet. "Very good indeed," he agrees, letting his voice quaver a little. "So you have unfinished business here?" he asks conversationally.

"No, really I was just stopping here to get a ride to where I have my business," says Jet. "And to get some information to help me get there in one piece." The girl on the stage-Amy-is currently doing crawling across the stage, making right for Jet. The Lunar draws out a few one dollar bills, folding each and building something of a house shape on the stage as she watches the dancer. "We need a car to use, and a place to crash. Fortunately Amy is working, so we're probably in good shape." More loudly, she calls out, "Looking very sex, Amy Lynn. Now work that ass for us!" The Jet in here is far less restrained, and the girl on stage laughs, all too eager to do as she's told. She calls over her shoulder, "Haven't seen you in a while..and back with a friend?" She can't say more, as another tip waits across the stage, drawing Amy away. "We'll have some private time later," Jet says. Her attention settles back on Morgan, then. "So, you want something to drink?"

Morgan can't help but laugh, this time - Jet's bawdy remark to her former co-worker catches him by surprise. "Sure... what do they have on tap?" he says, reaching for his wallet, and then pauses. "Oh, crap," he says. "Short of cash." And of course he can't use his credit cards while he's officially 'missing', as Jet well knows.

"Oh, don't worry, we'll be fine here," assures Jet. She raises a hand, making a circle in the air when a girl near the bar notices her. The dancer raises an eyebrow, but in moments plays the part of waitress, bringing over three glasses and a pitcher of beer. The dancer hesitates a moment, then decides to casually settle herself in a chair between Jet and Morgan. "I didn't expect to see you around here, Jet," comes the girl's deep purring voice. "I have had to stay away for a while, and I won't be around long. Poe, this is Michelle. Michelle, this is Poe. Now that that is handled.." She reaches out to fill glasses, then settles back after drinking deep. "You need a favor, I suppose," says Michelle, doing her best to seem suspicious, but unable to hide her grin. "Maybe you want me to show your friend a good time, too? Texan hospitality, sir, is something I consider myself a master of." The dancer straightens in her chair, striking the very ideal stuck-up pose.

The posing lasts only until Jet reaches over to snap the girl's thong. "Yeah, you definitey are hospitable. I can remember a few times.." Jet grins widely. "Trust me, Poe, you probably want to start out with someone a little easier to handle than this one."

Morgan laughs appreciatively at Michelle's prima donna pose. "Thanks for the warning, Jet," he says, taking a sip of his own beer. "Sorry, Michelle - the den mother says no," he remarks with a smile. Bashful or not, he's going to show every sign of recovering from the initial 'surprise', and he'll be darned if he's going to let Jet out-banter him.

Jet sighs softly and leans back, "Well, let's see.. three stages up. It'll be at least 20 before Amy is free. How long have you been here today, and are you on the list?" Michelle shakes her head, "I just got here about an hour ago. They haven't needed me yet. I have already made over a hundred bucks, though, so I'm good to sneak out before they figure it out, if you wanted to have a more private party." Jet's eyes are still drifting about the place, sorting through dancers she knows and does not. After all, there are hundreds of girls who use the place. "So I suppose the whole trio is here?" asks the Lunar curiously. "Nope. Naomi is back home, sleeping. She just got done handling a big test. She's in one of those online things now, working on a degree." Michelle seems most interested in Poe, watching his every move closely.

Morgan takes being scrutinized with casual ease. His guess is that this Michelle knows that Jet is a tough nut to crack, and so she's going to see if _he'll_ let slip any indication of what Jet is up to. She's doomed to disappointment, of course - and would be, he tells himself, even if he _did_ have any idea. He occasionally makes a point of catching Michelle watching him, and turning his gaze away as if embarrassed - but mostly, he lets Jet control the situation, and pays most of his attention to her.

Jet sighs at Michelle's silliness and, noticing that her friend is about to run her leg against Poe's, decides to control things a little more closely. She turns those powerful eyes of hers to Michelle and points at her lap. The girl smiles sheepishly and settles where Jet orders and looks down apologeticly. "Now, behave," the Lunar orders. "Morgan doesn't have any tips for you, so leave him be." Poe probably hasn't seen a lot of grown women pout, much less do so dressed as Michelle is. Still, Jet is kind, and slides a twenty under Michelle's thong, quieting her. "When Amy is done with her rounds, we're going to get out of here," Jet says. "After that, we'll finish up with my business and we'll be on our way with our odd friend. That sound good to you?" Her words are of course directed to Poe.

"You seem to have a penchant for odd friends," replies Poe, smiling as he nods in agreement.

Jet nods slowly, "I suppose you might say that. Michelle is a real sweety though, once you get some clothes on her." The dancer sniffs, but her sulky lookd doesn't last long. She's giggling and doing her best not to squirm. Jet's tickling her. The time passes rather quickly. There are lots of dancers, and most have some redeeming qualities. Still, it seems that few are quite as attractive as Amy or Michelle. Jet picked the most attractive to have as friends, it would seem, though she does know a few of the others. Most seem to be too new. When it's all said and done, Amy is free some forty minutes later, and then in a few more minutes everyone is neatly stuffed into a crappy cab and on the way towards what turns out to be a rather nice apartment complex.

Once the four reach the destination, Jet can let her hair down and relax. Not like she was exactly tense before. "You know, we didn't expect you to come back," notes Amy. "You kinda burned your bridges," adds Michelle. Naomi, a girl of clearly Latino descent, lifts her head from the couch where she was sleeping, "Oh wow. Is this some sorta weird dream?" Jet handles this all with a shrug, "I had to come back. It's the 20th of September." This seems to make the girls uneasy, and they look away, none of them really sure what to do or say. "Well, make yourselves at home. Sit down, relax.. there's plenty of day left, and there's a storm on the way." Michelle is eager to turn the conversation away from Jet's reason for being here.

Morgan will not be the one to bring up the subject. He may be here on Jet's name, but he's still an outsider here, and he knows a sensitive subject when he sees one. The significance of this day to the four women, he feels sure, will make itself known soon enough - or else he can ask Jet later. "Don't mind if I do," he says to Michelle aloud, then glancing at Jet to see if she intends to relax just yet.

Jet will go and settle down in front of the TV. Naomi wasn't watching much, just some random crappy movie on HBO. The girl doesn't seem willing to give up any couchspace. At least until Amy slaps her on the butt. With an indignant squawk Naomi sits up, pulling a blanket up to keep herself decently covered. Ironic considering her job. "So how long will can we keep you here, Jet?" asks Michelle. The Lunar lets out a sigh, having to drift back to reality, "Only a day or two. We weren't really supposed to stop here, but this is one commitment I'd like to keep. It's the least I can do." Amy tsks softly, but her attention is back on Poe, a hopeful look in her eyes. She expects something of him, it seems.

Morgan settles back into the sofa. Everyone keeps looking at him, it seems. This is more than just curiosity, he realizes - the girls all know what brought Jet back, and rather they seem to expect _him_ to play some role. He raises an eyebrow at Amy in return, with a little non-committal smile, and resolves that asking Jet what's going on is going to come sooner rather than later.

"Anyway, we should shower," says Michelle, looking to Amy meaningfully. "And you should go study." It seems that the issue is being forced. And before Poe's imagination can go too far, Naomi's teasing remark makes it clear, "You two better not use up all the hot water fooling around. I have to clean up before I go drop off my test in the mail." She at least gets the hint, and it seems Jet has no desire to stop them from ducking away for now. She sighs softly and shakes her head, explaining, "They think we're lovers."

Morgan chuckles. "Kept under cover..." he sings, recalling the lyrics to a popular Bonnie Raitt song. Still in jovial tones, he goes on, "Well, now, since we've got a moment to ourselves..." His expression becomes more serious. "What's special about September 20? It's obviously important to you all."

Jet frowns at the question, even though she was expecting it. For a while she doesn't answer, first getting up to mute the TV. "Two of my best friends died on the 20th of September, and every year on that day I go to their grave." She wears a strange, sad smile as she looks up to Poe, "They were twins."

Morgan nods slowly. "I see," he says softly, stepping a bit closer. "I'm sorry to hear that..." It's a cliche, to be sure, but some things have to be said, no matter how predictable they may be.

Jet nods and lets out a soft sigh. There's obviously more to it, but that she isn't spilling so easily. "Yeah, even though it's been a while, it's still hard, ya know? It was like losing my family in one day. Since then, I've really never felt quite right about anything. I sometimes hope that things have changed somehow. Since the Silver Lady came. I don't know if it really has, though."

"They _have_ changed, Jet," says Poe. "But they can't all change at once. I've hardly even begun to understand what's happened to me. You've obviously had a little longer to learn what it means to be touched by the Moon... but one thing is clear to me already. Things won't be right unless we _make_ them right."

"How can you change the past?" asks Jet seriously. "Nothing I can do helps with things like this. I am just more of what I was, not really different. I am just stronger now, I guess." She shrugs and leans forward, cradling her chin in a hand, her elbow settled on her knee. "In the important ways, we aren't so different now. And in many ways we are different. What does that really mean, though? We're still the same people, right?"

Morgan scratches his own head. "It seems to me that we have to trust our instincts. You especially, I think. If you feel something is 'not quite right' since they died... I think that sounds a bit stronger than just grief. It sounds like their loss means something _more_ is wrong. And maybe... maybe being 'you, but stronger now' is just what you need to make _that_ right."

"I don't really want to think about it much more right now," admits Jet. She can hear laughter from the shower, and Naomi's shouting about wasting the hot water is pretty clear to hear. "We just need to go to the cemetary and we'll be done with this, then we can move on," the Lunar insists.

Morgan nods. "All right," he says. "But I've seen my share of grief - you _will_ have to think about it sometime. It won't go away until you do. Perhaps now isn't the time, not yet..." _And perhaps it is,_ he adds to himself. _But that's not my decision._

Jet nods and leans back, putting things on the shelf so easily. At least for now. "Michelle and Amy seem to be done," she murmurs. She pauses, catches something with her ears, and then sighs, "Nevermind, they are still busy." She laughs quietly and says, "I hope you don't mind. My world is pretty weird to you, I imagine. You have to understand, in my old job, this is really pretty normal. Anyway, they will be busy for a while, and they probably are expecting us to go handle the visit without them. They know I usually go alone."
