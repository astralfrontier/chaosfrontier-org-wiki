# Fall of Eden 2006-04-16

With the others occupied in one way or another, Jet decides that she will just go ahead and handle her business. Curiously enough, transportation is not at all an issue. The Lunar calls back to Poe over her shoulder, "I hope you don't mind riding. I have a bike in their garage still. Other things, as well, I imagine. We probably should clear everything out eventually."

"Riding's fine with me," says Poe. "Just try not to drop me," he adds with a chuckle.

Jet laughs softly, "I don't think that will be a problem. Just hold on tight, I don't have a bitch bar on this ride." The garage Jet opens with bored ease, and just as she raises it the rumbling of a building storm can be heard. Inside the garage a small sports coupe is parked, rust free, but looking rather worn nonetheless. In a corner ahead of it sets the bike. Jet draws the cover from it, revealing a Kawasaki ZX-6RR. It's a neon green model, quite flashy. Jet pauses to pick up an umbrella and stows it away in the bike before turning it about and starting to walk it out.

Jet tosses Poe a helmet, tugging one on for herself as well. "Safety first, right?" she murmurs, half-teasing him. She will wait for him to get on behind her, then start on her way. She's not going to do anything flashy. Her mind is already busy enough as it is. Poe shouldn't be surprised that she seems to know every shortcut there is, and dodges traffic with practiced ease.

The place they are going is Spring Cemetary. Jet drives slowly past the silent stones, the white shapes sticking from the ground like hundreds of teeth. In the gloom of the overcast sky, night is coming far faster than normal to Harris County. Stopping in a place much like any other, Jet steps away from the bike. "Stay here for a bit. I won't be long." With that, Jet walks away, leaving her helmet dangling from the handlebars. Above, a louder growling as the storm at last has come, and with it the first drops of rain.

Morgan is still taking off the helmet. "Hmm?" he manages, before Jet starts walking away. Putting his helmet on the handlebars too, he takes a step forward, but she's already well ahead. "You still want to be alone, do you..." he says, half to himself.

Jet can be seen still, though in the darkness it's likely she'll soon be hard to make out. She seems to have stopped about fifty yard away, under the boughs of a tree. One large stone is set in front of her. The wind sends her hair streaming about her face, and she pushes it away. The first drops of rain, heavy and cool, start to fall, but as is the way in Houston, it goes swiftly from a few drops, to nothing, and then suddenly Poe will find he has need of the umbrella, as the rain pours down.

Morgan finally catches up with Jet, but stands a respectful distance away. He doesn't put the umbrella up at first, being used to Seattle's steady but light drizzles - it isn't until the torrential downpour of a Gulf Coast rainstorm begins to beat down on him that he finally unfurls the thing. And still he stands quietly. Nothing he can say would be as meaningful as what Jet is seeing now - whatever that may be.

Jet doesn't seem to notice Poe is there. Her mind is elsewhere. She has her eyes focused on that stone, and after a time, her fists clench and she starts to shake. Whatever it is she feels, it does not seem to have lost its power over her. Poe can perhaps see that her jaw is moving, but any words she might be saying are lost in the rain as it pours down, the locks darkened s they are drenched through.

Morgan will step closer now. As he draws close enough, he moves sideways, until he's halfway between Jet and the stone, a few feet off to one side. He's watching Jet rather than the stone now... and surely she can see him now, if she has eyes for anything but the past now. He watches her for a few moments more... finally, he murmurs, "Jet..." so softly that the sound of the rain upon his umbrella would almost drown it out... but he knows _she_ at least could hear it. If she's listening.

Jet turns to look at Poe, and on the slippery turn she stumbles, catching herself just barely before she sprawls. For just a moment, as she looks up at Poe, there's something else there, the usual casual veil of cockiness absent. She's vulnerable here. "You shouldn't have come," she says at last, looking back to the stone. The inscription is rather curious, and the lightning's illumination reveals it: Born of love on the same day, November 1 1976. Taken in love on the same day, September 20 1996.

"I know," says Poe quietly. "But I had to see." The story of his life, really. To go where he was not supposed to be, just because he had to know... something. He drops his eyes and looks at the stone again.

Jet pushes herself up, raising a muddy hand to her eyes. She shakes her head, letting out a deep sigh. "We shouldn't stay here too much longer." Her words sound hollow, and it's clear that part of her wants to stay. Or perhaps part of her thinks she ought to stay. "It's funny, though, isn't it? They always say time heals all wounds. It doesn't hurt any less now than that day."

Morgan shakes his head. "No... it doesn't, does it..." To say any more would intrude on her grief; any reporter, no matter how nosy, has to learn how far is too far.

Jet turns away from the stone and half walks, half stumbles towards the bike. "I'm done here," she says quietly. "I used to stay longer, but it doesn't do any good." She stops by the bike, needing a moment to regain herself, though she still seems rather unsettled.

Morgan returns quietly with Jet to the bike. And as she leans against it, he holds out the umbrella, letting it shade her, as the rain pours down on him instead. Still no words; instead, it is actions which say 'You need this more than I do.'

Jet lets out a deep sigh and looks back at Poe, "Let's get out of this place." She casts her leg across the bike, pulling herself into position. The helmet she only dimly remembers to put on her head before turning the key and firing up the engine. "We should get back before we die of pneumonia out here."

The drive back is a little bit more eventful. Thankfully, the storm vanishes quite as abruptly as it came on the way back, though it finds its fire once again just as the bike is wheeled back into its garage. Above, the apartment light is on, and Naomi is waiting at the door. Apparently she isn't going to go out tonight after all. She even has towels in her hands. The dancer knows her friend well enough, it seems. "So did you find what you were looking for?" she asks, her dark eyes moving from Jet to Poe curiously.

Morgan glances in Jet's direction, and shakes his head slightly. He doesn't answer out loud - that is for Jet to do, if she wishes - but from what he saw, she didn't find what she was looking for. Not today, at least.

"Just the same thing I always find," says Jet quietly. Naomi ushers both of them inside, shutting-out the night. Inside, the smell of food cooking is strong, as Amy prepares a meal. "There's a bath drawn," says Michelle. "Feel free to use it as you want. There are more towels there, as well." From the kitchen, "It'll be about 45 minutes before it's all ready!" There seems to be something of a procedure in handling Jet after these visits, and these three girls are no strangers to it.

Morgan wraps himself in the towel, and lets Jet go on past him. Whatever the other girls think, Jet hasn't opened herself to him - at least not of her own accord - and after the graveyard, he intends to give her whatever privacy she wants. If she needs some time alone now, then that is what she'll have.

The night begins quietly. The girls seem to know how to bring Jet slowly out of her downward spiral. At first they simply leave her be, then, when Jet finally joins everyone in front of the TV, they just accept her quietly, occasionally bringing her into conversation. Before the night is over, things return essentially to normal, though there is some distance left between Jet and those around her. This is the first time she's been at the cemetary since she was changed. That seems to mean something to her, though what is obviously still eluding her. One this is clear, those here care for her, and they will not pressure her to reveal anything until she's ready to do so on her own terms.
