# Fall of Eden 2006-04-30

The apartment is quiet. At five in the morning, only the insomniac would be awake. Jet looks around through eyes still half-closed by sleep, reading the signs of her somnolent struggle in the bedsheets and blankets she was resting on. The nightmare recedes spitefully from her thoughts, unwilling to give up the territory it so recently claimed.

"Ah shit," mutters Jet softly. She pushes herself up and lets out a deep sigh. She doesn't even try again. She's just grateful that the night is finally over with. At least enough for her to get up for a while. She heads towards a window, taking a peek outside as a matter of habit, though she's careful not to let too much light in.

There's enough cloud-cover to suggest recent rain, but nothing definite. Something about her presence close to the window sparks a nameless instinct, buried deep. There's a vague sense of unease, but nothing more.

Jet draws back with a frown. She pauses to think a moment, and decides to trust herself. She will make her way towards the entry room of the apartment, carefully pausing in front of the large sliding glass door that allows one to reach the second story balcony. She strains to listen there. She is not known by many here any more, but of those who remember her, most are not friendly.

The air is still. Beyond and behind the silence of early morning, Jet hears something else. She hears a voice, but not in words. It does not drown out the quiet; indeed, were the morning to make a sound of its own, the voice would vanish. It is the voice of Tiger, and it tells her that hunters are approaching.

Jet turns away from the door quickly and heads back to the room she had been sleeping in. She makes a note of everyone being here. One by one she wakes them, careful to place a hand over each mouth in turn. Whispered orders are simple. "Get dressed, avoid the windows, and gather things you can't leave behind. And don't leave this room until I tell you." She won't be more specific yet. She leaves them to that task, pulling on what clothes she has to wear quickly and checking her gun. She moves out into the main room again, creeping over to the door silently and listening there, as well.

Morgan, for his part, struggles into wakefulness - Jet's urgency communicates itself to him quickly. From his first encounter with Jet, he knows his ability in a fight is limited. Instead, he kneels quietly beside the sleeping bag he'd spent the night in, poised to flee in whatever direction Jet indicates.

Jet sighs softly at the door. She moves away from it again, into the kitchen. She's not an expert with knives by any means, but she takes them anyway, also grabbing the purses of her friends. They will want them, and ID is not the kind of thing she wants left behind. She cases the room carefully, then sneaks back to the bedroom, handing over what she has collected, but offering little explanation. "Something is wrong. We're going to have to get out of here in a hurry." Seeing the nervousness of the girls Jet smiles, "I'm afraid it's going to be another Jet incident, babes." Her casual confidence is designed to ease the nerves, but Jet is surprised to realize she is not faking. She's not afraid. She's eager to see who is going to try their luck against her today.

In the moment of scared silence that follows, Jet can hear Wolf's voice as well, telling her to look after her pack.

Jet's eye catches the flash of light that signals a car's headlights - the vehicle is pulling in and killing the lights as quickly as it can.

Jet lets out a low growl. "I am going to deal with them now. Get yourselves to the car. We'll meet on the way back. I'm afraid it's not safe here." She looks to Poe. "You know the way back. Guide them there, and do what you can. My hunt starts now. Stop at that one burger joint we hit just outside of Houston. If I'm not there in two hours, keep going. I will catch up."

Tiger sounds a sudden alarm. The car was not the first arrival. Gunshots shatter the window, sending glass splinters all over the front room and carving out a gap. A grenade comes sailing through the gap a moment later.

Jet is no mortal, and the normal limitations of sight, motion, and action simply do not apply. She catches the vision of the explosive, and though her mind is surprised, her body reacts automatically, and with a smooth motion she reaches out grasping the weapon for a moment, and casting it back out at her foes in the next. She does not wait for the explosion, but instead rises to turn her wrath upon those who would attack her.

From the bedroom, the faint sounds of a chainsaw can be heard.

Jet has not been attacked this seriously in a long time. Then she was alone, now she has to worry about other things. She looks thoughtful a moment, and then makes her choice. First, she has to protect her pack. And already the vengeful Full Moon feels her strength gathering. She rushes back to the bedroom and waits. The chainsaw is an unwise thing to use. It makes noise. For her senses, that noise is every bit as effective to spot a foe as vision. She shoots at chest level, three times through the wall. Once for the chainsaw, and twice for those that are likely trying to protect him. "Change of plans. We're leaving together."

The sound of the chainsaw lessens - Jet can almost feel the instinctive flinch response from the wielder - but it is only a way to buy time and create caution, not to disable or kill. This is not a safe place to be.

The sound of the chainsaw tearing at the walls, punctuated by the enormous explosion of the grenade outside, following by still more unguided gunfire, is enough to put a panic in the strippers. Michelle and Amy tug Naomi back from the wall, looking like they want to join her in screaming, but are simply too terrified. They had heard Jet's stories, and knew it was dangerous to be near her, but it was attractive before. Now that danger is all too real.

Morgan is shaken by the blast, but only mutters, "Goddammit, not _again_."

Jet has no time to be afraid. She is all frantic activity. She leaps onto the dresser and with a grunt slams her fists up into the ceiling, tearing the dry wall down in a shower of dust. She takes hold of Naomi first, pushing her up through the gap she's opened, and swiftly the other two are cast upward. Jet gives Poe little time to argue the point either. She goes up last, and with a sharp gesture demands silence. "Stay here for a moment. I'm going to get their attention again."

Jet counts off the distance in her head to get past the wall and above and behind her enemies. She reaches back, gesturing for the others to start heading her way. The space above the ceiling is not spacious, and it's very hot, the air stuffy and dusty. Fortunately, it opens up more near this central area. Jet leans down where she is and begins to carefully cut a hole in the ceiling below, needing just a bit to see who is in the room below. With the noise of the chainsaw and all the dust it throws in the air, a little most drywall dust is not likely to be noticed by anyone.

Jet looks thoughtful for a moment, then turns back to her pack. She knows they are not up for this fight. She also knows that soon that hole behind them will be discovered. She has no time to waste. She crawls behind the rearmost cover and holds her knife in her right hand and in her left, her gun. She begins first by carefully cutting a little ways into the drywall, weakening a spot even more for her descent. She measures her fall in her mind, and with a deep breath, pushes herself first up in the air using the bracing of the solid planks of the ceiling, and then lets gravity pull her through the gap she just weakened. She aims to land right behind the rear guard, and swings down the knife, seeking to slam that blade right through the back of his neck even as she lands, raising her gun to open fire on the other gunmen.

The rear guard opens his mouth in shock, but with a spine severed, his lungs and throat no longer pay much mind to his will. The men at the wall fall to gunfire in moments. It seems that the panic in the others is useful for a change, as only a heartbeat passes before the strippers and jumping down after Jet. Each are caught with care, and even Poe is given that careful attention. She will not let her pack be harmed. She also knows that they have little time.

The dead men get a quick study, and Jet pulls away with a pair of keys. Like so many, the keychain includes a security transmitter. She won't have to guess which car she is going to steal. "We're leaving. Let's move!" urges Jet. She won't use the front door. The men coming in the hall might notice. She uses the balcony instead, leaping down from it lightly and turning to those following her. The fall, some fifteen feet, is likely far more formidible to them. Jet can't lend them her power, but she can catch them as they swing over the balcony. By this point, pure adrenaline is guiding them.

As the strippers go on ahead, Morgan pauses only for a moment, taking a handkerchief from his pocket and picking up the gun that Jet's hapless victim had dropped. The way he carries it, as he follows behind Jet and her pack, might indicate to a trained observer that the main goal is to _have_ the gun, not to _use_ it.

Morgan also pauses just long enough to slip a hand into the man's pocket and lift his wallet. Will there be any ID? Maybe not - but there might be something else in there he can use. Traces of drugs on the currency, anything. Fingerprints, if nothing else.

When the pack is down, Jet turns to find her car. It's not parked close, but fortunately the range of the security key is strong enough to pick it up. It's a lot over, and in moments, Jet has everyone inside and is quietly sneaking into the early morning traffic, heading away from the roaring sirens. Heading away from the city as quickly as she can.

"Who.. who was that?" asks Naomi nervously. She sits nearest Jet in the front, looking pale and trembling. Somewhere along the way, she broke one of her heels, and she looks understandably out of sorts. Michelle and Amy are crowded in the front as well. It's a bit foolish, but in the circumstances, Jet isn't going to suggest they stop to get seating arrangements a bit smarter. The car is big enough to make it more or less comfortable anyway. Jet notices a cell phone is in the car and has the sense to turn it off.

"I have no idea," answers Jet quietly. She slides an arm around Naomi, squeezing her shoulder reassuringly. "You are safe now, though. We're going to get out of here. We're going to California. We can't take any more chances here. I'm not sure they will leave you alone." She sighs and runs a hand through her hair, trying to think clearly. "I hope that our partner can find us. We will be wanting a new set of wheels soon."

Morgan is going through the wallet, though the dim lighting in the car makes it hard to make out much. "Well, when we can get stopped and I can get some proper light, we might be able to get some answers on the 'who', at least. If we're lucky. Can someone check the glove box?"

Amy waits for Jet's nod to do as Poe suggests. She's obviously rather nervous about touching anything. The box contains the usual paperwork. A car manual, an insurance card, a registration. All these are passed back to Morgan.

Jet spends her time planning her the way in her mind. She's going to sneak out of town, and if the Man is going to find her, it won't be on the interstate. She's using county highways that she learned from her less legal jobs in the past. She would rather not turn to that former occupation for help, but at least this way she can dodge the cops, and use the myriad of dusty roads to keep out of sight. In the back of her mind, she reflects that even she couldn't find herself travelling this way. "I think we'll be able to stay out of sight pretty well. We'll stick to travelling by night for a few days. There's enough cash between us for a few stops."

"And then what?" asks Naomi quietly. It isn't accusing. It's just a question, from a woman who doesn't have the answer.

"There's a place we can all stay in California," answers Jet. "I didn't mean to drag you into this, but it's not safe for you to go back." She looks to her friends and watches them closely, "I'm going to take care of you. There's a lot of clubs out west, and if you want, you won't even need to do that sort of work anymore." She seems to take this all so calmly. Part of her is even grateful for it. "We can be together again, better than old times." She looks back at the road, watching the miles slip past slowly. "It's not usually this dangerous, I promise. It's safe there, and you'll be comfortable. You can keep going to school there, too, Naomi."

Jet doesn't stop driving on this first day until she has put hundreds and hundreds of miles between her and Houston. Through all that day, through all the night, and finally pulling off to get a room at ten the next day. By then, even Jet's endurance is taxed to her limits, and she must surrender to the unhappy call of sleep for the day.

Jet carries Naomi into the room, knowing that she's taken this the hardest. Michelle and Amy are used to moving place to place. Their job hasn't been stable. For Naomi, moving alone is stressful, and moving in this way, far more yet. With the pack safely settled in the room, and the vehicle parked where it can't be seen by passing cars, Jet curls up with these newest members of her pack and starts to drift off.

Naomi wakes just enough to murmur, "Jet.. your bike.. I'm sorry." The Lunar laughs quietly. The storied romantic ties of her and her bikes is amusing to her, especially now. "I can get other bikes. The things I can't replace I have safe at my side." The Full Moon settles herself more comfortably on the bed, letting the girls settle around her. This night, the tiger keeps her kits close to her, ensuring each feels protected and safe. If nightmares disturb her this night, Jet will not let it show. She has far more important people to think of than herself, and they need to see her as completely untouchable right now.
