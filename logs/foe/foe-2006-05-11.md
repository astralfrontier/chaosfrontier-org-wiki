# Fall of Eden 2006-05-11

It's shortly after noon that Jet pulls off East Tropicana Avenue and into the MGM Grand. It's been a lot of frantic driving, and avoiding notice. The fine car they started with was swapped along the way, and there's enough cash for a room for the night. After so many nights sleeping in the car, the girls are quite relieved to finally have a place to stay. Naomi is sent to arrange for the room, and Jet pulls what few items they have from the car. Her wariness hasn't grown less, and she's nervous until the room door is shut behind her, and everyone is in the fifth floor room, safe and sound. "Well, we're almost back," she says tiredly.

Morgan nods. "Hell of a ride," he remarks. "Good to be able to stop for a while, I'll say that much." His stubble has grown a bit over the past several days - there hasn't been much chance for him to shave, and he's clearly looking forward to the opportunity.

Jet sits down at the foot of the bed, and the girls sprawl out on the second bed. "If I had more energy, I think I'd shower first," murmurs Naomi. "I thought riding took far less energy than this." The Lunar laughs quietly and looks to Morgan, "I guess everyone needs a day of rest. Don't really know why, I could go a long way yet." Of course, she looks exhausted, but she's not about to admit it.

Morgan, for his part, isn't going to embarrass Jet by calling everyone's attention to that fact. "Well, not everyone can keep up your pace, Jet," he remarks. "Remember, up until a couple weeks ago my most strenuous activity was scrambling to make my deadline." He chuckles the chuckle of someone who's tired enough to find the remark funny.

Jet smirks and leans back on the bed, "I think we've probably shaken the pursuit. At least I hope so. We have another long day of driving, then we should be done with this." She runs a hand through her hair, sighing deeply. "The usual rules apply. We can't go out or mess around." Michelle looks over at Jet and sighs, "The ultimate playground and here we are, broke. Not much point in going out." She looks over at Amy, but finds the girl already well on her way into unconciousness. "So much for messing around," comes a tease of Michelle from Amy. "Like I was saying, no going out," repeats Jet. She looks to Morgan, "So you think what you grabbed might give us some answers about who we are running away from?"

Morgan nods, sitting on the edge of Jet's bed and poring through the contents of the wallet. "The trick is to know what clues are useful. For example, the ID is useless, given where we got it from," he says, flipping the driver's license. "It's just good enough to satisfy the cops if he gets pulled over for speeding, but it's fake otherwise." He then opens the wallet further, pulling out a couple receipts. "Now these are more useful - to someone who knows the area, at least, and especially someone who knows the... less conventional of organizations. Which, in this case, is you. Recognize any of these places?" he says, presenting Jet with a couple of the receipts.

Jet looks at the receipts with a sigh. Her eyes have a little bleariness to them, but she can pick names. She frowns thoughtfully, looking through. She shakes her head, "Can't say much, except that he probably wasn't anyone important. Just a bunch of the usual stop points. Marlis Entertainment ATM slips from the St. James. We were just there. But it's no indication. He appears to be a Houston local, at least, or maybe just had been there for a while. Hmm, wait."

"Yeah, there's no missing this," says Jet. She frowns and looks to Naomi and then to Morgan. "I'm afraid we're in a lot more heat than I expected. This guy was MS-13. Not sure what the deal is at this point, but it's not good. They know me, and they know enough not to underestimate me. We're going to have to stay under the radar. Morgan, I'm sure you've heard about them."

Morgan nods, not asking how Jet knows this - it merely confirms to him that Jet's had some contact with the less savory elements of her local society. "A bit out of my usual beat, but yeah, I know of them." He scratches his head. "And if they know you, then it was you they were probably after, so as for why... well, your guess is probably better than mine."

"I'm not sure," says Jet. She kicks off her shoes and curls up on the bed, looking at the receipts a little bit more closely. "I used to be on pretty good terms with them, honestly. We had an understanding." She looks to Morgan, "My departure shouldn't have done anything to piss them off. At least I can't see why. I wasn't working for them at the time. I was on a bit of freelance just before I left." Naomi is clearly paying very close attention now, and trying to appear like she's asleep. "You think you can figure it out?" she asks of Poe.

Morgan shakes his head. "You'd probably have to give me more of the details for me to be sure. But I can make a few guesses." He stands up, pacing back and forth. "Let's see... you weren't working for them at the time, but... rivals would know that you _had_, at some point. Something about the way you 'left', maybe..." He glances at Jet casually.

Jet raises an eyebrow, "I left on my own terms," she answers evasively. "You left about the same time Stone died," notes Naomi. She looks at Jet closely, then away. She doesn't want to presume, of course, but this is clearly something she's thought of for a while now. "Stone was a big time hood," Naomi explains to Morgan. "After the hurricane blew through, he was found dead. Pretty bad shape," she adds.

Morgan nods. "Okay. Well, I don't know if you had anything to do with this Stone person's death, Jet, but I bet his people jumped to the same conclusion Naomi did just now. And I bet they also figured your former associates were involved..."

"It's possible," says Jet. "Stupid of them, but Stone was stupid, and his men weren't much brighter. Still, take on MS-13? They weren't in that league. They would have been signing their own death warrants picking that fight." She carefully avoids any talk about what exactly happened with Stone, of course, though she does at least say, "That was the night I got my selection notice, Poe." She assumes he'll figure out what she means, though Naomi clearly doesn't.

Morgan scratches his head. "Well, you got a point there. I mean, look what happened the other night - MS-13 knows how to let you know when they're upset with you," he understates wryly. "Stone's boys should've known that. Curious." He sighs. "Still... if you'd been on good terms with them before, and now they're lobbing grenades into your house, we have to look at what changed. And Stone's death looks like the best candidate."

"Still... at least we now know _who_ is after you," continues Morgan. "_Why_ is something I'd love to know if I were writing this as a story - which I won't!" he adds, raising a hand hurriedly. "But for us, it's only important if it helps us get them off our back. And if it's something to do with Stone being dead... I think we may be out of luck there."

"It doesn't make a lot of sense, either way," says Jet. The Lunar rolls onto her back, stretching out along the bed with something of a tired pur. "I need to figure this out, somehow. It doesn't make any sense." Naomi sits up and shakes her head, "You need to sleep. You've barely shut your eyes. You are exhausted." Naomi looks to Poe then, a bit of hope in her glance. Jet frowns and answers, "I'll be fine. I can go a long way yet."

Morgan shakes his head and sits down on the bed next to Jet. "No, Jet," he says gently. "You can't stay awake forever. If you keep it up too long, you'll start dreaming when you're wide awake." He pauses for a moment to let that sink in, and then rests his hand on the back of Jet's hand where it's sprawled on the bed. "Most of all, you need rest... but until you find a way to do that, at least you need to sleep."

Jet frowns, resisting silently for a moment, but then she lets it go. "I guess I don't have much choice," the Lunar replies quietly. She teases lightly, "You going to stand guard until you are sure I'm asleep, then?" Still, at least she's not pulling away. "I gotta at least get under the covers, though." It's only when she sits up that she realizes that Poe is touching her hand. She tilts her head, catlike in her study of that. Before she breaks from that contact, she squeezes his hand, and then gets herself ready for bed. Poe by now is probably somewhat used to her lack of shame in these things, and she gets down to her skivvies before slipping under the covers, casting aside clothing carelessly. "You should sleep, too," she points out. "The bed's pretty comfortable, and there's plenty of room for elbow-throwers like me." Which is about as close to an invitation as Poe is likely to get from her.

Morgan blushes a little, because although his mind is used to Jet's casualness about clothing, the rest of him is not... and he nods to Jet. "I could use some sleep myself, come to think of it," he says. Being more reticent, he doesn't strip down before crawling into bed beside Jet... but something tells him the other girls won't be surprised if they see his clothes lying on the bed by morning. Though _he_ would be... albeit quite pleasantly.

Jet rolls over to face Morgan and she wears a lazy smile, her eyes making it seem that she's able to read his mind completely. Since the vast majority of the world would be thinking much the same with her lying nearby, it's hardly a supernatural talent. For the longest time, Jet won't say a thing. She doesn't fall asleep, either. Thanks to the heavy curtains, the room is pleasantly dark, and soon the Lunar declares, "The girls are asleep." She arches her left eyebrow, shifting on the bed to move just a little closer. "You know, I don't usually listen to people. It's just that so few people give advice to me for a good reason, I suppose."

Morgan's voice is quiet as he shifts inward as well. In this darkness, even his eyes can adjust enough to make out the face near him. "Every time you've woken up while I'm around, it's with a gasp. I don't know why, but something haunts you in your dreams. I've gone without sleep long enough to know how awful it would be if you dreaded sleeping..." He reaches up tentatively, with one hand, to brush her face. "I don't know if I can do anything to help you with that, but... if there is anything I _can_ do..."

Jet's eyes shut when those fingers drift over her skin. It's clear from her shifting expression that she's struggling inside. "I don't know if it would help, but I can think of something we both want to do right now that should give us better dreams." She moves closer, not needing her eyes open to find Poe's lips with her own. The kiss is a light promise of what is to come. "We have a lot of time to rest, and a long way to go. If something were to happen, I'd prefer not to have any regrets." She opens her eyes once more, adding gently, "This feels right, and even if I'm scared, I don't want to turn back."

"I'm scared too... of everything," says Morgan, as his lips part briefly from Jet's. "But if there's anything I've learned since I got _my_ 'selection notice', it's that sometimes you have to just go ahead and do what you _know_ is right..." And with that, he closes his own eyes and kisses Jet again, more firmly this time.
