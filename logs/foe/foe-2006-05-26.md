# Fall of Eden 2006-05-26

Even now, in this relatively enlightened age, not all five hundred and one seats of the Deliberative are filled. Old foes, new terrors, and the lasting wounds on the face of Creation are enough to tie up a majority of the Celestials' strength. Still, enough are here to adequately respond to the petitioner who seeks audience with this august body.

Some of those who fill the few officially-recognized positions in the organization are senior Exalts. Others are untried, but eager, juniors. A few remember the First Age. Virtually all remember the Second Age.

One such present is a large man of the Isle, hair long and face worn rough by weather and scarring; his name is Shield, Dawn Caste and the Protector of the Solar Deliberative. Lying beneath his coarse demeanor is a fierce sense of duty to Sun and people, and he has come to see how this meet might affect his charges.

And then there is Tharis also called Tidebreaker, the Psychopomp of the Deliberative. He sits back, watching carefully, almost suspiciously from beneath his mask of office. He is a calculating yet compassionate man, one who takes his job quite seriously. He is here because the nature of the petitioner and what rumors he's heard have him worried about the affect on his domain, such as it is.

Arion Greenwarder is a relatively junior Solar, whose recent ascension to the Deliberative is largely due to his role in negotiating the opening of a new ocean trade route with the water spirits of the West. His superior, the Godspeaker, sent Arion in his stead to deal with the petition, sensing that the younger Exalt's destiny may be taking a strange turn.

A pair of eyes, one blue and one green, floating in an almost amorphous mass of black mist is how Bitter Frost elects to appear. The Enigma was chosen under the usual strange circumstances that surround such the position, and should there come a time when there is no sure path, and not even the mightiest of the Deliberative can provide guidance, she stands ready to steer the powers to the most effective course of action. How long she has been among the Deliberative is something that none are precisely sure of, because her talent for hiding harkens back to the Twin Shadows, Yana and Havesh, and her true identity is rumored to be unknown even to the Sidereals who selected her. What is known is that many times she has appeared from nowhere to save the lives of Exalts and mortals alike, always in cases where no others would have even suspected that aid might be needed. Despite the long list of lives spared and disasters averted, few are comfortable near her.

Gulbrand, a Solar of the Twilight Caste, serves as the Deliberative's Archivist. His responsibility is to maintain the vast history of the Deliberative. Though much was lost in the Age of Sorrows, Gulbrand has reconstructed an encyclopedic accounting and commited it to memory. He's folded his hands into the sleeves of his simple linen robes and pressed his thin lips into a hard line. It is less the petitioner's identity than the unprecedented nature of the petition that disturb him; historians, traditionally, are not accustomed to predicting futures.

Others are here, of course. But the voices that speak loudest will be those who represent Heaven and Hell, and the Unknown. For the visitor is an avatar of Gaia, the Primordial.

Now she stands, clad in the raiment of a simple traveler, bearing a gnarled staff in one hand. A rose continually flowers, withers, shrivels, and re-blooms upon its head. Her eyes are the green of all growing things, and in her voice there is life and death.

"I come to demand the aid of the Deliberative, in trade for the favor I have done for all life in the past," she proclaims. "Will you hear me speak?"

None dare dissent. All are aware by now that by taking on the myriad souls of the Great Contagion's victims, Gaia prevented a dramatic rise in the power of the Underworld. Had the legions of the fallen Deathlords been a hundred times what they are, who knows what the face of the world would look like?

Gaia speaks. "The souls in my care are under attack from outside. Another power seeks to dominate those living within my world. That power is Autochthon, the Great Maker."

There are murmurs of surprise and of despair. What can such a thing mean for the Balance of Creation. Moreover, as Tharis mutters to those seated near enough to dare to speak to, "What does it mean for those souls from Creation who've gone to Gaia... or for those who might be dominated by the Great Maker should they find their way here..." The man steeples his fingers and narrows his eyes. The Psychopomp's mask, however, serves to hide much of the worried frustration.

The Enigma shows no reaction. Her eyes do not move as the words of Gaia are spoken, and as is her way, she remains utterly silent. There is only one who can make her speak, and she waits for that command without any sign of patience or impatience. In the black mist, there is nothing to be seen, save those unblinking eyes.

Arion sits up straight, rubbing his nose - having developed that habit upon learning that chin-rubbing is seen as a gesture of challenge to an obscure branch of tide spirits. He does not yet speak aloud, but murmurs to himself in dismay: "Even the great powers are in disharmony..."

Shield stands; warfare, as it seems to him is inevitable here, is his domain. "How? Why?" the Protector demands to know, raising his powerful voice - honed to travel across the field and clatter of battle - to be heard above the hubbub of confusion.

"His creations enter my domain. I do not know why, for Autochthon is like I - true to himself above all things. I cannot fathom him." Gaia scowls.

Gulbrand sits quietly in the ornately carved chair of the Archivist. A tome in front of him rapidly swirls through pages of its own accord, seeking precedent and the wisdom of what has gone before. Pitifully few references are available, and the flurry once more settles to the page of the present, always the centermost leaf of the book.

Meanwhile, the general - Shield - nods in thanks to Gaia, his question answered: insufficient information. He returns to his seat, now waiting to see what others have to put forth.

"Lady," begins Gulbrand quietly, "I do not doubt your words, and I am troubled by this violation of your sovereignty. But how do the creations of the Maker threaten the souls in your care? Is this necessarily an act of war?"

"I will give you five years to digest the implications of my words, and return again," Gaia announces.

---

Five years pass, and Gaia returns as she promised.

Truth has revealed itself to those who meditated on her words, and who considered her announcement. What Autochthon has done cannot be described as 'war' in the same sense that mortals understand it. Perhaps it cannot be understood in any sense but its own - the Primordials are singular beings.

In this time, the Exalted have come to a perfect understanding of the activities of the Final Circle - those who traveled to Gaia and returned, and those who performed soul-surgery with the aid of Autochthon.

Gaia speaks again to the assembled throng. "You have had a few moments to consider what I spoke of," she states. "Now I come to you with my request. Drive Autochthon out of my sanctuary. Protect the souls within it at all costs."

Arion speaks now, in his odd, lilting accent. "What can you tell us of the nature of the beings that invade your sanctuary? Do they draw sustenance from their Maker?"

Gaia shakes her head. "I know that they manipulate Essence, and that they possess their own stores of it. Beyond that I cannot say."

"What kind of aid can we provide? There is no Essence within your sanctuary. How would we protect the souls within?" It is Tharis that speaks, leaning forward as though the very act might give him some further insight.

"I will give you another five years to decide that," Gaia says.

---

Five years of careful planning and analysis suggests that Essence can be funneled into Gaia. Human Exalted can emerge there, through tying the cycles of reincarnation and renewal from Creation to Gaia. The 'Earth' can be given magical energies with which to combat the intruders. The soul-haven itself must be guarded. Beyond that, launching an offensive against Autochthon must be planned further.

When Gaia returns, the Deliberative is ready. They know how to send defenders to Earth, and they know how to empower, educate, and arm them.

"Brethren and sistern," Gulbrand begins, "we have reviewed the precedents, and deliberated, as is our mission. Even though we cannot know for sure, we have much speculation bordering on certainty. History is not entirely without Precedent on this matter. The ancient war between the Exalted and the Primordials, in many ways, made our world. Whatever the reason, we know that souls are threatened. We know the name and nature of our opponent. We know from history that the Exalted are the only possible opposition to a Primordial - any Primordial. We must bring the Exalted into Gaia's sanctuary, and we have determined the means. Now it only remains: who shall we send?"

Arion rises; in the ten short years since Gaia first presented her petition, he has ascended to the post of Godspeaker himself - his predecessor having turned to more direct study of the problem at hand. He says, "I remind the Deliberative: to speak directly to Autochthon of this matter would be... indiscreet; the fact that He Himself has not come to us indicates that he does not wish to speak of it. We must learn what we can of His intentions indirectly. The means available to us is to discourse with the denizens of Autochthon that invade Gaia, or to interrogate them if needs must. When we have done that, the Chosen shall know better what more must be done."

Shield has no hesitation to make a rightful sacrifice, and - reluctant though he will be to leave his duties, for his weakening will surely make a full Exalt better-suited - he knows that others of comparable might can step into place. The old warrior also understands well the power of example; and so, with all this in mind, he stands and steps forward, clashing a fist against his burnished golden chestpiece for attention. "I offer my Shard."

The Enigma, who has not spoken to any since the very first appearance of Gaia, remains silent. Her apperance now is that of a slender woman, with blood red hair, and skin of pale white. There still is something of a mistiness about Bitter Frost, and her eyes remain unblinking. It is the first time any have seen her in the flesh. Or at least it appears to be flesh. She says nothing, but she lifts her hands, and above them in an arch float five shapes, glittering with auras of red and black and the green of decay. It is clear to the wise what these are: the sparks of a perfect Abyssal Circle.

The Deliberative is undecided at first. Once Shield has stepped forward, many more are eager to follow, but are held in check. Duty must also be considered. The souls that will traverse to Gaia must be considered carefully, must be capable of handling the task without depriving Creation of someone sorely needed. There is debate. Pockets and fragmented groups begin to ripple across the Deliberative's chamber... but then, the Enigma acts. With Shield already having volunteered, the Deliberative finds it easier to reach a final decision. Easier to decide who shall go, whose sparks can best survive the passage.

Gulbrand shakes his head, sighing. "If we're sending a Perfect Circle of those, we'll need a Perfect Circle of Solars, also. All I know is in my books, and also in my Shard. Send my Shard to Gaia, and then both worlds will have them." He waits to see what other two shall make the Five.

For Arion, it is easy for him to decide to go. He has spoken and made pacts with beings of unimaginable variety, from spirits to ghosts to Fair Folk and beyond - but they are all denizens of Creation, or the regions easily accessible from there. To bargain with beings of an order he has never encountered before is the chance of a lifetime - so to speak. He only hopes they _can_ be bargained with.

Throughout this, Shield nudges the flow of volunteers where he can - a nod to some of those who just offered their own Shards, as well as meaningful looks at old friends and the more expendable members of the Deliberative. Exalts are insightful beings, and attempts at more subtle influence on the part of a warrior will doubtless amount to nothing; however, this reminder of kinship might nudge a hesitant mind. It's worth trying.

The reaction of the Deliberative makes the Enigma smirk. She does not speak, but her strange, mismatched eyes do survey the others present. There is no deep emotion to be sensed in her glance, though it seems she is at least amused by the reaction to the Underworld's offering. At last, Bitter Frost looks to Gaia, wondering silently how the Primordial views this gift, incomplete as it is.

Gaia looks left, hearing the voice of the majordomo. "The avatar of Autochthon requests audience."

The Avatar of Autochthon stalks down the center aisle to the floor of the chamber. It has the seeming of a bald man with pale skin and tattoos in patterns that are steady to the eye, but also shift when the eyes leave them. The cadence of his boots striking the floor has a faint metallic echo, which seem to continue for a few moments after he reaches the floor and stops, bowing to the Heirophant and to Gaia.

The Godspeaker, Arion, stands and returns the bow. "Welcome, Avatar, to the Deliberative of Creation. Please state your business here." He knows little of Autochthon's ways, but he guesses that the avatar of the Primordial of Order will value terse efficiency.

The voice of Autochthon's avatar is human enough, but louder than one would expect, as if artificially amplified. "Mighty one. I have fought alongside the Exalted of Eden before. Your work is of the utmost importance, and I have come to offer my assistance to such a worthy undetaking."

Autochthon waves an arm through the air in front of him, and the traces of light flow from his skin, hanging in the air. The traces shift and flow, presenting a series of images of devices. Some are weapons; some are sorcerous devices; some defy description entirely, although all are obviously products of the Great Maker. "Those who dwell in the other world have naught but artifice and mortal labor to change their world. I offer devices in keeping with those methods, and more."

His arm arcs back; the play of images in the air continues, hovering over the debating floor. Autochthon turns slowly around the room, a measured glance at the faces around him. "I see questions engraved on your faces. Is this wisdom not obvious?"

For a decade, the Exalted have studied Autochthon and the Primordials. There is precious little true understanding among what fact they have. But every living man and woman present knows this: the Primordials are as alien to humankind as the mountain is from the sea. And like the mountain or the sea, the Primordials simply _are_. Their motives, as such, arise simply and solely from their natures. They are not dictators who love rulership, nor are they warlords thirsty for the blood their armies spill. They are not comforting companions or lovers. They are primal, ancient above all else, and the human face they wear before the Deliberative is a sham.

Still, it is disconcerting to be confronted directly with this truth. Autochthon's avatar speaks truly: questions lie in the heart of many here. In spite of what they know, their feelings persist.

"What do you request in return for this?" asks Arion, glancing briefly to Gaia's avatar, curious to see what she makes of Autochthon's offer - although if the offer of Autochthon is difficult to fathom, is Gaia going to be any easier to read?

"Hmm, yes," begins Autochthon. "You might have missed that. I ask that the Exalted use these things, when they reach Gaia. I wish them to be useful to you, and I also wish for them to be used." He fixes his gaze on Arion. "This, also, should not be hard to understand; you were given the same task when you were given your Shards - use what you have, every day, to the utmost."

Gulbrand has opened his mouth several times, only to close it again when his mind failed to devise words to describe his astonishment. Historical precedent has abandoned him today; along with eloquence. Finally he spits out, "How? Why would you play both sides of a battle such as this? Cause suffering without need? What purpose can that serve?" He addresses his question to the Delibrative, and only incidentally to the Avatar.

"Ah! Yes," speaks Autochthon, nodding vigorously, as if Gulbrand had spoken an answer instead of a question.

The hall of the Deliberative echoes with muted murmuring, as each Celestial Exalt discusses this peculiar matter with his neighbor. Arion, as is his wont, looks around the room and sees the indecision on his companions' faces. Finally, he speaks. "The issue before us is vexing beyond mortal comprehension. I move that the answer to Autochthon's offer be put into the hands of the Enigma."

Shield has sat, one eyebrow raised, watching events unfurl. Now, he uncrosses his arms and straightens. "Seconded," the Protector declares, nodding.

"There is no wisdom in the Primordials," intones the Enigma. She looks at the two Avatars with blank eyes, "For their minds are not ours, and they cleave to their unchanging nature even to the brink of annihilation. Their balance is not our balance, their virtues not our virtues." Those empty eyes leave the Primordials to drift over her fellow Exalts. "The purpose of the Maker is to create things that must be used. If one makes great weapons, one must have a great war. To make other wonders, such as those that heal, one must have terrible suffering. The battlefield selected forces our hands. Whether our part in the cycle of building is to be in testing or in ultimate application matters little. Autochthon has done as he is. Let us be thankful that this war only shall threaten Gaia, and not all lands."

"We have several steps to take. I suggest that we participate in this test, but that we go in understanding that the test is more than it seems. What better gauge of usefulness is there than to see if these devices might destroy the very beings that once cast down the Primordials themselves?" The Enigma turns to face the Avatar of Autochthon once more. "We also must consider that the testing may be the beginnings of a much greater war, and prepare Creation and the Underworld for a new threat." Without more than slight pause she continues, "At this time, I do not suggest the slaying of Autochthon. The Underworld is not yet ready for it. Preparations will be made, however. We must learn the full purpose of this calling before that final step would be logical."

For his part, the avatar of Autochthon smiles and nods, as if he'd just heard the orchestra play his favorite piece.

Gulbrand mutters to the Celestials who have volunteered, "Let our successors always remember this: that which is done out of divinity, is beyond both reason and madness."

Arion listens to this intently. It is not often that the Enigma speaks, and as always on such occasions, it is worth hearing. When her speech is done, he still does not comprehend the ways of the Primordials - but, he feels, he now understands what _needs_ to be understood. "We have two petitions before us, then. One petition seeks that the Deliberative come to the aid of people who are in need; the other seeks to offer us tools which will help us in that cause. There are complications, but it is my opinion that to help those in need, and to have the best available tools to do so, is to fulfill _our_ nature. I therefore believe we should accept _both_ petitions - and I so move."

The vote is seconded, and the Deliberative is called to stand for or against. Though the two motions are bound together, they are treated separately. First, the call to aid Gaia. In this, the word of the Deliberative is powerful and focused, and overwhelmingly this motion passes. The second motion is not quite so strongly supported, but it too passes, carried mostly by the unified front of Sidereals and Solars. As is the norm, the Enigma abstains from the vote entirely, but her task is not yet completed.

With the voting done, Bitter Frost rises and for the first time ever, speaks of her own accord, "My time as the Enigma has now ended." The sparks still dance about her, glittering piercingly. That is not all that is near her now, however. Three deeper shades of green, red, and gold billow from her flesh, and the ravenous whispers of hungry, lustful ghosts can be heard. "These children cannot find their own way," she says. "Those who once would have reached out through the world to implant them are gone. Long did my kind explore this mystery, until the Merciful Builder Enshrouded in Light and Beauty came to our aid. Now the greatest among us can bind these sparks to a soul. These little ones are of no use without this lore. It is for the debt to the Merciful Builder that I have come to serve you. It is for that debt that we send our own to fight in a distant land."

Shield leans forward in his seat as a murmur ripples throughout the Deliberative, his eyes focused intently upon the Enigma.

Tharis watches curiously as Bitter Frost explains what has happened. Even through his mask the surprise is evident. The Tidebreaker watches the ghosts that have emerged, ready to guide them... forcefully if necessary, as befits his station. _She's going to fulfill her function in Gaia. A transformation of the soul. And other souls. Interesting._

The ghosts grow more anxious, their whispers growing louder and more clear. Their language cries for blood, for pain, for destruction. There is a power to them that is palpable and troubling even to the Exalted. Surely these ghosts are ancient ones. In their midst, Bitter Frost stands unmoved. "I cannot make the journey in this body, and I cannot entrust others to bear these precious sparks to the distant shore, nor to find worthy heroes to bear them."

"No," she says calmly. "I will repay my debts, and I shall be their vessel. Farewell, children of Creation. I do not hope to see any of you again." Her eyes stare straight ahead and she solemnly says, "I am ready."

The ghosts waste no time. They race about her until they are a haze of light, and her body responds swiftly. First, her clothing is dissolved to powder and then her body follows, being first broken slowly into dust, and this divided into threads of essence. Her spark escapes her, and it soon vanishes, no doubt claimed by one of the lore holders of the Underworld. Her soul, however, is woven about the five Abyssal sparks, forming an entity that is both her, and not her, something that might survive the voyage to another world. Still, there is an excess of essence in her soul, and this the ghosts make use of in the foulest of ways, each consuming their portion in what ways fit their vile nature. The new soul floats free of them, but after their feast, they eye it greedily, seemingly unaware of their own danger.

The hunger of the ghosts is ended. Within moments of their feasts conclusion, the Tidebreaker and those who work closely with him have brightened the room. The flares and displays of Essence are quite breathtaking, especially in the light of the newly disincarnate soul. And the holy fire burns away the shades, leaving them to find peace in the next life. Tharis sits back down, and bows his head, "Forgive the interruption."

---

The decision has been made.

Out of an act of death, life will find new defenders.

From an enemy will come weapons of war.

The Exalted will go to a world which never wanted them.

The battle which must not be lost cannot be won.

"The nature of the Exalted made it inevitable," future historians will say.

"Nothing is inevitable," the Exalted will respond.
