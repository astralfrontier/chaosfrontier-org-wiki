With so much time on the road, and the tailers seemingly thrown off, Jet makes the curious suggestion to wait another day in Vegas, and stick to the original plan of travel by night. With the temptations of Vegas, it is hard for her to stay in the room, but she's smart enough to do so. The girls are off enjoying a hot tub, with the warning that they must keep as low a profile as possible, and come back in less than two hours.

In the meantime, Jet is idly flicking through the channels, and stopping on the usual casino hotel channel that constantly drones on and on about the rules of various games. "If you need to watch this channel, you better not be planning to win anything," she mutters tiredly. As usual, she slept very poorly.

Morgan is squatting on the bed, sifting idly through the reciepts that they'd picked from the dead thug's wallet. "I feel so cut off," he murmurs. "None of my contacts run with MS13, and they certainly wouldn't know what's going on in Houston. Not that I can talk to them anyway, at the moment." He looks up and snorts amusedly. "Gotta draw in the rubes somehow, I suppose. Convincing tourists that they know how to play the games is one of the _least_ sinister tricks the casinos have."

"The free drinks work pretty well," says Jet. She rolls over onto her stomach to watch Poe work, her hands up under her chin and legs kicking lazily behind her. "You should relax, you know. What do you think finding out now will do for us, anyway? I figure we're out of their sphere of interest for the moment, and they made their point. Usually they'd want me dead, but a chase-off should satisfy them for now, and the next time I go to Houston I'll just be a lot more prepared."

Morgan laughs and puts the receipts down on the bed. "Force of habit, I guess. I suppose I was trying to make a story out of all this. You know how it is with us reporters. Or at least I guess you'll learn." He nods. "So they aren't going to be any _more_ upset over this guy?" he asks, hefting the wallet.

"He's a hitman," answers Jet. "They kinda view it as evolution... well, so long as it's not somebody's brother or anything. They aren't your normal gang, really. They tend to have a better view of the bigger picture, and this was really just a matter of economics. I probably cost them a fair chunk with my little stunt from before and they wanted a bit of payback. They have proven their point, and nobody is going to screw with their plans. You might say trying to kill me was an investment." She says this all calmly, not troubled in the least, "The only thing I resent is that they almost hurt my friends. It's one thing to mess with me." She sighs deeply and rolls her eyes, "I suppose I'll have to make them pay for that."

Morgan hrmphs. "I suppose, but it sounds like you'd be starting a, ahem, vicious cycle there. It'll end up with either you dead or them destroyed." He grins. "Although I suppose, all things considered, the odds against them are higher than they'd guess."

"Yeah, they are," says Jet softly. "But they may be sitting on something that could ignite it all," she adds more gently yet. "But this is really depressing. When we get back, are you going to write articles about what we do? Well, once we know what it is we are doing, I mean."

Morgan thinks about this for a moment. "I... don't think so. Not right away. I need more time to think about what I am, and what I was Chosen for. Until then..." He laughs. "I don't think I'm the sort to start a cult, you know. I'd never be able to take it seriously."

"A cult?" Jet laughs and shakes her head. "Not really you at all, Poe. I don't know what they want me for. I guess I'm the team brute. Every team needs one, right?" She grins cheekily and flexes her right arm, "Probably doesn't seem like much, but I can't believe how much I can lift now. It's completely off the charts for me. I haven't really talked about it, but I could give a weightlifter a hell of a run these days. Have you noticed a lot of changes like that?"

Morgan chuckles. "Aside from being immune to just about any disease I can imagine? Just... little things. Used to have a birthmark on my right hand, for example. And that article I wrote, That Night... it came easier to me than any disease I'd ever written before. I think it's easily my best work, and I was hardly trying."

"So it's not just me!" Jet seems rather relieved by that. "I used to have this little strawberry shaped birthmark on my.. well, my butt. As you know, it's not there now." She grins widely, enjoying the little tease. "Oh, and other things have changed. My body became more.. I dunno, hot? I was okay before, but the girls keep asking where I got the money to get 'em done, but you know what else is odd? They never ask about my hair. It's like they don't even see the silver in it."

Morgan blushes quite predictably for the line about the birthmark. When the hair is mentioned, he tilts his head. "Well, neither do I, as far as that goes." He squints. "No, I still don't see it. I guess it's really subtle. Or maybe the light's wrong or something."

Jet blinks and looks the mirror. To her eyes, the strange reflectiveness of the moonsilver is as hard to miss as the color of the wall. "Huh. That's really weird." She sighs softly and looks back to Poe. "I guess that doesn't matter. I'll just have to stick around so you can see it. I'm afraid you won't be getting rid of me for a while, babe." She runs a hand through her hair and shakes out the long locks, "Oh, my hair doesn't get dry anymore. It's always so soft. It's giving me a complex, I like touching it too much." She bites on her lip and laughs, "It's kinda fun, isn't it? All these new things we can do, I mean."

"I like touching it too," replies Morgan without thinking about it, and then blushes again. "I've hardly begun to explore what I can do. I'm... at my best when I'm working on a story. I feel as if I'm not really going to come into my own until I start writing again." He grins. "I suppose I could write a little something, just for practice. Maybe it'll never see the light of day, but I feel as if I've got to do _something_."

"You could right a poem, or a song, or even a short story," suggests Jet. "You know I like watching you work, it does something to you." She looks away and manages a blush. The Solar isn't the only one a little out of his element. "I can see how everything is right for you when you are doing that. Like that first night." She opens her mouth, as if to say something else, but closes it with a grin.

Morgan lies back on the bed and looks at the ceiling for a few moments. "I'm not usually the poetic sort, but... a short story. Yeah, I can imagine that." He laughs. "I could tell _this_ story - names changed to protect the guilty, of course. Could sell well as sci-fi or something. Or maybe fantasy. Or..." He moves his lips for a moment. "Wow... maybe I could write poetry after all. I can kind of see the stanzas coming together..." He sits up and pulls the ever-present dog-eared notebook from his pocket, and starts scribbling.

Jet shifts slightly on the bed, her eyes focusing on Poe's face. She's quiet for now, watching him, as she's been more and more prone to doing, especially today. Even she's not sure what it means, but she can't stop smiling. She can see that look coming to his face, and knows that whatever he's going to write, it will move her.

Morgan spends several minutes in intense concentration, focused upon the notepad with ferocious intensity. If Jet had to describe it in her own terms, it'd be as if he were deep in the middle of a hunt, stalking his polysyllabic prey through the jungles of erudition. After several minutes of this, he looks up and breathes a sigh. "Still needs a lot of work, but... I never had the knack for poetry before." He looks up at Jet, smiling happily. "I think I know what you mean now... about discovering all the new things we can do."

Jet meets Poe's eyes, just listening to the sound of his voice, but not really understanding his words right away. "Oh! Yeah, it's really kinda cool." She laughs and looks to the paper, then up to Poe, "I suppose you want me to wait until you are done to read it?" She turns her head, resting her cheek on her hand as she watches the Solar. "I wrote a little, once, but not like this. My grandmother tried to teach me calligraphy before she passed away. I didn't really understand it."

Morgan blushes and smiles, holding the notebook close. "Yeah... I think I'd rather you'd wait until it's done. I want to get it just right for..." He bites his lip and looks down, slipping the notepad back into his pocket. "I don't know how I want to finish it, anyway. Maybe it needs to be open-ended..."

The Lunar arches an eyebrow, then laughs again. She imagines that Poe has written something about her now. Maybe it's even true. "Well, even if it is, there is at least one thing that has its heart set," she says casually. She doesn't let it linger too long before going on, "I want to be honest with you, Poe. I'm not a saint, but I do know a good thing when I see it, and it wasn't a mistake to me, and even if we were resting easy with nobody on our tail, I would have done the same. I'm just asking for.. I dunno, but I'd like a real shot." Those Lunar eyes lock on Poe's, the emotions right on the surface, honest and open.

Morgan hears a change in Jet's tone of voice, and looks up. What he sees in her eyes almost frightens him. Almost... because when he looks into his own heart, he sees the same mirrored there. "I..." he begins, then falters - normally so smooth with words, he finds himself tongue-tied for the moment. "When I was little, they told me that God would provide. I never imagined, though... that they'd provide quite like this." He reaches out to Jet, tentatively.

Jet watches Poe's hand and smiles reassuringly. She's not going to pull away. "This is kinda funny, isn't it? All this power and it's still hard. I don't feel as scared anymore, though." Just before Poe's hand reaches her, she lets her eyes drift shut. "I guess I just trust myself more now, or trust a part of myself that knows what it is doing more than the rest ever will. It's not really a loss of control, though. That doesn't make any sense, I guess."

Morgan's hand brushes against Jet's cheek. "Some things don't have to make sense," he murmurs. "Even if we try to make sense of them." He leans in closer - he's not really sure where he's going with this, but... well, what's happening now makes sense to him on a level deeper than anything he's ever tried to touch in his stories.

Jet leans forward just slightly, drawing in a breath, and letting it out in warm sigh. She wets her lips, and can feel that Poe is close. A little pout comes to those full lips just before they meet Poe's. Whatever was in Jet's head just seems to vanish, replaced by this pleasant, warm humming where instinct and conscious desire perfectly agree.

And just when Jet is reaching to start tugging at Poe's shirt, her ears catch the swiping of a keycard in the door, and she hesitates, that wonderful merging breaking as her mind tells her to wait a second, no matter what her body wants. The door swings open, then, and the girls come in, led by Michelle, who stops dead in her tracks at the sight of Poe and Jet. "Wow, we weren't even gone the full two hours yet! I guess Naomi was right." In the background, Naomi's hand can be seen extending to Amy Lynn and she says flatly, "Pay up." Michelle looks to Jet, waiting to catch the Lunar's eye, a question in her eyes that isn't spoken.

Morgan barely has time to register Jet's hesitation before the door opens, and he jumps up as if he were stung, his cheeks beet-red. As comfortable as he may be with Jet herself, he's still very shy about being affectionate with her in company. "Wh-wha... I didn't think you would be back so soon! Uh, I mean, I..." he stutters, settling back into a sitting position on the bed.

Jet rises smoothly, moving over to sit by Poe. She meets Michelle's look and dispels whatever question was there with a raised eyebrow and a slight shake of her head. "There was a fat smelly guy who came to the hot tub and he brought his wife, who was even fatter," explains Michelle. She sighs softly and goes to set herself on the other bed, "Vegas kinda sucks when you don't have a ton of money." She looks over to Poe and grins, "Well, at least for some of us. You guys have had pretty good luck in here, it seems. You know you don't have to stop on our account, but.. suit yourselves." Fortunately, Naomi and Amy continue to bicker, keeping them rather preoccupied.

For the rest of the day, things are pretty light. Jet makes a point of holding Poe's hand as much as he'll allow. That gesture is noticed more by the other girls than the kissing, and they give Poe a lot of weighing looks. Happily, it's fairly obvious that they all like him, and the teasing is for fun. As Michelle will say to Poe when she thinks Jet can't hear her, "Nobody can get her to smile like that. You can, and that makes you okay in my book." That she teasingly added, "And if you need any tips about making a woman pur, just ask," doesn't make the rest any less true.
