# Fall of Eden 2006-06-23

The kid with his butt parked in the station wagon has a copy of Jack Kirby's comic book 'The New Gods' open. He's leafing through it with the hyper-short attention span of any boy his age. Something attracts his attention, and he puts the comic book down. His eyes now stare straight forward, meeting those of a woman with Asian features. She stares intently back, and smiles, and turns. The kid sinks low into his seat, his comic book forgotten entirely.

Jet and Poe are at a Shell station. They've rented a truck with a trailer, and Jet's bike is parked on the back, nestled amidst a collection of boxes and crates with sturdy locks on every last one.

Trucks like this are usually used when moving, or traveling, and that's just what they're doing - going to New York City to meet friends.

"We need to bring over Dr. Benford for the work to continue," Barry had explained during their last meeting, in teleconference with Geneva. "We're ramping up our manufacturing capability, and the test labs and staff are all ready. All we need is the man himself."

Hel had nodded over the video link, looking from face to face as he studied the American Celestials. "Your two allies - they can escort him, yes? Danger seems indicated." Barry had nodded, and asked Jet and Poe about it. They had agreed.

Preparations were made. Equipment was secured. Excuses were made.

---

"Another road trip.." Jet had to first handle the many objections and whining of Becca and Timothy. They seem to think that it's imperative they go with her to New York. Jet doesn't like growling much, but the soft, bass rumble does have something of a profound effect when it comes from a woman who can turn into a tiger and calls the zoo 'a buffet'. The protests finally fell to, "Well, please bring back some gifts!"

Getting away is certainly something Jet is looking forward to, though she dislikes leaving her family behind. She can trust people with some things, but trusting others to look over her girls and Timothy is not easy. Still, she can't help but think that she's a dangerous woman to travel with, and she won't let them be put in harm's way again. Besides, this is not a sight-seeing journey. It's a pick-up.

Jet treats it like her old job. The more mundane things seem to be, the more wary one must be. She comes prepared. She has a gun strapped to the inside of each thigh under her skirt, and another four guns are tucked away in her black, leather duster. Ammo clips are concealed in there as well. The coat may weigh a fair amount, but Jet's not taking chances.

She and Poe plot out a pretty straight forward course to New York City, with one detour to be named later, as Jet puts it. I80 seems ideal for the trip from Frisco, and the travel isn't so bad. The truck is provided by the Sidereals, and Jet makes sure to hide away yet more ammo inside.

The trip is uneventful. At least up until the detour. Jet wants to swing south on 25, and head towards Boulder, Colorado. She doesn't explain in any detail. She just says she has a few things she's been meaning to pick-up and now seems like a good time.

Whatever she seeks, it isn't something found in the cities of men. She shuts the engine off and pulls over on a rather forlorn streth of highway, saying to Poe, "This feels right." They are three miles east of Boulder, now on I76, in a place where bears have been sighted quite often. The radio stations relayed a rather troubling story about a cougar that has gained something of a taste for men. The DNR has a hunt out for the man-eater, but has had no luck. For all their experience and knowledge, they are still only humans. "Only humans," Jet murmurs quietly as she walks away from the car.

She remembers not too long ago that she was one of them. She was bound to the earth, unable tIn the guise of a cardinal Jet soars skyward, her bright eyes searching. She has some work to do. Her goal is to handle something of a checklist, and then get on her way to New York. First, she has to handle dinner.

With her avian eyes, Jet catches a sight that thrills her. The beauty of a bald eagle soaring through the skies, its eyes focused on what is below. Jet knows she is no match for it in the air, but the eagle's path is not going to keep it in the sky forever. In fact, it is Jet that will draw it down. The Lunar's shape moulds about her like water, and soon the cardinal is no more, and a nimble house cat prowls the hills. Of course, an eagle's eyes spot the orange tabby, and the bird will dive at her. The Lunar looks skyward, her feline calm unruffled by the coming of certain death. She is no mere cat. There is no animal on earth more dangerous than she is. What happens is so quick human eyes could not even follow it. In the end, the great eagle is sprawled out on the ground, unmoving, and a cat that is anything but domesticated is drinking it's heart's blood.

Now Jet flies with the might of an eagle, and she looks down upon a domain that she knows she is meant to dominate. She pauses to visit Poe. At least he ought to know it is her. Few eagles land near cars and make eye contact with humans for that long. She is off again then. This time her hunt is far faster. The new wings, the new heights she can so easily reach thrill her, and her eyes amaze her. Now eagle-eye means something to her. Without effort she gives in to the eagle, and before she realizes it she has slain a fox. The kill brings her back to her senses, and she focuses her mind once more and flies. Higher she goes, and then she sees it: a great mountain ram, the largest of the males she has seen in her flight.

A ram is hardly the normal hunt for an eagle, of course, but this is no normal eagle. Jet crashes down into the ram, talons shredding flesh, her beak like a saber. It is not a pretty kill, but in the hunt grace and beauty are not the measuring sticks of success. It is only survival that counts. The ram simply cannot handle a foe that is faster, smarter, and able to strike at will. Blood loss and pain are telling, and at last the creature falls, slain by the fierce eagle.

The hunt draws other attention though, and Jet finds herself glaring into the hungry eyes of a mountain lion. The cat is not as large as the ram, but Jet isn't eager to try her wings against such an agile opponent. No, this time, she wants to fight on her own terms. This time, when the cougar comes diving against its foe, it finds itself suddenly leaping at a full grown Siberian tiger. The result is as swift as it is final. As Jet drinks of its blood, she can smell the blood of men on the creatures fur. The humans will not need to find their cougar, now.

Jet is in the sky again swiftly, and making her way back towards Poe when she sees something that makes her flight rather more urgent. A brown bear bull is meandering down the road, heading right towards the truck Poe is settled in. From the angle, Jet knows that he'll not see the bear until it's almost on top of him. It's hardly a time for messing around. The bear has Poe's scent, and in this area, where hunters are often not so far away, the creature is more aggressive. Before it can reach the car, though, Jet is in front of it, and with a loud roar something of a battle royale breaks out right near Poe.

The brown bear and the Siberian tiger do not have occasion to meet in the natural order of things. Tigers face many predators, though, and even have been known to kill crocodiles that are stupid enough to challenge them out of the water. The thick hide of a bear is certainly strong defense against the claws of the cat, but the bite of a tiger is terrifying, and Jet uses it without mercy. She uses her speed and grace to avoid the incredible power of her stronger opponent, and leaps first outside of its reach, and then as the bear rears up, she throws herself forward, slamming into the beast and ripping out its throat with a horrifying sound of torn flesh.

The woman Jet is left gasping for air near the corpse, and the bear's blood drips from her mouth. She pushes herself up and draws the back of her hand across her lips as she settles back behind the wheel.

"It's time to go."

Morgan is shaken by the close encounter with the bear - and even more so by the aftermath. "You... know..." he finally manages when his eyes stop rolling, "I think that's the first time I've seen you... fight as an animal." Somehow, watching that happen was even more unnerving than having a grenade go off in the next room.

Jet laughs a little at Poe's comment and starts off once more. "Well, if it catches your eye, I'll have to do it more often," she says teasingly. The rest is more serious. "It's strange how right it feels, though. The tiger is who I am as much as the skin I wear now. I know I can live with it. I hope you can."

Morgan chuckles softly. "Well, after seeing you take on a bear like that... and after the things that've happened to me this month... I think I'd have a hard time surviving _without_ it." He grins at Jet, having somewhat recovered already.

After that little errand, Jet is driving back down I76, and merging once again with I80. The road is still quite long. New York City is a long ways off yet, and the truck is hardly a speedster's choice.

Benford never looked forward to flying beford. The added discomfort of travelling with a wheelchair and medications forced him to prefer staying on the ground, not to mention the added paranoia since 2001. This time, things are different. He stands in line for security at Geneva International Airport, pondering the conveniently work passport and first-class ticket provided by Hel, from Switzerland to New York, with a refuelling stop in Greenland... and there the trip ends. _Why,_ he wonders, _aren't we flying from New York to San Francisco?_ He shrugs and moves forward, presenting his documents. Jack is in another line, a few feet away, with similar documents; right now, they don't know each other.

Travel under a false face is nothing new to Jack; this is mostly routine to him, and one of the more easily taken-in-stride events since his Exaltation. He smiles; he nods; he moves through.

---

Why? Benford had asked this once before, when Hel was briefing them. The Sidereal's reply was somewhat involved.

"There's danger for you here, although we can't predict specifics. Fly as little as you must. Travel as anonymously as possible. Make every preparation you can think of. It may be nothing, but... be prepared."

"One other thing," Hel had said. "Remember this. To the eyes of mortal men, some of your actions will be those of psychopaths, madmen, or terrorists. You will be called upon to fight and kill as well as think and create. Don't be afraid to break the rules. Those rules were made with mortal men in mind. That isn't you any more."

---

Benford settles into the aisle seat in the First Class cabin of the big airbus. Jack is just across the aisle; they don't work too hard on ignoring each other, nor do they get exceptionally chatty. After takeoff, Benford uncrates his laptop, as does nearly everyone around him. While technically on a leave-of-absence from CERN, he's still maintaining his position there by wading through hundreds of messages and experimental results a day. Part of this is reconstruction of the data lost in the computer crash Hel arranged to cover Benford's fusion experiment... and while Benford would never go so far as to falsify data, he's giving priority to items that he sees as most promising. He's amazed to discover, after a few hours, that he's enjoying himself. A few drinks, time to think, a comfortable chair for once... maybe travel isn't so bad after all. He doesn't notice the faint grin on his own face.

The Sidereal sits quietly in his seat, speaking little enough and preoccupying himself with in-flight films. First Class as it is, the suit he wears blends well enough. His customary tinted glasses are off; in the age of coloured contacts, sunglasses in a plane would be far more conspicuous than yellow eyes - and that's if they're even noticed.

After a couple of movies and a meal, the lights are dimmed. With many of the other passengers - businessmen, well-used to catching sleep to while away the long flights - Jack pulls a black sleeping mask over his face, and eases his seat back to rest.

Benford stows his laptop, and reclines his seat. He sips at a pilsner and indulges a habit: retracing the decisions in his life that got him to where he is now. _And I'd do it all again, the same way,_, he thinks as he dozes off.

---

Especially after the extremely eventful detour in Colorado, Morgan finds the rest of the trip almost hypnotically dull by comparison. Were it not for the extremely attractive Lunar beside him for the entire trip, he'd have stood a fair risk of going off the road in Nebraska when it was his turn to drive. As it is, though, there is plenty of conversation to keep their minds occupied - even if, for now, Morgan tends to keep it at a fairly abstract level, and doesn't ask Jet in any great detail about her former life.

For her part, Jet doesn't have as much trouble staying awake, as she does in giving-in to sleep. When it's not her turn to drive, she finds it hard to rest. She can't hide the fear she has in dreams when she's sleeping only an arm's length away. Many times she awakens with a start, and then Poe starts waking her, drawing her out of those nightmares more quickly. She has to fight to control her instinct to strike when she is awoken from her dreams, but she manages to keep control. She had to learn how the hard way. For her, New York can't come soon enough, now. She needs more space. The truck is feeling more and more like a prison, even if the company is good.

As the interminable Midwest finally comes to an end, the traffic increases dramatically. Morgan is relieved that Jet is at the wheel - Seattle traffic is nothing compared to the perpetual snarl around New York City. It's a relief to finally make it safely onto Long Island and navigate the tortured maze of Interstate highways until they finally make their way to La Guardia. Finding parking for a truck and trailer is an adventure all by itself. "Thank god we'll have more people to help drive on the way back," Morgan remarks as he stretches his legs.

---

Benford wakes up to find a strange man sitting next to him. Expressionless, with unclear ethnic heritage and bland features, the stranger extends a slip of paper. On it is a series of chemical equations. It takes Benford only moments to realize that the formula he's surveying could be a powerful explosive indeed. The stranger's impassive eyes study Benford's own, and he speaks in a measured tone of voice. "You recognize the significance of this equation, Dr. Benford. Do you realize what I am inferring about the flight?" His accent cannot be definitely placed, but his English sounds foreign in some way.

Benford is awake at once, but controls his reaction. He hands the slip back to the stranger. "It's clear enough. Are you going to tell me who is responsible?"

"I am, Doctor," Benford's 'guest' replies. There is no sign of what happened to the previous occupant of the seat, and a rash of distinctly unpleasant speculations wash over the physicist. "Now. You will use your influence to communicate this situation to the crew. Impress on them that anything or anyone leaving or boarding the aircraft will incur consequences."

Benford frowns. "Who is it that you think I am? When I got on this plane my name was Charles Starrett."

The stranger starts to rise from his seat, but he stops a moment. In answer he traces a circle on his forehead with one fingertip, and smiles.

Jack From where he sits, Jack's eyes flicker to Benford, and he notes a part of the scientist's low conversation with the Bland Man. Folding the in-flight menu he was passing over, a slight smile washes over the Chosen of Journey's face. Slowly, he begins to release Essence, forming it into a pattern uncovered while under Hel's care...

Benford takes a deep breath, exhales. "You have to know this can't work. This plane has to land. Once we're on the ground, you won't be able to control the situation. They won't wait for you to talk about it. And if all you want to do was make a mess there's a thousand easier ways. So how about you tell me what you really want from me."

The man, now on his feet, simply shakes his head. "They will send a negotiator. Your friends, however, will see things differently. They will come in force."

Benford mutters, "And you'd like that, wouldn't you? Fine. I'll warn the crew. But this won't go unanswered." He pauses. "And if this is a test it's in damnably poor taste. Good allies shouldn't complicate things needlessly."

Only now are some of the other passengers around Benford taking notice of the conversation. They look between the Solar and the departing character, confused expressions on their faces.

Benford waits long enough to take ten deep breaths, and looks around the cabin again.

Benford glances over at Jack. He lets his face say it all, waits for the other man to acknowledge him.

Jack nods at Benford's look, smoothing his suit and taking a moment to mentally prepare himself for what might come.

Benford rubs his hands, then reaches up and taps the call button for the flight attendent. He flips the in-flight magazine to the terminal map of La Guardia and prepares to ask about a connecting flight. He writes a note in the margin: 'Passenger in C1 said he has bomb. Demands I tell you. Demands no debark. Help.'

The flight attendant's eyes dilate; Benford can read that something she has feared has come, something she's never faced. Nevertheless she nods, visibly drawing on her determination, and pats Benford's hand in a weak act of reassurance. Then she rises, to perform her own duty.

Benford reaches up and takes her hand, before she goes. His grip is firm, but not violent - it's there to reasussre her. "He's alone. You're not," he mutters, hoping she'll understand.

The woman nods, and smiles, heartened.

Benford looks over at Jack again. _Alright... NOW what?_

Jack meets Benford's look, and briefly considers going to him for discussion - but decides against it. _Our opponent might know of me, and he might not. Best to conceal myself if I can._ He sits, and waits.

Jack glances at the ETA, superimposed over a flightmap and displayed on his personal screen alongside an assortment of other data: local time, time at departure, temperature. Irrelevant. _Won't be long until the descent begins, and we are confined to our seats._ He stands, and shoots a glance at Benford before striding off, knowing that the scientist will understand his intent. _We have to find him. And he might not know to look out for me._

Benford rises, intent on joining Jack in his search. As he stands, he comes face to face with the man who called himself Selber - 'self'. "Don't you think it's interesting," asks Selber, "that the flight attendant accepted what you said without question? And didn't suspect you, or do anything but what you told her to?"

Benford accepts the moment of vertigo and lets it pass; the world is getting decidedly weird around him. "What worries me is that I had to accept what the real troublemaker said without evidence, and I still did what he said, even though I questioned it. So who's worse?"

"He _knew_ who you were," Selber points out. "He's dangerous. What you have is something else. If these people need calming, you can calm 'em. Don't forget that." He clasps Benford on the shoulder, smiles - and disappears.

Benford nods to himself. _Thanks, old man. And now I guess the real work starts._ He follows the aisle aft, covering the opposite side of the plane from Jack.

Jack and Benford quickly scan the remainder of the First Class cabin, then begin to move down the length of the plan, methodically searching for the bland stranger. _This is futile_, Jack realises, after a short length of time. _Evading us would not be so difficult._ He gives Benford as communicative a look as he can manage, and gestures about helplessly.

Benford's nervousness increases as he gets further aft, meeting Jack near the aft galley. _Gone. Not in the cabin. Dammit._ "I didn't imagine him. Time is short. We could try belowdecks. No matter what we do, the authorities are going to be all over us."

---

Even before he and Jet reach the glass doors, Poe frowns. "Something's up," he mutters _sotto voce_ to Jet. "I've been through La Guardia before, and the security guys are never half this alert. Look at them - they look like they're waiting for the enemy army to crash the gate." He shakes his head, knowing full well that Jet can read thier mood as well as he. "Should've had the radio on before we drove in."

Jet looks around her, and sniffs at the air. To her, the smells are different. Fear is strong in the air, and so is rage. She can see the way jaws are tensed, she can tell the way one man looks at another. She looks to the radios they use, and the way their expressions shift subtlely as they speak. It's very hard to hide feeling from her. "I'm going to take a look, I think. I can't see anything down here, but I might have a better view from above. I doubt they will need me to escort them to the truck anyway. If I need you, I'll use the cell. I will be out of touch for at least a few minutes, though." It's hard to answer a call when you have large talons.

Morgan nods. "All right. I'll go on in and find out what's going on the more old-fashioned way - asking people. I'm not packing, so I should be all right with security. Hopefully whatever it is won't go after me specifically, or at least won't do so in an airport crawling with cops." He has a sinking feeling that he's whistling in the dark, but maybe he'll be lucky for a change.

Jet smiles at Poe and leans in to brush a kiss against his cheek. "See ya in a little bit! Time for some fresh air." In New York City? Right! Jet steps out of the airport, and then has to take something of a little walk. One thing about La Guardia. It's got a lot of people in it. People who probably will react to a perfectly fine woman turning into a bald eagle. She finds a bit of space to make her switch not far from the terminal, and then takes to the sky, eager to see just what is going on down below. She's going to fly a wide circle about the airport, keeping a careful eye out for very large objects flying several hundred miles per hour.

For his part, Morgan is plying his trade, and it feels good to do so after weeks on the run or in hiding; and although he has no official press credentials, he quickly dons the persona of 'concerned citizen' - a pose not hard to adopt when he notices that Flight 2673 on British Airways is "Delayed". His first inquiry, at the ticket agent desk, is completely useless - a bland and polite assurance that "unusual weather" is to blame for 2673's delay and "try back again in a half hour". Talking to security agents directly is only slightly more useful - many of them are clearly there specifically to reassure the public. After many more minutes of fruitless inquiries, though, he finally finds an officer who tries to give him a more direct and abrupt brush-off - a possible sign that this particular man has had more important things to do than get a PR briefing.

Benford says to Jack, "OK. The agency we work for would want us to take care of this problem. He might be belowdecks. See if he did. Some of these people might know something, I'm going to ask."

Benford notices a few passengers looking their way, and picks out the one that looks the most alert. _OK. We can't find the guy. But he did walk back this way. Maybe someone noticed something._

"Gotcha," Jack replies to Benford's back, heading away to inspect the cargo area.

Benford finds himself talking to a fit, middle-aged man, who reminds Benford of all his father's friends... probably ex-military. That gives him a good hint of how to talk to him. He leans down to speak to him. "Sir, I need your help. There's a situation, but there's someone on this plane with information we need. We can control it if we find him." He keeps his voice low, but doesn't try to hide it from the other passengers, having faith that he can convince everyone to remain calm.

Benford gives a rough description of the man he saw. "He would have come aft less than ten minutes ago. Did you see him?"

Meanwhile, Jack smirks as a magical sense settles upon him. _Close, now._

The man listens calmly, then nods. "I saw some activity in the flight staff. This would explain it. Yes, I saw the man you describe. He came down the aisle--" He and Benford look up, as the calm voice of the flight attendant comes over the PA. "We will be descending shortly. All passengers are requested to remain in their seats. The captain has turned on the no-smoking and seatbelt signs for your safety."

Benford nods to the man. "OK. Time is short, we need to find him." He pauses, gives him an appraising look. "We could use some help. I can't order you ... but... what's your name?"

"Luther Blissett," the man replies, smiling. "I guess... I don't have to worry about the seatbelt thing, hmm?" He lifts himself out into the walkway, gesturing.

Benford allows himself a faint smile. "Just tell them you're claustrophobic. Let's go."

Ahead of Benford and Luther, Jack enters the cargo bay; his passage goes unobstructed. His eyes are instantly alert and scanning, peering through and around the secured baggage for any sign of the Bland Man - or his device. The electric tingle of Essence-driven forewarning still floods him, forcing a smile to Jack's lips.

Benford drops through the floor-panel, and follows two paces behind Jack. He motions Luther to stay the same distance behind him. For Benford's part, he's more concerned with finding the device, which is not easy in a noisy, cold cargo hold. A narrow aisle runs down the middle between piles and piles of luggage. With minutes to go, Benford knows that they are tickling a dragon's tail, and just hopes that they can react fast enough to avoid being singed.
