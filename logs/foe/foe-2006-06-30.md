From his position, Morgan knows where the trouble is but not what; from her point of surveillance, Jet overhears the missing piece.

A bomb threat has been called in, aboard an aircraft. In the tower, spiral-bound notebooks are being pulled off shelves and opened with hesitant hands. Men and women are conversing with each other in hushed tones, anxious looks on their faces. One man is on the phone. He's doing all the talking, with the occasional break to nod.

Jet has to think this through. She's fast, but that aircraft is far faster. Still, she knows she could do it. She knows she could get on that plane. What she doesn't believe is if there is anything useful she could do up there. She's no bomb expert, but she could maybe sniff it out up there. Sniff it out. That makes sense to her. This is all too convenient, though. This isn't a chance happening. Someone is trying to pull something. If there is a bomb, and they wanted to kill, Jack and Benford would be a puff of smoke. This is a draw out.

Jet decides to stay put, and hold back. Rushing out has gotten her nailed, and her instinct is to wait. She keeps her eyes on the sky. Her every instinct tells her this is a bluff or a trap. Either way, someone is trying to trick her. That pisses her off. Whoever did this, they clearly have no idea who they are messing with.

Meanwhile, in the airport itself, Poe quickly finds that the 'concerned citizen' approach isn't getting him very far. The most he's been able to find out is that something is up with the flight from Switzerland - the security personnel are reticent and evasive, and their cover stories show subtle but definite holes when compared with one another. But what exactly it _is_ that they won't tell him... is clearly not anything they will tell any civilian. He briefly considers the idea of impersonating someone important, but dismisses it. Whatever's going on has them worried, and if he's caught, he stands a good chance of getting arrested - and that isn't going to do Jack and Benford any good.

Instead, Morgan waits by the door nearest baggage-claim area 3. This is the spot where he planned to rendezvous with Jet, should she decide to come back in and give him an update. It's also a very natural place for him to wait - it's where he'd be waiting if there weren't anything wrong, after all - and if there's anything the airport personnel would deign to tell ordinary civilians, he'll hear it just fine from here.

Jack, Benford, and Blissett cross through the open access panel into the belly of the 747. As they descend the cramped gangway, Benford describes the mysterious passenger to Blissett. Unfortunately, there's not much to say. "He implied he's got a bomb. He only demanded that nobody board or leave the plane when we land. All we know for sure is that he's dangerous, so don't indulge in unnecessary heroics." _Like I've got any right to say that,_ Benford adds to himself. He shushes any possible follow-up questions as they enter the hold. It's quieter than he thought it would be; but still too crowded for comfort. The three men proceed down the narrow aisle, looking for anything out of the ordinary.

"Danger soon," Jack comments, directing his speech and a meaningful look towards Benford. He has not afforded Blissett so much as a glance since the man arrived with Benford unexpectedly, instead directing his attention to scanning the area. He tugs at the coat of his suit. "Very soon."

Benford nods, and waves to Blissett to keep a few steps behind him. a 747 is nearly 200 feet long, and time is short, so they can't move too slowly; the tension in the air makes the passage seem longer than it is. _Now... if it is a bomb... they had to go to some work to get it on board... and it will probably have to survive rough handling. So it won't be a small bag. Maybe a crate, or something hidden in the works..._ he looks for pieces of baggage solid enough to be candidates... and piles of baggage big enough to hide a man. Jack's search, he imagines, is less concerned with measurements and shadows, and more with the currents of destiny... quite literally asking the Fets, 'If I were a terrorist, where would I be hiding?'

The trio proceed down the isle in the order that they entered the cargo bay: Jack, followed by Benford, and with Blissett taking up the rear. After a short while, Benford taps Jack lightly on the back, and points to an item sitting a few steps from the path - an initially unremarkable grey duffle bag. Further inspection reveals telltale signs: the bag is not only newly bought and with a lock of heavier-than-usual duty attached, but seems to sag in the middle - indicating empty space, a contradiction among the full-to-bursting luggage of most travelers. Jack nods, and moves over to it.

Benford motions to Jack, putting his index fingers together, and pulling them apart. _Unzip it._

Jack frowns, and reaches into his jacket for a small lockpick - the length of wire too small to set off a metal detector by far. He reaches down to the lock and inserts it, stretching out for more than mortal means of bypassing the chunk of metal. _All things have a fate. Where does the destiny of this thing twine with mine?_ The nascent Exalt probes...

A dull click starts from the lock, and stops abruptly halfway, the echo dull and unfinished. Jack's hand is cradling the base of the lock, and pushes back upwards - resealing the bag. It was not sensed through fate, nor entirely felt - but the Sidereal knows what he has found. "This is it."

The crackle of a radio heralds a bland, relaxed voice. It's coming from inside the bag. "Gentlemen."

After a stunned pause scarcely longer than a breath, Benford replies. "We're here," he says. "I'll ask again. What do you really want from us?"

"My demands were clear, sir," the radio-voice replies.

Benford says, "Hardly. You demanded that we communicate a message to the crew. You only insinuated that you had a bomb, to force our hand. We've communicated our message. We know you have no interest in the people on this plane; but we do. Guarantee their safety and I personally guarantee that we'll communicate your agenda to the right people." He scowls. "Threats and coercion are so uncivilized. You must know there are easier ways to do this."

"I demand your death. Who will you communicate that agenda to?"

Benford is stunned for quite some time, and tries to keep the confusion off his face. _What the hell. I wouldn't have lived to see 40 anyway. "And what else do you offer in return for my life?"_

_"This is not a negotiation, sir. This is an attempt to kill you and as many of your fellows as I can. Do you misunderstand?"_

_Jack carefully replaces his lockpick. "Then what are you waiting for?"_

_"More of him."_

_Jack scowls briefly; but he then shrugs, theatrically gesturing towards Benford. _He's all yours_._

The FBI has arrived at La Guardia speedily; the Bureau takes such threats quite seriously. Morgan watches the Special Agents file in unobtrusively, wearing their windbreakers and sunglasses, unnoticed by anyone but a guy with a sharp eye for trouble.

Stag is whispering to Jet: blend in, blend in. Lead your herd through stealth. Eagle yearns to fly to the source of the danger, but Stag's whispers become louder as Jet senses the arriving law enforcement.

Authority of New York and New Jersey, the airline, the British embassy (since it's a British aircraft), hell, probably even the Boeing sales representative to British Airways."

_This is serious,_ Morgan thinks to himself. _They're going to where the trouble is._ With that thought, he lets the G-men get well ahead of him, and then begins to follow them. A life dealing with the harder aspects of Seattle's under-society helps him to blend in with the crowd - always walk as if you have a purposeful destination that happens to be in the same direction at the moment, don't make eye contact, if they stop for some reason, walk past as if headed elsewhere and then double back. Discretion is the better part of valor, though - if there's any risk of discovery, he'll let them slip away rather than have them catch him instead.

The FBI are accustomed to establishing their jurisdictional dominance; this is not merely pride of place in the pantheon of United States justice, but professionalism. As they are dressed casually, and only a few at the airport know what or who to expect, Morgan slips easily in behind them.

The next part requires nerves of steel. Or, in Morgan's case, a determination not to think too hard about what he's getting himself into and just employing a laser-like focus on his immediate next move. Even at a time like this, neither the airport security escort that opens the restricted-access door for the FBI, nor the G-men themselves, make a point of slamming the door shut behind them. This gives Morgan the opportunity he needs to slip in behind them. Now all he has to do is peel off the group at the very next T-junction, lest one of the FBI agents happen to glance backward for a moment or catch his reflection in a mirror.

Morgan keeps walking down the corridor alone for a few paces... then leans against a wall and catches his breath. _I don't believe I'm doing this,_ he thinks to himself, wiping his brow briefly, before turning around and following the receding footsteps, always careful to stay at least one corridor behind.

It doesn't take much to stay out of the way of the FBI - they're already involved in their own crisis and are in the midst of strangers. The possibility of infiltration hasn't come up yet.

And as Poe settles into the kitchenette area beside one of the conference rooms, he watches himself reflected in the glass of the medicine cabinet. The Caste Mark lights on his brow - but only in the reflection. It is a message - _rely on your light_.

A myriad of instincts mingle in the mind of Jet. The stag, the eagle, and the tiger are all there, but softly the fox whispers. The clever fox listens to all the voices, finding the best way of all. The bald eagle that Jet has become turns its head and rises into the air. Jet can see there is a bomb dog, kept in a pen, away from the humans. She has little time to carry out fox's plan, so she hastens herself.

The location of the dog is not convenient. Humans are not far from there. Jet knows that an eagle is something of a spectacle, so she flies near, getting the attention of one of the men near the entrance and flying near enough to make him tug at his partner's sleeve. She alters her flight to dip out of sight, wheeling back around and flying under several other planes to come around from the opposite direction and fly right down the hall that leads to the dog's pen.

Once she's at the pen, Jet seizes the clasp that holds it shut and lifts it open. The dog is given no chance to escape, however. What was an eagle suddenly is a great white tiger. There is little time to make noise, and soon Jet has slain the animal and casually tucked its corpse in a corner. The pen will be unlocked, but when the men return will find the exact same German Shepherd waiting for them that they expect.

Benford motions across the cargo bay to the other likely hiding places, and mouths to Jack. "Keep looking." Then he leads Blissett back to the accessway, talking in his ear when they get away from the presumed explosive. "Please get my bag from under seat B-2... then go back to your seat. I'm going to get this bomb off the plane. Tell the truth to the police." He smirks. "We may meet again. In any case take care of your family." Reaching the hatch, Benford fiddles an intercom handset. "I swear nobody on this plane dies before I do."

Benford lifts the headset to his ear. "My name is Charles Starrett. I want to speak to the captain. I'm in the cargo bay, trying to solve your problem. I assume you've been informed."

Benford keeps the conversation brief, thankful that he can effortlessly the crew's English accent. _I hope you all watched James Bond when you were growing up._ "I'll be direct: I'm in service to Her Majesty. I'm an expert in these matters; I've seen every kind of combustion known to man. You need to trust me, because there's no time for further explanation. I've found the device, and I'm going to to either defuse it or get rid of it. Am I being clear here? Because if you want to save your passengers, there's a few thing I need you to do."

The nervousness in the Captain's voice is obvious, just as it's obvious that he's holding up as well as he can, and will take any hope he can find. "I understand you, sir... if I take your meaning... then what do you want from us?"

Benford clenches and unclenches his right hand, a nervous habit from when he was still stick in the wheelchair. "First, turn on every beacon, radar, and transponder you have, on the highest power output possible; if there's a remote, it may jam it. Next, stay over water when you have the option. Be ready to land on VFR. Finally, I may need to open the tail hatch. Get the passengers ready for a rough ride down. Be honest with them. Give them a chance to be brave." Blissett returns with Benford's laptop bag; the scientist slings it over his shoulder. "Passenger Blissett can give an accounting to the police. And now I have work to do. I'll answer if I can, but I can't promise it."

The pilot squawks back over the intercom. "We'll do as you ask... and we'll be passing it on to the tower as well."

Benford nods, even though he knows it won't be seen. "Very well, then. Hopefully we'll get to discuss this under more civilized circumstances."

Benford hangs up the intercom and watches Blissett ascend the gangway, perhaps reluctantly. _I wouldn't want to leave it in my hands, either. _He returns to the ominous black duffel bag and removes his laptop from the bag. He removes a plastic card from an inner pocket. It's small enough to be mistaken for a PC accessory on x-ray, but is made by a famous Swiss manufacturer, and contains several useful tools. _Now then.___

__The Sidereal passes between harsh glow of overhead lighting, and long shadow cast by towers of secured luggage as he flitters smoothly between them. At some point, Jack has lit a cigarette; the glow can occasionally be seen from Benford's periphery as he moves nearby. There are many places here for a determined person such as the Bland Man to conceal himself, and Jack half-suspects that it will be Benfords activity that draws him out; he begins to hum softly as he searches, casting periodic glances back to watch over the scientist.__

__Jack is surprised, while rummaging through a largish trunk, to find something exceedingly unusual. The whole thing is filled with electronic components, oil smeared over them, and nylon and silicon fibers of all shapes and sizes. It could be the dumping ground for a broken suite of avionics or some other system of immense complexity. And sitting on top of it is a cunningly-formed latex mask. It is the face of Mr. Blank.__

__"The hell?" Jack mutters, taking a step back and a moment to clear his mind. He twists to look at Benford. "You should probably see this," he calls back.__

__In the meantime, Benford has pulled a small blade and tweezers from his SwissCard, and is carefully making an incision in the side of the duffel bag, tense for the slightest resistance that would indicate a tripwire. At hearing Jack's summons, he assumes the Sidereal would only interrupt him if it was important, earth-shakingly important. And Benford is appropriately shaken when he sees what Jack has found. He motions for Jack to pass him the cigarette and takes a long drag. While the flavor is absolutely hideous, he's just too damn shocked to choke. "Could he... could THAT..." He can barely consider.__

__"You were searching for me, I believe?" comes the radio voice. "My face will no longer be familiar to you, I'm afraid. Gentlemen, would you please refrain from further interference, now that the seriousness of my assertion has been demonstrated?"__

__Benford stalks back over to the bomb. "Why should we. You're interfering in our lives, and we're no less serious. YOU want us dead; I have no other compelling reason to do you harm. What are you? Why are you here?" _Is this some kind of magic?___

__Jack exhales and shakes his head, for once speechless by circumstance rather than choice.__

__"Consider it a case of expected utility. Your odds of being rescued by your allies on the ground is better than certain death when I detonate the bomb in mid-air, yes? In trade, my odds of destroying them improve. It is a question of how useful you expect them to be, versus how efficient you expect me to be."__

__Benford says, "You assume I intend to let you kill my allies, or the bystanders. You obviously don't care about your own survival; I can see that wherever you are, you intend to sacrifice yourself with the plane. You're describing operation, not motivation. Your 'why' is just a 'what'. Why kill do you want to kill Exalted? Do you know that while I'm trying to save these people, I'm trying to save you, as well? I don't want you to die if you don't have to."__

__The radio stays silent. "This conversation is futile," it says at last, in the same even, emotionless tone it has always used. And Benford hears a series of clicks beginning to count down - a timer.__
