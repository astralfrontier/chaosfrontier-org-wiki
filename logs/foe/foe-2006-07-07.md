The situation is tense. The conversation with the disappearing terrorist has ended abruptly, to be replaced by an ominous and unmistakable sound: the ticking of a timer, loud as thunder even among the other noises in the hold of the giant airliner.

Benford looks at Jack for a long second, searching the Sidereal's face for a way out.

The grave look on Jack's face is all the reply Benford needs. The Sidereal's mind is racing, searching for the way out he knows must be here - thus far, an effort with no result.

With no practical training in explosive ordinance disposal, Benford tugs open the bag. What he sees inside flabbergasts him.

Rube Goldberg himself couldn't have concocted a more elaborate bomb, nor built it out of a greater variety of common substances mixed with bits of unguessable technology or material composition. It's a farrago of cables, tubes, chemicals, and electronics. Benford's first suspicion is that a bomb squad technician would be left hopelessly at sea.

What he also finds, however, is that there are some recognizable pieces. A timer, perversely built from an analog pocketwatch, is connected to a jungle of wires that connect somehow to two bladders - presumably containing the binary explosive whose equation he initially saw.

A long whistle sounds from behind Benford; Jack has moved to peer over his shoulder, and is inspecting the contents of the bag with a half-amused expression. He refocuses his attention, looking to the scientist. "Can you do it?"

Benford looks back at Jack. A heartbeat passes. "Yes." Then he's into the works of the thing, armed only with the tiny tools from his hidden kit. "But get the tail hatch open anyway. Even if it's defused, I don't want to be within a mile of this thing."

Jack nods briefly, and ducks away to get to work.

One of Benford's imagined worst-case scenarios begins to unfold. An adhesive has begun to leak out of the mechanism; the bag, and the dingus with it, are glued to the deck of the cargo bay. While they might be able to wrench it free immediately, who knows how much stronger it will become?

Benford dives into the machine. _I'm not letting you win. I make machines that serve us; you make machines that torture us. First, let's see what failsafes you have._ The design, though baroque, is still comprehensible to the Twilight; he's spent is career unravelling the secrets of the cosmos, and is used to bizzare machines and obscure interactions.

While the workings of the machine are now clear to Benford, the implications of its design are still chilling. It looks less like a made thing, designed from the top down, and more like a design evolved by selection pressure... as if the units of life were gears and household cleaners, rather than DNA. _It's like it was evolved from the ruins of a hardware store. Am I looking at a machine, or an organism?_

Benford now has a plan to defeat it; but most importantly, he realizes that one of the failsafes is a tiny aneroid barometer, incongruously constructed out of a Sucrets box and a piezo buzzer from a cheap alarm clock. Benford screams to Jack, "Wait! Come back! It will go off!"

Benford uses a marker to tag a dozen wires in different parts of the device, all of which lead to various failsafes that will prematurely trigger the bomb. If he snips them in the right order, then a flaw in the design of the device will prevent propogation of the detonation signal, and allow the timer to be removed. After that, it's a simple matter to remove the bladders and isolate the binary agents, leaving nothing but a sadistically designed trigger.

Jack, halfway up the ladder to relay Benford's request to the pilot, pauses at the words; he then shrugs, slides back down the ladder, and begins to return to Benford. Once in speaking range, he nods and says, "Progress?"

Benford says, "Yes. I can have this defused in a few minutes, but we're coming down too fast. There's an altimeter on the trigger. Tell the pilot to keep a normal approach slope or he'll kill us all."

Benford waves one hand at the intercom, the other is buried in the device. "Punch channel C. Tell him you work for me."

Jack sets the channel, and holds down the transmit key to relate Benford's message; there's a brief exchange, and then the Sidereal puts down the handset. "He'll do what he can. There may be trouble in relating it to ground control."

Benford grunts. "Did I mention the part where if he doesn't do it, we all die? Hell. Can you fly a plane? Maybe you should go and show him what 'level slope' means."

_While the real Feds are holed up in the conference room_, thinks Morgan, staring at his reflection, _this is my chance to get in touch with Benford and the others._ He stands up and studies his reflection, pulling out a comb and smoothing out his hair. He rubs his fingers across the faint stubble on his chin, but remembers that one or two of the agents were sporting five o'clock shadows of their own - like him, they didn't have time to shave.

An airport employee, clutching a manila folder as he rushes from one place to another, finds his way blocked when a man steps out of the kitchen lounge and points a finger at him. "You there - which way to the control tower?" says Morgan, speaking in clipped, businesslike tones, as of a man being as polite as his impatience will allow. Seeing no reason not to, the clerk directs Morgan to an elevator, and gets a brief nod and a "Thank you" in return before Morgan stalks off.

Morgan has been in a control tower, once or twice. What he remembers is nothing like what's going on there now. At the best of times, an air traffic control tower is a realm of barely controlled bedlam; now, the room is half again as populated as its design intended, and there's nothing "barely controlled" about it. Groups of men are arguing with each other, apparently at cross purposes, in a variety of uniforms or otherwise. Most of the actual controllers are still at their desks, and look a good deal more harried than usual, which is saying something.

Amidst this chaos, no one notices another man in plainclothes... except for an official-looking man with La Guardia embroidered patches on his sleeve, who opens the conversation with "Hey you!" Morgan is undeterred. "You there!" Morgan says, with even more overtones of arrogant command. "Just the man I want to talk to. Have you made contact with the flight yet?"

Morgan's air of authority proves the stronger, and the control chief who challenged him finds himself telling Morgan everything he knows. Morgan listens with a sense of growing impatience. When he finally hears that the plane is being directed to land faster, despite "Charles Starrett's" insistence, Morgan explodes. "What the hell?" he exclaims, truly incensed. "I've got my man up there, he could be the only thing preventing the death of hundreds of people, and you're countermanding his orders?! Keep that plane in the air!"

On the plane, Benford feels the descent lightening.

A few minutes later, Benford has bypassed eight separate countermeasures and two of the three failsafes connecting to the timer. All that remains is the potentially lethal pressure sensors itself, and a last wire connecting to the guts of the wristwatch. He closes his eyes as a quick tug of the pliers disconnects the altimeter; then, realizing that they aren't dead yet, he pries the watch free of the housing with the letter-opener. Several telltales, wired in from the LEDs on the faceplate of a cheap transistor radio, go dark. Finally, the scientist clamps off the bladders with some binder clips from his briefcase, and duct-tapes them inside zip-loc baggies on opposite sides of the hold. "It's done," he croaks, standing up. "Jack, keep an eye on this pile of shit. I'm going to tell the pilot to land. Then we have to get our story straight."

Benford picks up the Intercom and dials the cockpit. "Starrett here. The thing is defused. Land immediately. And if you don't mind me asking, which part of 'Stay in the air or we all die' didn't you understand?"

The great 747 pushes through the clouds and makes a line for the runway, its descent followed by countless eyes from the ground - from Poe and Jet, to terse agents and attendants in the flight tower, to the unaware men and women waiting upon the arrival of their friends and family. It lands and coasts off, pulling to a stop a distance away from the terminal. Within moments, a swarm of black cars has pulled up around the plane, and those terse agents are stepping out to do what they may in the interests of 'handling' the situation.

Back at the tower, there's a ragged but heartfelt cheer as someone yells, "They've defused the bomb!" In the collective glee, with the radio man the center of everyone's attention, Morgan finds it easy to make his way back to the elevator, through the corridors, and back out into the main passenger terminals. From here, it's a short walk back to the window, where he can look out to see the troubled airliner finally reach ground once more.

Meanwhile, inside the plane, Jack and Benford have worked fast - most notably, to relabel the Bland Man's box of parts with an alternative destination; namely, Meyer's safehouse, where they can be later studied without first having to pry them from the grasp of some mortal agency. Jack also holds Benford's laptop bag, a decision made in the interests of continuing the 'Starrett' facade; as the foregrounded figure, Benford is more likely than Jack to have his identity examined in detail.

With the plane finally on the ground, the bomb dog that isn't precisely a bomb dog is given its chance to work. Jet has seen shows with dogs that are trained like this. They are eager, they pull at the lease, and they keep their nose at work. The man handling Jet gives a series of commands, but Jet really isn't that worried. She knows where she's supposed to go. She has to check the luggage in the cargo hold.

All around the plane, officials are swarming. It's the kind of chaos one expects. Still, most don't go close. Even with someone claiming it's handled, there is still a lot of fear. As Jet goes to work, the passengers are not allowed to depart from the plane, and each has to be carefully checked. Jet can only hope her friends can get through that layer of security.

The first scent is a light one. Jet can catch the stink of something in the air. She's not sure what it is at first, and has to delay and waste time sniffing at the aisles. She handled her share of contraband back in the day, though, and something about this is tickling that memory. She notices a scent that doesn't fit the plane, and is somehow familiar. Fortunately for her, the sense of scent is the most easily remembered.

Jet makes her way to the hold rather quickly. She finds the intense burst of scent awareness rather distracting. Not to mention how sensitive her ears are. It takes getting used to. The plane has so many scents. Most of them tinged with fear and something else. When she finds Newton in the hold, she sniffs at him, and then looks right at the bomb, then to her handlers.

Benford, meanwhile, is sitting in the cargo bay, keeping his eyes on the defused bomb. He doesn't trust it. Although obviously not alive, it looks far too organic for him to properly regard it as simply a device; and living things are always the hardest to predict. He can hear people boarding the plane above him; and there's a marked lack of noise from any of the passengers. After the last, tense hour, with the roar of the engines, and the blood in his own ears, it seems almost as relaxed as an evening at home with the fireplace. "I suppose you're still listening. Law enforcement has boarded the plane. I don't for one instant imagine that you're afraid for your own safety, but I wonder if you'd care to make me understand why you thought this was necessary."

No answer comes, nor could one come; disabling the radio has just been one in a myriad of steps to keep the bomb from going off. All that's left is ominous silence.

Hearing nothing except for the footsteps of police on the access ramp, Benford continues. "Well. I thought you might have had a contingency. But if you have some means of listening, understand this: Damn you for endangering innocent lives. Damn you for being a bad man. And damn you most of all for forcing people to waste their talents fighting bad men."
