# Fall of Eden 2006-07-28

The limo drives on, Jack in the driver's seat. Behind them, Manhattan's streets are gaining entropy as the wild chase is sparking panic among the city's drivers, not normally accustomed to safe driving in any case.

"Alright.. so we're running from some kinda.. thing," mutters Jet. She seems to be debating the next move aloud. "Okay, we need some space. This dude has lost his ride once and it's done us no good. He's already back on us. Bullets don't seem to be doing much, either.." More loudly, then, "Okay, any bright ideas?!"

"We need guns. Lots of guns," mutters Poe under his breath. Out loud, he says, "Jet and I brought a lot more with us - they're back in the car at La Guardia. We just need something to keep him busy for a little while longer."

Newton pokes his head up for a moment, looking backward at the Bronco through the Lincoln's rear window. "I've got a--" His statement is cut off with a bang, and in a spray of blood the Twilight is pitched back into the seat. He's been shot.

Jack curses loudly, and spins his head to look at Benford; he searches the scientist's gaze out, and holds it briefly. "Staunch the wound." And then he turns back to the road, keeping up the limo's frantic pace.

What Jack finds is Benford, unconscious, bleeding from the scalp. He's in no position to be taking care of himself.

"That's it.. this guy is pissing me off. It's time to stop screwing around." Jet counts off the distance in her head. How far can she leap? How far away is the Bronco now.. and how fast is it gaining? "I'll meet you at the airport. Get there in one piece.. you got it?"

Morgan grimaces as he rummages under the seat for the first-aid kit. He gets a roll of bandages out, preparing to bandage Benford. As Jet speaks, he looks up, dismayed. "No! Jet, you... how're you going to get there?" he cries out.

"Make for a bridge!" barks Jet. She looks to Poe and sighs, "You think entirely too much. I'm the only one of us who can fly, last I checked. Don't wait at the airport more than ten minutes, keep going if it gets that long. I'll call you once I get a chance if I miss you there."

Morgan sighs, and unrolls several strips of bandages, putting direct pressure on Newton's wound. He isn't exactly trained in first aid, but he knows that the idea when someone's bleeding is to stop it. "Well... good luck, that's all I can say," says Morgan worriedly.

"We'll be there, Jet," Jack says.

"Mighty effective," adds Luther, peering down at the bandage job. Morgan spares a moment to look as well, and to his surprise finds that the linens he's laying on aren't showing the red stain of blood. Either he bandaged the wrong place, or the wound has closed by itself.

"Get to the bridge," says Jet softly. She isn't sure exactly what the plan is yet. She needs to get that guy over the side. That takes him well away from cars, and maybe he's not a fast swimmer. That'd be convenient. She looks down at the seats and starts to tear her way through them and into the trunk.

The limo races onward and reaches the nearest bridge, turning - and cutting across traffic - with a squeal of rubber. Shouts of irritation flare up in the limo's wake, most of them quickly silenced as the angered drivers pick up the sound of gunfire.

The bridge is Jet's cue. She slips into the trunk and holsters her gun. After loading it with a fresh clip. Her body begins to shift there, and the space that was largely empty is filling fast as her form flows like water, moulding itself into the shape of a white siberian tiger.

Before Jet's shifting is complete, she growls out, "When I land on it.. shoot the bronco up.. blow its engine apart and get the hell out of here!" The great cat tenses every muscle then, its powerful back arching, slamming against the trunk's roof as Jet tries to break it free completely.

Jack's hands judder on the wheel as he fights to hold the limo steady through Jet's pounding; he grits his teeth and tightens his grip.

The roof of the trunk tears away, falling to the ground in front of the bronco. A moment later, the great tiger is leaping from the limo. With a thunderous crash the terrible beast slams down on the roof of the bronco, claws tearing into it with an unshaken grip as Jet allows her size do the talking and hopefully crush the bronco's roof.

The bronco's roof buckles under the weight of the plummeting beast, and the glass of every window shatters as the shape of the vehicle is changed rather dramatically. Jet is careful to do the best she can to side step the gunfire that is almost certainly going to start coming her way.

With the realization that Jet is on his roof comes immediate action. Jet feels the driver making his counterattack - twisting the wheel savagely, deliberately trying to roll the vehicle and smash her between two unstoppable forces - metal and concrete.

As the Bronco begins to swerve, Morgan leans out the window and takes a few pot shots at the opposite tire, hoping to make their mysterious assailant lose control of the vehicle, or at least be distracted.

You page, "If he botches I'm going to giggle a lot." to FallGM.

A few rounds sink into the chassis, but nothing hits something really vital. Then again, the Bronco is tipping over anyway. Then it happens - Jet can feel the vehicle lifting off the pavement.

"Your gun, Master Morgan," Jack instructs, taking one hand from the wheel and reaching back for it. The weight of the pistol's barrel is soon in his hand, and Jack turns his head from the road as well - relying on what he's seen ahead to guide the limo through the next few seconds. The sheen of light on Jack's tinted glasses shifts as he adjusts his gaze minutely, and reaches out for that _other_ sense - the new one. He can feel, on some have-conscious rudimentary level, the strand of fate that connects his next bullet to the world. He uses all the spiritual will he can muster to nudge it; to master it. To search for that one moment where _it_ and the vitals of the Bronco connect. He pulls the trigger.

The undercarriage of the vehicle is now in view, and - as it rolls up - the bullet connects, slamming into the Bronco's fuel tank. Jack turns his gaze away after verifying his accuracy, both to return to the road, and to shield his eyes from the explosion. Poe's weapon clunks back into the rear seat.

With the vehicle's tank hit, Jet has to make her call, and make it quick. She looks to the side of the bridge and does not hesitate. Using the tilt of the bronco to her advantage, she leaps off, the form of the tiger barelling over the side of the bridge and plunging towards the water below. Yet it will never hit. Even as she falls, Jet is changing again.. her body rippling, and shifting to the sleek form of a bald eagle.

Jet falls fast. Far faster than she expected. She wishes she paid more attention in school. Only in the very last second can she pull out of her dive, her breast skimming the very surface of the water as she evens out, and then quickly climbs again, using that incredible speed to her advantage.

Behind Jet, the Bronco tumbles off the bridge. The driver's side door is torn off and the motorcyclist spins out of his wounded vehicle. He impacts the water like a hammer, while on the bridge the 4x4 bursts into flames.

Jet's first thought is one of infinite gratitude. That was luck, and she knows it. After a few very careful circles above the water, she turns herself towards La Guardia, aided greatly by the trail of complete chaos that points back towards it. She flies free, but she flies with care, as well. She doesn't want to get any more attention focused on her.

From an aerial vantage, Jet can see two packs of black-and-whites converting. There's a fire engine and ambulance as well.

Jet decides to take a bit of a detour. From above, she can see things pretty clearly. She needs to head these cops off. She's going to start with the group that is coming from behind, and fly ahead, seeking an area where traffic is tight to make her move.

Jet swoops down first to stun a man just purchasing a hot dog from a street vendor. The ketchup bottle he was just about to use is suddenly gone, stolen by a bald eagle. This makes for a handy projectile, to be sure.. but how to use it most effectively?

Jet's decision is to use it on the people who aren't good at driving. The cops are skilled. The oncoming traffic is not. She picks out a nice, big van and flies full tilt right at it. Only in the very last moment does she slam forward her wings, rocketing upward and letting fly the bottle at the windshield.

The bottle slams into the windshield as the eagle ascends sharply away. In that moment of horror, the driver's view is completely obscured by the thick, red stuff. The poor sap probably thinks he just splattered a bald eagle, too.

There's a fender-bender, but the black-and-whites are on a higher priority call. One loses paint on his passenger side, but the rest of the pack move on unscathed toward the primary crime scene. One thing Jet knows is that this will generate more calls - HQ will be unhappy with whoever is doing all this, but they will be that much more burdened.

The deadly assailant is dealt with for now, but New York's Finest are still in pursuit. As Jack weaves in and out of traffic, Morgan leans forward. "I've got an idea," he says. The plan is to ditch Morgan at the mouth of an alley, while the rest go on to stage a fiery death for the limo. Meanwhile, Morgan will 'appropriate' another vehicle and pick up the rest of the party before the cops can find their trail again.

Jack nods, his gaze tight. The cops are good, and - combined with numbers and the home-ground advantage - Jack knows he cannot evade them indefinitely.

"Hang on, Morgan," Jack advises, hand working the gearstick as the limo exits the bridge, roaring back onto Long Island. The wailing of sirens ever-closer, buildings pass in a blur as Jack makes a beeline for the northbound 8th Avenue, and turns the limo into it. Heading south.

The scream of sirens is almost drowned out by the disbelieving blare of carhorns, squealing of brakes, and shouts of protest. A bead of sweat forms on Jack's forehead as the limo barrels along, and he pulls it to one side to ride the curb for as long as he can. Already, the crunching of colliding metal has started.

A blue SUV, seeing the limo's approach, slams to a sliding halt - blocking the curb. Jack pressed his brakes in return, slewing the limo out to one side - almost stretched lengthways across the road. The SUV catches the rear of the limo as it moves nonetheless, and - with a crash that rattles the limo's occupants - swings that part back around, placing the limo in a southward direction once again. It continues, picking up speed again quickly, while the SUV comes to a rolling, crunching halt against an already-stationary car.

The limo takes the next turnoff, and quickly coasts down a series of side-streets before rolling to a halt. Their pursuit is gone. "This is your stop, Morgan."

Morgan nods. "Thanks! Meet up with me by Madison Square," he says, quickly climbing out of the car and ducking into a nearby alley. As the limo roars off, he emerges, his cell phone tossed into a dumpster as he strides down the street like a man who knows exactly where he's going and isn't going to let anyone get in his way - which, as he knows, is the only way to get anywhere in Manhattan pedestrian traffic.

A few blocks away, a busy parking garage is well out of the commotion on 8th Avenue, doing business as usual. "'Scuse me! I'm boxed in on P2 row 3!" calls a voice from the back of the garage, and the valet on duty hurries back to find out what is obstructing Morgan's alleged car. A few moments later, Morgan emerges from between two cars and casually strolls over to the valet station, picking up the ticket pad. "Leave your keys in the ignition, please," he matter-of-factly instructs a harried-looking businessman, tearing off the claim stub and handing it to the driver.

The driver is in a hurry and doesn't even blink as he snatches up the ticket stub and strides off. Morgan climbs into the driver's seat and drives down the parking lot, then executes a quick three-point turn and leaves the lot again, waiting for the hapless driver to duck into a building before pulling out. A few moments later, a slightly confused valet returns to his station, mumbling something about 'goddamn pranksters.'

Not long after dropping Morgan off, Jack stops to let Luther and Benford out in a different side-alley. Overhead, the news corporations have caught wind of events; the thrum of a helicopter's rotors can be heard as it scans the ground for the limo. Fortunately, the tall buildings give enough cover that Luther and Benford's release goes unnoticed; they'll head to Poe's meeting place, and Jack will meet them there.

The dropoff complete, Jack listens again for sirens - and, this time, drives towards them. It doesn't take long to find a clump of police cars, and - as the Sidereal guns past them - the cops fall into pursuit. He doesn't have to go far this time; the original bridge won't serve, but they are spaced evenly enough along the Island that it's a short distance to flee to the next.

As he rounds the bend to drive across the bridge, Jack lets the back of the limo slide out a little - enough to bump the curb, slowing him down and giving the police an opportunity to catch up. To an observer, it would simply seem a momentary loss of control. Overhead, a beam of light shines down on to the limo - the news chopper has homed in. One of the pursuit pulls alongside the limo, and the policeman driving screams mutely above the siren for Jack to stop.

He doesn't listen, instead reaching to undo his seatbelt. Jack then wrenches the wheel of the limo, slamming the police car out to one side - and then fakes a further loss of control, breaking hard as he wrenches the wheel to recover from the slam. The limo slides - apparently out-of-control - into the concrete railing lining the bridge, and then rides up and ploughs over it - and over the edge.

The limo rotates as it falls; the footage that the chopper takes home is of the passenger-side as it disappears from view beneath the bridge, and then re-emerges to plummet with a loud splash into the water. They never see the driver-side door open, nor do they see the dark-suited driver pull himself nimbly free, and use the roof of the falling car as a springboard to leap towards the bridge's metallic undercarriage.

The Sidereal's fingers catch on the edge of a girder, and he grunts in pain as the near-miss wrenches his shoulder painfully. He hangs there for a moment, blinking away the daze and pain of a sudden halt to his fall, before reaching up with his other hand and hauling himself to - relative - safety. Then he lights a cigarette.

As Luther escorts Benford to Madison Square Park, looking for all the world like a man escorting a drunk friend, a late-model white Acura Integra pulls up beside the two men. "Right," says Morgan, unlocking the car doors. "Get him buckled in, and then I'm going to go round the block again." After all the trouble they've gotten into today, he'll be damned if he's going to blow the game because a cop noticed he was double-parked, and even the Exalted can't find a street space in downtown Manhattan in the late afternoon.

It takes another few trips around the block before Jack finally turns up, looking rather the worse for wear - but still alive. Morgan doesn't hesitate to yield the driver's seat; after having seen Jack's driving, there's no question as to who gets the wheel. "We'll ditch this ride somewhere outside La Guardia. That place is probably still crawling with cops and feds, and I don't want to drive this right in there."

Jack nods, massaging his sore shoulder. "Let's get it done, then." And he puts the car into gear.

---

The Acura is left double-parked a few blocks away from LGA - with Morgan, Luther, and Jack all making sure to wipe every surface they touched - and the three stroll into the parking garage. If Morgan had had any trouble finding his vehicle, the eagle perched in the rafters above it would be a sure hint. Morgan spares but a moment to give Jet a relieved wave before unlocking the truck and opening the boxes. "I'm sure I don't need to tell anyone to keep the hardware below window level until we get out of the City or our other friend shows up again," he remarks tiredly. If there's a firearms law in the Big Apple that this truck isn't breaking, Morgan would need a lawyer to find it.

Jet drops from her perch and swoops right towards Poe. Just a foot away she spreads out her wings and climbs into tight loop-to-loop. In mid-air she shifts this time, and with a touch only a little louder than a cat's feet she settles on the ground, a woman once more. She stretches her arms nonchalantly and lets out a deep sigh. "Okay, let's get the heck out of here. I've had enough of New York to last me at least a week or two."

MANHATTAN, New York -- A deadly high-speed chase through the streets of downtown Manhattan caused several injuries and major traffic snarl-ups today - at one point blocking two southbound lanes of the West Side Highway near the convention center as emergency crews cleared away a flaming Bronco 4x4.

The limousine that started the chase managed to dodge police for half an hour before finally driving off the side of Williamsburg Bridge. The driver and any occupants were not found, and presumed to be still at large...
