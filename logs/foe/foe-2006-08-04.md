# Fall of Eden 2006-08-04

As the Exalts pull out of the La Guardia parking lot, Morgan remarks dryly, "All right, show of hands. Who here thinks we lost our strange assassin for good?"

Jet doesn't raise her hand. She's busy using the back of the van, anyway. Hopefully nobody is terribly shy, since she's changing clothes. Too many people saw her, and she's going to switch as much as she can as quickly as she can. An ex-stripper is hardly going to have problems doing this with strangers around. She does mention, "He hit the water like a ton of bricks. So he'll be slowed down at least."

Jack scowls. "He - It - is not giving up that easily, no. We need to put some distance between us. Time to decide how we're getting rid of it."

Benford raises his hand, but not in acknowledgement. Instead he checks his bandage, amazed that his brains aren't leaking out. "It moved like Jet. It's tough. And if it's like the guy on the plane, it's monomanically ruthless. The best way to get him to do anything is to convince him it's the best way to kill us."

Morgan grins at Benford. "Welcome back. Looks like you heal up pretty quick these days," he remarks. "But as far as I can tell, the best way for him to kill us will still involve catching up with us. So we need to go somewhere where we think _we_ have the means of killing _him_."

"Sounds great," Jack says, not without a hint of characteristic dryness. "Any idea what those means are?"

Benford looks back into the bed of the truck. "This arsenal looks like a pretty good start. Did we rob someone while I was out?"

Morgan grins. "Well, we _did_, but that's not where we got all these guns."

Jet's clothes come flying out from the farthest back seat in the van, and she starts slipping on a dress skirt. "Oh, those little things? They are just part of our collection. I wanted a tank, but they can't really drive on highways, and the mileage is a killer."

"Anyone but us would think we're dangerous crazies," Luther remarks with a hint of humor, even under the circumstances. "Let's remember that."

"Besides, I don't know how to drive a tank, and I couldn't ask her to drive the _whole_ way," remarks Morgan, and then nods to Luther. "Yeah, I think we'd have a hard time if we drove up to the nearest steel foundry and asked the foreman very nicely if we could borrow a vat full of molten steel."

Jack smirks. "Luckily, we wouldn't have to ask if it came to that." The indicator ticks steadily, and the car slides around another corner. "In any case, up until now we've been running blind; disoriented, fleeing at this thing's approach. You can't win like that. At least making a stand gives us an outcome other than defeat."

Benford says, "Well. If we're going to Atlanta, we'll be going through New Jersey. There's plenty of industrial unpleasantness there, as I recall, and we'd be less boxed in than in Manhattan. Jack is right. We need to pick a place to fight this thing. Someplace we can threaten it." He rummages through his jacket, looking for a bottle of asprin. "And maybe find a pharmacy."

Jet sits up in the rear, pulling on a white blouse. She's going more professional for the trip, it seems. "There, hopefully I don't look quite like a gun-toting eccentric now." She slips on a pair of glasses to complete her little transformation. "Now we just need to get you boys dressed decently and we'll not be leaving a trail even a blind twit could follow."

Per Jet's suggestion, everyone else changes into more pedestrian outfits as Jack maneuvers the big truck through early afternoon traffic on Interstate 278, crossing Staten Island. The pace is brisk, but if the mysterious assassin is nearby, he's not showing himself. At Benford's insistence, Jack pulls over at a payphone so the Solar can call Hel. With the truck parked just a few feet away, and the engine running, the urgency of the situation is impressed upon Benford. He grits his teeth as he enters the international calling card number. _Another electronic fingerprint..._

Hel answers after several rings, his voice calm. "Yes, Doctor?"

Benford says, "We're running... for now. But we'll have to fight soon. I think you're sending us to Atlanta because we'll find something we need there to fight this thing. Am I right?"

"Something like that. Things are unusually unclear for us right now. It sounds like Luther is in the same position, since you are calling me instead of relying on foresight from either him or Jack."

Benford frowns, and looks back into the car. "I think I owe them an apology, then, for not asking them first. But you'd mentioned Atlanta. I thought... maybe someone had contacted you."

"Someone had. He is one you've met before. Even I don't know his name." Hel sounds diffident, but continues. "That Sidereal has always had an answer of some kind in the past."

_An enigma even to Hel. Interesting._"Very well, then. We'll be in touch, eventually."

Back in the van, Jet is getting rather anxious. She does her best not to show it, but she does keep her eyes open. She has done all she can to make damn sure nobody is tailing them. Considering events so far, it seems very likely to her that the pursuer is not alone, but has a network of somekind supporting him.

"There's one more thing," Hel adds. "The men's restroom won't be occupied." And with that, he hangs up.

Benford hangs up, and slips back into the truck. "Hel sends his love. He also says the men's room won't be occupied. I guess that means that if anyone wants to go, now is the time." It seems clear from the way the scientist is sitting, that he's trying very hard not to think about going to the washroom.

"Did he say how long it will be open?" asks Jet. "Cause if you had some time, we could use something with a bit of a kick to it, in case we have trouble again and a river isn't handy. I don't want to delay too long, but if you can make us something that evens the playing field, it's worth it."

Jack feels a sudden lurch in the van, and recognizes the sensation immediately - a tire has just gone flat. He looks around rapidly, out the windows, only to see a figure rising right in front of the truck, on the left - a man wearing a trucker's outfit, a Mariner's baseball cap perversely cocked over a head which has no face. In his left hand is a knife.

Benford shouts, "Jack! Get us over by the john!"

Jack's eyes narrow at the sight of their pursuit, and his gaze meets with Jet's in the rearview mirror for an instant. And then his hand is on the stick, and the van lurches into reverse - Jack allowing the drag of the flattened tire to slew the vehicle a full 180 degrees around, the rear of the van - where Jet is seated - now pointed towards their assailant.

The back pops open and Jet launches herself out, letting the momentum of the vehicle throw her from the van. She catches the force on the pavement with both hands, and lets the raw speed of her motion keep her legs moving forward, so that both her feet might slam into the head of this thing that keeps chasing them.

The faceless faux-trucker is pitched over, losing the knife in the process. It lands with a solid thump on the asphalt of the parking lot, with Jet crouched atop it.

The chauffeur's hand tugs on the stick again, and it changes direction with a head-snapping lurch; Jack now fighting with the wheel to point the van towards the toilet block. He doesn't spare a glance back at Jet, but does will for her to hold out.

Jet grabs the knife with her left hand, and kicks herself back towards a pump. While a wide-eyed customer looks on, Jet chops right through the gas hose with the knife, sending fuel pouring out behind her and towards the enemy, then leaps agilely onto the car.

Benford grabs the biggest handgun he can see and readies it with a speed that surprises himself. As Jack slews the van towards the toilets, he gets ready to jump out the side door, hoping he's not completely misinterpreting Hel's cue.

The attacker kicks off the asphalt with both feet, hands planted behind him, executing a flawless backflip and resuming his feet. He dances out of the way of the spray of gasoline. Meanwhile, the travelers and truckers nearby are already running for cover. Out of the corner of her eye, Jet can see a couple drivers going for their long-nosed cabs, and she suspects they are arming themselves as well.

Jet leaps from the car to the pump top, and then kicks offs one of the columns to throw herself higher still--and right at the truck driver. At the very last second, she reaches out and snares the slight lip under the roof, trying to flip herself up on top of it.

Benford piles out of the side of the cab, a little worse for his earlier injury, and kicks open the door of the men's room, ducking inside quickly.

What he finds inside is an unconscious, and half-naked, body - a balding man in his 40's. He is wearing nothing but a white tank-top and boxers. The rest of his clothes, which Benford estimates would fit the faceless attacker quite well, are missing.

Benford says, "And I bet he's a Mariner's fan. Shit." He glances quickly around the room for any sign the faceless thug may have left behind.

Morgan grabs a spare Beretta, jumps out of the van, and heads over to join Benford, using the van for cover as long as he can. "Didja fall in?" he remarks drily through the door, while watching Jet and the assailant, waiting for a chance to make a difference.

Jack snatches up a gun of his own, pulls the slide back with a snap, and leaps out of the van to aid Jet; he raises the weapon as he runs to join the fray, and the sharp retort of gunfire fills the air.

Benford shakes his head. "Too much to explain." He peeks around the edge of the building. Jet's brawl is amazing to behold; it would be beautiful if it wasn't his friend's life at stake.

The attacker swiftly dodges and twists away from the gunfire, though he is clearly not armed.

"So you did find something, then?" says Poe. "Lemme have a look... oh." Poe is suddenly all business as he sees the unconscious figure, and his trained eyes take in the scene. Benford may be of the Caste devoted to knowledge and wisdom, but he hasn't been working the crime beat for five years. Poe has, and wonders what he might see that Benford would've missed.

Benford, meanwhile, is rapidly scanning the trucks, thinking faster than he's used to. _I've seen this movie before. They always kill it with some kind of heavy hardware. And this is the road to New Jersey, which does have the reputation for toxic waste..._ He bolts from one side of the van to the other, looking for the telltale DoT hazardous materials markings, trying to find the most dangerous truck on the lot. And then, against all sense, he'll be running right for it.

Outside, Jet and Jack realize that the assailant has changed tactics. He is not interested in going after them; instead, he turns and begins sprinting for their van.

Inside the restroom, Poe is aware of what happened. The slight damage to the hinges, the impact marks, the position of the fall, and more signs all tell a familiar story. The man was pushed into the restroom, knocked unconscious, forcibly stripped of his belongings (in this case, clothing) and discarded. He will probably need treatment for concussion, and his short-term prospects are not ideal unless he can be hospitalized.

On the other hand, Poe realizes that the man may have a singularly valuable story to tell - how he got ambushed, and when and where. Is it worth risking the Circle to find it out?

This is just the thing to take the rational, human side of Jet and totally silence it. The metal on top of the roof sounds out her footsteps, and with the roar of a furious beast she throws herself full-tilt at the retreating enemy, both hands bringing down the knife with her whole body behind it.

The fleeing trucker spins suddenly, hearing the roar. With flawless, inhuman precision it tilts out of the way, driving an elbow downward to slam into Jet's hands. The shock of the impact is enough to make her drop the knife, and it falls neatly into the boot-sheath strapped to the enigmatic attacker's left boot.

Jack grimaces at that display of agility, but nonetheless lines himself up with the attacker's path. As it moves to run past, Jack steps in and swings a fist, counting on the attacker's momentum to add force to his blow - should it connect.

Though not as gracefully, the entity at least manages to evade Jack's punch. It wheels, confronting the pair, and in a surprising move tips its hat with one hand in a gentlemanly gesture.

Benford finds what he's looking for. "Poe! Luther! That truck! He'll follow us over there!" Not waiting to explain, he takes off across the parking lot.

Morgan emerges from the bathroom, still thinking about what he's seen, just in time to witness the strange figure gesturing politely to Jet and Jack. Benford's shout cuts through his thoughts, though, and he follows hot on Benford's heels.

The entity's head swivels toward Poe and Benford just for a moment, then returns itself to Jet and Jack. It seems patiently waiting, since the pair have engaged it.

"This is so fucked up," curses Jet. "Kiss my ass, you faceless prick!" Jet's not a lady right now. She twists her whole body, winding like a spring before the energy at least is unleashed, bringing her leg around in a whistling high kick.

The spin-kick connects with the brim of the hat, sending it spinning off the enigma's head with its fury, but he pulls away just enough to evade the brunt of Jet's foot.

The impetus of Jack's missed overextension unbalances him; rather than fight it, he lets it carry him through - twisting in a full circle, and using that time to bring his gun to bear once more. He scowls, and tugs on the trigger.

Again the thing dodges with insane ease, showing no further flashes of emotion beyond the anomalous hat-tilt.

Benford runs towards a flatbed trailer on a far corner of the lot. It's loaded with large blue plastic drums, each larger than a hog's head. They are held onto the trailer by tarps and chains. Diamond-shaped placards along the sides of the trailer advertise the unpleasant nature of the contents; corrosive, combustible, toxic. Lethal to humans; probably even worse for machines. He scrambles up the side of the cab, motioning to Poe. "This is the trap. We're the bait. Don't get any on you." He puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles loudly towards the faceless stalker. "Hey! Mirrorshades!"

Morgan climbs up with Benford. "I sure hope you know what you're doing," he says.

"I don't," he replies. "But for the record, I'm glad to have met you all."

When Benford's yell fails to distract the faceless one, Poe decides to yell at people who will listen. "Guys! Bring him this way!"

Jet isn't precisely sure of this 'plan'. She does know she wants to immobilize this slippery bastard, though. She moves like a snake, even hissing as she falls first into a crouch, and then dives up at the faceless one, throwing her arm out as if to tackle him around the chest, but instead spinning her body about his, trying to wrap her legs around his neck and crush him.

The entity thus - apparently - safely held, Jack steps forward and lashes out with a fist; he aims it at the spot where the base of a human's spine would be located.

The fist slams home with a splintering crunch; and is withdrawn with a loud curse. "Jesus!" _Feels like hitting a wall_.

From his perch aboard the truck, Poe watches the fight - Jack and Jet seem to have it pinned down, but don't seem to be doing much damage to it. "It's not attacking _us_ except in self-defense..." murmurs Poe, loud enough for Benford to hear. "It just slashed the tire... it's trying to keep us here."

Morgan straightens up. "Be ready, Benford. If I'm right, it's gonna come for me," he says, as he hops off the truck bed. No time for subtlety this time - he rips off his shirt and wraps it round his hand, then takes his wristwatch off and wraps it around his knuckles. "All right people! We're getting out of here!" he yells, and begins to bash at the truck window.

Benford realizes what Morgan is doing. _And if he tries to stop us..._ He pulls back the slide on his Baretta, studying the chains holding down the toxic barrels. _Either way we win._

Jet knew this thing wasn't going to give up. Every muscle flexes, and her body shifts, not just like a human's, but for a moment flinching from his grasp with the sinuous motion of a serpent. Even her eyes flicker reptilian for a moment, and again she hisses in anger.

Morgan looks over at Jet, Jack, and their foe - they're still locked in stalemate. He looks at the truck's window. His brow furrows. "Right!" he says, and brings his arm round hard, as if the truck's window had offended him personally. Over and over again, until the window breaks or he does.

Benford sees where this is going, and jumps down from the cab. They still need to do something about the van, and the guy in the bathroom; and Benford doesn't want to be near the barrels if they break.

An explosion of shards resounds across the parking lot as Poe's fist goes through the window, and he gingerly reaches through the hole to unlock the door. He throws the door open and kneels down under the hood, pulling out his pocketknife and keys as he works on shorting the ignition.

Jack pulls out his gun, looks at it apprehensively, and shrugs. Then, after stepping back a short distance, he levels it at the back of the enigmatic _thing_ and fires. _Let's see if that resilience extends to bullets_.

Jet continues her struggle. The effort is clear on her face, as is the concentration. For every swing of his arms, her body turns, so that the clinch is changing constantly, the hold shifting. She tries to grab for the enemy's wrists and force him even more still, force him to bend until his body shatters.

Benford rushes back to the washroom and drags the mugging victim over to the van. Finding a first aid kit, he does what he can for him.

Morgan brushes the hair out of his face and ignores the glass shards lying around him as he works. He's only tried this a few times before, and never under time pressure. But determination lends him strength as he sorts through the tangle of wires under the steering column, looking for the pair that'll start this thing.

Morgan winces as a shower of sparks erupts from beneath the column, but keeps his car key pressed against the exposed copper until the big engine rumbles to life. Quickly brushing the glass shards off the seat with his shirt, he climbs in and shifts into reverse, looking out the open window at the tableau behind him. "Here I come!" he calls out as he presses on the accelerator, the barrels rocking ominously as the vehicle rolls backward in fits and starts.

Benford hears the truck start, and steadies himself against the side of the van, taking aim at the faceless man from across the lot. _If that think survives the toxic waste, we've got a real problem._

Jack steps clear of Jet and runs back over to the van while Morgan's truck approaches; he ditches the pistol, and roots around for a while before finding what he was looking for. He loads and pumps the black semiautomatic shotgun, beginning to run back into firing range.

Maintaining her hold is getting more and more difficult. Jet can sense her enemy ready a greater effort. As it swings back its right arm to gather force, she slackens her hold and shifts her body, wrapping one thigh around the thing's neck, and the other under his armpit. The arm swung back she will snare with both hands at the wrist, and pull on as hard as she can, trying to either shear off its head with the crushing power of her legs or tear its arm out of its socket.

Morgan leans far out the window, and steers the truck slightly so that it'll roll past Jet and toward the spilled gasoline, then shifts the truck into neutral and leaps from the cab, wincing as the pavement rasps against his bare skin.

Jet sees that the truck is finally in her range. It doesn't matter if the one she holds knows what she has in mind. She's got him right where she wants him now. With a roar she shifts her body, faster than she's moved in her life, and the whole while she keeps hold of that wrist and spinning as she hammer-throws the enemy up into the truck's dangerous payload.

Jack sprints as the assailant is thrown, racing up the side of a petrol pump and propelling himself bodily into the air, the arc of his descent to carry him over the enigma's own airborne path. He lines up the shot, letting two shotgun blasts off in quick succession at the assailant below; to carry him at greater speed into the barrels, and to ignite the first ones.

The lashback of the twin shots alters Jack's own arc; flipping him over to soar feetfirst onto the far side of the truck. He rolls when he lands, and then carries that roll into a run away from the detonation.

Whatever was in those barrels certainly justified the ominous Department of Transportation placard the truck sported. A deafening BANG resounds across the parking lot, the shockwave nearly bowling Jack and Jet over and sending Morgan sprawling, and an incandescent ball of flame blossoms from the back of the truck bed, blinding any of the onlookers who'd been looking in that direction. The glowing white flame fades to yellow, then red, and gives way to a plume of oily black smoke that drifts lazily upward in a twisting dark column, as the gasoline blazes merrily in its pool around the ruined semi.

There is a distinct sensation of something _leaving_ the center of the blast, of a jerking or moving or swerving. It feels like a leash has suddenly snapped and is jerking something back. Morgan feels it most keenly, and as he stretches out his hand, he feels a sudden tingling - as though something has entered his body. Something etheric, and warm.

Morgan climbs to his feet, his tattered shirt still dangling from his hand. "We got it," he whispers, looking down at his other hand. "Or did _something_ to it, anyway." He needs to talk to someone who knows about this sort of thing... Hel, maybe, or the Man. He turns away from the blaze to rejoin his companions. "All right, people, get that tire changed and let's _move_!" he calls out, in an authoritative voice. He wants any mortals within hearing to have the impression that this was _supposed_ to happen, somehow.

Jet turns to the van and stretches the lazy stretch of a cat. No matter how messy things are, she's going to walk away as if it were all just like she meant it to be. Her only grand pronouncement: "I need a nap... and a hot bath." And with that, she swats out a little patch of fire on her skirt and heads to the van, hoping someone else is going to change the tire.

Benford asks Luther to leave the mugging victim somewhere that he'll be found, and gets out a tire iron. _Yep, that PhD from Princeton is sure coming in handy today._

Jack pushes himself to his feet, shaking his head and dusting off his suit. "Let's get out of here." With only a slight limp, he heads to help change the tire.

The arrangements are made, and the Circle departs with all haste once the spare tire has been affixed. The confused squawk on police radios and extensive questioning of all those found on the scene will continue long through the day, but by then the culprits are long gone. The car is again changed, and the white rental that leaves New York comes under no suspicion.

As yet another new car carries the five Exalts southward, Morgan mutters, "Well, that was the worst New York trip I've ever had. I didn't even get to see the Statue of Liberty."

In the back, Jet is not quite able to get her nap. She sighs and sniffs at the air, then snorts. "Ugh, now I stink of unwashed trucker.. remind me to be more selective about who or what I wrap my thighs around." It was just too amusing to not say it.

Morgan blushes, but says nothing.

Benford sits sullenly in a back seat. He can't fault his friends on attempting to relieve the situation with humor, but he doesn't share it. _This isn't good. We can match them physically... so why do I still feel like we lost?_

---

STATEN ISLAND, New York -- Another violent incident rocked New York City as mysterious figures turned a gas station into a war zone. According to witnesses on the scene, four people in an unmarked van reacted violently to another man who approached the vehicle, assaulting him with fisticuffs and gunfire before throwing him onto a truck bed loaded with volatile chemicals and setting it ablaze.

The assault ended almost as quickly as it began, and the four attackers left the scene before police could arrive. The van was found later abandoned in a ditch near the New Jersey border. Police did not release the identity of the victim...
