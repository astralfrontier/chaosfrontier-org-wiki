# Fall of Eden 2006-08-18

With Poe off to chat and the sidereals off doing.. whatever it is they do, Jet is left to think. Or mostly just brood. She keeps looking to Benford and finally says, "I suppose I should be welcoming you to America, huh? You know, this isn't really working out as well as I hoped. I didn't really want to shoot the hell out of New York and blow up a gas station."

Benford smiles. "I appreciate the greetings. I guess this is the first chance we've had to talk to each other like human beings, isn't it?" He waves a hand, taking in the expanse of the town. "I used to live here, you know. I didn't think my first day back would involve so much violence."

"I have a feeling that someone is trying to kill us before we find out what we are capable of together," says Jet softly. "You lived here? I didn't know that." She laughs, "Then again, we didn't really get to talk much. It's all been business. I just wish I knew what we were supposed to be doing here. It's all gone wrong, and they seem to have us at every turn."

Benford nods, his smile fading. "I don't like it, either. I hope that Poe's phone call doesn't draw in another blank-faced killer, like mind did." He looks around nervously. "I wish Jack and Luther would get back. It doesn't feel right to be split up for too long."

Jet sniffs at the air and nods. "So far, things are quiet. I won't lie, though. I'm expecting another attack." She hardly seems tense, though. "I won't hesitate. It's what I'm meant to do for us, I think. I seem to be the most effective killer in our pack."

Benford stares at Jet, obviously shocked. "There's more to you than killing, miss."

"Perhaps, but so far that seems the most intensely used," notes Jet. "I have other talents, and really, I don't enjoy it, but I won't tolerate anyone putting those I care for in danger. You are part of the family now, and it's my job to keep all of us safe. I'm not upset about that. I just wish the rest of my family wasn't the length of the continent away right now."

Benford shrugs diffidently. "We'll keep each other safe, then. So what do we do now?"

"I guess we follow the advice of our friends. They set the path, and we do our best to survive it," answers Jet. "And if we're really lucky, we might have a bit of fun on the way. Or we might just be running like bunnies."

It's around this time that Poe returns, with a fantastical tale of a 'symbiote' that appears to have attached itself to him after the gas station assailant was defeated. After the three discuss this for a while, Poe finally says, "I don't think we can learn any more about it here. Let's wait for Jack and Luther, and then move on. Perhaps the Man can suggest some way we can look into this."

Before long, the Circle's transportation pulls up with a subdued rumble, and Luther steps out with Jack not far behind. "We're back," Jack announces unnecessarily. There's a change in focus to the man, though perhaps only Benford has the familiarity to pick up on it - an old focus returned. Jack and Luther have finalised what was suspected all along; this new foe is immune to their powers of prognostication. In his usual brief manner, Jack explains this to the Circle.

Benford frowns. "If one accepts the nature of astrology... then that has some disturbing cosmological implications."

"So what you are saying is, you're basically blind," answers Jet. After a short pause, she sighs and says, "Shit." She frowns deeply and looks to the south, "I guess this means we just keep going on our way?"

"During our engagement in New York," Jack says, "I could not detect the things pattern in fate. Luther and I have.. confirmed -" The American Sidereal held a gun to Jacks head, and demanded he predict how long itd be until the trigger was pulled "- that the block on our talents is not universal. Only _they_ repel it."

Morgan nods. "Yes... that would explain why they needed the 'symbiote' to interact with humans. They're from... Outside." Noticing Jack's puzzled look, he quickly explains that after the last encounter, he picked up a hitchhiker - a 'symbiote' that claims to act as an Essence amplifier and a repository of information about humans. "Alien as they are, though, they must be like us - or at least like us Exalts - in some way, for this thing to be compatible enough to attach itself to me."

Luther joins in, gruffly. "This edge that Jack and I had is now gone against them. What we retain, ladies and gentlemen, are our brains and competence. We'd best keep using those."

Benford can't help but smile at that remark. "I'm not bothered by that. We all had those in abundance, even before our Exaltations."

Jack nods in agreement with Luther, and swallows the suspicious thoughts that rise about Morgan's symbiote - Benford has given him enough trust in the competence of a Solar to rely on Morgan as an effective judge.

Benford says, "Well then." He ticks off on his fingers. "The Man - I'm assuming someone knows who that is - has an ally for us in Atlanta. An ally would be very useful right now. However," he ticks off a second finger, "the enemy has been one step ahead of us. So I think that going directly to Atlanta would be unwise. There must be something of interest on the way." He ticks off a third finger. "Washington, DC. You don't have to believe in the Maidens to know that, for better or for worse, the lines of fate get quite tangled there. And it's on the way." And as a general comment to the team, and the Sidereals in particular, "Do we go through it, or around it?"

"All things considered, I'd just as soon give DC as wide a berth as we can manage," says Poe, frowning. "If it doesn't put us too far out of our way, I'd avoid even the Beltway. With all the 'terrorist attacks' that have been associated with our presence lately, the last thing I want to do is risk an incident in the nation's capital."

"I want to avoid places like that, as well," says Jet. "The enemy hasn't shown any concern for crowds, so all we'd do is put a bunch of people in danger." She shakes her head slowly, "We need to be more round about, I think. Back roads."

Benford nods. "The sticks it is, then."

"I can do that," Jack says with a wry grin of experience.

Jack's reflection eyes him, and Jack watches his reflection out of the corner of his own eye. The mirror image is humming to himself, holding some conversation or speech back, until finally Jack's impatience becomes visible. "What you can't see is as important as what you can, Jack," it finally counsels him. "Guard your blind spots the most. But learn to see them!"

Benford dozes as the crew continue driving in the van - safe enough to do in Luther's estimation. Sitting next to him is Selber, whose words are clearly heard despite the scientist's post-combat period of relaxation. "When you can't rationalize something, Newton, intuition is the only way you'll bring order out of chaos."

Jet, riding shotgun, stares out the window. Along the side of the road, a werewolf-like half-beast, half-woman is pacing the van. She grins ferally, and though Jet cannot see them, she can feel others - the others, the beastwoman's pack, _her_ pack - in her heart. "You will them to be safe," Lion counsels her from within. "Though you are still a weak god, and a weak animal, your prayers have power to protect them."

And Poe, thumbing through the pocket edition of Bram Stoker's Dracula, finds a handwritten note inside. The text is simple enough, and in his own handwriting: When things are chaotic, use chaos. Your enemy is as ignorant as you are. You know little of him; he knows little of you. Propaganda is your weapon.

Jet looks back at that vision, and her eyes narrow. Softly, she growls out, "A weak god, but I will be strong enough." She tenses, and forces her eyes back to the road. Whatever prayers she offers, they are not going to be spoken aloud.

The circle's drive to Atlanta, using secondary highways when possible, covers a slice of America. US Highway 1 winds its way through the New Jersey Pinelands, and then through the mixed urban blight and colonial-era historical buildings of Philadephia, before practically ending in the port city of Baltimore.

Here, Jack elects for speed over discretion, hopping west on Interstate 70 just long enough to pick up Highway 9 in Northern Virginia, completely avoiding the DC beltways, as per Poe's wishes. Instead, everyone is treated to the late summer colors of the Shenendoah National Park, as the highway winds towards the highlands of North Carolina.

Finally, after two days of trading off drivers, with the van ankle-deep in fast-food wrappers, empty bottles, and torn road maps, the team finds itself on Interstate 85, approaching Atlanta from the northeast. The tips of the towers of downtown Atlanta, inside the i-285 Beltway, become visible just as the terrain flattens from rolling hills to uneven plains south of Duluth.

The van, somewhat worse than the wear, and with the front grille encrusted with the dead bugs endemic to the American south, finally crosses Atlanta's city limits in the late afternoon of the third day, just at the start of rush hour on i-85 and i-285.

Morgan has been thinking about the message from his source, and in the long rural drive from Washington, he opens the subject to a wider audience. "Whatever our foes' abilities are, it's clear they know about as little about _us_ as we do about them. That means we've got an opportunity, while they're still learning. What do we _want_ them to believe?"

"Anything but the truth," answers Jet. "I was thinking about making them believe we're broken up and scattered again. Or maybe steal a page from daytime soaps and play dead? I'm just not used to dealing with things this way. I usually just face things head-on."

"If you're right about us being tested," Benford mentions, "they won't believe - or maybe more accurately - won't care if it seems we've given up. They'll keep coming."

"Then that's a way to know if we're being tested," observes Luther.

"And we won't be able to hide forever," observes Poe. "We aren't even sure how they found one of us in the first place. Sooner or later, another of them will try to talk to us, as they did to Benford. What do we want them to take away from that encounter?"

"In 1981, February, NATO started psychological operations against the Soviet Union. American bombers would fly straight toward Soviet airspace, just like they were making an attack run, only to peel off at the last moment. The Americans were testing Soviet radar vulnerability."

"So the Russians developed a program called RYAN. The GRU was tasked with detecting a probable American attack through intelligence gathering, since their radar couldn't guarantee detection in enough time to counteract the threat."

Morgan thinks about this. To Luther, he says, "Our foes from Outside are invisible to you and Jack. Our 'radar', if you will, cannot see them before they are upon us."

Luther nods. "But they are also doing data collection on us, so we believe that their 'radar' isn't much better. Their attacks so far have been at points where we _communicated electronic data about ourselves_ - think about that. The airplane bombing. The ambush. The telephone call. All incidents involved actions of the Shadow Synod, specifically Hel."

The Sidereal leans back. "It's not a test. Or not an evaluation, at least. They're probing our boundaries, learning who we are and where we go. Learning who we associate with."

Benford nods, slowly... "So we can possibly cause them some grief by planting false signals... by giving the misleading impression of having particular associates, resources, and objectives."

"We gain two advantages by doing that," observes Poe. "First, we learn what means of communcation are compromised. And second, we control the terms of the engagement."

"So we essentially try to make contacts, just to see what happens, and to make things as confusing as possible. Any specifics, or just whatever?" Jet smirks, "I think I could make things really confusing to them."

Benford says, "Well. We've all got our areas of expertise. CNN is headquartered here; that's an ideal place for Mister Morgan to spread some disinformation."

Benford says, "Beyond that... Luther, what's your understanding of the thing that Hel called 'The System'?"

"The System is a hard thing to explain," the Sidereal admits. "It's.... more of a philosophical construct than a physical artifact to begin with. It's a multi-layered arrangement of Essence, data, knowledge, and more. We interface with it via computers and other trappings of the modern world. So... you might take some action in a computer system that corresponds to another action in another level of the System, one with some, ah, 'mystic' effect."

"For example, we Sidereals have alternate identities. 'Luther Blissett' is an alias, just as 'Jack Jones' is. We weave our identities out of smoke and mirrors. Through the System, we add new ID records to public databases or forge driver's licenses. But those actions have a larger effect as well. When done correctly, they actually make these identities as real as those of anyone else."

"That's... hard to grasp," Poe admits. "What does 'real' even mean, in this context? An ID _is_ nothing more than data, after all. Is it just the log entry in some DMV computer saying when this application was processed, things like that?"

"If we just forged some DMV record, it wouldn't matter. But.. because we did so through the context of the System, it _is_ real. It did happen, this man actually exists, people will remember him as having existed..."

"The System is what divides real fact from mere data, I suppose."

"Any of a million paths lead to every moment in time, just as any of a million paths lead away. I think their System is forcing both the trailing and leading paths. But then... if our enemies seem to be cloaked to fate, that means that they wouldn't really be accessible to the System," the Solar scientist muses, "and at the same time, that means that they might live a gaping hole in it as well, perhaps?"

"It seems likely," agrees Luther. "Eddies in the water, where a submarine is passing, that sort of thing."

Benford scribbles on the back of an empty fast food bag: a range of dates, a set of places. "Poe's... passenger, for lack of a better word... sounded like a young man from California in the 70's. What if that's more than an accident? Is there a way we can search the system for missing persons of that type?"

Luther nods. "It's conceivable. But I lack the facilities here."

"Perhaps we can improvise," Benford muses. "But I suppose then the first thing we should do is find the other Sidereal, the one that Hel mentioned."

"Ah... that guy." Luther seems to slump a bit.

Slumbering in the back seat after a long shift driving, Jack now rubs his eyes and shifts about, giving Luther a curious look through bleary eyes.

"Oh, dear," Benford says. "It's like that, is it?"

Jet remains quiet throughout this. She doesn't really understand the discussion. She's mostly wondering how the system might be used to make her extremely rich. But that's hardly helpful at the moment. "Do they know about the system, you think?"

Luther shrugs. "They seem aware of our operations on a mundane level - the ticket booking, the phone call. But .. they didn't seem aware of either Jack or myself on the flight."

"They knew about the Caste Mark," Jack contributes.

Benford says, "Whoever they are, they have a strange relationship with the fates. Perhaps they're as ignorant of the System as the System is of them."

Benford says, "Luther, I don't want to pry, but is there some kind of problem with the man we're looking for? Hel didn't seem to happy to involve him, either."

Luther hesitates for long moments. "The secrets of the Shadow Synod are not for outsiders," he states, then relents a bit. "But you are not outsiders, are you. Just bear in mind that we don't want this information spread around. It undermines confidence in us, and... well, it makes us lose confidence in ourselves. Okay?"

Luther continues. "He doesn't have a name, or a history. He's an enigma, even to us. Every Sidereal I've ever met, every last one, has either been mentored by that guy, or can trace his apprenticeship as an Exalt up to him. We think he's the oldest one of us."

"He goes where he wants. He doesn't tell us what he's doing, or where he went, or what he found out. But he's always helped us out."

"I know who you are talking about, and The Man is reliable," says Jet. "He's pulled my ass out of the fire twice, and even set-up a meeting with the Silver Lady." At least, that's how she saw it. "And anyone that is clear by her is someone I'm going to trust."

"Then why isn't he backing us up? Why isn't he cooperating?" asks Luther. "That's why the Shadow Synod is wary of him."

Jack grunts. "It's not trusting him that makes me uncomfortable. It's having to trust him. But we'll do so, for now."

Benford says nothing. "I'm more inclined to trust people that have looked down the barrel of the same gun that I have... literally and figuratively. But there's no use trying to stare down a cloud of smoke. If that's the way it is, then let's do what we're here to do and move one."

"I trust him," says Jet flatly. "Just because he's not doing what others want him to do is hardly a sign of wrong doing. Hell, that's how I've spent most of my life."

Luther nods. "But it's like this. If he isn't helping us out by sharing what he knows, or at least operating with us.. Doesn't that reflect on our mission? Are we making mistakes he can see and is avoiding?"

"But if he is always correcting your mistakes before they happen, he is also weakening you. If he's trained you all, you are his pack," says Jet. "A pack has to grow up. It has to learn how to live on its own."

"Maybe more time with you will help me see that perspective," suggests Luther. "We'll see what the future holds, yes?"

"And hope we don't run screaming from it," Jack adds dryly.
