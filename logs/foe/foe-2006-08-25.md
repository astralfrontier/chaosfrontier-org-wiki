# Fall of Eden 2006-08-25

Atlanta, Georgia is home to over five million Americans. Those living inside 'the Perimeter' of Interstate 285 pride themselves on theur urban success; those who visit find friendly hospitality and modern convenience.

Conveniently enough, several facilities of interest exist here. The Center for Disease Control and the CNN news network, to name a few. These have attracted Newton Benford's attention. He, together with Luther Blissett, are departing to embark on a project which the good doctor doesn't speak of. He only mentions "the System" and promises to return.

It isn't clear just how the unnamed Sidereal and the "hero of the Wulin" are to find the incoming Exalts. At least, not until Jet experiences a flash of deja vu. Driving south on the Veteran's Parkway into Atlanta proper, the Lunar catches sight of a sign draped across an overpass. It reads: HEY BIKER CHICK, UP HERE. Above, leaning nonchalantly against the rail, is a man smoking a cigarette. He's visible only a moment as the van drives underneath, but his identity is clear. In a few minutes, he is standing in the parking lot of Hunt's Foods as the vehicle pulls up.

Coming out of the shopping center is a man of clearly Asian descent, carrying a small plastic sack of groceries. The Sidereal waves casually as Jet, Jack and Poe pile out, and gestures at the Asian. "Lao Xin," he announces. "Dawn Caste."

Jet is getting really used to weird things. Seeing the Man with a sign like that just seems to fit in now. "I think Alice's journey was more lucid," she mutters to herself. Upon having the introduction, she nods to Lao Xin. "I'm Jet. So you are the... What was it?" She has to size Xin up a bit, though. It's hard for someone to look menacing or dangerous with groceries, though. "Hero of something." She pays attention, see?

Jack cocks his head and grins curiously at Xin, walking around to lift the boot of the car. "Jack," he says, introducing himself.

"The Wulin," replies Xin, just as the bottom of the plastic sack tears. Groceries tumble out, but before they can even touch the ground, Xin has caught them. A can of soup is balanced on his left foot. "Lao Xin, but please, just call me Xin."

Morgan offers a handshake. "Andrew Morgan - call me Poe." He grins. "Wish I had reflexes like that. The way things are going, we're gonna need a lot of that sort of thing."

Jet turns to the Man, "So I don't suppose you are going to clue me in on what has been trying to kill us lately?" She smirks, "Or maybe you don't even know about that. We haven't exactly been eager to make a lot of phone calls lately." She watches Xin out of the corner of her eye and grins. That's promising.

"If I knew I'd be telling you. I don't, so I'm smoking," the nameless Exalt answers calmly. He punctuates this by taking a long drag, then exhaling. "But I know Xin here has something that'll help you."

Xin puts the groceries off to one side. "I will help however I can. So what has been trying to kill you?"

Jet looks around and frowns. "We're not exactly sure, honestly, but we have seen some pretty crazy shit." She starts at the start, focusing on the details of the first attack, and very vaguely adding the findings of Jack of Newton. She doesn't know what to make of that 'creepy shit'. The attack on the gas station gets far more detail, though. With an indication of Poe knowing about some more 'creepy shit' that went down when they apparently killed the thing.

"I see." Once caught up, Xin looks to the others, "Well, what is it that brings you to Atlanta? Besides our mutual friend here..."

"I'll get right to the point - we need help," Poe says. "These things are deadly dangerous, and we've had a lot of trouble trying to bring them down. And all things considered, we'd rather avoid blowing up any more gas stations. Do you think you could win a fight with something made out of a washing machine?"

"The answer we're looking for is 'yes'," Jack supplies dryly.

"Would you settle for, 'where do we find it?'" wonders Xin, stretching as he moves to join the others. "Or how about, "When do we get going?"

"Hmph," replies Jet. "At worst, we've got someone else to get hit by it," she says. "I guess the rest we just gotta see when all hell breaks loose. I just wonder if this is the first incident with this kinda thing."

"First I've ever heard," the Man remarks.

Morgan chuckles. "As to 'where do we find it...' that's probably pretty easy. We don't find it, it finds us. And it finds us when we try to make a phone call - or at least, when Benford does. We don't know who else they can track - no one else has tried using a phone since the gas station."

"First contact? Lucky us," Jack quips, helping Xin load his groceries into the boot of the car and slamming it shut. "As to departure..."

"Perhaps second contact will go better. So I guess then, where do you want to fight this thing," Xin asks, looking around. "Hardly a place for a brawl, it seems."

"Yeah, I think we kinda started off on the wrong foot with that part, Jack," says Jet. "And this is technically contact number three. The second time was when we blew up our arch-enemy, Maytag 2000." She just can't take herself seriously right now.

Jack smirks. "And I'm not sure that there really is a good place to fight these things. Through concerted effort and some fast thinking, we were able to take one down - but it's obvious that our conventional attacks ain't cutting it."

Morgan leans against the side of the van. "We don't just want to engage in gratuitous violence to home appliances, though. We need to decide what we _want_ out of this confrontation. Do we just want to send a message - 'Leave us alone'? Capture it and try to learn from it without killing it?" He scratches his head. "Mostly, though, I want some way to be able to _call_ someone without having an industrial nightmare come and try to grind my head off."

"Well I've got something to help. Some kind of unconventional weapon. Maybe I just know how to turn on the spin-cycle," replies Xin. "Is there anything to be learned from the er... bodies?"

"Funny you should mention that," Poe remarks. "Not from the bodies themselves, at least not yet - the only time we actually disabled one, it was in the middle of a puddle of flaming toxic rubble. But _something_ came loose... something magical. And attached itself to me, for some reason. From _that_, we've learned that they don't know much about life on Earth, and they need some kind of learning guide. The one I got seems to have got its information from somewhere in California."

"We could probably figure out if its maintenance was up to date," deadpans Jet. "I got to thinking, if these things take over whatever we're near, maybe we could mess with them by being near the wrong thing. What if one really was the bomb on the plane for a bit?"

Morgan laughs. "Maybe we could go on a two-hour hike and then call from a cell phone? It'll have a hard time taking over a washing machine if there aren't any around."

Xin remarks, "It might have to branch out, such as it were. Or do they seem to only take on machinery forms?"

Unnoticed, the Man has been fiddling with a PDA of some kind. He speaks up. "Hel's place has been hit."

"That's no coincidence," says Jet. "I'm guessing Hel made it away, else you wouldn't being saying it that way." She looks at the PDA and then remembers she had another question for him. "Say, you know where Roger is?"

"I don't know if Hel got away," the Man answers. "Hel's phone number routes to his chalet, normally. Now it routes to a Swiss dry-cleaner's, which is our prearranged signal that the chalet is to be written off. Doesn't say anything about dead or alive."

"Then let's go find out," says Xin, "And if you notice any appliances looking at you funny... let me know."

Poe's head snaps up. "Hel's place? By what? Another one of the 'things'?" His brow furrows. "Yeah, that can't be a coincidence. They must've tracked him through Benford, somehow. Dammit..." He shakes his head. "So now Hel's out of touch too, assuming he's still alive. They're dismantling us one link at a time. We've gotta do something about it."

"You guys said that one seemed more interested in slashing tires and delaying you? Now you know why," the Man suggests.

Poe scratches his head again. "Pretend I'm an idiot and explain to me why delaying us helps them attack Hel. I'm sure it won't be too hard to pretend," he says, grinning wryly.

The Sidereal fields this one. "Assume you don't know where two ends of a phone call terminate, but you can send guys to both ends. If they are close enough that one enemy can run to support the other, you want to stop that, yes?"

Xin says, "Sure."

"Interesting," says Jet. "We could use that for some interesting traps. If they are stupid enough to use the same tactic twice, anyway." She doubhts it.

"So they can manifest at our location, but not track it? An interesting limitation," Jack says.

Morgan thinks about this for a moment. "Okay. So... let me think out loud for a moment. They weren't able to trace Benford's call right away, so for all they knew we had a safe house in Newark or something, and they didn't want us getting away while they traced the call."

"Or maybe they could get there faster than they could identify where 'there' is," the Man replies.

Poe nods, rubbing his chin. "So they didn't know where Benford was either, until they got there," he says. "They manifest physically near the communication endpoint. If they're following the network, there's not much about a fiber-optic cable that tells you _where_ an endpoint is. Not unless you already know how the network's laid out."

Jack nods. "If that's the case, I have to wonder how _much_ faster. It could be that they'll choose caution in future."

"Unfortunately, caution works both ways," Poe says. "Right now, I think we have to assume the mundane telephone network is compromised. So that means we'll have to be careful about contacting our allies." He looks up at the Man. "What about the System? I don't know much about it, but... is it possible to communicate that way? Or are we running the risk of compromising the System itself if we even try?"

"The System isn't some magic telepathy box," the Man replies gruffly. "It's a layer above, or below, or beyond, conventional computing and communications."

Poe takes the rebuke as gracefully as he can manage. "I dunno... bad enough not being a technical person about normal computers, now I'm not a technical person about magic too." He shrugs. "Just a thought. So... we need to find other ways to get the word out. We Exalts are going to need to work together on this, and it'll be hard to do if we can't even talk."

Jet has no idea what the System is, herself, so she'll just listen. And size-up Xin a bit. She isn't sure why, but three's something that rankles a bit about this would-be alpha entering the pack. She tells the Dawn, "No offense, but I'm going to keep an eye on you." At least until she's sure that he isn't a threat to her.

"Heh, as you like." Xin shrugs, listening to the others and trying to puzzle out what they're talking about. Something about Jet has him on edge, has him feeling like he's being sized up.

Jet looks away from Xin and nods. It's funny how she was thinking how good it would be to have someone to share the load of frontline combat. Now she's not so convined. "Anyway, it's nothing personal. I'm not one of.. well, your kind. You probably can't understand."

"Ah," replies Xin. "I might not understand, but we'll see. Who knows. I may know more than you think."

Poe doesn't understand himself, and shakes his head. "As long as you two can work together," he says, sighing.

"That's our problem," says Jet. She looks to Xin, "We'll figure it out." There is a potential here. After all, they do share at least one major hobby: exerting their will through physical force.

"We will. Not here though. Not now." He's not... looking forward to this is he? Xin looks to the Man, "Where is Hel's safeplace? Maybe we should start there. Be the ones chasing them for a change."

Jack says, "unless someone else has a bright idea, that sounds like the thing to do."

"Where exactly is Hel's place?" asks Jet. She looks to Xin, "Sometimes you have to repeat a question or they miss it." She manages a grin. "And you are right. Not here. There are too many softies that might not be able to handle it." She's definitely curious, at least.

"Geneva," Jack announces. "We have to go to Geneva."

"Geneva," says Jet. "Are you suggesting we put our asses on a plane? This from the guy who was recently almost blown up in one?"

Jack shrugs. "You asked. Besides," he adds with a wink, "no gain without risk."

"It's a bit far to drive, I know that," says Poe. "Let's think about this. We could take a boat, for example," he observes. "Or try to get on the plane in such a way that they don't detect us."

"Almost. There's something not final about almost," remarks Xin, grinning, "Something inviting even. Unless you have some other plan for getting there..."

"And besides, statistically, flying is the safest means of travel," Xin adds.

"Though I'm not sure how to go about that one," Poe admits. "How did they detect Benford on the plane in the first place? They seem to go by data networks, so..." He turns to Jack. "Do you remember how you and Benford bought your tickets? How about your IDs? I know you two traveled under assumed names... where'd those come from?"

"Why are you guys going to Hel's place?" the nameless Sidereal asks suddenly. "What the fuck do you hope to accomplish?"

"Got me," says Jet. "Maybe our lack of dying has encouraged my friends to suggest a more efficient course? Personally, if I'm gonna kill myself, I'd rather do it with vices than suicide missions."

"Well, trying to find out what happened to Hel seems like a good idea, right? Now, I don't know much about how you do this... but in all the cop movies, at least the ones I remember being in, they always start off at the scene of the crime," says Xin. "I can't think of any better place to start, but if you guys can, then by all means, speak up."

Morgan shakes his head. "I seem to remember in cop movies that the heroes get better results by getting the perp to come to them. We don't have to go to Geneva to do that - we just need to figure out what we'd get out of it."

"I don't really feel like jumping continents when the last time nearly got some of us killed. I need to get back to the rest of my family, anyway." Jet means those waiting back at HQ. "Are we sure things are fine in Frisco?" Then, to Jack, "And can you tell me if me going back towards Houston is gonna cause all hell to break lose?"

"It's fucking obvious what happened to Hel," the Man grouses. "A hostile robot came out of his phone and attacked him, and he fled the safe-house."

"I cannot," Jack concedes to Jet. "Very well. The European operatives can deal with that."

"Actually..." Poe says, straightening up. "Someone attacked _me_ quite some time ago, just before I Exalted. Mary and Jet came to save me... but we never did figure out who it was. If they attacked me because I was about to Exalt, then it's probably our foes - using humans as tools - and we might be able to get more information out of them. If they were just attacking Andrew Morgan, reporter to the Seattle Times, then they are just mortals and shouldn't be too hard to deal with..."

"As good a course as any," Jack says. "Better, even. What's your plan?"

"Sounds like fun," says Jet. She doesn't really care if the opponents are a challenge. "I have a feeling that we can figure it out on the drive? It's a pretty long hike from here to Seatle." The Full Moon always gets restless.

"Then we can get moving," Jack says, gesturing towards the vehicle. "Xin, anything you need to grab before we leave?"

Xin shakes his head, "No, not really. I'm ready to go... I've always wanted to see Seattle..."

Morgan nods. "I know where I intend to start, though. We start by figuring out what the police have on the guys.... maybe we can search my place too, if the police don't have that locked down. We go from there."

"They won't have it locked tight enough to keep me out," says Jet. "But I don't have the best eyes for that sort of thing, either." She murmurs softly, "So we're off to see the Emerald City, then. I guess we'll just follow the Yellow Brick Road."

The Man hums. "Jet, you asked about Roger. He's working with some other folks I'd like to introduce you guys to. Cirque du Soleil - 'the Circus of the Sun'. The name isn't a coincidence, in case you're curious."

"You are serious?" asks Jet. She shakes her head, "They are all.. gifted? I kinda wondered how those girls can tie themselves up in pretzels. Still, recent events have made me think I need to get to working out again."

"No. But they exist to serve the Celestials," the Man replies. "Development of useful skills, a traveling troupe for concealment, colorful and concealing costumes.." He shrugs. "Made to order for you people."

"So how do I take advantage of that?" asks Jet. "Just go up and ask them, or what?" She is definitely interested. "I have a feeling you mean more than just the obvious skills, as well. Am I right?"

The Sidereal shrugs. "You tell them you want to want to talk about the new show they're doing, 'Avec Etoile'. It's a pass-phrase. It'll get you to the right people."

"I'll remember it," says Jet. "Avec Etoile. I don't suppose they are in Seattle, are they?" She looks to the Man and notes, "For the record, this is way too absurd to be a good joke." She looks to the others, "So, on to Seattle, huh? We better stop somewhere along the way. I want a hot bath. And I mean a real bath."

---

The drive up to Seattle is a long one. Xin has spent some of this time in thought... well, asleep, but when it's his turn to drive, he muses on things. "So you say this... washing machine part... attached itself to you. And you've been getting impressions from it or something? I can't say I know much about this... but it sounds to me like you're out of harmony with it. It might be trying to get you to listen up. Might be trying to bring your chi flow in line with its own, so that your energies resonate together. After all, if this is a living machine... thing... it too would have its own chi pattern. Maybe there's a way to find out something from it, eh?"

Morgan shakes his head slowly. "I... I didn't even _believe_ in things like chi before I Exalted. What you say makes sense... I think. It's got _something_ that's like what we have. Chi, Essence, whatever name you give it. And it did speak of harmonizing."

"Finding the common points between us and them will help. Perhaps that is why they are so difficult to defeat. It could be that washing machines are tough, though, but it's worth a shot to try and align your chi... or at least reach out to it." Xin continues driving. "I'll try and teach you what I can about this stuff..."

Morgan nods. "I think... I will need to know more about this sort of thing," he says, leaning back in the passenger's seat. "The world's a very different place than I thought it was two months ago..."

"You said it," replies Xin, knowingly. He starts to explain to Poe the concept of Chi, the energy that pervades and possibly even makes up the universe. He talks about meditation techniques designed to relax and expand the chi, how to direct the energy of the body from one place to another, all that kind of thing. He's even knowledgeable about this subject, though he often relates it back to his experience with martial arts... or the movies. It's familiar ground for him.

While the others talk, Jet is in the back, working on her new hobby. She's keeping a journal, though it's not really for herself. It's for the family that isn't with her. The writing is hardly professional, and Jet doesn't try to make it into a flowing story. It's mostly a record of what she sees and feels, and whenever she gets a chance, she'll give it to them so they can know what they've missed. Somehow, it makes the Full Moon feel a bit less isolated from the rest of her pack.

Morgan listens as best he can to Xin. Even after all that's happened to him, he finds it difficult to overcome his old reflexes of skepticism and debunking. Still, he perserveres. _This is important,_ he tells himself. _Without this information, we can't hope to defend ourselves. Reality will have to learn new lessons._

WASHINGTON, DC -- The ban on carry-on liquids, first instituted in 2006 and rescinded earlier this year, may be reinstated in the wake of the narrowly-averted bomb plot at La Guardia National Airport, the director of Homeland Security said today. \[...\] Critics pointed out that the bomb in question was in checked luggage, and had escaped security screening, and that therefore carry-on bans would have been ineffective...
