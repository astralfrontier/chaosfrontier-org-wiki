# Fall of Eden 2006-09-08

After reading the initial reports on the attack on his house, Poe had a few remaining questions before he and his companions headed to the scene of the attack. The closure of the file left a few leads un-followed, and they are leads that a civilian would have difficulty investigating, so Poe asks Mary to forward them to their FBI agent.

The questions are these: First, Poe needs the records on the four thugs who did the actual breaking and entering - the detailed criminal records should suffice for now. He wants to know if any of them served time together, or if they were associated with any gangs or groups that might otherwise have brought them together outside the Big House.

And second, Poe wants to know where their guns came from - or at least, where they left the legal system. He knows they didn't come from Washington state, so he wants to know where they did come from. If they all came from the same area, he has a place to look; if they came from all over, he knows that the attack on him was instigated on a national scale - which would surprise him, considering he doesn't recall stepping on anyone's toes out of state before his Exaltation.

Doing policework for the police is something any sufficiently crusading reporter must do eventually. Morgan uncovers evidence that all four men spent common time at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla, in the Ranier wing of the minimum-security area. There was opportunity enough for them to meet (or be met).

Through the Sidereals' man in the FBI, he also gets access to the BATF records for the weapons that were used. They were a consignment of confiscated firearms that were slated for destruction, but managed to "fall off the truck" before it happened. Whoever retrieved guns for these men had some pull.

It smells of an operation, particularly with the missing bodies. Enough men in force that Poe should have had no chance, with enough cleanup even with a flat failure to avoid alerting the police too much - there's nothing intrinsic to the case that would draw Federal attention.

Benford, operating from the other direction, compiles a breathtakingly thorough biographical and psychological profile of the senior staff of the Discovery Institute, specifically the Center for Science and Culture. And he discovers something very interesting.

One of the Senior Fellows is a Doctor Dal Kelton. Based on his reading, Benford reads into his psychological profile a distinct interest in social organization - including, as he discovers, a brief stint in prisoner rehabilitation.

Moreover, he is a recent addition - he came on in February, 2007. Prior to that he had a long but undistinguished career writing position papers, scientific treatises, and social commentary for outlets on both the left and the right.

Financially, Dr. Kelton is in good standing. A series of investments and a healthy estate from his parents has kept him through five decades of life. His politics are somewhat mixed, but he's no fool.

On a more personal note, Dr. Kelton has self-identified as a non-denominational Christian, though his parents were Methodists. He has done a fair degree of theological study.

He sits on the board of half a dozen other organizations, mostly small think-tanks or policy groups along the lines of the Discovery Institute. The exception is a board membership on a mid-sized real estate holding company, Sylvan Limited.

Benford pages through screen after screen of notes. "Not the sort of chap that you'd expect to be organizing rub-outs. Still... he works in the prison system, I would bet that he does some recruiting there. It wouldn't be the first time it's happened." He pushes back from the screen and folds his hands behind his head. "But that's another puzzle. Suppose that he recruited some ex-cons to kill you. It still doesn't explain why. Also, those men were a lot more organized than typical criminals. Is it possible for them to have become that effective? Or perhaps they just have exceptional leadership?"

"There's another point too," says Morgan, looking up from his laptop. "The guns came from a bunch of guns the BATF was about to melt down. Dr. Kelton doesn't seem like the kind of guy who'd have the pull to get the guns off the back of a truck. If he's involved, he's a pawn too. He may have got the thugs, but someone else armed them."

"Well, it seems like we're seeing a lot of what he did, but not a lot of why," says Jet. She's been paying at least some attention, though she's distracted. She's watching Michelle study, and it's really blowing her mind. "We've seen that the Sidereals aren't all on the same page. Can we look at The System and see if this guy was being directed by them? Is it impossible for them to have a rogue in their ranks?"

A quick question to Barry, and a few hours of investigation on his part, give a definite negative on this. "His fate is clearly written. He's mortal."

Morgan scratches his head. "He's only the tip of the iceberg. _If_ this is the right iceberg, of course," he adds. "Dr. Kelton isn't the man who supplied my assailants with their prerequisite tools, and he _also_ isn't the one who absconded with their corpses after it went bad. He's a cog in their machine - whoever _they_ may be. He might be able to tell us who else he meshes with, but we have to be careful. Pay too much attention to him, and they'll know we're on their trail."

Benford says, "Yes. We need to know what he knows. It's going to require a great deal of subtlety." The scientist grimaces. "We've had mixed results in that department."

Morgan taps his chin. "Then we'll just have to try harder. If there's one thing I know about the Discovery Institute, it's that they like to put their viewpoint out. Andrew Morgan wouldn't be able to get an interview out of him, even if I _weren't_ supposed to be missing... but maybe someone else can."

Morgan thinks about this some more, and grins. "Or... maybe we wait till someone _else_ is interviewing him. Then go pay his _house_ a visit. Break in _carefully_, and try to put everything back where we left it." He raises an eyebrow. "Which reminds me... we could take a look at _my_ house too."

"We might need more than subtlety," says Xin. He's been listening along, keeping up as best as he can. "I dunno how well this will work, but maybe you can send someone who is subtle along with someone who is... less so. Then you could always turn the tables of the interview."

With a few more hours passing, Michelle goes from studying at the table to curling up at Jet's side and reading. Jet still finds that odd. When Amy sits on her other side with a book of poetry Jet is quite certain she's stepped into an alternate universe. Not that she minds. She talks as she idly plays with the hair of her girls. "I can case his house is you want to break in," says the Lunar. "I imagine I can get in there. Most security systems are expensive shams."

Morgan laughs. "You don't say," he says. "And if his pad is unusually hard to crack, _that_ tells us something too."

Xin says, "It tells us someone with a greater interest in security than he, is watching out for their interests."

"But first," says Morgan, "_my_ place should be a lot safer to inspect. Though Andrew Morgan needs not to be seen there. Are any of you any good at disguise?"

Benford says, "Well, then. It sounds like a field trip is in order. Any opposed?" Hearing no dissent, Benford folds up his laptop. "I've decide I like America, but everything is so damn far away."

Xin nods in agreement with Benford. Though there is one point he will contend, "Except Starbucks."

As Benford packs, he continues a previous discussion with Luther. "It looks like your theory about executive cliques is bearing fruit. We have a suspect for the hit on Poe. Unfortunately, we still have no motive, and it's probable that he's just another puppet." He zips up a suitcase and hands over a manila folder. "These are my notes on the possibility of finding our mechanical opponents through anomolies in the cosmic narrative. It should at least help us identify a missing person who might have been Poe's... guest. If we're very lucky, perhaps we can use it as an early warning system." He extends his hand to Luther. "We all owe you much. I hope we're back soon."

Luther nods and smiles as he accepts the gesture. "We'll stay on it."

Later, Benford asks Amy, Becca, and Timothy to meet him in the common room. He slides some books across the table: hardbacked editions of 'The Diamond Age', by Neal Stephenson. "Jet may have mentioned that we want to give you an opportunity to learn more. A traditional education is out of the question, and it probably wouldn't suit you anyway. They leave too much out, the entire 'big picture' of the world. I'd like you to read this together. Help each other through the difficult parts. Timothy can help you with the mathematics, and I've asked Meyer to look in on your progress." He smiles. "When we get back, we'll be getting some other teachers, and some more students. For the moment, it's best that you teach each other."

Jet finds these times away from her family to be getting harder and harder. She hugs Timothy fiercely, and smiles at him reassuringly. "Now you be good while I'm away. Keep up your studies and do your best. I believe in you." She kisses the top of his head and then ruffles up his hair. The girls get affection of a different kind. The Lunar has made no secret that her relationship with her girls is extremely close. Each girl gets a kiss, and Becca is left blushing and rather weak in the knees by hers. "I'll be back as soon as I can. Have fun, and take care of each other until I'm back." More quietly she says, "And be sure Timothy has some fun. Take him out to play a bit with other kids his age, if you can." With a last round of hugs, Jet reluctantly goes. She has to do what she can, even if she's not sure what that will be.

"This is the perfect opportunity Poe," says Xin. "You have the chance to be someone else. You need to change more than simply how you look. You need to carry yourself differently, breathe differently." There's a grin that spreads slowly across the man's face, "Controlling Chi comes in part from these things, so you see, perfect opportunity. So go ahead and sit as you normally would. Now just breathe. Don't do anything else but feel how things move as you sit there breathing." He watches Poe, expectantly.

Morgan looks straight ahead and settles into his chair. One of the first things he discovers, as he attempts to do as Xin requests, is that once you've consciously thought about breathing, you find it hard to let breathing just happen. Instead, you find yourself thinking _okay, time to breathe_. Rather than muse on this too long, though, he looks at the seat in front of him and focuses on the breathing.

A good five minutes pass. Xin studies the man as he focuses on his breathing. "Good. Now, start to breathe differently. Put more force behind it. Start to feel your chest being pushed up by your tan t'ien." Xin pats his stomach. "Right here." He breathes, pushing out with his stomach. "While you do that, hold yourself up straight." Xin has a number of other minor corrections to make to the way Morgan's sitting, to keep him from sitting as he had been moments before. It's not the most comfortable way to sit, but then again he's trying to get Poe to hold himself differently. "Now. When you breathe out, imagine air going through your fingertips. Push it out. Try this for an hour or so. Get used to the idea, see if it doesn't help when we get there."

Morgan finds all this somewhat bewildering in an objective sense. He tells himself that that's the _point_, in some way - to open himself up to the subjective which he'd dismissed for so long. Breathing through one's fingers is probably the strangest of these exercises, but it is still interesting; it's a challenge to his imagination.

Amidst his spiritual training from the Eastern mystic, Poe also makes time to consult with Jet on the matter of not being Andrew Morgan. This is something he feels he may need to do on a regular basis, even beyond the present expedition, so he decides to put some thought into it.

First, Poe decides on a name for the new persona: "Edgar Johnson". The first name is easy to remember; it harkens to his college nickname, which he acquired after being called Drew Morgan for short by his lit-class buddies who had been studying the story The Murders In the Rue Morgue; the surname Johnson was chosen at random, after he decided that "Edgar Allen" would remind _other_ people too much of the name of Poe.

Next comes the matter of appearance. First, the small tweaks. During the trip, Morgan, normally clean-shaven, begins to cultivate a growth of beard, though he keeps it carefully shave from his jawline. Also, a change of wardrobe: gone are the business-casual plain shirts and khaki pants, to be replaced by flannel and blue jeans. Neither of these steps alone would be enough to distract even a casual acquaintance, but both together, along with the abbreviated training from Xin on how to direct his _chi_, form the beginning of a new self.

With Jet, there's no spiritual tips offered. "Just remember that you are someone else. Invent a story for yourself. You are a writer, so that should be easy. Pick something that fits you well enough so you can keep it up." She smirks and suggests, "Leer more at me. Use slang and swear. Don't put up with shit so calmly. You need to really be a new self for anyone else to buy it, Eddy. If you can't talk and feel the part, you won't fool more than the eyes, and those probably not too long."

"Now, grab my ass and let's get going." Jet's not even sure if that's to help him get into his role or just to amuse herself. "And remember your story. You may know things for certain reasons, but Eddy has to have his own justifications and impulses. You get those down, and he's as real as anyone else."

Morgan laughs. "Might as well put some Nirvana on the iPod while I'm at it," he says. "I mean, it kinda sounds like Eddy's shaping up to be some kinda garage punk," he says. He doesn't grab Jet's butt, though. Until ten minutes later, when she's had time to forget about that part.

---

Prior to the group's departure, a phone call that Morgan takes turns out to be his 'source'. "My visitor has a message for you," he relays. "He said: Your harmonization effort was nearly there, you just need to focus it on him now. But you have what you need to link up with him."

Morgan passes this along to his friends - especially Xin, to whom he owes the success so far. "What do you think?" he asks. "Should I try to harmonize with him now, or wait till another time?"

After some discussion, the crew decides that harmonizing with Morgan's 'visitor' could be a vitally useful tool in the conflict with the Exalted's mysterious assailants. And on the other hand, since the visitor is almost certainly a tool of the assailants themselves, harmonizing with it could tip them off.

The compromise: make the attempt, but do it on the road. Jet, Xin, and Benford will be there to deal with matters if they get out of hand, and there will be nothing immediate to tie the attempt to the San Francisco Sidereals, possibly sparing them Hel's fate. Morgan suggests the long, lonely stretch of highway north of Mount Shasta, California. From there to Medford, Oregon, there is nothing to be seen but road. Short of driving back down to West Texas again, it's the least populated stretch of road they could hope to find on this trip.

The first attempt is made just north of Mount Shasta, at a rest area north of a small highway town named Weed. It's reasonably well appointed for a roadside rest area, although there are no vending machines. They time their arrival for late in the evening, when there will be few people around other than truck drivers making their way north... and hope that none of those intrepid road-warriors will suffer the fate of the Staten Island washing-machine vendor.

With Xin nodding encouragingly beside him, Morgan settles back into his seat, then lifts himself up again. He arches his back ever so slightly, holds his arms differently, concentrates on breathing through his fingertips... and thinks of that voice he heard. That cheerful, exuberant voice that wanted to be helpful to him, with its knowledge and memories of growing up in California. _Maybe he lived near here,_ Morgan - no, "Eddy" - thinks to himself, before immersing himself once more in the meditation, concentrating his very self on the voices in his head.

Time passes. To those watching, Morgan seems to be doing nothing at all. Gradually, though, they begin to see some visible manifestation of the meditative direction the Solar's mind is taking. Lines of golden light, faint as anything, are barely visible. Nevertheless, there they are, as they dance across Morgan's skin in geometrically-regular, tantalizingly complicated structures. On his brow, his Caste Mark becomes visible, and the lines flow up his face to connect themselves to it as though they were forming a sorcerous circuit of light. But the effect fades away to nothing after moments.

And in the end, the only indication Morgan himself receives are words: "It is done."

Morgan repeats the words. "It is done." He opens his eyes. "Although..." he says, looking down at his hands, "I'm not quite sure yet what it is that I _did_."

"You made yourself glow a bit," answers Jet. "That was kinda cool, anyway." The Lunar sounds more amused than in awe. "There were golden patterns on your skin, Eddy. You don't feel any different?"

Benford thinks, the patterns of light still vivid in his mind. _Damn. I wish I'd thought to get a camera._ Then he asks, "Where is home?"

Morgan thinks for a moment. "I feel pretty much the same as I did before I started meditating. But then, meditating makes me feel different anyway." He nods to Benford, "Right now, home is Seattle. So..." With that, he lets his eyes half-close and begins to breathe deeply again.
