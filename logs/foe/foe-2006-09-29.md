# Fall of Eden 2006-09-29

The Lynwood neighborhood of Seattle is still covered in pre-dawn grey, but the lights are on in the residence of Andrew Morgan. Benford has turned the kitchen into an impromptu physics laboratory, covering the dinette in wires, mirrors, and pieces of an old VCR. The finishing touch is an old laser pointer that has been kicking around the bottom of his laptop bag for about eighteen months. The contraption's improvised appearence belies its precision. Even though Benford has used no tools more accurate than a plumb bob and a grammar school protractor, the angles between the mirrors is accurate to within a hundredth of a degree. The scientist contemplates this acheivement while finishing his second oversized mug of coffee, heavily laced with cream and sugar in an uncharacteristically indulgent style.

Coffee. Jet can smell it. When you have been up for more than a day, it takes a bit of fuel to keep going. Ana has woken up a bit, but only long enough to say good morning and then slip back asleep. Jet heads for the kitchen then, hoping to find some kind of breakfast goodies. When she realizes the kitchen is not precisely a kitchen, she's at least a bit dismayed. "Good morning Newton. Is this a new way to make pancakes?" She smiles just a bit too sweety. Yep, Jet's grouchy.

Benford allows himself a small smile, and pours a mug for Jet. He hears her irritation, but rather than allow himself to be bothered, he takes a break from the experiment to rummage around in the cupboards. "I'm measuring the speed of light. It's a long story," he says, retrieving the least expired box of corn flakes and several cans of evaported milk (the liquid milk in Poe's fridge having long since turned six shades of green.) He explains to Jet while filling two bowls. "Poe said that he was in the Lands of Light, and that it was a universe based on information, like our universe is based on energy and matter. But in some sense the three are the same, so..." He shrugs. "I think our mechanical friends have been mucking about with the fundamental constants of the universe. I think it's part of establishing the bridge between worlds."

"So you're.." Jet just kinda hears all that and clearly doesn't quite get it all. "Anyhow, you think they are changing the way our world works. Why the speed of light, and not, say, gravity? Wouldn't that be a bit easier to measure?" She eyes the jury-rigged whatever-it-is uncertainly. Once she gets herself some coffee down her, Jet lets out a sigh, much happier already.

Benford comes up short. "I can't belive I forgot that." He pulls out a notepad and jots down a formula and a note, 'Check ASAP'.

Benford taps the laser pointer gently with a finger, putting it in a precise alignment with the mirrors. "I suppose it wasn't just confirming the theory. Do you remember back in your club, all that impossible stuff you did?" He gestures at the mirror rig. "This is the same kind of thing for me. This instrument has been built thousands of times, but generally not in an hour, and not without a lot of precision tools." He picks up a butter knife. "This is the most complicated tool I needed. Frankly, I'm a little frightened by that."

"Why frightened?" asks Jet. "I have a feeling we all have to get used to being like nothing the world has ever seen before." She realizes with a sheepish grin that she has some more explaining to do, herself. "Oh, and forewarning.. I found someone in need of help late last night. She was.. hurt when I found her, and she's going to be with us until she doesn't want to be." Jet's grin fades as she speaks. "I should be afraid. I should be doubting or wondering if I can help her. I'm not." She looks Newton right in the eye, "I think you should have confidence in yourself, too. We have a real divine mandate."

Benford holds the look for a moment, then nods slowly. "Perhaps. But it sounds like there's a more immediate problem. You said she's hurt. I can help. Do you want me to do so?"

"Her physical hurt is relatively small," says Jet. Her words grow very quiet, and she goes on, "Her attackers were men who hurt her another way. I would like some antibiotics for her. I can smell a bit of infection. Still, the deepest wounds are going to be in her soul, though. We will need to have her tested, though, so she's sure she is clean. I also need to get her some medicine to make sure she's not.." Jet sighs softly, "To make sure she doesn't get pregnant."

Benford steps away, shocked. "Damn," is all he can say. After a moment he notices that he's clenching his fists hard enough to drawn blood. "Let me have a look. Please."

"She's asleep right now. Oh, and her name is Ana," says Jet quietly. "Let's finish up here and then I will wake her so you can check her. Um, did you need me to do anything?" She looks at what seems (to her) as a random bit of flotsam woven into something that is somehow beautiful.

Benford shrugs. "Just watch, if you like. We can measure the speed by counting the flicker rate; when each pulse travels the whole length, in interrupts the beam for a moment. In normal space it will be once per second. If our friends have changed that... well. I don't know what to expect. But the more profound the difference, the better the chance we'll be able to detect other 'temples' like this one." The scientist flips the switch on the laser pointer and waits to see what happens.

For her part, Jet will just watch, though she does peek out to make sure Ana is still asleep. The girl is, and so the Lunar continues to drink her coffee and observe this curious experiment.

The beam strobes once per second, as Newton predicted. Further, the Twilight can tell that it's quite precisely one second; a cheap pocket calculator at the end of the array, jury-rigged into a pulse counter, indicates the speed as fraction of true light speed: 1.0000000. The scientist flips the switch off and shrugs again. "Well. It was fun while it lasted." After a moment, he says, "Let's see to your friend."

Jet nods to Newton and leads the way. Ana is still asleep on the couch, and another couch is pulled right near it, with just a little gap between. "I'll wake her," Jet announces. The Full Moon crawls back onto the couch she was resting on and for a moment, just listens to Ana's breathing. A soft whisper is all it takes, "Ana, it's time to wake up, dear." The girl's eyes pop open, and seeing Jet, she manages a small smile. Jet looks back to Newton, quickly explaining, "This is a very good friend of mine. He really knows his stuff. He will make sure you don't have to go to a clinic, if you will let him." The girl looks from Jet to Newton with wariness, but nods slowly.

While Newton Benford is not trained as a medical doctor, he paid attention during his many years as a patient. Further, he dimly recalls something Helios said in the control room at CERN; it seems like it was years ago: _You will be capable of similar miracles yourself, if you so choose._ It gives him pause - Gods don't make throwaway comments. He opens his eyes and sees things with a new vision. Ana still has a little blood on her; not all of it is hers... she put up a fight. There's dirt under her fingernails, and also skin. _If we find them, we can identify them._ He checks Ana over, quickly and gently; a Solar has no need of the invasiveness of mundane medicine.

The skill and certainty of the Solar calms Ana, and soon she is not so afraid to have Newton examining her. Jet remains near, offering calm, silent support. She knows just being there is a huge relief for Ana at this point. Benford will also realize during his examination that Ana hasn't been very well nourished lately--runaways rarely are. Ana explains that she is fifteen, and she ran away when her father started to grow abusive.

Benford takes Jet aside and speaks to her in a low tone. "She'll be alright physically. The infection is superficial, we'll get a scrip for some antibiotics, it will be gone in a few days. The disturbing part is how long this has been going on." He's silent for a long moment. "And I have to leave that to you. Excuse me. I need a few moments alone." The scientist retreats and busies himself wordlessly with salvaging breakfast out of Poe's neglected kitchen.

Jet watches Benford go with a soft sigh. She still smiles when she turns back to Ana. The Lunar settles herself down by the girl and says, "We'll be able to just get a bit of medicine, then I believe that will be settled." She doesn't say things will be okay. That isn't something medicine can make happen. Even so, Jet exudes an aura of calmness, of love and loyalty and safety, her motions deliberate and easy. "We should probably get some breakfast. Are you hungry Ana?" The girl nods slowly and answers, "I would like something warm to eat. I'm starving!"

"What did you do to the coffee machine," asks Xin, who sounds more pained than curious. "I know that Americans love their gadgets but this seems excessive." Xin wanders in, looking like he's been up all night. Smells that way too. He looks accusingly at the machinery, and straightens up a bit, tensing, "At least... I **hope** this is something one of you did..."

It's been a long time since Morgan has been able to sleep in his own bed, and after all he's been through, it's the best sleep he has had in a while. He walks into the living room with a puzzled expression, though, since he overheard Ana's voice in the hall. He glances at Jet first, with a raised eyebrow. He's known the Lunar long enough that if someone new and vulnerable-looking comes into his world, Jet's usually the cause... and that there's usually a good reason.

Jet doesn't explain now, though. "The coffee machine should be working," she says to Xin. Turning to Poe she smiles, "Good morning, Poe. Oh!" She turns to Ana, explaining, "This is Poe." Turning back to Poe she goes on, "And she's Ana. She's going to be staying with us until she's safe. Really for as long as she wants." Those words seem to grant a wish, and Jet finds herself with a teenage girl hugging her tightly. The Lunar pats the girl's back, trying to comfort her. "Can someone make us some breakfast? Or go get us some?"

"Maybe we can get some breakfast on our way to follow up whatever it is we were gonna follow up," suggests Xin. "Unless you guys think we've got enough to deal with as it is..." He gestures back towards the kitchen.

Morgan rubs his chin. "Well, I can check to see if they left me any bacon or sausages in the fridge, but you can forget about any bread or eggs. If there is any in the house, it's long since gone bad. We could go shopping, I suppose."

Morgan opens the freezer, just to check, and shakes his head. "Nope. They took anything perishable, thank the gods. I'd hate to think what this place'd smell like if they hadn't." He closes it again. "So what does anyone want? Cereal, bacon, eggs, toast, whatever?" He pulls out the ever-present reporter's notepad; it's not the first time he's used it for his grocery list.

"I just want pancakes, sausage, bacon, and maple syrup," says Jet. Ana whispers, "Strawberries and whipped cream." Jet arches an eyebrow, "Really? Huh. That too, then." She looks from Xin to Poe and back again, "We going to have to move soon, you think? What is our next step?"

"Eggs and some toast. Oh, and milk and orange juice," adds Xin. He nods at Jet, "Yeah. I think so. At least make our move, anyway," he looks at Poe, "That's a good question though. This is your show. I mean, we're here to help, but you're the one with the nose for news, right?"

Morgan taps his chin with the pencil. "You know... all things considered, we're probably better off not cooking here. It could cause comment, and I'm still not ready to come back officially. I move we go out to IHOP or something, get breakfast there. I want to look into our friend from the Discovery Institute."

Benford perks up at the mention of the Discovery Institute. "Yes. There was that... when Gerhard showed up, I forgot all about them. Doctor Dal Kelton."

Jet looks thoughtfully at Ana, who still is in need of real clothing. "We have to stop and get her something to wear," says Jet. "Can we get something to go from IHOP? I can put a list together if someone can run to a clothing store." She looks to Ana and the two for the moment withdraw into their own conversation. Jet wants to get Ana the clothes she wants, so the girl will feel comfortable. "Once we get everything stabalized, we can get in motion again."

"Fine," Xin seems a bit uncomfortable. Or perhaps he's just restless. "So clothes, pancakes, then we pay the good doctor a visit. Do we have a plan for getting in to see him, do we need an appointment or anything, or are we just gonna walk in and have... shall we say, an impromptu discussion?"

"I don't think I want to talk to him at all, at least not yet," opines Morgan. "I've got too many questions I need the answers to without him knowing anyone asked them." He crosses to the counter, riffling through the phone book. "Instead of talking to him, we can try to find where he lives, and give _his_ house a good going-over. Or maybe just stake him out."

"The one can lead to the other," says Xin. He eyes the phonebook, and asks, "When do we wanna give his house this going-over? It stands to reason it's gonna be watched. So the question is, what do we want to let the other guys know?"

Jet diverts most of her attention to Ana, though they don't really seem to be talking about much that is really important. The talk does at least distract the girl from worries about whatever the others are planning, and makes it clear that Jet sees Ana as her top concern. If the others need Jet's opinion on anything, though, she is definitely keeping her ears perked. If it comes to breaking-in, she's hardly a novice.

"We did a thorough background on him," Benford mentions. "We know where he lives. We also know that he might be hiring his domestics right out of prison. This is a treacherous venture."

Morgan rubs his chin. "Honestly? I think our friend from last night, or one of his associates, was behind the attack, whatever he might have said or not said. But I think they only provided half the motive. I want to know Dr. Kelton's half. I want to know he won't try this again once he finds out I'm still alive." He chuckles. "And if he's innocent, I want to know that too."

"I don't think there _are_ any 'other guys' except the machines," adds Morgan. "And they already know we're looking out for them. If they've got another 'man' watching Dr. Kelton's residence, we could do worse than just flush him out."

"We could," Xin agrees. "Although there might be other guys in league with the machines. But I think we'll learn enough by going through the good doctor's house and watching what happens after that. We'll want to speak to him soon though. Before anyone has the chance to let him know what has been up."

Benford says, "Well, we can't all go waltzing in there. We should choose who, and when. And also where. We know he's on the boards of several organizations. I think it's reasonable to assume he's got several offices, and records in all of them. Rather than invovle ourselves with his residence, I think we ought to look at those. Fewer problems with that."

Benford retrieves a manila folder from his briefcase, and flips it open. "Sylvan Limited. It's a real estate holding company, he sits on the board. It's a safe bet that he's got an office there, but I'd bet pounds to potatoes that he's only there a day or two a week, if ever. Shouldn't be too hard to get in. I suggest that one of us goes in the late afternoon, and the rest of us wait nearby as backup. Just... in and out." He leaves the folder open and steps away from the table, glancing at Ana. "I'd like you to know that this sort of thing isn't a habit with me."

Morgan shakes his head. "I don't think a real estate holding company will have what I'm looking for." He begins to pace the room. "Question number one on my list is: _is_ Dr. Kelton our man? The man we're looking for is whoever made contact with the guys who actually _did_ the break-in, and the reason we looked at Dr. Kelton in the first place is because his prison research gives him access to the appropriate, uh, talent."

"So," concludes Poe, spinning on one heel to complete another circuit, "what we actually want to _know_ about is whether his research included the four men in question. And to find _that_ out, it's that research organization where we'll find what we're looking for - if it's there."

Benford taps the thick folder. "Well. We can choose whatever angle we want, we've got all the groundwork. I guess I'd just say, don't do his house first."

Benford thinks for a moment, then suddenly says, "Let's go to jail."

That is enough to get Jet's attention back from her conversation. She sighs softly and has to ask, "You getting a guilty conscience over attacking Poe's kitchen or what, Newton?" Jet can't help it, it just comes out so easily!

"To try and talk to the people to find out who he's been hiring as domestics?" Xin asks, because he thinks he understands what Benford is getting at. He has a look of comprehension on his face. "Or is it something else?"

Benford blinks at Jet, then barks out a sharp laugh. "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't say that right. My guilty conscience hasn't driven me to madness just yet. I just meant, if we're looking for people close Keltan's hired help, the most likely place to look is the correctional facility where they served time. Some of the other inmates may remember him. Maybe we can find someone that turned him down.'"

Jet nods to Benford, "I see. Well, I don't know if I really want to go into a prison." She gives Newton a rather meaningful look. She's not quite sure that all the warrants that chase her in Texas haven't reached here, and she's not sure if the Sidereals have wiped them all off the books or not. "I see the logic, though. You may have to be creative to get their cooperation."

"So it sounds like we have two plans. Go check the offices and go check the prisons. And since we have four people we can send two people to each location. It's just a matter of deciding who will be going where," says Xin. "Either way, we ought to get going before someone realizes we're here and decides to do more than have a pleasant visit with us."

Morgan nods. "All right. Breakfast and clothes shopping first," he says, nodding in Ana's direction. "Then downtown to check the offices first. The trail may lead to Walla Walla sooner or later, but we'll do better _there_ if we can find some names to talk to _here_."

Jet is making a list of her own. She's focusing on the mundane. She knows that there are few offices she can't get into. Any place without armed guards on site doesn't really intimidate her anymore. The Full Moon warrior is right now writing down a list of clothes for Ana, as well as the girl's various measurements. This is possibly the first 'girly' thing that Jet has done since exalting, but she likes it, because Ana is smiling for the first time, really smiling.

Antioch University, in downtown Seattle, is a small private university, nestled under the shadow of the Space Needle. Dr. Kelton's role as an adjunct professor in their department of clinical psychology is the suspected link with the thugs from the Walla Walla pen, and therefore the Circle's target.

The party's approach is simple; Morgan, posing as the student Eddy Johnson, will ask the receptionist where to find Dr. Kelton's office, and ideally try to get the office hours as well. Then they will try to get into the office when it's empty and go through the files, looking for anything - paper, electronic, or otherwise - that references the four men whose lives of crime ended in a certain Lynnwood household.

Dr. Kelton's office is cluttered with paper; textbooks, references, printouts of university memos, and all the other detritus of academic life cover most available surfaces. In one corner of the office is an old-fashioned file cabinet full of bulging manila folders; any organization to them is idiosyncratic, at best. Dr. Kelton himself, were he here and inclined to cooperate, would have required some time to find the information Morgan is looking for.

Eventually, he does find a collection of file folders which includes a sheet entitled "Subject list: Walla Walla Medium Security", whereon Morgan finds the name of a handful of prisoners, including the four he is looking for. However, the four names are not marked in any special way, and there is little sign of what the list is for.

Aware of the usefulness of technology in cutting through clutter, Morgan turns to the computer perched on the desk, hoping to find it left un-password-protected. Instead, he finds it turned off entirely. Pushing the power switch has no effect, either; a quick crawl under the desk finds it not only entirely unplugged, but with the power cord missing.

Perplexed, Morgan scours the room for anything else - laptop, mislaid cell phone or PDA - and find something that he personally finds most intriguing: with the exception of the carefully disconnected computer, there is not a single piece of modern technology in the office. Even the telephone is an ancient-looking rotary model, rather than the PBX phone he's used to seeing in offices.

Either Dr. Kelton is more of a Luddite than Morgan would've guessed, or... _Eddie,_ he asks, slipping into light meditation. _Is the connection to the Lands of Light unusually strong here?_

_I'm afraid not!_ replies Eddie. _It's actually quite the opposite._

_Thank you,_ Morgan responds. "Interesting..." he mumbles to himself. "Was he afraid of a return visit?" He checks his watch, and curses softly - it's getting close to the hour, when people will be milling about between classes, and might look into an unoccupied office. Hastily, he copies down the names of the other prisoners on the list and takes his leave.

"Not an electronic sausage," Morgan is saying, back in the van. "It's weird. I've never seen a place so devoid of electronics. I glanced in another office on the way out, and it had the usual stuff. He must've had an analog line put in just for the rotary, or maybe he had one anyway."

Benford says, "You said there was a computer on the desk, though? It sounds like it was just there for show. What does this chap know that we don't?"

Morgan shrugs. "Or maybe he used to leave it plugged in, and decided not to anymore? I didn't want to plug it in to find out," he adds, with a lopsided grin. "And Eddie says that the Lands of Light were unusually remote there, too."

Benford says, "I wonder if his other offices are similarly devoid of technology. Where to next, then?"

"Walla Walla," says Morgan. "We've got some more guys to talk to, if we can get 'em to spill their guts. Maybe Dr. Kelton tried some of them for his dirty work and they said no. And if he did..." He grins. "Well, we'll just have to make sure he doesn't try it again."
