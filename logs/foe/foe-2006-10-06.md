Like most prisons, the Washington State Penitentiary is as isolated as local geography allows. In this case, it's on a converted farm in the rural city of Walla Walla, near the Oregon state line in eastern Washington, five long hours from Seattle through territory barely removed from wilderness. Hopefully, some of the inmates will be able to shed some light on the mysterious Dal Kelton; real estate mogul, psychologist, and (quite possibly) the man who wants Andrew Morgan dead.

Newton Benford stares out the window as forests give way to the drier, barren lands of eastern Washington state. It's been silent. Finally he asks, "Why was there no technology in Kelton's office?"

"I've been wondering that myself," says Morgan. "Eddie said that the Lands of Light were remote from there, too. I didn't have time to look into it much, but either that was because of the lack of technology, or possibly the other way around."

Jet's mind is not on the office, nor really on the moment. She's thinking of Ana, and hoping the books she bought the girl are enough distraction for a few hours, in conjuction with a jacuzzi suite and cable tv. She is roused out of these thoughts (partially) by the conversation. "A lack of working technology," says Jet. "An unplugged computer is a pretty weird decoration for an office."

Benford says, "But if he was simply a luddite, he wouldn't even have one. Do you suppose he had an encounter with one of our assembled opponents? Or at least that he knows of their nature, and he's trying to avoid them?"

Morgan nods. "It must have **something** to do with them, at least. He's had contact with them, and he wants to control how much further contact he has. That's what I'm thinking, at least." He shifts in his seat. "There's another question, though: how did the Lands get so remote? I don't _think_ just shuffling machines around should be able to do that all by itself. Gerhard's friends had to go to some effort to strengthen it where I lived."

"You know what it kind of reminds me of," says Xin, piping in to show that he's been paying attention. "It kind of reminds me of how people used to throw salt around to ward off spirits. Or over their shoulders for luck. My sister told me a story about how people in America used to wear pennies in their shoes to keep away the fairies. Maybe it's something he believes does that kinda thing?"

"So you are suggesting this is some sort of anti-machine feng shui?" asks Jet. That gives her something to think of. "Why not test it? There have to be a lot of open spaces where no one has lived, and where technology would never have been used."

Benford gestures out the window. "Like here, you mean?"

Xin nods, "Yeah. Feng Shui." He looks out of the window, "But how would we test it?"

Morgan rubs his chin. "Well, we can start with how I tested it in Dr. Kelton's office." _Eddie? How near are the Lands of Light where we are?_

_There isn't a whole lotta shakin' going on,_ Eddie replies, chipper as always. _Is there something I can help you find out here?_

_Possibly,_ thinks Morgan. _Is it more or less than it was when I asked you last time, in Dr. Kelton's office?_

_It's stronger here,_ comes the answer.

"Interesting," says Morgan. "According to Eddie, it's actually stronger out here in the middle of nowhere than it was in the middle of an office building in downtown Seattle. No one went and bought a cell phone while I wasn't looking, did they?" asks Morgan jokingly. "Seriously, that means Dr. Kelton, or someone else, had to have _done_ something."

"That would seem to be the case," says Jet. "But we are on a highway, and information is carried through her quite often. I wonder if the old trails out in the wilderness would still have a connection. Or perhaps most places due because of satellites and GPS and all that sorta thing."

Xin nods, "It makes sense though. Even if no one has lived out here and there's no technology, no one's deliberately warded it away. No one's really messed with the feng shui."

Benford says, "If Kelton has a means of discouraging the machines, then it's vital that we find him, because we've been seeking to do the same." He grimaces. "And shame on me for not discovering the method myself."

Morgan nods. "Which leads to another question: how did _he_ discover it? Surely a mortal wouldn't be able to discover how to do such a thing..." He trails off. "When the time comes to confront Dr. Kelton himself... we'd best be on our guard."

Washington State Penitentiary is formally known as such; located in Walla Walla, Washington, "Wally World" is the informal nickname given to it by many of its residents (voluntary or otherwise). Superintendent Jeffrey Uttecht runs a tight ship, and given the state's financial situation, has been known to pinch pennies. He has even been known to farm out inmates for firefighting and other duties, though this is on a strictly volunteer basis and such programs are carefully supervised.

The street address is the numerologically reassuring 1313 N. 13th, and the facilities look modern enough. Morgan has no difficulty finding the place.

Jet is dropped off some ways away from the prison, to find a suitable form in which to infiltrate in secret; Benford and Xin drop Morgan off openly at the entrance of the prison, then proceed to a rendezvous point within range of Morgan's handheld radio, which is enough to contact them if all goes well (Jet, of course, is responsible for calling them in if all does _not_ go well).

Find a form, indeed. "God I hate the goddam taste of bird feathers," curses Jet softly. Nonetheless, soon she's ascending a tree and waiting like a serpent. For a hunter of her talents, the waiting is not nearly so long. Soon, a sharp-eyed raven flies above the trees, studying the compound below.

Meanwhile, Andrew Morgan himself arrives at the reception desk, carrying his press pass. It feels odd to be trading under his real name again, even if he still has to conceal a bit about it. "Andrew Morgan, Seattle Times," he tells the front desk. "I'm here about my story on the psychological analysis programs. Can I talk to one of your liaison officers?"

The closer to the truth a lie can become, the easier it is to go down. Morgan's conversation with the liaison officer needs but the slightest concealment of his true intentions. He asks some basic questions about how the analysis program works - how much information professors get about their clients on the 'inside', how much access they have. What he particularly wants to know is if it's possible for the professors to speak to prisoners unsupervised, how common it is, and whether any professors were particularly inclined to avail themselves of such access. He does _not_ emphasize Antioch University or Dr. Kelton in this latter line of questioning, lest he prejudice his inquiry; his journalistic training has cautioned him against leading a witness if he wants clean information.

Such questions, of course, could be part of a story to investigate improprieties in the program, which _is_ what Morgan is inquiring about. It is this aspect of his line of questioning that Morgan is particularly careful to downplay. Authorities tend to clam up if they think they're going to be caught asleep at the switch.

Nevertheless, this aspect is enough for the staff to smile politely and refer Morgan to a Dr. Zubevich. This worthy, a short and rotund man with a big smile, can be found in his office.

He takes Morgan's hand in a hearty, fairly intense handshake as the reporter comes in. "Mr. ah, Morgan! I had no idea to expect you, I'm terribly sorry, nobody tells me what I need to know any more. Sit down, sit down! You've had coffee?"

Morgan grins. "Quite all right, Dr. Zubevich," he says. He didn't expect Dr. Zubevich to have been informed of his impromptu visit, but is the man routinely kept out of the loop? Worth looking into, if possible. "So, tell me, Dr. Zubevich. Tell me more about what the good doctors study here. What're they usually looking for in an inmate?"

"Oh, many things, many things!" The man's Russian accent is faint, but present; Morgan would judge him to be first generation. "You see, corrections is more than rehabilitation, more than social justice. It is also the opportunity to see into the mind of man, to know what distinguishes him from ape, to understand how our society functions and how to keep it functioning. We are all trying hard, yes? Trying hard to be men!"

"What we want to find is purpose, or motive. We look for the aberrations, the twists and turns, the habits. Many of our most ingrained traits are built to support a tribal social structure. Did you know that, Mr. Morgan?" Zubevich grins fiercely. "So we are all the hunter-gatherers at heart. But we make larger tribes, fight against ourselves to keep them together, then tell each other openly how good we are and how terrible the lawbreakers are. But law changes, yes? Law is written by the people in power to keep the tribes together. We here look for the ones who don't agree with that law, or who, yes, are oppressed and degraded by that law, or who can't understand it. We look for the men who cannot function in this, eh, 'super-tribe', the ones who still operate on the tribal mentality, or lower."

"It may sound odd to you, eh, a psychologist saying such things. But murder, and the other lesser crimes we commit, show that we still have barbarism at heart. It would be a poor scientist who accepted the civilized veneer we wear without acknowledging our psychological history, yes? I work with other such men, the ones who support this ordered society we wish to live in, who want to find ways to encourage it along to its ultimate conclusion. In our utopia, we would all live in harmony, eh?"

"No doubt," chuckles Morgan. "So you and your colleagues _believe_ that this society can be brought to order, then?" He lets a touch of skepticism creep into his tone, just enough to encourage Dr. Zubevich to convince him.

"If we did not, how would we have any hope of maintaining a society, eh? Why would you dress up in your suit and tie and carry your briefcase to the office, day after day? Eh?"

Morgan laughs. "Surely! But as you've already pointed out, there are some," he says, gesturing around him, "that have other ideas. How is it working out for you, do you think, convincing _them_ that the suit and tie thing can work for them?"

"Ha ha ha!" The doctor laughs. "No, no.. We do not think everyone must live at the core of this civilization. Not all will want to, yes? Instead, we must find places in society for them. At the fringes, but still within society. We must mold society so that it does not drive me to commit crimes. And we must detect those men who will do so anyway, and safeguard society from them. There are duties that men of rough temperament will enjoy: construction worker, miner, boxer. There are duties that men of weak moral character can do, without being driven by temptation into crime, yes?"

Morgan nods. "Jobs that can serve the greater good," he observes. "But who decides what the 'greater good' is? It sounds to _me_ like you and your colleagues might have a lot of influence on what that might be."

"Somebody must, eh?" Zubevich says. "And who shall decide that? Those who can perceive a greater good, and perceive that they can do so. But how do we know who that is? In a democracy, we elect men and measure their results against our own expectations. In a dictatorship, it is whatever the dictator says. Then we reduce our methods of government to that of the tribe again: force and persuasion."

Morgan rubs his chin. "Well, all this theory is well and good. But do you have any actual success stories? I always find it's useful to get more than one perspective on any significant endeavour."

"You are looking for some psychological miracle, aren't you, Mr. Morgan," Zubevich says slyly. "You are looking for some man who has turned from a hardened killer to a successful businessman, or somesuch, yes? That is not how we operate. But there is someone you can meet. He is still in the facility, but I think you will be interested in his story."

Morgan finds himself being led through the light security screen; Dr. Zubevich's credentials are sufficient. They arrive at a chapel - non-denominational - and the psychologist introduces Morgan to a Mr. Sykes. Sykes is a tall, gaunt man whose face shows the premature wrinkles of age and stress. He's dressed like a prisoner, but his nametag indicates that he's a Spiritual Assistance Volunteer.

"So, Mr. Sykes," says Morgan smoothly. "Dr. Zubevich has been telling me all about the work he and his colleagues have been doing here." He glances at the nametag. "What is a Spiritual Assistance Volunteer?"

"There are about three hundred of us. There's two professional clergy here, plus us. Some of us are in the program." By 'the program', he seems to mean 'incarceration'. "We provide religious assistance to the population. Someone has questions about a faith, or wants a Bible, or whatever."

"You'll see what we mean in a moment," says Zubevich, eyeing his watch. The minute hand sweeps over the hour mark. And like clockwork, Morgan can hear a sound being played over the prison PA system. It's simply white noise, like Morgan recognizes from hours in a courtroom, that blends over into a sort of static. It lasts for precisely 30 seconds, then fades away. Zubevich and Sykes smile.

In his heart, Morgan feels Eddie 'churning'. It's more of an emotional sensation than a true conversation, but he realizes that the entity is reacting to the sound. Only Morgan's own guiding force is keeping Eddie from slipping into whatever state the sound wishes to compel.

Morgan tries to cover for his reaction while helping to stabilize his inner companion. "Curious. And what is this supposed to accomplish?" he says as blandly as possible.

Sykes smiles equally blandly. "Call it a religious experience."

Morgan's brow furrows. "I... see. What religion, exactly? They didn't cover this in _my_ catechism class. I don't know if I can properly... convey this to my readers."

"The one true religion," Sykes replies. His voice is preternaturally calm.

Morgan writes a few more notes, and then closes up his notebook. "Well, gentlemen, I must admit it _has_ been an enlightening experience. Is there anything else you'd like to say for my readers?"

Sykes just smiles. Zubevich does so as well.

Morgan glares at the two for a long moment, then slips the notepad into his pocket. "Oooookay, then," he says. "In that case, I believe I'm done here," he says, in clipped tones. "Dr. Zubevich, please," he says, gesturing to the door while sending his thoughts inward. _Eddie, are you okay? What's going on?_ In answer, there is nothing... just a chilling silence.

"Mr. Morgan, you don't realize what we have here," Zubevich says. "We are going to build the model society, the perfect utopia. And we are doing it here. You will understand, once you're part of it."
