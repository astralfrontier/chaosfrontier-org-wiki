# Fall of Eden 2006-10-08

The city is never quiet. Outside the streetlights and neon signs cast a garish glow through the windows. Blinds have been drawn, which makes for an eerie glow. It's been nighttime for three hours now, and as he'd done twice before, on the hour, Xin peeks out the blinds. The last two times he did this, he merely sighed and went back to anxious pacing. This time something is different. He ducks back and waits by the door. There's a knock. Then another. The door opens and in steps Xin's friend, his old mentor. "I got the groceries you wanted. I did my best to not be followed," he says, chuckling, almost as though not concerned about the Solar's worries. "I think you'll need to go though. And soon. You can't stay here in my apartment forever Xin."

"I don't know. I haven't really thought about it," says Xin. "That's your trouble. You don't think. Least of all about stuff that matters. Dumb luck will only get you so far," replies the other man, "You need a plan. Decide what to do." Xin stares back out the window, watching the world go by. People walk past, cars rush back and forth, something seems to catch his eye. "Maybe I'll go look for my sister."

"That again? Let the past lie. Going to dig up all the skeletons in your closet." Xin interrupts, almost reflexively, "You're mixing phrases again..." "I know, it's my perogative. The elderly have this privilege. The point is, are you sure you can find her? And even if you do, are you sure you'll like what you find?"

Xin narrows his eyes and speaks in very level tones, "You can't always run from the past." There's a very sardonic laugh from his mentor, "I have. Besides, isn't that what you're about to do?" There is a pregnant pause, and Xin changes the subject back to his sister. "Well if anything happened to her, I'd know." "It looks like there's no discouraging you. Fine then. It'll probably give you something to do. If you're going to do it, at least put some thought into it."

The talk about what happened to Xin's sister is a difficult one. For one thing, neither man seems to be willing to approach the subject directly. It is spoken of in almost cryptic phrases. The fact that Xin's sister disappeared when he was younger becomes apparent. He'd been receiving letters from her every now and then, always to people his sister knew. The last letter he received was from America. That's when the letter stopped. That's where he wants to go.

They come up with a plan. It mostly involves Xin hiding out for a while longer while arrangements are made. Xin was ready to go to America, without bothering to take the time to figure out where he'd stay, where he'd need to be. When he calms down a bit, and is a little more thoughtful-with some serious prodding towards that end-he decides to contact some family out in the States. They might know something. If nothing else he can stay with them, and it'd be a place for him to start.

The next day has Xin sitting around impatiently in an apartment that seems too small for even one person, tucked away in southern Kowloon. Meanwhile, James Hwang, Xin's mentor, oldest friend, and-for the past few days at least-guardian, is making the travel arrangements. The conversation is very long-winded; he's trying to haggle over the price of a ticket, which doesn't seem to be working out well. Xin's impatience is almost palpable. "That's not the Xin I remember. Sitting around impatiently. What happened to all of that being at peace stuff eh? Forgotten everything you know already, I see."

"Well I just feel like I should be doing something," answers Xin. "Mr. Big Moviestar here forgot all about how to just sit there and do nothing, huh. Try it. Relax, push everything out of your head, empty yourself out so you can be whole again. Don't roll your eyes either, if you'd remembered about it, you'd have done it. No, I can't take another flight in two months, look, I know it's short notice but-" and the conversation goes back to the airline. Xin finds himself going through old meditative exercises, things he hasn't done in ages. Life on set has kept him busy. Too busy to take time to stop and think about things besides what the stunts at hand will entail. As he sits there, he can feel the weight of the world falling from his shoulders. He is slowly becoming unburdened, empty.

This time it's different. All that he has experienced seems to fall away, and his Exaltation comes to the forefront of his mind. The words of the Unconquered Sun echo, reminding him of all that he has inherited. His mind is relaxed enough now that he can feel the flow of Essence inside his body, it is more real than even his blood. No, it is his blood. It is everything within him. _Chi_. Inhibitions and prejudices yield to dawning realization. For Xin, time and space have no meaning... temporarily. For James, they have plenty of meaning. And at the end of two hours, he's finally secured tickets on a flight out of Hong Kong International Airport, then to Seoul, then to Chicago He's even booked a hotel and provided Xin with a list of buslines that serve the United States.

Xin slowly comes back to consciousness. Being prodded with a foot speeds the process along. "I...I think there's something to all this," says Xin, a little shakily. "Good. That means I haven't wasted all those years. You leave in a couple of days, just relax. Everything'll be fine. You're on your own once you get to America. I called your father's cousins, they're expecting you in a few weeks. Show up a little early so you can see how they really live."

Over the next two days James gives Xin a refresher course in some of the more internal arts. They practice qigong and meditation, and Xin starts to remember 'all that kind of thing.' It comes back even faster than he would have imagined, even James is impressed. "Hm, you _are_ learning. There's hope for the world yet. Come on, it's time to go." They set off together for the airport. Long lines and even longer delays greet them. A few suspicious looking characters seem to be lurking about, but they don't seem to be interested in Xin. After a few hours, he's in the air, bound for Seoul. From there, he'll head for Chicago, and from there, to his father's family. Once the plane has leveled off, Xin takes a folder out of his backpack.

Hidden inside the bright blue plastic folder that proclaims itself to be water-proof, neatly tucked away in pockets of transparent plastic-meant to keep various papers organized by subject, but Xin never put in the little tabs-are envelopes. They share a few things in common. The edges are all curled slightly by time, they and their contents are worn from use, and no single envelope bears the same return address. Faded stamps wear even more faded ink that tells of their journey with only the date and time. Xin takes out the first of the letters and starts to read the curly, unmistakeably delicate handwriting his sister uses.

"Please see to it that this letter gets where it needs to go," it begins. It is not addressed to Xin, nor does it once mention him by name. "I hope you understand that I had to leave. I know that you all probably miss me. Our games, our time together. You were some of the best friends I had. I just felt the call of the wild. I had to leave or I think I'd have just ended up hurting you in the end, a bird that could be caged no longer." The letters are a little shaky. Xin runs his fingers over spots where the ink has been smeared from moisture-tears-and continues reading. He remembers reading it the first time and disbelieving that his sister could have written this. It wasn't until later, when he spoke with his friend, did he realize his sister was trying to avoid talking about something. She was, perhaps, afraid someone was on the lookout for postage from her. She had to be careful about what she said.

"But how do you know this," he remembers asking. His friend, well, really it was his sister's friend. Her _sifu_ she had said. When Xin hadn't got the answer he wanted, he remembers being angry at no one. But that was ages ago. _Maybe she did say something though, where she was going next. Or why she left._

Staring down at the paper, Xin makes out another detail. It is a nine-tailed fox, a _kitsune_ from Japanese myth, and it seems to be drawn in a sitting position. The calligraphy of the thing is wonderful, for despite the minimalist lines, he can clearly make out its eyes. They seem to stare up at him.

The figure is drawn in the margins of the letter, well away from the rest of the writing, and is perhaps an inch in size. But it's something he hasn't seen before.

_Now that... wasn't there before... was it?_ Xin looks puzzled, and finds himself staring down at the kitsune. He's vaguely familiar with the legend of the kitsune. Still... it is exquisite. He's sure he'd been over every letter in detail... but, this is something new. "Why didn't I see it before?" This last is said quietly, though he can't keep it entirely to himself.

The kitsune on the paper _moves_, tilting its head to regard Xin. Chinese characters gently fade into view on the page, positioned above and to the side of the creature. And they say, "Because I have not appeared before."

There is a look of disbelief on Xin's face. Such things shouldn't be possible. The folly of that line of reasoning quickly plows over any doubts. He speaks softly, looking around to make sure he's not drawing undue attention, "Who are you?"

"I am your spirit guide, your avatar, your inner self, your higher soul." The Chinese characters waver on the page; the kitsune contents itself by grooming one paw with its tongue.

_My inner soul is a drawing._ Xin watches the kitsune carefully, he believes the characters that waver on the page. "Why have you chosen to appear now?"

The kitsune blinks sleepily and scratches behind its ear with a hindpaw. "You have need of me now," the characters say, wavering into their latest form.

Xin still hasn't quite grasped everything, though it is coming along. "I see. What... you can help me find my sister? Or is it something else you are referring to?"

The Chinese characters waver. "I will help with whatever you need. But my foremost duty is to teach you the nature of Exaltation. If you understand that, all else will come to you naturally."

"You know, I think you're right." Xin looks down at the page, reading the characters, watching the kitsune as it amuses itself on the page. "What will you teach me then?"

"I will teach you about Essence," the figure 'says'. "All the world is made of Essence. It comes from the will, and you may shape it as you please."

"How do I shape it," asks Xin, speaking much softer now. He's not even sure that he needs to speak. He tries simply asking the question of himself. _And how can I learn to control the shaping of it?_

"We will study that in greater detail when you have time. But we will do so through the martial arts. You will achieve _kung fu_ - a great accomplishment, not merely the fighting arts."

_I will achieve a great accomplishment_ Xin considers the paper. "Where do I begin? What is the one step that begins my journey of a thousand miles?"

The Chinese glyph for "Family" appears, hovering over the fox's head.

"How do I find her? Do I just will it?"

"It is not so easy as snapping one's fingers," the fox 'says'. "But through Essence you will command the world to reveal your sister to you. The world will resist with its own Essence. You must overcome that."

"I must overcome the world. Is such a thing truly possible?"

"Only if you believe it is." The fox wriggles its snout and turns about twice, curling up into a bushy ball of ink on the page.

"I think that with your help, I can truly believe that." Xin sits back in the plane, directing his thoughts at the letters. He sets the one with the fox on it to one side, and reads through the others. _Command the world to reveal her to me._

Two days and two plane changes later, Xin arrives in Chicago. A message is waiting for him at the airport: "You might have unwelcome company in America. Probably best to keep out of sight for a while. Take care. Buy yourself a ticket to New York, then use these." Inside an envelope is a printout of a confirmation number. It'll get him a bus ticket to Georgia, where his father's family awaits.

The ticket is purchased by a Mr. James Hwang, for Mr. Lou. They're not even all that interested in his ID, his confirmation number matches up, and there's just a glance to make sure that his face matches the face on the card. "Enjoy your trip."

The next sixteen hours seem to take longer than it did to fly to America. The large snoring man asleep nearby makes any kind of relaxation difficult. Xin starts to think about what the next step will be. He can almost hear someone saying it to him, _Deal with the small things, before they become big. In this way the Sage never deals in anything great and can accomplish anything._ Xin had believed that he understood that phrase before... but now he seems to get it even more. When he gets out of the bus station, it's another two hours before he's at his relative's house. They're glad to see him, and apparently were ready for him from the moment Mr. Hwang called. The house is almost immaculately clean, they've even got the guest room all made up.

It takes a day or two to get over the jet lag, during which Xin spends a lot of time sleeping more comfortably than he can remember. The bus and the plane were awfully cramped, after that the bed seems like heaven. He explains why he's come, to try and find his sister, and to see the great United States of America. Back in the 1850's, his great-grandparents came to this country. They visited with the Emperor of America, and made their fortune before returning home. Xin still has an old piece of currency, issued by the Emperor himself. An heirloom passed down from one generation to the next.

He's shown around the city, sees the notable sights, plays the dutiful tourist. And all the while he asks his relatives about his sister's visit to America. At first they don't seem to recall her, and then Xin pleads with them, describes her, shows them a picture. Oh yes, they recall, she had come through here, a few years past. She seemed so troubled, like she was afraid of something. They fed her and clothed her and helped her out as best as they could. She stayed with them a while, and then she left. She didn't say where she'd gone, or why she left, only a note thanking them for their kindness. Xin asks them to show where she'd been while she was in town, and the letter, hoping to find something... anything that will serve as a lead.

Later that night, while Xin sleeps soundly, dreaming of the endless wisdom to be found in the martial arts, a phone call is placed. Someone speaks in hushed tones to someone who speaks in equally hushed tones. "Yes. He's here. He's looking for her. What should I do?" A pause. "Okay. I'll keep in touch." The phone is replaced on the cradle, and the night continues, uninterrupted.
