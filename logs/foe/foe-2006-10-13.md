# Fall of Eden 2006-10-13

Morgan glares from Dr. Zubevich to Mr. Sykes and back for a moment. Then he puts his hand on his hip. "All right. What do you want with _me_?" he says tensely. "Where do I fit in?"

"Where do you fit in? Ahh.." Zubevich clasps his hands together. "That is the question that drives us, is it not? _The_ question, you might say. What we hope to accomplish here is to answer that, for everyone. Would you like to experience the answer?"

Morgan sets his mouth in a thin line. "Nnnno, not really. I think I'd just as soon try to find out the answer for myself. Except for those who _disrupt_ the order," he says, gesturing to the prison cells beyond the chapel, "I think everyone ought to have that right."

"You cannot understand without the experience," Sykes murmurs. "You cannot come to know God unless you open your eyes to him."

The reporter hears the sound of booted feet approaching from the hallway.

"Thanks, but no thanks," says Poe. He spins toward the door, and his hand slips into his pocket, so as to push the Talk button on the walkietalkie three times in rapid succession. Next time, he resolves, they need to agree on the signals in advance; for now, this signal will at least convey 'I pushed the button on purpose but don't have time to talk now'. You don't need Benford's IQ to realize that this means trouble.

"It's the signal," exclaims Xin, lurching up with the succession of beeps, while disturbing a pile of wrappers that vaguely resemble something that could resemble art. "It, _is_ the signal right?" There's more than a hint of anticipation in his voice. He's already got the door open, and seatbelt unbuckled. "Or were you planning on taking the van down there?"

Benford thinks for a moment. _He has no time to talk. That means he's in real trouble._ "Yes. The place is a fortress. We need a way to get in and out, in a hurry. It will take us two minutes to get there. A lot can happen in two minutes." He gestures at Xin as he pulls out a topographic map of the area. "Drive. Fast. Go by here first, through," he says, pointing at a marker on the map. "You'll need to drop me off."

Morgan makes for the door, knowing that if he gets cornered in the chapel, he'll be at their mercy. Zubevich and Sykes do not make any move to stop him - but when Poe opens the door, this turns out to be a small blessing at best. Half a dozen prison guards come around the corridor, each armed with riot batons. They make their way toward Poe with a determined glint in their eye.

Poe takes one look at them and darts in the opposite direction. Behind him, the sound of their booted feet quickens, lending an urgency to Poe's flight. He looks along the hall on both sides as he runs, looking for any door that doesn't look like a cell door. Somewhere around here is something he can use...

Jet sees the van moving and swings into action. The raven's shriek is piercing, and its eyes glint darkly, devoid of mercy. If they hurt Poe, the Lunar is going to kill until the blood reaches her knees. She uses her sharp eyes and mind, knowing the layout of the prison and guessing as much as she can where Poe might run. A barred window will have to do. She's about to see if mere mortal construction can compete with the strength of a demigod.

The door shuts, the van starts, and in no time, the wheels leave clods of dirt in their wake. The dust is still coalescing into a cloud on the breeze as the van speeds off in the distance. There is something almost reckless about the way Xin drives. There is something entirely reckless about the way he's going to stop, once he gets Benford where he needs to go.

Benford directs Xin towards a turnout by the side of the road as he gathers his computer and tools into a knapsack. "Follow Jet to find Morgan. If you can't see her, follow the violence. They'll be calling for help, so I'm going to fix their phones. That won't hold them forever, so we'll have to move fast. Don't forget to pick me up on the way out." He slips batteries into another radio for himself. "I'll stick to Poe's code. Two clicks means it's going well. Three clicks means we're screwed."

Poe yanks open a door and looks out onto a dining hall, which is deserted at this time of day - in this part of the prison, most of the inmates are on outside work details and won't return until the afternoon for dinner. This is fine by him. He leaps over the nearest table, turns round, braces himself, and focuses his _chi_ as Xin taught him... then puts both hands under the edge of the table and heaves with all his might, sending the table sliding sideways toward the door as hard as he can.

With the building mostly empty inside, Jet is still struggling to figure out the best entry point. She doesn't feel comfortable slaughtering men that might be innocent. The prisoners don't worry her. The guards are a different story. Before she sets off any major alarms, she changes her plans, and races into an open window, soaring down a hall and using ears and eyes to figure out what is going on.

The mess hall door begins to open just as the table arrives with enough force to send a mule flying. There is a loud crash as the door slams shut again, and a commotion outside the door suggests that the unlucky guard who tried to open the door was knocked off his feet. Morgan takes advantage of the delay to grab a chair and wedge it against the door handle, then dashes across the empty mess hall and leaps over the kitchen counter, quickly scanning the area for another door.

Xin goes through the turnout, slowing down just long enough for Benford to hop out before roaring off down the access road. In one hand Benford has a crowbar; in the other, a bag with his other tools. He runs over to a manhole capping a concrete vault, partially buried in the ground, bearing the old Pacific Bell logo. Benford jams one end of the crowbar under the lip of the lid, and focuses on it; time seems to slow to a single slice as he brings his foot up in a smooth motion... _Give me a long enough lever and a place to stand and I can move the world..._ In the next moment, he stomps on the other end of the crowbar, neatly flipping the manhole cover out onto the ground. In the next motion he's down the ladder.

As Poe makes for the kitchen door, though, the sound of boots from the other side sounds a little too close. Turning around, he heads back into the main mess hall, leaping up on one end of a row of tables, then running along its length, hopping from one row to the next. At the end of the last row, he jumps again, just as the door at the far end begins to open - and catches the doorframe in both hands, pulling hard, his feet sweeping between the guards' heads as his momentum carries him through.

One guard is caught by the door as Morgan's feet push it open; the other two lunge toward Morgan, only to collide with each other. Morgan hits the far end of the hallway, staggers for a moment to regain his balance, and then dashes down the hallway again, looking for someplace to get a few moments to concentrate.

As the manhole cover clatters to the ground, wobbling like a coin that's just been tossed, the van speeds off. As Xin nears the prison, he realizes that he's got no idea how to get inside. _Windows_ comes to him at the last moment, as he steers off to one side of the prison, wheels turning outside and in.

There is a look of intense concentration on Xin's face. His breathing is calm and carefully measured. His right arm is outstretched entirely, and his legs are flexed. Scattered around his feet is a variety of debris, stone, steel, paint... and in front of him, at the end of his outstretched hand, is a convenient hole. In the wall. Concentration turns to disbelief. _Right then._ Xin ducks inside.

A small, high window at the far end of the hallway seems to beckon to Poe as he approaches the T-junction at the far end. Either direction looks clear... but a doorway labeled "GYMNASIUM" around one corner looks promising. He rounds the corner at full speed, letting his footsteps echo for a moment, then slinks back along the wall and opens the door silently, slipping inside like a shadow. Or at least like his idea of a shadow - although his days of college pranks had taught him at least a little bit about how to make as little noise as possible.

Once inside, Morgan leans against the door, holding his breath until the pounding of boots passes. It won't take them too long to double back, but at least he has a few moments to catch his breath. He pulls out the walkie-talkie and pushes the Talk button. "Benford? Do you hear me?" he hisses.

Benford pulls the radio out of his pocket, frantically panning a pocket flashlight over the labels and junction boxes in the vaults. "I hear you, Morgan. Help is coming. What happened?"

"The machine guys have taken over the place!" comes Poe's voice over the speaker. "They took me into the minimum security zone, and they played some kind of static over the PA that knocked out Eddie and turned the psych and his friend into... I dunno, they seemed brainwashed to me." A staticky sigh - Morgan knows this isn't quite right, but there's little time for explanations now. "I need Eddie back somehow. I can't figure out what they did to him, but maybe you can."

"I hear you too," adds Xin. His voice crackles over the radio, "Where are you? I've just come inside. They don't make 'em like they used to," he explains.

Benford finds what he's looking for, and tears the lid off a complicated junction box with the crowbar. He replies to Poe, "Explain - do you need that now? Because it's going to be hard to do anything inside."

"I'm in the gym. Dammit, we shoulda tried to get a map of the place first..." Poe says. "Benford - do you think you could do something with the static if I could get you a clearer sample? Like, if I wired this walkie-talkie into the PA system somehow? There's something metaphysical about this static - maybe it's like the System, and it makes a difference if you're physically connected. Then I just have to get them to play the static again..."

"Alright. I'll be there shortly. Is Jet around?" Xin starts moving as he speaks, his hands are held up and out, ready for a fight. He starts running, keeping his eyes open for, well, anyone.

Xin adds, "I'll ask for directions, don't worry."

Benford considers this. "Poe, Try the radio trick at you're discretion. I'm working on their phones, that might suffice," he comments as he wires his laptop into the diagnostic terminal of the telephone relay. "Secure your exit first."

It's not too long before Jet presents herself to Xin. The form of the raven shifting in midair to that of Jet, complete with her longcoat and glasses. "We're in deep shit. The guards are hunting something, but they aren't talking. They aren't sharing descriptions. They may smell like men, but they sure as hell don't act like humans hunting for someone. They act more like machines."

It's about this time that four men come round a corner, and spot Jet and Xin standing together ...

"Oh." Xin clicks the walky-talky, "I'm going to have to get back to you in a minute Poe."

Benford's laptop is an expensive toy from CERN; the same that was bolted to his wheelchair, in fact. Benford himself has hacked in a dozen different communication ports; one of them is an ATM port, which is, significantly, a standard used by phone companies worldwide. The conversation over the radio is not encouraging; with the violence about to start, it's imperative that he stall reinforcements. He types furiously with his right hand, while adjusting cable connections with his left. He holds the flashlight in his mouth to illuminate the dark walls, although the spot where he stands is itself a column of light from the open manhole. A column of sunlight... _Lands of Light, huh? Let's show that some solar power..._

Benford clicks his radio. "Poe. Find an intercom grill. We need to do your radio idea. I can't cancel the signal, but we can interfere with it."

Morgan looks around, and sees a grille on the ceiling. "Okay... what do you want me to do with it?"

Benford transmits, "You're going to need to crack open your walkie, and wire it into the input jack. I can tell you how, but then we won't be able to talk." Quickly, the scientist describes the procedure; a simple matter of splicing three particular wires. "Got all that?"

"Yeah, I got it - but they don't have phones in this part of the jail, so I have to get out past the checkpoint somehow. I'll try to find Xin - if he got in, he should be able to get out. I'll call you back when I'm there." Morgan puts away the walkie-talkie, and grabs some aerobics barbells off the rack. The little weights will serve to add a little extra something if he gets trapped in a corner and needs to punch someone - no substitute for proper brass knuckles, but it's more of a weapon than he had. Just for good measure, he grabs a towel as well, draping it over his shoulder.

"Understood," the scientist replies, and concentrates on programming an interference pattern.

Morgan emerges from his hiding place just in time to see another guard patrol come round the far end of the hall. Cursing, he ducks round the corner, the guards pounding down the corridor after him. Thinking quickly, he drapes the white towel on the linoleum, and darts down the corridor again.

As the guards come round the corner after him, the first one fails to notice the white towel on the white linoleum and steps straight on it - and discovers that there is very little friction between the towel he wasn't expecting and the floor that he was. His foot goes flying out from under him, and he sprawls face first on the tiles. The other two guards step around the wreckage, but Morgan is already around the next corner and accelerating... listening desperately for the sounds of fighting, which he feels certain will indicate Xin's position sooner or later.

Confronted by charging guards, Jet acts almost as if they aren't even there. She walks right at them, saying casually over her shoulder, "This is it? A few half-trained children?" She slips with catlike grace and laziness into a ready pose, "If you lay down your weapons, you live in one piece." There's no tension in her, there's no forced-swagger, her voice is even and steady, and she's utterly unimpressed by what she's dealing with, every bit of her at ease, unbothered by static and the impending battle before her. "So, do you want to die today?"

The Lunar moves smoothly as the guards attack. Her motions are not to defeat them. She's focusing them all on her, and as one swings to crack her skull she spins inside his swing, her eyes tracing the pattern of the next mad swing with a mixture of disdain and excitement. That one she ducks under, letting the air of it disturb her hair before she leaps skyward, bracing her feet on the thighs of two of the guards, kicking her way higher still until she can leap off the head of a guard and at the apex of her leap smash her fist through one of the speakers that is emitting that static.

The guards stagger back as Jet pushes off of them. Unfortunately, they stagger back into Xin, who has been waiting patiently. His fists blur as he springs into action, clapping two of the guards' heads together. He pushes off of one of the walls, foot lashing out at one of the guards just as Jet lands. He nods towards her, grinning. "Shall we then?" He twists his hand and beckons the guards closer.

The last guard's attention is diverted towards Xin just a second too long. With a loud thump, Jet slams her elbow into the back of the guard's head, sending him sprawling. "Let's move." She keeps her eyes and ears open. If there's any sign of movement, she's going to be on it. She sniffs steadily at the air, as well, hoping to catch Poe's scent.

With the fall of that guard, Jet hears the slightest noise of metal on metal that gets her attention. To a seasoned opportunist and thief, that is a noise like coins striking the bottom of a bank. She leans down, making a quick check of the guards. If they have any handcuffs on them, they're going to wake up wearing them, as well.

Jet and Xin race down the halls and weave their way slowly through the prison. It is not by Jet's senses, but by something closer to dumb luck, or fate that the three wind up face to face. Jet lets out a sigh and races to Morgan to embrace him, "You're okay!"

Breathing heavily, Morgan pounds his way down a hallway - only to see a guard fly across the corridor and sprawl, unconscious. He comes round the corner and ends up with an armful of Jet. "Oh, thank God," he says, then laughs a little. "We need to get to a phone in the building. There won't be any on this side of the gates, but if we can get to the office side of the building..."

"Sure. That's why we're here," says Xin. He smiles, "Also, there's a way out not far from here. Hole in the wall. So remember where we are now, so we can get out later. No doubt we can ask one of the gaurds where a phone is."

Jet looks from Xin to Poe and holds up a key chain, "Will this help?" she asks curiously. "It's not as fun as picking locks, but we are in a bit of a hurry, aren't we?"

Xin considers the key chain. "It would seem so." He gestures down the hallway, "Poe, do you know where we're going? If not, well, we'll get to do things my way. You don't suppose that there's any chance we're going to have to deal with the prisoners? If the guards can be controlled... well..."

As though in response, the group hear the sound of marching feet from down the hall.

"Most of the prisoners in minimum security are away on job programs," Poe says. "We might see one or two, but it's mostly guards. I... think I can find my way back to the checkpoint I came in at," he adds.

Outside, on Benford's PC, the screen goes abruptly dark.

On the screen, words print themselves:

DO NOT INTERFERE.
