# Fall of Eden 2006-10-20

In a telephone junction vault a mile short of the Washington state penetentiary in Walla Walla, Benford has just received an unexpected contact, presumably from the masters of the 'experiment' occuring within its walls. Benford allows himself a moment of surprise, but then, in the past ten minutes, the whole affair has escalated beyond surprising. He leaves the his signal analysis program running in the background while talking to the interloper. _Make it worth my while. We can have an armistace if you'll allow our people to withdraw._

Words appear on the featureless black screen. THE MEN INSIDE THE PRISON ARE IN A STATE OF HARMONY. YOUR ALLIES DISRUPT THAT HARMONY.

Benford keeps typing. _Harmony is a virtue, but not the highest. Your observation doesn't invalidate what I just said. We came here seeking an explanation for the assault on Andrew Morgan. Explain that and allow us to withdraw, and we will leave your illusion intact._

YOUR ALLIES INFILTRATED THE PRISON UNDER FALSE PRETENSES AND CAUSED PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THE FACILITY. THIS CONSTITUTES AN ASSAULT. UNDER SECTION 72.02.160 OF WASHINGTON STATE LAW, WE MAY CONTACT THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE MUNICIPALITY AND COUNTY TO ASSIST IN RESTORING ORDER.

_Your claim to protection under local statutes is amusing. How sympathetic do you think local law enforcement will be when they find out that you've been brainwashing inmates? We both know that this is not a matter for police. Do you want to argue about immigration laws? Do all of your agents carry proper visas? Has your psychotherapy technique been approved by the FDA?_

ARE YOU CAPABLE OF PROVING THESE ALLEGATIONS IN A COURT OF LAW? OR WILL YOU CONTINUE TO EMPLOY THE EXTRA-LEGAL METHODS YOU HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED?

_The organization in that prison also employs extralegal methods. How lawful was the assault on Andrew Morgan? Is your function to follow logic and argument or to win at any cost? Engage my argument or cease wasting my time. You can start by identifying who you are and who you represent. Otherwise, we're going to do this my way. Make your decision._

YOU SPOKE OF ARMISTICE. IF YOU WISHED TO PURSUE THE MATTER IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR SOCIETY'S LAWS, YOU WOULD HAVE DONE SO THROUGH THE LEGAL SYSTEM. NOW YOU INTEND TO BARTER SOME SORT OF INDIVIDUAL DEAL. YOU EXPRESS INDIGNATION AT THE IDEA THAT WE MIGHT RESTRAIN PARTIES WHICH ENTERED THE FACILITY WITH HOSTILE, OR AT LEAST BELLIGERENT, INTENTIONS. YOU ASSERT THAT AN ASSAULT ON MR. MORGAN IS "OUR" RESPONSIBILITY, YET YOU HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED WHO "WE" ARE. LET US BEGIN WITH THAT, IF YOU ARE DEDICATED TO THE LOGICAL ARGUMENT, RATHER THAN USING LOGIC AS A RHETORICAL EXCUSE.

WHO ARE WE TO YOU?

_I presume that I'm speaking to a representitive of the masters of the organization that is in de facto control of the prison. You speak of 'harmony'; that implies a social organization, or at least a social concensus, even if we have reason to believe that it's due to a coercive technological influence. As Andrew Morgan's assailants all had a common background in a particular rehab program here, we presume that you have knowledge of those men, and quite probably the motive for the assault. We cannot assume that you are behind the assault, but similarly, you should not assume that our intentions were belligerent. Our direct purpose is reconnaisance. However, circumstances have compelled us to amend that objective._

HAVE YOU PROPOSED A MOTIVE FOR THIS ASSAULT?

_We have hypotheses, but we do not have sufficient evidence to confirm or deny. Some are also contingent on ontological truths that are unknown and possibly unknowable. What does the word 'exaltation' mean to you?_

THAT IS TANGENTIAL TO OUR INITIAL DISCUSSION; WE SHALL RETURN TO IT LATER. DATA INDICATING BELLIGERENT INTENTION ON YOUR PART: A RADIO SIGNAL CARRYING NO MEANINGFUL DATA IS TRANSMITTED; THIS IS FOLLOWED BY AN INTRUSION BY TWO OTHER PARTIES WHO THEN ASSAULT SEVERAL GUARDS. DO YOU DENY THIS?

_No. Those signals were from an ally and indicated to us a credible, imminent threat to his person. At this time, we do not know the specific nature of that threat. However, we are willing to act on incomplete information. Andrew Morgan has already been assaulted and, to use a metaphor, had entered the 'lion's den'. It is reasonable to credit threats to his person and take extraordinary action._

_Need we be this specific? How much of this is repeating what you already know_

YOU ARE ASSERTING YOUR PREVIOUS SUSPICIONS TO JUSTIFY THE PRESENT ASSAULT. ILLOGICAL, BUT UNDERSTANDABLE. WE THEREFORE COME TO THE REASONING BEHIND THESE SUSPICIONS. YOU BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THE MEN WHO ASSAULTED MR. MORGAN WERE INCARCERATED IN THIS FACILITY, THAT THE ADMINISTRATORS OF THE FACILITY DIRECTED THE ATTACK. IS THIS ACCURATE?

_I assert only that we're pursuing a reasonable course of action under the circumstances. It may have been that your administrators were behind the assault, but even if they weren't, it was likely that someone here would have more information. I dispute the characterization of that as an 'assault'. Subterfuge, perhaps. Violence, no. We have been reduced to violence because we believe Andrew Morgan is threatened, again, and wish to ensure his safety._

WE BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE PERPETRATING VIOLENCE IN THE FACILITY. ON THE BASIS OF THAT BELIEF, ARE WE MORALLY JUSTIFIED IN ENACTING VIOLENCE ON YOU IN RETURN?

Benford sighs. _We believe that there are moral justifications for the violence we perpetrate on you, and so I believe that there are moral justifications for violence you might perpetrate on us. However, even that implies a consensus, of sorts. As we are having a dialog, that violence is avoidable. I would find that preferable. I will admit to you that endorsing violence as a solution is an admission of failure for me. How far would you go to protect those who are subject to your 'harmony'? To what extent have you pledged responsibility to and for them?_

BY DEFENDING THEM AGAINST OUTSIDE INTRUSION. AS WE ARE DOING NOW, WITH YOU. HOWEVER, WE CHOSE TO HALT YOUR INTERFERENCE THROUGH DIALOGUE, RATHER THAN SUBTERFUGE. WE COMMUNICATED OPENLY WITH YOU.

_Yes, and that is as unexpected as it is interesting; also, your means of contact was unconventional. If I didn't know better, I'd think I was speaking to a computer program. Would you explain to me your nature of being, preferred mode of address, and the authority with which you speak?_

__THE ARMISTICE YOU REQUESTED HAS NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED. ANY SHARING OF SUCH INFORMATION WOULD BE CONTINGENT ON SUCH AN AGREEMENT.__

___State your terms, then. Our agreement is predicated on our safe passage. We'd welcome any other terms that will lead to more information about the motive for the original assault on Andrew Morgan.___

__OUR TERMS ARE: PARTICIPATE IN OUR HARMONIOUS ORGANIZATION. IF YOU WILL NOT INTEGRATE YOURSELVES WITH OUR PROGRAM, YOU ARE BY DEFINITION OUR ENEMY.__

__PROBABILITY IS VERY LOW THAT YOU WILL AGREE TO THIS.__

__Benford is silent for a few long, valuable moments, while birds chirp and rainwater drips in the trees beyond the manhole. Then he types, _That's not an armistace, that'a s surrender. There is an implication that you mean to extend your order to the entire world. I have rational and irrational fears of what your 'program' would do to me and my fellows. Will you make a prison of the entire world, then?___

__WE ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO PRESENT TERMS YOU FIND APPEALING, PARTICULARLY IN YOUR STATE OF IGNORANCE. YOU HAVE PRESENTED CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE FOR YOUR COMING HERE. ONLY NOW, WHEN YOUR COMRADES ARE ENGAGING IN VIOLENCE, DO YOU SPEAK OF ARMISTICE. RATHER THAN DECLARE YOUR TRUE INTENTIONS TO US, YOU TAKE WHAT YOU CAN AND THEN SUE FOR CLEMENCY WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF AT A DISADVANTAGE. IF THIS IS THE CUSTOMARY WAY IN WHICH YOU INTEND TO LIVE, IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE WHY YOU WOULD FEAR PARTICIPATION IN HARMONY.__

__Benford frowns. _We live in a dangerous world. I personally lost the ability to live in my intended method when a man threatened a jetload of people just to kill myself and people like me. I will not argue that the world is a perfect place, and I cannot argue that your solution is the wrong one. What I can argue is that you are mistaken that I'm suing for clemency. I'm offering us both an alternative to violence, as I did with the man on the plane, and as we did with a being named Gerhard. We both have to accept that there are other powers in operation in our worlds. Even violence requires an agreement, an agreement to oppose each other. I don't particularly care to dismantle your harmony, but if you're going to divide the world into your subjects and your enemies, you force us to be enemies. Are we going to agree to that?___

__YES.__

__ANY DISCUSSION OF AN ALTERNATIVE DEMANDS INFORMATION. THE ONLY EFFICIENT MANNER TO COMMUNICATE OUR VIEWPOINT REQUIRES THAT YOU ACCEPT KNOWLEDGE. YOU ARE PREDISPOSED TO REJECT THIS NOTION, CALLING IT "BRAINWASHING" ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE WILL COERCE YOUR WILL. THIS IS FALSE. IF YOU WISH TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER, SUBMIT YOURSELF TO ENLIGHTENMENT.__

___And I'm not submitting to that process without more information. You are perceptive to believe that there is a low probability that any of us will accept your terms; agreement depends on a priveleged ontology. You're not the only ones chasing a perfect world. If you understand Exaltation, as you've implied, then you understand our function. Why should we select your alternative over our own? How do you propose to resolve this impasse?___

__WE DO NOT. YOU MUST CHOOSE.__

___Do me the courtesy of allowing me to poll my associates and obtain their responses. Of course, I can give you my own response right now. Shall I do so, or would you prefer to wait for our concensus?___

__RESPOND FOR YOURSELF. IF YOU CANNOT DECIDE WITHOUT INPUT, YOU MUST WAIT.__

___I proceed with incomplete information. Where does self-determination factor in your glorious plan?___

__THAT IS WHAT WE WISH TO UNDERSTAND.__

__Benford finds himself suddenly aware of a figure above and behind him, outside of the 'nook' he's ensconced himself into for the hacking attempt. The man is dressed in biking leathers and a jacket; he has long black hair, done into dreadlocks. And he is wearing sunglasses. Benford feels the hiss of escaping air against his skin and a brief moment of pain; he's been injected with something, using a pneumatic needle. The stranger pulls back, holding the instrument in one hand. "Dr. Benford," he says in a flat voice.__

__Benford puts two and two together, and makes sure he gets out his final response: _My answer: Fuck off.___
