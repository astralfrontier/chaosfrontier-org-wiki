# Fall of Eden 2006-11-02

Benford sits in a column of light at the bottom of a manhole, turning a small dart over between his fingers. The experience was astonishing. Almost as surprising, he's still alive. He looks up; the mechanistic figure, similar to Mister Bland and Gerhard, is visible in silhouette.

The biking leathers the man wears are in stark contrast to his apparently professed philosophy of law and order; perhaps this paradox is lost on him. Nevertheless he stares down at Benford, eyes hidden behind black sunglasses, patiently awaiting some reaction.

"You've got my attention," the scientist announces. "I'm coming up." He climbs the ladder, guessing that if the man wanted him dead, he wouldn't have revived.

The figure steps back, dispassionate as ever. He remains silent, but expectant.

Benford says, "So that explains why you asked if there was moral justification for our attack... it also endorses your own. Why did you ask me, and not your symbiont?"

The man - or being in man's shape - pauses at this. "What you refer to as the symbiont is a distillation of human information infused with Essence as a driving force. It is alive, and templated on a human soul, but it is not a true soul."

Benford says, "So you thought I would give you a better answer?"

The thing shrugs, a human gesture with overtly mechanical execution. "You participate in the cycle of reincarnation. Therefore you may possess data that our capture process lacks."

Benford holds up the dart, visible in the light as a tiny hypodermic needle. "And what data are you seeking, subjecting me to this," he asks, in carefully neutral terms. _That was unreal... almost as good as Exaltation. I can see why it's so powerful._

"I am Axel. I provide order here," the being replies coldly. "That experience was for your benefit and your understanding. Synthetic neurocytes introduced into your brain respond to an encrypted data broadcast, translating sight and sound into knowledge. It is the mechanism for the perfect social order which Dr. Zubevich desires."

Benford nods, rolling the dart in his fingers again. "So you've been sent to help him. And it's truly amazing. If I weren't what I am, I might even endorse it." He slips the dart into his pocket. "But this can't be the entire solution. Tell me. Is it your logic that leads you to see the world as Unity or Enemy, or was it Doctor Zubevich that decided on that division?"

"Any world-wide, united society must logically make that division, Doctor," replies Axel. "The most optimal case which permits unchecked deviation is a system of alliances, such as blocs of nation-states as they currently exist. Managed deviation is still permissible in a united social order."

"Possibly," Benford states. "But there have been hundres of socities that believed that. 'Believe as we do and all will be well.' One of the hallmarks of an ethical society is the rights they assign to those that don't conform. I can't give you all the answers, but I can tell you that it's insufficient to merely destroy those who dissent."

Benford says, "Your experiment is going to revise the social order, the system of blocs and nations we have now. Alliances and conformities will change. The borders and boardrooms may not resemble what exists now. I assume you don't see a higher moral value in negotiating with the existing order than a new order. Therefore, I put it to you that you are in one of those situations. My friends and I are a de facto bloc. Do you propose to 'manage' us? Establish an alliance? Or leave us unchecked?"

"The next few minutes will determine that," Axel answers.

Guards are rapidly approaching the party of Jet, Xin, and Poe. They are wearing the uniforms of the prison security staff and are armed with tonfas and other submission weapons - nothing lethal enough to pose a danger to the prison if a convict should get it, but enough to discourage an unarmed troublemaker.

"Well, looks like the tour is about to reach the good part," mutters Jet. She looks over to Xin and then back to the cluster of guards. "I think you can have this first group. I'm going to check on something." She's going to dart off and see if she can get a glimpse of what is going on outside.

Morgan hangs back, watching Xin and Jet - the more experienced combatants. With Jet gone, the reporter acts in the only way he knows how. As the three fan out to confront the Chinese, he spots an opening. His Dockers squeak on the stone floor as he moves. He spots one of the men focusing on Xin, cocks a fist, and asserts himself.

Two of the guards come at Xin. Moving faster than most people should, the solar ducks under a tonfa, and twists his body around a second. As he dodges out of the way, his foot lashes out, shattering one of the weapons and putting that guard out of the fight.

"Hey, leave me one!" protests Morgan at the destruction of the weapon. His target has shaken himself out of the brief stun the first punch produced, and Morgan responds by crouching and delivering an uppercut to the guard's jaw. His weapon spins through the air and the journalist snatches it out of its downward tumble with his uncurling fingers, a satisfied grin on his face.

Xin flows from the kick into a low crouch. He slides forward as the last remaining guard tries to bring his tonfa down. There is a sharp exhalation as Xin unfurls, arm outstretched, chi flowing to the fist. The guard slams against the far wall, leaving a slight crack in the old stone as he slumps to the ground.

In the relative silence following the fight, Benford's voice crackles over the radio. "Big problem. Black vans are on the way, probably got the heavy mob in them. Forget the jammer, just get out. You've got two minutes maximum."

Jet does see the vans in the distance, coming down the hill before they'll be occluded by the walls of the prison. But she sees something else.

The prison is not empty, or even half-empty. Hundreds of men in the distinctive orange jumpsuit of a convict are lining up in the yard. They are joined by the guards, but not monitored or controlled by them. Instead, turnkey and prisoner alike are forming a sea of ordered humanity outside. A knot of men are body-blocking the hole Xin made. Others are forming into sub-groups and moving toward the entrances and exits, presumably to provide similar coverage. They move with one purpose and one mind, driven by the song of static that hums over the PA system.

Jet knows how to sum this situation up very succinctly. "Shit!" She spins around and races back to find Xin and Poe free from guard issues. The news is relayed quickly, and what she saw is made as clear as can be. "Looks like the only way to disperse these guys is to mess with the transmission. Or maybe to hack it and make them do whatever we want instead. The best place to be in a submissive society is the top, right?"

"Hey Benford! The prison is blocked. These guys are all brain-washed. You have any ideas for knocking out the signal controlling them or doctoring it to make our own orders?" Jet's voice is surprisingly relaxed. "I don't think my karma can take the death of about a thousand people today."

Xin hmms, "You know they've probably figured out that we're gonna want to head for the broadcast equipment. So I hope at least one of you knows how that stuff'll work, because I don't think I can hold them off forever."

Benford replies, "Steam tunnels, maybe, or the roof. Look, I think I got what we came for. Break down the doors, anything, just get out!"

"Well, let's go shut this crap off. Back to the checkpoint?" Jet likes this plan. She's confident of it. Well, at least until she realizes there are four armed guards here. "I think this is the part of the plan were Xin and Poe figure something out, cause these odds aren't the best," she whispers. At least not the best for not having to kill someone.

"I've figured out something," says Xin. He turns to Jet, "Take out the speaker, we'll beat up the guards, and let's not get shot," He tenses up and prepares to leap into the fray and nods to Jet, "Ready when you are."

Morgan tightens his grip on the tonfa and nods grimly.

"The speaker, huh?" murmurs Jet. She looks up. There's a moment of thought, and then she says to Xin, "You got it." Hopefully Xin is feeling strong, because he's about to be used as a ladder. Jet walks right up his body, kicking off his thigh up against the wall, then leaping from the wall towards the ceiling. At the apex of her leap, she slams her first right into the PA, pitting the might of a Full Moon Lunar against the strength of mortal technology with a roar of defiance.

While Jet moves, Morgan slips his wristwatch off and tugs his necktie free, looping the one around the other to form an improvised flail, sling, or fetching tool as circumstances warrant. Dry-cleaning and the cost of a new imitation Rolex are the least of his worries right now.

As Jet descends from her jump her body shifts, the Lunar's flesh easily reshaping itself. She takes wing in the form of a cardinal, her bright red standing out as she rushes at the bars. Her path is carefully calculated, guided by the wary whispers of the fox to avoid fire.

Xin starts moving as soon as Jet leaps off of his body. He rushes forward in a shower of sparks that spills out from the shattered speaker, shouting at the guards. He is ready for them to open fire, trying to keep bars between him and at least one of the guards.

Morgan dives through the door at a different angle, rolling along the floor, using everything he picked up from fencing in college, and feeling his skin grow hot as something else kicks in almost instinctively.

Once through the bars, Jet soars at the speaker system on this side of the wall. A cardinal isn't a very formidible power, however. Fortunately, Jet's body is ready to accomodate her special needs, and so instead of a little bird pecking at the speaker, the paw of a massive siberian tiger lashes out at it. Unfortunately for the guard below, tigers cannot fly. Jet allows almost all of her weight to bear down on the hapless guard, though she does try to avoid killing him in the process. The others may not be so fortunate.

Jet sees the way to let others in, but even if these guys stink at their jobs, they are likely to hit her eventually. The first matter of business is for the tiger to deal with the guns. In a way, her attacks resemble those made by any housecat, but on a much more terrifying scale. Paws lash out with all the speed that the smaller felines show, but with power closer to that of a bear. She strikes twice, first at the nearest gunman, and then suddenly at the next, trying to smash their weapons away. The first swipe is directed in the hopes of knocking a weapon towards the gate itself.

Jet hates guns. At least those that are firing in her direction. Through sheer physical endurance one bullet leaves no meaningful mark on the powerful tigress, another, however, bloodies her. The wound is not a serious one. At least not to her. The guards, however, will live only long enough to regret it. The white tiger roars and Jet focuses on the guards who are still armed. With one leap she seeks to maul one guard and with the force of her blows throw him into the other.

The work is quick, if unpleasant to watch. Jet is kind enough to only destroy the one who wounded her before she allows her companions inside. Pointedly she remains in the form of the tigress, growling deeply should the guards so much as move an inch, and meeting them with the vivid, emotionless eyes of a predator.

And even as the tiger tears through the prison guards, Morgan senses the absence of a sound he had forgotten he was hearing - and the presence of a voice long missed. _Eddie! You're okay?_ The reporter looks around. _I'm gonna lose you in a minute as soon as I get back in range of the static. Before that happens..._ Morgan takes a deep breath. _I need you to hook up the Engine._ He grits his teeth, bracing himself for the shock.

Xin gets to work cuffing the guards together, making it so that even if the tiger weren't there watching them, they'll be unable to move enough to do anything, glancing nervously at Jet as he does. It's something he's still not quite used to, and there's no real hiding that fact.

A halo begins to appear around Morgan. Sparkles of golden Essence begin to shine, and in them a humanoid figure begins to coalesce. He's a young man, with a brilliant smile and hopeful eyes, who reaches out with a radiant hand. Morgan extends his own. As the two clasp their hands together in the grip of comrades, the glow becomes an unbearably bright aura that surrounds Morgan.

A transformation begins, marked by a circle of light on the ground around him. The Dockers on his feet transmute themselves into sandals, while the gray slacks and baby-blue shirt subsume themselves into coruscant robes of light. Morgan's Caste Mark burns from his brow, and his eyes are alight with Solar fire.

He stretches out an open hand, and the last of the ambient radiance coalesces into a shimmering gun of light. It is clearly no ordinary or Earthly firearm; as the light fades, it's obvious to Xin and Jet alike that this is a Golden Gun, the weapon of an ordained hero.

Morgan shakes his head as he catches his breath. In the back of his head, he can hear the unspoken voices he's been suppressing for years - the ones that tell him, _The rules are for other people, you don't need them, do it your way and to hell with everyone else..._ And right now, breaking out of prison, he finds them harder to ignore than usual. But he doesn't have time for that right now. "Right," he says, and his voice is deeper, more confident. "Let's get to the broadcast closet." He speaks into the walkie-talkie. "Benford - got a direction for us?"

A mile distant from the prison, two large black vans roar by, bearing the exempt plates typical of Washington government vehicles - especially the police. Benford doesn't see them; he's hiding in the vault, stymied by Axel's infiltration of his laptop. "Don't know," he grunts over the radio. "I'm having trouble here. Axel doesn't want me to interfere. Just find any input to the PA for a start."

Benford continutes, "Just put a PA mic next to any PA speaker. Any mic, next to any speaker. It won't cancel the signal, but it should disrupt it. Look for a secure office, near a checkpoint, with a big phone on it. We don't have time for anything more."

Xin, Jet, and the glowing god Morgan with his holy pistol sprint through the hall of the prison like three avenging angels. Guards, prisoners, and secretaries all oppose them, unified by the mind of Axel and the heart of Dr. Zubevich.

Jet is in no position to be fetching microphones. She does carry a gun, however. It's pretty useless right now, except for the shock factor of seeing a huge tiger rush at you with a gun in its mouth. She moves like a ghost, and for a creature so large Jet somehow finds a way to avoid immediate notice. She carries herself away from the others, and eyes that know there is no way a tiger can be here are remarkably likely to confirm that fact by missing her entirely. She curbs her wrath, using her might to disarm and subdue rather than slay those who dare get in her way.

Morgan's glowing bullets find their mark, striking every PA speaker he can find. He aims up and left for one, over his shoulder to shoot another blind, and a third just in time for the falling cone to strike a guard on the head.

Xin is ready for the opposition. As they rush around a corner, Xin kicks off from one wall to another, running up and forward until it comes time to descend. He doesn't fall, so much as kick downwards, fists and feet lashing out into the cluster, turning it into sprawling pile as golden light cascades out from Morgan.

The senior staff's offices are close. A door swings out into the hall and three of the prison staff prepare their attack from behind its comforting solidity. Morgan wastes no time - he shoots the hinges, crouches just as Xin leaps overhead, then discharges three more rounds behind him without looking. The men who had been creeping up on the duo back away immediately from this cover-fire. And Xin's foot smashes into the suddenly-loose door, knocking down the ambushers who were hiding behind it.

Morgan leaps forward and kicks the door off the now-prone bodies of the ambushers, then leaps onto the back of the door and shields himself from several rounds of gunfire. The guards coming round the far corner are crouched and shooting; Morgan lands atop to the door, riding it in a skidding, screeching path along the linoleum. His gun fires again and again, knocking the pistols from the guards' hands.

As Morgan slides down the corridor on the door, Xin leaps into the now doorless opening. He rolls as he lands, narrowling missing a hail of gunfire. A swift kick sends a heavy desk tumbling to the ground, and the Solar flips behind it. A trail of bullet holes follows his motion, thudding into, but not through, the sturdy wood.

Jet's approach is not quite so beautiful to see, but it is certainly an image that will stick with those present. The final guards are charged by a tiger riding an office chair full-tilt into the desk Morgan hides behind. Just as they fire Jet leaps free of the rolling chair and latches onto the wall behind, claws digging in just long enough to give her traction for a backwards, spinning leap that delivers her razor sharp claws in a series of blurring blows. In the end, the wounds are many, but all light, and the guards do not move.

There is a brief pause as the chaos of the fight comes to an end. The pause is marked by the clattering of the last few spent shells against the ground. As the metallic sound dies down, Xin looks to the others, "Alright. Let's move." He presses on ahead, making straight for the PA room.

Benford climbs up the ladder for the last time, dropping his bag beside the manhole. Axel remains, impassive, a subtle threat. "We only interfere to cover our escape," he says, "and for that I apologize, but the damage won't be irreperable. Perhaps our next meeting will be less... complicated."

Axel says nothing, but looks over Benford's shoulder. The scientist turns, and recognizes another figure - Gerhard, still wearing his imposing leather. The two machine-men regard each other through sunglasses, saying nothing. Finally Axel responds to Benford. "Doctor, you understand our motives. Your own are murky, perhaps even to yourself. For as long as you remain human, I fear you will complicate any encounter we have."

The newcomer speaks as well. "Dr. Benford. Mr. Morgan has discovered the first stages of a different sort of fusion - that of soul and Essence." He regards his colleague, speaking now to him. "Axel. The conflict between our programs will be resolved later. Please contact me when you have things in hand here."

Benford's confusion is obvious. _Where the hell did he come from? Out here in the middle of nowhere?_ "That same murkiness also leaves me room to think that you might be right. There is merit in what you do here, and I hope we have a chance to discuss that at another time."

"Attempts on your life may be made, Doctor," replies Axel equitably. "Do not allow that to discourage you in maintaining dialogue. Contact information will be left on your laptop."

---

Unified order breaks down. In the ensuing chaos of prisoner and guards sorting out what's going on... the confusion of which is only enhanced by the blaring feedback throughout the PA system, the three who'd been in the offices make their way down a hallway. Some confused prisoners try to stop them, and are left mercifully unconscious. The steam tunnels are eerie, dank, and echo the footsteps of the three Exalts running down them. In their wake, only a smashed door remains as a sign of their passing. With no one following them just yet, the Exalts make their way topside, and speed off in their getaway van. At the last moment, Xin sends their vehicle into an almost impossible spin, cursing, "Almost forgot to pick up Benford." Tires leave marks as they speed towards the spot where Xin last remembers leaving the other Solar. _I sure hope he's still there._

Axel and Gerhard stand together as the van passes them. They make no attempt to stop it, nor do they direct anyone's attention to it. They merely mark its departure before turning to walk together down the hill.

Morgan scowls at Dal Kelton, the original clue in the long and confusing chain of events that led to Walla Walla. The researcher is cowering in his office as the reporter leans forward. "I swear I didn't want any of this to happen! I swear!"

Morgan slams his hands down on the table. "Tell me the truth, Doctor!" he barks. Kelton wilts, and begins speaking.

"Zubevich had ideas. Goals. He.. he's the one working with those devils. He and I.... we .. we were going to cooperate. Everything would be handled legally, professionally. We were going to rehabilitate.. But then I learned about those things. Creatures, from another world, and... and their god. It was blasphemous, but I didn't care. I was on the leading edge of something truly revolutionary. Do you understand?"

"The Discovery Institute was just what they needed, and I.... I... in a moment of anger, I said.. I said, I wish that man Morgan was out of the way. I said he was the enemy of everything we were doing and had to be confronted. I had no idea Zubevich would allow it, but I don't think he did... I think... I think those machines just took me at my word. I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan, I'm so terribly sorry!"

The man breaks down into tears, collapsing on his desk.

Morgan is silent for several moments, staring at Dr. Kelton. Finally, he speaks. "Tragic, isn't it? You were only doing what you thought was right. And so was I. And so is Zubevich, and so are the machines." Though Poe's tone is cold, he can't help but feel a little pity for the man - he'd gotten caught up in matters that were beyond him.

"I'll never deal with them again, honest, I swear," weeps Kelton.

"Never deal with whom, Dr. Kelton? The machines, or the Discovery Institute?" asks Morgan.

"The machines! Those abominations..." The man holds his hands to his face.

Morgan tilts his head. "I see. Do the machines mince words, confuse ideas, distort the truth?" He shakes his head. "Oh, you've heard all this before, I've written it enough times. But... what did they need the DI for, anyway?"

This question seems to catch Kelton off-guard. "Why... need the Institute for? They were going to work with us, to support our mission.."

"And why would they do that, Dr. Kelton? If they are such abominations, why would they want to help you? And ask yourself - does that say more about _them_, or about your mission?" Poe sighs. "I accept your apology, Dr. Kelton. Let us keep the conflict between us in the realm of words and ideas - where it belongs."

WALLA WALLA, Washington - SWAT teams contained a prison riot at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla this afternoon. A large number of prisoners from the main institution convened in the exercise yard and began to assault the guards for reasons unknown.

Two rapid response units, apparently acting on an inside tip that the riot was about to take place, arrived on the scene in time to contain the inmates with tear gas and riot batons. No prisoners were reported missing.

---

With Poe infiltrating the prison and Jet maintaining the overwatch, Xin and Benford remain in the van several miles from the prison. The forest sounds unusually quiet after spending so much time listening to engine noise. Occasional breezes shake water from the tall pines, leaving the windows covered with beads of rain.

Benford yawns and stretches in the front passenger seat. "I hope we find something here," he remarks. "I feel like we're missing something important. Probably something very obvious."

"That's probably 'cause we are," replies Xin. He pushes idly at the keys as they hang out of the ignition. There's a slight jingling, "You've gotta pay attention to feelings like that. Otherwise you end up like the person in the movies, opening the door that you just know someone's hiding behind."

"You're probably right," Benford replies, "but I have a hard time trusting conclusions that I don't reach by logic." A breeze blows through the trees, giving the van a fresh spray. "Our opponents - these mechanical beings - seem to have the same problem."

"Maybe. You gotta wonder about that though, aside from all of the other things you have to wonder about mysterious mechanical beings that want to fight against beings of some kind of divine power," Xin says this deadpan. "Maybe that's part of the uh... the Eddies." He points at the spot on the arm where Poe's magitech friend resides. "But then maybe I should ask, why do you think that something you can come across by feeling can't be reached by logic? Maybe it's just a different kind."

Benford thinks about this for a few moments. "Well, I could start in on incompleteness theorems, but I suppose that would defeat the purpose, wouldn't it?" He faintly smiles. "I guess I just prefer to be certain. It's harder to be certain about intuition, althought it also seems that it's easier to trust intuition as an Exalt."

"Yeah. I've noticed the same thing. I think that has something to do with how as an Exalt you can be fairly certain that, if nothing else, you have a better chance of bringing an intuition about," replies Xin. He looks a bit uncertain there, "I'm not sure that came out right."

Benford says, "I think I follow. Hel said similar things quite often. We're very competent, but it's not just that. Essence manipulation also... bends fate, I guess. In physics we sometimes say that gravity results from mass bending space. Maybe it's the same thing."

"Maybe." Xin shrugs, "Lucky I'm not a scientist. I don't have to come up with a whole new branch of science for Essence Manipulation." He grins at Benford, "That's for you more uh, thoughtful types."

Benford motions at his laptop bag, with its dozens of notes, memoranda, and journal articles. "Enough work for lifetime," the scientist grins, "but you know, I guess that's how I want it. What about you? Did meeting God - or at least an Archangel - did that change the world for you?"

Xin looks outside as a new spray washes against the windows. A couple of droplets make their way down the window, and Xin is following their path with his gaze. "Yeah, of course it did. Everything I'd half-hoped for, or imagined, I can do. It doesn't mean I will, or even that I'll succeed, but there's a chance. That hope's a powerful thing."

"Hope for yourself," Benford advances, "or hope for the world?"

"Both, really." Xin expands that idea, "At least, hope for how I see the world. The trick there is that I think everyone has an ideal world all their own."

Benford silently ponders this for a while. Finally, he says, "Perhaps part of our task is to find a way to reconcile them."

Xin leans back comfortably in his seat. At least as comfortable as one can get. "Maybe. We'll have to see. What do you think happens with the Machines though? I mean, how do they fit in to all of this?"

Before either of them can answer, the crackle of the radio coming on sounds, startling both of them out of their fast-food induced philosophical reverie. It's Poe, and he needs help.
