"Alright." Xin is speaking. It's been about a day since the admission regarding the hummer and the encounter with the Assembled. Right now Xin's pacing outside the trailer, trying to explain his plan. "What I am thinking we, or at least I, can do is this... make some kind of display of physicality. You know, something to display my value as a bodyguard or something, with the hopes of being hired on as muscle, you know? And once I find out the location of a shipment... we can try and disrupt it."

"Now there's a couple of problems with this plan. Number one... I don't blend in well with the locals." Xin starts ticking off numbers on his fingers, "Well, really that's the big one. I am open to suggestions, though."

Morgan rubs his chin. "Well, first step, we need to get you some dark sunglasses. Your skin tone is probably close enough if we hide those eyes of yours," he notes. "Next, hablas espanol?"

Jet arches an eyebrow and laughs softly. "It's a bit more than that. You don't act the part. I don't think they'll be fooled into thinking you are Mexican for very long. They can spot a gringo from a mile away. Can you act like a hired gun? Getting past race is possible if you look worthwhile to them."

"Yeah. I can act like a hired gun," says Xin. "Dark sunglasses help both things, really. Although, I'm just learning the spanish. Maybe if we had someone else to do the talking, like Ricky or something."

"I know Spanish," replies Jet evenly. "But I'm not precisely going to fit in. They might want to take me to the sack, but that isn't likely to help you get hired." She smirks at this and says, "If Ricky can help you get in, that would probably be the smartest move. I have my own little ideas. They aren't very nice, but they will work over time."

Xin chuckles, "My ideas aren't the nicest of ideas. Although they're a little more direct, probably. What are your ideas, Jet? Or do we not really want to know?"

Morgan taps his chin. "It _could_ work. If these guys are looking to make a major strike, they'll need more than just guns - they'll need people to hold them. That's something the Assembled can't supply. Our friends the cartels probably have the subtle equivalent of Now Hiring signs up."

"I need to find out who is most talented and important, but I was thinking of removing people bit by bit. It takes a while, but if you deal with the right people the whole operation can fall apart," says Jet. "I'd much rather just do this head-on, of course, but sometimes we have to be tactful."

"I think in this case, we need to be tactful until we can take them head on." There is something about the way Xin says this last phrase that makes it sound enjoyable. "Well then I can see what Ricky and I can come up with if we can find some Now Hiring signs. We may have to make our own..."

"There may be other ways of finding the key people - the, uh, tactful choices," says Poe. "Perhaps we can convince their business associates to help us out in that respect..."

"The cartels aren't attacking San Francisco for the hell of it," adds Poe. "They're trying to gain more power for themselves. Right now, they're just pawns to the big Colombian cartels that supply the, how shall we say, commodities. A major purpose of this attack is for the Mexicans to gain some independence - deal with Colombia on equal terms." The reporter pauses. "A notion that I'm sure would be of considerable interest to the Colombians."

Morgan muses. "Now the problem with _that_ approach is that the Colombians will _not_ be - what was the word? - tactful. If we just tell them, they'll want to deal with the problem directly. That'd get the job done, but I'm afraid a lot of innocents might be caught in the crossfire."

"So what exactly do you propose?" asks Jet curiously. "Use the Columbians as a threat? I'm not sure it will work. They may not believe they have anything to lose."

Morgan shakes his head. "You're probably right about that. But... I'm sure the Colombians know a fair bit about the Mexicans' operations. Who's who and all that. If we can put together enough evidence to convince the Colombians that what we're saying is true... we can offer to be part of the solution as well."

"And if we're part of the solution... then we can get i na position to direct the crossfire, such as it is," says Xin.

Luther Blissett, who has been listening quietly, volunteers an idea of his own. "You know.. the only way to reliably get someone to do something is to make them want to do it. Conversely, someone will never do something they don't want, unless coerced. What you guys need to do is get Xin in there, get some photos of the weapons and assets the Fuentez and Juarez are assembling, then go to the Colombians. Tell them you're a rival cartel and you're willing to deal with the upstarts in exchange for their place in the courier route."

"And they'll say, 'hey, prove to us you can do the job by taking care of business for us here and now.' And they'll sit back."

"And later we get to be drug-runners for them," murmurs Jet. "So maybe this isn't ideal. In either case, Xin's part stays the same. He goes in, gets the job done."

Luther shrugs. "Who says you actually do the job? You just have to keep the Colombians occupied until you finish in Mexico."

Morgan rubs his chin. "I like this more and more. Not only do we spare San Francisco, but we disrupt relations between the various drug runners of South America. The Colombians may be puzzled as to where their new allies went to, but if we're careful, they'll have a hard time tracing it back to _us_."

"Oh, they'll realize they've been had. And like all good reasoning men who lack vital data, they'll come to the wrong conclusion." Luther smiles grimly. "Control the data he receives, and you control the man."

Morgan's smile is equally grim. "All's fair in love and war," he acknowledges. "There are some fates I _would_ wish on my worst enemy."

Jet looks thoughtful for a moment, then nods. "I think it should work. I just hope we avoid any incitement of my friends. They operate through a large area. I hope you don't mind if I keep my name and face out of the mix. I will help in other ways, but I don't want them getting too angry until I'm ready to kill them all."

"So it sounds like we've got a plan," says Xin, "And it is one that doesn't seem too complicated to pull off. I like it." He poses a few more questions, and one by one they hammer out the specifics of where and how to begin and things like that. The plan is laid out... now all that's left is to go and do it.

Luther intercepts Xin and Poe before they move out any further. He extends a pair of laminated plastic cards, clearly printed with authentic-looking credentials. Given the man's line of work and the current complication, forgery seems likely. "These are magic talismans," he says. "I'm not making this up either. If you carry these, I guarantee good luck on your endeavors."

Xin looks down at the laminated talisman he's been given. He examines it, flipping it over, holding it up to the light, and so forth. He looks up, "Magic talismans..." There's no mistaking Luther's expression though. "You're serious."

Morgan looks his over with a practiced eye... well, comparatively practiced. "Well, I have no doubt they'll bring us luck," he says, slipping his into his wallet. "But... you mean something beyond the obvious?"

The spook nods. "I created these using our laminator and some stocks I whipped up. On a purely physical level they are what they are - cooked ID cards, as you see. But through Essence and astrology, they have an existence on another level. They will bring you favor as long as you pursue the goals you've set for yourselves."

Morgan starts into a habitual smirk at the word 'astrology', then stops himself, realizing that an agent of the Sun has no business mocking the stars. "Well, I can't pass _that_ up. Thank you very much, Luther."

"Wow. I am impressed," says Xin, earnestly. "You know, one of these days, you're gonna have to show me a little more about this. Thanks Luther."

Luther manages to catch the expression. "This is not horoscopes and gimcrackery, Mr. Morgan," he says sternly. "Fate is a real and powerful thing. If you disagree, a quick sparring match sometime may settle your doubts." He smiles calmly at Xin, and nods.

"Habits of a lifetime are slow to die," says Morgan. "No matter how many miracles I've seen, or even performed myself."

Xin asides to Morgan, "Remember you are the man with the golden gun." He says to Luther, "I might be interested in that sparring match sometime... but we've got business for now. Thank you again."

The Fuentez and Juarez, following in the tradition of criminal organizations the world over, have a hangout their members frequent. Ricky, after having been informed of the plan, was all too eager to point out likely suspects. Night has long since fallen by the time Xin and company walk through the doors. A jukebox in a corner churns out some of the latest hits, and three men, only one of which seems to not stand out, walk into a bar. The bartender, along with everyone else, notices.

A few whispered words are all it takes to send a couple of people to the back room. All around them is the buzz of activity trying to stay hidden. The center of this activity is inquiry, nobody knows who these men are... do they even know what they've walked into? A few of the more ambitious patrons take steps towards the newcomers. Xin puts himself in the path of trouble. Ricky calmly explains what they are doing here. How they have heard big things... they're connected, and Ricky knows enough to dissuade people from trying to find out his sources immediately. They're reliable enough, he says. While Ricky details their ambitions, Xin is doing his part. Which is why two of the overambitious patrons are currently on the floor, groaning. "My friend here is a pretty good fighter. He doesn't talk much, but that's okay. He does what he's told." Xin nods, keeping his face as expressionless as possible. It's easy to do behind dark glasses.

When the action has settled down and it's time to hammer out the specifics, Ricky gives the prearranged signal. This means Xin is supposed to keep himself out of frame. He's noticed the cameraman, and decides to make his way for the bar. He ducks through the crowd, swaying in tune with the music. He's not bad at moving in time with it, which somehow fits the theme of the night. It also makes it easy for him to invent little excuses to ruin the cameraman's day... such as sidestepping next to a pillar between him and the man trying to take his picture, or turning his back at an opportune moment.

The effort is a success. The cameraman has a lovely picture of Xin moving just out of frame, or his back, or in one case a blurry shot of another patron who Xin stepped around. Ricky signals to Xin. The negotiations are winding down. Xin takes his place at Ricky's side, and looms imposingly. He's had practice at this... _although I could do without someone bursting in on a motorcycle_ he reflects, recalling the last time he portrayed a hired goon. The night winds down, the two have been taken in, they've received their instructions. Phase one is complete.

The next couple of days are interesting. Xin and Ricky are shown where they'll be working, and what they'll be guarding, and if they do good work and don't see too much, maybe there's a bonus in it for them. A shipment's come in, and that they could find some extra guards for it has been a godsend, as they're a little understaffed, as it were. Xin and Ricky spend some time discussing their plan, Ricky does most of the talking, Xin simply nods along, keeping up his facade. They spend the first day getting to know the layout of the holding facility, they've made the rounds, and noted likely points of entry and exit for intruders. Which is rather useful, given their plans.

The second day is when it goes down. Ricky's organized some gambling, and with nothing else to spend money on... the turnout is very nice. It's up to him to keep everyone interested, while Xin makes his rounds. The trick here is to not act suspicious, to not try and sneak about. He moves very purposefully, as though he knows where he's going at all times. A mini digital camera is hidden in his hands, palmed underneath a pack of cigarettes, which Xin has to explain why he might be in an odd place. Ricky's told him what to keep an eye out for, signs of their activities... manifests, things like that. Xin takes pictures here and there, keeping those motions disguised as best as he can.

Xin is nearly caught as well. At one point another man comes around the corner, just as Xin puts away his camera. He calls out to Xin, and puts an arm around him, walking with him for a while, relating to him some elaborate story. Xin just nods along, and is thankful when he is released. _Another few pictures should get us what we need._ When he finishes, he goes back to join the games. Ricky is sure to help him lose enough to be thought well of amongst the rest of the crew.

The shipment is taken care of. At least for now. It'll be another few days, but Ricky and some of the others have arranged to go out on the town. Xin is among them... and while they're out is when Xin is going to slip away to relay the evidence to the others.
