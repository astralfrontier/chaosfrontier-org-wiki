# Fall of Eden 2006-12-08

In addition to covert investigation, Andrew Morgan has also been pursuing more conventional sources. His Lexis-Nexis account hasn't actually been deactivated yet, allowing him to do complicated searches on public news reporting - and even if it had been, these days Google can be almost as good.

One morning, while doing background research on the Juarez cartel, he encounters a particularly disturbing article. Later on, it will occur to him that it offers an effective way to strike at powerful members of the cartel, but right now, the only thing going through his mind is shock and disgust. "Jet?" he calls. "I think you'd better come and have a look at this."

Jet has been rather frustrated and her temper has gotten rather.. short. She comes in when called, but she grumbles, "What is it now?" Her restlessness comes through with every word and her posture makes it clear that she's anxious. When she starts to read, however, she grows very still, her breathing steady and her eyes narrowing. "I'm not waiting anymore," she says at last. "You just find the names for me. All of them."

The article - published in the United Kingdom, in a testimony to the increasingly global nature of the world - tells the sordid tale of one of the Juarez cartel's "recreations". It seems that Ciudad Juarez is subject to an unusually high number of abductions, rape, and killing of its young women; the local authorities have been ineffective in tracking down and imprisoning the men responsible. According to an El Paso journalist, this is because the criminals are, in fact, six powerful members of the cartels, using their underlings to carefully choose their victims - and their power to put themselves beyond the law.

Morgan nods grimly. "We'll start with Ms. Washington," he says, tapping the computer screen. "She can tell us where to begin - provided she believes we can be trusted."

"Make her trust us," answers Jet. "Or I'll have to use alternate means, and I'm not very patient right now." There's a different manner about the Lunar. Her emotions are shuffled away, bottled for use later. Or perhaps just being creatively redirected. Still, the wild danger around her is still more palpable than normal. "Let's do it."

Morgan nods, scratching his head. "Now... how do we get her to talk to us? I'm pretty sure I've seen her name before somewhere, so maybe she'll recognize mine." He chuckles. "Especially if she's read the Seattle Times lately. We reporters tend to pay attention when one of our colleagues goes missing."

"Once again, maybe straightforward is the right approach to take," muses Poe. "I can tell her I'm in the Witness Protection Program and investigating organized crime - which is true enough. She definitely wants these guys dealt with, I have no doubt - she just may be wary of who she gives the goods to. So far, she hasn't worried the cartels enough to kill her, but maybe that's because she hasn't passed the details to anyone who's a real threat to them." He grins broadly at Jet. "Yet."

Benford looks up from his laptop. "Ever consider the truth?"

Morgan blinks. "The _whole_ truth?" he asks, tapping his forehead.

"As much as she'll understand," the scientist replies. "Judging by the circles in which she moves, this may not be the first time she's encountered such."

Xin suggests, without really moving from where he's been reclining, "It is about as plausible as, 'My name is Poe. I'm hear to rescue you,' or something along those lines."

"Whatever it takes," says Jet. "I don't care. It's her giving us the names or me extracting them from the nobodies. That wastes time, and I'm too impatient to be very good with interrogation." That's read as torture in this context.

Poe stands up. "Then we should all go. The more she has to go on, the better." He nods to Benford. "I think you're right. She'll be a lot more inclined to believe that we _can_ deal with these scum if she knows what we're capable of. The FBI hasn't dealt with these men. We can."

"And this will help with the cartels and such... right?" Xin sits up.

"Well," Benford begins. "Nobody names names, but it seems a safe bet that these killers and the higher-ups in the cartel are the same people."

"When I'm done there may not be anyone in the cartels left," replies Jet flatly. "Or at least no one who wants to be." The smirk she wears mingles strangely with the promise of death in her eyes.

Morgan thinks for a moment. "Dealing with these men will leave a power vacuum. And unlike some of their colleagues, _these_ men are comparatively easy to find."

Benford folds his laptop. "Well. I had been searching for a more elegant solution. But that one will suffice. Shall we go visit Miss Washington?"

"No point waiting," replies Jet.

"Let's roll out," says Xin.

"We're solving a different problem today, Benford," Morgan says, pointing at the laptop screen. "I'm just glad it happens to bear on the one we already had."

---

There's just one problem: Diane Washington Valdez died in late 2006, just after giving an interview.

Despite this, Morgan is quite certain that she'll have left notes of some kind, and that traveling to El Paso is still worthwhile. This is less from any formal knowledge than from a "read" on a fellow reporter, and instinct that even death wouldn't let such a story go.

An hour or so of reading what little there is on the subject convinces him further that cause of death is "fell down some stairs, onto some bullets".

Benford considers this news. "That sounds like your story, Andrew. In fact... have you asked your 'source' who carried him previously?"

"She got too close after all," Poe mutters to himself. "Now I owe it to her to finish this. For her sake, as well as the other victims..." He blinks at Benford. "You... think she may have been one of us?"

"That's something to figure out later," replies Jet. "Right now our job is to make sure she didn't die in vain."

Benford shrugs. "Try asking him. It could be that this will be quite a short trip."

"It's worth a try," remarks Morgan, as he picks up his prepaid cell phone and dials his Social Security number.

The voice is brief and to the point. "You are my first Gaian incarnation, Mr. Morgan," it says. "But your reasoning was sound."

---

"Down in the West Texas town of El Paso, I fell in love with a Mexican gal..." The song on the radio is an oldie, and Marty Robbins' tale of true love and tragic death is a contrast to the spanish-language stations the group is able to receive. The tractor-trailer rig pulls into town and the Man hops out, explaining that he has some business to take care of. The others are on their own.

Xin and Jet, each in their own way, find nothing amiss around the place. It's been boarded up, and even after almost a year, the police tape still crosses the doors. Old wounds heal slowly in the South.

The Cooperstown neighborhood of El Paso isn't the most affluent, but it seems Miss Valdez did well enough for herself. The paint on the one-story California Rambler is in good shape, with new shingles and clean vynil siding. Only the police tape and dead brown lawn give any hint that something is amiss. Xin parks the 'borrowed' Bronco around the corner so the team can approach from the alley. The four exalts bear clipboards with a copy of the police report, and wear worn blue jumpsuits with an indistinct public works logo on the shoulder.

Houses in this part of the country rarely have basements. However, many have crawlspaces, and it's easy to locate an access panel secured only by a pair of cinderblocks. Benford nudges it with his boot. "Jet? Think you can make it?"

"Just say which door you want me to open for you," suggests Jet. There aren't many places she can't fit. The hole is not a large one, but a rattlesnake doesn't need much space, and so neither does she.

The back door is a sliding patio window, which has no lock save for a pole left in the runner. It proves no obstacle from the inside, even to a snake. Jet is easily able to nudge it out of place. A moment later, everyone is inside through a sliding patio window. With the door closed and the shades drawn behind them, everyone is free to examine the crime scene. Benford hands out rubber gloves and tyvec oversocks. "Let's try not to leave any extra evidence. We've been having enough trouble lately."

The first impression to the eye is: Wow, this place is a mess. Not a stick of furniture is left in its normal position; everything is overturned, spilled, or knocked over. The couch cushions are ripped, half the kitchen cabinets are dangling from one hinge or ripped off altogether... there's damage to almost everything. Whether the cartels' thugs were skilled at looking for hidden evidence or not, they were certainly determined.

Jet will have to go without gloves and socks, since she currently lacks hands and feet. She cannot 'smell' the notes, nor sense them with the formidible temperature sensory system of the rattlesnake. What she can do is see things from a perspective that no one else can. She first maps the house, gliding along its edges, looking for any slight imperfections in the wall, pressing against the baseboards to see if any might be loose. She even hisses at Poe until he pries open an air vent for her to slip into.

On the ground the world appears far different. Human eyes naturally look for things on their level, yet almost all hidden things are either above-which Jet cannot do much about-or below. Jet uses her own intuition, thinking of all the places you might hide something, especially if you had time to plan it, as this woman certainly did. Since she was not killed here, Jet imagines that hastily used hiding spots are not the best focus. This woman knew she was in danger and wasn't likely to risk the lives of others. It is almost certainly here.

As usual, Benford takes a systematic, scientific approach. The last 'visitors' made quite a mess, so he ignores the wreckage for now, looking for parts of the house that are still undisturbed. _Those who sow chaos often miss the hidden order..._

Xin stands around outside of the house for the time being. He walks around it, keeping his eyes out for people... or, come to think of it, other beings that might have an interest in the house. After a while, when he seems confident that nobody is on their way he checks in with the others. "Are you having any luck?"

Morgan's first approach is to try to think like her: _If I were Diane Washington, where would I hide my notes where the Juarez couldn't find them?_ It has to be someplace she _could_ get to if she needed it quickly, but which the cartels wouldn't think to check - so he rules out first what the cartels _would_ be able to check. In a safe? If they weren't able to take it away, they probably would've blasted it, although it can't hurt to check for one. Amidst other papers? They probably took or burned everything that had writing on it, just in case. So many possibilities... and yet there are some left over.

For example, there is even the possibility that the notes aren't even _here_ at all, exactly. Perhaps they are buried elsewhere... and what he is looking for is not a file folder full of papers or a CD-ROM, but a treasure map. He checks the walls, floors, and ceiling for suspicious-looking carvings, investigates any unbroken boards with hairline cracks. Unlike Benford, Poe _does_ check the savaged furniture, inspecting the kitchen table for hairline cracks, examining the linings of the furniture where it was not torn.

And when Morgan has checked everything he can think of, he returns to the spare room which Ms. Washington had used as an office, sits in the lotus position, and begins meditating as Xin taught him, clearing his mind and opening his self to the occult ebb and flow of this place - perhaps Xin would call it the _feng shui_. Once this is done, he begins his search anew, neglecting nothing, even if he had searched it once before - hoping that an exercise of willpower well outside his normal mode of investigation will help him think outside the box.

Morgan's intuition is correct. He goes back once again, finding a map of El Paso. Once again the song plays in his mind: "And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso; I can see Rosa's cantina below..." He studies the map carefully, finding hair-fine traces of pencil marks, noticing the faintest remnants of erasure around the mountainous area to the southwest of the city. He realizes that there are a series of caves there, and that Valdez has been studying the area quite intently. There's no other convenient routes to it, and he remembers no mention at all of the place in connection with drug-smuggling.

---

Back on the Mexican side, the group leaves the truck behind and makes its way into the hilly area. They tread carefully, hiking and watching the nearby roads for signs of observation. And they find the place Morgan discerned. Jet, still in snake form, can feel a source of heat emanating from within the rocks.

"It's a good place to hide things," Benford murmurs. "You'd need a sattelite to see anything. It might be volcanic... lots of old vents to hide undergound. This is going to be dangerous."

"So are we," says Morgan, nodding to the Chinese martial artist and shapeshifting snake.

Jet tilts her reptilian head up when Benford speaks and hisses. Dangerous? She is going to follow that heat source. To her, the terrain is not so formidible, her entire body forms her grip and the smallest holds are to her as big as ledges. She's not afraid.

Xin nods at Morgan. "Indeed. Let's be careful just the same... I have a funny feeling about all this."

With Jet and Morgan in the lead, the team approaches the narrow gully and threads their way under a spar of rock. They hear the guttering of the fire and smell the smoke before they see anything, but what awaits them inside is a largish cave, rough and ragged, with a cloaked figure sitting hunched over a campfire. Its hands are pale white, almost albino, and several opened tins of food are scattered around the cave floor.

Jet 'scents' the air with a few flicks of her tongue. With a warning rattle to those behind her she sweeps into the cave and coils herself up, raising her head to peer at this stranger. Though Jet has raised her rattle, she does not use it, just watching silently and tasting the air.

From behind the hood a pair of eyes gleam out, and the figure turns a bit. "Ha ha ha, little snake," comes a voice, a woman's, and beautiful but cold. "Thought you'd take me unawares, like that cop did, eh? Well, come warm yourself by the fire. Tell me your story too."

"Just normal caution, ma'am," says Morgan aloud, stepping from around the edge of the cave with his hands held prominently visible. "We weren't expecting company on this hike. But telling stories is my _job_... as is hearing them."

"Tell your friend to take human shape," the figure warns. "I don't like dealing with faces I can't see." In a gesture of reciprocity she draws back the hood of her cloak, revealing a pale white face, beautiful not in the way a woman is, but in the way a sculpture of ice could be.

Morgan grins. "I don't tell her anything. She decides for herself." He does nod toward Jet, though. This woman is no mortal - nor does she appear to be Assembled.

Jet answers with a soft hiss, then begins to make her shift, her body stretching and distorting impossibly until she is sitting by the fire. "All our questions meet at the same answer," she offers. "My name is Jet."

The woman rises, nodding politely. "My name was Diana Washington Valdez, which is no doubt the name you came here seeking. But now I'm caught at the moment of my own demise, so I ask that you call me by my chosen name. Santa Muerte. Saint Death, if you prefer."

"It is good that we finally meet, Santa Muerte," says Jet. "I think you can guess why we have come. You probably already know what it is we mean to do."

"The Star-man, the one who left me voice-mail earlier. He said you'd come to El Paso and wanted to meet." Saint Death gestures about her. "So here I am."

Morgan nods. "We did indeed come seeking the name Valdez. We _have_ heard word of your other name, but I must admit we did not expect to find it on _this_ search." He bows, and takes a seat as well. "My name is Andrew Morgan. And like Diana Washington Valdez, I too came to know too much - although the path from there has led me in a different direction, perhaps."

Xin steps in when violence doesn't become immediately apparent. He announces himself to Morgan as he approaches, and motions for Benford to follow along. There is a wary expression on his face... though all seems to be well for now.

Benford walks slowly towards the fire. "I think she knows all about that, Mister Morgan. She lived through it." There's something, not quite pity, in his voice, but it's not sympathy either.

"Sun, Moon, and Stars." Saint Death whispers the words. "Now I've met the three Celestial gods' chosen. I don't know if I am an aberration, but I have the same power. Regardless, I've learned that there is yet another power behind the Mexican drug families. If you're stopping them, I'll help you. But some of the families are under my protection - they've sworn peace with the people around them. That's all I care about."

"The Assembled, we call them," says Morgan. "They're using the cartels as a weapon against the Stars' chosen in San Francisco, and we came to Mexico to stop them. But I read the story of Valdez, and the rapes and murders she was investigating, and we thought that we could do something to help save the people of San Francisco and the women of Ciudad Juarez, both at once."

"Then you intend to kill the Juarez? And you will kill Ama Fuentes, for real?" Saint Death asks, eyes narrowed. "Good. This needs doing."

"I plan on killing everyone who is involved in those attacks," says Jet. She looks to Poe and the others, "I will not try to convince others to help me in this. If they wish, they may, but it is a butcher's job I mean to do."

Saint Death gathers her belongings: a crown of gold, a mask, and a scythe. She smiles at Jet, and in doing so proves that not all of her accoutrements are mundanely material, for she has visible fangs.

She also brings a large box full of the paperwork, research notes and other materials which Morgan sought, stored deeper into the cave. This she makes available to Morgan, to do with as he wishes.

Jet smiles back at Santa Muerte and offers a hand to this new ally. "You speak of having met us all. Perhaps as we travel you can tell me more about the others you have met. I have many questions, particularly about those you call star men. They seem unwilling to share much themselves."

"And we can fill you in on what we know of the Assembled," Benford adds, "the ones who are neither Sun, Moon or Stars... or ..." he trails off, and says little thereafter.

Xin stays near the entrance of the cave while Santa Muerte busies herself with the preparations for her departure. He nods, respectfully. "I'd just like to know what you know about the power behind all of these guys we're going to fight."

"We'll all speak as we go," the woman says. "But let's hurry."

---

A few hours later, Benford is back in the Wonderland trailer, working on the extensive collection of firearms, including his own Beretta. He recalls the conversation with his father earlier that year. _I asked him what it was like to work with killers. He asked me what it's like to be one. What am I doing?_

"What would you do, old man," Benford asks, wondering if Selber will hear him. "What have we done before? These men need to die. Do I need to do the killing?"

"We've fought, we've lost, we've usually won, and we've even sometimes regretted it," Selber says, turning one of the other guns over and over in his hand. He glances over at Benford, smiling.

"But if you ask 'do I need to do it', then you don't really _know_ if you need to, do you? If you knew, you'd either act, or refrain from acting."

"So how do you know if you must do something, eh?"

Benford considers this. "Well. Here's what I do know, then. I'll follow these people anywhere, and that's both fact and truth." He works the slide on his Beretta. "Wish me luck."

Selber nods. "And if anyone asks, 'who made you king, to pass justice', you point at the sun and say 'He did.' They may not believe you, but it doesn't make it any less true. You won't need luck to succeed, Newton. But you will need purpose. Go to it."

---

Before her hunt begins, Jet manages to slip in a moment alone with Poe. Her expression is serious, and strangely uncertain, as well. "When I go after them, I want you to stay behind." Before Poe can ask she raises a finger and lays it over his lips, kissing him softly as she draws away once more. "When you look at me now, I feel like a woman. I feel beautiful. If you saw what I am about to do, I'm afraid that look would be gone forever. I know it's selfish, but if I lose that look in your eyes a part of me that I need to survive is going to die."

Morgan squeezes Jet's hand. "The time may come when I _need_ to see the other side of you. But for now... let it be another day." And he leans forward to kiss her again.

"Men are going to die today. I understand you need to send a message. I'm going to help you send it, and I'm going to make sure that those who need it will know some measure of mercy tonight." There is something in the way Xin pronounces the word mercy that is very cold. "I'm ready."

The hunt is scheduled for the middle of the day. Jet's plan is simple. Get in and start killing. Stop killing when there's nothing left. She has taken point with a rather interesting approach. The others she directed to make sure no one gets out and to offer help as they see fit. The only real suggestion she has is to give her about ten minutes to get in and then do what they think is best. She never claimed to be a tactical expert.

The place is your traditional hang-out for rock star types, pimps, and drug lords. A huge pool, a collosal house, a high wall, a pair of guards with an IQ far higher than the movies ever give them credit for, and your usual compliment of groupies. Everything screams money here. Even the guards wear suits.

The first part of the plan is getting inside. One might expect Jet to use any of a dozen animal forms to get past security. In her mind, however, she has one that is truly ideal. Her own. She wears a full body suit that she picked-up at some random stop on the way. When the guards stop her, she answers their questions in spanish. When they demand to see her credentials for getting past them to the pool, she unzippers her suit, letting it fall from her shoulders.

The jaws of the guards drop at the same time as they stare at Jet. She steps out of her suit, utterly naked and barely even reacts as they sneak in a few sample touches before letting her slide past. Of course they need to pat down the naked woman for weapons, but only the big guys get to enjoy it all. She is far too used to uninvited groping to bother with it. It doesn't matter. Xin and Benford will kill these men in a few minutes.

Jet knows the scene. She's been close enough to it for a fair chunk of her life. Still, being completely naked does draw attention, and even in a place crowded with the sexiest girls they could find she stands out like a beacon. Jet moves past the girls here with practiced ease, heading towards the house. Once inside, she simply blends in, acting like she's been here before, giggling just as vapidly as the idiot girls. It will only register in her mind later that she's probably saved half of these fools.

The first man to die is just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He meets Jet when she's away from other eyes in an upstairs hallway. She playfully wraps herself around him, pressing against his back and starting to massage his neck. He doesn't have the time to make a sound as she snaps his neck. He's one of the lucky ones.

Jet stuffs the body in a closet and moves swiftly to the bedroom. She knows she has only a few minutes before it really starts. No time for pretty play. She slips into a bedroom and finds her next target.

A middle-aged Mexican man that Jet recognizes as Pedro Valasquez is standing over a bound and gagged girl. He holds a knife in his right hand. When the door opens he looks over with a wicked grin and rushes for Jet. "So Pablo sent me another!" he says with a dark smirk.

That smirk will be on his face for a long time. The serpent in Jet guides her past the knife and she throws herself around his back. She does not crush the breath from him. He's not that lucky. Instead she wraps her arms around him, turning her fingers in like knives and stabbing them into his body, rending through his flesh. She curls her fingers inside the cavity of his chest and with a roar flexes her arms, taking hold of his ribs from the inside and ripping them apart. His screaming is far too loud to be missed, no matter how brief.

The first hint that something is wrong is invisible, a ripple that passes through the guards, the Armani-wearing sides of beef that weren't expecting anything trickier tonight than a crooked cop mouthing off. Screams and static mix in their earpieces, and they barely notice three more figures approaching the front gate until they are only a few feet away: an asian man, a dark-haired anglo, and a remarkably pale woman. One of the guards stuffs his hand inside his jacket and shouts, 'Quienes son usted? Que esta sucediendo?' _Who are you? What's happening?_

The guards demand answers from the trio that is slowly advancing. Xin steps towards the two men and tosses open his coat, revealing enough guns to start a branch of the NRA. A look of disbelief comes over the guards, who temporarily forget their guns. This can't be happening. "Mierda santa!" _Holy shit_ They draw their guns, but by now are much too late. The trio is already in action. The sound of two gunshots echoes across the villa. Saint Death has arrived, and has brought her demons with her.

Benford follows in the wake of the pale woman. It's the first time he shoots another human being; he doesn't think it's lethal... but he remembers the notes in Valdez's files; the police photos of the mutilated women... hundreds of them... and he adjusts his aim. _Sow as you've reaped._ He pulls the radio off the guard and puts it on. The revellers haven't got the hint yet, but by now every shooter in the place is aware that something is wrong; the airwaves are alive with increasingly panicked shouting.

Inside the house, the hunt continues. Jet barely has time to drag the bound girl she rescued towards the closet and the door flies open. For a moment, the large man who enters seems totally shocked, then he moves forward with a furious expression. Despite the evidence in front of him, he still sees a woman to fight. The man is fast enough, for a mortal, but Jet is far stronger and far faster. The ram guides her with the first punch, and rather than dodge the blow she throws herself into it, slamming the strongest part of her skull against the weakest part of his hand, breaking three of his fingers.

Jet feels a steady heat building in her and rather than fight it, she feeds into it everything she can. She thinks of Ana, hurt and violated by men like this, and all the helpless girls these pieces of shit have hurt and killed. The rage feeds the Full Moon, it brings out the tiger in her. Jet's mind goes rather blank as she loses track of her own motions. One moment she sees the man stagger back with broken fingers. The next moment she's clutching something soft and wet and staring at a steel pole covered in blood and huge dents. Jet looks down and lets go of the crushed remains of the man's head. "Fixer. Guess I broke you."

He's not the last. Jet is a veritable buzzsaw in the house. Guns and fists, neither slow her down. She moves room to room leaving a trail that will make a legend of merciless vengeance. Some names she knows, others she does not. A strange man she finds raping a girl has his fingers bitten off before Jet tears his eyes out and crushes his skull under her heels. Phillipe 'Fast Eddy' Montoya rushes her with a gun before she leaves that room, stupidly getting close before opening fire. Outside the sound of gunshots and screams is clear as Jet gets the gun away and begins putting holes in him at his feet, working her way up.

A poseur named Diablo runs into Jet on the stairs. Jet heard from Santa Muerte how this man liked to bite others and has been looking forward to meeting him. She slams him into the wall and with a swift uppercut drives her fingers through the bottom of his mouth. With her eyes locked on his she rips her hand free, bringing his entire jaw bone with it. She spits in his mangled face and lets him fall away to bleed to death. By now she looks like Death itself, a little of her own blood mingling with nothing short of a bathload of it from her victims.

Out in the yard, the party is very much over. Saint Death leads, her scythe moving in arcs too fast for the eye to follow, but not in a random swirl. It's precise. Definite. Final. Behind her, the two Solars follow, alternately sweeping out followers in Saint Death's blind spots and shooting out the floodlights that illuminate the broad, manicured lawn. Dozens of people are fleeing for the gates, but these are not of concern. The trio circles from one end of the yard to the other, less so to secure the perimeter than to scorch the earth beneath it.

Those in front of Saint Death fall to the ground, in pieces. Her scythe now traces crimson lines through the air as she cuts down the tide of advancing guards. She doesn't even move out of the way or take cover. For her, the legend of Saint Death is enough, no bullet can touch her. Xin, on the other hand, dives behind a rather solid square of stone benches as the ground erupts in a broken line behind him. Bullets tear into the stone, sending chunks of it flying. Several other guards come around the corner, loaded for bear. Submachine guns or heavier rest in their arms. Bullets fly everywhere, as the guards start emptying their clips. They move their weapons in broad, sweeping arcs, laying down covering fire while two of their comrades start setting up heavier weapons.

Benford says, "As his dad said. 'What's it like to be one?'"

Benford takes cover beside Xin and hands him a sack full of small devices - chunks of C4 wrapped in piano wire and ball bearings. "Party favors for the heavy mob. Batter up."

It seems for now, that the trio of Exalts are pinned down. Even Saint Death has taken refuge behind a steadily crumbling piece of cover near the front of the villa. "Dr. Benford... I hope you can throw..." Then comes the brief pause as a few of the guards start to reload. Before their spent clips can hit the ground, Xin is moving. He dashes across the yard, submachine guns in either hand, spraying bullets as he vaults away from Benford. As Xin runs, the guards train their fire on him, bullets fly in his direction, and he's even caught the attention of another machine gunner. He runs straight at one of the guards. Twice, the guard swears he hit the runner. He saw the bullets catch him right in the chest... but he didn't even notice. "Madre de Dios..." and then mercifully, he is knocked cold with a well placed kick. "About now, would be good, Doc," shouts Xin.

With most of the party guests running, there's less of a chance of injuring one with heavy weapons. Benford doubts that the shooters care; they're probably from the army and would know how to pick their targets. On the other hand, they aren't expecting explosives. He pulls one of the bombs from the bag. The world slows as he holds down a red switch, visualizing the arc of the device like the red blur of Saint Death's scythe. In a smooth motion he stands, throws, and ducks. Repeats twice. Seven seconds later... a string of three explosions, screams, and sickly wet noises from the machine gun teams.

At this point, the use of guns has fallen by the wayside. The trio is much too close and the remaining guards rush in, hoping for an easy kill. No less than four of them learned too late that Saint Death's scythe is much faster than their aim. There is a wary circle around her. Xin and Benford on the other hand, are back to back. Xin fights with Benford's safety in mind. Whenever one goon might land a blow on the good doctor, he'll find that another goon has suddenly come between him and his target. Or, one of the cartel members will suddenly realize the doctor has been pushed to one side, and an angry martial artist has just kicked him.

Inside Jet's still looking for someone. She hasn't found the one she's wanted to run into the most. Still, Santa Muerte gave her enough hints of his M.O. to know just where to find him. Downstairs. Sure enough, after a bit of hunting around and some rather idle distractions Jet is able to find a thick door. It's not locked. She finds a girl being tortured by Enrique Juarez. He's far older than most in the house, being in his sixties. If anything, age and power have made him more demented than his younger counterparts. He is, in Jet's mind, the source of this disease.

Jet can't think of a good way to deal with a man like this, so she buys herself some time by breaking his arms and legs. The injured girl is cradled in one arm and the screaming old man is dragged carelessly along. Jet makes a point of letting him smash against the stairs as much as possible. Her path leads her towards the pool. She hears a lot of noise out there by now. With careless ease she whips the body of Enrique through the glass patio door, then she sets the girl down. She presses a soft kiss to the young woman's forehead and smiles at her. She whispers, "Rest now. These men are going away forever."

Jet moves out to the pool and in the midst of the chaos lashes out, slamming her fist into the kidney of the Chief of Police as he races by. "You are about to fall off the payroll, Bobby," whispers Jet. The man gropes about for the gun he was carrying only to have Jet lift him by the throat. She locks eyes with him and growls, "You _are_ going to die, Bobby." As he struggles against Jet's grip he catches sight of Diablo's body inside the house. "Yes, I think you see it now. But I will give you a choice..."

Whatever the choices are, it clearly takes some extra persuasion. The Chief of Police proves that he has one hell of a set of lungs on him during that persuasive process. Nonetheless, the only shot Bobby will squeeze off tonight sends a bullet through his skull under Jet's vindictive gaze. "Ain't karma a motherfucker," whispers Jet.

Jet's last act of violence for the night is to finish her work by kicking Enrique's body into the deep end of the pool. She leaps in herself as well, staining the water red. She says to Enrique casually as she bathes, "I hope you enjoy your swim, papi. Not sure you'll do so well without working arms and legs.. Hmm, let me help you along." Jet rolls him over, so that he is face down in the water. She barely pays attention to his sputtering and useless struggling as she slips out of the pool again. "Ciao, papi."

Jet's carnage hasn't gone unnoticed, even at the far end of the yard. The radio network is full of noise, screams, and confusion, but one message comes across loud and clear - the boss is dead, and nobody is giving orders anymore. Men who were loyal retainers just fifteen minutes before are running for their lives; some are fighting each other to loot the manor, steal getaway cars, grab for power. Even the disciplined soldiers are withdrawing in the face of such horrific losses; three of their number are dead or dying from the grenades; more than a dozen have been vivisected by Saint Death. Suddenly, the gunshots stop, and the screams diminish to moans. The air stinks of gunsmoke and fire; blood and shit... and there's nobody left to kill.

With all this madness, Jet's concern turns to the girls. Even with some of them seeing what she's done the raw animal magnetism and nearly divine beauty of the Lunar earns their trust swiftly. She has them gather up their clothes and come with her. She leads nothing short of a parade of beautiful young women out the front door. The girl who was bound upstairs leans against Jet's side and the tortured girl from the basement Jet carries in her arms. The Lunar's words are gentle, confident. She wants these girls to feel safe. No one is stupid enough to get in her way.

While Jet rescues the only innocent people on the property, Benford gathers intelligence - hard drives from the computers in the house. The cartels can afford good security, but their success has made them lazy; cabinets are unlocked and files left unencrypted. Perhaps they'll be leads to their Assembled backers; there will certainly be enough for Ricky to pursue his crusade.

With Benford and Jet busy, it falls to Xin to gather the weapons. As he does, he speaks with Saint Death, complimenting her prowess in the combat. It was unusual, but informative and a beautiful if deadly thing to watch. Once Benford and Jet have finished saving what they can, they leave. Their vehicle's not too far off. As they leave the bodies and distant sirens, Xin does his best to take stock of the wounded. They have done it. Ciudad Juarez is dealt with. Fuentes remains... but that will soon be changing.

Jet is eeriely silent after she's assured herself that the girls will help get each other to safety and have confirmed that everyone it out of the house safely. Well, at least all the people she cares about getting out are free, anyway. The Full Moon's restlessness is replaced with a listless stillness. She is at least awake enough to get herself partially dressed.

Whatever is wrong with Jet doesn't find relief on the ride. She is only dimly aware of her surroundings. Even for her this was too much. She pushed herself too far and is reeling from the shock of it. Only when she returns to Poe does she finally show some interest in the world again. The reporter finds himself with his arms full as Jet hugs him tightly, pressing her face to his chest. For a moment, she struggles, but she knows what she has to do. It takes more courage than anything else she's done today. She lets herself find release in a stream of tears and choked-off sobs.

Morgan can only hold the Lunar tight, stroking her hair. He can only imagine what must have happened at that mansion - and perhaps he shouldn't even try. He murmurs soothingly to her, without words; for once, even he cannot imagine what words could help. He only knows that he must be there for her, and help remind her that, after dealing with monsters on their own terms, nevertheless she is still human.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico - Gangland violence erupted south of the border, turning a private party in the tony Zona Dorada neighborhood into a scene of horrific gunfire and carnage. Chief of police Ramon Rodriguez Perrea was among the dead, as well as several other prominent Ciudad Juarez figures and their bodyguards.

"I've never seen anything like it in my life," said coroner Silvia Perez. "These men were just mangled... torn apart... like some kind of wild animal. It was horrible."

The survivors of the brutal killing spree told conflicting accounts of the battle, leaving the identity of the assailants largely a mystery. When asked about rumors that the mansion was owned by a major drug kingpin, or that several of the female survivors spoke of being 'rescued', police refused to comment.
