# Fall of Eden 2006-12-29

Benford is staring at a series of Hummer components, sprawled out over the workbench in the back of the trailer. It's still mid-December, and it's still cool. The snow from before has finished melting in the Texas heat. But right now, at dusk, the wind carries hints of that same chill.

The disassembled Humvee was scavenged for parts by the power of the Assembled. Now a good portion of those parts are intact on the workbench, albeit with the occasional bullet hole or crossbow impact. Nothing seems out of place; they would be no less remarkable if a mechanic had simply torn into the vehicle. There are faint traces of lingering Essence which Benford discerned through handling the pieces, but that is all.

The "unifying soul" of the Assembled seems long gone, and when it departed, it seemingly reverted its body back to its component parts.

Benford worriedly sifts through the 'remains' of the Assembled warrior, muttering into a voice recorder in the tradition of pathologists everywhere. "The components remaining from the 'death' of the specimen are identical to those from a production-model Hummer down to the last nut and bolt, and yet the being had clearly anthropomorphized and had features comparable to a human being of approximate size. It's unclear how a random assemblage of parts could provide that range of motion." He picks up a component, the universal joint from the rear axle. "Further, the removal of some of these parts from the 'donor vehicle' without machine tools seems to be impossible. Some pieces of the fuel delivery system were found in the remains, even though the seals on the engine block are intact."

Benford shuffles a pile of inkjet prints from the Hummer's reference CD, comparing outlines with pieces of the wreckage. "It seems that the host mechanism reverts to its original form when the being is... disrupted, I suppose. That might explain why the remains of Mister Bland were such a random assortment of materials - in the absence of their vital force, the bodies are just piles of junk. Hypothesis: these beings aren't just made from machines, they exploit the ontological concept of mechanism in a way we as yet don't understand. While the notion is incompatible with traditional conceptions of physics and thermodynamics - there's no reason, for example, that the metals in a vehicle should be preferable to a seam of iron ore - it is consistent with our observations of Essence phenomena to date." He switches off the recorder and sighs. "It's almost enough to make someone believe in God."

"Almost?" asks Jet. She has a way of showing up with little warning. When Beford is as focused as he has been, it's not saying much that she can sneak up on him. "So the power you have been granted still isn't enough to deserve your faith? And here I thought I was the one with dubious spirituality."

"The power isn't that subtle," Benford says. "Something that has been proven beyond doubt demands little faith." He shrugs. "The problem for me is the way it obeys us. To an atom, there is no such thing as the 'idea' of a machine, or even a human being. And yet..." He motions across the workbench. "It seems the only thing motivating this fellow was an idea. Where does that leave me, as a scientist?"

"I always thought ideas were the most powerful force in the world," replies Jet. "Aren't we surrounded by things that science knows is impossible? Like a man who just starts walking when he's given up for dead, one who can perform calculations in his head that computers can't even grasp."

Benford says, "Perhaps. It took science nearly a hundred years to learn to have some humility about such things. Of course, it took religion a lot longer than that." He grins, but is serious again quickly. "For me, though... I need to believe that these things obey some physical laws, even if they aren't the ones I've already studied. If it can be measured and predicted, it can be controlled... or at least contained. Our survival depends on that."

"Perhaps the problem is just that. They don't obey physical laws." Jet looks over the parts for a moment, then focuses on Benford again, "What happened to us was not only a physical change. There are laws, just none that any scientists ever had to confront. Until now."

Benford glances at Jet's hand, still frozen in the shape of a tiger's paw. "I'm also worried that if I can't work those laws out, I'll be failing you," he admits.

Jet laughs softly. She holds up that paw and says, "This is my guide to figuring out the laws for myself," she replies. "I will find a way. What's more important is to get things handled here so my family is safe again. I couldn't care less about the whole crime front. It's about having our home back. It's being together that really matters to me." She leans over to pluck at a bit of the debris, "What we do know is that these things can appear just about anywhere there is technology. We have seen that having no working technology forms something of a barrier. We know that even though we don't damage the parts, we can drive whatever animates these things away with physical attacks."

Benford nods. "We can probably get the Hummer running again, with a few hours's work... although I think I'm taking a risk, using the same laptop that Axel infiltrated in Walla Walla. But that brings up something else. The Assembled appear to be factional. Gerhard very clearly indicated that his plan wasn't completely in harmony with Axel's." He taps his chin with the recorder. "Some computer programs simulate evolution. They're used in certain design problems, to find ways to improve machines and programs that aren't obvious in ordinary design. I wonder if the're a competition going on between the Assembled... and if so, what problem they're trying to solve. Axel indicated that it might have something to do with self-determination."

"Whose self-determination?" asks Jet. "You know, just because they aren't in harmony doesn't mean they are directly opposing each other. They might just be competing for resources. It could be even more odd than that." She shrugs and admits, "These things are pretty weird to deal with. They are very robotic and I wonder if they can do anything illogical."

Benford says, "Illogical, probably not, but irrational, perhaps. There are truths known to humans that the Assembled aren't equipped to grasp. That's why they carry the symbionts. Speaking of which..." he grins. "I've got an extra voice in my head now. That makes three, if you count my own."

"I'm not sure if I should congratulate you on that one," replies Jet. "Though it does put this firmly into the category of 'conversations I never thought I'd be having.'" She frowns and asks a bit too casually, "Do you know if those things are messing with you somehow? Is that something you've checked out?"

Benford is silent for a few long moments. "I don't think so... Poe's behavior didn't change when he inherited Eddy. They seem to forget everything when they bond to a new host. That works for us and against us; they don't seem to have any orders to cause us trouble, but then, they don't know much about the Assembled except in general terms. If you're worried, though, I wouldn't stand to close to a dying Assembled. That's the only time we seem to pick them up."

_You aren't 'messing with me', are you, Hypatia?_ Benford asks his symbiont. _I don't mean to offend you. I'm sorry to even ask._

Jet looks at Benford strangely for a moment and says, "Well, if it could happen to me, it could happen to any of us, right?" Her eyes shift to Beford's arm then, and without any warning she lashes out, her eyes narrowed as she sees something there that she had never noticed before.

Jet's claws rake through Benford's skin, though it doesn't hurt. She tears back a long, pulsing strip of flesh, and Benford sees that beneath it, what he'd assumed and felt as human flesh is being subsumed by steel cabling and fiber-optic channels. Skeletal chrome struts are replacing his bone. He can see the process happening before his very eyes.

Jet recoils in horror. She looks from the wound to Benford's face. "Oh my god! Wha.. what the fuck!?" For the first time since her change, she feels faint, her legs holding her up without much assistance from her right now. "What did they do to you!"

Benford holds his arm in front of him, the recorder tumbling from his suddenly limp grasp. _No pain... there should be pain..._ His face is a mask of astonishment, and it's only sheer surprise that keeps him from screaming. "How... when..." he stumbles to the workbench and picks up a scalpel, and cuts across the palm of his other hand.

Motor oil and lubricant pour out of the gash that Benford made. All he can do is stare in disbelief and horror.

---

Unable to resist the horror any further, Benford tries to scream, but discovers that his throat doesn't work anymore; something is wrong... finally, he jolts upright, back arched, arms flailing, and howls, falling over forwards, onto his face... realizing, startled, that he's fallen off the sofa in a tangle of blankets. He's uninjured, and alone in the truck's lounge. He staggers to his feet, panting, his throat raw. _A dream... or was it?_ He stumbles to the workbench and picks up a scalpel, the same one he used in the dream. It is shiny and clean, unmarred by either blood or oil. The scientist stands frozen, the blade barely touching the skin of his palm, afraid to move.

The memories are there. Jet's conversation, and his responses, really happened. But the .. transformation .. that was very much nightmare. And to underscore this point, Benford sees Selber leaning against the wall, watching him and eyeing the scalpel.

Benford carefully sets the bladed tool back on the bench, steadying himself with both hands, staring back at Selber. "Was that a warning? And from whom?"

"It was a lesson. From me." The traveler pushes himself off the wall and gestures around, indicating the trailer. "I am going to teach you about Essence, and science. And I will teach you how to solve Jet's dilemma too."

Benford watches carefully, anything to take his mind off the nightmare.

"You're familiar with the brain-in-a-vat theory, I assume." Selber's choice of words is a jest; he's indicated before that he knows what Benford knows. "A brain held in suspension and kept alive artificially, stimulated by a computer or some similar agency. Can you defend the existence of science in such a scenario, from the perspective of that brain?"

Benford says, "Barely," Benford says, his voice still quavering. "We assume that there are natural laws because the world seems very consistent. If the vat's program was consistent, we might fool ourselves into thinking we understand it. If the program were completely unpredictable, science would be a joke." He draws a deep breath, lets it out slowly. "You're saying that we're like the brain in a vat, that we only think we understand the rules because nobody's changed them on us lately?"

Selber nods. "Mortal man is like a brain a vat. Souls are given flesh, incarnated into bodies, and live out their lives in some world or another. Here, they live as Gaia dictates. In Creation, it was... different. But they are the same in that there is something which dictates the tapestry of existence. You call it physical law. In Creation, we called it the Loom of Fate."

Benford nods. "So are we losing rules? Or just losing an illusion thereof? And does Gaia a willing party, or is this being forced on us?"

"Your damaged Hummer represents an intersection of the law of Gaia with the law of the Assembled. In their existence, it is possible to turn a military jeep into a humanoid robot. They used Essence to make it so, just as this world uses Essence to give you the perception of tables and chairs, blood and cells, biology and chemistry, and so forth. You've never seen atoms but you presume they exist. But how do you _know_? Well, because you conclude that they must based on observation. And you could say, 'we have seen atoms through electron microscopes'. But haven't you only seen what an electron microscope would show if atoms were real?"

Benford says, "Maybe... but if that's true... if the world conspires to behave exactly as if a thing is real, is there any difference? No, don't answer. I know the answer. Reality isn't the atoms, illusory or not. Reality is the Essence, and whoever is choosing the rules for it. So is Jet's dilemma the same? She's living halfway in and halfway out of a world where she's completely given over to her animal nature?"

"Jet's dilemma is that her animal nature is seeking balance with her human nature. You are similar." Selber gives a quirky smile, gesturing around at the tools and instruments. "You want science to work, but you are only considering a small fraction of what science can be used for. You want atoms and quarks, not Essence." He watches Benford for a few moments. "There is one way out of the brain-in-a-vat scenario. A way to prove you're a brain or not, when all your normal senses are suborned. Can you guess what it is?"

Benford says, "The best Descartes could do, was assume the existence of God, and then try to prove it logically. But such things are beyond logic." He shakes his head. "Jet asked me if the Assembled are capable of an illogical act. She should have asked if I was capable of doing so."

Selber nods. "Consider a hypothetical alien race with a sixth sense. Their observations would be more capable than your own. They would accept conjectures as provable that you would consider fanciful. And yet they are still capable of the principles of science - observation and evaluation. Yes?"

Benford says, "So as humanity sees truths to which the Assembled are blind... the Exalted see truths to which mortals are blind?"

Selber nods. "Just so. A brain with the ability to sense the vat, the laboratory, the computer, and more has the power to see past the perceptions it is being fed. You have such a gift. Do you understand?"

"Only in theory," Benford admits. "Practice isn't the same. Not yet, anyway."

"Practice makes perfect. Get to it." And Selber is gone.

Benford waits until the adrenaline has bruned out of his system. _Enough rationale and rationalization for now. Time to do something._ He puts on a pot of coffee, and waits for Jet's keen nose to detect it.

---

Jet never sleeps well. She's just grown accustomed to being tormented by dreams. The coffee isn't what draws her out, though she does come. The thought that someone might be awake is what really matters. She stares at the coffee for some time before she actually says anything. "Nice night, huh?" she whispers.

Benford pours two mugs. "I had a nightmare," he says simply. "And I don't want to be alone right now."

"We gonna start a support group?" asks Jet. She throws herself down on the floor, blinking tiredly. "I'm not sure what a night of sleep is like anymore. Nothing you want to share, I imagine?" She shivers a bit, "You probably don't want to know what I dream, or you might get even worse nightmares."

Morgan is also drawn by the smell of coffee - although, for him, it is also as much that coffee requires a coffee maker. "I haven't dared ask myself yet, either," he admits, having caught Jet's last remark.

"I dreamt that I was turning into a robot," Benford mutters. He points at the scrapheap on the workbench. "One of them. The worst part is, I can see how it's true, and it's almost as bad as if it were literal."

Jet frowns thoughtfully at this, though she doesn't say anything right away. "You aren't messing with me, are you?" she asks abruptly. "I don't think I was talking in my sleep, anyway.." She looks from Morgan to Benford, "I attacked you, didn't I?"

It takes a moment for Benford to understand. "You did," he blurts. "She did," he repeats to Morgan. "We had the same dream. Did we all have it?"

Morgan shakes his head. "Not me. I guess I didn't join _that_ meeting."

"You are probably better off," says Jet. She hugs her legs to her chest, that paw-like hand sticking out jarringly. "It was a pretty bad one. I was terrified, because it was something that seems possible." She looks a bit wary as she asks, "Have you.. you know... tested? To see if you feel things, I mean."

Benford simply holds out his arm. "I haven't. I have faith. But if you think a test is necessary..." he trails off almost to a whisper. "Just be gentle."

Jet looks at Benford's arm for a moment and shakes her head. "You have faith, that's something no machine ever could do." She lids her eyes slowly and sighs. "Something must have happened after the nightmare ended to help that along."

Benford takes a sip from his coffee. "I had a chat with one of the voices in my head," he admits sheepishly. "He taught me something about the nature of reality. He also said that my problem is like your problem. I'm trying to reconile what I thought I knew about Science with what I now know about Essence, and I'm not doing it very well... at least not yet. He said that it's like your paw... trying to reconcile the tiger with the woman."

Jet frowns at the mention of what she is trying to do. "I'm hoping your efforts go a lot better than mine." She isn't sure she's convined what it even means yet. "All I've got to show for things is an ugly disability."

Morgan scratches his head. "There must be a connection there, if you two shared the same dream. No physical connection, but one of... Essence, I guess." He looks at Benford. "I think that _does_ mean that you have the key to Jet's problem, somehow." He stares at his coffee cup. "I used to think that dreams are a manifestation of the subconscious. That still may be true, but maybe I don't understand what subconscious _means_ as well as I thought I did."

Benford says, "Nor do I understand energy or matter as well as I thought I did. Speaking of which... when was the last time it snowed in Jaurez? I think there's more disturbances in the Essence than just our dreams tonight."

Morgan tilts his head. "Maybe Essence has weather fronts of its own?" He shifts into a weather-reporter tone of voice. "A high Essence front will be moving in tonight, bringing with it scattered transfigurations, shared dreams, oh, and a bit of snow too."

Morgan smiles a little, and sips his coffee. By the time the cup leaves his face, his expression is serious again. "And then again, the 'weather' could be us. Maybe just having so many Exalts in one place, all by itself, has an effect on the world."

Benford says, "Should we check it out? Or should we chalk it up to mundane causes like global warming?"

"I have my doubts that we do anything to weather," says Jet. "At least not by sheer proximity." She looks to Newton, "You are the scientist, you tell us."

"Suppose I should have seen that coming," Benford says, and moves away to his laptop. The trailer's antenna is pirating off an open access point in a Mexican government building, at at this time of night, few beauracrats are awake to put a strain on the network. It's the work of a few moments to copy a small mountain of weather radar histories from local airports. Benford settles in and checks it against historical trends and sattelite photos. While nobody can reliably predict the weather more than three days in advance, it's a simple matter to find any anomolies in retrospect, and simpler still when the program is written by a Twilight Caste scientist.

The data are easy enough to obtain, and though Benford is no meteorologist, he is a world-class statistician. He finds himself amazed at the ease with which he generalizes his existing knowledge and applies it to the new field he's faced with, but at the same time he's aware of a strange feeling. It's the feeling of _rightness_, the "flow" of genius that he's recognized in himself at intervals in the past. Now, rather than a brief moment of brilliance, he feels himself pulled into a raging river of creativity. The decoding of the weather data is child's play.

Temperature, wind direction, and more all spell out the same story: a sudden drop in temperature between ten and thirty thousand feet over the Rio Grande, following a shift in the high-altitude wind currents over the Gulf of Mexico. The upper atmosphere was gravid with precipitation and when the cold winds came, water simply did what it does when falling frozen: it turned into snow.

Benford shuts down the program and shrugs. "Well, whatever the Assembled are up to, they aren't trying to kill us with a cold snap. I think it was a natural phenomenon, probably only happens one day in ten thousand." He goes back to the pile of spare parts on the workbench. "I'm going to see what I can do with the Hummer before Myer finds out it's broken. And then we need some new leads."

Jet looks about ready to doze off, but forces herself to her feet. "I'm going to go for a walk, I guess." She would be quite happy to never have to sleep again, by the look of it. "I've had enough thinking for a few lifetimes already."
