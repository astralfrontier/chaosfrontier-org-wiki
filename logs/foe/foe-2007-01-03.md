# Fall of Eden 2007-01-03

East of the Sea of Cortez (what the white men call the Pacific Ocean) is the state of Sinaloa. It is better-known to American college kids as the home of Mazatlan. In Sinaloa, people still play a ritual ball-game held over from the times of the Teotihuacan and the Mayas, called _Ulama_.

The Aztecs played this game with their prisoners of war, decapitating the losers for mythical and religious reasons, similar to the Roman practices in the collosseum. These days there is no bloodshed, only sportsmanship and a remembrance of culture. It is an important part of the history of Mexico, and the people of Sinaloa are always ready to honor their history, however questionable it may be.

A perfect example of this tendency is the "bandit saint" Jesus Malverde. He is called "the Angel of the Poor", "the Generous Bandit", and other names. A shrine was erected in his honor in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa. People leave letters saying "thank you Malverde for saving me from drugs", "thank you Malverde for not having to lose my arm and leg", and similar simple words of appreciation from the common folk. He is a folk hero, though it may surprise some to learn he is also the "Narco Saint", the patron saint for the region's drug smugglers.

This is the paradox of Mexico: life and death, honor and lawlessness, virtue and vice. A bandit is canonized by the people who pray to Jesus, the selfless savior of the Christian faith, and this is natural to the people of Central America.

The breath off the Gulf of Mexico comes in cooler gasps this time of the year, bearing with it stories from all around the world. These tales of joy and despair wash over the snow white fur of a great tiger who nearly glows in the light of the moon. Her eyes are bright as she looks out to the east, waiting for the sunset she was promised.

Among the wonders of the sky and sea, such a vision as a wild tiger in Mexico might seem almost beneath notice, but her journey is far more remarkable than rumors might guess. It is no less immaculate than the tales of Jesus Malverde.

It was early morning in Guaymas and the streets were just starting to grow loud with the waking of men. The profile of a rich man's car was left behind, as was the form of a confused young woman. The white tiger roamed the city, following the borrowed light of the sun and weaving through streets as easily as a native. In her sharp ears the sad tale of a young man driven to steal to survive unfolds.

The white tiger does not only hear the tale, nor simply share the tears of the young man as he despairs in the backseat of a Jura's car. She does not judge with any law of men, but relies on the scales of her heart to know what is right. This natural righteousness is embraced by the tiger as the true way. The woman inside the tiger still must learn.

Still, there is a hope in her, and it comes from strange words, like poems and visions, given to her by a friend. In setting things right the young woman will learn that she must stop trying to be someone and be who she is.

Like many living Jura, the man who sits in the front of the car is simply trying to survive, to profit in a world full of men who are celebrated criminals that he must hunt at the orders of dishonest men who hold power. All this the white tiger sees and simply knows. She who strains her eyes hard enough shall only see what she strains to see and never what is. The wise look at the world and see the world as it is. They want to see nothing; they can never be deceived.

The white tiger settles her great weight on the roof of a home above as the Jura steps outside his vehicle. A cautious man, he locks his door. Still, he does not think to lock the rear doors. Like a whisper the white tiger descends, patiently taking hold of the door of the car and opening it. The young man, too stunned to speak, simply sits there, stunned by the vision before him. The moon makes the white tiger look more like a ghost than a normal animal, and her eyes are too knowing for any beast.

She stares at the young man, then turns away, cocking an ear. With him delaying as he does, she growls softly, looking back and flattening her ears. It seems to get the point across. The young man squirms out of the car, limited as he is by the strength of his handcuffs. He is in unfamiliar territory, and does the only natural thing, as mad as it might seem. He follows the white tiger through the streets.

The white tiger's eyes are turned back to watch the young man many times. The path is a very twisting one, and even if the young man knew this part of the city well he would probably be hopelessly lost.

The walking ends in a dark alley and the tiger turns to walk around the young man. When he keeps turning to face her she lets out an annoyed rumbling and with a sway of her body she sends him stumbling against a wall. In the twinkling of an eye the tiger is gone, and the handcuffs come undone with a click. "Don't get caught next time," says a confident, warm voice. In the blink of an eye the young woman is gone, leaving only the briefest glimpse as the young man spins to see her. "Wait! Wait!" he calls out loudly. It is no use. She is gone. Stunned and joyous and lost, the young man wanders after her, finding himself left only a short distance from his home. He bends down to pick up a tight roll of money left on the ground, more money than he's ever held at one time.

He looks around for a moment, trying to catch some glimpse of the tiger or the woman. Finally, on the rooftops he sees the profile of a great cat projected on the perfect disc of the moon. It lingers there for a moment and then is gone.

The nights in Torreon have been troubled as late, and Pedro Moreno has not had the luxury of sleep. For the past month this proud man's livelihood has been taken bit by bit from him. At least three head of cattle have been lost every day and he means to put an end to it. The rifle he has at his side is old, like him, but it still fires true.

Of his children only his youngest son and daughter remain. Their brothers and sisters have gone to work in the city. The two who stayed behind are too young to deal with thieves. Still, they sit with their father, waiting as well. The boy has been given his own rifle, which he holds in excited hands. His fear is a light scent in the wind.

The men who have been robbing Senor Moreno are armed better than he is, and they have managed to thwart him at every turn. He is a farmer, not a hunter. Tonight, the soft prayers he whispers when his children sleep does not go unheeded.

In the deepening darkness the white tiger roams, like something out of a dream she creeps over grass covered in silvery dew. Her nose sees the men she has come to stop. They are creatures of habit, and though they are clever, it is only the wisdom of fools that they know. They do not see that only those who want nothing can be at peace. The would laugh at those who tell them only those who give away all the have are rich.

The tiger says nothing. This night, she hunts. She counts their numbers twice with her ears, and she sees their mind in her eyes. The great beast of steel they use to steal from Pedro's herd is considered forfeit in the mind of the tiger.

The door of the vehicle is drawn open. A fat man with a gun calls out in the night, "Senor Salazar?" The white tiger cares little for his gun, and with contempt she bats it away. She sends the man to flight with the terror of her coming alone. The great metal beast he rides is shifted into neutral and shoved back down the road, where it can roll off the side, scattering glass and groaning like a dying thing.

Yet the hunters are out in the fields, and the tiger knows it must teach them. She can smell their path and sees their approach will bring them into Pedro's reach. Tonight, it is not the tiger that shall drive them away, but the rightful over of these lands. They will know better than to come back here again.

The tiger must hurry, for the men have gone ahead of her. She measures the distances in her ears and finds the wind with her nose. They have changed their course and she must take matters in her hands once more. With great speed she races on, vanishing into the sleeping herd with practiced ease and waiting there for the greedy men.

When they come near the tiger takes action. A terrible roar fills the night and the herd awakens in fear. Like a snapping dog she is at their heels, driving their power against the would-be thieves. The stampede is a terror, and in the darkness the men are overtaken and scattered. Still, they are spared death, for the tiger pulls their heads away from crushing hooves again and again.

When the men are bruised and beaten, the tiger drags them together and with her roars draws Pedro to them. The stunned farmer sees men he knows, men who will be put in prison for the confessions their driver has screamed to police.

Still, Senor Moreno's herd has been scattered, and his children fret over all the work it will be recovering them. But the tiger is a creature of duty, and by dawn the stunned children see their beasts returning in order, under the watchful eye of the great cat. Before their cries of 'papa' can gain the attention of their father, the cat has gone once more, seeking another family, another city where it's attention might be drawn.

In the city of Saltillo, an ambitious man named Philippe Sanchez has big plans. Among his friends, he is known as a big-mouth and a braggart. The people simply call him Fat Philippe, which "all ass and no brains." He means to be governor, and with the money flowing into his efforts, he will likely succeed. Fat Philippe has made many promises and will make many more. It is obvious that he is another in a long line of corrupt politicians in Mexico.

All things are part of the way: justice and injustice, madness and clarity, love and hate. The endless shifting of positive and negative forces weaves a story through the ages, and that tale unfolds in every breath of the tiger.

Sanchez already parties as if he were governor and makes promises of many fool kinds. He drinks, flirts with women, and eats like a pig. It is obvious that nothing good can come of him as he is. Yet his true self is just hidden enough to avoid disaster. That thin layer of protection makes him an easy target.

The tiger hears his slurred boasts, his claims that he will be a big name after the interview on national television. He cries out again and again the glories he will achieve, and as he does the tiger creeps through his mansion, seeking patiently the suit that the man will wear for his interview.

For the tiger, doors and fences are merely landmarks. There is no place that can be barred from the wise and patient. She pauses in his room, ignoring the wasteful use of riches. The suit he will wear tomorrow is set out already. Without so much as a rumble of amusement the tiger moves close to it, tucking a bright red pair of women's underwear into its pocket.

She is not done, however. The tiger's ears have heard another tale, how the proud Philippe is a superstitious man, who always takes a long drink of tequila before his most important meetings. Down into the kitchen the tiger goes. There the young woman inside the tiger comes out, mingling with the tequila a special mixture of herbs that will be like fire in Philippe's veins after they are in his belly. The tiger comes out once more and quietly steals away.

Come the next day, Fat Philippe shames himself on national television. The people now have a new tale, laughing at the man who looks like a sick pig and mops up his sweat with the panties of a prostitute.

As the sun's first fingers reach over the horizon like slivers of gold the white tiger lids her eyes, seeing all she needs in the taste and scent of the wind. The vibration of her whiskers tells her that today shall be a warm and peaceful one. Above her head the pale disc of the moon hangs, sharing the morning sky with the rising sun.

Jet finds herself in a clearing. Nearby she can hear the soft song of rushing water. The trees are green and leafy, and the plant life surrounding the clearing is verdant. Nonetheless the center of the clearing is barren, possessing only parched and lifeless soil. Kneeling beside the desolate dirt is a man with silvery hair that reaches to his waist, piercing purple eyes, and visible tattoos across much of his bare chest and arms. He wears only a pair of ragged pants and sandals. Beside him is a clay jug full of water.

In the woods nearby, Jet can make out the soft whuffling and occasional growls of a tiger as it prowls. The place feels laden with mystic portent. It must be a dream or vision, but it possesses a reality which cannot be denied.

Jet watches calmly. She does not know where or when she is, nor why she is here, but it doesn't matter. She hears the sound of the tiger, but it does not bother her. She's so used to that sound now that it's simply a part of her. She walks closer to the man, looking from him to the water slowly. Though the quiet almost begs to be filled with a voice of some kind she says nothing.

The man's eyes track Jet as she moves, and he rises to his feet. Gesturing at the barren patch near him, he speaks. "Give it life," he orders.

Jet looks to the barren place for a moment and then to the water. She shuts her eyes, steps out into the center of the barren earth and sits there. "Life is here," she says simply.

The man shakes his head. "Here, you are only the will." He points to the water. "Without that, nothing will grow. But it cannot act. The will must guide it."

Jet reaches out to take the water. She pours it carefully around herself. "Water feeds life, but it does not make it."

"Perhaps it is too early for you," the man says quietly. "You will find those ready to hear you teach. Return to me when you wish to learn."

"Learning is harder than teaching," replies Jet. "Teach me so that I might learn from you."

"Watch and learn, then," the man says. He ushers Jet gently out of the circle of dirt, then points down where she splashed the water. A brief bit of mud has formed, but for the most part the dry soil has greedily drunk down the meager offering.

"This patch is not ready for cultivation, is it?" He pours more water; the patch stays dry as the moisture drains into the earth. In a few more moments, he's exhausted the pitcher, with nothing to show for his efforts. "This is not water. This is Virtue." He gestures at the lifeless soil. "And this is not earth. This is the Heart." He stares at Jet carefully.

"No measure of virtue can fill its emptiness," replies Jet. "Without a seed and light nothing can grow here."

"Come," says the stranger, empty pitcher still in hand, and sets off into the woods. He leads the way for a few minutes, emerging into another glade. Here there is a pool of water, surrounded by stone, and being fed by a rushing waterfall - the same that Jet heard earlier. He extends the pitcher to Jet and smiles. "This also is Virtue, and Heart. Empty it, if you can."

"I can never empty it," replies Jet. She dips the pitcher into the water and draws it out. "This place will never run dry."

The man nods. "Just so." His eyes lock onto Jet's and he holds his gaze for a long moment. "And how fares your own heart?"

Jet laughs softly, "It gets lighter. I have learned a great deal." She looks more serious and says, "There is life here. The wind is warm and the water clear."

"What is virtue?" the man asks.

"The only virtue I know is to be true to what I am. All that I am. I do not doubt what is right, I simply know it by being who I am." Jet does not dwell on it. "I am learning to flow like water."

Five sets of people emerge into the glade. The first set is a trio: Mark Williams and Emily Ito, smiling proudly with their hands clasped on the shoulders of a little girl who looks nervously (and eagerly) around. The second is a pair: the same girl, a little older, with Angela standing beside her. The third is Charity Williams, aged sixteen, dressed as a schoolgirl and laughing along with her two friends Natasha and Elizabeth. The fourth is a grim Charity, aged nineteen, holding a still-smoking pistol in her hand.

The fifth is a woman with flowing silvery hair and tattoos, much like the unnamed man's own. She is much older than the others, perhaps in her sixties, but she looks hale and healthy. There is a peaceful smile on her face, though she does not betray softness or weakness. She moves lithely, assuredly, without hesitation.

"Some here you have hated. Some here you have loved. Some you've tried to protect, others you've attempted to exclude. Some of them you've forgotten. Some you haven't truly met." The man smiles, as a white tiger emerges from the trees and joins the group.

"Say to them what you want. Ask of them what you want. If you are satisfied, there is one more thing you must see."

Jet looks from face to face, recognizing the faces, though some she does not know as well. She stands before the tiger and says, "These others are stories coming or going. You and I have many paths to walk together. We will share our visions of the world. Will you come with me?" Whatever it is that she is meant to see the tiger should see as well.

The tiger bobs its head, and moves forward. The man follows, as do the others. The animal leads the way up the cliff beside the waterfall. Periodically one person or another will stop, kneeling beside the stream and dipping their hands into it. "They are tributaries," the man explains. "We are going to meet the source."

The tiger has followed the waterfall's source back to its origin. It is a tiny bubbling spring, and Luna kneels beside it. The tiger takes up a position next to her.

"Mother," whispers Jet softly. She steps closer and settles herself before Luna, kneeling and bowing her head. "I was hoping you might be here." Yet now that she finds the goddess here, she can think of no questions to ask or anything more to say.

"You're a troublemaker, aren't you," Luna remarks wryly. "Dragging me all the way down here."

"I am a demanding child," replies Jet honestly. "But I've always been told I have a certain charm that makes it worthwhile."

"You do!" Luna replies with a grin. "Even when you're talking to yourself." She waves a hand at the tiger, and at the unknown man, still present.

"Well, when you have no one else to talk to." Jet grins impishly. "So it's just as well that you have come down here. Still, I imagine that you are still shining in the sky as we speak. I had a question to ask you, though." Yet she doesn't ask.

"36-24-36, dear," Luna answers primly.

Jet nods slowly. "Perfect proportions. I always thought so." She does look for a little bit. Just to make sure! "Actually, I had a second question. Not related to that. I wanted to ask what you think of the Sun."

"There is the Sun that shines, and the Sun that is a god, and the Sun that gives life. There's the hot Sun, and the distant Sun. There's the Sun that's a ball of fusing gas ninety-three million miles from Earth." Luna smiles gently. "I think he's perfectly delightful."

"I find those he has sent to be very good company." Jet imagines Luna already knows that with a certain one of those the company is very friendly, indeed. "I am glad that you are friendly with him. It would be very confusing to me if you were not. Am I right in thinking that in knowing myself I can know your will?"

"Try it and find out," answers Luna, a hint of friendly challenge and invitation in her voice.

"Well, I will continue as I have begun," says Jet. She looks at Luna with a grin, "So this is all in my head, right?" There's a bit of mischief in her voice and a playful glow in her eyes.

"Al that you have experienced here, except for me, has come from some part of you." Luna smiles. "Even this fine fellow is a prior incarnation of yours."

"He's a lot better groomed than the other who visits me at times. It's surprising how different my incarnations can be." Jet lids her eyes and lets out a relaxed sigh. "How long has this blessing been on Earth? Were there always those selected to protect and guide others?"

"The Chosen of the Maidens came first to prepare the way. The Sun and Moon have come only just recently. But man has always had legends and heroes to guide them."

"I will be what I am. I cannot promise any greatness or glory beyond that," answers Jet. "I will always appreciate what you have given me. I can only hope that is enough."

Luna gestures; the other aspects of Jet's life have gathered around the spring. "These are your source of virtue. These, and those others that have inspired you and will inspire you. Don't block them out, child. Don't pretend they don't exist. Don't hate yourself. Shame is part of virtue too. Self-denial is not."

Jet nods and smiles. "We are forged by what we have lived through. We learn from our triumphs and mistakes, and eventually we become who we are. I think I am there now. I am all these things and more. I have no reason to hide from my failures."

"You will forget this lesson too," Luna cautions. "You'll let it slip, and it will elude you. But you can get it back. Be yourself. Be the spring of virtue."

"As long as I am not afraid to take the next step, I will always find my way back," answers Jet. "I already have an advantage. I am never alone. Even here, in my own mind."
