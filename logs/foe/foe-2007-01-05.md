# Fall of Eden 2007-01-05

It is somewhat late in the day. The sun, while not setting, has made it clear that it is doing more than thinking of heading for Western horizons for the evening. The sky is many-hued as twilight nears... Xin takes the time to appreciate this tapestry in the sky, before turning back to the makeshift war-room inside of the Wonderland Trailer. Currently resting on the table is a mug filled with some formerly hot liquid, untouched for hours. "So... as I understand it, we can't just go in there, guns blazing, and kill everyone that moves. I mean, it's a simple plan... but it doesn't work out so well in the end..."

For the first time in day Jet is in the camp. Where she has been and what she has done is not something the others need to ask. Stories traced her like footprints. Whispers of the White Tiger spread through many of the local contacts the circle has used. She is sprawled out on the floor, looking very much like a cat, even in the guise of a woman. "It's wasteful. We just need to deal with the bad guys." Whoever they might be.

Xin agrees, "That is the big issue here. At least as far as I can see... how do we identify which ones are the bad guys, and how should we best deal with them?"

"We can only judge with what evidence we have," replies Jet. "In the case of the others, we knew by seeing what they had done to women, and by far too many rumors to ignore. I would say those we killed were all quite vile."

"Yes, but what do we know about these others," asks Xin, looking a bit thoughtful. "And is killing them our only recourse?"

"We must do what we feel is best," answers Jet. "You taught me to be myself, and not try to be someone else, remember?" She has taken her lessons to heart because they work for her. They make sense of the world. "Honestly I think we have to assume that we've given ourselves away. If these guys really have the support of our enemies, we can expect that we're not just gonna be up against a few clutzy wannabes."

Xin smiles, "It is amazing to see how much you've learned. And how fast too." There's no small amount of awe in Xin's voice there. He truly is amazed. "I agree though, we shall likely face more of the Assembled. That is troubling. I don't know if we're prepared to fight them. I know I can stand up to them, and I would imagine you're at least as capable as I am, but likely moreso... I worry about Poe and Doctor Benford though."

"They will find a way," replies Jet. "They have the light of the sun in them, and they have those extra helpers, as well. That gives them an advantage, even if they aren't trained warriors."

There's a rather thoughtful expression on Xin's face, "It gives them a rather large advantage, yes. Is there something further we can do for them?"

"Well, if they are interested in learning how to fight, we could teach them that," replies Jet. "I don't know if my style really fits their mindset, though. I am rather direct, wouldn't you say? Poe and Newton are far more subtle, I think."

"When necessary. I at least want to teach them to not get hit... it's an important lesson you know," says Xin, rubbing at his arm absently. "I agree though, you are quite direct."

"I think this time I just want to break the cartel, rather than destroy it utterly," muses Jet. "Oh, and yes, not getting hit is key. You can't win many fights if you use the Rocky strategy."

Xin laughs, "No, not too many. I'm curious as to just how good you are in a fight..." And then, he muses, "I suppose we'll draw out the ASsembled, if they're not out already... the thing I'm worried about is making sure they don't come after people less capable of defending themselves than the Chosen of the Heavens."

"We can't be everywhere at once," replies Jet. "We must do this job, and maybe after we are done we can start thinking beyond our immediate needs. For me, I just want my family to be safe. I have a feeling I want my family to keep growing, as well."

Xin considers, "Perhaps if we start thinking about how we can keep them safe beyond this, we can take steps, however small, to keep it from being as difficult in the future. It's like they say, never do great things. Always do things while they are still small and thus you can never be stopped. Or something along those lines anyway."

"True, but for us the problem is we are always drawn off to do many little things for others," says Jet. "Or at least, not huge things. It seems that our enemy has a lead on us, and we must hurry up to have the ability to strike problems before they grow enormous."

Xin nods, "Well at least we're striking this problem now. Do you have any kind of plan for this job?"

"I don't know enough about our enemy," replies Jet. "I think I should start by poking my nose into things. We should map out their hangout and see what they do and how they act. If they are murderers and rapists, we go for extermination. If they are reasonable, we can try diplomacy instead."

Xin says, "What would the diplomatic approach be?"

"Buy them off," says Jet. "Give them a better deal. There are a lot of ways to get people to change their mind. If they aren't a bunch of scumbags, they are just doing it for money, maybe for a bit of fame. We can work on those angles."

"So how do we get them to listen to what we have to say... I can't imagine they'd be pleased to see any of us..." says Xin, chuckling a little.

"They aren't likely to know who we are," says Jet. "The witnesses we left behind were rather hysterical and probably didn't want to talk much to anyone." Plus Jet wasn't seen much until she was wearing an impressive coating of gore.

Xin shakes his head, "No, but I imagine that after they'd heard someone hit their brethren, they're liable to shoot first and then question later."

"Perhaps, but usually these guys aren't really all that friendly with each other." Jet sighs, then goes on, "There's a pretty good chance we only saved them some time. It could well be that they were just getting ready to put each other down."
