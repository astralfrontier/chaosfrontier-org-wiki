The tractor-trailer, the Gemballa, and Jet's motorcycle have traveled west from El Paso. The group has decided to take on the Tijuana Cartel - the Man has said that now is the "auspicious moment", suggesting that the fates will align in the group's favor at this moment. He does not elaborate.

Luther and Jack ride in the sports car. Jet has her crotch-rocket. The group have procured a rugged, reliable jeep to fill in for the Hummer. Come nightfall, the three vehicles form an impromptu shelter in the 'badlands' off the road.

The group has made camp. Jack and Luther are comparing notes. The Man is nowhere to be found. Ricky and Mirya, and Jet and Poe, have paired off and disappeared. Saint Death, wearing a slightly more human expression, has borrowed Poe's laptop and is writing some sort of lengthy article. She declines any attempt at sociability, and the pale aura that hangs around her does its own part at discouraging friendship.

Everyone else has gone off to do whatever it is they're going to do. Taking a cue from Saint Death, Xin is also in front of a laptop, although he's not writing anything so involved. He is stretched out, listening to the sounds of the gunshots and explosions that drive along the plot of some actioner film. The quality isn't the greatest, either. Every now and then, Xin jots something down on a notepad. _Two pistols?_ There's a thoughtful tapping on the paper.

Benford saunters in from the bunkroom, drawn by the sounds of cinematic violence. "I guess that film is of professional interest," he asks, without malice. "And probably in several ways."

Xin gestures to a spot beside him. "Yeah." There's a quick laugh, "You know when I first Exalted, I was told I ought to watch these things. Homework. It reminds you of what is possible. At least... for us."

Benford plops down on the couch. "Did... did HE tell you that?"

Xin shakes his head, "No. The Man did. As for well... you know... well." He takes a moment to recall, "He told me I was the inheritor of thousands of years of culture and such. That I'm supposed to go be a hero. How about you?"

Benford says, "He just told me... use what you've been given, every day." The scientist scratches his head. "I think I have a problem, though. I keep getting the feeling - sometimes delivered very bluntly - that I'm missing the point. That... I'm still thinking like a mortal, I guess. And maybe they're right, because I don't even like saying 'mortal', like that's not me." He shrugs. "What am I missing?"

Xin says, "What you're missing... hmmm..." He points at the screen, tapping pause with the little wireless mouse. "Well, perhaps what you're missing is the familiarity with what you've been given. For example... you are capable of doing that." At the end of the finger, pointing at the screen, is a man twisting out of the way of bullets, motion effects here or there. "But I would imagine that you don't know how, right now. You've probably never tried. Or have you?"

Benford shakes his head. "Tried something like it in New York City. I got shot." He runs his fingers over his scalp. "It should have killed me. And I should be asking why it didn't, I suppose. Maybe I don't like the implications. If it really is magic, is that the end of science?"

It's Xin's turn to shake his head. "No. Why should it be? Isn't science, at its core, the drive to understand the universe? If it really is Magic, which, I think it is... why does that make the universe any more or less explainable? People have been wrong about how the world has been before, and they've been right well before it was commonly accepted. People have been talking about magic before... and maybe they've been wrong, but what if not all of them were? It doesn't invalidate science, it simply means it needs to be redefined. And if anyone is capable of redefining science, and what it is capable of doing, I would say that you were, Doc."

Benford smirks. "Flattery will get you everywhere. But perhaps you've hit upon something there. I look around, and I see each of us, and I see representatives of many types of heroism. Each of us has our reasons for Exaltation and our methods, but collectively... maybe there's a problem we're supposed to solve together."

"It makes sense," says Xin, who then smiles wryly, "And it comforts me that the universe makes sense."

"Really?" Benford seems genuinely glad to hear it. "Well. Perhaps we have something in common. Something very important."

Xin chuckles, "I imagine we have a lot in common, just from different angles of approach."

"Gentlemen." The voice is Selber's; his presence makes itself known as he speaks. Xin is surprised to hear the voice as well, however, and he can see the Germanic traveler standing near to Benford. "Let's talk about what you have in common a moment. Starting with me."

"Well aren't you going to introduce me?" the phantasm asks Benford.

Benford stands up, obviously startled. "Well. Xin, this is Selber, my invisible friend, the personification of all those who have held my Spark before me. Selber, this is Xin. And if Poe's 'informant' hadn't already pulled this trick, I'd be wondering if we'd both gone mad."

"It's no trick." Selber sucks in air disapprovingly and lets out a long sigh. "Benford, care to explain what's going on?"

Benford rubs his hands, thinking for a moment. "As I understand it, the Spark of Exaltation is bonded with a person, and stays with them for life. When we die, the spark continues, containing within it the memories of all previous hosts, including our own. A line of Exalts, back to the beginning of time. When perceived as a person..." he waves a hand at Selber. "He is me." Benford frowns. "The precise nature of the Spark is beyond me, but... if the entire world is Essence, then I expect the Spark is much closer to pure Essence than the mundane world of atoms and forces. So the Sparks can bend the rules of reality, so here he is. Nothing that says he can't talk to other people," Benford turns back to Selber, "but usually you've just been the voice in my own head. So I imagine you're here for a purpose."

"'You imagine me here for a purpose' would be closer to the truth," Selber smiles. "But first... the spark of Exaltation is impressive, but limited in the knowledge it conveys. The manifestation of myself, 'Selber', is the product of further engineering done on the Spark by a scientist called Davron. It was his work that ultimately led to the guides, guardians, avatars and teachers which each of you know in your own ways."

"Think about that for a moment, Benford." Selber's eyes drill into the other man's. "Soul manipulation technology. Magic does not mean science is dead. Magic means science must look with open eyes. May I demonstrate?"

Xin speaks up, "I've no objection," he says, failing to mask the almost eager tones in his voice utterly.

Benford sounds eager, but nods. "I know you work to teach me. If I have apprehension, it can't stand in the way. And perhaps you'll tell me, then, the Sparks were not always thus? Not always an active voice?"

"I'll teach you how to find out," smiles Selber. "I'm going to present to you a physical phenomenon, a property of physics. I want you to identify it, without moving from where you stand. Are you ready? ... Oh yes, you must also close your eyes."

Benford raises an eyebrow, then lowers it, closing both his eyes tightly, arms slack by his sides.

Selber retrieves a mirror from his pocket. He carefully catches light from the room and flashes it about, making sure never to shine the light across Benford's eyes. "Now, what is it called?" he asks.

Benford frowns, says nothing. His forehead furrows. _Obviously he wants me to see something... but my eyes are closed... so..._ Benford takes an inventory of senses. _Vision, hearing, smell, touch, taste... but no, those aren't the senses. Most of taste is really smell; touch is hot and cold, pain and pressure... most of vision is really buried back in the brain, the metaphor of 'eye as tv camera' is such bollocks..._ And suddenly he understands. _And idea of reality as what the senses tell us, is also bollocks._ Just as vision is more than a sequence of images, the world is more than a collection of impressions.

Benford points at the bright spot on the wall, then traces the path back to Selber's hand, and up to the flourescent tubes in the roof. "Reflection," he says simply.

"Now. How do you _know_, without using your familiar senses?" he asks.

Benford says, "I... I'm not sure." He frowns again. "It's in my head. Like... like seasickness, I guess, only not unpleasant; noticing a difference between what the eye and the ear perceive. This is the difference between perception and... and what's really there, I guess. The currents of Essence, I suppose, although I'm at a loss to describe how that feels."

Selber nods and smiles. "Xin, go get Jet. She'll be with Morgan, I think - bring him along, he'll find this of interest."

Xin nods, "Certainly. I shall return shortly," he says, before setting out to try and find Jet and Morgan. He gives them the benefit of making all manner of clumsy noises, letting them hear his approach long before he might even be anywhere they'd consider near. "Jet, Morgan," he calls, as he looks for them, "There's um... well, you two should come and see this."

Benford thinks, _Hypatia, how much of this are you getting? Can you talk to Selber directly, or do I have to relay for you?_

_I can speak with him, but it is under your control,_ the woman responds. _I know whatever you permit me to know._

By the time Xin gets around to fumbling to where Jet and Poe are, the Lunar is quite composed (though her hair is rather messy and her clothes a bit wrinkled.) She arches an eyebrow and asks Xin teasingly, "You been drinking?"

Morgan sits up, looking up from behind Jet, and brushes some stray locks away from his forehead. "He doesn't look drunk to me," he remarks dryly.

Xin shakes his head, "No, not drunk yet. I just thought I'd give you guys the chance to stop making out before I came to get you. Doctor Benford's seeing things without seeing them. Experiencing Essence. His friend Selber, which I imagine is like a friend both of you have, says you'll want to see it. So come along." Then Xin turns to lead them back to Benford and Selber.

Benford is still standing in the middle of the lounge with his eyes closed, tracking the movement of Selber's mirror with his head. "What did he tell you?"

Morgan takes in the scene for a few seconds. "So you're one of Benford's inner voices, then?" he asks, cautiously.

"I am." Selber gestures. "Meet the rest of the family." Behind Morgan and Jet, a feral, furred beast-woman is prowling about. And on the notepad Xin was taking notes on, the drawing of a nine-tailed fox-creature stirs its head and looks up.

Jet looks over at her own guide and grins. "She's not much for small talk, but she makes her point." Even if Jet thinks she might snap and try to kill her at any moment, it's clear she appreciates the help.

Xin ahas, "I was wondering when you would show up." He gestures to the little drawing. "It appears that the gang's all here... I'm still curious as to how you're doing that Doctor, by the way."

"_I'm_ curious," says Morgan, "about where the mirror came from."

Benford opens his eyes, takes inventory. "Well. Suppose there was a land inhabited only by the blind, a race that had never even heard of vision. One day a child is born to them who can see. What do they make of him? What does he make of himself, and this weird extra-sensory power to detect texture at a distance, to perceive properties of objects that have nothing to do with their touch or their sound?"

"He'd be held in awe," muses Morgan. "And feared, by those who were blind. They would think it was... well, magic."

"We're dealing with something like that," Benford continues. "Something the human brain isn't prepared to deal with, but which we perceive nonetheless. I guess I'd thought this was more Xin's field; the kind of thing you're supposed to see during zen meditation. However... I think it's something we all can do. Perhaps something we have to do, if we're going to understand our own power."

Xin explains, "It's like I said. Much in common, just from different angles... zen meditation, occult sciences... the paths might be different but the journey is the same." He asides, "Did that sound mystic enough?"

Benford reaches out to Jet, and asks, "May I see your hands?" A glance at the beastwoman, looking rather sulky in the mechanical environment of the trailer. "I know you're unhappy. We're trying." And then to Selber, "Maybe a bit of a push, old man. I can barely do this for myself."

Jet offers her hands with a rather bemused expression. "Just watch yourself, if you get Poe jealous I can't be responsible," she warns.

Benford grins at Poe. "So it's that way, is it?" he comments, with mock surprise. "Then everyone gather around. Jet's arm is a stronger example than a moving mirror. Maybe we can open your eyes, as well."

Benford asks Jet to hold her hands out, face up, their backs resting against his palms. "OK. Everyone, close your eyes, and remember what it felt like the first time you were in touch with Essence. Jet, let's start with something simple. Flex the fingers in your left hand, and then do the same with your right."

Jet isn't really sure of what Benford is trying to do, but she does as she is asked, flexing fingers. She does so slowly, one finger at a time. She doesn't try to focus on anything in particular as she follows the instructions, letting her mind drift and wondering if instinct might pick-up whatever it is that Benford is talking about.

Benford doesn't see much himself at first, but he's aware of the movement of Jet's hands, one skin, one furry. After a moment he takes his hands away, while concentrating... he thinks he can still feel the motion, or at least he imagines he can. "Everyone, picture in your head what she's doing. Now... Jet, alter the rhythm, but don't announce it."

For the next half-hour, Benford and Selber work through a long string of observations, including those that are visible to mundane senses, and some that affect only Essence. Each of the Exalts takes turns as a 'subject', exercising their particular talents, to see a spark that shines even when one's eyes are closed.

Xin finds himself fascinated by the exercises. It is meditation, but... from a different angle... and all of the things he'd heard before, about sensing the energy, feeling the flow of _chi_ take on a different light.

Morgan is still integrating the lessons he'd learned from Xin, but it is still those meditation techniques that represent his own grasp on Essence. As he closes his eyes, he focuses on his breathing first, as he was taught... and then lets his imagination roam outward, picturing Jet's arms as he remembers them, imagining her hands flexing.

Jet is perhaps more tied to her senses than some. Much of the time, she has all the skills of the animals in this way, incredible vision, amazing sense of smell, etc. As herself, she still retains one sense that in most humans is supressed, however. Her instincts. She trusts them, and allows them to guide her in this. If this is another sense, it should just work on its own, if she is open to it, and lets it come to her.

Selber has watched. Finally he speaks. "Tch. You're not feeling for what you _want_ to feel," he says at last. "Still trying for a sense of motion, for something outward. Dive deeper, Doctor. There's a truer diagnosis, and it won't be in this pendulum game."

Benford grunts, and changes his focus. "Her arm is her arm. Physically, morphologically, impossible, but the world accepts it." _Or maybe the world is rejecting part of the woman in favor of the tiger; or perhaps the tiger is rejecting part of the woman..._ He turns from Jet, fixes his sight on the beast-woman. _So what does the world make of you, then?_

"At last," murmurs Selber, as he flickers and changes.

---

Benford is submerged into the flow of Essence, and for the first time he understands why it is called 'riding the dragon'. Part of his mind devotes itself to asking why he knew of this phrase at all. The analogy is apt. 'Around him' is the sensation of magnitude, much like he felt when he was working near the supercollider - a confluence of forces blocked away by some enormous power, structured, confined, and channeled.

He is aware of the fiery core of Jet's Essence, a catlike woman's outline silhouetted by the silvery light of the moon and surrounded by the smaller black figures of her children. He can see the shadows gathering around her, see her raking out with taloned claws to swat them away. And he can feel a pull, like a mystic magnetism, drawing him toward other sensations. A vast space of words and pictures and ideas, swirling in a vortex and suffused by a voice shouting joyously into the sky, a sensation he recognizes with a start as Andrew Morgan.

He feels other pulls, too - a tiger's face, a roaring growl. It has its paw hooked on Jet's outstretched hand. Benford doesn't see it - he simply knows it, like a memory. He feels the predecessors of Jet's spark, rolled into the beastwoman he saw. And he feels Hypatia close at hand, a burning luminescence filling the spaces between these things.

He knows what is going on. He knows the tiger's pain, he knows Jet's fear, and he knows what must be done.

---

Benford recovers from the vision. "Oh, God." It takes several minutes for him to find words to express what he saw. "The Tiger is jet's totemic animal. Part of your being... but... also partially incompatible. To put it another way, the tigress is unhappy, which is odd, because... well... they seem like such a perfect fit. Tigers hunt, tigers kill... but they're also maternal, and are very protective of their cubs."

Benford perches on the back of a sofa, and sighs. "But there's something that Jet does, which a tiger does not do. A tiger has no regrets. Tigers have no self-doubt. To be a tiger is to do all those things, and to accept them. To second-guess is not the Tiger nature."

Benford says, "Jet, and the Tiger, and the beastwoman, and Jet's family, are all part of the picture... and so is Poe, which is to be expected, and so is Hypatia, which is unexpected. Maybe she just helps one to see; but then, there was no sign of Eddie, or Xin, never mind Xin's 'passengers'." He sighs. "Jet, does any of this mean anything to you?"

Morgan raises a hand. "I'm not sure why you didn't see Eddie... but maybe you saw Hypatia because she was there with you."

Benford says, "Probably." _Hypatia, is that consistent with your experience? Do essence-users always see you there, when they perceive in that manner?_

_Yes, my presence would be expected,_ Hypatia replies.

"You are asking a lot," replies Jet, her tone shifting slightly. It may be that the tiger is at war with her in some way, but she's hardly happy to talk about that openly. "I have changed a great deal. I have done what I thought was right. That's more than most of the people I've come across in my life. Whatever mistakes I made have made me who I am. I think that gives me only two choices. To die, because that end result has no value, or to live as everything I am, tiger and woman as one. I want to live. This is who I am. If I spend all my time thinking of the path that got here, and of any mistakes some might say I've made, I will never find my place in the now."

"I see," Benford says, softly. "And where does Poe fit into this? Now? Then? Not yet?"

"Now and in much time to come, if he wishes to have me at his side," replies Jet. "But he has nothing to do with this." She holds up her hand and looks at it, "This is something else. A cry for help that doesn't know it's been heard. It's a part of me that has had to shout so loud to get my attention that it's forgotten to listen when the answer comes." She lowers it and shrugs, "But it is what it is. I will go on as I have, and do what I must. I only want to be whole, and no matter what is happening with that, in all the ways that really matter, I already am complete."

"If you wish it to hear," the beastwoman says gently, to Jet, "do not regret this. Let it be complete too. Will you give it that power?"

"I'm not sure how I can give it this power, if I haven't already. This sign it sent was just a scratching at the tree with no indication or guidance," replies Jet. "I am navigating blind, but I have done this my whole life. I guessed to get as far as I have, but it seems this final step eludes the only truth I know."

Morgan speaks up quietly. "I saw how you were after the raid on the Juarez, Jet. What happened that day... what you did to them disturbed you." He swallows. "Perhaps it isn't the whole of the problem, but... it can't be a coincidence, knowing what we know now, that your arm changed after that day."

"It wasn't a coincidence. Nothing that happens to us is a coincidence anymore, if it ever was," replies Jet evenly. She looks thoughtful, "It's the difference between weeping for the necessity of death and tearing out at the seams. I cannot afford to forget that it is okay for justice to be brutal from time to time. It's important to know when that is true, and accept it without feeling wrong inside about it. We are not just given powers, but responsibilities, including Judgement."

"I killed them, and killed them in a way that will spin stories of horror and fear for decades," says Jet. "They deserved exactly what they were given. For all the harm they caused it was necessary, and had I not done what I did exactly as I did it, they might have continued to do so, or others might think they could rape and abuse without second thought. I have put a fear of god back into their hearts." She holds up the clawed hand, "This is my hand of Judgement and the Wrath and Mercy of Luna are all it holds. For those vile ones who fall across its path, it is a terror beyond any mortal punishment. For those who are gentle and afraid, it brings shelter and the caress of a mother."

"But this is who I am, as much as the rest of me, and I can no more separate it from myself than I can tear out my heart and go on with my journey." The Lunar clenches that strange hand in front of herself, "I will kill again, and I will weep, but not for the fallen, or for myself. I cry only for those frightened ones I gather to my arms. I will share their pain and heal them. I have learned that I am not just death, but life as well. I am the Chosen of Luna the Ever Changing. I am all these things, and yet I am none of them."

Benford says, "Maybe I've been looking at this all wrong. Maybe having one hand stuck as a paw isn't a problem. It sounds like you know what it means. It sounds like you've accepted the Tiger, at least in principle. Maybe the problem is that the rest of you is stuck as human. Aren't Lunars supposed to be able to assume a halfway form, that combines anthorpoid and animal traits? But we've only ever seen you fully formed one way or the other... except for this one time."

Benford looks over at the beast-woman, unsure of how to address her. "Your... your friend, here... umm... miss... you're in the vision, too. And of course you're here with us now. Is that how it works? Integration of the animal and human natures leads to a hybrid physical form?"

"Yes. But Jet does not have enough Essence to master it yet," the felinoid replies. "This world is empty of the power she needs."

Benford says, "But she can manage a hand, even unconsciously. And given sufficient Essence..." _Hypatia, is it possible to activate the Engine and direct the power to a third party?_

_No._

Benford says, "So we need to get Jet an engine. Perhaps it's as simple as that."

Benford notices now that Selber has gone. Where he was standing is a young man with spectacles, blonde hair done backi in a ponytail, and a white shirt. Suspenders keep his pants up, and his hands are shoved in his pockets. He has a knowing grin on his face. "Then give her one," he suggests.

Benford blinks at the young man. "Do I know you? Who are... who WERE you?"

The young man grins widely. "I'm Selber's successor. You've got what you need from him. I'm here to continue the journey. So let's get to it! Give Jet an Engine."

Benford looks at Poe, and at Xin, and then back at the young man. "Don't suppose I can build one yet?"

The youth shakes his head. "Not yet. But you lack only two things - practical knowledge, and tools. Get those things, and you could."

"Is this really a good idea?" asks Jet. She's never been precisely comfortable with the whole idea of voices talking in her head. Especially not if they could watch her every move. There's a reason she's not really made any effort to get her own, and she has been very happy to be denied the 'honor'.

Benford says, "Yes. In fact, I'm hoping that the proper course of action here is to build you an engine, or take out another Assembled and appropriate one for you, because you can get quite fond of them."

Benford says, "And I'd be loathe to part with Hypatia, or ask Xin or Poe to part with theirs."

"Well, maybe they could just loan it? Short term, right?" Jet would be so very happy to give it right back. Or at least she thinks so at the moment.

Benford thinks, _Hypatia? Will that work? Would it... well, bother you?_

_I'm okay with it. It's for your friend, right?_

_Yes, it is, but there's no call for me to be cavalier._ "Jet, Hypatia has agreed to help you, if you're willing." And then in a murmur, "Take care of her. She too has saved my life."

"Just no peeking at my random thoughts, or I'll get the barney song stuck in your head." Jet isn't really sure how to effectively threaten something that has no physical form, but that sounds horrifying to her. "So what do I do?"

Benford holds out his hand. "Give me your hand again. It will make it easier, I think. Let her in when she comes knocking." _Hypatia, please go to Jet. Thank you for everything. I hope we get to work together again soon._

Jet reaches out her hand. "Just tell me what you want me to try, then she's all yours again." There's some measure of stubborn independence in her. Well, more than just a measure. It's rather closer to a truckload.

Benford feels a pang as Hypatia leaves him. "Ask her to activate the Engine. Go outside if you're going to do it now; or you can wait until you're in combat. It seems easier when the situation is desperate, which makes me wonder if the flow of Essence is attracted to crisis and tipping points." He smirks. "Small wonder it comes to us at the dawn of the 21st century, then."

Jet nods slowly and wanders outside. "Time to see just what we can do, hmm?" She will let any interested observers (both living and not so much) take their positions, and with a grim expression she says, "Here we go."

Morgan nods, his brow furrowed with worry. "I remember how it felt when I invoked the Engine. If you aren't in immediate danger, like I wasn't in Walla Walla..." He trails off, shaking his head.

The first sensation Jet feels is a rush of power through her body. Her will is nearly overwhelmed with it, and she feels something unwelcome building inside her mind, and then her attention is pulled far away, losing that detail in the rush of great change.

The shifting of flesh and bone is both grotesque and strangely beautiful at the same time. It brings to mind stories of lycanthropes in some ways, but also the various incarnations of the Incredible Hulk. Where there was once a young woman towers a mix of human and tigress. A highlight of glinting moon silver is in her fur, and she towers overs the others. Her body is broad and muscular, and yet she moves with more grace than ever she did as a mortal.

Jet in this form is closer to cat than woman. Her forehead is flattened, her ears folded back against her head, her eyes, wide and alert, glimmering with the fearless curiousity of a feline. "This is the me that is both tiger and woman in body as well as mind." Her voice is changed as well, deeper and more powerful. She spreads her arms and throws back her head, roaring at the sky, the booming painfully loud to the ears. After this challenge, Jet lowers herself so that her front 'hands' might reach the ground, making it clear she can run on all fours if she desires it. "So uh, now that I'm She-Hulk, what do I do?"

Morgan manages a half-smile. "Whatever you want?"

The blonde, ponytailed youth smiles. "Good work, dad!" he says proudly.

Benford nods at the youth, not asking what he means just then. "I think the Tiger is happy. At least that's how it looks to me."

"The tiger would really kill for a good steak, though," notes Jet, sounding quite hopeful. "Oh, and does this mean I actually did something? Can I give it back now?" She definitely likes having access to this kind of power, but the whole concept of a symbiote, especially one that 'belongs' to someone else, bothers her enough to make it too high a cost. She wants to be her own.
