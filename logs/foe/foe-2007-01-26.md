# Fall of Eden 2007-01-26

December 21st, 2007. The Solars feel a wash of Essence pass through them at midnight. Those asleep feel the sensation in their dreams; those awake feel the surge of power pour into their bones and being from the world around them. Each experiences the sensation differently.

For Benford, it's a sudden insight, the sensation of genius drawn out and accelerated and extended. It's the brief sparkle of a moment of brilliance woven into a tapestry of pure light, and for a few moments, he understands all.

For Morgan, it's an apprehension of the Truth, a tidal force that erases the darkness of his inner eye. Beyond that veil lies the magnificent cobalt spiderweb of Destiny, and all the interconnections that define mankind's experience.

For Xin, it's harmony, the uniting of the inner and outer selves. The stuntman becomes the fighter, the actor becomes the true hero. The radiant wishes of his audience that bubble below the surface of his craft rise to the surface and perfect him as the avatar of honor.

For Jet, the sudden spike of Essence feels like nature. The rightness of violence and the correctness of pacifism, the true meaning of life and death, the unheard song of the five elements that sing in unison within the souls of those yet to come. It is especially to Jet that the powers of those elements whisper. Their message is simple: _We awaken. We are coming to aid you._

December 24. The intelligence Luther has available, plus Xin and Ricky's observations close up, plus the surveillance that Jet and Mirya have provided, pin Christmas Eve as the date on which the Tijuana cartel will move their arms. The plan is to move through the tunnel systems during mid-afternoon. This should put them on the U.S. side, well away from civilization and observation, by nightfall. There will be vehicles from Los Angeles there to meet them.

With Ricky stubbornly insisting on being part of the action, Jet considers her options with care. She is inherently uncomfortable having people turn to her to make decisions. The Full Moon greatly prefers to command only herself. In the end, after a lot of discussion, Ricky will be on the point on the Mexican side with Mirya going along with him, in the form of a dog. Luther and Jet will be on the US side, keeping contact as best they can. Jet's duty is simple: if something big shows up, kill it and ask questions later. While they wait, Luther and Jet will be keeping their eyes open for the pick-up vehicles.

On the US side, Jet and Luther become aware of the work of the FBI. Working with their usual flare, they have mustered local manpower to control collateral damage (and keep them happily out of their way) and drummed-up some shooters from the California National Guard. If there's any opportunity to shoot, Jet assures Luther the US forces will. She can smell their excitement.

Meanwhile, Ricky's carefully picked team of Mexican drug officials are waiting to chase. The plan is straight-forward. Rush in and drive the smugglers into the caves, then let the Americans mop things up and do the dangerous work. While the National Guard is eager to shoot, the Mexican police are more aware of the danger and would be quite happy to not fire a bullet tonight. Ricky was wise in making his selections.

Amongst the swirling currents that flow around the FBI agents, Jet can sense a different breed. Though they are not marked by any badge or symbol, there is an aura of grim determination and a scent drifts to Jet that she isn't familiar with at first. When they move into the houses first, Jet knows that scent. It is controlled fear. The tunnel rats are the front line, a mixture of SWAT and assassin. Jet catches a better view of one of these men as he slips into a hole concealed near a house and the pale green of night vision goggles is noticed for just a moment before he vanishes. "Not long now," she murmurs quietly.

Jet sighs and says to Luther, "Warn Ricky that the transformers just showed up." She slips out of her coat and tosses it back to the Sidereal, as well. Before he can ask, she explains, "I'm going to go kill one of these metal assholes." With that, she is moving forward swiftly, her eyes moving carefully as she weaves her way closer. It's dark in the caves, though, and a human is worthless below. A serpent, however, can 'see' without fail in the darkness of the caves, and a rattler can move as silent as death itself.

The snake dodges feet with practiced ease. Jet focuses her mind on the air, her forked tongue flicking and tasting, even seeing everything around her. She can sense the heat of a passing human, and though her careful dance from entrance to entrance is focused first on the lack of scent, she also heeds heat signatures that will mark out the inhuman enemy she stalks.

A dozen Border Patrol agents, all armed with sidearms, rifles, shotguns, and assorted other hardware, are working their way into the noxious tunnel system. The water is slimy and probably poisonous in high concentrations.

Jet can hear their boots splash. She can feel the vibrations of their footfalls. She can make out the hushed breathing, realizing that some of these men practice breath control as sophisticated as Xin's. She observes the motion of leg, the compact pose they maintain, the kinematic flow of their muscles. Their proficiency at stealth is clear.

One of them, however, has no human scent whatsoever. To Jet's olfactory awareness he is a moving blank. His nametag reads "John Lever".

Jet decides it would be foolish to act right now. For one, she can't easily reveal the threat to the real agent before he helps his 'partner'. She doesn't feel like killing anyone innocent today, either. Instead, she prepares herself and chases the enemy, her sinuous form cutting through the foul water silently. At least she shouldn't have to talk to this machine. She rather prefers the idea of just pounding one into scrap. Not like that is going to be easy, of course.

---

The FBI has sent one of its best - Special Agent Schroeder. In reality, Schroeder requested the assignment. He speaks Spanish, has worked with other departments of American law enforcement, and so forth. He has the qualifications. He also has a mission, and he reflects on this as he speaks to the man beside him.

"I'm still at a loss, Mr. Starr. How is it that you came to find out about the Gepetto investigation?"

Mr. Starr shrugs slightly. "My horoscope was lucky, I suppose."

---

Jet wriggles through the tunnels, mindful of the sewage and the potentially toxic waste around her. Nevertheless she manages to stay on the trail of Lever and his companion, a woman called Ruth Fordesque. Both are well-armed and wary. They do not exchange small talk; it seems at times to Jet that they are not even breathing. These people would have been formidable in her mortal criminal days, and more than a few must have tangled with her old associates as they used similar avenues to smuggle goods to and from the United States.

They spend most of their time moving quietly, advancing through the tunnels and covering each other as they need. They possess light-amplification gear, of course, and they seem to have the routes memorized. At some junctions, one will stop and affix an adhesive device about the size of a dime to the tunnel wall or ceiling, always hidden behind some rough imperfection or outcropping of the tunnel.

Sensing that this pair will continue as they have (and knowing the scent of Ruth Fordesque) Jet will slip away, rushing through the tunnels far faster than the tunnel rats can afford to. With every flick of her tongue she reaches out, trying to catch the scent of humans or the slightest vibrations or changes in air pressure that would indicate another entrance is opening. For a moment, Jet will coil tightly and grow still, taking advantage of the relative silence of a reptile's body to reach out farther still, waiting as patiently as the dead for some sign.

Well after the Border Patrol tunnel team has set their sensors, Jet becomes aware of a mixture of scents. She can make out the tang of gunpowder and primer, the scent of human under a thick layer of mud and grime, and that of an animal. Relying on her Lunar instincts, she identifies them at last - burros, a venerable pack animal. The gunrunners must be masking their scents to fool dogs by soaking themselves and their mules in grime.

Jet focuses her attention on these newcomers. They are, after all, the ones she's hear to stop. The Full Moon wants to give her enemy a chance to break-up, so that she might hunt them more easily. For the moment, she waits to see if they will do so. If not...

The cartel's men are just as cautious and just as professional as the cops. They fan out through the tunnels, using a combination of entry-lights mounted underbarrel and night-vision gear. Some peel off, presumably to set up traps or ambushes, or to take up the rear once the main convoy makes it through. This is dangerous turf, but they exude an aura of familiarity.

Jet notices the lack of scents and sighs inwardly. Three more enemies that only she will be able to fight. Still, at least she has a chance against them. That chance is less if they are able to proceed at their own pace. Knowing this, the Full Moon studies the equipment of these men, her eyes focused on their gear. Yet no matter how many times she pauses, she keeps looking back at the clever mode of transport. Clever..

Except that burrows are so easily slain, and without them the whole operation becomes hopeless. The snake moves forward, and Jet finds a rut to hide in in the path, waiting there for her targets to draw close, not even breathing as she watches the animals come nearer to her.

With the men drawing closer, Jet lies as if she were dead, her cold, merciless eyes fixed on the first burrow as it moves near. She hears the breathing of the beast, she measures its loud steps, and with each of those footfalls she flicks her tongue and shifts her position slightly before growing still once more. She uses the cold of the waters to mask herself more fully, her reptilian blood growing cold so that she won't stand out in the augmented senses of her enemies.

The strike, when it comes, is quick, precisely aimed, and followed by the same careful movement that Jet has been making use of. The fangs of the rattler are buried into the flesh of the burrow just long enough to deliver their poison. Unlike a normal snake, Jet's attack is guided very carefully, as she aims for the backleg of the burrow, hoping to hit an artery where the venom will work more quickly. She is very focused on whether or not she is detected, readying herself for that moment when the time for quiet is past.

The effect on the animal is immediate and violent. The burrow screams and suddenly flies into motion, yanking wildly at the reigns and, finding that ineffective, charges forward, braying wildly as it struggles to get away. Jet is lucky to avoid being trampled as the animal simply goes berzerk from the pain of the bite and the spreading venom.

"_Madre!_" Shouts go up among the men as the burro reacts. One of the faster-thinking Mexicans draws his sidearm - silenced, it seems - and pulls the trigger. A muffled _fweep_ and a spray of blood announce the animal's rather immediate demise, and he quietly barks a few instructions to the others - the Mexican equivalent of "watch your footing for rusty nails and things."

Grumbling, the men begin unpacking the arms from the now-dead burro and shouldering the burden themselves.

Jet considers her options thoughtfully. She could either keep striking out at individual animals all night or she could raise the stakes and try to blow some of these people up. Knowing the cave they must use helps her make up her mind, and she slips down a side tunnel, listens for a moment, then races at the full paces of her serpent form, using her knowledge of the tunnel layout and her greater speed to get ahead of the gun-runners. She needs time to set something special up for them.

Jet shifts forms from serpent to woman and sets to work. She has already used her advanced senses to find a long board with several sharp nails on it. Nails that these men will be ready for. Jet carefully draws out three grenades, spacing them on the ground quickly and using wire to connect the pins tightly to the board. The grenades are then very carefully set down, waiting for an overly-careful smuggler to move this danger to the burros from their path.

Jet looks over her handiwork with grim satisfaction. She doesn't have time to admire it for long. The fox tugs at the back of her mind, urging her away with a mischief gleam in its eyes. She sees no need to hang around a bunch of explosives, and rushes away, getting herself quite clear of the danger zone and shifting back into the form of a snake. She doesn't halt yet, she feels that urge to get near an exit, and if she has learned one thing, it is to trust her instincts.

It is about the time that Jet settles just outside the tunnels that a middle-aged Mexican leans over, yelling angrily at the men ahead. "What are you doing, trying to get us killed!?" are perhaps not the most awe-inspiring last words, but they will have to suit.

It takes the man's mind a moment to do the work as the pins are tugged free of grenades. By the time his coming doom registers, shards of metal and searing heat blast outward. The concussive force throws the man up into the roof of the cave, which is when the explosive charges in his own grenades erupt in a collosal rush of searing heat and sharp metal.

In seconds the center of the procession is flattened, and bullets stored away are ignited and fire, raining down their own bit of hell on those farther down or farther back in the tunnel, so that the rearmost guard catches a bullet in the forehead while others around him wisely stay down. The ground shakes, and every motion sensor is tripped simultaneously as all hell breaks loose in the caves.

Those left alive are blind, their night vision equipment ruined by the explosion of light and the air is so choked with dust that breathing comes in loud coughs. Many of those who weren't killed were knocked out, and all have been effectively rendered deaf for the next day or two. Fire rushes along the top of the filthy waters of the cave, and then the air itself explodes into, completing the blindness in its brief ignition and sending the burros and their handlers both into complete panic as their are scalded.

"One of them is here!" shouts one of the Mexicans in the middle of the din. "Contingency!" Jet can immediately see the others stiffen - those still standing lose all trace of fear or pain on their faces. The survivors move as a man. They gather up grenades and explosives, rushing through the flaming water to both of the exits to this tunnel, some still bleeding or burning.

To a man, the gunrunners at the southern end of the tunnel pull the pins on the grenades they're still carrying. Some plant their explosive charges on the tunnel walls near the divider. There is a massive explosion to rival Jet's own work, and that part of the tunnel collapses onto itself. The southern path is cut off.

Jet measures her options. She can fight down here, where the enemy has all the advantages, or she can run where she might just have some back-up. Judging by the deafening explosion from the south, there are a few less smugglers in the cave with her. Hopefully Ricky wasn't near that mess! A rattlesnake is sneaky, but it's not fast enough for this need. She needs something much quicker, and she decides to return to her real form, moulding her flesh into the guise of the white tiger and racing full speed to the north, doing all she can to make use of the side tunnels and keeping her senses sharp, hunting through the mad mixture of smells in the foul cave for those scents that matter.

The pursuing gunrunners have only a few seconds before Jet can turn the corner and evade them. As a precisely-tuned unit, they lob their grenades in her direction and begin drawing their pistols.

The explosion catches Jet with a few sizable pieces of shrapnel, but it doesn't slow the tiger in any lasting way. She races on, putting more and more distance between herself and the hunters. She focuses ahead of herself now, remembering that she has another enemy ahead, and it may or may not stand in her way. She doesn't want to use the thing that Benford has given her on loan. Using the weapons of the enemy is far from the Full Moon's ideal.

With the smugglers falling farther and farther behind, Jet races towards the feds in the north. She keeps an eye out for any sensors, then shifts her form once more, taking on the form of cardinal, using the flying form to move at a greater speed past the motion sensors.

Jet will rush out of the entrance, making a point to chirp a great deal so that the trigger-happy national guard doesn't declare it open season. Her first point is to get back to Luther and see what is going on with Ricky's side of the fun, and to pass on a warning about the mess she ran into.

---

Luther is nowhere to be found, surprisingly. However, there is a strange man waiting for Jet on the outskirts of the FBI enclave. He seems to know just where she'd stop to change shape. He's dressed casually, with an FBI windbreaker on, and his weapon is holstered. "I'm Mr. Starr," he says, revealing his presence to a surprised Jet. "I'm an associate of Mr. Blissett."

Jet arches an eyebrow at this unexpected guest. "Oh really?" She sniffs at the air carefully. Better safe than sorry, after all. "Why didn't he ever mention your name before? Why the hell did now strike him as a great time to bugger off?"

The FBI man shakes his head. "You could say that he needed me on short notice. In any case, I need to explain what's going on. There's a plant among the Border Patrol staff. John Lever. He's got a West Virginian accent but his dossier puts him nowhere near there - says Illinois."

"I know, I saw him. He was paired up with someone else, or I'd have diverted to send him packing," replies Jet. "Most of the weapons are probably in rough shape at this point. They had a bit of a malfunction. There were more of the enemy amongst them, though. I noticed three assembled. You think they'll expose themselves here?"

Starr nods. "Good work! Did you confirm that he was one of the Assembled too? How about his partner?"

"His partner seemed normal," replies Jet. "Do you think these guys are all working together, or are they working on separate projects?" It's probably too much to hope for some in-fighting.

Starr shrugs. "I don't know what those guys you saw inside will do. I have no idea what Lever will do. But I think we have another problem. You see, Schroeder - the special agent here? He's got an agenda."

"There's an investigation he has running, code-named Gepetto. There's some national-security angle to it. It started out during the plane hijacking incident. He's here because of it. He's got the idea somehow that the gunrunners were going to meet up with contacts in San Francisco. Three of them. Led by the White Rabbit. He thinks she's the local ringleader, and he's putting together a hit on the complex."

"I think the Assembled are using him as their backup strategy. Or maybe this was their plan all along - Federalize the assassination of the Sidereals."

"Mister.. Starr? Whoever the fuck you are.." Jet sounds testy, "I do a few things well. How about you do me a favor and point at who you want me to kill to make things work. I'll handle the rest. I'd prefer you not rattle this shit off to me. If you want someone to chat with, you might want to call Poe or Newton. If you have something meaningful for me to do, spit it out now."

Starr shrugs. "You're on-scene. I have nobody else to tell. I need to go derail Schroeder, that's my job. But if I fail, you guys need to link up with Xin and try to stop the Feds any way you can. That, or evacuate Wonderland."

"How about I take Schroeder and tear his arms off?" asks Jet. "That might derail him."

"That will also get you killed," observes the FBI-man flatly.

"Besides, you think that'd make the agency just roll over and say, 'oh, well, I guess it wasn't them because one of our investigators got _snuffed_ getting too close?' They'd send the Army next."

"You may have a point," replies Jet. And she doesn't mean about getting killed. The Full Moon has more than a hunch that she could take on this entire FBI army and the smugglers at the same time. If she used that power. "I'm going to get in contact with the others, but I can't waste much time." She looks at Mr. Starr seriously, "Do your job. I'll attend to my business, even if I have to raze Washington DC and devour everyone there."
