# Fall of Eden 2007-02-02

This particular variation of motel has a little balcony. No expense has been spared, clearly, and right now it is occupied by Xin. One can only take so many infomercials after all. He checks his cell, nervously, and is reassured again that it has optimal signal strength. At least, as optimal as is to be expected. In the parking lot below, the gemballa is momentarily out of place. Jack moves it, and it takes Xin a while to spot it again. _Good._ When he's sure that all seems clear, he checks back inside, mostly to make sure the raid hasn't happened yet, but there's the half-hearted hope that someone's changed the channel.

For all the boredom the infomercial induces, it keeps minds occupied. There's a knock on the door, and a panicked hush falls over the room. The whisper-soft, "...and it even cuts right through a tin can," sounds loud enough to shatter eardrums by comparison. Jack steps through the door, bearing pizzas, and does his best not to smirk at the hurried attempts to hide the panic that gripped the room moments ago. "Relax. I just thought I'd bring you guys some food. Better not to call out for it."

After a late dinner, Naomi sacks out as well. She's fallen asleep against the chairs Timothy's sleeping on, a protective expression on her face even in dreams. Jack steps back out to check on his fellow Sidereals, leaving Xin alone to hear how his hair could look better if it were a different color. Or three, or possibly spiked, no wait, braided, or maybe even in dreads.

Salvation comes in the form of John McClane. During Xin's almost non-chalant sidling towards the balcony, Nakatomi Plaza flashes across the screen. There's a little discussion of Bruce Willis' acting career, and how far he's gone (or fallen, depending on who you ask), since then. It's not long after that when the exchange of quotes starts.

Xin slips back outside as the action picks up. Drowsiness is starting to set in, and it is important to keep his energy up. He walks back and forth on the little balcony, and lets the chillier night air wake him up. There's a soft dull glow in the room behind him that flickers every now and then as guns go off onscreen.

There's a commercial on when Xin steps back inside. Germs are being annihilated by a tide of greenish-blue liquid that washes through a cheaply animated mouth, leaving it immaculate. He walks over to the bathroom and pours himself a glass of water. He adds a few of the melting ice-cubes to the little plastic cup and drinks heartily. "You should try and get some rest," he says, to whoever's still awake by this point. "It'll be hard, but, this might be your only chance for a while, so take it while you can. Believe me, if we have to wake up and go, I'll have you up and running."

"So any word on how the rabbit hunt is going?" Xin's speaking into his phone, talking to Jack who's just been in contact with the Sidereals. They're better equipped for monitoring any relevant communications, "Also, any word on whether or not we're moving in the morning or afternoon?"

"Sunup. Well just before," is the reply. "You'll want to get everyone ready in a while. I'll be by to make a show of moving the van away, you get 'em out back and ready to move when I come around."

---

Sarah's voice comes as Xin is contemplating. Everyone else is asleep, but something has kept the stuntman awake. Now he finds himself in conversation.

"Mr. Lao, are you there?" she asks.

It takes a moment to realize that he's still awake. "Yes, I'm here," is Xin's reply.

"I thought I should tell you, sir." The voice is British, and proper, and oh so earnest. "There is something going on in the Lands of Light. I'm not sure what it is, but it seems to be focusing on the flats you were occupying earlier."

"Oh. I didn't know you can sense the others who mess with the Lands of Light. Can you tell me anything more about whatever is going on over there? Um... is there anything that leads from there to here in the Lands of Light?" Xin seems a little worried, "Er, thank you for telling me, Sarah."

"I can lead you there, if you like," the girl's voice answers.

"You can? Of course you can... is there anyway to keep an eye on things here? I'd not want to leave them undefended. I suppose Jack can keep an eye on them. Lead the way then."

Sarah's quiet, prim voice leads Xin out of the motel and to the phone book at the manager's desk. He leafs through the yellowed maps of San Francisco, and Sarah finally indicates where he should go. It's a dance club called Infrared, downtown.

A taxi is easy enough to secure - nobody for a moment is thinking about taking the Gemballa - and it's a thirty-minute trip. Xin has seen this sort of thing in Hong Kong, and his ears prepare him for the auditory assault upon entering.

"This place will let us into the Lands of Light," Sarah says. Her voice is still small and young, but she's still clearly audible despite the booming trance sound. "It's special."

"I see. Well then Sarah, lead me to the Lands of Light," says Xin, looking around warily for anyone who looks dangerous. He moves in rhythm with the booming trance, "I'll do my best to keep up."

Sarah steers Xin past a huddle of tables and to one of the service doors. It turns out to be unlocked - social pressure alone seems to secure this exit. He finds another door waiting for him in the hall beyond. Past it is a storage room with banks upon banks of rack-mounted servers, switches, and other IT gear. A fairly substantial bit of computing power is being mustered here.

Xin makes his way towards the back of the room, looking for someplace as hidden away as is possible... "Alright, this should be safe enough for a while. Is there still activity over at our old flats in the Lands of Light?"

"Yes, I think so," Sarah replies after a few moments. Her voice sounds pensive. "Now, please go back out the door.."

"Alright..." Xin steps back out of the doorway, "What's wrong?"

Xin can see that he's back in the hallway from before. Sarah's voice is gone. Now, however, the doors of the hall are clearly labeled, and different from before. Odd. "TRUTH", says one. "BEAUTY" reads another. "THE WAY OUT" and "THE EXIT" are at opposite ends of the hall.

It's not everyday one is confronted with choices like these. Xin walks down the hall, moving towards, "The Way Out." Curiosity gets the better of him though, and as he passes by the doors labeled TRUTH and BEAUTY, he opens each in kind, if only to see what lies behind them.

Behind TRUTH and BEAUTY lie absolute blackness. Of course, Xin has not stepped through either. Perhaps there is more to see...

Xin looks at either door. _Nothing ventured..._ and he steps through the door marked BEAUTY.

Xin finds himself at the club. Everyone is dancing. Everyone is smiling. The goa trance playing in the background begins to spin an entrancing mathematical mandala within his mind, like a musical fractal based on powers of 2 - 4/4 time, 4 set of 4 beats, and infinite variations wrapping themselves around this simple theme.

The dancers, too, seem to be forming complex geometries as they move. The dance styles they demonstrate seem pegged to the music's distinctive sound, tying kinematics to aesthetics. It is beautiful, and harmonious, and Xin feels an overwhelming kinship. He is reminded of water, and martial arts katas, and the perfection of his stunt with the helicopter during his Exaltation, when everything _comes together_.

Xin is caught up in the reverie of the patterns as they appear throughout the club. He notices it happening not just in the dancing, but in the breathing, in the flashes of light... in everything. That feeling of everything coming together is overwhelming, and beautiful.

He becomes aware of the golden ratio, of the number of tiles in the ceiling and how all things relate to one another. He starts to walk across the dance floor, in tune with the patterns. He never moves out of anyone's way. He doesn't have to, he can see where everyone is going to move. It is glorious, and it would be easy to remain here, but the memory of his Exaltation is strong in his mind. _Someone needed me then. They need me now. I have to go._ He makes his way back towards the hallway.

Unfortunately the door is now gone. However, Xin can discover six actual doors leading out of the dance floor: Up, Down, Top, Bottom, Strange and Charm.

There is one other feature he now makes out - a mirror on the ceiling, spanning the entire dance floor. It reflects everything perfectly. Except for Xin.

Xin watches the reflection, the mirrored world in the ceiling above. _I wonder why I am not there._ While he wonders on this, he makes his way toards the door marked Strange, and he watches the effects of his movement on the mirror above.

_I could keep trying all of the doors, but who knows where that will lead... I need to get out of here, and head over to where we were staying. Sarah, are you there? Can you hear me? Can you help me get to where the activity was?_

There is no answer. As before, when a symbiont guides an Exalt into the Lands of Light, it becomes unavailable itself. Xin remembers this now, from Poe's experience. Whatever happens here, he is on his own. The comforting thought is this - whatever happens will also be guided, at least in part, by what Xin himself thinks and knows.

Xin hesitates in front of the door marked strange. He's lost in thought for a while, trying to find the connection between this place and the apartment complex that was raided earlier. When he comes out of his thoughts, he moves towards someone on the edge of all the dancing, and asks for directions to the apartments.

Six people answer, all at once, in perfect harmony. "You want to go out that door!" they say. Each points to a different door.

"Figures," mutters Xin as they point towards the doors. "Thanks..." And then he makes his way towards the door marked Bottom. _It's not much, but it's worth a shot. After all, I want to get to the bottom of what's going on around here._ He steps through.

Xin abruptly finds himself outside. The street is utterly black, but solid underfoot. No matter which way he turns, he sees darkness. Only above him is anything visible. It seems that there is a roof over his head, a semi-transparent one, with black lines and enormous letters and symbols written backwards. He sees, more astoundingly, a giant version of himself looking down at him. He recognizes now what he is seeing - he is trapped inside the Yellow Pages, looking up at himself. The larger Xin looks consternated; clearly he can see Xin himself.

There's a moment of, 'this can't be' that siezes Xin's mind. He shouts up at the giant version of himself, trying to attract his attention, "Down here!"

The larger Xin nods slowly, then looks down. "What are you?" he asks. "What do you want?"

"I could ask you the same thing, only I think I'm you. I don't know how I got here, but I need you to do something," shouts the smaller Xin. "Call the apartments."

The larger Xin shakes his head. "Sorry!" he says. "The only phone I have is this." He taps on the page, sending considerable ripples through the ceiling of Xin's world. He's tapping on a black-inked picture of a phone. But from Xin's side, the phone seems tangible. Further, it has a small but readable label: DIAL ME.

"Oh," shouts Xin. He reaches out towards the picture of the phone, testing it to see just how tangible it is. He starts to dial the number for the apartments...

Overhead, the "book" is shut, leaving Xin in darkness. All he can hear is the ringing sound of a telephone. He hears a click, the sound of static, then nothing. A sudden light gets his attention. He recognizes it as one of the lamps in the bedrooms of the apartment complex. He is there, at least in spirit. And he is not alone. Floating through the rooms are wispy blue clouds of particulate matter. Emanating from them are beams of probing light that sweep rapidly over everything in the room.

One is in the room with him; he can see another out in the hallway, passing the open door.

The instinct is to try and duck out of sight... but then the worry that the sudden motion will attract attention takes over. So Xin remains where he is... moving slowly when he must. He watches the blue clouds as they drift about, probing the rooms. _What are they looking for?_

A beam of the white light plays across and through Xin's body; the azure cloud heeds him not at all. It hisses and the sound is that of a screeching modem or fax machine; its partner outside answers. And it begins to float through the door, bobbing and weaving as it goes.

Xin tenses up when the beam of light plays across his body... but since for the moment he's not noticed... he gets up and follows after the cloud as it moves into the hallway.

Xin follows the wispy entities, watching them circulate through the rooms and communicate with each other in that familiar hissing fashion. He passes by the door to one of the open, communal rooms, and stops suddenly, for he sees a human figure standing there. The man is wearing a long black coat, black boots, and sunglasses. He is facing half toward Xin, half toward the television. He looks up.

Xin looks towards the man wearing the long black coat, boots, and sunglasses. He starts to walk slowly in his direction, sparing only a glance after the other wispy entities, making sure they're not becoming as solid as this man is...

The stranger's face is lined, though not wrinkled, and shows some signs of age and care. He is angular, well-defined, like a cowboy in some respects. He extends his hands and the wisps fly to the outstretched palms, disappearing into the skin. "Your presence is an anomaly," he announces, in a voice devoid of passion or humanity. "Resolve it."

"What kind of resolution are you hoping for," asks Xin, warily. The emotion seems heightened in contrast to the other being's utter lack thereof.

"Name and purpose," the other man answers.

"Yeah that's a good start. Why don't you tell me yours," counters Xin.

"I am Rod. My purpose is analysis of the White Rabbit complex. Identify yourself."

Xin's mind races. "I am Hub," he lies, "My purposes is analysis of operatives within this region."

"You are unknown to me," Rod announces. "I will dispatch a confirmation code to the security controller." A sparkle of blue light emanates from his hand, then races off. "Please do not leave this address."

"What purposes does my remaining here serve," asks Xin. _I should go. Now._

"Remaining here asserts trustworthiness in the security controller's response," Rod replies calmly.

"We're all fine, here, now, today. How're you? Oh hell. My name is Xin, I'm here to stop you."

"Very well." Rod gestures with his hand; another blue spark flies from it, surrounding Xin briefly. He feels an electric tingle, and glancing behind him spots a cord or wire of sorts, trailing back through the apartments. He gets the strong feeling that this will lead back to the dance club, and he can see the sparkle moving along its path.

There's a worried look on Xin's face as the spark starts to move along the wire that trails through the apartments, and it becomes clear, he's got to act now. He rushes Rod, testing out the way reality works in the Lands of Light with two very swift, yet powerful, punches.

Equations of force and motion, of momentum and kinesis, etch themselves in fiery gold letters in the air. They describe Xin's punches perfectly. Though Rod does not lift a hand, the first is negated entirely - it simply fails to connect, in ways that are not clear to Xin. The second, however, strike the man full on the face, and he staggers over.

While Rod is staggering over from the second strike, Xin tries to follow the twisting trailing cord... the one he's sure leads back to the dance club, the one he saw the blue spark take off down moments ago.

As he follows the wire through the apartment complex, Xin ducks into one of the rooms he'd been in. While most of the essential equipment has been taken from here... there's still plenty that remains. _I hope I can log in from here._ Xin finds a computer, and tries to access the dance club's website.

'Access' seems quite literal in this case; Xin finds himself back at the club, in the very IT room where he had entered. Now, however, he feels that he has returned to reality somehow. Things are back to the way they were. But is the wisp still coming for him?

_Sarah. Are you there? Can you sense if anything's headed this way in the Lands of Light?_ Xin gets to his feet and starts to stalk out of the server room. It is all too likely that this is where the wisp is going to be sent... best not to be surrounded by technology when the Assembled are en route.

"I am here now," Sarah's voice replies. "Did you have an adventure, Mr. Lao? I'm afraid I can't really feel anything."

Xin nods, as he makes his way towards the front of the servers and the switches, and then towards the door back out into the hallway. "I did. I even punched someone. I think they took offense and are on their way here now. I'm sorry you missed out, but you may yet get your part in this adventure."

"I shall look forward to it!" comes the enthusiastic young voice.

Once Xin is safely in a cab en route to the motel, he makes a call to Jack, then to the Sidereals. "So, they know we're here. Um, they may be on their way. Is everything okay?"

"Everything's fine," Jack replies. "We're cool."

"And the family?"

"They're fine too, man."

"Good. I'll be there in a bit. That was... weird." Xin leans back in the cab, trying his best to seem relaxed. _What the..._ and he remembers Sarah, _What were they doing? What **was** that blue thing?_

"I'm afraid I don't know." Sarah sounds disappointed in herself.

Things could've gone better. The Assembled know now that he could've gone into the Lands of Light to find them. It's entirely possible the blue spark was nothing more than a distraction meant to send him away... _But then why didn't he fight back?_ Xin is a little worried... but then the cab pulls into the motel. He walks up towards the room, "Well, we'll just have to be careful."
