# Fall of Eden 2007-02-16

When disturbed with her family at hand, Jet's first instinct is a defensive one. Still, she's rational enough to know that a pitched battle is likely to get a lot of people injured. For the moment, she is silent, instead drawing in a deep breath. She filters out the scent of nervousness from those around her, focusing on the scent of this stranger, her eyes mapping his movements, her ears straining for the sounds of his breathing, the quiet noises in his motions.

Xin simply watches Rod Phillips carefully. He checks for the subtle signs of recognition, after all, perhaps he would seem different in the Lands of Light... he tries to stay settled at the table, though he keeps fidgeting, either tapping his foot, or playing with the silverware, or some other little distracting gesture to channel some of that tension away.

Rod Philips has no mortal scent. But he has mortal mannerisms. He moves and shifts like a mundane human would. Jet can sense the tensions of his body acting against each other, muscles giving away and taking up slack. She can feel the casualness of his presence, noting the way his eyes take in the crowd rather than aim for reflective surfaces or other telltales of watchfulness. She sees his nostrils flare as he takes in air, notes his chest rising and falling as he breathes.

"So what can we do for you?" asks Jet. She was waiting for another to offer the pleasantries, but seeing no other volunteers, she will take the risk. She rises smoothly, moving forward to put herself between this newcomer and her family. "We had rather hoped to not have guests," she explains. "I'm afraid we are not fond of surprises."

"I understand, especially in light of recent circumstances," Rod says, nodding sympathetically. He remains standing, eyebrows raised just a hair at Jet's positioning of herself, but he makes no remark. "The FBI conducted a raid on a condominium complex a few miles away, just this evening. I've been tracking down people who were tied to the complex and a colleague of mine made me aware of your group. I'd like to schedule depositions for each of you so that we can close the case, but I wanted to introduce myself a bit more informally. I apologize if I've rained on your parade."

"No, I think we can proceed and satisfy your needs," says Jet. "Have a seat." She gestures to a chair at the end of the table and settles herself back into her own chair. "We would like to understand you better. Perhaps we might both satisfy each other's requirements and profit from this."

Rod smiles widely. He nods in agreement and takes a seat, huffing a bit as he settles in. "Great. Smells good too." He glances across the table at the mostly-eaten orders. "I didn't get to eat this good in Maryland, let me tell you.."

"Well, you could always order something," replies Jet. She's calm. At least for the moment. "So tell me, what case are you on, and what are your goals? We've met others similar to you before, but they weren't always so agreeable." Jet's hardly Benford or Poe, but she's going to try to use her brain before she falls back on her fists and teeth.

"What, other agents of government oppression?" Rod laughs lightly. "Well, hopefully you haven't had to meet other members of the Bureau. Especially on matters like this." His face darkens. "Frankly, the raid tonight concerned a major shipment of drugs and guns. I'm limited in what I can say here. But I want to answer any questions or concerns you might have. Nobody at this table is a suspect - the Bureau simply wants you as witnesses."

Xin wonders, "What can you tell us about what we're supposed to have witnessed?"

"People. Comings and goings. Anything strange or unusual." Rod shrugs. "There's specific questions that we'll have, but that will wait for the deposition. I can't really elaborate now."

Xin then asks, "Why send you in person? I mean if they're wanting to schedule a deposition, aren't there underlings and such that do that sort of thing? Not that we mind the personal attention."

"I want to reassure you all that the Bureau is just interested in the subject at hand." Rod frowns, hesitating before speaking again. "We're concerned about giving the wrong impression. We're not isolating a group or a class of people because of who they are, but because of their residence in this case." He breaks into a friendly, genuine-seeming smile. "I'm here because I want to satisfy any concerns you have."

Jet listens and does her best to keep an open mind. The 'enemy' as it were has so many strata that she can't really figure them out. It's not a very cohesive force from her understanding. That only makes her wonder, though. To a far smarter mind, it might all make sense. It reminds her of chess. She never did understand the subtleties of that game. She turns to Barry and says, "Your input would be greatly appreciated."

_Sarah, are you there? I don't suppose you have any thoughts regarding this... Mister Phillips._ Xin shifts a little uncomfortably in the seat, nudging those next to him without meaning to. "Sorry. These booths. Never quite get used to them."

Barry chuckles quietly.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Lao. There's something familiar to all this, but I can't place it.." Sarah 'frowns' inwardly. "Oh! Yes, I know. If you allowed me to, I could speak and act through you. Of course you don't want that _now_. But perhaps his symbiote is doing so?"

"Special Agent Philips, our 'group' may not always see eye to eye with the government, but I think all of us here appreciate direct contact and openness. I want to assure you that we'll cooperate with the Bureau in any way possible." Despite the cold start, Barry speaks with surety and confidence.

Rod grins widely. "I'm glad to hear that. Now listen.." He withdraws a business card from his pocket and slides it across the table - though his fingers spread, fanning one seeming card into three actual ones. "I can be reached any time, day or night. If you folks have any trouble, let me know, okay?"

Jet reaches out to take a card, "If we help you, will we have protection?" she asks curiously. Mostly she's fishing for more information, trying to draw out the conversation a little longer.

Rod's demeanor becomes correspondingly more serious. "We can't guarantee immunity from prosecution if some unforeseen twist occurs, but really, that shouldn't matter, right?" he says calmly. "The Bureau is certainly prepared to protect you as witnesses, should the need arise."

"The latter was my true concern," replies Jet. "I have heard a lot of stories about those who help the Bureau getting left to hang. My friends mean a great deal to me, and I will not allow anything to put them in danger."

Rod shakes his head. "We're trying to keep a group of very dangerous terrorists out of U.S. territory," he says, emphatically. "We're prepared to take whatever steps we have to in order to see that gets done. The safety of our witnesses, as well as anyone else involved in such incidents, is what the Bureau is all about."

Xin watches the conversation between Jet and Rod, and asks, inwards, _Is there anyway to stop the symbiote from speaking on his behalf?_

"Not that I can imagine," Sarah responds.

Jet nods and looks to Barry for a moment. "Well, we're gonna figure this out. We will likely have to contact a lawyer, just to make sure that we know whatever we're getting into. I'm sure you're used to that, though." She's hoping that they'll have some time to talk things over and figure this all out. "Oh, not sure if you can tell us, but who is this all about? We might be able to prepare better if we have some specifics to think about."

Rod shakes his head. "I'm trying to be as detailed as I can given the surroundings." He eyes the restaurant and sighs. "We can speak again in a more formal setting, alright?"

"Perhaps we could move someplace a little less crowded," says Xin, "Someplace where there's less noise to get in the way of your explanations. It wouldn't do, after all, to be confused or distracted by the conversations of others, which we can't help but overhear."

"It's a question of security," says the agent. "But I'll be happy to set up an appointment for each of you to come down to the San Francisco office."

"I'm not sure I follow. What exactly is it that is insecure," asks Xin, doing his best to look mildly confused. Given the circumstances it's not the hardest thing to do, either.

"For your safety and ours, we would prefer to meet with you in our office. We're concerned about things like eavesdropping, listening devices, laser microphones.." He ticks off points on his fingers. "We can also tape your deposition there."

"Wow," murmurs Jet. "This must be one seriously nasty fish you are trying to catch." She is doing her best to act normal about this, even if the whole thing is horribly artificial to her. This is just too weird. "We'll make the arrangements as quickly as we can."

This seems to satisfy Rod. He gets up, smiling politely. "Thank you all, and enjoy the rest of your dinner!" he calls. He turns and leaves, stopping only to buy a slice of pie to go from the counter.

Once Rod is out of sight, Jet asks, "Did he plant a listening device?" She will naturally sniff about and check as well, hunting the table and chair, thinking not like a cop, but like a thief. She knows where she'd put a bug, and is going to make sure that none are there.

Once Rod has gleft them, Xin glances around, double checking to make sure he's not lurking at the edges of sight... he waits for Jet to finish searching for listening devices before he continues.

Jet finishes her fast, but thorough search with a nod. "I've checked this well, and I see nothing left behind." She settles back down and says, "What the hell was the deal there? That was freakin' weird. Way too human. Have they learned to act that well that fast?"

"I believe it is the symbiotes. Sarah thinks he was letting his symbiote speak through him. Here, I'll demonstrate," says Xin. _Sarah, if you would, speak on my behalf. Tell these people here what you told me._

Jet and the others see a rather odd sight. The Chinese actor and stuntman bows demurely, then speaks in a flawless British accent. "Hallo. My name is Lao Xin. I am a member of the Hong Kong film industry, and a proficient martial artist." Xin grins, seemingly to himself, then continues. "Right now I am the 'symbiote' that Mr. Lao possesses. With his permission I can speak through him."

"His mannerisms have changed," observes Barry, watching with sharp eyes. "His personality is seemingly different."

"Now that's really strange," notes Jet. "So basically they.. hmm. So where is Xin now? Is he wherever the Symbiote is while it is not in control, or doesn't that mean anything?"

The voice that is and isn't Xin's continues. "Mr. Lao is here. Hello. I'm still here, I'm in control of my actions," and to demonstrate he taps out a rhythm on the tabletop, "I can feel myself acting different though. As though my mannerisms are submerged. Like being underwater almost."

"So they are both.. well, whatever you might call it." Jet's terminology needs help. "I guess this means that we can't really be sure who we are talking to when we meet them. Do you think we gave anything away? Wouldn't Rod know that we know what he is?"

Jet is aware that her family is seeing this, and is at best puzzled. It is for that reason that she regards all of this so casually. She offers a smile at Timothy and says to them with a smile, "This is all pretty confusing, I suppose. I owe you all some explanations, but it's a very long story. I promise that when I get some time tonight I'll tell it from start to end. At least as much of it as I know."

Timothy is quiet, but the girls are a bit more verbose with their reactions. "Explain it? What the hell is going on?" asks Becca. Amy and Naomi are grumbling a bit, but Michelle quiets them with a glance. "I bet that's gonna be one hell of explanation. What the fuck does the FBI want with us?" Naomi nods and points-out hastily, "It's not like I've done anything illegal." After Amy snickers a little Naomi quickly amends, "Well, recently."

"I'll explain it all," says Jet. There's something about her manner that puts an end to questions for now, though she does not raise her voice. "I'll answer all the questions later, when we aren't out in the open and have more time to talk." She looks to Barry, "Can we get some place that's safe?" Her glance flicks over to Xin, "Is there any actual advantage to throwing your voice?"

Barry nods. "We've got a place over the bridge."

"Do we have much certainty that any place is safe right now?" The question is a serious one, and Jet's interested in the answer. "These guys have a knack for dropping right on our heads."

Barry shrugs eloquently. "Get me a dartboard and a phone book and I'll lay even money on being spotted at this point. If you have a better idea, take the lead."

Xin speaks up, "There's a certain advantage, I think. It kind of makes you smooth out the rough edges," and now it is Xin's voice again. He seems more himself now. "Maybe we could keep moving?"

"If I knew a way that was better, I'd do it," replies Jet. "I'm getting damn sick of being hunted. I'd like to return the favor." With interest. "For now, I think we ought to get out of here. I don't know how we can prevent tailing, but we will have to try our best."

Jet may not be able to prevent a tailing, but she sure knows enough to expose it. She'll let the others start off and take up the rear, using the speed of her bike and knowledge of the roads to cut many times across the path of her friends, many times ensuring that no car could chase her by cruising through the narrowest of gaps before joining the others again.

The good news is that Jet's instincts were correct; she easily flushes out the unmarked sedan tailing the convoy. The bad news is that they WERE tailing her, and still are. But at least she is aware of them now. There are two men in the vehicle, with looks of boredom of their faces. Even from where she is, Jet can sense that this is something routine to them.

Jet senses the tail, but for the moment, she's not able to shake it. Still, she's hardly helpless. She slows down, letting the cars get father ahead. She makes it seem like she's screwing around, staring with great interest at a few young latino girls in a convertible. She might as well enjoy her pseudo-distraction, after all.

Jet ponders what to do. They are racing on without her. She's kinda sick of being hunted, followed, pestered.. she's really just plain pissed-off. Still, as tempting as it is to blow these guys away and be done with it, she isn't a cold blooded killer. Instead, she'll race back up to get alongside the tailing car and pulls out her lipstick. In a show of her prowess, she writes on the driver's side window of the tailing car: "Who the hell are you?"

The driver flashes a bright, eager smile. His partner, however, whaps him with the back of her hand and scowls. They exchange unheard words behind the glass and sound of the motor, and no further response is forthcoming.

Jet laughs a little at this. She pulls ahead, then drops back in place on the passenger side of the vehicle. She again uses her lipstick, having fun since these two seem to be okay. This time, the Lunar is playful and teases with a message of: "Your partner's cute." With a wink, Jet will race ahead again, easily catching up to her friends.

This prompts a visible blush from the male driver, and visible eye-rolling from his female partner. She looks through the window at Jet, face set in a pleading expression, and shrugs slightly - _come on, lady, cut us some slack here_.

---

The safe-house is safe enough, with the unmarked car across the street. Jet, Xin, Barry, Mary, and Jet's 'family' are in a two-story townhouse, relaxing somewhat. However, there's an air of tension that the Celestials can feel, and they glance at each other nervously.

Somewhere around 1 a.m., this feeling acquires tangible form. Jet and Xin can both make out the faint sounds of people gathering. Out on the street, nothing is visible. But nearer the townhouse and its neighbors, in the side walkways and driveways, there is activity.

After spending a long time just explaining everything to her family, Jet finds the distraction rather.. well, irritating. Still, it's important, and the Full Moon has to think of a useful plan. The first thing she wants to do is signal the police. She's not sure they are aware of the danger. "Anyone know Morse Code? Or sign language? I bet one of those officers will know it. I'd rather let them know that there's trouble. But only them."

Barry, conscious of Jet's actions earlier, raises his voice in suggestion. "Write on the window, Jet. You already have a rapport with the driver. Make him understand."

"That's true." Jet goes to a large window, pausing to see (as much as she can) that no other eyes are watching. Just to make really sure she has the driver's full attention she toys with the top button of her shirt, as if were about to get a bit more comfortable. Instead, she starts to write on the window. "Trouble brewing. Something in driveways and walkways. Get back-up." The Full Moon is actually more worried about the police than counting on them for help. She waits to see some confirmation of her message, then wipes it away. "Xin! You ready to stick your hand in the hornet's nest?" She's looking through the house, then she's in motion trying to block the back door with the heaviest furniture in the house.

Out the window, Jet can see the pair arguing in the car for a few seconds. The man gets out while his partner stays in the car, getting on the radio. He starts to cross the street, drawing his piece as he does and advancing cautiously.

"Well, I wonder what you have planned after we've put our hands in the nest," says Xin, who sounds a little anxious. There's a little less tension to him now though, the prospect of acting is closer at hand, he feels ready, rather than simply waiting.

As Jet works, she sees the cop approaching. It sets off every alarm in her head. She won't wait, but will spring into motion. "Xin, secure this stupid dump!" She has this feeling that he's gonna get plugged before he takes many more steps. She's racing out the front door straight-away, kicking off the bottom stair and rolling, fully prepared to be under fire. Maybe she's over-reacting, but if not, she might just save his life.

Jet's preparations are not without grounds. Perhaps a dozen shadowy figures are taking up positions around the area. As one, they raise automatic weapons and open fire.

Jet was right. She has really learned to hate being right. It's never lotto numbers for her, it's knowing when some assholes are trying to blow a hole in someone she likes. Or, in this case, blow a hole in her. She interrupts her roll mid-way, impossibly holding herself in a handstand, then kicking back again, reversing her direction and trying to draw the fire away from the man she means to save. "Get inside and get under cover godammit!"

The yammering sound of the rifles is enough to make the agent run back for his car, sliding across the hood like the Dukes of Hazzard and taking immediate cover.

Jet can make out details. In the sudden bursts of illumination provided by muzzle flash, the Lunar can see perhaps a dozen assailants. All are armed. None have any eyes or noses, though they are all wearing broad-brimmed hats and bandanas over their faces.

Jet knows that all eyes are on her. Or in this case, whatever those things use for eyes. "IT'S THE ASSEMBLED!!" she shouts out. Just in case there was any doubt. The Full Moon does not take her own advice. They are aiming at her, and that's just fine as far as the Full Moon is concerned. Nobody is as fast as she is. She knows that this is not the time to worry about cover. A light bursts around her, and she rockets on at obviously supernatural speed.

Even for Jet, this is strange, amazing. She knew, but didn't know she could do this. She moves through the midst of the windows in a blur of Silver, leaping footfirst at the outcropping of the center windows, then kicking off of this to land on the sill of a window behind her, and from there up higher still, leaping like a monkey ever higher and landing on the upper balcony.

Nine of the Assembled continue to fire, peppering the townhomes with bullets. The two agents are nowhere to be seen - they're behind the car, across the street, waiting now for backup. All of it.

Three of the Assembled, taking the opportunity Jet has provided, now rush through the open door of the townhouse.

The three Assembled also rush right into Xin, who'd started downstairs with the gunfire. It's almost a screech, the cry he makes, with hands held in close, vaguely reminiscent of a monkey preparing to leap. There's a dull thud as the Solar stomps on the bottom step and uncoils directly at the Assembled in the center of the trio, moving inside their reach, far too close for anything to be effective.

Upstairs, Barry and Mary have been efficiently and methodically attiring the girls in kevlar vests they've kept in storage. Timothy even has his own. They stand ready in case the attackers manage to get past Xin, or attempt something else.

The martial artist's hand leads the way, darting past the Assembled's defenses as Xin strikes. When the movement is completed, he draws back defensively, gesturing at the others, "If you want upstairs you have to get through me first."

The Assembled connect. Their bullets actually hit. Xin is.. unhurt. He can feel the impact, feel them piercing his skin at the highest layer, but he is not wounded.

There's a brief moment in which Xin appears to be shot... and then he exhales. The shells tumble gently towards the ground, each one a tiny golden mirror of the world around it. In one, Xin darts up the stairs a moment. Another catches the reflection of the Solar in mid-air, fists coiled tight. A third catches the first of the blows, and as it bounces off of the floor, catches the other two, accenting each with a soft, metallic, _ping_.

Xin's opponent staggers back, collapsing (but not literally) to the ground of the townhouse's entrance.

Jet doesn't have time to swear. Thought is a luxury at this point. The buttles rain on the balcony from both sides. Jet leaps up, catching herself with legs spread wide a foot braced on each column. Before they can get a bead on her, the Full Moon lets herself fall forward, spinning like a diver. She never hits the ground. Instead, she reaches both arms through a shot-out window behind her, catching herself some ten feet above the ground. Surveying the field for a moment allows her to see that her footing isn't the only one that has become tenuous. One of her enemies, so focused on firing, has neglected to pay attention to the mass of shells at its feet. This oversight sends the sniper sprawling, his weapon firing uselessly into the air as he slips on his own shells.

Jet narrows her eyes, jumping off the siding and leaving a pair of huge dents as she throws herself in a spinning leap, aiming her course towards the walls of the near townhouses. A rain of shells traces her course as she opens fire on one of the gunmen firing at her from above.

One of the Assembled stumbles, but does not fall. The others return fire, aiming their weapons in a coordinated pattern against the nimble Lunar.

The other two Assembled take no heed of their comrade's defeat. They fire relentlessly at Xin. The only hitch there is that the Solar is already moving. There is a strange exhiliration felt as Xin tumbles under the aim of his attackers. Bullets tear into the floor behind him, splintering wood with dull _thwocks_. He grabs hold of both of their gun arms, and pulls himself up, legs in a deadly V as feet head for faces.

Another of Xin's attackers wobbles unsteadily. Nevertheless they do not give up, do not relent, do not even show hesitation at the damage the fighter is inflicting.

Again Jet finds herself in the midst of a storm of screaming hot lead. The Lunar lands on one foot, lingering there for just a moment as pottery erupts into shards behind her. She can feel the wind of the bullets on her hair, sense the pattern of fire, and at the last moment, within superhuman speed, she collapses to the ground into splits, her body laying back so her head rests by her left calf.

The sleepy townhouses in the battle-site are not responding to the gunfire. Perhaps the occupants can't sleep through the sound of automatic weapons, but they most certainly can cower through it.

Jet's sick of this. Feeling a bullet slam into her shoulder only drives home the danger of her predicament. However, she's not fighting without rhyme or reason. She's the strongest, the fastest, and she's not afraid to prove it. With her left hand Jet throws herself upwards. Her feet barely touch the ground, sending her skyward in a truly collosal leap up and over the roof and over her target as well. She flips in mid-air, her gun coming out at the last moment. Her fire erupts at the enemy's back.

The Assembled are armored and hardy, but not invulnerable. Jet's weapon again finds its mark as she dares the cloud of lead that seems to surround her on all sides..

Before Xin can land, the two Assembled have drawn a bead on him. They fire, though one comes up short, and the other is leading by too much. Xin takes advantage of this, darting in the space between lines of fire, and at the last second he scissors sideways, legs snapping out with deadly grace.

Thusfar, the gunmen have acted like real gunmen - uncoordinated, unfocused, each firing where he wills. Now they abandon even this pretense, and with laser-like precision they focus their fire on Jet.

This time, there's no way for Jet to avoid damage. With so many bullets focused on her, the very air is turned into a grid, and though the protean form of the Lunar allows her to bend serpentlike over herself, it is only just barely enough to keep her from death. Jet's jacket and shirt fall away, bloodstained and shredded. _Now give me that fire, damn you!_ The rush hits her like a ton of bricks and her form bulges, her body growing huge and a deafening roar booming from her as the horrific beastform of the Full Moon is revealed. Rather than try to flip about on the roof, the Lunar punches straight downward, bashing herself an escape route into the building below.

In the air before her, Jet can see the flickering form of Hypatia, smiling as she touches hand to claw, empowering the transformation.

Jet lands below in a cloud of dust. The first thing she focuses on are the windows around her. She needs to get out of sight. With her huge size and power, she is formidible, but far from stealthy. The Lunar casts herself between a heavy entertainment center and a counter, trying to catch her breath and perhaps divide the enemy.

Jet comes face to face with a little boy, whose eyes are as big as saucer plates. He's huddled up in one corner, lips red and trembling from being bitten, tears running down his face. Less than half a minute ago, the gunfire must have started. And now he's confronted with a monstrosity.

Across the room is a woman who must be his mother, who is wearing a bathrobe. Her hair is in disarray and her eyes are as wide and frightened as her son's. She opens her mouth to try to scream, but all she can manage is a nearly silent squeak.

Jet sighs softly. It figures. Now she has two more people to protect and she's barely alive herself. "Stay low," she growls out. She gathers her strength, knowing that she has to run out into the firing zone again soon, and knowing just as certainly that it's not likely she'll see her family again. In some dark corner of her mind she prays that with her death they will be satisfied and leave the others be. _Whatever happens, I'm gonna take as many of these fuckers with me as I can._
