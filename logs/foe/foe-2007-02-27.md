The morning after the gathering at the ranch, the Exalts are preparing to leave. Benford wanders around the field with a burlap sack, collecting empty bottles of Corona. Luther and Poe are at a picnic table in the shadow of the Wonderland trailer, establishing contact procedures with Santiago.

Benford puts down his sack for a moment and stretches, going over a mental checklist. The events of the past week have kept everyone quite busy. It will be New Year's Eve in a few days, the second anniversary of his Exaltation. There are still a lot of questions to answer... and one of them is nagging at him more recently.

Benford recovers the sack and asks, "Why did you call me Dad?"

The young man is standing nearby as Benford says this; perhaps he was always there, or just appeared at the scientist's urging. But Benford is aware of no transition from absence. "That's a long story. But it's true in every way that matters."

Benford picks up a partially-full bottle, pours it onto the ground. "I didn't think I'd ever have children. The disease limited my options a lot. Does that mean you're... from the future? The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, so to speak?"

"I'll let you dwell on that," says Junior with a cocky smile. "But perhaps I can entertain you with a little explanation of _why_ I exist, not necessarily _when_. Interested?"

Benford nods. "Say on, then. The one will likely lead to the other." The scientist sits down on a convenient boulder. "It's your show, Junior."

"You - your own self, your identity, your ego, whatever you wish to call it - is a synthesis of two things. Three, if you are an Exalt. Your higher soul is the _eidolon_. It is your 'mind', your 'higher spirit', the thing that makes you cognitively you. Your lower soul is the 'body soul', your connection to your physical existence. It's tied to your physical self while you live. Both of these souls persist beyond death, in different ways. The higher soul re-enters the cycle of reincarnation, while the lower soul perpetuates through your children and your works."

"Between these two things lies the current of Essence that permeates reality, like a river flowing through your combined self. You can learn to tap it through great effort as a mortal, because you have to bend both halves of your soul toward it. But for Exalts, there is a third soul component that fuses with both the higher and lower souls. It draws the current of Essence through itself, directing it both up and down. And it unifies the two souls, making your body truly an extension of your will."

Benford shifts uncomfortably. "I've heard something like this before. The Dianetics cult believes something like that. Surely you're not telling me that they were right?"

Junior chuckles. "Infusions of Essence can make you remember your prior incarnations. And even mortals have dreams that are sometimes links to the reality they left behind - Creation."

"That's because each these souls carries a lingering element of their history. Locked away in the higher soul is the memory of your past lives. The lower soul remembers its history too - children resembling their ancestors, pets looking like their owners, and so forth. In Gaia, the principle of DNA was built to mimic this tendency in a 'mundane' fashion. But the spark of Exaltation has memories too. It stores a record of the lives of its former owners, so that it's possible to remember things your predecessors did with _their_ spark."

"Our story now comes to a very famous Solar. His name was Davron. He was an archer, a warrior, a craftsman, and a lover. Not romantic love, though, not the sort of thing you'd think of from television or Harlequin romance. He loved life. He was passionate about everything. Everything he touched should come away better than it was, he reasoned, and he applied that to his crafts, his lands, his friends, and even his own soul."

"You see, Davron had something of a dark side. In the Second Age of Man, life was exceedingly harsh and his life was no exception prior to his Exaltation. This was compounded by another problem he faced, which had to do with the spark of Exaltation he bore. The memories of its prior possessor had begun to mingle with his own, and with it came that man's personality. Unfortunately, the man in question was a Solar of the late First Age - a tyrant beyond mortal measure."

Benford says, "I remember this, from Hel's briefing." Benford recalls the odd, fantastic tale. "There was an age of great decadence. The Heros of one era became the Tyrants of the next. A common story, even on Earth."

"Davron met with the machine-god, the Primordial named Autochthon, the creator of the sparks of Exaltation. With Autochthon's help, he created soul shells. He extracted the corrupted memories of his hostile predecessor from his own spark, sealed up the damaged area, and distilled the corruption into one of his shells. In doing so he cured himself of the cursed memories that haunted him."

"The Solar Deliberative was the democratic body of the Celestial Exalted. Gaia came before the Deliberative, asking for help in fighting an invasion of her world. To aid the soldiers that would travel there, Davron constructed a modification and applied it to the sparks of those Exalted who would come to Gaia. That modification made available the past lives of the spark in the form of an avatar - for example, me. I, and those like me that your companions speak to, are composites of your former lives, created based on your imagination and your memories. We are the previous wielders of the power you now hold, and we are meant to teach you what uses that power can be put to."

Junior grins. "With me so far?"

"Very nearly. There's one thing I don't follow," Benford says. "You're using words like 'construction' and 'modification', and you're telling me a machine-god created the Sparks. I thought that the Sparks were natural, or created by the Incarna. But now... it sounds like the Sparks are machines, or at least artificial."

"Behold the mystery!" Junior sweeps his hand, and the world quite literally falls away from Benford. The young man and his 'father' stand on a plane of deep blackness, while the Earth recedes into a distant dot beneath their feet. The stars are all around them. But they do not sit motionless in their fixed places. They dance, wobbling about and pirouetting in slow motion about each other, forming patterns and chaotic shapes as they move.

Benford now perceives that something else is drawing near. It seems at first to be a perfect circle, but he grows more aware of its outlines and its scale. It is planet-sized, and he can see the faceted curves of its construction. It is in fact a polyhedron, and the closer the pair get to touching down upon it, the more faces it has. "They double as you approach," Junior explains. "When we touch down, there will be an infinite number of faces."

Benford can but gape in wonder. "A triangle is the same as a circle," he mutters, "for sufficiently large values of three."

The two land easily, and Benford feels the solid reliability of metal beneath his feet. "We stand on the surface of Autochthon," says Junior. "The Machine God, the creator of the spark of Exaltation." Nearby, a pedestal has risen from the otherwise-flawless surface. It is a glowing control panel like something out of Star Trek, and Junior manipulates the holographic buttons that float above its surface.

What he conjures up stuns the scientist into wordless shock. What appears, floating above the planet's surface in the inky black, is a stupendously large diagram. Benford can make out what might pass for circuit connections and glyphs that seem to correspond to components like diodes, if this were an electronic device. But that is only one tiny fraction of the monstrosity. It is quite literally the most complicated mechanism he has ever seen, and his mind reels at it.

"The spark of Exaltation. The vessel for the divine power of the gods, and the weapon by which Men slew the enemies of the gods," Junior murmurs. Benford recognizes reverence in his voice.

Benford staggers, but does not look away. Individual parts of the machine are discernable if he concentrates, although every blink of the eye reveals new detail, a different part. There's no way to count the moving parts, if indeed the concept of 'parts' even applies.

Benford can make out the seeming size of the diagram - several building stories tall, by his estimate.

Junior manipulates the controls; the diagram begins to turn, exposing whole new layers and depths of detail.

Benford holds up a finger, trying to estimate the width and distance of certain features, and realizes that the background of stars isn't even fixed, nor does he recognize any constellations. It looks more like dust motes in a sunbeam, than a time-lapse photograph of the sky. "This isn't Earth," he mentions. "This isn't even normal space." He glances down at the thing beneath his feet, which Junior says is Autochthon... the visible manifestation of the Machine-God himself. "But he... it... whatever... it's the size of a planet." He turns to face Junior. "Where is this, that you're showing me?"

"This? These are memories from your predecessors," explains Junior. "Not experience-memory, but knowledge-memory. The diagram that you see now is something _you know_. It was taught by Davron to the soul surgeons who apprenticed under him."

Benford does some mental calculation. "There's billions of elements to the thing... maybe tens of billions." He points at a few of them. "And each one seems to be encoding multiple signals... multiple harmonics... even multiple quantum susperposition states..." He trails off. "If this were a computer, it would have more power than the entire Internet! And it's all a single machine, under a single point of control!" He spins back toward Junior. "How long have these been running? Ten thousand years? More?"

"The sparks have existed for the Seven Millennia of mankind's existence as a civilization," Junior answers. "Many have been corrupted or turned necrotic by the fallen masters of the Underworld, but to my knowledge none have ever been destroyed."

Benford says, "And you say that this Solar, the one named Davron, had a method for modifying them, and that this projection is a matter of memory. Hmm." He stares up at the great machine for a long moment. "So that means that we once were one of those soul-surgeons. And that means we know - or may remember - the method for making such modifications ourselves. Am I right?"

Junior nods. "However! You aren't likely to get it right now."

Benford says, "Then it's a question of making the time. Which leads me to another question. Autochthon is the Machine-God, who made the Sparks. It seems a reasonable inference that our opponents, the Assembled, and their Engines, are beings of a similar nature - that Authochthon made those as well. It's like the celestial arms dealer - selling to both sides of the war."

Junior shrugs. "It's possible. Nobody really understands the motives of Autochthon, not even Davron. But we do know that he aided the Incarnae in their fight against the Primordials, by giving them the spark of Exaltation."

Benford says, "Well, that's something else, then. The Sparks were sent to Earth to help Gaia repel the invasion, and those Sparks were modified by Davron to present the Avatar interface - you, and Selber." He grins sheepishly. "I intend no offense. I like you, and I liked him, and I don't mean to imply you're mere programs." Then he's serious again. "Why go to all that trouble for the Sparks sent here? Presumably those remaining on Eden weren't all modified."

"In a word? Culture." Junior dispels the diagram via the control panel and explains. "There is no magic on Gaia. There is no history of Exaltation, no knowledge of Essence, nothing at all to guide the Chosen. Even the Solars who returned during the Second Age of Man had mentors of a sort in their enemies and rivals. Every child who could plow a field knew that magic existed, that magic worked, and the educated knew of Essence and its capabilities. Here, there is no such foundation. So a new way had to be found. That way was us."

Benford nods. "I see. I wonder, though. The Delibrative sent the Sparks, but none of their own number. So is there no other way to travel from Eden to Earth? No other way to cross this... this..." He waves a hand at the sky. "The inter-cosmos void?"

"There is one way, a way Gaia forbid us use. It has been used before. In fact, Davron and his Circle did it. Seven decades ago, they arrived in Egypt. They met a woman whose ancestor was the reincarnation of one of their number's family members. They met other people who had come here too, people whose memories of Creation they restored to find a fabulous book of sorcery."

Benford nods, his attention slipping a bit when Junior mentions that the method was forbidden by Gaia. He perks up again when Junior mentions the book of Sorcery. "Wait. Was that book located here? On Earth?"

Junior shakes his head. "The _Book of Three Circles_ was hidden in Creation. But finding its resting place required the memories of a man whose soul had reincarnated here on Earth."

Benford sighs. "Well, it still might be worth a trip. Maybe there's other Gaian artifacts that made the trip. And Hel said that the African Sidereals had been rather... uncooperative. The chance to make contact now might head off trouble later."

Junior smiles. "You can certainly investigate if you wish."

Benford says, "Well, you know me," the scientist grins. "I'd like to investigate everything, but I'm too busy saving the world."

At this, Junior gets a gleam in his eye. He leans forward, grinning widely. "Show me your world, dad. Show me the world you want to save." He gestures out toward the starfield.

Benford considers the request for a few minutes. "We start with what is," he begins, "and we want more than that. We can show people what happens if they work together. There's Axel's way, through mass conformity, but that misses something... something important. We can do it another way - one good choice at a time. We proved that last night."

Junior shakes his head. "Don't tell me! _Show_ me!"

Benford thinks about the world he lives in, and the lives that were in such sharp focus last night. A hundred thousand people, and a hundred times more than that in the world beyond. He couldn't begin to comprehend the magnitude from his academic's ivory tower, and yet, in the last year, he's come to understand a cross section of the world: the grand metropolis of New York, the small towns of the rural South, the crazy border towns of Tijuana and Juarez. All full of people. Some live in riches; some live in squalor. Most just want tomorrow to be better than today.

The images from memory cross in the skies overhead, flickering into clarity like the image of the Spark, then fading to be replaced by another, related memory. The pub near his father's house in Norfolk. Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco gives way to the Tenderloin; that gives way to an alley in Juarez, choked with garbage; and that gives way to troubling flashes of the raid on the Juarez mansion. "All. All of these. All these people, and the way they live. That is what we seek to save. And we seek to offer them something, a chance at heroism..."

Benford considers the world, and realizes that heroism has always been with man. He realizes that what's missing isn't the quality of heroism, but a place for it to grow, unfettered by petty considerations of survival - food and water; storms and plagues. "Our minds have solved the petty problems," he declares, and new images form in the sky: the vast, automated farms of America's midwest; wind farms on the California coast; genome maps from the pre-Exaltation treatments of his own disease. "And we can do better still." Now, an image of a giant, pyramidal building, a thing made from the precise mathematical arrangment of trillions upon trillions of carbon atoms in a frame a quarter of a mile tall. The vast structure towers over a body of water, perhaps New York Harbor, but the shores around it are green and verdant, the old cities of man given back to nature, and once again filled with birds and beasts.

The core of the structure is a giant crystal cylinder, glittering in reflected sunlight, generating power through the simple expedient of air rising from sea to sky - a cheap and natural process with no pollution. A million people live within the single building, among parklands and clean air, travelling via tubes built into the very fabric of the pyramid. The airspace around the pyramid buzzes with small aircraft, hovering on the breeze like dragonflies. Some flit towards the shore, where the blue ocean turns into a sea of greenery. Man lives in his giant arcologies, and the forests are running rampant as they did before industry came to these shores.

Benford and Junior are now standing within this structure. They are near one of the egress points, in fact. Junior leads the way, and Benford finds himself outside. On Earth, perhaps, but no Earth that yet exists. Every detail around him is flawless, meticulous, complete. There is a swamp-like mire, and he can see two people wading through it in everyday clothing. Perhaps it is more, since none of the grime seems to be sticking to the pair at all. They draw closer. He recognizes himself, and Hypatia. The couple are arm in arm, laughing and talking to each other. "Nanotechnological clothing," Junior murmurs. "Repels mud, insects, germs, and everything else that makes nature 'icky'. People feel good about living outdoors."

The couple step up onto a winding path that leads to the door, passing by Benford and his 'tour guide'. They are indeed spotlessly clean, and Junior leads the way back into the pyramid. The couple follow a set of pathways that lead through the city, each time moving faster and faster as they are propelled by the surface of their pedestrian's road. Benford recognizes the sci-fi concept, and Junior supplies the name, at the same time: "slidewalks". "Would you like to see where you live?" Junior asks.

Benford grins. "Sure, why not?"

Benford looks around, noticing the color of the sky and the expanse of littoral plains around the city. "Is this Earth? If it isn't, how did we get here? Does Essence cosmology even allow other stars? Other worlds?"

"This is Earth. This is the future Earth that you've created. The Earth that lives in your mind." Junior smiles. Benford's alter ego and Hypatia have reached a little cottage. Junior leads Benford inside.

The scientist finds that there is someone else living here. He's a little boy, with blonde hair like Junior's, wearing glasses like Junior's. He could be ten years old. He rushes forward, giving the other Benford and Hypatia a big hug, and the two adults return it fervently.

"I am the son born into your utopia. I am the son who will enjoy the fruits of your work. I will live in the perfect world you want to bring about, because what good is saving the world otherwise?" Junior smiles gently at his 'father'. "You have already created me."

Benford sniffs, feeling his eyes mist over. The flood of emotion is a lot for the scientist. "I never dared imagine the future before... I mean really imagine it, with me in it. I've been living so long on borrowed time." A single tear of joy rolls down his face, and more follow, in spite of himself. "And that's the point, isn't it?" He throws his arms around the image of the older Junior. "Thank you. So shall it be," he whispers.

Junior responds. And he feels warm, and solid, and real.

Benford finds himself back on the field. No time at all has passed, it seems. He's holding a beer bottle in his hand. Around him, things are as they were. But he can still feel the thrum of Essence, the vibrations of the land and the pulse of destiny. He can still feel the motion of the planet. And he can guide it to where it must lead.
