Dreams.

For some, they are mere flights of fancy, diversions and leftovers from a mind far too complex for its own good. For others, the land of dreams is full of terror and doubt. This night one who is no stranger to horrible dreams is once again far from peaceful.

In the land of her own mind's making, Jet finds herself rising suddenly from rest. She is naked and the wind is cold. At her feet, waves crash from the sea. Stunned and terrified, she stumbles back, her eyes coming to focus on an elaborate torii that the night has turned an almost luminous shade of silver.

The torii stands amidst the waves, and looming behind it is the moon, the orb far more vast than it ever has been in the waking sky. Though she has never been here, the words come from her lips as naturally as breath, "Itsukushima Jinja...?"

Even as Jet stumbles further into the water, making for the torii, a voice cuts through the air that is at once gentle and authoritative. "Little one, didn't I teach you not to gape?" For a moment, Jet is stunned, she knows that voice.

"Oba-chan!" In that moment, the woman that is Jet vanishes, replaced by a young, bright-eyed child who climbs up on the water with a childish grunt of effort and darts to the torii. The child races around the gate with joy shining from her face. "Oba-chan, doka ka?" she shouts out loudly, immediately breaking into a fit of giggles.

The child pauses to listen, but for some time no answer comes. Charity stomps a foot. "Oba-chan! Oba-chan, doka ka?!" she cries out. There is no laughter this time, but a growing anxiety is revealed. Again and again she calls out.

Finally, the exhausted child rests her arms against the torii, hiding her face against them, giving her tears to the sea. Her soft sobs mingle with broken phrases of sadness that build into resentment.

"Why are you crying?" a voice asks softly.

The child doesn't turn away from her tears, and her answer is an angry one, full of resentment. Finally, she mutters softly, "I can't find my Oba-chan!"

"Have you forgotten everything that I told you, little one?" asks the same voice. "How can you not find me? I am in every sunrise, every beam of moonlight, I am the smile you wear too seldom these days. I was there for your first kiss, and I will be there when you feel the pains of giving birth."

"Oba-chan..?" The child is gone. When Charity rises, she is a woman once more, her cheeks soaked with tears, and her voice cracking. There is little for her to see, however. The torii stands lonely against the brilliance of the moon and around it the waves of the ocean continue their endless race up and down the shore.

"Yes, child. Don't you know my voice?" The wind brushes through Charity's hair and the woman smiles. "There. That is my little one's smile. You have forgotten everything, haven't you? Do you really hate me so much? You don't even remember how to speak Japanese!"

Despite the hard words, Charity laughs softly, brushing away her tears. "I was so lost without you, Oba-chan. Everything was so horrible and I was alone." The crashing of waves kicks up a strangely warm mist that brushes against Charity's forehead like a kiss, and the wind moves around her like an embrace. "The time was right for me to go on, little one. Besides, I've never left you. It was you who left me."

Charity doesn't deny it. "Still, I must forgive you. You at least remember where you are. I didn't grow up far from here, you know." That voice leaves Charity tingling. To hear her grandmother again after so long. "Oba-chan, I'm so sorry that I've forgotten Japanese. I feel like I've failed."

"You have," is the gentle reply. "But you have time to correct your mistake. Come with me." Charity sees noone, but feels a tug at her hand, leading her again across the waves and over the shore to a small pool of water. "Do you remember what to do, little one?"

Charity smiles, beaming up at the sky. "I do remember. I remember!" She reaches down to take the ladle, pouring it over her hands and cleaning them. She then dips it once more into the water and pours water into her cupped hand. This water she uses to cleanse her mouth. "Good, at least some of what I told you is still in your head, even if you've muddled so much of it."

The voice remains kind, even when it's lecturing. "You have forgotten yourself. You've been so caught up in this business of being a Lunar that you are completely messed-up." Charity feels herself being inspected, her hair lifted by the wind. "You need to remember who you are. You must remember where you came from, little one. You are a woman now. You must act the part."

"I will do my best to make you proud, Oba-chan," replies Charity gently.

"Then remember that we are a gentle family. We always loved each other and helped each other. I'm not sure I approve of this taking on of strangers, but they put your heart in the right place, and propriety is nothing compared to that. There is something I must ask of you though, child."

"I will do whatever you ask of me, Oba-chan," replies Charity.

"Then be Japanese, child. Don't turn your back on this land. This is your home, this is the birthplace of our people."

Charity looks uncertain about this, but she claps her hands together. _I wish to be Japanese._

"Oh, and one other thing. Laura should be Japanese, as well. That good for nothing son-in-law of mine will not wash my spirit from any grandchildren of mine!"

Charity actually laughs at this. "It will be as you wish, Oba-chan. We will both be Japanese. I just have one question-"

"No more questions, child. You must find answers now. You have friends who will guide you, and I will be all around you, if you just see."

"But Oba-chan.. wait! I have to ask you something!"

"No more questions, child. I must hear your answers now."

"I have a ques-!!!" blurts out Jet as she sits up in bed, "..tion." She sighs softly and scrubs a hand across her face. "How do I become Japanese?" she mutters to herself. "How can I ever help Laura when everything is such a mess?"

There is a calm-looking man hunched down nearby. He has long, silvery hair and violet eyes. Jet recognizes him as the Lunar elder of one of her past visions, but she sees him now just as she did the feral beastwoman. "Good morning, Jet," he says in greeting.

"My name isn't," murmurs Jet, just catching herself. She looks confused. "Jet. That's my name. But where am I? Am I still dreaming?"

The Lunar gestures around. Jet discovers that she is actually out in the open. She's huddled up behind a pile of stones. The world becomes suddenly noisy, and she recognizes the sounds of a freeway overpass. The smell of exhaust finds its way into her nostrils.

"You're awake. But you're confused. That's why I'm here," the violet-eyed man continues. "You find yourself caught between worlds. Man and beast, west and east. Killer and caretaker."

"I get lost a lot," admits Jet. "Not just like this. God.. I'm going to get someone hurt if I don't get this under control." She reaches up to rub at her neck, "How do I find the balance?" she asks. "Do you know what I've been dreaming? If so, you should know that I will keep that promise."

"When you find the balance, it will be like discovering a secret that was always close to you," the Lunar says. "You travel a thousand miles to find a valuable trinket, only to reach into your pocket and find that you already had it. You will discover it among your friends, your lovers, and even your enemies. You must come to know them all."

"So what are you suggesting?" asks Jet. "I feel like I don't have the time to spend hunting around. My friends and family need me now. How can I help them if I can't even solve my own problems?"

The Lunar looks somewhat puzzled. "Why do you think that solving their needs and solving your own aren't the same thing?"

"I feel like my problems get in the way of helping others," replies Jet.

The man shakes his head. He begins speaking in a slow cadence, audible even above the traffic that speeds by. "'I am Jet. I live a tumultuous life, for I am never fully satisfied. My closest friends trust me to keep my word. They sometimes feel uncertain around me, for they sense my power. But they stand by me, for they know that power will be used to protect them. They fear me, and they respect me, because that is the nature of the tiger.'"

"'I show mercy to the enemies who have need of it, and I show none to the rest. My enemies fear and respect me, because that is the nature of the tiger.'"

"'I show my body for money, but it is my own to control. I share my heart only when I wish it. I show my dreams to those who have a place in them.'"

"'My life is the product of hate and love. I will understand these things. I will keep them close to me. I will master them both.'"

The Lunar smiles. "Is that not who you are?"

"It seems to be true," replies Jet. "I think there may be more to it. It seems like I'm very simple." She laughs gently at herself and then asks, "So if that's all true, why am I confused? It shouldn't be so hard to be who I am."

In response, the man holds up a mirror. In it Jet can see her face reflected. Her hands are pure and clean and flawless, human hands. But her face has changed, subtly but in a very specific fashion. The epicanthic folds of her eyes and other ephemeral details of her face have sharpened to reflect a stronger Japanese character. She can reach up and touch her altered features, confirming the truth of the reflection.

"Mastering hate is not pushing it away. Nor is mastering love. These things hover near to your heart. You must recognize the necessity of all that you are, Jet. You must see the usefulness of every part of you. Even the things you wish had not happened. You must master them all."

"Of the two, love scares me more," admits Jet. "It's so easy to deal with those I hate. It's love that is fragile. I have a family now, but I don't have the wisdom of a child. Yet for all my fighting and denying, I love them like children. It's odd. When I first met Timothy and had him follow me around, I was really upset and angry. Now I would rather die than give him up."

The Lunar nods. "Just so. Now, return to your friends. You will remember the way if you allow your instincts to find it."

Jet rises and looks back to the Lunar. "I think I'm ready to be Charity again," she says quietly. "And now it's time to get back." She lids her eyes and draws the wind into her lungs. "We will meet again, I hope." With that, she races into the night, not thinking of where she was, nor even where she is going. For her, all attention is on where she is and what she is doing.
