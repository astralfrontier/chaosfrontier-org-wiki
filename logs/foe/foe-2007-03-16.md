# Fall of Eden 2007-03-16

The FBI has branch offices in every major city in America, and most of the minor ones. The Federal branch of law enforcement must cover the country; the headquarters in D.C. is more of a bureaucratic appendage than the head of the tentacled beast, and Special Agent Schroeder has everything he needs to interrogate five civilian witnesses to a baffling series of crimes. He has everything he needs to debrief two confused and badly shaken special agents as well, and the authority to do so.

He listens carefully to their stories, collating data on reams of notebook paper in a crisp, clean writing style. He sifts through the facts as they are presented by seven human beings, listening to what they have to tell him, outwardly keeping his composure no matter what outlandish claim is made.

He knows, for example, that three Houston strippers came west with their friend after being attacked out of the blue by MS-13, a South American megagang known for the slayings of several DEA agents and other government officials. He knows that Timothy was adopted from Colombia and has his father's arrest report available - on a drug charge.

He knows that a Seattle girl was invited to move south with a tough but compassionate biker, a woman who spoke with a Texas accent and whose face has Asian qualities. And he knows, most importantly, that two FBI agents claim that they called quite strenuously for backup, and that no such calls are logged in any law enforcement computer in San Francisco.

Schroeder isn't the sort of man who gives up easily. He or the San Francisco agents he works with have contacts among local law enforcement. He interviews officers. He speaks to a neighborhood gossip who listens to her police scanner religiously.

What he finds very much surprises him.

---

Barry hasn't been able to stop smiling. Most of the Celestials have broken up into smaller groups, pursuing other matters. Morgan and Benford left Ricky and Mirya in Mexico with Saint Death; Tijuana is now in their hands. Jack has offered to give Xin a lift - he apologizes that he must leave on something important, but does not say what. Luther has disappeared again, saying only that he is interested in playing "whack-a-mole".

Meyer has emerged from hiding, cackling like a maniac but not explaining what he finds so amusing. He and Mary inform the group that they'll be heading to Los Angeles. This leaves Barry, Benford, Morgan, and Jet.

And even with this small group, Barry can't stop grinning. "It's beautiful!" he keeps saying, as he commandeers the group into joining him at a restaurant for lunch. A few days have passed since the apartment incident, and Jet's 'family' is on everyone's mind.

There's a large, beautiful Chinese restaurant on Geary Boulevard, several blocks from the FBI office. Barry drives the group there, managing to arrive just in time to get the perfect parking spot.

He enters the restaurant a little ahead of the Solars and Lunar, smiling at the bright-eyed hostess who is just now welcoming Special Agent Schroeder into the restaurant.

"Reservations for five please," announces Barry, patting the FBI man on the back. He visibly flinches, wheeling to stare at his surprise host and companions. A look of recognition comes over his face, a quite visibly shocked expression of world-changing realization. "It's you guys," is all he can manage. Barry artfully steers him past the hostess and toward a table.

"Didn't expect to see you again," says Jet evenly. She doesn't flinch, seeing now some purpose in this not-quite-a-coincidence. She trusts her friends and herself enough not to be worried by Barry's move. "This should be very... illuminating."

Benford hasn't met Schroeder before, but is more than able to put the pieces together. _Oh, hell._ "Perhaps we should be seated. Some of us may find this easier to understand with the cocktail menu in front of us."

"There's no way that you guys followed me here," Schroeder says, _sotto voce_, as everyone sits down. "This place isn't on my calendar. I grabbed a phone book and chose a place nearby. I _know_ I wasn't followed, but I was looking for you people, and you found me. How?"

"Call it your lucky day, Schroeder," says Jet. She looks to Barry with a smirk. The Lunar wonders if he's going to be stuck that way. Still, Jet's focus will be on Schroeder, since Barry is still on cloud nine. "It seems we were meant to find each other. The question I have for you is simple. Now that you've found us, what do you mean to do?"

"Your friends are Federal witnesses," Schroeder says, still sounding shocked but managing to rally himself somewhat. "I'm trying to figure out who _you_ are. Some kind of vigilante, super-agent, or what. But most importantly, are you Pinocchio, or Gepetto?"

"Both, you might say," replies Jet. "And those aren't just friends." She maintains a calm attitude, somewhat aided by the thought that her family is safe. "I'm not sure if I'm a super-agent, though I am open to job offers. For now let's say we're concerned citizens of the world, interested in improving the lives of all humans. Tell me, Shroeder, are you a god-fearing man?"

Schroeder frowns. "I don't really go to church," he says, uncomfortably.

"It's funny," Benford murmurs, "how often people confuse faith with observing ritual. "Under the circumstances, Mister Schroeder, your question is remarkably apt, and deliberately so. Tell me, in your opinion, how fit a metaphor is 'watch and watchmaker'?" The scientist studies Schroeder's reaction.

The agent nods. "Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.... That machine on the international flight. It all started with that. Maybe even machines pretending to be people, huh? Is that what you all are?"

Benford recalls the incident, remembering the encounter with Mister Bland. He doesn't try to hide his disgust. "No." And then, more conversationally, "I'm surprised you're prepared to accept there are such things."

"Well what do you expect?" the FBI man asks angrily, though still quietly. "We pull a device off the plane. We think it's junk, only one of our guys looks at it, says 'this could work'. So we go back and study it. One guy had to take a six-month vacation from that project. But we figured it out. No kind of science on this planet could produce that, know what I'm saying?"

"Intimately," Benford mutters.

"Look, I'm not stupid." Schroeder sighs. "I don't care if someone claims Mossad, Al Quaeda, and the KGB all got together to really mess with the British. But you _can not_ build a bomb like that! You can't."

"You're right, Mr. Schroeder. It _does_ seem unnatural." Morgan leans back and puts his hands behind his head. "So... now you see what we're up against."

"Then? What are you in all this?" the man demands.

Jet looks around very slowly. She watches the room with eyes that for a moment shift and distort, distinctly birdlike as she takes in her surroundings, momentarily catching sight of a bead of condensation sliding down a soda can in the hands of a biker flying by outside. When she's satisfied with her study she turns back to Schroeder. "We are the only thing that can stop them," she says simply.

"Fine. What's 'them'?" he asks. "And don't screw with me. I don't care about that invulnerable badge your friend flashed in New York, Dr. Benford. I'll take your asses downtown and keep you on ice for so long you'll start growing fur."

Morgan can't resist the urge to glance at Jet for a moment at Schroeder's remark at growing fur, but does manage to suppress a smile. Instead, he turns the glance into a question - although, from Jet's words, he already knows the answer. She is ready to level with Agent Schroeder... and so is Morgan.

Jet sighs softly. To her, the world moves in perfect time, she hears the conversation of a mother and her child through the front doors, she can detect the boredom of the young woman with her date across the restaurant, she counts out the footsteps of the waiter as he heads to the kitchen. In this moment of clarity she knows what she must do, and with the guidance she's been given, she even has the wisdom to do what she must do.

"The truth is, sir, that some of us grow fur when we please," says Jet. She reaches across the table, her palm open. She blinks, and in that moment knows that no one is watching. In that brief time her hand shifts, fingernails extending to fierce claws, digits become powerfully thick, and skin is furred white with black stripes. Just a moment, and she taps Schroeder's hand with a nail, so he can feel it. The moment passes. "The truth is that everything you know about the world is only a small fraction of the real story."

Schroeder nearly jumps out of his chair. Barry, however, is there to steady him with a surreptitious hand on the chair back. "They could show you another sign, a sort of badge of authority," he now comments. "But I think you've seen something like it. Not exactly like theirs. You remember, right?" Schroeder looks like he's been hit with a hammer.

Benford notes what Barry is saying, and sighs. _So that's how it is._ "Mister Schroeder, we're not interested in feeding you bullshit. In fact, I'd like to tell you everything you want to know. I'd really love to, and I'm not going to lie to you today. However. Consider what you've seen. Whatever you think you know, your superiors do not want to hear it, much less the general public. So before we continue, answer something for me: do you _really_ want to know?"

In answer, Schroeder opens his coat and pulls out a notebook. He lays it out in front of Morgan, opened to a particular page.

On that page, Morgan and the others can plainly see a self-portrait, a rough pencil sketch of the FBI man himself. On his forehead is a Caste Mark, unlike any the Celestials have seen before. Next to this on the page is a larger diagram of the mark, clearly and distinctively sketched, with a few hand-written notes accompanying it.

"Fine," he says. "What is _this_?"

Benford's jaw drops, his affected smarminess blown away in a moment. "Einstein's Bloody Eyeballs. Where did you see **that**?"

"It was on my _face_, Jack," replies Schroeder.

Morgan blinks at the drawing, making no effort to hide his own surprise, but eventually nods slowly. "In that case, I think you _do_ want to know the answers." He glances up at Benford, inclining his head.

"This is the caste mark," Benford begins slowly, "of a Terrestrial Exalt with the elemental aspect of Water, and I have never seen one before." He pauses. "It's supposed to be hereditary, but I think the environment wasn't right for it to express until quite recently. And I withdraw my question. Obviously, you have to know, like it or not."

The agent lets out a long, drawn-out sigh. "You know, a month ago I'd have told you that you were nuts. Alright. Then you aren't either Pinocchio or Gepetto. That means I need more information. I'm gonna cut you guys slack here. But you owe me now." He points a finger at each member of the group. Barry is the first to nod, still smiling. "I think everyone here wants to foster a spirit of cooperation," he says.

Benford says, "I am at your disposal in this matter," Benford assents. "However, I will be very interested in how you intend to present this to the Director."

Morgan nods in agreement to the agent. "Mr. Schroeder, a few months ago, I'd have told me I was nuts too, if it helps. But it's hard to deny the truth when it's... well, staring you in the face."

Schroeder thinks a moment. "Alright. Get your guy with the fancy badge to flash it again. Take it off the FBI's plate. Move it out of our jurisdiction entirely. That'll do it."

Benford nods. "As far as I know, the fancy badge is legitimate, by the way. One of the first things you should know, the marionettes are experts at forgery and infiltration, especially of electronic systems... not so much 'identity theft' as 'identity fabrication'. You already know their capabilities with mechanical systems, so I doubt that will surprise you."

"Funny you should mention that.." Schroeder briefly recounts his story, stopping only to finally order food now that his appetite has returned.

The FBI was in charge of the investigation of the airline bomb. Somehow they got ahold of the device itself. Schroeder, taking the investigation seriously, began to investigate other technology-related incidents, casting his net widely indeed. Anomalous readings at a physics lab, followed by the disappearance of the physicist to a cure for paralysis which nobody else seems to have participated in. And so on.

Other incidents, too, led him and like-minded investigators from other agencies in other countries to conclude that some sort of highly-advanced agency was acting on the world stage. Without further data, the groups could only treat this as an intelligence-gathering matter for the moment; hence, Project Gepetto.

---

Once the gears of bureaucracy begin to turn it does not take long for Jet to be led to those she desperately wants to see. Her family is kept in a safe house, protected carefully by people Schroeder trusts. As she is led to meet them she says, "I owe you more than one."

Though her family is far from relaxed, Jet's body language makes it clear they are safe. She scoops up Timothy and hugs him, and then finds herself wrapped in the arms of Becca, Michelle, Naomi, and Amy as well. "You're safe now," replies Jet. "Everything is going to be okay, I promise." Come hell or high water, Jet will make it okay. There is a sense of family and love that rolls of the Full Moon in waves, breaking down the usual barriers of those she counts as family, her children and little sisters.

Benford and Schroeder stand apart from this tender reunion, watching in silence. Benford chews his lower lip, then says, "They're going to be a few minutes, I think. Perhaps we should talk." He motions down the street, indicating the quiet residential neighborhood.

"I want to make something clear," the scientist begins. "This is a difficult situation. We feel like our world is under threat. We're not clear on how, or from whom. We think the marionettes, to use your metaphor, are part of the problem, but that's not known for sure. The entire matter is intractable to the solutions usually used by governments. It crosses borders, exploits weaknesses in the fabric of our society, and threatens the entire world." Benford pauses. "I'm sure this all sounds familiar, because this isn't the first time we've heard talk like that in this century."

Benford continues, "Now, I personally believe that the reaction to 9/11 was overblown. When you come right down to it, ordinary criminals and cigarettes are more of a threat to life and property than all the suicide bombers ever born. If America had dumped the money spent on Iraq into power plant research, I wouldn't need to invent nuclear fusion. However, this situation," the scientist waves a hand in the air, encompassing the entire world in a gesture, "is very real. And it brings up the same question. Do we respect the Rule of Law and the Rights of Man? Do we take our risks and walk through the storm? Or do we hand it all over to dictators, malign or benign, and trade liberty for security?" Benford motions at Schroeder. "You're a Federal Investigator, the elite of American law enforcement. What is your professional opinion?"

Schroeder shrugs a little. "You know, this is all overwhelming me," he manages at last. "But the rule of law? Or tyranny, or any of that stuff? Man, we don't think about that. Let me tell you what it's like."

"It's a job. We get paid. We have a paycheck. A lot of these younger guys, they come into it thinking they're gonna be the cowboys. They think they're gonna save the world from Osama bin Laden or Tim McVeigh. They figure it's a big showdown of good versus evil. Well it's not."

"I have this huge monkey on my back called the Federal government. We have fifty states and half a dozen territories that we have some kind of jurisdiction over. And you know what? When we get called in to help somebody out, it's not 'oh great, a fellow law enforcement agent'. It's, 'hey, it's the FBI, well, we don't need you 'cause our dicks are this big.' They act like you want to sleep with their sister."

"And on top of that, you hear about traffic cops having a quota? The black and whites have to pull over so many cars in a month? It feels like that, only we have to grease some politician's knob before election time. 'Law and order'. They don't care about keeping crime down. They _want_ the big arrests, because nobody thinks the system works unless you're busting someone's chops."

"Except - except! - we have to follow the rules. We can't make a righteous bust 'cause we _know_ the guy is guilty. We have a chain of evidence. Unless! It's something important."

Schroeder turns, now staring Benford right in the eyes. "You know that flap about the U.S. attorneys last year? Well, maybe _you_ don't. But listen. It's like that every day. It's a job we do. We try to do what's right, only we can't, because the people above us don't really want us to succeed. Maybe we'd be busting them or their friends. Or maybe we'd be hurting something they need. Meanwhile, nobody _else_ knows what we do or how hard it is, so they think they're just dicking around. So you tell me what the Rule of Law has done for me here, Jack."

"It sounds like it's not the law that's hindering you here," Benford mentions evenly. "It sounds like inevitable prejudices and power games are what's getting in your way."

Schroeder sighs. "Who the hell is gonna uphold the Rule of Law, if not the very same guys playing these games, huh?" he asks.

"That is the problem," Benford continues. "Games get played, laws get broken... meanwhile the world goes to Hell, and anyone who wants to save it is forced to tear up the rule book and bury it in a bog. By some measures, you should take me, Jet, Jet's friends, and lock us all up for life, and that's just for the traffic violations. I'm not happy about that. I'm not one of your cowboys fresh out of Quantico, we're not in it to kick in doors and bust heads."

"We're not cops," Benford finishes. "When you come right down to it, we're guilty of a lot of things. I personally don't believe that Exaltation makes us morally superior to any other person, and I can't help but feeling that someday we'll have to answer for what we've done. On the other hand, we can't stop. We won't. So what do you suggest we do?"

Schroeder holds out a hand. "That's not for me to figure out," he replies. "I know what I've gotta do. And I've gotta keep my job long enough to do it. We need to have a long and serious pow-wow about this whole business before I can give you any kind of direction."

Benford nods. "I just wanted you to understand my concern. Right now, being Exalted is like being in the FBI. You have a job to do. Nobody thanks you for it, and no good deed goes unpunished. We may be able to change that, before we're done... but for now, the most we have is that we're very competent, and we're trying, we're trying very hard, to do the right thing."

---

Luther provides the required credentials upon his return, and Jet is also reunited with Ana. Roger Wolf Pads is still with her, and the girl is smiling radiantly and beautifully - a sight which Jet finds revitalizing.

The spook has something else, as well.

"I've been in limited contact with the Shadow Synod," he explains. "Human channels - no direct telephone link. They apparently have received word of someone or someones calling themselves 'Klein', claiming that they are 'like us' - Exalted, presumably. They say they were affiliated with the Chaos Computer Club in Germany. They further say that they've discovered something very interesting on the telecommunications network and want to discuss it. Naturally this dovetailed with what we already know. I think the Synod will accept."

Benford says, "We have an need for a secure communications system. It sounds like this 'Klein' could help us with one. We should follow up immediately, especially since we may need to do some travelling soon."

Jet hears what is said, but she's more interested in Ana. She is glowing. This is as close to perfect as things have been in Jet's recent life. "You look radiant, Ana. Seeing you like this brings me so much joy." The Lunar looks to Roger and smiles, "Thank you, big brother. It seems you are always helping me."

---

Luther sits at a laptop in the trailer. Surrounding him are the other Celestials, guns and other weapons drawn warily. Luther is simply using email, on a new laptop purchased recently from Best Buy on one of Meyer's more obscure credit cards. Matters should be as secure as they can be.

He is apparently conducting a chat session of some kind with 'Klein'. The text is in German, until finally Luther issues a simple line of text: 'Auf Englisch Bitte'. Klein complies.

Klein: "I think you are wanting the Voice-Over-IP through TOR, the Onion Router. Open technologies. No proprietary interface. Invisible on the wire. Further, you can use the WTLS security layer on your telephone. I will make it possible. We will need to rig your phone's cards appropriately, because conventional crypto may not be enough. We wish to use one-time pads for serious communication."

Benford considers this. "That's interesting, but hardly more than a mortal could do. We're dealing with exceptional opponents. Can you ask him what he means, when he says that they are 'like us'? Can he authenticate that claim?"

Luther types in Benford's concern.

Klein: "I have seen this thing which they call 'the Lands of Light'. I will demonstrate if you wish."

"That," Benford emphatically states, "would do nicely."

Klein: "Dr. Benford, Mr. Morgan, the sites of your Exaltations are both holy places. There are temples erected in the Lands of Light. Dr. Benford, it is certain that the CERN facility is being co-opted by some agency, which your people dub 'the Assembled'. I have learned its name. The Lord's Holy Cathedral is the temple built on the Large Hadron Collider."

Benford says, "Distressing, but curious. I wonder why the Assembled would consider the site of Celestial Exaltation to be a holy place. Ask him what he knows about the portal Xin encountered in San Francisco."

Klein: "I do not have data on that site. There are.. protections."

Benford says, "I want to trust him, but I don't know if I should. Luther, how certain is the Shadow Synod that he's legitimate, and not simply one of the Assembled posing as a human?"

Luther shrugs. "He refuses to meet. We would need to resort to astrological measures to be sure, I think. I'm certain the Synod is already putting such steps together."

Benford says, "Alright. Let's trust him, for now, but ask him this: how did he Exalt, and what can we do to help him?"

Klein: "I refuse to discuss the details of Exaltation. As you are certainly aware, there is some mutual distrust. I cannot be sure that you aren't a trap, any more than you can be sure I am not. And as I have already pointed out - and as you have already accepted - these Assembled have an affinity for the site of Exaltation. Who knows what else they may be able to learn from it."

"Lovely," Benford mutters. "On the other hand, the Assembled haven't tried to kill us tonight. Alright. Let's make the arrangements. We'll catch up with Mister Klein when the time comes. If he's a Mister. And if there's only one of him. And if the time ever comes."

---

In due course, Luther receives schematics, software, and other requisite supplies for securing communications. With Meyer's money, the team is able to fab several SIM cards and other security tokens. A little testing via the programming expertise Benford already has is satisfactory to demonstrate that their communication channels are now untraceable - at least to amateurs.

A little snooping, with Schroeder's grudging assistance, shows that the phone records the Bureau has access to don't show anything more incriminating. It seems that for now the team has as secure a line as they are likely to get.

When they're not working on the secure phone system, members of the team are engaged in tasks to cover the identities of the Exalts while separated. Jet takes a pile of unmarked bills and purchases a few vehicles at police auctions, less luxurious than those used in the Mexican campaign, but also less conspicuous. Meyer and Luther forge a number of false drivers' licenses - deliberately not backed up by electronic tampering, so as not to arouse Assembled suspicion. Benford asks for everyone's footwear, and neatly sews a hidden flap into the soles of shoes and boots to hide the documents.

Finally, code books are prepared, no more than a few dozen pages that can be hidden in a wallet, with contact procedures and one-time keys. "We're going to be apart for a while." Benford explains, "We'll arrange a place to convene when the time comes, and advance Operation Greenspan. However, we need to stay in touch. Don't be shy about using the phones. Feel free to message each other like Japanese schoolgirls, but kindly leave out the kitten smilies."

Jet laughs and notes, "There will be enough of those Japanese schoolgirls where I plan to go." Her family is already whispering about Jet's plan. To most of her family Jet gives a choice, but not to all. Becca and Timothy she insists come with her. The conversations do not take long, however. The magnetism of the dangerous Full Moon is simply too powerful. "I will have need of help in getting over there, but I'm thinking of a few tricks that might make it go more smoothly."

"I will send a quick message to the club, so that they know what they are up to and the manager doesn't try to screw over the girls," says Jet. "But after that, I need to get the girls and Timothy tickets to Tokyo. They will be bringing their pet with them. Before I go I need to make a pit stop, and I will need help with that, as well." Jet sounds quite certain,"I must save my mother and fence with my father before I leave, if it can be done safely. I plan on taking my little sister with me."

"You're planning to go as the family pet?" asks Morgan, grinning ruefully at Jet. "Just when I thought we wouldn't have to forge any more ID..." He explains briefly about Japan's quarantine regulations - they're fairly straightforward immunization requirements, for the most part. "The hard part is going to be the microchip ID, but they're not gonna check to see if the chip is on record anywhere - just that they can read it. We can make up whatever bullshit we want. So we'll just 'borrow' some vet's office equipment. Who ever breaks into a vet's office?" This also makes it convenient to forge the necessary veterinary immunization records, as blanks will be readily available in the same place.

Watching Morgan work away at forgeries brings a smirk to Jet's face. "I knew I loved you for all the right reasons," she teases. As she watches him work, the Lunar's eyes are on the details, and while Poe masters his approach well, knowing how all documents must be, Jet sees it from her perspective. She suggests little changes, to make the identities more boring. A name is switched to Sarah, the name of the cat becomes Fluffy, even the pictures don't meet her specifications. "We want them unflattering," she suggests, and she coaches the girls to smile at the wrong time, getting the kind of 'off' expressions one always sees on official documents.

For his part, Morgan knows exactly what he needs to do with his own time away from the group - sort of. After his experience in Tijuana, he has had a powerful object lesson in the power of words - _his_ words. Now, he has something he needs to do. "This country needs me," he says to his new friends. "But I need to find out what it needs of me. And the best way for me to do that... is to ask." What he proposes to do is nothing less than a coast-to-coast road trip, looking at the country's problems at ground level.

For Morgan's mission, the need to stay off the grid is actually a blessing - the country's most poor and in need often lack access to such niceties as bank accounts or credit lines, and usually cannot afford cell phones for everyday chatting. Morgan's needs, therefore, are more than amply met by a modest, older-model sedan with decent fuel efficiency, a moderate amount of seed cash, and a Rand McNally Road Atlas, with the highway rest areas highlighted - sleeping at a rest stop is certainly cheaper than a hotel and never requires ID, provided you don't draw the highway department's attention.

Along with the rest of his preparations is a visit to a bookstore, for a copy of Nickel and Dimed by Barbara Ehrenreich, who has already traveled a similar road to Morgan's. He's heard about the book, but never actually had a chance to read about her hands-on experience in minimum wage hell; now is a good time to start.

The Celestials split up - uncertain, but empowered. Each has to find their center in some fashion; each is now prepared for the dangerous world that waits for them.
