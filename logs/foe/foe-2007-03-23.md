# Fall of Eden 2007-03-23

Despite his resolve to stay put for awhile, Benford has one more voyage to make before getting on with the business of changing the world, and to that end, he's once again on the road... in this case, the railroad. Amtrak's red-eye service from Oakland, California to Seattle, Washington is a pleasant enough trip, and Benford sleeps as well as he ever has since coming to America.

He awakens with a start, the largish chair and the rocking of the train car briefly reminding him of how things got started on the flight from Geneva... coming awake to find Mister Bland in the next seat over, sketching out his bomb threat. After a moment of disorientation, he remembers where he is. The train is grinding its way through the switchyard in south Seattle. There's nobody and nothing around him, save his own cheap steno book, with 'Lands of Light' scrawled on the cover in magic marker.

Benford takes his single duffel bag, and makes his way to the bus stop. He can smell ocean air on the chill wind blowing in from the west, and shrugs deeper into the old wool p-coat he found at an army-navy store. He finds his way to a bus stop and gets on the first one heading uptown, making his way to Poe's former residence in Lakewood.

The sun is just coming up when he gets there. While the house doesn't look ignored as such, it does look vacant, unlived in. Maybe Poe's family is collecting his mail; maybe Gerhard has been mowing the lawn out of some sense of precision and order. In any case, Poe's key still works in the lock, so Benford lets himself in and makes himself comfortable in a chair near the tv.

An hour passes. Gerhard doesn't show up, nor does anyone else, but Benford notices that the carpet is clean and someone has recently dusted. The scientist leaves his shoes near the door and walks around the house. The few houseplants have been watered. The garbage and the fridge are empty. The windows are closed and locked. The lights and heat are on, but at a minimal setting, presumably just high enough to keep the pipes from freezing. Benford sighs, remembering the disordered state of his own apartment. CERN must have mothballed it by now. "I hope he's told his family that he's alright," he mutters. "Hypatia, Gerhard described this place as a temple of some kind. Do you notice anything unusual?"

"I feel nothing out of the ordinary," Hypatia replies, sounding somewhat stilted and formal in her mind-speech. "This place will allow you into the Lands of Light. Beyond that I am afraid I have nothing to contribute."

Benford finds no othe signs that anyone has been here, or has anything to say. No messages on the answering machine, or tacked to he refrigerator. "It looks like a church on a Monday night. Clean... orderly... a little too sterile and empty. Might as well get started, then." He locks the front door and retires to Poe's guestroom, propping a chair under the doorknob. Benford checks his watch... just before 9am. He's warned the others, particularly Klein, that he'll be starting the experiment at 9am precisely. The scientist lies down on the narrow bed and waits for the final few minutes to elapse.

At 9am, his watch beeps. "Hypatia, please plug me in."

Overhead, Benford can see the lightbulb gutter and die. There's an audible pop, but it isn't the bulb. Benford can feel a sudden rush of air downward. Everything becomes completely dark, and Benford feels the sensation of being out in the open air. The sound of wind blowing past him seems limitless.

Benford says, "Hypatia? Junior?" He wiggles his fingers and toes, no longer aware of the mattress that was under him a moment ago. "Anybody?"

The scientist can feel the bed. He can hear his own voice. But he cannot perceive the mental voices of his companions. He is alone in the pitch-black void, surrounded by the unknowable.

"Crap." He sits up, experimentally searching for the floor - or at least something solid.

As Benford slides his feet off the bed and sits up, he stops himself just in time. The bed itself is solid and fixed in place, but there is no floor beyond it. It is as though he hangs suspended in space.

Benford pushes the button on his watch that should start the backlight, making a bet with himself that the time will now be 'blinking twelve'.

Benford presses the button on his watch. He sees the instrument illuminate itself, revealing a peculiarly old style of analog wristwatch instead. The second hand ticks its careful way around the face, while beautifully-crafted hour and minute hands make their own slow revolution. It is not at all clear where the light is coming from.

Benford says, "This is the Lands of Light," to nobody in particular. "So let there be light... please."

Benford pulls the 'Lands of Light' notebook out of his pocket, and a pen. Blindly he turns to the first page and writes 'light'.

When nothing happens, Benford grumpily tears the page from the notebook, wads it up, and casts it into the void. "Bloody Hell. I'm a Solar of the Twilight caste, and I will have light!" He pumps essence into his caste mark, hoping that there will be something to see.

The illumination of Benford's Solar nature cannot be hidden or disguised, no matter the place or time. A wave of light washes over his surroundings. Benford finds himself sitting upright on the bed, surrounded by a vast blackness. Only now he knows that the void is real. He can still feel the gusting wind, and it whips his wadded-up paper away to spiral down into the endless abyss below.

Benford says, "OK... need to find something to try..." He checks the bed, looking for ways it might have changed, but it seems to be identical, and has a local sembelance of gravity. Nevertheless he raps on the headboard. "Take me somewhere," he says.

As Benford finally looks under the bed, he sees nothing - nothing at all, only the void. And at the very instant of this realization he feels a sickening jolt. The bed is falling - now that he knows it must.

Benford pulls the sheet from the bed, hoping that Poe spent a decent amount on them, and quickly ties three corners to the bedposts.

Unfortunately, the effect - if any - is negligible. The bed continues its dizzying descent into the endless black.

Benford tries to remain calm. "It didn't start falling until I looked under it, so it's not a completely literal environment," he says to nobody in particular. "Now I know how the coyote feels."

Benford stares down. He can feel the wind whipping by him, but he cannot see anything at all below. His Caste Mark's light either cannot illuminate that far, or.. there is nothing there to see.

Benford reties the sheets to his own waist, attempting to improvise a parachute.

The sheet is better than nothing, but only barely. Benford feels himself tugged at by the air resistance, but he does not fully leave the bed just yet.

Benford kicks off, rising a few feet above the bed as it continues its descent. However, he only manages to gain that little degree of distance, and not much more. Gravity, it seems, still works.

Benford tries to steer with his improvised parachute, trying to see if the air - or what feels like air - seems to behave like a real fluid.

It behaves exactly as Benford would expect air to behave, and he begins to see the bed, that little island of stability he had, recede into the distance.

Benford envisions the LHC control bunker in his mind. _Klein had said they might call it the Lord's Holy Cathedral,_ he thinks, and concentrates on those words.

Benford watches the bed fall below him. It smashes into something. That something shatters outward, calving and fragmenting like glass. The shards explode outward, tugged at by the powerful wind, and Benford feels the wind intensity. He is borne aloft. Looking behind him, he can see that he fell out of the bottom of an enormous egg. And now, all about him, there is light.

Rivers of light wend their way through a brilliant cobalt sky. Pillars of frosty glass rise from unending depths to infinite heights, coruscant and breathtaking. And above his head, at a distance that makes him dizzy, is a flawless circle exactly the color of an elementary particle. How Benford knows what that color is or recognizes it is a mystery even to himself.

Distance is indicated by the size of the rivers, which angle up and down at intervals along their length. He can see one of them near his position, and see its size; he can see the rivers above him drawing distant, with the ring in perspective.

_'Rings of Light' indeed,_ he thinks, recalling his own publication. He searches for anything that looks human - or at least a place where humanoids might gather.

Aside from the black egg, this place seems to have no notable features. There is certainly no sign of a horizontal plane or structure of any kind, which he would expect to find people in or on.

The rivers of light glow brightly, and Benford manages to sail his way toward one. It hangs unsuspended in the air, a ribbon of brilliance all its own. He can see the waves of water, but as he watches the surface sometimes assumes the form of a steady stream of grit - tiny spheres or bubbles - rather than contiguous waves. Sometimes, Benford would swear the river is both.

Benford decides to descend further, but finds that he immediately sinks upon touching down on the river. The waves engulf him and suck him downward into blackness again. He feels a rush of expansion - a singular sensation, that of the world suddenly fleeing from him and making room - and he discovers that he is in a new place entirely.

He finds himself standing on the balcony of a tall tower made of glass. The tower itself is only one of many that overlook a magnificent metropolis, also of glass. The city's shimmering surfaces are tinted, colored, or otherwise rendered unique, producing an array of effects across the aesthetic and visual spectrum.

Behind him there is an open archway leading into the interior of the tower, and standing in the interior is a man dressed in a stylish business suit. He is unfamiliar to Benford. But he is wearing a CERN badge.

Benford doffs his makeshift parachute and walks through the arch. "I'm... I'm Doctor Benford. Is this the LHC?"

The man shakes head. "The Cathedral is yonder," he says, pointing upward at the sky. Benford sees that he points at the Sun itself, which he only now becomes aware of. "We of the priesthood sometimes come here to the City to conduct our business, before returning for prayer."

Benford says, "I see that those prayers must be important, to warrant so prominent a temple. I came here to learn about your ways. What purpose does this city serve for you? And what purpose do you serve for the Cathedral?"

The CERN man smiles. "You are one of the priesthood yourself," he observes wryly. Nevertheless he speaks on, as though it didn't matter. "The City is the City. It has no purpose. The Cathedral is all that matters. There we will smash open the smallest particle to open the universe beyond it."

Benford says, "Do you remember an event, just over a year ago? An event where more energy was produced than was consumed?"

The 'priest' nods. "Of course. That was when the Cathedral was founded."

Benford is moved, in spite of himself. _That was an interesting day,_ he recalls. "Do you ever have other visitors? Perhaps others interested in discoveries about fundamental particles?"

"We have regular delegations from the gods," the priest answers. "In addition, the lesser gods have begun to come here in search of answers. They wish to understand our work and venerate the Maker in his Cathedral."

"Perhaps I should pay my respects," Benford says. "I have met other servants of the Maker and wish to understand how His glory motivates them."

The priest nods appreciatively. "Return to the Cathedral when you are ready, brother."

Benford nods back. "Thank you." He closes his eyes and remembers the great ring, imagining it beyond the sun, hopping experimentally on his feet.

Benford finds himself again in the great open space. This time, however, he is almost near to the enormous ring itself. He floats at the center, and the circumference is barely visible.

Benford takes a moment to compose his thoughts. "I've heard your name, and I've met your Angels." He pauses again. "Autochthon."

Benford can see the sky beyond the ring ripple. From out of nothing, he can see something emerge. It is a face, a face whose size staggers the imagination. It is composed, as Benford looks closer, of millions upon millions of smaller faces. They are composed of metal, glass, steam, and other materials of industry. And as the face opens its mouth to speak, Benford can see each of its tiny component faces mirroring the effect.

_Welcome, priest,_ its voice says, and Benford feels himself reeling backward with the currents of air that result.

Benford is taken aback. _Didn't see that coming. And I should have._ "Thank you. We're trying to make our world a more congenial place. I understand that some of your agents are trying to do the same. So it seems that one way or another, it will come to pass; the only question is the method."

_Yes. That is the question._

Benford says, "The method implies certain values. If I may be so bold, why value the people of Earth at all?"

The voice does not answer in unison. Instead, Benford can see that each of the myriad sub-faces has begun to speak. And each of them is saying something different. The cacophony quickly becomes more than he can handle.

"I see," Benford shouts. "There is more than one path."

_Yes._ The chaos subsides; order returns, even though the single voice is nearly deafening in its simple answer.

"Great one, I do not mean to be disrespectful in exploring your motives," Benford ventures. "However, we have been set at odds with your servants, though we pursue the same ends. What purpose does that serve?"

Again the voices begin to shout in dissonant answer, each offering its own answer, none offering any sort of coherent whole.

Benford tries to think amidst the storm of sound. _So many faces... countless reasons... countless perspectives... countless reasons for pursuing that goal... but only one goal. Need to stick to binary, yes or no._ "There is a goal you pursue above all others! Do you know what you will do when you reach it?"

_No._

After the cacophany, the simple answer is unexpected, and the ensuing silence is deafening. Benford looks at the multitude of faces; a whole woven from thousands of not-yet-determined perspectives... so like the quantum nature of reality, perhaps not surprising considering that this being may have been its author.

Benford asks, "Are we going to provide that answer for you?"

Half of the voices in unison respond with a unique reply. The others have another. _Yes._ _No._

Benford nods slowly. "So its that way, then. Some believe in a humanistic solution, others in a mechanistic one. Then I ask a favor. We seek a descriptive understanding of the Assembled, or at least their plans. What is the easiest way for us to obtain it?"

_Become one of them,_ Autochthon replies majestically.

Benford asks, "Perhaps a method within our resources?"

_It is within your resources to do as I have said._

Benford nods slowly. "I will have to give that some thought," he says. "I should return home now. Thank you for your audience. In return, I say this: I believe that it is possible that we will find your solution. I hope that comes to pass. We will do what we can to make it so."

_Do not fail me._

Benford is silent for a long moment. In the end, all he says is, "Amen."

Benford closes his eyes and conceives of the Earth as a bright blue globe, covered in a grid. He concentrates on the longitude and latitude of Poe's residence, and recalls the feel of the bed beneath him, which was nothing more than a bundle of sensory information. With the experience framed in his mind, he opens his eyes.

The scientist wakes up. He's back on the bed. In his hands is a notebook. In the notebook, he finds transcriptions of a conversation written in his own handwriting. It is the conversation he had with Autochthon.

Benford says, "Huh. Maybe those paranormal shows with 'automatic writing' aren't completely bogus." He shudders. "I wonder if I'll run into Bigfoot next."

Outside, he hears something. It is a car engine, which rumbles to a stop. He hears car doors. Somebody is getting out of a vehicle outside, in Morgan's driveway.

Benford gets up and pockets the notebook. He rushes to the window in the master bedroom, grabbing a pair of Poe's slippers as he goes.

The Twilight can clearly see two middle-aged figures climbing out of the car, a man and woman. He'd guess Morgan's parents after a moment of stealthy observation. They certainly act like it - the woman bustles toward the door, while the man hauls a grocery bag of cleaning supplies out of the back seat and follows her, listening patiently while she chatters all the while.

Benford replaces the slippers and heads down to the front door, where he slips on his shoes. _Oh dear. Well, there's things they have a right to know._ He opens the door and steps onto the porch, hoping it will go well.
