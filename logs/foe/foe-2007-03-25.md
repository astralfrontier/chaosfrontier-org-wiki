# Fall of Eden 2007-03-25

The sun is up and shining brightly in the Seattle neighborhood of Lakewood. Newton Benford hopes it's a good omen, as he steps out onto Poe's porch. The other Solar's parents have just pulled up in the narrow driveway. Benford stands awkwardly for a moment, but has composed himself by the time the screen door bangs shut behind him. He raises a hand and waves at the older couple as if he has every right to be there, which he hopes is exactly what they will think.

The two react badly; the woman adopts a hostile air, while the man's face contorts into a troubled frown. "Who are you?" he demands, speaking for the pair by default. "What are you doing in Andy's house?"

"My name is Newton," the scientist begins, adopting a cheerful demeanor, if subdued. "I'm a friend of your son's. He offered me the use of his house while I'm here." He pauses, holding up the keyring. "I guess he hasn't spoken to you much since the incident."

"He's been in the Witness Protection Program," the woman - clearly his mother - replies. "Don't you know the sort of business he's involved in? There's hooligans that want to hurt him! I'm calling the police." She reaches for her purse, clearly intent on getting a cell phone.

"I know his sort of business exactly, because the same hooligans have been trouble for me as well," Benford says. "I could answer many questions for you; but if you call the police, I'm afraid that I'll have to leave."

The woman hesitates as Benford speaks, and her face softens. "Do you know if he's okay? Is Andy okay?" she asks worriedly.

Benford nods. "I've been through quite a lot with him, these last few months," he says. "I last saw him a few days ago, and he was in perfect health then." Benford motions towards the door. "Look, I understand that these are irregular circumstances. I'll tell you more, but let's please go inside."

The couple nod, and enter the house. Morgan's mother is still suspicious, and Benford can see her husband's fists are still somewhat tightened. This was an unexpected development to them, clearly.

Benford closes the door, but does not lock it. He slips off his shoes, showing respect for the effort that the pair have put into maintaining the place.

Benford waits until the Mister and Mrs Morgan to be seated on the sofa, then finds an armchair for himself. "I suppose I was lucky," he says. "I had an opportunity to visit my parents in Yarmouth about a year ago. I asked them not to worry about me, but I know that they will anyway. Goes with the territory, I suppose." He folds his hands. "I gather things have been somewhat more hectic for Andrew, and I'm sure he'd apologize for that if he were here."

"Of course he would. Andy's always been a good boy." Mrs. Morgan declines to sit, and begins bustling about the house, but Mr. Morgan takes a seat. "Now, we haven't introduced ourselves. I'm Carol Stuart-Morgan, and this is my husband, Grant Morgan." Grant nods politely and smiles.

Benford stands, and offers his hand to each. "Carol. Grant. It's good to meet you. I go by Newton Godwin lately," he says, using his mother's maiden name. "I gather that you've been told that Andrew is in the Witness Protection Program, and that was true at the time." He sits down again, refolding his hands. "I guess you can say he's been promoted since then, but before I go on, I'd like to ask you something. Andy is quite a 'good boy', as you say. Did he ever tell you about the story he was pursuing, at the time of the incident?"

Carol nods. "Oh yes, he talked about it. But he was always vague, you know." Grant chuckles. "He would say that he didn't want to involve us, but I think he just thought we were too dumb to understand what he was doing, you know?" Carol leaves the house and returns a moment later with her hands full of paper grocery bags, apparently loaded with cleaning solutions. "Grant, get up and help me with this, you can talk on your feet," she says.

Benford shrugs, and gets up also. "I'm a guest here today, even if the master is out. Let me do my part."

This seems to satisfy Carol's last misgivings. Nevertheless, she does the polite thing. "Oh, it's okay, you mustn't bother yourself. We can handle this." Grant gets up, chuckling.

"So, Mr. Godwin, tell us about yourself." The woman is busying herself with the kitchen sink.

Benford chuckles. "Well, I'm English, in case my voice didn't give it away. I work with your son. Before that, I was a university professor and researcher, believe it or not." He judges the couple's age to be in their early 50's, which means they would have been graduating from high school in the 1970's. "Did you attend university?"

"That's where we met," Grant chuckles.

Benford nods, and smiles. "I remember what that's like," he says, turning over an old memory for the first time in many years. "Might I ask your subject?"

The sound of running water in the sink forms a backdrop to Carol's conversation. "I was actually studying literature. I thought about going into theater. I loved drama, and plays, but I discovered it was mostly the writing I enjoyed. I even thought about becoming a librarian, if you can imagine."

Benford nods. "I suppose that was a great influence on Andrew, then, when he decided to make his living in Journalism. Did you help him make that decision?"

Grant laughs at this, and Carol chuckles. "Help him? Goodness no. To be honest, I think we held him back in some ways. But he had his own ideas."

Benford smiles. "I don't think that you've held him back," he says. "Andrew takes his work very seriously. Words may be his favored tool, but his commitment to truth is exceptional. Although my preferred tool is science, that commitment is something Andrew and I have in common. I'm sure you both may claim some credit for that, as my parents may for me."

"Funny you should mention that," Carol goes on. "He loved to write, of course, but he was really into biology. We thought he was going to end up doing that for a living, somehow. But then in senior year, the student newspaper published an article about... I don't remember. What was it, hon?"

"Sex education, I think," said Grant. "It was an editorial opposing abstinence-only education. Well, the principal took that as a personal insult - that was _his_ baby - and pulled the article and suspended the student involved. That got Morgan's dander up. He decided right then that he wasn't going to let anyone suppress knowledge just to feed their own ego."

Benford raises an eyebrow. "Oh, my. That does sound exactly like him. Was that... uh... a recurring theme for our Andrew?"

"Oh yes." Carol chuckles at the thought. Her hands are busy, putting things to soak, running a damp rag across the stove, moving without thought to clean up. "There's something attributed to Bertrand Russell that I think really resonated with him."

"'Three passions have governed my life: the longings for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of humankind.'"

"'With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of people. I have wished to know why the stars shine.'"

"'Love and knowledge led upwards to the heavens, but always pity brought me back to earth; cries of pain reverberated in my heart of children in famine, of victims tortured, and of old people left helpless. I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer. This has been my life; I found it worth living.'"

Carol smiles. "There's some business about love there too, but he's still single, so I don't think it all caught on."

Benford nods quietly. "Yes. That, especially, is Andrew Morgan." The scientist sighs. "And that, I suppose, is how we have gotten where we are. Mrs Morgan, would you mind terribly putting on a pot of coffee? I'd like to explain some of what has happened of late, and it will be easier on the second cup."

"Don't drink coffee myself," says Carol. Grant seems to speak up, but she quickly adds: "we don't drink coffee. Bad for the digestion at our age. But we have some bottled water here, if you're thirsty." She retrieves bottles from one of the bags and passes them out before sitting down. Her expression has grown more serious. "Now what's going on with Andy, Mr. Godwin?"

Benford opens a bottle and examines it, noting the small notation on the label indicating that the product's source was the municipal water supply of the city of Portland, Oregon. He takes a sip and is silent for a long moment before he begins. "In some ways, it's not so different from the story you've told me. He was working on a story, and he never backs down. It was an NGO - a Non-Governmental Organization, a kind of educational policy think tank. These people are not violent by nature. However, a small group of their allies were inclined to direct action." He takes another sip. "So the wrong man took something personally, said the wrong thing to the wrong people, who decided that Andrew Morgan was a problem."

"So they hired some muscle, and... well. You've probably heard the rest," the scientist continues. "Poe was rescued by a sister organization to the one that came to me. You might say that they're a parallel agency in a different company. That might be the end of it, except that we - and by that I mean myself, Andrew, and our associates - decided that there is still some risk, so it was best to remain under wraps for the moment."

"You're some kind of government office, right?" Grant asks. "Higher authority?"

Benford weighs his answer carefully. _Morgan believes in the truth. This is no time to deceive._ "Some of our associates are also in law enforcement or otherwise hold office. Most of us are not. We were selected... tasked with dealing with specific problems for which regular agencies are ill-prepared. You know your son. You know that if there's an injustice, he won't rest easy. And so rather than hide in a hotel room in Nebraska under an assumed name, he's elected to do what he can."

Benford says, "So I suppose our authority comes from being in the right place, at the right time, with the right talent, and being asked to deal with a situation. I ask you, if you were in that situation, what would you do? Would you wait for the blessing of the Queen or Congress? Or would you do what you could, and take responsibility for the outcome, good or ill?"

"To be honest, I'd say that sounds kinda vague," observes Grant. Carol reaches for her purse, withdrawing her phone. "Mr. Godwin, I believe you," she says. "But like Andy, I don't think we can be too careful."

Benford says, "Before you do that, have you been contacted by a man with an unusual name? I don't mean some evasive cipher like me. I mean some chap that didn't seem at home in his own skin, whose name sounds like it came from an auto parts catalog. Rod Phillips, or John Lever, or Gerhard?" He pronounces the last as 'Gear Heart', making it obvious what he's talking about.

The couple look at each other slowly. "Yes, there was a fellow who introduced himself by that name," Carol says at last. She raises her phone and Benford hears the shutter snap of the built-in camera; his picture has been taken.

Benford chuckles. "Those men - or some of them - are the problem. Which one was it? And since you're taking my photo anyway... I seem to remember that Poe kept a copy of a book that I wrote. Grant, would you be so kind as to retrieve the eighth book over, from the third shelf down, entitled 'Rings of Light'?"

While Grant gets up, Carol thumbs through her phone's user interface. Benford hears the distinctive Cingular 'mail sent' chime, and the woman extends her phone for inspection. On the display is a high-resolution image of Gerhard. "You say he's mixed up in this business? He had credentials from the newspaper. He said he was writing a biography of notable reporters."

Grant chimes in. "Rings of Light is by a Dr. _Benford_, Newt," he chuckles. "Same first name though.." The chuckle dies down as he flips the book over and sees the scientist's face on the back of the dust cover. "You said your name was Godwin."

Benford nods. "Godwin is my mother's maiden name." He produces his passport. "It's my legal name in the United States."

"You should have said something," Carol says, sounding distinctively uncomfortable. "Now, honey, he's a _scientist_," observes Grant, as though this forgave everything.

"I'm surprised that Gerhard allowed himself to be photographed," Benford continues. "Is that where you sent the photo?"

"I sent it to my Flickr page," Carol says firmly. "It's only viewable by friends."

Benford nods. "Of course. I appreciate the discretion." _Won't stop Gerhard or Axel. But then, if they wanted me, they'd be here already._ "And as to what I should have said or not..." The scientist shrugs. "I'm sorry that I didn't tell you before, but some days it's nice to just be 'Newt', and not 'that crazy wheelchair scientist'. And before you ask, it was a very experimental gene therapy."

Grant gets a confused look on his face, until he glances down at the author's biographical details printed on the jacket. Carol follows his eyes, waiting silently for some situational guidance. Grant finally smiles. "Well, sir, it sounds like you made a good recovery. Congratulations. Don't suppose they have anything like that for the ol' ticker?" He thumps his chest with a smile.

Benford says, "Seriously? Do you have specific symptoms?"

"He's just got to watch his blood pressure," explains Carol.

Benford nods again. "It's not specifically for cardiac problems. However, I'll check with the doctor next time I see him."

Benford says, "I'd like to add, about Gerhard and his lot. Gerhard is more congenial than most, but be wary about trusting them. They don't give up when they have a specific goal. That's why Andrew has been trying to stay off the radar. We may have things worked out in a few months, and then Andrew will likely be back in this house. Until then... well, I can relay messages for you." He withdraws a business card from his wallet and pushes it towards Carol. "You can also send an SMS to that number. It's the best I can do until we get a better messaging system in operation."

Carol accepts the card. She stuffs it into her purse, and withdraws an envelope, already stamped, and crinkled - clearly, it's seen a lot of traveling. "If you see him, will you please give him this?" she asks quietly.

Benford nods, and takes the envelope. "I will do so, at the first opportunity." The scientist rises, and stretches. "I'm glad I got the chance to speak to you. I hope that next time I'll be able to tell you more - use more names and fewer pronouns."

Benford shakes Carol and Grant's hands in turn, then retrieves his coat and boots. He slips the envelope into an inside pocket and marches back to the same bus stop where he arrived, less than four hours ago. As it happens, he's just in time for a southbound bus to the Amtrak station. _Someday I'll get to be a tourist here,_ he reflects. _The simple comforts of humanity are well worth everything else we do._
