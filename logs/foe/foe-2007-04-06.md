# Fall of Eden 2007-04-06

After the hectic business of the past several weeks - from one end of the country to the other, with his new friends by his side and his new enemies in hot pursuit - Morgan finds it a bit strange to be alone once more. The radio was tuned to the local NPR affiliate when he left San Francisco - by now, it's apparently given way to a generic Top 40's station. He doesn't bother to look for a new station, since he'll probably go out of range of this one pretty soon anyway. It's not important. What matters is the drive, and what's at the other end of it.

Morgan stops at a rest area for a snack, and to stretch his legs. And for a while, he decides to just sit on a bench near the snack machines, listening to snippets of conversation as they go by, watching the other travelers as they pass. He is here, after all, to open his eyes and mind, to the people of his country and his world. It's been so long since he's done this - any time he's traveled before, he's been in a hurry to get where he was going. Now, the journey itself is the destination.

As Morgan leans back, enjoying the sunlight (which seems somehow warmer to him, now), he tries to think about the stories of those around him, but keeps going back to his own story. Remembering his outrage over the censorship of the high school newspaper, and deciding to go into journalism himself. Remebering his first internship at the Times, where he discovered that he _still_ couldn't write just anything he wanted, that it had to go by the editors first. Remembering how he began working his way up the ranks, hoping to find a level where the truth was unfettered, beholden to no one.

---

Carson City, Nevada is where Morgan finds himself. The former frontier town has graduated to capital city of the state, though much of its architecture and heritage betray its wild roots. Appropriately, the city was named for an explorer - Kit Carson.

Perhaps such a man would have Exalted, in his day - his fame spread far and wide even before his death, and he was both a frontiersman and a fighter. But he had a darker side too. Still entirely fitting.

Morgan's dark side, to the extent that he has one, has been that of passivity in the face of challenge. He has seen much. Has he done enough? Such thoughts occupy his time as he studies the Nevada map. And it is at one of the gas stations on the edge of Carson City, while looking at a layout of the state, that he discovers he is being watched by another journalist from a car. Two journalists, in fact. It is his own car. He recognizes both.

Hunter S. Thompson created "gonzo journalism". He has been dead only three years, but here he sits, in the prime of life, at the steering wheel of Morgan's vehicle. A joint hangs loosely from his lips and he flashes a feral grin.

Edward R. Murrow, on the other hand, has been dead some four decades. He's best known as the bane of Joseph McCarthy, but even before that he made his legend in the trade, performing war journalism and recruiting successors. Still, he looks alive enough in his tailored suit and conservative sunglasses. He nods politely.

Though astonished by the appearance of the two men, Morgan has become used to things he would have previously deemed impossible. Folding up the map, he makes his way back to the car, with a raised eyebrow and an amused expression. "Can I help you gentlemen?" he asks.

Murrow lights a cigarette, while Thompson shrugs and smiles. "Yeah. Get in and drive to Vegas," he says. "We gotta talk."

Morgan certainly doesn't disagree. "Well, move over then," he says back as he climbs behind the wheel and starts the engine. "If it's worth you two gentlemen taking time out of your busy schedules for me, I'm all ears."

"That's the problem," observes Murrow. He takes a long drag on his cigarette and exhales. "You need to be more mouth too, Morgan. You know it, right?"

Morgan looks uncomfortable for a moment, then nods, as the car rolls onto the freeway on-ramp. "Yeah."

Murrow nods slowly. "I worried that what I was doing with the program was going to get too dirty, too personal. When I decided that something had to be done about Joe McCarthy, I thought, am I bringing my personal feelings into what's supposed to be an objective business? I thought that's what the news meant - telling the truth, telling the story."

"Of course that's all bullshit," chimes in Thompson, who takes a drag off his joint and grins. "Truth ain't nothing but opinions. Scientific truth is just what everyone agrees on, but political truth? You will _always_ have slant there. Take your dealings with the cartels in 'Mehicko'. You think they were bad, but is that the whole story? You think the poor oppressed _paeons_ in the villages were the good guys? That ain't all there was to it either."

"The gentlemen we were working with said as much," agrees Morgan. "He told me what the cartels did for the people of Tijuana, how the people looked up to them even while they feared them. And how it was the _gringos_ up north who put the ordinary folks in a position where the cartels looked like a good alternative." He pauses. "Lemme guess... _that'_ isn't the whole story either, isn't it?"

"Is it ever?" Murrow asks quietly.

"Not that I've ever seen," Morgan says. "There's always another layer. There aren't too many out-and-out bad guys in the world. The rapists in Juarez are the closest I've seen in a while, but most people're just trying to get ahead and make a life for themselves."

Thompson chuckles. "So you pick your fights! But let me tell you, kid, you have bigger fights to pick than people like us. We'll help you as you go, and we'll give you the best advice we can. But you gotta aim higher. That's why we want to introduce you to another fella. He's a big fan of truth as well."

"Sounds like my kind of guy," says Morgan. "Lead on!" And a strange road it will be, Morgan has no doubt, with people like this for traveling companions.

Not much else is said, and the two aspects of Morgan's Exalted nature - for that is what they clearly are - say nothing of use. But they are helpful enough to point out a rest stop on the road to Vegas, and Morgan reclines in his seat for a brief nap.

---

He wakes, and pulls back out onto the highway, his two journalist friends resting comfortably as passengers. But Morgan gradually realizes something. The scenery is starkly different. Instead of the Nevada desert, he is driving through the wheat fields of Kansas. He confirms this by spotting the mileposts and signs along the road. Before he can say anything, Thompson shouts out. "Up there! Look at that!" He points, and Morgan follows. Some sort of comet is rocketing toward a nearby field, and Morgan pulls to a stop as the earth trembles and shakes at a sudden impact. "Come on, this is important," Murrow says.

"Last time I let you hotbox my car, Hunter," Morgan remarks, grinning, as he climbs out of the car and heads out into the field. Of course, he knows full well that this is no drug trip, any more than his two traveling companions are. No, he's 'tripping' on something far more mysterious and powerful now, and he knows in his soul that he must ride it through.

The three men stand far enough away from the 'visitor' to be safe, but even from here they can feel the heat of its passage through the atmosphere. The crops are not burning because anything close enough to the impact site has already been charred to ash. And it is obviously not a comet. Instead, Morgan sees a crystalline pod-like shape, dotted with flanges and extruding spikes. There are hints of yellow and red lights still winking on and off.

It could easily be of extraterrestrial origin, and Morgan's suspicions are only confirmed when he sees two people rushing across the field toward the thing.

"Just another illegal alien sneaking into America," comments Hunter sardonically.

"Careful Jonathan, careful!" The woman's voice is not loud, but it somehow carries with it a certain confidence and strength. The woman who bears it has the face of a farm wife, lined from labor. She's wearing her Sunday best, and despite her voice, her hands are wringing together nervously as she sees the strange object.

Jonathan Kent is a barrel of a man, strong from head to toe, and though his hair is thin, his stride is steady and his eyes bright. "I think I see something moving," he calls back. "Just keep clear, Martha." The farmer confronts this impossible sight with the same calm he has faced all his days. There's a strange stubborness in him that makes it this way, and that same stubborness keeps him moving closer through a scene that would send most rushing to call the police. Or the army.

"I've... seen something like this before, haven't I?" says Morgan, from the edge of the crater, where he lurks amongst the wheat. "I... oh you've got to be kidding me," he adds as the penny drops. It seems that the suspension of disbelief Morgan has acquired with his Exaltation has its limits after all.

"Think of this as a vision quest, with more modern sensibilities," observes Murrow calmly from the side.

Morgan reluctantly sees the wisdom in this. "Just so long as they don't mess up the storyline by changing writers in mid-run," he remarks, watching Mr. Kent climb up to examine the pod.

"You're always the writer here, Mr. Morgan," smiles Murrow.

Despite Jonathan's warnings, Martha continues to move closer, gaping at the strange crystal shape resting at the end of the scorched path. Her husband's examinations lead him to reach out to briefly touch the shining surface of the rock. "Never seen anything like it," he says quietly. "It's like glass."

Either by chance or the actions of the curious Mr. Kent, the crystal skin of the pod sudden opens, exposing a perfectly preserved chamber inside. Amongst all the wonders inside, where technology far more complex than anything Jonathan Kent will live to see again resides, the small form of a baby boy rests. "Martha, come here!" cries out Jonathan.

A dutiful wife and more than a little curious, Martha moves forward carefully, weaving her way across a landscape both burned and flattened by the force of impact. That caution vanishes when she sees the child. "Oh! Oh!" She claps her hands over her mouth, her emotions a mix of shock and sudden hope. She won't remember later exactly how the child wound-up in her arms, but she does remember clearly those vivid blue eyes, that black hair, and the serenity of the child. She will also remember her husband's words, "Martha, I think he's a gift from a heaven."

Morgan finally decides that it's perfectly plausible for another stranger to stop by the side of the road to investigate the crash. After all, that's what the Kents did, and, well, he always wondered how _he'd_ react if he got into this mess. He steps out onto the edge of the crater. "What on earth..." he says, gaping at the pod.

The sudden sound of a voice has Martha clutching the child a little more closely. It's Jonathan who speaks, greeting the stranger with a smile. "Haven't a clue, friend." His eyes, friendly but measuring, explore Morgan patiently. He makes his way over towards Morgan, Martha following cautiously behind. "I'm Jonathan Kent. I don't think we've met before." The farmer's calloused hand is offered for a firm shake.

Morgan returns the handshake firmly. "Andrew Morgan. Just passing through," he acknowledges. "To tell you the truth, Mr, Kent, I'm with the paper, and this could be a _huge_ story." The tilt of his head and the note of questioning in his voice, however, makes it clear that, whatever Mr. Morgan may prefer, _how_ huge a story this will be is entirely up to Mr. Kent.

Jonathan looks back behind him, noticing the way his wife holds the child. "Well, it certainly is the strangest thing I've ever heard of," he agrees. "But I don't know. If there's a big story out here, we'll have a bunch of strangers running around on my land, trampling my crops looking for who-knows-what." Martha's words are more direct. "We've never been able to have a child." Of course, this gift will not likely stay with her if his nature is revealed to the world.

Morgan glances at the pod one more time, then at John and Martha, and finally at the child in her arms, and makes a show of putting away his notebook. "He couldn't hope to have a better couple of parents," Morgan says. "What's his name?"

Jonathan looks perplexed at first, and Martha says quickly, "Clark." The answer has the farmer laughing. "That makes perfect sense to me." He explains to Morgan, "Her maiden name." It's clear that putting that notebook away has put them at ease. "Of course we'll need to make it official, still, but that shouldn't be too difficult," says Jonathan. "Everyone in the county knows how good Martha is with children."

Morgan nods. "Well... congratulations to you both. Take care of him. He's a long way from home," he says, nodding to the pod and touching his forelock in salute. "Good luck, you two." And with that, Morgan turns and fades into the waving fields of wheat once more. Though, once there, he turns back again, to watch what happens next.

Thompson and Murrow are waiting, smiling. "Should we call the INS?" the gonzo journalist asks, puffing on his joint.

"As much as I'd love to watch them try to enforce a deportation order," Morgan remarks dryly, "I think the answer is probably no. So why him? I mean, sure, he's got powers from beyond this world, and he uses them to fight for Truth, Justice, and the American Way, but..." he trails off. "Oh, of course. Clark Kent, the mild-mannered _reporter_. Wow." He laughs softly.

---

The road trip through Morgan's mind leads him to the outskirts of New York City - or rather, to Metropolis, which looks suspiciously like New York.

"It's not just about being a reporter," Murrow is saying. "Journalism is just a job. Like all jobs, it's a means to an end. It's taking information and holding it to the light. But you have to be the sort of man who wants that to happen. If you are, you might become a reporter to do so."

Thompson just shakes his head. "It's not just information, old man! It's _attitude_! You showed McCarthy because you thought McCarthy was wrong, not just because he existed. The HUAC was a fact. That it was a bunch of slobbering tight-assed fascist _pigs_ is attitude. And that's what a journalist needs. Right, Morgan?"

"It's both, of course," Morgan says, laughing. "If you don't think the truth is important, why go to all the bother of getting it out there against all the people who want to hide it? And on the other hand, if all you have is attitude... well, the HUAC had lots of attitude. It's the whole being right thing they didn't have."

"There is that," concedes Murrow. "But we are here to help you become a better Exalt. If being a better journalist helps you with that goal, we support it. Always remember the burning spark of truth that lies behind your career choice. That little light will be your guide, as the Sun told you."

"Ah, we're here," Thompson says. And the car pulls up at the front door of the Daily Planet. "Mr. Morgan, your first day on the job awaits. Go upstairs."

Morgan nods as he looks at the statue of the rotating globe over the entrance, just like in the stories. It's fitting, somehow. It's how he imagined working for a big newspaper would be like. He heads for the elevators...

Morgan finds the elevators crowded, swarming with people. After a ride surrounded by faces buried in newspapers, the upstairs offices are reached. And here it is most obvious that the Daily Planet is a place alive. Discarded copy covered with notes litters around the desks of reporters whose fingers fly wildly across the keyboard. The hustle and bustle of the place is unlike anything seen elsewhere. The Daily Planet prides itself on truth, and its reputation is among the best in the world. Across this expanse lies a great windowed office, where an old man with eyes like a hawk surveys a young reporter over steepled fingers.

The young reporter meets those eyes and its obvious that though their eyes are locked, the two are hardly seeing eye-to-eye. Whoever she is, she is not impressed by titles, and the editor isn't going to derail her stories without a fight. Her hair is shoulder length, her face unmistakably beautiful, and her dress utterly professional. For all that, she leaves the office with a grimace, obviously defeated, but hardly broken. No, it is with a hint of mischief in her eyes that Lois Lane, star reporter of the Planet settles at her desk.

Morgan is intrigued by this little contretemps - it certainly reminds him of the run-ins he's had with his editor. Curious, he ventures near the woman's desk and glances over her shoulder, wondering what the story is, as he so often does.

With Morgan looking over her shoulder, Lois quickly flicks her way through a rolodex, navigating with practiced ease. But her goal is evasive. Whatever she's looking for simply isn't there. "Jimmy, can you get me the number for Metropolitan Power?" she asks as her eyes catch the blur of the photographer trying to rush past. Jimmy looks apologetic and with his voice lowered says, "I thought the chief told you to drop that story." Lois smiles sweetly and says, "Did he? I guess I've forgotten." The comment is obviously an in-joke of some kind, and gets the young photographer to grin wide. "Well, people forget things every day," he says agreeably. With a wink that is far from subtle, Jimmy slips away, going to grab a notebook so disorganized only he can figure it out.

Morgan rubs his chin, grinning. A convenient memory has certainly been his friend in time of trouble. But never mind that. "Excuse me," he says, after taking a few discreet steps backward, to make his listening-in a little less glaringly obvious. "I don't believe I've had a chance to introduce myself. Andrew Morgan," he says, offering a hand.

Lois doesn't seem to even notice Morgan at first. "I can't believe Perry! It's so infuriating!" She spins around in her chair, right hand raised in a point like a dagger, "I just can't believe he can't see that I'm about to break this whole thing open!" Morgan's words then filter through and she stands up, offering her hand, rather than point as if she were about to stab something. "Sorry. Long day. I'm Lois Lane."

Morgan shakes hands firmly. "So what does he want you working on instead? Something really nice and juicy, I'm sure," he says, with a hint of sarcasm. The sure signs of someone who needs to vent are obvious to Morgan, and as ironic as it is to use such tricks on a fellow reporter, he can't resist the temptation to encourage her into full rant mode.

It doesn't take much to get her going. "Ugh! It's this awful party that the mayor is hosting. He wants me to go there tonight, just because I have an 'in' and he doesn't see that tonight I need to finish cornering Meyers." She looks around, "Jimmy!" The photographer's head pokes up right behind her and he excitedly says, "I have the number, and they sure are a hard nut to crack." He looks at Morgan curiously a moment, waiting for an introduction that Lois doesn't offer. Finally Jimmy reaches out, "I'm the photographer, Jimmy O-" Before he can finish, Perry's voice booms out behind him, "OLSEN! My office! NOW!"

Morgan hears another voice behind him. Lois doesn't even notice at first, but there's another man introducing himself. "Mr. - Mr. Morgan? Hi! A pleasure to meet you. I'm Clark Kent?" The visitor is friendly enough, with slicked-back hair and glasses, but he would stand out as a rube on the streets of Metropolis. "It's your first day as well? Mine too. I mean! Uh, we're starting together today. And I think... uh.. Mr. White had an assignment for us.." He fumbles inside his jacket, finally producing (and almost losing) a white slip of paper and extending it.

"Good to meet you, Clark," says Morgan, shaking hands, and accepting the paper. "Already? Wow, you'd think I'd have time to settle in," he says, scanning the slip. "This Perry fellow seems like quite the taskmaster."

"Well, heh heh.. I like to think of it as uh, learning the city, so to speak..." Clark chuckles nervously, glancing at Jimmy's retreating form. "Oh, Lois, umm, Lois..." He tries to get the woman's attention, adjusting his glasses nervously as he does so.

Lois looks at Clark doubtfully. Still, she won't be rude, no matter how he looks. Even with Clark's sudden appearance, it takes a little while for her to realize that Clark's talking to her. She looks up from a study of the papers on her desk and says, "Yes?" In the back of her mind, she's trying to remember if she heard anything about two new reporters.

"Ahh, Lois, umm, hmm, do you.. That is, do you remember when you mentioned this morning that you'd show me around?" Clark is clearly working up the nerve to his real question. He's still working on it.

Lois looks confused for a moment. Did she say that? "It does sound like something I'd say," she replies uncertainly. She is hardly going to help Clark's nerve, her eyes are positively intense when she looks at Clark, as if she were interviewing him rather than having a conversation. "But Jimmy is really a lot better at that sort of thing," Lois says quickly.

"Ahh, okay.." Clark adjusts his glasses and returns his focus to Morgan. "Do you terribly mind driving? I'm, uh, kind of learning my way around.." He laughs in a manner that would be 'nonchalant' in a man of more composure. "I guess we should get going, huh?"

Morgan glances between the two, and nods to Clark. "I'll be happy to drive," he says, glancing at Lois. "Good luck, uh, covering the party," he says, winking to her.

The drive is uneventful; unsurprisingly, Morgan finds that he knows exactly how and where to drive to reach the wholly fictional address in a wholly fictional city. Still, it is all eerily realistic. The place they come to is a run-down tenement building, and the two men exit the car. "We're supposed to, ah, supposed to interview some people on the uh, landlord here," says Clark, repeating the written lead with far less assertiveness than Mr. White's stark handwriting.

"Apparently they've been served eviction notices, and the claims seem unfair..." Clark and Morgan approach the place and enter; they split up, each taking pad, pencil, and cassette recorder to ply their trade among the residents.

Several minutes pass, and Morgan finds a family to speak to. They exhibit little to no hope, claiming that they are being run out so that a developer can turn the low-rent housing into something more profitable. Outside, Morgan can hear the sudden squeal of tires. He smells smoke and the acrid odor of something burning, but there is no corresponding fire alarm.

_That's not right_, Morgan thinks. He rushes to the window to see what's going on. Surely this nefarious developer didn't just give up on eviction and go for arson, did he?

Sadly, Morgan's conclusion is entirely right. He can see a black sedan speeding off, and notes the large amount of refuse and wood piles stacked around the sides of the building. Whoever did this didn't feel like being subtle. Unfortunately, that obviousness is also going to endanger the life of everyone in the building, in short order.

Morgan's own powers don't include an arctic breath or make him fireproof. That doesn't mean he won't do his best to help in his own way. "Can you get out on your own?!" he asks the family in front of him - and unless they answer in the negative, he'll go on to rush down the hallway, banging on doors and raising the alarm. _Why disable the fire alarms? That doesn't even make sense! Unless they're just broken and they didn't bother to fix them. Wonder whose palm got greased at the fire department to let **that** pass._ Even in the midst of an emergency, Morgan's mind looks for the story behind the story.

The fire is now raging. Morgan can hear screams, can see people running down the hall, trying to evacuate. He feels a shuddering, and deduces that the front hallway and the entrance have collapsed in the fire. And outside, he can hear a loud, commanding voice: "Get everyone up to the roof! Everyone, come to the roof!"

_Well, three guesses who **that** is,_ Morgan thinks to himself. The halls and stairs are in confusion, though, and even though they've heard the voice, the attempt to reverse themselves in mid-flight is on the verge of causing a stampede. _This is where it helps to have a man on the inside,_ thinks Morgan, as he starts barking orders. "Don't push! Single file please! You there mister, stand aside for the kid! Other way, ma'am!" Though he lacks the volume of Superman's lungs, he can bring just as authoritative voice to muster, and the panic manages to resolve itself into a more-or-less orderly evacuation.

It doesn't take much to get everyone up on the roof. The man waiting there is tall, broad-shouldered and muscular. His black hair and S-curl are indelibly embedded in Morgan's American cultural inheritance. And he smiles at Morgan, revealing to the reporter that he knows full well what the man has done to save lives today. "Alley-OOP!" he says, lifting four people into his strong arms and darting away to the ground. He returns for more, and more, evacuating the families in short order. Morgan is last, and none too soon, for the building begins to collapse behind them. He stands on the street, hearing the distant - and much-delayed - sounds of a fire engine, and faces the Man of Steel.

"Too many people could've died today if it weren't for you," says Morgan in acknowledgment of the heroic deeds. "But the city needs more," he goes on, now as if addressing a colleague or a peer. "Whoever is behind this needs to be dragged out into the light of day, or they'll do it again."

Superman points to the distinctive 'S' on his chest. "I've made this my symbol," he says. Then his finger rises to indicate Morgan's forehead. "And you have yours. My father once said, 'good deeds aren't done unless there's good men doin' them.' And you have all that you need, including the light of day - in every sense." He smiles broadly.

Morgan nods and grins. "We each have our jobs to do, with the gifts we've each been given," he says. "Same with my Circle-mates."

The Man of Steel nods, smiling firmly. "My father - my other father - said something else. It's always stayed with me.. He spoke of humanity. He said, 'they can be a great people if they wish to be. They only lack the light to show them the way.'" He looks directly into Morgan's eyes. "They - you - ARE a great people." His eyes burn with passion and hope as he speaks. "There's so much, so much more to see, to do! I wish I could be there with you, seeing it and doing it all. I wish I could help you. My prayers go with you, Mr. Morgan, wherever you go."

Morgan salutes. "I'll remember you, Superman. Wherever you go, you'll be with me in my thoughts." And perhaps for the first time, Morgan wonders if the story of Superman itself was a model of the Solars all along: a man with powers beyond those of mortal men, drawn from the Sun, and who fights for Truth, Justice, and Freedom...

"You're right," says the caped hero, discerning his 'creator's thoughts. "What people are searching for is a hero. And what you're searching for is the hero inside. But you better be going now.. "

"Yes. My world needs me," agrees Morgan, as he turns away.

---

Morgan wakes abruptly. He finds himself reclining in the car seat, parked at the rest stop between Carson City and Vegas.

Morgan turns to either side, but Murrow and Thompson are gone. Or rather... they are not sitting in the car beside him. But now that he understands his nature a little better, he knows that they are not far away. But this next part is up to him. He starts the car and pulls out, heading toward Vegas once more. Somewhere out there is the story of the United States, and it is his job to tell it. _No,_ he corrects himself as he merges into traffic. _It's my job to make it happen._
