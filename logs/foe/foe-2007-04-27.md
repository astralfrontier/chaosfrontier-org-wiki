# Fall of Eden 2007-04-27

Since agreeing that it was time to get some personal issues and goals handled, Jet has focused on resolving some loose ends. The system of honor as the Japanese see it is in ways not so different from the way gangs handled issues. When one is disrespected, they must come up with cunning ways to address this problem. For Jet, the usual gang resolution is tempting, but killing her father is hardly justice. It's too easy and it won't do much. No, she's got to do it right.

Fortunately it's a long enough drive to make a few plans. Jet's first thought is that her father is probably already seeing somebody. Once a cheat, always a cheat. She just has to sniff around a bit and figure out who it is. She even has some suspicions from the past, and they will make good places to start. Most might not think much of the Lunar's intellect, but she's far from stupid.

Along the way, Jet naturally needs to make arrangements. It's all for nothing if she can't make a big splash with this. She's got to set this up well and get some media help. She needs a mudslinger who is both proficient and the kind of bastard who delights in ruining a career. She already has a few suggestions she got from Poe before he left. They're perfect.

Jet has thought about this, and knows some of the keys to getting a lead on the new fling. The two best means of finding a guy who is screwing around are through credit card bills and phone call histories. Now of course Mark Williams is probably clever enough to cover these things pretty well, but it's really hard to hide everything.

Charity knows a lot of possible approaches to take, but first she wants some keys. Knowing her father well helps, and knowing that he's a man whose wife has a lot of credit cards is handy, as well. The Lunar waits and watches, and when the mail man makes his rounds, she makes her move. A dog walking tamely down the street doesn't cause much notice, and though a dog fetching mail out of a box might, this is a neighborhood full of active people who don't spend much time peeking out their windows. At this hour, most husbands are off working and the wives are out spending.

Jet's not particularly lucky with her haul. There aren't any bills. However, sure enough, there's an offer for a card. "Like a genie in the bottle," the Lunar comments with a smirk. Her next step is fairly simple. She goes to get a prepay wireless phone. These are easy to get, she takes care to get a model with no tracking, and uses a prepay card purchased with cash to make it as close to invisible as you can get.

The best thing about the Williams' family is that their phone number hasn't changed in years. Jet still knows it, and always dreamt of calling it and talking to her sister. Her use of it this time isn't nearly so altruistic.

Waiting a few hours to make sure Angela is home and Mark isn't is child's play. Jet didn't expect to have Laura answer the phone, and it nearly screws her up. Still, she catches herself and gets composed enough to ask for Mrs. Williams. Jet's not spoken to Angela for years, and so only a little bit of subterfuge is needed, an exaggeration towards a spanish accent.

Knowing Angela as a tremendous lover of buying power, this is really kid's play. A card is offered with a great introductory percentage, a high limit, and a ton of wonderful features. It likely sounds almost too good to be true. Jet writes down all the information as she goes, including social security number.

Jet's only getting started, though. It seems that Angela's attempt to get it under just her name isn't working. The limit is really too low. Fortunately Angela has all of Mark Williams' information, as well, so Jet can kindly prepare the application and he can call in and finalize it later. Another social security number follows. Just to get things even more interesting, Jet gets full bank and routing information for automatic payment to ensure no late fees ever crop up and get both Mark and Angela's wireless numbers as emergency contacts in case of fraud.

The call is ended with a bunch of gushing politeness and Jet clicks the phone off with a sigh. "First thing I do is teach Angela to be a lot more careful," she murmurs to herself. "I've got the keys to the castle now." First things first. She makes a few probing calls to wireless carriers, asking if someone can help her with a calling plan question. The first two carriers tell her they don't handle the number, but the third is able to direct her based on the number she's given. The fourth call is to Sprint, and she's ready to get more information.

In short order, Jet has arranged for a print out of calls made on all CTNs under both of Mark William's accounts. Interestingly, the second line is only for him, but the busy man never arranged for an account password, probably for fear that someone else might figure it out. To saw a $5 fee, Jet agreed to accept a fax. This was planned ahead, and Jet is able to pick up her information from a Kinko's without incident. Beyond this, Jet is able to find the last four digits and the card type of autopay for Mark William's mysterious second line. In his best interests, she has this line switched to auto-deduct from the bank account of Angela Williams.

The problem with secrets is that you can only hide so many. For Mark Williams the busy, successful businessman and aspiring political leader, this means he has one secret credit card, and one secret phoneline. Jet's next call is to Visa, and she's frantic because she lost her father's credit card. Lies with a touch of truth are always the most effective. She doesn't remember the whole number, but she is able to provide the last four digits and her father's social security number. Between sobs and 'ohmygodhe'sgonnakillme!' she begs for yet another fax, this time with all the charges made in the past month so she can be see if anything was charged that she didn't know about.

With all this information, Jet has the tools she needs to put the picture together. A stop in a local library gives her anonymous computer access. The first order of business? Reverse phone number look-up. She needs to see who owns this number that her father calls so often, and she starts to assemble patterns between calls and charges. Hotel charges are naturally the most interesting, but recurring dinner meetings in the same, secluded place aren't so bad, either.

When Jet's satisfied that she's got enough to get a reporter's interest, she sends an email with her phone number to three reporters. She doesn't give them everything. She wants in, and she demands TV feed. This has to be embarassing, it has to ruin his political aspirations, and it has to be real. Simply, he must destroy himself, she is only here to expose him for what he is. The first to return Jet's call is Joseph Hurst, a ferociously ethical man that sounds like he's more than half rhino.

Joseph listens to Jet's full pitch, and she describes herself as a concerned citizen. 'So you hate this guy's guts, huh?' Joseph asks. Jet's grin is almost audible, "It's a personal issue. I always repay my debts." Since the pattern of Mark's infidelity is so regular, they can make plans immediately. If things follow their normal path, Mark will being staying late to work on the big project as usual. No doubt Angela is worried about those long hours, but probably only worried about Mark being run ragged. Jet grits her teeth thinking of it. "Soon I'll get her away from this mess," she promises.

After some careful thinking, Jet decides that the reporter will be just fine handling the nailing of Mark Williams. She will get a signal to her phone when the feed is going live, and that will be it. A quick vibrate and she'll know something is going on, and she'll know to turn to channel 7 to see if things go as planned.

Jet wants to be with Angela when this goes live. She wants to be with her little sister. She's saving them in one way, but the truth will be extremely painful at the same time. The Lunar has no mercy for her father or grandfather, but she won't let Angela or Laura suffer any more than they have to. Jet's thoughts shift and she randomly wonders, 'Maybe I should have just slit his throat and been done with it?' She shakes it off, correctly herself aloud, "He's going to pay, and I'm going to avenge both my mother and Angela for what he's done!"

And so it comes to pass that on Thursday night, around 6:45PM, a very sexy motorcycle turns the heads of everyone in the neighborhood of Kingswood. The rider gets some attention to. Jet ignores the strange peeking faces in the bay windows as she approaches the front door of the place she grew up. She rings the doorbell and waits for the door to be opened. Around here, that's the way it's done. There are peepholes and security systems, but Angela is too welcoming to waste time on those when only her good friends ever come calling.

Meanwhile, across town, Joseph is doing exactly what he promised. He has all the information Jet gathered in hand (she naturally kept copies hidden away) and is ready to make his sting. But it's not just a swoop in and out. Not yet. He's recording Mark Williams and his date entering the restaurant. He captures a kiss, a caress, a lot of looks of longing, as well. 'Tonight's news is gonna be something special,' he mutters under his breath. His assistant can only smirk as a small camera and a directional mic do all the work.

Jet finds herself staring down into the bright eyes of a younger version of herself. The door has swung wide open and there stands Laura, looking proud and happy as can be. Laura's just found out she's going to be in the cheerleading squad at her middle school and has the pom-pons out. In a voice warmer and gentler than any Jet ever thought possible the young girl says, "Hello! Are you one of my mother's friends?" When Jet hesitates, unable to really say anything, Laura calls out, "Mom! It's for you!"

Angela's voice Jet knows well enough. The years haven't changed it a bit. There's a constant calm to it, a joy that doesn't fade. Jet prays more than ever that it will always be that way. "I'll be there in a moment, dear!" The moment seems like ten eternities in one way, because Jet can't think of anything to say. Taking her little sister in drives out every other thought in her head. She's perfect. It lasts almost no time at all, because the Lunar realizes she could stand here forever, just looking at the young girl she's loved from so far away for so long. Angela Williams comes down the stairs to the door and her jaw drops. "Oh. My. God. Charity, can it really be you?"

Charity answers with a weak smile and a nod. She can't remember what she expected in this moment. She didn't expect to hug Laura out of the blue. "Laura.. I've missed you so much." The child, being kind and raised well, doesn't pull away, though she's unnerved by the hug. "Mommy, who is this?" Angela bites down on her lip, hesitates for a moment, and whispers her answer, "Lori, honey.. Charity is your big sister."

---

Mark is at home. His face is somber as he stares at a portrait. It's a picture of himself and other members of his family. Behind him, a young man with a hint of Asian features stands just as quietly. At length Mark turns to regard the other. "I've heard talk that your sister is in town," he says. His voice is painfully, pointedly neutral, leeched of all emotion. "You've talked about meeting her in the past. If she is, this is your chance. You need to go talk to Angela."

The young man nods, smiling with careful anticipation. "Thank you, father. I'd like that very much." He wheels and walks out, while a frown crosses Mark's careworn face.

---

Across town, Mark William's continues his fine night of wining and dining. After dinner comes a trip away from the restaurant. Joseph doesn't need to tail them, but he has it done anyway. He already knows where they are going, which gives him an even easier time covering his tail. "This guy's like clockwork," he comments with lazy disinterest. "And the kid's done all the footwork. Still, the kill is what I love. The truth is the real deal." And Joseph wants this deathblow to be anything but a coup de grace. The hotel arrangements would be tricky for most, but Joseph is far from inexperienced in social engineering himself. Still, it was Jet who found the hotel room that Mark would be staying in so they could have it all neatly prepared ahead of time.

"I have a big sister?" Laura sounds disbelieving at first. Angela's voice is nervous, and she is already starting to cry. Having to admit she lied to her daughter is hard for her. "Yes, sweety. I'm so sorry. We just didn't want you to be hurt." Jet draws back enough to look Laura in the eye. "So it's Lori now?" she asks, smiling through her own tears. A trembling hand glides the Lunar's fingertips over Laura's cheek. "You look so much like our mother."

"Does this mean we'll get to be together?" asks Lori. She's excited by the prospect of a big sister. She peers past and sees the bike. "That's so cool!" Jet laughs gently and nods, "I hope so. I have always wanted to be close to you, but our father seemed to think it was a bad idea. He said I was never to come near you." Jet wipes at her tears and sighs. She can't answer 'Why?' Her father's cruelty doesn't make sense to her. Tonight, though, he will pay for those choices.

Angela's guilt leads to a rather disruptive truth. "Charity, you.. There's more. Lori isn't the only one who doesn't know everything." Somehow, this confession is more difficult yet for the woman to make. "You have a brother."

Charity isn't upset by this at first. "You mean a half-brother?" she asks. When Angela shakes her head, it throws the Lunar off. She stays focused on Laura still, though this new point is making her think very hard. Jet's smile grows when Lori excitedly asks, "So will I be as pretty as you are when I grow up?" Jet answers gently, "I bet you'll be even prettier."

Joseph Hurst has put the kabosh on a lot of lies. He's ruined and vindicated more politicians in his career than most will even know of. His feed is clear, everything checks good. He doesn't get tasteless with it, but he gets close enough for there to be no reasonable doubt that Mark Williams is an adulterer, making his great 'family values' platform a complete farce. Joseph watches the feed come in and shakes his head, "This guy's not just a scumbag, he's a complete asshole. Still, I wonder what got the kid on his trail."

It doesn't make much difference in the end, just what led to the spark. It's all in the can and ready to go. Remote transmission has it to the editing room in time for the 9 o'clock news. Top story. Considering the growing intensity of the congressional elections, it's not shocking.

Jet finds herself sitting down with Angela and Laura and doing what she can to catch-up. Angela is nervous that Mark will go ballistic over having his oldest daughter in the house, but there's a certain quiet intensity in Charity that marks her as different somehow. More formidible than her father could ever hope to be. "You've been all over the place!" Lori says excitedly. Jet can't help but tell a few stories, toned way down for her younger sister's innocent ears. "I have been to a lot of places, but there's one place I need to visit yet." Charity looks to Angela, "And I'd like to take you and Lori with me." Angela looks more than a bit doubtful. There's no way Mark would allow it. Lori is all smiles, though, "Where is that, big sis?" Even though Jet's heard it for an hour, being called that makes her feel very warm inside. "I want us to go to Japan for a while, and visit our birth mother's family."

The discussion that was about to come is cut off. Jet's phone buzzes a moment, and she takes the time to pick it up. As arranged, her 'hellos' go unanswered. She clicks the phone off and shrugs, "That's weird." Noticing the time, she says, "Hey, could we flick on CBS? I know the weather isn't up yet, but with a bike it's really nice to know if there's rain coming, so just leaving it on mute would be great." And in Houston, there's almost always rain _somewhere_.

Angela isn't going to refuse such a simple request. She flicks on channel 7 and for a moment turns away. A flick of text catches her eye and sees a strange picture of her husband and the words Family Valueless are printed under it. "Actually, I'd like to hear this," Angela says. She flicks the station off mute, and the bad news is delivered to her at the same time it hits half the houses in Houston.

"'Allegations of infidelity are surfacing around the campaign of Mark Williams, running for the 22nd district against Nick Lampson. Mr. Williams' campaign has refused to comment.'"

"'The 22nd district has been touched by scandal since the indictment of Tom Delay...'"

The anchor's words spill across the screen accompanied by several pictures, showing Mark Williams eating with a woman that Angela has never seen. Then they show him kissing that woman, and even one of the shots from the hotel room. Angela clicks off the TV and just sits there, speechless. Charity frowns uncertainly, winding an arm around Angela, trying to support the woman as the world crashes down around her.

Over Laura's many questions and protests, Angela orders her upstairs to her room. Only when the child is gone does the woman ask, "How long did you know about this, Charity?"

There's no point to lies. That's what caused all this pain. "A few days," she admits. "It was the same thing he did to my mother. The same thing he did before he threw us out. I'm not going to let him get away with it. This time he's not going to throw his family away when it no longer amuses him." Charity shakes her head, "I think part of me hoped he would be different somehow. He's not, though. He is the same man he always was. Now I find he has a brother he's hidden from me as well. Is there any lie so great he wouldn't tell it?"

"You've embarassed me in front of all my friends. You've ruined his career! Who will pay for Laura's school if he loses his job over this?" Charity doesn't pause to answer, "If my sister needs help for anything, I will pay for it myself. No one I love will ever be left begging for scraps from my father's table. It's time to get rid of him. It's time for all of us to move on. Maybe now, losing what he perceives as his whole world, he'll be smart enough to change. He doesn't deserve another chance, but if that's your choice, go right ahead. I don't think life's long enough to wait for him to shatter your dreams again."

"Think about it a bit. I'm going to take my sister to see our mother, then we'll come back," says Charity. "That should give you a few hours to figure things out. When I return, you can either have your bags packed and be ready to take another shot at living your own life and having your own dreams, or you can stay here. I will help you if you want to get away from here. It's up to you."

"How can I trust you to bring Lori back?" asks Angela. The question is careless, and as soon as Angela hears her own words, she covers her mouth. "You know I've always cared about you, Angela. Do you think I'd ever put you through what my father did to me? You don't know how it feels. Not even now. I'm going to make damn sure you never have to feel the wound I have carried with me for the past ten years."

In the silence that follows, Lori lets Angela know - timidly - that there's a phone call, and the woman takes it. After a few minutes, she finds Jet again. "It - it's Cam. It's your brother." She holds out the phone.

Jet considers for a moment, then takes the line. "Hello?" She has no clue how this guy could know she was here. Perhaps that whole sibling sixth sense thing is going on. For some reason, though, she finds herself feeling a touch wary. She's not sure what to make of this surprise entry into her already complicated life.

"Hi, Jet," says the voice on the phone. "To be honest, what I know about you makes me think of that as your real name. Listen, I saw the news. Whatever your motives, I knew you'd want Angela to see it."

"I'm not sure what you know of me, but she did have the right to know," she replies. "I'm afraid our father hasn't changed one bit." Charity is curious about this Cam, though she is trusting him less and less as he speaks. "Perhaps you might know just why he didn't bother telling me that I had a brother?"

"You may be wondering why I appear in the memories of those around you, but not your own," the voice replies. "It is because I have inserted myelf in them."

"You had better explain yourself, dear brother," says Charity. At least she can take a hostile footing now. This is an enemy. "You have five seconds to convince me not to hang-up on you now."

"You've seen this work before, in Walla Walla," is Cam's reply.

"What do you want, robot?" demands Jet. "You want to try your luck with me? Not too wise, if that's your aim. Your pals haven't done too great when they've tapped on my shoulder."

"I want to be your brother, Jet. I want to be Mark's son. That's my purpose."

"You aren't. You're nothing but a machine," answers the Lunar. "You are a bit of flawed code given form. You've harmed those I value more than myself. It's a little late to play siblings, you fraud."

"Some of us are designed to learn to kill. Others to learn to manipulate. I am to learn to love. Your sister loves you despite the blood on your hands. I want the same consideration."

Jet has to think of this for a moment. "You're serious? What are you, the Tin Woodsman? Why don't you go and find the wizard yourself. Or better yet, how about you show yourself, and I'll show you some of the complexities of love."

"I'll be over, if that's what you want," offers Cam.

"I think that'd be a grand idea." Jet clicks the phone off and tries to focus her mind. She doesn't know how to fix this mind poisoning. She does know how to turn one of the assembled into a scrap pile, however.

It doesn't take long. A car approaches, parking out front of Angela's house, and a young man who could very well be Jet's twin brother climbs out. Lori recognizes him immediately and runs out, giving him a warm hug which he stoops to receive with a happy smile. "Hello, _oneko_," he says. He rises, seeing Jet approaching, and gives a polite bow. "_Konnichiwa_."

Jet doesn't return the bow, nor the greeting. "If you truly wish to learn to love, you can't start out by destroying the mind's of those you are supposedly going to care for." She is already making contingencies. If she kills him, her family is probably safer. They will think she killed her brother, but she's had to lose her family before. If misery is the only way to protect them, she's got no choice.

"Run along," whispers Cam. Lori complies, leaving the two alone. "Now what?" he asks.

"I guess there's nothing I have that your kind cannot take away. So did you attack my mother, too, you sick asshole?" asks Jet.

Cam shrugs. "I haven't attacked anyone. If you mean altered memories, everyone who should remember me does - except you."

"Let me tell you a bit about myself," says Jet. "When I was a young girl, my father threw me out. He stole my little sister from me. An accident killed most of my family. Alcohol stole my mother. I lost my entire family. I rebuilt my life from nothing. Everyone I ever loved either died or was taken away." The Lunar's eyes have a growing wrath in them, "I returned now, and hurt them in the hopes that maybe I could have a family again, but you've ruined that. You've taken them all away again. Don't talk to me about learning to love, you heartless piece of shit. I cannot destroy your hopes like I have my father's, but I will kill you for what you've done."

Cam holds up a hand. "Your father had no son. He has no other reason to resent you. Now he does. Now he doesn't have to hate you any more. Isn't that right?"

"My father betrayed my mother, he's a deceiving bastard who did anything his father told him to," replies Jet. "I don't care what he thinks. He's nothing to me."

Cam lets out a tired sigh. "Then why do you care if I'm his son?"

"You can stay here and be his son, but I want you out of my sister's head, out of Angela's, and out of my mothers," replies Jet. "You do that, and you might just achieve your farcical mission. You don't, and I promise you, I break you here and now."

"If I take myself away, I'll take away your sister's smiles when I've come. But you think I've already done some sort of terrible harm anyway, right?" Cam's voice is adopting an increasing note of bitterness. "You've lied to your family for years and you think I'm in the wrong."

"I haven't had a family to lie to for years," corrects Jet. "And is that emotion I detect? Or are you just screwing with me, tin can?" That's interesting. It seems upset. "Still, you have the brains of a machine. You think joy is all that matters to humans? You want to learn to feel, yet you haven't a clue what it's like. You're like some twisted puppet aping the actions of those around you."

"And so I don't have the right to know what it's like?" demands Cam.

"Tell me this, and I'll tell you if there's any hope for you to know what it's like, Cam." Jet doesn't like giving the thing a name. "What if your mission changes? What if you are changed and your new mission is to find out how to kill me?"

Cam shakes his head. "It's not like that. If they wanted you dead, they'd have to kill me - _me_, who loves. They might re-use my body and my components. They might get data from me. But it wouldn't be me anymore."

"Who the hell are _they_?" demands Jet. "Why are you here? What is the point of screwing with my life? Why did _they_ pick someone who is likely to kill you no matter what you say?"

"Because you're the least likely to love me," Cam answers. "If that changes, I've really succeeded."

"I will give you a chance to prove yourself," says Jet. "You have some pull with _they_, I imagine. If you ever want to be my brother, you're going to earn it. So far you've learned nothing about love. You've only learned about manipulation." The Lunar doesn't precisely like this, but she's considering options. "I want to take my mother, my sister, and Angela to Japan with me. If you help arrange that, you can come along. It will be a start. If anything goes wrong, though.."

Cam shakes his head. "We won't interfere. Neither will dad. I'll see to it."

"Good." Jet looks at her bike, then to Cam's car. "You're coming with me to get my mother. If you've stuck yourself in her head, she'll be more likely to listen to you than to me. That Japanese patriarchy bullshit, you know."

Cam nods. "Oh, before we go, I brought groceries. Can you help me bring them in?"

"You really are pushing it," notes Jet. "Can you even eat?" Still, she'll help, even if a big part of her would rather tear this guy's arms off.

After the groceries are put away, Jet explains that they're off to pick up Emily. Though Lori wants to go, she's given the duty of helping Angela pack. With more than a bit of ill-will, Charity has to admit that it never would have gone so smoothly without Cam. It's hardly the kind of 'help' that is going to win him any points.

Jet's new 'brother' knows exactly where to find Emily. It's something Jet would have had to work for. It's not the nicest apartment building in Houston that Emily Ito calls home, but it's not bad, either. "So do you come here often?" Jet asks curiously. Part of her is tempted to ask, 'Does our mother _think_ you come here often?'

Cam nods. "I try to visit everyone."

"But you sure did hang back and let your fellow researches take their shots at me and my friends," notes Jet. "Were you lurking about the last time I swung through town, or did you only recently write yourself into existance?" Barely tolerant is about as good as Jet can be right now.

Jet waves for silence before there can be an answer. "It doesn't matter. Your sense of reality is so skewed you probably wouldn't know the difference." The walk to Emily's apartment is an exercise in silence. Jet has no idea what reception she's going to get since her make believe brother has done such a good job with things. Jet knocks on the door, but she has little hope. In the back of her mind, she wonders if these are even the people she knows. She wonders if anything they feel is even real anymore.

The meeting with Emily is (for Jet anyway) a trip to the twilight zone. Cam's relationship with his psuedo-mother is decent enough. Jet finds her reception a little suspiciously warm, as well. At every chance she directs glares at Cam. She really, really wishes destroying him would somehow make things better. But her life hasn't been blessed with any luck that good since Luna gave her a second shot at survival.

Intense dislike aside, Jet and her aspiring brother are able to convince Emily to join them pretty easily. Even hearing that Angela will be coming doesn't scare Emily away. Throughout the conversation, Jet is sniffing at the air cautiously. Noticing nothing at all, not even a hint of drunken breath, provides her with one memory that won't be stained by Cam's appearance.

The car ride back is full of conversation. Emily tells of all the places she saw and loved when she had been in Japan, and Cam provides the necessary replies. Jet is silent. She doesn't know what to think or feel anymore, but she knows what looked like a day of victory is really a day of mourning and loss. The Lunar hated the assembled before. At least she thought she did. The truth is that she didn't know what hate was until this day.

Every moment up to the airport feels tense. Jet keeps expecting an ambush. What she doesn't expect is Cam's casual, disarming conversation. Despite his admission that he has basically fabricated memories and manipulated those around Jet into believing he exists, he has painted a remarkably detailed life story for himself. Jet infers from the conversation that he has had ups and downs, fallings out and reconciliations. In short, he has scripted much of his life to resemble Jet's own.

No attack materializes. Nothing untoward happens. Cam helps the women and children load their luggage. He buys slushies for Lori and Angela's son. He waves goodbye as the group pass through the security checkpoint. Then he is gone.

The flight is long, and uneventful. And in Jet's dreams, Luna smiles, and drapes a garland of roses upon Jet's brow. "You're learning, child," she whispers to the sleeping Exalt. "I never promised you a good life. But I've given you the power to have one. Make the most of it."
