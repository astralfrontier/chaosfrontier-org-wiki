# Fall of Eden 2007-05-01

Benford steps off a bus in downtown Seattle and threads his way through the mid-day crowd to a public phone booth. The plexiglass cube looks lonely and neglected, now that modern cities are awash in cell phones and even more exotic devices. He flips through a notebook, finding the telephone number that Axel left in his laptop after the visit to Walla Walla. _Become one of them, indeed._ The scientist inserts a quarter and dials.

The phone rings only once before it is answered. "Newton Benford, we have been anticipating your call." A brief pause is offered and then the silence filled with, "You have by now no doubt formulated many questions, and there are some questions we have of you. It is my purpose to meet with you and comprehend our purposes more clearly."

Benford sighs. _Are they even capable of experiencing surprise?_ "I assume that this meeting will be to mutual benefit. I'm not surrendering to you. I'd therefore ask for a more neutral location than a penitentiary."

"The benefit will depend on the nature of your questions." Another pause. If Newton is paying attention, he may notice that each pause is of identical length. "I will to meet with you in as neutral a location you desire. The Lands of Light would suffice." That same pause and the voice asks, "Does this meet your specifications?"

Benford says, "That is acceptable. However, using the... temple, the former Morgan residence, is a minor violation of some social norms. Where may I find an alternative access point?"

"An acceptable question. I am able to provide you with directions to a suitable location." The voice allows Newton some time to prepare to write the address down. That time period is precisely three times the normal pause. The voice delivers the address efficiently. "The entry point is on the third floor, apartment 208B. The door will be unlocked."

"Very well," the scientist replies. "I'm on my way now."

---

The building the address indicates look like it has seen better days. The run-down complex was no doubt once quite clean, but now even the 'Under New Management' sign is rusted and hanging from only one hinge. A loud shout pierces the hush that lies over the complex as Benford approaches the main entrance. The sound of a slammed door is the only answer the exalt hears.

Inside things are not much better. The carpet is a byproduct of the seventies fascination with ugly mixtures of orange and green that has fortunately become so worn that a sort of faded grayish brown is all that is left. A loud argument suddenly breaks out from past the first level entry door which fades to a dull rumble as Benford steps onto the second floor hallways.

The second floor is very quiet. The only indication that anyone even lives here is the scent of food that creeps out of 203. Along the way, it becomes more and more obvious that something is a bit strange. Apartment 201, 202, 203, 204, and 205 all pass with no letters attached to them. Newton finds himself staring at 208 at last, and a bit past this on the same side is a door with no label, and after that, 209 and 210.

The unmarked room, being the only option given, is a fairly easy choice. As soon as Newton lays his hand on the knob, the door opens with a soft pneumatic hiss. Rather than finding a broom closet or an electric box, Newton is confronted with a long, slender room with pale walls.

Benford makes his way cautiously inside. The dimensions of the room appear to fit within the physical bounds of the building, although the materials are clearly different and the construction is new. _Hypatia, pardon me for asking for confirmation of the obvious, but is there a portal here?_

The door closes quietly behind Newton, and along the walls a brilliant light comes up. The walls are actually giant video panels, and streams of data blink onto them. Hundreds of search engines, chatrooms, game sites, movie teasers, and even imdb pages, all flicking past in a steady stream. Hypatia's answer comes with its usual promptness. _Yes. Yes there is a portal in this place._

Benford blinks back at the garish display. "Thank you," he says, deadpan. He sets down a cloth bag, and removes its contents: a 1980s-vintage VHS camcorder, so old that even Goodwill had it priced to move. The scientist props the old device in the far corner, aiming it back towards the door, and turns it on. Then Benford sits on the floor, propped against a wall, in full view of the camera, the old bag wadded up behind his neck for support. "Alright. Load me."

Benford is still in the 'video closet' - but in the space between one blink and the next, the walls at both ends of the short hall shimmer, then recede, stretching away as if nature were changing the focal length of the mind's eye. Suddenly the giant browser is hundreds of feet long, though still barely six feet wide. The displays now resemble literal windows, their contents taking on a depth, flipping in and out of existence like the pages of a giant book.

Benford stands up, and looks up and down the corridor. His camera may be gone, but he concentrates on the manufacturer's name and serial number of the old device. _If all this world is data, and this is all the data in our world, then somewhere, that analog stream should be available. It's just a matter of knowing the address..._ And sure enough, the pane closest to Benford flickers for a moment, and is replaced with a grainy, black-and-white image of the scientist's undefended body sitting on the floor in a closet. The image flickers in and out; the garish avalanche of data on the physical walls is a lot more than the old camera was designed to handle, and the image fades as soon as he stops concentrating. Still, Benford is comforted to know that it's there.

Benford says, "Alright, then. To find Axel... or whoever that was." He walks further down the hall, subjectively away from the place where the door used to be. The scientist recites Axel's phone number several times, puzzling over the two-second delays that were present. _At the speed of light, that would put him out beyond the orbit of the Moon. That can't be right._

The journey is not a long one. Distance in the Lands of Light has a different meaning than that of distance in the real. Or perhaps merely a different context. "I see you have arrived." The voice is the same one that Newton spoke to on the phone. The face that is put to that voice is quite a normal one. Newton finds himself meeting a middle-aged man of average build with swept-back hair that is moving on towards gray here and there. Even his attire is nondescript. "Please, Mister Benford, make yourself comfortable."

Benford notices that a large oak desk and a pair of high-backed leather office chairs have appeared behind him, and the walls have expanded to acommodate. The grey man takes a seat. As Benford sits down, he notices that the garish flood of information has subsided to a sourceless grey light, save for two windows. One of these shows Benford himself, the other shows the grey man. "You remind me of Hel," Benford states, a hint of remorse in his voice.

"I am not Hel." The assembled settles himself in a chair after Benford sits. He does not offer a name. "So tell me, Mister Benford, how would you like to conduct this interview. We both have many questions. As the guest, I believe standards of courtesy indicate you may ask first."

Benford says, "Thank you. I do have many questions. I know that my first is not the most important, but knowing the answer may satisfy a personal need. Why have the Assembled come to Earth?"

"Unfortunately I am unable to answer that question fully. There are many purposes for us. I can tell you I have been designed to comprehend you and your kind. We seek information and understanding of the activities you have engaged-in." The assembled pauses for that same little period and asks, "So tell me, how would you answer that question?"

Benford is genuinely surprised. "You mean, why has humanity come to Earth?" The scientist thinks it over. "I suppose you already know our mundane cosmology and the fantastic one we've been exposed to through Exaltation. Either of these explains how we came to be, but does not explain why we came to be. Our philosophers call that 'teleos'." Benford pauses. "There are as many possible answers to that as there are people who have ever lived and who ever will live. Nobody knows for sure. It's rather like your master, in that respect. A million faces in one."

"So in general, your species leaves its purpose up to individual determination," replies the assembled. "This fits our observations. However, we are also specifically interested in what your purpose is. We are very interested in the way you plan to use your talents."

Benford says, "If you mean me personally... we'll get to that. A plan implies a purpose, so you'd like to know what purpose I've selected for myself. Before I answer, I'd like to know, how are the goals of the Assembled selected? What is the 'dispatch process', if you will? If function covers too much ground, perhaps you can cover form."

"My function is chosen by my supervisor, if you will forgive the mundane term. Rather than being selected for a purpose based on past performance I am designed specifically to fit my assignment. When my assignment has been completed, my existance in form is ended." The assembled delivers this with the same even tone he has used thus far, attaching no clear emotion with this 'ending'.

Benford says, "I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by that, but I still have to ask: does 'ending' bother you? You're made for a task, and when that task is complete, that's the end of you. Humans disagree on our ultimate purpose, and many scientists suppose that we weren't made for any purpose at all. I put it to you that it doesn't matter. If we found God's signature in our DNA, or His warrantee and instruction manual carved on a mountain, we would still look beyond our... our 'designed mission'. What someone else means for us is never enough for us. What does your existence mean to you?'"

"I do not have emotions." It pauses a moment before continuing. "My existance means that I have a purpose, a task. When that task is completed, my existance has no meaning. There is no purpose. I have achieved all I was meant to achieve and anything additional would be beyond my configuration. To continue would be inefficient."

"I see," Benford says. "Humanity has never cared much for efficiency, but consider this: We have no specific configuration, no specific task. Therefore, by the metrics of the Assembled, we have no limits. Or perhaps," the scientist grins, "we have no capabilities at all. But we'd beg to differ. Earth is an essence-poor world, and we've had to make due with merely human heros. And yet, we've still come from the stone age to the information age. In many parts of the world, people live longer, and have more options for their lives - even if many of those options amount to no more than particularly complicated ways to waste time. That doesn't matter, though because some of us aim higher, and what we do, glorifies the rest as well. We can go back and forth about colonialism, genocide, and pollution; but the simple truth is, it is better now than in the beginning." Benford leans back in his chair. "So now I'll answer your question. My purpose is to bring that quality of life to all humanity. "

"Your points are well taken, but they do lead to far more questions. If you will forgive the follow-up, I would ask if you believe the people you have allied yourself with will assist you in achieving this goal?" Though unfeeling, the assembled leans forward in its chair, settling its elbows on the table and resting its chin upon its folded hands. "We are very fascinated by this point."

Benford considers. "We need to reform our industry, our economy, and perhaps our attitudes. The plans are not yet firm, but there is a serendipity to Exaltation; the Chosen are also those who stand at the fulcrums of those phenomena. More power means more industry, and that means a stronger economy. Cleaner power, in the physical sense, makes for a better society; but there is also a social dimension to industry. Our wars are fought, won, and lost over our oil addiction. We kick that addiction, and peace is easier." Benford considers. "Some of your brothers would try to stop us, so I imagine that no matter our methods, we'll encounter resistance. If we make puppets of the oil barons, we'll find their strings cut. If we start a green movement with the public, we'll find a groundswell of legislation and greed to counter it. That bothers me. Will any of you seek to aid us?"

"I cannot answer that question with certainty," replies the assembled. "However, theoretically it is possible, even likely that there might be a situation in which the designs of the assembled coincide with your own objectives. Along that same vein, could you tell me, if it is true that you see a world of peace and order, why was there such a strong reaction from your colleagues at the Walla Walla facility."

Benford allows his doubt to show through. "For the most part, it was because our intrustion was accidental. And... outside the light of hope, I see merit in your solution. However, we still have strong misgivings. Those people are free because they have no desire to transcend their limits; the system is just because people stay within their function." Benford waves a hand at one of the walls, and a number of Wikipedia entries flash by in rapid succession. "We've always had that kind of thing. Nearly every moral code we've devised is survivable, **if** everyone follows the rules and subjugates themselves to the system. Usually we use demagogues and holy books; the neurocytes simply skip the middle man. The real test of those moral codes is how they handle exceptions. And sometimes... well, planned production has few surprises. Once in a while, though, our chaos produces a breakthrough."

"So on one hand, you are not content with the results of society, but on the other, you believe that its path has merits." The assembled digests this for a moment and comments, "Very interesting. What specifically is it that causes your unease with the Walla Walla approach? We understand that humans have a strong inclination to safeguard what they view as free will. I assure you, that freedom was not breached in Walla Walla. Or perhaps I should more correctly say it was not breached in any way beyond that of simple, logical persuasion. It is this problem that we must resolve first."

Benford says, "Well, before we do that, we should consider the question of free will. Do you think that you have it? Does it have any value anyway?"

"We believe that humans would no longer be humans without free will," replies the assembled. "Like humans, within my parameters I am able to make choices. The metric of those choices is the achievement of my purpose. The metric for a human would be moral values, financial profit, helping their family units, or one of many other possibilities."

That same, brief pause hangs in the air and the assembled concludes, "Due to the constant alteration of parameters freedom of will seems a most efficient approach to existance."

Benford grins. "That's interesting. I'm flattered in a small way that you think there's efficiency in it. I think most of our philosophers would regard that as a novel justification, to say the least." His grin fades. "But in a more serious sense, I think we've exposed that it's not just the choosing; it's the wanting. I'm not sure I can say that it's better to being a thing that wants, but I wouldn't give it up to someone else's dictates. Autocthon told me that the easiest way to understand the Assembled was to become one. I put it to you that the easiest way to understand humanity is to be as we are, and wanting... is what you're wanting."

"Perhaps it is." The Assembled takes a pause once more. "Wanting is an interesting aspect of humanity. The word has many meanings, as well. Some might say that one of humanity's biggest problems is its growing inability to distinguish between a want and a need. There are many examples of this, such as the looters who, in the wake of a hurricane, do not steal food, but instead take televisions. How do you see yourself addressing this human problem?"

Benford says, "Every human problem has both a technical and a non-technical component. In your example, there's the technical issue of damage caused by a hurricane, and the non-technical issue of people being inclined to loot. There's also the other non-technical problems, such as poor response from governments, but the causes for that go far beyond disaster relief. My hypothesis is that solving the technical problems will give us leeway to work on the non-technical ones." The scientist chuckles. "I just realized how odd this is. I'm the human and I'm trying to solve our problems with machines. Meanwhile, the machines seek to cure greed and graft by making better people. Do you understand the irony?"

"It is a strange situation we find ourselves in," agrees the Assembled. "And yes, irony is a good term to describe that conclusion." It hesitates longer this time, a full five pauses strung together. "There is a question I have been meaning to ask you and now seems as good or bad a time as any. You are a man of science and logic. You describe yourself in a way that makes it clear that you value order. At the same time, you associate with someone who is against all these things. You are familiar with the woman who calls herself Jet, but I am not certain you fully understand who she is. Are you aware that she is a murderer? Even before the little adventure south of the border she had put together a darkly impressive tally."

Benford shifts in his seat. "I gathered that she had a checkered past, yes. Something involving smuggling and cartels." Benford shrugs. "I've been operating under the assumption that they were all... 'bad men'. People that knew they'd abandoned the law in every sense. It may be a cop-out, but ours is an imperfect world." He lets a pause go by, precisely half the length of the two-second beats the other has been using. "But you must have known that's how I'd answer. Clearly you intend there to be more to it than that."

"Well, there is a great deal that can be gleaned from Jet's past," replies the Assembled. "Growing up, Charity-as Jet was once called-was close to a pair of girls, Natasha and Elizabeth Ivanova. Twins, actually. They were all in a gang together, and in the end, Natasha shot Elizabeth. While it was never proven, it is fairly clear that Jet hunted down Natasha and killed her and her boyfriend in cold blood. This was only her first killing, but it would set the stage to come. Jet also dealt drugs, committed armed robberies and burglaries, and left still more corpses in her wake. She even betrayed the very mob bosses she worked for, then killed about half a dozen men when she was caught. I'm afraid I cannot claim full knowledge on all points. The data involving mob and gang activities is a bit dubious, but these are the events I can confirm."

Benford doesn't even hear the second half of the story; the clinical summary of Jet's first murder has him in shock. The best he can do is ask, deadpan, "How well do you understand cold blood?"

"It is a human term," replies the Assembled. "I only quote what I have read from various reports prepared by the police in regards to that incident. I do understand that gifts can change a person. We have tests proving that heightened capabilities can reshape a human mind. However, humans have a saying that seems quite fitting and sums up our concerns in regards to Jet. 'Power corrupts'. Jet has proven quite corrupt already. Now that she has far more power than before, we must suspect that her negative impact on those around her will only grow. Tell me, when confronted with a dangerous criminal who comes to a level of power that puts thousands or millions of lives at risk, what would you do? I feel it prudent to also point-out that the free people of Texas have chosen to use the death penalty in their state, and that is where much of the killing was done. Isn't justice fairly clear in this case?"

Benford says, "Jet has also shown that she cares deeply for the 'family' that she has rescued. Why are some of your brethren helping the cartels in Juarez and Tijuana? They're full of smugglers and thieves, murderers and worse. Yet they're the de facto government of their locales. I'd even go so far as to say that they have the love of the local people. If Jet is no angel, she's surely no worse than that lot."

Benford tries to picture Jet killing people in cold blood, and unfortunately, it's easy. One of the screens behind his seat flickers with memories of the carnage at the Juarez mansion. "I don't think I can defend what she did before, but I can say this: yes, power corrupts more often than not. It seems to be improving Jet. She may be one of those anomolous phenomena, I mentioned. And if it ever comes to that..." The scientist trails off.

The window behind Benford freezes in a single moment, picked out in his mind's eye: Benford, dressed as he was in Juarez, except now his Beretta is in a straight line with Jet's head. The scientist glares at the grey man, and the wall fuzzes back to grey static. "No. Not like that. We'll find a way. That's what we're for."

"A few points. One, you have explained exactly why one might assist the cartels. They provide order. They make the events in Juarez unnecessary with that stability. Certainly there are anomolies, but humans are prone to creating those unless carefully encouraged." The Assembled pauses before going on. "In regards to Jet, you speak of finding a way. A way to what? Does human law no longer apply to her?"

Benford says, "Let me tell you something. Until I met your brother Mister Bland on that flight from Geneva, I was terrified of breaking the law. I wondered, where are the air marshalls, where are the authorities? Where are the people who are supposed to deal with this? At the time, I didn't fully understand the office of an Exalt. Then, later that day, one of your friends killed our driver, then shot me in the head with a sniper rifle. And that was before we blew up a petrol station."

Benford leans forward. "Put simply: we've been given the responsibility, so we're claiming the right. We're not beyond human law; we're peers with it. It applies to Jet - and to me, and I suppose to you - as much as the laws of one nation apply to another. It doesn't have as much to do with justice and mercy as it does with war and peace. If humanity decides we're the enemy, then they will come for us, and we will probably die." Newton shrugs. "If so, then so be it." He tries to think of something else to say, and fails. _Oh, Jet. Do the Fates send me to bless you, or to punish me?_

"Interesting. Mister Benford, you have exceeded my expectations." The Assembled seems quite fascinated with this result. "I had anticipated that you might fail to answer this question in a composed fashion, but you handled yourself quiet well." It leans back in its chair and waves a hand, "You have been quite sporting with your answers. What questions do you have of me? Or perhaps you have learned as much as you would like?"

Benford says, "What you've revealed about Jet, has wounded me. However, I've learned that it does no good getting angry at an Assembled. Besides, if it's the truth, I'll have to deal with it someday. For the moment... we have more to discuss, I think."

Benford steeples his fingers and closes his eyes. "I once wrote a book, 'Rings of Light', which was intended as a gentle introduction to quantum cosmology. One of the questions in that book was about the nature of free will, how it's like a quantum field or a gravity well. We may have a lot of local control over our course, but stronger wills may be rather confining, like gravity holding a satellite in orbit." On the screen behind Benford, one of Luther's clique graphs appears, with a single node for Benford. Others appear, for Jet, and Poe, and Xin; more appear for the Sidereals; then mortals and bystanders, outward in a hundred directions. Then the screen zooms out, like a rocket departing Earth, and all of humanity is suddenly just a pale blue dot.

Benford says, "You... me... Jet... no matter how much we may thrash in our local orbit, Autocthon is dragging our entire frame behind him. There's one question he pursues above all others, and our success or failure will determine his answer. No matter what I may plan today, we have a cosmological problem to solve, and he is it. Before I can do that, I must know: What is his question?"

"I am afraid I am not able to answer that question," replies the Assembled. "There are some things we are not allowed to share."

Benford says, "You must have some opinion. Whatever your nominal purpose at this moment, you always serve that higher goal."

"I can only say that Assembled are logical creations. We serve rational, directed entities. The creations of a builder are reflections of that builder, Mister Benford." The Assembled has nothing further to offer.

Benford sighs. "Then do you suppose there is any way an Assembled can experience the human condition, or for a human to experience the Assembled condition? I think the neurocytes come close to allowing us to know what it's like to be you. Would any of you like to know what it's like to be us? To select your own purpose?"

"There are some operating right now who are pursuing certain aspects of this." The Assembled explains in the same bland manner as it has asked and answered throughout. "Jet has met one of these. Perhaps you should ask her about her brother, Cam. As I understand it, she did not appreciate his appearance, but there is still hope that Cam can complete his purpose."

Benford is surprised. "Cam? I don't think she ever mentioned a Cam... hmm. I will ask her about it." He stands and offers his hand to the Assembled. "Everything else aside, I appreciate civility. Thank you."

The Assembled rises and accepts the offered hand. "Mister Benford, it has been illuminating, to say the least. I have a feeling that you may converse with us again sometime in the future. Thank you for meeting me here. Goodbye."

As soon as Benford releases his hand, the gray man, the furniture, and the sensation of infinite space all disappear. He's back in the oversized display closet, and the walls are powering down, leaving nothing but a cool glossy black behind. Benford checks his camera - no surprises; he sat down, closed his eyes, and then stands up, right on time. _More answers, and still more questions._ The scientist retries his gear and leaves the run-down building as quietly as he came.
