# Fall of Eden 2007-05-11

Even with a lot of catching-up to do, a flight over the Pacific leaves a lot of time to think. As one might expect, a lot of the stories Jet hears tell her a few things about Cam. Or at least about what Cam has written himself to be. Jet immediately picks up on the similarities between her 'brother' and herself. In her more distracted moments, she even finds herself liking some of the things Cam has done.

Jet's been wishing for this reunion for a long time, and so there are many moments where her guard against giving Cam a fair chance is lowered. But the problem that keeps coming back to her is the issue of reality. Anyone can make-up stories of being someone better, but to actually be that person is another matter. The Lunar frowns and wonders just how she can figure out who Cam really is. Does he even have a sense of self, or just a mission?

The Lunar can't think of a single way to prove or disprove anything Cam has been or pretended to be. She can look at official records, but they are obviously worthless. She can't ask her loved ones, because she knows Cam's written himself into their memories. It leaves her with no good options. Still, barring all else, the Lunar has her instincts.

Jet has never used an air phone before. The things are damnably expensive. Still, she has an impulse, and she trusts her impulses. Cam could just be an enemy, but if so, he would have used Jet's family against her. It's far more likely that his mission is exactly as he presented it. The Lunar finds herself calling home.

The phone rings and rings and rings. Jet sighs and guesses Cam is even more like her than she thought. The Lunar hates the phone. Finally, the ringing stops and she can hear Cam's voice, "Hello?"

Jet is a bit more comfortable not having Cam instantly know who she is. That robotic kind of precision would drive her nuts. "Cam, it's Jet. I've thought a lot about what you've said, and I've heard a lot of stories about you." There's no answer to that, and really what could he say? Jet sighs and finally decides, "Listen, you should come to Japan. Father can handle the mess he's made for himself. You probably want to bring his son, too. I have a feeling he'll want to focus on salvaging his reputation without distractions." Somehow talking about her dad's ruin helps bolster Jet's confidence. She can't help but smile a bit over giving the old man his just desserts. After still more silence, she demands, "Well, you gonna come or what?"

"I can meet y...." Cam trails off. There's silence for a moment. "I'll go buy a plane ticket," he says at last.

"Good idea," says Jet. "You can't go just popping around." She rolls her eyes, but somehow it amuses her. "Don't forget that you should probably bring our half-brother, anyway." She realizes something she didn't ask before. Didn't seem to matter, either. "So what did you think about dad getting in trouble and paying for it for a change?"

There's a long silence. Finally Cam answers, in a subdued tone. "Just because I didn't do anything about it doesn't mean I like it."

"Well, why didn't you do anything about it? And why do you think he should get away with everything he does?" Jet finds it really strange, but then it hits her. "But then again, if you lived as if you were his son.. he'd care about you. He threw me and my mother away like garbage and stole my little sister from me." The Lunar admits quietly, "I was close to doing something a lot harsher than this."

"I probably would have stepped in, if that'd happened," admits Cam. "Thanks for not putting me in that position."

"Honestly you were almost in that position anyway," says Jet. "Part of me still thinks it's crazy to give you a chance. But I do need to find out for myself if you have been good to my family or not. If you have been what they think you have, I'll think a lot of you. If not, well.. I guess we're back where I figured anyway. I don't know how to feel about you, Cam, and that irritates me."

"Well you'd hardly listen to me if I had any serious suggestions." Cam lets out a quiet sigh, almost inaudible. "Well what do you want? At least I'll never, ever forget your birthday."

Jet laughs softly. "You can't tell someone how to feel. I need to see what you are like. Reality matters to me, Cam. Just because the past was written in nicely doesn't mean I can believe that is who you really are." The Lunar's mood is obviously shifting more in Cam's favor, "So I want you to come over and join us. I imagine you speak Japanese just as well as I do. I want to find out more about where our family comes from. I don't feel any tie to my father's blood. It rejected me and it has shamed itself beyond my forgiveness. I want to see what is left of my mother's family."

"I'm fluent in over six million forms of communication," the young 'man' jests lightly. More seriously: "I've done a little research, but I'd like to see it for myself as well. Japanese geneology is really interesting, if you get into it."

The Lunar rolls her eyes and sighs. "Well, you are amusing, and it's hard to think of you as an enemy right now." It makes Jet a touch suspicious, but she's not going to change her mind. "So get yourself on a plane, get over here, and we'll explore. I have a feeling there's a lot we can learn."

"Okay, I'll be there."

---

Having the conversation with Cam behind her, Jet feels curiously good about herself for the rest of the flight. She even manages to fall asleep without so much as a flicker of a dream. When the plane touches down at Narita International the Lunar is confident, calm, and feeling a strange energy inside herself.

Jet helps Laura with her carry-on and finds herself in an odd position, providing support to both her mother and the woman who stole her father away. She has no idea what Angela's choice will be in the matter, but Jet knows that it won't change the affection she feels for the woman who never meant to cause her any harm.

The first step in the airport draws out a deep sigh from Jet. Emily looks up at her daughter curiously. The Full Moon says quietly in Japanese, "I have found my people at last." Laura senses what Jet means, as well. For the first time Jet, Laura, and Emily blend in. Their skin and their faces mirror those around them. "It is good to be home," Emily says at last.

Cam has called ahead and arranged a car. He didn't book Jet and friends into a Western hotel; he selected a _ryokan_ instead.

Cam's choice of Ryokans is enough to win a lot of approval from Jet. The luxurious Hotel Senkei offers not only a traditional feeling of what it means to be Japanese, but also offers a view that is simply breathtaking. After the family is shown to their room Jet settles at the table and looks herself over. "Everything is right except me," she murmurs to herself. Her clothes are utterly wrong here, and she feels herself longing to immerse herself in this land that is so strange to her. Jet doesn't want to feel Japanese. She wants to be truly Japanese.

Laura is still busily poking about the room and she happens upon a long, ornately-wrapped box. The tag on it is something she can't read, and so she brings it to Jet, asking excitedly, "What does it say, Charity?" The Lunar's eyes drift over the characters and she answers softly, "It's a gift from Cam." The Lunar hesitates a moment, then opens the box slowly. Inside she finds a beautiful kimono. The fabric is midnight blue, and the full disc of the moon has been worked into an image of the night sky upon it. Jet also finds a silk obi, a pair of tabi and geta.

"You should put that on," suggests Angela. Jet looks over the gift and sighs softly. "I don't know how." Somehow that admission is horribly shameful to the Lunar. Feeling her mother's hands rest on her shoulders rouses Jet from that painful feeling and Emily says, "I will teach you."

Jet isn't the only one who learns from the experience. Angela and Laura both help, as well. "This reminds me of so many New Years shrine visits," admits Emily. Jet finds herself feeling and looking more like a Japanese princess than a wandering American cast-off. She holds her left hand up and laughs softly, "So this is what it's like to feel like myself." Emily laughs at the strange comment as well and notes, "You do look like a proper woman now. I wish your grandmother and grandfather could see this. They would be so proud." Laura bubbles with excitement and says, "You look like you came out of a fairy tale! I want to wear a kimono, too!" Angela nods quickly, "They are right. It really suits you, Charity."

---

The ryokan is indeed high-class. Jet is reminded that all strata of Japanese society enjoy essentially the same sorts of comfort - she is convinced, for example, that one of the men enjoying the onsen is a high-ranking _oyabun_, a leader among the Yakuza. She sees other people here - tourists and travelers from elsewhere, native Japanese, couples and individuals.

She also sees a trio of men checking in on the third day of her 'vacation'. They comport themselves with the deadly grace and nigh-mechanical precision of hired killers, though they outwardly have the bearing of simple tourists.

Cam himself hasn't arrived yet - he sent out his flight schedule, but he hasn't come to the _ryokan_ yet, saying that he had something else he wanted to take care of.

While Jet might be suspicious of something like that normally, she finds herself trusting Cam. She knows if she were here on her own for a bit she'd find some more grown-up play. It makes her wonder just how much alike she and Cam are. While Laura and Angela are learning some Japanese from Emily, Jet is able to snoop about. She may trust Cam, but she doesn't trust these strange men who have shown up today. She does her best to keep an eye on them, and on the man she suspects has a lot to do with the Yakuza. As a matter of course, she's using her natural charms to try and get in conversations with the one she suspects is the target of the hit.

The suspected _oyabun_ calls himself Tokugo-san. He is a somber-seeming man who speaks quietly and keeps to himself. He has a wife and two adult sons, who Jet briefly sees but does not meet. He is polite, but distant, and seems to have something on his mind. Nevertheless his conversation is adequate, and he seems accepting of Jet.

Jet maintains a respectable distance, but finds him somehow fascinating, though she cannot say just why. Perhaps he's the father figure Jet always imagined for herself, maybe it's just his calm that fascinates her. The Lunar realizes through these conversations that she's never had a normal relationship with a man before.

Feeling more certain than ever that she wants to protect Tokugo-san, Jet decides to focus her attention on the trio of would-be killers. She doesn't imagine she can easily charm them, but she can figure out what they are doing, where they are going, and what their scents are.

Jet senses the urgency in the way the assassins move and handle themselves. They are going to act soon. Sending three men indicates to Jet that this hit is very important to whoever is arranging it. She worries that being a hero might put her family in danger. Still, Takugo-san has a family as well. It's an easy decision for Jet to make. Explaining to her family that she is going to take a walk, Jet slips out and starts to survey the room where Tukugo-san is staying. She already has figured out a few of his habits, and she imagines he'll be eating with the room open to let the air in. The foliage and the terrain make it a shooter's paradise. Jet's got her work cut out for her. This isn't a job for a human. The Lunar's body begins shifting and with a soft growl the siberian tigress darts off to hunt, her nose sorting through the scents in the air quickly.

It seems that Jet's instincts were right, but her caution with regard to her own family may have hindered her from arriving in time. Still, perhaps not. She watches three gunmen training their sights through the open space. They are not targeting Tokugo. They are aiming for his wife and sons.

As Jet prepares to move, she can see, hear and smell the discharge of three silenced pistols. Already she is in motion, yet out of the corner of her eye she can see Tokugo himself move with impossibly fast speed and precision. He has leapt from his kneeling position and seemingly flails about. But Jet also knows that the gunmen would not have missed. Yet Tokugo's family are unharmed. He intercepted the bullets with his hands.

Jet measures the distance and knows of only one way to cross it in time. A burst of brilliant essence arcs around her and she rushes forward with impossible speed. She throws herself from the earth, her massive paws thrown wide to send her crushing weight slamming into the gunmen, not to destroy them, but to ruin any hope they have at aiming.

The assassins are skilled, but they are still only mortals, and Jet is blessed by Luna with more than enough power to overcome them. The Lunar doesn't want to destroy them, though. She wants to put the fear of god in them and find out why they were sent. Her teeth break wrists and twist ankles, a swing of a paw throws a silenced gun into the hopeless tangle of undergrowth. In short order all the men are disarmed and seriously wounded. The Tiger then rushes out of sight for a moment, and Charity comes back moments later to confront the men as a woman.

She finds that she might as well have changed back right in front of them. The three are dead. Jet is a heartbeat too slow to grab the jaw of the last man. Too late to stop him from biting into a cyanide pill. She swears at him in Japanese, but her demand for who sent him will not be answered here.

Having nothing more to do here right now, Jet turns her attention to Tokugo-san, moving away from the dead men and calling out quickly, "Are you okay?" She's not sure how loud she should be. She's not even sure what Tokugo did to stop the bullets. The Lunar doesn't know if even her speed would be enough to catch a bullet, much less three of them at once.

Tokugo-san is sitting - or rather leaning - against the short table of his room. His wife is already boiling hot water with a concerned look on her face, and one of his sons is improvising bandages from the linens. As Jet approaches, he waves them away, smiling with that uniquely Asian blend of humility and embarrassment that indicates one is receiving too much service. Already the Lunar can see the bloody wounds of his hands closing themselves off.

The Lunar looks back over her shoulder, shaking her head. Still, she has a feeling that Tokugo-san will know exactly who sent the killers. She is not hurt, herself. The only serious struggle she had to confront was making her way through the forested terrain without damaging her clothes. When she draws close enough, she bows politely and apologizes, "I am sorry, I should have been faster."

For the first time, Jet hears the man's wife speak as she bows. "Thank you so very much, _o-tora-sama_," she says, speaking politely and referring to Jet's tiger form. Tokugo-san himself smiles wanly and holds up his hands. "Amaterasu's blessing smiles on us all. Thank you, shapeshifter. Those precious to me are unharmed."

Jet knows only a little of Shinto, but she knows the name of the Sun goddess. The Lunar seems at first uneasy that she has revealed herself, but the ease and calm with which she is welcomed drives that nervousness away. "It is my honor to serve your family, Tokugo-san. Somehow I felt they would try to harm you. I am relieved that they have failed." She looks back again and says, "They have taken their lives, but they still end in shame."

"They came to reclaim their honor. To take vengeance for their brothers." Tokugo does not speak of blood-related siblings, but the implication of a similar bond is present. "Come with me to pray for them at the shrine tomorrow."

"I would be honored," agrees Jet. She looks to the sons and the wife of Tokugo-san, making sure they are indeed unharmed and unafraid. "Do you know if there will be more?" she asks. It would not be the first night she did not seek sleep to guard something she cared for.

"I have .. buried all the others," Tokugo-san says quietly. "There will be no more."

Jet bows again, "Then I will sleep tonight." Or she will try. "I will be ready before dawn." She will have to ask her mother to give her a crash course in proper behavior at a shrine. She dimly recalls water for cleansing the mouth and hands, but little else.

---

It is just before dawn when the _okami_ wakes Jet with a message: "The gentlemen is ready to see you."

By then Jet has been prepared for her visit to the Shrine. She is dressed in a plain white kimono. The Lunar has bathed to cleanse herself of the taint of the dead as instructed by her mother. She goes to meet Tokugo-san with a steady, calm step.

Tokugo-san and his wife meet Jet outside. The shrine is some miles distant, the man explains, but the walk will do them good. His wife is demure and silent, seemingly accepting the supernatural events around her. Tokugo-san himself seems in good spirits; calm, but not any further subdued. He has resigned himself to the night's events and now faces a new day.

"I deeply regret that my family's business has interfered with your own enjoyment of Nippon," Tokugo says at length as the three walk. The silence seemed to have built itself up to his statement, and now his words seem quite natural.

Jet finds herself drawn to these people she has protected. The Lunar finds she is not troubled by what happened the day before. "You are very kind, Tokugo-san, but I promise you that the beauty of my homeland has not been diminished. I was not made the way I am to live a quiet life."

"Amaterasu made the Sun to set. Tsukiyomi made the moon to change. Even Susanoo's storms must subside," Tokugo says gently, and Jet realizes that he is chiding her.

Jet smiles, looking down at her feet. "I am young, and being restful is not a trait often attributed to youth." She doesn't know why, but it feels good to be treated this way. "But I will try to learn the art of the still."

"You are right. For you, the moon is still bright," remarks Tokugo with a smile. He takes his wife's hand, squeezing it gently, and she smiles up at him.

The three travelers pass through the _torii_ gate and approach the water of purification. The hand-washing is elegant in its simplicity. Tokugo-san rings the gong, attracting the attention of the temple's _kami_, claps his hands, and bows. His wife follows suit.

Jet cleanses herself slowly; first her hands, then her mouth are made clean. Her prayer is a simple one. She seeks wisdom and offers a prayer of respect for the men who died in the pursuit of honor. She does not know what Luna will make of such a prayer, but the Full Moon knows if anyone will hear her, her patron goddess will.

Tokugo's next act is rather more secular. He approaches the priest of the shrine, who bows quite deeply to him - more deeply, Jet notes, than would be indicated by their stations or positions. A donation is proffered, rejected, insisted upon, and humbly accepted. Taking his leave, Tokugo rejoins his companions and smiles. It's an almost cautious demonstration of emotion from this man who wraps himself in a veil of silence. "Thank you for joining me."

"It was an honor, Tokugo-san," replies Jet. She bows deeply to the man and his wife, as well. "If you have any need of me, please do not hesitate to let me know. I shall be staying for some time."

---

In the days following the shrine visit, Jet meets Tokugo-san several times, sharing only a few polite words and little more. The Lunar begins to wonder if she will find a good time to ask her more serious questions. That question is answered when she finds she has been invited to a meal with Tokugo-san and his family.

As with the shrine visit, Jet finds that Tokugo-san and his wife shall meet her. The Lunar is not sure why that might be, but it is not the first time parents have kept their sons away from her. She bows politely to her hosts and offers Tokugo-san's wife a small gift as a sign of her affection. The gift is an ornate obi, picked-out with great care by Jet and her mother. Jet notices that she is naturally quiet when near Tokugo, but does not think this a bad thing.

Tokugo is polite and receptive. He is still calm, still faintly dusted with the air of melancholy he possesses, still possessed of the unfathomable reserves he has sometimes hinted at in his behavior. He has the aura of the ocean itself about him.

Jet doesn't know how one can be that calm. The man could out-wait a mountain. She finds herself making little more than small talk, without reaching her real questions. At last, though, she thinks Tokugo-san might indulge her curious nature, and asks him what has been on her mind since she saw him catch those bullets. "Tokugo-san, I have met a few others who are blessed by Amaterasu, and helped them as well. They were often forced to hide their gifts and when they revealed themselves they were beset by enemies. How is it that you avoid those enemies?"

"You have now met all the people who know that I am _kami_," Tokugo answers with a smile. "The priest who was present at my ascension. My wife. And my sons."

Jet seems surprised by this, but does not need to ask more. "I wish so few knew my secrets," she admits quietly. "But my family has not yet learned of it. I do not know how they would react to it." The young Lunar has little else to ask. At least not for a time. She is trying to figure out just how many realize that she has gifts now.

Tokugo nods gently in no particular direction. Without a word his wife rises, bows with a polite smile to Jet, and takes her leave of the dinner table. A moment of silence follows her, and the older man speaks. "How could I have kept something so important from the ones I love so much?" he asks, speaking apparently his own thoughts, but intending something more for Jet. "How could I say I loved them without sharing who I am with them?"

"I am afraid," Jet admits. "I love them, and want them to know, but I do not want them to run away from who I have become when I have only just gathered them to me again." She frowns thoughtfully and decides, "I will tell them all. They deserve the chance to make their own choices."

Tokugo manages a smile that only a patriarch - not merely a father - could muster. Jet can see pride in his eyes as he leans over and grasps her shoulder, giving a reassuring squeeze. "If they love you in return, they will not run away."

"Then all will be well," Jet says quietly. She finds herself smiling and relaxing a moment later. "I think my little sister will really like it. My mother's reaction is harder to predict." Not mentioning her father speaks volumes in itself. "I imagine she will think of me as kami."

Tokugo nods. "Then be _kami_."
