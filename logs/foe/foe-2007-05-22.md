_Ten years earlier..._

It's a hot day on the set, and the humidity feels like a record high. The casting director seems to ignore the sweat dripping down his face as he walks down the line of stuntman candidates. "All right, listen up, gentlemen. Your task is to climb to the top of the wooden scaffold, fetch down the flag, and return again." He gestures onto the set, toward what, but for its height of thirty feet, seems no more than a rickety pile of splintered logs.

"This is a model of a burning building, so if you touch the ground, that means you fall into the fire and die. Certain logs are painted black - those beams are on fire. If you touch one, you die. Fastest one to grab the flag and survive wins." He turns to the first candidate. "All right, you - you're on first."

Ran Zhenli has not made many friends on the set today; his attitude is not just that he's better than everyone else - most of his competitors have that - but that he's some sort of royalty and the others are beneath him. He misses no chance to mock the other candidates when they fail the test, or if they simply miss a jump or stumble on their way up and back. But for all his raucous attitude, he certainly knows his stuff. He clambers up the logpile with lightning speed, vaulting over "burning" logs with inches to spare, climbing up ropes with boneless grace. He lands lightly on one foot in front of the stunt director, who clicks the stopwatch with satisfaction. "Best time so far," he says. "Xin! You're up next!"

There's a certain fluidity to Lao Xin's movements, that much is obvious as the would-be stuntman pulls himself up the side of a wooden ladder meant to be a firetruck. He dives through a suspended "burning window" of four black logs, fitting neatly through. They barely even jostle from his passing through. The other thing that quickly becomes clear about him, is that he doesn't stop. Every action leads to another. There's no pause to regain balance or bearing, he simply moves.

Suddenly, there is a clatter, and a yell of panic. One of the referees, positioned on the platform to make sure the candidates don't touch the black logs, has slipped and fallen onto one of the dangling logs below; even from here, Xin can see the rope begin to fray... and the pile of jagged, broken timber twenty feet below. The referee starts to swing his body, trying to get clear of the wreckage, but he doesn't know about the fraying rope.

"No! Hold still," shouts Xin, though even as he shouts he's stopped dead in his tracks. He looks back toward the top of the tower for a moment, then with a grunt turns towards another of the dangling logs. Xin can almost imagine hearing the sound the rope makes as it frays apart. When he lands its with an outstretched arm, his torso hanging over the edge of the log. A foot has twined in the rope and his other leg around the log.

The referee reaches a grateful hand up to Xin, clasping it firmly. Seconds later, there is a twang and the strained rope finally gives way, sending the referee's former perch spiraling down, down, until it's shattered into splinters by its brethren at ground level.

Xin asks the man, worry in his voice, "Can you get down from here? I've got to get to the top." It is clear he expects the man to say no, he needs help, and to have missed this chance.

"I'm fine," says the referee. "Go on! I saw how you move - you can still make it!" The man looks down at the ground, his complexion slightly green, and then grins sheepishly. "I'd be grateful if you'd come and get me after, though," he adds.

"If you're sure you don't mind hanging around," says Xin. Action heroes wish they could be this cool. Or, so Xin thinks. Either way, he's off again, leaving the referee swinging slightly on the log as he pulls himself back up where he was. Xin's hands sting and some of the rope fibers have nestled themselves in between the folds of his fingers, but he makes it, and resumes his ascent, flipping over logs, pouring in every ounce of strength and speed he's got.

The stunt director clicks the stopwatch as Xin lands before him, bearing the flag. "Five minutes thirty-seven seconds," he says impassively. It's only twelve seconds longer than Zhenli's time, and far shorter than anyone else's that day. "Not bad." And the stunt director winks at Xin as he turns back to the rest of the candidates. "Next!"

---

Ran Zhenli pounds the table. "You've got to do something, Grandfather! I beat his time by twelve seconds! I deserve the part! Talk to the stunt director or something!"

The old man opposite Zhenli, in the trailer, is not his grandfather by blood, of course. Their relationship is more of a... working relationship, as is evidenced by the two men, in sunglasses, standing behind the wizened _tong_, who stand with their arms folded. "I _did_ speak with the stunt director, young Zhenli. He told me of a detail that was omitted in your account." The old man nods out the window, where even now a tearful and smiling older woman - the referee's mother - is even now giving Xin a grateful hug. "Your skill is undeniable, but there is more to _kung fu_ than skill. Your rival saved a life today, and still nearly managed to best you." The man shakes his head, drawing on a cigarette. "If I asked the stunt director to give you the part, how would I explain it to _her_?" He gestures to the window.

Zhenli is clearly still outraged, but has enough control to avoid overstepping his bounds with his superior in the Family. "Well... do something about Xin, then! An accident, or something!"

The old man sighs. _Young people have no respect today,_ he thinks to himself, as countless old men have thought before. "This is between you and Xin, Zhenli. If you feel your _kung fu_ is stronger than his, you must prove it to him yourself. But!" The man leans forward. "Do not do so unless you are _sure_ you are the stronger. Remember how close he came to beating you, despite his distraction." He leans back, pointing at Zhenli with the cigarette, and says, pointedly, "I do not know if I can have a grandson who does not know his own limits. If you do decide to challenge Xin, _do not fail_. Do I make myself clear?"

Zhenli simmers angrily, but bows. "Very well, then. I will not disappoint you, Grandfather."

_Present day..._

"Someone left you a message," the woman says to Xin, glaring at him. The suspicion she'd had when he'd last come asking about his sister has deepened to open hostility, as if she'd heard something that had made up her mind. Though she had only been taking care of Xin's sister for a few years, she's obviously come to think of her as her own daughter, and somehow she's convinced that Xin is her enemy. "He said he was going to 'deal with you' once and for all."

The note's calligraphy, though perfectly readable, gives the sense that the writer was in a hurry. "Hong Kong, June 3, 1998. 12 seconds." The date of the screen test, and the time difference of the trials. Following that is an address in a run-down part of town, and a time: 7:00 AM.

Xin arrives at the designated time, and looks up at the building. It looks like typical tenement housing, run-down, with a considerable number of broken windows, crumbling masonry, and wooden shutters dangling from their casements. The CONDEMNED poster on the front door is tattered and faded with age. There is no sign of anyone present... at least not at first.

A Chinese man, about Xin's age, comes around the corner of the building, holding a flaming torch. "Hello, Lao Xin. I don't suppose you remember me," he begins, smiling - or rather, his mouth is open and his teeth are showing. "Just another would-be stuntman trying out for the latest movie role, only to be beaten out for the part by a mere **minus** twelve seconds." His eyes flash angrily in the sunlight that has begun to bathe the building, glinting brilliantly off the shards of the windows. "Would you care for a rematch?"

"Ran Zhenli," says Xin, "It wasn't about the time... it was about _kung fu_." The flickering flames dance in his eyes, "This is madness."

"That's easy for you to say!" snaps Zhenli, outraged. "You're the one who..." The young man regains control of his temper, with difficulty. "People _thought_ your _kung fu_ was stronger that day," he goes on. "Today, they will see the truth. Jia!" he calls out. On cue, Xin's sister leans out the window, smiling and waving a long white banner. "Long time no see!" she calls back, cheerfully. Whatever stories her foster parents had heard, Jia herself apparently bears her brother no ill will - although there is, too, an impish glint in her eyes, as she had always had when she would play a prank on her sibling.

"Jia!" Xin's eyes are watery as at long last he's found his missing sister. "What have you done to her," asks Xin in low, careful tones without drawing his attention away from his sister. "Jia! Hang on! I'm coming for you!"

Jia grins happily as she ducks in the window again. Zhenli says, "Me? I haven't done anything to her, Xin. I've just told her all about your adventures with the _tongs_." He gives a moment for that to sink in, then grins again, this time truly in amusement. "Unfortunately for me, she thought that was kind of cool. Or perhaps I should say... fortunately." He winks. "You remember the screen test, right, Xin? The banner represented the victim to be rescued, and that pile of logs was a building." He pauses. "A _burning_ building." And with that, Zhenli tosses the torch into a pile of glistening rags next to the front door. The rags catch alight instantly, sending a tower of flame to rival the brightness of the sun on the building's walls. "Let's see if you can reach her first." And with that, Zhenli runs toward the building, diving into a window right _through_ the rising flames.

"NO!" Xin dives in, kicking through the flaming door. It's just like ten years ago, he moves without stopping... and he remembers ten years ago, Zhenli's taunting, his anger, how he moved. _I've got to reach her._

As Xin emerges into the hall, a door bursts open beside him, with a rush of flame, and Zhenli steps out. Despite the roaring flames behind him, Zhenli seems not only unharmed, but entirely untouched. "A good start, Xin," he says, somersaulting forward and flying toward Xin, foot outstretched.

"H..how?" And then there's no more time for words. Xin reacts instinctively, flipping backwards, under the flying kick as flame licks the walls of the hallway. There's a roar of fire as the Zhenli nears Xin. "Ran Zhenli," shouts Xin, as the roar from the fire subsides, "You cannot defeat my _kung fu_!"

Zhenli uses the momentum from the near miss to bounce off a wall, and flies back at Xin again, arms raised. "We shall see!" Though his movements lack the fluid grace of Xin's style, the lightning speed and sheer raw energy of his strikes serves to compensate, his fists seeming to flicker like the flames that begin to creep up the walls.

Xin seems to fly towards Zhenli, his fists moving out to either side. Fire makes their shadows dance, as Xin strikes in kind, using the conflicting blows as his first step towards moving past the man and up towards his sister.

Zhenli is forced on the defensive for a few moments, though he blocks Xin's attacks with the same blinding swiftness. As he's backed toward the stairs, he takes a quick leap backward, then kicks out sideways into the wall. There is a snap as his foot smashes through the wooden support beam, and a crash - the hotheaded martial artist jumps forward again just ahead of a cave-in, burning debris landing in a pile behind him. "Catch me if you can, Xin!" cries Zhenli, somersaulting backward through the flames.

Xin is moving again, kicking through the smouldering rubble, though he does not come away as untouched as Zhenli. There's a mad rush as more of the building starts to collapse, left weakened by the flames and the kick, leaving Xin feeling much warmer.

The stairs lead up just one flight before being blocked by rubble too tall to climb, and Xin starts down the hallway. The door is open into one of the abandoned apartments, and standing in the doorway is Zhenli - or rather, the silhouette of Zhenli, the sunlight shining directly down the hallway and right at Xin. It's clear that Zhenli had this set up and timed to force Xin to look into the sun here - and sure enough, Zhenli comes at Xin, relying on the dazzling light behind him to distract his foe.

Much to Zhenli's surprise, though, there is no moment of distraction by the dazzling light. Xin comes in full force, not even squinting as the brilliant sunlight spills out from behind Zhenli and over Xin. It seems to glow a little brighter as Xin's foot collides with Zhenli. The walls are thin and plaster falls from the sheer force of the impact.

Zhenli climbs to his feet, groaning. "Uhg. What the..." he begins, but the stupor lasts for but a moment, and Zhenli is on his feet, running back through the hole in the wall, his mocking attitude gone, only an angry determination not to let Xin get the better of him again. "Come back here!"

Xin is prepared for Zhenli this time. As he rounds a corner, an old deteriorating chair comes flying straight for Zhenli, followed by a rather furious shout that heralds a flying kick intended to drive the man back into an old door. "Give up this madness, let's just get Jia and get out of here. You cannot defeat me"

"NEVER! You are the one who will lose!" This time, Zhenli's fists move faster yet - _too_ fast - impossibly fast. Xin knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that he would never have been able to dodge Zhenli's blows as a mortal. Zhenli's already-ragged hair flies in all directions, his bleached locks seeming to glow like flames - and Xin smells the odor of burning hair.

"You have learned much, but do you truly understand what your _kung-fu_ is?" And Xin redoubles his efforts. This time he does not hold back in his movements, he strikes faster, almost as impossibly fast as the other young man... the sunlight filtering in through the holes in the wall seems brighter, less hazy...

"Impossible!" Zhenli is caught by a side kick from Xin and goes flying back toward the stairwell. Just as he flies past, a gout of flame bursts into the hall as part of the roof collapses between them. And through the burning rubble stalks Zhenli - his entire body appearing to be on flame, as if kindled by the rubble, yet leaving him untouched. "It... ends... NOW!" cries Zhenli as he begins to break into a run toward Xin...

...and then there is a scream from the next stairwell, a woman's scream that is sickeningly familiar to Xin - and, as it turns out, to Zhenli as well. "Jia!" he cries out, his eyes widening in horror. The flames around him flicker and wink out as he hurries toward the stairs, ignoring Xin completely.

"Jia!" cries Xin at around the same time as Zhenli does. He turns and rushes up the stairs, taking them two and three at a time, even kicking off of narrow walls to speed his ascent towards his sister, "Jia!"

As the two martial artists race up the stairs - no longer racing each other, but instead racing against time - they can't help but notice that a significant section of the building has collapsed - they can see the burning debris at the third floor and an increasingly wider missing chunk of the floor as they climb up. And when they reach the top floor, there is Jia - backed up against what used to be the corner of a room, with the flames creeping closer to her - and a yawning, twenty-yard emptiness between her and the stairwell. Zhenli pulls on his hair. "No! This is my fault!" He looks at the distance with dismay. "I can't jump that far! Xin, what do I do?"

"Trust me. That's what you do." Xin looks back down at Jia, "Everything's going to be alright..." He addresses Zhenli, gesturing at the gap as he braces himself near the edge of the yawning emptiness... "You ever read comics, Bub?" And then, as he prepares to help launch Zhenli through the air, "Keep her safe."

Zhenli doesn't read comics, and has never heard of the Fastball Special, but he quickly catches on to what Xin has in mind, balancing on Xin's cupped hands as he coils himself to leap. The two rivals act as one, each calling on their literally God-given talents to do what needs to be done - and Zhenli sails through the air, landing easily in front of Jia. "You come round the side!" calls Zhenli, as he busily begins grabbing armfuls of burning furniture and rubble and tossing them into the abyss...

Xin moves around the side of the building, balancing nimbly on crumbling windowsills. He reaches a fire-escape, and with a short series of leap ascends to the room he guesses to be Jia's. "Come on... hurry," he shouts, as the metal groans, protesting years of disuse and now this sudden, agonizing weight as once again people are walking all over it.

The wall above Xin erupts in a shower of plaster and concrete - Zhenli looks out briefly from the dusty rubble, and then Jia climbs through the hole and jumps down into Xin's arms, Zhenli leaping down after her.

---

As the three Asians clamber off the bottom rung of the fire escape, Zhenli leads the way into a back alley, away from the approaching fire sirens - but not before Jia has taken a few moments to hug Xin tightly. "It's so good to see you again, brother," she says, sounding exhausted but happy.

"It's good to see you again," says Xin... "But... where? Why?" And then he's overcome, and hugs his sibling close, "We were-I was worried about you."

Jia chuckles, shaking her head. "Oh, Zhen and his crazy ideas. He wanted me to stop writing so you'd take all this _seriously_. I thought it was all kind of exciting, you and him having a gang rivalry and all." She cocks her head. "Are you really with the _tongs_?" she asks, her eyes twinkling.

"Well... it's kind of a long story," says Xin, "But no. I'm not with the _tongs_." He regards Zhenli, "Are you?"

Jia turns to Zhenli. "Now that wasn't very nice telling us all that, Zhen. Brother wouldn't lie to me about something like that. You have to tell Nana the truth now. I think it really got her angry." Zhenli begins to look... _embarrassed_... as Jia chides him. "Oh yeah, that reminds me," she suddenly adds, pulling the strip of white cloth out of her jeans pocket. "Technically, Zhenli did reach me first, so..." she says, winking at Xin and handing the banner to Zhenli. He holds the cloth in his hands, staring at it for a long moment. Eventually, he speaks.

"I thought this would make me happy..." says Zhenli, looking up again. "But thanks to this..." He glances at Xin. "...this _madness_ of mine, I almost lost you, Jia." He turns to Xin and holds out the cloth. "Your _kung fu_ is still stronger than mine, Lao Xin."

"That is not to say yours is weak. You have much to learn, Ran Zhenli, but you have a good start." Xin regards the man, "You have mastered some unusual techniques."

Zhenli nods. "As have you, Xin." He turns to Jia. "I'm afraid your Nana will be mad at _me_ when I tell her the truth. The _whole_ truth. I don't know if she'll let me see you anymore."

"And I somehow doubt that will matter much." Xin shakes his head, laughing a little, "Jia, we have a lot of catching up to do."

Jia smiles at Zhenli. "You leave Nana to me, Zhen." She nods to Xin. "Yes we do, brother." And with that, she takes both men by the hand and leads them down the alleyway.
