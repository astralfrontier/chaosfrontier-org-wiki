# Fall of Eden 2007-06-23

May 1, 2008. San Francisco.

The safe house is much the same as the others that Meyer and the West Coast All Stars prefer... little privacy, much clutter, and, of course, on the West Coast. This particular place is a formerly abandoned bus depot in the south Bay area.

The team is reassembling here after several months left to their own devises. So far, only Andrew Morgan and Newton Benford have arrived.

Benford doodles on a pile of old Greyhound schedules, musing on the nature of the exalted Spark.

Morgan looks over Benford's shoulder. "So I've spent the past month trying to figure out who I am," he says rubbing his chin. "And now you're working on the question of _what_ we are?"

Benford says, "Well... to be fair, 'who' has singular and plural meanings... and that's still quite muddled." The scientist holds up a diagram, a sketch drawn from memory of Junior's tour of the Spark. "'Who' are they?"

"Our avatars?" Morgan muses. "You've had two so far... and I've had three. First my anonymous source, and now... well, I guess it's easiest to call them Hunter S. Thompson and Edward Murrow. They aren't _those_ people, I suppose, but they're based on my knowledge and memories of two famous reporters. I met them on my trip."

Benford raises an eyebrow. "Indeed, icons of journalism... but the previous owners of these Sparks are also supposed to be present in some form. To be frank, it's... creepy. But it may prove useful. We know that one chap, Davron, became adept at making changes to the Sparks. He left these people for us; there may be other answers as well. Such as... what the bloody hell is going on."

"I think they said that Davron constructed the avatars to instruct us on our abilities," says Morgan. "But... we only need that sort of thing because we Exalted here, in a world that we thought was without magic. Why did we even Exalt here in the first place?" He looks off to his left, as if addressing someone around the corner wall. "Any comment, Hunter? Ed?"

"Why did _you_ Exalt? The potential for greatness," replies Murrow, standing near Morgan. "Why did _anyone_ Exalt? Well... Gaia was under assault. And she asked for help from the Solar Deliberative. And so... here you are."

"Under assault," says Morgan. "The Assembled? They're the only magical beings we've seen so far that aren't Exalts."

"That seems indicated. As you've found, they're in the service of the Primordial, Autochthon. The Great Maker. The author of the spark of Exaltation itself. One of the two Primordials - aside from Gaia - to stand with the gods in the defense of Creation."

Benford shakes his head. "The Great Maker may be behind the assault, but it's too simple to assume blind malice. I wonder what the great Deliberative would make of this situation. Hmm. I wonder... is Davron still alive? Or any of his associates?"

"I wouldn't say malice either," Morgan agrees. "Axel's goals seem pretty sinister to me, but Gerhardt is just here to study me, or something. But..." Morgan consults his notepad as if trying to remember something. "Oh! Junior said that Davron and his associates actually came to our world in person, some decades ago in our timeline. If Gaia needed Exalts to come in, why didn't they just come that way again?"

Murrow grins wryly at Morgan. "Sorry, but I need to preserve the confidentiality of my sources."

"Huh. So you're not going to tell us. Why not? ...Never mind," says Morgan, sighing. "Fine. What _can_ you tell us about their visit? I mean, you were allowed to tell us it happened, so surely you can tell us _something_ about what happened. Or why, perhaps. Were they chasing the Assembled too?"

The reporter-avatars shake their heads. "The Assembled are a new phenomenon," explains Murrow. "What they were chasing was something of more value, certainly to Davron specifically - knowledge. Specifically, knowledge about sorcery. They came to reawaken the memories of a mortal who had reincarnated from Creation, using Essence techniques. Along the way they encountered another mortal, the granddaughter of a woman whose memories were already awakened."

Benford says, "By 'awakened' you mean that she remembers a past life?"

"Correct."

Benford says, "Do either of you remember _being_ Davron? Or someone who knew him firsthand? Junior, this goes for you, too."

The avatars deny this, though they seem privately amused by the question.

Morgan raises his eyebrows. "So what happened to that woman, anyway?" He pauses for a moment. "Huh. If you guys are based on knowledge from Creation you wouldn't know. All right - who _was_ she, then? I assume she lived her life out in Gaia, so chasing that down is up to us."

A woman named Haley married, becoming Haley van Heusen. She had three children, one of which attended to her mother's belongings and articles after her death at the ripe old age of 80. Now Haley's granddaughter Windy van Heusen has inherited the odd collection of otherworldly writings and queer trappings of the occult. She is quite easy to find by a trivial search of the papers - London's publications have a distinguished history and are justifiably proud of it.

In this modern age, Windy is easy enough to find. She has an e-mail address and a mobile phone, and a slight reputation as a speaker on linguistic topics. She has shown an adeptness for language and is even published.

Opting for the direct approach (for once), Newton has announced his credentials as a scientist and fellow Briton, and arranged to examine her collection. Now Poe and Benford are approaching the old van Housen brownstone on Hyde Park.

The younger Doctor van Housen leads the two visitors to a cramped, cobbled basement, populated with dozens of shelves and hundreds of boxes.

Amongst the stacks and piles, Benford encounters extensive grammars and vocabularies for two languages that are unknown to Gaia; they are identified as "Riverspeak" and "Old Realm", which Murrow confirms as languages of Creation, and indeed the latter he describes as the language of the gods.

Near these are collections of diaries which appear to document accounts of everyday life in Creation. And most significantly, an account of the arrival of four Exalts - Davron, Chi-Yosh, Gallius, and Ramar - and their brief but eventful activites there. Included are handwriting samples of the four - Junior, Thompson, and Murrow, of course, still refuse to comment on whether the handwriting belongs to holders of Morgan's or Benford's Sparks.

Morgan scratches his head. "You know, Benford... remember when you told me about your expedition to the Lands of Light? Well, the more I learn about that place..." Morgan waves his hands vaguely. "You don't travel in _space_ when you're there, do you? You travel in information space. It's like navigating through the biggest Wikipedia ever."

"And if you're trying to look something up in Wikipedia," Morgan continues, "you need to have some idea what you're looking for. Some search terms. Which we have now." He gestures to the stacks. "If we're looking for information of what Davron's been up to, what he had to do with our Sparks being here... do you think maybe we can find it in the Lands of Light? Now that we have a better idea where to look."

Benford winces at the analogy with Wikipedia, but nods his head anyway. "So you're also implying that our Lands of Light, is the same Lands of Light as one would find from Eden. Well, it's worth a try. Shall we call Mister Klein and ask him to find us an access point?"

"The Assembled have access to the Lands of Light, and they don't come from Gaia _or_ Eden," Morgan points out. "So if their Lands of Light is the same of ours, it stands to reason it'll be the same as Eden. Let's give it a shot."

"One and one always add up to two, no matter where you are," Benford quips, and pulls out his secure phone. "I'll call Klein."

An hour and several overpriced cab fares later, Morgan and Benford stand in front of the British Telecom Tower. Originally the Post Office Tower, the building has been a landmark of modern communications since its construction in the 1960's. The slender steel tower is an incongruously modern part of the old London skyline, festooned with every type of antenna. "I might have guessed," Benford mutters. "I'm getting slow in my old age."

Morgan rubs his chin. "We need somewhere to put our bodies while we're in. Follow me and act casual." All the _serious_ parts of the tower are behind cardkey or even mechanical-key access doors, but it's easy for Morgan to talk his way into a minor administrative section of the building, and from there to a windowless conference room. Adjusting the "In Use" sign appropriately, he pulls up a chair behind the door. "Ready, Benford?" Morgan settles into his chair and closes his eyes. _Take me in, Eddie._

There is the familiar sense of dislocation, and Morgan and Benford find themselves in a roomful of telephones, old-style rotaries, modern PBX systems, all linked together, knotted in an impossibly complex tangle. Benford nods to himself sardonically. "Yup, we're at British Telecom HQ all right."

Morgan ignores this, and opens a desk drawer under the nearest telephone. "Blank book, blank book... here we go." He pulls out a nondescript bound volume and picks up a pen. "Let's see... Davron wrote about the Nation of the Sun, so..." Morgan begins to scribble, lightning fast, in the book, writing down a detailed description of the Nation's capital, and ending by drawing a sketch in the back of the book of the palace. As he focuses on it, the picture begins to move. "There we go," he says, reaching toward the picture.

The picture grows, or perhaps just draws its viewers' attention, and a moment later the two Solars are aware that they're now surrounded by the scene it depicts. The flat little square of a bustling hall in a government building is now all around them, hundreds of feet wide. Pages and persons both important and self-important move around bearing stacks of scrolls, books, and parchments, as well as globes of light, strange artifacts, and other exotic items. "Oh, my," Benford breathes. "And where are we now?"

Obligingly, a caption appears below the sketch in Poe's journal: 'Provincial Capitol Building, The Southlands.'

The text of Morgan's book has now taken on a life of its own. As it begins to author itself, the two Solars see that their environments are changing to match. Buildings become terraces or towers. The Sun and Moon begin to advance through the sky at a faster and faster pace, whole days going by in a few quickly-drawn breaths of surprise, the passage of time driven by their desire to find truth. Guttering torches are replaced by everburning globes of pure golden light. Staircases become magically propelled conveyances. Looking down, the Exalts can see the text itself is likewise transforming in character.

Gradually it has become less of a narrative and more of a dry description. And gradually the world around them becomes less and less distinct. The Solars find themselves in a black void, and the narrative work has arrived at a new form entirely. It is astronomical telemetry, a description of pure position that would spell out the location of a celestial body. Benford and Morgan find themselves following the book's description. They float in space, seeing a distant Earth and dimly radiant Moon, and behold.

And behind them is... well, since it's in the middle of outer space, the temptation is to think of it as a space station. But it's far more extravagant than any space station ever conceived in fiction, to say nothing of the mundane air-boxes built by NASA. Towering spires of gold glitter in the Sun's light, with impossibly spindly strands between them which nevertheless bear tram-cars beneath them, shuttling from one tower to the next. Verdant and crimson gardens stretch out at ground-level between the pillars, and the majestic, flowing lines of the city inevitably draw the observer's gaze toward the great tower in the center, with an unblinking giant eye embedded in the very top.

Benford realises his mouth has been hanging open, and closes it. He glances at the book; some of the descriptions are geometric. "This should be visible... if we point a telescope here, it would be visible..." He turns back to the 'space city', and the night sky beyond. "There... Pegasus... Orion... the North Star..." And the book obligingly produces a single line of astronomical notation: an ascention, declination, and distance. Benford's mouth falls open again. "It's trailing us... the Earth, I mean, and not much further than the distance to the Moon. Men have been that far before."

"Davron built this," Morgan says. "He must have. Or someone associated with him." He looks at the book. "This led us here, and Davron was the connection we followed." He gazes out across the city again. "It's magnificent. No wonder they call that world Eden."
