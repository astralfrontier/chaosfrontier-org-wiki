# Fall of Eden 2007-06-29

The days of the 'Open Road' were a nostalgiac time before the Interstates homegenized American driving in continuous bands of asphalt. In those legendary times, the roads passed through cities, instead of around or through them, and drivers actually had to slow down for towns and stop at traffic lights. These days, there's only where you were, and where you are going; the world in between passes by in a 60 mile an hour blur.

This is one of the reasons that Andrew Morgan, also known as Poe, finds himself on the old US-160 highway between Durango and Colorado Springs. He's looking to get in touch with the people he serves. You can't do that when you're driving 1500 miles a day. Besides, the Assembled have shown a disturbing affinity for high-bandwidth channels fo all types; the back way is also the safe way.

Sometimes, out of the corner of his eye, Poe will catch a glimps of Edward and Hunter in the passenger seat or the rear-view mirror. His 'assocaites' have been mostly silent since entering Colorado, but make their presence known on occasion; keeping Poe from falling asleep at the wheel.

An hour or so before sunset, the fuel guage in Poe's third-hand Impala is creeping towards empty. The town of Monte Vista is about 15 miles behind, and a dusty green sign dimpled by buckshot indicates that the town of Alamosa is another fifteen miles ahead. Hunter leans forward from the back seat, taps Poe on the shoulder. "You wanna stop there, unless you wanna walk all night in coyote-infested fields."

"Wish Jet were here, then," Poe remarks. "Then I'd soon have a coyote on my side." Chuckling softly, he glances at the mile markers to double-check his progress.

Hunter chuckles also. "Ah, yes. She's good with that kinda thing." Then he's gone, and soon US 160 becomes Main Street, Alamosa, Colorado. The endless green-brown fields of potato farms are replaced with two- and three-story buildings, homes, strip malls, and parking lots. With only eight thousand people and the entire San Luis Valley, there's no need to build tall. The old Impala rattles to a halt in the parking lot of the first gas station Poe sees, which seems to serve triple-duty as the diner and dispatch for a towing service.

A hand-lettered cardboard sign hanging from the gas pump announces 'Please Pre-Pay'. The pump has a digital display, but it's dark, and there's no credit card slot. The lights in the diner are on, however, and there's a few people inside.

"Credit cards are too traceable anyway," says Morgan to himself as he pulls into one of the parking spots and heads in. "Besides, I could use a bite to eat."

The sun is just touching the mountains to the west as Poe steps into the old diner. It appears to have been assembled from two old railway cars, many years ago; indeed, a brass plaque bearing the Pullman Company logo is affixed above the front door. The plaque is bright and well-polished, in defiance of the dust covering the parking lot. The door bangs shut behind Poe as he steps inside. The center of the first car is populated with a long counter and a row of stools; small booths line the wall under the windows. The only other patron is a man in a flannel shirt and a '24 hr Towing' ball cap. He spares Poe a glance, then returns to his coffee and newspaper.

A black woman, obviously a waitress, bustles out from the kitchen as Poe takes his seat. She's a few years older than he is, with her hair pulled back in a tight bun and an odd assortment of rings. In almost the same motion she picks a menu out of a box on the counter and deposits it in front of Poe. Her accent comes from someplace south and east; "Whatcha be havin', strangah?"

"Cheeseburger and fries, please," says Morgan politely, with a friendly smile, "and a diet coke."

The woman scribbles the order on a notepad as she walks away, dropping it through a window as she passes by the kitchen. She pauses by a fountain to fill a glass. "Anythin in 'bout an eclipse for tonight, Henry?" She appears to be talking to the man in the far booth, who looks up.

"An eclipse?" he asks. He flips to the back page, with a colorful weather map. "Nothing about an eclipse, Janey. Where'd you hear that?"

Janey shrugs. "Just... aroun', somewhere." The woman's laserlike focus wavers as a momentary frown crosses her face; then it's gone again, and she bustles back towards Poe with a diet coke and a glass of ice water.

Morgan quirks an eyebrow. He's learned to distrust coincidence since his Exaltation, and this woman seemingly has picked up on _something_, possibly without knowing what. As she sets down the drinks, he speaks up. "Sorry, I couldn't help overhearing, ma'am. What's this about an eclipse?"

Janey stops and smiles. Some of her accent fades as she speaks "Fren' of mine, he said we may see one tonight." Then, a frown again. "He usually good 'bout dose things. Maybe I heard wrong." She sounds disappointed.

A bell rings in the kitchen, and Janey goes to get Poe's order.

Meanwhile, the Sun disappears behind the distant mountains to the west, casting broad, lazy beams of gold light over the San Luis valley. The light floods in through the diner windows, washing over Poe for long moments before fading. There's no odd phenomena, but it still feels like an old friend was checking in.

As Janey comes back with the burger and fries, Morgan smiles. "Well, you know, your friend may well be onto something. Don't worry about the newspaper - you can't believe everything you read in the papers anyway. I should know, I work for one." He winks.

Janey laughs. "I was right, you're from way outta town. Little paper here only comes once a week, I think Henry's only one readin' it." That elicits a good-natured groan from the man in the far booth. "Lots of reporters came to town, after Katrina. They don't come here." She looks out through the windows towards the sunset. "Stars'll come soon. Maybe then."

A walkie-talkie squawks somewhere in the room. Henry pulls the radio from his pocket and responds to it curtly. "Got a call, Janey, sorry. You okay walking home?"

"Sure, _Henri_," she replies. "Good night for walking anyway, for sure."

Morgan sighs softly as he swallows a bite of his burger. "There's a hundred little stories in every town in this country. But we big city papers never seem to want to bother. It doesn't sell papers, you see. And the paper business is all about selling papers." He rolls his eyes.

Janey says, "'Zat why you came here? You want a story?" Janey seems a little disappointed. "That's fine, I s'pose. But the people'r still here, even after the newsies and the cameras go home."

Morgan shakes his head. "I think it's time for me to go beyond stories. I'm still not sure what I _am_ looking for, but I'm hoping I'll know it when I find it." He tilts his head. "Like this friend of yours, who spoke of an eclipse..."

"You want to meet Legba?" Janey seems amused. "Ya, he'd like you. But... he's my, hmm... 'imaginary friend'. Sometimes I hear him when I read the cards. Not as easy as a handshake, dawlin."

Morgan blinks for a moment... then nods. "All right, now it makes sense," he says, as if he'd just solved a mystery - and briefly reflects on how, a mere few months ago, he'd have thought the woman was a crank. "Yes, I'd quite like to meet Legba."

Janey is silent for a long moment. "You're serious." Another long pause. "Alright. Big city folk usually figure us for chumps... or con artists. But OK. It's a good night for the thing." She waves into the parking lot. "Go gas up. I be ready when you come back."

Morgan goes out and works the old pump. The diner's cook, a nondescript white man of maybe twenty, comes out into the parking lot and wanders off, lighting up a cigarette. Inside, the lights go out and are replaced by candlelight. When Morgan comes back, Janey is seated in one of the booths, bracketed by a pair of white votive candles. She's still wearing her server's uniform, but her expression is much more serious. On the table in front of her is a small rectangular silk bundle. She motions at the other seat, inviting Poe to sit.

Morgan takes his seat, as indicated. He'd spent his time, while pumping gas, thinking about what he will say to this Legba, whatever manner of being he may be. It certainly knows something of him, that is certain; Morgan decides that he might as well be up-front with him. Or her, or it.

Janey carefully unwraps the silk bundle, revealing an elaborate tarot deck. "All my family is catlick," she says. "My one grandma would say that the cards are a sin. I went to De La Salle for high school. I read about lots of Saints, and I have my favorites. But these cards..." she taps the deck. "They're from my _other_ grandma. She left them to me when she died. She said, they're safe. They're safe, because nobody believes in these things anymore. She said, nobody believes in things until they need to." She taps the deck again. "Used to be, they never work. But the winds came in 2005 and shook it all up. Shook up lots of people's heads, too; and now I think, they always worked just fine... but I never had eyes to see." She taps the deck a third time. "Cut it," she says.

Morgan reaches out to the deck of cards without looking at it, lifting half the stack off the deck. "I know exactly what you mean, Janey. To tell you the truth, something like that happened to me. That's why I'm on the road, really."

Janey nods, and shuffles the deck. "Lots of ways to read the cards. It always works better when you know yourself." She draws five cards, and places one in front of each candle, and a crossed pair in front of herself, all face down. "Grandma always did it this way, so that's what I do. Past, present, and future." She flips the first one. "Your past. The Tower, inverted. Many unpleasant surprises."

Janey points at the crossed pair in the center. "Legba, Loa of the Crossroads. The present is always the Crossroads, because that is where decisions are made. So two cards for the present." She flips the first, vertical card. "The Sun. New life, new opportunity." And yet, Janey frowns as she reaches for the other, horizontal card. She flips it over and inhales sharply. "The Moon. Assisstance. Help from your friends." She places it across the Sun, her hand trembling. "Together, the Eclipse."

Janey leans back. "You flip the last one."

Morgan nods slowly, closing his eyes for a brief moment to meditate, as Lao Xin had taught him. And although he's not yet sure _what_, he can definitely feel it in the air around him. It _isn't_ a coincidence that the Present has yielded the symbol of his Exaltation. He cannot see more than the vaguest outlines of the pattern, but he can see that the pattern is there. And part of that pattern is... He reaches out, flips the card. The Heirophant.

Janey stares at the card for a long moment. "I drew exactly these cards, in this pattern, just this morning. You saw me shuffle. It can't be the same. The odds are... millions." Her voice is shaky; fearful. "Who the hell are you? Really?"

He had not done so before, for fear of frightening the woman. Now, he realizes the truth may reassure her. "I am what the cards have named me. I'm Andrew Morgan, and I am Chosen of the Unconquered Sun. And this is my sign." He taps the Sun and Moon cards on the table, and then his forehead, where the circle-within-a-circle bathes the booth in its warm golden light, outshining the candles. "Your friend Legba spoke truly, when he said you would see an Eclipse today."

Janey seems mollified, but only just. "I... I... holy shit. I believed... but I didn't _believe_." She stares at the man, and at the cards, and back at the man. "I want you to see... would you come see the people I live with? I think that's what I'm supposed to show you."

The glowing symbol fades as the Essence-hungry world of Gaia drains the magic away. "I would be honored, Janey."

The front door clatters open and shut. The figure in the doorway is a medium-height, medium-build man wearing jeans, a grey sweatshirt, and sunglasses. He glances at Janey and Poe as he slips onto a stool at the counter, but doesn't show any sign of surprise. He picks up a menu and opens it, impassively reading it in the dark.

Janey cleans up her tarot cards. "I better take care of this. I don't want Henry to give me crap for leaving customers in the dark."
