The English, particularly Londoners, have a flea market tradition that is famous the world over. You can find most anything you want, sold from an endless sea of truck beds and open boots, or 'trunks' as the Yankees say. Benford is no stranger to the quote- secondary-market-unquote. While his upbringing as a military brat put him in half a dozen British territories before age ten, he took a lot of time from his adolesence to appreciate the ways of his countrymen.

Even so, he's shocked by the contents of a single surplus dealer in Silicon Valley. The shelves are filled with gear that would have been mistaken for alien artifacts just twenty years ago... pieces of supercomputers, gas chromatographs, gene sequences, things even Benford doesn't recognize. This is probably the only place in the world where you can buy electron microscopes on a cash and carry basis. He takes Timothy with him on a few foraging expeditions, reasoning that it's as good as a trip to any science museum.

"California," Benford muses, "is a soft spot in the fabric of reality." He can't help but admire the sheer cheek of the his mother's people. They are arrogant, gluttonous, and coarse, to be sure; but the Americans have a habit of doing the impossible. That, Benford reflects, makes them unique among the peoples of the world, much like the Exalted. So too, they - WE - have a unique responsibility.

Benford teaches this lesson to Timothy alongside the science tour. "Like Spiderman?" the lad asks.

Benford smiles. "Something like that," the scientist replies. "But it's never as simple as it is in comic books and movies." Timothy nods; he's heard that one often enough since coming under Jet's care.

Benford builds his makeshift fusion lab in the back room of an old TV repair shop. The place is another wonderland of retrotechnology. In the disposable era, people rarely bother to fix anything, so the place is full of old televisions, radios, and 1980s video game systems. The solitary item of 21st century technology on the premises is a security camera over the door. The shop had been barely holding on, and the owner is eagerly accepted Meyer's buyout offer. The few remaining customers don't recognize him, because who would expect to see CERN's wonderkid fixing antique car stereos? Benford chuckles when he imagines the headline: 'Offshoring Forces Nobel Prize Winner To Find Day Job at Radio Shack'.

Benford doesn't bring Timothy here often; he's seen too many piles of technological clutter morph into android assassins lately, and he doesn't want to explain to Jet how he got her adopted son killed while teaching the kid how to repair an old Nintendo. Nearly all of his work with the boy genius is done on the ubiquitous whiteboards in the All Star's San Francisco commune, then copied by hand into Benford's growing pile of lab notebooks.

In principle, the goal is a simple extension of Benford's previous fusion work. Start with a small packet of very hot gas. Modulate the surface of the packet with a carefully crafted waveform so that heat which would otherwise escape remains trapped inside. The net effect is a near-perfect one-way insulator: you can pump energy into the system until it's hot enough to fuse the light nuclei in the gas and release high-energy particles.

There's problems, of course. Some elements, such as deuterium and tritium, are relatively easy to fuse, but release most of the energy as dangerous neutrons that can only be harnessed with difficulty. Benford already did that on the night of his Exaltation, and could probably turn it into a working industrial process, but with the exotic materials and toxic side-effects, it's not much better than an old-fashioned fission plant.

No, that won't do. To revolutionize industry, Benford needs something non-toxic that can be constructed out of scrap. The new fuel is boron-11, and realeases energy as a stream of helium nucleii. The fuel is as common as laundry detergent, and the particle stream can be directly converted into electricity with a big, brute coil of copper magnet wire. The kind of scrap like one finds in a Silicon Valley junk yard.

Of course, it's hard to get scrap metal to produce temperatures of a billion degrees centigrade, ten times hotter than the core of the sun. In fact, it's damn near impossible. Fortunately, Benford, like the Americans, refuses to do honor to that fact. He fills a dozen notebooks with equations for confinement waveforms, and builds a hundred circuits out of scrap analog chips to implement them.

The new power plant covers a plywood sheet, four feet wide and half as long. The machine is a gleaming Escher knot of copper coils, brass fittings, and quartz tubes. The business end is a pair of large aluminum posts, to which Benford has attached a huge tangle of neon sign tubing. A thick bundle of cables joins the hundreds of sensors to a data logger hacked together out of several old paper-spool polygraph machines. The whole thing is covered by a lead shutter to absorb the comparatively small amount of radiation that escapes the mechanism.

And so the experiment goes. For many long winter nights, the lights burn brightly at the TV shop in Sunnyvale, but nobody seems to notice that the electric meter is at a dead standstill.

Finally, one day, right around noon, the prototype is complete. Benford crouches over a workbench, grinning at the results. Fusion, it turns out, isn't so hard to implement. The electro-intertial confinement principle was first formulated fifty years ago by Philo Farnsworth, inventor of the television. None of the parts in the fusor rig are beyond the 1960's level of technology, and ultimately the control circuit is a deceptively simple array of a few thousand analog components. Pricey by the standards of the era, perhaps; but no more pricey than the control unit in a coal power plant.

The only part that was ever beyond reach was the mathematics to predict the result and tune the mechanism. It's the kind of mathematics that require either a modern computer, or a couple of determined geniuses. Given another twenty years, Timothy would have likely worked it out on his own, and Benford once again wonders what would have happened if Exaltation hadn't come to Earth.

Oh well, he thinks, as he seals the lead shutter. That's there and then. This is here and now. Time to press play.

Once again, the whirr of vaccum pumps fills the room. The polygraph arms scraping over the log as the control circuits lock onto the power plant's waveforms. Then the neon rat's nest glows brightly, and several of the meters peg at their highest level. The room gets warmer, and Benford flips a giant knife switch to dump the surplus power back into the county electrical grid. All over town, lights glow a little brighter and fans spin a little faster. The controllers at the county power plant note a slight, transient drop in demand, and the coal generators, weighing hundreds of tons, fractionally reduce their output to compensate for the free energy.

All that energy, coming out of Benford's machine, a machine weighing scarcely more than a large refrigerator. The scientist couldn't be happier. "And thus may we be saved," he says. He knows that integrating the new technology into the world's industries must be done carefully, and won't happen overnight. Still, he's sure that, having made it work once, a factory could build a hundred such machines in a month, and each one will pay for itself in a week. He's equally sure that Meyer will have the nasty economic parts covered.

Benford shuts down his equipment, padlocks all the doors, and hangs the 'Out Of Business' sign in the window. As he trots back out to his old pickup, he notices the bright green and yellow sign of the gas station across the street, the same sign he saw the morning after his Exaltation. He remembers what he said: Someday I'll beat you.

He points at the sign, bright in the noonday sun. "Gotcha," he declares, and begins the long drive up El Camino Real to bring the news to his allies.
