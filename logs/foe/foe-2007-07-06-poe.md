# Fall of Eden 2007-07-06-poe

There are three occupants of the old diner in Alamosa, Colorado: Janey, waitress and oracle; Andrew Morgan, journalist and Exalt; and a third man who has yet to introduce himself. He is dressed simply in motorcycle boots, jeans, and a grey flannel shirt, and sunglasses, although the sun has gone down and the lights in the diner are out. He appears to be reading the menu and doesn't react as Janey gets up and hustles back to the kitchen. "We're closin' soon, strangah. I can only do carry-out."

The grey man turns the menu over several times, appearing to look for something. "OK. I'll have one of those. A carry-out."

Janey comes out from the kitchen, taking a long look at the gray man. "Carry-out is a _how_, mistah. I need a _what_."

The gray man doesn't react. He puts the menu down, speaking carefully. "I'll have... um... whatever your other customer is having. As carry-out." And then a cheery, "Thank you!"

Morgan doesn't even need to ask Eddie about this one. For Janey's sake, though, he wears a friendly smile as he addresses the newcomer. "Hello there, sir," he says, taking a stool a few seats down. "Never ordered in a diner before, have you?"

The gray man spins on his stool to face Morgan. His expression is blank for a moment and then breaks into an incongruous grin. "I guess not. I usually stay pretty close to home. What do you suggest?"

Janey disappears back into the kitchen. With the short-order cook gone, the only other sound is the quiet whirr of the microwave oven.

Morgan's voice is still conversational, but quiet enough not to be heard from the kitchen. "Well, to be honest, sir, I don't know _what_ I'd recommend. I guess it depends on what you came here for." He turns in his stool, leaning against the bar. "So, did you hear about the eclipse tonight?"

The expression is gone from the gray man's voice again. He looks up and down the counter, fixates on the discarded newspaper. He stands up and retrieves it casually. "Not exactly. The odds of seeing an eclipse tonight weren't that good. I guess it's a pleasant surprise."

Morgan's tone is businesslike now, but still calm. "Fair enough. Though depending on who you ask, some might say the odds were in favor." He tilts his head. "So what _does_ bring you here? I do find it hard to believe it's a coincidence that someone of _my_ sort and someone of _your_ sort find themselves in the same diner on the same night."

Janey stands in the doorway to the kitchen, just within sight of Poe, but just out of sight of the unnamed visitor. She's wiping her hands on a bar towel, a concerned expression on her face, but she doesn't interrupt.

The visitor sits down again and opens the newspaper. "Probably the same thing that brings you here. There's some people I want to speak to. Have you heard anything new from any point within one hundred and ten kilometers of Tijuana lately?"

"I have, as a matter of fact," Morgan says noncommittally. "I think the big news there was a major drug bust, but I think there were a few other things happening there as well. May not have made the papers." He regards the gray man critically. "And who would you speak to in Colorado that might have had something to do with Tijuana? Apart from myself, of course."

The visitor is silent for a moment. "As it happens, nobody in Colorado, or anywhere else." He removes his sunglasses clumsily, folds them, and puts them away. His eyes look perfectly normal, but expressionless, and his blinks last a little too long. "Madame, the microwave oven has stopped. I think my order is ready. Are you from New Orleans?"

Janey seems surpised. "I might... yes," she says, thinking better of trying to be deceptive. She returns from the kitchen a moment later with a styrafoam box, and sets it in front of the visitor. "It's on the house. Now, we're closing. Please leave."

"_Merci, madame._" The visitor turns back to Morgan. "I'm going to tell you something as an indicator of good faith, and then propose an exchange of value. You can agree to it, or not. It's a common interaction that I'd like to try. I find cooperation with people... enjoyable."

Janey comes around the counter to stand behind Morgan, putting her hand on his shoulder. Half her demeanor says says she's looking for a shield; the other half says she's trying to be one.

Morgan allows his own demeanor to thaw a bit... as much to serve as an example as anything else.

"Sounds like a hobby I'd quite like to encourage," Morgan says with a slight smile. "What do you have to say?"

The visitor holds up a hand and ticks off points on his fingers. "First, you can call me Brad. Second, I believe that you are Andrew Morgan, and you've met some of my associates in Walla Walla and Tijunana. Third, the woman is from New Orleans, and is probably a member of a group of unsettled refugees that have decided to colocate with a group of migrant workers in this area. Fourth, the migrants include a number of Mexican nationals who originate in Tijuana. Fifth..." Here the visitor runs out of fingers and is silent for a moment while he considers what to do. Finally he just puts his hand down. "Fifth, we've lost some ground in Tijuana. I suppose that's thanks to you and your friends. Frankly we don't understand what happened. So I'm here to gather perspectives on the phenomenon. I have no specific instructions concerning you or your friends, but I think it would be interesting to obtain your perspective on the matter as well."

As Brad speaks, Morgan's expression becomes increasingly unsettled, though his emotions are confused enough not to settle on any one. Finally, he speaks. "Well, I'll certainly be willing to listen to any questions you have, and I'll answer them if I can. If nothing else, I sympathize with your confusion." His eyes narrow slightly, and he hopes Brad's symbiont will clue him in as to the significance of his facial expression. "I _will_ insist that you treat Janey and _her_ friends with respect and care."

Brad nods. "Of course. My objective is strictly to evaluate this demographic, relative to Tijuana and the Unity population. In return, I would ask only that you don't prejudice the subjects. I know that you can't help but passively influence them; just refrain from active interference. My data will be more valid if we approach as equals."

Janey's fingers dig into Poe's shoulder. It doesn't seem like she's conscious of it; it's a wariness of Brad. Wariness, tinged with fear.

It doesn't seem like an unreasonable request to Morgan, certainly compared to the sort of thing the Assembled have been known to do. "All right," he says. "Just be careful, all right? I think you may need a little more practice talking to people."

Brad is silent for a moment, then his face suddenly assumes a pensive look. "Yes. I'm sorry. That would explain why the woma - why your friend has been looking at me so oddly." Brad looks at Janey. "I apologize. I thought that if you were one of his friends, that you'd be used to it."

Janey just nods slowly. She murmurs to Poe, "If you're an angel, what does that make him?"

Morgan smiles ruefully at Janey. "When I find out, I'll let you know."
