# Fall of Eden 2007-07-07-benfordunity

Benford slumps to the bottom of the manhole. His vision is getting fuzzy, and he can't feel his feet. There's a buzzing in his head, and it's getting louder... a buzzing that sounds like the voices of a crowd...

He's not in the manhole anymore. He's a voice in a crowd in an enormous amphitheater, bigger than the Houses of Parliament, the American Congress, and the UN Assembly combined. The men and women around him are other scientists. There are papers in front of him; treaties for controlling pollution, sharing resources, and curing disease. The proposals are debated; the plans are revised; but the new treaties are always better for everyone. The dark side of politics is absent.

Then Benford is in a laboratory, with a handful of other scientists. A plague has broken out, and they mean to cure it. Holographic projectors cover the walls with images of complex molecules, each a sample from a different corner of the world. Normally, sequencing a virus like this could take days, but ordinary citizens have linked their home computers into an enormous supercompting grid, so decoding the pathogen is child's play. The vaccine will be ready in a week.

Benford's vision shifts. Now he's standing in front of another hall, full of students from all over the world. Some are children of priveledge, but many more are from developing nations or impoverished families. The poor still outnumber the wealthy, but that's not as much of a barrier to education now. He's presenting the results of the experiment; and the students are learning. After a few moments he yields the lectern to another member of his committee. The rotation occurs several times. When the lecture is over, the audience applauds, not just for Benford, but for all the professors, and also for the students in the room; another job well done.

Next he's out in a street, it looks like Fifth Avenue in New York City. The traffic is gone, and the population has queued up in front of a line of ambulances. At the back of each ambulance, a lab-coated scientist waits with a 'Bones McCoy' style pneumatic injector. Benford is one of them. There's a brief discussion, then each citizen sits down for the innoculation. It's done in a moment, and then on to the next person. The police are nowhere in sight; they aren't necessary. Everyone knows that this is the best way to cure the disease. The vaccine has been perfected so there are no side-affects. There's only the scientists, the people, and the crystal-clear, pollution-free skies of New York City on a cool spring afternoon.
