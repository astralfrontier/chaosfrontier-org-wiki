Janey locks up the diner, and the three get into Poe's car, heading west. Brad takes the passenger seat, and Janey sits in the rear, glaring at the back of Brad's head. The waitress directs Poe to a side road two miles back the way he came, and then a mile south. The road is unpaved but shows signs of frequent traffic; the passage of Poe's borrowed beater doesn't kick up much dust.

The road ends at a trailer park, of sorts. Some of the vehicles are trailers, some are vans, and more than a few people are sleeping in tents. There are a few permanent buildings, apparently dormitories or barracks of some kind, but even these look pre-fab and temporary, and possibly already past their intended lifespan.

Now that the sun has gone down, the inhabitants of the camp are lighting lanterns and starting generators. The scent is a mixture of home cooking with the tang of running engines, with the unfortunate hint of a leaking septic tank somewhere in the background, though thankfully not too strong.

Janey gets out of the car and explains to Poe, ignoring Brad. "These are the people I live with. Som'r from Mexico. Som'r us _gringos_." Her bayou accent mauls the prononciation of the spanish slang. "I drove the parish bus out here, after Katrina and Rita, after the money ran out and there weren't jobs to find." She sighs. "Only a few of those left here, truth be told. A lot of them went home, but a few just... couldn't do the math. I wouldn't leave 'em. So here I am."

"You're supporting them all?" says Morgan, looking around and getting a feel for the place, uncomfortable as it might be to someone of his own prosperous upbringing. He wonders what Brad is making of all this. "I... don't know what to say," he says honestly, allowing himself to look lost.

Janey is silent for a moment, then laughs, a high chrip that's almost birdlike. "Oh, no, dawlin. These people don't take charity. They're all hard workin' folks." She sweeps her hand in a broad arc, taking in the whole valley. "Those potatoes don't pick themselves. We watcha call _migrant farmers_." Then a bitter murmur, "If you're bein' polite. Some people say wetbacks, even though a lot of us are Citizens of the You Ess Eh, but it's just plain rude anyway."

"It's unlikely that she could support one hundred and thirty six people with minimum wage and tips, Mister Morgan," Brad mentions conversationally. The Assembled's head pans from left to right like a camera on a turret. "But she does seem like the type of person who would do so if she could."

Janey glares at Brad. "Just what planet did you say you were from?"

"Lot of people in my tax bracket seem to think they _do_ pick themselves," Morgan remarks sourly, referring to the potatoes. "At least, that's how they act." He glances at Brad, raising an almost amused eyebrow, curious as to how he'll field that one.

Brad continues to survey the camp. Some of the people have noticed Janey's new friends, especially children, who have stopped tearing around long enough to point and stare. "I'm from Earth, miss. Every last gram of me." Brad stops and turns to face Poe and Janey. "Per our agreement, I'd like to speak to some of these people. They've noticed our presence."

Morgan's lips curl in a half smile. "All the _matter_ is, I'm sure," he murmurs under his breath. Out loud, he says, "I advise you take some care, Brad. Janey's not going to be the last person to ask you what planet you're from, I would guess."

Brad removes his sunglasses and stuffs them in the pocket of his sweatshirt. "I'm willing to assimilate whatever advice either of you might have on the subject," he states flatly.

"To tell you the truth, Brad," says Morgan, sighing, "my _advice_ is that you not go off alone. If you go off by your own and start a ruckus... well, first of all I'd have to go and clean up after you, and second of all, it'd close off your chance of learning anything more. You can decide for yourself, of course, but from what I've seen of you so far, I don't think you have enough knowledge to make an informed decision on that point."

Brad is silent for a long moment, and then does a passable shrug. He points into the camp. "After you, then."

As Morgan tours the camp, he takes care to remind himself of what Janey said: that these people don't want charity. So what they are looking for, if anything, is not a helping hand, much less a handout. If he was called to help these people with his own hands, it is elsewhere that they must be applied: to deal with whatever forces are keeping them down.

So what he asks about - though not directly, in many cases - has to do with what is holding them back. In some cases, of course, it is the simple fact that their "undocumented" status means that they can't push for a better deal from their employers. In others, it's lack of education, lack of access to services Morgan takes for granted like banking. In still others, it's that they think they're actually doing okay. But all of them want what Morgan has always thought of as the American dream: a better life for their kids.

Brad takes all this in, keeping silent for the most part, watching Poe's method. He asks questions of his own once in a while, usually about seemingly mild subjects. 'Do you like the way the sunset looks here?' 'What do your children do for fun?' 'What did you learn in school yesterday?' While his body language is a little rough, he's managing a passably conversational voice.

Morgan spares some of his attention for the Assembled. Is this how they learn? He remembers Rod Philips, the FBI agent, who could pass for human in almost any crowd; Brad is clearly not so polished, but maybe even Assembled need training.

Once, Brad casually asks a boy, a typically sullen adolescent of about fourteen, "Hey, know where to score weed?" The boy's face twists into a mask of disgust. "Who the fuck are you, Fox Mulder?" He kicks dust at the Assembled and stalks off, trying hard not to look like he really wants to run.

Brad stops, watching the boy's retreat. "Was that a... faux pas?"

Janey grunts. "OK, seriously, Mister Eclipse, who the hell is this guy?"

Morgan pauses and turns to Brad. "Yes," he says flatly. "Yes it was." To Janey: "All right, I suppose I'd better explain a bit. Unless Brad's going to try and stop me..."

Brad... smiles. "I'm not here to stop you, Mister Morgan." He plops down into a discarded folding chair, hands still stuffed in his pockets. "I think I might learn to be amused."

Morgan rubs his chin. "Well, Janey... earlier, Brad said every gram of him is from Earth. I don't doubt it one bit. But you and I both know, Janey, there's more to a person than their body. His mind, his soul is from somewhere else. And me and others like me are trying to figure out where, and why they're here." He nods in Brad's direction. "And although Brad isn't here to stop me, some of his colleagues are." He's not sure whether it's right to involve Janey in his troubles, but... well, Morgan's here, and Brad's here. And some of Janey's friends in the camp have _already_ been caught between him and the Assembled. So people like Janey will keep getting involved whether they like it or not. Whether _he_ likes it or not.

Janey looks troubled. "Well... the cards did say... so... does that mean that you're the Fox Mulder?"

Morgan raises an eyebrow at Janey. "I suppose that's not too far off. I'm not with the government - not yet, anyway," he adds, wondering why he did, "but it's part of my job to figure out what to do about Brad's people."

"Ah! Yes," Brad chirps. "And so what will you do?"

Morgan raises an eyebrow at Brad. "Sir, there are some things I don't mind you learning about, and there are some things I do. Can you guess which one that is?"

Brad considers it for a moment, and then stands. "Fair enough. So then I ask what, if anything, you intend to do about these people here?"

Janey looks puzzled. "Wait. Brad, if I follow this, why would you care about us, or Morgan, at all?"

Brad finally takes his hands out of his pockets. He strokes his nose for a moment, then raises his hand and wiggles his fingers. "That question has no single answer. I suppose that I am here to learn what makes you tick. What others do with that information is not my direct concern. However..." The Assembled stoops down and picks up a stick, begins scratching numbers in the dirt.

After a moment, Brad asks, "Do either of you know how expensive it is to be poor?"

Morgan thinks about that for a moment. "I do not. I've heard that before, but I don't know the answer."

"I do," Janey says. "I was working on an associate's degree in economics before Katrina. The poor can't get plastic, so they have to pay extra for money orders. The rich pay less for car loans because they have better credit scores. If you're living paycheck to paycheck you can't afford a good school or shoes that last."

Brad stands up, drops the stick back in the dirt. It falls precisely between the columns of numbers. One sum is significantly larger than the other. "Precisely. Everyone here is stuck in an underclass. That doesn't make much sense to me. And yet, compared to life in prison, another underclass... a lot of people choose to be here. The ones from Mexico come here at great personal risk. So I ask you honestly: why is that? And what do you intend to do about it?"

There's a half-dozen or so people from the camp who are discretely just within earshot. Everyone is trying to look like they're not really listening, offering an illusion of privacy that's hard to come by in a trailer park, but suddenly the loudest sound within a hundred feet is the hum of a few floodlights. Janey just shakes her head, waves some of them off. _Go away, go away!_

"I think you've answered part of the question yourself, Brad," says Morgan. "Where will poor people get the opportunity not to be poor so that they can save money?"

"Some of them are doing so here," Brad replies. "Which I had not expected."

"I... hadn't figured that," Janey states. "Some of those from the old parish, that didn't go back after Katrina... they're not the freeloaders. They're the ones working."

"I should visit this Katrina," Brad says. "Is there a phone booth nearby?"

Morgan holds out a hand, palm toward Brad. "Wait. Are you planning to go there _now_?"

"Perhaps," Brad replies, with all the deceptive genius of a nine year old.

Janey chuckles. "I can get someone to give you a lift to the Greyhound terminal if it will help you move along to anywhere else, stranger."

"I'll give him a lift myself, if he wants it." He turns to Brad. "And either way, I suggest you find an _isolated_ phone booth. Do you follow me?"

Brad is expressionless. "Do you promise me safe passage?"

"I do," agrees Morgan. "You personally have not threatened me or anyone here, and so I offer you no threat in return."

"I am given to understand that your word is worth at least that much." Brad stuffs his hands back into his pockets. "Janey, please have Henry tell the owner of that vehicle that I'm sorry about his engine." He removes his shades and puts them on. "Ready when you are, Mister Morgan."

Janey shrugs. "Come back some time." It's unclear whether she's addressing Morgan or Brad.

Morgan nods to Janey. "I'll do my best," he says. After all, does Janey really want Brad to come back? Somehow, he doubts it. "You've all given me a lot to think about. Even Brad," he says. "Come along, mister. I believe you have a phone call to make..."
