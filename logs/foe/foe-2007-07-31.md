Barry's records were scattered to the winds when Rod Phillips and the FBI came. Now he has little more than a corkboard, some pushpins, and a dizzying array of 3x5 cards to keep track of his world. The computer files were backed up, but he hasn't had time to restore them. He's engaged Benford on some of this work, and now the two men spend an hour doing a mixture of data entry and restoration.

'Organlegging - Long Haul Infoshop, Berkeley, CA - www.thelonghaul.org - zine author notes fresh corpses discovered los angeles area vital organs removed surgical skill noted,' reads one of the cards. Barry passes it over to Benford. "This ties to some of the nodes I haven't fed into the computer yet, so let's hang onto it," he says.

Benford inspects the card, raising an eyebrow. "If this is true, it's one of the more evil things I've heard of in the past year, and that's really saying something." He turns the card over, looking for more notes. "I've never heard of this 'Long Haul'. Is he credible?"

"The Long Haul? It's a haven for activists and anarchists," says Barry. "Judge the credibility for yourself. But it _feels_ right. It has truth to it. I've been meaning to follow up."

Benford nods. "Horrifying, if true." He picks up a stack of index cards. _Wikipedia, Charles Babbage style._ "Then let's see what else you have here, if it's not all in the computer yet."

Barry flips his cards through his fingers in the manner of a Vegas card sharp and expertly deals them out. "Related to this, I assume you mean."

The cards are handwritten. They cover a gamut of topics and levels of detail, from single-word cards reading "IMMIGRATION" to a short paragraph on increased levels of gang violence in the Los Angeles area.

Benford says, "Places, events... but no people. No specific people, anyway. I guess we can start with whoever found the bodies, and whoever disposed of them. It looks like this is going to take a field trip."

Barry smiles blandly. "Be safe."

Benford grins, deliberately looking pained. "Aren't we always?"

Shattuck Avenue is unassuming, suburban, and white. Street traffic, commuter buses, and blissfully uncaring jaywalkers compete for the thin ribbon of concrete. The wide sidewalks play host to bike racks, leafy trees, garbage (and recycling) bins, and other accommodations to the Berkeley vibe.

BART is a convenient, anonymous way to reach the shop, and the group avail themselves of it. It takes little time to acclimate to the grainy notes of the sitar music, nor to the peculiar mix of odors that waft through the air.

"Ahh... just like being in college again," Morgan remarks to himself, breathing deeply. Though he's often wont to sarcastic commentary, for once he sounds sincere.

A cabal of college students are the only other occupants of the little establishment, and they pay the trio of Celestials no mind. Any proprietor the shop might possess is notably absent.

"Mmm, college," muses Jet. She looks to Morgan, "Just cause I never attended didn't mean I didn't have a lot of fun there." The Lunar surveys the place with an amused smirk, "I am very curious to see what manner of truth we might find in this part of the world."

Benford simply grunts. "I remember being a student. I also remember that one of the attractions of CERN was that they wouldn't make me teach."

Morgan does smirk this time. "Can't say I blame you. Man, the pranks we'd play on the profs..." He shakes his head. "Let's have a look around." He meanders inside, looking around the haphazardly scattered shelves.

The books, magazines, pamphlets, and other paraphernelia present exhibit little in common save a demand for the suspension of disbelief, or a willingness to push "free thought" to its logical conclusion. UFO conspiracies, self-study guides for farming (the text does not indicate just what plants the author has in mind), screeds on drugs and the drug culture, and millennial superstition can be found here.

Despite this, other fields are adequately represented as well. Wilderness survival, contemporary issues such as gender identity and social equity, discussions of chemistry and the physical sciences, and even postcards containing positive phrases and messages from the Bible have been given shelf space.

Morgan picks up a zine at random, scanning for the author's name, then idly perusing the contents. As expected, it's completely off the wall, but his recent life experience dissuades him from dismissing it quite as casually as he once might. "The only question which divides us is whether it is crazy enough," he murmurs under his breath, certain that Benford at least will catch the reference.

Jet has no trouble looking, even if she's not always got an eye for what the others do. She has little interest in the contents of the shelves, but she does carefully study every person in the book store. Her breathing changes slightly when she notices she's being watched in turn, emphasizing curves and teasing the eyes of those watching. The Lunar doesn't have an explicit goal, she just wants every eye to be following her. "I wonder if there's anything in here that might make amusing reading for the club," she muses lazily.

Benford shuffles through some of the other zines dealing with paranormal sightings, looking for references to the cabal's own activities. "Indeed," he murmurs. "Look, here's the latest edition. Maybe we should see if anyone knows the author."

Jet looks over at what Benford has picked up and grins. "Might as well ask, right?" She absently toys with her hair with her left hand and speaks out loud, "Is there a clerk or someone who can help over here?" Sure, it's not exactly an invitation into her panties, but if the usual rule holds, the tightness of her skirt should generate nigh instantaneous service.

The kids look up. Their expressions are already glazed; Jet has a bit of trouble telling if it's due to her, or something else. "Umm. Uh.. Lexy's supposed to be back pretty soon. Umm.. can I help you with anything?"

Jet's used to that kind of look. It's either chemicals she's generating or chemicals they took. She smiles warmly and walks closer, "We were trying to find someone, actually. You know, you can't just take what people write, you gotta look into it, right?" She points to the zine and says, "It would be awesome if you could help us."

"Yeah, uh.. That's Lexy's mag. She uh.. she calls it _samizdat_." The kid is starting to think, mustering his intelligence to impress. "It's Russian. It's like an underground newsletter. You can reprint it."

Morgan finds himself chuckling softly. Jet always did have a flair for attention-getting. And right now, her own... how shall we say it... casual approach is probably for the best. He doesn't want to scare anyone off. "That's cool," he says. "We'll just hang out for a bit."

"Mmm, Lexy, huh? You said she'd be back pretty soon?" asks Jet. She hops up to sit on a counter near the kid and grins, "Her writing really got me worked-up, you know? It's interesting, almost unbelievable, but the truth is like that, don't you think?" She is playing with him, like a cat with a mouse.

"I, uh, I've been publishing myself too. Um, a newsletter. Agriculture and agribusiness." The kid is warming up, and his confidence seems to be maintaining itself. "Online. Um, I can give you the address if you'd like..?"

Benford takes a small pile of the zines and sits down near the front door, both looking for leads and keeping an eye on the street outside.

"Really? You know, we're working on a project. Well, not really working yet, it's kind of a concept out there right now. We'll need all kinds of view points and ideas. Real free thinkers." Jet looks to Morgan and then back to the kid, "So what's that address? It might be just the kinda thing we're looking for."

The kid immediately makes a play, fumbling about in his pockets and looking down in apparent concentration. His eyes stay locked on Jet's chest, of course, but he finally locates the business cards he'd been holding onto for the last twenty seconds. He extends one, smiling shyly. "I'd be happy to help at any time, miss," he manages.

Morgan nods to Jet encouragingly. It's not related directly to what he's working on, but what he does know about agribusiness lets him know that Big Agri is going to be an interest group he'll have to deal with, sooner or later. This lad may be of the right caliber to be part of that, even if right now he's mostly just hypnotized by Jet's... well, by Jet.

Jet reaches out to take the card, making a point of touching the kid's hand. "That's so cool of you! This could really make a huge difference!" She leans forward a bit too, giving him a positively blinding view of her cleavage. "Oh, I'm Charity, by the way," she says suddenly, offering a hand.

The kid's compatriots are exchanging envious glances, but say nothing. The young man gratefully accepts the hand, looking briefly unsure of whether to kiss it or shake it. He escapes an embarrassing faux pas thanks to the sound of the door opening, and manages a quick shake before pulling back. "Lexi," he says upon seeing the new arrival. "Um, this is Charity. She wanted to know about your zine." The men are, of course, forgotten.

The arrival is no less an eccentric figure than the shop. Black hair curls down to a feminine waist, and although she dresses in the style of the town, an eyepatch over her left eye adds a whimsical touch of romanticism. The woman herself is compact and not unattractive, aided mostly by the lively expression on her face.

"Good! I'm glad someone's listening out there!" she announces, apparently to the world at large. She strides into the Long Haul, brushing the student aside and shaking Charity's hand with vigor. "Lexington Dallas." Her speech has the accent of a Russian immigrant, but her diction is excellent.

Morgan figures it's time he introduced himself. "Scuse me, I'm just a friend of Charity's here. My name's Poe Morgan," he says, offering his own hand. "Pleased to meet you."

"You!" Lexi hears the name and turns, staring at Morgan. "You!" She advances on him with a predatory air. "You've come about my story! From Seattle! _Finally_!"

Morgan meets Lexi's gaze levelly and returns her attention with a smile, refusing to be unnerved by her fervor and determination. "Just doing my job, ma'am," he says. "And following my nose."

Jet grins, looking to Benford and winking. She knows she's got his head spinning trying to figure her out. For now, she's going to be quiet and look Lexi over. Just cause the girl isn't trying to get into Jet's panties doesn't mean the Lunar isn't going to enjoy the view herself.

"Now I'll be honest with you, Ms. Dallas," he says. Morgan's always been a formal sort of guy, and formality means that he doesn't start with the first names till he's ready. "I need to have all my ducks in a row before I try _this_ one on my editor. He's a nice guy, but, well, you know how it is when you get to the corporate media. Just because the Times is family owned doesn't mean they don't feel the heat." He shakes his head, lowering his voice a bit. "People don't _want_ to believe in organlegging," he continues. "You have to make them."

Lexi looks shocked. Then an unaccountable expression of disappointment clouds her face. "You're not here about the Tijuana story?" she asks finally. "Well, that's okay. I won't complain!" The sour mood passed as quickly as an April storm. "What can I tell you about it?"

Morgan takes his turn to be surprised. "Wait, back up. You did a story on Tijuana?" he asks, genuinely interested. "Could I have a look?"

"Nooo, nononono." Lexi makes a slashing motion with her hands; out of the question. "You're here for the organ theft story. I don't want to trouble you with our petty problems here." Even an amateur could taste the sour grapes, but Lexi pours it on. "Now come on. What do you want to know?"

Benford frowns, and flips through the latest issue. There's no mention of Tijuana, but he doesn't say anything yet.

Jet chimes in softly, "We're interested in a lot of things, and from your expression, honey, I am guessing you have something on your mind." She crosses her legs slowly, not with any aim, but probably just because she can't help but draw attention to herself.

"No! Organ theft. Absolutely." Lexi moves behind the shop counter and begins throwing papers behind her, digging through a stack of documents and clippings. "Did you guys see that case last year? Dr. Hootan .... uh.. Rooz.. rokh?" Lexi has found the papers she's looking for. "He was accused of prescribing drugs to kill his patients and harvest their organs."

Morgan nods. "Yeah, I did," he acknowledges. "I've got to admit at the time I didn't think much of it. Just an odd little case."

"He disappeared a few months later. And now down in umm, hmm, Monterey Park, they've been finding people who were vivisected. Nasty business." Lexi stands upright and extends a newspaper clipping to Morgan. "I did some digging of my own."

Morgan takes up the newspaper clipping and scans it quickly with a practiced eye. "Does seem rather odd, doesn't it. You'd think an ordinary doctor would have a hard time just disappearing like that, especially when he's under investigation."

Jet smiles and lids her eyes lazily, just listening to Lexi's voice. Not that her eyes are closed completely, there's enough for her to see what's going on. She comments quietly, "Anyone can be vanished. Especially someone who has a very impressive income, no morals, and powerful friends. If it's organ theft, it's to the highest bidder, right?"

"Supposedly he was killed by a prisoner while in holding, someone who didn't like a doctor killing their patients." Lexi frowns. "But I poked around. There's paperwork you have to fill out. The cops didn't do that. They just .... forgot they had him!" She throws up her hands. "Any time I ask where he is, I get the runaround. And that's the other thing!" She points a finger suddenly at Jet.

"If the organs were going for sale, where are they? I've staked out every hospital I could. Nobody is hurting for transplants, at least around here. So who's using them all?"

Morgan purses his lips. "Now that's... unsettling," he says. "They could be going elsewhere, but then why do it here? You have to transport them, and they don't keep that well. Someone's going to a lot of trouble for no obvious reason." He shakes his head. "And they've got at least a few hooks in local government..."

"So? What are we waiting for?" Lexi grins. "Let's get going!"

Morgan's head jerks up. "Please," he says. "I've been out of the country. If there's something more recent, I need to follow up on it before it goes stale."

"W-wait!" The college boy who spoke to Jet speaks up. "Lexi, umm, I should come too." He glances at Jet somewhat unsubtly. "Y-you remember, the coroner works with my dad, right?"

Lexi catches the obvious falsehood as readily as Morgan does, but has caught much else as well. "Sure, come on," she grins. "You slackers are in charge!" she adds, pointing at the other boys.

---

The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (as the coroner's office is officially known) is located downtown, as a wing of the San Francisco Hall of Justice. Lexi's notion is to simply pay off whoever's on duty, but Morgan has a different approach in mind. "The right tool for the right job," he says as they pull into the parking lot, stroking the surface of a card in his wallet which, to the right people, will match the insignia of the Department of Internal Affairs. "Besides, someone _else_ might be padding his retirement fund."

The actual morgue is in the basement, where it's easier to keep things cool, which not incidentally matches the demeanor of the guard on duty outside the official wing, someone who's seen entirely too many grieving families to be easily moved. "Edgar Smith, Internal Affairs," Morgan says authoritatively, showing his magical ID. "Just doing a follow-up on some unsolved cases. Someone across the quad got a bug up their ass on this one." He presents the air of someone who thinks they really didn't need to get involved in this, but that it's more than his job's worth to question the boss.

Apparently it's more than the guard's job is worth as well, since he waves them on past. As with the airport in New York, Morgan finds that when you're somewhere only official people are supposed to be, people assume you're official, and will give you directions. In this case, to the morgue vault itself, as well as access to the ledger that matches up names with drawers.

The ME is an older gentleman with a balding head, glasses, and a serious expression. He's the very soul of genteel professionalism by the look of him, and he greets the trio as they enter the vault. "I'm Dr. Kurtz," he announces, extending a hand.

"Edgar Smith," Morgan responds. Pick an alias and stick to it. "My colleagues and I are following up on the missing-organ cases. May we have a look?"

"Of course." Kurtz's eyes rest on Lexi for a moment, as he studies her face - especially her eyepatch. His eyebrows quirk a bit but he says nothing further, turning and leading the way through his domain. "Twelve patients, characterized by removal of the vital organs by vivisection. Cause of death, universally blunt trauma to the base of the skull. All healthy."

The doctor moves to a selection of vaults and begins opening them, after taking notes - presumably vault numbers - on a small notepad he carries in his pocket. "Officers' files aren't here, you'll find them at the Desk. All I have are the patients."

Benford finds a dispenser of disposable gloves and puts on a pair. "If they were killed by blunt trauma, then technically removal of the organs isn't what killed them, but I think I take your meaning. Tell me, is there any reason to believe the same blunt instrument was used each time?"

Kurtz grunts. "Hematoma. Some sort of narrow, very dense instrument. A crowbar, maybe. It's difficult to say, since we weren't able to extract anything like a sample."

Morgan's voice is brisk and professional. "You weren't able to lift any traces from the victims, then? No flecks of paint or metal?" He takes a few notes in his own notepad. "Any signs that the site of the killing blow might have been cleaned?" His delivery is part no-nonsense just-the-facts, and just enough of an interrogating tempo that might serve to fluster a nervous witness.

Kurtz shakes his head. "All patients were found in concealed areas. Preliminary conclusion is ambush, administration of the blow, then concealment." He fields a few other such questions, but the gist of it amounts to what the Solars expected: murder.

Benford keeps up a running patter of medical questions, maintaining his role as an expert third party, even though he can see everything just fine himself. While a coroner will extract the orgrans for tests, the missing parts necessarily constrained the scope of the examination. Still, Benford might see things the official report missed.

In all cases, Benford can find the unmistakeable evidence of surgical removal of the organs. Though he is a Solar, he does not have the training and detachment of a medical doctor; his stomach protests, but only mildly. He retains more than enough objectivity to discern the signs of a scalpel's touch on the skin, the hints of chemical preservatives and other signs of the removal. This work was done by a skilled, if mortal, surgeon. Nor is there any commonality to what was taken, other than "all that was healthy". Perhaps the contents of a large ice chest, one that could be carried two-handed by a man of average strength.

Morgan's insight into the living is, if anything, even more accurate than Benford's understanding of the dead. Dr. Kurtz, whatever else he may be, is a professional doctor. What has happened here violates every ethical fiber of a physician's body, and only Kurtz' admirable professionalism keeps his own disgust of the case in check.

A few minutes of feeling that he's onto something, and a bit of mental effort, conjure up a horrible sudden memory for Benford - shocking not only in the bare fact of the thing, but in that he remembers such an obscure detail from only a few minutes' worth of glancing through a textbook.

It was "Hole's Human Anatomy and Physiology, Ninth Edition", and based on the ordering of the victims' time of death and the organs taken, Benford realizes that whoever vivisected these people proceeded linearly through the textbook in choosing what to remove.

Benford keeps this fact to himself for now. "It's a vile thing, but whether we like it or not, the medical facts are beyond question." He glances over at Poe. "We need to consider motive. We should go."

Morgan raises an eyebrow, but nods at Benford. Something about the way Benford says it tells Poe that his Twilight ally has found something, something he doesn't want to discuss with Dr. Kurtz. "Well, thank you for your time, Dr. Kurtz. Pleasure to work with you."

The ME smiles thinly. "Any time, gentlemen."

As soon as the trio is outside, Benford blurts out his observation. "This is a serious problem. There's a standard anatomy textbook, I read it on one of those interminable drives through Nevada. The murders, the organ removals, all happened in the same order, like the population was bloody homework... we know of only one kind of madness to be that methodical. Miss Dallas, if you were out to find something serious and unpleasant, you should be very happy just now."

Lexi's face is ashen. Clearly the morgue has disrupted her usual poise. Nevertheless she rallies. "There hasn't been a murder in a month. At least none that were reported. But..."

Benford says, "There will be more. I don't know how that doctor fits into this, but his death or absence won't stop it."

Morgan's own countenance likewise reflects his own unease - all the more so since unlike Lexi, he knows what it is that he fears. "No wonder the motive was so obscure," he murmurs, glancing at his fellow journalist - as he has come to see her. _Is she ready to find out how deep the rabbit hole goes?_ he wonders.

The trio get to the car, where Jet is being plied with unsteady attention. ".. It's Majorowicz. Ryan Majorowicz," the college student is saying, apparently introducing himself and pronouncing his name as 'Murovish'.

Morgan takes the wheel for the drive back to Berkeley, more close-mouthed than usual. He does say, to Jet, "We still don't know where or how, but Benford did find that this conspiracy goes deeper than we first guessed."

"They usually do," murmurs Jet. She has, thus far, managed to avoid excessive advances with the agile ease a stripper develops over time. She finds it far easier to manage when she's sitting naked in someone's lap.

Benford recaps the discovery in Hole's Anatomy. "He's working his way through the book, and leaving the remains in Monterey. So... there will likely be more murders, and more bodies found there. It doesn't mean that the extractions were done there, but it's a likely place to start."

"What are the odds we'll show up just in time for them to drop off another one?" Morgan mutters, shaking his head. "We've got to come up with a better plan than that. Unless you can come up with another miracle at one of the known places," he says glancing with a brief smile at Benford.

"You have found the way things come to pass," says Jet. "What remains, however, is a hunt." The way she says the word is distinct. "If you can do some kind of data crunch on the victims or the placement of their bodies, perhaps you can narrow my search down?"

Benford finds a roadmap and begins cross-referencing locations with the police reports. "Probably not anything as simple as a pentagram, no, and we'd be too late in any case. But the bodies were identified, and people have habits, so maybe there's a pattern to the initial abductions."

"You said this was procedural. If the theft is done that way, perhaps the targets are chosen using a simple logic as well," suggests Jet.

Benford says, "That information might be in the police reports... which I'm sure Miss Dallas has read... so if you'd be so kind as to tell us what you found?"

"I couldn't afford the police report.." Lexi frowns. "Look, I only get paid twice a month. But I did ask around. All the victims were from different social classes, different areas, and so on. There was only one thing that any of them shared, that I _know_ of.." She frowns further, apparently turning over in her mind the prospects of this revelation. "Police found um, child.. child pictures on three of their computers. And another two were involved in some kind of shady business. Drugs, something like that. They weren't exactly nice people, even though it's awful what happened to them."

"Interesting way to deal with undesirables," murmurs Jet. "So our suspect somehow knew this, which I suspect means they used the internet or other data channels to commit their crimes, or at least left data in such places." She smiles at Lexi, "And no sweat, you've done a great job with this one. For limited resources you've really cracked into one hell of a story."

Morgan taps his chin, still trying to work out this puzzle. "People who could be blackmailed, perhaps. Or who regularly went places where no one they knew, knew where they were."

Benford puts the roadmap away. "It also means that witnesses will be inconveniently reticent. Why do we never get to see the nice part of town anymore?"
