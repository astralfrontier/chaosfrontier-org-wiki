# Fall of Eden 2007-09-07

The search for the Blood of Dragons has co-opted Xin from finding a way in to the Lands of Light. The first step is a call out to Schroeder, asking him to get in touch. "It's important." A message to his former rival goes out next, and the circumstances surrounding the significant meetings with those individuals occupy his thoughts for now.

The three meet in an out of the way booth in an IHOP, not far from Xin. Traffic is just beginning to pick up outside and the lights and sounds of passing cars mark the passage of time. Certainly, something must, as the food seems to be taking forever to prepare. "I've called you here because I wanted to talk to you about your destinies," says Xin, leaning on the still damp table. "You two have within you the Blood of the Dragons... though I'm not sure what that means... but you must experience strange things. I want to know more about that, more about who and what you are. We need to find the others. Others like you."

The pair glance at each other uncertainly. They're listening, but each man is cautious for his own reasons.

Xin tells the others, albeit a little cautiously, some of his own experiences, his dealings with the Supernatural, to help reassure them. It was, after all, hard to believe at first. He speaks with each, trying to glean from them what, if anything, they may have in common, and how he can use this commonality to try and find others.

Ran, of course, has built his life around success. He is enflamed with a drive to do and be recognized. He is quick, but undependable. Schroeder is his opposite: a methodical investigator, a keeper of the common peace and a servant of slow, implacable order. What the men have in common is only this: they balance each other so very well.

While Xin speaks with these two, he silently asks Alice, _Can you tell me if you see anything unusual about these two?_ He then presses on, once he's got a feel for both of them, and tries to discern what each needs from him, what he might teach them.

"Um, they seem like very nice gentlemen," is Alice's reply. "I hope you will introduce me formally someday."

"I suppose, well..." Xin pauses thoughtfully here, trying to think of a way to phrase this. "I suppose I can try and help you to channel your chi, to help you be more focused when trying to use your uh, your gifts." He half-chuckles, "It sounds crazy, I know, but it can help. I'm supposed to teach you something."

"What do you mean, 'supposed to'?" asks Schroeder, sounding curious.

"Well tonight, voices were calling out to me--telling me to find my students, to find the Blood of the Dragons," Xin replies. "I believe that's you."

Ran laughs bitterly. "I'm not the student you're looking for, Lao Xin," he answers in a tense voice. "What do you think you can do for me?"

Xin almost slaps his hand down on the table. The silverware in front of Xin jumps obediently, and his glass tips back and forth, drops of water flying everywhere. "Your kung-fu is strong, but it isn't as strong as it could be." He gestures at the fallen flatware. All around it are droplets of water, now flattening, flowing into a perfect circle around the pile. "I will teach you how to do more than you can dream of, how to fight the coming foes. You wish to have the world recognize your greatness, and you," he says, indicating Schroeder, "You would impose order. If you wish to do these things, you'll have to stand with us against these... things." He casts a wary glance around, "You'll need to learn what we're facing as well."

"What would this involve?" asks Schroeder. His body language is that of the cat; curious, but wary.

"You'll learn kung-fu. Not just punching and kicking, but... well, you'll see. As far as learning about what we're facing, that will involve some talking and study, and some firsthand exposure. It will be dangerous, but you have to be ready to face these things. They seem drawn to... beings of power." Xin sits back, "I will teach you these things, and more."

"We will begin presently," says Xin, confidence flooding his voice, his body language. Here is a man who is sure of himself, who is sure of others. "You have much to learn..."

---

The hunt is on. Morgan in the lead - an unnerving, unnaturally animated creation of the Assembled hot on his heels, and who knows what else besides. Poe knows he is the interloper here - this is their home turf, they know the territory, they know how things work. On the other hand, this is a world of ideas, and ideas and their manipulation are how Poe has made his living for most of his adult life.

He began his flight by establishing, with great force of will, the idea that he was instead fleeing for his own home - one of the few other major interface points to the Lands of Light that he knows about. So for now, while he knows they are still on his tail, he means to reinforce that deception. He calls to mind the Seattle Times - a major regional newspaper, and his employer of five years. Such an institution must surely have its own impact upon the Lands of Light - and perhaps it might provide some 'cover' that he might be able to use to confuse his trail and backtrack back to the Infr- to where his body actually is.

He is in luck. A digital representation of the offices of the Times looms up in his vision, its corridors strangely twisted - for they are not the physical office building, but its web servers and story archives - but all too familiar to Morgan. He finally loses his pursuers somewhere in the Health section - but he has lost too much time already. Not sparing much time to check whether he is being pursued once more, he recalls the pounding bass lines of the Infrared once more and comes to consciousness to find a dead biker on the floor beside him.

Jet is still trying to figure out just what has happened when she notices Morgan starting to wake up. A moment of wariness and she says rather abruptly, "This wasn't my fault." A brief pause, "You're okay, right? Things got a bit weird out here."

Morgan blinks at the biker. "He sure had a lot of brains for an Assembled, doesn't he?" he says, glancing at the wall where said brains presently reside. "Aren't they usually made of machine parts? Or... what _is_ going on here?"

"It's a long story," begins Jet. "This guy walked in, wearing the face of someone I kinda took out a few years back, and so I just took him out again." The Lunar lets that linger for a moment and decides, "Okay, so it's not really that long a story. But.. he left something behind. He left my blood sisters." For lack of a better word.

Morgan looks around. "Where? I don't see..." he begins. "Oh, you mean in spirit or something?" He goes over to inspect the biker himself, finds, as Jet did, the mechanical skeleton beneath. "Ugh. Yeah, that's the work of the Assembled all right..."

"Like the others, yes. I can talk to them, and it seems to really be them," explains Jet. "Anyway, whoever sent that thing knew a lot more about me than most people remember. That puts me at a pretty strong disadvantage."

Morgan blinks, as he finally understands. "They made your blood sisters into _symbiotes_?" he says, wide-eyed. "Damn..." He glances at the corpse again. "Yeah... this is serious. But... whatever it is, they don't want you dead, at least, or they'd have sent some serious force." His brows furrow, his expression. "No, they have a _use_ for you."

"Gee, I'm flattered," Jet deadpans. "So now that we've established that cheery bit of news, maybe we can get the hell out of here? That thing may be broken, but it's creeping me the fuck out."

As if in response, the bound and brainless body spasms briefly in its restraints.

Morgan glares at the gaping wounds which the annoyed Jet had torn in the body's abdomen. "There ought to be some kind of stomach or liver there," he says after a moment. "That thing can't live on its own. It's gotta have some kind of life support somewhere. Yes, we're gonna get out of here, but... Jet, do you think you'd be willing to follow that thing's trail back to where it came from?"

"You really like putting your hand in the hornet's nest, don't you?" Jet frowns thoughtfully and looks over the body. "I think I probably could, but it could be fairly time consuming. Who knows, maybe it was formed out of junk somewhere like a few of the others we've dealt with."

Morgan shakes his head. "You don't make muscles and skin out of random junk. That's why our machine friends are _running_ an organ theft ring in the first place."

"So they want to make.. these things?" asks Jet. "Seems like a waste of time, and this one doesn't have much of anything inside. What good are these, and what would be better about them if they had a few extra parts inside?"

"Those sound like questions for Benford. If we get a chance, we should get him here to try and answer them," says Morgan. "But how many more people do we want the Assembled killing while they try to figure out how to make them useful?"

"We don't want them killing anyone," Jet answers. "At least not without prior approval. But uh, how far do you want to chase this? We could get in the middle of something a lot hotter than one lone robozombie or whatever the hell this thing is."

"CHARR--ITY." The voice is a deep mechanical rasp. It comes from the body, which suddenly jerks about in its restraints - quite futilely, however. "CHARRRRRRR-RRR--.."

"We're going to have to sooner or later," says Morgan. "You may be right, though. Want to page Benford and Xin, get some backup first?" He glares at the machine. "Okay, first we get out of this _room_."

Jet is quite happy to get out of the room, but only after she's stopp to plant a few well-placed stomps into the body of the broken thing. "Damn thing wasn't talking before. Who knows how much it'll be able to remember." Only when she's out of the room will she speak about her preferences. "I think back-up is a pretty good call here. We are probably gonna run into a lot of the enemy, and they may not be very kind."

Out in the hall, the pair can see several doors. One of them leads to the club outside, and both Exalts notice the moment it opens. Coming through the door is a masculine figure dressed in leathers, incongruously wearing a Halloween mask to cover whatever features he might have. He reaches into his jacket.

"Fun time is over," says Jet quickly. A Halloween mask? Honestly. She does the first, possibly stupid thing that comes to mind and hurls herself at the enemy, charging into combat and hoping this is the same kind of piece of trash she's already torn up once today.

Jet moves fast to close the distance, but the enemy is quicker, grazing her with its first shot. The Lunar barely has time to let out a deep growl before she attacks, using the momentum of her dodge to swing a closed fist at the chest of the faceless enemy.

The Lunar flows smoothly through the full swing, striking, then lifting her enemy and throwing him away from the exit door and into the opposite wall, smashing him through the material as if it were rice paper. "Let's GO!" she roars out at Morgan, not even waiting before she starts leading the way out through the club.

Jet doesn't have time to gather information like she wanted to. There is no time to inquire where Snake's copy came from. She thrusts people out of the way impatiently. Even while she's rather rudely displacing a large man from her path she's focusing her mind on that strange smell that was pouring off of Snake. It's not her nose that does the work, however. When the Lunar opens her mouth a forked tongue briefly flicks out, and her eyes, for just a moment, look just like the pitiless eyes of a rattlesnake.

What's left of Snake could only be described as the 'living dead', and the peculiar and hateful odor of it reeks in Jet's nostrils. The thoroughness sends a brief shiver down her spine: he was even wearing Snake's Wal-Mart cologne and had the scent of beef jerky. And on the street, the scent still calls to her, singing a beckoning song of vengeance and revulsion.

The trail leads only three blocks away. The loading dock of a three-story office building is where it ends. Jet finds the back door unlocked, and no security cameras to watch her progress. With Morgan right behind her, she listens - and hears the sounds of activity inside.

Morgan glares at the loading dock. "_Now_ would be a good time to have some backup," he whispers.

"Well, make it happen," replies Jet quietly. "I don't have an army in my pockets." The Lunar looks back over her shoulder and frowns. "We don't exactly have a great lead here."

"Let's get out of the open, at any rate," Morgan says. "Find a nearby building." Pulling out one of the magic phones, Morgan texts Benford and Xin the address, with the addendum "'Ware Assembled".

Benford runs, rides, and hustles his way to the address, detouring only long enough to pick up a box of arms at an All Stars safe house. When he arrives, he's bearing a cello case. "A violin would have been too small," he quips, handing out large-caliber handguns and plenty of spare magazines. "How did you find this place?"

When Xin arrives Schroeder and Ran accompany him. "So be careful," Xin is saying as the trio join the others. "Hello everyone, you know Agent Schroeder, this is Ran. They're my students. What's going on in here?" As he's armed courtesy of Dr. Benford he adds, "I'm glad you brought enough for everyone."

"We followed a zombie out of Jet's past," Morgan remarks. "It's complicated, but it means this war just got a lot more personal." He raises an eyebrow at the new arrivals. "Do we need to start from the top, Xin, or have they been briefed?"

"There are people who want to kill us, kill them first," says Jet. "Right now, the rest is pretty much window dressing. The debrief will have to wait."

"Listen, you can't just shoot your way into a place." Schroeder is speaking, having instinctively reached for his badge. He holds onto it now, less as a demonstration and more as a talisman of authority to reassure himself. "We have laws..." He is stopped by Ran, who holds up a hand and shakes his head slowly. "We're past all that now."

Benford says, "Not entirely, sir. But we're the only people on Earth who can do anything about this situation. For my part, I choose to take responsibility for both this situation and the consequences." He pulls back the slide on his Glock and releases it with a thunk that's as clear as a gavel falling. "Now let's do this before something worse happens."

"Besides, we're here to investigate, not to arrest," adds Morgan. "This isn't the nerve center of the operation. It's just the best lead we have."

"Well, seeing as we might as well have a neon sign above our heads, let's get going." Jet figures this can't get all that much worse, time-wise. As a matter of habit, she will force her way in first. Seeing as the door isn't even locked, there's not much forcing anyway. She doesn't have a weapon drawn, but she is reaching out with all her senses, trying to seek out any traps before they can close on the exalts.

Morgan taps the security console by the door. "Turned off. What in Heaven's name... first Jet's new symbiote, now this. It's like we're being _invited_ in."

"Yeah... that's what makes me nervous." Xin has a pistol in either hand, like something out of a John Woo film. "Be ready," he cautions, "I can't help but have a bad feeling about this."

The team - Jet, Morgan, Benford, Xin, Schroeder and Ran - make their way as quietly as possible into the three-story complex. Each has the gift of subtlety to one degree or another; although they might be anticipated, they are not visibly expected.

The trail from the loading dock leads down a narrow hallway that turns left into a cavernous processing area. It's clear that some interior renovation took place, and not on the watch of the city of San Francisco. Freezers line one wall; four sunken depressions, looking like bathtubs with an unsettling variety of spigots and attachments, are nestled in one corner. Other medical equipment is scattered around the room as well. Although some of it resembles that from Morgan's vision in the Lands of Light, there is less variety, more focus.

The activity that Jet and the others heard before is focused on a single figure in a white lab-coat. He is facing away from the group, evidently engrossed in some sort of experiment on a table at the center of the room. His hands are sheathed in black rubber gloves, and there is a tuneless hum emanating from the shock of black hair adorning his head.

Morgan nods to Benford, and quietly takes a few steps around the door, letting Jet and Xin fan out behind him. Their job - and Ran and Schroeder's, for that matter, is to intercept the man if he attempts to flee or struggle, which seems entirely likely, unless he's such an ivory-tower egghead that he doesn't care who he talks to as long as he can keep doing whatever it is that he does. But just in case he _is_...

The figure hears Morgan. His brief jump of fright and the motion as he wheels about is all too human, but that's where the resemblance ends. Where his face should be is nothing but a thick, intertwined cage of jointed steel 'fingers', enclosing a hollow space. Within the hollow is a brightly-glowing sphere that gives off an array of scintillating colors, and it is from this that the humming emitted. Morgan can see down to his neck, and shudders slightly as he sees the steel rods interpenetrating with human flesh.

"Who are you?!" the figure demands, fearful and imperious.

Morgan takes a step backward, drawing his gun without even thinking about it. Then conscious thought kicks in and he lowers the gun again, aiming it away from the figure but keeping it at the ready. "I am Andrew Morgan, Solar Exalted of the Eclipse Caste. Who are you, and what are you doing here?"

Benford motions at Jet, pointing back through the door. "Watch our ass," he murmurs.

The creature halts for a moment, apparently briefly stunned at the idea that six armed people might want to speak peacefully. He regains his voice, making the sound of clearing a throat that he visibly does not have. "Well, ah, I'm Dr. Ho Chen. You... Exalted, did you say? Oh, then you--" He points a gloved finger at Jet.

"Yeah, me," growls Jet. "You better have some very good answers, Quack, or this diplomatic conversation is gonna end really fucking quick."

"Listen, it wasn't my fault.." The doctor reaches up. His 'face' - the dozen or more jointed steel bars - unwrap as though a fist was exposing its palm. He grasps the glowing sphere held in his head and tugs it out, holding it forward for all to see. "Look what they make you give.."

Morgan motions to Benford. "I think this is your department, Doctor. Have a look at him. We'll cover you."

Benford pockets his handgun only with reluctance. "My name is Benford. We need to know what's going on here. We gather that it's related to the vivisection victims. What we don't know is why." _Although I can almost guess, based on what I'm seeing._

"For this!" Dr. Chen waves his sphere around for emphasis, then places it back into the empty cage of his head. The metal fingers close protectively around it, socketing it back in place. "To make _this_ work! Do you know how they build themselves out of machines? Hmm? _Do you?_"

Morgan shakes his head mutely.

"Well they're like that with flesh. It's alien to them. It's not _right_." The doctor shrugs. "So of course they study it."

Benford says, "We've seen them do it. I have a theory that they have a kind of vital essence attuned to machines. But this is different..." He stops short. "You said they made you give... what? That globe - is that ... you?"

"Yes, it's me." Dr. Chen's voice grows colder, more melancholy. "My soul. If I believed in such things."

Schroeder's face is ashen. He bears the look of a man reconsidering a lifetime of abstinence from drugs, drink, and other escapes.

Benford glances at Schroeder, to make sure that the agent of an allegedly rational, humanist government is getting all of this. Satisfied that the fed is paying attention, he continues with Doctor Chen. "I'm sorry. Look, I want to help you. They're studying flesh, okay, but... why this? Did they tell you why they selected you?"

Dr. Chen begins speaking in what Morgan and the others think of as 'Chinese' - but Xin and Ran hear his prayer for mercy, the request of his soul to be consigned only to a lesser hell. He resumes in English after a moment. "I participated in organ theft in China. They found me there. Brought me here, along with another man. And there was a third..." Morgan suspects that Chen refers to the doctor who fell through the fingers of the police.

"They made me one of the test subjects. They told me I was to become 'an angel in their Heavenly Host'. One of the first. I.. I became this. I was put in charge of this place." Dr. Chen gestures with his gloved hands. "I was responsible for the work on the Snakes.." And the use of the plural is not lost on Jet.

Xin mutters something in return, amazement and horror in his voice. The shock of the man baring his soul, literally and otherwise, has his words 'Chinese' for the moment. A prayer for the souls of the others... the beings worked on by the doctor. "How many other types of... things are there," asks the stuntman, enough of the shock overcome that he's speaking in English now.

"There is more than one?" asks Jet softly. To Morgan, at least, that tone should be alarming. It's only used when the Lunar's rage is right at the limit of her self control. "Why did you make them? How did you make them?" What calm is in her voice is the same quiet that is found in the eye of a hurricane.

"I..." Chen says nothing more. The sphere inside his 'head' shatters unexpectedly, spraying a blue-green liquid across his clothes. His body abruptly falls to the floor. The puppet's strings have been cut. And Jet hears a familiar voice. "I never could get enough of myself," says Snake's voice, emanating from the body of the doctor. "But I think he talks too much. And _you_, you bitch, you shot me!"

Benford senses the change in identity, and draws his weapon. _Rest in peace, I hope._

"A few times," says Jet, her eyes gleaming. "Maybe this time you'll fucking stay dead, you piece of recycled shit!" If there are others around her right now, she's hardly aware. She hears that voice, she sees a clear source, and she's going to pound that source into an unrecognizable pulp.

What Jet's attack lacks in subtle grace it more than makes up for in brutal efficiency. Her right hand straightens and strikes into the flesh of the doctor's recently evacuated body right at the neck, and with a flick of her wrist, the Lunar grabs hold of the cybernetics that form the 'head' of the body. At the same time she leans back and leaps up, kicking out with both feet as she holds her grip, tearing the false head from the body with casual ease.

The voice stops. For long moments, there is silence. And then Schroeder speaks up.

"Guys? I caught something. I think I caught ... him. Will you come check this out for me? Please?"

Jet throws the head aside, pausing for a moment to wipe herself clean on any scrap of the doctor's clothing that isn't filthy. She looks down at the liquid that is all that remains of the doctor and sighs, "Rest in peace, even if you don't deserve it." She looks to Schroeder and nods, "Let's do this."

While the others focus on Schroeder, Xin's attention remains with the fallen Dr. Or Snake. Or whomever... and he realizes... _maybe **I** can answer his prayer._ He kneels down beside the body, and holds his hand over where the doctor's heart might otherwise be. There's a rush of light and warmth, and then smoke rises skyward from where the body once was.
