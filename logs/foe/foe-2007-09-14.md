# Fall of Eden 2007-09-14

"You caught something?" repeats Morgan. "What does it seem like? Does it seem like a voice in your head? What is it saying?" It _sounds_ rather like Schroeder has 'caught' a symbiote - that seems to happen a lot when an Assembled is destroyed - but whatever it is that happened, they need to deal with that before they can work on the rest of the facility.

Benford isn't as shocked as he might be, but the high strangeness of the situation is straining his ability to keep up. "If it's like our Symbiotes, it will speak with a human-sounding voice, but will have no name. If it's like Chen or Snake..." He shudders. "Think of it like a very persistent imaginary friend, and ask it to behave."

"Kids, kids, kids.." Snake's voice comes from the body of Dr. Chen once again. "I'm so glad you managed to snap up a new toy! Well, let me show you some of mine..."

With that, one of the refrigerators on the far wall begins to reconfigure itself. The Celestials can see it starting to reshape itself, surrounded by a silver-and-black aura, and within a heartbeat it has already begun to display humanoid characteristics.

"I can see why you like killing him so much, Jet," remarks Morgan acidly, as he wheels to open fire on the refrigerator without further delay, aiming for the legs while they're still taking shape.

Benford follows Morgan's lead, but with his eyes closed... he recalls the demonstration Selber gave in the Wonderland trailer. The machine is just a vessel, but the gathering essence is the real problem... His eyes snap open, and he concentrates his fire.

The rapidly-forming humanoid twists and bends as the pair's bullets find their mark. The physical and spiritual seem to impact each other, for multiple limbs and twisted appendages form and reform and return to the writhing mass.

Benford says, "Keep it occupied," Benford shouts, "And watch for more!" He looks over a tray of tools that the late Ho Chen was using, finds a screwdriver and a scalpel. "I need to look for something." _Hypatia? Junior? Help me remember the markers... serial numbers, model codes, all that stuff._

"One, two, buckle my shoe," sniggers the voice of Snake. Across the room from the fridge, a similar glow engulfs a blood transfusion pump, and it too begins to twist and transform.

"Shit!" Morgan cries, as the machine morphs. "We need to spill its parts around!" He turns and grabs one end of an operating table. "Jet, Xin, gimme a hand!" he says - and as the transfusion pump begins to twist, he points. "That thing! It looks specialized!"

"Great, we're living some anorexic's nightmare," quips Jet. She mutters under her breath, waiting for a moment, just long enough to see more trouble forming up. "Guys! We need to execute a get the hell out of here maneuver!" She glares at the pump and has no idea exactly what Morgan is suggesting, so she does the best thing she can think of. She turns, tear the surface of the table free and throws herself forward, swinging the whole thing about to smash into the middle of the still-forming enemy.

Morgan hurls himself headlong behind Jet, grabbing a steel support bar out of the air as it pinwheels away, ripped free as Jet pulls the table from its moorings. It's not much of a tool, but it'll help him club down anything with a serial number if it's still moving.

The impromptu operating theater is full of equipment, ringing the central area. Benford finds the machines that aren't moving yet, and prys off nameplates, serial numbers, and labels. What he can't pull away, he simply memorizes; and almost as an afterthought, he unplugs power supplies and pulls circuit breakers, in the spare hope that it will slow the Assembled down.

The original refrigerator seems to have recovered, and finishes reconfiguring itself into a humanoid figure. It throws itself at Xin. As one, Ran and Schroeder launch themselves at it in a counter-attack.

A clawed metal hand bursts through the floor. It grabs hold of Benford's leg, using the leverage to pull the rest of itself up. It seems the Assembled are crafting themselves out of the heating system as well. "Three four, you're fucked for sure," gloats Snake.

"Heh, fought twelve before, Snake," replies Jet. "Gonna have to do a lot better." Having no time to dick around she drops the table top, jumps forward to grab the quickly morphing pump by its forming head, slamming both feet into his shoulders and throwing herself back towards Benford in a tight ball. With a loud rumble of anger she directs the full force of her landing at the rising assembled, trying to smash it through the floor.

"For gods' sake, Snake," growls Morgan, taking advantage of Jet's distraction to shoot the pump's "head" at point-blank range. "You can't even rhyme properly!" He leans back out of the way of its counterpunch, letting a supply cabinet take the hit, and blasts the arm off at the shoulder. Grabbing the dismembered limb, he leaps out of the way, trying to dismantle it even as he dodges the Assembled's counterattacks.

Benford finds a piece of heavy steel tubing knocked free from a gurney, and smashes at the mechanical body with it. "You like to count? I'll turn you into an abacus!"

"Five, six, you've got some limp dicks.. So there, shitlicker!" Another Assembled bursts through the ceiling, dropping directly toward where Jet _was_. It lands in a crouch and coils itself up to spring.

"God, I'm so glad I murdered your weak ass," grumbles Jet. She punches a fist down into the persistent swirling maelstron of the forming heat duct assembled, grabbing it and throwing herself towards the newest opponent. She waits just long enough for the enemy to move first, then spins, pounding assembled with assembled in a screaming shower of flying sparks and twisted metal.

Benford has several handfuls of nameplates, flash drives, and floppy disks, and dozens more serial numbers memorized. In addition, the utilities and communication links of the place should be traceable from the Lands of Light. "Let's save the family reunion for later. Let's clear out while there still exits." He trades the evidence with his handgun in a smooth move, and resumes firing at anything that moves and is not flesh.

"Better! Not that you have one anymore!" Morgan rejoins, trailing pump parts behind him. The pump-monster manages to land a blow that sends him sprawling, but Morgan manages to hook a foot under its ankle, landing it on the floor as well. The monster gets to its feet first, and Morgan crawls to where Jet had ripped the table out of the floor, backing crabwise. The thing leaps - and Morgan swerves to one side, letting it impale itself at the remains of the operating table's supports. As it struggles to free itself, Morgan empties the rest of his magazine into its back, then plunges a hand into the hole and triumphantly pulls free what used to be the back panel of the pump.

Surgerys are remarkably inflammable, when used improperly. The ransacking of the Exalts and Snake's inelegant animation of the machines spill a lot of antiseptics and less-identifiable fluids on the floor. Benford smashes the steel brace into the regulator on a rank of oxygen tanks, breaking both. "Someone shoot the puddles," he shouts, "Then we run!"

Morgan slips and skids across the floor, diving across a table with inches to spare as another refrigerator suddenly comes to life and takes a spirited swing at him. As he rolls to his feet by the exit, and Schroeder and Ran pound past him, he glances around the room one last time, then takes careful aim at a steel crossbar next to one of the puddles and fires, sending sparks flying. He then takes to his heels and runs like the fires of hell are chasing him, as he fully expects they soon will be.

"We're such shitty guests!" Jet shouts out as she races after the others. The flame fans out around the floor, devouring everything they come into contact with. There's barely enough time to clear the building and the first explosion rocks the place, and it sets off the rest. In moments, the entire lower floor bursts outward in a rush of superheated air, the fire blasting out of every window. A few heartbeats later and the whole building is turned into a torch.

Everyone takes shelter in the alley across the street. Benford surveys the damage. "Want to arrest us," he mutters to Schroeder, "Or want to run with us?" He holds up one of the salvaged disks. "Because this isn't over yet."

Schroeder is leaning over, hands on his knees, breathing heavily. The gravity of the situation has caught up with him at last. Finally he finds breath to provide his professional opinion as a law enforcement officer. "That.. was some serious.. shit."

"And that's just..." pants Morgan, "the branch office." He holds up the salvaged pump part. "The main office is in LA, if we can find it. And there'll be more doctors there too. Probably... probably like poor Dr. Chen there."

"Well then what are we waiting for?" asks the agent, grinning nervously.

Benford says, "Then let's get to it. We've got the van. We'll trace the parts on the way."

---

Benford compiles a list of part numbers from the salvaged nameplates, and writes down the serial numbers that he remembers. He hands the list to Schroeder. "The DEA and FDA may track some of these," he begins. "The Assembled are good at hiding their tracks, but if you can get them looking, it's worth a shot, and follows rules of evidence." He pulls out a laptop and slots in a flash drive. "I'll check the contents on these. Anyone who feels like calling hospitals and manufacturers is welcome to do so."

"You give me the list of addresses," says Morgan, "and I'll tell you which addresses are worth looking into." The facility they're looking for in LA is where the organs are actually extracted from corpses, which requires a crucial ingredient - the corpse - which can't simply be shipped in and out openly. That puts some sharp constraints on what kind of building the Assembled can use - for example, it might have a garage that allows a truck to be driven right off the street and closed in without anyone seeing what's inside.

That sort of constraint, of course, would lead to thousands of buildings in the LA area alone, but with Benford's help, Morgan can narrow it down. His primary tool of research is, of all things, the real-estate listings. In the modern age, MLS listings are posted online for all to look up, and things like garage access, square footage, and sometimes even electrical ratings can often be looked up online. And where the electronic listings fail, Morgan can pose as a mortgage adjuster and contact a real-estate appraiser, claiming that he's trying to do some research on a comparable property and can you tell me if this property here has a drive-in garage - it's not in the published listings? Thank you.

Sometimes, everything seems to go just right. It doesn't take more than eight hours for Morgan and Benford to pool their skills, raiding the world of its knowledge and systematically narrowing down a city full of candidates.

They receive some critical corroboration from Schroeder, who claims that there is now a 'voice in his head' who claims to be the doctor. Although Dr. Chen's surviving spirit doesn't seem conscious or cogent, his babbling has provided the keen FBI agent with enough clues to at least satisfy the Solars that they're on the right track.

The sun goes down, and comes up, as the team makes the drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles nearly non-stop. The results are just coming together as the borrowed van clears the Grapevine Pass, the long highway through the mountains that demarcate the boundary between central California and the Los Angeles basin. Schroeder, Morgan, and Benford track leads on a roadmap covered in sticky notes, narrowing the yellow flurry down to a few isolated leads.

As the sun comes up over the City of the Angels, Benford explains the Symbiotes to Schroeder. "We weren't sure if they were artificial, like programs, or made from real people, like the captured soul of the late Doctor Chen. They can be exchanged between Exalts, and can augment your talents. We might be able to get Chen sorted out in time. For now..." He trails off. "God. Try to deal with it. And tell him I'm so sorry."

The Elastar Community Hospital in Los Angeles once serviced Hispanic immigrants, among others. In 2004, it was the third hospital to close its doors in the region. Bankruptcy forced the hospital out of business. Recently, however, the hospital's assets were repurchased. And the money trail leads back to a series of LLCs that are also tied to the improvised laboratory in San Francisco.

The team divides into three pairs. Ran pairs with Schroeder, per Xin's advice, and take the northwest corner. Benford and Poe take the southeast corner, sheltering in the van beneath the highway. Xin and Jet approach the building from opposite sides, looking for both signs of impending trouble, and ways to start some.

Benford says, "Take the magic phones, everyone. Ring in regularly."

To Jet, the building is no different than a person. It is a living, breathing thing. She looks for what manner of thing this building might be. Her sharp eyes take in every detail, from the way people look at the building, whether it's casual or wary, to who goes in and who goes out. Jet studies their hair styles, their shoes, the way they wear their ties, what they drive, and of course what they bring or leave. Any deliveries are given similar scrutiny, and she writes down driver numbers, makes quick descriptions for later reference, just in case she might have to come in as someone's replacement.

The big thing about spying on someone who expects to be spied on is to appear harmless, to not draw attention. Jet's problem is that she'd draw attention no matter where she stood, and a lot of people, especially men, have a way of remembering how she looks that is simply uncanny and has cause wanted posters with her name on them to be remarkably accurate. To cover herself, she's changed to make the most of the situation, and so part of Xin's cover is to be Man Walking Dog. Canines being as they are, it's hardly anything special for this one to sniff at strangers and memorize every scent on every notable surface. Jet clearly likes this role more than is strictly necessary, chasing a few stray cats around and dragging poor Xin along. But even in the 'hunt' she's watching the building from the corner of her eye, her nose catching every scent the polluted wind carries.

The canine is known for more than just its nose. The wind brings whispers from a long distance, and Jet's perception is keen even for a dog. More than that, she's a distraction, and when she runs loose through a crowd, it's natural for her to be noticed, and for Xin to simply fade away, freeing him to take a much closer look at the structure. Jet makes sure nobody is looking when the agile asian starts his ascent to the rooftop.

The hospital seems as abandoned as the paperwork suggests. The appropriate signs are all posted in the windows. The appropriate glass has been broken by the appropriate rocks. And yet... Jet can feel the illusion and see beyond the facade. She can feel the vibrations of air conditioning, deeply buried in the bowels of the former hospital. She traces the electrical connections to and from the building, satisfying herself that no power is being drawn from the grid. And she smells the dirt and grime of a dozen neighborhoods on the concrete near the hospital's back entrance. Trucks have been driven here.

Benford considers what Jet has found. "Well. It seems that we're going get all Second Amendment on this place. But before we do... I want to know, are we going to try to hide the results again? Because the number of buildings that are burning down in our wake is disturbing me. Will the truth come out today, or will we let everyone stay in a pink fog a little longer?"

Morgan looks troubled. "People deserve the truth," he says, sounding distant. "But can they handle this? _I_ nearly panicked when I saw Dr. Chen, and I've almost gotten used to this sort of thing. Even a picture of one of them in the paper... there'd be panic in the streets. Wouldn't there?"

"I doubt it," replies Jet. "You vastly underestimate the ability of the public to face down any new shock or fear with raw, impenetrable apathy. So long as most of them can still get paychecks and watch cable, they will probably look past it. The alien factor might draw a bit more interest, but who knows. Seriously, the public will react however they do, and we'll have to deal with it."

Benford says, "We don't have to hide it, and we can't hide it forever. So many people already believe in angels, and demons, and flying saucers... every sort of crazy thing... well. Maybe we should just get our hands on some firepower, and leave the secrets to the Maidens."
