# Fall of Eden 2007-10-05

FallGM says, "this is another demo log, so just talk normally."

FallGM says, "Get out your sheets. if you don't know the URL, ask"

Benford says, "Got it."

Morgan says, "I has a sheet."

FallGM says, "Today you guys will be fighting each other."

Benford says, "..."

Benford says, "Battle of the Nerds."

Benford says, "I'm glad you're not putting me up against Jet."

Morgan scribbles down some combat values.

Morgan says, "Dodge DV is Dex+Dodge+Essence rounded down?"

Morgan says, "divided by 2."

FallGM says, "divided by 2, rounded up."

Morgan says, "up."

Morgan says, "so Morgan's dodge DV is 4."

Benford says, "And Join Battle?"

FallGM says, "Wits + Awareness"

FallGM says, "http://www.housing.uci.edu/hoteluci/images/floorplan.jpg"

FallGM says, "load this image. this is our battlemap."

Benford says, "My stats still seem kind of high. =\_= I should get someone to check my math."

FallGM says, "What stats?"

Benford says, "Skills, mostly."

FallGM says, "like what?"

Benford says, "Is it unusual to start with 5's in your caste skills?"

FallGM says, "no"

Benford shrugs. "Let's go, then."

FallGM says, "okay. you guys are hunting each other."

FallGM says, "who lives here? whoever speaks up first is the lucky homeowner."

Morgan says, "Yo."

FallGM says, "Declare your location in the house."

FallGM says, "Benford, you're at the entrance."

Benford nods.

Morgan says, "The larger bedroom."

Benford poses.

FallGM says, "don't bother posing."

Morgan says, "Gear?"

Benford says, "OK. Then I've got my gun out and I'm going to run from the entrance to the deck."

FallGM says, "Slow down, chief :)"

FallGM says, "We're not ready yet"

Benford oh

FallGM says, "you've each got Benelli Super 90 shotguns. Stats are as follows:"

FallGM says, "5L damage, Accuracy +2, range (more than sufficient), Shots 3. in other words you can fire once per second."

FallGM says, "but you must still flurry to attack more than once in an action."

FallGM says, "They are Speed 4 weapons."

FallGM says, "before we go any further, gimme your stat-lines for these weapons. this means those numbers but with your effective skill factored in (your Dex+Firearms)"

Morgan says, "Accuracy 6, Damage 5L, Rate 3, Speed 4."

Morgan says, "I assume that guns have fixed damage not modified by strength as with melee weapons or bows."

FallGM says, "Correct"

Benford says, "Accuracy 4, Damage 5L, Rate 3, Speed 4."

FallGM says, "alright."

Morgan \[to Benford\]: "I thought your dex+firearms pool was 4, same as mine. It's only 2?"

FallGM says, "You are also wearing body armor. Soak 6L/6B, Mobility 0, Fatigue 1. We can efectively ignore Fatigue for this fight. Soak and Mobility are important"

FallGM says, "Your total soak is (your Stamina) bashing, (half your Stamina) lethal, plus armor soaks. gimme your total soaks."

Morgan says, "My soak is 7L/8B."

Benford says, "8l,9b"

FallGM says, "Alright."

FallGM says, "roll Join Battle."

Benford goes last, it seems.

Morgan says, "On the general subject of soak, I would remind Benford that at the cost of Essence, he has a caste ability that is combat relevant."

Morgan says, "I don't recall the mechanics, but it may still be worthwhile."

Morgan says, "anyway."

FallGM says, "We'll cover that in a bit."

Benford says, "I know what it is."

FallGM says, "okay. On each tick, you can move (your Dex) yards."

FallGM says, "even if it's not your turn."

Benford says, "So, like, two or three steps."

FallGM says, "yeah"

FallGM says, "example: the master bedroom is 13'7" (so about 4.5 yards) by 11'3" (so almost 4 yards)."

FallGM says, "with Dex 2, you could go from the NW bed to the door in 2 ticks."

FallGM says, "I assume you guys are aware of each other and there is no surprise."

Morgan says, "And with dex 3, I should be able to get from the bedroom to cover the entrance in about a tick..."

FallGM nods

FallGM says, "so Benford gets his first action on tick 4, Morgan gets his on tick 0"

FallGM says, "for example, Guard or Aim would work."

Benford says, "So combat proceeds by counting ticks."

FallGM says, "yes."

FallGM says, "Tick 0. Morgan can act. Morgan and Benford can move."

Morgan says, "Without having Benford in my sights, can I Aim? Or am I restricted to Guard?"

FallGM says, "screw posing unless you want a stunt bonus, just declare"

Benford says, "Run from the door to the patio. Should take about 3 ticks."

FallGM says, "you can aim at the doorway on the theory that he'll cross it"

FallGM says, "okay. Morgan, you're Aiming?"

FallGM says, "3 ticks pass. You hear footfalls .. (Per+Aware dicepool is what? no roll, just tell me your pool)"

Benford says, "4"

Morgan says, "Mine is 7."

FallGM says, ".. and can tell Benford moved to the patio."

FallGM says, "Tick 3. Morgan can act. both can move."

Morgan says, "I will be Aiming, yes. And heading toward the source of the sound and firing as soon as I have a clear shot."

Morgan says, "Which will, apparently, be tick 3."

FallGM says, "were you at the door of the bedroom?"

Morgan says, "I started moving at tick 0 as soon as I heard footfalls."

Morgan says, "By tick 1 I would have reached the door of the bedroom, I believe."

FallGM says, "okay. did I see it declared?"

Morgan says, "No, because I couldn't type fast enough before you resolved Benford's movement."

FallGM says, "actions are simultaneous. if you pre-empt that, we handle it :)"

FallGM says, "but that also means you can't aim for the doorway as such. that means just moving and firing without the bonus"

FallGM says, "your attempt to resolve on the footfalls and hit their source is a function of your regular roll"

Benford says, "Finished the Benelli vid, by the way."

Morgan says, "Okay. Tick 1 I reach the door. Benford sees me emerge, I expect, as he's... passing the table, probably. I will skip Aiming for now and just take the shot, unless someone says I shouldn't be able to."

FallGM says, "you can. make your attack."

FallGM says, "benford, declare your defense."

FallGM says, "You're at the table by this time, so you can stunt to try and improve your defense"

Benford says, "Dive, roll, and slide on my back. Saw it in a movie."

FallGM says, "okay. your dodge DV is?"

Benford says, "3"

Benford says, "Stunt bonus?"

FallGM says, "roll +1"

FallGM says, "nooo."

FallGM says, "you don't roll DV. just roll the stunt die"

Benford oh oh oh

FallGM says, "okay. attack 3 successes, DV 3, you dodge"

Benford says, "Does dodging hurt your ability to react?"

FallGM says, "no. but, taking actions reduces your DV."

Benford aha

Morgan says, "So my DV is now 2 until it refreshes, which will be on tick 5."

Morgan says, "er, 3."

Benford says, "Aha."

Morgan says, "it's 3, since it started at 4."

Benford says, "Is it halved each time?"

Morgan says, "DV decreases by 1 when you take most combat actions."

Benford ok

FallGM says, "Benford hasn't acted though."

Benford says, "Waiting for tick 4"

FallGM says, "okay. Morgan acted on tick 1. speed 4 action + 1 = he acts on tick 5."

FallGM says, "tick 1 ends. ticks 2 and 3, both can move"

Benford says, "one sec"

FallGM says, "Morgan is south of the door of the master bedroom, north of the dressing area and closet. Benford is at the northeast table in the living room. Post corrections if any."

Benford says, "I think that puts me exposed in the middle of the living room, exposed. So I want to get back on my feet and move south into the dining room. That will put some walls in the way of the bedroom. door."

Morgan says, "For my part, I duck back behind the door of the master bedroom."

FallGM says, "okay. Benford can reach the kitchen area and take cover. Morgan has cover."

FallGM says, "Tick 4. Benford acts"

Benford says, "Alright. Stand up, lean around the corner, cover the bedroom door with my shotgun."

FallGM says, "okay. Benford is Aiming."

FallGM says, "Tick 5. Benford's Aim is at +1. Morgan acts."

Morgan says, "In a brilliant burst of originality, I peek around the corner, see that barrel pointing at me, and decide to trade fire with him."

Benford says, "Believe it or not, I didn't expect that."

Morgan (maybe I'll come up with soemthing cleverer later.)

FallGM says, "okay. attacks are resolved simultaneously."

FallGM says, "Benford, roll. your Aim gives you +1"

FallGM says, "cover means Morgan is -2 to be hit."

FallGM says, "I assume Benford has similar cover (-2)"

Benford says, "So overall -1"

Benford says, "Dex + Acc is our attack roll?"

FallGM says, "Dex + Firearms + weapon Accuracy"

Morgan says, "Defense is dodging."

FallGM says, "DV is what"

Morgan says, "4, if it's refreshed by now."

FallGM says, "on your action, DV refreshes."

FallGM says, "Benford's DV is at -1 for his Aiming, btw."

FallGM says, "Benford misses. Morgan, attack."

Morgan says, "OK. Return fire, at -2."

FallGM says, "Benford, your defense?"

Benford says, "Well, it doesn't look like it's going to hurt too bad, but I'll duck back around the corner when I see the muzzle flash."

FallGM says, "so dodge. DV is?"

Benford says, "2"

FallGM says, "bare miss."

Benford says, "3 -1 'cause I aimed."

FallGM says, "Tick 5 is over. Next action for both of you is on tick 9."

Benford says, "But we can move, right?"

FallGM says, "yes"

Benford says, "I want to close. Try to make it to the closet. Not into it, just next to it."

FallGM says, "the closet by the master bedroom? left of the chair and end table/"

FallGM says, "or the coat closet?"

Benford says, "near the chair and end table."

FallGM says, "okay. you can make it there"

FallGM says, "Morgan?"

Benford back in a sec

Morgan says, "Trying to figure this out :)"

Morgan says, "ah. At the sound of approaching footsteps, I close the hallway door."

Benford says, "... didn't see THAT coming either."

FallGM says, "okay, you can do that without an action"

Morgan says, "I then attempt to sneak into the guest bedroom. Dex+Stealth is 4."

FallGM says, "okay. that happens on tick 9"

Benford hmm

FallGM says, "benford can roll Per+Awareness to hear it. Gentlemen, roll off"

FallGM says, "benford hears it. you're trying to re-establish surprise, Morgan, a speed 5 action."

Benford says, "What tick is it?"

FallGM says, "Still tick 9"

Benford says, "Alright. I shoot the door off."

Benford says, "Not shooting AT Morgan. At the hinges on the door he closed in my face."

Morgan says, "Incidentally, the roll to contest reestablishing surprise is Wits+Awareness+2."

FallGM is trying to streamline for now :)

Morgan says, "fair enough"

FallGM says, "we'll get into more detail on things like this, and cover, later"

Benford says, "I assume I don't have to roll to hit the door, so I flurry. One on each hinge and one on the lock. That should be three shots in one action. What tick is that?"

Morgan says, "tonight's mini-lesson: don't send an Eclipse Caste to do a Night Caste's job. Moving on with door go bye-bye."

FallGM says, "I'll say you can listen freely and shoot on tick 9. so the door goes down, and you act next on 13."

FallGM says, "so Morgan has 4 ticks in which to move and re-establish cover"

Benford says, "So he could be anywhere by then."

Morgan says, "I'm still moving for the guest bedroom. You more or less have me cornered unless I choose to blast the window out and jump for it, which I'll consider if I have to."

FallGM says, "alright. You guys take your actions."

FallGM says, "Benford on 13."

FallGM says, "where are you guys, and is the door closed?"

Benford says, "I'm guessing we were aware of the floorplan in advance, right?"

FallGM says, "yes"

Morgan says, "I'm by the closet in the guest bedroom, listening for Benford and trying to figure out if I can catch him unawares. (My action will be on 14.)"

FallGM says, "ok"

Benford says, "Alright. I'm going to step carefully through the door, down that hall towards the guest bedroom, moving at half rate."

FallGM says, "okay."

Benford says, "If I see anything move I dive to the left, that puts me in the dressing nook. I'm gambling that he didn't hide in the bathroom."

FallGM says, "actual attempt at stealth?"

Benford says, "... that would have been a good idea, yes. But mostly I'm just being quiet so I can hear HIM move."

FallGM says, "then roll dex+stealth"

FallGM says, "Morgan rolls his Per+Aware to detect you"

Benford says, "..."

Benford says, "Double ..."

Morgan says, "......"

FallGM says, "okay. establishing stealth on 13, puts your next action at 18."

FallGM says, "morgan acts on 14"

Benford says, "I think you know I'm coming."

Morgan decides his attempt at hiding didn't work, comes round the corner and opens fire.

FallGM says, "okay. Benford, your DV is at -1 for your action."

Benford says, "so... 2"

FallGM says, "I'll give you partial (-1) cover, so Morgan attacks at -1"

FallGM says, "you guys suck. n.n"

Morgan says, "Well, if it'd been two Jet-level combatants, we'd be throwing twice as many dice around."

FallGM says, "Just kidding. these stats are typical for mortals, so typical cops would be rolling like you guys are."

Morgan says, "Plus I didn't take any offensive Excelelncies."

FallGM says, "it's cool :)"

Benford says, "So Morgan misses?"

FallGM says, "Yes."

FallGM says, "you guys both act on 18 and can attack each other"

FallGM says, "remember that you can flurry, and you can stunt"

Benford says, "We're separated by like two meters and an open door, without a hell of a lot of cover. This is not a safe situation."

FallGM says, "well no, it's not safe. you guys are confronting each other with shotguns"

Benford says, "Alright. Then I inch along the wall until I can poke my gun through the door and cover the master bedroom."

FallGM says, "okay. so you guys are hanging back since your last exchange?"

Benford says, "What's the magazine size on a shotgun?"

Morgan says, "Where'd Benford get to?"

Benford says, "Dressing area."

FallGM says, "I'm not worried about reloading for now. I assume you guys have reloaded while moving"

FallGM says, "for demo purposes, it's faster, but yes, you'd want to keep it in mind."

Morgan says, "All right. I'm going to run straight past him during tick 18, firing twice, then continue back on into the living room after my action. My defense will be dodging, since I assume he'll shoot at me as I run by."

Benford says, "Correct."

FallGM says, "okay. Benford can Aim, or he can simply open fire as Benford passes"

Morgan says, "Unfortunately I can't think of a really cracking good stunt pose, but it's something along the lines of taking the bull by the horns, taking bold action, and charging straight into the face of danger."

FallGM says, "I'll give +2 just for having balls to do that."

Benford says, "I wouldn't have been expecting him to charge, since he's been hanging back, so I won't Aim."

FallGM says, "okay. Benford, declare your attac.k"

Morgan totally wastes the stunt dice n.n

FallGM says, "Morgan's DV is at -2 for his flurry"

FallGM says, "Morgan, does that hit?"

Morgan says, "And now it's time for me to spend some Essence! Second Dodge Excellency for six motes."

Morgan says, "I picked that without looking at Benford's roll."

FallGM says, "that's fine, you win. Benford, Morgan @neos his way around your slug"

FallGM says, "you guys can move. position yourselves."

Morgan says, "After my forehad glows for a moment, I rush into the dining room, kick over the table, and take cover behind it, covering the hallway behind me."

FallGM says, "excellent."

FallGM says, "you'll be able to start Aiming on 22"

Benford says, "Well, he just ran by me, I duck into the master bedroom and cover the living room. It should be a good firing position now that the hall door is gone."

FallGM says, "alright. Morgan has cover worth -2, as does Benford."

FallGM says, "tick 22. Morgan is starting to Aim unless he chooses to shoot. Benford?"

Morgan says, "I will Aim."

FallGM says, "okay. you guys Aim. you can preempt any time before Tick 25."

FallGM says, "if not, let me know who breaks first."

Benford says, "Aim and Fire."

FallGM says, "okay. on 25?"

Benford says, "Flurry?"

Benford says, "Explain that to me again./"

FallGM says, "yes, you can flurry"

FallGM says, "so it works like this. for T actions, your FIRST action is at -T"

FallGM says, "your SECOND action is at -(T+1). third (if any) is at -(T+2) and so on."

FallGM says, "thus, flurrying 3 actions makes you roll them at -3, -4, and -5"

FallGM says, "you can flurry different actions, e.g. attacks and athletics"

Benford says, "So that would be, like, 3, 2, 1. But aim - cover means 2 1 0."

FallGM says, "uh, what?"

FallGM says, "you get +3 for your three ticks of aiming."

Benford aha

Benford says, "5 4 3"

FallGM says, "yeah."

FallGM says, "okay. Morgan, you gonna pre-empt, or continue aiming?"

Morgan says, "We're on tick 25?"

FallGM says, "yes, unless you attacked earlier (which I didn't hear)"

FallGM says, "Benford's DV is at -3"

FallGM says, "you can keep aiming to take advantage of that. the risk is that you suffer any wound penalties you get here. or you can attack now, and we resolve it simultaneously"

Morgan says, "I'm gonna take the hits and return fire. Can I also invoke my Dodge charm to boost my own lowered DV?"

Morgan says, "I do also have to remember, for my own sake, that using magic is costly here."

FallGM says, "yes, go ahead and dodge."

Benford says, "My DV is ... 0, then."

FallGM says, "hope you have a Dodge Excellency"

Morgan says, "For the record, I'd already decided this time to spend only 4 motes on the Charm this time. So my DV is 4 -3 for aiming +2 for charm."

FallGM says, "okay. so 4 motes per attack?"

FallGM says, "so DV is 3, 2, 1. Benford hits with net 1 success."

Morgan says, "...huh?"

Benford says, "Does that plink off of armor?"

FallGM says, "he flurried 3 shots."

FallGM says, "You must expend motes to defend against each of those individually. which you CAN."

Morgan says, "Oh, I got it."

FallGM says, "alright. Morgan, your lethal soak?"

Morgan says, "7L."

FallGM says, "okay. Benford, your damage is 5L (the weapon's base damage) + 1 (for your attack success) - 7 (for his soak)."

FallGM says, "however, you always roll AT LEAST your Essence in damage dice."

FallGM says, "so roll 1 damage die. exroll #damage 1"

FallGM says, "okay. Morgan gets clipped."

FallGM says, "tick 26. Morgan can fire. Benford's effective DV is 0, but he has cover (-2)."

FallGM says, "if you have been Aiming since 25, you are at +1"

Morgan hhm, wait.

Morgan says, "How did you figure 5 4 3, Benford?"

Benford says, "dex 2 acc 2 firearms 2"

Benford says, "aimed, but you have cover"

Morgan says, "My normal attack is 6, aiming puts that at 9, cover puts that at 7. To flurry three times would have me at 4 3 2."

Benford says, "I should have had the same... if you want to skip the damage it's ok."

Morgan says, "We won't sweat it. You could've had the same results from flurrying two shots instead of three, which I'm about to do."

Morgan says, "wow."

FallGM says, "unless Benford has a Dodge Charm or effect going, those hit"

Benford says, "So roll yer damage."

Morgan says, "Benford's soak is? (and is he going to use magic?)"

Benford says, "8l/9b."

Benford says, "And I'll use my caste ability if I get fucked up."

Morgan says, "Then it's two plinks."

FallGM says, "Morgan clips Benford."

FallGM says, "took almost 30 seconds for anyone to do any damage."

Benford says, "which puts me at -1."

Morgan says, "Actually, since no one had taken any damage before, we should still both be at +0, unless someone has some sort of crippling disadvantage."

Benford says, "We're not using every trick in the book here. We didn't try the Engine, and neither of us has much for combat charms."

FallGM says, "true."

FallGM says, "but that's good, because I wanted a simple weapons/armor demo"

FallGM says, "now let's try something new."

FallGM says, "Ryushi magically appears with Daoyang, which is a six-foot golden sword."

Benford says, "So as you said, we're basically running this like a pair of cops shooting rock salt at each other in an empty building."

Benford says, "..."

Benford says, "Or we WERE."

FallGM says, "he is going to flurry an attack at both of you. your DVs and health levels are reset."

Benford says, "Can we break for a moment before doing this?"

FallGM says, "sure"

Benford bias

FallGM says, "you guys will die anyway, but sure. :)"

Benford says, "..."

FallGM says, "back?"

Benford says, "Yeah."

Benford says, "Thanks for the vote of confidence. c\_c"

FallGM says, "okay!"

FallGM says, "here's for Benford"

Benford says, "Ryushi is a Dawn?"

FallGM says, "Benford's DV? and yes, he's a Dawn"

Benford says, "3. But in the face of this I'll dodge like someone lit my ass on fire."

FallGM says, "okay. so 7 successes. 17 damage dice after soak.."

FallGM says, "and you die."

FallGM says, "unless! you use your anima ability"

Benford says, "or the Engine."

Benford says, "Or both. As it happens. Which I will do."

FallGM says, "it won't stop you from taking damage."

FallGM says, "but go ahead and see how much damage you can stop"

Benford spends 5 motes to get back 1 health level.

FallGM says, "rock on."

FallGM says, "Morgan!"

FallGM says, "whatever dodge shit you have, use it now"

Benford says, "so 6 boxes instead of 7. Which means I'm barely awake after that."

Morgan says, "Full six motes in the excellency, so my DV up to six."

Morgan says, "er, seven."

FallGM says, "so net 2. your soak is?"

Morgan says, "7L."

FallGM says, "sliced in half."

Morgan says, "And I don't have any tricks I can think of to prevent that."

Benford says, "..."

Morgan says, "So here we see the difference between the Essence 1 level and the Essence... 3? 4?"

Benford says, "So how did he do that, when it took us half a minute to even draw blood?"

FallGM says, "This is not just me showing off. I want you guys to calibrate your expectations: that is the absolute high end of combat and you guys are (currently) fucked if you meet someone like that."

Morgan . o O ( Dropping a ship on me is cheating! Take it back! )

FallGM says, "that is the power level of hypothetical high-end Alchemical combat drones."

Benford . o O ( 'Foul!', he cried, as he fell from the 500th story window. Again. )

FallGM says, "So. that guy is as good at what he does as Benford is at what HE does."

Morgan says, "I'm sure you guys remember the scene of Id vs. Bart and the Yggdrasil I."

Benford says, "There's also this:"

Benford says, "We have ordinary weapons. We're working on masterwork, artifact quality weapons."

FallGM nods

FallGM says, "right now, weapon quality will be a big deciding factor. If your combat stats improve, the benefits of gear will begin to contribute less overall"

FallGM says, "the universe resets. You guys are alive again and at full health, just in time for Jet to attack you."

Benford says, "The Assembled, even the crappiest n00b like Brad, ARE masterwork weapons."

FallGM says, "Jet will use her First Dexterity Excellency. Her Dex+MA is 8 dice so she can buy another 5 dice."

FallGM says, "Benford actually dodges that shit, surprisingly. Morgan, defend yourself."

Morgan says, "Piling on the Second Dodge Ex again as soon as Rabid Jet turns up. DV 7, barely surviving."

FallGM says, "Very good, you guys both live."

FallGM says, "if she had hit, her base damage would be 5B against your soak. You could actually take a few hits while wearing that armor."

Morgan says, "Yes."

Benford hmm

Morgan says, "Of course, with that kind of Dex+MA pool, she can start doing nasty things like grapples on us."

Benford says, "How would you say Jet compares to other enemies?"

Morgan says, "I'd been thinking about grappling Benford, but grapple is Accuracy +0 and I couldn't spare the +2 I was getting from the gun."

Morgan says, "And my MA is 1 dot, same as my Firearms."

FallGM says, "the Alchemicals are about where she is. most of the Assembled roll 6-10 dice"

Benford says, "So it's reasonable to think that if our armor can save us from a few rounds with Jet, it should be about the same with some Assembled?"

FallGM says, "yes"

Benford says, "So let's shoot back. Both of us, do a flurry of 3 slugs."

FallGM says, "go ahead"

Benford says, "No cover, no aim, since this just pops up; should mean 3, 2, 1"

Morgan says, "This is why I don't want to flurry that high with such a small pool."

FallGM says, "her Dodge is 5, so 5, 4, 3 - Benford misses, Morgan misses"

FallGM says, "if we count her earlier attack, though..."

FallGM says, "it's 3, 2, 1, so net 2 get through from Benford"

FallGM says, "unarmored, her lethal soak is 1. so roll (5L) x 2"

FallGM says, "very good, you did some damage."

FallGM says, "typical Assembled soaks have been around 6L - similar to your gear"

Benford says, "Maybe. :/ That means that Jet, without any special preparation, is pretty vulnerable to a fairly low level enemy, like a SWAT cop or a real soldier."

FallGM says, "She has some relevant Charms, like Armor-Forming Technique."

Benford nods.

FallGM says, "and her Dexterity Excellency works on both her attacks and her defenses"

Benford says, "Speaking for myself, though, I didn't really see a how this would play out. I should have been paying more attention."

FallGM says, "hopefully this has been useful for you"

Morgan says, "I also think it'll be worth my while to sort out my Engine Charms. Item one on the list will be a Firearms Excellency."

Benford says, "Yeah. My conclusion is still that we need bigger guns, but now I know why."

FallGM \[to Benford\]: "Now check this shit out"

FallGM | http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibBgBhwafGM&NR=1

FallGM \[to Morgan\]: "this is a new video for you"

Benford says, "... did you see the number of spent shells that guy was standing in?"

Morgan nods.

Benford says, "There must have been nearly a thousand."

Benford says, "That's like 60 pounds of lead."

FallGM says, "and also http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTVBYlHsIRY"

FallGM \[to Benford\]: "so there's a longer video that goes into detail about the Benelli process. But if you are interested in gunsmithing stunting, it's got some ideas - like cryogenic freezing on the tubes and such"

Benford nods. "I took notes."

FallGM says, "so now you guys have seen the weapons. you guys have basic combat experience with your PCs."

FallGM says, "Coordination, Aiming, and weapon stats are your key to victory."

Benford nods.

FallGM says, "any questions? :)"
