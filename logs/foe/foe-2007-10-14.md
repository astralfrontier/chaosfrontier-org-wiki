# Fall of Eden 2007-10-14

"Varekai" has finished its run in Perth, Australia. The Cirque's rotating series of shows travel around the world, carrying their peculiar sense of artistry to every corner of the globe. "Intaca" is making its rounds in the States. But there is another, less family-oriented performance the troupe gives. "Zumanity" is playing in Las Vegas, and it is not far from where the Circle is now.

Jet has heard of the Cirque de Soleil. She checks out Zumanity just enough on the web to know that it is right up her alley. Essentially, this is her area of expertise. She doesn't like travelling alone, so she turns to Poe. She neglects to tell him what Zumanity is like, however. Hopefully he enjoys a good surprise!

Morgan's certainly been to see the Cirque de Soleil's more traditional shows, so he is quite willing to go to see the show. Quite aside from the nature of the troupe as an adjunct to the Exalted cause on Earth, he's never averse to a good solid acrobatic performance, such as the Cirque is known for. However, he is _not_ prepared for _this_ show.

Jet, for her part, is all innocent smiles. She even acts shocked when the performers take off their clothing. Still, Poe probably knows better. It is Jet, and this is _exactly_ the kind of thing she'd love. She's also the first to clap at every stop, even getting on her feet a few times and whistling. "This is great!" She can't help but enjoy it!

Morgan is taken aback at first, and then bursts into grins. "I might've known _you'd_ find a show like this," he says. Still, he appreciates it greatly. The _artistry_ of the Cirque de Soleil is unmistakable; the human form and its motion as art is the troupe's stock in trade, and, even taken in this direction, the effect is... transcendent.

Jet smiles sheepishly at Poe. She knows she's been busted, but she has an excuse. "Well, none of the other shows were very close!" Sure, she'd have gone out of her way to find this one, but she can gloss over that part. Hopefully her warm smiles are enough to keep Poe from that thought. "And just think, if this works out, I can learn from them."

"I hope you don't learn _too_ much, else you might burn the hotel down," Poe remarks, grinning despite his blush.

Jet grins at Poe and whispers, "Yes, but I have a feeling you wouldn't mind. You can help me practice, too!" She can't take her eyes off the performers for long, though. She's not just enjoying this, she's taking notes, and whenever something of particular interest happens, she turns a teasing smile towards Poe.

The show is over far too soon for Jet's tastes. She was just getting into it! Perhaps that's fortunate, though. Most of the audience has had all they can take. Newlywed couples have gotten a lot of ideas. Jet isn't sure just who to approach to make her request. The best she can think of is to head towards the backstage and try to use that password. She no doubt will meet some kind of guard, and she'll tell him, "I'm here to discuss something with the director. An act that they call, 'Avec Etoile'."

---

The Vegas show is covered by Vegas security, and Jet has little luck there. However, mentioning this to the girl behind the ticket counter gets her a phone number written on the back of a business card. "Call this and they'll let you in," she says with a smile. "I hope you both enjoyed the show."

Morgan looks at the telephone number dubiously. "I don't know," he says to Jet. "Maybe it'll be safer if you call. They seem to have a better lock on Solars... maybe they haven't noticed you yt."

Jet shakes her head at Poe. "No risk, no reward," she says chidingly. She uses a pay phone and a calling card she bought from a random gas station on the way home. It's not very easily traced to her, at least.

The voice on the other end is a friendly, somewhat exhausted-sounding male voice. "Yes, what can I do for you?"

"I would like to learn about an act called, Avec Etoile," says Jet. "I was advised by a friend that you might be able to teach me about it and help me get involved." She doesn't try to dress it up in a fancy way. She wants to be direct.

"'The show that'll never run', huh?" the man answers. "Were you in the audience? Anyway, come on back, I'll meet you at the door."

"Yes, I was. Oh, okay." Jet is happy to have that handled so quickly. She wonders why the show might never run. Perhaps that's part of the code. She'll drag Poe along with her and go meet whoever it is that is going to meet her. Hopefully he won't be made of random bits of slot machines.

The Vegas security men step aside at the "back door" - a gate leading to a series of trailers and tents, the Cirque trademark. Behind them, a man comes through the gate and waves. He's tall, wiry, with curly black hair and a sharply-defined nose. He has the "European" look, if Jet were to put a finger on it.

"What can I do for you?"

"Well, I was hoping you might be able to connect me with someone who might be able to teach me what I'd need to know to be part of the act," says Jet. She wasn't really told what to say to that question, but figures this is good enough. "A person I met told me that my special talents could be tapped-into here." And if that isn't overflowing with innuendo, nothing is.

The man nods, chuckling. "We won't be asking you to do anything for _this_ show," he says. "But yes, Avec Etoile is a .... well, a unique program we have. Come inside, will you?"

Jet leads Poe. Or drags him, if necessary. "A pity, really. I am quite fond of this show," says Jet. Well, she is! "I'm sure that Avec Etoile is going to be equally impressive, though." If not quite so stimulating.

The man leads the way to a trailer and steps inside, beckoning for the two to follow. Inside, a woman is languidly sipping from an energy drink and reclining on a bed. She's topless but otherwise dressed. "I'm Carmine, this is Helene," the man says with a smile. "Can I interest you in a drink?"

"Sure, I'll take.." Jet has to pause. They probably aren't going to be mixing up her favorite signature drink. "I want whatever she's having, actually." The Full Moon is far from shy about admiring Helene. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Helene. That's am amazing show."

Carmine goes to a mini-fridge and extracts a bottle of orange Powerade with a quirky smile. "Helene is my wife. We are all family in one way or another. Now.. let me tell you a story, er...?"

"Jet," answers the Lunar. She takes the powerade with a grin. "Please, go on. I'm curious about the ties that bind my family with yours."

Carmine takes a seat. "the Cirque was formed over twenty years ago. Today it is managed by Mr. Laliberte. He was the co-founder, who started from nothing. He encountered a runaway success with the circus, and I would like to say that it was all due to our talent and good management. However, he has always maintained that there was something else, some secret ingredient to our success, and some of us have joked that he made a bargain with the Devil."

"He is more serious than that. At all times he has maintained a 'show that will not run' - a performance that we audition for, we train for, we write music for, but which no audience will ever see. There are no bookings, the troupe is quite secretive, and so on. All very suspicious, yes?"

Morgan laughs. He's managed to get his composure back somewhat, although he's still having to focus somewhat on not staring. "Very cloak-and-dagger, yes. So to speak."

Carmine steeples his fingers as he sits, hunched forward, looking intently at Jet. "Now you come along with this pass-phrase, which means you're to be admitted into the troupe, no questions asked. What does it mean, eh?"

"It means that we're all being guided to some purpose," says Jet. "Though I begin to wonder what it really is. I doubt it's going to be as fun as what I saw on stage tonight. I promise to at least not be a bore to you, though. I doubt I would have been directed to you if I wasn't properly qualified."

Carmine smiles thinly. "Unfortunately I cannot tell you much more, because I do not know much more." He stops a moment and speaks a few rapid sentences in French to Helene, who giggles.

"Speaking for myself," says Poe, "and bear in mind I'm guessing myself... I think it's possible that the time for that show to run may not be too long in coming. Although it's possible that it'll be very different from a show like Intaca, or even Zumanity."

"Well. I suppose we will see," Carmine says. "In the meantime, let me explain how this will work. The show will come to you. You must provide us an address and contact information. The Cirque will speak with you and arrange a place to set up. Will you do this?"

"It may take a bit of planning, since we move around so often," says Jet. "But I believe it can be arranged." She is eager, but she will not throw caution to the wind. More than her own life is at stake if something should go wrong.

Helene speaks a few soft words in French. Her husband smiles. "Helene wishes to thank you for attending the show," he translates.

Jet shakes her head, "It is we who should thank you. I have performed erotic dance before, so I have a special appreciation for the beauty you have created." She admits shamelessly, "I am sure it will color my fantasies for years to come."

Jet takes a moment to consider her options. "Well, the address is a problem, but I can give you my cell phone number. Most of the time we are out west. I am working on buying a place that will give me a more permanent home. Once I secure it, could I call you with the address?"

Carmine nods. "Of course."

"Excellent," says Jet. She turns to Poe and says, "So, you up for a little shopping trip?" She turns to Carmine and actually giggles. She explains quickly, "I'm going to buy myself a strip club, I think."

---

Buying a strip club isn't like buying a pair of boots. It's a hell of a lot more fun. Still, it takes a fair bit of business savvy, and Jet is smart enough to ask the Sidereals for help digging out public records. She even uses contacts in Wonderland to learn who is paying whom and which places are not in any gang's fist. The Gold Club is the top pick. It's struggling lately, and customers aren't showing up as they were. Jet can tell that the crowd there could go south fast, and she's smart enough to know that good public opinion is critical in keeping a club breathing. Liquor licenses can vanish fast when the cops are pissed, and customers don't frequent a place that gets raided, either.

Jet first shows up as a customer. First observation: they charge her a cover fee. It's a bad sign of a strip club hits a girl with a cover. She sees an excess of bouncers. The stage is nice, the girls are attractive. Those are pluses. The alcohol is shitty, the bartender attractive, but untalented. The drinks are mixed weak. The beer selection is weak and ignores the local tastes. The dancers bother men at the rail for tips, rather than working for them. The VIP area is shoddy, over-priced, and not private enough for customers to relax.

Jet even goes so far as to sample the VIP room herself. She's pleased that it's not hard to find a dancer who is up for it. Then again, it is San Francisco. She finds the service generous and playful, to put it mildly. Perhaps it helps that Jet's the best looking woman that has been in this place in months, or perhaps it is because of what she is. The Lunar has a way of attracting others.

Only after she's sure she's seen what she needs (including the bathrooms) she introduces herself to the manager. He's inadequate, and sexist, but makes up for it by also being rude and dim-witted. Jet disposes of him as soon as she can so she can speak to the owner. He is interested in selling. He knows that things aren't going well, and he's pretty much milked the club enough to be satisfied. Jet's offer should provide enough for him to get out of the problems of ownership.

This is where Poe steps in. Being around Jet has done a lot to mitigate his shyness about the 'adult entertainment industry', and he knows his way around a business deal - having read between the lines of enough devious contracts in his 'civilian life' to know what traps can lay in the works. Public records are generally enough for this, so he needn't compromise his secret identity.

Before anyone puts their name on the dotted line, Andrew Morgan _will_ dig up any skeletons the Gold Club has in its closets, or backrooms, or anywhere else. Most such problems - uncertain tax status, poor health-department inspections, liquor license irregularities - can be corrected with money or time. Poe's job it is to make sure that the money comes out of the owner's pocket, that the deal is fair all round. He drives a hard bargain, but an honest one... and he sees to it that the soon-to-be-former owner is likewise honest.

Jet smiles at Poe. She had almost forgotten how good he is at digging out the things that people try so desperately to hide. She has an almost dreamy look on her face as she listens to him deliver his points and the terms are hammered into place. She is able to snap out of it in time to look at the final numbers. Things will no doubt wind up very fair. Under her guidance, this club could definitely turn a huge profit. Having people like Poe helping her all but assures success.

Jet is pleased as can be. She finally has her own club. It's a great beginning for her, and she doesn't try to hide it. Her first order of business is to talk to the girls. Her girls, and set out a few ground rules. She needs to find a good manager for the place, but she doesn't waste time dismissing the current one and setting up a bouncer as the interim manager. She may not think of herself as such, but she has a talent for leadership, and she encourages the staff that they have a real chance here now, and that she's going to do her best for them.

In addition to setting things right in her own club, Jet immediately starts forging relations with others nearby. The competition needs to be assuaged that things aren't going to be tilted badly and that the handling of dancers will be fair. Jet's not ready to fight other clubs to the death. At least not yet. She makes a few plans to improve the club's reputation with the public, too, but she's going to need Poe to get the most of that. She is pleased to note that there are a few apartments above the club as well. She's got her address and a phone number, and she relays that to Carmine right away.
