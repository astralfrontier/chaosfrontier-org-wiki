# Fall of Eden 2007-10-26

Morgan grimaces as he listens in on the conversation between the man from the abandoned hospital - who, he is now all but certain, must be an Assembled - and the MS-13 gangbangers. "This is bad," he mutters to Jet. "We can't take him out here, unless we're planning to put the rest of the hospital in jeopardy."

The two stunned cops have been carried into a side room. Whatever affected them was clearly _meant_ to be innocuous; however, examining them cannot be done inconspicuously.

Jet looks to Morgan and nods. "With MS-13 in this, fighting here might light the whole place up. It isn't likely that they are alone. They might know my face, as well." And they don't want to sell her cookies.

Based on physical symptoms alone, Benford can at least deduce that a neurotoxin of some kind was employed. He concludes from the puncture wound on each one that they were shot with a frozen sliver of the drug, which dissolved itself in the wound and entered the bloodstream, rather than being carried by a dart. Further, he can deduce the ideal outcome of the toxin, if not its actual mechanism - to do what the visitor wanted, it would have to paralyze the body (which seems indicated), then interfere with short-term memory. You can't afford for your victims to remember your visit, even if they were awake when you shot them.

"I think we've heard enough," says Morgan, backing away from the door and taking up station in the nearby side room. "We can guess our friend will be going back where he came from, and the others will... go wherever they go, I guess."

Police presence at a hospital room usually means one thing: the occupant is wanted by the law.

Benford leaves the two officers standing where they are. "I'll explain later," he mutters, intending to do no such thing, and goes to rejoin his fellows. "You have better things to do than getting killed."

Jet follows, pausing only to scent the air slowly and carefully. The hospital is a mingling of scents, but she can try to memorize what she senses here. "They will go back to partying and god knows what else." But she probably has a good idea.

The Twilight is met on his way out by his two companions, who wave him back into the room to watch. "Our party guest is Assembled," Morgan explains briefly. "He's working with MS-13 to fit them up with super organs and neurocytes. It's just like in Tijuana, only more so." He nods to the room that, until recently, had been guarded by the police. "We're waiting till they leave."

"And then what?" Benford asks. "Grab them? What are we going to do about the Assembled?

"Convince me that it's worth the risk to start a firefight in a hospital and I'll gladly back you up," replies Morgan. "Otherwise, I'd just as soon save the Assembled for when he gets back to his lair, and the MS-13 for another day."

Benford nods. "Alright. But then, if we leave now, maybe we can beat the tin man back to his lair."

"We had better hurry, then," says Jet softly. "MS-13 is not something we want to wake up without preparation."

In about ten minutes, the Exalts become aware that the two Mara Salvatrucha members are leaving. About five minutes after that, they hear the sounds of a gurney being pushed down the hall. Jet can hear the room number itself being mentioned. The patient is being moved.

"Well, that tears it," mumbles Morgan. "He's the surgeon. But who's helping him? And what is he planning to do about it when they see what he's planning to put in the patient? He _has_ answers to those questions. It would help us to know what they are."

Benford says, "And better here than his lair. Let's go."

From their own room, the group listens to, and watches, the hospitalized youth being loaded onto the gurney. He is securely strapped down, then wheeled out. In the hall however, the Exalts can hear a raised voice: "What about the security detail?" The Alchemical's answer is smooth, of course. "He's sedated. I dismissed them for the duration of the operation." But the Celestials know this to be a lie, and now they know as well that he's aware of someone else's presence.

Benford slips quietly into the room, behind the gurney team. "'Dismissed'?" he grunts. "That's an odd way to put it. So what word are you abusing, to describe what you are doing here?"

Two nurses, a doctor, and a humanoid machine turn to regard Benford as he makes himself known. The human doctor protests; the Alchemical smoothly raises a hand. "Please prep him," he asks. "I must speak with this man."

Benford says, "I thought you might do me the courtesy of allowing me to inspect the patient. This isn't his first surgery, is it?" He directs the last comment towards the (presumably human) doctor. "You don't see a case like this every day." He glances over the patient, trying to take in the situation in an eyeblink.

"Not every day, but often enough," the doctor grumbles. Benford's eye goes to the chart first.

The victim, Manlio Socorro Farabundo, was brought to the hospital a week ago. He was the victim of multiple gunshots and was stabilized after a few medical miracles. He stayed in intensive care for several days, and is presumably being prepped for follow-up surgery.

The signs on the man's body corroborate almost all of this story. Benford can see the fresh surgical scars, the abrasions and contusions of violence, and a number of sutures on his arms and legs.

Benford shakes his head. "Tragic. And the next of kin has consented, I assume, despite the risks." He replaces the chart and steps out of the way. "So who are you, then," he asks the bespectacled figure.

"I'm Doctor--" The Alchemical is cut off by the other doctor, who was ready to wheel the patient off. "Who are _you_," he asks, furiously. But again, a wave of the hand from the Alchemical is enough to restrain him. Whoever the machine is or purports to be, he commands considerable respect.

Benford waits for Farabundo and his minders to leave. "In principle," he begins, "I'm all for saving lives. I would ask 'Why this way,' but the answer is obvious. Still, I'd like to hear it from you. What will you be doing with your converts?"

"Perfecting them," the Alchemical answers with a sly smile. And then his face loses all trace of emotion, and his voice becomes as flat and factual as every other machine Benford has spoken to. "They are being improved."

Benford says, "Of course. And what of the ones you killed to design the improvements? Necessary sacrificies?" He doesn't wait for the answer. "Did you calculate the odds that I'd let this pass without comment? My patience is not infinite."

"I disagree with the metholodogy employed by the procurement program. I will pass along your concerns, if you wish," the 'doctor' answers.

"To whom?" pipes up Morgan.

The Alchemical becomes aware of Morgan's presence. "To the administrator of the overall project," he replies calmly.

"Why not just give us the administator's address and we can deliver our complaints directly," suggests Jet evenly. "Maybe we could prevent future misunderstandings."

Benford says, "Let's put this simply," Benford adds. "We want you to stop. We know you won't. But we're giving you an opportunity to do so anyway. Otherwise, you force us to... quarrel."

"Stop improving people?" the faux-doctor asks calmly.

"Stop altering people," replies Jet.

Morgan slowly raises an empty hand. "The friends of your patient were also skeptical of your intentions. I believe the form of words was 'What's your angle?' It is human nature to disbelieve in something for nothing. If your goal is to perfect humans, we will naturally assume you stand to gain from it." He pauses. "And if you do not tell us _what_ you stand to gain, we will suspect that we are being taken advantage of. As with your patient's friends..." He gestures to Benford and Jet. "...so with us."

"What I stand to gain is the satisfaction of a job well done and a greater understanding of this new science of 'biology'," the machine says. "You are no doubt referring to the incidental organizational effects, however. I have not been assigned to that aspect of the project."

"Oh, of _course_," Benford says, expelling the phrase like it has a bad taste. "Not your assignment. Someone else's program. Et cetera, et cetera. You disagree with the procurement methodology, but you're just doing your job." He throws up his hands, in exasperation. "We've heard all that, all through human history. And you know what we've learned? It doesn't work that way. Humans can't just disclaim responsibility so easily..." he points at the Assembled. "And neither can you. You are all a thousand voices of the same mind. You've got even less excuse than us, to ignore what your fellows do." He drops his hand. "I expected better. You disappoint me."

"Suppose I were to fire one of my stings at your neck," the doctor says calmly. "You would be paralyzed. The toxin operates on the nervous system. It interacts with the brain, inducing a temporary hypnagogic state.... tell me. Are the muscles to blame for failing to move the body, in that case?"

"So you are no more than a muscle, without any higher responsibility than to flex when told to?" asks Jet. "Do you have a mind of your own, or are you just a part of a great machine? To us, there is a great difference between the two. I suggest you answer carefully."

"I cannot betray my function." The doctor is still calm as ever, either oblivious to or dismissive of the implied threat. "I exercise discretion in how to perform it. I am both muscle and man."

"So tell me do you have any choice in your function? You say you do not approve of the methods. So what then? You just log a complaint and that's all?" asks Jet. "You don't sound like much of a man."

"Yes, that is all," the thing replies. "My unique perspective will be factored against the perspectives of others involved in the project. The synthesis of those viewpoints will guide future activities. You refer to it as 'evolution'."

Benford shakes his head. "No, sir. We refer to it as a 'cop out.'"

"That's not my department, says Wernher von Braun," mumbles Morgan under his breath. "Very well, then. You are a cog in the Machine, and the left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing unless it has a Need To Know. It's all guided from the brain." He shakes his head at Jet. "So you see, there's no use insulting him. He has no ego to be bruised."

Benford says, "We should go. This one can't negotiate, and I tire of wasting my breath on small cogs. I can only hope his masters find him of more use than we have."

The Alchemical shrugs. "Consider the alternatives. First, I resign my position, as a human professional might do. In which case the function I was performing goes undone. Or, someone else without my reservations replaces me, and my objections lose any strength of position they may have had. Second, I employ force to oblige others to accept my perspective. In this case, the ultimate outcome is dictated not by correctness of action, but by whoever can muster the most violence." His voice shifts, regaining some measure of emotion. "Are you seriously telling me that this is what you regard as the sane solution?"

Benford says, "I'm not telling you anything about sanity and madness. But we've also heard the argument that they'll only get someone else. That doesn't matter. You make your choice, and they'll make theirs. That's how you become more than a piece of the machine. Is that what you want? Or can you tell me that a mind with no unified will is any better sanity."

"If you really believe in something, you have to be willing to fight for it in whatever capacities you believe are just and right," suggests Jet. "In your system, it seems there are no ways to do this, just logic." She looks to Morgan, "There's nothing here to talk to, whatever individuality exists has almost vanished in some sort of bureacracy."

"So you suggest that if I don't like a thing, I should withdraw and have no further influence over it?" The Alchemical now sounds even more animated. "That's the very definition of a 'cop-out'. 'I object to the things you do, so I quit! I can't stop you, but at least I won't be helping anyone!'"

Jet tilts her head and looks at the doctor curiously now. "Hmm.. interesting. There is someone there, isn't there?" She smiles and nods, satisfied. "You aren't just a cog. You have a real personality. You have emotion, don't you? But tell me, what influence do you have over it, if you can only file a complaint? Does that actually work?"

"If it didn't work, then we would act to repair it." The Alchemical gestures at the hospital rooms. "If consensus failed, it would be as serious as a failure of your heart."

Morgan rubs his chin. "This argument is _important_ to you, isn't it," he muses. "It's not just an academic debate. You feel it's important that we learn the virtues of cooperation and working within the system."

"Yes. But I also feel it's important to perform the surgery you are holding me back from. Now. Stop me, or let me perform my role."

"Morgan, from what he says, they actually do cooperate," says Jet. "That's pretty amazing, and to us, damn near alien. In our world, if you file some sort of complaint it's essentially worthless. It'd be easier to believe if we saw some proof." She pauses to look at the doctor, "Can we observe? We are curious."

"You may if you wish." The doctor turns, making to follow the departed gurney.

"I see no reason to stop him when we could be learning instead of fighting," says Jet. Besides, this guy is giving a weirdly good vibe.

Morgan nods to Jet. "Complaining is so often worthless because powerful people benefit from the system as it stands... because of ego," he says. "That, at least, is one thing the Assembled do not suffer from." He nods to the Assembled surgeon's retreating back. "Shall we?"

Benford says, "For the sake of his patient only," Benford mutters, but he doesn't interfere with the nameless doctor, for a patient has a right to care, even from an alien.

---

The operating theater has been prepared. The three assistants stand by. Without missing a beat, the Alchemical darts them. They fall into the same rigidly comatose state as the two police officers. And then he starts shedding his clothes.

"That's just creepy," murmurs Jet. "They will be okay?"

Benford says, "I'm certain the effects are temporary. They won't even have a headache. It makes it hard to hate this one."

His arms and legs reveal seams, and separate. He crawls over the top of the operating table and undergoes an uncanny metamorphosis in doing so. Limbs, body, and head become mechanical feelers and tendrils. What was once a doctor is now a multi-limbed robotic device.

A voice comes from the mechanism. "They-will-recover-within-an-hour," it says. "I-must-work." And so saying, the thing extrudes a set of scalpels and syringes.

"I think hating these creatures has no meaning," says Jet quietly. "What the..?"

The operation does not take long. The construct works with robotic speed and precision. It works in ways no human doctor could possibly achieve. It seems to even include some sort of life support, for the patient's vital signs stay steady on the monitor.

"Well, no wonder he doesn't consider questions of policy," mumbles Morgan, wide-eyed. "There's no _room_."

Benford's jaw drops. "Bushbot," he croaks, with a mixture of surprise, excitement, horror, and fascination. "Jesus Helios Jones. It's a bushbot."

Jet has no idea what Benford is talking about. She only sees something almost artistic in the way the machine moves. To her, it is an appreciation of movement, even if she does not know exactly what is happening. "Pamela Anderson would love one of these."

The surgery is completed in only a few minutes. The patient is sealed up with some sort of bluish liquid which closes the incision lines. And a few sconds of transformation are all that's required for the Alchemical to regain his human form. He dresses and turns, regarding the Exalted.

Jet slowly rouses herself from observing to interacting. After a few moments of staring at the assembled she asks the first question that comes to her mind. "Who are you?" She's looking for more than just a name.

"I am Doctor Engel," he answers. "My function is the improvement of humanity."

"Why is it that you do it this way, instead of teaching them how to improve themselves?" asks Jet softly.

"You cannot teach a malfunctioning organ to work properly," Engel answers.

Benford remembers his time in the wheelchair. "No," he mutters. "Nor malfunctioning genes."

"Is that all we are, malfunctioning organs?" asks Jet. "And because of this malfunction, we should have no say in the matter of this improvement?"

Engel shakes his head. "You speak too metaphorically. I mean literal organs. The heart. The lungs. The kidneys. The muscles. You, the Exalted, seem to be free of these maladies. However, humanity as a whole is not."

"Yes, but why not teach humans how to replace these organs? Is that not more efficient than doing the work all by yourselves?" asks Jet. "Aid their evolution, but do not dominate it."

"You already understand organ transplantation. However, consider this: you condemned the National Socialists for their human experiments, but you used that knowledge. We have only discovered this science faster, because our methods permit us to."

Benford takes a step towards the patient. The implant job was perfect. The scars are barely detectable. "We improve more than that," Benford says, distractedly, considering how advanced the prosthetic must be, to mesh so easily with the rest of the body. "And in truth, our quest for ideals is imprecise and full of tragedy. Do you know the use this man's associates will put him to? Is it a better world, where MS-13 has more power?"

"Your positions are maddeningly inconsistent," remarks Engel. "You berate me for being unwilling to fight for my convictions. There is no single moral or ethical position - do I understand you to mean that you want me to improve only some people? Or improve nobody?"

"If I am selective about the people I assist, I become the arbiter for humanity's improvement. That is not my function and it is beyond my power to manage such a large data set. Instead I rely on consensus."

Benford says, "I say only that there are consequences beyond your purpose. Humans often do no better than the concensus. But then, we don't often have to." After a beat, he repeats, "We should go."

"We use what was learned because we believe knowledge itself is not evil, but the methods to attain it may be," says Jet. She should find the fact that she's debating ethics with a super robot hillarious, but she is taking it quite seriously. "By using the knowledge, those who suffered and died did not do so in vain. Even so, there is more to evolution than raw knowledge." She looks at the doctor closely and says, "I think you should teach humans how to improve themselves in an open and fair way, and then leave it to them to decide how to proceed. Even if it then fails, you did what most humans would think is the right now."

"There is no end of evil that humans would work if we gave them the spinner," Engel says quietly. "However, if you wish to leave, you may do so. I must alter the charts and file paperwork."

"I think I would like to talk to you again sometime, Doctor Engel," says Jet. "I want to learn more, and I would like to know if your evolution and improvement has a way to control the evil of men without flipping off their free will at the same time."

"We shall see. But, if you disagree with the program.." Engel stops, considering. "This man, 'Snake', controls the aspects of it which we both disagree with. We.... shall see."

"Then perhaps I can help you, even if it is in a way you will deplore," murmurs Jet. "I too aid evolution in my own ways, and I am given a broad sphere and much freedom in deciding what function I will serve at any given time."

Morgan can't let that pass - but he keeps his face impassive, with some effort. "Before we leave, may I ask whose idea it was to put a mortal human soul in a position of authority on your project, if you know?"

"You can ask. I won't tell you," says Engel.

Benford says, "Then can we bring anything to Snake for you?"

Engel shrugs, and says nothing more.

Jet looks at the doctor curiously, and smiles at his answer. "I cannot make any promises, and I do not think you can assist us in dealing with Snake, but I will do what I can. I just have this feeling we stand near a terrible precipice. We will either be at war with each other to the ruin of all, or we will find moments of consensus to pull back from the cliff. I do not wish to see who might survive the fall."
