Meeting Engel has added a new wrinkle to the situation. "Engel is tractable; Snake is not. Chen was working with Snake, so we need to know what he knew... knows... whatever." And so Benford and Schroeder resume the effort to reconstruct Chen's ego. Or more accurately, Benford does; without a working symbiote of his own, Schroeder is, for the moment, in the dark.

Benford is back among the glittering fragments of Chen's psyche. The countless fragments fill the sky in every direction. Benford and Poe's previous exercise re-assembled a few into a coherent subset. Now the scientist seeks a means of ordering the rest.

The fragments are still as random and varied as before. "Somewhere in here is his ego," Benford thinks.

"So what is an ego supposed to look like," Benford wonders. "Junior, are you here? Does any of this look familiar to you?"

"It looks like a mind," Junior's voice observes. "What you are seeing is extremely fine, imprinted Essence. Drawn from the will of the host, woven into thought, reified through action."

Benford says, "So which part are we missing? The will, the thought, or the action?"

"It's not so much that he's _missing_ anything, I'd guess.." Junior muses. "What he lacks is organization. Throw a handful of capacitors and diodes and resistors onto the table, and they don't make a circuit. The same principle applies here."

Benford considers the analogy. "Then I've vastly under-rated the complexity of the human mind. There's more moving parts here than... well, anything I've ever seen. Except the Spark. Which I suppose is the point."

Benford notices that the toroidal core from the previous experiment has grown. Some of the drifting fragments have attached themselves to the periphery, and the whole assemblage glows a little more brightly. "Hmm. Like protien docking... but at this rate, it will take years. Perhaps we can speed this up." He catches a few fragments, searching for ideas and abstractions. He whispers to each one, "You are needed, Doctor Chen. Find your friends. Spread the word."

"It turns out that it's not necessary to accelerate every star in the sky," Benford thinks. "Just a few attractors should speed things up quite a bit." He closes his eyes, concentrates, and when he looks again, he's in a different part of the sky. He releases a few more fragments as nucleation points, and repeats the process several times before returning to the core.

In nature, order can come from chaos with just a little selection pressure. It's true in genetics, fusion physics, and, Benford hopes, the process of reconstructing minds. An alert mind can greatly accelerate the process, so Benford returns to the growing hub and concentrates on the task. Mathemeticians call it 'supervised learning'; Benford uses himself as the referee for any conflicts among the seekers, and patterns missing data on his own mind.

And since Benford is using his own mind as a model, he decides to give Chen something to live for. Benford recalls what it was like, when he was finally able to walk again. "There is hope in this world," he whispers. "The Primordials don't understand it. The Gods don't guarantee it. But there are people that choose to take our world and make more of it than a place to survive. Hope is our gift to each other. Remember that and walk again."

The galaxy of memories is moving faster now, but will still take months to condense. Benford concentrates on his own memories of Engel and Snake, and imagines what it must have been like for Chen to go through his transformation. He also recalls the 'abduction experience' that Poe saw in the Lands of Light, presuming that it must have been similar for Chen. Essence comes from the exercise of Will, and all around him is patterened Essence; so Benford's will, acting through the proxy fragments, should find the similar experiences in Chen's history. "We need to know how it happened. We need to know how we can find Snake, who controls him, and how we can defeat him."

Fragments and figments find their way to Benford, and like a giant, multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, he fits them together. One the first of them are in place, it's easier to find the 'docking points', so to speak, a core upon which to accrete. In the center of it all, Benford places a copy of his own memories of Snake and Engel. The scientist experiences a moment of vertigo, like he's seeing both through the copy and through his own eyes. "Curious," he says, and searches further through the gathering mass.

Once upon a time, a Solar journeyed into the very heart of Autochthonia. His name was Davron, and he was on a mission. And he, too, lost his memories.

It was something he said to himself which brought him back. "'It has never been done.'" He dared to build a machine that would manipulate his Spark of Exaltation, to remold his soul. He brought out the demon of the id, Arandor, and defeated it.

His machine, designed to draw out the Essence of the self and contain it, was refined. It was perfected. It was embraced and extended.

It is the descendant of that machine which Benford now sees in the memories of the late doctor. He sees the Chinese surgeon strapped into the restraints. He witnesses the Essence-driven operation of it, knowing full well that a single use of the device probably consumes as much magical force as that wielded by all the prophets and saints of Earth's history together. And now he realizes where it is.

Benford knows now why Eddie's background is that of a Californian. He can guess why Alice could guide Xin to the access point. Why Chen was found only a few blocks away.

Infrared.

Benford exits the simulation. Schroeder has been waiting patiently on the opposite seat, blind to the drama in his own head. Benford carefully controls his expression to mask the wonder and horror and anger and urgency. He's angry at himself for not seeing it sooner. "We need an air taxi back to San Francisco," he tells the fed. "And let me introduce you to your new weapon."

The Exalts now learn that flying is faster than driving. Rather than spend another evening watching the scenery crawl by on I-5, Barry arranges for a private pilot whose curiosity falls as his hourly rate increases. California is a lot smaller from the back seat of a Bell 212 helicopter flying at 200 knots. The bright, rectangular lights of Los Angeles at dusk fades away into the south, and as evening falls, the equally bright but less regular lights of San Francisco appear in the north.

Morgan looks troubled as the chopper descends. "Have we thought this through?" he says. "We started out looking into the organ theft operation. All well and good. Now we're taking on something much bigger. The organ operation is important to two Assembled, as far as we know - Engel, and whoever Snake is working with. This thing is important to all of them. Are we really ready to go to war with all of the children of Autochthon?"

"No," Benford replies, "which is why we've been talking to them when we can. But can we afford to let them keep it? Make more agents like Snake? The Earth wasn't ready for that thing. The Solars made it. The Solars have to take responsibility for it. That means us. Otherwise, the children of Autochthon don't have to go to war. They can just do what they want."

Morgan rubs his head. "I know what you mean," he says. "But they won't be able to let it pass. If we take it from them intact, they'll stop at _nothing_ to get it back. And you know they have no morals as you and I understand them, anyway. And if we destroy it... well, they won't hold a grudge, but they _will_ consider us too deadly a threat to their operation to be allowed to persist." He looks around at the rest of the Exalts. "I agree with Benford that we can't let them have this thing. And I also know that they are growing stronger every day. But can we stand against them, if they devote _all_ their resources to stamping us out?"

"If we can't now, waiting will only seal our fate," says Jet. "If we don't do this, we're living at their mercy, and only thinking to survive as long as they find us amusing or interesting. They already started the war. It's time they got a good taste of it on their turf. Besides, I've already made plans to get my family out of their crosshairs. We're going to have to lay very low for a while. I hope you guys like the great outdoors."

"We're going to have to stand against them sooner or later. We're as prepared as we can be, now, aren't we? I'm not sure what else we can do to get ready for this... short of getting tanks," says Xin. "I'll fight at your side to get this thing. We'll see just how ready we are to stand against them."

"Well, we could just nuke the city," says Jet. "If you are up for that. I don't think I am. Sets a pretty nasty precedent and kills a lot of people."

"We don't have to nuke anything," Benford shudders. "We were chosen. Whether you believe in gods or not, we have to believe in the authority they gave us, and that is enough. Otherwise... well, what have we been doing all year, anyway? We're it, m'lords and m'lady, for better or for worse."

Morgan looks to his friends. "Very well, then. I'll stand with you, and do all I can to help. But if you're interested, I think there _is_ one more thing we can do to prepare for war with the Assembled: find more Exalts. We are not the only ones sent to this world to deal with Autochthon's invasion."

Xin says, "You are right. They are answering the call. The Blood of the Dragons is flowing here. Two of their children have already joined us... after this we'll look for more. Perhaps this machine can help us in ways we wouldn't expect. I imagine it can teach us alot about ourselves."

"Then let this fight be our rallying cry to the others. If this is war we're declaring, at least it's on our terms," says Jet. "There won't be any talking this time."

Benford considers his allies; there is more competence in this one small cabin than in some armies. _And yet, if we had more..._ "Shall we be Terra's Deliberative, then, and do for our world what the Great Deliberative did for theirs?"

"In that case," says Morgan, "let us bring cameras with us. This war won't stay confined to us Chosen for long - the people we seek to protect will be caught up in it. They will need to see what they are up against." _And they will need to be won over._

Xin says, "Ah. Isn't that how it goes... the revolution will be televised?"

Morgan fixes Xin with a penetrating stare, and gives him his best anchorman voice. "This one will be."
