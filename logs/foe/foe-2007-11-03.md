# Fall of Eden 2007-11-03

"So what do we do about the civilians?" Morgan is saying. "It's a nightclub. The place is going to be crawling with them around midnight. And by the time they finally start crawling home, normal people are starting to go to work."

Benford says, "We'll set off the fire alarms as soon as we get there. I don't want to hurt any innocents, and I'd rather capture the symbiote device if possible. And as to rules of engagement, don't shoot until we're shot at, except for Snake; and, we should be smart about tactics. Concentrate your fire on tough opponents. Shoot whoever Jet is chewing on at the time."

"I don't think we can afford to wait until shot at," says Jet evenly. "This isn't a fight anymore. This is war. Wrong place, wrong time, bad luck. A lot of people die tonight, they just won't get around to doing it for a few weeks." She looks off into the distance and growls, "We shouldn't pretend that we're not going to break a lot of lives to save the world."

The helicopter is making its final descent into San Francisco. Morgan is looking through the galaxy of streetlights for the tiny speck that is the Infrared nightclub, one of the Assembled strong points in the refuge of Gaia, and - as the Exalts have recently learned - the site of the device that was used to create symbiotes from the souls of mortal humans.

Benford says, "Then let's start on the roof and work our way down. I don't think it will take them long to work out that it's time to leave."

Infrared is new, and downtown. There's a parking garage directly next door and below street level, which services the club and other adjacent businesses. The club itself is one floor; the dance area, bar, and seating are familiar to those who have visited the place, as is the back room. The roof is accessible and relatively uncluttered. Paradropping onto the roof from a helicopter will rouse attention at any hour of day or night, but it can be reached easily enough from the roofs of less dangerous establishments.

As far as anyone remembers, the visible parts of the building follow code exactingly. Fire escapes, ladders, and other points of entrance or egress are all well-understood.

The club has no windows to speak of - better to insulate the sound of late-night revel, and to control the lighting. There are no security cameras or other signs of external security. The club relies on the locak constabulary, not surveillance.

Physically it occupies almost a third of a city block, larger than a good-sized family restaurant. The back of it is flush with the walls of the business on the next street over. There is no functional alley or back-door out of the club. In the event of fire, patrons would leave through the front or through a side door, down to the parking garage.

Benford glances at Schroeder; the federal agent isn't saying much. "Apart from the nineteen or so felonies involved, does this seem tactically sound?"

Schroeder shrugs. "How should I know?" he asks. "If it were people, I'd have an answer for you."

"But I do remember one thing. A guy who had served in Desert Storm once told me, 'it's not about peace or freedom. You do what you have to for the guys next to you.'" The agent glances from face to face. "Doesn't matter what it is you're doing, if your guys back you up, y'know?"

Xin nods, "Then let's go, while we still have guys to back us up."

"We've done this before," says Jet simply. "We've faced far worse battles than this, far more hopeless. We have always won in the end."

---

June 1, 2008. Dawn. The auspicious hour of War among the Solar Exalted.

Ran and Schroeder are relegated to backup. The fewer people in the club, the more easily they can be coordinated. Backup also means safety from ambush.

Barry has promised a novel, but unspecified, solution to the problem of a police response should anyone phone in what the Celestials are doing.

The way the Lunar strokes her hand along the access hatch makes it clear that Jet has done this before. It's a light caress that tells her the weight of it, the way it is sealed, and how much strength it would take to tear it open. She knows her immortal power would allow her to tear it apart, but this is a matter of grace and thought. She can feel a slight give and she smiles. "Ah yes, of course," she mouths to herself, lowering her ear to the hatch. Her fingers hook under a part of the hatch, and out of sight, they change for just a moment, stretching unnaturally far as she seeks the lever that allows emergency access. There is an air of supreme focus about her, a stillness that the dawn winds cannot disturb even as they fan her hair out around her.

Jet discovers that the owners of the club have also added something new to the hatch. Something explosive. Something that is left non-functional as Jet eases the hatch open.

"We're in." Jet looks down for a moment and descends head first down the ladder, blending in with shadow and so silent most would think her heart isn't even beating.

The night club is silent. The four Exalts drop down as noiselessly as possible. They see the bar, the chairs, the restrooms, the door out. They see the dance floor itself.

No basic security, but booby traps that would blow up any normal intruders. Jet knows she is in the big leagues now. It's here, but where? She draws her breath in and focuses on the scent first, trying to find a hint of something like gas, oil, or metal as she makes her way slowly towards the server room.

Jet can make out the sounds of grinding and the smells of lacquer and exposed insulation. Something is coming.

Xin walks as silently as he can towards the server hall, stopping only to check the restrooms as they pass them. "It wouldn't do to be caught off-guard," he whispers.

Jet makes a quick gesture. It is enough to indicate trouble and for everyone to hide.

Xin rolls delicately under one of the tables, glancing around warily. He motions for Benford to stay close, whispering, "We can push the table over when we're found out. Great for cover and getting away."

Benford nods, saying nothing; he's loud enough without opening his mouth.

Morgan dodges around the tables and makes for the bar, hunkering around the corner with his shotgun pressed up against his shoulder. Aware of the Assembled's penchant for materializing from the equipment to hand, he remains alert to the beer taps and other gadgetry behind him.

The Celestials become aware of intruders. One is emerging from the back hallway; the other is coming out of the elevator. The parking garage elevator didn't activate, however; perhaps the creature constructed itself inside (or out of) the elevator and is simply emerging.

Xin is already moving when he hears the assembled coming down the hallway. The door starts to open, and is quickly kicked back with full force, shattering against the assembled.

The door splinters, as does the Assembled behind it. Xin's foot left a hole in the wood paneling; through it, he can see metal shrapnel slamming into the walls of the hallway.

Benford kicks his table over, putting the top between himself and dance floor. He steadies his shotgun on the top edge, covering the club to the west, where he can make out something moving in the gloom.

Jet smashes through the DJ's table, both hands grabbing hold of broken bits of it as she charges over the dancefloor to the nearest enemy. She slams at the enemy with a fist full of metal shards.

The Lunar's fists, plus the improvised fistload, do considerable damage to the metal man. He staggers around, flailing spasmotically. This pair seems weaker than the others the Exalts have faced - so much the better for them. Perhaps they are only intended to be an emergency measure, or a first response?

Xin backs up towards Benford, eyeing the exposed wiring warily. There's a bit of a rush from kicking the daylights out of the Assembled, though.

Benford draws a bead on Jet's opponent, unwilling to take a shot while the Lunar is in melee.

As Jet smashes the Assembled and backs away, Morgan quickly takes in the situation. Benford is moving across the floor, but Jet is between him and the target. Benford does not have a clear shot; Morgan does. And so he pops over the bar, bracing his arm against the countertop, and takes it.

The remaining Assembled bursts into flinders that scatter themselves across the dancefloor with an obnoxious scraping noise. The pieces twitch for a moment, then can do nothing but smoke.

Morgan and Jet are able to see what happens next. Out of the wreckage of the DJ booth, a new Assembled is constituting itself.

Morgan snaps his fingers and gestures to Benford, beckoning him back, then dives behind the table at the lounge behind the bar, bringing his shotgun to bear on the new threat.

Xin rushes towards Jet when he notices Benford and Morgan drawing a bead in that direction.

Benford moves north and sees the new opponent; he lines up the end of the shotgun with the enemy's torso and fires.

The first two Assembled went down easily, but presumably they were merely taking the measure of their foes. _This one will surely be tougher,_ thinks Morgan to himself. _Let's see how much tougher._ "Han shot first," mumbles the newsman to himself as he squeezes the trigger.

Jet drops to the floor as she senses the motions inside the guns, legs split acrobatically on the dancefloor. With a growl she punches right up into the crotch of the enemy.

The robot throws a counterpunch, which Jet has managed to duck under. Instead, with two shotgun slugs tearing through it and a fist connecting with its primary structural support, it collapses like its brethren.

Xin shouts, "Come on! We'll get weighed down by them up here. They know we're coming. To the server room!"

Benford covers Jet. "Morgan, keep moving."

Morgan sees motion at the far end of the club. "Fall back, Jet! We'll cover you!" he says, aiming his shotgun as he abandons the bar and makes for the server room.

---

The hallway is empty for the moment, except for the Exalts. Behind them, the fourth Assembled thrusts its arm through the hole in the door that Xin left, grappling for anyone in reach.

"Cameras," Benford grunts. In a smooth motion he draws his Baretta and puts two rounds into each, then stuffs the pistol back into a pocket. "Let's make that policy."

Jet looks back at the pounding door and considers the remnants of metal in her hands. She stabs a few longer pieces into the door near the hinges, trying to wedge it shut.

The hall contains a few scraps of abused furniture. Benford hauls the couch over, shaking loose a storm of stale cigarrette butts. With the door spiked and barred, perhaps the Assembled will be slowed.

Xin looks on amazed as Benford starts to haul the couch. After a moment of disbelief he starts to drag over anything else that can be used to slow things down.

Benford says, "That won't hold it for long. Let's see where these other door leads."

Xin nods, "Okay. You guys go first. I'll cover the server closet. Seems like a likely place for them to compile from."

Jet moves quickly to the one door she isn't sure of and checks. As expected, it is both locked and trapped. A few quick seconds of work from her dishonest past handles the explosive danger, and a quick display of her strength to force the lock helps her regain some lost pride after the wedging problem.

"I've wondered about that," says Morgan, taking up station beside Xin. "Nightclubs don't need massive server farms. But how many terabytes are in a soul? Maybe it's part of the system."

Benford glances over Jet's shoulder. "You've been here before, and that's not Davron's machine. Nor is it the one from Chen's memories. I'm frankly surprised that Assembled aren't swarming out of here. Maybe it's too important for them to corrupt."

The locked door leads to a set of highly improvised stairs. The stairs lead into what would otherwise be the basement of the club. Except that even now, the Exalted realize that such storage space has been expanded out. As they descend the stairs, quietly reloading their weapons and listening for new attackers, they come to appreciate the true scope of what has been built under Infrared.

The underground level is like some nightmarish alteration of a fabrication plant. The Exalts can see the same sort of technology they've seen before - the improvised bomb aboard the airplane, the 'spinner' used by Engel to craft new human organs - they were just typical examples of the machinery here.

Benford says, "This, on the other hand, looks entirely too appropriate. "

As the Celestials descend the stairs, they can see a few salient features. To their left are three columns, something akin to chemical vats, in which they can see blobs of metal that seem to pulsate with a life of their own. On a table nearby is a human-seeming figure, except that he is only a torso, a head, and one fully complete arm. Underneath the facade he is quite clearly a robot, and pieces of his body lie strewn about.

To their right seems to be what they've come for. It is a reclining chair with intricately-shaped spirals of incandescent tubing, crystals, and other stranger things surrounding it. It is connected via tubes, wires and piping to a pyramidal device which extrudes from the ceiling and seems to be humming.

Storage shelves form an impromptu corridor to the device. The shelves themselves are stacked with silvery cubes of unknown purpose.

"What is all this," asks Xin, both in awe and horror at once. He looks around, watching for assembled among the almost alien machinery.

"Just tell me what I'm not allowed to break," says Jet quietly.

And, of course, more of the creatures can be found here. There are five that the team can see, plus a glimpse of a sixth that just disappeared through a door into an office.

Morgan draws back the slide on his shotgun. "As far as I'm concerned, Jet, apart from the chair, only the laws of physics can answer that question for you."

Detecting the enemy, the Lunar immediately drops on all fours, her body growing suddenly and covering with thick fur until a very angry brown bear is what remains to be seen by the world.

The whirling of Xin's nunchaku is less impressive without the sharp whistling foleyed in, but that makes them no less dangerous. The Solar whirls around, knocking the Assembled towards the vats behind it.

The great bear rushes forward, and by now a glow surrounds it from the Lunar's liberal use of essence. For now, the beast holds back its attack to guard against the enemies that even now take aim.

Xin's impact drives the creature back against the tank he's been working with. The casing shatters and his metal body is doused with whatever chemicals were within. He, too, begins to bubble as ominously as the sample did, and with a gurgle begins to dissolve.

The other Assembled, mindful of what the substance can do, immediately change course and begin working their way around the machinery from the other side.

The great bear moves forward with a low growl, jaws moving for the throat of its enemy as the raw force of its body moves with it to drive the enemy back against the machines.

The weight of the bear slams full force behind its jaws and for a moment the assembled is thrown off its feet. A terrible roar and the sound of tearing metal ring out. Still, the enemy stands, not quite broken yet.

Benford keeps the barrel of Reason between himself and the Assembled as it advances down the hall towards him, trying to turn aside the mechanical man's blows while he lines up a shot.

It seems the Assembled here are not combat-trained - or not as much as their fellows. Even Benford's improvised defense keeps it away.

Xin races towards Benford and Poe, nunchaku whirring menacingly behind him. He rounds the corner on another of the Assembled, and kicks over part of the machine he's nearest. As oddly colored crystals and fluids tumble towards the ground, he closes, bringing his weapons to bear.

Another mechanical man is broken into parts by Xin's 'chucks, and he breaks apart as he strikes the workbench behind him.

Benford smoothly pumps the Benelli through two rounds, blasting the advancing Assembled.

The Assembled work together. It's in their nature. The only way to stand against them, Morgan realizes, is to do the same. He collects his thoughts to focus his mind, and begins shouting orders over the din of the alien foundry. "Benford, take the shot and fall back! Prepare to attack-" As Jet advances on the metal wall, he realizes what she has in mind, and adapts - another Assembled trait. "Xin! Benford's target, on my mark!" His own shotgun aims at the corridor, covering Benford's retreat, as his eyes pick out the nearest Assembled.

Benford and Morgan fall back from the advancing Assembled. Xin, kicking the shattered remains of his opponents over the workbench, charges past them to fill in the gap.

The Lunar rushes along the walls of machines as she sees her enemies race out of her reach. At the very end the great bear bursts in a flare of silver light. With the irresistable might of the Full Moons rushing through her, the great paw of the bear finds purchase on the machines and with a growl of terrible effort rips them free, swinging the whole wall.

The wall screams in protest as it is forced from the ground and sparks fill the air as metal crashes and then shatters still more machines as the entire length is swung like a great club at the assembled, burying them in twisted metal. Somewhere under that wreckage there is still movement, but those who survived the experience are not going to escape the avalanche any time soon.

The sudden change in the landscape shocks Benford, momentarily distracting him from the fight at hand. Some sound in the air tickles the neurocytes still living in his brain, the remnants of the encounter with Axel in Walla Walla. Benford recalls that the Assembled aren't just machine men; they're a driving force, the principle of mechanical organization infesting intert metal. He concentrates on the sensation as he swings the barrel of Reason towards the heap of metal, where one of the humanoid figures is still moving.

"I'm a little busy," shouts Xin, acknowledging Morgan's orders, while ducking under and inside the Assembled's reach, narrowly escaping an attack.

Xin rises gracefully from his low crouch, moving along the assembled's arm. His 'chucks come whirling up along with him, staggering the aseembled back. The motion continues, carrying Xin into the air, kicking off the wall by the stairs. He hangs in the air a moment, bringing the 'chucks back around, trying to drive the Assembled onto uneven ground, where the others can blast him more readily.

Benford gets a clear shot at Xin's opponent, only half a second long, but that's a long time for a shotgun. As the Assembled staggers back into the rubble, he pumps two more slugs into it, spraying sparks from humanoid and rubble.

"Stay focused, Xin!" calls Morgan, knowing that a martial artist hardly needs such orders, as he picks his footing amidst the twisted moorings that once held the machine that Jet threw into the far wall. "Aaaand... mark!" he calls out, squeezing the trigger of the Benelli. "Open fire! Xin, hit him hard!"

The Assembled stumbles back, a shriek of what might be pain turning into the sound of tearing metal, as the shattered remains of the monster deanimate into just another pile of alien rubble.

As the rounds left his weapon, Benford heard their song. The precision notes of geometry, the arpeggios of air resistance, a rondo of sublime physical descriptiveness. It is the music of the world. And as the remaining survivor of the symbiote factory is obliterated, Benford hears its song as well. Some part television static, some part Goa trance music, some part an indescribable noise that howls through the void between distant stars. And in that song he hears words, encrypted into the hiss of the air that vents from the devices here in the basement.

"Scientist-Epsilon destroyed," the song whispers to him. The harmonic counterpoint of the music plays in turn. "Assimiloid Taurus en route."

Xin drops to the ground, and once he's sure the immediate threat has been dealt with, turns his attentions to the others. "Everyone alright? Can we see what we've come here for?"

With the area largely covered in rubble the great bear looks around slowly, trying to pick out more enemies. Though Jet cannot speak in this form, the grumbling noises and snorting reveals her aggitation and impatience.

"I can hear something," Benford shouts. "These were just scientists... noncombat drones. Something is coming... something else." He reloads his shotgun. "One of them is hiding at the other end of this place. Let's find it and secure the chair."

"I can't hear anything," says Morgan. "Can you?" he says to Jet, following behind Benford.

Jet races towards the office, pausing to look back at Xin for a moment. A grumble as soft as a rave's bass speaker is all the communication offered before the great bruin's paws wrap around one of the metal racks and hold it up like a battering ram. The bear rushes forward, moving to make a new door for Xin to leap through.

"Didn't that Assembled in Washington inject you with something?" continues Morgan. "Axel, I think? You have a line on them, Benford. Think you can use it to find a way to stop them from coming in?"

Benford picks his way through the mess to the chair. He's never seen it before, but it's just as Doctor Chen remembered it. The Alchemicals have remolded Davron's machine to their own purposes. Benford realizes that every other human who has seen this thing is now dead... or worse. "Neurocytes," he calls back. "I heard them say an Assimiloid is coming," he adds, but the word is lost in the noise as Jet assaults the walls.

The concrete wall explodes in a showering of dust, forming a glowing silver fog in Luna's light. The bear roars its challenge, though for the moment Jet can't tell what, if anything, is ahead of her.

Behind the wall, Jet and Xin find the remaining Assembled. He is as stiff and motionless as a statue. He makes no sign, nor moves in the slightest. Even to Jet's enhanced senses, he betrays no sign of motion.

Xin leaps through the remnants of the wall, kicking out to either side as he passes over the mighty bear. The two of them cast powerful silhouettes in the silvery, dust-filled light. "It seems as though our friend here is occupied otherwise... what could he be up to..."

Morgan looks through the flying dust. "Benford! Little help here!" A motionless Assembled... making no move to attack, or even to defend itself? It must be doing something else... and Morgan thinks that a scientist's mind is needed to decipher this riddle.

Benford approaches the motionless Assembled. "I can hear it coming," he murmurs. "Maybe I can control it... or at least divert it." He closes his eyes and concentrates, the way Selber instructed him, in the van in Mexico. The light is still there, even when he can't see it. These things come to the material world by some means; maybe it's a connection that can be severed, or a pipeline that can stoppered. Maybe this last Assembled is the endpoint.

Benford steps back and brings Reason in line with the last Assembled's head. Unresponsive, but hardly unarmed. "Kill it," he grunts, and begins firing.

The last Assembled disintegrates into a pile of junk parts and odd glittering glasslike fragments, like so much of the club's basement has become. The scientist feels a twinge of guilt; up until now, everyone he's ever shot has been shooting back at him, and while the Assembled probably don't take it personally, they're close enough to human that Benford can't help but feel like a coward and a murderer. But then he remembers what was done to Chen, and the organ harvesting victims, and he blasts another slug into the rubble out of spite.

The song dims but does not silence itself. Benford suspects that he will hear it for as long as he wishes, in this sanctum of Autochthon. Whether Taurus still approaches or not isn't clear.

"Xin, Jet. Look for stragglers. Shout if you find anything," Benford calls. "I need to check out the chair. Poe, please watch the wreckage while I'm on that. I don't trust them to stay dead."

Jet looks at Newton and grumbles. Shout, he says. Still, she moves out to guard the chair as best she can while keeping most of the place in view.

Xin stalks over towards the chair, checking the rubble as he makes his way over to Benford. "Doctor, what do you suppose the chair will do?"

"On it," calls Morgan, patrolling in a slow circle around Benford. He keeps a sharp eye out in the wreckage of the machinery for signs of movement, of anything emerging from or forming itself out of the equipment. As part of his visual search pattern, he keeps an eye out for any alien technology small enough to carry.

Benford pulls a sketchpad and screwdriver out of a patch pocket. "Suck your soul out through a straw, if Ho Chen is any indication. Or allow you to carve out your person demons and put them in a jar. It amounts to the same thing, really." He runs a hand over the machine, looking for a control panel, keeping his head clear of the path between the pyramid and the recliner. "This was made in Creation, or at least the original was." He finds an access hatch goes to work.

Xin watches Benford go to work on the machine. "Careful, we don't want your soul in a jar." The Zenith tries his best to help the doctor, trying to feel for disruptions to the flow of energy, of _chi_ through the machine's conduits.

The scientist and the stuntman confer briefly, tinkering with the device. Each has his own valuable insight.

The 'chair' is a series of devices, each with their own function. The assemblage on the ceiling that connects to the chair's mechanism is the power source. The shelved cubes seem related to it, though their interior mechanism is not yet clear. They supply an enormous (for Earth) quantity of undifferentiated Essence. This magical power is then imprinted with the complex emanations of the higher soul of the subject sitting in the chair through a process Benford understands by analogy as akin to photography. The fine details of the soul are imprinted and stored, duplicated to their last detail, but the invisible structures of the soul itself, that which permits it to exist and act and participate in reincarnation, are not there.

The Essence-image is decanted into a storage device, again related to the cubes on the knocked-over shelves. It is Xin who realizes what the destination cubes store - the 'container' of a symbiote, an empty shell waiting to trap Essence and confine it. And there are further mechanisms for installing "devices" into this container, devices such as what has been called the 'Engine'. They are not truly physical things. They are constructs of magic alone, invisible to the naked eye. But like all machines, they obey strict rules of form and motion.

Benford says, "This might let us trap one of them," Benford quips.

While Benford and Xin are studying the chair, Jet and Morgan become aware of something else. The bubbly metal from the broken vat begins to pour itself out onto the floor. It pours past - and over - the half-dissolved body of the Assembled. It flows upward to engulf the work table. It spills energetically into every pore and orifice of the half-finished robot body atop the table. And the body sits bolt upright. Its parts start to gather bolt themselves to each other.

The incomplete body is still visibly assembling itself, but it moves with assurance. It snaps off a leg of the table with one hand and jams it onto the edge of its forearm. At the moment of joining, the table leg sheds about half its mass. What's left behind is a blade. The creature's featureless face bursts open into a mass of flanged and snapping tendrils.

Benford notices the new threat. "Ugh. And here comes the test subject."

"Benford, you'd better know how to do this," says Morgan. "All right! Xin, Jet, do you think you can hold that thing?" he shouts, raising his shotgun to track its progress as he backs toward the Chair. "Xin, you go left, Jet, go right. Let it come to us. Go!"

Jet feels the Engine whirr to life inside her soul. She is flooded with Essence, feeling the live-giving glow spread through her limbs. It circulates within her. It follows the flow of blood through her veins; it follows the path of the breath, from the world to her lungs and back in a mystic symbiosis. And she feels something else.

Jet experiences it for just a moment. She will never remember it, nor know its significance. The truth of the Engine overwhelms her. Its secret is simple. To grant access to Essence, it provides total clarity. And in the harsh light of ultimate realization, Jet is confronted with everything about herself. Every petty act. Every wasted opportunity. Every cutting word. Every moment of violence. Every noble deed. Every great act. Ultimate clarity is beyond her ability to tolerate, and so in that moment, the knowledge is locked away and lost. Jet knows nothing of it; now all she can feel is the surges of magical power gathering about her.

Tidal waves of Essence gather about her. And as Jet looks to her left and right, she sees shapes forming. White clouds coalesce into clearer images. Elizabeth and Natasha Ivanova flank her, smiling to her and to each other. They reach out with embracing arms and draw to her. Their cloudy figures mingle with her, forming robes of silvery light in place of her armor. And as they become as one with her, their ethereal bodies stretch forth to form a pair of angelic wings surmounting her shoulders. They sparkle and shine, the briefest vision of Celestial glory, before vanishing. Only Jet remains, wearing the garb of a god and preparing to fight.

Wreathed in divine light, the Lunar lets out her roar, and it is still booming from her when her body changes, limbs growing, claws like knives projecting from her hands and feet. Muscles ripple along her body and she looms over the enemy, standing ready to fight for her friends and for the glory of Luna.

Benford slings Reason so he can have both hands free, and pulls an empty cube out of the rubble. He tosses it onto the recliner and dives into the workings of the machine, screwdriver in one hand and penlight in the other. It's obvious to him by now that the tools are as much props as anything else. Ultimately, the force that drives the machinery of the Exalted is willpower, and the buttons and levers are no mere physical objects, but ontological facts: the user determines it will be this way or that, and the machine, according to its invisible design, obeys. The Assimiloid is the same kind of machine. Its fearsome form is just a guise for the Essence machine, which in some ways, is even more horrific. Thinking fast, even by his own standards, Benford tunes the pyramidal power source of the Chair to the ebb and flow of noise he hears in the neurocytes. _And now, Press Play,_ he mutters, like a prayer.

Xin pours his Essence into the Engine, reaching out to Sarah. Together, with the goddess that is Jet, perhaps it will be enough to contain him. The Zenith rushes towards the newly arrived creature, little more than a blur. He swings his 'chucks around the battered remnants of a column of machinery, and then whirls himself at the charging machine-thing. A desperate shout accompanies the Solar's impact.

The Full Moon warrior rushes in, heedless and fearless. Instinct tells her the danger to her pack, wolf and fox whisper in her ears. She takes aim for a moment and throws herself not through the air, but into the debris, the pile rippling along as if she were a great landshark, and as she draws close she explodes upward, casting metal upward at her enemy like shrapnel from a grenade. Essence surges around her and claws stronger than steel lash out, bones and joints bending impossibly as the Lunar tries to bind her foe in her grasp.

The two Exalted warriors swiftly realize the difficulty in corralling the bull. The assimiloid's arm is grappled. Just as swiftly, he unsockets it from his body and lashes out, kicking a flanged set of pipes with his foot expertly into the empty socket. The old arm lies inert, while the new one immediately begins to meld itself to satisfy its new purpose.

The Lunar feels her strength against the enemy, and for a moment there is a wavering, she can feel the adversary is stronger. The long tiger growls defiance, and then Xin is there, less than a heartbeat later, and the light of Sun and Moon mingle. A thousand battles race through Jet's mind, as she feels in her heart this is not the first battle, and the enemy she and Xin have snared is just another in an endless story full of supposedly untouchable foes.

"Dammit!" yells Morgan as the alien machine nearly breaks free of his allies' grasp, using its malleable nature to slip free of Jet and Xin. The divine skill of the warriors of Sun and Moon re-establish their holds as fast as they can be broken, but he can see it will be a near thing. Holding the shotgun above his head, he calls out in his mind, _Eddie! To me!_ The Caste Mark blazes out on his forehead, and his clothes burst into golden flame as his own Engine bursts into life. "Jet, Xin! Focus on holding its arms! I will shoot out its legs as they form!" And with that, Morgan opens fire, allowing the power of the Unconquered Sun to guide his aim.

Xin locks his knees around the Assimiloid's upper torso. As the creature reaches out for bits of the semi-destroyed machinery and the room that contains them, the Solar stretches out just as fast. Grabbing broken pipes and shattered consoles while they are still attaching themselves, trying to drag them back towards the center where Jet's massive strength can be put to better use in keeping it together.

The battle is far from won. Jet's body tenses, essence surging through her. Her bones themselves bow, bending as the incredible strength of Taurus is directed against her. Suddenly that resistance vanishes as limbs are shed. But Fox has hunted enemies like this before. His voice grows strongest. Jet throws herself onto her enemy fully, ignoring his legs. She throws her force at limbs swiftly, guided by Fox's whispers. Her motions are more like snake than tiger or woman, and even as Xin clings to the enemy he can feel her whole body winding impossibly betweeen him and the enemy as she draws herself tighter and tighter around him. Her feet reach to the ceiling, and that is how she will drag the enemy along.

The Benford Special blasts away, blowing away pipe-legs and sending the Assimiloid stumbling as it struggles to move forward, shedding limbs in a desperate attempt to reach the Twilight scientist. "Move it away from the wreckage! Keep it up! Benford, how's it coming?" Morgan calls, as he moves to one side, kicking a fallen girder across the room as he wheels aside, hoping to move it out of range of the thing's control.

"You're joking, right?" the scientist barks. He's shoulder deep in a wiring panel. "There's like a billion volts in this thing!" And then, the panel lights in a swirl of color. "Uh... a few seconds!"

Golden Light begins to spill from the Caste Mark on Xin's forehead. The stuntman is lit from within, his focus directed entirely towards the machine beast as it struggles with Jet and himself. He no longer settles for simply clutching at the new limbs. Now he destroys them. Every strike is made with his full force, knocking the arms to the ground as fast as they can be formed in a furious flurry of action. As he strikes he falls to the ground, legs clutching tightly at the writhing, wriggling, machined torso.

In Jet's fight for survival, to protect those she loves, a new voice whispers to her. It is Woman. To hear her own voice brings calm to the storming heart of the Full Moon, and she finds her focus. She no longer acts alone, but follows the ancient way. The enemy is persistant, but the Solars are with her. The giant Lunar scales her foe in a whirlwind of motion, massive limbs smashing away shelves and machines, scattering the limbs that Xin shatters with ease, but always she clings to the enemy, encircling him with the unmatched strength of a Full Moon.

Taurus adopts a new tactic. He splits bodily into two, both halves assimilating material around them to form complete bodies. One lunges for Benford, the other for Morgan. Jet and Xin must now contend with two physical opponents, and work alone - Morgan cannot help them unless he's willing to sacrifice either Benford or himself to focus fire.

_We're burning Essence like crazy here,_ thinks Morgan, noting the eye-defying glow around his two allies. "He's almost got it!" calls Morgan. "Just a few seconds longer!" And then Taurus splits... and Morgan grins confidently. _You don't know what you're dealing with here, do you?_ he thinks to himself. "Jet, Xin! Protect Benford! Benford, stay on task! Leave this one to me!" he calls, raising the barrel of the gun toward the ceiling and looking his own attacker in the 'face'.

Xin is thrown backwards when the bull splits in two. In a burst of golden light as bright as **noon** the Zenith launches himself from the shattered remnants of the cast aside limbs. He nearly disappears in the incandescence, but somewhere, at the center of the brightly glowing aura, is Xin, bum rushing the bull as it charges Benford.

As the enemy switches tactics, so does the Lunar. Her soul is torn for just a moment, and then Morgan's grin cuts through all doubt. She launches herself along with Xin against Taurus. She doesn't try to break the forming limbs, but instead forces her arms and legs into the vortex of their formation, so that its arms merge with her own. With a roar she pits her raw power against the assimiloid's.

Meanwhile, the other Assembled body, completely unrestrained, charges toward Morgan... and yet the onrushing Assembled doesn't seem to worry the Eclipse in the slightest, despite the fact that the monstrosity is clearly built for combat and will rip Morgan to shreds as soon as lay a claw on him. In a split second, the thing is on him - and in a flurry of golden light, Morgan's body seems to blur as he steps aside, like a matador baiting a charging bull. The Assembled, unruffled by this development, swings at Morgan in mid-charge with a vicious hooked arm, but Morgan's Essence-charged form blurs aside with ethereal grace, evading the killing blow with effortless ease.

Deciphering a machine this complex would be the work of a lifetime; Benford has had less than a minute. And in that minute he's learned more about the physics of the Symbiotes, the Assembled, the Alchemicals, than he ever knew before. They aren't just aliens or machines, they're an entirely different kingdom of life, parallel and distinct from animals, plants, and the various extremophiles... for as the principles of mechanism were woven into the refuge of Gaia by Authochton, so were the principles of biology woven into the Assembled when they came here and built this machine. And so, in the end, adapting its function from the duplication of humans to the confinement of the Assimiloid is not that difficult, it is only urgency that complicates his task. Against the epic battle of the three postmodern angels, engaged in shotgun duels and fistfights with the machine demon, Benford fights his own epic battle, pitting an Exalted mind, but still human, against its mortal foes of time and complexity.

Benford's adaption is successful insofar that Taurus - both of him - collapses into junk when he activates the improvised device. There is a loud humming and a sound like rain striking red-hot steel and steaming off it. Then there is silence.

Helpfully, the machine ejects its storage cube with a soft musical tone.

In the sudden silence, Benford gingerly picks up the cube. "It's in there."

Jet lets out a deep sigh, her eyes seeking out Morgan quickly. Seeing him in one piece is a great relief, though maybe Morgan isn't so sure, since Jet rushes over, picks him up and bearhugs him. She doesn't know what he did, but she's obviously happy he did it.

Xin pants, nearly collapsing after the fight. He pulls himself together after a moment, and curiously wonders, "Yes... but what is it? What does it do?"

"Yes," Benford murmurs to Xin. It's unclear if it's an agreement, or an answer.

Morgan breathes a sigh of relief, returning Jet's relieved hug. "It's a cube with an Assembled essence in it," he says, having followed some of Benford's explanation. "We're taking it with us." He nods to the Chair. "As well as whatever of that we can carry."

"I can carry a lot," says Jet. And it's about that time that she sets Morgan down again. Somewhere under that fur, she might even be blushing. "It might be a mess.. but I can make a special removal portal." Jet's big on home decoration.

Benford shrugs, and begins breaking the machine down. "No need, it will fit up the stairs. So let's do it and be gone from this place." The eerie music of the Assembled is faded, but not gone, and it disturbs the scientist. One challenge down, but many more await.

"Well, load me up, Newton," says Jet. "If there's a box or something to hold it in, that'd make it easier. Morgan, could you do your whole investigation stuff in their office? Maybe you can find out something to help us in there. Who knows what they've left lying around."

"I'll see what I can find," says Morgan. "I expect most of their interesting information needs a neurocyte connection and access codes, but I'll do my best. Really, the Chair and the cubes have the most obvious value."

Benford says, "Agreed. And since that's more than I thought we'd get, and we're all still alive, let's begone."

The sun is barely over the horizon to the east, burning off the early morning fog. The Exalts emerge from the front door of the Infrared, carrying strange artifacts and stinking of gunpowder and burnt metal. Schroeder and Ran pull up to the curb in Wonderland's Suburban, and the booty is discretely loaded. Benford even locks the door of the club behind them. The whole incident has taken less than fifteen minutes from the time that Jet picked the lock on the roof to the last fading echo of the shotguns and brawls.

Schroeder is waiting for them. "I think I got something out of Chen," he says to Benford as the group piles in. "Profiling's been an interest of mine, never got to do it this way before... anyway. The stuff the doctors had meant they couldn't just leave or they'd be seen as freaks, right? The Assembled _asked_ them, I think, how to learn anatomy.. they suggested Jack the Ripper style. They wanted someone to notice. They wanted someone to catch them."

"So the doctors fought back the only way they knew how," Morgan says, nodding. "Hell of a thing, to have to make a choice like that. Especially when your life is given to healing." He closes his eyes. "The doctors knew what was at stake."

"I'm guessing they were the ones who asked the robots to just pick the pedos and weirdos." Schroeder is now clearly speculating.

Benford says, "It makes sense, in retrospect. And I think Engel knew what was happening, but he couldn't change it. Not his function. Well." He motions at the Chair, packed up in whiskey crates. "It is our function. And we've done it."

Benford says, "This will probably stop those abductions, but we didn't get Snake. And their program succeeded. They can make organs. I shouldn't believe this is over."
