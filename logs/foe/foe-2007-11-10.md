# Fall of Eden 2007-11-10

June, 2008. It has been several days since the raid on Infrared. Since that time, no retribution has been forthcoming from the Alchemical Exalted. Perhaps this is only because they can't find the group; Benford's studies of Symbiogenesis machine have been in dingy, unsuitable conditions. He has been helped along by two things: two copies, one working and one not, of the machine's output; and by Junior, who has something to share with him.

The scientist understands why he was so able to immediately grasp the principles of the device and bend them to his purposes. In a prior incarnation, he himself worked with such tools. He remembers a himself as a proud, bright-eyed and white-haired gentleman, clad in robes that sparkled in the noonday sun, working on a cylindrical chamber at the center of a marble temple. The cylinder was large enough to accommodate a full-grown man and used technology quite similar to the Chair.

While the Alchemicals forked the original concept and put it to their own uses, the Solars ended up finding applications very different from either Davron's dream or that of the children of Autochthon. They found it most useful to confront a problem which had plagued Creation since the Usurpation: the dead.

The Dragon-Kings and a sorceress of the Solars had shown the way: bodies and souls could be manipulated, cautiously, and the injuries of one person could be healed by the selfless sacrifice of another. During their reign, the Deathlords and their servants, the Abyssals - those like Saint Death - had amassed a tremendous amount of soulsteel.

Soulsteel was crafted, as its name suggested, from souls.. and through the discoveries of the Dragon Kings, and the soul-manipulation technology pioneered by the savant Davron, it became possible to partially reverse the process of smelting soulsteel. The soul fragments could be released from the Magical Material and send to their final rest.

Perhaps the living Abyssal has some insight into the philosophical problem which has faced Benford - are the symbiotes true souls? Is Chen?

"So what was the problem they were trying to solve, then?" Benford asks. "Was it just freeing the trapped souls in Soulsteel? Or did they have another problem with... well, ghosts, I suppose."

"The problem was the corruption of Creation with death-tainted Essence," Junior explains. "The outcome of the Primordial War was the introduction of death to the world. Not the cessation of one life and the renewal of another through reincarnation. But the lingering, the loss, the gap, the emptiness, the.. well, the horror of death."

"Soulsteel, ghosts, Shadowlands, and even the Underworld - all these things are an affront to the gods and a danger to men. The Solars believed that they should be purified. The Abyssals, who were given right of rule over the Underworld after the fall of the Deathlords, grumbled but complied."

"Really," Benford mutters, thumbing through a pile of notes. "Solars, indeed, do not believe anything is impossible. But this introduces new wrinkles. Is the remnant of Chen a soul, the thing that Schroeder is carrying around? For that matter, what are the Symbiotes? And where did Snake get the Ivanova Sisters from? For that matter, where did the Alchemicals get Snake from? And can we put him back?"

"All good questions." Junior hums to himself in Benford's thoughts. "For one thing.. the process of death and rebirth is not some black box. It is a constructed thing, like so much else. It is.. like a machine. And it can be interfaced with by those who have the knowledge and tools."

"A machine?" Benford asks. "Oh, dear. And the Alchemicals know all about those, I expect." The scientist picks up the cube containing the Assimiloid. "And they also know all about subverting them to their own purposes."

Junior laughs. "A machine. Humans are machines too, you know. Systems through which force and motion operate in defiance of entropy. That is Autochthon's bailiwick. All the Primordials have broad, general scopes. Autochthon's is this sort of thing. Just as Cecelyne, the Endless Desert, governs all aspects of distance."

Benford says, "Yes. The distinctions are subtle, but important. You remember what He said to us? 'Become One of Them?'"

"Of course. Do you have any ideas what it means?" asks Junior.

Benford says, "Honestly, no," Benford sighs. "I've had ideas, theories, and so on. But it's one of those things. You can't understand it without being it. And so that leads to a difficult issue. Whatever Autochton meant, The Chair can make it happen. Most specifically, it can make it happen to me. And that's frightening."

"We know now that the Deathlords were Solar ghosts." Junior speaks quietly. "They became the monsters they were in order to save Creation. I'll tell you the story, if you want."

Benford says, "In a moment. You've just said something interesting."

Benford says, "Whatever happens to us - and I mean you and me, and Poe, and Jet, and Xin, and our allies - must we become monsters in order to save the world?"

Junior 'shrugs'. "If you decide you must, I guess. But monsters is such a broad word. Imagine a program to genetically engineer soldiers, maybe with animal genes. Delta Force gets its own tiger-men, like Jet. They're formidable and powerful and they save society from an invasion.. but you don't let them move into the upscale neighborhoods. You look at them with fear when they pass on the street - those times when they are traveling outside their ghettos. You take my meaning?"

Benford says, "Yes. So tell me about the Deathlords. Because if even they came back from whatever was done from them, there must be comfort and hope in that tale."

Prophecy is predestination. To see the future is to set it in place. Not because the future can be controlled by such a thing as foretelling by a hundred men. But because once you see a thing, you believe that only that thing may come about.

As the mad Solars of the First Age grew too powerful, the Sidereals gathered for the First Great Prophecy. They saw three futures. In only one of them, the world had a chance to survive. And in that future, the Solars were slain and their Sparks locked away.

One Sidereal rebelled against this vision. One of them among the Five-Score Fellowship did not think the future had to come to pass. Against all reason, this individual contacted a Circle of the least affected Solars and Lunars. He gave them a choice: give themselves over to the Neverborn, the dead remnants of the Primordials. In that act, they would remove themselves from Fate. Whatever they did could totally invalidate the Prophecy.

This Sidereal knew that they would seek to free the Solar Sparks that were to be trapped. If the reincarnated Solars could do something - anything - the world could be saved.

The Solars who became the Deathlords did so for their own reasons. Some for greed. Some for personal power. Some out of a sense of nihilism. But all, whether they knew it or not, did so for another reason. They were Solars. The world was theirs to save or to damn, but it would always be theirs.

"So there's always a way back," Benford states. "Even moreso, if you plan it that way. Well. We'll see about it soon enough. For now, we have something more immediate. Enough of doom and gloom and monsters and demons for a weekend. I want to get Poe's magic box in the wild. We need to do some memetic engineering. The new network will be our toolkit. And, since I'm still under the delusion that Democracy is a worthwhile pursuit, I see great worth in getting the mortals involved in their own salvation." The scientist grins. "This should be fun."

"This will be our platform for Operation Greenspan. The matters with the Alchemicals are of Epic, Cosmic importance. But as The Man said, whatever we do, we have to 'own' it. That's fine. We're putting out an offer of a Social Contract. Whatever people buy into it, that will be our base, our backers, our legitmacy. We won't own them. We'll own a responsibility to them, and in so doing, make our claim to act on their behalf."
