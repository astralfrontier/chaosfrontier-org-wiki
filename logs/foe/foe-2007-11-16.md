Nobody called the police that June morning when the Exalted stole the secrets of the Alchemicals' soul machine. Nobody even reported anything suspicious. At Benford's request, Barry explains what he and the others did.

"We don't have access to our usual gear," he says, "but we were still able to tap the parts of the System we retain control of. Through that we put a... well, you might say a curse on the city of San Francisco. A curse of incuriosity and timidity. People tended to fear the consequences of calling something in, so they conveniently ignored it. While that means maybe a burglar was able to rob a jewelry store in the neighborhood as well, it kept you safe. But we expended effort to do even that much. We can't hush everything up. Sooner or later people will find out about us."

Benford says, "Well, it might not take a lot of incuriosity. It's a soundproof building, after all. Although... well... with our history of demolishing them, that might not have mattered. Anyway. We have another social engineering tool in mind. A... mundane 'System', of sorts."

Benford says, "Those of you who were in Tijuana, remember what happened on the day of the Solstice, when we organized the locals? Well. What if we could do that on a national scale? I believe that Mister Morgan had an idea in that direction, yes?"

"You've all heard of the 'digital divide', I assume," says Morgan. "The gap between those who have access to the Internet and to technology, and those who do not. Well, it seems to me that we have the ability to bridge that divide. We can make some kind of simple, cheap, easy-to-use device that can give anyone who can read and write the ability to connect. And _how_ to connect - how to evaluate what they find when they get connected."

Benford says, "Originally we thought that might involve building and distributing our own devices, like the One Laptop Per Child project. There's a simpler answer, though. So many people already have cell phones, you don't even need credit or even a permanent address to have one anymore. They're also fairly powerful computers by themselves. So... we'll write a program that runs on all the popular cell phone platforms, and let it loose. That is our _how_. We also need to know what to encourage people to do with it." Benford retrieves a copy of 'The Diamond Age' from his briefcase. "I've asked a few of you to read this. I think you can see where we're going."

"Yes, I think I see... but what is it you want them to do once they have learned _how_ to connect," asks Xin. "Is there some other driving purpose to this, some... alchemy we don't yet see?"

Benford says, "Part of the plan is a teaching program, for particular ideas that we want to popularize. To prepare people for certain unusual truths, not the least of which is that they might want to elect honest politicians and use renewable energy. Honest politicians like us. Renewable energy like my reactor. That kind of thing." The scientist grins, somewhere between evilly and sheepishly. "Is it still coercion if they come up with the idea themselves?"

"And," Morgan adds, "ultimately, the fact that this world is being invaded. That is a truth this world will ultimately need to learn... but they will need to be prepared."

"Prepared," echoes Xin, "Or else, how will they defend it? I've had some ideas along those lines myself. But please, continue."

Benford frowns. "Yeah, that too. Anyway. We get Klein to work on the platform, and the rest of us work on payload. Sooner or later they'll have to make a choice like we did. They must be prepared for it."

"Have you come to understand the Chair any further," asks Xin, curiosity unchecked. "Do we know what happened to the... thing... that defended it at the last?"

Benford says, "Well, a few things. The power requirements of the Chair are huge. Even a single mote is a vast amount of energy, measured in physical terms, enough to light up a city. The Chair takes... well... a lot more. I don't know, specifically, how much yet. The assimiloid is still in its cage. I've been checking in on it every so often to make sure that it stays there. It's all based on technology and materials I've never seen before, but... I believe we can put it to use. Hel's briefing spoke of 'magical materials'. These seem to be parallel substances, but just as capable. Alchemical materials, I suppose you could call them."

Benford adds, "I'm open to suggestions as to the specific use to which they're put."

Xin says, "Alchemical materials... hmm. Perhaps we can put them to use to find other things like them. A Lands of Light detector, perhaps?"

Benford says, "Interesting notion. That might be possible. And very useful."

"Or," and here Xin's role as warrior becomes apparent. "Perhaps you can make something to disrupt their effectiveness. Either by severing their ties to the lands of light, or creating some kind of harmful effect. Give them a taste of their own medicine?"

Benford says, "I wonder about that. Maybe we could interdict other Assembled that haven't physically manifested yet, like we did with the Assimiloid. I'm not sure we can stop them completely, but we know that this world is alien to them - not just a foreign place, but one based on unusual physics. Like Chen said. They don't understand flesh. I'd love to know if there's an alternative to avoiding them besides living a rustic life in the wilderness."

"Dr. Kelton made an attempt at that without eschewing technology altogether," Morgan points out. "And he was merely mortal. We can do better than that with our superior understanding of Essence. But to ward them away from something completely..."

"Would be incredibly useful, it would give us safe zones to operate within and, if the invasion ever steps up, to offer shelter to people who cannot defend themselves against the Assembled," says Xin.

Benford says, "Barry, you said something I didn't quite understand, that your usual System doesn't operate around Infrared. That's a curious idea. I wonder if it's possible to turn the tables; use the System to interdict things coming from outside Fate. Awaken the spirit of a thing, prevent the Assembled from infesting it."

Benford thinks of Reason, in its brushed aluminum carrying case under his bed. "It happened to our shotguns, oddly enough. I was wondering if the Assembled might try to co-opt those as well."

Junior makes himself known to Benford. "Mind if I drive for a moment?" he asks.

Benford says, "Junior would like to speak. Make yourself at home, son."

Benford's body language shifts, visibly enough to the other Celestials. He gets out a few sheets of blank notepaper and a pen, clicks it with his thumb, and starts to sketch. "Here's why," says Junior, speaking through the scientist's voice.

Sketches and diagrams begin to take shape. Viking runes and elegantly curled characters reminiscent of Arabic knot themselves together with other via triple-lined connections. Numerals mix with a strange notation made up of circles within circles. Benford, watching himself write, realises he is doing so from memory.

"So basically um, there are levels of Essence. Here... and here..." He taps the first page for emphasis. "You can see the dispensation of the Incarna will override third-order energy channels. In other words, umm.. anything that takes part in the Celestial Bureaucracy will have its energy made manifest through here." Junior diagrams a 'river' of sorts that connects some of the symbols. "And I think here or here..these must be the equations that govern the Alchemical transformation."

Xin watches Junior, through Benford, start to write out strange sketches and diagrams. He stares at them in fascination, trying to decipher their meaning.

"I think that means anything with a spirit recognized by the Celestial gods or favored by them. There are sixty-seven Words that can grant this dispensation. If you are interested in stopping the Alchemicals, this is probably what you want to research." And with that, he relinquishes control.

Benford blinks. "Thank you." _I'll have more questions for you later, Junior._ "Are these Words related to the, um... the Fetiches?"

"No, they're just words of power. Not anything like a Primordial Soul."

Xin is puzzled by this revelation. "Words of power? Can anyone say these words of power, or do they need Essence behind them?"

Benford says, "Everyone has Essence. Not everyone has it to burn, like we do."

As the lecture comes to a close, Morgan observes dryly, "And this is why we're going to need a training program. To distill all that into plain English." Chuckling softly, he adds, "I'm reminded of what I was told of my own house. It apparently was consecrated to Autochthon. If we want to prevent them from materializing somewhere, we have to do something similar."

Benford says, "I would expect that, under the right circumstances, even a Mortal could do these things. They spoke of Sorcery in Creation. It doesn't happen here, but I think it could." The scientist frowns. "Not that I'm ungrateful to the Incarna, but a godless world was a lot simpler. Souls came here for mundanity. Sorcery is a tool we can't ignore, but it... it means something. Quite a hell of a lot, in fact. Not all of it good."

"In much the same way even a mortal could ward away the Assembled. It seems we shall have to discover what the something is that Sorcery here would mean," says Xin. "Especially if this is a tool we can't ignore."

Benford flips to the next page in the sketchpad. "We should be taking notes, turning this into the program. Let's get to it. We'll want everyone's input: occult matters, Jet's family values, Poe's respect for the truth. And when we're done, we'll see who takes it up."

"And not everyone has a cell phone," Morgan adds. "We still need _some_ kind of device for the very poorest. We also need to reform the educational system, so that everyone _can_ read and write, but that's going to take years. One thing at a time."

Benford says, "Cell phones for the poor aren't a problem. Americans discard over a hundred million a year. I'm sure Meyer has some ideas how to intercept those for our purposes." The scientist's grin is back; clearly there's an aspect to this work that he enjoys.

Benford says, "Of course, it's not like AT&T will be handing out free airtime, so we'll... leave them out. There's no reason that a radiotelephone can't be a peer to peer device, under the right circumstances."

"It's like they say. The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. Understanding that first step will help our cause immensely." Xin adds, after a moment, "There will be consequences for doing this. Once people realize that the world isn't as simple or mundane as they thought, there will be no turning back. They will be needing people to lead them. People to guide them. To let them know that though things may lurk in the darkness, there are many more which shall bring them the light. Our Light."

The Exalted stay up well into the night, everyone contributing ideas for what the program should include. With Twilight software engineering behind the project, data storage isn't as much an issue, even on small devices, so any information worth including _can_ be included, within reason.

As the Exalts discuss the chapter on Names, Morgan raises a hand. "That reminds me. If Names have power, then this program itself needs a name. And it should be a name that fits - that has occult significance. I open the floor to suggestions..." he begins. And then his eyes light up.

"In many older religions, particularly Native American," Morgan muses, "animal spirits are associated with natural forces. Coyote is a common trickster archetype, and so forth. Birds, in particular, are often messenger spirits, and some of them are also associated with wisdom, knowledge, and cleverness." He grins. "Add to that my nickname, and I suggest... Raven."

A sketch of a raven is added to one of the large easel-pads in the brainstorming room, and as the top sheet is torn off and laid on a conference table, Morgan refreshes the sketch. Morgan intends for it to become the mascot for the project; eventually, as he learns how, he hopes to evoke the spirit of the Raven to watch over the program. Putting its symbol at watch over the brainstorming, Morgan hopes, will be the first step in that process.
