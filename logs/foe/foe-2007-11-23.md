# Fall of Eden 2007-11-23

In the basement of the All Stars' San Francisco lair, the Exalts are preparing to interview the captured Assimiloid, Taurus. The tools at hand are the Symbiogenesis Chair, the exotic Alchemical materials, and of course, the cube holding Taurus.

Benford proceeds carefully, inviting (and encouraging) as many of his fellows to watch as possible. He refers to his notes as he connects the cube-trap to the chair's control console. Central to the page is a pencil sketch of the cube, nearly photographically perfect in detail; next to the cube, the label, 'Not to be Trusted'.

Of course, there's a missing element; the chair needs power, and mere electricity won't do it. "Essence," Benford mutters. "Everywhere and nowhere." He nudges a cable with his toe. "Taurus is still trapped, but in order to talk to him, one of us has to stick his head in this thing. And by 'one of us', of course, I mean 'me', because I wouldn't ask even a dying man to take that risk."

"What kind of Essence interfaces does it have?" asks Morgan. "I don't know much about this stuff, but there must be _some_ way that Essence gets into it. You uncoupled the power feeds when you took it away, so I assume you know which ones they are..."

Benford points up at the metallic pyramid. "It gets in that way... somehow. Pyramid power." The scientist shakes his head. "Good Lord. Next I'll be quoting von Daniken and auditing people for Thetans."

Benford says, "It draws in Essence from its environment. Which means you need something that has a lot of Essence to spare to make anything happen. At the moment, that means an Exalt." Benford points to a locked door across the room. "I've got a nuclear reactor on the other side of that door pumping out close to a megawatt of electricity and enough x-rays to bake a rhino. It barely lights the control panel. So unless anyone objects, I'm going to sit in this chair and try talking to our pet monster, and hope it doesn't eat my mind."

Morgan shakes his head. "One of us needs to pump Essence into it somehow. You're the expert here. If there were a better way for us to do it, I don't know if any of us will be any better at finding it than you." He pulls out a pocketknife, holding it over his wrist. "If there's anything else we can contribute, let us know. But I don't see any place for us to pour blood into the thing."

The chair seems strangely familiar to Benford; like an everyday object, but made of unfamiliar material... and there are few materials unfamiliar to the scientist. Some parts of the machine aren't even made of atoms, in the general sense, but only seem to become substantial when powered. "Exalts in Eden respire Essence as part of their very being, in a halo or corona that is usually invisible. We won't need to bleed, but we do need to ground that energy out somehow." Benford partially disassembles the pyramid-shaped device, moving pieces of it onto the chair itself. "I think this might do it."

Benford sits gingerly in the chair, aware of the irreplacability of the device, along with his own immortal soul. The device obligingly reclines with a soft whirr of electric motors, then... the interface program starts.

Benford is aware of another presence, not exactly malevolent, but... unpleasant. Unblinking. Alien. And it has a name, Taurus.

Benford says, "I am Benford. We have constrained because you interfered in our business. I wish you to know that otherwise, we mean you no harm. What is your purpose?"

The 'voice' that Benford hears is not human in its tone or timbre. It sounds more like an off-hook fax machine or modem spelling out words with great speed. Echoes of its speech trail off into the ambient context of Benford's mind. "DESTROY INTRUDERS. SAFEGUARD ASSETS. RETURN TO EXODUS POINT."

Benford says, "The intruders have left and the assets are gone. Your only remaining objective is to return to Exodus Point. Tell me what that is. We may oblige you."

The voice becomes a savage squeal in Benford's ears, an impotent assault. "YOU ARE AN INTRUDER." Its echoes reverberate with accusation.

Benford says, "If you want to have this argument with me, you better be prepared to explain the Alchemical presense on Earth down to the last mote. Is that your purpose? If you co-operate, I'm offering you an opportunity to serve your whole. If not, you can sit in that cube and remain... useless. Separate. Is that what you want?"

The hiss rises. "I CHOOSE CONCESSION. SPECIFY."

Benford says, "Explain your egress strategy... this 'Exodus Point'. Is it a physical phenomenon? Does it have a constant physical location?"

The voice calms. "EXPLAIN CONDITIONS OF RELEASE."

Benford says, "We will turn your cube over to custody of Doctor Engel in Los Angeles. In return, we want the organ acquisition program to get a new supervisor. One that stops murdering people. And we want the previous supervisor, who is calling himself Snake, delivered to our custody. Is this acceptable?"

"I LACK AUTHORITY TO BIND MYSELF TO THAT," the modulated noise answers. "CONCESSION IS PERMITTED. AUTHORIZE WITH ENGEL, 9527163840..." A series of numbers pours into Benford's mind. He memorizes them quickly, confident he has the sequence.

Benford says, "Tell me about Exodus Point. How do you come to Earth? How do you leave?"

A visualization spreads itself through Benford's mind. It is not a picture per se, but rather a rush of feeling and recognition that he has come to associate with Essence at work. And he indeed knows the sensation. It is the Lands of Light.

Benford says, "Of course. And this connects to your home? But then... it would have to extend beyond Earth..."

Benford says, "This isn't the whole story," Benford states. "There's guards in place. Gaia closed the way, after the Final Circle came here in our past. I assume that applies to the Lands of Light as well. We can't walk past the Kuiper Belt from the Infrared. Exodus Point is something special. Were you made within our Lands of Light, or sent from..." Benford stalls. "Outside?"

"FROM AUTOCHTHONIA."

"That figures," Benford mutters. "We will contact Engel. Do you have any other requests?"

"RETURN ANY STOLEN ASSETS," Taurus replies, coldly.

Benford says, "We'll return you. We'll take your request for the other material under advisement."

Benford discontinues the feed of Essence. The chair's systems power down, the monitors fading to grey. "Let's contact Engel, then. We need to know more about this Exodus Point. Maybe we can lock the Assembled out of Earth, or at least make it harder for them to get here."

---

Benford repeats the conversation verbatim for the others. "Something weirder than usual is going on here. However the Assembled are getting here, it's not with Gaia's consent, and they can't come directly from Autochton. When the Final Circle came here - those Solars that came here from Eden in the 30's, and yes, I know how strange that sounds - they went through some kind of Primordial desert that terminated in Egypt. Hel once told me that gateway is closed now. So something has changed." Benford can't keep the excitement from his voice. "We might be able to put a cork in the whole operation... if we can find it."

Benford heads upstairs and find the box where his Quicksilver stays most of the time, lead-lined, although Benford doesn't kid himself that the Assembled would be deterred that easily. He slips the battery in place and locates the entry for 'Axel', sending an SMS. "Ask Engel to call me. Taurus wants to go home."

Benford finishes the entry. He thumbs in sending the message. And the device rings.

"Bastards are more persistent than Inland Revenue," Benford mutters. He answers the phone. "Snake didn't show up. Someone else did." He waits for Engel to speak.

"Per our new policy I am required to report your position within half an hour of this call," says the Doctor. "Taurus gave you a confirmation code. Recite it, please."

Benford checks his watch, noting the time to the second, then recites the command code. "I hope this doesn't turn out to be a fatal mistake. I will be brief. We have Taurus. We will give him to you. We presume he is of some worth. We want some changes to the organ procurement and upgrade program in return."

"Describe the changes," Engel says, as neutrally as he can.

Benford says, "No more procurement by murder. There must be a new supervisor; Snake cannot be trusted. We want access to Snake and the abducted surgeons, and we want to make arrangements for their eventual manumission. Whatever sins they have committed, they are still human, and we have a responsibility to them." He pauses. "Independently of the Taurus matter, we object to the upgrading of professional criminals. As far as I know, your purpose is to upgrade humanity. We offer to help you find other, less antisocial subjects."

Engel pauses. "The symbiote Snake will be placed into your custody. There is one additional requirement: he must be hosted by an Exalt. It is known that you are capable of interfacing to our symbiotes. The doctors will be placed in your custody for the duration of your life. If this expires, we will reacquire custody of them. We will revise the organ acquisition standards per your request."

"One more thing. I am.. informed that you must place the Snake symbiote into the empty symbiote shell associated with his body. This body was sent to investigate the intrusion at the night-club, Infrared. The empty shell that it possessed is missing. We will transfer the symbiote into that shell."

Benford glances over at Jet. _She is not going to like this._ "Very well. We'll find someone willing to play host. What of our offer to constructively intefere in your upgrade program?"

"I will relay that suggestion. The clock is running," Engel advises.

Benford says, "Is someone going to try to kill us when it runs out? And can they be persuaded not to do so? We prefer less violent negotiations."

"Yes, and no," Engel answers concisely. "Meet me at the San Francisco laboratory, near Infrared. You met Dr. Chen there."

Benford says, "Shit. Then if we're not there in twenty-nine minutes, you'll know why." The scientist hangs up. "I owe you all an apology. Get everyone and everything into the trailer, now. We have twenty-seven minutes to evacuate the building, or fight a war. Take your pick." And then he's off like a shot to the lab.

Jet sighs, "The war is tempting." She does not linger, though; she has a family to gather, and it is some measure of her strength of spirit that there is little protest. By now, those who follow Jet are used to this sort of thing, and Cam's help makes it even easier.

Fortunately, there's not much to take. The Exalts, Jet's family, and the Symbiogenesis machine, of course; as well as the seized alchemical materials, Benford's reactor, and a few hard drives. The Sidereals assure the others that the System is more than the hardware, and more than that is not necessary. Everyone's been living out of suitcases so much lately, so there's not much to pack, anyway. In record time, a small convoy rolls out into the late dusk of a San Francisco summer night. The Wonderland truck heads to US-101 and works its way south; the beat-up suburban, with fewer occupants, rolls west towards the meeting with Engel.

Benford curses in the back seat of the Suburban. "Stupid, stupid, so fucking stupid, Newton, stupid fucking Newton Benford. Two PhDs and not a dram of common sense." He removes Reason from its crate and begins loading heavy slugs. "Stupid. Stupid. SHIT." He works the slide on the modified Benelli and completes the ride in silence, save for the grinding of his teeth.

Engel is waiting with a metallic suitcase when the Celestials pull up and park. As they pile out, once satisfied that there will be no ambush, the Doctor opens the case to reveal a peculiar and distinctly Alchemical device. It has slots for two of the storage cubes.

"Once again, I must provide notification of your position within 30 minutes of this time," Engel announces. "Please give me the Taurus device."

Benford says, "I think it goes without saying that if we're going to do business after this, we need arrangements that will not result in mortal threats to our persons." He produces the grey cube containing Taurus. "Where are the doctors?"

Engel nods across the street. "Please exercise discretion with them," he says. "As for threats.. that's not in my power to control. As I am now scheduled to be dismanted for my complicity in arranging for Snake's removal, I want to be frank with you."

Benford doesn't try to hide his shock, and is speechless for a long moment.

"If that is how they want to do business," replies Jet. "You are welcome to come with us, if you wish. You do not have to submit to your own destruction."

"For the sake of order, I choose to nevertheless." Engel smiles at each of the Exalts in turn. "My duplicity was discovered. The transfer will still continue. Whoever received the empty vessel from Snake's physical body, please step forward. We must load it with his pattern."

Jet frowns and steps forward. "That's me. Give me that piece of crap, and if he makes a squeak I'll put him through ten levels of torment beyond anything his feeble mind imagined." She looks over Engel and says, "Which is how I plan to treat your friends going forward. There is one I will suffer to let live. After this day, every one of your kind I meet, I will destroy."

Engel nods as he begins working. He attaches a pair of electrodes to Jet's forearm, then activates the device. And stops. "You have the empty vessel I prepared, but.. no transfer is possible. What did you do?"

"Perhaps the vessel has changed inside me, perhaps it has rejected him," answers Jet softly. "Or maybe Snake has fight in him that your minds are incapable of grasping."

Benford says, "There must be peace one day, Jet." The scientist shakes his head. "Engel, there's more than one order possible, and one will be found. You must know that's coming. We've seen what you can do. I know our people are not your people, but they'll forgive much for a miracle worker."

Benford says, "Wait. Engel, can you detect the Ivanova symbiotes?"

"There are no Ivanova symbiotes," says Engel flatly. "Are you referring to Natasha and Elizabeth Ivanova? They were never reimaged. Their ghosts could not be found."

"Then it seems you makers know little of your wonders. I am filled with their voices," says Jet. "Snake can find no home in me. We must take him in whatever form you have prepared and find another who might claim his spirit."

This seems to put Engel at a loss. "Then.. the conditions cannot be accepted," he says at last. "You retain Taurus. I..." He trails off, acquiring a thousand-yard stare for a moment.

Benford says, "Then... Jet holds the originals? Real ghosts?"

"It would seem so," Morgan says quietly. "Nevertheless, I..." he waits, regarding Engel, who is clearly receiving new orders, orders presumably based on the new information received.

Benford says, "Wait. Don't give up yet. We have other cubes, the other Alchemical materials..." Benford points at the strange briefcase. "This isn't the full Chair. Can it transfer the Essence images, like the chair, though? Trap things like we trapped Taurus?"

Engel comes back to himself. "This device is for tranference between vessels, yes. It can function for symbiotes or fully-realized souls." He looks up at Jet. "There is only one way for this to be resolved. Will you cooperate with me?"

"What do you need me to do?" asks Jet warily. "The only way I know how to transfer those things is by destroying one of you. Is that your great plan, Engel? Save the boys back in the chop shop a little time?"

"We will need the doctors. Go get them!" Engel now speaks with animation in his voice. "I'll do it yet." He suddenly swivels his head to focus with laser-like intensity on Benford. "You. I need you as well. We must drive to Los Angeles. I'll tell you everything on the way."

Benford doesn't even hesitate. "We do as he says."

"Then let's get moving," says Jet.

---

The Californian and Chinese doctors are hiding out. Engel has provided them sufficiently covering garments to conceal their otherwise-obvious modifications. They, and the Exalted, get into the increasingly-packed vehicle with Engel.

The Doctor's story emerges as they drive south. There is an overall director for the organ theft program - this is as high as Engel will go, specifically - who apparently has not been assigned a human name. Under him is Snake, the symbiote, and Engel himself.

It had been Snake's original idea to harvest organs from living people. "Let's do it Jack the Ripper style!" had been how he put it. The three doctors, seized from prison sentences as organ thieves anyway, were the first test subjects for the research - as Schroeder suspected, they were modified both as research material and as insurance against escape.

Benford says, "Then... when it came to Chen, was that how you studied our brain?" Benford controls his voice, but his horror at the whole thing is still there.

"Your brains are the simplest parts of you to comprehend," Engel explains. "We understand souls and interfaces to moving parts. We were able to construct an acceptable brain-proxy and link it to the nervous system, though we had to rely on Essence conduction for the first three generations. The fifth generation encapsulated the Essence-using components entirely within the physical vessel of the soul."

"Physical vessel of the soul?" asks Morgan. "The soul is a physical thing?"

Benford says, "I think he means the physical container, like the cube we used on Taurus, or Chen's sphere."

"Yes. The sphere that you saw in the cage," explains Engel. "The bridge between material and immaterial."

Benford says, "You mentioned a supervisor, someone in charge of both forks of the project. Why did he tolerate such a high-profile, ineffective harvesting mechanism?"

Engel's deceit came early. Snake's destructiveness was a detriment to the project (according to the doctor), but his presence had been mandated by something Engel refers to as a "cross-program collaborative requirement." Engel confirms that he was briefed on Jet's pre-Exaltation experience, and that the organ program was provided with Snake's soul.

"I believe that he was a contingency. We were meant to be secret. But if we were found, the continent plan would activate. When we saw who had infiltrated Infrared, the Snake clone was activated. It was meant to carry an empty vessel that one of you would link with."

Engel smiles. "Fortunately... by that time I had managed to alter the vessel. It was always my goal to get Snake into it, because I knew from Jet's history that she would want to control or destroy him."

"Destroy," corrects Jet quietly. "But I can wait a little longer for Christmas."

Benford says, "He engenders that urge in people."

"Unfortunately - or fortunately if you wish - it seems that the rising Essence levels on Gaia halted the reincarnation of the Ivanova sisters." Engel hums. "I hypothesize that they were bonded to Snake's soul. The terminology we are familiar with is a five-_yon_ fetter with Lavenderian bridges."

"Or in layman's terms," says Morgan, "by altering the vessel to contain Snake, you made it possible for it to draw the ghosts of the Ivanova sisters instead?"

"Just so," the doctor says.

"They all died the same day, and I was involved," says Jet. "A pity I have to keep killing Snake. It's wasting a lot of time."

"Ahh, well, just so," smiles Engel. "The modified vessel was designed to, hmmm, improve him. It was imprinted with the Essence of those murders, and the feelings of murderer and murdered alike. He was meant to truly experience it, before he met his final fate."

Benford says, "Alright. So where does that leave us? You need somewhere to dump Snake, and right now we don't have that vessel. I'm assuming you don't need to do anything to Taurus except let him out, which I will thank you to do when you're far the hell away from us. What about them?" He motions at the mutilated doctors. "What, exactly, are we trying to do tonight?"

"What we are trying to do is to build new bodies for the Ivanova sisters," says Engel. He tries hard to hide it, but Benford (and the others) can sense the note of pride and hopeful ambition in his voice. "Snake took away their lives. My final revenge is for them to live again."

"You better not be kidding," says Jet. "Even if you are a box of crayons in emotional terms you know how much that would mean to me."

"It will not be true life. That, it seems, is impossible. But they will exist and be as real as any other human being." Engel sounds excited now. "They will be, hmm. Golems. Free-willed, possessing living organs and living bodies. But the _po_, the under-soul, will be artificial."

Benford says, "There's only one part about this that I don't get," Benford states slowly. "What is it with you? You're not like the other Alchemicals we've met. This isn't just your symbiote telling you that revenge is the word we'll understand, for what you want to do. You crossed some line somewhere, Doctor Engel. The Alchemical nature doesn't preclude conflict, but willful rebellion... what program are you following now?"

"I'm one of the newer models. I've been put through the third generation of Alchemical transmutation. I have an artificial symbiote intermixed into my nature. I have, I guess you could say, my own personality."

"Does it really matter, Newton?" asks Jet. "He's still talking nonsense, but it sounds like he's gonna do something good for a change." She raises an eyebrow at the explanation, "Huh, so you are saying maybe I don't have to reduce your entire race to the scrap heap? That'd save me a lot of work."

"We're always changing ourselves," says Engel, smiling. "Always improving."

"Yes, but improving in what eyes? In what ways?" asks Jet. "There was a guy who wanted to make better humans that I always think of when you say that. His name was Hitler."

Morgan tilts his head. "Funny you should mention that, Jet. It seems that Engel is to be disassembled for his role in turning over Snake. I wonder... I wonder if his superiors already have some doubts about his model line, and the consequences of integrating human emotion directly."

Benford says, "I think what he's saying is, when his race comes to Gaia, they aren't the same as when they leave Autochtonia. Taurus spoke of the the Exodus Point. Junior also spoke of a Transformation. In other words... the more you adapt to Gaia's nature, the more you run the risk of falling to the weaknesses of the flesh. Chaos, ambition, anger, pride... free will."

"We are reforging ourselves to transcend our weaknesses," says Engel. "I know who Adolf Hitler is. His mistake was in the traits he regarded as weak. Free will, ambition, and so forth are not weaknesses. But an inability to escape your flaws is."

"Real growth can only come from risk," says Jet. "You take no chances, you get the nothing you deserve. Engel, you shouldn't let them destroy you. If you truly wish to improve your people."

"If I don't submit to disassembly, I threaten order. Don't you see?" The doctor confronts Jet from where he sits in the suburban, looking straight at her. "How foolish is it for one man to assert that his wisdom is greater than that of all his fellows combined, or his Maker? Isn't that hubris?"

Morgan scratches his head. "Engel has already rebelled far more than we thought Assembled to be capable of. For now... I would as soon let him do what he thinks is right... in all things. Are there others of your model line out there, Engel?"

"The primary obligation of all living things is to survive, either directly or through their offspring. You have no assurance of children, Engel. Even order itself must be threatened to grow." Jet is a free spirit, and she is not going to give up so easily.

"I've changed your opinions, even a bit, haven't I," Engel says, pressing the point and smiling with bright eyes. "I'll bring two human lives back from death. I've given hope to dying youths, even if they're in a gang that you have a history with. I've given my superiors such a series of surprises that they are evaluating our situation even as we drive. Now _you_ tell _me_ if I haven't brought about a survival of sorts. I have no genes. But I have memes - ideas, thoughts, inspirations. Haven't those been spread widely now?"

"Even for our kind, information is immortality, of a sort," Morgan agrees. "Mark Twain is remembered long after his death, both under that name and under his real name of Samuel Clemens. Even though most of us probably have no idea who his modern-day blood descendants might be, or if he even has any."

Benford says, "He is right. We will never forget any of this. The entire chronicle of the Final Circle was made available to us, down to the last porter. We're starting something here that will change the world, and Engels contributions, especially from this early stage, will be part of that story for as long as the Sun rises." Benford pauses. "But it doesn't have to end just yet. Jet offered to let you come with us. We offer you Asylum under whatever flag we have. If you can find meaning in that, you can come with us."

"Maybe so, but he would do far more alive than dead," replies Jet. "I think you are making a mistake, Engel." She sighs and shakes her head, "I have a feeling those who follow you will be as useless as Taurus. I am curious why he's so important, anyway."

"He's important because of his design. You see the best of us embody some spark, some Inspiration. The Zodiac is like that. The Assimiloids are medium-level fighters, able to overcome our military-grade Assembled units. I've watched one in simulation. I'm honestly surprised you lived."

"We have a knack for that sort of thing," replies Jet. "But why is it so much more powerful? Or is that a trade secret?"

Benford says, "Did he say medium-level?" Benford stares at Reason. "What do you do when you're in real trouble, send a uranium golem?"

"The Zodiac is powerful because the Essence of that Inspiration was forged directly into them. That's why they are unique in their way. The Assembled are just ..." Engel stops to search his memory. "Hmm. Reified computer programs? Essence designs of varying complexity, given a role and transformed into existence through energy. Commodity beings."

"We call that cannon fodder," says Jet. "But the Zodiac has more, they are.. more alive, you might say? They are strong enough." She ignores the medium-level comment. It's not pleasant to think about it.

Benford says, "Then we were right. Taurus is unique. The minor ones are cheap as AOL discs. The powerful ones cost something significant, even for a Primordial."

"Does it power also come from essence?" asks Jet. "If so, how can it get so much power? It didn't seem to be using a symbiote."

"It uses a special concentrated vessel. All Engine, no symbiote."

Benford says, "And there are twelve of them." Benford shakes his head. "And in giving him back, we've practically guaranteed that we'll be facing him again. Hubris has never caused me harm. Stupidity, however, is getting very painful. Helios help me."

"Look on the bright side. We're gonna die together if it happens," says Jet. "But I think if we beat it once without any knowledge of its existance, we'll do just fine in future engagements. But on the other hand, we'll probably be facing twelve of them."

---

At the doctor's insistence (and Benford's stubborn near-refusal), the suburban calls ahead. The Wonderland trailer is to drop off the symbiogenesis machine at the abandoned hospital where the Alchemicals have their lab.

The vehicle pulls up. The Exalted, and the doctor himself, pile out, heading into the facility. Engel, of course, knows the 'approved' entry points that Jet couldn't use, and quickly enough the basement lab is active.

"Dr. Benford, I need you in your capacity as medical expert," Engel announces. "We have twenty-eight minutes to program the spinner and bring a spare surgical harness online. We are programming two complete regimens of organs. Since we lack complete anatomical data, I will also.. er... need a body. The morgue should suffice. Ms. Williams and Mr. Morgan, will you please see to it?"

Benford points at the Spinner. "We need to program that? But it's insanely complex! I barely worked out the chair!" He breaks into a broad smile. "OK. Let's get to it."

"Wonderful, body shopping," says Jet. She looks to Morgan and says with disturbing ease, "C'mon, I hear there's a sale if we get there before the guys come to kill us."

Morgan smiles thinly. "Graverobbing. I like it already," he says, suspecting that Engel is quite advanced enough to know sarcasm when he hears it. "Yes, yes, actual graves wouldn't be fresh enough, I'm sure. Coming!"

"Very well." Engel moves to the spinner itself and begins keying in data and commands with lightning speed. "Watch closely. We will begin by creating a program for our surviving doctors' modifications. The surgical harness will perform the actual replacement. We are rolling them back to 100% biological status. This will be our dry run for the sisters..."

Benford and Engel are left alone in the lab. The Twilight has learned the basic operations of the spinner, and the "harness" that Engel refers to is a version of the 'bushbot' he himself transforms into. It's an automatic method of performing anaesthetic surgery in almost any condition, given a proper program. Of course, with bad data, it could be the most terrible instrument of torture conceivable.

"Once I get a fix on your position, I'm required to announce your position," the Alchemical says at last, once the work on the spinner is done and the machine is whirring along. "We can't leave the laboratory. What I need from you is to destroy me first. Your shotgun will suffice. You understand the need, don't you."

Benford says, "As long as you are what you are, you're forced to obey that directive. And I'm sure after today, your successors will probably be ordered to do so in thirty seconds." Benford cycles the shotgun. "As long as you are what you are. So how do we change that?"

"The only way any of my contributions will be accepted into the next generation is if I secure Taurus." Engel moves to connect the symbiogenesis chair to some conduits. "If I don't do that, this is for nothing. I must comply with the deal that was struck. Frankly I find what I'm proposing distasteful, but... perhaps it's the novelty of it that makes me want to try. Dub a copy of me before you destroy me."

Benford frowns. "A copy for them, or a copy for us? And if we load it into a new vessel, will you still be forced to give our position twice an hour?"

"A new copy for ... well, for all of you. It won't be in contact with the higher echelons so there's no security risk." Engel takes a seat. "You've seen the spinner. Once I fail to report in, they'll figure out what happened. They'll send military units here. You have to finish spinning the organs and do the work. Leave everything here, or they'll be able to trace it."

Benford says, "Do I have to leave the chair? And to be crystal clear, can we take a copy of your dub? Because without the chair, I don't know how we can reinstantiate you."

"You can take the chair.. it's the power sources they'll track, although I suppose you found a way around that.." Engel settles in and closes his eyes. "I don't have to live again. But that girl made me think that maybe there's value in just the chance of it. I leave that decision to you humans."

Benford nods. "I would consider the world a poorer place without you. When the day comes, you'll see it again." The scientist moves to the control panel. "And in any case, you have taught me much I did not expect. That's no mean feat. If you feel pride, take pride in that." He loads the container cubes and begins tapping out instructions. "Here we go."

The Symbiogenesis device does its work. In a few minutes, the transparent cube fills with a galaxy of swirling light, which then dims into a dark grey cloud. Benford picks up Reason, and aims it at Engel. "Thank you. And I'm sorry." With a single shot, Engel changes from the complex bushbot into a cloud of particles and a strange liquid, which sifts through the chair and pools on the floor. Unlike many of the other Alchemicals, the remains are not junk; Engel, clearly, was something new. Benford chokes down the lump in his throat, not of sorrow, but anger, that such things are necessary. He carefully packs away one of the two copies of Engel. "For now, anyway."

Morgan returns, helping Jet carry a canvas bag. "Sorry we're late. One of the guards on duty was too stupid to understand my cover story, and so Jet had to do the persuading..." he begins, and then trails off, looking at the puddle on the floor. "What happened, Benford? Where's Engel? I thought he was going to be helping with the... well, the procedure," he says, a worried edge to his voice.

Benford scrubs his brown with his hands. "We programmed the Spinner, and downloaded Engel into a cube. And then he..." Benford stops. "Jet," he mutters quietly. "He said that what you said to him, made him believe that the chance to live again was worth the risk. But in order to disconnect from the Alchemical whole... he had to die now." Then, in a near whisper, "Please don't make me think too much about it."

Jet raises an eyebrow and nods. "Of course." She actually smiles for a change. "I guess this whole being Chosen stuff has some value after all."

Morgan closes his eyes. "He gave himself for something beyond what he was designed to do." Moving forward with the body: "Let us make sure his sacrifice was not in vain."

The spinner itself has already started laying out batches of organs. Minor parts, all ashimmer with whatever hidden technology the Alchemicals have employed in place of prehistoric carbon. The three-dimensional loom of flesh has even regurgitated sheets of human skin, perfect even down to wrinkles and birthmarks. The surgical harness has come alive and begun its work on the anesthetized doctors. According to the readouts, they will recover consciousness in a few hours.

Benford recognizes some of what Engel fed into the spinner. Human-grade organs for the doctors, well within conventional performance limits. And he recognizes - but cannot override - what has been prepared for the Ivanova sisters. In every way they will exceed human physical traits. The spun organs that the device produces for them have a rainbow sheen on their surfaces, and radiate with their own inner light. The skin is of high quality. Jet must turn away, however, when it comes to the manufacture of their faces and eyes.

The harness begins its work. It unfolds itself around the collected organs in their antiseptic storage area, extruding a thousand fibrous fingers to do the work that no human surgeon could even imagine. Under Benford's careful observation, they piece together a pair of skeletons. Nerves, muscle tissue, synthetic cartilage, and more are wrapped around these frameworks in a dizzying dance. The machine whines and whirs, its limbs snapping this way and that with enough force to kill a man should he come too close.

The skin comes last. Its carefully-textured expanse folds itself in a protective weave around the two glistening bodies. The superficial details begin their appearance, and this time it is Jet who insists that the others look away so that some modesty can be preserved.

"They're perfect," Benford mutters. "Talk about the Uncanny Valley. This is the Uncanny Noctis Labyrinthis."

At the end of the process, Benford is ready. With Jet in the chair, he begins a process that Junior whispers to him from ancient times. The holy transference of a soul from corpus to corpus was thought the province of Solar sorcery. With Autochthon's innovations, it has become possible through technology. But there are still forms to observe, and Benford finds himself asking Poe to whisper a short prayer to the gods of the Abyss, directing them to look away as the souls slide free of their current mooring.

Two storage cubes are set ever so carefully onto the work bench, and the Exalts breathe a sigh of relief. Given the knowledge that the soul transference need not happen immediately, Benford is now faced with his most difficult challenge: initiate the entire process himself, alone and unguided, for the sake of the final victim of this facility: Ho Chen.

At last the moment is at hand. The golem bodies of Elizabeth and Natasha Ivanova, one at a time, are settled into the chair. Benford operates the controls, watching carefully and sometimes finding himself intuitively directing it to do things he doesn't consciously understand. Engel has done much of the preparation already, but it is the Twilight who must commit to the final steps.

The process is unremarkable. The golems remain apparently lifeless following the transference. They breathe, but do not move. Their eyes are closed. For now, they are quiescent. But the process was a success.

With the Ivanova sisters safely transferred into their new bodies, Snake can be transferred into Jet's symbiont shell, which Benford can't help but hope is uncomfortable for the posthuman criminal. Now, only one task remains: the organ pirates, starting with Doctor Ho Chen, deserve better than the Hell they walked into. Schroeder is summoned from outside, and very briefly introduced to Engel's lab. "Engel said they'd be sending military units once they realize what happened. So we can't take this stuff with us. But we've got one last task." He reloads the program used to build the organs for the sisters and drive the surgical harness. "So let's do this quickly."

Benford's mastery of the machine is, while not complete, still adequate for a task that beggars the mortal imagination. In a few minutes he will accomplishes what has only been attributed to miracle-workers: the restoration of life, after a fashion. And in time, Chen is also asleep and breathing, a smile on his flat and boyish features as he rests next to his colleagues.

Benford checks his watch. 26 minutes. "We need to leave. And we need to leave everything, except the Chair, and one copy of Engel. He said they track the power supplies. He also said that they won't propogate his program unless Taurus is recovered."

Jet nods to Benford and turns to grab a fire extinguisher. "You might wanna move away from that.. spinner thing. It's about to have a little accident as we get out of here."

Benford nods. "Tragic, I'm sure. Here, we'll just put the storage cubes here, out of range; and Andrew? Schroeder? If you'd help me with these gurneys, I think we need to leave Jet to make sure nothing bad happens to the Magic Cyborg Gang Member Factory."

If a tornado had formed inside the lab it could scarcely have had more effect. The Taurus cube is set with care in a metal cabinet. Everything else is smashed into a fine powder by the power of a Lunar letting loose. Someone might think she's enjoying herself. They'd be right. Jet tosses the badly scratched and dented fire extinguisher behind her and marches out to join the others. "You would never believe how clumsy I was in the lab."

And with that settled (along with the dust), the Exalts pile the new golems into the back and begin driving. Unobtrusively, without attracting attention, they begin wending their way south toward Baja, where Destiny calls them. Southern California is no longer their home. The Alchemicals are too close; their last hiding spots have been compromised. Still, there are new lives and new hopes.

In the wreckage of the lab, four men gather. Axel, Gerhard, Rod and Cam. They walk as one toward a pile of components that was once Doctor Engel, an Alchemical. The Hippocratic Oath was made for human lips to recite; it is graven in Latin on the inner curve of his metallic skull.

Axel crouches down and takes hold of one of the arms. The socket comes loose, releasing the limb to his grasp, and he begins sifting through the innards of it and comes out with four robotic actuators and a web of wiring. One by one the other men roll up their sleeves, partially dismantling their own arms.

Axel passes piece after piece around. The Alchemicals, one by one, discard a part of themselves and slide the salvaged components into place. It is a quiet, dignified act, devoid of the robotic precision they so often exhibited. "In this way do we remember him," Axel murmurs, and the others nod their heads. And after a moment they turn, leaving the lab to its fate.
