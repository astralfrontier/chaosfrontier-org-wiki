# Fall of Eden 2007-11-30

The All-Stars are closing up shop in California. When they're done, promises Meyer, there won't even be a phone booth with an 'Out of Order' sign on it that the Exalted should consider a safe hideout.

With this news, of course, comes doubts about the future of Jet's club. She makes a few calls, asking what girls she has if they're interested in a gig in Tijuana. It means a rowdier crowd and more drunken _gringos_, but it will at least be a comfortable life.

For those closest to Jet, the choice is an easy one. Naomi grins and informs Jet that she's not going to get away from them just by jumping a border. The Lunar's response is a smile and sincere words, "I wouldn't have it any other way. I will always have a place for you girls, and this time I think it will be different. I can't make many promises, but I have no intention of moving again. Whatever happens, I will keep you safe."

Amy and Michelle are pretty easy for Jet to find, though Jet has to wait a few minutes to interrupt them. The question is where they are going. Amy's answer is delivered with a wide grin, "Well, I _was_ just about to go south of the border anyway." The Lunar doesn't seem to understand it, but it is what she is, the charisma that flows from her without effort, that inspires such loyalty and love from her family. "There's nothing to worry about," assures Jet. "I'll just leave you two to uh, pack for a little while."

After finding two other girls interested in going, Jet learns something else about the club that convinces her that now is the time. Three men have been spotted on the premises lately. They weren't suspicious to the bouncers as such - they came in, paid for their drinks, stayed invisible and left. But the girls noticed. "Honey, you couldn't get those boys to stand at attention if you were the Admiral of Ass," advises one when Jet asks. "They were just... dead, you know? Cold. They weren't gay, that's for sure. They weren't anything."

Ana, Becca, and Timothy are willing to come with Jet if for no other reason than they lack real homes elsewhere. Timothy, however, has something to show Jet as they are leaving. "I've been writing my dad in prison," he says. "I've been careful, like Mr. Meyer taught me. He said he found religion and that he's okay, and that I shouldn't worry." The Colombian boy sniffs briefly. "I'm glad we're going south. They make drugs there. I have to learn more about them. You'll show me, right?"

"I will show you," says Jet. She sighs softly, "But I think you must wait a little while. It's very ugly, Timothy." She smiles and says, "I hope your father really did find religion. It's important to believe in something, to have something to shoot for. Actually, I have to show you and the others something."

Just outside Laguna Niguel Jet decides the time is right. The dark of night almost pours through the windows. The Lunar passes the wheel on to someone else so she can speak with her family. "You said you had something to show us," says Timothy bravely.

The Full Moon smiles and nods, lifting her head and looking first at her mother, then to Timothy, and finally to Laura and Angela. "Some of you have known me for some time. Some of you are just getting to know me. All of you deserve my trust and should know the truth."

"The truth is that I am no longer who I was," says Jet. "This is probably fairly obvious to everyone who has known me for a few years." Naomi and Amy both grin, and Angela gives the Lunar a curious look. "I think that words won't suit this kind of revelation. Only the revelation itself will do."

As Jet speaks, the moon slips out from behind dark clouds and silver light pours in the window. The change in her is subtle at first, growing more obvious as she draws essence to herself, so that the shiny silver in her hair is revealed, as are the tatoos that bind her caste. "I am Chosen of Luna, and I have been gifted in ways that are beyond what most could imagine."

"It all started when I nearly died in Houston," explains Jet. She realizes the others are quiet, their eyes not disbelieving. The divinity of the Celestial Exalted is a mantle that is impossible to truly hide. To those who love Jet and know her, it is only a confirmation that they do not fully understand yet. "I was visited by a goddess and changed." The Lunar would think this must sound absurd, but her honesty is more powerful than even she comprehends. "That is why I am what I am now. That is why I can do things that are simply impossible for a normal person."

"I suspected something when you came back to Houston," says Michelle. "You were different. Confident even beyond your normal." Amy smirks and notes, "You also haven't exactly concealed how much you can handle these days." Timothy and Laura talk for a moment and the voice of the young boy whispers, "That's why she's so strong."

"I wanted to tell you before, but I was afraid you wouldn't believe me, or that you would believe and want to get away from me," says the Lunar. Angela raises an eyebrow, "It's kind of hard to believe, but.. Jet. You're glowing right now."

"It does kind of make it hard to discount the story out of hand," agrees Ana. "I thought I saw a silver tiger for a moment." She looks very closely at Jet then. "What kind of things can you do?"

"Lots of things. Lift hundreds of pounds, fight kung-fu masters and win, and turn into animals," says Jet. She's almost teasing about it, and yet somehow they believe every word. The honesty of the Full Moon and her raw charisma and love for those around her are more powerful than logic and reason. Though they talk long after Laura and Timothy fall asleep in the arms of the Lunar they never doubt Jet, nor second-guess coming with her, even when they learn that it might be dangerous.

The second Chinese national, who introduces himself as Dr. Teng, and Dr. Roozrokh, the Californian who was spirited out of prison, are conscious. But Ho Chen, and the Ivanova sisters, are still unconscious. Their wholly artificial bodies seem undamaged, but the situation worries Benford.

Benford consults some notes. "So we're running a transplant ward in the back of a semi-trailer, using alien cloning technology, and deceased patients." He wads the pad up and throws it over his shoulder. "We may have made a bit of a cut and paste job out of this. So I'm going to nicely ask you fellows to tell me everything you know from your months of experience in this matter. Consider it paying back karma."

Teng and Roozrokh are happy enough to talk. In shaky tones they sum up the chamber of horrors that they endured at the hands of Snake and the Assembled. It gradually becomes clear that Engel's clinical description of the program was very much a mechanical perspective. While factually correct, Autochthon's doctor didn't experience the same visceral revulsion that the humans did.

Benford fills the doctors in on some of his experiences, but downplays his own role as an Exalt; partially to avoid adding more to the shock and trauma, but mostly because the Twilight puts a high value on modesty. "These are very strange days," he concludes. "We've found the Assembled everywhere we've gone lately. They have a plan for mankind and we - my associates and I - are trying to do something to counter it... or at least to see that human values are dominate in the world that's coming. So... we're on our way to a safe house, a place where we have some friends." He points to the comatose patients. "Help me with them, and we'll call your debt to mankind forgiven. We'll set you up with a new identity as best we can. Or..." And here the Twilight smiles, allowing himself a moment of self-assuredness. "Come with us, and you can do something more."

It has been many months since the Exalted left Tijuana in the hands of its people. Though the inspiration they provided was formidable, Morgan for one is curious to see what the population of Tijuana has made of it. He and his friends arrive quietly, with no fanfare of their own, and no intention beyond vistiting Senor Vasconcelas. If they are recognized... well, then they are recognized. There may be occasion to play the role of angels in disguise here, but it is not today.

Santiago Vasconcelos is doing well for himself, a reflection of Tijuana's upturned fortune. In his home, a young, dark-skinned Mexican girl with white teeth and a happy smile bows in polite greeting as Morgan enters. The man himself is not far behind, seizing the reporter's hand and shaking it with hearty strength. "Well, my friend, welcome back," he says with a grin.

The two men sit in the living room; the girl pours them coffee, smiles, and bounces away without a word. Santiago watches her go. "I tell people that she is my goddaughter and is a reflection of everything that's right with Tijuana, _amigo_. But I tell you this." He raises his coffee mug and gestures with it in her direction. "She was not here before you left. My friend, you brought a new life into the world. She _is_ the town."

"So she just arrived one day, from..." Morgan begins, and then blinks, as he truly _hears_ what Santiago has said. He rubs his forehead, where his Caste Mark lies. "That... well, sir, after all that has happened to us since last we met, I cannot say it is the strangest thing I have ever heard. But... it does surprise me." He glances at Benford. "Is such a thing possible?"

The scientist nods, slowly. "Some of the briefings indicated that it could happen, but... I didn't expect that it would. Especially not so soon, especially not so well. Yes, it can happen; yes, she is the city... or at least the voice of it. Um..." Benford is uncharacteristically sheepish. "We should talk to her. Tell her what we're doing here."

Morgan nods. "For that matter..." he says, turning to Santiago. "Sir, myself and my friends have come because we wish to stay for a while. You recall that we first came here because the cartels were running guns through your city?" Morgan waits for a sign of acknowledgment, then proceeds. "Well, those guns came from... our enemies. Those who my friends and I were Chosen to deal with. And right now, we need a place to gather our strength against them."

"We could tell you more of those enemies if you wish," Morgan continues. "I fear there will eventually come a time when we will tell _everyone_ about them, whether mankind wants to know about them or not - but until then, I would as soon not trouble your dreams with them unless you wish it." Morgan sighs. "Regardless... while we are here, we will certainly provide what help we can to the people of Tijuana, as suits our talents. And should our enemies find us here, we'll do our best not to bring our troubles down on your heads." He looks at Santiago. "Will Tijuana take us under her wing?"

Santiago listens, and at the end of Morgan's speech he just smiles and leans forward over his coffee cup. "_Amigo,_ this has _always_ been your home."

Morgan returns the smile and bows his head. "You are too kind."

Benford sips slowly at his coffee, hiding the emotion that comes with such a statement. After a moment, he puts down the mug and asks, "May we meet our hostess, then?"

Santiago sets his coffee cup down. The girl appears again from the other room, and walks closer to take it. The man holds up a hand; she pauses. "Esperanzita, may I present my good friends.." He gestures, naming the Exalts in turn. The girl's eyes travel from face to face, taking it all in; she never stops smiling. "And my friends, Esperanza Palma. She needed a name, and I thought to myself.. that Argentinian boy, Emilio Palma. He was the first child born on Antartica. The very first! And like him, she is the first of her kind. I know it in my heart. And so I found it fitting to give her his name. He was born in Esperanza Base. 'Hope' is a good name for such a child, I think."

"Unfortunately she does not speak yet. But she understands everything. Don't you, Esperanzita?" Santiago smiles at the child, and she bobs her head enthusiastically.

Benford can feel the child's nascent power. There is Essence awake in Tijuana, and she is the inevitable destination of that magic. Like a plant spreading its roots in fertile soil, he can quantify the power being gradually soaked up.

Benford says softly, "I think you know what we intend, m'lady. Each of us offers the other prestige and protection, as long as we are here. We ask for your complicity."

The girl frowns a moment, then dashes off. She returns a moment later, flouncing right up to Benford. With great deliberation and conviction she holds out her hand and what's in it, in solemn offering. It's a chocolate chip cookie.

Benford grins, and accepts the cookie. "Thank you. So it shall be."

Tijuana's medical community does not have a sterling reputation. On the other hand, the health care system has an attractive simplicity for American tourists: you pay the doctor, and he does what you want. The transactions are more expedient without top-heavy insurance networks, extensive buearacracies, or the FDA. Of course... sometimes you get what you pay for.

And other times, you get a Solar Twilight and his allies. In return for the loan of a first-class operating room in a cosmetic surgery boutique, Vasconcelas has agreed to arrange for the most needy patients to consult with Benford. There are fewer patients than there used to be; things are looking up in Tijuana lately. But then, there are always more, some even coming from America with uninsured children.

The Exalts arrange three tables. One for Chen, and two for the twins, all kept rigidly partitioned from the rest of the surgery. Based on some preliminary findings and good guesswork, Benford is confident that minor tweaks are all that'll be required for the three patients' internal organs to be fully harmonized. Unfortunately he's not 100% sure yet which tweaks are called for.

Through experimentation, the physicist comes upon a new capability of the symbiotes' vessels - or perhaps just a capability that had previously gone unnoticed. In a fashion similar to his earlier 'dives', Benford meditates. Hypatia guides him within the confines of himself, revealing to him something which calls itself the "Contrite Diagnostic Experience". If the symbiotes are ultimately a machine constructed out of magic, then the CDE is nothing more than the instrument panel and gauges for that machine.

"Interesting," Benford remarks. "Quite thoroughly self-instrumented, and all accesible to the user. Our meat bodies could use something like this... hmm." He continues with the meditation, searching for the fault in his patients' systems.

Benford finds a way to connect to the artificial _po_, or lower soul, of Dr. Chen. On the theory that all three bodies will have near-identical defects, he focuses his efforts on the most 'ordinary' body of the trio.

Benford remembers what he said to Chen, when he was reconstructing the doctor's damaged psyche. _Good Lord,_ Benford realizes. That was less than a week ago. The doctor's own will to live, and to serve his patients, may make this easier. "Doctor Ho Chen," he murmurs. "You are returning. Just a little further now. Meet me halfway."

Chen's mind is still scrambled eggs, but his body is in more manageable shape. Benford is confident that this alone won't bring him to consciousness. On the other hand, it also means there's no need for anaesthetic.

The scientist finds fault lines in some of the organs. The bodies are being kept in something akin to suspended animation, and the _po_ would not rouse itself without this correction. If they underwent any sort of normal motion such as walking, they would develop internal bleeding. Further, there are design issues in the gastrointestinal tract and in the lymphatic system. The bodies themselves cannot simply repair the damage. Benford will have to operate.

The Twilight rouses himself to find that someone has placed a plate with a single cookie on it by each of the three beds. The surgical implements are ready. The most straightforward approach is a limited tissue transplant, and Benford remembers that Exalts regenerate from anything short of actual amputation.

Benford fetches Teng and Roozrokh, who are swaddled in aseptic surgical gear; partially as operatory prep, and partially to hide the last vestiges of their abuse at the hands of Engel. Benford carefully explains the procedure to the two doctors, who are obviously uneasy with the idea; but Benford offers his reassurances. "We've had an upgrade of our own. A powerful one. A simple graft donation won't hurt us for long. Just don't make a mess of things on purpose; today is weird enough already."

Benford takes preliminary biopsies from Jet, Poe, Xin, and himself. The pain is not quite excrutiating, but Benford is very glad that the whiskey, stolen from the Infrared as an afterthought, awaits his attention later. It will make recovery less unpleasant. With tissue samples obtained and matches performed to the still-slumbering doctors, and the Ivanova sisters, they are ready to begin. Chen will be first. He is hardly disposable; but he is also, in his confused state, the least likely to be hurt.

As it turns out, the rapid reconstruction of the four was with 'type O' organs and a heavy amount of interpolation by the Spinner. "Good," Benford says. "These new bodies are 'universal receivers', of a type. Little chance of tissue rejection from any of us. Andrew, I ask you to be the donor for Chen and Teng. I have to be awake to perform the surgery on both of you. If all goes well for him, then we'll repeat the process for the Ivanova sisters. I assume Jet will insist on being the donor." He sighs. "I'm going to scrub up. Let's do this as quickly as possible. In my head, I know this is no kind of problem for a Solar Twilight. But in my heart... I've been through too much with you fellows to ever be comfortable risking your lives like this."

With Junior's guidance, Benford witnesses a thousand operations performed before, always with his hands. The face may change and the motives may differ, but the knowledge of anatomy and medicine that lies locked in the scientist's mind spans generations of human lifetimes. Benford can feel the edges of that supernal talent as he operates now. Even the blood and sinew of the Exalted far surpasses mundane humanity; perhaps, the Twilight thinks, _anyone_ could receive a transplant of it and do well. The knife moves swiftly and deliberately. No useless incisions are made. No unnecessary blood is lost. He charts a path to his objectives and executes his plan.

Chen is bandaged up and put under observation. The other abducted doctors require far less attention; their transplants, done in Los Angeles, hold up almost perfectly now. It is now only the Ivanova sisters that need attention.

The pair are physically identical, except for their faces, and even those differ only slightly. The bodies are not a true genetic copy, it seems, but rather a best effort on the part of Engel. Still, the anatomical similarity is to Benford's advantage. He finds himself able to operate on both simultaneously, directing incisions with a marvelous ambidexterity and guiding two hands with a single plan of surgery. Jet is unconscious and recuperating, but a word from him will wake her. For now her contribution has been made, and the Moon's power made flesh replaces the imperfections of the Alchemical spinner.

Hours pass. The three patients under observation have responded to treatment, and Benford is rested up. He sits, drinking bottled water in one corner of the surgical theater, when he finds a gentle tug on his sleeve. It's Esperanzita, and she's holding out a cookie for him with wide eyes.

Benford takes the cookie from Esperanzita, smiling. "You made these for us - one per patient. Should we give these to them, you think?"

In answer, the girl points at the three plates already prepared.

Benford nods, and rises. "Of course. I understand now. Thank you."

Again the girl tugs on Benford's sleeve. She pulls at it with what minor strength she can muster, seeming to want him to follow her.

Benford raises an eyebrow, but follows the girl. A request for attention from a Goddess, even a very minor one, is not to be ignored.

Esperanzita leads the way out onto the street. She guides Benford around the corner and toward a two-story apartment building. Sitting on the steps is a girl, perhaps 8 or 9 years old. She sees the little god coming and waves; Benford can see that she's got a ragdoll, and its head is almost torn off. The teeth marks of a dog are evident. Esperanzita accepts the doll as the girl holds it out, and in turn she presents it to Benford, looking hopeful.

Benford smiles, and accepts the doll. "Yes," he says softly. "It's important that we do something about this, as well." And with a needle from the surgery, and the thread of the doll itself, he goes to work again, grateful that such innocence has its place, even in his world.

---

Jet finds herself waking up. She hears vague voices. In her, the animal gods are whispering. They know that family is near, but they feel also that there is something unnatural to it. Still, they trust the most powerful god within their pantheon: Jet's soul. And she knows the twins are conscious.

Jet silences the sound of the wolf and fox, of the bird and bear. She rises and lets out a soft sigh. Nothing is natural these days anyway. She looks herself over for just a moment, making sure that everything is where she left it, and gets up, her attention focused on the friends she thought lost forever. The deep philosophical questions don't occur to her at the moment. For now, it is enough that some part of two people she loved dearly may have been returned to her beyond all hope.

The girls are getting up from their beds. Jet watches them feel at their bodies experimentally. With a sick feeling she watches where their hands go; they are probing, perhaps unconsciously, perhaps not, at the very spots where they were shot. But the moment passes, and they shake their heads. One looks to the other, and they become aware of Jet, looking at her as well. Blank incomprehension shows on their faces.

Jet moves closer to them, not showing the hesitation and doubt that she feels. "Do you feel okay?" she asks softly. Her eyes inspect their bodies as well, making sure everything appears right, even if things feel so strange.

"You shot me," whispers Natasha, staring at Jet sounding confused. "You shot _me_," answers Elizabeth. Natasha turns, and the girls lock eyes for long, tense moments. Then they look back at Jet, almost as one. "So.... what now?" Elizabeth asks. "Are we dead?"

"We move on," says Jet confidently. "We start over." She moves closer, offering her hands. "We are all alive, as far as I can tell. I figure if I get to come back from the dead you two deserve a shot too, right? The choice is yours, but I think for a while, you are gonna need help getting back on your feet. The world's a lot more screwed-up now than it was a year or two ago."

"I don't need help getting up," Natasha grunts. She takes hold of the bed, gripping tightly to lift herself to a sitting position. And in her grip, the metal railing groans in protest. Abruptly she lets go. Jet can see what she left behind: an imprint of her hand in the crushed railing. The girl lays back, staring at her hand in shock.

"Things aren't exactly as you remember them," notes Jet softly. "I've changed and you've changed. This isn't about physical strength, it's about something more powerful." The Lunar normally wouldn't leave herself this open, but what was done to the twins was ultimately unfair in many ways. Unfair in death, unfair in undoing that injustice. "We loved each other once. That was our real power. We forgot that love in drugs and vengeance. Do you really want to fall apart like that again?"

"Where are we?" asks Elizabeth quietly. She's noticed the cookie plate and picks it up, turning it around experimentally.

"We're in Tijuana," replies Jet. "And try the cookie, it might make you feel better." Jet would like about ten stout drinks at this point, herself. "You both were dead, and through a process I can't begin to understand you aren't now. You've changed physically, as you can tell. This isn't the same body you left behind."

"They're golems," says a voice. The girls and Jet turn, but Jet knows the voice already. It's the Man. He, too, has a cookie in his hand, and he waves it at Jet. "You guys have really got to control that girl."

"I don't like the word 'control' very much," says Jet. "But she is a child, and needs guidance." She looks over to the twins. "I don't know if I am fond of the word golem, either. But I don't think you are lying." The Lunar studies the Man closely, "I didn't expect you to pop in. It's never casual. What can I do for you?"

"I'm here mostly for them," the Sidereal says, pointing at the Ivanova sisters. "They're going to be very strong and very fast. They're going to need to be careful." He stares from girl to girl. "You guys hear me, right? Now get up. _Slowly_." The girls comply, displaying obvious caution. Even so they get out of their beds faster than expected, wobbling about on new feet before finding their balance.

"Can you help them get used to this?" asks Jet. She doesn't mean just the speed and strength. That's the easy part, as far as the Lunar is concerned. Jet wants to help them, but having had her offer scorned once keeps her from doing so again.

"I felt them awhile back, and far away," the Man continues. "Jet.. you need to tell them everything. They need to be prepared. They'll have to fight. There's something I can teach them, something very old, that might help. But that'll come later. Let's get them walking first."

"I will tell them all I know," says Jet. "They have to fight?" She obviously doesn't want them to. "It's a very long story, and I can't claim to understand much of what is happening these days."

Jet casts the 'full story' as well as she can. She begins quickly explaining the years after the twins died, leading to her own exaltation. The assembled are described in as much detail as Jet can manage. The Lunar explains the assembled forces as something of a gang invasion, a new group trying to dominate the world. The language is not gentle, and the Lunar makes no efforts to sugar coat anything.

The girls are naturally pretty shocked, but both manage to digest it at their own pace. Some of it seems familiar to them already. Their time as ghosts, bonded to Jet, is a hazy memory at best. At the end of the story they are sitting upright on their beds, looking intent.

The Man smiles. "Alright. Start training. When we're ready, I'm going to start teaching the _Varma Ati_ and the _Varma Kalai_. Xin will probably be interested as well." He turns to leave, but stops, placing his hand on Jet's shoulder. "There is a greater design playing itself out here," he whispers, leaning close. "I wish I could show you how beautiful it really is. But they're as much a part of it as you are."

Jet smiles at the Man, raising a hand to touch his. "Thank you. For everything. Thank you. We will all work together to make it beautiful."
