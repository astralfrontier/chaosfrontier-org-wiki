# Fall of Eden 2007-12-14

Benford is asleep in his Tijuana apartment. The celebration of fusion power somehow got beyond his control, and the exhaustion of the affair has taken its toll on him. He knew, ultimately, that it couldn't be kept a secret - too many people were involved, and the Terran Deliberative has not made a habit of mind control.

He finds himself regaining consciousness. He feels for the time; 3:58 a.m. He opens his eyes, blinking against an unexpected glare. In the corner of the room, he can see that electric lamps of various sizes and heights have been carefully arranged. The power cords plug into an electrician's nightmare; it's surprising that they are all fully lit. In the center of the ring of lights is Esperanzita. She's wearing an angel costume fit for Halloween: a golden halo balanced on a wire looped around her brow, and paper-thin white wings. In her hands she holds an envelope and a Bible, and she's staring at an illustration in the holy text with a look of intense concentration.

Benford props himself on an elbow, fumbling for a bathrobe. The only part that he finds bizzare is that Esperanzita waited until the middle of the night. "You have a flair for the dramatic, my lady." He pulls the robe on, embarrased to be caught in an undignified state. "How may I be of service?" He casts a curious glance at the bible, blinking against the bleaching light.

The illustration is of an angel, appearing in a dream-vision to a surprised-looking patriarch. The girl seems to be distressed when she notices Benford up and moving around. Quickly she starts humming; Benford recognizes it as a local lullabye, and her pleading eyes watch him move.

Benford chuckles, and slips back into bed. "Very well, then." _The poor kid. Who ever knew that being a Goddess, a bona fide Goddess, would be so taxing for her?_

Satisfied, Esperanzita trots over and deposits the envelope on Benford's chest, along with a cookie. This job done, she dashes off.

The letter itself is rather more prosaic. It's dated from yesterday, written by Santiago. It rather gracefully thanks the Solar for his efforts and promises that Tijuana will be grateful, and not waste the gift of prosperity. What gets Benford's attention is the small note appended after the Mexican's signature. In terse, easy-to-read letters it says "P.S. Attend to Klein personally - you are needed in Europe to make Raven succeed. P.P.S. Watch for crumbs."

Benford discretely turns off a few of Esperanzita's lights - at least, the ones that are starting to smell of burning insulation - and takes a seat among them. He looks a good deal like a shorter, tweedier Arthur Dent, in a dressing gown and pajamas, puzzling over the letter. "Attend to Klein personally... and now I recall that we don't even know where he lives." He half-expects The Man to walk out of his pantry; or possibly Rod Serling.

Nevertheless, after a few minutes, he gets up and starts packing. Odds are good that everyone will be at the powerplant soon; he'll see who feels like a trip to Europe. Contrary to popular belief, CERN doesn't shuttle its top physicists around in rocketplanes; and that means that the Deliberative will have to deal with airlines again. Benford won't admit to fear; but just as much, he doesn't think going alone is wise.

As he leaves the apartment building, he tosses off an SMS to Klein on the secure phones. _Someone wants us colocated. And CERN will want me on the carpet anyway._ He leaves it at that.

A reply message doesn't take too long to arrive. _Enjoy Geneva._

Early that morning, Benford gathers the usual suspects in the old wardroom at the powerplant. He leaves the letter on the table. "It came to me in a dream," he says simply. "And I'm guessing the annotations were from someone we shouldn't ignore. Klein is in Europe; I have to go to CERN and do some explaining anyway. But... last time we were on a transoceanic flight, they tried to kill us. So I'm inviting whoever wants to go." After a pause, he adds, "Geneva's not bad in summer."

Luther Blissett and the Man are both present, talking quietly. "We're both going," Luther says at last. "The All-Stars will be sufficient to keep things under control here." This wins no points from the other Sidereals, by the look of it, but nothing further is said.

Benford notices the whiff of disapproval, and quips, "Timothy could understand my notes. Just make sure it's OK with his mom."

"If a lot of us Exalts travel by commercial air, that just makes us a juicier target for the Assembled," Morgan observes. "Either travel by other means, or take precautions we did not know to take before."

Jet raises an eyebrow, "I think I have found something close to what I need here, so unless you think you will need me in Geneva, my family and I will be staying." She looks to the Sidereals curiously, "Besides, I don't think things will be held together without extra muscle here."

The Man laughs. Luther speaks up. "Doctor, I think at this point we can consider the System's assistance in falsifying travel documents to be compromised. I've been analyzing the situation. There simply was no mundane vector for intelligence on your initial arrival here, ergo the vector was astrological. If you are able to obtain visas and identity papers mundanely, I strongly suggest doing so."

"I think we can come by decent fakes," says Jet. "It probably won't even take very long to manage it."

Benford bites his tongue. Complicity in felonies disturbs him; but then, at one time, it actually scared him. So what's a man to do?

Morgan has fewer qualms than his scientist colleague. Perhaps it's just his memories of his college days, when he'd forged fake IDs for himself and his dorm-mates to buy beer, or maybe _that_ episode was just a precursor of things to come, but Morgan's always had a bit of a knack for falsifying IDs. Of course, at this point, he's going to have to fool people with a slightly keener eye than a bar bouncer.

Still, Morgan isn't too worried. This _is_ Tijuana, after all, and there's a burgeoning market in falsified American identity papers. All he has to do is... improve upon them, using his own innate talents. It is easy enough to get a convincing blank passport book - though not necessarily cheap to get one with the right weight, grade, and texture of paper and cover. Somewhat trickier is the textured laminate with the seal of the US Customs Office, but in the end that's just a matter of careful artwork and reference to a legitimate original.

"The hard part," Morgan says to Benford, "is going to be the bar code. If they scan that, it's either going to come up without a match or come up as Joe Schmoe from Peoria - or worse, Jane Schmoe. Long-term, we're going to need to hack into the DHS computers and insert some records manually, but for now I'll probably just have to deliberately spoil the barcode. We'll rumple the whole thing to match, and if they try to scan it, you'll just have to tell them that the thing never worked right."

Benford says, "If one of our objectives is to meet Klein, I'm sure he'd have more than a few ideas in that regard."

The good news is that Amtrak doesn't require anything more than a driver's license to board. The bad news is that means that Morgan and Benford have to wait until three days later to find out how well Morgan's forged passports work at the New York harbor to board a cargo ship to Europe, and Morgan is almost disappointed when the customs agent merely glances at the passports before waving them through.

"They don't seem to care when you're leaving," Benford says later, when New York's smog line has receded in the distances. "Be grateful. There are few people who welcome boredom more than an illegal traveller."

The Man, Luther, Morgan and Benford have departed Tijuana. Ricky has begun to organize some of the local rednecks and ex-dopers into a semi-coherent militia controlled principally through agreements with the local bars.

Barry, Mary and Meyer seem to be having an ongoing discussion, and the morning after the others leave, they invite Jet to join them.

"We're thinking of splitting up, going our separate ways," Barry explains when the Lunar arrives. "Meyer is going to stay here and facilitate Greenspan. The American economy is teetering. We wanted to keep it going, and really to revitalize the rest of the continent along with it. There's been a lot of chaos in the markets. He's definitely the man for the job. Mary and I, well... we're more facilitators of _your_ needs, and right now it's not so clear to us that we have a direction to go."

Barry laces his fingers together and leans back against the meeting room's table. He looks up Jet slowly, eyes carefully neutral as they study the Lunar. "I believe that Timothy is important. I agree with that guy, too - your resurrected friends are important. I think you should find out whatever you can about his family. He wasn't brought across your path for no reason. Of that I'm sure."

Jet snickers at Barry. "Considering how you arranged the very meeting with Timothy I'm not entirely sure your judgement in this is free from bias." She sits up and frowns, turning serious. "Still, I should find out how the kid came to be in a bad situation. I don't know if he has a family out there that is worth knowing or not. Maybe I should figure that out."

"If I had as much volition in my own actions as you do, I'd agree." Barry's tone is entirely sympathetic. "Your instincts speak to you and you act. My prescience is similar. All I ask is that you learn his history and family. He's tied to the drug trade here in some fashion, after all."

"I will do this, though you are being horribly vague, which seems your curse," says Jet. She sighs quietly and says, "I will do this, but I need help from you, as well. I have something I need to do. A penance, perhaps, or mere vanity. I'm not even sure what you can do. I have an idea to destroy the drug trade, but I don't have the skill to make it real."

Barry smiles. "We're at your disposal."

"I need to find someone who can make me a drug to destroy all other drugs," says Jet. "Something that can actually purify the body of a junkie, removing addiction and maybe even reverse the damage that has been done. It still has to have appeal, but not one that wipe the mind with irrational joy."

Barry thinks about this. "That sounds rather impressive. Something magical could certainly do it, but .. we can't really manufacture that in quantity. What you ask is honestly beyond conventional biology as I understand it. I know some doctors that have studied pathology and addiction, and I can ask questions."

"The other alternative is a bit more devious," says Jet. "If we could make a drug that causes other popular drugs to fail, or to be unpleasant enough to help break addiction another way." The Lunar remains focused. "This is the only realistic way to shatter the power of organizations like MS-13. We have to take away the money."

"I think you may find your answer faster with Timothy than we will," murmurs Barry. It's in a voice Jet has come to recognize - the man is an unpredictable oracle, like all his kind, and something has come to him from the currents of destiny.

"Then I must chase the sad trails of his past," says Jet softly. "I smell pain in the air, and death." She rises and asks, "Is there anything else? If not, I'll start digging."

"Yes. You won't like it." Barry's tone is calm - deliberately neutral, almost cold. "You will probably find Snake useful for this. And may I talk to you for a moment, privately?"

"If Snake is useful, I know I won't like it. I still want to get rid of him," says Jet. She steps away from the others, "And yes, let's take a walk."

Out on the street, Barry seems more relaxed. "Each of us have pasts we don't like," he says as the two stroll down an otherwise-empty stretch of street. "Each of us has a future we can't see. We have tremendous power and little guidance, so we tend to make our own way in the world. And I feel that I'm being called away from all this, that it'll be my time to move on soon. I want us all to be at peace with each other when I go."

"Called away?" asks Jet quietly. She doesn't like the sound of it. Even if death and life are party of her reality, it doesn't sit well with her. "We all will have our times to come and go, I suppose. Even we aren't spared that."

The Sidereal chuckles. "Chosen of Endings. Of all endings. Death is one. A transition to a new position is another." He gestures with his hands, illustrating a path. "Journeys. Travel, migration, gradual motion. Battles. The conflicts that we face on that road. Serenity. The hope we find at the end and the happiness we find on the way. Secrets. The things we don't yet know, the road untraveled, the hidden mystery at the end of our road. Endings. When we arrive, and find that we must set off again. That's the destiny of everyone in the world. Timothy is on that journey too, isn't he."

"Of course," says Jet. "We all are on that journey in one way or another. I do not think you can have a path without a destination, even if you don't know it yourself."

"What I find interesting is that many journeys have converged on you," continues Barry. "I don't think it's an accident that all these people have found you - even those who knew you before. But they can't simply stop their journeys and stay safe. From dangers physical or otherwise. They have to keep moving. And I hope you will help each one of them, in the way they need it most."

"So you think I have to touch them briefly and then just send them on?" asks Jet. She doesn't like that, obviously, but she doesn't lash out yet. "I've said my share of goodbyes. This could be my first shot at anything even vaguely resembling a real family."

Barry shakes his head. "It need not always be brief. It just can't be forever. I trust your instincts to recognize when they need to find a new way. And yes, that way might be at your side, in a new capacity. I trust your instincts to know. What I want to know is, can I trust your heart to be willing to do it when the time comes?"

"I will do what is best for them," says Jet. "I am so used to the pain of losing those I love that I will honestly expect it before long, Barry. It was too much to hope that something like forever would really exist." She lets out a soft sigh and murmurs, "So I guess they are my tadpoles dancing on the thumbnail of the moon, and it falls to me to help them take strange wing."

"There's a story that my avatar related to me," the Vizier says, apparently seguing into a new topic. "It concerned two ancient heroes of Creation, who saved the world. She was a warrior, and he was an explorer. But her battles consumed her at last, and she died for the sake of Creation. And his need for knowledge consumed him, until he was transformed by the magic he'd used for the sake of Creation. They couldn't be together in life. But after their transitions, she became a goddess of living and growing things. And he, having become the Tree of Knowledge, was under her purview. They were together for all time, even if they had separated once." Barry smiles. "It's an interesting fable - I think - but it says that friends parted can be reunited in strange circumstances. Trust to that when you say your goodbyes."

"I have a much harder time trusting fate than you do, Barry," admits Jet. "I hate to leave anything in the hands of others when mine might carry the weight instead. I am a warrior, but I am not a hero. I have the strength, but I fear that I lack the judgement to be worthy of it." The Lunar smiles as she adds, "Still, I have been given this power for a reason, so I must do what I think is best. In this way, I trust fate as much as I can, and though I am not entirely willing, I must trust myself, as well."

Barry nods approvingly, and grins. "Then I have no doubts in you."

With something of an open-ended project to deal with, Jet needs a beginning to make up for her lack of a set ending. She knows a few people who can help her, and the easiest to ask for help is Ricky. She needs him to find out who Timothy's real father is, if possible, and his real mother, as well. Hopefully the name of a city will be forthcoming, too.

The more Jet learns, the more she finds Timothy's unusual position to be normal for him. The adoption paperwork she receives list his parents as Raulo Lecuona and Isabella Lecuona nee Saenz. "Timothy Leary", then, was born Jesus Manuelo Lecuona. The drug reference his adoptive father chose for him was a bit much.

Raulo was himself heavily involved in a movement called Sophrology, begun in the 1960s by Dr. Alfonso Caycedo, a Colombian neuro-psychiatrist. The Sophrocay International is still open in Andorra, Barcelona, and Bogota. The movement was inspired by yogic practices and meant to study consciousness.

Other offices are open in London, Geneva, France, Italy, and Switzerland. The movement aims to "promote collective awareness towards a better society", and Jet recalls the experiments at Walla Walla.

The Lecuonas dropped out several years ago - they didn't even sign the adoption paperwork themselves, curiously. Finding them could be a challenge, and not one that can be done remotely. Given this, Jet decides that a trip to Colombia is in order.

The trip into South America is never a safe one, and so Jet decides to do so under the radar, using the pathways that are usually favored by drug dealers. These routes have shifted considerably due to the changes in Tijuana, but for one like Jet they are still an easy trail to follow.

Located in the very heart of Columbia, Bogota is a city that stands out strangely from the images most associate with Columbia. Here the visions of men wandering jungle pathways with loads of drugs seems as distant as the past which gave the city it's first name. Jet loses herself quickly in the city, though her purpose is clear enough. She needs to find the cold trail that will hopefully lead her to Timothy's parents.

What Jet actually discovers, after a night of burglary and translation from Spanish, is that the Lecuonas have been dead for almost four years. The adoption paperwork, technically, happened before they were pronounced dead - hours before. Jet suspects that forgery, or at least a steady supply of bribes, are responsible.

There are no police records to speak of. Across the mountains from Bogota, the distant cartel complexes stretched forth their hand - that much is clear. Arrests were made of a breakaway group of ex-Sophrologists, including Raulo, but no charges were filed and no jail terms were served.

It seems that Timothy's life has been touched by drugs for much, much longer than Jet's history with him. Perhaps one of the surviving splinter members can say more.
