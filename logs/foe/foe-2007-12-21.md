# Fall of Eden 2007-12-21

A woman named Haley married, becoming Haley van Heusen. She had three children, one of which attended to her mother's belongings and articles after her death at the ripe old age of 80. Now Haley's granddaughter Windy van Heusen has inherited the odd collection of otherworldly writings and queer trappings of the occult. She is quite easy to find by a trivial search of the papers - London's publications have a distinguished history and are justifiably proud of it.

In this modern age, Windy is easy enough to find. She has an e-mail address and a mobile phone, and a slight reputation as a speaker on linguistic topics. She has shown an adeptness for language and is even published.

Opting for the direct approach (for once), Newton has announced his credentials as a scientist and fellow Briton, and arranged to examine her collection. Now Poe and Benford are approaching the old van Housen brownstone on Hyde Park.

The younger Doctor van Housen leads the two visitors to a cramped, cobbled basement, populated with dozens of shelves and hundreds of boxes.

Amongst the stacks and piles, Benford encounters extensive grammars and vocabularies for two languages that are unknown to Gaia; they are identified as "Riverspeak" and "Old Realm", which Murrow confirms as languages of Creation, and indeed the latter he describes as the language of the gods.

Near these are collections of diaries which appear to document accounts of everyday life in Creation. And most significantly, an account of the arrival of four Exalts - Davron, Chi-Yosh, Gallius, and Ramar - and their brief but eventful activites there. Included are handwriting samples of the four - Junior, Thompson, and Murrow, of course, still refuse to comment on whether the handwriting belongs to holders of Morgan's or Benford's Sparks.

Morgan scratches his head. "You know, Benford... remember when you told me about your expedition to the Lands of Light? Well, the more I learn about that place..." Morgan waves his hands vaguely. "You don't travel in space when you're there, do you? You travel in information space. It's like navigating through the biggest Wikipedia ever."

"And if you're trying to look something up in Wikipedia," Morgan continues, "you need to have some idea what you're looking for. Some search terms. Which we have now." He gestures to the stacks. "If we're looking for information of what Davron's been up to, what he had to do with our Sparks being here... do you think maybe we can find it in the Lands of Light? Now that we have a better idea where to look."

Benford winces at the analogy with Wikipedia, but nods his head anyway. "So you're also implying that our Lands of Light, is the same Lands of Light as one would find from Eden. Well, it's worth a try. Shall we call Mister Klein and ask him to find us an access point?"

"The Assembled have access to the Lands of Light, and they don't come from Gaia or Eden," Morgan points out. "So if their Lands of Light is the same of ours, it stands to reason it'll be the same as Eden. Let's give it a shot."

"One and one always add up to two, no matter where you are," Benford quips, and pulls out his secure phone. "I'll call Klein."

An hour and several overpriced cab fares later, Morgan and Benford stand in front of the British Telecom Tower. Originally the Post Office Tower, the building has been a landmark of modern communications since its construction in the 1960's. The slender steel tower is an incongruously modern part of the old London skyline, festooned with every type of antenna. "I might have guessed," Benford mutters. "I'm getting slow in my old age."

Morgan rubs his chin. "We need somewhere to put our bodies while we're in. Follow me and act casual." All the serious parts of the tower are behind cardkey or even mechanical-key access doors, but it's easy for Morgan to talk his way into a minor administrative section of the building, and from there to a windowless conference room. Adjusting the "In Use" sign appropriately, he pulls up a chair behind the door. "Ready, Benford?" Morgan settles into his chair and closes his eyes. Take me in, Eddie.

There is the familiar sense of dislocation, and Morgan and Benford find themselves in a roomful of telephones, old-style rotaries, modern PBX systems, all linked together, knotted in an impossibly complex tangle. Benford nods to himself sardonically. "Yup, we're at British Telecom HQ all right."

Morgan ignores this, and opens a desk drawer under the nearest telephone. "Blank book, blank book... here we go." He pulls out a nondescript bound volume and picks up a pen. "Let's see... Davron wrote about the Nation of the Sun, so..." Morgan begins to scribble, lightning fast, in the book, writing down a detailed description of the Nation's capital, and ending by drawing a sketch in the back of the book of the palace. As he focuses on it, the picture begins to move. "There we go," he says, reaching toward the picture.

The picture grows, or perhaps just draws its viewers' attention, and a moment later the two Solars are aware that they're now surrounded by the scene it depicts. The flat little square of a bustling hall in a government building is now all around them, hundreds of feet wide. Pages and persons both important and self-important move around bearing stacks of scrolls, books, and parchments, as well as globes of light, strange artifacts, and other exotic items. "Oh, my," Benford breathes. "And where are we now?"

Obligingly, a caption appears below the sketch in Poe's journal: 'Provincial Capitol Building, The Southlands.'

The text of Morgan's book has now taken on a life of its own. As it begins to author itself, the two Solars see that their environments are changing to match. Buildings become terraces or towers. The Sun and Moon begin to advance through the sky at a faster and faster pace, whole days going by in a few quickly-drawn breaths of surprise, the passage of time driven by their desire to find truth. Guttering torches are replaced by everburning globes of pure golden light. Staircases become magically propelled conveyances. Looking down, the Exalts can see the text itself is likewise transforming in character.

Gradually it has become less of a narrative and more of a dry description. And gradually the world around them becomes less and less distinct. The Solars find themselves in a black void, and the narrative work has arrived at a new form entirely. It is astronomical telemetry, a description of pure position that would spell out the location of a celestial body. Benford and Morgan find themselves following the book's description. They float in space, seeing a distant Earth and dimly radiant Moon, and behold.

And behind them is... well, since it's in the middle of outer space, the temptation is to think of it as a space station. But it's far more extravagant than any space station ever conceived in fiction, to say nothing of the mundane air-boxes built by NASA. Towering spires of gold glitter in the Sun's light, with impossibly spindly strands between them which nevertheless bear tram-cars beneath them, shuttling from one tower to the next. Verdant and crimson gardens stretch out at ground-level between the pillars, and the majestic, flowing lines of the city inevitably draw the observer's gaze toward the great tower in the center, with an unblinking giant eye embedded in the very top.

Benford realises his mouth has been hanging open, and closes it. He glances at the book; some of the descriptions are geometric. "This should be visible... if we point a telescope here, it would be visible..." He turns back to the 'space city', and the night sky beyond. "There... Pegasus... Orion... the North Star..." And the book obligingly produces a single line of astronomical notation: an ascention, declination, and distance. Benford's mouth falls open again. "It's trailing us... the Earth, I mean, and not much further than the distance to the Moon. Men have been that far before."

"Davron built this," Morgan says. "He must have. Or someone associated with him." He looks at the book. "This led us here, and Davron was the connection we followed." He gazes out across the city again. "It's magnificent. No wonder they call that world Eden."

The last leg of the trip to CERN is by train. Benford and Morgan still use assumed names, although that will change when they reach Switzerland. Benford whiles away the time in a private cabin, working through economic scenarios for the fusion project.

High maintenence requirements mean that power won't exactly be free, especially without Benford's expert care. It could be used for ships, but it's too heavy for cars and aircraft. In the end, it is merely half as cheap as fossil fuels; but of course is clean and shatters the oil dependency.

The implications are subtle, but Benford is satisfied with them. Everyone's economy should improve, starting with Mexico and the USA. The dependence on foreign oil should be reduced, but the oil companies will get to keep making petrol for the time being.

"Ironically, we have to let the bastards keep their monopoly," Benford says to nobody in particular. "For now, anyway. They're too important to the economy: stock markets, pension plans, mutual funds."

Junior manifests in the passenger seat, giving the impression that he'd always been there. "Do you plan to wean the world of those too?" Junior asks.

The scientist shrugs. "If it proves necessary. There has to be a technical solution before there can be a social change."

"Maybe so," Junior cautiously replies. "Or maybe it's a matter of preference."

"Preference?" Benford asks. "Of the world? Or of myself?"

"Both," Junior replies. "The world prefers to build power plants, because they prefer to run air conditioners, rather than do without. Americans prefer to hop in their cars, rather than wait at a bus stop or a train station. The west, as a whole, prefers to buy and build rather than do without."

"But then there's you," Junior continues. "You have the power to solve this problem any way you like. It's not just the Eclipse and the Zenith that are into demagoguery. Every tribe and caste of Exalt are natural leaders. You remember how Vinge described a superhuman general?"

"'They out on armies as easily as you or I put on a mail-shirt'," Benford finishes. "So what you're saying is, if I wanted the world to depend on Reducing and Recycling instead of clean fusion power, we could do that as easily instead?"

"Instead of, or as well as," Junior amends, grinning. "So I say again, it's a matter of your preference, Dad."

Benford mulls this over for a few minutes. A conductor passes by in the hallway, preparing for the next station. "I suppose," Benford admits, "that I don't want to be bothered with trying to educate the whole world personally."

"You like teaching Jet's family, especially Timothy," Junior points out.

"Well, Timothy is a genius, and Jet's girls learn mostly because Jet wants them to," Benford responds. "Besides, that's a handful of people. You're talking about educating millions."

"Billions, even," Junior agrees. "But that wouldn't stop us, if it was what you wanted. 'If it isn't impossible, it's not worth doing', right? So there must be some reason why you'd choose this impossible thing over that one."

Benford shrugs again. "I guess I just don't like people that much," he says. "I'm not like them. I'm an ivory tower academic. I prefer to solve the problem with a machine, rather than do without, or try to persuade the entire world to do it some other way."

"Then you're just like them, because that's the solution they'd choose, and for exactly those reasons. Consider that." The youth is silent for a moment. "Are you afraid of something?"

"Afraid?" Benford sounds surprised. "Afraid of what, recycling? Rationing? Deposits on my beer bottles?"

"No, of people," Junior says. "Machines don't get angry. They don't unionize. They don't insist that you respect their culture, or language. They consume mindlessly, but they don't get angry if you call them gluttonous or stupid. So you can solve a problem with a machine and nobody has to have their feelings hurt by it, right? But if you tell people they have to take the train to work more often, or eat fewer candy bars, a lot of them take it personally."

"Well, I suppose," Benford says. "But what does that have to do with me?"

"Like you said, you're an ivory-tower academic. If you say to the world, 'Hey, ban Hummers or we're all going to die from Global Warming', the rabble will take it personally and might do something horrible like interfere with your grant application."

Benford shrugs again. "Well, that's a matter of economics. If people aren't inclined to accept an inconvenient truth, and will just make trouble for you, why point it out to them?"

"Because that's what you do," Junior says. "You're Newton-bloody-Benford. You're ready to argue cosmology with God himself but not argue bioethics with the faceless rabble."

Benford gives an exasperated snort. "What's your point?"

"You're better than that," Junior replies. "Even when you were in the wheelchair, people would have listened to you. Now, they'll dedicate their lives to your cause if you ask them. You don't have anything to fear. You really can solve this problem by nuclear engineering or social engineering. Maybe you should reconsider your priorities."

"I gather that you don't just mean Raven, either?" Benford asks.

Junior replies, "Raven solves a social problem for mortals. I gather that you also want to use it to cushion the inevitable shock when people wake up to what is going on in the world, and that's fine. What I'm saying is, when that happens, they're going to have visions and dreams for the future. You must be ready to guide them." The avatar leans back in his seat and closes his eyes, giving the impression of taking a nap. As he fades from view, Benford hears, "But then, you always have."

'Hacker' has come to mean many things in popular culture, and not all of them positive. Many people assume that the word simply means 'computer criminal'. Hollywood, of all things, has softened that image somewhat in recent years, portraying hackers on both sides of the law as Trickster figures... clever, motivated, dedicated, and very likely at least mildly insane.

Particle physicists are a similar breed. Benford knows the music, if not the dance. Klein is associated with the Chaos Computer Club, a large and diverse hacker tribe in Germany. So he's come to Hamburg seeking one of their number. Simply flashing his credentials won't be enough; yes, the hackers will be suitably impressed by his titles, but the lack of art and guile won't even get him past the front counter.

Fortunately, the CCC has just published the latest issue of Datenschleuder, their quarterly journal. From his Princeton days, Benford remembers an old post-publication habit: drinking lots of beer.

Poe and Luther are occupying themselves Luther's clique theory, in order to identify Klein among notable computer scientists. Benford has come to think of that method as 'The High Road'. In the absence of any better ideas, he marches over to an old-fashioned beer garden in a newfangled part of town. At worst, he makes a fool of himself; but as Junior said, when it comes to people, Benford needs to be ready to get his hands dirty. Benford calls this method 'The Low Road', and wishes Jet was here with him.

Benford finds a knot of bookish types in the back of the building, gathered around a long wooden table and talking animatedly and passing around copies of Datenschleuder. There is a box of the magazine nearby, and Beford gathers that he's found who he's looking for. Fortunately for Benford, there are a few smaller groups around other tables. Pint in hand, he approaches one, and asks to be seated.

Benford finds himself facing a trio of men, two that he guesses to be in his mid 20's and one closer to his own age. Benford's German isn't so good, so it's fortunate that they speak English, but perhaps grudgingly. Clearly they're hoping that he'll either prove interesting, or go away. Benford thumbs through a copy of the magazine, with its oddball assortment of topics. He stops on one article about cryptography.

"Oh, I haven't seen this one yet," he states casually, and pulls over a paper mat. He begins crunching his way through the algorithm on paper. When he's done, he's got a block of 32 hex digits. "Anyone want to have a go at breaking it?"

"You do zat in your head?" one of the men asks. Curiosity is an irresistable bait, after all. He takes the paper, looking it over. "Za propozed attack will take time.. Vat is your interezt in crypto?"

Benford shrugs as he takes another sip of double boch. "I've always been very good at figures, and it was a short string, anyway. Mostly my interest stems from privacy issues. I don't worry so much about my own secrets, though. Mostly I want to make sure that the rest of the world can have their own."

"There's a few tricks I can show you," he continues. "Mnemonics, mental arithmetic shortcuts. But I wouldn't have thought this would be the first time you'd seen this sort of thing."

"No.. you obviously know who ve are," the young man says, and Benford watches the deductive wheels turn in his mind. "You play zis game to tell us somezing, or to learn somezing. Zis is not how to ask to join ze Club. Are you a prodigy?"

Benford grins. "Prodigy. Yes... not just a mental trick. That's a good word for it. More than just a parlor trick." The scientist continues. "Suppose that it's possible for people to do such things," he gestures at the placemat. "Suppose that this is just the first mild sign of such capability." He leans forward, conspiratorial but not melodramatic. "What kind of world could we make with that talent, hmm?"

This makes the young man draw back, distancing himself. "Zat is not zomething we control, my friend," he says. "Vat is it you vant?"

Benford sighs, realizing that he's pushed things too far. "The most important sentence in any language is 'You are not alone.' I'm looking for another prodigy. There's work to be done and I need more help in doing it." The scientist figures he's going to have to leave soon, but takes a long gulp from his pint to give a plausible reason for him to delay.

This gets a reaction out of the young man, and Benford, keyed up to receive every bit of data he can, reads it perfectly. This man has heard of something like that, something which bothers him, but isn't directly connected to him. A person he's been told of, but doesn't know personally.

"I vish you the best of luck," the German says with a canny smile.

Benford sets down his empty stein on top of the inscribed placemat. "Thank you," he says simply, and walks away.

---

Benford finds a nearby bus stop and sits down with a copy of the hacker's magazine. He neither tries to be obvious, nor tries to hide; he simply wants to be findable if someone decides to talk to him. And if that fails... well, one of the hackers stood our in the pecking order; as long as Benford isn't stupid about it, maybe he can catch up to the guy and talk to him on the way home.

After maybe an hour, the senior hacker leaves. Benford quickly tosses the magazine in the trash and discretely approaches. Again, his purpose isn't to hide; it's just to get close enough to talk.

Of course, the scientist is no expert at such things; but a city street, even a sparsely populated one, is a potential field, like a particle experiment. The trick isn't to hide, so much as it is to arrange obstacles to be in the way. And so before the other man knows it, Benford is walking along beside him. "You know what I'm talking about," Benford begins simply. "I won't hurt you and I can't bribe you, but I can't afford failure. So please help me."

The conversation is simple enough. The German student has heard, like his fellows, of some very strange goings-on. In Berlin, one of the CCC's members abruptly went off the air. He came back weeks later, saying nothing about what had happened. He was fully virtual - nobody that this man knows had ever met him in person, so nobody could really follow up.

"Like the bloody Turing test," Benford mutters. "Except that I've met things that pass it." The scientist notes the dates and thanks the student. If the man is a prominent figure, it wouldn't have gone unnoticed.

Benford retreats to a hotel to try and add up the leads. It turns out that simply looking for missing scientists and CEOs isn't so easy, especially when it's only a few weeks. In Germany, the banks are so efficient, that a pensioner died alone in his apartment and it took years for his bill payments to fail. And Klein - if indeed it was Klein of whom the student spoke - is reclusive to begin with. "Alright. We'll try the high road," Benford concludes, and brings his notes to Luther.

Luther's analysis is simple. "Say there's fifteen hundred guys in the CCC," he explains. "Of those, fourteen hundred and ninety-nine do _not_ know about the Lands of Light, right? Further, Klein brought you news of an Alchemical presence at CERN - and that paid off. So, fine. _How did he know?_"

Benford says, "He went to CERN, either in the Lands of Light, or in person. I wonder if I already know him."

Luther nods. "Alright. He also knows quite a bit about telecommunications. Was there anyone like that at CERN? Someone who did this stuff professionally?"

Benford says, "CERN had an enormous IT staff. There was no one 'King of Cyberspace', not even Berners-Lee. Many competent professionals, but the rock stars were in high-energy physics. So I guess you would say, I probably don't know him; and he probably doesn't know about the Alchemical presence from physical evidence."

Luther nods along. "Just so. Look for unique traits. He has a large group - all CCC members. He has a smaller group - all people with an interest in CERN's online infrastructure. And he has a very exclusive group - all Celestials with access to the Lands of Light. According to what we know, he'd have to have access to the Lands, which means he has a symbiote, right?"

Benford says, "A symbiote, and an access point, most likely at the physical location of his Exaltation. It occured to me to go looking for one here. But from this side of the screen? It could be anywhere. For that matter," Benford asks, "How did you lot find him? The Synod, I mean."

Luther shrugs. "You could say he found us. We got a series of anonymous e-mails. All following a fairly sensible mutual-trust protocol. Basically he offered his services. Naturally, we didn't like that one bit." The Sidereal grins briefly.

Benford says, "Nor I. For all we know he's an Assembled brain in a jar somewhere. Ok, so we try again. Whoever he is, it's in the Lands of Light. Then he can only hide if he stays offline, which he won't do. And since we're going to use the access point at the LHC, if he _is_ a CERN user... well... that will make it very easy, won't it?"

Luther nods.

And so, Luther and Benford finally return to Geneva, with surprisingly little fanfare. The three Exalts enter the country separately, and the Man is nowhere to be found. The Swiss police recognize Benford's name, of course. His name has been in the news, of late, and a CERN attache is waiting anxiously. The driver has specific instructions to bring Benford precisely to Aymar's office, and nowhere else. No comment is made about Benford's ability to walk; but the man drives as if his passenger were visiting royalty, or possibly a wanted criminal. Sometimes, it's hard to tell.

Robert Aymar is standing in his office when Benford arrives. There is another with him, someone Benford hasn't seen before. Aymar speaks as the physicist enters: "Hello, Newton." His voice is thick with a wash of emotions; Benford can discern anger, frustration, happiness, and even awe. "You'll be wanting to meet the man who was filling in for you while you were, uh, away." He gestures to the stranger. "This is Doctor Maurer. He's been working on the LHC. No doubt you two have a lot to talk about."
