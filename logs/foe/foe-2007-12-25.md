# Fall of Eden 2007-12-25

Morning comes to Bogota, and the streets teem with life. Cars, people, voices, distant shouts, the smell of deep-fried food and the half-sweet stench of drying laundry swirl around Jet as she seeks her objective: an older couple, former associates of Raluo Lecuona. Perhaps they can reveal what happened to Timothy.

Emil Tuogo's hair is gray. His skin is bronzed and cracked by the sun. His face is pock-marked by scars and the signs of a long addiction. His eyes are dark, dry wells. The age of tears has come and gone; now all that remains in his gaze is shadow, and lost time. He stares at Jet from the open doorway of his home and listens as she introduces herself.

For a moment he tries to shut the door on her, but a forceful counter-push strong enough to leave a slight imprint in the wood is enough to convince him. Resignedly he turns away, allowing her into his modest residence.

He lives a meager existence. He is a sculptor, by the look of the well-stocked work area in one small room. The wall above his desk is covered in newspaper clippings, civic commendations, and other signs of a productive, involved citizen of the state. But nothing more recent than 2001 appears there.

Jet sits, and Emil politely offers coffee. Over two steaming cups of a bitter local blend, Emil tells his story.

"Sophrology was based on Eastern meditation. It is the study and development of the mind. It is the encouragement of men to act together in harmony. But some of us took it further. In the 70's, we were encouraged by the work of Timothy Leary and LSD-25. Many people thought as we did at the time. Perhaps you are too young to remember."

"We made what we thought were breakthroughs. Always we went slowly. But then Raulo and his wife joined us. They were perhaps the most daring. Certainly the most foolish. They experimented, and their child was born during that time. We praised God that the child was healthy. But that wasn't enough for Raulo."

"Young Jesus was brought up by his parents according to our principles: bringing the body into reality, to reinforce positive action, and to develop objectivity. This was not a religious cult. It was a way of life, which we tried to enhance using drugs."

"Raulo... That man, he thought that his son, too, should be introduced to the drugs we had begun to use. The men across the mountains --" a term, Jet has learned, that refers to the drug cartels of Colombia "-- were only too happy to sell them to us."

"They began to make demands of us, though. Since many of us were highly placed, they wished to use us." Emil gestures at his wall, drawing a line with his fingertip that encompasses the newspaper clippings. "We refused. We had made a bargain with Lucifer, we knew it, but we never really understood.."

A drink of his cooling coffee encourages the old man to continue. "Finally we had enough. We told them we no longer wished to do business. They told us we had no choice. We told them that we would report their men in Bogota to the authorities. And so they came for us. Raulo and Isabella... they were shot. They both had taken their drugs that night, too many drugs.. I think perhaps they knew they were going to die, and had tried to overdose before the cartel's men came."

"Their son, too... Jesus was with us that night, as he always had been. Nothing we said could convince them to take him away or spare him. I think that they wanted to bring him with them as they died. He too was going to overdose. We were helpless. Shame made us wish to die."

"There was a woman with them that night. Cold, empty eyes. She did not smile. The other men laughed and talked in their wickedness, but... they were at least men. She could have not had a heart. I don't know why she did what she did. It could not have been compassion."

"A woman with them?" asks Jet quietly. "Could you describe her a little more for me? I think I have seen a woman like that before, and I am curious if it is the same person." Somehow Jet doesn't think so, but she doesn't need Barry to whisper to her that coincidences like this demand attention.

Emil nods, and takes another long drink of coffee to steady himself. Even from here, Jet can smell the liquor he's mixed into his own cup. "She was not Latino. I have never seen a face like hers. Black hair. She wore sunglasses as she entered, even though it was dark. She wore leather, even a long jacket, despite the heat. She did not sweat at all."

"Did she carry a weapon?" asks Jet curiously. "Something that might seem a bit, I don't know.. archaic?"

"She had no weapons, only the syringe. She knelt, and gave the boy something. An injection, I think. It calmed him. He slept. She took him away from us. She told the others to give us the same thing." Emil looks up at Jet. "The others had syringes as well. She told them to inject us."

"I tell you that since that day, we were free of our addictions. The pain had gone from us."

That makes Jet perk up considerably. "Really? Do you have any idea where she might have gone after that? Something like that could make this cold world a lot better place for everyone."

Emil shakes his head. "She was one of them. She left with them. They took the boy, and let us live. If you want to find her, you must find the cartels."

"Then that is what I will do," says Jet softly. "Thank you for your time, Emil." As she rises and turns away she pauses for a moment to ask, "Does the name Santa Muerte mean anything to you?"

The man nods. "Of course. I wish to meet her some day. I have heard the stories. Perhaps this woman was another like her."

"She is incredible, Emil." The Lunar smiles calmly and says, "I will say hello to her for you, if you like. The White Tiger meets Santa Muerte quite often. But for now, I must find this other one, and see who and what she is."

---

"I hate Colombia." Jet knows the general direction the cartels lie in, and knows what she'd like to do to them. Still, even for a Lunar it's a bit of a tall order to destroy them all. Her first order of business is to get a bit more specific information about the cartels and the geography. She has to know enough to get from where she is to where they are without wasting precious time. Fortunately there are a lot of pretty girls who are interested in reaching the rich drug dealers, and Jet finds it far more practical to slip in with these than to bother with a long trek on foot.

It's hardly an elegant mode of transportation, but even a dusty old pick-up seems like a chariot to the women who are with Jet. The Full Moon uses the trip to gather more information, asking questions about where her fellow travelers are from and who they want to fall in with.

A few of the girls heading over the mountains entertain the idea that they are going to become Maid Marian to Don Diego's Robin Hood. Others know more or less what they're getting into, but they don't care - it's new and different and profitable. The Iguana is now in charge since Don Diego's arrest last year and murder while in prison.

The joke about the venture capitalist and the bordello stays true - "I love your business. You got it, you sell it, you still got it." While any girl here might use her mind, muscle and wits to find a place in the organization, ultimately it will be her body that permits entry.

The Iguana doesn't mind. The rumors that Jet hears are that he is running business rather differently than Don Diego's more flamboyant approach. This gives Jet hope. A powerful woman might actually be able to make some progress.

Santiago de Cali is where Jet gets off. From here she threads her way through a series of contacts, accompanied by several other girls. Some girls leave the group, and Jet knows no more of them. Other girls arrive, traveling for awhile with the little company. More and more openly, the men they travel with are armed. These are former members of the AUC - the right-wing paramilitary organization responsible for acts of terrorism against the government, and the hired muscle of the Norte del Valle cartel.

The AUC were so big that even Chiquita admitted to paying them for protection when bringing bananas north. Now their soldiers pursue other jobs, melting from cell to cell in the fluidly shifting rebel network of Colombia, working for the same employers over and over under new banners.

People aren't supposed to be sneaking wherever they want, but Jet is able to get away long enough to assume a more unnoticed shape. Everyone notices a beautiful woman, but a dog can slip past almost any radar. The Lunar has a lot of work ahead of her, but she knows what she's hunting for. She draws in the air and seeks out the rather unpleasant hint of an opened grave that will tip her off. She must find the mysterious black lady and learn the secret of that addiction-cleansing serum she used on Emil and the others.
