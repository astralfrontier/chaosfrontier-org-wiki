Jet can hardly proceed further without her two Lunar allies knowing something of her plans. As they finish off dinner (consisting of cooked kills in the South American forests), Roger Wolf Pads speaks.

"Your goal seems to be the destruction of drugs. But have you thought what this means? Shamans on these two continents have long used peyote to find truth. In California, they give marijuana to people sickened by the white man's pills. The Sacred Medicine was used to fight alcoholism. Is this an evil you feel you must fight?"

"My goal is not the destruction of drugs," corrects Jet softly. "My goal is to free slaves. Your people used these plants to bring them visions and peace. They did not, as far as I have heard, lose themselves in Oblivion." The Full Moon looks to Ricky, "Much evil has come of these drugs. That is what must be stopped. Drugs are not themselves evil. Neither is fire. Or metal. Yet all these things can kill. If we must remove all things that kill, then we must destroy all men, as well."

The Full Moon raises a hand, "No, we must not destroy blindly. We were called to protect men and to teach them. The ways of the past were not wrong. But it is not meditation that makes these men rich. It is exploitation and enslavement. They plague children who cannot know any better and profit from the rotting husk of a society on the very brink of death. Yet it is not it's death that I care for. Where one fortress falls another may be built."

"So what I want to do is destroy these men," says Jet. "I want to destroy the laws that would prevent the native americans from growing their own drugs. I want to destroy the labs that would take these drugs and turn them into will-crushing poisons. I would have the children of the people be taught properly and know that drugs are not meant for them, but that their time will come, if they are patient." Jet frowns in thought, her eyes staring off, "I do not think this is impossible. I also think that alcohol and tobacco must be treated as we treat marijuana and cocaine."

Ricky shakes his head. His eyes are cold, an expression Jet knows all too well in herself. "Kill one and three more spring up. How many times do you think that law enforcement's put a dent in the trade here, huh? How many new guys spring up? You can't just kill a few evil men and expect the rest to suddenly find religion. For as long as people want to use this stuff, there'll be scum willing to sell it."

"That is why we must work to remove that desire," says Jet. "We also must find one of our own to come to this place and give it direction and order. They have a simple choice here, to starve or to push poison. Yet for all their pushing it seems only a few profit. Those are the ones that we must remove. As for the rest, I think the Sun's Chosen may be able to help. They are very gifted when it comes to giving people hope." The Full Moon turns her eyes on Ricky then, strangely soft and forgiving, "We must let go of hate. We must let go of despair and doubt. You know we were given the power to do things that no one else could do. Our greatest limitation is our own will. What is your dream for this place, Ricky?"

"Honestly?" The narco-cop snorts, then sighs. Some of his reserve shifts away. "Just to be people. Not wetbacks. Not the third world. Not, uh, 'fledgling nations' or whatever that phrase was. Not those poor countries that need the IMF. Not the CIA's playground. I want us to be able to stand up on our own. I want you Anglos to look us eye to eye. Is that so much to ask?"

"Not at all," replies Jet. "So let's make it happen together." The Full Moon laughs, "Isn't that why we're here? We don't have the Silver Lady telling us what she wants, so we have to have faith in our own judgement. What you want and I what I want are not different. No slaves. No lesser people. I don't know history very well, but I believe before the Europeans came here some of the most sophisticated civilizations in the world held this land. It is in their hearts to do it again, don't you think? Tijuana is not a huge place, but it is a start. It is the seed of our dream."

"We need more than that," murmurs Roger. "We must stop the interference from outside. Or this rebirth will be strangled in the womb."

"I think with work that can be managed," says Jet. "We have the power to change the way the world works, if we really want to." She looks skyward and slowly closes her eyes. "The question then is simple. Do you want to do more than just dream? Will you commit yourselves to sharing our visions for the future and making them real?"

"We already have, I think," Roger answers with a smile, and Ricky nods.

"Then I think we should talk to the Solars," says Jet seriously. "I believe that with them we are far more likely to succeed. They are family, and I think all our dreams are streams feeding the same great river." The Full Moon laughs again, "I have not spoken like this before. I am not sure what surprises me more: that you take me seriously, or that I do. I have been chasing a dream my whole life. For the first time, the trail is not cold. For the first time, I know what I seek."

Doctor Maurer is, to say the least, curious about where Benford has been and what he's been up to for the last year. Benford, for his part, is trying to solve a mystery of his own. There's a good chance that Klein, whoever he is, has used the Lands of Light access point at CERN. Only a handful of people would have unrestricted access to the accelerator complex, so Benford is reviewing personnel records. The two scientists end up working in an observation room overlooking the target area of the Large Hadron Collider, the most expensive instrument ever built.

It's easy enough for Benford to explain the reactor design itself, using a six foot long blueprint unrolled on a worktable. Unfortunately, he's forced to be a little more evasive about how he came up with the theory behind it.

Johann Maurer has been hard at work. 2008 has been a banner year for the Large Hadron Collider. His job has principally been administrating the technical aspects of it; other members of the staff have been responsible for the administrative details and logistics. One thing he regrets, he confesses, is the lack of time to really review all the proposed experiments.

Benford prods a computer, looking for some of the documents Maurer mentions. There are hundreds of proposals from physicists all over the world; even a cursory inspection would take days. "I can help you review some of these, if you like." Then Benford has an idea. "Have we had any new hires in the high-energy staff recently? Someone very skilled, but a little... I don't know... antisocial? Or maybe just socially clumsy?"

Maurer laughs. "Herr Benford, the staff insists on shielding me from even well-adjusted scientists. Until their proposal comes under review, of course, for our child here. You can meet the hires if you wish.."

Benford shakes his head. "No, that's alright, but I would like to review their files. If you don't mind, I'll work from here... perhaps I could catch up with you later?"

Maurer nods. "Guten tag, then."

After the senior scientist departs, Benford arranges himself in a comfortable chair with a laptop. For the most part, the device is a prop. His real objective is more subtle. _Hypatia, we're less then ten meters from the location of my Exaltation. If there's an access point anywhere in the world, I would hope we're right on top of it._

In the Lands of Light, the corridors and doorways of CERN remain, but energy conduits and signal lines glow within the walls. Beyond the observation portal, the target area is filled with a bright, pale suffusion. The people are gone, but every digital packet and particle stream is as clear as leaves blowing in the wind. Benford stares at the clock on the corner of the laptop screen, and murmurs softly, "Backwards." He waits for something he recognizes; or at least, something anthropic.

The scientist doesn't find what he's searching for in the personnel records. But as is the nature of the Lands of Light, he is drawn toward knowledge. Truth is always just an arm's reach away; it is ignorance which introduces distance. He feels the presence of the one he seeks, but it is in the higher and deeper and further recesses of CERN's informational existence.

The order to reverse time stands. Benford sees the processes of this place work in reverse. He becomes aware of other searching intelligences like himself, seeking the City he remembers from his initial visit. That is where his truth lies, and that is where he must go.

Those feeling tendrils of knowledge came from before. Now with a destination in mind, the sensations fall away. He is in the here and now. He is in the City. To be more precise, he finds himself standing outside of a vast dome, covered in gold and glistening in the sun. He steps inside. And what he sees leaves him dizzy with shock.

People are here - if you can call them that. Organisms or beings, certainly. White-coated scientists bow politely and speak with figures who seem cut from the collective imaginations of the fiction and fantasy writers of the world. Humanoid auras of light stand next to masses of waving tentacles that float unsupported. Armored gladiators wearing edged slide-rules and ethereal winged women speak with each other in hushed tones.

Benford begins sketching in the air with a fingertip, leaving a neon-green trace; the figure he draws is the Universe, as he understood it before Exaltation; next to it he draws a the world as he understands it now; a snowglobe surrounded by... he's not sure, really. A few of the Angels and other things take notice. "Infinite but bounded," he pronounces, finishing the snowglobe. "Infinite and unbounded," he pronounces, pointing to the quantum universe. "Friends, I am a priest of this place. We seek to split the smallest things and make new types of matter. But we know what we will find. As one of you said to me, the real challenge is to open the Universe beyond. What progress have we made?"

A few of the stranger beings continue whispering at each other, but Benford has most of the room's attention. The white-robed attendants draw near. "We have made some progress, sir," says one. "As you can see, our experiments have drawn gods from Creation's outer reaches, and from further realms. Even Malfeas itself sent a demon ambassador."

Benford is fascinated and appalled; there are beings here from places he's only read about in Hel's briefing, places he didn't seriously believe existed. _I should be looking for Klein, but..._ He takes a seat. "I am impressed. I would like to hear more about the deliberations. As you may have heard, events are afoot in the mortal realm of Gaia." He smiles. "As one of those events, I believe I can facilitate things a bit."

A foot-tall fairy, fluttering about on gossamer wings and looking on with sparkling eyes, approaches Benford. "This talk of a universal fate is very exciting. We were told that the technology is only in its infancy. How has it worked for your world, if I may ask?"

It takes Benford a moment to understand what the fairy means. "We don't think of it as fate, as such. We just call it... physics. Our universe is impartial and presents the same face to all beings. We've had no magic; no Exalted. But... we've made many wonders of our own. Just as importantly, we've imagined many more." He smiles again. "I daresay that we've dreamed as much as any people of Creation, because we don't believe our world has boundaries. So... I suppose it's worked quite well, at least as a prototype." The scientist considers. "We have the heroism. All we're missing is... hmm... the undercurrent of glory, I suppose." _Maybe we need to work on that. I should go back and read Campbell again._

Benford rises and begins to sketch again. "I'm going to describe something. It would be a favor to me, if you choose to consider it. In Creation, there's a great distinction between mortal and hero; those who bend destiny - Gods and Exalts of one form or another - and those who are, as we say, just along for the ride. And yet every Mortal soul is compatible with the Exaltation. Given the motivation, the choice, and yes, given a few lucky strokes, it is the Mortals that become Exalts. This we all know."

Benford continues, sketching Junior's 'Feynman Diagram' of the soul. He sketches his own caste mark in the center, representing the Solar spark. "What we really miss, in our impartial universe, is a clear ability for our lives to have meaning. We're left to make that for ourselves. But if every Mortal is an exalt in potentia, then every Mortal is a hero - but for their, hmm, let's call it their wave function, varying in power." He finishes the sketch of the soul, and drags it onto the sketch of the quantum universe with a fingertip. "To whit, perhaps what we should do, is weave heroism into the fabric of mortal existence. Give a form of Exaltation to everyone." Benford stops, checking if his otherworldly audience has followed his reasoning.

"An interesting application of the technology," murmurs the fairy-like creature. "And what of the place of gods such as we in this scheme?"

Benford says, "As our Voltaire said, if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him." Benford grins. "I've learned that an anthropic universe needs its Gods. At the moment, only the strongest of our deities get to claim dominion over entire continents, entire worlds." Benford points at the quantum sphere. "Infinite and without bounds. My Lady... one day we will have Gods of entire galaxies. Can you imagine claiming dominion on that scale?"

"We shall see," the fairy murmurs. "Thank you for your insight."

Benford nods. "I shall return. Which reminds me. There is another Exalt who may have been here recently. My associates have told me he may be in distress. Have any of you seen him?"

This is answered by one of the white-coated attendants. "Er, yes.. Come this way, if you will.."

Benford follows the attendant, leaving the otherworldly throng behind. He seems to have caused something of a stir. _Good,_ he thinks. _We're going to need to know what to do if we win._

"Perhaps it is not my place to say.." The attendant rubs his hands together fitfully. "This forum was not intended for third-party contracting or arbitration, but... this 'Klein' has been making well, pacts with certain of our visitors. I'm concerned that it will affect the purity of our research."

Benford says, "Oh, dear," Benford mutters. "I assume you're using that word with knowledge of its connotation among my people."

"Just so," the attendant mutters. "Perhaps you can convince your colleague to take such activities to a more suitable venue."

"Some people only learn to fear fire by getting burned," Benford grunts. "Believe me, I want your research to succeed as well. What's more, I want to convince Klein that being a team player is better for his health. And mine. Show me what we have."

The attendant guides Benford to the edge of the City. Benford finds that, as he arrives at the threshold of nothingness, that he isn't 100% certain he remembers arriving. It seems to be the nature of the Lands of Light. "If you wait here, I will ask one of my superiors to join you." He turns and leaves.

A short time later, Benford witnesses a sight he didn't expect. It is a robotic skeleton, huge and powerful, striding across the improbable information landscape. Its glowing green eyes look down at Benford from a height of at least fifteen feet. It grinds to a stop, joints creaking, and regards the Solar. "**Kotetsu Jin, at your service.**" His voice is deep and mechanical.

Benford lets himself be intimidated for a moment, then remembers, it's an ontological realm; it's just a representation of the thing. But... it's still a representation of quite a large thing. "My associate, Klein, has committed some mischief. I am here to make things right. Or at least, less wrong. Can you take me to him?"

Kotetsu Jin twists a clawed hand about, making a gesture Benford recognizes as a _mudra_ - a magically-charged configuration of the hand, like a Word of Power but in sign language. A window of light snaps open, floating in empty air. "We will intercept Klein's next approach. Please wait." And then he stops moving, completely.

"You remind me of Gearhard," Benford quips, and practices sitting in lotus. If Klein is a typical hacker, it won't be a long wait. Even Benford checks his email six times a day, and that's even with the threats on his life.

"I am of his generation," Jin replies calmly.

In time, Benford sees activity. A humanoid figure of lambent flame emerges from the window. Looking around, clearly startled, it leaps back through the window. A red laser-like line snaps out from Jin's right eye. "I have a trace," the metal man announces. He rattles off an address in Berlin.

Benford gets ready to unplug. "Thank you," he says, and in the real world he's already dialing his phone: Luther needs the address. If anyone can keep Klein from disappearing down the rabbit hole again, it's a Sidereal intelligence office.

---

Berlin welcomes Benford with its usual authoritarian gloom and stuffy efficiency. Luther has been staking out a two-story apartment building. He's across the street and smoking a cigarette, and Benford almost runs into him before he notices the man is here. "Up there," is all Luther says, speaking only as Benford's passing body would obscure his lips from the apartment's windows.

Benford just keeps walking. He'll approach the building from an angle that isn't visible to that apartment, and find his way in. Many hackers are paranoid, but all of them are cocky; either Klein will hold still for a few minutes, and they can work out an arrangement; or he won't, and maybe the Fates just aren't smiling on the Raven today.

Morgan nods to the shadowy figure, idly noting that even now, it's easier to think of the man as a shadowy figure than Luther Blissett - then forgetting that he thought such a thing as he follows Benford up the short flight of stairs to the front door.

The apartment door is unlocked. Morgan goes in first, feeling his social instincts at work here. There is fear, but it isn't the mortal dread of someone under attack. The door, the relatively unguarded apartment, even the neighborhood. It all smacks of anonymity rather than security.

The two Solars find themselves in an unlit living room. They can hear breathing from beyond. The high-pitched whine of computer monitors comes from one of the bedrooms. And inside, huddled in one corner staring at the screens, is a girl with dirty blonde hair. She's rail-thin, with prominent cheekbones and an angular nose, and she looks up. "Mein Name ist Klein," she half-whispers. "You.. you are the Americans, aren't you."

"We are that too," Benford replies, shocked, once again. _How can I know all the secrets of the universe and live my life in continual astonishment?_ "I'm Benford, this is Poe. The Synod told us you were in trouble. Why try so hard to hide from us?"

Klein stares directly at Benford, incredulously. "Are you stupid?" she finally asks. "Because.. nobody respects stupid little girls."

Morgan stifles a chuckle... then thinks better of that and allows it to become an outright laugh. "Oh man... we should've brought Jet along with us, Benford." He sobers up a little. "Jet is a Lunar, and my..." Morgan blushes a little, "good friend. I can assure you, if _she_ caught anyone not respecting girls, she'd have kicked his ass right back to the States."

"But even you two were surprised, yes?" Klein presses the point. "You thought I would be older, a man. You expected more of me." She pulls her legs up onto the chair and hugs her knees tightly.

Morgan purses his lips. "Expected _more_? Well, yes, we did expect you to be male. But you're a Solar now. You - we - have the power to _change_ attitudes like that. And it's high time we did so. If we're going to face the threat of the Assembled, we can't afford to discard the talents of half of our species."

Benford thinks about it. "To be precise, I thought you'd be one of those insufferable, overconfident boch-drinkers from Hambourg. It's not a bad thing, that that isn't true."

Benford says, "The Synod tells us that the success of Raven depends on you; and that you've gotten yourself into some trouble. That's why we're here. But I had thought you were avoiding us, toying with us like this was a game. I see the truth of it now. And I will keep your secret, whether you help us or not." _Jesus. I feel like shit now. If I were her, I would have shot me._

Klein sighs. "I'm sorry.. I'm sorry for being so pathetic." She uncurls and stands up. She's not only skinny, she's short. "I'm Marlene. Klein from K-Line, on IRC. And Klein bottles. Mathematics. I met all those strange creatures and thought they could help me out."

Benford thinks this over. "You met those strange creatures..." _Hypatia, is this an access point?_

_No. I believe the access point is at the address your Alchemical friend provided,_ the symbiote replies.

Benford says, "To access the Lands of Light, you need a symbiont... as far as we know, anyway. Usually they ask you to name them immediately after bonding... umm... do you have one?"

Klein - Marlene - nods slowly. "You mean the second voice," she says.

Benford nods equally slowly. "And the first voice, comes from your Spark - the virtual machine of the Exaltation, given to you by one of the Incarna. And so you are an Exalt of the first order. But you're so good at hiding, the Shadow Synod, the Sidereal Exalted in Europe were unable to find you. That's devilishly hard. They found me the next morning. I hadn't even been above ground more than three hours and the phone rang. You've hid from them for months." The scientist sighs. "I didn't think anybody could do that. It's worthy of respect. There is nothing pathetic about you, but hiding in shadow is second nature to you. Did the Voice tell you what that caste is called?"

A phantom sigil sparkles to life on the girl's forehead. Benford recognizes it with ancient instinct. It is the symbol of stealth, as he guessed. Klein is not Twilight, but Night.

"Night caste," Benford breathes. "The first we've ever met." The scientist lights his caste mark as well, keeping the illumination subdued and suffuse out of respect. "They call my kind the Twilight."

Morgan illuminates his own circle-in-circle. "Eclipse. We are the deal-makers, the negotiators."

"Are we done with show-and-tell?" The voice belongs to Luther. "If so, I suggest we leave quickly." He's standing in the doorway. "Ma'am. We'll need to talk. I represent the Shadow Synod."

"One moment, Luther," Benford interrupts. "Klein, if that is what you wish to be called, just because you're good at hiding, doesn't mean you have to be alone. We wouldn't be here if there wasn't a real problem. Let us help you."

The girl seems undecided. Finally, Benford and Morgan see a look in her eye that they recognize. From out of her shell, she is becoming something which can shake worlds and uproot ideologies. She is a Solar making a decision. "Very well. But on my terms. First, I won't go to America. You're too backward there. Second, I want protection. From the Alchemicals."

Benford nods. "As you wish, then."

Morgan smiles a little. "I think we'd all like protection from the Alchemicals, Klein. That's why we're working together." He rubs his chin. "I don't know if Benford and I are ready to leave our experiment in Tijuana for too long just yet. But until then..." He glances at Luther.

Marlene has very little in the way of important possessions. Somewhat surprisingly, she claims nothing of value is on the computers in the apartment. It seems a deliberate act - nothing incriminating can be found, should the police come. All she needs is some clothes, and a stuffed teddy bear that looks worn around the edges. She glares daggers at the three men as the bear is being packed, silently challenging them to breathe a word.

Luther has already made arrangements for an 'expedited departure' from Berlin. Matters at CERN are unresolved in that Benford didn't give a full report, but the scientist knows that Aymar will be satisfied. He's been called on the carpet, the laboratory's professional pride has been assuaged, and Benford's continued work is in the interest of Science.
