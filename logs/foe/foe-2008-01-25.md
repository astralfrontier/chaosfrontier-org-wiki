Ricky's decision comes easily. Ever since he and Mirya last saw the other Celestials, he has been fighting his own war against drugs in Latin America. He will be staying behind, to put more hurt on the drug compound that the three Lunar hunters discovered. He actually looks enthusiastic about it.

Roger Wolf Pads is equally satisfied. He has no wish to make further trouble. And when Jet finally announces her intention to return to Tijuana, he replies that he has an offer for her. Patting the medicine pouches he brought with him, he explains. "We have been using the Sacred Medicine for many years. I think you should try as well. When we grapple with monsters, they whisper their secrets to us. We must be prepared to listen. Are you willing to open your heart and mind to those secrets?"

Jet considers Roger's offer for only a short time. She trusts this man. To turn away his suggestions would be an insult. "I will face those secrets and pray that the Silver Lady has given me enough wisdom to see what I must see."

It seems that the No Moon has everything he needed. He's probably got enough mescaline to be put away for 20 years, but it's all in natural form. In a jungle clearing, Jet watches as he prepares the cactus using nothing more sophisticated than rocks and clay as his tools. "You must be calm and ready," he explains. "It will show you whatever you go in to see. If you take it in fear, you will find fear."

"I take it in hope," says Jet softly. "I am learning to give up fear, there is nothing there that can save us." The Lunar smiles suddenly, "I accept something now that I was not willing to before. What I was in the past does not matter now. I will go forward and be what I am supposed to be." She sits near Roger and lets out a deep breath, "I need to see what we must save and how we can save it. Our enemies are all around us and we cannot see them. I need to pierce these lies and illusions."

The powder comes next. Jet feels a wash of bitterness spread from her tongue through her mouth. She sits quietly, with Roger nearby. She listens to the jungle. She watches the edges of the leaves lose their focus, becoming flat and indistinct. Her sense of balance begins to waver. A sense of motion without bodily motion engulfs her, like the world itself was warping and shifting about like a funhouse mirror.

Jet can see someone walking toward her. The outline is blurry, but as the face draws close to hers she recognizes her Lunar avatar. The calm face, the white hair and violet eyes, the aura of perpetual _acceptance_ that she now recognizes for what it is. He is not a calm ship on a calm sea; he is the sea, flowing perfectly with the world around him. He smiles.

Jet finds her attention drawn to her left. A tiny flower is growing out of the rich soil, blessed by the Pacific winds of the region and warmed by sunlight. She can see it as a flat picture, like a paper cut-out floating on the breeze. It vibrates in her vision, glowing and shivering with a barely-repressed inner power. Her avatar looks to it as well. "What you see is the flower's desire to grow," he whispers. "You see its will to live."

The whole jungle has acquired a similar appearance. Jet feels the struggle of life. The trees, growing defiantly against each other to compete for sunlight. And she remembers the words of the Alchemical and the parable of the Fuse. "The trees don't steal soil and sunlight from each other because they hate each other," says the Lunar in Jet's ear. "It's just who they are."

Jet listens, wordless for a time. She looks at the trees passively and finally says, "I see and understand this is what our world is. The Solars seem to think there could be room for everything, a way to be more than this. Is it possible for us to change?"

"Look, child, and see," another voice whispers. Jet looks up. It is the jungle speaking. Trees of gold and silver and violet are growing. Jet looks further, staring at the sky, seeing the Sun and Moon and stars in the sky, all at the same time. The roots of the trees are buried in the soil. "It is the tree's duty to shelter," comes an unknown voice, from an unknown place. Jet doesn't recognize it.

She looks around. Beyond the trees are fields. And beyond the fields is the sea. Men work the fields. And sometimes, a trio of these workers approach the trees and kneel, begging and supplicating.

Jet sees something remarkable. The men begin hewing one of the golden trees. They strip it for lumber and begin building a house from the wood. "The world is changing," the voice says. "These children of the Heavens have no place in that world." Jet's avatar speaks again, joining the unknown voice. "Moses led his people to the Promised Land, but he was not able to enter it."

"So you are saying that to be part of the world the Solars envision men must change?" asks Jet. "I think I understand what you mean. We can guide them and lead them, but in the end, the new world of hope must be their own. It will be Eden all over again. They must decide to taste the forbidden fruit on their own. Like the first time, they will not know the price of that choice."

"Men must change, because there will be no Solars there to guide them. Nor Lunars. Nor Sidereals." The Lunar avatar's voice is sad. "Plant the seeds that will grow well and properly. Plant the seeds that shake with life and burst with willingness to live."

"I think I know what I must do," says Jet quietly. She lets out a soft sigh and extends a hand. Somewhere past the trees there are places where the men will not live, and in those empty places children appear, singing and laughing as they bring life to the emptiness with their hands, where they pass the dead rock blooms with flowers. "I do not know if I shall live to deliver a child of my own womb to this land, but I will give rise to those who will plant wonderful gardens of their own design. Even when I die I will be joyful knowing that life and joy go on in some small corner of this vast place."

Jet recognizes one of the nearby flowers. It is a rose, incongruous in Latin America, and she looks. It rises, facing her, and speaking. Jet can see the etchings of circuitry and metal that replace its petals and stem, and she remembers the Alchemical woman's former name - Rose Cutter. "Child of the Moon, I am the Child of the Machine. Do we not already share a son? Will you love him for me?"

"Timothy?" asks Jet softly. "Wait.. love? You can love?" She reaches out, brushing the strange petals with her fingertips. "How is that possible?"

"You asked if it is possible for people to change," the rose answers. "Will you be nothing but what you are? And must I be the same?"

"I did not know you could change," says Jet. "I cannot afford to be what I was now. I have to be something new." The Lunar sighs softly and smiles, "I will remember you, Rose Cutter, and I will love Timothy for you. What can I tell him of you? He will have many questions about the gifts he has been given when he is older. I know in my heart I will not be there to answer them, either, but I will leave the truth behind me in a way he can understand."

"He wants to know the truth about his father," the rose answers, and Jet can feel the world twisting again. "Tell him this." And Jet looks. In the depths of the forest there is a plant. It thrives on sunlight, and yet it can't see it. The sky is cloudy, or the trees and other plants cover it. It hungers for sunlight, straining to grow, frustrated that it cannot.

It finds a patch of poisoned earth where a narrow sliver of sunlight ekes through. And it grows there, spreading into the fouled soil, dying from the roots for the sake of the sun.

"We all just want to be happy," the rose whispers.

A single tear slides down Jet's left cheek and she nods. "I will tell him."

---

Jet finds herself waking up. Her muscles are slightly stiff, but that shakes itself off as she begins moving about. Her mouth is dry, and her eyes feel puffy. It's well into night, and Roger is tending a fire nearby. He looks up and studies Jet as she returns to consciousness. "You said many things," he says with a faint smile. "That is a good sign."

"I saw things, some of them I do not understand," admits Jet. "At least not yet. I do know what I must do, and honestly it terrifies me. I'm happy, though. Is that strange?"

Roger shakes his head. "Fear is not a monster that will stand in your path and bar the way. Fear is a voice. Listen to it, then act as you know you should."

"I have a strange dream to chase, but it feels right. I have no idea how I will do it," says Jet. "Somehow, I must give birth to something utterly new to this world."

"Then you had better start." Roger stands and kicks dirt over the fire. "Where do we go?"

"Tijuana," says Jet. "I need Timothy's help. I think he has what I need to begin. After that.. I need forsaken babies, the hopeless and dying."

Jet is not sure whether she moves towards Tijuana, or if the very pull of duty and destiny draw Tijuana to her. In the end, it doesn't matter. She stands near the front of the house that serves as home to her family and enters with a purposeful stride. It is late, but Jet feels compelled to do this now, while the light of the Silver Lady brightens the restless world.

Timothy has many questions as children always do, but he is eager to help, even if he must have someone poking his arm to draw blood. What Jet needs is something to work on, and Rose Cutter has given her just the beginning she requires. It is not a full-blown nanomachine, but Jet doesn't know the difference anyway. It can change the body, and it is alien enough for her to detect and manipulate. Or so she hopes.

Jet leans over and kisses Timothy on the cheek, ordering him to bed with a smile. "I'll tell you all about it in the morning," she promises. With that, she slips out the front door. She doesn't have to go far. Moonlight fills the air around her. From that moonlit air Roger's voice comes, "If you need me, I will not be far."

Charity laughs softly, "You are never far from my heart, Roger. But this, I must do on my own." In the moonlight, the vial of blood appears dead, black as jet, but the Lunar can smell the life in it. She lets out a deep breath and closes her eyes.

The Lunar doesn't know what she is doing before she acts. It comes to her from somewhere else. Charity doesn't fight it. She inserts the needle into her arm, waiting. One by one she shuts down her senses, clearing her mind of all distractions.

First she surrenders sight. Even with her eyes open, she sees nothing. Next she dispels scent, her surroundings growing more empty. She closes her mind to hearing next. The last soft murmur she can feel comes from the beating of her heart.

Last comes touch, surrendered just as Jet injects Timothy's blood into her body. Now free of all distractions she turns inward, using a sense that is dim in this world. Jet feels only essence, and reaching out tentatively with this new sense, she perceives it as strands of meaning, of intent and purpose. She knows the enduring strength of the earth, the fluidity of air, and inside herself the light of Luna radiates a terrifice light.

The Lunar finds it easiest to sense that which mingles with her own essence. Among those things, the blood of Timothy is clearest in her mind. As it joins with her own she reaches out and caresses it with her will. That same will preserves the alien power racing through her veins, preventing its destruction.

Preserving the blood is not enough. It is not the blood that will help her. Inside the blood she finds what she seeks; so small, glowing like a distant star Jet finds it at last. Carefully she plucks it out, essence wrapping about essence and drawing it deeper inside her spirit.

Life needs a seed, and Charity's body can provide that beginning. There is inside her another pinpoint of glowing light and she draws nanites to it, binding them together. Now she feels the most difficult part upon her.

The Lunar doesn't understand what tools she uses, but she uses them nonetheless. Where there are two strands of essence she must make one. She works on them on levels more fundamental than physics has yet to uncover. Where essence delves there is no matter. She does not manipulate proteins or molecules, but ideas. She taps into the life in her own womb and draws from the nanites the concept of adaptation, of cleansing. Beyond this Charity finds in herself the ability to instill yet more. Beauty and love she pours into her work, transforming her essence instead of her form. Silver light swirls around her and wakes her family, who come to witness her under Roger's watchful eyes.

The binding is impossibly difficult, there is an element Charity finds missing. It resists her and she pauses to consider it for some time. She holds a hundred thousand threads, ready to weave them, but something stands in the way. She sees in her mind a vision of what it is, and she knows why it is she fails. She knows what she must do to have any hope of success.

'Wyld'. Charity doesn't understand this word murmured to her from another world. She knows what it is, though. This world has no Wyld that she knows of, but it doesn't matter. Essence simply explodes from her, and as the ever-changing energies of Luna's light rain down around her Jet acts, using all her power to draw in the entropy of her own being, her every chaotic thought and impulse rush into the gap and as they race through the threads at last slide home, the weaving of essence ends in a last blast of energy and the Full Moon, utterly exhausted, collapses into darkness.

In the morning Charity wakes with a clear mind. She's had a strange sleep, full of singing that she doesn't understand. On the floor Roger is sitting, looking quite relaxed. His question isn't voiced, but Charity answers it.

"Timothy's blood was purified by Rose Cutter," Charity begins. "I thought there might be something left in his blood. My vision confirmed this hunch and so I had to see if I might be able to do something with it. I have been able to bind the properties of the-I guess nanites-to my own being. I think I can use this to purify others like he was purified. I will hopefully be able to use my blood to clean the blood of others by generating these nanites." There's something Charity isn't saying yet, though. It's too long a shot. Roger can tell she's keeping something back, but he does not ask.

Morgan, Benford, and the Night caste who calls herself Klein are back on the train to Geneva. It turns out that Klein did receive the briefing packet from Hel, and so knows the basics about Essence and Exaltation. A great deal of her reluctance to get involved with others stems from a self-image problem; but Benford also guesses that some Night castes are naturally cautious, and so being ignorable is no bad thing.

Benford and Morgan take turns briefing the diminutive hacker on the events of the past few years. The Solars occupy a small private cabin near the end of the train. Luther may or may not be nearby; as is his wont, he's seeing to security matters on his own.

Marlene is talkative. Benford finds, in fact, that she evinces an actual distaste at being referred to as "Klein" - but when she's face-to-face with people. Online, the reverse seems to be true, and she clings to the Klein persona even as Benford is writing his updates for the other Exalts by e-mail. It takes more effort to drag her story out of her than it did to talk about Raven, but eventually it is all made clear.

Marlene is talkative. Benford finds, in fact, that she evinces an actual distaste at being referred to as "Klein" - but when she's face-to-face with people. Online, the reverse seems to be true, and she clings to the Klein persona even as Benford is writing his updates for the other Exalts by e-mail. It takes more effort to drag her story out of her than it did to talk about Raven, but eventually it is all made clear.

Geist, and her avatar, helped her study the remnants of the Assembled. She pulled it apart piece by piece, discovering that some of its parts were destined for a local physics laboratory. She did some research and pieced together a link to CERN. And then, on her visit, Geist made her aware of the Lands of Light. The rest is known.

As far as Raven goes, Luther is satisfied with its progress, though he isn't specifically involved. He offers the Synod's help if they require.

It's fortunate, though. Raven's success rests partly on the girl's skills. Marlene is less than forthcoming about matters after the LHC. And what Benford and Luther hear make them quite confident that they came in the nick of time.

Marlene was trading favors. Access to Earth in exchange for powers, specified or otherwise. The creatures she traded with were sometimes beautiful, sometimes hideous, but always very interested in talk of a world without supernatural protectors or experience with magic. They asked Klein to perform rituals for them. A few of these have already been done; others have not.

Some creatures asked for nothing but information, which she gave. Benford hears nothing in the recitation of these details that gives him too much pause.

Benford refrains from berating Klein/Marlene for what she did; after all, what for mortals might be a deal with the Devil, is just another diplomatic negotiation for an Exalted. "And so that was what that one entity meant, about keeping the laboratory unbiased... although knowing how much trouble it is for anything supernatural to manifest here, even if some alien spirit could make it to Earth, it would likely be the death of them. The Alchemicals only seem to be able to manage it because they were made to do so, and even then we've only found rubble when they die. Well. Except for that one time."

Benford says, "I am curious about something, though. When we found you, Marlene, it was at your apartment, some blocks from the physical location where you accessed the Lands of Light. That means there was a portal near your home. We're still unclear on the circumstances that can create a portal, but... we know that an Exaltation can do so. Is that what happened? Or did you find it by some other means?"

Marlene shrugs. "You think I just stay at the places where Assembled congregate? Do you think I'm stupid? I went home."

"These places are wherever they come together and work, yes? If there is an Exaltation, and there is a way to the Lands of Light, of course there is - because they study the Exaltation."

Benford nods. "Yes... I hadn't considered that. Well. Seeing as there is no impending doom known to me at this time, it seems right to ask, now what?"

Morgan rubs his chin. "Well, being back on this side of the pond reminds me of something we were looking into once before." He glances at Benford. "You still remember the telemetry coordinates to Ranapura, I assume," he says. It is a statement, not a question - absolute faith in the caste of scholarship and knowledge. "I think it's time we find out more about that."

"Yes," Benford says slowly. "And there's the small problem of it being out around the orbit of the Moon. A tad beyond our grasp at the moment. Our physical grasp, anyway."

"But what's the range of magic?" asks Morgan. "That thing was huge. And it may not be a matter of us reaching it, but it reaching us - I'm sure there are magical artifacts aboard that could spot a Solar from two hundred thousand miles away. They just have to know where to look."

"Now you're the expert, not me," continues the reporter. "But there are two things that I know we'll need for sure. We need to get a fix on _it_ - for that, we need your coordinates, and perhaps a telescope, so that we can see it clearly. And the other thing we need..." He taps his forehead.

Benford's eyes widen. "Oh, dear. I see where this is going. Well. CERN has telescopes, to be sure; and there's more than a few near Tijuana, as well. Take your pick; any large astronomical telescope should do."

The gang of Exalts arrives in Geneva quite late, and at the gates of CERN even later. However, Benford's reputation as the inventor of practical fusion has impressed even the guards at the gate, and so there are few questions. Their destination, however, is not the offices or dormitories.

CERN is not known as an astronomy lab. The biggest "telescope" is a shielded array of magnets, and like so many other things, it's looking for high-energy particles, not visible light. However, there's more than one hobbyist observatory and various telescopes for aligning other instruments, and it is one of these that Benford borrows for Poe's experiment.

As the Axial Solar Telescope is an instrument for daylight observations, its building is mostly abandoned at night, so the Exalts will have privacy while they work. With the telescope aligned at the co-ordinates and the barest distortion in space visible through the eyepiece, it's just a matter of doing the thing. Benford pauses as he prepares to press his forehead to the eyepiece, which looks archaic and out of place among the high-speed cameras and precision machinery. "This feels a little daft."

"The telescope is aimed properly," says Morgan. "There _must_ be a connection now between Ranapura and this telescope, a metaphorical one, at least. If we've worked out the right way of doing it, your Caste Mark will lend Essence to that connection, energize it. And Ranapura will know that a Solar seeks to make contact."

Benford shrugs and presses his forehead to the eyepiece, willing his caste mark to light. The divine light is pumped towards the anchoring point of Ranapura, thirty thousand miles distant; and then it's gone again, fading rapidly as Essence does on Earth. Benford presses his eye back to the lens, searching for a detectable effect with both vision and will.

Benford can see the light streaming from his forehead. The light grows brighter - even brighter than he is creating himself - and he realizes that it is coming now _from_ the telescope. He steps back. And from the instrument there pours a curtain of light, coalescing into a shape. It is a pair of children, radiant with the Sun's light, shimmering and smiling. One boy and one girl, and they speak at once.

"Thank you for making contact!"

Benford realizes that, once again, the result is totally contrary to anticipation. He isn't sure what he expected, but this wasn't it. "I'm Benford," he begins. "This is Andrew Morgan, Marlene, and Luther." He almost says "Welcome to Earth;" but for once, he needs to live up to the bearing of a Solar.

Morgan illuminates his own Caste mark, so that the figures will recognize his station. "Greetings," he says. "You represent Ranapura?" he says, though this hardly needs confirmation. "What can you tell us of Ranapura's purpose in being sent to Gaia?"

"We are the images of Vaila and Varlo," the children explain, smiling, each pointing to the girl and then the boy. "It was great-grandfather who built Ranapura. When the Deliberative made its decision, it was decided that if they could only send one thing to Earth, they would send Ranapura. And they only _could_ send one thing."

Benford says, "Well met, then. We'll leave aside why they could only send one thing here; and ask, why, of all the wonders of Creation, do they send that one?"

"It was the only mobile city they could spare," the children answer, looking down and shuffling their feet in minor embarrassment. "Sorry."

"I don't think you need to apologize. We have perservered with lesser wonders for many years," Benford explains. "This may be awkward to ask, but you introduced yourselves as images... what does that mean?"

"We're the personalities and pictures of Vaila and Varlo. We're part of the animating intelligence of Ranapura." The children smile. "Oh! We have some news for you. It concerns the Essence level of the world. We were waiting to tell someone about this."

Morgan blinks. _Sensitive magical equipment indeed,_ he thinks to himself. "What is it?"

Varlo takes out a glowing chalkboard and starts writing on it, while Vaila explains. "Here.." The child draws a diagonal line across the board, then a horizontal line intersecting it. "This is the Essence level of Earth, here. It's growing quite steadily. And this line here... is the projected um... what's the word?" Vaila tugs at Varlo's sleeve. The boy scratches his head. "'Boundary condition'?"

Benford says, "'Boundary condition', yes, that's the word for what you're sketching, but... umm... boundary condition of what? What changes?"

"Anyway! So, there's only so much Essence in the system. And as more appears, the world will start to become unstable. Not like it'll fall apart, only it'll .... change." The boy and girl nod at each other in agreement.

"That's why Ranapura is important. It was rebuilt with Essence balancers and a refab.. refusal.. refactorizer."

Morgan frowns. "A state change. Like ice melting into a liquid. Only... in this case it's our whole world." He looks at Benford. "This is going to make the Alchemical invasion look like kindergarten at recess. Or kick it into high gear." Looking at Ranapura's images again: "And what do those do?"

Vaila thinks. "Great-grandpa said that it would maintain the Creation paradigm within the city limits. And you could set up outposts of stability too."

Benford is silent for long moments as he traces the curve on the blackboard; the children have omitted the time scale. Finally, he simply asks, "How long?"

Varlo speaks up, as he erases the chalkboard and starts drawing again. "According to this, the change is tied to Earth's natural cycles. So um, you should expect to see a state shift every year. On whatever you guys use for Calibration."

The boy's diagram is nearly complete. "So what'll probably happen is a contraction of Earth's natural Essence as pressure from outside increases."

Benford says, "And that would be on the Solstices, then, the shortest day of the year here. We felt something odd that day in Tijuana. I had thought perhaps that it was just His Brightness showing up to cheer us on." Benford looks over the new diagram. "Contraction of Essence means more Essence locally... umm... wait, what pressure from outside? You mean the Alchemicals?"

"From anywhere. Other realms, other worlds. The Void outside."

"So you don't know from where, yet," Morgan says. "And I think we'll need to find out. Just islands of stability is going to be a stopgap." He scratches his head. "Which means we're going to need to get some Solars working on the problem. And I think they're going to need your instruments, too. I don't think they're going to be able to do much to figure out trans-world Essence balance with the magical equivalent of stone knives and bearskins."

Benford says, "It's not just where it's coming from. Why now? This place has been a refuge for thousands of years, right? And thousands of Solstices have passed with no cosmological change. So do you know why this is the time?"

"It's you," the children say in unison. "It's the Celestials."

Benford looks over his allies, including the still-silent Klein/Marlene. "Yeah," he says. "It would be."

Varlo shakes his head. "It's not that simple. You're fighting a Primordial, right? To do that you need Essence. So... umm. You made it happen. We don't know how. But we know it's you."

"Oh! Well, that's easy, then," says Morgan, grimacing. "We just need to show the Alchemicals the door, do whatever else we think we _have_ to do here, and get out. It's just that the longer it takes us to do it, the more unstable the world gets." He looks at the diagram, with the steadily increasing Essence line. "I guess that means we're on a timetable. On the other hand..." He looks at the twins. "If there is more Essence in the world, does that mean we will gain more access to it?"

"It means you can learn to access it, yes. With mastery of Essence you can shape - or destroy - mountains. You can battle gods. You can transform yourselves. You can fight armies. And you'll need that power."

_It's not just that, either,_ Benford thinks. _We're opposing a Primordial. If we win, the world isn't just going to go back to paychecks and football like nothing happened. And if we lose..._ "Children, I think we need to arrange for you to bring your city to Earth. We have allies in a place called Tijuana. Do you know where that is?"

"I think we can find it, yes. There's just one problem. We'll speak with any Exalt, but.. we need to know that you're united." The children smile a little nervously, but continue on. "Eight Solars, eight Lunars, and eight Sidereals must pray to the god of Ranapura in harmony before we're allowed to move."

Benford says, "I suppose that means that we need to have all our allies in one place, then."

Morgan raises an eyebrow, disappointed but not surprised. "I should think we'd need at least that many to make proper use of you in any case. Very well, then." He looks around. "Is there anything else?"

"Yes. Some of our systems are kind of, um, broken. We have tools on board, but we'll need your help to put it all right."

Benford raises an eyebrow. "Before you come to Earth, or after?"

"Whenever is good!" the girl chirps.

"Well, as long as your motive power is all right, it'll probably be easier to repair you when you get here," says Morgan. "Other than that, we're going to build a rocket," he adds, gesturing to the Essence graph, "and I don't know if we have time."

Benford says, "One other thing. Is this the first time that anyone from Earth has contacted you?"

The children nod and smile. "Yes! You're the first."

Benford says, "If anyone thinks to ring you up, we could use more allies. So how can we contact you again, besides the prayer ritual?"

"You can still pray to Ranapura and get a response," the children say. "We'll teach you the prayer, of course."

Benford nods. "Yes, thank you."

The prayer itself is a short, but specific recital in Old Realm. The children repeat it enough times for the Celestials to memorize it and repeat it back.

When the Solars return to Tijuana they are met by Charity, the Ivanova twins, and a small honor guard of local police hand-picked by the Lunar. While Newton and Poe are probably used to the sort of deadly events that justify this kind of entourage, Marlene is likely not. The Lunar smiles in relief at the sight of her friends, but her first words are for Marlene. The Lunar even bows, "Welcome to Tijuana, dear. I have done all I can to prepare things for you, so let's get you settled-in and comfortable." Charity smiles at the Solars and says, "We have a lot to talk about. I trust you two found some use for yourselves between weekends on the slopes." A lame joke any other time, it draws a laugh now. "I've had a vision and I want to share it with all of you," Charity says more seriously. "This isn't the place for it."

Benford murmurs to Poe, "Is it just me or does she seem more... regal?"

Morgan smiles. "I think she's found herself," he says quietly. Aloud, he says, "We also have important news. It sounds like we've all got a lot to talk about. Shall we?"
