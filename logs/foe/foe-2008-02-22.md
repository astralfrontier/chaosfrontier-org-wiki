# Fall of Eden 2008-02-22

Saint Death has invited Charity, Morgan, and the Man to Barry's office. As the Solar and Lunar arrive, they behold an interesting sight indeed. The woman has kicked over Barry's desk and is screaming at him. "Stop interfering with this! You know _nothing_ about how these people work! This is what they _want_! This is what _we_ _need_! Quit being such a....." The Abyssal pauses for words. "American!"

Barry, sitting without a boundary between himself and his challenger, has his usual placid expression. His hands are folded around one knee, and he's leaning forward ever so slightly, reflecting attentiveness in his body language. As silence resumes for a moment, he takes the opportunity. "All I'm saying is that we should examine the dangers.."

Charity raises an eyebrow, not sure whether she should be alarmed, angry, or simply curious. She looks from Barry to Saint Death and asks softly, "Should we come back later?"

"NO!" "No.." Saint Death stares at Barry. The man smiles and speaks. "This concerns you, though I wish it had been handled in a more, hmm, coordinated fashion. I'll let Diana explain her position."

Somewhat mollified, the former journalist nods and straightens herself out. Her poise and cold elegance begin to assert themselves, replacing anger. "It has to do with my persona as Saint Death and the benefits I've enjoyed from it. Come. I'll show you. All of you."

She leads the way; the others follow. Through the streets of Tijuana and to a warehouse on the edge of town. A few people are milling around outside. They cross themselves as they see the Celestials approach. Inside is what Charity and Morgan recognize as the shrine of a saint. What they also recognize are the photographs and replica statues that have been erected around the altar. It's them and their allies. This is a place of worship for the Circle.

"I do not understand," admits Charity quietly. "These statues.. they are of us." The Lunar shifts slightly on her feet, ill at ease with the idea of being worshipped. "What do you want to show us, Diana?"

Morgan almost, but not quite, manages not to be surprised. "I'm pretty sure we haven't been officially recognized in Rome," he says softly. "I'm equally sure it doesn't really matter, when you come right down to it."

"This." Saint Death sweeps a hand around the shrine. "This is what we ought to embrace. Do you know what happens when the people say their prayers to Santa Muerte? It gives me power. _Me_. Their Essence comes to me. It's just a trickle, but it's something."

Morgan turns to Barry. "And what dangers do you see?"

The Chosen of Endings shakes his head. "We're too new to this world to really meddle with this sort of thing. Perhaps these prayers can be used to track us. Perhaps there's some hidden danger in Gaia's design. This sort of thing was done in Creation, but... we should investigate before proceeding."

"We don't have time for such foot-dragging," says Charity gently. "We must take the risk, I think. Our enemy has every advantage over us, but I do not think the people will adore them."

The Man, who has remained silent so far, now speaks. "Hey Barry? You're a fucking idiot. Now shut up." He points at Diana. "He's right. There might have been dangers. You're lucky there aren't. I'll tell you guys why since I don't want any more of this bullshit arguing."

"You guys know that Supervisor you met in the Core? Yeah. Well, he's not allowed to feed that kind of information to the Alchemicals. End of story."

Both Barry and Diana look chastened. The Abyssal recovers first, or at least has something to say. "Fine. Then we'll let them say their prayers."

"Well, now that we have that settled.. perhaps someone can help convince me that it's okay for people to worship me like some sort of saint," says Charity. "I understand the reason, but I am unsure. I serve a Goddess, will those praying to me also be gaining her favor?"

"For me, it's even simpler," says Poe. "Among these people, they _know_ we are more than mortal. We can't deny it. And humans _will_ worship gods or those who work on their behalf. The only thing you could even possibly do to stop it is to tell people to pray to the Sun and Moon and Stars instead. And even then..." He chuckles. "The Catholics came up with the idea already, did they not? There is one God who is to be worshipped, and his saints to be revered."

The Man shrugs. "They pray to gain _your_ favor. How do you think this works anyway?"

"I don't know," answers Charity. "Will I hear their prayers, somehow? I want to help them."

The Sidereal shakes his head. "No. You guys aren't set up, not without the Word. And that takes a sorcerer to wield. But, Esperanzita can. If you want to work with me to file the paperwork, we'll route your prayers to her."

Morgan nods. "That seems fair. I think some of that must be leaking through already. I remember Benford telling us a while back that she tried to appear in his dreams with a message."

"She dressed up in an angel costume and dragged some lamps into his bedroom," Diana says. She suppresses a chuckle. "I heard about that."

Morgan can't help but smile a little himself. "I think we should talk to her before we dump this town's prayers on her, then. I wouldn't want to have to put her through that again."

The Man shakes his head. "Talk to her and say what? 'Hey, City Mother, would you like to be City Mother?' Spirits don't work that way. They are what they are."

Morgan rolls his eyes at the Man. "Well, since you know so much about how this works, what I _mean_ is, make sure she doesn't feel she has to do things in a way that won't work here."

"I think the prayers might strengthen her," says Charity. "If they grant power, anyway. I had another question about, well, power. I need help and I have a theory of sorts."

"Spit it out," suggests the Man, in his usual empathic style.

"Well, a few weeks back I attempted to increase my ability to control essence," says Charity. "As you probably guess, I failed spectacularly. However, I have been thinking about why I failed and how to get around it. There just isn't enough essence here to draw upon for this kind of activity. My theory is that if I could build a containment room of some kind and flood it with enough essence to make it like Creation, I could do what I need to do inside."

The Man nods. "Okay? So, go do that."

"I would, but I need help. I need someone to help me build this containment room and I need a way to concentrate that much essence." Charity looks to Diana and then to the statues, "I may have found a way to work on the essence angle."

Diana nods slowly. The Man laughs. "Good luck. The only people who will have parts like that are the Alchemicals. But hey, if you salvage enough, who knows?"

"True," says Charity softly. "But if they have that, we need to get it for ourselves. Mastery of essence is an advantage we cannot hope to counter with simple tricks. We need to unlock our full potential to have any hope in the war that is coming."

"And if they have that sort of thing," Morgan adds, "it's a deadly advantage over us in their hands, and all the more vital that we take it away from them."

"I must find it, and wrest it from them," says Charity. "At least I won't be bored."

Morgan is still staring at the shrine, seemingly lost in thought. Finally, he speaks up. "There is a truth here. We gain some measure of power from it. But is it the whole truth? Do these people know what we're up against?"

"Doubtful," the Man observes, probably uselessly. "They don't want to know, they don't care to know, and that's why they pray. They want someone in charge who will sort the world's problems out for them. So they can get back to their own problems."

"You don't give them a lot of credit," says Charity. "If we are fighting to protect humanity, shouldn't we value it a little bit more than that?"

The Man laughs. "Have you ever _heard_ a human prayer? Really heard it? Not 'our father which art...' I mean what they actually say." He looks Charity in the eye, and the Lunar finds herself sinking into the starry ocean there. His gaze becomes more and more intense. "Listen to it sometime. Listen to what they say."

"'Oh god, don't let him find out.' 'That fucker cut me off. I wish he was dead.' 'She's such a bitch. God, why does she have to be such a fucking bitch?'" The Sidereal recites his litany in a sing-song voice. "'The world is so unfair, I hate it.' 'I wish my baby would stop crying. Makes me so angry, I want to just slap him. Please, God, please don't let me do that.'"

"'Allah, I love her but I don't want to sin. Please make her go away." Other gods, other voices, are finding their way into his performance. "'Will I really go to hell if I do this? I hate you, Lord.' 'God, thank you so much for saving that woman's life.'"

The Man steps back, looking at Charity. "You hear a lot of calls for world peace and human happiness in there?"

"No, but I think they do exist," replies Charity. "We are all selfish and short-sighted at times, some of us even quite often, but I believe there are prayers for wisdom, for hope, and yes, even for an end to war and suffering."

"So fine," says Morgan, still staring at the shrine. "If they want someone to be in charge of the world's problems, then that's what they'll get. But they'll still need to help. And before they can do that, they need to know what the problems are. And why it is, or will be, _their_ problem if they don't do anything about it."

The Sidereal holds up a hand. "It's not selfishness. It's a lack of power. That's why they give their power to you, through prayer. You, who can do something about it."

"And yeah. Maybe they deserve to know. But unless you give them a source of hope to go with this new problem, they're going to feel pretty impotent."

"Yes," Morgan says. "The Assembled are the problem. We are the solution. You can't tell people about one without the other."

"We will be their hope," says Charity. "If they want us to be their champions, that is what we will be. It's clearly what we were made for. We all will fight the battle that is coming in our own way."

"Well then? Go be heroes." The Man smiles. Barry begins to speak. He's cut off by the Man, extending a finger right into his face, who begins to say something probably very rude, then reconsiders. He withdraws the finger, and Barry continues. "Andrew, the world is full of transitions and endings. Right now, people don't know. Perhaps both of you like the world as it is. But just remember that it can't last. We can't put things back the way they were. But we can be the agents of the transition."

"I think any hope of getting back to Kansas vanished when the Assembled decided to invade Gaia," agrees Charity. "So let's wake the people up to the truth and see what happens. It will take one hell of a convincing presentation to make them believe, though. Fortunately, I know a writer who might be able to pull-off such an absurdly difficult task."

Morgan just grins.

Morgan then shakes his head. "That's not the hard part, actually. The hard part is getting people to believe and _not panic_." He rubs his hands together and cracks his knuckles. "_That_ part is what's going to have me burning the midnight oil."

"Hey I got a question." The Man smiles. "Say they panic. So what? No, really. Not a rhetorical question. So what?"

"We might have madness like the inquisition," says Charity soberly. "Or some idiots might decide it's time to use nuclear weapons."

"And there's chaos and rioting in the streets and it's hard to get anything useful done," Morgan says. "And someone might decide it's time to use nuclear weapons _before_ it's time to use nuclear weapons, rather than _when_ it's time to use nuclear weapons." He scratches his head. "It's probably next to impossible to stop panic completely... I was going to say impossible, then I remembered myself," he adds, grinning. "But... what did you say just now? There needs to be some hope, too. As long as there's some hope, the panic will subside."

The Man nods. "Okay. Panic in the streets. Right. But the story doesn't end there. You gotta consider what happens _after_."

"Well, I didn't just grab my phone just now and call the local TV station so I could flash them my Caste Mark," says Morgan. "And that's because I _haven't_ considered that yet, not in enough detail. I know I want the world to band together with us against the Assembled, but a lot more is going to happen than that. This, for example," he says, gesturing to the shrine, "only on a much larger scale, and much more out of our control."

The Man nods again. "Right. 'Panic in the streets, oh shit nukes' is not the end. It's just an event that happens. So keep thinking like that."

"People will need to know, 'well, what can _I_ do about the Assembled?'" Morgan goes on. "How can I tell the enemy who walks among us, and what could I do about it if I found him? Ordinary people can't stand up against them, after all. Even a SWAT team would be in big trouble against one or two, and that's if they found one... and if the team weren't infiltrated. They'll need some _practical_ guidance."

"How about duct tape on the windows?" the Man asks, keeping a straight face in spite of the obviously sarcastic question. "Just think of it like international nuclear terrorism. How do people handle _that_? I mean properly."

Morgan chuckles. "In this case, security theater can have some real effects, if it's handled right," he says, nodding to the shrine again. "And the Essence doesn't have to be directed our way. Is this world's Essence strong enough for mortal thaumaturgy? Even if it isn't, maybe some clever Twilight can do some research in advance so that he has a head start on it when the phase change happens."

The Man nods. "And, you know... you could just rig it so people know to pray to you for help."

Morgan nods. "Our tiny Circle will be run ragged if we have to handle a whole world's prayers, but I suspect it won't be just our Circle for long when we go public. I don't mind sharing the Essence as long as we get to share the workload too. And if other Celestials do come forward, well, it'll be that much easier to summon Ranapura."

"All this will require a lot of strength," says Charity. "I do not know if I'll have time to dabble in my earlier plan. Is it possible to reach a place with more essence by travelling through the Lands of Light?"

"Don't see why not.." The Sidereal thinks a moment. "If you can get there, and you can find another way out, I don't see why not."

"Then that is the most direct route to my goal," says Charity. "I must find a place where there is essence and return ready to guide others on the path."

"Then quit slacking and go do it," the Man suggests wryly.

Charity smiles and looks to Diana, "Keep Poe from shooting himself in the foot. I'll bring you back a gift from wherever the hell it is I wind up going."
