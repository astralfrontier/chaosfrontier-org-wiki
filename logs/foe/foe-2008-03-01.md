# Fall of Eden 2008-03-01

Cam is constructed, not out of commodity Earth parts such as a motorcycle or an air conditioner, but out of something rather more sophisticated: transtechnology, which he defines as "technology in excess of what Gaian Essence is capable of manufacturing". It quite logically follows that if he couldn't be manufactured on Earth, his parts had to make the journey from Autochthonia somehow. It falls to Charity to make another journey, but in the opposite direction.

A few experiments satisfy her that the Lands of Light themselves are insufficient to the task. Plugging in to an access point does not take the soul to that other existence; instead, the symbiote mediates the experience, providing an exploring Exalt with what is essentially a very convincing illusion. Charity can assert her existence as an Exalt via her Caste Mark, but true Essence manipulation is beyond her.

Cam won't reveal the entrance point the Alchemicals use. But he knows of a way, and Charity finds an unlikely ally and an unlikely first destination: the Man, who tells her of a sunken city off the coast of India, discovered only a few years ago.

"That place should have stayed lost," he mutters darkly. "But now that it's been found, you had better get the important things from the ruins." He takes a few minutes to sketch out a city map, and marks a place called 'the First Pillar' on the drawing. "Go there with a shape that has sonar," he advises. "Once you get inside, start pinging. You'll know what you're looking for when you find it."

He has one more gift. It's a plain-looking key, a bronze antique with an unfinished feel to it. "This is the Key of Impossibilities. It's an old relic. No magic to it, just history. It's important that you keep it with you. With this key, and with what you find in the ruins, Cam will be able to help you."

Charity sighs softly, looking at the key and taking it. Looking more than a little sulky. "So I have to kill a dolphin," she says glumly. She can already feel little children all over the world tugging at her sleeve and looking up at her with teary eyes. "I will do what must be done." She doesn't have to like it.

Charity takes the key and offers it to Cam. "Can you dive?" she asks seriously. She hasn't a clue, honestly. She's never really thought about it before. "If not, we'll have to figure that little challenge out. As for me, I have to hit the coast and go hunting. Looks like I have to kill Flipper and while I'm at it I might as well get Willy, too."

Cam frowns. "I can dive, sure," he says. "But I don't think I could keep up with a dolphin, and you don't sound like you want to kill one." But Cam knows that, if sonar is a necessity, Charity can't afford to be sqeamish about it. "It's necessary," he says softly. "Don't make a bad habit of recriminations."

"I'll survive it," says Charity. "I think as long as I am a little uncomfortable with it I'm still alright, you know? It's when it becomes easy as breathing that it's time for me to take a step back and consider what the hell I'm doing." She pauses to think a moment, "I suppose we could stop at a likely place on the way. Where's a good haunt for dolphins and orca?"

"Most of the beaches, around here," Cam opines. "Tourists go swimming with dolphins all the time."

"Then it's time for me to go fishing," decides Charity. "If someone could get a boat to help my hunting that would be great. I'll be skyward. I don't suppose we could rig a speaker to relay me messages in every form?"

After a bit of discussion Cam arranges a more simple idea. Using flashes of light and a rather dumbed-down system of morse code critical messages can be relayed to Charity as she patrols the skies. All that remains then is the hunt.

The selected day is clear and grants amazing visibility. Charity is able to see for miles. The first objective for Charity is the part she imagines will be easiest. Find a dolphin. In these waters she imagines it will be quick and easy. All she has to do is trust instinct.

The Lunar doesn't see the blue glimmering waves as she once did. To her eyes the currents are as palpable as the winds that swirl around her. She can feel the slight changes in ocean temperature from above and quickly gains a sense of where the richest waters will be. It is those waters that will attract the dolphins she seeks.

Cam follows in a small fishing boat. Radio chatter leads him to an area of dolphin sightings; and Charity's natural senses do the rest. Cam himself waits on the deck in a wet suit, and weight belt, requiring little more to be the backup diver. The hunt is Jet's priveleged territory, and he doesn't want to interfere. But he recalls the original phrase for which 'Killer Whale' is a contraction: 'Killer of Whales', and pats the gun case borrowed from the missing Doctor Benford's armory.

There! With a triumphant call the eagle dives downward. The wind rushes past and at the very last moment Charity shifts her forms, falling upon the dolphin not as an eagle, but as siberian tiger. The force of the initial impact is tremendous and carries both attacker and prey beneath the waves. Caught off-guard and facing an enemy outside its experience makes the battle fast. The water does not turn red, but in moments Charity emerges, swimming swiftly towards the boat. She'll need to be much better prepared for the next phase of the hunt. "Any sign of one yet?" she asks as she pulls herself onto the boat.

Cam checks a notepad. "There's a few, strayed from a pod near San Diego. This is going to be dangerous, Charity." Cam is genuinely worried.

"Yes, it will be," says Charity. She almost sounds excited. "I read about them. They can kill blue whales." She's fascinated, and she also has a strange impression of the beasts that draws her to them. For whatever reason, she feels she must defeat the mighty creature. "I know what I'm going to do, though. I think it will work. I just have to end the fight really fast."

Cam nods. "As you wish, then."

The hunt continues. This time Charity does not leave the boat, but waits patiently. She knows what is coming, and knows what she will do. It's absurdly dangerous, but that defines her nature. It is not the risk that draws her interest, but the knowledge that passing this test will be one more step into becoming what she wishes to be. What the world itself needs. When the orca's spray can be seen ahead she smiles, looking over her weapon slowly. "We were not crafted for peaceful times," she whispers to it softly.

"Amen," Cam whispers.

The orca is not afraid of the ship, which allows Charity to draw closer and closer. She watches the movements of the great beast with interest. She can feel its tension. It's a lost bull and it's angry. When at last it is time Charity's anima flares to life around her and she races towards the front of the ship. With a collosal leap she launches herself skyward and towards her prey. Her weapon is raised and brought down into the beast with a thunderous crunch of breaking bones.

But the orca is no helpless victim. It thrashes in the water, its tail a weapon every bit as lethal as its bite. With silent malice it strikes back, lashing out at the lunar with a swift strike of its tail.

Charity moves smoothly in the water, not to avoid the blow, but to catch it squarely with both feet. The force of it nearly breaks her legs, but the body of the Lunar withstands the blow which rockets her out of the water. For a moment she hangs there, glittering like a star descending from the heavens, and then she plummets downward, where the whale is ready. It leaps upward beneath her, its jaws thrown wide to swallow the enemy.

Instinct does not scream, but whisper gently to the Full Moon. She twists her wrist, holding her weapon in one arm. As she descents into the belly of the beast it hooks into both sides of the whale's jaw. With a roar from inside the Lunar gathers all her power around her. Essence explodes outward as she directs every ounce of her power into a strike from inside the beast.

Cam tightens his grip on Reason as he sees Charity disappear inside the beast; the noise and the spray are chaotic, deafening. The shotgun snaps to his shoulder and he takes aim; then relaxes his trigger finger. _Have faith in her,_ he thinks.

The orca throws itself wildly in the water as it feels its sinews pounded asunder from within. Blow after blow is delivered and at last the jaws are forced open as Charity's legs prove the stronger. With water rushing around her the Lunar rips free her weapon and with one last exertion of her divine strength she drives The Major through the flesh of the beast, shredding its heart and turning the waters red.

In its death throes the orca becomes a maelstrom and with Charity still inside it plunges below the waves. Several tense seconds pass, and then the Lunar pulls herself up onto the ship once more, a long, bloody gash turning her side red. "It is done."

Cam is ready with a large wool blanket and helps Charity aboard. "That was hard to watch," he says. "Let's get ashore and have that wound tended."

---

The trip to Mahabalipuram is uneventful. Cam's aegis of non-interference once again seems to protect Charity. The India that she finds upon landing is as much a thing of contrasts as she is herself. Poverty, technology, hope, despair, warfare, peace, modernity, and ancient history. All these things burn together in the kiln of the subcontinent's turbulent existence.

It's not difficult to locate the best place to sail out to the sunken city - or at least where to leap off from the beach into the water. Getting there calls for transportation, which calls for money, and Charity finds herself adjusting to the starkly different economic realities of India.

The villages on the coast of northwestern India are a far cry from the garish night spots of Tijuana. They're further still from Mark Williams' quiet house in the suburbs, in a reminder that all prosperity is relative. The sunken city remained undiscovered for so long is chiefly because nobody thinks they can get rich here, and to Cam's eyes, it seems that they're right.

Still, that has its advantages. The westerners will draw stares, but not much in the way of interference.

Seeing as she doesn't know how long they will be away, Charity recommends a cheap boat be rented. It doesn't need many frills, just to move and float will do. Once out to the ruins she won't be using it anyway.

Real boats are a capital item here, so the 'boat' that the locals will part with is a uniquely Indian concoction of old and new: the hull is made of hewn planks, but the outriggers are supplemented with steel oil barrels, evacuated and sealed. Some of the lines are nylon, and others are hemp. The anchor looks like it used to be part of a truck transmission.

Charity grins and makes sure Cam has the key with him. You know, can't be too safe with that sort of thing. With this requirement satisfied, she jumped into the water, taking the skin of a dolphin and rushing through the water. She can't help but love the experience, leaping out of the water and splashing as much as possible for a few minutes. She has to make sure she's fully adjusted to her new form, after all.

Cam jumps in soon after, wearing a wet suit, fins, and weight belt. Notably absent is the bulky breathing gear that divers usually wear, for Cam doesn't need to breathe; he simply feels better when he does. In this case, though, expedience is given priority, and free of such contraptions, he follows Jet with smooth, powerful kicks. He pulls a flare from the sack at his belt and lights it, both as an aid to vision and as a signal to any nearby marine life: don't mess with me.

Geology's hand has caressed the ocean floor since time began. The smooth shapes and organic flows have a distinct texture to Charity's sonar. She searches her instinct for a way to understand it, and the dolphin-voice inside her tells her that this is the World Song. One sings and the world answers. Sometimes it is in harmony, sometimes in dissonance, and sometimes one hears a song that one did not create. Her Exalted mentor smiles within her soul: "yes, that is what Destiny is." And in time, the song of the world changes from the ancient rondo of geological process to the strident march of geometric shape. She has found the city.

Compared to sight by light, the city is an illusory world of smoke and mirrors. Charity finds herself able to see around corners and through objects that block her eyes, via echoes. And at other times, the caprices of the ocean currents make a place blurry or even invisible to her.

The city has lain here, submerged, for uncountable millennia. It has been dated at almost 10,000 years old. How long might people have lived here before some unthinkable catastrophe laid them low? In Indian legend, the first avatar of Vishnu encountered a fish, which warned him of a deluge that was to wipe out all life. The Chibcha and Muisca of Colombia told of a geat flood that wiped out nearly all of mankind, and Bochica the savior of life. The discovery of this city has done much to legitimize research into the preponderance of Deluge myths from widely separated cultures.

Charity finds the temple of the first Pillar, just as the Man said. Curious that he should know such things, and more curious that his knowledge is so specific. And as her sonar sweeps through the interior of the temple, she can hear an answering sound. It is not just the echo of her own sonar. It is a song, emanating from a specific point. The Lunar draws closer. Laying on the ground amidst rubble is an egg-shaped object which shimmers in the dim light.

Cam approaches and lays down the flare for a closer look. The object is metallic, and would be unremarkable, except for its position in a ruin older than recorded history. Cam knows that few metals can survive that long in a salt ocean. Jet circles nearby, lithe and delphine, so Cam must be her hands. He draws the Man's old key, thinking that somewhere nearby, there must be a keyhole.

What Cam discovers is that the egg has a keyhole in itself. And by examination, he realizes something else. The egg is made of a material called adamant. It is not found on Earth; this is Autochthonian workmanship, and extremely old.

Cam holds up the egg and key, making a turning motion. He knows that his sister will understand; and yet she stays nearby, indicating that they should proceed.

Cam carefully inserts the key. It is no accident that there is an Autochthonian artifact here; he senses the design of the Maker at work. It was meant to be here; and Charity was meant to find it. Whether the egg brings blessings or peril, to open it is in fulfillment of a purpose, and for that, Cam is grateful.

Both of the divers hear a distinct click. As the key turns, there are vibrations within the egg, sounding like a mechanism at work. The 'song' of the thing grows louder. Eventually the vibrations become noticeable; the egg agitates itself in Cam's hand.

The pair feel a sudden dropping sensation. Water splashes out away from them, leaving them unexpectedly dry. Charity finds herself flopping uselessly on a lukewarm plastic-like surface, and Cam manages to fall into a crouch and land on the floor which has come out of nowhere. The two are in a white room or antechamber of some kind, featureless. The water is draining itself away at the corners of the room, gurgling its way to an unknown destination.

Charity only flops for a moment, making a few indignant clicking noises before shifting forms once more. If a dolphin won't do, she hopes her normal human form will. She holds herself ready, looking around the room curiously.

The room looks on the order of twenty feet to a side, cubical in all dimensions. On closer inspection, the pair find a series of vents or grills at the edges of the room. Tiny hexagonal shapes form narrow meshes through which air (and water) freely flow. These gaps in the room's coverage aren't even large enough to reach a hand through.

The flare, like the rest of the city, is gone. Whatever happened took only Jet, Cam, and a bit of the sea-water around them, though they remain damp.

"Well, here we are," says Charity quietly. "Any idea where this place is?" She moves closer to the edge of the room, trying to see what lies beyond the mesh.

The mesh seems to lead into a narrow channel within the walls of the room; it's black, and Charity can feel a faint breeze coming from it. She finds something else as she looks at the walls, though - faint seams, perhaps outlining hatches or doors, on each of the six sides of the room.

Cam is glad that Charity is alright, and walks around the perimeter of the room, running a hand along the wall. "The Egg was transtech - of Autochthonian manufacture. This room feels familiar... but I don't remember ever being here before."

"Wherever this place is, it doesn't have what I'm looking for," says Charity. She shakes her head and examines a door. She might as well see how strong it is, unless she can find a locking mechanism to try and get past first.

Simply pressing forcefully on the plates seem to be sufficient. Since the only one in easy reach is on the floor, the two start there. It pushes outward, gliding on silent tracks. And as the two stare out at what's below them, they realize they've traveled far indeed.

Below them, and around them, is a vast space indeed. To the left and the right are richly-textured walls, more like cliff faces made of metal. And strung between them is a spiderweb of cables and filaments. Other cubes similar to their own can be seen suspended on this web. Some are moving along the threads like monorails; others are motionless. Light seems to filter from overhead, and the floor - if there is one - is too far away for the eye to see.

"Well, this is not what I had in mind," murmurs Charity. "Is this ringing any bells with you?" She doesn't feel any special guidance from instinct, so it seems she has never been here before.

Cam rocks back from the edge of the portal, sitting heavily on the floor; he could not have expected this. "Earth has its legends of Atlantis. The children of the Maker have their own legends, from when the worlds were new and the Father was closer to the affairs of man," he rattles off excitedly. "This place goes right back to the very beginning, into what we'd call Alchemical prehistory." He has another look over the edge, into the dizzying volume. "You've found our Atlantis."

Charity feels another presence, and turns. She sees someone she never expected to see again. It's Snake. He's wearing blue jeans and a white tank top, and his hair is slicked back. He's not dead. Nor does he have a sneer on his face. It's strange. "Yeah, thought so," he says at last. "Lands of Light. Bitchin."

Charity raises an eyebrow, "Well, I hope you are up to exploring a little." She's too happy to have her head to herself to worry that Snake is loose. "We need to find out where the hell we are. Oh, and does this mean you are actually alive again?" she asks curiously as she starts to climb out.

"Nah, still a dead soul Xerox stuck in your head," Snake deadpans. "Not like I can DIE, you know." And as if to prove it, he hops out of the hole in the floor and plummets downward. He manages to grab hold of one of the cables beneath the cube, and waves with his free hand. "You can probably fly!" he yells. "Gravity's just a policy here, not a law. Try it!"

"Well, since I can normally fly anyway," says Charity. She steps into the air, willing herself to fly. She isn't sure how it will work, or how far she can bend her reality. Curiously she presses against the bonds of reality, seeing just how easy it is to soar free of limits.

Gravity is a rule: bodies attract each other based on their intrinsic mass and the distance between them. These attributes are not physical properties in this cosmos of information. Remembering her physics, Jet finds that she's able to enforce her own ideas - quite a different sort of attraction between bodies than is her norm, but one that she's fully intelligent enough to handle.

Cam smiles. His sister seems fine, and he's been brought backstage into the very machinery of existence. He slips out from the cube, swinging from the rim of the hatch with superhuman grace to land on the wide web of cables nearby. "Life is good," he quips. "So... what are we looking for?"

"I have no idea," says Charity. "My suspicion is that this place may have more doorways. If we came in through one, perhaps if we use that egg in another it can lead us there? Barring that, it'd be great to find someone who knows what this all is." She looks to Snake, "You have any further clues?"

Snake shakes his head. "'S far as I know, you just picture where you want to be, and you're there, y'know?"

Cam carefully slips the egg and key into his bag, among a half-dozen now-useless flares. "If we're looking at the physical manifestation of the Lands of Light, then everything you can think of - literally - is represented here."

Charity pauses, focusing her mind for a moment. "I don't think I've got that one down," she says to Snake. "And I need to use this place to get to, well, a place where essence is present in greater levels."

"Do you know what that place looks like?" Snake asks.

"I'm trying to use memories from the past," explains Charity. "They aren't clear, but I've seen Creation in dreams. I know there is essence there."

Cam points to the next cube over. "There's an order to this place. It can't hurt to have a look at some more examples."

"Oi oi oi," calls a voice from outside the cube, and they hear footsteps along its surface. "This chamber is supposed to be in standby for another thirteen turns. You want to run something, you need to schedule it with-" The voice trails off as a face pokes around the corner, a handsome man with tanned skin and straight blonde hair. He looks astonished as he focuses on Cam and Charity. "What the- what are _you_ people doing here?"

Cam smiles wryly. "Or, we can just ask this fellow."

"Yes, that seems to work," agrees Charity. The Nightfang looks at the stranger and smiles, "Well, we're just floating about right now. Before we can decide what else we might do here, it would greatly benefit us to know where here is, and what kinds of things are done here."

"Why, it's the Lands of Light, of course," says the man, coming around the corner and walking into the room and standing on the far wall, looking down at the trio of figures - though from his own perspective he's looking up at them. "We run reality simulations here, in these chambers. Fortunately this one didn't seem to be in use, or who knows _what_ you might have ended up in."

"So how does one control one of these simulations?" asks Charity. "And why would you go through the trouble?"

"Well, that would be me," says the stranger. "I decide what's going to go in the cubes, and set it up for authorized users. As to why I would go to the trouble... well, why _wouldn't_ I?" He grins broadly. "Now!" he adds, slapping his hands together. "How did _you_... three... get here from where _you_ came from?"

"Well, we found an egg in the bottom of the ocean and opened it with a key," says Charity, as if it were the most logical of things. "And so here we are. Oh! And you run the simulations? Do you often have visitors requesting them?"

"Not from outside," says the man. "This is all for the locals." And he waves a hand, taking in the vast network of cables and boxes. "So someone left something behind? How untidy," he says, his eyes twinkling. "I'll have to ask around about that. Well, you're here now, might as well make the best of it. What are your names?"

"I'm Charity," says the Full Moon. "That's Snake down there, and this is my brother Cam." She raises an eyebrow and says, "I don't know if we were precisely left behind. I mean, we're real enough, aren't we? Or can you not tell if something is real or simulated here?"

The man laughs. "I didn't mean _you_, of course," he says, "And we're outside the cube, so of course you're real. I'm making what you might call an _educated guess_ about this egg of yours." He comes round the side of the cube and extends a hand. "My name's... well, you can call me Dave Bowman," he says.

"Dave Bowman, it's nice to meet you." Charity reaches out to take the offered hand, shaking it from an angle that is quite unusual, since her floating has taken her 'above' him again. "I think you might be just the one who can help us, Dave."

"Dave Bowman," Cam repeats. "You're human? But then, how long have you been here?"

"Long enough," says Dave. "I run the Lands of Light. You could say I'm a contractor."

"Charity," Cam murmurs. "Remember what the Supervisor mentioned, at CERN? About the... uh... big problem?"

"Yes, though my understanding is lacking," admits Charity. "But I think in any case, we must achieve our goal here." She frowns thoughtfully, "So Dave, we are seeking a way to resolve an issue and we need access to a place where there is a great deal of ambient essence. As the head of these facilities I trust you are familiar with what I am talking about."

Dave bursts into a broad grin. "Oh, is _that_ all you want," he says, laughing. "Simple enough request, isn't it. Gaia doesn't have enough Essence for you, is that it? Perhaps you'd like a moonsilver daiklave to take back with you while we're at it, eh?" He subsides to a chuckle. "Seriously, though, the Lands aren't set up to produce Essence overflows, certainly not in the quantities you'll need for what you have in mind. Oh yes, I think I can guess what you have in mind," he adds, winking at Charity. "Still, I might be able to make some arrangements. Mind telling me what the rush is, that you can't wait a few more months?"

Cam says, "We're given to understand that there's a problem with the Essence levels in Gaia, and that this place has something to do with managing that problem. We want to find a solution that doesn't involve lots of death and enslavement. Waiting doesn't seem prudent." He gestures towards Charity. "You've observed the behavior of Celestials, I'm sure. It's not in their nature to wait for circumstances to roll over them. Nor me, for that matter."

Dave laughs. "Don't get me started," he says, nodding. "Yes, that makes sense. You need to get a head start on the world. Well, let's see what we can do for you. Livia! We've got visitors!" he calls out, his voice taking on odd harmonics which Charity and Cam can feel with senses other than their ears.

A strange mark appears on the man's brow. It's not a typical Caste Mark; it's a rectangle with a circle embedded in it, with lettering: "Dave Bowman", it reads, and below that: "WIZARD".

In response, a fluttering of wings can be heard around the group. A handful of white feathers fall out of the air, seemingly from nowhere, and at the center of them a girl appears. She's cute, with an impish nose and infectious smile. "Hi there!" she says immediately, and enthusiastically.

"Um, hi," says Charity. "I take it you are Livia?" She only hazards a guess when it's fairly obvious, these days.

"Yep!" The girl pauses a moment, glancing at Dave. "Right?"

"A pleasure as always, _Livia_," says Dave, grinning as he emphasizes the name; apparently he's used to this sort of response from her. "This is Cam, and Charity, and Charity's pet ghost. Charity has a request for you, and she's going to need some help from beyond the Lands of Light to get it."

"Oh good!" Livia seems quite pleased by this turn of events. She looks right at Cam. "And you found the egg! I'm really happy. Did you like the music?"

Charity raises an eyebrow. Well, any port in a storm. "Yes, well, I am trying to find a place with more ambient essence." For reasons that Dave already understands. Charity truly hopes that suffices.

Cam looks perplexed for a moment, then understands. "Charity found the egg. I'm just carrying it, since she didn't have hands at the time."

Cam withdraws the egg from the bag and holds it up. "I was right," he grins. "It was meant to be found."

Livia thinks briefly. "Umm... hmm, well the Chief put together a list. Exploration sites, categorized by Essence level, amount of magical material, danger level, weirdness level.." She taps her chin, looking skyward. "I _guesssss_ I could ask if you could go along. And you _do_ have an Alchemical along with you, even though he's all weird and fleshy."

"The Chief?" asks Charity curiously. Now she knows she's entered the twilight zone. "So how do I get to go, and where am I going?" And why can't it just be a simple door that leads to her answer. She can never have a boring day, can she?

"Oof. You wound me, miss," Cam says. It's obvious that he doesn't really take offense, since there's something about this girl that reminds him of Jet's group of sisters and daughters.

"That's easy. We'll go to Autochthonia!" Livia grins, looking at Dave. "And you're coming along. I want you to meet the Chief. You keep telling me you'll come, but you never do."

Dave folds his arms. "You _know_ I've got my hands more than full here, Livia," he says, rolling his eyes and grinning. "Or rather, you would if you bothered remembering me say so for more than five minutes at a stretch. Fine, fine, I'll come. I'm sure the Lands of Light won't explode for five minutes. Besides, I can't wait to see what Charity here makes of Autochthonia."

Charity raises her eyebrows. Autochthonia? Why is this seeming so.. absurd? "To Autochthonia," she murmurs. _Well, any port in a storm_ she reminds herself stubbornly. "I am sure I'll find it quite charming." If she isn't killed, that is.

Cam puts his hand on Charity's shoulder. "Anything they might do to you, they've got to go through me first. But it won't come to that. I think that we're meant to do this."

"I'm not sure what we're meant to do," admits Charity. "I guess it doesn't really matter, either. I will do what I think is best. Whether destiny likes it or not, I will succeed."
