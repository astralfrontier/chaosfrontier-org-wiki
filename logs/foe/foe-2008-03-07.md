# Fall of Eden 2008-03-07

Dave Bowman leads the group to a translucent bubble suspended on one of the web-like strands that interconnect the vast space the group occupies. He passes effortlessly through the wall of the thing, and Livia follows. The others join him inside, and at a mental command, it begins to move along the thread like a cable car. As white cubes and stranger geometric shapes pass them by outside their peculiar vehicle, Livia speaks again.

"You never told me if you liked the music," she says, rather reproachfully, eyeing Charity.

Charity looks confused for a moment, then smiles at Livia. Always be nice to the ones who are trying to help you. Even if they are a bit off their rocker. "Oh, I.. I thought it was nice." She hopes that's adequate.

The sphere is carrying its passengers through a brushed-metal canyon of high walls, with a sourceless glow shining from above and an impenetrable darkness below. Here and there, forks in the canyon stretch off with their own spiderwebs. Dave Bowman seems preoccupied; it seems that he's steering the craft, and also somehow interacting with things or people invisible to the others.

"It's good music." Livia pouts a bit, looking away and folding her arms. "It brought you here, didn't it?"

"Yes, yes it did," says Charity quickly. "It's just not what I'm used to, dear." She keeps an eye on Dave, but it's useless. She is pretty sure there's no way for her to pilot that thing if he's not around. "I guess I am looking for something I can dance to."

Cam pulls the Adamant egg from its pouch. "If it was the song that brought us here," he ventures, "then this is merely the instrument?" He runs his fingers over the unfamiliar material. "Does it know any other tunes?"

"Oh! It's um, it's like a music box. The Alchemicals built it. It's magic and stuff. It's built to capture the Efficacious Songs." Livia's petulance has evaporated like a morning mist, leaving sunlight behind. "It's really clever. You wind it up and it plays the song back. Each one is only built for one song though."

"So when it plays the song it can also take us back?" asks Charity curiously. "I don't understand this kind of music."

Livia shakes her head. "No, but when we get to Autochthonia, we can see if the Chief will let me send you back," she offers.

"And I didn't hear it," Cam mentions. "Anyway, if they could get me to Earth, they can get us both back." He stows the egg again. "You've mentioned the Chief several times, but I haven't heard of him. How far up the chain of command do we have to go to find a peer?"

Livia shrugs winsomely. "I'm not sure. You seem so different from them. You don't have the.." She stops, thinking and searching for a word. "You don't have the same _limma_. And, I'm really sorry." She takes Cam's hand in her own, squeezing gently and looking at him with sad eyes. "I had hoped.. but I guess none of you ever will hear the song, after all. I'm sorry."

Charity looks from Livia to Cam and back. "What does it mean to hear the song? Why wouldn't they hear it?"

The girl shakes her head. "I wish I knew." She seems on the verge of bursting into tears. "Isn't it sad?"

Cam squeezes back, and frowns a little; this may be the first time he's ever felt a serious limitation of his capabilities, and it disturbs him. "The Solars say that nothing is inevitable," he says, leaving it at that.

"If anyone can change things, it is those dreamers," agrees Charity quietly. She does not know how, though. "Right now we can't worry about it. We have to do what must be done."

"You might mention it when you get back," says Dave. "Do you have any Twilights among you? If there's one thing they can't resist, it's a good hard puzzle." He rubs his chin. "Although for all I know, this might be more of a problem for an Eclipse." His name and title flickers upon his brow again as he stares off into space for a moment.

"We have someone who can turn to this," says Charity. She thinks, anyway. "There's a lot going on, and we're rather short on materials, so to speak. It's hard to handle so many challenges at the same time."

Cam glosses over the question. "Well, you seem to know a lot about this place, Dave," he ventures. "Wizard and Twilight are similar terms."

The sphere comes to a stop. The group looks up; the spider-silk thread they're currently following ascends almost straight into the sky. With a slight jerking motion, it begins to follow the thread, approaching the glorious, dazzling sky of white-gold.

"I suppose we'd have a lot in common," says Dave, nodding agreeably.

The brilliance of the sky dims. Not because it is any less bright, but because the travelers have become accustomed to it. Below them, they can see that the huge canyons they've been traversing are merely tiny halls in a Magic Labyrinth of unguessable size. It's like staring down at a planet, given the scale they're accustomed to. The sphere docks, finally, with a free-floating structure that looks like a Victorian mansion whose base tapers to a cone.

Cam reaches out and takes Jet's hand. "You okay?" he asks.

Charity nods quickly, "I think so. I just.. hope this works, that's all." She frowns, "I hope I haven't led you into a mess I can't get us out of."

Dave laughs brightly, as he leads the group off the platform. "Come now. A Lunar should be able to get out of anything. You'll be fine. This way," he adds. "Unless Livia wants to take us somewhere completely at random." This last is said as if he considers it a realistic possibility.

Cam says, "It will be okay. We're getting to see wonders that few people have even heard of, that can't be bad." After a pause he adds, "I wish Benford was here to see it. This seems like his kind of thing."

"I can't do that without the gate, you know," pouts Livia. "Dave, will you please signal for pickup?"

Dave chuckles. "Exactly," he says with some satisfaction, then turns out into open space. The words "DAVE BOWMAN - WIZARD" glow forth quite brightly indeed as he once again invokes his strange abilities.

"I wish he was, too," agrees Charity. She doesn't respond to Dave's comments. "Though I have a feeling if he were with us I bet he'd have managed to talk me out of something this crazy."

Without delay, a ring of light springs into existence a few feet away from Dave. It's about six feet in diameter. Livia grins and gestures. "All aboard for Autochthonia!" she announces.

Dave's lips twist in a wry grin at Livia's words, and he reaches into the air and makes a pulling motion. The soft but distinct sound of a train bell can be heard.

Charity looks at Livia and manages a laugh. "Well, I guess this is our stop, Cam." The laughter fades quickly and she moves forward with a determined look on her face. Come hell or high water she's going to get her job done and get back alive.

One by one the travelers step through the ring of light. They emerge dazzled and disoriented, and Charity alone comes out with a distinct memory. Bells ringing, or chimes, somewhere off in the distance. Windchimes, stirred into the most beautiful music she's ever heard by a mischievous zephyr.

Charity and Cam's first experience in Autochthonia is that of a high-tech chamber, brilliantly lit by floodlamps, and a pair of humming pistol-like weapons pointed in their faces. The wielder of those weapons is dressed head to toe in something that looks like red silk; any further details are difficult to discern. "Halt and identify, please," the figure whispers.

"Wow," whispers Charity. "Now that was something." She looks around for Livia, "You can hear it, too?" She turns back quickly to look at a pair of guns. "Charity is the name," she says smoothly. She could give him a social security number, too. Like it matters.

"I am Cam," Cam states flatly, "And you will not harm this person." For the moment, that single statement is the entire universe to him.

The man seems to flip the guns in his hands; there's a clicking sound, and they've vanished entirely. Hidden holsters? It seems that Livia's appearance is what made him stand down. "Livia," the red figure whispers coldly. "Please clear visitors with Gate Command in the future." And he turns, stalking off.

Dave, Livia, Charity and Cam are present. Snake, no longer in the Lands of Light, has reverted to nothing bu a voice in the Lunar's head.

Cam sighs. He's been among humans for so long, an encounter with one of his own kind is rattling; the unidentified Alchemical fits the single-minded, inflexible sterotype. Perhaps it's as well that Benford isn't here. "Livia," he begins. "What kind of authorization do we need for this?"

"Authorization?" The girl makes an icky face; this is some kind of new and distasteful concept to her. "I don't understand."

"You said we need to talk to the Chief, right?" asks Charity. "Do you think we can do that now. I have a feeling he'll want to see us leave as soon as possible."

Cam tries something more direct. "I must protect my sister," he says simply, "and that's no mean feat. So if my superiors can talk to your superiors, perhaps we can avoid having guns pointed at us."

"Oh you'll be talking to me alright!" The voice that bellows these words comes over some sort of public-address system. "You down there! Livia! Who said you could bring strangers here? Don't you know there are _protocols_, girl? _Procedures_? And probably many other things you don't have words for, you empty-headed little.." Another voice can be heard, only a whisper, but it's magnified by the PA. "One of them is an Alchemical." There's a pause, and the loud voice continues. "Oh, well. Come in, come in, friends."

A door in the far wall of the room slides open, and a heavy-set, clanking figure of a man strides in. "Which one of you is the Alchemical? Turn off that damned transmogrifier!"

In his mind, Cam reaches out for his brethren and comrades. He finds the Will of the Great Maker pulsing around him, but it is foreign to him. Klaxons begin blaring. "What in the blazing brazen flames of Hades are you doing?" the Chief - for the big man can be no other - shouts at Cam. "Gaunt! Pillar! Stop this man before he violates our security." It doesn't take Cam long at all to realize what is happening. His contact protocols are all wrong. This isn't the Autochthonia he knows.

The red-cloaked figure has taken a position behind the Chief, guns snapping out into his hands. He's joined by a massive, jade-skinned figure that comes through the door wielding a warhammer two-handed.

Charity moves to put herself between Cam and the others. "We want no trouble here," she says calmly. Still, she's very prepared to cause some, if needed. "We're strangers here, this is a misunderstanding."

Cam terminates the link immediately, and steps closer to Jet. This whole place is strange to him. "I am Cameron Williams. I am tasked to the Emulation Project and assigned to Gaia." It's as much a reassurance to himself as an identification. "This isn't Autocthonia," he continues, "but I can sense the Maker. So where are we?"

"You're mad, boy," the Chief says disbelievingly, staring at Cam. "This is very much Autochthonia. Where else do you suppose you'd be?"

Cam keeps his face even, and thinks quickly. Something is very wrong here. On the other hand, the consequences of being seen as a malfunctioning unit are too high. The other alchemicals are obviously optimized for combat, and he's wouldn't last very long against them. That would leave Charity alone here. "The Autochthonia that I came from," he states. "Friends, this is an intractable dilemma. Please assist us."

The Chief eyes Cam up and down. "You're an odd duck. I _know_ you're like us. But you have no soulgem, man! How do you avoid Clarity? Where are your implants? You some kind of new design, huh? Well come on. We'll let the technical staff tear into you and see what's up. Come with me to the vats, all of you."

"I don't think so," says Charity. "We have work to do, and nobody is tearing him apart." She's already preparing herself for battle. If these boys want a fight, she's going to give them one.

Cam can't hide his astonishment. "Charity..." he says. "That egg had been sitting there ten millenia. I think we went _back._"

Dave folds his arms, looking between Cam and the Chief. His eyes narrow slightly as Jet squares off. "Obviously this isn't a _diplomatic_ mission," he observes wryly, raising an eyebrow. "Or if it is, it's off to a rather bumpy start."

"What are you waiting for!" calls the Chief, already moving through the door. "The vats, the vats! And close the door behind you!"

"Back? You mean these guys are from the past?" Charity doesn't have much to say to Dave, but manages her guiltiest smile. She blames Livia for her behavior. Honestly. "So what are we doing here? Do we follow the boss here?"

Cam nods. "I have no objection to being inspected," he states to anyone who's listening. "Obviously I cannot allow myself to be impaired. Let's accommodate him as far as that goes."

Cam adds, "It may interest you, Jet. Want to see what I'm made of?" He manages a grin.

"Provided you handle such a demonstration better than I do," replies Charity with a smirk.

Autochthonia is a dark, dank, clanking world. All of its light is artificial. All of its citizens are orderly. Jet is surprised to see people who walk and smell human here. They seem to be the bulk of the populace, with these strange ur-Alchemicals as the rulers, overseers and government. Jet sees signs of need and want in the eyes of the people she passes as the Chief steers the group through the streets of a mechanical city. She looks for, but never sees, resentment or hatred in their eyes. These people are deprived in some way, but they are not oppressed.

The Chief keeps up a running commentary. Jet and Cam learn that this is a Patropolis - a living Alchemical of enormous proportions. The creature that makes up the city was once a hero, just like other Alchemicals. In time he grew so attuned to the Great Maker that he ceased to walk, and became a protector of his people in a much different fashion.

Cam avoids any further references to time travel or anachronisms. Seeing the human citizenry, he points out to Charity: "They may look unhappy to you. But take pride in this: these are human beings. They - you - can survive anywhere and everywhere. Even the Maker has respect for man's adaptability."

"They don't seem to be thriving, though," notes Charity. "I can't imagine living in such a dark place. It must drain them horribly." She is still unsure just what will happen next, of course, but for the moment she will try to keep an open mind.

The journey stops at a long, squat building with thick double doors. Two armored human guards greet the Chief, bowing deferentially. He leads the group into the foyer, then has a brief and (surprisingly for the Chief) quiet conversation with a golden-skinned woman wearing bright green robes who has appeared to greet the guests. The woman smiles, and Charity can see the sparkle of her sapphire eyes and the shimmer of her orichalcum-fiber hair as she greets each of the travelers in turn. "Mother of Many, at your service," she says by way of introduction. She focuses on Cam in particular. "We honor the will of Autochthon here. We wish to examine you."

Something about the way she speaks is unsettling to Cam. These Alchemicals are as alien to him, as he is to them. "It will be easier to accede if you guarantee my sister's safety," he states.

"She is a Lunar Exalt," says Mother of Many after a slight pause. "She is a revered guest here. What fears do you have for her safety?"

Cam nods. "Proceed, then. We have travelled far and through perilous circumstances. Caution has become a default priority."

Mother of Many leads the four travelers further into the complex. Cam discovers the Vat complex itself. They really are vats, bubbling with a liquid Cam recognizes as the Spiritual Isolation Medium of modern Alchemical construction tanks. These must be some kind of predecessor technology, though they can hardly be called primitive. Just..different.

As Charity watches, Cam is loaded into one of the Vats. Technicians begin manipulating controls on a nearby board. Electricity arcs through the liquid of the Vat in which he floats. Cam's body jerks. Slowly, carefully, she watches as his body begins to separate at hidden seams and come apart. Mother of Many rests a metal hand on Charity's shoulder. "He is progressing well," she says. "He is asleep for the duration of the process."

As the others watch, Dave Bowman feels a hand on his shoulder. Of course, he knew what was coming long before. Such a presence in the complex could hardly go unnoticed. "The First Veda wishes that you assist us in understanding this one," whispers a voice in his ear.

"Does it hurt?" asks Charity quietly. "He isn't in any danger, is he?" She's seen a lot of things, but having her brother be taken apart in front of her eyes is not something she anticipated.

Mother of Many shakes her head slowly. "It is like a womb, if I understand correctly. We are born and reborn in our Vats, over and over again."

"He looks like he's just fine," says Dave, as he comes around the side of the vat, inspecting the instruments as if he had every right to do so. "I'm not entirely sure I'm reading this right, but it looks like his spirit is intact in there." He adjusts a knob an almost imperceptible fraction. "These folks won't deliberately expose your friend to any danger in here. It's inefficient, you see."

"Mother of Many," begins Charity uncertainly. "You said I am a revered guest here. Do others of my kind visit this place? Are there any here now?"

"You won the Primordial War, where our kind could not," murmurs the Alchemical woman. "For saving Creation, for doing the will of our Maker, you will always be honored. But no, we do not receive visitors. Autochthon has withdrawn from the world..."

Klaxons and alerts begin to blare on the board. The technicians look about, starting a series of emergency procedures. Mother of Many frowns, watching both Dave and the Vat.

"What the hell is going on now?" growls Charity softly. She's rather tired of all this noise when she's trying to have a conversation. She is ready to act, but seeing no clear enemy she can only wait and see if action is even needed.

Mother of Many gently clasps Charity's shoulders, turning her to stare into the sapphire eyes, the eyes which reflect kindness and compassion that should not be the province of any Alchemical Charity knows. "We will protect him, I promise," the woman murmurs.

"...but of course nothing ever quite goes according to plan," adds Dave smoothly, as if this was how he'd intended to complete his sentence all along. He begins to move much faster, circling the vat and reading dials and adjusting crystals in a frantic effort that seems purposeless, but betrays a sort of internal logic to the careful eye. "Quiet miss, I need to work. This blasted contraption doesn't know what to make of Cam's spirit after all. Damn and blast, I need more hands!"

The Vat technicians move like a well-oiled machine. "Sir! Your machinery is on standby in the Patropolis! We'll send for it at once!" barks one. Another is already giving orders to the crew, forming an ad-hoc rapid response team to face the emergency. "Stabilize Essence flows! Lock in the secondary and tertiary entropic conduits! Engage the Flux Cage!" The men move to comply.

"Give me a readout on etheric vibrations!" calls Dave, his arms buried to the hilt in part of the undercarriage of the Vat. A technician bustles up to him, showing him a glowing panel. "Right! Set the karmic cycle dampeners on twelve, seventeen, and thirty sev- belay that, forty-five!" He watches the panel, seemingly making his own adjustments by touch underneath, just as another flashing light goes off behind him. "Seventeen! I said seventeen! Do I need to... never mind," he says, getting up and letting the panel drop behind him.

A few tense minutes go by. Charity can only watch. She has no idea what these men are saying to each other, nor what consequences it will have for Cam. For her, who once told Rose Cutter's successor that she would destroy all Alchemicals, and who now is surrounded by the most human machine-men she could have imagined, it's a time of strange feelings.

A few more of the Vat technicians wheel in an enormous platform on which is bolted a reclined chair and other components. Charity finds herself shocked to recognize some part of the Symbiogenesis device in its lines and form. Dave is already plugging parts of it into the panel. And after a few seconds of coaxing and the sputtering of machinery, he smiles.

"It's clear that he will need to be rebuilt," Mother of Many says at last, looking at the now-green board. "This haphazard technology is not worthy of the Great Maker. And it is now clear to me that every part of him was built to interface with this Lunar woman. Very well. I believe we have enough moonsilver reserves."

Charity frowns deeply. "That haphazard technology is dear to me," she growls quietly. "I pray that this rebuild is a perfect restoration and that he is returned to me unharmed in any way." After all, her list of assembled she wants to murder is getting very difficult to keep track of.

"Unharmed?" Mother of Many seems shocked. "Improved, I daresay."
