# Fall of Eden 2008-03-12

The sensation of entering these strange Alchemicals' Vats has been a strange one for Cam. As they slowly release the bindings on his body, allowing the natural seams to come apart and releasing the TBI cybercells from their normal patterns of organs and tissue, Cam's consciousness folds into itself.

This is what Shutdown is like, supposedly. Faced with a lack of input from the body, the mind goes into an introspective mode. Theoretically this is to account for the psychological impact of battle damage. Cam's constructor told him another story, part of the undercurrent of industrial legend: "it's to let you prepare for your next life".

This isn't like the cold darkness that he remembers from his construction. It's warm, and radiant. The Alchemical feels the presence of actual Magical Materials saturating the solution, rather than the manufactured Essence-channeling bubbles he's familiar with. These Vats aren't built with transtechnology. They're built like artifacts from Creation.

There's a short spike of pain. Cam regains his senses, realizing that he must have been hurt very badly. His internal sense of time is skewed. And there's something else, a presence in his mind that wasn't there before. It's not the Great Maker. It's smaller, and closer. And it addresses him in his thoughts. "Well aren't you something," runs the thought. It's tinged with amusement and enjoyment.

"As are all children of the Maker," is Cam's response. "You sound like Livia."

"I'm not," the presence thinks to Cam. "I've never met her, but I know who she is through you. You, though, are just as much a miracle or enigma as she is. Look at you. No Magical Materials. No clay flesh. You're an alien."

"She looked human enough to me. But then, so do I. If you're not Livia... then who are you?" An unpleasant thought occurs to Cam. "Am I dying?"

"You are looking at yourself in the mirror of the mind," the voice replies gently. Cam finds himself imagining a mirror. A woman's face stares out of it at him. She is coldly beautiful; it is the face of a warrior, and a hero. But her eyes smile at him, and her mouth quirks. "You are being reborn. A soul is being joined with you. My soul, in fact. When you look at yourself, you see me. When I look, I see you."

Cam does not recognize the face, but in it he sees something that reminds him of Jet. "Luna," his voice catches. So much of what Jet is flows from this Goddess; and so much of what Cam is, flows from Jet. "Is this... even possible? Will the Maker allow it?"

"I am not Luna," says the woman, and smiles. "I am - I was - a mortal. But I lived during the time where Luna and her fellow Incarnae blessed us with the Exaltation. I fought with them."

Cam considers this. "This place feels wrong to me. These people have undreamed-of riches and bizzare heresies. I feel like I'm cut off from the Maker... from _my_ Maker." And then a question of his mission comes back to him. "How do human heros know their purpose so clearly when it is not given to them?"

"I don't know about others," the woman's thoughts respond. "For me.. I knew that the war would never end in my lifetime. I knew it was for the fate of Creation, but that didn't really change anything for me. To understand, perhaps I should show you my memories of that time."

"I'd like that," Cam says, watching her face in the mirror. He's vaguely aware that somewhere very distant, the ancient Alchemicals are doing something to his body. Under other circumstances he might make a joke about witch doctors and leeches but he doesn't think anyone who could hear it would understand.

The memories of this warrior-woman flow through Cam's mind with the same ease that his own thoughts would enjoy. In that time, Creation flowed and fluxed, roiling with unanchored Essence. The relative stability of the Celestial Hierarchy was lacking. The gods walked among men, for they had no access to the Celestial City of Yu-Shan. The Incarnae gathered in rings of hewn stone, attended to by mortal servitors. Rude temples of stone rose from the primeval Earth like Aztec pyramids.

Men gathered in primitive cities, cowering from the physically superior Dragon Kings - the saurian creations of the Primordials themselves - and from the massive Behemoths who wandered the face of the world. So powerful that even death could not stop them, these living engines of destruction engaged in titanic battles with the earliest war-gods.

And in this time, Cam's soul-mate lived. She and her husband raised their children. She battled dinosaurs and made bloody sacrifices to selfish gods. She joined with her kin when the gods' call to battle came. And before she marched away, she kissed her husband and her children and held onto them tightly.

"I felt the call to serve the gods' champions," she says at last, smiling. "My purpose was clear when the summons came. It was clear because it gave me hope that my children would live in a happier world. I felt hope, that's all."

Cam realizes that this woman comes from a history as distant to humans as Gaunt and Pillar are from his contemporaries. He doubts that the gentle folk of Tijuana could deal with giant saurians rampaging through the hills outside of town, and for all its faults, modern Earth has improved on some things. "Hope. Yes. I've heard people talk about that," Cam replies. "I guess I have it too, sometimes. I have a hope right now, in this strange place, that I didn't have a few hours ago." Cam grins at the mirror. "Would you like to know what it is?"

"Please tell me," the woman's thought says. Cam realizes she already knows, but he too is aware of her thought - that the saying of a thing gives it power.

Cam says, "I hope I live long enough to see where this bizzare providence leads." He smiles. "I want to see what happens next. It may not be why I was made, but... it excites me. I think it is why I am here. Does that make sense to you?"

"Yes." The woman's presence is full of smiles and happiness, and enthusiasm, and excitement. "It's wonderful."

Cam smiles back. He has only one reservation. "I still need to ask. Will the Maker allow this? Engel disobeyed orders and died. It is not given to us to amend our purpose."

"Do you only have what's given to you?" the woman 'asks' in Cam's mind.

"That may be the big question," Cam replies. "Very well. Let's do this thing. And then, I'd like you to meet my sister."

"The joining has been done. When you regain your normal consciousness, we will no longer converse. We will be joined deeply. Your thoughts will be mine. My thoughts will be yours."

The woman's presence is gone. Cam feels himself alone again, in the introspective state. It takes him awhile to recognize that a third presence has made itself known. That presence now speaks. This time, Cam has no difficulty distinguishing its identity. It is the Maker. It is Autochthon.

**Cameron Williams. Alchemical. Do you understand the meaning of that word? Of what you truly are?**

Cam says, "We are parts of You. We are our Purpose. I thought that was all there was to Us. I think that I may have been mistaken."

**You are my Great Work, my Magnum Opus. The burning out of impurity, the achievement of enlightenment, the unification of the limited with the limitless. Through you I see what is to become of Me. It does not surprise me at all.**

Cam, whatever has happened to him, is dumbstruck. "My Lord... I am too honored. I hope that I am a worthy model."

**Do you know the song of the egg?** the Maker asks. **My children have not heard it. I have not heard it. Regardless, I know what it is. It is the song of the world beyond human experience. It is the song of the undiscovered universe. It is heard beyond death and behind dreams. It is impossible for you to hear it. My charge to you is thus: become capable of this deed.**

Cam says, "Yes. The Egg. The girl, Livia, spoke of hearing its song. We shall make it so, Lord."

**Become greater than yourself. Join the imperfect with the perfect. Burn in the crucible of the world and emerge transformed. And remember this also: you are the catalyst for transformation, not just of yourself.**

"What of the others?" Cam asks. "My sister and her allies have great plans for this world. Which of us is the tool and which is the artisan?"

**That is the question at the heart of the war.. isn't it.**

The closed loop of Cam's mind seems to be opening, and the Maker is fading. He has an awareness of changes in his transtech body. The ancient Alchemicals have done something to it, and it wasn't all bad... and then he remembers. _I can hear the Maker again! Even here and now, this far back!_ "My Lord! How long have you known?"

**You are the expression of my will. As long as you live, I will live too.** And then the presence is gone.
