# Fall of Eden 2008-03-14

The reconstruction of Cam continues apace. Charity finds in time that she must sleep. Mother of Many has prepared a bed, of sorts, the same sort that the human inhabitants of Autochthonia use. There are no cushions and there is no comfort. Nevertheless Charity finds herself dozing off.

She dreams. Even in this alien place, even with all that's happened, she dreams. She finds herself on a motorcycle, on a highway somewhere. It's a sunny afternoon. She's driving at well over 150 miles per hour, steering around the slowpoke semi tractors and vans that share the road with her.

In the distance, there's a city. Everyone that she knows and cares for can be found in that city. She feels their warmth. And ahead of her on the road, she feels something else. Something she's driving to meet, something beyond her grasp.

The hurricane comes. Jet doesn't feel surprised. It's part of her dream, it's natural. It's just part of what is happening. She turns her head, watching the raving winds sweep through the city. Somewhere inside, her friends are dying. Her friends are dead. The wind moves on.

No enemy remains behind. No revenge is possible. On the highway, traveling from nowhere to nowhere at insane speed, there is nothing but loss.

Jet does the only thing that makes sense, she stops and gets off her bike. The frustration and feeling of despair steals purpose from her. There's no reason to go on, after all, and nothing to be done for the dead, and so she will wait. "Come get me, bastard. I know it will be my turn sooner or later," she growls.

"Who?" The biker finds a long-haired, violet-eyed man standing behind her on the side of the road. Her avatar, the collected font of Lunar wisdom in her heart. "Who?" he asks again.

"Who? Whatever it is that is out there," replies Charity. She puts a hand to her face and scrubs at it. "I don't know who. I don't know what. I don't understand what is happening."

Jet sees her friends and family gathered around her on the road side. She feels herself in the body of her half-tiger war form. She towers above them, a killing machine full of bestial power. They scream, running before Jet can act. Some, in their panic, stray into traffic and are struck down in the blink of an eye. Others are rescued by passing drivers who manage to stop in time.

"Now who must atone for your pain?" the Lunar asks quietly.

Charity frowns and feels the unease flow over her in waves. "I do not understand this," she growls out. "Why should they run from me? I have always tried to protect them."

"You're fearful and terrifying." The avatar's words are plain. "You are like a hurricane."

"No. I have a will and judgement. I do not kill by random whim. I am a guardian," replies Charity. "And I am also a judge. By Luna I have the authority to use the powers I have been given to the best of my ability and with the best direction my soul and mind can provide."

"And you can be wrong."

"Yes," says Charity. "That is the consequence of all actions. We who act are not always right. Yet those who do not act are just as likely to be wrong. For me as for all of humanity; we can only strive to make the best choices."

"And when you make a mistake, what will you do?" The avatar paces in a slow circle around Charity. "When a man looks at you and says 'I will avenge the wrong you did to me', what will you do?"

"Then I will defend myself," says Charity simply. "And I will do what I can to make amends. Of course, by the nature of what I am and what I do, that is not always possible."

The Lunar suddenly thrusts his hand out. He strikes Charity before she can react, and draws away. On her skin, the Lunar can see a black stain spreading out from the impact point. "Something else has happened," the avatar explains. "You become poisoned. With regret. Loss."

"I don't understand what you mean," replies Charity. "I am not poisoned."

The black mark covers Charity's arm. She starts to feel something sapping at her energy. "Despair sets in," the avatar whispers. "Self-doubt. Confusion. Frustration. It doesn't matter whether the grief is yours, or caused by you."

"Then what is the cure?" asks Charity. She looks at the mark, and though she can feel it draining her, she is able to tear away her gaze away and cover the growing alarm.

"Accept it," the avatar says, smiling.

"That's it?" Charity sounds more than a little annoyed. "You put me through all this to say 'get over it'?" She frowns at the avatar and sighs, "Wouldn't it be easier to just tell me without the big production?"

"Tell you what?" The avatar shakes his head. "It is your mind and your heart that holds the key to acceptance. Do you know why we are here, now? This is your mind, after all. We're here because you are _almost there_."

"So I am on the path," says Charity. "I think the only way to finish the journey is to keep going, so that is what I will do." She manages a brief smile and asks, "Does it ever get easier?"

The avatar shrugs. "Ask the dead."

---

Charity wakes up. She must have bumped her arm. There's a small black mark on it, and it tingles a bit. The Alchemical in the red garb - Gauntlet, she recalls - is standing over her. How did he avoid waking her when he arrived? "We have a mission for you," he whispers, holding out a hand.

Charity looks at the offered hand for a moment before taking it. "How is Cam?" she asks automatically. "Will the mission help him?"

"You will be replacing the Magical Materials we are expending in his reconstruction," Gauntlet whispers. "The work is within one standard deviation of time and scope projections."

"If you hadn't torn him up to begin with we wouldn't have to do this," Charity points out. "I hope that is not lost on whoever has put this little mission together." Still, having nothing else to do... "Not that I won't go, but I expect some kind of returns on the time and risk involved in this project."

"Is our aid in your own goal here not sufficient?" the Alchemical whispers again. Mixed with his own voice, Charity makes out the quietest of moans, and other whispered voices. They seem to be coming from the man himself, but not his mouth. He seems aware of them too, stiffening slightly in response. "Come. Livia awaits."

"Should that aid be offered it will be quite sufficient," says Charity. "But I hope you can understand my impatience and annoyance. Cam is important to me, and now he may be hurt."

"Hurt?" The Alchemical's harsh laughter grates in Charity's ears. "His treatment is gentle compared to mine." He leads the way as he speaks, guiding Charity through the maze of the Patropolis. She remembers the route well enough to guess the destination and distance - the gate complex.

"His treatment was foolish and risky," replies Charity. She follows in silence, annoyed by the cavalier attitude of Gaunt.

Livia and the Chief are waiting. The girl is smiling, while the Chief is dour. "You'll never guess what we found!" he says when Gauntlet and Charity walk in. "A whole mountain of moonsilver. A mountain of it! Alright, a heap, but still! And it's all for the taking, except for one thing." He points a heavy finger at Charity. "One of YOU people is guarding it. Go talk him out of it." He jerks a thumb at the gate. "Just step in."

"Are you serious?" asks Charity. "Talk him out of it?" She laughs a little at that one. She has a bad feeling about this one. Still, it's one of her own kind on the other side. That's something worthwhile. "This should be reallllly interesting." She pauses to stare at the gate, then moves closer. "So just step on through, huh?"

Livia starts to sing. The chief just sighs. "Operate the gate controls like a regular person!" he bellows. Livia ignores him, singing a song and stepping toward the portal. Gauntlet follows, apparently unfazed.

Charity waits patiently for some sign that it's time to go through. She listens carefully to the song, wondering if it is like the song she heard before. For Livia, it seems there is power in song.

"Get going!" shouts the Chief, throwing something at Charity. She snaps it out of the air, and feels it squirm in her palm. "Linguispider," he explains. True to his word, a tiny mechanical spider is swarming up her arm. It nestles itself around her ear, and she feels a thin tendril of spider-silk wrap around her throat as well. _Hullo,_ the spider whispers. _Translation matrix contains 363 modes of communication._

"Good lord," the Lunar says softly. She steps forward with a dubious expression. This just has the markings of trouble all over it, and having cheery Gaunt and the seriousness of Livia as marks most likely against her is going to make this negotiation one to remember.

The transition through the gate is instantaneous. Charity remembers hearing snatches of song. It isn't Livia's tune, although there's some resemblance. It's the song of the world, the song of the egg, and it is all around her. In the next moment she finds herself in a bright, beautifully sunlit place. Above her, islands of stone drift gracefully through the sky. Trees grow from these floating rocks, and she can make out grass and other signs of life as well. She looks down. Sure enough, she's also occupying a levitating chunk of rock. All around her, the sky is full of clouds.

It seems there's no end to the sky in either direction. The horizon stretches to infinity, and Charity can see more sky-islands every way she looks.

"Nice view," murmurs Charity. "Too bad I can't bring back any pictures to show Becca. She'd love to draw a place like this." The Lunar breathes deeply, filing away unique scents and doing what her instincts guide her to do. She has to figure out what this place is, first.

Livia is busy playing with a rock. She turns it this way and that in her hand, cupping it and cooing it as though it were a pet kitten. Gauntlet, meanwhile, is nowhere to be seen. Charity can feel his presence, but nothing more. She knows, somehow, that it's the armor he wears that is disguising his presence. At last Livia points off at a distant sky-island and turns to Charity, smiling. "He's up there!" she shouts. Then she's back to playing with the rock.

"Er, thanks." Charity looks at Livia as if she were crazy and shrugs. "Well, have fun with your pet rock there." She takes two steps and leaps skyward, shedding her form and shifting swiftly into that of a bird. She wants to get to where she's going quickly, and she wants to get a lay of the land, too.

The view from the air isn't particularly different, only less restrained. The Lunar finds herself looking down at several of the sky-islands, noting details. Here and there she can spot signs of habitation. Threads of smoke curl up from distant rocks, suggesting fires. The scent on the wind is that of water vapor from the clouds, the distinctive melange of growing things and dirt, and - faint but finally present - living things. Her keen eyes make out the contents of her destination well before she arrives.

There is a wooden shack of sorts, with firewood stacked next to it. The rest of the sky-island seems to have been converted into a garden, and Charity can make out 16 different varieties of growing things.

Flying a couple loops above the shack, Charity is able to get a good idea of the surroundings before she descends. She won't shift just yet. If it's a normal Lunar she's come to meet she will be noticed immediately. If not, at least she's learned something more about this place and this supposed Lunar.

The shack seems to be deserted. There's a fireplace inside, and the entire affair looks to be hand-constructed by someone with no great skill at architecture. Still, it seems solid. The garden holds fruits and vegetables, though none that Jet recognizes.

There's something else, some presence Charity is aware of but can't nail down. It isn't menacing, just close.

Charity is not known for patience. She shifts forms smoothly, becoming human once more. She calls out, "I know you are here." She just isn't sure exactly which of here the other Lunar is in.

This bold display is met with an entirely unexpected development. One of the rooting plants in the garden mimics her smooth transformation. It grows from plant to man in the space of a moment. His hair and eyes are black, and his skin sports a healthy tan. He's dressed in a loincloth and a leather harness fastened around his chest, and little else. "Oh ho. Those metal men sent me a wife as a bribe this time, eh?" he asks with a rakish grin.

Charity laughs quietly, "So you know about my humorless allies." She can't help but admire that trick. "You.. can take the form of a plant? That's amazing." She immediately wants to know how.

"Of course! I'm Carbon, son of Barone." The man thumps his bare chest with a well-muscled forearm, still grinning. "Master shapeshifter and Wyld-walker. Only I walked too far."

"Wyld-walker?" asks Charity. "Is that how you got here?" She does manage to return to courtesies. "Oh, I'm Charity, daughter of Luna. Master troublemaker and best stripper the Saint James ever had." She figures it's as good a title as any.

"Glad to hear it!" Carbon grins, gesturing at his cabin. "I'm sure I'll be satisfied. Tell those creatures that my moonsilver is yours. Provided, of course, you stay."

"I think they might approve that deal, but I'm afraid I can't stay here," says Charity. "Not that the company wouldn't be welcome, but I have obligations. Why not join me instead? If you are the Wyld-wanderer you must be getting a little bored of this place."

"And take my chances? No thank you!" Carbon shakes his head. "This is the safest, nicest pocket of Creation I've found in twenty long years."

"Safest?" murmurs Charity quietly. "How odd. They said you were a Lunar. Perhaps I misunderstood them."

"We'll see if _you_ enjoy wrestling hundred-foot crocodiles with glass teeth for every meal," Carbon replies with a scowl. "Whether you _can_, why stay long after you've proved yourself?"

"Because there's something worth fighting for out there," says Charity. "And because it is what we were made for. Those fools think the moonsilver is what is important here. They are mistaken. Doesn't fighting for a purpose mean anything to you now, or would you truly rather sit here and wait for time to claim you?" It's not a shouted challenge, but a quiet question this time. She can't imagine a Lunar clinging to a safe harbor.

"What purpose is there? This place is nothing but clouds, rocks, and those crazy gurflings," Carbon replies. "I have no idea where your metal friends came from, or how they came up with _you_, but they aren't my enemy. I'll brave the Wyld when I'm good and ready. And if you're smart, you'll stick with me."

"And what if you can find a path that does not go through the Wyld at all?" asks Charity. "You do understand that I am not from Creation, right? Do you know of Gaia?"

"Sure, the Magic Moon." Carbon laughs. "Don't tell me you come from Luna's Sister."

"I do," says Charity. "There is battle to be found there, and not against the madness of the Wyld. This fight is one that I think must be won to save Creation and to save Gaia."

"Hah! If you can get there, my moonsilver _and_ me are yours." Carbon grins. "But you'll still be my wife. So when do we leave?"

Charity laughs, "We'll see about the whole wife thing," she replies wryly. "But if you truly wish to go, follow me now. And don't despair, there's enough pieces of tail around to satisfy your needs on Gaia." She pauses to think, "If this place is not far removed from Creation.. hmm."

"Oh well, no luck here, either. Carbon, how do you recover essence in this place? It's as dry as Gaia." Charity hopes there's some good answer, but she doesn't hope too much.

The Lunar laughs. "The gurflings showed me that. Come, I'll show you their secret." And he leaps into the air, adopting the shape of an alien-looking hunting bird with brilliant plumage as he moves.

Charity follows quickly, eager to learn this secret.

Carbon leads the way, swooping and gliding with practiced ease on the thermals of this alien sky. He guides Charity through a maze of sky-islands. At each one he'll play games such as folding his wings to dart between a tree's branches, or snatching up a rock and flinging it onto the next island. And at last Charity sees their goal. A larger sky-island looms in the distance, and on the underside there's a sort of cave entrance. Carbon ascends on a thermal, positioning himself to glide perfectly through the center of the entrance. He resumes human form inside, skidding to a stop on the stone floor. He looks back at Charity, grinning.

Jet can feel this place's secret. There is music here, and love, and warmth. Lust, passion, anger, righteousness. The emotions paint themselves on her heart as she moves. The smells of the cave start to grow more intense. She recognizes at last what she is feeling. Essence. It's Essence, all around her.

"This is the holy place of the gurflings," Carbon is saying. "Local Essence for a dozen miles congregates here. The gurflings who live on the sky-islands? They aren't just people. They're children of the islands themselves. The stones, all of them - they're the true life in this place. The gurflings cast off their humanoid shapes and float into the sky when they're ready. And they always, always come here."

"Wow," whispers Charity softly. "And.. and Creation is like this everywhere?" She can't imagine it. For her, it's like she hasn't been alive until this moment. The thought of leaving this cave is one she views with distaste already. It's simply amazing to her.

Carbon gives a long belly-laugh at that. "Are you kidding? Creation is ten times the Essence of this place. I was spitting out food for a month until my taste buds lost their sensitivity."

"How can you get anything done there?" asks Charity honestly. "I just want to sit here and listen and feel. It's like having a feast after being fed barely enough to live."

"Essence is the _only_ way to get things done," Carbon grins. "Now get your fill. You got me charged up about this new fight!"

Charity smiles and reaches out, grasping the essence and weaving it about herself. She basks in what is there, a thrill running up her spine and flooding her with warmth. She cannot express what it feels like, but she knows she's done this before, and she is equally certain she must do this again. The understanding is so natural, so instinctual, that it is over before she fully realizes just what she has done.

The Full Moon can feel herself stretching out, like she has discovered atrophied muscles and at last has remembered how to flex them. Essence ripples around her, splashing out a moment later as she completes the transformation in a sudden rush of power. The experience leaves her breathless and stumbling. The feeling that follows this rush is like being dipped in ice and then filled with heat.

In that moment, as Essence purifies and surrounds and infuses Charity, she realizes that her power comes truly from herself. It is her own nature that intensifies and allows her to channel magical force. And it is the curse of the Exalted that she know just what that means.

She can feel her past lives. The memories rush through her mind. She recalls when she had _everything_. Lovers, a spouse, a kingdom. People, bowing as she passed, tears forming in their eyes in gratitude for her blessings. Harmony, beauty, artistry. And she remembers the moment when she realized it had all gone wrong. And she turned and fled.

She ran to the Wyld. She fled everything that had given her life meaning. She forsook it all. She abandoned everyone who had ever depended on her. And she lived on.

Charity finds herself on her knees, holding herself up with one hand and the other clutches her chest. "It is good that it shows the truth," she whispers. She wipes tears from her eyes, "The truth is not always very beautiful." She steels herself as she rises, "It is time to go back, then. We will give those metal people their moonsilver and we will find our battle together. Maybe you can teach me a few of those shapeshifting tricks of yours, too."

"I can become rocks, plants, gods, or demons. I can place a star in the sky." Carbon smiles. "I can do all that and more, and I'll teach you what I know. Now let's get going."

Carbon leads the way back to the island where Charity and the others 'landed'. Gauntlet is there waiting for them. "I think some of these stones are communicating with others," he whispers. Livia just smiles brightly. She's wearing a dress with an apron, and has gathered several of the rocks into it.

The master shapeshifter makes a two-fingered gesture Jet interprets as a salute of some kind. "I'll lead you to the stockpile," he offers. "Better be ready to do some hauling."

A few hours are all it takes for the burly jade-skinned Alchemicals of Autochthonia to haul the piles of precious moonsilver back through the Gate. Carbon watches them the whole time, smiling. At the end of it, he knocks down his shack with a single swift kick. He has no possessions, it seems, aside from the magical metal. And as the expedition returns through the Gate, he whistles. "Wish we'd had this when I was traveling."

Mother of Many has a message for Charity when she returns. Answering it, the Lunar travels back to the Vat complex. She finds the orichalcum Alchemical woman in some sort of large planning room, examining blueprints and schematics. "Come in, child," she says once Charity arrives.

The designs are scattered across tables and pinned to walls. "I wish to show you something. It concerns Cam, but it concerns our larger mission too. Tell me, what do you see here?" And as Charity looks, she discerns at least a bit of the pattern. The schematic is of a great machine. Magical materials are represented on the schematic, and shown being removed or replaced from the structure. Other fundamental changes are also indicated, but she is not occult engineer enough to discern their meaning.

"A machine of some sort," is Charity's weak answer. She doesn't understand what she sees. "If my friend Newton were here he might be able to tell you more. I've never been good at this sort of thing."

"You see a plan to invest a strange Alchemical with Magical Materials and sensible design techniques." Mother of Many smiles. "Or, taking it in reverse, you see a plan to divest Autochthon Himself of the Magical Materials, and transform him into something new. That is our work."

"But if you do this, don't you risk Autochthon's very existance?" asks Charity. "What happens when you take too much away?"

"We must take it all away. That is His Will. He will not cease to exist. Instead, he will become something else. And what was taken away will be used.. to make something new."

"Do you know what you are making?" asks Charity. "What will happen to this place if you continue? Where will you go if he becomes something uninhabitable?"

"It is what Autochthon wills," Mother of Many answers calmly. "We choose to obey."

"I see." Charity considers this for a time and says, "I hope it works out well for everyone in the end." The Lunar wonders if she might just know what happens after those materials run out.
