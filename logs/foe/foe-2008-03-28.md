The tram ride back from the First Veda passes quickly. The mountain is dismantled even as it recedes into the distance and soon becomes imperceptible through the hazy atmosphere. "All for that one hour. All for the perfection of humanity," Cam states. "All of this will be gone by my time. The only agency left is the Maker himself. I know why He had to forget... but it seems that it should be recorded somewhere. When we return, I want to speak to the Mother of Many. I shall remember the old ways for us."

The tram arrives in the Patropolis, at the same platform from whence it departed a few hours ago. The skyline of the city is subtly changed; in the world of the Maker, even buildings are not retained beyond their purpose. The Vats, however, are the same. Persistence is a sign of importance.

Mother of Mercy is back at the Vat complex. When she welcomes Cam back to her workspace, she has a surprise for him. It isn't a manual, nor an implant, nor a device. It is simply information. "Your design is self-evident," she says. "You will heal on your own. You won't improve on your own, but the Vats of your home will be sufficient to operate on you. We have seen to it."

Cam holds up his hand and flexes it. "That's convenient," he says, and sees the wisdom of it; it's an organic solution, like the cybercells that still compose his core. "But there is more I'd like to know." More softly, he says, "Things have to change for the great work to be done, and I know that, but I'd like to see to it that the old ways are not lost. Tell me of our old heros, like Thosh."

The Alchemical spreads her hands. "That story is not for me to tell. Look around you. Thosh is all around us. Travel the city. Experience him. That is his lore. I can give you data, but what I perceive you want is Essence. The spark of truth. If you experience Thosh, all truth about him will follow. It is the same with the Maker."

"If that's true," Cam says, "then everything worth preserving is in the experiences of these people." He nods. "And the plan to preserve it, is simply to preserve them."

"That which ought to be preserved will be assembled into the New Core," says Mother of Many. "It will be separated from Autochthon, left to its own devices. And now that I have met him, I perceive that Dave Bowman, your companion, will become its caretaker in time."

"Someone talking about me?" asks Dave, strolling in. "Glad to see you're up and operational, Cam," he adds conversationally. "I was wondering what my next job would be after Autochthon's Plan went into effect. And that sounds like a very worthy task indeed."

Cam searches around for some clothes, and finds his old wetsuit drying on a rack near the vats. "And the architect of the new line," Cam mentions. "So all that's left is... what use can we be to you now?"

Mother of Many shakes her head. "We were proceeding as planned before your arrival. Our plan will continue as it must. We've replenished the supplies used in your work. Thus, we remain in scope and well-balanced." This, to an Autochthonian, is of course the objective.

Cam says, "Then let's find Charity, and find a way home."

---

Charity has devoted her mind to the task of helping find a good life for some of the humans in the soon-to-be purged world. The key is of course the gate, and so she's sought-out Livia, which really isn't terribly difficult. "I think with some work the Exalts of Gaia could make Mars a viable solution, and it seems that the Alchemicals here might already have some good answers. There may also be help in Ranapura." Her explanation is met with the usual smile Livia flashes, which makes Charity wonder if the strange girl is even listening. "So, can you find these places with the gate?"

Livia hums and hems and hooms, finding amusement with the variety of sounds her voice can produce. Presently she returns to the question at hand. "Well, yes, but, er.. I don't think it'll be what you want," she says at last.

"If you could explain that it would be greatly appreciated," says Charity. She is hoping the answer is something easy to understand, even if it will apparently disappoint her. She's growing accustomed to the world not working the way she wants it to.

Livia nods brightly, and goes to fetch a pad of parchment and a writing quill. True to Alchemical form, it's for engineering and drafting. She draws a spiral, emanating from the center of the sheet. "This is Autochthon." Then she draws a straight line across the spiral, from the left to the right sides of the paper. "This is the gate. Annnnd..." The line is joined by a random lighting-like series of streaks. "This is Gaia. You can travel to where the lines cross. Get it?"

"I think so," says Charity. She's rather shocked, and wonders if Livia's clarity means she's about to fall victim to a strange prank.

Livia nods slowly. "So um, could you explain it to me then?"

Charity reaches out and gently pats Livia's head, "Thank you dear, the universe makes sense again." The Lunar laughs softly and looks at the paper, "Well, let's see. If Autochthon is a giant spiral, that makes sense, because he is trying to grow, and spirals increase in size, right? The lightning bolt is a bit strange, and hopefully doesn't mean that Gaia will be gone in a flash." She's not taking this very seriously.

The girl nods, raptly intent, with a serious expression on her face.

Charity blinks a few times at Livia. If this girl wasn't ridiculously cute in her innocent naivete Charity would be getting annoyed. "The Chief is right, it's impossible to not like you." The Lunar sighs and looks back at the paper, "So anyway, if this line can reach Gaia, I wonder if it can reach Mars.. or Ranapura." Charity takes the quill and the paper and begins to scrawl. Her hand writing is rather bold, if not very elegant. She draws several spears crossed and says, "This is Mars." Then she draws a pattern of caste marks from her memory, "This is Ranapura." The make-it-up-at-as-you-go-along approach is how Charity made it to highschool.

Livia frowns and shakes her head. "So if I understand this correctly... you want to visit the Maiden of Battles? And a city. Well, the city we can try."

Livia sings to the gate. One of these days, she might ask the Chief's permission to do so. But when it opens, a spirit steps out, followed by another. It is the pair of children who appeared to the Solars, the images of Davron's descendants.

"Wow." Charity smiles, watching the spirits closely. She has a thing for protecting children, which makes her pay close attention. She explains to them and to Livia, "In the world I come from, Mars is not only a goddess, but a place, a great red sphere with ice caps and a huge, dormant volcano. We have sent little machines there to learn about it." Charity hopes they don't need more, because honestly having seen a handful of sci-fi movies didn't give her a ton to go by.

"Hallo!" "Hallo!" they call. Livia smiles brightly. "Hallo!" she says in return, holding up a hand. "You can't come in, we're so terribly sorry!" the children say in unison. Livia makes a sad face.

"We can't come in?" asks Charity. "Even this way we must have the required number?" She figured it wouldn't be that easy.

The children bob their heads as one. "We have to know that you all agree to use Ranapura together," they explain.

There is a sigh from the corner of the room. "Oh for the Maker's sake," comes Dave's gently exasperated voice. "You've only gone and opened the gate without permission again, haven't you, Livia? Poor Chief, he's going to blow a gasket aga..." he pauses, and trails off as he sees what the Gate is open to.

"Hallo!" "Hallo!" they call, smiling brightly.

Charity smiles at the children and nods, "Of course. Can you tell me anything about Ranapura? Can you show me what it is like? I want to tell the others and make them understand why it is so important." For the moment, she isn't going to react to Dave's presence.

The children point right at Dave and smile. "He can show you!" they announce cheerfully.

Charity turns to Dave, "Oh really? You know about Ranapura?"

Cam looks sideways at David Bowman, Wizard. "Tell me, when you awoke this morning, did you know you were going to be so important?"

Dave's eyes widen, and he takes a step back. "Now children..." he begins, raising his hands. "My name is Dave Bowman," he says, illuminating his unconventional Caste Mark by illustration. "Please don't forget that." He sighs and chuckles. "Well, I already have a pretty important role with the Lands of Light, but I wasn't expecting to be briefed on my new role so soon." He gestures to the guardian spirits of Ranapura. "Or this."

"Now, now, Dave, don't disappoint the children," says Charity. "Especially not us big kids." She watches him closely, obviously expecting something amazing to be revealed.

Dave shakes his head and smiles. "All right," he says. "Well, I'm sure you can guess some of the goodies by now, but I suppose I can give you some idea," he says, borrowing the sketchpad from Livia. "Ah, trying to do a little interdimensional navigation, I see," he says, turning to a new pad and beginning to sketch out a chart of Ranapura.

Dave's explanation mostly covers general topics rather than details and specs, but it does indeed make Ranapura out to be a very desirable goal for the Gaia-bound Celestials. Weapons of many kinds, both personal-scale as well as Ranapura's own city defense grid, a detailed library of magical and Creation lore (with the city's resident spirit-beings serving as the librarians), and of course the Sun-driven engines that allow the city to fly. "It's been upgraded somewhat from the original design, of course," he observes in passing.

Finally, Dave hands the sketchpad over to Charity. "All in all, when you manage to get yourselves organized enough to gain authorization, your people will be very well prepared indeed. And of course you're going to totally overawe mortal mankind on Gaia, but from what you've told me, you seem to think that's unavoidable anyway."

Cam says, "We're told that great changes are coming to Earth. We might not seem that exceptional before too long."

"I wonder if I will be able to find a way for others to do as I have, to gain greater control of essence," says Charity. "Does Ranapura have anything to aid in this? I don't think we'll be able to use the gate for that again."

Dave shakes his head. "The library will be able to give you more details, but I suspect that by the time you can get there, the great changes Cam speaks of will have made the question obsolete." He grins at Charity. "Which is not to say that your trip has been a waste. Getting a head start will be a huge help in the months to come, I've no doubt. As well as what you've learned in your journey."

"And I did pick up a burly old Lunar to bring back," says Charity. Even if he's probably gonna be a lose cannon. "I'm still hoping I can repay the people of Autochthon for the help I've received. I don't understand this talk of Mars, though. It's not just a god, it's a big hunk of rock in space."

"Is it?" asks Dave. "Have you ever been there?"

"Who says?" asks Livia, smiling.

"We sent probes there," says Charity. "Are you gonna tell me we never went to the moon, too?"

"How do you know the probes got anywhere?" Livia is still smiling.

"How do I know the stars shine?" asks Charity. "We can only believe the perceptions we have. How do you know anything is real?"

Livia smiles again, even more brightly. "Essence!"

Cam says, "I think that people have to go there before it's a real place, Charity. When they do it will probably look like it does in the pictures... but until we see it with our own eyes, it's just a picture. I think that's what they mean."

"We already have seen it with our own eyes," replies Charity. "Through telescopes. It is just a hunk of glass. Even without it you can see the glow in the sky. If perception channels essence, then Mars would be fed by the faith of billions."

"Faith, and Essence, which is siphoned away into the Lands of Light - leaving Gaia an Essence-neutral realm," points out Dave.

Cam says, "If we had any Chosen of Battles among our allies, they would be pleased by that." Cam smiles.

"And what happens when the essence-neutral part fails utterly in a few weeks?" asks Charity.

The Wizard smiles. "Something wonderful."

"I have a theory," says Charity. She reaches out to take the paper back and finds a blank spot to work. "Right now, this faith is siphoned, based only upon a perception that is, in scientific terms, nothing but myth." She starts to draw random shapes, "In truth, this is like the Wyld, it's like.. a superstate. It is potential waiting for perception to direct essence and force form into the jaws of chaos. However.. before that period of change comes, perception could be shifted radically." She draws a question mark, "In theory, Mars can be whatever we wish it to be."

Dave carefully solicits the quill and begins to draw a series of grids though Charity's diagram. "In the Wyld, that's so. In Gaia, and in Creation, and in the Lands of Light, there's a framework that channels that power. Keeps perception from being reality. Keeps physical law running. We call it the Loom of Fate, or something similar. And to make Mars a real place - assuming it isn't - you need an entry in your Gaian Loom for it. So is there one?"

"I don't know," replies Charity. "Who runs that Loom? How can it be changed? Those are the golden questions. It would seem easier to have an entry, else.." Charity isn't sure where this thought comes from, but she offers it anyway, "Else the essence directed to it would just be lost, wouldn't it? Shit.. there's probably no entry at all, is there?"

"If what Livia says is true, and you can't get there, then it's probably umm, just glamour." Dave searches for the right terms, tapping his chin slowly. "_Kut suwa jona_, the shadow on the wall. It _looks_ real to mundane senses, because it's an echo of something larger and truer."

"We know some of those answers, Charity," Cam mentions. "The Lands of Light turn into Gaia's Loom. And we were told that memes are its stock-in-trade. So... there's memes of Mars, for sure, or we wouldn't be talking about it."

"What happens to the Lands of Light when the big change hits? What happens to the memes?" Charity is operating in the land of the abstract, which bothers her. What bothers her even more is that this makes sense on some subconcious level. "I think we will need Mars to be real. If this conflict spirals out of control I suspect we will need a larger base of operations than Ranapura, or a place to put bystanders that is outside the war zone."

Cam crosses his arms. "Like Gaia was, originally. That's going to take a lot of essence. Hey, I'm no expert in these things, but if Mars is a Goddess, maybe we should ask her?"

It is at this moment that Charity's avatar makes itself manifest to her. Dave seems to perk up, obscurely aware that something has changed about her. "You are now asking the questions which your prior incarnation has already answered," he says in her mind. "The truth of your strategy is becoming known to you again. Have confidence. You have planned well."

Charity pauses and smiles. "I think I understand enough now," she says at last. "Thank you Dave, this is becoming most enlightening." The Full Moon is aware that she doesn't get it yet, but she's also aware that all the pieces are inside her already, and that it will come to her in time. "I must get back to the others. I've gained only a short term advantage."

"Well, there is one thing left for me to learn here," Cam says. He draws the metal egg from its pouch. It looks the same as before, its smooth shell giving no hint to the chain of events that it's caused. "What is this thing, and how do I hear its song?"

Livia nods. "It's a music box. It captures the song beyond the gate." She smiles gently. "I'm sorry.. I don't know how to make you hear it. You must find that for yourself."

Cam nods. "I'd like to keep it, Charity. The Maker said it would be important."

"I think it would be wise to keep it," says Charity. "Otherwise how will you know if you can hear the song or not?"

---

The innermost chamber of Autochthon's sanctums have been visited by few beings. The Solar Davron was one of the few humans to do so. And now he stands here again, under a new name, and with a new task. Livia has been asked to come here too.

With them is another person, a fair-haired youth with an ever-smiling face. He bears a strong resemblance to Livia, and rightfully so - he is the man who recruited Davron for the task of building up the Lands of Light.

"I'm kind of surprised that we're all here together," the youth observes, smiling and looking from person to person to 'person'. "Time is a funny thing. But I wanted to thank you all."

"That young Lunar had a request. She was interested in seeing some of the human population go elsewhere." The young man shrugs winsomely. "I wish I could help, but anyone she's taking along didn't want to come with me to begin with. I figured you three would have some suggestions."

"They will fall where the wind blows," says Livia happily. "Whether these seeds ever take root or not is not our decision to make." She pauses to hum softly to herself, then adds a shrug, "What does it matter where the little ones take root?"

"Dave Bowman" rubs his chin. "I'm not sure, to be honest," he says. "From what I've heard so far, the cosmos around Gaia isn't sufficiently reified enough for her purposes, at least in her era. Perhaps there are other times and places... but that may hardly be any easier to find."

One of the avatars of Autochthon steps out of the shadows at the edges of the room, a young man's face and body with an old man's hair, clad in ribbons of light. "Just so, child," he says, and it is unclear which of the others he means. "Mortals go where they choose. Is that not karma? Where will karma lead them in your new world?"

"I don't think there's any one answer," agrees Davron. "Each one who chooses not to follow you," he says, addressing the young stranger, "has their own reasons. And what suits one may not suit another. Some may even wish to be reborn on Gaia itself - even the Gaia of Charity's era, which has ceased to be a refuge."

"Karma will lead wherever it will lead," replies Livia. It seems to please her, not knowing. "In the end, it does not matter. The choice is made. Our wills are not involved. Let it be another choice, another theme in the great music."

The youth bobs his head. "Oh sure. It's just a shame. I wish I was fully born. I can't _wait!_" He raises his arms above his head, flashing a charming grin. "Then I'd take care of this no problem." He jabs a finger into Davron's forearm. "You slacker! Hurry up and finish your work."

Davron laughs. "Hey, believe me, you don't want a rush job, lad. These things take proper artistry. You wouldn't appreciate it at all if I screwed up." If there's one thing he's begun to grow used to, in his travels between different webs of Fate, it's that the flow of cause and effect does not always travel in one direction.

"Soon the music will come to you," says Livia. "But what music shall it be? What theme is it that comes from this great movement? We will sing together."

One avatar disappears, replaced by another, a female figure that resembles the Mother of Mercy. "Many harmonies from many places. Is the Gate is the answer? Instruments that begin at different times are still part of the orchestra." A spiral similar to the one that Livia drew appears in the air overhead. "They will begin when they are ready."

The lad smiles at the Autochthonian avatar. "Don't worry, Pop. Tell you what. How about I send Livia along with that Lunar girl? She can go ask Mom if she has any ideas about your guys."

The spiral contracts and expands, replaced by an abstract image of an oroborous - a snake eatings its tail. Traces of light appear within the torus, filling in details, and it looks less snake-like and more artificial. Finally, an image of a metallic ring-shaped object floats in the air. "Yes. When it is time, give them the Gate," the female Avatar says. The image condenses into a small solid object and drops into Dave Bowman's hand. "And Livia will know where it leads."

Livia tilts her head, listening to something. Maybe she's even listening to what is being said. At the end she laughs softly. "I will? Hmmm.. I suppose sooner or later I might know, but that is not how I make decisions. I will hear a beautiful song missing just the right theme. What will happen then? It doesn't matter."

Davron nods. "What matters is that there is harmony." _Which is not the same as order,_ he adds to himself.

The motherly avatar smiles down at Livia. "Wonderful child. To know the theme that completes the harmony, is the thing that matters most."
