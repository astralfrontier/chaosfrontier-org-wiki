The Man is wearing a loosely-fitting blue suit. His tie hangs loosely from his neck. His jacket is unbuttoned. His feet are bare.

Natasha and Elizabeth Ivanova wear equally athletic outfits woven from natural fabrics. Form-fitting on the torso, loose on the joints.

The gymnasium has been closed by special arrangement. The three face each other in a triangular pattern in the gym's spacious open area.

The Man is smiling at the two golems. "We are going to learn the Varma Ati and the Varma Kalai," he says. "These are fighting styles you two should be able to pick up pretty quickly. It's not just so you can fight. It's so you both can control yourselves as golems. Any questions?"

The sisters look at each other a moment, and then back to The Man. "Just one," says Natasha. "Can you stop using the G word? It's really a turn off." Elizabeth barks a laugh and shifts lightly on her feet, "Yeah, makes me feel like I should be chasing a short guy with a ring."

"You'll accept what you are and like it," the Sidereal replies curtly. "We're not here to make you two feel good about yourselves. Any other questions?"

"Fine, fine, suit yourself," says Elizabeth. "We are what and who we are. Let's stop worrying about that and find out what we can become."

The Man nods, smiling. Then he's rushing forward, kicking off the mat with each step, snapping a twisting punch at Natasha.

The twins were close in life, but since then they have become so close that their thoughts are intertwined, their every action the personification of a teamwork born by bound souls. Natasha steps back and Elizabeth moves forward, so while the first sister manages what is a decent (if not precisely graceful) block The Man faces a wild swing from the other sister as she moves to flank him.

The Man easily slaps away the counterattack. As he does, he twists his fingers and jabs them into the retreating limb. Elizabeth feels her arm go briefly numb. The teacher smiles again, backing away. "Varma Kalai began as a healing art, the study of pressure points. The art originated in India. It was taken to China. You will learn both aspects of it. Its lesson is this: the energies of the body are interconnected and concentrate themselves into 108 varmas. You, the pair of you, also share energy and represent concentrations of force."

Elizabeth shakes her arm until feeling returns. "Interesting trick." Natasha doesn't have to ask what happened, she can tell what the effect was. She moves warily, observing The Man closely as her twin moves with her, fanning out just enough to make attacking both of them at once difficult. "So how does that work, anyway? Can you take your enemy down without serious injury? Sounds like something from that Xena show."

The Man nods, extending a hand, exhibiting his outstretched fingers. "The objective is to overmaster the enemy without destroying him. Of course, you can also work on your own pressure points - to restore yourself, or to empower yourself. Or each other." He moves again, advancing with both arms out stretched, hands lazily waving like a pair of cobras.

Elizabeth and Natasha get a feeling that the hands are the greatest danger, and so give him a wide berth. "How do we counter it?" asks Natasha. "Could go for the old-fashion bum-rush," quips Elizabeth. "This is probably gonna hurt." Elizabeth laughs, "Gotta face your oh shit moments, sis. Learning is an inherently painful process." Natasha moves forward first, right in front of her sister, kicking in a powerful sweep. Elizabeth leaps over her sister, reaching out for the wrists of the Man. They want to see just how good this guy is, after all.

"Grasping at clouds," the Man murmurs. He's already moved past the window of opportunity, and neither sister can quite tell when it happened. Two fingertips from each of his hands rest on their necks. He moves away, gaining a few yards of range. "Feint, then strike. Invite your opponent to attack, then strike at his limb as it comes. Guide him into blocking one of your attacks, then strike the nerves he exposes on his blocking limb." He clasps his fingers into fists. "Stop thinking about punches and kicks."

"The body is land and water. Large fields, interspersed with narrow rivers. Don't bother with the land - muscle, tissue, or sinews. Causing blunt damage isn't your objective. Look for the rivers, and strike where they intersect." He adopts another fighting stance, low and sinuous. "Strike only at the rivers."

The twins pause and nod, listening carefully. This isn't the pair of girls who skipped most of high school. "The river." Natasha looks at Elizabeth for a moment, watching her sister move forward, then nods her head quickly. They again focus on The Man, moving close, then pausing to consider their next move. "He's faster than we are," says Elizabeth honestly. "Probably stronger," adds Natasha. But they show no lack of confidence. The sisters change tactics, moving very close, until it would seem that they surely should fall over each other, but somehow their motions are more graceful, more certain. They will not challenge The Man's greater reach, but move carefully inside it, both ready to counter, shifting their focus to exposed nerves, weak points that might be revealed in any attack.

The Man flashes an opening, but withdraws it too fast to be struck. Again he throws a pair of quick jabs, and again he is exposed - but not quite long enough to be struck. And so it goes, the sparring and the counterstrikes and the ripostes. In time the sisters realize what he is doing. He is showing them the river, subtly discouraging them with painful but harmless raps to sensitive skin when they guess wrong, smiling in encouragement when they detect rightly.

The sisters used to have a lack of focus, but that seems absent. They know when someone is trying to help them, and these days they are smart enough to take advantage. They push harder and harder, smiling at failure just as much as success. If they realize that they are moving faster and worker harder than they could have when they lived they do not show it. For now, they lose themselves in the demands of the moment.

"Enough!" At last the Man has had his fill for the day. His brow is sweaty; this has cost him actual effort. "We'll be learning the 108 varma as we go. You'll be sparring against each other as well. For today, though, take a breather. There's something else I want to impress on you both."

Natasha and Elizabeth laugh, rather worn from the experience as well. "What is it?" The word impress gets their attention in a very real way. "I'm hoping it's not another way to make my arm feel like a jellyfish flopping at my side," murmurs a grinning Natasha.

"You both died." The Man is smiling, but his voice is solemn. "You had your chance. Destiny no longer flows through you the way it does with a living person. You're here because someone had compassion on your souls. When it comes time for you to use these fighting skills, I expect you both to remember what is really on the line."

"It's not about winning a fight or proving yourselves better. You're testing your fate against the fate of your opponent. The consequences can be bad if you fail. They can also be terrible if you succeed. That is why the Varma Ati and Varma Kalai are what they are."

"We learned a great deal," says Natasha seriously. "About forgiveness, about love, and about how precious and important life is." Elizabeth smiles and agrees, "We will fight with all our souls, but we will know what we fight for, and we will know with our whole hearts that it is worth fighting for."

The Man nods. "Very well. We'll meet again tomorrow at the same time."

While the Raven is Morgan's chief focus, there are plenty of times when Marlene simply loses patience with his constant attempts to change the content, the specifications, and sometimes even the design. "Do you ever want this thing to be done?" she'd say. Fortunately, there's always something going on in Tijuana that can use his special touch.

In fact, there are so many people who want to seek out his advice, or his judgment on an issue, that he decides that his primary goal is to make sure the town's other leading figures and institutions continue to be the venue of first resort. He still makes the rounds of Tijuana every so often, but he makes it clear to the people that they should trust in the system; after all, had he and his fellow Celestials not done their utmost to make sure the system _is_ trustworthy?

And then there's Esperanzita. Even given the presently low Essence of Gaia, it seems to Morgan that a City Mother can be so much more than a well-intentioned but mute child-spirit with a penchant for distributing cookies. But what to do about it?

Morgan is only just beginning to learn about the occult, but there is one thing he does remember from his studies: that the natural language of the spirit world is Old Realm. Could it be that the girl is mute simply because she does not speak Spanish? And so, just as he learned to speak Spanish fluently simply by forming the will and the intent to do so, Morgan discovers that by simply knowing that Old Realm exists, a mere focused effort of will draws forth the knowledge of that language from his divine spark.

Old Realm is a wondrous language. The tongue of the gods indeed. As Morgan works with it in his mind, he realizes the simplicities of it and the complexities. The grammar and the vocabulary are unlike any Earthly language. It can be taught to anyone; it's no harder than English or Spanish at bottom. What makes it beautiful is the ambiguity and extensibility of it. A sufficiently clever speaker can use it to describe _anything_, if he can formulate the words.

Morgan also knows, of course, that he will need help from others, if he is to succeed in his intent to educate a nascent goddess. But first, he must learn if he is on the right track. Esperanzita is never _too_ hard to find - after all, she generally doesn't try to hide from people. And so, in Old Realm, he addresses her: "Hello, Esperanzita. Tell me... you've been so helpful to us. Is there anything we can do to help _you_?"

The little girl's eyes get very wide and she gasps quickly. Then she turns and runs, skirt bouncing about, arms flailing. Morgan goes after her on instinct. He meets up with her out front of Santiago's house. She's come out the door with a notebook in hand, and presses it into his hands. Then as he accepts it, she hops up and down, rocks on her heels, rubs her hands, and in all other regards betrays absolute impatience.

The notebook is obviously meant to be read. Morgan opens it up. He recognizes the writing now, for the letters are those of the gods' language. And he recognizes the cadence, the flow of the words, the poetic nature. It is a prayer, and he is meant to utter it.

"'Ages past to ages future, a bright present and a city on the abyss, the Sun's light on ancient faces, the hills and valleys of my youth...'" Morgan reads, finding his voice able to maintain cadence and chant the prayer. He feels Essence welling into the words themselves. He reads to the end. "'Be not bound by circumstance. Take at once thy scythe and thy rod, see that the hearth is lit and the heart succored.'"

Immediately Esperanzita bursts into a torrent of speech, all in Old Realm. She leaps forward, hugging Morgan tightly. "Thankyousomuch!IloveyoumisterMorganyou'rethebest.YousaidtheprayerIknewyoucoulddoitIknewitIalwaysknewyou'dlearnitIhavesomuchtotellyouit'sbeensoboringbecausenobodycouldspeaktomeuntilnow.."

Morgan can't help but laugh in delight. "I'm just sorry it took me so long to realize it," he says in response. "So what's been on your mind all this time?"

"WelldaddysaidIwasagoodcookbutallIknowhowtomakeiscookies,didyouknow..." Esperanzita stops to take a long breath, slowing down with an effort of will. "I love cookies, they're so easy to bake and people really love them. I put everything I can into them. It's so nice to see people smiling when they enjoy them. But I don't know how to ask people what their favorite cookies are and it's really frustrating because I want to make what they want but I don't know, I just know when people want them and there's a lady coming to visit you and I have no idea what she wants either so I'm going to have to guess, I think she's from somewhere far away.."

The border crossing between Tijuana and San Diego is one of the busiest international checkpoints in the world. Thousands of people cross this patch of ground every day. The American side is clean and muted, staffed by a sea of grim, serious, officious police officers. The Mexican police are just as professional, and just as serious; but their job is easier: let the Yankees in to spend their money, then get them out before the traffic snarls. Familiarity has bred contempt between both sides.

As a result, neither police force takes particular notice of a young woman travelling alone on a Greyhound bus, though both take the time to caution her that some parts of town can be dangerous places. The young woman smiles and nods, playing the role of a naive tourist perfectly. She exits the Greyhound bus and boards a Tijuana city bus, seemingly knowing where she's going already.

The bus winds through town far from the Avenue of the Revolution, eventually passing near the residence of one Santiago Vasconcelas. The woman's research tells her that she'll find what she seeks here, and she's not mistaken. She signals for a stop a discrete block away and approaches on foot. In front of the house, a tall anglo man is having an animated discussion with a young Spanish girl. The visitor runs through all the possible scenarios of impropriety and rejects them; she remembers the man as being just a bit too upright and uptight to take advantage of a schoolgirl. Besides, the language they are speaking is not Spanish. So she settles on the simple element of surprise.

Lexi stalks up behind Poe and gets within speaking distance. "Didn't know you liked them so young, _tovarisch_," she grins. "Is that why you're hiding down here?"

Morgan, whose mind had been totally occupied with the question of what a young goddess needs to know, is taken entirely off guard by that familiar voice. "Lexi! Of all the..." he begins, grimacing for a moment before realizing she's probably jesting. "Well, this _is_ a surprise," he says, regaining his sunny demeanor. "What brings you to sunny Tijuana this fine day?"

Lexi raises her eyebrow; the other hidden by her eyepatch. "I was hoping you might tell me," she singsongs. "You and your friends come to my place of business, take me to visit a morgue, and then disappear. And then I see this." She fishes out a notebook and flips to a newspaper clipping; opening day at the power plant. Newton Benford features prominently in a photo; Jet is in the background, Poe is in the crowd with the press. "No mistaking these three, though your scientist friend is less recognizable without his wheelchair." She puts the notebook away. "So I ride bus from San Francisco. I hear all kinds of strange things along the way. Tell me, are you still reporting the news? Or are you now making it?" Lexi grins without malice; clearly she's pleased with herself for guessing right.

"I'd like to say both," says Morgan, "but since that power plant announcement, I've mostly been working on something that isn't exactly either. It is going to change the world, I think, but I'm rather hoping it _doesn't_ attract too much attention, at least until it's too late to stop it." He chuckles. "Perhaps I should explain..."

Lexi looks puzzled. "Yes, I would like to hear it. But will it be as simple as that, or will you be keeping secrets now? Such as who your friend is?" She introduces herself to Esperanzita in Russian-accented Spanish. "My name is Lexi. What may I call you?"

"She doesn't speak Spanish yet, though she understands it," says Morgan. "Her name's Esperanzita. Esperanzita, this is Lexington Dallas. She was working with us for a while back in the States."

Esperanzita smiles and waves, and extends a hand. In it is a cookie.

Lexi takes the cookie from the younger woman, smiling sweetly, even though she's obviously confused by the 'yet' in that statement.

Morgan takes this chance to briefly explain about Raven: a mobile software platform designed to be _the_ answer to organizing activism online. An easy way for people to both read and publish information and communicate with each other, and more. "Lots of people can't afford a PC, or use it effectively. A mobile phone's much more within reach."

Lexi looks impressed, for here on a street corner in Mexico, she has found something very familiar. "You are making a channel for _samizdat,_" she says. "I did not think that you had revolutionary leanings."

"Have you ever been to Tijuana before now?" Morgan says, grinning. "My friends and I have already started a little revolution here. Not against the _official_ government, mind you, but against the thugs who used to run the place." He pulls out his notebook and flips it to the page containing the Raven logo. "But we can't be everywhere. _This_ can."

Now Lexi looks a little disappointed. "Official government? Thugs? Mister Morgan, have _you_ ever been to _Russia_? I can tell you stories of such things." She picks up her battered suitcase. "It is lucky for you, that I found you. There is so much that you need to learn. Is there somewhere we can go? Somewhere less... bright?" She squints through her one eye at the surroundings, which are shimmering in the heat of the approach of the noon. It isn't lost on her that Morgan is looking more tan, but Berkelely is far less sunny.

"I'm rather enjoying the sunshine," says Morgan, smiling at his private joke. But he consents to lead the way to a little cafe where the umbrellas provide some shade, as well as a cool breeze. "So tell me," Morgan says, leaning forward. "What do I need to learn about revolutions?" Though he is grinning, he is entirely serious in his intent.

Lexi lights up a cigarette, because in Mexico you can't go to jail for smoking in a restaurant. "You know about Marx, I am sure. How to organize, how to educate, how to agitate. Well. My grandfather lived through Stalin and my father lived through the Cold War. They could recite Marx like some yankees recite Saint Paul." She takes a drag, lets it out slowly.

"Here is the problem, though," she continues. "People pick and choose from Marx like he is the _dim sum_ cart. They do not understand that the revolution must be continuous. That it can never stop. Otherwise, the party on the left becomes the party on the right. You want Gagarin and Tchaikovsky. You get Stalin and Kruschev. Russians of my generation hear about two revolutions in living memory. Tell me, Mister Morgan, who is president of Russia now? And what did he do before that?"

"Do you mean the _official_ president," asks Morgan, "or the power behind the throne that used to work for the KGB?" He nods somberly.

"Exactly," Alexi grunts, make a stabbing motion with the cigarette like a paper dart. "And your George Herbert Walker Bush, as well, though he seemed pretty harmless as his kind goes." She takes another drag, and crushes the cigarette out in the heavy glass ashtray. "Revolutions are corrupted, people would rather be comfortable than fight for what is proper, the papers overlook inconvenient truths. So where does that leave your pet bird, when AT&T or Marlboro or Fox News wants to buy ad space?"

"That's one of the biggest problems I'm working on right now," Morgan acknowledges. "The first step is that it has to be self-sustaining, so that it _can_ survive without them stepping in. That's not enough, of course, but even that can't be totally solved with technology."

Lexi grins. "At least you're smart enough to know that isn't easy." Then she's serious again. "Change of subject. You left my shop. Bodies stop turning up in dumpsters. Now you're learning to lead revolutions. I have your life's work in my laptop and got to read it on the bus. This isn't how I figured you." She leans back a bit, folds her hands. "As they say... 'what the fuck'?"

"So they did stop," Morgan muses. "Good. Maybe that means we've bought a little time." He looks up again. "Before I answer that, I have a question. How do you get people to accept a frightening and dangerous truth? Not believe it - accept it."

Lexi nods. "You must erode their complacency and denial. Often the denial is because the average person doesn't think they can change anything. It helps to convince them that they can. The tool I choose is _samizdat_ - subversive publications." She grins again. "And it worked on you, didn't it?"

Morgan laughs. "Indeed. Well, it's good to know I'm on the right track, then. We just need to get things to an even bigger audience, that's all." He sobers. "Because the organ-legging operation is just the tip of the iceberg."

Lexi says, "Really. Do you know how deep it goes, Captain Smith?"

"There's a lot we don't know," Morgan says. "But what we _do_ know is huge." He takes a deep breath, and looks at Lexi. _Well, I've got to start somewhere._ "Specifically, that the Earth is being invaded by machine beings from another dimension that want to turn our world into a place of perfect order."

Lexi laughs out loud, even slapping her knee. "Oh, come ON," she chokes out, fumbling in her jacket for another cigarette. "I saw that one in the theater. The boy was cute."

"Well, how about this one, then?" Morgan adds, grinning. "To fight these Assembled beings, the gods of the sun, moon, and stars have sent their champions to this world, the Chosen of the gods imbued with a fragment of their divine power. Have I convinced you that I'm totally around the bend yet?"

Lexi tries to light another cigarette through a giggle fit and finally gives up. She waves at the reporter with the mauled remnants of the butt. "You are lucky that I am from Berkeley," she sputters. "You learn to like madmen there. OK. So evil robots from Planet X are fighting moon gods in Mexico. And you're fighting it by putting FaceBook on cell phones. Show me how in Hell that works."

Morgan chuckles. "Well, Raven is only one piece of the puzzle. It's the part that _prepares_ people to learn the truth. As you might guess, just telling people isn't going to work, because they'll think we're mad. Although I have an answer to that too. You see, the reason I know all this..." He leans forward, facing Lexi directly, and allows his Caste Mark to illuminate. "...is that I'm one of the Chosen."

Lexi startles at Morgan's 'magic tattoo', and looks back and forth between Morgan and Esperanzita to see if the young girl reacts. The little goddess is, of course, similing and placid; this isn't strange for her. That seems to affect Lexi more than the 'special effect'. "That's a good trick."

"Don't worry, he shows it to all the girls," comes a voice that is half amused, half biting. Natasha Ivanova.. or is it Elizabeth has stalked up within earshot. Her twin forms a curious mirror, one in black, the other white, both wearing hints of silver in honor of their absent friend. "Really, Morgan, what are you trying to do, flashing that thing around?"

Morgan turns and smiles. "Ah, hello there, Ms. Ivanova," he says - he still hasn't worked out how to tell the difference between the twins, and so avoids embarrassing himself by getting it wrong. "I'm trying to explain to Lexi here what everyone on the planet is going to have to know before the year is out. Only I don't think she quite believes me yet," he adds, winking at Lexi.

Lexi turns around to see the approaching girls. She gives Poe a sullen glare. "Three is just selfish. Or four, I guess. We still haven't seen your other lady friend." She manages to light her cigarette this time. "I tell you, you need me. Stop yanking my chain, yankee, or I'm going home."

"He's not yanking your chain," says the twin in white. "I'm Natasha, and if you want to know the truth, if you want to know why humanity really flounders and fails on its own, you will have to take a risk." The other grins impishly, "I'm Elizabeth, and as much as I hate to admit it, you have to trust this guy. However, if you imply that we're with him again I'm going to have to be impolite in proving our point."

Morgan turns his attention back to Lexi. "I'm not yanking your chain," he says, utterly serious now. "If you don't believe me, next time you get a chance, see if you can replicate this," he says, tapping his forehead. "It's impossible. No man or woman's forehead can glow in that pattern unless they're an authentic Solar Exalted." He sighs. "Of course, I understand it's not an easy experiment to attempt. But I guarantee you, no matter how hard you try, you will fail."

Lexi puts down her cigarette. "Ivanova, hmm? Gavarish pa ruski?" _Do you speak Russian?_

Natasha snickers at the question and nods. Elizabeth replies in fluent Russian, "Does a bear shit in the woods?"

Natasha looks to Elizabeth. "We are wasting time." She moves to the table and seizes the glass ashtray. "I'll pay for it later. And now." With a squeeze it doesn't just break, but almost explode from the raw force of it. That act isn't enough alone to cut her, though. She has to take a shard of it and slice along her arm. "Here. Tell me you have seen this trick before." There is no blood flowing, but instead a silver substance.

It is to Lexi's journalistic credit that she doesn't startle... much. In addition, a common language elevates the Ivanova sisters from Poe's arm candy to the status of her distant relatives. The color drains from her face as she witnesses the demonstration in fascination and horror. "Just the arm," she croaks, "or all over?"

"All over." Elizabeth sighs softly, reaching into a pocket. She holds out a folded bit of paper. "Better this than how it was before. You can verify that little article if you like, or you can just listen to Morgan. If you listen, you will believe, and I think you will even have the courage to do something about it."

Lexi takes the proferred slip of paper and unfolds it. An obituary... for the two women standing in front of her. She sits still as a rock for a full fifteen seconds before leaping off the bench and running down the street... but she doesn't get far. She stops at a storm drain barely a hundred feet away and begins to vomit violently, sobbing and cursing in Russian and English.

Morgan goes to Lexi's side. "You see now, why I'm concerned about how people will accept this," he says softly, soothingly, returning to English himself. He knows he could speak in Russian instead, but feels that it would be... intrusive, somehow. Instead, he pours his talent into calming the overwhelmed journalist. "We gave it to you straight, without any preparation. And you strike me as being more than usually prepared to believe the impossible."

The twins aren't sure if they should follow or not. They let Esperanzita decide for them. They flank the child goddess on either side, doing as they usually do when walking with her. They point out various things, saying the names in Spanish, trying to teach and probably delay the child a little bit on the way to Lexi and Morgan.

For once, Lexi doesn't have a ready response. "What the fuck, man," she groans. "What the FUCK." She rolls into a sitting position and hugs her legs to her chest. "OK, fine. Killer robots. Can't be worse than that idiot Khrushchev." She forces her breathing back to normal over a few long minutes. "You will still need me." Morgan can tell that most of her bravado is forced... but not all.

Morgan nods. "Yes, I believe I will," he says, sincerely. "There's too much I still need to learn. Some of it will come naturally to me, but that just means I'll learn fast. It doesn't mean I don't have a lot _to_ learn yet."

"That's a Russian," says Natasha. "From mad despair to courage in what, three seconds?" She smiles and nods respectfully at Lexi.

"Yeah," Lexi staggers to her feet. "To hell with Marx anyway. Bloated German windbag. Okay, we do your thing. Take me to your secret lair."

"Marx was a poser," agrees Elizabeth. She looks to Morgan, "If you want, I'll look after our child goddess for a while while you guys do the whole Bruce Wayne thing."

Morgan nods to Elizabeth. "You do that," glancing at Lexi to see if she caught the 'goddess' part. "Now that we've brought Lexi into our little conspiracy, she needs to hear the fine details." He chuckles. "Unfortunately, we haven't got a Batmobile yet. Might be a good idea, though."
