# Fall of Eden 2008-04-11

Lexi has been diverted to look at the interesting sights of the Mexican city of Tijuana. And while the mortal woman is gone, the Man tells Morgan that as the remaining non-Sidereal, he needs to deal with yet another local problem.

The problem is housed in a small adobe shack well outside the city. It is kept imprisoned with a finely-meshed cage. It is shackled to one of the walls and kept sedated. It is the Lunar, Jaguar Hombre. Even without his Essence (and the Man is absolutely certain that he has none left), the raving lunatic is a danger to himself and to others.

Today the Man brings his twin proteges, the Ivanova sisters, along with Morgan. Today, as every day, he's brought a high-caliber automatic pistol along. And today, as before, he tells Morgan his spiel.

"Jet brought this guy in, ignored _his_ wishes, ignored _my_ advice, then ran the fuck off. Now _you_ need to come to a decision about what to do with this guy. My vote is to recycle him, but I have a strong fuckin' policy about making suggestions - not taking action."

"So you think there's no hope for him then?" asks Elizabeth softly. "Isn't there always some small chance?" murmurs Natasha. They both look to Morgan, and then to the gun. "As I understand it, it is your kind of choice to make."

Morgan contemplates the firearm. "I'm almost convinced myself," he says, glancing at the mad Lunar. "But there's just too much I don't understand. Maybe it's a personal failing, but it's not enough for me to know he wants to die. I need to understand _why_ he wants to. And for that I need to know how he got that way." The Solar reporter looks upon Jaguar Hombre's visage, still warped by his internal turmoil despite the sedation. "Jet said something about him being a 'chimera'. What does that mean?"

The Man speaks above the sudden outburst of incoherent screaming from the cage. "I talked to ..." He pauses, turning toward the entrance. "Here he is now."

Roger Wolf Pads, the Native American No Moon, has arrived late. He nods his head. "Chimera," the Man says, and Roger nods.

"A chimera, Mr. Morgan, is.. a Lunar who has no totem. Or a Lunar who has lost his totemic connection through exposure to the Wyld. This man has a totem, it seems, and this world has no Wyld. No Wyld, that is, except the spark of it that all Lunars carry with us. But understand that those were the two simplest routes to total madness and atavism. This poor soul has arrived there by another means, it seems."

"Madness is a sickness, can it not be cured?" Elizabeth looks to the suffering man and sighs, "Surely this was not what his destiny was meant to be."

"Cure AIDS," the Man grunts. He holds up a hand at Morgan. "Yeah, I know Barry's experiment. But that took magic. Some diseases have no real cure."

"Are you sure, or are you guessing?" asks Natasha. "Please spell it out clearly."

Morgan rubs his chin. "I see," he says. "I mean, I don't claim to understand, but... you're telling me that to be a chimera is to be mad. I don't need to be a Twilight to see a connection. Perhaps... perhaps he had a touch of madness before Luna came to him, and that was the seed..." Morgan shakes his head. "But if that's the cause, then the cure, if there is one, would _have_ to be magical."

"Or you could just shoot him." The Man's tone of voice is anything but long-suffering. "We don't _know_ the problem. To the extent that you care, feel free to figure it out. But remember that he's a maniac."

"Is there any reason not to table this for now?" asks Elizabeth. "He seems, for the moment, to be a collared nuisance. Of course, if he can regain some essence that will change very, very quickly."

Morgan shakes his head. "No, the Man's right about this. It's..." He struggles to find the words. "You can see that he's suffering, Elizabeth. I can't leave him like this. Either I start _now_ to find a cure for him..." He nods to the Man's piece. "Or we end his suffering some other way."

"So make the choice," says Elizabeth. "Both answers are right, aren't they?" Natasha nods, "Then both are virtuous choices. The one that is more likely to succeed is to put him down."

Morgan studies Hombre as he draws breath for another howl, and tries to sort through what he knows. Somewhere along the line, Jaguar Hombre did manage to get tattooed; he knows this has something to do with Lunar stability, although it doesn't seem to have been sufficient here. He also knows that Hombre was able to attain beastman form, something which Jet could only do with an Engine - so he must have gotten one, somehow.

"How did he get the tattoos?" asks Morgan. "Someone somewhere must've known the secret to them. Could it have been him himself?"

Roger explains that it's impossible to give the tattoos to yourself; it has to be done by another Lunar, and the No Moons are generally the only ones to know the secrets. "So there's another Lunar out there," Morgan says. "That's a promising thought all by itself. We should try to find him or her. Even if they can't help us with Jaguar, maybe that one is more stable."

Morgan stares at Hombre for a moment longer, then nods. "But before I go try to find Hombre's mentor, I want to have a better idea of what might be wrong with the man himself." He turns to the others. "Give me a hand getting him to the Chair. I need to have a look for myself."

"Guess that means it's up to us," says Elizabeth. She sighs softly. "So it seems.." Natasha and Elizabeth move forward, looking to the Man to open the cage before grabbing hold of Hombre. There is, for a moment, a struggle, but the twins move together, and their hands are like serpents, striking in swift succession until the Lunar falls limp.

With the mad Lunar's lights out, it's not hard to get the man strapped securely into the Symbiogenesis Machine. After that, guided by Benford's notes, Morgan is soon tinkering with the Chair and talking with Eddie. However, unlike Jet's expedition, which focused on Hombre's symbiote-vessel, Morgan's dive into Jaguar Hombre's soul is intended to examine the Lunar spark itself.

Morgan is not the expert on the occult that some of his compatriots are, but he has been a conscientious student - and he is also armed with the knowledge that Jaguar is a chimera, what a chimera _is_, and what that might mean. This is more forensic work than interrogation, but Morgan treats the experience the same way he might treat a hostile interviewee - asking questions (using the Contrite Diagnostic Experience), studying the answers, and relying on his intuition to make sense of what he finds. Or, in this case likely as not, tracing down the nonsense to its source.

The CDE interfaces to the Vessel itself. But, of course, the Vessel also attaches to the Spark of Exaltation. Through indirect query, Morgan is able to attain a connection to its Essence. And just as Benford once made a connection to Jet when she was suffering a shapeshifter's syndrome, Morgan now feels himself joined with the Exalted soul of the Jaguar Hombre.

'And the earth was without form, and void; and dakness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.'

The darkness surrounds Morgan. He is now beyond the Chair and its experience, beyond a simple (if arcane) connection to an ephemeral device of light. He is touching a soul twisted and blackened. Tormented currents of agony and accumulated pools of undirected emotion seep into his awareness.

The briefest moments of Jaguar's lucidity strike like flashes of lightning in a 'sky' ever clouded by uncontrollable rage. Fire burns in his damaged heart. Oceans of tears have flooded the inner map of his mind.

Storms are fed by some source of energy. The hurricane that rages through Jaguar's mind is not powered by sunlight and ocean currents, but by something else - something of the mind or soul. Morgan charges forward into the teeth of that storm, seeking its source, clutching his own self-knowledge tightly around his spirit to protect himself from the fury that surrounds him.

Jaguar's rage joins with Morgan's own soul just as much as Morgan's mind navigates the Lunar's. He feels himself being torn at, feels Jaguar Hombre attacking him for being different, for not raging as he does, for sparing his life. And Morgan feels his own inadequacies. He sees his weaknesses. His failures rise up, shrieking with the South American man's animal voice.

"This isn't about me!" insists Morgan 'aloud', asserting himself against Jaguar's assaults on his psyche. "Why do you rage so? What has the world done to you?" Such ideas are normally used ironically, but not now; Morgan's attitude makes it clear that he is prepared to believe that the world _has_ abused Jaguar, and to listen, if Jaguar can but present his case.

The stormy inner world of the soul laughs and rages, and a palpable wall of hate slams into Morgan's ego. The love of his life, betraying him to his hated enemy, could not provoke such a primal feeling.

Morgan is forced to hold himself together, clinging to the knowledge of who he is - Andrew Morgan, the seeker of truth. This time, he bolsters his drive to understand the madness of Jaguar Hombre with his Solar birthright, manifesting in the mindscape as a golden glowing double-edged sword of truth, wielded to cut through the self-pity and hostility of Jaguar's mind and get through to the wounds that bleed from his heart.

The wild lands of confusion and sorrow and vile anger tear away at Morgan, despite his efforts. And yet the Solar nature simply cannot be denied. Here in the heart of a mad Lunar, the radiance of gold surrounds him. And Jaguar Hombre rages further. How could any man, in any human lifetime, have been twisted into such a terrible mockery?

Unreasoning though it is, the force of Jaguar's rage saps at Morgan's soul. And Morgan decides that it is taking too long to marshal arguments and inquiries, and instead summons the bludgeon of his force of personality to see him through. 'I am a man of truth,' his spirit says. 'I can weather whatever you muster against me, for my heart is pure. Let me help you, and I will lend you my strength in return.'

Unbidden and unexpected, a memory surges through Morgan. Hunter and Edward are washed away, made obsolete in a single moment. It is the memory of suffering. Morgan realizes at that moment that his Exalted soul once resembled this one. There is kinship.

"I remember," whispers Morgan's larger and greater self. "I was slain for my madness. I lost the Light of the Sun." Morgan's sword grows larger and stronger, for it is now held by more capable hands. The reporter feels the aura of another wrap itself around him.

The blackness that is here, and the hurt and the longing, all feel the kinship as well. They seek to flow into Morgan, to occupy it, and now he understands part of what Jaguar Hombre is doing: trying to force the madness out of himself in any way he can. With just his own mind, there was nowhere to go. Now he assaults Morgan simply to find succor.

Armed with this new knowledge, Morgan presses onward. His own mind is strong, and grown stronger with the recovered memory. "Yes! Give your pain to me!" he calls, his voice ringing above the gale-force winds of unrequited fury and challenging them to dash themselves against his soul. "You have borne it long enough on your own!"

This time, the hurricane catches Morgan up and blows him away. Jaguar's rage strengthens the memory of Poe's former life as it pours into him - and too late, Morgan vaguely realizes the peril in doing so. For the strengthening connection with that past life allows some of that long-dead Solar's madness to escape its prison and seep into Morgan himself - and yet Morgan endures still, as best he can, knowing it is the only way to save Jaguar.

The fury of the storm abates somewhat. And beyond the storm, the Moon. And he has arrived at his goal. The Truth.

It was his drive for power that twisted the Lunar so. He chose constantly to invoke the power of the Engine to attain his war form. He reveled in its power. But something about it made him wrong, corrupted him. And Morgan remembers what Snake had said. "The Engine works by intensifying one's own nature." Whatever is wrong with Jaguar Hombre is wrong with _him_.

The man himself is not prone to madness. The Vessel, as Snake said, is without flaw - unless Snake, himself, was lying. What is left? Just the Exaltation itself. This becomes more and more apparent as Morgan probes his own feelings. Whatever madness Jaguar is afflicted with is something the Solar can also be struck with. And what do they share? The Exaltation itself.

Morgan's aura, his older and larger self, whispers to him. The Usurpation. The Lunars - bravest beings in Creation - fled. The Solars - wisest god-kings in Creation - became tyrants. What of Jaguar? What of _him_?

"Kotetsu Jin..." whispers Morgan, remembering the encounter with the Assembled at the Lord's Holy Cathedral. "He said that we were enemies of order..." He looks out onto the storm. "Is this what he meant? Is this what makes us the enemy of the Assembled?"

The storm has abated, but Morgan feels a tragic inevitability. This moment of peace and truth is a respite. But despite the pain he has taken in, Morgan knows that Jaguar Hombre will, sooner or later, become the raging storm he has been. And if Morgan wishes to quiet him, he will have to battle him again.

Morgan can feel the storm within him mirroring the one without, threatening to overwhelm his own sanity. He knows that he cannot take more of Jaguar's pain today, lest he lose his own grip. And so, while Jaguar's madness is at a low ebb, Morgan takes advantage of the respite to make the return journey back to himself.
