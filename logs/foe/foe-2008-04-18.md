# Fall of Eden 2008-04-18

"So, you ready?" The words are delivered with a smirk. Elizabeth stands facing her sister in the gathering shadows of night. The two have taken to sparring each other in the remnants of some ambitious building project that ran out of its funding years ago. It serves as a great place for their work. No people, lots of cover, and incredibly treacherous footing for their fighting style.

Natasha's answer is always the same. The fighting starts more like a dance, the two so intune with each other's skills that the entire thing looks like expert coreography. Blocks and strikes rattling in the air.

Elizabeth gives ground, using the space she has to deflect the flurry and then begin to respond in kind. A sudden sweeping of her leg first seems a move to trip her sister, but she is able to stop the attack midway and flick the lose sand up in a cloud at her sister's eyes. Their is no dirty fighting, only fighting.

Natasha closes her eyes and in that moment she strikes with all her power, delivering a blow like a sledgehammer into her sister's abdomen. The other girl flies backwards, shattering a wooden beam before hitting the ground. She grabs it in a single hand and spins it about her body, hurling it back at Natasha with a low growl.

The surprise counter is met with brute force. The twin's foot is flung forward, shattering the board to flinders. By the time she can move forward Elizabeth has already moved farther back, using the time to deliver numerous key strikes to the beams around her.

The sisters rejoin their melee in a blinding flurry, their hands and feet moving so fast human eyes would have trouble tracking them. Sensing an open, Elizabeth plays her trump card, leaping upward and kicking off a weakened beam. She flies upward into a web of half-prepared beams and races along as behind her the entire structure crumbles.

Feeling everything begin to fall around her, Natasha draws herself inward and waits for the very last moment to swing both hands like a hammer at the plumetting ceiling. When the dust at last settles, the building is truly a ruin and the two sisters are facing each other, smiling as they warily close the distance to continue the duel.

Lost in thought after his dive into Jaguar Hombre's warped soul, Morgan is taken off guard by the clamor. His first reaction to the collapsing building is to throw himself against the wall, reaching for the butt of his shotgun. Only when the smoke clears and he sees who it is does he relax again. _I suppose we're lucky it's just a building they're wrecking_, he thinks to himself, keeping a safe distance until he can see some sign of the match ending.

Lexi approaches Morgan from another part of the empty lot, covered in dust kicked up both by the wind and the Ivanovas. "Your friends play rough," she coughs, "especially for being dead."

"It could be worse," says Morgan, watching the two golems as they prepare for another flurry of attack and counterattack. "At least they're not Exalted." He seems unusually pensive as he says this.

"Exalted," Lexi repeats. "Like you and your friends with the magic tattoo. How much are we supposed to fear you?"

"I... don't know," says Morgan, his mind still full of his experience with Jaguar. Belatedly, he seems to realize how this must sound, and turns back to Lexi. "Not all of us are that powerful physically. But those of us who aren't... we make up for it in other ways." He smiles slightly. "We were made to be rulers of all Creation, and given power to match - but each of us uses it as we, individually see fit. Perhaps you _should_ fear that."

Morgan's hesitation is not lost on Lexi. "The most powerful men in our world did not get there by brawling, and yet all power comes from the barrel of a gun," she states flatly.

"People have gained power in all manner of ways," admits Morgan. "But true power goes to those who are followed. Whether it be out of adoration, respect, or fear." He shakes his head. "But even those who do not shape the world can still be dangerous in their own way."

Lexi finds a suitable piece of rubble to use as a seat while the Ivanovas warm up for another round of demolition. "Your plan to save the world with smart phones is not so crazy," she says, "but if your enemies are as powerful as you say, you don't have a lot of time."

Morgan seems to brighten up. "I've been thinking about that," he says. "There's more to this than the mundane, you see. Something like Raven can be given occult substance as well... strange as it may sound. You've heard that ideas have power, but in the hands of the Exalted, it's more than just a metaphor."

Lexi says, "Frankly it sounds loony, but today, if you told me that Mars is made of Silly Putty, I wouldn't ignore you. Besides," she shrugs, "it's one of the things I thought I would have to teach you. Most of the power of these things is in spreading ideas. They become real when people act on them."

Morgan nods. "Exactly. But..." He sighs, and looks back the way he came. "What are we doing this for? It's one thing to resist the Assembled vision of humanity, but what are we going to put in its place?" He sighs. "We Exalted are changing the shape of the world just by existing here, you know. Not in the ordinary sense. The actual structure of reality. We don't really belong here any more than the Assembled do."

Lexi frowns and stands up. "Maybe so, but in the end, who cares what you think? No, really," she says quickly, cutting off a reply. "You worry too much. The whole point of this thing is that your followers aren't worker ants. So they'll make their own choices, right? And we'll all get what we all choose. The man or God or whatever did this to you, he gave you a choice while you were just a man. That goes for us mere mortals too. Don't worry about what happens when you're in total control, because you never will be." The girl dusts herself off. "You should introduce me to your hacker friend."

Morgan nods. "I'll do that. And then... I've got a decision to make."

Morgan loads the cube marked 'Newton Benford' into the Symbiogenesis Machine. "I don't know if you'll have any more insight than I will," says Morgan to the transtech recording block, "but at least I'll get to spread my ignorance." He checks the connections one last time, then climbs into the machine and straps himself in, tightening the wire-festooned skullcap around his head.

Newton Benford - or something a lot like him - responds with his usual upbeat cheer. "Oh, God. I'm the copy, aren't I?" The construct gives the mental equivalent of a shrug. "Am I dead, or do you just need help with an unsolvable problem?"

"The answer to question one is, I don't know," responds Morgan to the presence of his comrade-in-arms. "Your original self is still missing, on whatever errand he left on, and if he's dead, we haven't heard about it. But the important thing is, you're on the button with question two." He sums up everything he can remember from the encounter with Jaguar Hombre's mind. "I don't think I can cure him. But I'm wondering: is there anything more we can learn from his madness? Because I don't think it's just him. I fear that potential may be in all of us Exalts."

Benford considers what Poe has said. "He's going to be terribly, terribly pissed off when you let him out from under, no matter what you do. I'd frankly rather be in the presence of an armed nuclear weapon, at least that bears me no ill will. Anyway. There are two parts your answer."

"One," Benford begins, in his 'teaching voice'. "We know that using the Engine users are subject to great emotional turmoil; it's doubtful that a non-Exalted person could handle the stress. So you are right. This is something present in all of us, to the extent that this is a malady unique to the Exalted, and even we seem to have our breaking points for tolerating the inhumanly intolerable."

Benford says, "Two," he continues, "is the other hand. Nothing is impossible for the Exalted. There probably is a way to do something about Hombre's condition. The problem is, he made a choice to be this way. If you override that, you override him. Whether you kill him, or do some kind of 'soul editation' on him, it's not going to be him when you're done."

Benford's tone softens. "Honestly, I don't know which would be more right or less wrong. Either way you are 'playing God'. But... I can tell you this much. This 'Chair'? It's better than the other one. Maybe Hombre would agree. Please make sure to tell me that when you next see my meat-self."

"I will," says Morgan. "I hope your meat-self is doing good out there, and I'm looking forward to hearing from him, one way or the other. Until then... rest well."

"It's not so bad. At least it's quiet." Benford replies. "Let me know how it goes."

Morgan awakens from the light trance, and unhooks himself, as he considers his next move. Whatever man Jaguar Hombre once was, is gone. He'd suspected as much, but Benford has solidified it in his mind. He _might_ be recoverable, but only at the cost of even more research, and more psychic torment for the man in the meantime - to say nothing of the risk to others if he escaped.

But this is about more than just the maddened Lunar. If what happened to Jaguar could happen to others - Jet, Marlene, Benford, himself - then the consequences for Earth would be dire. The Exalted could still defeat the Assembled in that state, perhaps, but... "What profit a man if he gain the whole world, but lose his own soul?" Morgan mumbles, remembering a fragment of the Bible from Sunday school of his youth. As he muses, his feet trace their way from the symbiogenesis lab to Jaguar Hombre's holding cell.

Natasha watches Morgan curiously as he arrives. "So, what's the verdict, doctor?" asks Elizabeth. She looks at Morgan for a moment more and sighs quietly. "You don't have to say. I can already tell. What do we need to do?"

The Man strides in, not sweating at all in the Mexican weather despite his dapper suit, damn him. With him is a young man, fair-haired, whom Morgan recognizes from before. He's smiling, just the way the reporter remembers.

"Fancy seeing you here," says Natasha to The Man. "Who's the new guy?" She eyes up the stranger carefully. Anyone who is with The Man has got to be interesting.

"He's my Bridge partner," explains the Man blandly. The youth just smiles, waving casually to Natasha.

The Jaguar Hombre is inside his cell. He looks up, seeing the young newcomer, and snarls. The young man enters the cell, eyeing the manacles and chains. He leans close. Jaguar pauses, and the youth whispers something in his ear. After a few moments, his breathing starts to calm down, and the stranger backs away.

"Okay, smartass, does your partner there have a handle or should we just call him The Man's Best Friend?" fires back Natasha.

"You can call me Hugh if you like. A nickname." The youth giggles, then subsides. "Your friend here should be cogent for a few minutes." He looks straight at Morgan. "Remember who you really are," he says. "And who he is."

Morgan is intensely interested in what just happened. "How did you do that?" says Morgan to the young man. "We weren't able to get him to calm down with anything short of prescription-strength sedatives."

"Oh, I just reminded him of something," says Hugh, smiling. "I can remind you _too_, but I think you already know."

Lexi creeps in behind the Man and the nameless youth. She doesn't announce her presence, sensing that the people gathered in the room already know all they need to about her, and can't be fooled anyway.

Morgan peers at 'Hugh'. "Does this have something to do with what you told me earlier?" he says.

Hugh shrugs winsomely. "Oh, maybe. But you're wasting time."

Elizabeth and Natasha watch with mirrored frowns. They share this expression whenever there's a lot of babble going on they don't even want to go through the bother of understanding. Elizabeth notices Lexi creeping in and shifts her focus, offering a quick wave. "Welcome to the bridge party."

Lexi just nods in return, keeping her wary eye on the blond boy.

Morgan knows a brush-off when he hears it, but the youth is right. There's a more pressing matter at hand. "I've interacted directly with Jaguar's mind," he says, explaining the situation to those around him. "The Man was right. Jaguar Hombre's madness came from using the Engine constantly, but the Engine is not the cause. It's merely tapped some source of madness in his Exaltation itself. And it's not just him." He swallows. "Something like that happened to one of my past lives. I think it can happen to any of us."

"Hey.. " The voice is quiet. But it's unmistakeably the Lunar.

Morgan's eyes widen in surprise. "What is it, Jaguar?" he asks, just as softly.

"Don' let me die useless," Jaguar whispers. "I remember your t'oughts. You t'ought bout keepin me alive.. figurin' out t'is shit, yah?"

Morgan stares at Jaguar for a moment. "Yes... I was considering that possibility." He turns to Hugh and asks, more sharply this time, "What _did_ you say to him, mister?" There's the beginning of a glimmer of suspicion in his mind, even though he doesn't know for sure what he suspects.

"He tol' me... reminded me.." Jaguar keeps on talking, unaware or unconcerned of the target of Morgan's question. "I took t'is on to be the good guy. Do the right t'ing. Now t'is the only thing left I can do to be the hero, ya know?" His unfocused gaze traverses the cell for a few seconds before settling back on Morgan, and his head rises. "You a hero too. If you t'ink it'll help, you gotta do the right t'ing. Whatever it is. Okay? You t'ink it help, you keep me around. But if not, don' waste no more time."

It's a compelling notion. But... after all of Jaguar's ranting and raving, his sudden burst of coherence doesn't seem to be explainable by a simple reminder of the idea of being a hero. Hugh is certainly no mortal... what did he just do? Morgan thinks about what he saw, reviewing the exchange in his memory with a fine-toothed comb.

After a few moments, Morgan comes to a decision. Hugh _did_ do something - but there was no manipulation. Whatever he did merely cleared Jaguar's mind of its madness for a short while. The words Jaguar spoke are his own.

Engel's revenant voice informs Morgan of a few basic facts. "We would not study him to repair," the doctor explains. "We'd bake the soul into a storage container and isolate the spark from reincarnation. The Alchemicals wouldn't repair something they consider fundamentally flawed and dangerous."

"Nor do I have the tools to do something like this myself. It would be possible to build them, but..." The doctor trails off. "This device's own mechanisms were based on modification of the Spark, but they have evolved considerably since that time. You would need a Solar with a working knowledge of the process to even consider it."

It is at this moment that Morgan feels three presences. He recalls the sensation of Hunter S. Thompson and Edward R. Murrow, and he remembers the battle against Jaguar's soul when he felt them disappear. Now he realizes that they are gone - he no longer needs them. And in their place is a trio, who now speak with one voice.

"We have that knowledge, Alchemical," they say, "for we once performed the very act that enabled our successor Morgan to succor the Lunar. We knew the Solar Davron who created the technology behind this device, and we gave him the wisdom of Malfeas in his later endeavors. We were one of the handful to recognize what happened to the Solars of old, and we exorcised the madness at great cost to ourselves. We were Sa O Ket at that time, and we stand behind Andrew Morgan now."

"That missing part of yourself, the part of you that seeks or yearns, the empty part of you that accepted Jaguar's pain.." The three voices continue, addressing Morgan now. "That is the emptiness we cut away. Now we will teach you, and Engel, how to modify the machine to do that which you wish to do."

"Then let's get started," says Morgan, with renewed enthusiasm.
