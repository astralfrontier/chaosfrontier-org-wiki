# Fall of Eden 2008-04-25

Morgan, under the direction of his ancient Eclipse patron, has conducted a thorough study of the chair's functions and nature - as dictated by Benford, at least. Sa's avatar spirit has concluded that more is needed to do anything meaningful with Jaguar Hombre. He can be studied, for now. But his pain will not lessen without modifications to the Alchemical technology.

The only known supplier of the necessary parts is, of course, the Alchemicals themselves. And it takes only a few days for a potential lead on them to develop.

---

For the twins, free time is work time. When they aren't laying waste to ruins with advanced training they are protecting Esperanzita and Jet's family. Even with these tasks on their hands they do occasionally find time to sneak off and goof around in the sun.

Having done all he can for Jaguar at the moment, Morgan returns to his work on Raven. This time, though, he has more in mind than the technical or even the social aspects. He has come to realize that Raven potentially a truly powerful weapon in the information war against the Assembled. As a collection of linked nodes, the purpose of which is to transmit information, the Raven network will have a natural mirror in the Lands of Light - and it is to the advantage of the Exalted to make the best possible use of that.

Names are important. Morgan named the project Raven for its legendary associations with wisdom and knowledge. And many of those associations come from the tales of the Native Americans. And so it is that Morgan seeks out Roger Wolf Pads; for, in a certain sense, he is trying to associate the spirit of an animal with this project, and who best to counsel him on that matter than a No Moon Lunar?

Lexi accompanies Poe. She's still not entirely sure if it's all real or if she's gone insane. Still, in the face of dead men and demigods and shamans, she's resolved to remain indomitable... or at least, to appear to be so.

Roger is sampling the firewater in one of the expat bars. He seems to have developed a familial relationship with one of the half-breed Mexican girls who work the bar, and Morgan finds him chatting with her. She gets up and smiles brightly as the Solar and his fellow reporter enter. Roger waves Morgan and Lexi into chairs at his table.

After some brief explanations, the shaman nods slowly. "You do a wise thing by asking the blessing of the spirit. In my time as Lunar, I've learned more about the spirits of Gaia. My people taught things. Some of them are true, like a hearth fire to cook on. Some are not, like moonlight on the water - pretty, but unhelpful. And some are signposts that guide me to the truth."

"Raven is one such thing. As there are Exalted to rule over men, there are avatar spirits of the animals of nature. Raven's eyes are wherever Raven's children fly. Even on this world, there is something of him. But he will not act without your help. Here, he has no Essence. Here, we must be the conduit of his power."

"But this thing you want to build," Lexi asks, a little timidly. "It's a machine... well. Not even a machine. It's a program. What does it have to do with the Raven?"

"I don't know very much about computers or phones or this work," Roger admits. "But think on this. Where we sit now is a city called Tijuana. The country is Mexico. Men will fight and die for the right to call these things by their names, won't they. But.. aren't they just words? Ideas in the mind? They have no reality. But blood has been shed for them. Do you think there isn't similar power in the spirit world, or in the Lands of Light?"

"Or 'Russia' or 'America'. Yes. It could easily be that kind of thing," Lexi says cautiously.

"In a way, Lexi," adds Morgan, "I believe I'm hoping to _create_ the answer to your question. People have associated ravens with knowledge and wisdom. If Raven grants his blessing, then there will be a little bit of his wisdom, a little bit of his _nature_, in every copy of the program that bears his name."

Roger nods. "This is the nature of the spirit world. And to call forth Raven, you must offer something pleasing to him. You must align your Essence with his. A pleasing prayer is most suitable to your nature."

Morgan nods. "I believe you are right," he says. "First, though - tell me what you can of Raven. If I'm not mistaken, he will be appreciative of a prayer that evokes his nature."

Later that day, Morgan retires to a quiet room, pen and paper in hand, and with Lexi accompanying him. The legends of Raven that Wolf Pads told him echo in his mind, and he begins to commit those echoes to paper. As a native of Seattle, many of the legends were already familiar or half-familiar to him, as the Puget Sound natives revered Raven as the creator of the world and the discoverer and protector of men.

Lexi recounts some old Siberian tales on a similar theme, about Big Raven and his exploits. She also mentiones the norse god Odin, who had two ravens who were his spies and messengers. "Raven is a symbol for information, and also for deceit, but usually not malicious." she opines. "Not a bad match for the Internet."

Morgan nods. "There is a legend of the Haida people that Raven brought light to the world by stealing it from an old man who had kept it as a treasure. And light is itself a powerful symbol of knowledge." His pen scratches, as he adds more lines to the prayer.

There are so many legends of Raven that no one prayer could possibly encompass them all. Morgan abstracts them down, focusing on some central ideas: bringer of light, helper of men, clever and wise, albeit mischievous.

"Does it matter what language you use?" Lexi asks. "Do we need to learn ancient tlingit?"

Morgan nods. "It does matter," he says, as unfamiliar pictograms flow under his hand. They are completely incomprehensible to Lexi, for they are in the language of the Old Realm of Creation; and Morgan finds, as he writes, that the words naturally form a pleasing cadence. It is impossible to write a prayer in Old Realm without gaining the sense that it is the right and proper language of prayer.

Lexi tries to follow, and ends up shaking her head. That language does not come naturally to her. Instead, she opens her notebook and begins composing a story of her own, the story of this strange Yankee reporter who is protecting the world from evil.

When Morgan is satisfied, he re-reads the prayer over and over, committing it to memory. Then, he sets out into the desert. The sun is setting, and Morgan brings firewood. Although reciting the prayer will have power all by itself, there must be ceremony to go with it as well.

Morgan lights the campfire, and sets offerings of food around it; the raven is a natural scavenger, and Raven is hungry in many of the legends. The preparations are in place, and Morgan begins the prayer. As he recites the sonorous phrases in Old Realm, he begins to dance, his arms held high in evocation of the Raven's wings. And thus Lexi is treated to the rather peculiar sight of an educated Westerner, dancing around a campfire in a way that most Americans would see as primitive and superstitious. Primitive and superstitious, that is, to people who lack the knowledge that gods and spirits are real.

Lexi dutifully takes it all in, and quite seriously; after all, the nickname of this man is Poe, and he already does the Raven's work. For that matter, so does Lexi, by chronicling the ritual in sketches and verse.

Once, Morgan himself would have been embarrassed by such a display. Now it comes as naturally to him as breathing. It is not just a poem that he recites now, it is a song, singing the praises of the wise and mighty Raven. And on a whim, he turns to Lexi as she sits by the fire, and hands her a black feather. "Repeat after me!" he calls enthusiastically, and speaks a simple phrase in Old Realm: "Raven, clever trickster, creator and protector" is its meaning. Without waiting for her reply - indeed, his bearing suggests that he simply assumes that she will do as he asks - he belts out another lyric, waving a second feather high in the air.

There is no pause in the chant for an explanation, but if he had done so, it would be this: Lexi herself is a seeker of knowledge, as himself; and like the god Odin, she is missing an eye. As such, she is every bit as much a part of the Essence-pattern as the song, the dance, the fire, the feathers, the offerings, and all the other trappings of the ritual.

Lexi does as she is told and concentrates on the chant, realizing that there is apoint where the reporter is inseperable from the story.

If Lexi and Morgan were expecting a spirit to simply pop out of the Essence-dead mortal world of Gaia, they are soon disappointed. What comes out instead is Barry, who approaches the camp fire. In one hand is a check. He presents it to Morgan for inspection. "Part of your sacrifice," he explains. "A donation to the Audobon society."

"So I think that... " Barry stops. There's a distinct rumbling in the ground. "Sweet Christmas!" he yells out. A blossom of Essence erupts from the ground, streaking skyward and letting out a cawing noise. The fire is swept up in the rush, extinguishing it immediately.

Black and white tendrils of light reach forward and backward, mixing together. Esperanzita is there too, though Morgan can't recall just when she arrived. More that she'd always been standing there. "Good luck, big brother!" she yells at the pyrotechnic display.

The beak of the bird narrows itself to a spiraled radio antenna. The outstretched wings are the separated clamshell halves of an organic mobile phone. The body is black. Electricity arcs between the claws. Raven has come.

Lexi scuttles backwards from the sudden explosion of otherwordly might, cursing in six different languages. Finally she settles on English. "Holy Shit on a plate! How did we DO that?"

Raven's eyes dart about. "Now is not the time," the god says. "Defend your lands. Enemies come. I will fly high and see this world you have called me into. Speak my secret name when you are ready to see me again." And so he tells Morgan what it is. His wings spread, and Raven takes to the sky.

Morgan almost drops to his knees in shock and amazement, and then remembers his station. The Solars are not subservient to the avatars of the animal kingdom, he realizes, but nor are they their masters; rather, Solar and spirits of this order are peers, dealing as equals. He does, however, bow deeply and drop to one knee briefly, in reflection of his relative youth as an Exalt. "This I will do, o Raven," he replies in Old Realm.

As the apparition vanishes into the air, Morgan turns to his fellows. "Come on!" he says. As he turns back to town, he realizes that many of his companions do not know Old Realm, and explains: "Tijuana's about to be attacked!"

Barry, Lexi and Morgan find the Man sitting in lotus inside the fusion power plant - the logical destination, since the more subtle attacks of previous weeks have all been directed there. He opens his eyes as the group approaches, and throws Morgan a pistol. "If I have to get up," he says, "you've failed. Now get out there. They're serious this time. Get the golems."

Morgan tucks the pistol into his waistband, and ducks into the storeroom, returning with one of the Benford Special shotguns and clambering into a vest. "Lexi, it's going to be dangerous. Be careful." He heads out in search of the Ivanovas.

"Hey! I'm not helpless," Lexi squawks. "You've got all these expensive toys, get me a damn camera and let me do my job!"

He doesn't have to look long. The twins are surrounded by a buzz of activity. By the time Morgan arrives, people are scattering around them, and men with every manner of weapon stand waiting. "Remember, tell them not to flee, stay in the houses in the sections we've indicated," says Elizabeth. "Now move it. We have to go play rough. They've come expecting to dine easy. We're going to crush them."

Advancing on the fusion power plant are probably six dozen Latinos of various national and cultural origins. Walkie-talkie reports put the count at 75, officially. All are armed. All of them look nasty. Most are tattooed. They're still several blocks away.

Machetes, shotguns, Uzis, grenades, chainsaws, hatchets, buzzsaws. One supposedly is packing an Army issue flamethrower. Many have Molotov cocktails. The police, although decent sorts, have decided that if the gang is here for the _gringos_' power plant and nothing else, they can have it.

Natasha turns to speak with a man, asking calmly, "You have what I asked for?" The man nods and she puts on a shit-eating grin, taking the man aside and leading him to a motorcycle. "Just so long as it works," she assures him quietly.

Elizabeth is the first to greet Morgan, "Welcome to the party. Ah, good, you brought a gun. Those are always handy. We've got something of a large angry mob thrown against us. Should be interesting." She nods towards her twin, "She has something special prepared, but it's kinda stupid so we'll need to support it well for it to work." 'Hey!'

Morgan turns to the militia, who are already headed for their pre-designated cover. "Be ready for orders!" he calls. "You, you, and you -" he says, pointing at the best marksmen in the lot - "hit the targets I call out. The rest of you are suppressive fire - make 'em find cover, but keep your heads down if you have to. All right - let's move out!"

Jet has a good eye for character, so many of the locals that she hired are willing to hang tough and defend the power plant. Many even know their way around a gun, so they take what small arms can be found and set up improvised gunnery nests on top of empty freight containers. The absence of police has its advantages: the government won't be busting any of the local toughs over this incident.

It doesn't take long at all for Morgan to realize something important. There are no leaders among the oncoming attackers. As they open fire, he sees a lack of coordination and a basic mob mentality unguided by a complex tactical decision-making process. They're here to do just one thing. But their leaders aren't here. If so, where? Elsewhere. Where do the leaders go? Where it's important that they be. This is a diversion.

Elizabeth smiles at Morgan, "Thanks. Not the best at that." Natasha walks a bike towards Morgan and warns, "Careful, the rig up is pretty much by the seat of the locals pants, but I think the timer will work. Been a while, ya know." She blows out a breath, pushing her bangs from her face for a moment, "Explosives are more expensive than I remember."

Morgan glares at the crowd of foes. "No tactics," he says. "That's not right. If there's one thing the Assembled excel at, it's coordinating." He turns back toward the fusion plant. "Where are they?" he demands, sounding both annoyed and worried. Perhaps the true enemies aren't even coming physically at all?

Lexi returns with an expensive armor vest and a less expensive camera. "What about your schoolgirl goddess? Is she immune to bullets?"

"Alrighty, so these aren't the big ones, but a pain, right?" Natasha clenches a fist. "They're mine. Get the others." She hops on the bike, throttles it up and offers a mock salute, "Good luck, chief. Don't get killed or Jet will be so totally pissed off at you." With that, she rockets off, not towards the enemy, but around a building.

Morgan boggles at Lexi. "Shit! She was with us when we left-" he says, whirling to Elizabeth. "Take over here!" he yells, and then runs to where he last remembers seeing Esperanzita. As he runs, he realizes the danger - the reason the Assembled can't manifest in Tijuana is because there is a spirit here. If Esperanzita is killed, as terrible a tragedy as that would be, it would be nothing compared to the mechanical onslaught that would ensue.

"You can't do it alone, you damn fool," says Elizabeth sternly. She races after him. "Can't you call her here? She's a goddess," she asks.

Lexi takes a quick glance at the developing firefight, and then takes off after Poe at a run. "Macho idiots," she mutters.

"Fine, we'll let your sister handle the faceless mooks," Morgan says, agreeing that if there's a _serious_ attack on the goddess, he alone may not have the firepower to stop it. "I don't think so!" he responds to her question. "She's bound to a physical form here in Gaia - there's not enough Essence for her to dematerialize! Besides, she doesn't know any magic, except for those cookies!"

Behind the others Natasha has reached the top of the buildings near the plant and is rocketing from one to the next on the bike, gathering more and more speed. In her right hand she twirls a steel rod, the other braces her as she moves closer and closer to her target.

One of the buildings is higher, and it is towards this imposing wall that she races. The bike's engine screams in protest, but with the raging firefight going on, no one can hear it. With a smirk Nathas leaps up on the bike, stabbing the steel bar in to the spokes of the front wheel and feeling the whole machine whip around like a giant mousetrap. She grips it between her legs like a vice and throws out her arms, catching the stone wall and nearly shattering it. The flip continues and she releases the bike just as she turns completely upside down, hurling it skyward with all her strength.

The bike crashes right in the midst of the enemy, blasting out in a fierce explosion. The center of the mass if utterly flattened, and all are knocked from their feet. With this opening, even the worst aims aren't so bad, and the locals let loose, blasting at their enemies mercilessly. Natasha isn't done, either. She leaps from the building, swinging her right fist like a jackhammer into a car's door and tearing it free. Her other grabs hold of a sign post and tears it from the concrete. With her shield and weapon ready she steps into her disorganized foes, shattering limbs and skulls with every brutal swing.

Meanwhile, pelting down the streets of Tijuana... "She must've gone home when the trouble started," says Morgan, turning a corner. He remembers, from talking with her and with the local experts on gods, that Esperanzita does have one form of magic that she knows: the ability to return, instantly, to her home. Which is Santiago's house - and Morgan's destination, Elizabeth and Lexi by his side.

Lexi fishes one of Marlene's raven prototypes from her pocket, thumbing the power button, followed by the key for 'Voice Journal'. The phone powers up with a muted squawk. "Let all good citizens know that the power plant is a feint. Tijuana's young mother is at home and probably in trouble." She hits 'Send', panting and slowing. "Damn, man. It's ten blocks! Hotwire a car or something!"

Morgan is the first to Santiago's house. He finds two bodies. One of them is Santiago himself. Still alive, but unconscious and bleeding from gunshot wounds. The other is alive, but not for long. Barry shielded the man from attack. Spent cartridges scattered around the house show the extent of the fighting. Now the Chosen of Endings looks like he's on his own way out. He gestures weakly at Morgan as he sees the Solar, managing to move a single finger and smiling.

Barry was there when the Raven was called. Morgan thinks back. When did he leave? When did this happen? He must have foreseen it.

Morgan kneels beside Barry. "You did well. Thank you," he says, gently but loud enough for a dying man to hear. "Where is Esperanzita?"

"Gave her my Essence. Dematerialized now," Barry whispers, grinning. His lips are bloodstained, but his eyes are bright. "Saved Santiago. Listen. This is my plan. Mary needs me gone to grow into herself. Okay? This.. had to happen. I'll be back.. promise."

Elizabeth is no stranger to death. She sighs sadly, looking over Santiago and then to Barry. She wonders vaguely if The Man knew this would happen. She wonders if he could have stopped it. If so, should he have?

Lexi needs a moment to understand what is going on, then gives up. If Santiago will live, it won't be without help. In a moment she's at the wounded man's side, doing her best to see to his wounds. "You two killers, go kill." She pulls out the Raven phone again and thumbs 'Ambulance'.

Morgan knows better than to argue with a Sidereal about fate. "Good luck," he says to Barry. "We'll be looking for you when you return." He stands, and nods to Lexi. "Come back to the plant as soon as you can. I'm sure there'll still be plenty of story for you." He grins at Elizabeth. "Come on - can't let your sister have all the fun."

Elizabeth sighs softly, "The fun." Her expression is grim. "Let's get this task done before any other good people die."

Morgan nods. "Agreed - but we need to keep one of them alive too, if we can," he says, breaking into a run. "We need equipment that only the Assembled have, and these guys can lead us back to them." There's no guarantee that their foes can be forced or tricked into revealing anything - but if anyone can do it, Morgan can.
