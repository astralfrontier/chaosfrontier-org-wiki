# Fall of Eden 2008-05-30

Poe is nearly buried while still alive - with work. The reporter has been assembling information, working on his proposed plan, and trying to calm the chaos of a brutal attack on Tijuana. In America, a wholesale assault on a major city would have easily made the national news. Here, it's almost as though people expected it.

There is one more duty to discharge, of course. Morgan, the Man, the Ivanova sisters, and a few other people in the 'inner circle' of Exalted affairs gather in an incongruously sunny churchyard while a body is carefully lowered into the waiting earth. Mary is absent. The Man is taciturn. And the subject of the burial, once a guiding figure to the other Celestials of America, takes his remaining secrets with him into the darkness beneath the dust.

He is not the only one to receive burial. Many of the members of MS-13 suffered fatal injuries. Many died outright. A few failed to hold out before medical assistance arrived. The wounded flummoxed the doctors who examined them, and in all cases heavy sedatives were mixed into whatever drugs they received. A man who can rip steel restraints open without aid is not to be taken lightly.

The Dragon-Blooded who fought with the group is named Esteban. He's a visitor from Ecuador, watches too much television - and is wholly on board with the Exalted. Now he follows Morgan around like an overeager puppy dog, wanting to know what he can do next.

Before he brings his news to the world, Morgan has one urgent task: locate Alchemical technology so he can modify the Chair to repair Jaguar Hombre. The remnants of the MS-13 attack are his only existing link to such parts.

After ensuring that the survivors are isolated from one another, Morgan begins to interview them, one at a time, patiently and in exhaustive detail. He knows that he is dealing with people who have every reason not to tell him anything useful, and so even before he can ask what he wants to know, he must discover what reasons they _do_ have to talk.

Beyond that, though, Morgan is aware that the members of MS-13 still have their neurocytes, which threaten to provide a bulwark, a refuge against Morgan's interrogation. As far as Benford knew, there was no way to extricate the neurocytes from a patient, and such a procedure would probably be excruciating anyway, and so Morgan has to deal with them as they stand. His ally in this is the spirit of Raven, who has already demonstrated an ability to cut off the Assembled signal.

And so Morgan proceeds, from one prisoner to the next, doing as much listening as talking. After all, Jet herself was once a member of a gang like this, and they are still people, with their individual hopes and fears - which provide Morgan the rapport he needs to find out where they got their implants from, and maybe even who sent them.

The reporter's clues come from many sources: regional accent, new clothes only available at certain shops, traces of bank activity. Most of his information is gleaned after the interviews, during careful consideration. But the important things came from the men and women themselves. He has a destination to follow up on - Mexico City - but little more. He is quite certain of one thing, though. These people all came from different parts of two continents, but they all passed through that massive metropolis recently.

Morgan is working his way out of the latest such interrogation and back to his residence when he feels a surge of Essence pour through him. He steps forward and twists his head, doing so without thought or awareness. He hears the high-pitched whine of a bullet go by him. He has just been missed by a near margin.

His magic need give him no further hints. Morgan is instantly in the lee of a doorway, peeking his head out only briefly in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the gunman's position.

Four more shots ring out. Morgan's eyes are sharp enough to catch the impact points. The unknown shooter is apparently a sniper - the delay is long enough that it must be a rifle, rather than a revolver or automatic pistol. And the trajectory is subtly down, even when striking the brightly-painted signs of shops and businesses on the street.

The Exalt watches the sniper's bullets impact four signs, from left to right down the street. One letter after another receives a mark. B. C. N. U.

"Show-off," Morgan mutters under his breath.

---

No trace is found of the sniper, although his position is plotted with some precision by the Tijuana irregulars. Morgan meets with Santiago and Esperanzita at the lawyer's house by invitation, and finds the Man waiting for him at the door. Once inside, he also finds four women waiting for him: Saint Death, Lexi, Elizabeth and Natasha.

While the little goddess distributes cookies to everyone, Santiago speaks. "That man.. I owe him my life. I will not waste it on foolishness. And he saved the child too, though it was surely a miracle from God." He smiles at Esperanzita, who has apparently upgraded her divine powers and now shows them off by serving lemonade from the kitchen as well. "So it puzzles me that his associate, Maria, has disappeared. I hope nothing has happened to her as well."

Morgan shakes his head. "I remember he said that it needed to happen for Maria to come out of his shadow. Perhaps that's what she's doing now."

Lexi frowns. "Is there any chance that something happened, during the fight? Our friends don't always come when they are called."

"I wouldn't worry about it," the Man mumbles. "She's grieving right now. Probably threw on some anonymous Destiny and is cruising around in it right now. She'll be back to being Mary after awhile. But this also screws up my Africa timetable. Fuckin' Barry."

Santiago gives the Man a withering look, and he scowls back, eyeing Esperanzita. "What? She'll have heard worse around this city."

Lexi spends a moment gawking at The Man, but (literally) bites her tongue. Not hers to argue.

The twins are oddly quiet, thinking things through carefully. "What is, is," murmurs Elizabeth quietly. "Barry's death will cause a rift of sorts, and now our danger will grow with every step. We know they aren't afraid of us, and with this tactic failing they can only escalate their approach."

"Such as being sniped at as we walk down the street," Morgan says. When the others look at him strangely, he explains about the attempt on his life, complete with a message spelled out in holed street signs. "But I honestly don't see it stopping, unless we go into hiding or win the war. Machines don't panic."

"And apparently they've found a way to circumvent the barrier on Assembled entry," the Man points out. "For that matter, they may just try to put something into orbit and drop it on us."

"You people are nuts," Lexi mutters. "And so am I, to do your bidding, when you are at war. But here we are, so let's get on with it."

Morgan tilts his head. "Does it have to be an Assembled? I haven't had a chance to examine the scene, but couldn't they have just suborned a trained gunman for a change?"

"A machine would shoot better," shrugs the Man. "But it doesn't matter, does it. They can still shoot us dead from a distance."

"Rather unlikely, considering who it is. Coincidences like that are a bit much." Natasha corrects her sister, "Coincidences are relationships that the mind is not wise enough to discern. What I wonder though is why they aren't just raining down missiles on us. They certainly have the money."

"He sounds more like one of you," Lexi mentions. "The Borg wouldn't be flippant."

"True," Morgan says. "But this may not have been flippant. It may have been simple economy of expression. This may not have been an all-out attack - just a message. 'Be seeing' you'."

"As I understand it they mean to wipe you from the face of the earth," says Natasha. "They are brutally efficient and direct. If they are delaying, they have a reason to do so, and it isn't likely to be a message," adds Elizabeth.

Lexi says, "Then you need to take advantage of the delay and find out what they are up to. Maybe stop it before it shows up on our doorstep again?"

"Each Assembled has a different purpose, and not all of them are bent on our destruction," Morgan points out. "Axel's purpose had nothing to do with any of us directly until one of his allies pointed me out as a threat - and I was a mortal at the time anyway. Gerhardt's purpose was solely to study me. Still, _some_ of them definitely have the purpose of shutting us down. And the group that attacked us, as far as I can tell, was organized somewhere in Mexico City."

A pregnant silence intervenes. Lexi asks, "So... when do we leave?"

Morgan glances at the Man. "At the auspicious time. But as soon as possible. After all, I've received an engraved invitation."

The Man nods. "Now isn't the time. Soon it will be. For now, get your ass ready. We need to take a trip to Africa."

Morgan scratches his head. "So did Barry screw up the timetable by making you move it up?" He shakes his head. "Never mind. I've no doubt we have something important to do in Africa, but I'd also been planning on taking the war into the public domain. What order should we do those in, do you think?"

"Africa first," the Man says. "We need to settle this shit post-haste. You and me. Then we come back and you do your thing. By then Mary will be back in shape, and hopefully we'll have a new Chosen of Endings to manage your transition plan."

"Then let's get over to Africa without delay," says Morgan. He thinks. "I suppose this means poor Jaguar will have to wait as well. Who'll be looking after him?"

"I will," offers Saint Death.

The Man nods. "You can investigate Mexico City, but you aren't going to get what you need from it without help. That means serious help, not just this lot."

Lexi says, "I should stay here also. I'm not the one to keep watch on Jaguar but I can pave the way for the truth."

The Man withdraws a business card and presents it to Lexi. The script is bold and neat. It reads simply: Lexington Dallas, Prophet.

"Do you need muscle there, or here?" asks Natasha. "This place is rather vulnerable, I think. Who knows when Jet will return?" Or if, though the twins will not voice the question.

"Africa will be fine. I need persuasion there." The Man nods at Morgan. "He'll do fine."

---

Lagos is a city of 8 million people and growing. It is a metropolis built atop three islands and surrounded by lagoons. It is served by Murtala Mohammed International Airport, and Morgan's first impression upon debarking from the airplane is a city much like his home of Seattle.

That impression disappears quickly when the Man charters a taxi. The traffic is a nightmare. Not an American "rush hour", but a real, honest to goodness gridlock. Morgan feels danger, but also tension, excitement, energy, and even happiness radiating from the city. It is alive in a way that few American cities are. Tijuana shares some of the same quality - a place less removed from the spectacles of life, more rooted in real time.

"We're going to Algiers," the Man explains, as their rented automobile merges onto the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Around the expressway, Morgan sees the economic boom of the city mingled with the crushing poverty of the continent, but he sees something else. People, people everywhere, from a culture unlike his own. Alien to him, just as he is alien to them - a strange white face in the window of a passing metal monster.

"They say that human civilization emeged in the Fertile Crescent," the Man is saying as he drives. The car leaves Lagos behind. Ahead is only Nigeria. "It didn't. Most of the really interesting early cultures came out of a wide belt stretching from Morocco to India. There was a fairly rapid evolutionary adaption that just happened, sort of like the hundred monkey effect. It was the people in the Fertile Crescent that survived what happened next."

"Africans have long memories. The continent used to be even more beautiful than it was. The Sahara wasn't a dessert. And there was about 5 miles more coastline in some places." The Sidereal shrugs a bit. "They lost the international cultural race, though. Not enough resources to hold off what was coming. Now they're starting to catch up - now that the international colonizing powers have killed each other's empires. That's how Gaia works, you know. You might think Autochthon is an evil bastard for coming over here. But in this world, natural selection is the law. Justice is a human invention, frequently overridden by circumstance and chance."

"And the idea of what justice _is_ changes from one generation to the next even within a culture, to say nothing of others," Morgan agrees contemplatively.

"Yeah. Which I think is our problem here." The Man points across the landscape with one hand; the other stays on the wheel. "See all that? The blood in that soil goes down deep. Some of it caused by Africans, some by Europeans, some by others. But the species keeps on evolving, and I guess that's what Gaia wants. People still live in pain and fear, but hey, at least they ain't gettin' their souls ripped out of them."

---

Algiers is unlike Lagos in its construction. It bustles with people, perhaps half that of the Nigerian city's population. But its nickname, "Alger la Blanche" - Algiers the White - is proved true by the otherworldly beauty of its skyline of buildings.

The Man leads Morgan to a mosque, at which he communicates in Arabic to an aged, smiling gentleman in desert robes and a turban. This man withdraws a cell phone from his robes and makes a quick call, speaking rapidly to his party while the Sidereal taps his foot.

"These guys are supposed to be somewhere in the Maghrib," the Man explains while he waits. "That's the best information we have. Ed here has been following up for the Shadow Synod. I think..." He pauses as 'Ed' finishes his phone call. The turbaned head bobs obsequiously and the man gestures at the mosque entrance.

"Wait here," the Man says. He starts moving inside.

A few minutes pass. Morgan becomes aware of the crowd beginning to flow around him, into and out of the mosque. As it does, he feels a sharp pressure on his shoulder, and an equally sharp edge at his back. "You will come with me, Solar," a husky voice whispers in his ear. The scent of Cuban cigarettes swirls around Morgan's nose. "We wish to talk."

"You could have just asked," Morgan hisses, as he allows his muscles to untense. "I like to talk." It is clear to him that he hasn't developed his powers enough yet. Did the Man anticipate this? No, better not to try to anticipate the oracle. Take the situation as it comes.

"You may not be who we expect. We are cautious." The voice and the hand on his shoulder guide Morgan to a nearby alley, and he is turned around to face a swarthy, bearded man wearing horn-rimmed glasses. The Cuban cigar smell is still on him, though he isn't smoking. His hair is black and slicked back. His eyes are violet pools of starry wisdom. "Show it to me," he says, glancing at Morgan's forehead.

Starry eyes. He is amongst his fellow Celestials - but this does not mean they are his friends. Nevertheless, they need to be sure what _he_ is. Morgan allows the golden circle-in-circle to glimmer on his forehead.

The man nods, satisfied. "I am called Salah," he explains. "There are two of us. I oversee the North. My comrade oversees the South. Now we must ask you a question. And you must answer truthfully, or this knife will open your belly - _Why did you send the metal men here?_"

Morgan grimaces - more out of annoyance at the misunderstanding rather than fear, for he has no doubt that Salah will be able to read his sincerity. "The Assembled," he says angrily. "We did not send them - they sent themselves. And they attack us too."

"Then why do they act with the aid of a man whose brow bears a mark similar to yours?" Salah asks angrily. "Why do they sell guns to the warlords? Why do they subvert the armies and the governments? Which of you is working with them?"

"A Solar is working with them?" Morgan says, astonished. "Believe me, Salah, if we could get our hands on this man, we'd love to ask those very questions of him ourselves." He shakes his head. "Come to think of it, I'm more surprised that _they_ would work with _him_. As for why... I can't say without knowing more. The Assembled act with a Unity of Purpose, but each of their leaders has a purpose of its own."

The Sidereal relaxes somewhat. "The Solar tendency to conquest. We have known of this since the Father came with his teachings. We believe this is your conquest of Africa. That is why we mistrust even the Father, since he allied himself with you. There are older blood ties in the world than those of the gods, Solar. If you deceive me, we will have an accounting."

"This Solar of yours conquers for his own reasons." Morgan smiles slightly. "I suppose, in our way, we Solars also move with our own purposes. And I do not seek to conquer the world. I seek to _unite_ it, it is true, for we must stand together against the metal men - but there is no reason why Westerners need to be on top. The heritage and powers of our patrons are the same, no matter where we come from."

Salah backs off. The knife disappears. "We will see. There is a doctor in South Africa. One of your kind. Twilight Caste. Go speak to him - we will provide the address to your contact in due course. He distrusts us, but we need his aid."

Morgan says, "What would you have me ask of him?"

"If he becomes willing to work with us, then we will be willing to work with you," Salah says, grinning. "It is that simple. If you have betrayed us, of course.."

"I will not betray you. I will go to this doctor and convince him to work with you, and when I have done so, you will work with us." On an impulse, Morgan steps forward, holding out his hand, and his Caste Mark begins to glitter again. "Do you agree?"

Salah takes Morgan's hand in his. As he does so, Morgan's Caste Mark briefly illuminates the alleyway, casting shadows of Old Realm characters on the walls, and both men feel the surge of Essence as Morgan calls upon the ancient oaths given to his caste. "And may the gods strike us down if we fail," he says, as the glow dies away.
