Diana Valdez, also called Saint Death, has been an ominous figure in Tijuana since she arrived. Though venerated by the Mexicans, she has always kept her distance and stayed aloof, even with her fellow Celestials.

The grim specter of mortality, once such an iconic figure for the drug-ridden Mexican state of Baja, now seems anathema in the wake of the Celestials' advent in Tijuana. And as the mortal associates of the Exalted discover, someone new has come to the city. It is as though Tijuana itself mustered a living antibody to neutralize the morbid Abyssal.

This counter comes in the form of a woman dressed in simple black and white colors. She is not Mexican, but African-American in appearance, and her hair hangs thick and long behind her. Her eyes are full of laughter and starry wisdom.

She is seen by the Tijuana militia in the company of giggling children, telling them stories and encouraging them to sing songs with her. There is something about her that the militia has come to recognize as magical, and so they try to escalate to the most senior remaining members of the Exalted in town. This is Diana herself, who doesn't seem to relish the prospect of interacting with such a person.

Nevertheless, the former journalist at least brings along some protection in the form of Natasha and Elizabeth, should this stranger prove hostile. And Lexi, who has been told in no uncertain terms that she can be a target and should stay near the sisters, is invited along as well.

With trepidation, Saint Death leads this motley crew to the last place that this strange woman was known to be. And they find her, sitting in the shade of an old oak tree, taking siesta with a cup of ice tea. The strange woman rises and smiles at each of her guests in turn. "It's good to see you all again," she says warmly.

Lexi stares at the woman. She wouldn't be out of place in Berkeley, but how could they all know this woman? "Your pardon, ma'am, but when have we met?"

"I am Harmony. I've lived before, and I know all of you." The woman beams brightly, looking from face to face. "Thank you for coming to see me."

People who claim to know the twins could be many, but to know all of them is a rather absurd notion. Natasha and Elizabeth will stand on their guard, though they don't exactly feel threatened by the woman. "How did you know us?" asks Elizabeth.

Harmony shakes her head. "I can't say. It's a mystery. But I've come with something important for each of you to know."

Lexi nods; it all sounds par for the life of Andrew Morgan. The underground journalist keeps her mouth shut and her one eye open.

Harmony draws close. She whispers something in Diana's ear. The woman gasps and backs away as though struck.

Next, the visitor approaches Lexi. Leaning close, she whispers these words: "Go to Africa and find Morgan. Either you will regain your vision, or you will gain a second sight and see Truth. The choice will be yours."

Lexi's reaction is much like Diana's; whatever she expected to hear, that wasn't it. "I see," she says, without irony.

The last message is reserved for both of the twins. Harmony leans close, sliding her arms around their shoulders in a sisterly gesture. "The Man is wrong," she whispers. "You are alive, and God loves you. Go to Africa. Morgan needs you. There is a man who has no hope in his heart. You will give it to him."

Natasha and Elizabeth look to each other for a moment. Though no words are exchanged, it seems an agreement is made. "We will go, but who will protect this place while we are away?"

"It will be safe," says Harmony. "Mary will return and defend it. She will be enough."

"Then we will go, and I think others will return soon to help Mary," says Natasha.

Lexi shakes her head. "They just left last weekend. Now he's already in trouble, and needs the women to bail him out. Typical. I'm in, then."

Harmony laughs lightly. It has no trace of mockery, only amusement. "He is not at all in trouble, my friend. But the man with whom he is dealing... _he_ is very much in trouble."

"Trouble seems to follow us wherever we go these days," says Natasha. "Is it okay to blame it all on men and leave it at that?" Elizabeth snickers, "With us it has always been men."

"Charity has already brought some comfort to Snake," Harmony says, looking at both of the twins. "He's found his peace. I am to help you find yours."

"Why on earth would she do that?" asks Elizabeth. "Considering things, I rather figured she'd prefer to put him through nine levels of hell or more."

"Because she's learned an important lesson. You can't put someone through Hell without joining them there." Harmony smiles gently.

"The woman called Jet has had her eyes opened to the possibility of joy. She doesn't need me now, but others still do."

Lexi can't resist looking at Diana. "Maybe we damn people too casually. If Charity thinks that he deserves some peace, I'm not going to argue with her."

"She has changed," agrees Natasha. "She's grown up a lot. Not quite as wild. Well, not like she used to be anyway."

The Tijuana Exalts don't have any official status. Even so, with the power plant, the militia, and cross-border diplomacy, the fledling Deliberative has some pull with the Mexican authorities. The Ministry of State provides an expedited and surreptitious itinerary for the twins and their allies. Fedex complains less about cyborg passengers than United.

The flight is slated to leave at sunrise on the following morning; so whatever they're heading into, Morgan won't have to wait long for backup.
