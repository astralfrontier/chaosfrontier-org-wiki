The revelations of the Supervisor took their toll on Benford. Once he could believe that the Solars were the thin line between the rational world and the invaders. Now the truth comes out: the Solars threaten the fabric of reality just be existing in Gaia.

As the Cosmologist in residence of the new Deliberative, Benford saw it as his duty to plot away around disaster. He saw none. Critical data was missing and the answers were all in the hands of the enemy. That left only one choice.

Greyhound provided expedient and unglamorous transport out of Tijuana. The dusty, downscale mode of transport fit Benford's mood as he approached the one place he could be sure of sanctuary among the enemy: the state penetentiary at Walla Walla. A Department of corrections van met him at the bus terminal There was no fanfare as Netwon Benford, PhD, OBE, slipped the entanglements of mortal civilization.

ISOLATION IS THE FOUNDATION OF IDENTITY. These are the resounding words which greet Newton Benford as he "awakens" - or rather acquires consciousness. He finds himself in a peculiarly disembodied state, possessed of a sharp and at times disturbing clarity despite a lack of any discernible senses. For all that he knows, he is a ghost.

He finds himself in a place where light is omnipresent. The visible hues of the spectrum are each perfectly represented. Around him he sees grids of light, along which sparkling wisps of blue energy dart this way and that. They form cosmic capillaries which merge into the greater arteries of traffic above and below him. It can be no less than a brain of electromagnetism, with each sparkle the action of synapses firing.

For a time, Benford struggles to recognize the sensations which surround him. He feels that, quite recently, he ceased to be - or perhaps that he was divided into his component selves. He finds memories which respond only when stimulated by other memories, other thoughts, specific moods, and similar triggers. And yet the undeniable truth of himself remains: he is a Solar Exalted. That has not changed. And given that truth, he can feel the Essence that permeates this place.

He occupies a mind. It is a mind beyond all human conception, filled with other, lesser minds. He knows the word for some of these by name: _fetiches_, the lesser souls of a Primordial. Other of these minds occupy a lesser place. And many of the greatest minds are comprised of still others.

Benford tries to recall the mad fire in his mind that made this seem like a good idea. Ultimately, the one part he could not bear, was the inevitable truth that the rational, impersonal, scientific world would end; but then, that world was just an illusion anyway, as the laws of Newton were an illusion arising from an inadequate understanding of the laws of Einstein... and all of that, coming from an inadequate understanding of the laws of this being. "Autochton," he mutters, with neither breath nor emotion.

"Present appearances to the contrary, neither of us is in the habit of going quietly," he begins. "You must have known that. The change that I once feared is now inevitable. You are going to get Your answer... one way or the other." He realizes that the Primordial could say the same thing to Benford, and it would be just as true.

THERE IS NO SELF WITHOUT IGNORANCE, the voice says.

"Then I am relieved that I may remain myself," Benford quips, "for there is so much that I do not know." He tries to get a sense of the other component minds nearby, the things called 'fetich'. The things are organized into a hierarchy, and somewhere there must be a branch that leads to Axel, and another that leads to Gearhard, and others that lead - or led - to Engel and Mister Bland. Benford's Solar heritage reminds him that humans fought these things in the First Age. Damaging or killing one is more than just wounding a monster; it's surgery on the laws of reality. He shudders, or remembers what a shudder was like. _I'm looking at the machine code of the Universe!_

YOU ARE LOOKING AT ONE-TWENTY-FIFTH OF ALL POTENTIAL EXISTENCE.

"One out of five squared?" He's not surprised that the mind around him knows his thoughts. "Is that significant?"

YES.

Benford asks, "And how many twenty-fifths do You see?"

I SEE MYSELF IN ALL THAT EXISTS.

Benford says, "Down to business, then. I request that I be enlightened on the workings of the essence contraction that is causing the current crisis."

Benford finds himself abruptly translated. Not teleported, moved, or displaced. Things have simply changed for him.

He floats in a spherical shell painted a brilliant white. At the center of this enormous space is another sphere, also white. And floating equidistant from each other are three figures. One is a young boy, one an adult male, and one an old and white-bearded man.

The adult speaks; the other two listen. "Everything that exists is composed of Essence. Physical objects, intangible concepts, and Platonic forms. A thing without Essence is a conceptual impossibility. To even think of a thing, or imagine it, it must have Essence."

"Essence is measured by its intensity and its other qualities. The Old Realm words for the five qualities are ji, ro, qua, fu, and ke. Taken together, most people prefer to say that Essence has a flavor, a texture, or a feeling of its own."

"Reality begins with qualia - constructs of Essence having distinct qualities. Qualia devolve into other qualia. For example, a sword is that which is long, that which is sharp, that which is a weapon, that which is forged of iron, and so on. Each of these, in turn, are composed of other qualia. Eventually you will reach qualia which are described by precise values of ji, ro, qua, fu and ke."

"Essence emerges from what is called 'will'. Will is defined as that which generates Essence but is not itself subject to it. By analogy, imagine a flashlight which cannot be seen because it does not reflect light, only emits it. Will is axiomatic. It may be described but not defined by Essence theory."

"Essence emerges from the will and emanates into its environment. Lacking a framework in which to operate, Essence flows entirely without constraint. It will freely intermingle with other sources of Essence, like overlapping waves. Whatever is willed becomes manifest. The Solars refer to this state as 'the Deep Wyld'. In such a condition there is no space and no time, because such things are themselves constructs of Essence. There is change, but not causality."

Benford says, "That makes sense. Causality is critical to an anthropic existence."

The man nods, and continues. "Gaia's Core, like the Loom of Fate, acts as such a framework. The Core itself is constructed of Essence, of course. Wills are embedded in its framework. The Essence they emanate is channeled into circuits. This flow of Essence through well-established channels is referred to as Fate, or Destiny. The Essence is mediated and mingled together with other such flows. The end result is physical reality."

"A human will radiates intent; the Core channels this through their Fate, trying to make that intent manifest. If there is sufficient Essence to do so, the thing becomes real. Because of the structure of the Core, that metaphysical activity is reflected, like a shadow on a cave wall, in the world you all experience. Metaphysical intent becomes the firing of synapses, then the motion of muscles, and the exertion of the body and mind."

"The Core's role is to provide a sensible, linear ordering of intent. It conducts Essence through the web of Fate. It diverts away all Essence not strictly necessary to realize the action - thus maintaining the magic-free state of Gaia. And that channeled Essence, in turn, shifts the conduits of Fate into new directions. One's present actions affect one's future destiny."

"A simple example from Creation. Two people are predestined to meet. Each radiates Essence which harmonizes with the other. Within the Loom of Fate, the pattern spiders become aware of this harmony and reweave the conduits of Fate. The Essence flows are allowed to make a direct circuit with each other, pulling nearby pathways along as well. Circumstances conspire to bring the two together. Of course the Core is designed to make that sort of diversion difficult to accomplish."

Benford says, "Someone once asked me about the nature of free will, and I compared it to gravity wells. You could move within your own well without escaping a deeper one. Is that at all accurate?"

"That cannot be known," the child answers, smiling. "But if it's what you believe about yourself, then it's true, isn't it."

"I suppose," Benford says cautiously. "We were told that the artifacts of the Core are memes. The more strongly that something is believed, the more real it is." Benford shakes his head. "But does that break Science? We thought that the rule book was static, and we sought the reading glasses. Now we're told that Man holds stylus and eraser... and you're confirming that."

The adult nods. "And it would be that way if not for the Core. The Core's function is to manage excess Essence, to render 'science' absolute. Or rather to permit evolution to proceed unhindered by will, as Gaia intended."

"Then along come the Solars and overload the system, and now science is off the chain," Benford says flatly, "and presumably evolution as well. But that's only what we know so far."

"It must be stopped," the adult replies gravely. "And you are causing it."

Benford rubs his temple, glad to have a body again, or something like it. "And somehow I'm not inclined to apologize. We break it, we bought it, we own it, we fix it. Story of a Solar's life." He pauses, having missed something. "I'm being rude. My name is Benford. How am I to address you?"

"You are not," says the child, smiling impishly. "Here is only a place for truth and education. If the self is ignorance, how could we admit identity into this place?"

"But humans - mortals, anyway - are accustomed to learning things from other mortals. Is it not the nature of memes that they pass from self to self?" Benford smirks. "Or is this another case of mortal existence being a weak imitation of the truth? And the three of you are here as an emulation between that truth and my mortal expectation?"

"That is so," says the old man.

"I don't think we can go back to what we had," Benford says. "But I want to find another answer." A thought occurs to him. "Back to what you said a moment ago. Causation is the first, most important dividing line between the Deep Wyld and... well, everything we've ever heard of, right? Heaven, Hell, Earth, Creation, the Primordials, the Gods... all of it."

"That is so," the man says.

"And all of that," Benford continues, "came about when the Primordials came together. In other words, the Primordials and causation go together. Why is that?"

"We don't know," the old man says, smiling sadly. "Why did the Primordials unite and cause Creation at all? Perhaps that, too, was willed."

Benford raises an eyebrow. "But who - what - could will that?"

"Would you like an improbable theory?" the old man asks. "There are only a handful of actors in the cosmos. The Primordials. Their creations, the Gods. The other denizens of the cosmos. And... humanity. Rule out any of these based on the available evidence and consider the remainder."

Benford is silent for a long moment. "You imply that it might be humanity. But how can that be, if we came so much later? Would that break causation?" Benford shakes his head again. "But we want causation so badly... that if it didn't exist, we'd be forced to create it. Shades of Voltaire."

"That is the nature of all that exists," the old man replies. "Things will themselves into being. Things cease to be when their time passes."

"Mortals aren't supposed to be able to do that. Are you saying that we did?"

The old man laughs. "And who _said_ that mortals aren't supposed to be able to do that? Think carefully, and give me an answer."

Benford considers all he has heard, and realizes, quite the opposite might be true. The Loom of Fate, the Core of Gaia, the Design of the Maker... all machines that channel the will of Man. They have to, because unchecked, anything can happen, and in one sense, everything _would_ happen. Benford's empty stomach churns. "If we can... Jesus. I don't even know where to begin. Pol Pot? Hiroshima? Or the excesses of the First Age Solars? Isn't that like giving guns to schoolboys?"

"And so?" The old man clasps his palms together. "Who said this thing?"

"Maybe I just assumed the wrong thing," Benford says cautiously. "So much machinery has been set in place, to constrain mortals, that we see those constraints as law. But... the existence of that machinery implies the opposite conclusion. It implies that, without those machines, we could dictate reality. It also implies that perhaps we should not; and that is not the same as saying we cannot. Right?"

"That follows," nods the old man.

Benford asks, "Does Autocthon fear us?"

"It is naturally to fear that which you don't understand," the adult points out. "And humanity has demonstrated abilities which extend beyond its conceivable capabilities."

"So even He doesn't know, in the grandest scheme of things, who made who. It might have been Him; it might have been Us." Benford draws in the air with a finger, a nervous habit that he had before he was crippled. "Whatever Will triumphs in the current crisis, must have been the more powerful all along."

"Just so," the old man agrees.

"Then it's all down to experiment," Benford concludes. "This is the question that divides Autocthon. This whole affair shall provide extraordinary and incontrovertible proof."

"And now that you understand, it is time for you to become one of us," the child says.

Benford stares at the boy. "Sorry... one of who?"

"You will join with Autochthon's creations. You will partake of their existence."
