# Fall of Eden 2008-06-27

The featureless white space is occupied by four beings: a child, a mature man, and an old man, and Benford. Benford considers how the quartet is related to the classic pattern of the Norns. _What does that make me, then? Something else, I guess. The Maiden, the Mother, the Crone, and the Wyrd._

"It is time for you to become one of us," the Child repeats.

Benford grimaces. "I came here with that intention. However, I do not yet see how doing so will benefit the world."

"Of _course_ you don't see. That is why you must become one of us. So that you _will_." The child smiles playfully.

Benford sighs. "I imagine this will be like dying. I accepted years ago that I wasn't going to live very long, and I wouldn't be surprised if today is when I would have died, had I not Exalted. So be it, then." _Besides, it worked for Gandalf._

The old man produces a small vial. It seems like a typical Erlenmeyer flask, with 'NEWTON BENFORD' incongruously written on the taped label on the base. "Fill this up," he says.

Benford is puzzled for a moment, but then he remembers: this isn't normal spacetime. He begins with the idea of who he is, and tugs at the rim of the flask to make it big enough to hold that idea: "I am Newton Alexander Benford, Solar Exalted of the Twilight Caste. I came to this place for the good of all people; past, present, and future."

Benford finds himself falling into the mouth of the flask, pushing against either side of the stem with both hands to widen it (or maybe shrink himself?) Then he's through the bottleneck, and falling. Memories flicker through his mind as he repeats the mantra; his life in a nutshell. He remembers growing up in a dozen British navy bases, with his mother and father; then attending Oxford, among ordinary Britons for the firts time; then attending Princeton, the excellent beer and thrilling American women. Then the disease, and back to Oxford as a teacher, and a dull grey grind of papers, meetings, and experiments, seeking the Holy Grail of nuclear power. And then... reaching out into twilight; Exaltation; and the war.

All of this is Benford, and so all of this is the mantra. He falls towards the bottom of the flask, although it doesn't seem to get any closer to him. His stream of thought is no longer familiar. Identity requires separation, and now, Benford is no longer alone.

In what will probably be the most alien sensation he will ever experience, Benford feels himself _poured_. He understands what he has become with every fiber of his Solar nature: a construct of Essence, divested even of flesh and blood and neuron. The firing of electrochemical synapses no longer sing the song of biological humanity, for that pale shadow of his true self has been stripped from him.

Now he has been poured into a new vessel, a new container. Fragmentary pieces of true knowledge snap themselves like memetic antibodies onto the outer fringes of his thought, where all his questions and doubts lie. New truths impose themselves on his consciousness. Elsewhere, there is another him, and there is an unbreakable bond to it. But for now, he feels himself rushing back to meet the outer world.

His eyes flex and then dilate open, like a camera snapping a photo. An alien rainbow of strange colors assaults his awareness. And as he struggles to regain control of his body, he hears it making a clicking noise. Over him, dark and light shapes dance in a hazy blur.

The song comes to him. The song of order, whose barest outlines he remembers from his human experience. The song of the neurocytes. Now it is a fractal symphony, beautiful in its broadest outlines, infinitely detailed as he directs his inner ear to the notes and the textures. He finds his own song hiding within it, buried in a tiny corner of the etude of eternal harmony.

He is Benford-2009, an experimental vessel holding a Solar spark. He doesn't need to see his handlers or the technicians assisting his reawakening. He _hears_ them, hears the song of their inevitability, knows the melody of their care. A whisper of their questions springs to his lips, something he knows they'll ask even before they do so: "Benford. Are you functional?"

"I am," he replies simply.

Benford '09 finds himself curious about his surroundings, and listens. The song he hears is Alchemical Decantation Vat 933 - Glorious Harvest. He is the 53rd Alchemical to be released from this Vat in its history, and the Vat's song rings proudly in his ears, telling him of the children it has given birth to.

Benford tries to move, sloshing the vat's assembler solution a bit. He doesn't feel very different. The train of memory that was the focus of his being moments ago seems intact. _But then if it were disrupted, how would I ever know? Am I me, or just a machine programmed to believe that I am?_ And he realizes that the question is pointless. "I remain Benford," he tells the vat, and whoever else is listening. "Let us review the experimental data. I anticipate that others will benefit from the results."

Benford is extracted from the Vat. He finds himself lowered onto a waiting gurney, then steam-cleaned. Curiously, though he can feel high-pressure, high-temperature jets of water spraying over him, he feels no particular pain. It's just information: _you are being cleaned off with water vapor_.

Several figures gather around him. Most are humanoid. All are obviously artificial. Glowing red eyes, claw-like hands, and other mechanical features set them apart. Their songs come to Benford, and he knows their true names - not the names they're given when they wander the Earth. He knows too of the naming of them, as the threads of associative memory dance with the everpresent symphony. There is a man here, Silas, who has given these creatures human names in jest. Axel, Gerhard, Cam.. these things didn't come from a dictionary. There's a human intelligence supplying the Alchemicals here with cultural guidance.

The names of the Alchemicals bring Benford's encounters with them to mind. Benford raises his own hand to his eyes, so he can inspect it, and it is identical to the original, although he realizes the emulation is, literally, skin-deep. He recalls that there was some bit of humanity missing from even the advanced Alchemicals, even Engel, who made it his task to rebel. Between the song in his mind and the machines under his skin, a lot of things are starting to make sense. "I have a responsibility to humanity," he says quietly, "but I sense that I now have a responsibility to the Alchemicals, as well. You all seek to improve yourselves. I represent one path. We shall see where it leads." And then, he smirks; and the moment of humor confirms for him that he is still human. "Take me to your leader, this Silas."

Silas seems to be a middle-aged human male, clean-shaven and bespectacled, sitting at an extremely tidy desk. He looks up when Benford enters the room. "Ah, hello," he says. "Come for a naming, have you? Come in, come in. Tell me about yourself." He peers at Benford over the top of his glasses. "You're a new model line, aren't you? You seem different."

Benford consults his own Song. Mechanically, he's similar to one of the advanced infiltrators, such as Cam or Engel. Unlike Engel, however, his form seems static. The primary purpose of the machine is simply to be Benford's vessel and prove that such a thing can take place. "I suppose that I am. It's curious that you weren't informed about the project. Do they like to surprise you?"

"What? No, they don't usually surprise me, that's not their nature... oh. One moment," says Silas. His eyes unfocus and flicker slightly, and Benford notices that their rhythm correlates closely with certain elements of the Song that surrounds him. "Oh! _That_ is a most intriguing variation, my word yes. I suppose _you'll_ be positively full of surprises." He seems bashful. "Sorry, this is usually so routine I don't always think to listen to all the details."

"You don't have to apologize," Benford replies. "I'm still more or less in shock. I was very afraid of going through with it. And now..." he shrugs diffidently. "It's amazing, yes; but I thought it would, I don't know, blow my mind. In some fascinating and horrific way." He pauses and looks Silas over again; middle-aged, but that probably doesn't mean much here. "Did they take you from Earth?"

"Why certainly," says Silas. "Where else would I have come from? It's Earth they need their agents named for, after all." Silas stands up and looks Benford over. "Very intriguing," he repeats. "Integrating human souls into an Alchemical body isn't unheard of, of course - got some strange data from some of those, I hear - but usually it's an Alchemical that's running the show." He taps his chin. "And you don't seem overawed with it, either. Why not, I wonder? It certainly... how did you put it... blew _my_ mind." And Silas grins.

Benford says, "I'd met some others before coming here," Benford says. "Axel, Gearhard, and Cam, in particular. I wish I'd gotten to know Engel a little better. Anyway, the Alchemical presence on Earth may soon be a matter of public record. It's already a matter of heated rumor." He looks at the Alchemical escort waiting nearby, who are more obviously mechanical. "Tell you what. Let's have a seat, and I'll tell you what I know, as long as it doesn't endanger an ally. In return, I'd like to know more about what you've seen here. You're the only human in Alchemical employ that I've met. That itself is worth speaking to."

"Certainly, certainly," says Silas happily. "Here," he says, offering Benford the guest chair. "You'll want to have a seat... oh right, you already know that," he says as he sits back down at his desk again. "Usually for a naming interview I just ask about your previous function, and come up with something as related to that as I can. But this is going to be a very different interview, isn't it? What would _you_ like to know?"

"He will want to know everything, of course!" calls out a youthful voice. Its source is a young boy with bright eyes and a very pleased smile who has deigned to appear from out of nowhere. "I'm sure these are stories worth hearing for all of us."

Benford waves to the boy, and sits in the proferred chair. "Previous function. Yes. Well, I was - am - a particle physicist. That's kind of taken a back seat of late. And what the lad means when he says I want to know everything, is that my scientific curiosity is insatiable." Benford purses his lips before continuing. "Sometimes I think that's a character flaw. But it hasn't killed me yet. I wonder, Silas... are you the only human here?"

"Yup," says Silas. "Apart from the symbiotes. And you, of course. But of course, the symbiotes are just echoes of humanity, really. And you're... well, you're a special case, aren't you? A full human soul in an Alchemical body. And a particle physicist..." Silas rubs his chin, as if an idea had occured to him, then shakes his head. "No, I'm entirely human. I suppose I'm the experimental group." The man chuckles at this thought.

Benford says, "Well... I don't want to pry, but doesn't that get lonely?" He gestures back to one of the claw-handed mechanical men. "I'm sure he's a nice guy, but it must have been a while since you met another... um... I almost said 'flesh and blood' human. Let's just say 'mere mortal' and leave it at that."

"Lonely? When I've got the whole Song to listen to?" asks Silas. He shrugs. "Well, I suppose it is kind of nice to talk to another human for a change. Even one like yourself."

"The song. Ah, yes." Benford closes his eyes and listens to it for a moment. Sometimes, when he was in the lab late at night, he imagined that he could hear something like it. He always had a faith, of sorts, in the order and energy hidden between the smallest of things. But that imagined song is nothing like the thing he hears now; the neurocytes provided only a low-fidelity channel that made little sense in the waking world. He opens his eyes again. "They said, 'Become one of us'. I am still who I was, but now I can hear the Song. So that must be the critical difference. So perhaps this should be a music appreciation lesson for me, Silas? Would you be so kind as to teach me how to listen?"

Silas laughs. "Good sir, I'm not the person to talk to about that. You want to talk to one of our hosts about that," he says, gesturing to one of Benford's escorts. "They can lead you in the right direction." Silas smiles gently and leans back and half closes his eyes. "I'm just a fan, as you might say. You want an art critic."

Benford says, "Alright. We'll leave that for later, then." _Interesting. A cyberspace junkie. If Timothy Leary were still alive he'd be thrilled._ "So usually an Alchemical comes here, you do an interview, and then a naming. And then he heads off for the... what did they call it? The conduit?"

"I don't usually concern myself with the details," says Silas. "But yes, they usually start on their mission after that. They've been, well, Assembled by the time they come to me. It doesn't make sense for me to give a name to something that's incomplete. Names are important, you know. Or so they tell me."

"Some names come before birth," says the child suddenly. "I wonder why that is? Were you named before you were born?"

Benford is taken aback by the child's comment. "Maybe," he says slowly. "In one important sense, yes. Most parents have names picked out prior to birth. That name is kind of a legal fiction, though. Do we have other names?"

"Come to that... I keep forgetting you weren't created as Assembled," says Silas. "So that means _you'd_ already have a name, wouldn't you? The name you had when you were a 'flesh and blood human'?"

"Silas, do you have other names?" asks the child. "I am Hugh. I wonder, though, if my name were something else, what might I become?"

Benford says, "I think you would still be you, Hugh. They took who I was and poured it into a mechanical shell. Names may be more than labels, but I think that if you just went around using a different name... well... you'd still know who you were, wouldn't you?"

The child listens to Newton and then turns his eyes back to Silas, waiting expectantly.

Silas looks puzzled. "But my name is Silas. What do you..." He scratches his head. "I guess there's my full name - Silas Gordon. Is that what you mean? I mean, if I had any other names, I don't know about them."

Benford says, "Well... you could find out in the Lands of Light. And as I understand the Song, it might be related. An user interface, as it were, to the Lands of Light. Or at least the subset that is the collective Alchemical mind."

The child closes his eyes for a moment, looking completely focused on some thought. A soft laugh marks the end of the consideration and then he is silent once more, listening carefully.

Silas's eyes unfocus again. "I suppose I have a... job description here. Giver of Names. Before that, it was Librarian. But those aren't names, are they? They're just descriptions. They can be used as part of a name, but they aren't names by themselves." He turns to Benford. "Come to that, what was - er, what is _your_ name?"

"Newton Benford. Late of CERN. I apologize for not mentioning it, that was rude of me. And for Alchemicals, purpose, job description, and name may all be the same thing. Think of that. You named him Axel, but his true name was his purpose.

Silas' eyes widen. "No kidding? You're Newton Benford?" The man coughs. "Well, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. It wouldn't be just anyone who the Alchemicals would pick for an experiment like yours." Silas nods. "The Alchemicals do have deeper names, yes. And they're much like descriptions, as you suggest. But they'd sound impossibly alien to human ears, which is where I come in. I give them... well, _human_ names. Human names as well as being machine names, which seems to be fitting."

The child's eyes widen and he claps his hands. "Amazing!" His curiousity is sparked once more. "Newton Benford, what will you give the Alchemicals?"

Benford considers what he's just heard. "Maybe they need human names to operate in a human world. The rest of the universe was made for us... or so it seems; and there's the Weak Anthropic Principle gone to hell." Benford sighs. "I'll give them... I don't know. If I give them the ability to seek their own purpose, then they'll be just like humans. Would they want that?" He leans back and laces his fingers behind his head. "A few hours ago I came in here thinking I might have to fight my way out and leave a trail of destroyed Alchemicals in my wake. I didn't relish the thought, but humanity is my first priority. Now?" He's silent for a moment. "I know you haven't monkeyed with my head, but I think there's something I'm meant to do for the Alchemicals, as well. Not mere destruction. Renaming? I wonder."

"But what is a name?" asks the child. "If I call you Bird, will you fly, Newton Benford?"

Benford says, "I'm not an Alchemical. I do not think you can change my name so easily. But get access so the right part of the Lands of Light? Well. Maybe."

Silas laughs openly at Hugh as he listens. "Imagine! Thinking you could get someone to fly just by calling them 'Bird'! Like 'bird' was some kind of magic word?"

Benford says, "In that library, Mister Gordon, did you ever come across mention of Creation? They had some pretty outrageous phenomena there. I didn't really believe in magic words before. Magic spells, maybe, if I'd been working too hard. There are places where you can go that such things seem to be possible."

Silas blinks, and then coughs bashfully. "Oh. Really? Well, I guess 'magic' wasn't so far off, was it?" He looks at Benford. "I expect you probably know more about magic than I do. Does Hugh's question make sense after all, then?"

Benford blinks, and looks away for a moment. "I'm sorry, Silas. I guess that sounded arrogant. Truth be told, I don't like to believe it. I'm quite attached to my nice rational universe, so it's even less appropriate for me to be preaching at you. The question, however, remains, and it does make sense. So let's see if we can test the idea." He looks back at his mechanical escort. "You there. Please tell me your concise task description."

One of the Alchemicals responds. It speaks in English, but what Benford really hears is the song. It is sent to study betrayal and treachery. It has gathered quite a lot of data from Europe, Asia, and Africa. He can feel the life experiences of the thing seeping into him. And he can even feel Autochthon's reactions to this learning experience: the Machine God finds the idea abhorrent.

Meanwhile, Silas scratches his head, as if trying to wrap his mind around something. "So... Dr. Benford... you figure a flying Name breaks the 'nice rational universe'? Such an idea is inherently irrational?"

"Even when we do not like what we see, seeing remains beautiful," murmurs Hugh. He tilts his head at Silas' question, then looks to Newton with a grin.

Benford winces at the flood of experiences from the Alchemical. "I'm so sorry, my lad. We hardly put our best foot forward with you, did we? But let's see if we can test the notion. It isn't so much that my rational universe falls apart if we can do such... ontological engineering... as I was expecting the truth to be more, I don't know, more misanthropic." He waves at the Alchemical again. "Why is it that the best examples of misanthropy are anthropogenic," he asks of nobody in particular.

The fair-haired youth smiles. "Form follows function," he says a little sadly. "Anything that does something will tend to look like what it does. You figure it out."

Benford says, "You're essentially saying, it's because we're so good at it. Hmm."

"Silas," Benford continues. "Let's try to change this fellow's name. Not radically, I don't think we have that right."

"Humans have a very special title. It's not as bad as you think. In fact, it's quite good if you fully understand it. The God of Destruction."

Benford gapes at Hugh. After a few seconds, the best he can manage is, "Huh? Who calls us that?"

Hugh nods quickly at Benford. "I imagine everyone will, in time. A name of great importance."

"Not that I'm objecting or anything to your plan, Dr. Benford," says Silas, "but... would you object to _yourself_ being the subject of the experiment?"

Benford realizes that Silas is correct, and sighs. "Yes, I would, in general; but no, I won't, in this case. It's for science and I can't compel anyone else to be the subject."

"I didn't intend to compel you, either," says Silas. "But when you mentioned you were a physicist, I got to thinking. There's another physicist... died not too long ago, I hear... who had some interesting ideas about the world. He thought that it was possible that humans themselves might change the laws of the universe to suit themselves, and that the universe was made of information. And his name is exactly the sort of thing I would give to an Assembled."

"How would you feel about being named... Wheeler?"

Benford says, "If it turns out he was correct? I don't suppose that I would mind. Maybe the name is the shape that is given to Essence, like that ... flask." He doesn't expand on the description.

"Well, give it a try," says Silas. "Go by that name, and learn what it means. Learn more about the _other_ Wheeler. And later on... when you've had a chance to absorb both his ideas and your name... come back, and we'll see if it's changed you."

Benford-2009 considers what Silas has said. "Yes. We'll do that. It seems that we're going to end up with several of me anyway. We have the right to be our own person. So Benford can keep his name for when he gets his soul back. I'll be Wheeler. I think that we'll be allies, but I know how much of an arrogant prick I - well, he can be. We'll see if he can learn some humility from this experience."
