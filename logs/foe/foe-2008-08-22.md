# Fall of Eden 2008-08-22

As he studies the problem of the portal, Wheeler comes to several important conclusions, just from thinking his situation over.

First, that the matter of Essence starvation of Creation - and the possible destruction of Gaia's Essence control - is a problem of transcendental importance to Autochthon. Ergo, the Great Maker would have long ago assigned resources appropriate to the task. If Wheeler has been assigned, now, those resources must have failed to solve the problem.

His second realization is that he is still changing. He has not yet partaken of the fullness of Autochthonian nature. The Song is still insinuating itself into his being, and will keep doing so the more he relies on it.

"Therefore," Wheeler mutters, "records of their previous efforts should exist, and I should review them immediately. And there's something else I must know, something fundamental, which would certainly be answered therein." He closes his eyes to listen to the Song. _Where may I find my predecessors?_

With the feeling of certainty, Wheeler _knows_ that the previous Alchemical who was assigned to study the matter has been disassembled and archived. But similarly he knows where to seek out the archived memories of that creature.

Wheeler opens his eyes and begins walking for the far door. He calls to Hugh and Silas over his shoulder, "I'm going to do some research. Your presence would be appreciated." But he neither delays, nor does he explain. The Song has provided a clarity of purpose, and transportation is waiting.

Silas follows in Wheeler's wake. He doesn't bother asking why; the Assembled always have a purpose, which they reveal when and if it's necessary, and Silas is used to assuming he'll find out when he needs to find out.

The Autochthonian world, or at least the part where Wheeler now finds himself, is a maze of tubes, tunnels, cavernous chambers, and claustrophobic enclaves, organized according to some inhuman plan. Their transport moves through it all like a canister through a pneumatic tube... _Or,_ Wheeler thinks, like a fly through an airport. Their destination is simultaneously cavernous and claustrophobic. The pod rises through an iris door into the stacks of a vast library, with shelves full of dimly glowing objects stretching off as far as can be seen in every direction. Small carved plaques identify the contents of each shelf. As Wheeler approaches, the lamps on shelf brighten in sequence, illuminating the archives of the project, in a straight line stretching off to the horizon.

"Part archives, part mausoleum," Wheeler remarks. "How... anthropic."

The knowledge of how to proceed is given to the pseudo-Alchemical. He places his hand on a glowing orb socketed on the shelf. He feels his very hand shifting and reconfiguring itself, plugging into the orb's interface. A new partition of Wheeler's mind makes itself known - what he can remember has suddenly been expanded to include an outside source.

"Oh, wow," Wheeler breathes. "Silas... I can hear them... I remember being them..." Wheeler senses five other minds that have come before him; just a handful of Alchemicals, tasked with resolving the Essence problem. "Five of them, for such a grand problem. They must have been formidable individuals, indeed. Let's start with the first. How did Autochthon come to know of the problem? Whom did he first task with solving it?"

"A sense of wonder," Silas comments with a smile, observing Wheeler's reactions more than his actual work. "How fascinating. The early models didn't have that at all."

Wheeler feels a twinge of regret, over something lost. "Wonder pervades the Maker, but it is a peculiar kind. I don't think that we were ever just automata." He pauses. "Whether Benford lives on in me, or is dead, or something else entirely, he would think that this is worth it."

"Oh, quite, quite," acknowledges Silas. "Curiosity is a basic part of the program for any of the Alchemicals devoted to investigation or study. But what I'm getting to see, watching you, is something quite novel. Most Alchemicals, even the ones capable of expressing wonder, never felt it about their own nature."

Wheeler continues his inspection of the data, searching for answers to the critical question: _What problem could the Maker, father of all Science, not solve on his own?_ "Maybe that's important, then," he says offhandedly. "Maybe that's something that we need to teach them. The human condition, by comparison, is defined by separation. Our minds are always apart. Our souls travel as discrete units. To be an Alchemical, is to be one with a divinity." He halts his search for a moment. "You know, this can't be the first time that's come up. Has anyone else ever tried to socket a human soul into an Alchemical life-form?"

"Not that I know of," says Silas, answering Benford's question. "And I think I'd be one to know, since they'd send him to me for naming. There was, of course, a line of Assembled that were fused with human symbiotes, but that's a very different proposition from a full human soul."

The first agent to do the investigation was designated Balance-1. It was a primitive version of an Alchemical agent, designed to operate entirely in the Lands of Light and Autochthonia proper. Strictly speaking, it had little more than a mind and the ability to operate Autochthonian devices by remote control.

The second, Balance-2, was an experiment in human emulation. It was based on research that enabled the symbiote technology. Its successor, Balance-3, was less of a proper Alchemical and more like an exploratory probe intot he further recesses of the reincarnation system. It, too, was based on research into the process of soul reincarnation.

Balance-4 and Balance-5, respectively, operated from Creation and from Gaia, attempting to cooperate to determine the source of the Essence flow by combining data.

So far, the experiment that is Wheeler has not been attempted. Projects like Engel are the closest that Autochthon has come.

Wheeler frowns. "Even combining data, Four and Five couldn't work it out? What did the humans call them?"

Balance-4 and -5 were anonymous; they simply existed to blend into their respective worlds. While Balance-5 was transmitted via the portal, Balance-4 was constructed on Creation itself, by the Cult of Autochthon present there.

Benford summarizes all of this for Silas. "So they expect to do better with me, by merging Benford's soul with an Alchemical's purpose. In all cases the Balance probes were researching reincarnation and human souls. Why is that the focus of the investigation? Is the essence drain expected to follow the same channel?"

Silas has managed to learn a little bit about Wheeler's research project. Though he has no particular knowledge of Essence, he has some reply. "Well, when did this imbalance start?" he asks. "When the Solars began to enter Gaia, right?"

The Balance Alchemicals arrived at this through process of elimination. There are a finite number of cross-domain connections between Creation and Gaia. One: the Well of Udr. Confirmed not to be the case through local observation. Two: the conduit of reincarnation, by which Gaia brings souls to Earth and sends them back to Creation. Inconclusive data. Three: the sympathetic resonance between the Essence of the Incarnae locked into each Celestial spark, and the corresponding god in Creation. Inconclusive data.

The Essence imbalance was first noted when Solars began incarnating in Gaia. However, Wheeler realizes something else, something important.

"I seem to recall that," Wheeler answers slowly. "But I think I've found something. This may take some time. Please warn me if I don't move for an inhumanly long period." And he is silent for a long time thereafter, reviewing - literally, re-living - the experiences of Balance-3.

"They've been at it with finer and finer instruments," Wheeler mutters, mostly for Silas' benefit. "There was once the Well of Udr, and the Abyssal known on earth as Ra came through it. He did not reincarnate there like the other souls. Too bad; he could have disproved the hypothesis that it's Solars dragging Essence to Earth. That would have been my favorite theory, since through the Sparks, the associated Incarnae have one foot in both worlds, as it were. All that observation has so far just left a Gordian knot."

Wheeler puts his other hand on the orb, but discovers that it doesn't actually improve throughput. He frowns. "My five brothers," he says, "you ran to your honorable limits. I sense we have the pieces of the puzzle but still not the order. Help me vindicate you, and save my human kin." And then he's completely still, lost in their old memories, sifting for answers. _Solars don't just 'incarnate'. The Spark gets implanted. No Spark, no Solar. So next question: how did the Sparks get to Earth?_

An answer in the form of a question suggests itself. Not from the orb, nor from Wheeler's mind, but from a spoken question by Hugh. "Well... you were a human soul, right? Called to Earth by Gaia at some point. And you had a Solar spark, which also must have traveled. So..... don't _you_ remember how it happened?"

Wheeler is surprised to hear the saturnine youth's voice. "My memory begins far after birth. How would I recall that?"

The young man shrugs winsomely. "I dunno. How would you?" But he doesn't carry the same refusal of possibility in his voice. His words, as always, are tinged with one emotion: hope.

Wheeler unplugs from the Balance archive, and his hand resumes its familiar shape. "Maybe that's why it's better to be human," he quips. "But just now... hmm. Did they build anything like that in, when they made me? An introspection interface?"

After a few moments, Wheeler knows positively that he doesn't have such a system. But his Engine does. The Contrite Diagnostic Interface is designed to interface to the spark. Perhaps it could be adapted, changed, the way Benford transformed the Symbiogenesis device. Davronian soul science should make it possible.

"For that matter," Wheeler begines worriedly, "Where is my... Benford's... oh, whatever. Where's Hypatia and Junior?"

The human Benford still exists, kept unconscious until he is needed. Wheeler knows just where to find him - Biological Studies Unit.

The revelation shocks Wheeler... but only for a moment. Whatever is happening to him, the only way out is through. He points to the archive orb. "Keep this handy," he calls to the unseen attendants. "On my authority." And then they're off again, sinking back into the tubeways.

The Biological Studies Unit is clinical, but no human would ever mistake it for a hospital. The corridors wind past hundreds of vats, each containing different specimens under test. Some rooms, behind sealed partitions, contain... less savory experiments. Wheeler discovers that he can no longer experience the visceral, sympathetic pain for living things in such conditions, but he remembers to be disturbed, and requests a different route to Benford's suite.

"Silas... I'll understand if you want to stay home for this one. And if you're interested, apparently Alchemicals can feel sympathy for living things. Engel came very close to it as well, as I recall."

Silas chews on his lip. The Song in these rooms is not comfortable to the human mind. "If... if you don't mind?" he says. "I'll wait out here. I'm sure they can patch you through from inside if you have a question for me."

Wheeler listens to the Song, taking comfort as it explains the necessity of the experiments. Hugh tugs on Wheeler's sleeve, beatific and childlike. Wheeler smiles back, uncertain if he's being genuine, or following a programmed response. "Yeah. Anyway. I suppose it's a personal matter for me as well." And by a more circuitous route, he finds his way to Benford.

The scientist is much the same - comatose, lying supine in a sealed cylinder of clear fluid. Possibly vitrified, to keep him fresh. Wheeler places his hand on the lid. "Well now. I'll do my best for you, old man. And everyone else we ever cared about, to the best of my abilities. Just like you'd do. So maybe it's not 'you' and 'me', as much as it is 'us'. And now we know, it's worth the trip.'" And then, to the matter at hand.

Over the next several hours, Wheeler tireless and patiently reviews the design for his own Engine, and the Spark itself. Both are incredibly complex machines, and Wheeler spends much of the time lost in the song, trying to understand the flood of information that represents their order, purpose, and reason. Benford's memories provide him with an appropriate analogy: the euphoric sensation of heavy narcotics. In short, Wheeler is tripping.

Therefore, perhaps, it's well for Wheeler to have an Alchemical's single-mindedness. He knows that Autochton considers the Spark to be a crowning acheivement, and the machine reflects the Maker's glory in a million subtle melodies. But Wheeler's purpose is an echo of that same glory, and so in the end, he sticks to his job.

Tools are brought to him from all over the Alchemical installation, by drones of every size and shape. Other parts are purely Essential constructs, visible only in the Song and by exotic instruments. The material part, drawing from designs by the Solar named Davron, comes to resemble the Symbiogenesis Device: a heavily-instrumented chair, mated to Benford's suspension tank via thick cables of exotic alloy.

At last, Wheeler is done, and remembers enough humanity to check the clock. _Helios. Three bloody days!_

Wheeler sends a message to Silas and Hugh, requesting their presence. He also asks the Archivists to bring the Balance series sphere for reference. He's only a little surprised to discover that the Biological Studies Unit has changed shape around his little project. The suspension suite is now located at the center of sizable amphitheater, and populated with dozens of silent automata. The Maker, apparently, wants witnesses; or perhaps just has a large crew handy, to clean up the mess.

Wheeler remembers his, or rather Benford's, doctoral dissertation, right down to the shooting pain that came from his stubborn refusal to use crutches. _Well, I'm not going to knuckle under either,_ Wheeler thinks. He takes his place in the interface chair, and the machine plugs cables into the interface ports on his limbs and spine. "Hope you enjoy the show," he quips to Silas, before going under.

The Spark pervades Wheeler's consciousness. The experience of exploration is akin to walking alone through a city. The Alchemical finds other consciousnesses waiting for him there. Hypatia, his Symbiote; Junior, his avatar, and two he did not expect. Hugh, and Gaia.

Wheeler addresses each in turn. "My old friends, Hypatia and Junior, I am happy and relieved to see you again. My new friend Hugh, I see that you go where you will. And Great Lady..." he stops there. Some tiny cog in the back of his mind, increments Benford's Divinities Counter: the number of Gods of his personal acquaintance. Again, he is reminded of his purpose. "How did I come to you," he blurts.

"You came to me because you are meddling in my business," says Gaia, rather severely. "You've already disrupted the refuge I made for your people, and now you Solars are meddling in the very machinery that you made for me." her expression softens. "But it's to be expected."

"But... Great Lady, I was told that you asked for our aid," Wheeler states simply, ignoring, for the moment, that his Solar status is in question; he senses the point to be immaterial to Gaia.

"'Asked for' is not the same as 'wished for'," Gaia says. "I would much rather that this whole business never have come here. But that's beyond my control now. I don't like it, any more than you seem to."

"I'm not sure it's my place to like it, or not. I feel that this is someone's will. I do not know which, but I have my suspicions." Wheeler looks sidelong at Hugh. "And it would have to be mighty indeed, to trump two Primordials.

Gaia shrugs disconsolately. "It's over and done now. But in any rate, you are here for memories which should not be yours by right. Why do you need them?"

"The Alchemical mask I wear now, would say that it is his purpose, and expect that to suffice." Wheeler shrugs. "But when you come down to it, no matter what body and name I wear today, Great Mother, I'm just trying to give everyone, everywhere, the best chance at a good life that I can. At the moment that means localizing the Essence drain, before the Maker's solution must be implemented, with all the tragic consequences thereof."

"Didn't you tell them about the Deliberative's plan?" Gaia asks this, but directs it to Hugh. The youth nods quickly. "Of course. I don't think they liked it though..." He rubs his hands together nervously. "I guess they decided to try this other thing."

"What plan of the Deliberative?" Wheeler looks blank. "I left my fellows soon after meeting at the Infrared. I know of no plan of theirs."

Hugh hums. "Oh, well. The Deliberative intended to enlist the aid of the Fair Folk in solving the problem. They foresaw it, after all."

Wheeler's eyebrows shoot nearly off his forehead. "You have got to be kidding. And for my next trick, shall I put out a house fire by dousing it in gasoline? Lady, surely that idea isn't more to your liking!"

Gaia's eyebrow arches in answer. "Yes, you're right. Trusting you Celestials. What _was_ I thinking." She taps a fingernail on her forearm, clearly awaiting a response to this.

Wheeler shakes his head. "We've still got a causal problem here. Solars started showing up on Earth. Alchemicals show up to exterminate them. Gaia asks the Deliberative for help sorting out the mess. So the Deliberative sends more Solars to Earth... and cuts a deal with the Fair Folk, to boot. Question: did any Exalts of any kind incarnate on Earth, before the Deliberative sent the Sparks here?

The Earth Mother sighs. "Alright. You've come here risking something significant. Not your life. You're risking your progression as a soul by asking what you want to ask. But I'll tell you more."

"At the dawn of civilization, that man - you know the one - was living among the earliest peoples to build cities and expand as societies, not just tribes. He's always been fated to be the first. He came before the others, to lay down the ancient prophecies and tell the stories that would let your Celestial destinies grow to their fullest power in the millennia to come."

"After him, there were others. Here and there, keeping the Core seeded with the potential for the Exalted to emerge. Finally, the world became strong enough to bear your weight, and your sparks began their migration here. The Deliberative sent volunteers to fight the Alchemicals who were already here - yes, present before the first Solars set foot on Earth."

"The Deliberative composited the sparks' past lives into something akin to a soul, calling it an avatar. And they made it possible for me to call those pseudo-souls to Earth, the way that I've called mortal souls. Like yours, Newton Benford."

Wheeler, or maybe Benford, feels dizzy, and sickened; but here, in the caverns and canyons of his own soul, there's no urge to vomit or fall to his knees. Just a long silence. "We invaded you," he finally whispers. "A place made to spare mankind our shennanigans... God, why?"

"To save it from greater meddling," Gaia says. "The Alchemicals came first, intent on changing things. Autochthon would not relent. He has.. changed. Become something completely different. His children would not withdraw."

"But he must have known what would happen!" Wheeler barks. "And I'm bonded into an Alchemical container now. I can hear the song!" _Great Maker! Why do you do this thing?_

Another presence joins the assembly. Autochthon can be felt, but not seen. And the landscape itself - Wheeler's inner vision of the universe - begins to change, to melt away. What he sees is a city. It could be Baghdad or it could be Los Angeles, but he sees with more than physical eyes. People, wasting energy, hiding thoughts from each other, destroying things around them. He sees piles of garbage, and knows to the ounce what of it could be recycled. He feels the grasping fingers of entropy stealing away the energy of civilization, and knows the ignorance and apathy that men feel for it. He sees the clashing threads of fate which draw men into conflict with each other.

The growing part of himself that is Alchemical sees these things as a stain - a black mark of malice. He feels himself wanting to react to it as though to a bad smell or an offensive sight. It's _wrong_, it's repulsive to him.

Wheeler understands the revulsion; because as Benford, he shared it, more than once. It joins the sick feelings of despair growing in his head. "How could he have changed," he grunts. "An Alchemical's nature is to preserve that nature. They live this way in Eden, as well! And you must know Creation and the people within. Why invade here, and not there? What changed your mind?"

And now Wheeler partakes of a foreign sensation. It is Gaia's nature intruding upon his thoughts, and he receives a moment of clarity from his human heritage. Evolution - the essence of it, or really the Essence of evolutionary progression, is strongest on Earth, the bailiwick of Gaia. Subject to external pressure, any organism will evolve. Those unfit to do so will die off; those who can adapt to the new regime will prosper. And those souls will return to Creation, when they are ready, while new souls will arrive to partake of the new way.

"And what do you seek to evolve," Wheeler demands. But he knows already that the answer doesn't matter. The Maker pursues Excellence. The Maker needs to know if blind Evolution can trump the His beloved Design... because it questions the very Essence of the Primordial. The epiphany leaves him speechless and sputtering once again.

When Wheeler regains his composure, he's surprised to see that Gaia is still there, but then, she has all the time in the world. "He sent me to find the reason for the essence drain. All his machinations, all of the Balance predecessors, discovered inconclusive information. He's been deceived, I'd wager. That Man has been playing a long game, so long and subtle that even the Maker can't tell that the deck is stacked. Perhaps not You either, Lady, though I am ashamed to say that the Celestials are so manipulative."

"It is possible. For the Great Maker to be investigating a matter which the Solar Deliberative had already foreseen and made plans for, speaks volumes." Gaia gestures at Wheeler. "Why, then, does your avatar not simply tell you the mechanism they saw?"

Benford walks over to Junior, who has thus far been silent and bemused. "She says that we're a pastiche, a made thing. On any other day that would drive me mad. But today... well. No matter. Is that something you know?"

Junior smiles slyly. "The first Great Prophecy predicted three dooms for the world. We beat them all. The second Great Prophecy predicted death or exile for the Celestials. Let me just say that we're working on that one."

"And we're supposed to be the tool of that effort?" Wheeler shakes his head. "But they had to leave us choice. Exaltation won't work without it. Which means that whatever cut and paste job they did on you... I'm still a human being. Or will be again. But I still have to know - did the Deliberative engineer the Essence drain? To prop up Earth with Eden, until it could... 'bear our weight?'"

Junior shrugs. "Different kind of Essence. But I'm not sure how much more I can tell you. Prophecy's a funny thing, you know. Simply being told something can skew your destiny."

"Sounds like my destiny is already pretty well bent, lad," Wheeler comments dryly. "But I'm not sure it matters. There's only a handful of entities that can make this sort of thing happen, and it must be one of sufficient cleverness to deceive the Maker. I think the only candidates are in this place - or their representatives are, at least."

"The actual Primordials you see here are just aspects, lodged in your soul," Junior says. "Pieces of them live in everything, you know. You just woke them up a bit more with your own Essence - your investigation into reincarnation and this whole business."

Wheeler asks, "Is that true of Autochthon, as well? Just how much am I his instrument, now?

It is Autochthon's presence which answers this, in the form of knowledge. Wheeler realizes that he _is_ his mission in some regards. He has unlimited choice in how to pursue it, within his Alchemical instinct to act efficiently. He is losing the freedom to drive his own destiny, and at the same time he has also given up the confusion that goes with such freedom.

Still, Newton Benford continues to exist. And Wheeler exists as well, as a shadow or echo of the reality which is he.

Wheeler sits down on the floor of the empty, cold canyons of his own soul, speaking to nobody in particular. "Lord, I think that there's only two possible answers here. The Essence flux is someone's will and plays to someone's plan, and so surely it has been machinated. But if my five predecessors, aided by all our collective wisdom, could not divine the mechanism, then it must be a subtle and powerful deception; for who could out-think the Great Maker in engineering such a thing? And there are only two answers. Either the Celestials orchestrated the thing, anticipating that its need; or you did it to yourself, and have since forgotten, possibly with Celstial complicity." Wheeler shakes his head. "If they - we - whomever... sought to avoid death or exile, they've lain a hell of a burden on the entire world for it. But no matter. I... am... going... to sort this out."
