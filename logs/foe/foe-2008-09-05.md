# Fall of Eden 2008-09-05

The human soul is a messy thing. It was not meant to plugged, unplugged, sliced, or diced. And yet here Wheeler has the first-hand evidence that such tailoring can be done, and has been done.

Stranger than that, however, is the alteration in Benford's Solar Spark, which seems to be neither according to design, nor an accident. The Alchemical in Wheeler does not know if he should he impressed, or horrified, that such a thing has been done to one of the greatest examples of the Maker's handiwork.

The Introspection Interface, built by Wheeler to examine Benford's Spark, includes many tools for investigating the new phenomenon. "So," Wheeler mutters to anyone who might be listening, "We have the Spark, which is the Maker's artifice. Buried within, we have a fragment of the Divine Essence of Helios - also, in some ways, the Maker's handiwork, and that of the other Primordials."

"And that," he continues, scanning the Avatar shell, "is also someone's handiwork, after a fashion. An artificial soul, made from natural ones. The product of Davron's wonderful, terrible science. But it also lives. And in the interface between the two..."

He walks back to the Word, written in a language that everyone would recognize. "Is this. Nobody designed this. But it's the kind of thing that Gaia does to living things, and this whole thing now qualifies as an organism. And it's evolving."

Autochton has made his presence known several times during Wheeler's expedition. The Primordial does so again, and Wheeler can feel the confusion and revulsion... but also a fragment of wonderment. "We do not yet know, My Lord, if Evolution can defeat the Grand Design. I am beginning to suspect that the answer is 'yes'. But there are questions yet to answer."

_They are not in opposition. But only one of them will form the basis of the new regime._

"New regime?" Wheeler sounds confused. "But I thought the plan was simply to kill all of us... the Celestials... and stop the Essence drain. Unless my efforts show a means to plug the leak, I would suppose."

_The new regime will come to pass if that attempt fails._

Wheeler walks around the crater, inspecting the Word, which, it seems, is Hugh's 'name', in some sense. "I get the feeling that I'm looking at it."

Wheeler stops and prods the edge of the crater that the Word has left in the Spark. "Richard Dawkins defined evolution as the non-random survival of randomly varying replicators. So it makes sense to ask: What is the selection function? What is the source of variety? What can we expect that to produce? And most importantly, is this sucking Essence out of Creation?"

"That last one, I suppose, we can answer." Wheeler closes his subjective 'eyes' and calculates the amount of Essence contained in the Word. The Interface has tools to measure such things, as does the Spark itself.

_Everything is Essence_, Wheeler recalls, _and it pays to ask how much._ It's not unlike thermodynamics and relativity: there's a massive amount of energy tied up in matter just existing, so even a single mortal human packs quite a punch, compared to, say, an amoeba. The greatest beings, the Primordials, contain entire worlds. Somewhere in between, there are the Incarna, who embody fundamental principles of those Worlds. And just a step down are the Celestials. So it's conceivable that eroding the Spark, could deprive Creation of quite a bit of Essence. And if it's all going into the Word... well, then, how powerful is Hugh?

Wheeler analyzes the data available. He finds that he's even able to tap into the Supervisor's records of the Core - a feature of Alchemical unity which finds value here. Essence operates in layers in Creation, with the lowest layer functioning as a substrate for functions used by higher layers. For example, at some level there is a magic which connects distant things. That magic is used in turn by the spirit world, which operates at a higher layer. These layers are being overlaid onto Gaia in five distinct stages, according to the Supervisor's predictions. Earth has already experienced one of them.

Each stage is progressively more powerful than the last. The prediction is that the ending Essence level will be at 50% of Creation's total strength. Thus, the ratio of Essence drained is proportional to the size of Earth vs. the size of Creation.

"If Creation is about five times larger, then that means that Creation will lose about 10%... but no. That doesn't tell me anything. If it's going into the Word, it isn't going into Gaia." Wheeler sighs. "One last thing to try, I suppose."

Thus far, Wheeler has spent his efforts inspecting Benford's Spark and Avatar. But the Word before him is of a similar nature; it's somebody's soul, or something like it. The Interface might allow him to experience it more directly. It's possibly foolhardy, but having conceived of the idea, Wheeler's Alchemical nature insists: he must pursue his purpose at all costs.

Wheeler plugs in, and his perspective once again shifts. He is now standing in a large cube, white in color, perhaps twenty feet to a side.

"What the hell?" Wheeler mutters. This wasn't what he expected. "Where am I now?" He walks over and raps on a wall.

"What now?" hears Wheeler from the other side of the wall. "Can't I get five minutes of clean data without..." The wall opens up, and Benford sees a young-looking man, tanned with blonde hair, looking down at him... as if the wall outside were a floor to him. "So what's _your_ story?"

Wheeler doesn't know if he should laugh or cry. "I had a terminal illness, Exalted because of crimes against nature, got shot at by a lot of tin men, and then surrendered to them so they could suck out my soul and pour it into a robot. How's your day going?"

"Hmm?" The man focuses intently on Wheeler, and the dim outline of the words 'Dave Bowman, Wizard' appear on his forehead. "Ah, so it is. A Celestial _and_ an Assembled. Very interesting. What will the Old Man think of next?" He kneels down and sticks out his hand. "I'm Dave Bowman, as you might have guessed. What's your name?"

"Wheeler, for the moment, but if you're certain about the Celestial part, maybe I'm still Benford and just took a wrong turn somewhere." He shakes the other man's hand. "I don't think I've heard of you." Wheeler pauses to consult the Unity; for whatever part of the Autochtonian world he is seeing, there must surely be an explanation for it.

"The mark of the Celestials is on you, like you said," replies Dave. "It wasn't a very precise measurement. Well... welcome to the Lands of Light. But your story left out a crucial bit, which I admit to being a bit curious about: how, _exactly_, did you get here? Don't worry if you don't know why what you did got you where it did."

Wheeler raises an eyebrow. "They know nothing of you. HE knows nothing about you. But I've been to the Lands of Light... so is this just a simulation?" Wheeler pokes himself in the arm, then pinches it. He's wearing the clothes he thought he was wearing earlier today, and he can make himself feel pain. Or is that his mechanical body simulating pain, or the Lands of Light telling him that it hurts? "Hey, look, I'll fill you in, but first, would you happen to have a pin or a knife or something?"

"Will this do?" Dave Bowman pulls out what looks like a Swiss Army knife, only bulkier, and flips out one of the tools, which promptly grows to twice the length of the handle itself. "This _is_ reality, in case you were wondering," says Dave, offering the implement. Just a different... layer of reality, you might say. The Lands of Light as seen from the outside."

Wheeler pricks his finger slightly, and sees... red. It even tastes salty. Might be blood. Might be Dexron-3. He recalls the detail involved in the Golems, and realizes that he's not going to get anywhere this way; but he is who he is, and he's still confused. "Well. Might as well give you the full story, then."

The story when told is easy enough to follow in its causality. The particulars are baffling, mystical, and well outside anyone's experience of course. But it's when Wheeler actually says the word he found that things begin to make more sense. He finds Hugh looking at him, standing next to Dave Bowman. "If you're going to call my name, please have something to say," the young man smiles.

"Hugh," Wheeler starts. "Well... um... sorry. But, uh... why is it that when I tried to ... oh never mind. Did you start here? In the Lands of Light, with Dave Bowman?""

Dave puts his hand to his forehead in a salute. "Hello there, Hugh," he says respectfully.

"I started here," says Hugh. "I am here." He flashes his usual smile. "You might say you are standing on me. And in me."

"He hired me to build this place," adds Dave. "Or in other words, he hired me to build himself."

"And I must say, you've done a fine job," says Hugh.

Wheeler stands up suddenly, and paces the perimeter of the room. "That's interesting. The Lands of Light. Isn't that where the Supervisor said that the excess Essence was being pumped, for the time being? Yes? Into a fractal storage matrix of some kind with theoretically infinite capacity? Hmm. And it's all coming from Creation. But that's a hell of a lot. In fifty years, the entire world, if rates remain constant. And I wouldn't expect it to just sit there, oh no. That much Essence could start a whole new world, couldn't it? Someone surely must have seen that coming, I think." The whirring in Wheeler's head might be a loose wire, or it might be the thrill of discovery that, as a scientist, he's always had. Even when he's wrong, it's beautiful to see when something 'fits'.

Wheeler stops short. "No," he says. "It doesn't work. How could he hire you to build himself? That's a chicken and egg problem." Wheeler consults the Unity again: _Which of us has the earliest memory of the being Hugh?_

Dave grins. "You just heard him say you're standing inside him, when he's standing right in front of you. How is it any stranger that he might hire me to build himself?"

"And nobody has heard of him, either. But I was there! Standing right in the departure chamber! He... you're one with the gate!" Wheeler looks confused almost to panic. "Silas knew you, and hundreds of Alchemicals must pass his way! Dave! Please tell me, do you know any Alchemicals? What are their names?"

"Well, the last Alchemical I saw pass this way was a fellow named Cam.." says Dave.

Wheeler stops, wheels on Dave and Hugh, and stares, gaping.

"You know him?" says Dave, looking somewhat surprised himself. "My word... as large as this realm may be, it really is a small world, isn't it?"

"I'm still a small world, after all," agrees Hugh.

Wheeler closes his eyes, reaches deep into the Alchemical Song, searching for the melody that is Cameron Williams, brother of Charity Williams. _Cam... Brother of Jet... now blood-brother to me... how can you know Dave Bowman when the Maker does not?_

It is Autochthon's voice which answers. _Ask Hugh who he is. Your questions will be answered._

Wheeler opens his eyes; Hugh and Dave Bowman, Wizard are still there. "Hugh... do you know my friend, Cam?"

"Oh, the one who is running around with a Lunar?" asks Hugh. "Just saw him a little while ago, actually."

Wheeler sits down heavily, on the bare white floor of the cube. "Hugh, please pardon the affrontery, but who do you think you are? And who are you supposed to be?"

"I'm the child of Autochthon and Gaia," says Hugh.

"Yeah," Wheeler says. "And you've got your own Song, like His. That makes sense."

"Mine's better," replies Hugh.

"My Lord," Wheeler whispers. "You're killing yourself over this. Dividing yourself, literally. We're staring right at the Essence leak. But why? Why do all of this? What do you want out of this?" Wheeler knows that Autochton will hear him, but he'll take his answers from anyone. "Did you already know? And if so, why task me to finding it?"

"You are missing something important," says Hugh. "There can be only 25." The bright eyes of the youth look at Wheeler with far more seriousness than normal.

"Twenty-five?" Wheeler asks. "Twenty-five what, twenty-five Primordials? I thought there were more than that in... well, in the beginning."

"Things are as they are," says Hugh.

Dave shakes his head. "The number of Primordials has always been twenty-five." He nods to Hugh. "And when it comes to Primordials, the _only_ thing you can know for sure about them is that they are what they are."

"Then for Hugh to be born," Wheeler smiles sardonically, "something's got to die. Funny. A few years ago, after the Alchemicals had nearly blown up my plane, shot me in the head, and chased us all over New York in a trail of explosions and bloodshed, if someone had told me to go kill Autochton, I would have been head of the queue with a very large axe. But given that he's my current employer I'm somewhat reluctant to do him in."

_This is what is to be decided._

Wheeler sighs. "There's only one part of this that I don't follow. Even if we toss causality out the window - and that would be the least strange thing necessary to explain all of this - there's still all of that rot with That Man, and the Deliberative, and the Second Great Prophecy. How did it go? 'Damnation, Death, or Exile?'"

Hugh shakes his head, and smiles winningly at Wheeler. "Don't be silly. You like causality, because you're human. But this is a deeper progression. Consider a writer, although you could also consider a particle physicist or something else."

"A man gets an idea for a story. He writes a first draft, turning ideas over in his head. He plots. He writes character biographies. He adapts his friends or experiences into his work. He takes what he wants to tell - his new idea - and he fills in the particulars with what already exists. The book isn't real yet. You can't go out and buy it. But the idea is real, and that man could answer any question you had for him about his new novel."

"Finally he writes the thing down. It's on paper. It has reality for other people - but is that 'real'? I mean, you had a novel before, it was just that you had to ask a guy about it instead of reading print on paper. The novel goes to the editor, to the publisher, to the bookstands. The man's ideas are disseminated."

"They make a movie about it. Big-name Hollywood actors get chosen for the parts. The novelist gets invited to a cast party. He meets the woman who is going to be playing his character - the character _he_ wrote. A woman who exists in his mind. Only this actress, she has that character in _her_ mind too. The movie gets produced, it's a big hit. Pretty soon people start writing other stories. Pretty soon the novel is even more real than it was in book form, because its ideas are in everyone's head."

Hugh grins. "That's what a Primordial is. An immutable truth. Right now, I'm just an idea. I haven't been born yet."

Wheeler tries to assimilate the whole thing. "Then what are we - humans - to you? Do you need us to believe in you?"

Hugh cocks his head to the side. "Do you believe in gravity?"

Wheeler ponders. "I see."

Hugh nods sagely. "Alright. So..... what about the rest of that stuff?"

Wheeler ponders some more. "There's no use freaking out about Great Prophecies, because we've all still got free will, and it doesn't have to go all awful if we write the proper ending?"

"Sure," says Hugh. "As long as their is choice, there is hope."

"I didn't think we had any," Wheeler muses. "So I came here. It doesn't make a lot of sense. In retrospect it feels more like I lost my mind."

"Maybe you did," says Hugh. "Did you find it here?"

Dave adds, "It's a good place to find minds, after all."

Wheeler is silent for a minute. He already knows that the answer is 'yes'. What slows his response, is his memory of Benford, and in particular Benford's fear. He now sees that the future, which had looked like a dead end, will be wide open - more open than Benford could have imagined.

"Yes. I am Newton Alexander Benford, PhD, and I have found hope."
