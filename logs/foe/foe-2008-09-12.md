# Fall of Eden 2008-09-12

Wheeler, or perhaps Benford once more, is preparing to take his leave of Dave Bowman. He tries to sum up his final thoughts. "So now we have a hypothesis that fits all the facts, but there's one break in symmetry that I must be missing. Hugh is the child of Autochton and Gaia, and is made from the Essences of both. Sadly, there are only twenty-five Primordials, and in order to be born, he must replace one. So why Autocthon? Why not Gaia?" He pauses. "I mean, I have plenty of reasons why I don't want the Earth do die, but is the decision arbitrary? And what about people living here? Like you, Dave, or Silas? Or even the Alchemicals, many of whom seem to qualify for personhood? What happens to them?"

"That's a tricky question, sir," says Dave, scratching his head. "Then again... last I heard, there was a conflict within Gaia between your current faction and your former one. Maybe the question of which Primordial Hugh will replace is still in dispute?"

Wheeler comments, "But either way, a Primordial dies. Or changes, since that is not dead which must lie eternal. At any rate, that's a feat of cosmic engineering. I still wonder if it was Davron's technology that set it off. He built the Chair, and that changed the game somehow."

"Many a landslide has its origin in a single fallen pebble," replies Dave enigmatically. If he reacts in any way to the Solar's name, he hides it well.

Wheeler nods knowingly. "Well. I better get back to it, then." In the back of his mind, he calls up the sequence to reverse the many layers of his dive through Benford Spark.

---

Hugh is waiting in Autochthonia when Wheeler returns from his mission. "It's just you and me right now," the boy says with a smile. "I hope you don't mind holding off reporting to your boss. But.. this is important."

Wheeler raises an eyebrow. "Then I choose to listen. Let the boss wait."

"You asked about those people who live in Gaia, or live here. Well... what did you think would happen?" Hugh scratches his head with a pair of fingers. "Their world goes away. Their souls transmigrate into the new state. But if you want to know if Mr. Smith will still be driving his prized Chevy to work, or if A113 will still be scrubbing grime off of conduits with his second scrub-brush, the answer is 'probably not'."

"And I guess some people would say 'well isn't there a way to make it all work so that everyone is happy.' 'Why do they have to go through this.' 'Why can't it just be easy for everyone.'" Hugh cocks his head and stares. "You all forget, every time you come back. You always, always forget. But I'll tell you anyway. Each of you, all of you, every last one of you, _put yourselves where you are_."

"I won't pretend to understand," Wheeler cautiously replies. "I'm still only human, I think. I came here because the implied shake-up in the world scared the hope out of me. Now..." He shrugs. "I suppose you'd know what you're talking about. And with what I've learned, I won't be afraid." And then he grins, a very human gesture. "If I understand rightly, you bring a new world with you. The path to the future is narrow, but finding that path is what Celestials are for."

In response, Hugh gives an enthusiastic thumbs-up.

"I also wonder if you know..." Wheeler asks cautiously. "Is He going to let me go home now? And if He doesn't, do I end up like Engel?"

"Wheeler's going to stay. I think they're probably going to try and kill Benford." Hugh shrugs. "If you want to do something about that, now's the time to think about it."

Wheeler runs a hand over Benford's suspension cell. "You control the Gate. You _are_ the gate, one foot here, one foot there. He came here through you. Can you get him home?"

Hugh shakes his head. "Until I'm born, I don't really have that kind of power. I'm all hat and no cattle. But you can act."

"I would," Wheeler murmurs, "if I knew what the hell to do." But he's already tapping on the control pad, and then his fingertips fold back and he plugs into its machinery. "They send Alchemicals to Earth all the time. It would be easy enough to change the label..." And he stops. "As soon as we're done talking, He'll know exactly what I've been doing."

"Well, I can give you _that_ much cover. After all, there's still some part of you that's human." Hugh smiles innocently. "So that puts you in my domain, not his."

Wheeler nods. "Alright. Then that's what we'll do." He loads a program into the suspension machine, which will revive Benford upon return to Earth. He also downloads recordings of Wheeler's experiences, and tidies up the intrusion done by his ad-hoc symbiogenesis machine as best he can. Finally he adds a personal note: "We were an only child. Now there are two of us. I have to stay here, and I do it gladly because I guess that's who I am now. But this much remains: You use your mind to find the right path, and do the best you can for who you can. So shall I; nobody can ask a thinking being for more than that."

Wheeler asks Hugh, "Can you ask Silas to join us?"

Silas arrives, and Wheeler explains. "They're going to ask me to take out Benford's Spark. That will likely kill him." Behind Wheeler, the screen on the sarcophogus momentarily blinks: I DON'T WANT TO KILL HIM. "His Spark has been affected by its time in Gaia. It's not strictly the Maker's design anymore." ALL TRUE. "Because of the Spark's... mutation... the best chance for us to capture it, is to bring him to Earth and attempt an extraction there. It's technical." WILL YOU HELP US? "Can you help us?"

Silas is a little bewildered as he glances at the screen behind Wheeler. "But aren't..." he begins, then scratches his head. He's bright enough not to ask too many questions, and curious enough to wonder how this is going to play out. "I sometimes get to return to Earth once in a while. For fresh research material, you know. I don't know if I can take you along, but I can certainly try."

Wheeler nods. "I'm glad the Maker has shown you that compassion. Perhaps you would want to observe what it's like for me to go to Earth now that I've... uh... changed." Wheeler adopts a very human frown. "It probably won't be the same. If you don't mind, I'd like to get this over with. I predict that killing my prototype will not be pleasant."

In his mind, Wheeler can hear two Songs: The Song of the Maker, and the Song of Hugh. As they prepare to leave for Earth, Wheeler pictures a melody that harmonizes will with both. For his human side, the tune is simple: "Go home, Go home." The theme of the Alchemical song is more complex: "Trust me, this is for the best, this will acheive our goals." The unspecified refrain, of course, is Benford's escape. Wheeler discovers that, even during such a risky deception, the songs - both of them - bring him comfort, and an understanding of his place in the universe. _Now I understand what Hugh said. We put ourselves here._ After that, the melody is obvious: "For better or worse, this is what we are meant to do, and we accept it."

The maneuver starts out well, and Benford's sarcophagus is rolling down the hall towards the departure chamber. "Silas, I recall the Core Supervisor telling us that you are a musician. Something about, 'When there is no more room in our dreams, our dreams will walk the earth.' I wonder if you can help me with this particular composition." With the musician's help, the miles of corridors slide by. There seems to be no 'outside' in Autochtonia, and distances change as the complex alters to for efficiency. Nevertheless, there is no resistance as far as the armored door, beyond which is Hugh's gate.

The armored shutter slides aside, revealing two columns of armored drones, flanking the path to the pitch-black iris. As one, their heads turn to face the intruders, eyes glowing with a brilliant green light. They do not raise their weapons, but Wheeler feels their stare boring into him. he recites the melody, refined by himself and Silas. "This is the path we must walk," he states simply. Silas, Wheeler, and Benford continue down the path. The sentinels do not interfere; but neither do their eyes leave Wheeler.

The trio enters the iris, and all becomes dark.

Benford... remembers breathing. He's somewhere cold and dark. He remembers to breath again, and feels his heart beat. Or is that a pump? _Who am I?_ He tries to move his hands, and feels something... fluid. _I'm underwater!_ Benford panics, flails, and thrashes; something comes away from his face with a hissing noise, and suddenly he can taste air again...

With a splash, the Twilight flops out of a clear, glassy tube, naked and wet. He's left behind a breathing mask of some kind, and an unsettling mess of tubes slough away from his skin and retract into the vessel. He stumbles, comes upright, hands on his knees, and coughs some kind of viscous blue goo out of his lungs. The memories of Wheeler are confused, like one of the few times that he got drunk.

The building around him was probably a factory once. Nearby is a low table, improvised from cinder blocks and a piece of plywood. Its only contents are a towel, the clothes Benford wore to Walla Walla, and a stick pin. Benford dries, dresses quickly, and holds the pin in one hand.

"He knew that I would want to be sure," Benford states, to nobody in particular, and jabs himself deeply in a finger. The fluid that leaks out is red, and salty, and the wound hurts like hell. He doesn't care about the pain; there's work to be done. The scientist stumbles away, seeking a doorway. When he finds one, he smiles to himself. The city outside is unfamiliar, but he's just in time to see the last minute of the sun disappearing over the horizon.

Pay phones are damnably hard to find anymore, but Benford does eventually locate one, and notices the area code: 760. San Diego County. His allies are just a few hours away. Wheeler was quite thoughtful. He pauses with his hand on the phone, as it floods into him: He was Wheeler, Wheeler was him; his other self will always be a piece of the Unity. Junior, he confirms, is gone; or at least, he doesn't come when called. Benford's soul has literally been through the mill.

The scientist picks up the phone and dials anyway. The collect call to one of Marlene's drop boxes will be a hell of a surprise to his allies; he leaves his message and finds a place to wait. "I won't forget, Wheeler," he says aloud, with the reverence of a prayer. "And I won't fail. You found hope for me. For all our sakes, I shall not fail."

---

Wheeler stands in the presence of the Clock King. This man's dark visage is curled into a scowl of displeasure. He is one of the avatars of Autochthon, and he has unpleasant news. "Here is your mission now. It will be you who removes the spark from Newton Benford's body. You will be his final dissolution."

---

The reunion is, to say the least, eventful. Every one of the Celestials has been across the world and other worlds. They borrow Vasconcelas' living room for an extended conference. News and tall tales are exchanged as pizza boxes pile up, along with empty bottles of beer and stronger liquids.

"So you _both_ got to meet this Dave Bowman fellow?" asks Morgan, as the Celestials compare notes. "I'm jealous, in a way. I wish I could've met him. He seems like an interesting fella."

Benford says, "We've crossed paths with a lot of interesting people. It's been a wild ride. I'm more certain of that than my name, I feel like I've been five different people lately." The scientist twists the cap off another bottle of Corona. "So I guess the question is, now that we know what's going on, what do we do?"

"I think we need Ranapura," says Jet. "No matter what our next step is, it will prove useful." She turns to Morgan, "And honestly Livia was more fun. Another week with her and I think I'd understand everything." Or at least be so weird nobody could prove her wrong.

Benford says, "To get Ranapura, we need... how many, ten of us? We'll need to find more. And beyond that, I think we need to go on the offensive. The way to win here is to get Hugh born. The way to do that, is to kill Autochton." Benford takes a swig from the beer. "You know, that's damnably satisfying to say. Who would have thought that we could solve our problems with well-directed violence?"

"You just described every Full Moon," says Jet.

"Just because it's violence doesn't mean that it's necessarily force," Morgan points out. "There are other fronts on which this war will rage. Not to mention, there are still some who aren't yet convinced of the rightness of our cause." He nods in the direction of the Symbiogenesis Machine, which Dr. Mokembe is studying as part of his own, less combative agenda.

Benford says, "Yes. Mokembe. I'm eager to meet him... another Twilight." He grins. "That will tax the fabric of reality, I'm sure. And I think I'll look up Cam soon, as well. I want to see how he's doing with Hugh's song." His face turns serious again. "In all seriousness, this is going to get heavy soon. I think we should seriously discuss going public with this mess... or at least part of it."

"Again, no matter what the approach, Ranapura is out there, waiting for us to prove that we have our act together," says Jet. The Lunar looks thoughtful, struggling with words. "Benford, when you were.. out there, did you notice anything different? I mean essence, specifically."

"Funny you should mention that," says Morgan to Benford, handing him a copy of the press release he'd prepared. "I'm still working out the details with Lexi on the samizdat end of it, but I'm already planning how to out the Celestials. And of course the Assembled into the bargain."

"That will make it easier to find allies," Benford mentions. "And as to essence... well... it seems that there's at least five levels to it, like quantum states. We were able to Exalt when the threshold crossed from zero to one; or perhaps it crossed because we Exalted. In any case, the background level is going up. It can't be stopped. Eventually, within a matter of months, it will reach the second state. Second-circle Charms will be available to us; but... the world is going to get wierder. We probably need to get 'outed' sooner than later."

Charity sneaks a quick look at the press release. "So I'm gonna get on a magazine cover now?" Still, some focus is required. "I was able to reach that second state. That was really why I started my journey into the unknown to begin with. I was curious if you had the chance to do so when you were.. you know." In a box? She isn't sure how to say it.

"You no longer need the Engine?" Benford's voice rises. "Now that's a hell of a thing. And... I don't know. I haven't tried." He puts the empty beer aside. "Junior is gone. What I had to do, to my Spark and my Avatar... it caused some damage." He's quiet for a moment. "Are we aspirating Essence?"

"No, not exactly that," says Charity. "It's not me or you that influence getting it back as far as I can tell. For that, we must wait, and who the hell knows what that will do to people when it happens. I just have a better control and understanding of my own potential, I guess. It's more like unlocking a door than turning on a faucet."

Benford says, "We might see more Dragon Blooded, like Schroeder and Ran. For that matter, how many Celestials do we know now?"

"Well, I brought a Lunar back with me," says Charity. "So I got us another one. He's nuts, of course, so just uh, don't leave him with any easily influenced women, if you get my drift. Apparently greater mastery of essence does not give you greater mastery of the contents of your pants."

"Right," says Morgan. "And we've only just started. When we go live, we will find more... but some will oppose us as well as assist us. If nothing else, at least one Solar is still working actively with the Assembled."

"We should really figure out how many people we're short," says Charity.

Benford says, "Wait... with the Assembled... which Solar? And where?"

Morgan explains about the Solar that the African Sidereals mentioned to him. "I haven't had time to investigate what he's up to, or even who he is. But chances are we'll have to put a stop to him." He glances toward Jaguar's pen. "I wonder if he, too, abused the Engine..."

Benford says, "Well. Let's make some decisions here." The scientist leans forward. "One: let's get the press release out, and invite qualified persons to a meeting of the Deliberative. Two: If enough show up, we can summon Ranapura. If not, we can still at least take inventory; I gather that Ranapura is accessible by physical means. And even motal men have been that far before." Benford grins evilly. "Three: Surely our enemies will attend as well; and perhaps we will learn something from that."

Morgan shakes his head. "I still can't believe you went to the Assembled, Benford. Even for a while. That's more than I'd have dared to do at the time."

"It was brave. And stupid," notes the Lunar. "I have a lot of catching up to do, just to figure out what's going on," says Charity. "And I want to understand what our victory conditions are at this point. The enemy isn't very clear, the situation is tenuous and uncertain, and it's giving me something of a headache. I'm counting on Ranapura to provide a few answers. Of course having a big group of us together is a bonus all in itself.""

Benford's grin disappears. "It was a stupid, foolhardy thing to do. I owe you all an apology. It's not my call to judge whether the information gained is worth what it cost us. I just want to make the most of it." He shrugs. "For the future."

Benford says, "I can tell you one part of the victory: Get Hugh Born. That means that either Gaia or Autochton has to die. Under the circumstances? Well. I like it better here."

"Benford, you don't owe us an apology. We're Celestials, hand-picked for our unique stupidities," says Charity.

Morgan nods, putting a hand on Benford's shoulder. "You took a great risk, and made a valiant effort. Whether that risk made sense at the time... you can't deny that in retrospect, we've learned exactly what we need to do. And why."

"Besides," notes Charity, as she reaches down to run her fingers through Laura's hair as the young girl sleeps, "What's at stake justifies any risk, don't you think?"

Benford says, "It's our whole world. It's Creation, too, when you come to that. And... well. I don't want us to always live in a snow-globe. So... shall we get on with it? Get the locals together, prep the publicity, and let it escape?"

Morgan nods. "We'll do just that. And yes, we're not just fighting for friends and family. We're fighting for humanity, for Gaia... and for our salvation."

Charity smiles and for a moment says nothing. She watches Laura sleeping and then raises her eyes, "I'm fighting for the people I love. The people who have believed in my potential to do good things despite the past. I will go on with you, and defend you from your enemies until we have none left."
