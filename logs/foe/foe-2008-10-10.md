# Fall of Eden 2008-10-10

There are more people in the auditorium now than there were in the morning. Some news agencies that had originally declined to attend have now rushed in film crews. The air conditioners labor to keep up, as if they can sense the charged atmosphere and try to cool tempers along with the air.

The lights dim, and the large projection TV winks on to display a Powerpoint slide, simple white capitals on a blue background. The title is "Three Important Questions: How, Why, and What Now." A smaller caption reads: "(With answers.)" Benford takes the stage. As predicted, there is no applause; nobody wants a delay.

"My associates have graciously granted me the opportunity to conclude these proceedings," Benford begins. "This is a difficult subject to explain concisely. However, I shall try to remain grounded in concepts accessible to laymen." He absently taps a button on a remote control and the monitor dissolves to the next slide: 'How?'

"When it comes to the true nature of our world, we have two conflicting bodies of evidence before us. The first is the rational, impartial model of cosmology that scientists have built over centuries." The screen dissolves to a looping animation: a grand explosion; stars condense out of the primordial dust, light up, and themselves die violently; new stars and planets condense out of the remnants of old stars; and so on. A scrolling marquee shows accompanying scientific laws, including Maxwell's Equations, Hubbel's Law, Newton's Kinematics, and many more.

"In this model," Benford continues, "the universe is billions of years old, and largely empty. The most common substance is hydrogen - be it interstellar dust or the stuff of live stars - and man exists in a thin skin around a rocky ball that orbits a middle-aged star. We come to be here by a combination of physical laws that neither prohibit nor promote such sanctuaries for intelligent life; we simply live where we've found it possible to live."

The animation ends with a satellite view of the Earth, centered on Tijuana. It is still day, just barely, on half the North American continent; in the other half, the lights of cities pick out familiar coastlines like a swarm of redolent fireflies. A moment later, a bright green ring surrounds Tijuana, with the caption, "(you are here)". The audience emits a mild chuckle, as Benford had hoped; they will understand this more easily if they are relaxed.

"Recently, we have been presented with evidence that our theory is... incomplete." The screen switches to a video playback of Charity's demonstrations from earlier that day, with audio muted. "This evidence is both incredible, and quite irrefutable. Beings have presented themselves to us and claimed to be Gods. Others have shown by word and deed to be angels, or demons, or simply and utterly alien." A quick series of slides goes by, showing scans of Alchemical augmentations found in the wreckage of the battle at the power plant.

"If we're to believe this story, then the Earth was evolved as a home for refugees from another world, the Moon is a Goddess, and the near planets are really the Fates of myth. The Earth still goes around the Sun, but that's alright, because the Sun is the physical manifestation of Helios, God of Energy and Heroism." The named celestial bodies are shown in split screen with classical renderings of the similarly-named Gods. "Better than that, the Earth we stand upon is a living being of titanic power, and her name is Gaia. And lately she's been rather 'pissed off' at we Exalted for making a mess of her serene, secular refuge."

Benford asks, "Which of these are we to believe?" The screen splits horizontally; the top half loops the Big Bang animation; the bottom half loops a series of artists' renditions of the Gods and Primordials, intermixed with the more sanitary photographs of the Deliberative's adventures. "Is our universe saturated with divine beings? Is the fossil radiation of distant stars an illusion painted on a cosmic-scale canvas in order to deceive us? Or is the 'divine invasion' itself some form of grand intrusion into our formerly peaceful and diminishingly small habitat?"

Benford taps a control and the screen dims to a grey haze. "Even the most strident believer in any god depends on the Sun coming up in the morning, on rain falling down instead of up, and any of a million other assumptions that are as important to humanity as food, water, and air. We can see that these things have happened before, and know what we have to do to eat, drink, and breathe. Sometimes this knowledge is shrouded in myth or enshrined in scripture. Sometimes it comes from Arxiv or the New England Journal of Medicine. We do not always get it right, but we can refine our theories to fit new observations... if we survive to learn from our mistakes."

"Formally speaking, the fundamental requisites of an anthropic universe are strong causality and weak induction. More simply, that means that we survive because we can form hypotheses and theories based on our observations. We cannot ever know everything, but fortunately, we do not need to.

"This is important: the very fact of our survival indicates a universe where rationality can operate and provide useful results. Logicians warn us against the 'false paradox', and it would be a fatal mistake to see the current crisis as a choice between Religion and Science.

"So what, then, does Science have to say about the current crisis? Well, let's see how much of cosmology we can salvage." Benford taps the remote control and the screen comes to life again. "The answer is: nearly everything. Causes still preceed effects. The planets still describe elliptical orbits, per Kepler." Benford juggles the remote from one hand to the other. "Objects still fall in parabolas, per Newton." The screen returns to the satellite picture; the terminator has advanced a few minutes westward. "GPS still works, showing us that the speed of light has not changed, and still seems to be the hard limit, per Einstein."

Benford picks up a laser pointer and shines it on the precise point on the screen where Tijuana lies. "And this little gadget, along with your cameras, mobile phones, and computers, are all evidence that a good chunk of quantum physics is still viable." The green ring re-appears around Tijuana, with the caption, "(To whit: You are still here.)"

"It's worth pointing out that, even if some of these experiments gave different results, we could still use science to try to induce the new laws of this universe. In the last few years, my colleagues and I have observed that our world is still much as it was. It only varies because of literally heroic circumstances. So one might ask if we can fit the current phenomena into existing theory? Well. It turns out that our old model of cosmology does provide a possible answer, and we need only discard one cherished assumption about our place in the universe.

The screen dissolves to a simple diagram with two separate horizontal bands, one green and one blue. A small, spinning globe moves left to right along the green band, and a disc-shaped map of Creation moves the same way along the blue band. "We've always presumed that we live in a closed, consistent, and homogeneous universe. We make that assumption because modern physics gave us no reason to believe that our neighborhood of spacetime is in some way distinct from the rest of the universe. Any other universes are mere hypothetical flights of fancy... fairy tales."

On the monitor, the horizontal bands scroll towards the left, exposing a segment where the two overlap, producing a blue-green highlight. The markers for Earth and Creation continue right towards the highlight. "The model, however, does not rule out certain bizzare local phenomena - incursions of one universe into another. Those worlds need not even have the same physical laws." Creation and Earth enter the overlap, and the animation pauses.

"That, then, is our 'how'. From the perspective of Eden, the Earth is some kind of Essence-impoverished joke, where damaged souls go to live boring lives. From the perspective of Earth, the Gods and their ilk have just dropped into our back yard and closed us off from the billions of stars in the sky.

"As I once wrote in 'Rings of Light', willpower and gravity have something in common: they force objects in their potential well to follow certain trajectories, and they bend spacetime. Some of these beings are powerful enough to will themselves into existence - they can ignore causality when it suits them.

"This is also important: we're in a situation where our world has multiple possible futures and also multiple possible histories. What we do could literally rewrite the past." A murmur passes through the crowd; Benford pauses to let the idea sink in.

"Exaltation grants humans the ability to perceive and manipulate reality at the Essential level. We cannot easily describe that reality and have no instruments that will allow others to participate in it. As a scientist I eschew recourse to privileged frames of reference. Unfortunately, whether I like it or not, the world is running blind. We must be your eyes.

"And that brings us to 'Why'. Our overriding reason is that we need humanity to understand that the outcome of this situation is completely in their hands. We seek allies, both conventional and Exalted. In return, we shall provide a framework upon which the world may build their response."

Benford taps his remote again, and a web site appears on the projector. A small cartoon blackbird sits unobtrusively in a corner of the display. "Our communications system is called 'Raven'. It is a knowledge base and clearing house for public discussion of Essence phenomena." He taps through a short sequence on the keypad, showing a running transcript of his own speech. "The software is a free download, and will run on most popular computers and mobile phones. A full description of the system is included in the press packets we've left for you at the rear of the hall."

"We have scheduled our next gathering for December 21st, 2008. We sincerely hope that many other Exalted will choose to join us here at that time; and of course, our present distinguished guests are invited to attend as well.

Benford walks over to a podium and sets down his remote control. The screen shuts off, leaving only Benford on the stage, bathed in a single spotlight. His voice softens, becoming more personal and sympathetic. "That's the end of the script. But you might ask, what good does it do, to keep going to work and to school, when angels and demons walk among us? Does this change everything?

"Well." The scientist smiles faintly. "I can say this. Those simple, human moments are the most precious things of any world. If life is the gift of the cosmos to man, then humane virtue is man's gift in return. And when the need for heroes has passed and Exaltation is again just a legend, that virtue will still be here.

"Thank you for your attention; we shall see you again."

That speech, delivered by Benford before he left to devote his attentions to Jaguar Hombre, has simply capped a day of speculation, revelation and readjustment. The effect of it, amplified by the media available to modern civilized peoples, spreads across the globe like a golden wave of water.

Congress' deliberation schedule is suspended. Bills up for consideration are put on hold. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, announces a special session. A hastily-drafted series of bills are put forward in the late afternoon; the morning is reserved for wide-eyed, coffee-chugging interns and lobbyists to collide with each other in the halls.

The proposed legislation doesn't fundamentally change the legal landscape; the bills that are coming out are primarily the result of uncertainty and deliberation. An example is "A proposal that the United States Congress acknowledge the role of the Christian religion in the formation of the United States of America". Others slither across the docket, such as a Sense of the Senate resolution that reads "At this time, the United States Senate wishes to affirm the wisdom of the Founding Fathers in advancing and ratifying the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, specifically the notion that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion".

Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas takes the floor, making an interesting interpretation: in his view, the Establishment Clause implicitly forbids any god or demigod from holding high office in America.

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of Iran, makes a public appearance, denouncing the "American defiance of the self-evident truth of Islam", and that any credence given to the "recent satanic revelations in Mexico" are a violation of _tahwid_ - the belief that there is only one God.

President Felipe Calderon of Mexico has made a point of appearing in Tijuana, and his entourage has managed to finagle photos with just about every Celestial the townsfolk are aware of.

Experimentation around the world verifies something the Solars have said, too: it's not possible to create a replica of the Caste Mark. For that matter, it's not possible to create something that would be confused for a valid Caste Mark.

In Japan, the man called Tokugo takes this opportunity to make an announcement: he, a Solar, will become the Emperor of Japan. As the clearest claimant to descent from Amaterasu - the Japanese sun-goddess - it is his right. A long chain of political events begins on the tiny island nation, and Tokugo's latest letter to Jet lists the names of those politicians and figures who he predicts will ritually end their lives as a part of his program of rulership.

Charity finds the letter of Tokugo interesting, and replies in cipher offering assistance. A few days later she finds that she is more busy than she could have possibly imagined. As the defacto security exalt she finds herself swamped with requests for interviews and nothing shy of an army of interested onlookers. The borders are swiftly swamped and entry to Tijuana is swiftly in need of limitations. The full moon finds herself quite comfortable in this new role as both pleasant host and guard of the gate. Greater ties to the federal government of Mexico are clearly needed, and swiftly pursued. This is a great boost for the Mexican tourist economy, as Charity sees it.

Media passes are checked. Most are follow-ups from the various 24-hour news sources. CNN, CSPAN, Fox News, etc. They are easily checked and with negotiation given a building to use for their stay, which seems like it won't be ending soon. Security guards are attached not to limit access, but to allow for easier access. At least to Charity. The other exalts require appointments.

Charity's little demo of strength has drawn in a few interested body builders who of all things send her a request to help them become like her. After a brief bemused annoyance Charity sees the possible use of talking to them and sends a reply and slots some time. She needs more people, and while she can't assure them access to celestial power she can see if they are worth training and adding to security ranks.

Tourists seem to be forgetting about the natural beauty of Mexico and focusing on the every day activities of the supposed Angels of Tijuana. The title was carefully crafted by the exalts. Now more than ever it is important to go out and help common people deal with their problems. Charity arranges for the exalts to regularly happen into crowds and speak with them in a friendly way.

The relationship with Mexico's President is something Charity takes on personally, but she regularly calls upon the more skilled minds of Morgan and Newton to advise her in matters of law. She wants to help this man, getting a good feeling from the first meeting. In a short time the influx of interested parties is regulated, the doorway to expanding the local aid programs of Tijuana is opened, and the sovereignty of the Mexican people and their legal representatives is assured.

Responses from the world's trouble spots are muted. In places like South Ossetia and Iraq, people have enough trouble just getting through the day. News crews in rural Afghanistan find that few people people have seen the broadcast and rumors and misinterpretations are common.

Many muslims echo Ahmadinejad's sentiments, and find claims of divinity offensive, though some are more accepting, pointing out that prophets and heralds often come from strange and distant lands. The tenuous Iraqi government takes no official position, but rumors arise of altercations between powerful individuals and American troops. Nobody knows for sure if there's any truth to the tales, and many Iraqi civillians candidly wonder if the new nuclear plants will make the yankees leave them alone now.

And watching from their televisions in the Green Zone, in the villages and the deserts of Iraq, many of the soldiers who witnessed the miracle of Corporal Ivan Keeshan's one-man rescue of his platoon now understand just what it is they saw that day. A few whisper prayers as they watch the news, but most feel a grave uncertainty as to just where that prayer ought to be directed.

America is having an election, and the ballot is as divided as ever. The candidates were prepared for anything that they might throw at each other - but the claims of the Celestials are, literally, a bolt from the blue. The Republican candidates, McCain and Palin, have little to say on the issue. They cannot claim experience with something so totally new, and stick to pre-scripted platitudes about 'extraordinary individuals' and the importance of remaining calm in a crisis. Reading between the lines, one can hear a little fear and a lot of skepticism.

The first stop for Albert Gore, after leaving Tijuana, is Barack Obama's hotel in Richmond, Virginia, the night before a major rally. The next day, the Democratic candidates announce their intention to make the study of Exaltation a scientific priority for the NIH and the EPA. "If the Earth is alive," the release reads, "Then we owe her a seat at the bargaining table."

On a possibly related note, Charity receives an email from FBI Agent Schroeder. As part of Operation Gepetto, the government has made him point man on all things Essential. He's being sent to Tijuana to find out everything the Celestials know about the Assembled.

With the revelation of a new cosmology, the partisans of the existing cosmological debates are not slow to react; though as with the Muslim world, reactions are mixed and far from coherent. No two creationist organizations, for example, react in quite the same way - Answers in Genesis takes a similar tack to Ahmadinejad, condemning the Exalted revelation as contradicting the proofs of the Holy Bible, whereas the less explicitly Christian Discovery Institute eventually heralds the events in Tijuana as conclusive proof, at long last, that the Earth is the creation of an intelligent designer.

"As with Paul on the road to Damascus," writes Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute, "Andrew Morgan has turned away from his crusade against the truth. The scales have fallen from his eyes, and now he leads the way in demonstrating, at last, conclusive scientific proof of design." Morgan authorized no such statement on his behalf, but he reads it with amusement; for, ironically enough, they are, for once, not entirely wrong.

Meanwhile, the creationists' traditional enemies do not stand idle. Dr. P.Z. Myers, author of one of the most widely read science blogs on the Internet and staunch atheist, is quick to sample the varied exclamations of dismay or rejoicing from his opponents, claiming that the creationist movement is in "disarray"; the comments section on that post, however, is deluged with an impassioned and frequently profane argument between Pharyngula's regulars and a long series of posts claiming that P.Z. is ignoring "the most important story", namely that gods exist.

Richard Dawkins' own website, meanwhile, addresses that story head-on. He claims that his previous atheism, fully justified in the absence of evidence for divinity, has no problem in provisionally modifying itself now that the evidence has arrived. And he emphatically points out that all the religions of the world got the important details wrong, and that therefore religion is still inferior to the scientific method.

Another ScienceBlogger, Matthew Nisbet, who has made a name for himself in the promotion of the idea of "framing" science in a way that is palatable to the religious, has a rebuttal of his own for both Dawkins and Myers. His most recent post, "No Monopoly on Truth", points out that the world's religions may all have a grain of truth at their core; that Exalts may have walked the earth in times past and left religious movements in their wake. The fine details may have been effaced by time and the confusion of the more fallible mortals left behind, but there are still important cultural perspectives to be had in the world's religions.

CERN's response is typical of many voices in the scientific community. Doctor Aymar, Director General, releases a prepared statement the following day. 'CERN has some of the best minds in the world, and our staff is accustomed to encountering surprising results on the frontiers of physics. Our colleague, Doctor Benford, has had an extraordinary career and once again delivers extraordinary claims. We concur with his assessment: if it can be reproduced and measured, it can be explored as a science. As with the previous successes in industrial fusion, our staff would welcome any proposals for experiments that would reinforce his conclusions."

Later that day, Aymar sends Benford an email: "We mere mortals are not at blind here as you think. Maurer could use your help with a new instrument, since the LHC is stalled. Your peers also tell me, that if it isn't too terribly much to ask, if you might wait a few years this time before rewriting the Standard Model. Again."

---

Charity, Morgan, and Mokembe fill Benford in on all of this - once he wakes up. He's been plugged into Jaguar's Engine for almost a week, with only a few moments of (apparent) consciousness. The scientist pales when he checks his watch. "It's not the fatigue," he says. "It's leaving the world to fend for itself for that long. But I suppose that if they haven't dropped any bombs lately, we can call it a success."

In return, Benford briefs the others on the success of Jaguar Hombre's treatment. The big Lunar is sleeping now, and has a peaceful expression in his face - without the aid of narcotics.

"To make a long story short," Benford says, "the Engine interacts with human virtue as a fluid mechanism. Like any fluid dynamics problem, there can be eddies, overpressures, turbulence, delaminations... surprisingly sloppy work, for the Maker, but I suppose our sloppy human souls just aren't his preferred material. Anyway... it's possible to 'tune up' an Engine for a specific user. The upgrade manifests itself as a personality. Remember how the interfaces in the Engine didn't have names when we got them? Well... his does. He's called Benny."

Benford checks Jaguar's charts, finding a lot of notes in Mokembe's handwriting. The good doctor never gives up on a patient. While both Benford and Jaguar were technically unconscious, Newton remembers the experience vividly. "I think that part is important. Snake was always meant to interface with Charity, and is the only named interface we've encountered thus far. So I wonder if Eddie and Hypatia are, to abuse the metaphor, the beta releases to Morgan and myself. If so, I would be eager to get them patched." _Although I've been quite happy with your presence so far, my friend._

"Well, my version is something of a mix of good and bad," points out Charity. "Though I have found a way to move past some of the limitations with my little trip to the edges of insanity."

Benford nods. "It rather worked out for me, as well, although I had to leave a piece of myself behind. But... I wouldn't do it differently. We know so much more now. The old Maker seems to be fissioning into Hugh and what we now call Autochton. All of his operations here on Earth seem to be ignorant of anything he used to know about humanity or even biology; and yet all of his devices are distinctly biological, either in design or in operation." The scientist grins. "The irony there is, the Maker is using evolution to build his tools on Earth. Let the 'intelligent design' folks chew on that one for a while."

Morgan laughs. "I'll be happy to. I think, deep down, they may realize that they've become irrelevant. No one's going to be arguing against the _existence_ of an intelligent designer now, so they're either going to disappear or become yet another advocacy site for the Christian god. Which, I suspect, may not be a growth industry now."

"Evolution is an existant force, reality was made by the divine, I don't see why it should startle anyone at this point," says Charity.

"You lot have really done it," Dr. Mokembe observes from his readings of Jaguar Hombre. "Tomorrow people will be at your door asking 'what should we do, how should we act'? Even your Christian God had an answer for them. Do you?"

"I'll be interested to see what people have to say about that on Raven," says Morgan. "You're right, we didn't give them a Bible of Sol Invictus. We didn't have time."

"Who had a gun to your head saying to do a press conference?" the doctor asks, not bothering to hide his sarcasm.

Benford stretches while considering his response, and reflexively shudders when he thinks about getting stuck in a chair again. "Raven is here to help them find that answer for themselves. Do an end-run around some of the garbage that routinely prevents honest people from helping each other find peace on their own terms. I don't want to rule. I'd rather we lead by example, or failing that, be the insurers of last resort. Anyway... it hasn't been that bad so far, has it? No riots in the streets? No stock market crashes? No new wars?"

"Does it bother you so much that everyone has to deal with a bit more of the truth than they were aware of a few days ago?" asks Charity.

"It bothers _me_," replies Morgan. "I really would rather have had more preparation for the world before revealing the truth. But the gun to our head is not metaphorical, as you can see from the pockmarks in the walls outside. Dr. Mokembe disagrees with our war against the Assembled, but - or perhaps, _because_ - things like this press conference are a necessary part of that war."

"'Shock and Awe' was the phrase, I think," remarks the doctor.

"As a sentient being, people who think they can protect me just piss me off," says Charity. "Few people will wish that we had sheltered them from reality. Or, to use better words, they would not appreciate being blatantly decieved. They are in danger. A war is being fought on this planet. Those wearing blinders will be just as dead if they are caught in the middle, and will have no chance to defend themselves."

"It's more than that," Benford says gently. "I don't want to be at war. I wasn't comfortable with the Assembled shooting at us, but I was less comfortable with hiding the truth. Anyway. There's still work to do. We've already got the power plant. Raven is expanding. Morgan even knows some people that are working on a cure for AIDS. No mere disease can stand for long against a few Exalted. What would you have us do, Doctor Mokembe? I respect your dissent. I still think that we can and should work together."

"You've already shown that Exalted can leave Earth, right?" Mokembe says, gesturing at Charity. "She left. You left. It can be done. If the metal men are only here to fight you, then take your war elsewhere."

"We might be able to do that," Benford says quietly. "And given what we know about the Fetich, we may have to. I don't suppose it matters to you that they won't leave you alone."

"If I am part of the problem, then I would exile myself too," Mokembe answers defiantly. "Do not take me for a hypocrite. I made the choice of power, just as I am sure all of you did."

Benford shrugs. "I didn't mean that you're a hypocrite. Only that we're all of a type here. Have they told you about Ranapura? How we're supposed to be able to summon it if we get enough Celestials praying for it?"

Mokembe nods. "I've heard something of that."

Benford says, "We're hoping that sufficient Exalted arrive on the Solstice to do so. It's a flying city. It will make it possible for us to leave Earth... literally. I'll be honest; I don't think that is the right thing to do. The Maker finds our disorganized human world distasteful and I doubt he'll just leave it be; and out of Him, and Hugh, and Gaia, it seems that only two can survive. I don't know why that is either, but I know that I believe in Hugh. But if you really believe exile is the best option for us, then you'll have no better chance than when we're all assembled around a divinely-infused spacecraft."

Mokembe grunts, but finally nods his head. "You have me until that happens," he says at last.

"That spacecraft may also explain to us why we are so important to this place," says Charity. "Maybe some faith can be found there, even for those who seem to have lost it. That is worth something."
