# Fall of Eden 2008-10-24

Sunset in Tijuana is a beautiful time. The sunlight has turned the sky shades of red which no word adequately captures. Since the press conference things have been crazy, but Jet has demanded time to focus on training.

Fortunately, fate has been generous. Or perhaps cruel. Carbon is not a gentle teacher, and the subject Jet has chosen to master is a harsh one. She wishes to increase her physical prowess, both stamina and the mastery of athletics.

Despite the initial innuendos and rather lewd suggestions on how to achieve Jet's goals, Carbon is not without pride in his heritage, and that binds him to helping a 'pup'. It also makes his idea of training brutal in the extreme. He has used the past day to prepare an obstacle course for this, the second part of Jet's new training regiment. The first part was easy: wake at dawn, do not stop moving all day.

"This thing weighs a ton," notes Jet. Carbon's training also requires that clothing be enhanced with an extra one hundred pounds of weight, distributed carefully to challenge every motion.

"We can add more if you still have air in your lungs to waste on complaining," Carbon answers cheerfully. "But really, it's what you're getting rid of here that matters - not what you're taking on."

"I was getting too soft," replies Jet. "This press crap is nice enough on the surface, but it's not killing the enemy." She looks out at the obstacles, particularly interested in a two story stone building that remains amongst heaps of rubble and half broken structures. "ABC won't protect my family. If I have to shatter my spine to carry the world, I will learn to walk and fight without it."

Carbon gestures to the flotsam around him. "You will go to the center of this. In that building is something you treasure. You must protect it." He reaches down, picking up a brick, "If you aren't fast enough, if you aren't creative, I will let you know." He turns to Jet, "You cannot change shape. You cannot use essence."

Jet looks at the brick and then to the obstacles in her path. That moment of hesitation is enough to start the fun. "Are you deaf?" growls Carbon. "Move!" He flows through the space between himself and Jet like a raging torrent. He grabs her by the hair and spins, firing her into the ruins with humbling ease.

The flight is not gentle, but Jet is able to spin mid-air in time to meet the first wall with her shoulder. She punches through it and skids along the ground on an outstretched foot, leaving a trail like a comet. She hears the first brick flying at her before she sees it, and just in time to dart out of the way.

Now that she is in its midst, Jet realizes that this course was set up perfectly by Carbon. What looked random was master strategy for one with his aim. Reaching the center building requires her to face his aim constanly or to move out of his reach and takes her where she locate him, either. Still, she is a Full Moon, and this is exactly the kind of challenge she desired.

Carbon isn't staying still, and his senses are sharp beyond Jet's reckoning. Even as she silently darts from barrier to barrier he tracks her, his attacks first coming in the form of bricks launched at her with all the force of a cannon behind them. Just when the Full Moon thinks she's got a grasp of the difficulties and makes a little headway the game changes and a car plummets from above, exploding and showering dust and burning fuel all around.

And that is how the fire starts. Jet wasn't attentive enough earlier, and she was upwind from the site. The smell of fuel oil wasn't noticable to her, but its presence now is quite obvious. The inner circle around the structure is burning. She takes to the sky, leaping from crumbling wall to crumbling wall, all the while under fire from Carbon.

The vortex of flame is now twenty feet high and it surrounds the central building. For a moment Jet stops to think, and that is all it takes for Carbon to find her. This time the gloves are off entirely, and it's his fist that nearly takes her head off. Carbon's wrath knocks down sections of walls with ease, and the tumbling ruins don't seem to phase him, much less harm him.

He moves to cut off access to the flames, getting in Jet's way. She is wise enough to know she's never going to get through him, and she's not fool enough to think he'll tolerate her retreating from the challenge, either. She looks around quickly, remembering her purpose. A long, steel beam protruding nearby gives her inspiration.

With a deep growl the young Full Moon leaps to the side of an attack, barely avoiding the fists of her teacher. She wraps her hands around the beam and lifts it. Before she can take another step, Carbon is upon her. If anything, his attacks are even faster than before, and it's all Jet can do to not get pulverized by them.

Jet is able to predict the next attack, and it is just the opening she needs. She uses the beam like a shield, raising it in time for Carbon's fist to destroy it. At this critical moment Jet leaps into the impact, tilting the angle of impact enough to be flung skyward.

Having never experienced the power of an adult Lunar, Jet was not able to anticipate the flight. It carries her through the fire and into the building. Before her abrupt appearance in the second floor there were no windows on the south wall.

The building was apparently a shop, and this floor perhaps a large living space that has long stood gutted and useless. In the middle of it stands Ana, calmly waiting while all hell broke loose outside. Jet pushes herself quickly to her feet, stumbling as she speaks, "Ana! Wha-"

"Fool! Don't hesitate!" comes Carbon's imperious shout.

The advice is well given. Ominous creaks come from the building and even as Jet rushes across the room it begins to come down. She looks down at Ana with fire in her eyes. The young girl smiles back, impossibly calm.

The building's collapse was prepared in advance, and now that it is time for it to come down it does so like a controlled demolition. The roar of it's collapse is more than enough to draw any curious passersby out who might have missed the start of this little exercise. The rush of dust and air brings the flames to a final crescendo. The strange, hissing sound of intense flames are all that remains when the rubble settles.

The strength of Lunars is to endure all things, and that is what Jet must master. She remains buried for less than a minute. She can feel the touch of Ana's breath and hear the girl's beating heart. _How can she be so calm?_ wonders Jet silently. With a surge of strength Jet breaks free, rising from the drek with Ana held close, unscathed. Blood stains Jet's clothes and her usual grace of motion is absent as she carries Ana away from the center. She looks out into the night for her teacher, "I'm alive."

"Have you learned what you must give up yet?" Carbon's voice is audible before he himself can be seen.

Jet looks back at Carbon, "Doubt. No hesitation. No question. No second thoughts."

The Lunar grins broadly. "Yes. The world of illusion, the world your feelings build up from your heart, must never be mistaken for the world in which you act."

Jet nods, looking to Ana for a moment, then back to Carbon. "It seems she learned the lesson before I mastered it. I must learn more quickly. I must defend my pack."

"Know this as well," Carbon says, more seriously. "If you had doubted, she would have died."

Jet nods, not very surprised by this revelation. "Is this how Lunars were taught in Creation?" she asks.

"Her life was used to give meaning to yours," explains Carbon. "She now lives because you committed yourself to saving her. It's no different than hunting for food. You stalk your prey, you see the fear of death in its eyes, and yet you _do_ kill it, you _do_ eat it. Because you must. And that animal that you hunt in turn hunted others, saw death in their eyes, and chose to live regardless."

"In turn it is no different for her. She is your spiritual sustenance. And in turn it is no different for you either. Gaia knows the suffering and pain and tribulation her request will bring about. She looked at you and saw, but she asked anyway, because she had to. That is the way of things."

Jet nods, not sure what else there is to be said. "If you are willing, I would continue these lessons," she says at last. "I have much to learn."

"Very well. You should have started early. That you haven't is surprising.. unless you've concealed your motives from me more expertly than I thought." Carbon smiles. "How have you progressed in breeding your beastmen?"

"My what?" asks Jet. "Breeding beastmen?"

Carbon shakes his head. "What are they teaching you these days? Yes. Beastmen. The foot soldiers of the Solar armies are conscripted mortals, swayed by the Chosen of the Sun. _Your_ soldiers are those that you bring into the world through, erm.."

The Lunar eyes Ana. "Well. The love that dare not bark its name."

"Apparently through spreading my seed in one way or another," says Jet. "But how is this done?"

Carbon frowns. "You look like this and you don't know how it works?" he asks, sounding a little incredulous.

Jet can't help but grin a little, bemused by this topic. "So um, how? I shack up with somebody and what, throw a litter of warriors six weeks later?"

Carbon nods. "One of you as human, the other, well, not," he says at last. "That's really all there is to it. Your Exalted nature does the rest."

"So if I turn into a tiger and.." She looks at Ana and coughs. "This really isn't fit for the ears of the young anymore, is it? I think I get it. So you think this is something I should be doing?"

"Normally I'd talk how I wish, but she already has the signs of force used against her. I'm not wholly indelicate." Carbon shrugs. "Regardless, I think you get the idea. Now, what are you waiting for? Go occupy yourself."

"I'll consider it homework," replies Jet. She's not entirely sure if she's serious or not, but she does know it puts all sorts of inappropriate thoughts into her head that didn't really need a lot of prompting to begin with. As she walks away from Carbon she stops mid-stride. "I can turn into many animal forms. I have had dreams that I might take on other human forms. Is it possible to do that? And if so, does that mean I can also change.. uh. You know what I mean?"

"Everything is possible with enough mastery of Essence. I will teach you all of it - as you become more ready." Carbon grins reassuringly.

"Thank you," says Jet. "No doubt. No hesitation." She nods to herself, then walks away.

Benford was unconscious for a week while interfaced to Jaguar Hombre's Engine, and quite a lot has happened... including a stock market crash and related shennanigans from the US Presidential election. It leaves a foul taste in his mouth; everyone is blaming each other and nobody is seriously trying to fix it. There's some hints that European banks may be in trouble as well; more than likely they'll blame Wall Street for their problems. And that's nothing compared to the Alchemical threat. Agent Schroeder has been waiting patiently while Benford was suspended, and is looking for something that he can tell the Attorney General that won't get him sent to the funny farm.

"The way I see it," Benford begins, "we have two tasks. The first, in a nutshell, is to identify and destroy Autocthon's 'Fetich'. Eliminate the father, and the son may be born. That seems to be the grand plan behind Exaltation phenomena on Earth.

"Believe it or not, the second task is optional," he continues, "but it is one that I dearly want to pursue. I've been working on a plan... a vision for the future, I suppose, based on a kind of 'ecological reserve currency.' Apropos, I think, given what the markets are doing. It's not part of the Deliberative's design, but it's something the world sorely needs. We could ignore that need and deal with the invasion, but I think that we should not make a desert and call it peace.

Charity listens to Newton, though she's far from expert on these matters. "The first I grasp clearly enough. The second I do not understand. What do you mean by ecological reserve currency?"

Morgan scratches his head. "I don't know either, Charity," he remarks. "I know what all the words mean, but apart from 'carbon credits on steroids', I can hardly begin to guess what they mean when you put them together."

"Got it in one, Mister Morgan. Our money used to be based on silver and gold. Now they're based on... well, I guess we can call it reputation and optimism. Reputations rise and fall, and optimism is in short supply in many places. But when you think about it, I think that you'll agree, that we all have an interest in clean water and clean air. It isn't so much that the environment is too big to fail, as we all have a really serious interest in seeing that it does not.

"How does that work as a currency?" asks Charity. "A new variant of the gold standard, but with clean air and water?"

Benford says, "Something like that. The Kyoto Protocol was supposed to establish an exchange for 'carbon credits'. But America didn't go along with it, so nobody else is bothering either." The scientist can't hide his contempt. "Predictably stupid. Maybe now we can do better."

"More like EPA taking on the responsibility of the Federal Reserve," Morgan says, rubbing his chin and looking contemplative. "Hmm... Reputation is still vital. Sooner or later, someone has to _adjudicate_ the environmental harm or benefit of an action. And whoever or whatever is responsible, they will need to be nigh incorruptible. I shudder to imagine what the equivalent of the S&L fiasco of the 80's would look like with environmental credits."

"Humans are not incorruptible," replies Charity. "How do you plan to resolve the issue that evolution encourages all living things to seek advantages--fair or not?"

Benford says, "It's not going to be easy. If it's too obvious that we're bailing out the American economy, then Europe, Russia, and China will get peeved. If we just make it an agreement between the G8 countries then we're screwing over better than half of humanity - and a good chunk of the populace of the G8 as well, since wealth most benefits the wealthy. And we get to do it all while the Alchemicals are trying to kill us."

"And trying to circumvent our actions," notes Charity. "If you think it is worth doing, I will help you, of course." She looks to Morgan, clearly mulling over what he's said. "Humans are not beyond corruption," she muses quietly.

Morgan nods. "Of course not. We can certainly start the thing off in the right direction, though," he says, tapping his forehead. "Imagine if the director of the EPA were _sworn_ to expend his or her best effort to preserve the integrity of the environmental credit system, lest he incur the wrath of Heaven."

Charity nods slightly, clearly having something else in mind. "You assume of course that heaven will be watching. It clearly hasn't been so directly active in the past."

Benford grins. "Yes, that's the sort of thing that we can do to get it started." Then he frowns again. "But we shouldn't be too heavy-handed. This has to be humanity's victory, not the largess of its heroes. Humanity is the principle we want to promote. Humanity, as opposed to the Unity of the Alchemicals or the Divinity of the Celestials."

"From what I understand of Gaia's purpose, she would agree with you, Benford," says Charity. "Even so, I wonder if we might improve things here in some lasting way by altering the very rules that lead humanity to its ruin."

Benford says, "The Man - you know the one - he once told me that I should try to understand how the world got to this point, why after fifty centuries or relative peace we got the modern era and all its insanities. I think the rules have already changed. We can change them again."

"The question is, can we change them so that they remain stable _without_ the watching eyes of Heaven," says Morgan. "No - that's not the question. The question is, _how_."

Benford says, "We do what they did in the Primordial War. Fighting Fetich is tantamount to editing reality. I think we have an additional option, though. The more we do for Hugh - including acts of benevolence - the easier it will be for him to ascend to the throne."

"If we all agree to improving things, it opens a lot of doors," says Charity. "Including some that are just plain weird." She looks uncomfortable, but remembers her promise. She mutters, "No hesitation," under her breath. "As for leaving something behind that lasts without heavenly interference, I can do it. According to Carbon I can create something called beastmen, blending human and animal traits. It has me thinking.. what if we created a fingerprint of some being with traits we desired. We don't have time to grow them, but just make enough of it for me to learn to take its form... and, you know."

Benford looks uneasy. "I gather that in Creation they have a fairly low-tech way of accomplishing that aim. But what the hell. What kind of traits did you have in mind?

"It's strange, isn't it?" says Morgan. "We speak so casually of editing the very nature of reality, and yet the idea of mingling humans with animals is something even I find a little unsettling..."

"It sounds like part of your plan would benefit from an influence that is beyond certain character flaws, such as greed," says Charity. "If we can create physical traits, we might be able to tailor the building blocks of the soul itself." She looks at the ceiling and adds, "And maybe with help find a way to construct a specific culture that leads them to serve humans while not seeming like competition. A source that all people could come to trust."

"You know, a hundred years ago, genetic engineering would have seemed like fantasy," Benford mentions. "In that regard, what you're proposing doesn't sound so crazy. And I did want to see if we could promote environmental volunteerism as a meme complex, especially among Americans... hmm. Yes. I think there's something very workable here."

Charity can't help but look excited. "I am happy to help," she says quickly. She is also happy to torment Morgan. She flashes a cheshire-cat grin and teases, "I can hardly wait to start having kittens."

Morgan laughs. "If we're looking for virtues of cooperation and environmental responsibility, I don't know if cats are quite the right place to start. No offense," he says, smiling ruefully at Charity.

"Well, I think we'll probably need to incorporate some science in this," says Charity seriously. "And that's where Newton has to find some of his PhD cousins for us."

Benford seems to have lost control of his larynx, but eventually sputters, "I am at your service, miss."

"And apparently my womb is at the service of our cause," replies Charity. "Wow that sounded a lot less creepy in my head. Anyhow, add that to the list of things to do. What do we do in the meantime to make all of these things happen?"

Benford seems relieved to move on. "I'm going to try and find us a Fetich for you to use as a scratching-post. Beyond that, if we want to summon Ranapura, we need two more Solars, two more Lunars, and... some number of Sidereals. They play things so close to the chest... and we lost Barry... so I just hope they're still out there.

"I have a suspicion if we get the Solars and Lunars we need, the Sidereals will just pop out of thin air for us." Charity shrugs, "It's just the way they are. Drama queens."

"The Shadow Synod has already committed to assisting you on this," the Man announces abruptly.

"Well, that was quick," says Morgan.

Benford nearly jumps out of his seat. "_Quod era demonstratum._" He settles back in and asks, "Will that be enough?"

The Man counts off numbers on his fingers. "... Yeah."

"Damn, you guys are good," says Charity.

Benford says, "Alright, then. Two more Solars, two more Lunars, and we're set. I'll check Raven and see if we've got any leads. We'll need to ask the - well, let's call them Ranapura's Ambassadors - if there's any specific requirement. We may not need everyone in the same place or to pray at the same time; I want to double check that."

Morgan says, "They're good at what they do. And we're good at what _we_ do." He turns to the Man. "What about the idea of an environmental currency? How do you think that's likely to work out?"

"So, yeah. Whatever happens after December has pretty much fucked any Sidereal precognition." The Man doesn't seem too pleased about this, but he at least soldiers on with the bad news. "We're unreliable for predictions at the moment, don't let us tell you otherwise."

Benford resumes his previous look of astonishment. "Uh... that sounds bad. Crossing-the-streams bad."

"I guess that's what we'll have to live with," says Morgan. "But that means we're going to have our work cut out for us when the storm hits. And nothing but out own best judgment - and our not inconsiderable power - to weather it with."

"Bad or good, depends on your perspective." The Sidereal shrugs his shoulders in a loose gesture of apathy. "The First Great Prophecy predicted that everyone would get shit on pretty hard, and that failed. If we get our sight back and we see the world is doomed, is that really what you wanted?"

"Beyond that ability you still have your natural judgement," says Charity. "You know a great deal of things we don't. Will you analyze our plans? We understand the limitations of fate right now, but your minds are not diminished by this loss."

The Man nods. "Sure."

It's a task that only the Exalted would consider: within the space of a few days, lay out the blueprints for a century of civilization. The world is worried, but the same crises that trouble humanity, also open the door to a solution.

It begins with the Kyoto Protocol, the oft-maligned pollution control treaty from the 1990's. The Obama/Biden press release spoke of giving the Earth a seat at the bargaining table. Exaltation makes this act more than a metaphor. The protocol is expanded and improved to consider carbon credits, clean energy production capacity, and clean desalinization as negotiable commodities. In place of the faltering fiat currencies, the world will have a merging of economy and ecology.

The new currency calls for a new market in pollution prevention. Despite its huge carbon output, America is a relatively clean nation, with strong environmental laws and powerful industry. Rather than shipping toxic trash overseas for disposal, American businesses will be encouraged to import waste. Recycling will result in a net gain in environmental credits, and thousands of new jobs nationwide.

Europe might be displeased that the Euro will not displace the Dollar as the world's reserve currency. However, Europe is both developed and environmentally-conscious, with thousands of nuclear reactors - and, of course, CERN's expertise in nuclear power. As America won't go bankrupt, neither shall Europe be snubbed.

Russia and China have complementary problems. Russia's economy is depressed and industry is sluggish. China's economy, on the other hand, is booming, but at a horrible environmental cost, and with a thirst for energy that rivals America's. With its untapped natural resources, Russia will be a major stakeholder in the 'old economy' of minerals and fossil fuels, filling a niche partially vacated by America. China, on the other hand, badly needs pollution credits that America and Europe will have in abundance.

Economic and environmental angles are just the beginning. Charity's plan for a new breed of human calls for more than genetic engineering and selective breeding. In 2008, the division between rural and urban populations was almost exactly half and half, so it's appropriate to promote a symbiotic division of urban and rustic cultures. Cities will count the cost of their environmental footprint, and retreat inward and upward, replanting trees in their wake. The offspring of Charity's ideal will be the favored children of the two, balancing both movements.

Such a movement won't be built instantly. There will be a call for volunteers, co-ordinated by the Raven network. Where they go, they will plant new forests, build fusion reactors, water treatment plants, railroads, and schools. It could all be done in factories, by machines, but things built by hand have a humane quality, a spirit, that can't be mass-produced. The next generation will grow up working beside foreigners, and may come to see them as bringers of healing and prosperity. It may take a long time for some things to mend, but the old wounds will no longer fester.

The movement will be supplied by industries trading the seeds of prosperity - particularly power plants and Raven phones - for environmental credits. The Exalts will take personal responsibility for persuading as many captains of industry as possible, particularly in the US, UK, Russia, and Mexico. Some may see it as a net profit. Some simply need to see that a better world is possible for their children and grandchildren.

Many, of course, will be blinded by greed and xenophobia; and a few - hopefully a very few - will have a psychotic need to make their wealth from the suffering of others. Fortunately, the Exalted have a long history of dealing with such intractables. Early in the process, Morgan and Luther construct a diagram of who may be gently persuaded, who may be bound by Eclipse oaths, and who might have to suffer from sudden misfortune. The list is long... but perhaps not too long.

In the mortal world, such a plan takes a decade. It takes the Terran Deliberative a week. The computers have crunched gigabytes of data, and Marlene has written thousands of lines of code that miraculously runs on the first try. The bullpen at the power plant is ankle-deep in empty coffee cups.

Benford shows the printed document to Doctor Mokembe. "The script is written. Now we need to ask the world to follow. And I do mean ask. I take your caution and pessimism about our darker natures very seriously. Once the ball is rolling, the world can as well do without us. I want to know: does this meet with your approval?"

"I rather think you should ask the world whether it meets with its approval," the doctor answers, sighing. "But... since the patient is now open and surgery must either commence or abort... I will not object. I will support you."

Benford nods. "Thank you."

There's one more blessing to solicit. At the abandoned ranch outside of town, where both Esperanzita and Raven were 'born', the Circle gathers for a prayer. It's a prayer to Gaia, the living Earth herself.

While everyone else was busy planning the future, Charity spend much of her time at the ranch, preparing for what must be done. Prayers being such a critical part of Creation, she has been able to extract a fair amount of information from Carbon during the punishing practice sessions. She has brought precious metals and filled a wide iron bowl with oil, another with pure water, and a third with fresh soil, all of which has been worked by the Full Moon's own hands to reach a more pure state.

When the others arrive Charity guides them to sit in a perfect circle around the offerings. She takes from Benford a copy of all the plans the Circle has made and sets them on the altar. This being done, Charity begins the prayer in earnest by drawing a knife and spilling her essence in the form of blood around the altar. At this time she lights the oil and with the pull of a long cord opens a window, letting a cool breeze into the room.

Setting herself in the midst of the circle the Full Moon raises a living branch and dips it into the pure water. She uses this to cast water upon her friends and upon herself, as well. At last, she speaks, "Gaia, great mother of the Earth, we come to you seeking your wisdom. These bounties you have given us we have worked with our hands and offer to you." The symbol of her caste bursts to light upon her brow. "We offer to you our knowledge, wishing only to give your people, who we love dearly, better lives and greater awareness of your bounty."

"Before we finish what we have begun, we would have your blessing," says Charity. "If it pleases you, I also offer you my own children, who shall remain here as servants to your will and crusaders for your cause. Please heed our call."

The proffered blood begins to spread. To enlarge, in fact, into a pool. It flows over the ritual space, bubbling and swirling. And from it, two taloned hands rise up and grasp the edges. They pull something forth - a woman with raven-black hair and red eyes, whose fingers are sharp as steel knives and drip perpetually with blood. The green ivy that tightly coils around her slender body is covered with thorns, yet she does not bleed from the scratches. "I am the Vengeance of Nature," the woman murmurs. "Servant of Gaia. I answer your call."

Charity was given a warning that prayers done properly tend to get very results. Confronted by the reality of it leaves her momentarily off-balance, but she is able to recover quickly enough. She bows her head, "Your presence honors us, Vengeance of Nature. Are you here to share with us the will of Gaia?" As opposed to ripping a bunch of impudent exalts limb from limb.

"I am," the woman's husky voice says. "It is this. You ask a blessing for the righting of a great wrong which has been done. But you ask it for yourselves and your people. This is right and proper, but...."

"You presume to much if you think your civilization did not condemn itself to death by its actions. Gaia's will is that humans choke on their own pollution. That the world erase the necrotic taint it unleashed, and return to the purity of the elemental powers."

"With a few survivors having learnt their lesson, mankind would once again be allowed to flourish." Vengeance runs a blade-like fingertip across the floor. "Those incapable of survival should die. Those capable of it should thrive. That is Gaia's will. And so...."

"This is her pronouncement. She shall suffer this until the memory of your works have gone from the world. And then vengeance shall come, if mankind has not remembered the lesson."

"Gaia is wrathful, but she also shows us great mercy," replies Charity calmly. "For the wrongs they have done much blood must be spilt, far more than runs in my veins alone. I offer to Gaia my line for all time. They shall be servants to her will, guardians of her purity. They will not serve in hate, but their innocent blood will be spilled throughout endless time on Gaia's behalf, if she wishes it."

With that pronouncement, Vengeance splays her bloody fingers and plunges them into Charity's abdomen, faster than anything. There is no pain, no penetration, no wound. But nevertheless the Lunar can feel spiritual energy entering her body and coalescing within her. "So be it."

The woman looks up at Charity, and it is now apparent that she is blind. Or rather, would be blind if she were human. "Gaia loves you. Her vengeance has no memory, you see. It comes to the weak and the unprepared - _and it will always do so_. Mankind will suffer for forgetting you not because Gaia wishes them pain, but because they will have brought it upon themselves once more."

"Then it shall fall to my offering to remind them," replies Charity. She was not prepared for what just happened, but her voice stays calm. "Thank you for hearing our call. We will not fail Gaia."

"I shall teach them to trust in wind and waves and nuclear fire," Benford murmurs, feeling ice move in his guts. "Let my name fade into legend. I'd rather they remember how thin the habitable band can be."

The woman crawls back into her puddle of blood, disappearing from sight. As she vanishes, another pair of hands - younger, these, and normal - pull another figure out of the puddle. It's Hugh. He smiles. "Hey guys. Mom's real busy these days, sorry about that."

"And..." Benford gapes. "DAMN. This is like Freddy Kreuger followed by Teddy Ruxpin." He sits down heavily.

"Hugh!" Charity smiles, relieved at the new comer. She can't help but lean over and peer down at the puddle, curious about what she might see. "It's okay that Gaia is busy. She has honored us greatly enough as it is." Without even realizing it Charity is touching her stomach, just making sure it's all there. "So are you the Ghost of Christmas Present?"

Hugh looks hurt. "I heard the prayer too, you know," he mutters. "And I think I'm getting to the point where I can actually help out. What you're asking for is really ... um, more of my thing. Want to give it a try?"

"I already gave my offspring to your mother. In perpetuity," admits Charity. "You'll have to ask the others if they have anything left to cover." She lets out a relaxed sigh. "Unless you have some suggestions on child bearing, since you're going through the process from the other end."

"Well, this is for your sake any case, I think," says Morgan. "I'm not entirely sure, but it seems to me that anything you can do to help, also helps you. If now is the time for you to take on your new responsibilities, I'm all for it."

Hugh grins, and turns to Benford, looking at the scientist and smiling. "You, who were at the end of your life, still dedicated your energies to the salvation of humanity. So... as long as that spark of scientific zeal endures, people will not forget you or what you accomplish." He gets another confused expression on his face, looks at his hands, and finally extends one in offer of a handshake.

Benford is confused, but he knows who to trust. "On the day I was born... well. 'For All Mankind.' That's what I do." he extends his hand to Hugh, finding the boy's grip reassuringly firm.

"Alright, mate," the youth says, grinning. And with that, he too slides down into the puddle of blood. Before the Celestials' eyes, it begins to fade away, evaporating into nothingness.

Charity sees Hugh vanish and lets out a far deeper, less steady sigh, settling rather roughly on her backside. "I think that went well. I understand Gaia now." She looks over to the camera, "Please tell me we got that. People need to see it, even if many of them won't believe it."
