The Exalts have put a lot of effort int the plan, christened as 'Project Hope' by Charity. At the end of the week, Benford finds himself with a few available hours. Therefore, the Twilight turns his attention to the larger war.

"Step one in making rabbit stew: first obtain a rabbit," Benford muses. "So how does one find a Fetich? I've got my own ties to Wheeler... and Cam to whomever. So let's start with introspection."

The scientist's need for answers has driven several breakthroughs already. Now that his memories of previous lives are unfettered by the gatekeeper of his lost avatar, Newton Benford recalls details of the First Age and even earlier. His mind goes back to a time when he was Yat, the unspeaking brute of a man whose intellect still outpaced his physical brawn. Called the Titan of Runes, he made several important discoveries that later proved significant in ending the original war.

The soul of a Primordial cannot easily be contained into a single thing. Accordingly, they were subdivided, with individual entities acting literally as part of their parent entity. Certain of these lesser souls, called Fetiches by the scholars of the First Age, actually had significant sympathetic ties to their parent. The demons of the Third Circle that comprised a given Primordial's collection of Fetiches could then be sought out and fought by an army of the Chosen. It was no more and no less than total war - physical, intellectual, and spiritual - against beings of surpassing power.

The weapons the Celestials used were their own wits, their cunning, their fantastic orichalcum and moonsilver weapons, and those tools of war given to them by Autochthon. They tracked down and outwitted their quarry, assembling strike forces to deal with the specific powers of the adversary. Much like Saint George hunting his Dragon, the Chosen fought with everything at their disposal.

Fetiches, like all demons, were creatures of spirit. They were naturally immaterial and invisible, but could materialize as easily as any other spirit. Regardless, they were not abstract concepts or deities - they were entities which could physically be found in some place.

Benford also recalls the story Jet told, about an audience with a book that contained answers to unasked questions - located in Autochthonia. Unless the Fetiches have business on Earth or in the Lands of Light, that is most likely where they will be found.

Consequently, the gateway to Autochthonia has become a strategic asset - the Chosen must hold it, and use it to cross through and attack their enemy.

Benford takes notes during the fugue of recall, notic=== Occult ===ing at the end that he's filled another notebook. "So we take the beachhead and press the attack. Very well. But where do they come from?" He rises and wanders around the locked basement workshop where the captured artifacts rest under lock and key: Hugh's Egg in a glass display case, the Symbiogenesis Chair, a locker shielding Jet's weapon, The Major. He stops in front of the Egg. "Hugh is one with the Gate. Seems I need a Wierdness Detector...."

What the Exalted need to identify the Fetiches of Autochthon is less clear. Something in sympathetic resonation with the Primordial will be a start, of course. Cam no longer qualifies - he was physically rebuilt by the 'old' Autochthon, and has truly been transformed. An actual Alchemical soul would be the best starting point. Benford understands the principle well enough from his time at CERN. Smash charged particles together, watch what sprays out, compute properties, theorize. In the same regard, subjecting an Alchemical soul to Essence manipulation can serve to identify 'lines of sympathy' that will eventually point at the souls of Autochthon.

Benford inspects the Symbiogenesis machine. "So we need an Alchemical. A current model." He locates the cube containing the backup of Doctor Engel. "I wonder if the chimera in me qualifies."

"No," Benford mutters. "It won't be that easy. We need the genuine article." He sighs. "I wish I'd paid more attention when I was there; but then, it wasn't really me, was it?"

Benford pulls two Raven phones out of a crate and programs them, one for Agent Schroeder and the other for Enrique, recalling The Man's oblique reference to an Alchemical nexus in Mexico City. "So let's ask what our countries can do for us." He leaves the workshop, bolting the doors behind him, and goes in search of the two policemen.

Ricky has something to report in return. Outside the city, dusty old schoolbuses are being driven to different points. A few of them seem to be converging on the graveyards that are traditionally festive gathering spots for Day of the Dead celebrations.

"Graveyards?" interjects Morgan, looking grim as his head jerks up quickly. "That's... that better not be Alchemicals, is all I can say. The biotechnology they use to make cyborgs can be used on dead bodies too. Not as effectively, but it's probably faster to make."

"And plenty more formerly livin' celebrants going to the festivities," Ricky points out.

Benford looks up from his phone, thumbs frozen in the middle of entering Ricky's authorization. "Oh, bloody hell. Is it Plan Nine from Autochtonia? You can't be serious."

When asked, Ricky estimates that it's been three hours since the militia first called it in, and he only recently heard about it.

Benford hands the Raven terminal to Ricky, then selects a macro on his own. "This sounds bad. We need to get ready. And we're going to need Diana, but I'd be shocked if she hasn't already heard."
