# Fall of Eden 2008-11-14

The Exalted managed to hold off one graveyard's attackers. But there are several other incursions. In all likelihood at least a few groups have reached the city by now.

Benford rubs his eyes. Though he's still powered by the Engine - practically glowing - the magnitude of the impending disaster is hard to imagine. There has never been a 'disease' this virulent. Over 1.5 million people live near Tijuana; the number of victims is going to be vast. They will be hunting Esperanzita. Evacuation is impossible. The only option is to find a cure.

Charity still holds Becca protectively in her arms. She draws in a deep breath. She can smell the stench of her enemies in the air. "I must leave Becca somewhere safe. I must attend to the hunt." The imposing visage of the Lunar in her war form turns to Benford, "Is it safe to smash them for now?"

Benford shakes his head. "The key is in the disc," he says, referring to the metallic implants in the victim's foreheads, a perversion of the image of a caste mark. "I need to study it while I'm at full power. But _they_ will be hunting Esperanzita. So I think I should stay here, and everyone else should get into town and guard our little goddess. As to the civil government..." he shakes his head. "They need to be warned. Keep the infected at bay with riot control techniques. Smash those disks where you can. We'll clean up the mess later... if there is a later."

"So smash the disks to keep them down, leave the cure to you to figure out," replies Charity. "I will leave Becca with you here." She moves closer to Benford, bending down to hand Becca into his arms. "I will stop them from destroying our city."

"I think I am needed in the city as well," adds Morgan. "We must mobilize the city militia, and I'm probably in the best position to keep people from panicking as the dead advance on them."

Benford gently takes the young woman in his arms, surprised that he's able to carry her so easily. Jet's feline battle-form towers over him... and suddenly his doubts dissolve. A statement of intention from his friends is as good as a promise from the Gods. "Let's do it, then. Leave me my tools. That bus will be my laboratory for tonight." He goes carries Becca to one of the bench seats, and then gets to work.

Charity's warform is not meant for driving. She leaves that task to Morgan. She leaps atop the van, the roof of it groaning in protest but holding. Her roar of challenge rocks the night air and she glares towards the city center, eager for the next battle to begin.

Seeing the zombies pass by makes Charity's blood boil. She knows if she tries to swat them like flies she'll have no luck at all. An idea strikes her quite suddenly. Her voice is more than powerful enough to carry to Morgan. Her instructions are simple. Contact the defense forces and the media, spread the word concerning the safe way to incapacitate the enemy without killing innocents.

Morgan is quick to put the word out. He calls out for status reports as he drives, and makes further calls on Raven to help direct the city's defenders where they are most needed. The important thing: outnumber the enemy by overwhelming odds, or else flee. "You need enough to get all the discs at once," he emphasizes. "The others will put them back on if they have a chance. If you don't have enough people, retreat before they get you. The important thing is, _don't panic_! Retreat in an orderly fashion, cover your routes of escape. Stay in touch with the others. Jet and I are on our way as fast as we can!"

The response is immediate. Tijuana has been galvanized by being the home of the new gods and the site of their advent; everyone in the city knows who Charity and Morgan are. Charity and Ricky's work with the local militia have supplemented a once-corrupt police force and forged them into a hybrid of law enforcement and private citizen.

Despite this, however, the city is chaotic. Charity, from her rooftop view, can see what happened: perhaps five or six of the buses simply plowed down the street and into populated buildings, disgorging their reanimated and possessed contents into apartment buildings, restaurants, and so on. The intent seems to be to get the attackers off the streets and in among the populace as rapidly as possible.

People are running out of buildings as Morgan and Charity pass by. Many are armed. Some are shooting, panicking in spite of hearing the warning - or perhaps many did not. Broken glass litters the street, threatening the integrity of the van's tires.

In a few places, fire has broken out. Morgan hears over the radio about a fire truck being dispatched. It occurs to him that some of these may be deliberately set - a way to attract first responders to a highly infectious site.

Overall, the attack shows a fair degree of tactical awareness and preparation. None of the assaults are concentrating themselves; they're deliberately dispersing, targeting a wide range of possible population centers.

That one little minivan becomes a roving command post, as Morgan collects the information about the attacks and plots them on a mental map of the city. If the enemy is dispersed... then his forces need to be concentrated. Enough people together in one place, actively defending themselves, and the zombies can't get close enough to infect anyone before being taken down. Accordingly, he begins to bark out orders to the militia. They are to call as many citizens as possible to themselves, rallying around landmarks. The young and elderly are not neglected either, for few would abandon their family to these technological terrors; he directs the able-bodied to collect the vulnerable so they can be best defended.

As he concentrates, Morgan can almost see the map of the city shimmer to life in a vision before his eyes. His caste mark glimmers with the intensity of his concentration, and he can visualize the city as a living, pulsing whole... with the invaders as a dark, spreading cancer and his valiant defenders as the white blood cells of the city's immune response. So strong is this vision that he begins to visualize movements even beyond the eyes and ears of his people, guessing where the zombies may be searching and directing the defense accordingly.

More than once, Morgan has had to swerve to dodge people running into the street, or hit the brakes to avoid running over a prone body. He almost swerves once again, but this time on a more positive note. Esperanzita is sitting in the passenger's seat. "You called?" she asks brightly.

The visualization is perfect, and the goddess seems to nod along as though she were aware of Morgan's thoughts. "Okay, I'll go there!" she calls brightly, vanishing again. Over the radio, a sudden burst of chatter follows. "Esperanzita's gone! She just vanished!" But that's okay - the Solar knows where she went. He knows where everybody should go.

The 'disease' has only one vector: contact with the head. It has no progression - once infected, one is likely to stay infected. Large concentrations of people actually hamper the cure, because it's so much faster to reinfect someone. Therefore, the place where people should go is... everywhere. Moving directly out of the city, in a direction based on their current location.

Of course, based on this the journalist knows exactly where Esperanzita will be, if she were an evacuee.

Now that he understands the disease's progression better, Morgan wastes no time giving new orders. The word goes out: Evacuate the city by the safest and fastest means possible. Anyone who doesn't try to leave is a zombie and can be dealt with by the Celestials. Morgan himself is now, as much as anything else, a chauffeur for Jet, taking the warrior tigress wherever the infected are the greatest threat to the people. The reporter-turned-community-organizer has a few more orders, too: Esperanzita's guard detail is brought up to date and sent on the move, to where Morgan can most quickly bring them aboard and take them to the new rallying point.

The Engine can protect Benford from the slave-discs, but the duration of the Engine effect varies with the local currents of essence. In other words, it can shut down at any time. An unbidden memory of his time as Wheeler runs through Benford's head, and he shudders to think what might happen if the discs should get a hold on him. He shakes it off; just one more reason not to waste any time.

Benford has already formed the beginnings of a hypothesis. Alchemical devices on Earth have so far been based on 'trans-tech' materials... advanced components, but still physically present and compatible with the mundane laws of physics. The most fundamental of physical laws concern the flow of energy. A corpse doesn't just get up and walk; it must be powered... powered by the disc. So, Benford seeks to find the power source, be it Essential or physical in nature.

As long as the Engine effect lasts, his best tool is his own Spark. He quickly binds his 'patients' with duct tape. It won't hold for long... but if it takes more than a few hours, Benford will know he's failed.

He hauls two of his smaller 'patients' inside the bus, placing them on opposite sides of the vehicle... far away from Becca's sleeping form. Between them he places the shattered remains of one of the infected corpses, forming a triangle. Benford himself, and an empty Symbiogenesis storage cube, form the fourth and fifth points on a pentagram.

Benford's experiments to cure Jaguar Hombre produced some curious devices... part MRI and part dowsing rod. No matter the origin; he plugs the detection gear into his laptop and dives into the signals, driven by their complexity and urgency... and something else.

Benford has never been given to excesses of emotion; but the mass horror of the day, perpetrated on innocent bystanders... he grinds his teeth. Somewhere, there's a power behind this evil. A power that Benford finds personally offensive.

He's going to follow it home. And then, by Helios, Hugh, and Gaia, he's going to kill it.

This device has been precisely targeted and fiendishly created. Everything rests on the special spiritual aura of the city of Tijuana, and the ambient Essence well that drives it - namely, Esperanzita.

Each of the infection discs powers itself from Tijuana's own Essence - taking in that power, catalyzing a reaction within the host's body. An effect similar to the Engine overwhelms the infected with a new directive, then channels the resulting Essence from their will, even sapping their physical tissues and organs for power.

There is an Essence reserve - not a true power supply, more like a battery - that's built in to manage the flow of Essence. Presumably the corpses were seeded with discs that came fully charged.

The good news is that this means the infection cannot spread much beyond Tijuana itself. Probably a deliberate safety measure, given the paranoid nature of the Alchemicals. The bad news is that enough infected will probably kill Esperanzita through the sheer force of Essence drain.

Benford growls at the laptop screen, but the data is undeniable. The discs do more than brainwash the victims; they'll eventually kill them. Anywhere Esperanzita goes, they'll follow. It's not just a city-killing weapon, it's a God-killing trap. "And to think we were as worried about atom bombs," Benford grunts. "Shit."

The symbiogenesis cube is still at hand; Benford's gauntleted hand strokes it. It, too, traps angels and demons. "Of course," Benford mutters, "a God-killing weapon could come in awfully handy when we go to face the Fetich. And such things were used at the dawn of time..." He screws his eyes shut, tapping into the flood of memories of the ancient Twilights, who built such things. At the same time, he begs his Engine to keep running. _Hypatia, I'm very close to something here. Stay with me for the trip down memory lane._

Past memories mingle with present ones; both are relevant. Tales of the Shadowlands in the First and Second Ages are there, as are some of Benford's brief talks with Saint Death. What power could so tie a device to the god of a city whose inhabitants venerate their dead? Necromancy. The Alchemicals have already demonstrated the ability to access the very souls of the reincarnated; Snake was only one of their possible experiments. And Benford realizes that the tie to the ancestors of the Mexicans here in Baja allowed the Alchemicals to tap into that primal layer of Essence. The choice of reanimated corpses was not merely a tactical attempt to incite terror.

Benford's armored shell flickers briefly, coming back to full strength as he startles. Hypatia senses his nervous state. _It's still with us for now,_ she says reassuringly. _Don't give up, Doctor._

"Better make the most of it, then." A quick glance out the windows shows the victims still pinned under the tree; the two before him snarl with unmitigated hatred. The corpse, thankfully, just sits there, his funerary garb battered and shredded and his slave disc cracked down the middle. And yet Benford knows that the artifacts of the Alchemicals do not give up their purpose so easily. While the power of the Engine remains, he reaches out to touch the cracked disc again, straining to hear the Song of the Maker-That-Is. _Brother machine. Every artifice, large and small, remembers its moment of Activation, when it is first put to its task. Show me your past. Show me how you were put to this purpose in this strange, Essence-starved world._

The impressions and experiences that Benford receive are faint indeed. But he realizes what little there is to be gleaned here. The discs were planted on the corpses well in advance - installed by tiny digging automata by Alchemical agents who approached the graveyards under stealth. They live only to reproduce, like a macroscopic metal bacterium, and the voice that calls to them and passes through them is of no consequence. But Benford now recognizes the voice. It is another of the songs of the neurocytes. And every so often, one of the infected will become a 'singer' to those around him. There is no single source to defeat, but splitting the infected into small enough groups and finding a way to create a new song may overwhelm their previous mission.

Benford says, "I thought it had to be something like that," Benford states. "Something this well planned, they wouldn't leave a simple necromantic machine lying in a graveyard for us to smash, or send a single vulnerable agent to control the operation. The power source is distributed, and so is the control. A mockery of biology. But even diseases have more harmony with the biosphere than this." He stands up and gathers his gear, picking up Becca in his arms.

The eyes of the captives follow him everywhere, with a look somewhere between hatred and disgust. "I'm sorry," Benford mutters. "I'm so sorry." He carries Becca out of the bus with him, knowing that he must find another vehicle for his next move.

Keyed up by his researches, Benford quickly becomes aware of the trajectory of the sniper's bullet. He's aware of the bullet's presence, in turn, as he ducks and dodges away without conscious intent. Someone is shooting at him from the perimeter of Tijuana.

The van plows past Esperanzita's former refuge. Carbon and Cam come sprinting out. Cam leaps onto one of the motorcycles parked out front - like sister, like brother - and tears after Morgan's van. Carbon simply throws himself down onto the street, metamorphosing into an enormous fanged cat easily as large as a touring motorcycle. In this form he bounds off after the van - and keeps pace.

Charity calls out to Cam and Carbon, "Are there any large groups of them anywhere? Is there any sign of something we can fight? Or are they just doing this whole thing guerilla style?"

"What's their plan for when she dies?" shouts Cam as he drives. "I mean,zombies aren't gonna kill us. They must have some big guns waiting in the wings!"

"Remember New York, Jet!" calls Morgan. "If Esperanzita is lost, the Assembled can manifest freely! They don't have to be waiting anywhere physical - they can be, I don't know, in the Lands of Light, waiting for their chance to invade!"

"I think it's time to go meet their big guns," growls Jet. "What do you think, Morgan? They might be anywhere, but I have a feeling they won't be so far away."

At that moment, Morgan's Raven phone rings, and the caller ID shows a picture of Newton Benford, forcing a grin for the camera.

The scientist squawks a short, dense summary of his investigations... finishing with the indignant declaration, "And now, someone is trying to snipe at me, from half a mile away! I'm pinned behind a damn tour bus in a field full of zombies!" The phone helpfully shows a map of the area, with a green dot over the building Benford describes.

"We're on it. Stay safe and keep 'em guessing!" Morgan turns the wheel and calls out the new destination, thumbing a button to forward the map to everyone else's Raven. "Follow me! We've got to get Benford out of this! He's got a plan!"

Benford seeya! "Thanks for a good game!"
