# Fall of Eden 2008-11-21

"Bonita, Bonita!" A mother wails for her little girl, caught in the press of people. Hordes of human beings are fleeting the city of Tijuana, moving toward the border that marks the spiritual transition from one danger to another. Atop one of the buildings, a man with a megaphone is bellowing into it, gesticulating wildly to amplify his shouted commands: "Get to the edge of town! Move out and spread out! The Solar Saints will protect you! Get to the edge of town!"

One of the infected citizens runs toward the crying woman, hands outstretched in a furious attempt to touch her forehead. A man interposes himself, cocking his fist and laying out the infected with a single powerful punch. "Ma'am, it's not safe here," he tells her. "Please, we'll find your child. Stay with the crowd and keep moving."

The fistfighter looks around, seeing others of his kind - men dressed in suits, connected with earpieces. "Cordon this area off!" he calls into his radio. The others in his field of vision nod as the order's received. They fan out, moving through the crowd, searching and battling and protecting with all their might.

The woman grabs hold of her rescuer's sleeve, pulling his attention back to her. "My daughter!" she wails. The man shakes his head. "Lady, we're working with the local cops and some kinda organized militia here. We're doing everything possible, I promise you. Now come on, let's get you to safety."

"We can't do anything!" she replies, still frantic and maddened by panic. "We can't get out, we can't--" And then she's met by a pair of calm eyes, a black face. A tall man, wearing a shirt and tie, sleeves rolled up, is looking back at her. "Yes we can," he tells her. Like a miracle, the tears begin to dry. The mother's face begins to lose its twisted, panic-stricken cast. Then the man turns, for a new wave of attackers has come. This time they are the dead - animated cadavers, three of them. The tall dark man frowns, flashing a brilliant golden sigil on his brow, and makes a lashing motion with one of his hands at the incoming dead. A wave of Essence sweeps out from him; the bodies collapse into ash, with just a hint of wailing on the wind. With that settled, he turns back to her and speaks again. "Yes we can."
