# Fall of Eden 2008-12-05

Racing through the streets of Tijuana, Charity looks from her vantage point atop the racing van. Spots of chaos are all about the area, zombies attacking, zombies lying disabled or destroyed, and general chaos. Keeping pace easily on the ground is Carbon, his eyes every bit as eager for the next battle as Charity's are. "Morgan, can't this crate move any faster?" bellows Charity.

"Not unless you want me to run people down," growls Morgan. "That's all we need, more corpses for the Assembled to raise. I'm doing the best I can." The strain of the day's events is beginning to tell on Morgan.

Meanwhile, Benford is pinned down behind the dilapidated tour bus where he was performing his experiment. The victims are still pinned under a tree, a hundred yards away. He pokes his head around the side of the bus and immediately draws it back, knowing that a bullet will follow. He's right; the projectile blasts through a corner of the bus and embeds itself in the ground. The scientist picks up the large-bore copper-jacketed slug, trying to identify the weapon. He's not immediately sure, but whatever it is, it's big. "Nuts."

Charity orders Morgan to stop the race short. "We're not going to barrel head-long into the firing line." Instead, she will direct him to stop several blocks away, giving her and Carbon a chance to stalk the enemy with their powerful senses.

A few shots are all it takes for the observant scientist to discern the trajectory and rough distance of the incoming fire. The sniper is moving around, but Benford remembers the terrain; based on the available cover, he's quietly confident he can predict the hilltop the shooter will strike from next.

Benford keys the mic on his Raven phone. "Jet, there's a hill, a quarter mile north of me. Here's a photo. Try there." Benford unslings Reason and chambers a round. "Time to join the hunt, little friend."

The location is relayed to Carbon and Morgan quietly, and then the hunt begins in earnest. For her part, Charity will try to make a difficult target, though with the glow of her anima around her the best she can do is try to use trees and vehicles as cover. The plan for her is simple enough: make sure that Newton doesn't take fire by getting the enemy focused on her, instead. As an added bonus, Carbon should have an easier time sneaking with the enemy focused on Charity.

Benford takes up a defensive position, crouched beside the bus near the unconscious Becca. If Jet can get him unpinned, he'll need a vehicle; otherwise, he keeps his eyes peeled for more zombies.

Morgan studies the terrain and finds a low hill with a small scrub-tree to use as cover. Two can play the sniping game, he figures - though he will have to be a very careful shot indeed.

Cam pulls up. Carbon, of course, charges past. He heads straight up the hill, roaring a challenge as he regains humanoid form.

In response, two figures appear at the top of the hill and start down toward the rampaging Lunar. One of them looks like a protean, ever-shifting conglomeration of steel balls, while the other is a rasping horror of sawblades and sharp edges grafted together and constantly spinning. Both are vaguely humanoid in size and shape.

Seeing the whole concept of stealth has evaded Carbon, Charity figures she might as well join him. Her roar of challenge echoes that of the elder Lunar as she races up the hill.

"Charity! Wait!" Cam calls after her. "It's time!"

Charity stops suddenly, looking back at her brother. "Time to see what we can do, then?" she asks.

Cam's face sinks into a flat, featureless surface. The rest of his body likewise loses its definition. He walks forward, acquiring a silvery light that shines from every seam and pore. And then he _cracks open_, revealing himself as a glittering shell into which Jet can easily fit. "This is what they re-built me to do," his voice calls. "Come. Let's fight together!"

Charity doesn't have time to doubt or hesitate. She simply pulls in a deep breath and jumps inside. Cam doesn't so much close in on her as he just flows around her in a shell of incredibly powerful moonsilver. Charity finds herself unhampered by the new skin as she again races forward, the Major held high in one hand, ready to shatter the mass of blades that is her nearest enemy.

Moonsilver tendrils leap from the armor's forearms, interfacing instantly with the Major's Alchemical components. Charity can feel the connections being made, feel her nerves extending literally into her weapon.

Charity finds herself going toe-to-toe with a creature that doesn't even need to strike her to draw blood. Her first contact with the creature is a momentous smash of moonsilver that sends sparks and bits of metal into the air, but also draws blood as a blade just barely gets by the formidible armor that protects the Full Moon.

For the first few seconds of combat Charity is given no clue exactly how her enemy attacks. If anything, it seems to turtle and rely completely on its own formidible defenses to do the damage on its behalf. An efficient approach, but one that is quickly abandoned when the vortex of blades realizes that the exchange is simply not one it can win. Its response comes in the form of a white hot blade firing out from somewhere inside and exploding in a shower of burning shrapnel.

Charity takes the brunt of that blast, but by luck is able to avoid the worst of it, showers of sparks flicking off the moonsilver that engulfs her almost wholly. She hammers at the enemy with the Major, crushing blades and smashing away whole sections of metal. Each bites back in return, but never deeply, always thwarted by Cam's protective form.

Feeling that the enemy is making this far too close for comfort, the tigress draws back, studying her foe for a moment. The assimiloid seems little more than a mishmash of sharp steel, but there is a source of its powerful attack, and it is that which Charity waits for. It is the slight feeling of growing heat that reveals the exact moment of attack, and the Major is stabbed forward with laserlike precision, essence guiding its exact angle to catch the exploding projectile before it can be launched outward.

The explosion inside the vortex rends the thing asunder, but it also draws its last blood from its enemy, sawing flesh and scalding the Full Moon with a final blast of molten metal.

For his part, Carbon battles an amalgam of steel balls, held together by some sort of electromagnetic force. The tangy scent of ozone and sharp discharges of electricity give its nature away. The big Lunar is fast and powerful, but he learns early that his strength doesn't really matter against an enemy who simply rolls away from his attacks and reforms. Consequently he alters his strategy.

Casually he snaps the branch from one of the lone trees on the hilltop, shredding it of leaves and twigs with a single motion of his hand. And then he begins playing a fierce form of baseball. As the assimiloid reaches out to strike, Carbon bats one of the spheres away with incredible power. His improvised bat can only handle a dozen or so such impacts, though, and soon he's left holding a battered mass of splinters.

Again the Lunar changes tactics, transforming his battle-plan just as easily as he transforms his body. His enemy's shape seems centered around a few key spheres. Without warning he thrusts his hands deep into the mass of electrified spheres, and his skin blisters and blackens for his trouble. But he withdraws a few of the steel balls. As the assimiloid begins wrapping tiself back around them, he _eats_ them - and then quickly adopts a raptor's winged form, and takes for the sky. The rest of the mass, unable to follow, begins rolling down the hill after him.

Deadly though those two opponents were, neither bore a gun - though from the look of it, either could probably shoot projectiles if needs must. Nevertheless, Morgan is certain there is a third foe, still taking aim at Benford. He palms his Raven and whispers to Benford, "Can you get him to take another shot? I need a fix."

Benford bites back a protest; it makes a crazy kind of sense, and after all, he's survived lethal head shots before. "Yeah, roger," he grunts into the radio, and charges across the field. He plots a zig-zagging course between gravestones, and marble monuments, seeking an abandoned vehicle, taking no time to consider the sickening crunches made by the unearthed corpses underfoot.

Whether the sniper is aware of the ruse or not, he takes the bait. Another half-dozen shots strike dangerously close to Benford. One shatters a limestone slab, another the cross crowning a family crypt. As Benford reaches the abandoned car, the sniper puts two rounds into it. One blasts the front tire to shreds, and the other pierces the hood with a sickening crunch. Benford thinks he can hear the engine block crack. "Shit," he groans. "Might have thought he'd do that."

"There," whispers Morgan triumphantly, seeing the movement up the hill. "You're outdoing yourself, Benford." One shot would've been hard to track, but this veritable outpouring of fire gives him as good a position as he could hope for. Carefully aiming his own Benford Special, his caste mark glitters on his brow as he calls on the power of his god to lend strength to his aim as he pulls the trigger.

The shooter, aware of Morgan for some reason, ducks away at the last minute. Morgan can recognize his face as he darts off down the hill, running at high speed away from the potent Solar. It's Newton Benford.

"Oh hell," says Morgan aloud. He thumbs his Raven again. "Benford! The sniper - he's your spitting image! What the hell?" he says, grabbing his rifle and making his way up the hill, warily eyeing Jet and Carbon's opponents.

Benford feels his blood run cold, and a feeling in the pit of his stomach like he's staring over the balcony of a tall building. He'd known about the piece of himself he'd left behind in Autocthonia, but he didn't anticipate the consequences... and he never imagined that his double would try to kill him. "Well. Why not? I'm a right bastard." He keys the phone. "It's Wheeler. They copied me when I was there. Guess he wants me dead." And then he's moving again, taking advantage of the lull Morgan bought him. He charges back to the bus. It's not fast, but he needs to cover the distance to the real fight as quickly as possible.

Benford pulls Becca inside the old tour bus, acutely aware several infected occupy the back row. He quickly subverts the ignition and puts the gas pedal to the floor. The terrain is rough, and the vehicle's engine isn't in the best shape, but it's the best he has. Wheeler's presence gives the matter a new urgency; he will certainly know something useful about the attack... and how to stop it. Benford doesn't expect him to give that information for free... he grinds his teeth as he grinds gears. It takes an agonizingly long two minutes to close the distance.

With Morgan leading the hunt, and Jet and Carbon both victorious - for the moment, perhaps - over their own adversaries, it doesn't take long to corner the shooter. It is indeed Newton Benford, or rather Wheeler. And as the Exalted gather close, he smiles. "You'll get no secrets from me, other than that I designed this device. This body is just a shell." With that he collapses into a pile of spare parts.

Morgan runs up to a halt. "Damn!" He picks up a loose cog; without the spirit of Wheeler, it is just a toothed disc of metal. "We need to find a way to be able to follow them," he says.

Benford arrives a minute later and inspects the pile of debris. The scientist scowls. "If he made it, I can unmake it. Let's get back to the lab, quick as we can. I need haemotology gear and a signal processor. And you lot need to get out and weed out the original corpses, and get the other victims spread out."

The activity is interrupted as the Exalted see a pair of black SUVs pull up nearby. Several men in suits, with radio earpieces pile out of the SUVs, forming an armed cordon with pistols and shotguns. The man they are protecting, the Democratic nominee for President of America, slides out after. "Hey!" he calls. "They told me you guys were up here. Some guy said I should find you and tell you I could help."

"Holy shit," is Charity's concise response. One might think that throwing cars, ripping trees from the ground, and meeting a goddess would making a meeting like this kind of old hat, but somehow it doesn't. "What on earth are you doing here?" A moment pause for the title, "Senator."

"I uh, I came down to pay you guys a visit," Mr. Obama replies. He points at his forehead, where the shimmering golden mark of the Zenith now appears. "Ran into some unpleasant characters. So I got signed up to help you all out. Now.. what can I do to help?"

Morgan manages to find his tongue. "I, uh, suppose I shouldn't be surprised," he says. "We're about to try something to cure this infection. Benford says we need to find the raised corpses, since they're the source of the infection."

Obama nods. "I've seen what I can do already, but I can feel it taking something out of me. That's--" He's interrupted by a voice crackling over the Raven handsets. It's the Man. "I'm sending the twins," the Sidereal says. "This is what they were trained for. It's too bad, but we'll save the city. And you guys will have all the Essence you need."

"Excuse me, what?" demands Charity. "What is too bad?" She does not like the sound of this one bit.

Benford takes in the mass of heavily armed men, the gigantic black vehicles, and the surprise appearance of a Zenith-caste Senator. "Generally speaking... you can get elected," he quipes. "But for right now?" The scientist mops his forehead. "I'm sorry. I need to get to work. Fill him in." Benford hands his Raven handset over to the politician. "Any other day, consider me at your disposal!" he shouts as he runs inside, pushing through the doors towards the biopsy lab.

As Benford moves into his lab, a jeep pulls up. The Ivanova sisters climb out, along with Saint Death. "That man has a plan," the Abyssal mutters darkly. "I don't like it. But it'll get rid of the undead, absolutely. Morgan, call Esperanzita out here."

"What is his plan?" demands Charity.

Natasha looks at her sister, and looks at Charity. "It'll be fine," she says, and smiles. "You look great, by the way. Are you actually wearing that schmuck?"

"Thanks, and yes. Now answer the damn question or I will be forced to get the answer out of someone," replies Charity.

"," Morgan says in Old Realm. ""

Carbon lays a hand on Charity's arm. "I feel.. these two will need you here soon," he murmurs, leaning close. "_I_ will go find this man and get your answers from him. Leave this to me."

Charity nods to Carbon, "Leave him in one piece, if it is convenient. He's of a kind that is more interested in secrecy than honesty and my patience is wearing thin."

As for Esperanzita, she's soon at Morgan's elbow, smiling up at him. Diana looks down at the girl, then at Morgan, eyes haggard. "You're going to pray to her, but you're going to invoke the gods of the abyss. They have names, and... well. I don't know how to do this prayer, just telling you what he told me. But I'll tell you what you need to know..." She leans forward, whispering eighteen syllables into Morgan's ear that make him turn a tad pale. "The prayer? You gotta figure that out. The idea is to call the dead to Esperanzita. Only the dead - not the living. Then we zap 'em as they come."

Morgan nods grimly. "Esperanzita... prepare yourself. I doubt this will be pleasant for you." He settles down into a lotus position and begins to speak. The language is Old Realm, as before, but as he speaks, anyone who dares to listen to his words blanches just as he did - perhaps even more, since he is not only speaking the names, but calling them, drawing their attention. The Lord of Decay... She Who Walks the Dark River... The Silent One... phrases like these are the best translations into English of the names he invokes, but in Old Realm those are not mere names, but Names. And Morgan's very Essence is being drawn into them.

The dark wave is almost palpable. The other Exalted can feel what Morgan has called out, and even Barack shivers. "That's... that's not right," is all he can muster. But the effect is undeniable. In a ocuple of minutes, every walking cadaver in Tijuana should be coming. The Exalted have that much time to prepare themselves.

The Ivanova sisters have begun performing warm-up exercises. A voice comes over the Raven handset as well. It's Carbon. "--these boxes work? Charity, if you can speak over this god's talons, respond."

"I can hear you, Carbon," replies Charity. "What did you find? From what I feel here all hell is coming our way."

"The creatures are moving. Your action was successful. This man is uncooperative. I left him unconscious. But I understand. Your dead friends are using a very rare Essence technique. They are gambling the Essence that composes their own bodies against the undead. If they have enough left when the dead fall, they will live."

"Thank you Carbon," replies Charity. "Do you know if there is any way I can help them succeed?" The Lunar's eyes move first to the twins, and then to the goddess they would die to save.

"Fight well."

"Then for the first time, I shall unleash the full power of the Beast within."

Charity steps away from the others, glaring out at the darkness. She leans down, drawing her silver claws through the earth in a long arc, then steps past it. "Do not stray past this line."

"Just destroying the bodies won't be enough," Diana says. "They must be put to rest. Their souls have to move on. Whatever priest you managed to.." The journalist looks over, only now recognizing the Zenith among them. "Well shit. That man really doesn't screw around does he. Went right to the top. Alright, good. You--" She points a finger at Obama. "You exorcise everything. _Everything_." To which the Senator nods.

"This is going to get messy. I will pile the bodies on top of this line," says Charity. "At least, most of the bodies." She lowers herself to her knees, murmuring her own prayer and offering the unfettered wrath she is about to unleash to her Goddess.

The dead come. Not in a slow march, but in a ravenously hungry horde. The mobs of zombies and recently deceased come streaming out of Tijuana and approach the position of Esperanzita, who leans close to Morgan and clutches his pant leg for protection.

They come and come, in limitless numbers. How many corpses have been buried in this busy Mexican town over the years? How many have fallen to disease, to war, to the predations of the drug lords and the accidents of the desert? How many murdered, either by their fellow men today in a state of fear, or in the past for the sake of money? None of it matters now. They come to feast on a god.

The time has come. He's been avoiding it till now, with the example of Jaguar in his mind, but against these numbers... Morgan's circle-in-circle flares with a dazzling light, the golden glow washing over him and transforming himself, for the first time since Infrared, into the avatar of the Truth-Seeker. The shotgun gleams now, and as he fires, the slugs seem to be made of liquid gold as they tear into the zombies.

And down the throats of the oncoming zombies is thrust the wrath of a god more powerful than their empty hunger could ever take-in. Charity's roar is like all the winds of a hurricane rushing from her chest, and she races to meet the enemy with her jaws open wide. The madness of Luna is upon her, and only death will stop it.

Charity doesn't break stride as her first swing tears through the front lines of her enemies, shattering their bodies and casting broken limbs and skulls. But that is not her only weapon. Her sheer size and vast speed allow her to use the very press of the horde to crush dozens more in her first mad trample. Arms and skulls are grabbed and bodies thrown to the arc behind her, piling quickly, forming a swelling hill of the dead.

And behind her, the twins have begun. They move through the motions of their martial art, channeling Essence as would an Exalted fighter. But their targets are not enemies - they strike their friends. Gently, just a fingertap against a pressure point as Charity or Obama move past them. Gracefully, they strike their allies' vital spots. And with each spot, the Solars and Lunars can feel Essence flowing into their anima, ready to be used in this holding action.

Obama doesn't move. Standing where he is, he concentrates his golden power into the bodies of the fallen that Charity is leaving behind. One by one, they evaporate into the air, transformed by his holy magic from unnaturally animated corpse-remnants into less than dust. Soul after soul is freed; body after body is reduced to nothing more than benevolent light.

Around him, the Secret Servicemen are kneeling and firing their weapons. Their marksmanship is good - for mortals - and they're able to pick off some of the outliers.

As Essence becomes spent, the twins revitalize the others doing the fighting. Their own bodies have begun to glow. Charity glances over. She realizes with a sickening awareness what she's really seeing. They aren't glowing - their outer selves are becoming transparent, and the Ivanovas' inner light is becoming visible to the naked eye. How long will this battle last?

It isn't fast enough. Charity knows it. She turns her attention to the only thing that might help her stem the tide. One after another she hurls grave stones with all her might. One headstone launches into a mausoleum, the shards of stone exploding outward as if struck by a bomb. All the while she keeps an eye on the twins, but whatever words she might have to say to them were understood long ago. Death has always been a very real part of their world.

Within the clinic, Benford finds Mokembe and Ho Chen holed up in the makeshift isolation chamber built for the experiments with Jaguar. The two other Golem doctors stand near the door with a crate of small arms. Mokembe and Chen work carefully on a corpse strapped to a gurney. The body is so battered it only twitches, its molding 50's-era suit hanging in tatters. Benford shudders, and silently prays for the sanity of the mortals out in the streets. Mokembe looks up as he comes in. "Got an answer for this one?" he asks, without malice.

Benford nods. "The others are killing... re-killing... the animated corpses, which were original vectors. That will weaken the Alchemical's hold. We need to develop a Song - an Alchemical control signal - to counter the default programming. Then we teach it to Esperanzita. And if necessary, we inject a Neurocyte serum into the infected to increase their susceptibility to it." He holds out his arm. "This is going to take all of us. First things first. Get 100 cc's of my blood. That notebook - " he points at a shelf - " has my notes on the neurocytes. I'll get to work on the Song."

With his blood drawn, Benford commandeers the room's PC and contacts Marlene. Composition of Alchemical music is as much computer hacking as anything else. He finishes explaining the problem to her just as a racket of gunfire begins outside; 10mm Smith and Wesson, typical of the United States Secret Service. He scowls, and gets to work. "And apparently we'll have to hurry."

The 'Song Hack' proceeds in fits and starts, minute by minute, as Benford sweats. The violence outside seems to be reaching a crescendo and the corpse on the table is thrashing to reach the door. He reaches for his Raven handset to download the new composition, and finds it missing - of course, he left it with the Senator. He records it on an old dictaphone instead, and bursts out of the lab as abruptly as he came, pushing the corpse and gurney before him. Mokembe and Chen barely look up as he leaves.

The scene outside is horrifying: stacks of dead bodies, more shambling down the streets, burning wrecks of cars, a weartiger in silver armor plowing through the zombie hordes, two dozen feds kneeling in a circle firing off clip after clip at the crowds. Benford shoves the gurney towards the exorcism pyre, and the captive corpse immediately disintegrates under the wave of holy light. Benford kneels before Esperanzita and takes her hand. "Sing with me," he murmurs in river-speech. "We've got a lullabye for your injured children. Sing this song to them now, and we can heal their wounds in the coming days."

Benford teaches the Song to Esperanzita, singing with her. He reaches inside to his own Alchemical aspect to guide the melody for the purpose. The attack drains essence from Esperanzita; but the very link to the victims that makes her vulnerable, also makes her the conduit for the countermeasure. The Song is heard across Tijuana, in the minds of the infected and in some of the more sensitive citizens. Cam and Charity can hear it loud and clear. Autochton's music is strange to mortal ears, but there's something about the message, when sung by Esperanzita, that even a human can understand: _be at peace, free your troubles, prepare for the voyage home._.

The song is sung. Tijuana grows quiet. And where the Ivanova sisters stood, there are now two faint sparkles of light. There is the silence that exists between heartbeats, and it fills the world.
