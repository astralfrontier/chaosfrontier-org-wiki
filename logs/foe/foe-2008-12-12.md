# Fall of Eden 2008-12-12

The silence is deep, complete. A soft wind rises, cradling in its arms a scent that is strangely clean. Also on that wind is the last flickers of essence as the forms of Elizabeth and Natasha fade into nothingness. The Full Moon does not need to see them to know that they have vanished.

"We always knew that our time was burrowed," murmurs Charity. But that knowledge is no bar to sadness. A tear turned silver by the protective skin of her brother glides down her cheek. She turns to her friends, her glance speaking volumes. "Please forgive me. I must understand something." With that, she walks away, trusting to her instinct to take her to those who can answer her questions in whatever order fate provides. It will be either Carbon or the Man that she finds.

The Man is tapping a cigarette out against his cigarette case. As Charity approaches, he lights it up and lifts it to his lips. "Yo."

Charity looks over the Man slowly, realizing that she knows nothing of him. "The question I had meant to ask is not the first that comes to mind," she explains abruptly. "What makes you happy?"

"Things workin' right," the Sidereal replies. "For example, take your two friends. As ghosts, they couldn't move on. They were locked into their current lives. Engel was wrong about that, but what he did ultimately paid off. Instead of a couple of human souls who got offed in a petty little revenge drama, they get to be heroes."

"I understand," says Charity. "Does this mean their souls are at peace?" The Lunars tone has changed greatly from the norm, her words delivered with more care, as if every word in the language were being considered before each is uttered.

"It means they get to go through whatever souls go through. They'll be back, though. Here, or in Creation." The Man takes a few drags from his cigarette, exhales a steady stream of smoke. "They'll keep on living. So, I mean, is _your_ soul at peace?"

Charity looks at the Man for a time, breathing in the air, tasting the flavor of the cigarette on the wind, catching the slightest shifting in the air as it moves around her. "I find it strange, but yes. I think I understand a great deal more now. There are some evils for which humans are not equipped. I want to protect them. But I will not live forever. One day, by the workings of fate, I shall leave them, and who will watch over them?"

The Man shrugs. "Why not let 'em watch over themselves?"

"It is our nature," replies Charity. "Whatever our origin, we have become the shepherds of this flock. For good or bad, it has become largely ingrained in us. But I do understand. I want to teach them to master their fears and overcome whatever limitations they believe they have, not take all challenges and difficulties away."

The Man nods, and plucks his smoke from his lips. "See, here's the thing. Your value proposition here, if you follow it far enough, amounts to 'keep people from hurting themselves or each other'. Don't believe me? We'll walk through it. But if you want to do that, you set yourself to the task of changing their natures for them. Some people gotta be hurt. Some people gotta hurt."

"Perhaps that is what it is," replies Charity. "I see in my mind two worlds. One ruled by law, where the weak might thrive without living at the mercy of the strong. The second is the world outside, where people live free from all laws save the natural order itself."

"I wonder which will find true peace first?" murmurs the Full Moon. "Humanity has had law for many years. Solar Law is different, however. I can feel it in my bones. I do not know what it will do to the world in the end. My skill is not in seeing what will come. I need your eyes to help me find the path that is right."

"Honey, I can't see past December right now." The Man flicks his cigarette to the ground, rubs it out with the toe of his shoe. "But law doesn't live long without one of two things: consensus, or power."

Charity smiles at this. "Consensus." She looks off into the sky for some time. "I must learn so much. I am still too young, but I have no time to grow wise at a sluggard's pace. I think I know what it is I need to do. My line must be one that has no love of power but that has a natural tilt for cooperation without endless debate."

The Man smiles. "Well good luck with that," he says. "And oh yeah. Stop by sometime. I'll teach you the prayers to say for the twins."

"I would appreciate that," replies Charity. "Thank you." The steady paces of the Lunar carry her onward, leaving behind the Sidereal. She realizes in a distant thought that the Man is still a complete mystery to her.

Charity goes on, never hesitating as she roams across the city. Though she doesn't know where Carbon is she walks as if she knew exactly where she was going. She stops quite suddenly, looking over the last remains of a building that has burnt to the ground. It is there that she finds the elder Lunar waiting. "The day is not yet over," Charity says suddenly. "I must explore my heart and mind, and I think only another Lunar can help me master all that I find."

Carbon smiles, baring fangs. "Speak."

The young Lunar settles on the ground and closes her eyes. "It is in my nature to want to protect these people from dangers against which they cannot possibly stand. Yet I believe in my heart that a time shall come when there are none watching over them. In that time I believe a darkness shall come that none of us have yet seen and the humans will be unprepared. Their great creativity and wild variety prevent them from immediate, effective action. In that first space someone must plunge headlong to buy them time."

Carbon nods. "Then breed protectors. Sharing your blood, they'll also share your passions. Then you simply become their god."

"Can I then shape their minds and souls to an extent?" asks Charity. "I want them to be different than men are. They will give up certain things to achieve this, but I cannot create them to be a competitor with humans. They are to be teachers, healers, and defenders of a sort that have little or no jealousy, without the plague of ego."

Carbon nods again. As he speaks, Charity is reminded of what she is dealing with. "Before you mate, shape a prayer of Essence in your soul. I'll teach you how. The children of your mating will inherit the destiny you prepare for them. Also, please, learn to become a man. You can fuck more partners that way, and that means more children being carried at a time."

The gruffness of Carbon's tone does not bother Charity. She has become rather accustomed to it. "I have thought of the advantages of that, but when I delve into my being it seems beyond my reach. Still, I must find the path to this, and I want to learn this prayer." She opens her eyes, looking at Carbon seriously, "I also need to think of my own destiny. While I prepare this line to go on after my death I must also grow stronger. I am not strong enough, Carbon. I will not be satisfied until my roar alone can shatter armies."

The Lunar cracks a grin. "Well then. You can't really breed descendants to do what you want, until you know what that is - can you."

"I understand more of what I want each day," replies Charity. "I want to protect humanity from the dominance of the Autochthonians or whatever else should be stupid enough to poke its head up here. I want to create a line that can thrive everywhere on earth and beyond, not needing to compete for the best lands. I want to protect those I love."

"Hmm. Sounds complete enough to me," muses Carbon. "What are you missing then? You can't see the future, so why not just trust that you can handle what comes?"

"Well, as you so succinctly point-out, I'm lacking a necessary limb, and I'm not that eager to fight battles while carrying a litter," answers Charity. She smiles suddenly, "So do you have any suggestions on how to move past that serious limitation?"

Carbon hums. "Well the enemy built mechanical soldiers. Why don't you lot do the same?"

"I have an inherent dislike for the mechanical," admits Charity. "Still, it may be possible with the science of this world to find an answer. I believe if my blood is used Gaia will recognize them as the children I promised."

"Well then there you go. There's always options. There's infinite power in the universe. It's our courage and determination that extracts it, makes it usable." Carbon flashes a feral grin. "Don't wait. Don't fear. Just reach out a claw and grab it. It'll come to you."

Charity rises smoothly. "Then it is time I did so." She adds with a grin, "I must admit, I was rather curious concerning how far my shape can change. Perhaps it is best that I do not have the freedom to spread my line so quickly just yet."

Charity has walked thousands of strides by the time she returns to find Newton. As she expected, he is hammering away at the current problem. She notes with relief that Becca is not far away, though the child is sleeping now. Somewhere on the way Cam has separated from his sister, and she no longer wears her warform. "Newton, my mind and spirit race ahead of me on this night of sadness. I must ask something of you, because I am not powerful enough in myself."

Newton, for his part, has also walked thousands of strides. Comatose victims are being brought in and, for lack of a better option, 'warehoused'. When he's not working, he's pacing the floor; Mokembe and Chen finally threw him out of the clinic, so he's up on the roof. He stops in his tracks as Charity approaches, recognizing a mode of speech quite different from the gang tough he met several years ago. "If I can deliver, it's yours," he says evenly.

"I know who I am," says Charity. She lets the words linger in the air for a time, before going on. "I have learned that one of my dreams can be achieved, but to do so with the strength I have will take too long. I need you to help me. I wish to begin creating the new race I promised to Gaia, a race that will protect humanity and respect the wild. I will imbue them with a spirit free of jealousy and with less ego. I need a way to put my line in the wombs of those who are willing."

Benford considers this. "Jealousy and ego are not strictly matters of genetics," he says, and then sits down on the cracked tar paper, in a contemplative pose. "But if you can find enough willing surrogate mothers, then it's quite likely we could do as you say, using your own gametes as a base. What do you have in mind?"

"Carbon will teach me a prayer to pass on the traits I desire," explains Charity. "These are, as you say, not only genetic matters, but they will have a strong start with these prayers and, fate willing, with my own guidance. I have heard murmurings of something called genetic memory as well that may prove useful. The goal is that they will be able to live without competing with men. They will care for humans, and in times of darkness they will spring into action: defending, healing, and raising men from the ashes, only to fade away when the danger has passed."

"Then there are two more things you need, and for at least one of them, I can assist you." Benford stands. "Fertilisation is easy enough, given volunteers. We can get creative with the genome if you want, particularly of the fathers. The real trick is making it work on a large enough scale, but... I'm sure that we've got the talent on hand for that. The mortals manage in-vitro often enough. But living in non-competition with the other other breeds of man?" He's quiet for a moment. "Our economic recommendations to the governments included a massive volunteer corps to travel to developing nations and build their infrastructure... with the explicity goal of cultural change... hmm. Have you talked to our distinguished Senator yet?"

"I haven't," replies Charity. "But I think perhaps I was not clear enough. When I say they should not compete with humans, I stress that they must be able to survive on the lands that humans will not care for, to thrive and grow on poor soil." She goes on, "They will understand themselves well, and will be happiest aiding those in need with no expectation that anything should be returned to them beyond the experience itself. The prayer shall make this part of their being."

Benford nods, slowly. "A somewhat more difficult problem of genetics. It will take time. But... possible, with the help of our allies." A pause. "You amaze me, you know that? Of all the things we've done, this thing you are doing, may be the most noble. Yes. I will help you. And if anybody asks, you've got my vote for Mother-Goddess."

Charity isn't sure what to say to that. She laughs gently at last. "Thank you, but I am not sure a mother goddess can be quite so harshly shaped as I have been. Nonetheless, I will hold to this task, and I am grateful that you will help me. These children will carry out the work for centuries to come, if this world is spared." She looks to the sky for a moment, then to Newton, "When I learn the prayers from Carbon I can begin the process of donating my.. gamete, did you say? I think before we rest-you must rest soon, you are pushing yourself too far-we must speak with the Senator."

Benford sighs. "I don't know that I ever can rest, Charity. This mess -" he sweeps an arm, taking in the city skyline - "my brother must answer for it. And if it's not this, it would be something else. I can't shake the feeling that, as soon as I'm done, I'll die."

"Done?" asks Charity. "To live to see our tasks completed would be a blessing. I do not know that our dreams can be realized in just one lifetime. And speaking of which, I wonder what dreams our new ally has." She will lead the way, drawing in the air and allowing scent to guide her steps as she seeks out Senator Obama.

The Senator is with his Secret Service escort, talking to some of the people of Tijuana. He's not hard to find - the surviving city staff have made quite sure to keep track of him. As Charity and Benford approach, he shakes the hands of a Mexican woman, and turns to greet the Celestials.

Benford offers his hand to the Senator. "They told me what you did. We've heard what you want to do. There's a lot I could say. I think I'll stick to 'Thank You.' Also, that we're here to help."

Obama smiles. "Well thank you, for all the great work you've done down here. I can't begin to tell you that I had worries. When 'it' first happened, I thought that there would be all kinds of ways for this sort of power to go wrong. But so far, I'm really pretty reassured."

Charity bows to Obama, happy to hear the words of an ally. "For some of us, controlling the power we have been given has been a more difficult road than for others." She smiles sadly and goes on, "Tonight's losses make it clear that our dreams must flourish together or flicker out one by one like distant stars, Senator. We will aid you in whatever ways we can."

The Senator nods slowly, his eyes roving over the city and the damage it has received. "I think what has happened here has really taken us past partisanship. Really, in a sense, past national identity. We've got to be all about humanity now, and the way that I think you could help best is to join with me, and whoever else has received this, eh, gift. What you've done in Mexico is fantastic, and I think the people here are really in need of this sort of help. But we can replicate this sort of success elsewhere. Not just in America, but around the world."

"Yes," Benford begins. "Actually, we have a plan for that." He hands over a thick folder, the printed copy of the "master plan." "We wrote this before we knew there was a Solar running for high office. That doesn't diminish it's applicability, but a lot of it may be obvious to you."

Obama receives the folder and begins leafing through it, eyes darting from the Exalted to the contents. "I see," he says after several moments. "I'm honestly not sure I could have predicted where this sort of power would manifest itself - I certainly didn't expect it to happen. I suppose I thought being Christian might disqualify me from...well, it's certainly been an unusual experience. I think what you have here looks very, very solid." He stops scanning, looking Benford in the eye. "I've still got the election to consider. Can I ask that you schedule some time with me next week? We'll absolutely be able to get this worked out."

Charity listens closely, more pleased with every word. "I am confident that we can find time to meet," she says. "We need a good plan. When you are elected we will need to have measures in place to ensure something like tonight's events doesn't come crashing down on America."

Benford chuckles in spite of himself. "You ask when you could command. Of course. I have... hmm. A family issue to attend to first. But after that... ask the Secret Service to borrow Agent Schroeder from the FBI for your detachment. On November Fifth, win or lose, we will be there." His expression turns serious again. "I'm sure they told you the stakes. It's all in my phone. Keep it. If you ever need us, we'll be right there."

Obama shakes his head. "There's no guarantee of that, you know. In fact, what I need to do before anything else is let the American people know about this." He touches a finger to his forehead. "They deserve to know. Whatever happens, people need to know about the man they propose to vote for. But - if I _am_ elected, I can promise you that these .. these creatures will receive our full national attention."

"Faith, Senator Obama," replies Charity warmly. "You are a leader, and I can't imagine you could stop yourself from improving the lives around you if you tried. It is your right and duty. That symbol that shines on your brow is a crown that can never be copied nor counterfeited. Your authority, Barack Obama, was granted by Helios and no one can strip it from you."

"That doesn't mean that the American people will trust me with authority as well. We have a distinct dislike of kings." The Senator chuckles quietly.

"If I may be so bold," says Charity. "The American people have only a dim recollection of kings, and those kings were not Solars. You love your people."

Obama nods. "I guess we'll see what happens."

"We'll bring our Mister Morgan," Benford says. "I didn't like the undemocratic nature of it all, either. The trick is... we need to lead by example. Morgan's been working on that."

"The ... Seattle reporter, right? Andrew Morgan?" The Senator has done his homework. "Yes, I've been meaning to meet him."

"I think he will be thrilled to speak with you, Senator," says Charity. "If I don't pull him away from his work to do so before you go I will be hearing about it for some time."
