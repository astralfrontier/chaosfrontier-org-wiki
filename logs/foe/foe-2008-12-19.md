Ever since the Halloween Incident, Morgan immediately retired to his private office space in Tijuana, which he quickly turns into a complex video editing lab. The other Exalts - and indeed mortals - never see him except when he slips out for a bite to eat or other bodily necessities.

A day and a half after he holed up, he emerges, looking bleary-eyed - as if he's been substituting coffee for sleep - but nevertheless energetic. A Raven is glued to his ear. "Right, right. Can you get me some time tomorrow? Yes, I'm good for it. Yes, I'll wire you the details tomorrow morning. Thanks. Bye." He hangs up, and starts looking for the nearest Exalt - preferably one with something to do with money.

Meyer is the first to come to mind, and Morgan makes a beeline for him. "Meyer! Just the man I wanted to see. I need a million bucks and I need it yesterday!"

The Sidereal financier reaches into his pocket and pulls out a collection of checkbooks. He rifles through them for a second, selects one like a magician doing a card trick, and presents it with a flourish. "Bring it back to me for the signature," he explains with a smile.

"Thanks!" says Morgan, immediately pulling out the Raven again. "Hello? Yeah, it's Morgan again. The financing's hooked up. I can fedex you the check now, and I'll squirt you the ad tonight. Is that enough time?" Morgan pauses, then nods. "Good point. Fortunately I'm in luck on that one, I think. If he's still here, and he better be. Call you back." Morgan hangs up. "Where's Mr. Hope and Change? I need to talk to him."

"You could give people their rightful names," chastises Charity. "You look like you need about two days of sleep, too." With a small shift in her feet her whole body is able to broadcast a bit of playful sulking. "So what's the big deal?"

Senator Obama is preparing to leave town, but he's still available in Tijuana, and Morgan doesn't have too much trouble locating him.

Morgan doesn't even respond to Charity, indeed doesn't even seem to notice she showed up. Instead, he makes a beeline for the presidential entourage. It's lucky for Morgan that he's known to the Senator, or the Secret Service would've had to explain a few things to him - Morgan is extremely impatient and won't take no for an answer. Even so, by the time Morgan reaches the man himself, word has got to him. "Something on your mind, Mr. Morgan?" says Obama politely.

"Yeah," says Morgan. "I've got an ad campaign about the attack on Tijuana yesterday, and the guy from NBC says I oughta think about the political implications. So I think that means I oughta run it by you first. C'mon!" Morgan seems to be restraining himself from the urge to grab Obama by the sleeve, and that only because of the guys in sunglasses.

Charity, not one to give in easily, follows Morgan. She is well known to the security by now, and not very pleased to see that Poe is not exactly demonstrating great manners. "A touch of patience, or at least manners," she reminds gently.

Morgan finally notices Charity, but only to glare at her. "No time! We've gotta get this out ahead of the Assembled! Sun knows how they're gonna spin this, and we gotta have our own spin in place."

"Please forgive him, Senator," says Charity. "He's helpless when he's on the case, and I think in this case he does actually know what he's talking about. Can you help him?"

Of course, Obama doesn't make media decisions on his own without checking with his advisors, and so Morgan is left impatiently tapping his feet until David Plouffe can be rounded up. Soon, though, Obama, his pressman, Charity, and anyone else Morgan might have drawn attention from are holed up in Morgan's media lab, where the reporter hits 'Play' on his new creation.

The music starts on a minor key, with Morgan's voice narrating. "The Assembled. A plague on humanity." Images of the Tijuana assault play across the screen - though the specific content is toned down for prime time, somehow the full horror comes through regardless. The narration continues, though - without saying so, it carries the clear implication that the zombie onslaught is the Assembled's plan of attack for all humanity. The cavalcade ends with a still shot. "Demand action now... before it's too late," says Morgan's voice, ominously.

Benford quietly parks himself in a folding chair. He looks pretty exhausted himself, from rounding up the coma victims.

Benford coughs politely. "This isn't exactly a message of peace and hope. If I were a low-information voter and I saw this, I might vote for the guys that shoot first and ask questions later."

Morgan shakes his head. "I understand that. But this really is urgent. It is _not_ a place for people who go off half-cocked, and we _do_ need people who will target the _right_ threat rather than scapegoat the usual suspects. But we can't wait around for the Assembled to take the initative, either."

Benford says, "You're the expert in such things. However, I think we'll have better luck if you give them some indication of what action they should be demanding."

Morgan purses his lips. "True. Got any ideas?" He glances at Obama.

Charity lets out a soft sigh, "It is time to lay our dreams on the table and deal with our enemies as a unified front. Our enemy has declared war on us time and time again." She, too, looks to the Senator curiously.

The senator purses his lips. "Terrorism is an emerging threat right now," he says at last. "Now as far as I understand this.. Assembled business, there actually is an organized state or power behind it. But the fact remains that they're using the tactics of terror and that means that unless people are educated, it's possible that they'll lump these actions in with other terror groups. Now, we've seen what can happen when that sort of misinformation is allowed to propagate. I would very much like to have a way for people to really learn what this means for them."

Benford unpockets his Raven phone and taps out a code. "We have the notes on the Walla Walla incident. Until today I would have been reluctant to interrupt their... 'experiment.' He tabs a button and both Morgan and Obama's phones emit a squawk. "That puts it right into the backyards of America's voters. Out of curiosity, Senator, how long ago did you Exalt?" He puts the phone back in his pocket and picks up a cup of coffee that Morgan left unprotected."

Obama smiles. "When I got here, basically. I realized this was something I had to try and help with. And so... I was given the power to do so."

"Then you haven't seen what the Assembled are all about yet," says Morgan. "We'll do our best to help you understand, because I think _you're_ in the best position to help us figure out what guidance to give people - when we have guidance to give. But the Assembled have... resources. It wouldn't surprise me if they've figured out how to use the media, and there's a real danger they'll try to portray _us_ as the threat. I need to get _something_ like this out there," says Morgan, pointing at the screen, "to make sure they don't get that chance."

Benford adds, "I apologize for assuming that you - and the rest of the world - are as familiar with this as we are. Ultimately, mankind shall choose between three visions for the world. Gaia would like her world as it once was - quiet and pastoral, like it was centuries ago. Autochton wants an orderly world free of humanistic chaos, and the Assembled are his avenging angels. We've seen his world. It's not exactly evil... just... limiting to humans." He pauses before continuing. "There's a third possibility. Hugh is the not-yet-born synthesis of Gaia and Autocthon, and he seems to be the anthropic principle at work. I think that when people have hope for the future, they're praying to Hugh." Benford smiles tiredly. "I think he'd like you, Senator."

"Why not talk to Hugh, then?" suggests Charity. She looks thoughtful for a moment, "Hugh, please be kind and show up for me?"

A clear singing voice sounds from behind Charity. "Once upon a time, once when you were mine," the voice calls out. A fair-haired youth steps from behind the Lunar and salutes smartly.

"Ah good," says Morgan immediately. "Hugh, did you see what I just showed them?" He gestures to the monitor, a screaming zombie still freeze-framed across it.

Hugh peers at the screen. "Looks scary," he says after a moment, furrowing his brow.

Charity smiles warmly at the first sound of Hugh's voice. She steps aside, letting Morgan have the floor, so to speak. She does whisper to Hugh, "Need to chat with you a bit after this. Don't worry, it's happy stuff."

"It's supposed to be," says Morgan. "The world needs to know how dangerous Autochthon can be, and how we Exalted are the only ones who can..." He trails off, and then grins broadly. "Of course! That's the part I'm missing. Let's see..." He turns to the screen and clears it, bringing up what is clearly a 'storyboard' view. "Okay, if I cut that segment, and this one... yeah. That'll give me enough room for the 'Exalted are the answer' bit..."

"'Vote Exalted'?" asks Hugh, glancing up at Obama.

"Hey, I plan to," Obama deadpans in reply.

Charity snickers softly at this. "So Morgan, what exactly are you doing?" she asks, forcing herself to be serious. Sure, it's probably futile to try to get Morgan's attention, but maybe she can bring him back to reality for a few moments. Without taking off any clothes.

Morgan had seemed oblivious to the fact that there was anyone else in the room - even when those individuals included a Presidential candidate and the avatar of a nascent Primordial. Even Charity's direct question takes a few moments to penetrate. "Isn't it obvious?" he finally says. "I'm making sure the ordinary people know that Autochthon is sending his zombies after them and we're their only hope."

Benford frowns. "That's your message, yes." And then, gently, "In the end, aren't the ordinary people their own only hope?"

"Of course we need to give them direction," replies Charity. "But isn't it a lot to ask of one commercial?" She looks thoughtful for a moment, then suggests, "You know, why not launch a Raven satellite? Or make use of the internet to get more of our story out there."

"Good point," says Morgan. "I can put a URL at the end of the ad. I'll have time while the network guys review the ad to get the website up."

Benford's frown deepens. "Morgan, this isn't like you. We're dealing with an explosive subject here, and you're talking about using the truth as a weapon against the people it's meant to protect. Maybe scaring the piss out of them - sorry, sir - is an effective means of gathering support, but if that's what it takes, I'd rather run silent."

"We aren't trying to cause a panic," suggests Charity. "Any message we send will lead to a new unity of purpose, a dream, and faith in the future."

"It's a tall order for a few seconds," continues Charity. She moves closer to Morgan, setting a hand on his shoulder gently, "But if anyone can do this, you can."

Morgan blinks at Benford. "What are you saying, Newton?" he says, shaking off Charity. "Surely you of all people realize what we're up against. You've been _in_ the belly of the beast. You know how dangerous they can be for humanity. As if them nearly turning the entire population of Tijuana into zombies isn't enough? No," says Morgan, shaking his head, "we _need_ to get the people on our side. We need to prevent this from happening again."

Charity is rather surprised by Morgan, this time, but says nothing of it. She'll back off, standing by Hugh and watching Morgan closely.

Benford stands slowly, putting himself neatly in front of the Senator with the motion. "Morgan, this is wrong. You've got your lover, your doctor, and the next President of the United States telling you that this is wrong. You know what can happen when we snap. People make religions out of our failures as easily as our victories. If you lose it now, you could take the whole operation down with you." He shoots a meaningful glance at Charity, who is standing closest to the reporter.

"What's going on?" asks Charity. She sees the glance, but isn't sure just what it means. In times like this, it's best to look to a person of reason. Considering things, it's perhaps not surprising that Charity turns to Hugh and Senator Obama. "Something feels wrong here."

Charity can see the answer in Obama's eyes and turns her attention back to Morgan. "I'm afraid, dear, this is going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me."

Charity's punctuates her word with lightning-fast motion. As she races to cross the short distance she moves almost impossibly low to the ground, stopping at the last moment to throw her torso backward, hands gripping the ground as she flips backward, aiming a fierce kick at Morgan's head. She has no intention of holding back.

Morgan, taken aback, swerves away from the foot by a mere hairsbreadth. "Charity! What are you doing? All this over an _ad campaign_? Have you gone mad?" He whirls and breaks for the door.

Benford holds his hand out towards the nearest of the omnipresent Secret Service agents. "Taser!" he shouts. "He's sick! Take him down! No shooting!"

Charity is quite fast, and with her target only fleeing, she has no need to worry for defense. Still, she doesn't want to hurt Morgan, just stop him. She watches the way he runs, the pumping of his arms giving her inspiration. Timing it carefully she lunges and throws her right arm forward to try and catch Morgan's left arm on the backswing. In the same spinning she casts her left arm back, aiming to capture his right.

The light-footed reporter, however, is difficult even for a Lunar to snare. Morgan's forehead begins to glow with the Eclipse emblem as he instinctively ducks, giving him just barely enough leverage to twist away from Charity's iron grip. As he continues to run, he begins to call out, "Help! Someone help me! They've gone mad! They've all gone mad!"

Benford charges behind, a herd of panicked secret service agents and one confused Senator in tow. They pass Meier in the hall, who looks somewhat less alarmed and somewhat more amused. "Morgan's losing it," he shouts. "We need to sedate him!"

Charity will keep the pressure on, but she's going to have to up the ante to stop Morgan quickly. First, she has to get faster. Firing up her anima certainly does that. The silvery light marks her clearly, making the tears running down her cheeks look like additions to her usual array of silver tatoos.

As Jet runs, she notices in her peripheral vision what this public chase is bringing: attention. She sees a few people aiming video cameras at the running figures.

Charity doesn't care about cameras, about the media, about all this garbage that has come to intrude on her life. Right now she cares about protecting someone she loves from himself. She knows this city better than anyone. She's stalked every inch of it with her security forces, and she knows a dozen hiding places. She has to reach him, first, though. She leaps up on the wall of a building, kicking herself skyward and casting her legs and arms wide as she plummets towards Morgan, hoping again to catch him.

This time Charity draws upon everything she has and the strength of the Lunar wins through. She has Morgan's arms pinned, holding him firmly, but not causing harm. "You are not yourself, Morgan, but a little rest should be able to cure it." She looks around, hoping to find help. "Hugh? Can you do anything?"

Morgan struggles, but his strength isn't even remotely the equal of Jet's. All he has left is his voice. He calls out at the top of his lungs, "Someone! You've got to help me! Get me away frommmmph!" His voice is abruptly muffled as Charity adjusts her grip and gets a hand across his mouth.

Benford and the men in black arrive. And as if on queue, an overly-nondescript black Chevrolet Suburban brakes to a halt next to the scene. Benford doesn't address the crowd directly, but he lets his voice be carry. "We need to get him to our clinic, fast as possible! I'll explain on the way!"

Between Jet, Morgan, and the armed guards, the first truck is already full; Obama and Benford wait for the second, which is only moments behind. Benford realizes that he's in the middle of a ring of cameras, everything from cell phones to DV cameras... though thankfully no news crew. He clears his throat. "Don't you think there's already been enough of a horror show this weekend? Give the victims their dignity. Give your heros some peace." He turns in a slow circle, making eye contact with as many individuals in the crowd as possible. By the time he goes through 360 degrees, the crowd has decided to be somewhere else.

The ride to the clinic is short, and Benford finds himself face to face and alone with the most popular man in America. "This is the dark side," he says simply. "When we snap, we snap big. The soul is a real thing with its own scientific laws. Our augmentations directly affect that soul and push it beyond the red line. There's only so much of that, that anybody can take. We have something that helps, but the best defense is to stick to your ideals and listen to your friends. If you're having a bad day... order them beforehand to hide the Football."

The clinic is still inhumanly busy. Mokembe is dealing with the victims as best he can, but there are thousands - maybe more than a hundred thousand. It will take a small army just to keep them all from dying of dehydration, and so the Nigerian doctor is shocked to see Charity pushing Morgan, bound to a wheelchair, followed by a small army. "It's Jaguar's syndrome," Benford quips in passing, and they head directly for the operatory where the engine-interface is still deployed.

Morgan takes the place of Jaguar in the machine; Benford can't ignore the look on the reporter's face, which contains, among other things, a great deal of hatred and betrayal. "When this happened to me... it made Wheeler. Better to do what we can," he says, as he starts a pentathol drip. And then the scientist takes his place in the adjoining chair.

Seeing that look in Morgan's eyes is enough for Charity. She turns away. Before she leaves, she whispers to the scientist, "Please be careful, Newton. You're exhausted."

Benford begins the process he performed before, the use of a patch to heal Jaguar Hombre. This time the personality he feels entering Morgan is different, and he can recognize some aspects of it. "I'm Sera," whispers a voice, that of a young girl. She combines effortlessly with Morgan's soul, as it is arrayed for Benford's inspection. "Thank you! Oh, and don't forget my kitty!" Benford hears a mewing - utterly incongruous within the psyche he experiences, but somehow fitting.

As the chair-induced trance fades, Morgan opens his eyes. "Thank you, Sera," he whispers softly, his left hand twitching as if petting an invisible cat. "And thank you, Benford... Charity," he says softly. "It's good to have friends who know me so well."
