# Fall of Eden 2009-01-02

Carbon and the Man are sitting with Charity in one of the Catholic churches near the outskirts of Tijuana. The building is empty. Even in spite of the Celestials' manifestation, people come here to say Mass. But not on Tuesdays.

The Man has come to talk at Carbon's request. Now he sits, in his usual rumpled business suit, rifling through a manila folder packed to the brim with paperwork. "So we're here to talk to you about souls," he says.

Charity sits before the altar, staring up at the cross, lit now only by the dim light of flickering candles and the myriad colors of sunbeams bent by the stained glass windows. "I am ready."

"I don't know how much of our former discussions you recall so I'll just skim the basics again." The Sidereal extends a few typed pages from his folder, which contain a densely written version, presumably, of what he's about to say. "Souls are eternal constructs. They're composed of complex patterns of Essence, with something at the 'center'. That something is the will. Essence goes out, nothing goes in, as far as anyone knows. Roughly speaking, a soul is like a house. It has a shape, it has a history, it has things that happen inside it. It gets torn down and damaged and repaired."

"It also has rooms. Big public cozy rooms. Little hidden rooms. Rooms where secrets live. Rooms nobody goes to. Rooms where things happen. Rooms for storage. And one of the things that gets put into those rooms is Essence, specifically the echoes of Essence that pass through the soul during its life. Like, you live in your family house when you're growing up, you leave behind your diary, your toys, the clothes you outgrew. Get it?"

"I do," replies Charity. "As the soul progresses, it goes from cell to cell, leaving behind what no longer is needed."

"Except... why?" The Man pauses, shifts where he's sitting. "If it wasn't really needed, why does the soul store it?" He smiles faintly. "There is a reason, actually. It's related to what happens when you die."

"There's a guy, a god rather, who lives in Heaven. The Celestial City of Yu-Shan. It's not _in_ Creation, but it's reachable from there. His function in life as a god is to receive the spark from dead Exalts. The spark stores life memories too, in a similar fashion. What he does is strip out some of those memories, package up the others, and generally organize the lot, right?"

Charity hears the description and for a moment feels ripples through the constructs of her own soul. It echoes inside, where things were once so loud, now they are quiet. In that warm silence a word is whispered and Charity breathes it out gently, "Lytek." With the utterance a rush of thoughts blaze past so swiftly she can only catch bits and pieces, making out no more than a fraction of an image here and there.

"Yeah. That's the guy." The Man looks carefully at Charity. "He's got time to devote to that sort of thing, because Celestials don't really die that fast." He coughs a bit. "But regular mortals outnumber the Celestials about ten million to one. So the Solars of the First Age built a system. It's a mechanism for reincarnation."

"Your upper and lower souls are two different thing. Upper goes with the mind, lower with the body. Your upper soul goes into the pipeline and undergoes some processing, then comes out and attaches itself to a new body. Your lower soul goes on, spreading itself out among your descendants - if you have any."

"And part of that processing is the suppression of memories from previous lives."

"Are some souls reserved for certain bodies?" asks Charity. "Could they be encoded for such a thing?"

The Sidereal shifts about again, crumpling up a piece of paper, wadding it into a ball. He tosses this to Carbon, who catches it easily, then jerks his head toward Charity. The Lunar takes his meaning and tosses the paper along. "See this, right?" asks the Man.

Charity snares the paper at the last second, holding it carefully. "I see it."

"Yeah. Now throw it back to me."

With a flick of her wrist, Charity tosses the paper to its source. "Easy come, easy go," she murmurs.

The Man receives it, and tosses it again to Carbon. "The paper is like the upper soul, or _hun_. It moves from place to place. And the rules of this little game we're playing? Where _you_ must throw the paper along, and then someone else catches it and throws it again? That's the soul's ultimate destiny at work. That destiny keeps a soul moving from place to place."

Carbon, meanwhile, has tossed the paper to Charity again. "Now," the Man asks. "If I hadn't told you to throw it at me, who'd you toss it to if I just said 'throw'? And why?"

"I would just throw it up and catch it myself," replies Charity. "To keep it safe. It seems the safest way to ensure that it is handled as it should be."

The Man tsks. "But then nobody else gets to play. And if nobody's playing, then it's just a piece of wadded up paper, ain't it."

"True," says Charity. "So I would throw it to the one most likely to use it well. Assuming, of course, that this is a soul, and not just a piece of paper, I would be far more careful with it. To shelter something away from all dangers leads inevitably to its weakness and death."

The Man nods. "But here's the thing. Let's say the rules of the game - the destiny of that soul - say 'throw it to the next person in the circle', no matter how well they'll handle it. What do you do?"

"It depends if the game has a purpose to it or not," replies Charity. "If the game is the way souls work, I wouldn't change it unless I was far wiser than I am now. Reality was built as it is for a reason. I was chosen to change those things I see as wrong or broken, but I also know my limits." She tosses the paper to The Man. "I still have my vision, but I do not wish to break the world to achieve it. I defend what is, I do not destroy it."

The Man nods. "Right. So that's what happens. A free _hun_ latches onto a free _po_. A new human being is created. What happens in one life sets the stage for what happens in other lives. That's the rule for _human_ souls, though. And if you try and mess with that, I expect you to justify your actions. Read me?"

"Correct. But will the children I envision be human? Or by human do you mean all sentient creatures?" asks Charity.

Carbon speaks now. "You should figure out what you really envision." He falls silent as the Man steps in. "I mean human. You know, two arms, two legs, a face, a brain, fucking stupid? You guys. You know what human is. I don't mean every sentient creature, no."

"I know what I want, and I know what I see. I have asked for other views, but I realize that in the end, it must be what I see." Charity closes her eyes, focusing her mind clearly on what she sees. "They will not be as stupid as normal humans. Their minds will be critical to their way of survival. They will have their share of free will, but they will be guided to serve as I have promised."

"Then they need to not be human souls, or inevitably they will go their own way," the Man says, looking intently at Charity.

"Can we use the chair to make new souls?" asks Charity. "Or to shape something that is not human into a soul that will work for my purposes?"

The Sidereal laughs. "That chair? That's like asking if you can use surgical tools to create a fetus. It's too primitive for the work you want."

"So what would I use for this?" asks Charity, undaunted.

The Man shrugs. "I'm not sure. But frankly I think it's an act of monumental hubris to assume that your will - the will of one living person - is going to be sufficient for all of future history's needs."

"I am starting to think that nobody quite understands what I mean," replies Charity. "Humans have done things in the name of the divine for thousands of years. They did not have to have new souls. They had measures of freedom, but due to education and society-even one built with little to no essence-many of them remained true." She points to the cross, "They followed this because they needed to believe in something. They needed hope. That hope was built without essence-wielding super heroes. That hope was built on their own faith concerning events they suspect occurred two thousand years ago."

"With the aid of scholars and my own minor gifts, I can create my line with my values intact," says Charity. "All parents wish to pass such things on to their children. Most parents even succeed; some to a great extent. They do not have the advantage of getting to create a new system of education, a new environment, and a custom-built society for their offspring alone."

"I hope this has provided more clarity," says the Full Moon. "This isn't about domination of the will. I need only use human souls and guide their education and upbringing to instill in almost all of them the view of the world that will lead them to prosperity and to delight in helping less fortunate humans. They will have all the advantages in this regard, having a positive genetic makeup and the proper upbringing and culture to reinforce it."

"Yeah, but here's what I'm getting at." The Man shakes his head. "'Your values'. A thousand years ago, your values would have been male dominance, Feudal government, and warfare for personal insults. In the Second Age, slavery was legal. But you, right now, probably find those things repulsive, yeah? So what makes you think your values are so special and unique?"

"Perhaps. And yet the drive to protect their own, to push the envelope of where life can exist, to explore the universe and to understand has been with humanity forever. That religion they pursue in this building delivered a commandment above all others. 'Love one another'. Through the rolling weight of centuries it has stood the test of time, as relevant a base for all decisions as it was the day it was first spoken. I know things will change, but a framework can be made that will allow adaptation without annihilation of the central tenets."

"Then what you need to put in place is a destiny. The actual people who follow it are almost immaterial." The Man smiles. "And I can tell you all about making destinies."

"I will try to be an attentive student," says Charity. "I have a feeling destiny is a province that only you and those like you can truly master."

The Man gets up. "We need to go to the Core anyway, to find out what Benford needs. So you'll come with us."

---

The Man leads the way; Carbon and Charity follow. The Sidereal seems to know right where to find Newton Benford: at the hospital, examining the infection discs and the infected survivors of the attack.

"We're gonna go use the Core to do some research," he explains without preamble. "I'm going to show you fuckers what the world is like for me. Now come on."

"Hello Newton," adds Charity. She looks at the Man and sighs. "Well, us fuckers are damn excited."

Benford wordlessly puts down his instruments and picks up a thermos of coffee. "Your ubermensch project?" He takes a long pull. "Tell me more."

"Mexico City," the Man says. "Relevant to both of you guys. Now pick it up."

---

"I don't have a symbiote, so I'll be doing this my way," the Man explains. "Carbon's stuck out here as well, so I'll see you guys inside." The small group have traveled across the border to LA, still the closest access point to the Lands of Light.

For Charity it has been a while since her last dive. Even with the access point she is a bit hesitant. Fortunately, the whole Snake relationship has improved greatly. She murmurs softly, "It's amazing what one can become accustomed to," as she feels herself ascend into the Lands of Light.

Though Infrared is under new management, Benford can swear he still smells gunsmoke and machine oil. Or maybe he's imagining it; he's been obsessed with finding a counter to his brother's weapon and has barely slept since the attack. In any case, it's a convenient focus for him to consider as he enters the Lands of Light. Hypatia begins the simulation and the sensations sharpen into the antechamber of the Core, a great machine of light and motion that exceeds even the Exalted Spark in complexity.

The Man is waiting for the pair, along with the presence they know as the Supervisor. The two are already in conversation as Charity and Benford arrive. "Listen. It's not political," the Man is saying. "This is perfectly within our rights. _You_ know that. .. Anyway, time to get to work."

He twists a hand. The Solar and Lunar find themselves in black space, empty and alone. Below them, faint lines of light begin to emerge into visibility, structuring themselves into a bright three-dimensional lattice. "Mexico City," the Man explains.

The lattice moves upward, drawing closer. That, or the Celestials are slowly falling into it. "The patterns of fate that bind the city together."

"If it's within our rights," Benford hazards, "then there is some kind of agreement that both sides respect. And if there is some kind of agreement, then it was negotiated... formally or informally. And that means that both sides have power over the other, at least in potentia. Now I know what we have to fear from you..." And here Benford pauses, and addresses the Supervisor, though it occupies no single point. "You fear us," he finishes quietly. "God."

"They're trying to kill you," the Man points out. "What, you think we sat down over ice cream and said 'please do what we want?' Anyway."

The Sidereal now points to dark areas of the matrix. "Right, so Alchemical activity doesn't show up in the Core, because they aren't managed by Earth's version of fate. They have their own. But, their actions have consequences. So basically we're doing a search for threads, if you will, that seem to go somewhere but don't _come_ from anywhere. Causeless effects, if you will. Don't ask me to just point a spot for you, this search has been running for awhile, and it'll keep running for awhile."

Benford casts his gaze over the galactic sprawl of the city's informational form. "I suspect we can hurry it along."

"You told me that you can't see past a couple weeks from now," says Charity. "What happens to this when that great change hits us?"

"This? This will all go away," the Man explains. "That's why we're looking backward in time. That's all stable, no matter what happens. Maybe."

"We aren't very sure of anything at this point, are we?" muses Charity.

The Supervisor cuts in. "That is why we oppose you," he rumbles. "Because you have done this thing. And you are not even fully aware of its consequences."

"You are the reason we're here in the first place," replies Charity.

"I may say the same," the Supervisor replies calmly.

"We came by invitation," says Charity. "You came as unwelcome invaders, from what I understand."

"Your understanding is incomplete, a fact which you seem to freely admit," says the Supervisor.

"As is yours," replies the Full Moon.

"Kids, do you _mind_?" asks the Man, speaking through gritted teeth.

Benford focuses inward to the fragment of Alchemical nature that he still possesses, and tries to find sympathies between it and the sprawl. "But there was also an Alchemical outpost off the coast of India. You went there yourself. I've got to wonder, give the Primordial understanding of time, if we can even determine chicken and egg here." He discovers that, in imaginging Wheeler, he's formed a mirror of himself out of thin air. "Not exactly what I was trying for," he mutters.

"That wasn't an Alchemical anything," the Man answers. "That was a human civilization. They just got ahold of an artifact. It's... kind of a complicated story."

Charity nods to the Supervisor, "We will have to discuss it later." She looks to the Man and asides, "He's terribly impatient."

The Man sighs. "Anyway, the search will happen as fast as it happens. It's a little like magical radar. You broadcast Essence through the Core and listen for a reflection."

Benford mulls this over. "I imagine that our detail on the past is pretty good, yes? Can you show me the Tijuana graveyards, before the Day of the Dead festival?"

"I can show you what it looked like here. Reconstructing that into something humans can make sense of is tougher. This isn't a Panopticon, it doesn't work that way." The Man gestures. "This stuff makes sense to _me_, but my patron goddess made me that way."

Benford shrugs. "Show me anyway." He snaps his fingers and the Wheeler facsimile dissolves into a cloud of light, but does not fade. "He was involved. I can still feel him, in that sense, we have an exemplar from which to compare. We might get lucky."

The Man twists his hand about; the representation of Mexico City vanishes. In its place, a new set of glowing lines begins to weave itself into a tapestry around the group. "Here's Tijuana."

The representation has a white glow at the center of it, and a quite definite sphere of light surrounding some parts of it. The Man points. "That right there is the spiritual barrier. That's Esperanzita, basically, along with the life support bubble she constructed for herself."

Benford says, "Does that actually cover the graveyards, the origin of the attack?"

"Probably not, since they were able to act out there, y'know?" the Man points out. "That's the whole problem - they can't operate inside the zone. But, animated corpses can do so just fine."

Benford nods. "So effects without causes... from in here it would just look like the discs had blinked into existence? Or that they had always been there?"

"Kind of. If whatever machinery installed them was manufactured on Earth, though, it'd show up just fine." The Man hums. "_Erath ku ket sekathet_. I think that's how it goes. Let me see if I can find some English for you.... 'That which burrowed up into our lands from the Abyss below.' If cause and effect were water, we'd be looking for something resembling a wellspring."

"Damn," Benford growls. "Then we probably won't find it here. That's a good reason to have built them in Mexico City, the place is so big."

"Right. It's hard to build a factory in a graveyard. And these things would have required machining, just like any other complex device. Some things don't change." The Man shrugs. "So. Let's talk about destiny in general for a moment. Hopefully your specific concerns are being handled to your satisfaction here?"

Benford nods. "This is better than we could have done by mundane means," he says. "I'm not prepared to sacrifice those lives. Therefore, I have to find a countermeasure. This is the best path to that. Thank you."

The Man nods. "This was built with Alchemical science. Your counter will be built the same way."

"Then in your professional opinion," Benford asks cautiously, "Those people that got infected aren't totally screwed?"

"You guys are involved. I'm reluctant to say anything's impossible."

The Man continues. "These threads of destiny, and the destinies of souls, don't simply come out of a hat. There's no Destiny Lottery. They come from various places, but basically they break down into natural and artificial. Artificial is the sort of business Sidereals have. For example, we might assign blessings or curses to people, based on conditional factors. The usual reason to do this is to organize the world on behalf of the Celestial Exalted - you guys, plus us of course."

"So let's say that Charity came to us and said 'I want this fate for a large group of people, like all my descendants. Now it's true what Carbon told you, that you can issue prayers to do that. But it's much, much more effective for a Sidereal to do it. Of course."

"When you want to work with destinies, it's wisest to go to those who are experts in it," agrees Charity. "But should I also offer prayers, or would that merely get in the way?"

"It's more that the Loom of Fate doesn't really listen to your prayers the way they listen to ours," the Man says. "Don't be offended. We manipulate fate, we have access to do that. You shapeshift, you have the power to do it. It's just what we do."

"So it's more like.... asking a personal favor vs. filing legitimate paperwork."

Benford says, "I thought we were suppoosed to genetically engineer her new race. But you're saying that if we create a Destiny, it will act like an attractor, and people will end up following it, and do the genework for us?"

"I think he is saying leave the guidance of what they will do to destiny, but I will still need to give birth to them, give them physical being. This isn't about the body," says Charity. "Destiny is the pathway of the soul."

"Yeah, you got it," the Man says.

"Then I think I will be bothering you a great deal," says Charity. "What do I need to prepare? I want to get Morgan's help in giving them a basic society concept. I see it, but it needs to be put into powerful writing that will reverberate through the centuries to come. They will need both a system of education and sources of knowledge.. so much to do."

Benford says, "I've heard that they had Charms for writing perfect tutorials in Creation, but... they seemed inflexible to me. Or rather, more suited to the reality of Creation than Earth."

"Then why not just make one that is more suited to this place?" asks Charity. "You are a Solar, after all."

Benford says, "In part, Raven is supposed to help us do that - to provide an artificial mentor. Or more accurately, to distill the best advice of thousands of natural ones in a convenient oracle." He rubs his forehead. "This will take time, but I am eager for it to happen; and the Core seems a good place to start."

"It is something to think about," says Charity. "We must not let ourselves get critically sidetracked by our enemies, as important as they may be."

---

Morgan is sitting in his media workshop again, but this time just holding his customary notepad and pen. And, apparently, talking to himself. "You think that's not very nice?" he says in a low tone. "Hm... yeah, you're probably right. How about..."

Charity has always enjoyed watching Morgan work. Especially when he is having a conversation with himself. It's not as easy to sneak up on him as it used to be, but she still manages a fair job of it. Only when she's reaching out to put a hand firmly on his shoulder does she say, "What's not very nice?"

Morgan looks up. "What? Oh, the new campaign I'm working on. Sera thinks we shouldn't get too graphic about the zombie invasion, because this time we're trying to encourage people, not scare them." He smiles. "We're still on the brainstorming stage. Something I can help you with?"

"So many things," replies Charity, lending a distinctly inappropriate tone to the comment with the slightest lift of a dark eyebrow. "But I have a feeling you are being more serious. I wish we had more time for fun these days." She leans over to look at Morgan's work, "But you love doing this, don't you?"

Morgan nods. "Of course. Trying to communicate with people is what I do. Give them the truth, and help them deal with it." He taps the side of his head. "And Sera's a lot more help than I would've dreamed."

"I'm hoping then, that you can help me communicate with people who have yet to be born," begins Charity. "I need someone with great writing talents and the spirit of a Lawgiver to create help me create a society for my descendants."

Morgan swivels his chair to face Charity. "Now _that's_ a tall order," he says solemnly. "You've got some pretty big plans for your progeny, I know that. What sort of thing do you have in mind?"

"Essentially what I wish to make is a race of people that are like angels," replies Charity. "I want them to be virtuous and selfless, so they will be able to inspire humanity. I want them to learn to find joy in serving others, and to have the skill and patience to live where humans normally would not."

"I realize now that they must be like humans, otherwise their inspiration will be lessened. If their behavior seems attainable humans will aspire to it," explains Charity. "To do any of this, they will need a society built specifically for the task, as free of any distractions or disruptions as possible."

"'Or have we found angels in the form of kings to govern him?'" says Morgan, quoting Jefferson. "Though I gather you don't intend them to be rulers over others, except by example. Hmm..." The reporter rubs his chin. "Well, let's see. The hardest part, to be honest with you, is for me to make sure that I'm true to _your_ vision. Left to myself, I'd just make Truth-seeking the highest virtue and call it a day, but I don't think that's quite enough to meet your needs."

"Seeking truth doesn't necessarily mean serving in the sense I have in mind, no," says Charity. "Though it is a noble calling and it has a place in this dream. Certainly to keep them on an even keel they must have an interest in the highest truths of existance. I decided to do a little reading here and there to get ideas to use for the society. I like the concept of the commune, and I like the idea that children will not belong to their parents." She smirks, "I read a few pages of The Republic, but for the most part I'm just following my heart."

Morgan nods. "We all have to be true to ourselves," he agrees. "Who else have you talked to about this?"

"Carbon, The Man, Newton," muses Charity. "A few of my family members. I may have a couple volunteers in that group, who knows?" She laughs softly and sits on Morgan's desk. "And of course I kinda promised that my descendents would revere and serve Gaia. I believe they will do that by carrying life to the most inhospitable places in the world and thriving. Morgan, I'd like it if you influenced this dream of mine."

Morgan smiles and executes a bow from his seated position. "I will be honored."

"I have run across a few problems with my concept," says Charity. "For instance, with all the gifts I wish to give these children, what will keep them in-check? Will society and culture be enough to keep them from trying to dominate humanity by force?"

"Tricky," admits Morgan. "Humility is easy enough to inculcate in an individual, but over an entire culture... well, cultures evolve, just like organisms do. They evolve to perpetuate themselves, to survive. If faced with another culture that is attempting to destroy them, for whatever reason, they'll be tempted to overpower the aggressors - and if that is successful, they'll be tempted to continue. So not only do we have to find a way for them to survive without dominating their 'wild type' brethren, but we'll have to inculcate them with a deep and abiding faith that the peaceful strategy will work."

"We also can count on some serious help from destiny," says Charity. "At least, if The Man is in a kind mood and willing to help me. I'm not sure to what extent that will shape things, but I will seek help from all the sources available." She looks at Morgan in silence for a few seconds before going on. "What would you want for these children?"

Morgan catches the mood, for once, and manages a faint blush as he looks back at Charity. "I... I guess in the end, I want what any parent would want for a child. To be healthy, and happy. To grow up strong and virtuous." He grins. "And of course to have lots of grandchildren, if you will." Morgan's expression goes serious again. "But not too many. We're going with your vision, not Abraham's."

Charity can't help but laugh, "Well, I think Newton is going to help do some science work to make sure the child is especially healthy, and I have my own tricks to fix things as well. I imagine the offspring of two chosen are pretty special in their own right anyway." Seeing Morgan get a bit shy about things makes her more confident. "I'm not sure how many children are needed to get a race started, but we better start getting some names together, huh?"

Morgan's blush deepens, but he returns the laugh enthusiastically. "Sure! That one's easy, compared to deciding the destiny of an entire race."

"Well, deciding the destiny of Creation and Gaia is our other big project," notes Charity. "I figure I need to do something great or I'll feel lazy compared to you and Newton." She looks back to his current work for a moment before asking, "What do you want? If you had this gift and didn't have to worry about the alchemical problem, or the essence issue. What is your dream?"

Morgan sits back. "I want humanity to be inoculated against deceit. So much of the dark phases of our history came about when some priesthood or philosophy used deceit as a tool, to exploit the people as a whole... and even the people who saw through the deceit were afraid to speak up. I want humanity not to be afraid of calling 'bullshit'. Not everyone will catch on to every lie, but as long as there are some people you don't fool, I'd like to think the lie will fade."

"Do you know how you will do that?" asks Charity. "It sounds like a pretty huge project in its own right."

"If you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail," Morgan replies. "And my 'hammer' is my way with words and ideas. My main tool would be to do the sort of thing you're asking of me, really. Create a philosophy, a meme, so strong and inspiring that it would perpetuate itself. A vaccine against philosophies of deception and self-deception." He smiles. "But if there's one thing I've learned from Gaia, it's the vulnerability of a monoculture. If my philosophy won over everything, it could go 'bad', and end up causing worse problems than it ever solved. Maybe making _your_ culture's philosophy just as strong, yet guided by your vision rather than mine, will help promote intellectual hybrid vigor."

Charity perks up and beams. It's not a rare occurance. There are moments when she practically radiates joy these days. "I'm so happy to hear that. One big, happy family. Or, at least a couple sets of distant relatives with enough diversity to keep both lines viable. It's inevitable that some of each kind will gravitate away." She cups her chin in one hand, thinking aloud, "Of course, the greatest threat to any progress of this kind is the current regime. I think Senator Obama can help us start to fix that."

Morgan shakes his head. "Don't overestimate the current regime. Senator Obama himself is proving that deception doesn't last forever, and he was a 'mere' mortal for most of that time. There've been lies that held sway for far longer and did much more damage. What I'm hoping to do is inspire a more vigorous immune response." The biology electives in college have taken their toll on Morgan; he persists in using biology as a metaphor for culture.

"So what does the world look like in your eyes?" asks Charity. "What do you see now? What do you want to see when we've started to make our changes? Will life change radically, or do you only seek to change a few things?"

"Honestly?" says Morgan. "I haven't given it much thought. Especially since Hugh gave us that vision of what happens in December. I think we're going to have my hands full just keeping people together at all. I've spent most of my time since... since meeting Sera just thinking about _that_ problem. That and the Assembled."

"Let yourself dream," says Charity. "There may come a time-and it may be soon-that requires us to make difficult choices. If you dream ahead a little, you will know what your priorities are in such a time."

"You have a point," Morgan says. "What do you think, Sera?" He pauses for a moment, then chuckles. "Sera thinks I should spare some time to enjoy cute kitty-cats."

"Sera is right," replies Charity. With a teasing grin she asks, "Does she think tigers are cute?"

Morgan seems to listen for a moment. "She says yes. But they're kinda scary too."

Charity grins, "Well, hopefully not too scary." She kicks her feet a little before her patience quells the old habit. "When you've taken some time to dream, you have to tell me what you see. I'd like to have a hand in making some of your dreams come true. You've being doing that for me for a while now."

Morgan reaches out to take Charity's hand. "I'll be sure to share my dreams with you," he says quietly.
