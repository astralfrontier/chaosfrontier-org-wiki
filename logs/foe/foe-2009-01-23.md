# Fall of Eden 2009-01-23

The old tunnel meanders through the earth beneath the monastery, as expected. However, a hundred feet in, it shows signs of being freshly worked. The broken bottles and smell of decay are gone. Another fifty feet and the walls become smooth and glassy. Rather than sloping up towards the old fort, the floor slopes down into darkness.

Benford runs a gloved hand over the wall, suddenly acutely aware of how quiet it's become, and how loud his own footsteps sound. "Sintered through the living rock," he mutters.

Benford is momentarily overcome by a wave of vertigo, and as it passes, he realizes that he's alone, and further down the corridor than he expected. "Oh shit," he croaks, and runs backwards along the tunnel. But rather than sloping up towards the rough-hewn earth, it continues down and widens, opening suddenly into a circular chamber populated with stone pillars. Each pillar is a few feet wide and maybe ten feet tall, failing to reach the domed roof of the cieling, some twenty feet above. Each is etched with vertical bars of some exotic substances that emits a pale blue-white glow. The room is wide enough, and the pillars dense enough, that Benford can't see the other side. After a moment he turns around and charges back down the hallway... coming out of another archway into the same room.

Benford bites back a curse. He has no explanation for this turn of events, but he's pretty sure of the cause. "Wheeler," he shouts. The room is big enough for an echo; but as the echo fades, his words, in his own voice, change and twist. _Wheeler... Wheeler... is here... dear brother._

Benford brings Reason to his shoulder and chambers a round. The mechanism is tuned to perfection and emits little noise, but in the unearthly arena it sounds as loud as if he'd pulled the trigger. He follows the wall to his right, noting that it's perfectly smooth and glassy, like polished obsidian. The blue glow of the pillars swims and seethes along its surface. The echo of the mechanism turns into a rasping laughter as it fades. "I don't need to know why," Benford says evenly. "But it will be better if you tell me now."

Again, the echo of Benford's voice dovetails into words that are not his own, though in his voice. "I have missed you, dear brother. They did things to me, for setting you free. You remember. They were going to kill you and take your Spark. My last act under your influence was to bring you back to Earth. Give your new hope a chance to take root."

Benford feels a guilty twinge. "I thought they'd killed you," he says quietly. "If I'd guessed that you were still out there, I'd have tried to help. I can still help you. He - The Maker forced you to direct the attack on Tijuana?"

The mechanical laughter returns, loudly. "No." The single word is as loud as if Wheeler was standing right beside Benford, and the scientist wheels, waving his shotgun at the imagined threat... but there's only empty air, and the echo. _No... no... He does not force me. That plot was my own._

Benford backs up against the wall, and lowers Reason's muzzle until it points at the floor. The implications are profound, and terrifying. "Wheeler... why? How could I do that?"

The echo is replaced with a hiss of disgust, as if a boiler could show contempty. "You? How could you indeed? But we are not the same being. What they did to me... was horrible. You know what it's like to be in love, truly in love? You've been there more than once. But you don't know rejection, Newton Benford!"

Benford resumes his march, a little more frantic, looking for a way out of the hideous blue room. Wheeler continues, his voice dripping with something... not hatred. Something more sublime. "Besides the purely sensual punishments, they isolated me. Divorced me from my God. You arrogant little man. When you fled you took from us our purpose, our meaning, our place in the Maker's Design and the Loom of Fate. But..."

A long pause; long enough for all the echos to fade. Benford estimates that he's walked half the perimeter of the room, and it might be a hundred feet across. _Not a trap. An arena._ When Wheeler resumes, he's more even in tone. Almost civil. "But the Maker had mercy. He gave me a new Purpose. And in it I have found the entire truth of our Universe, from the dawn of time in Creation to the present day on Earth. It all makes sense to me now."

Benford begins walking slowly towards the center of the room, where dimmer lights show the possibility of a clearing in this stone forest. "I'm happy for you. I really am," and he tries to mean it.

A chuckle. It's his own, and almost warm. "I knew that you would say that. And wouldn't you know? You're right about one thing. This really is all about you. Or more precisely, about you and me. You understand Essential Virtue now - the poles of the world of our souls, the attractors and axes of Fate. That's us, my dear brother. The poles of two possible futures."

Benford finds his clearing, and steps into it. The central floor is devoid of pillars in an area thirty feet wide. Over the same area, the cieling is... not obscured. It's missing, forming an oculus into an inky blackness that has nothing to do with the night sky. "Alright," Benford says. "If we're the poles, then let's work together. We've met the balanced solution - Hugh. You rememeber, don't you?"

Footsteps... and this time Benford things he can isolate the source. Something is moving on the other side of the arena, but Benford doesn't raise his weapon. "I'm afraid it won't be that simple, my boy," Wheeler replies, with an air of condesencion. "Hugh is not relevant to the equation anymore. There's only you, and me." Wheeler stops, apparently dressed in a uniform similar to Benford's own God-Skin armor. "I still haven't told you, what purpose He's assigned to me. Don't you want to know?"

Benford sees a smile on Wheeler's face. He knows it, and is suddenly afraid, because it's a smile he'd only let himself wear in private, during mad power fantasies. He'd imagine himself hale and hearty, not a cripple, confronting oil company executives and crooked politicans, and breaking their limbs for their crimes against humanity. It wasn't something he ever talked about; not something he ever wanted to really do, and shuddered to consider, even as an Exalt. It was a dark but trivial guilt. But in seeing the mad scowl on Wheeler's face, Benford knows that, for all he took from Wheeler, he has more to fear from what he left behind. He raises the shotgun and blasts wildly as Wheeler launches himself across the span, inhumanly fast, out of the path of the heavy slug.

"They told me to kill you!" Wheeler shrieks, and spreads his arms wide, his fingers growing into mechanical talons. He swipes at Benford, and the scientist dives madly behind a pillar for cover. The talons strike hard against the stone and draw showers of hot sparks. "Kill you and take your Spark back to its Maker! Prove who is the superior model! That is the key to victory! That is all that matters!"

In such close quarters, Benford discovers that a shotgun isn't the most effective weapon; but Reason is no mere shotgun. The scientist finds motions of his arms coming unbidden, a martial arts discipline for enchanted firearms. Certainly the weapon's divine nature must count for something, as Benford uses it to parry strikes that would shatter mortal limbs and lesser weapons. But he's only surviving. Wheeler's mechanically augmented form has the clear advantage. Tthe slashing talons dig rents across the shotgun's finish and tear furrows in the augmented armor of the God Skin. A few times Benford gets a clear shot, and squeezes the trigger. The heavy slugs never seem to strike Wheeler, or else his mechanical double doesn't care.

Finally, Benford fires his last shell, and notes that it ricochets loudly off a stone pillar and up through the oculus, where it disappears. The pillar, he notes with a start, is completely unmarred. _Transtech?!_ He suddenly remembers the reason they came - all the victims of the infection disks. The pillars, if indeed they be Alchemical artifacts, could help find a cure. And in the moment of distraction, he realizes Wheeler is gone. He frantically reloads, and once again the echo of the mechanism forms into words in the dark mirror of his voice.

"I'd like to say it's nothing personal," Wheeler mentions, "But let's face it, this is very personal. All the Hells and Creation together aren't big enough for two Benfords. You remember the copy you made, before going to meet the Maker? Before becoming me? You never re-instantiated him. Did you ever wonder why?" Benford stops suddenly as he considers it, and he knows that Wheeler speaks the truth. "Removing your Spark won't necessarily be lethal," Wheeler continues. "It's within my power to preserve the remaining mortal. But... I've been in that position. To be mortal, your hands off the reigns of fate, no grand destiny to call your own? No, dear brother. I'll spare you that. If you still draw breath after my machines take the hero out of you, I'll make sure that you don't suffer for long."

Benford finishes reloading and chokes back his fear. Wheeler, of course, knows what buttons to push in Benford's psyche, and the most terrifying thing, is that Benford knows that Wheeler is right. He leans against a pillar to catch his breath, and feels a painful shock. He staggers away and feels at his back, noticing a deep tear in his armor. His hand does not come away bloody, but the skin on his back is numb, and suddenly he understands. _Wheeler's machines._ He's not speaking of minions. The entire room is filled with transtech devices, and in their Song Benford recognizes the familiar verses of the control programs of the Symbiogenesis Chair. The scientist is struck from behind and pitches forward, and knows that Wheeler has returned. He scrambles to his feet and resumes the fight.

Benford isn't sure if he's a better warrior than he thought, or if Wheeler is just toying with him; but he manages to avoid any serious injury, though he bleeds from a dozen shallow gashes and his God-Skin is reduced nearly to rags. He's sure that several shots strike Wheeler, and takes heart when one catches his opponent in the knee, and Wheeler staggers. But the moment passes, and Wheeler rises up and hurls himself at Benford with a bestial roar, smashing the scientist to the ground. The blue markings on the pillars glow more brightly, and seem to swim before Benford's eyes, or perhaps he's going into shock. Wheeler stands over him, and kicks him in the ribs; Benford rolls painfully away. "Get up, dammit," Wheeler demands, in a voice full of ice and static. "Get up so I can kill you properly."

Benford spits out blood, and levers himself up. He uses Reason as a crutch, and notes that there's only one shell left. Breathing heavily, he glares at Wheeler. "I would have saved you," he says. "Now I'm beginning to hate you."

"You're problem is that you never loved, or even despised, anyone or anything, save a pile of useless abstractions too distant to matter. Destiny demands concrete passions. Only in that way can the Maker's creations exceed his vision." Wheeler stalks slowly forward. "In assigning me to kill you, the Maker has built that passion in me. That's why I'm better than you. That's why we'll win."

Benford clenches his eyes shut, and imagines the Alchemical world from the neurocyte vision. Benford, one cog in a mighty machine made of human minds, curing a dread plague. The human race, building vast cities of steel and glass and more exotic materials. Clean. Efficient. Perfect. But that wasn't the way it happened. Benford's own double caused a horrible plague, rather than cured one. The patchwork architecture of Tijuana, mixed between gleaming banks and colorful resorts, and crumbling shanties, are not visions of perfection... but Benford realizes that he'd damn well die, to save the hundreds of thousands of strangers that live in that imperfect world. Most of humanity lives in humble circumstances, and there is a nobility and vibrance that comes from that chaos. His own vision of the Pyramid City now looks stale and sterile, but he sees it again, with streets full of people and growing things. _Cities that can be grown... like Charity envisions..._

Benford opens his eyes, and growls, "No!" He swings Reason like a great axe, catching Wheeler unexpectedly in the jaw. The Alchemical staggers back, with a shriek of tortured metal coming from one knee. Benford continues to swing, striking knee, elbow, and head once more. "No... you... WON'T!'

Benford can hear a scream from the small god living in the weapon. But it's not a scream of pain... the simple mind of the tool understands that it's being spent in a righteous struggle. With a light like a tiny sun, the grips of the weapon shatter, digging chunks from Wheeler's artificial body.

Benford notices one of the pillars, directly behind Wheeler, glowing brighter than the others; and in a moment of clarity, he raises the remains of Reason and fires its last round. Time seems to stand still, and Benford suddenly is aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the materials at hand... the millions of fine cracks now running through Reason's barrel, the shifting form of Wheeler's body, and the solid and nearly flawless stone of the pillars. Nearly... but not quiet. He sings a Song to his own nerves, and his fingers twitch, putting the rifled slug on a precise and lethal trajectory.

The slug impacts with the pillar, which simply shatters. The arena is filled with a stinging blue light, and Benford feels another moment of vertigo as it forces his way into his mind. Deep in his own soul, in the closed mental vault of his Chimera nature, he hears Wheeler scream.

When his vision clears, Benford is in a room much like the one he left... but the sense of menace is gone, as is the glowing traces on the pillars and the dark oculus above. The floors and walls now seem to be ordinary stone, though worked to precisely the same dimensions as the arena, and several of the exotic pillars still stand. A heap of disordered, human-shaped machinery lies on the ground nearby, swaddled in a black cloak.

Benford approaches Wheeler, and sees that the face is still intact... and glaring at him.. "Passion and hatred," it wheezes. "You should thank me for that as well... for without it you wouldn't have won." A spasm goes through the figure. "This isn't over," it grates, and then then face literally falls away, revealing a mass of gears and wires, which themselves fall to disorder and ruin between eyeblinks.

A few moments later part of the ceiling starts to crack, then erupts in a cloud of dust. Appearing out of the cloud like a ghost is Charity, The Major raised and ready, but she lowers her weapon, seeing that Newton has already done the work. "Did you get what you came for?" she asks breathlessly.

Benford allows Reason's corpse to slip from his grip and clatter to the floor. "Wheeler got away," he says simply.

Charity looks past Newton at the remains, "If you say so. We still have work to do. We can kill him and his Maker later."

Benford reaches into the ruins of Wheeler's simulacrum, and pulls forth... a crowbar. Maybe it was part of a femur. He looks up. "We can follow him," he says. "There must be an access point here. If we take this place in the Lands of Light, we take it materially as well."

"Alright, then let's go kick his ass now," replies Charity. She is already reaching out. _Snake, you got a link to the Lands of Light here? There's someone we have to kill._

Charity is answered with action. The Lunar is drawn into the Lands of Light and pops into existance with a gasp. She floats in space, surrounded by an endless field of stars. Her vision of this place is clearly cosmic, complete with several great glowing clouds of dust. She draws in a breath, not to respirate, but to seek out the enemy with all her senses.

Newton brightens into existence next to Charity, a moment later. "If you're looking for him... start with me," he says, and focusses his attention on the Song that he always hears... the part that has his own name on it.

Back in Gaia, even as Charity's body closes its eyes, Morgan arrives close behind, seeing Jet and Benford unconscious. He kneels to check their vital signs. "The Lands of Light," he comments, turning to those behind him. "Protect our bodies. We're going walkabout," he says, settling down beside them and reaching out in his mind for Sara's hand.

Charity smiles at Benford, then sees Morgan pop into existance as well. "The pack is together. Now the hunt begins."

The trail isn't hard to pick up, by any medium. The departing presence of Wheeler shines through this realm of ideas, and the Exalted find it easy to propel themselves with equal aptitude. They find the fleeing Alchemical in a vast expanse of light, shot through with blue streaks and glowing orbs.

There is another presence there as well. As the Exalted draw close, the cobalt lines draw together in a protective net to bar their passage, and they see a lambent figure step out of the brightness. Benford recognizes him immediately - though not by appearance. By, well, nature. The saboteur aboard the airplane, when he flew to America. "You disabled the nuclear device, Wheeler. Why?" the figure asks, turning to interrogate his compatriot.

"I was following my directive," answers Wheeler curtly. "Destroy Newton Benford." But Mr. Blank isn't satisfied. "Your larger directive calls for the destruction of all the Celestial Exalted - even if they were your friends."

Fascinated as he is by Wheeler's conversation, Morgan knows that they must get through. This is a world of ideas, though - and so though brute strength would rip apart such a barrier in Gaia, the Lands of Light demand a different approach. His hands draw across the azure strands, and he focuses his mind, addressing the barrier through force of will. _You will let us through. We act in the name of Helios and Luna, and we have business here._

"I'll tell you," Benford answers. "It's personal. To him, the whole war is down to him versus me. Now get out of our bloody way. This is family business."

"They have no authority in this domain, for they are the gods of Creation only," a cold voice whispers to Morgan.

_They may have no authority here. But I do._ Morgan responds, his Caste Mark glittering into existence as his force of personality shapes itself into a tool to draw aside the strands. _I am Andrew Morgan, friend of Gaia, and I am here to protect Gaia's Sanctuary from those who do not belong there. And **you** will not stop me._

The barrier holds stubbornly still, but Morgan realizes he's found what he's looking for. Mr. Blank is speaking. "You are not family. You are divergent natures founded on a single human lifespan's memories. There is no reason to deviate from your natures. Unless, of course, you are reacting emotionally to each others' existence."

Benford realizes that he's missed an important point. "What 'nuclear device'?" he demands.

"Knowing the magnitude of the assault on the Mexico City installation, I planted a nuclear device on site," Mr. Blank explains. "However, Wheeler disabled it. I am now attempting to reactivate it, and he is attempting to block me. However, neither of us stand to gain if you interfere."

"Order of operations. It appears we kill you first, then kill him," replies Charity.

"Foolishness. I am not the only Alchemical attempting to ensure your deaths, Ms. Williams," Mr. Blank answers calmly. "I am merely the closest."

"It's a good starting point," is the Full Moon's answer.

Morgan pulls a pen from his avatar's shirt pocket. _In this realm, the pen really **is** mightier than the sword,_ he reflects. "Nor are we the only Celestials attempting to drive _you_ from Gaia," Morgan says as he begins to sketch a portal atop the barrier.

Benford frowns at Wheeler. "It's not like you to make mistakes. Reacting emotionally I can understand... but sentimentality, or viciousness?" Wheeler merely sneers in reply.

At the same time, Benford looks around the image of the room; if Mr. Blank and Wheeler are both wrestling with the arming mechanism of a nuclear bomb, there must be some connection to it from here... unless they've both physically manifested, and the struggle is literal.

In either case, now that they know to look, the arming circuit has a definite presence... in fact, it seems to be overlaid on the floor, cieling, and walls of the virtual chamber. A hand of digits separates Wheeler from Mr. Blank like a line in the sand, and they alternately count up and down. Either the device isn't yet armed, or it is, and the two Alchemicals are wrestling for control.

Morgan finds the blue fibers of the barrier twisting the lines of his portal even as he draws them. "You are most firm in your purpose," he whispers to the barrier, as one might to a worthy foe. "But the fate of Tijuana, and of my world, hangs in the balance here, and I _will not be denied_." He draws a press pass from his hat - a fitting symbol for gaining access to a restricted area - and draws the card sharply along the glittering strands. The press pass's edge glints with the golden light from his Caste Mark.

"Awww, you win," the barrier whispers - and Morgan recognizes the force behind it as Hugh. The network of lines begins to fade away.

As the grid fades, Benford considers his three opponents. He's got good reasons to vent his anger on each of them; but there's a question of priorities, and ultimately, the armed nuclear weapon trumps any other chore. He immediately dives into the nexus of tautologies that mirror the arming circuit, seeking to fuse it into a useless lump.

Charity sees Newton try to attack.. something. It takes a moment for her to grasp exactly how one can battle here at all. The Lunar turns inward, tapping into the very protean nature of her essence: the cancerous, annihilating disorder that resides at the very heart of her being and lashes out at the projection of the arming circuit.

While his allies work on the bomb itself, Morgan has a different goal in mind. Mr. Blank and Wheeler both have a vested interest in preventing Benford and Jet's efforts from succeeding. "You warned us about interfering," says Morgan as he interposes himself between his allies and his foes. "Now I warn _you_: do not interfere with our attempts to protect the people of Gaia. You do not belong here any more than we."

Benford has only half an ear turned to Morgan, but he can well imagine Wheeler's reaction. It doesn't matter. Neither he nor Charity has neutralized the bomb with their seperate efforts. Maybe it's the tension, but suddenly a thought hits him from our of left field. "Growing cities," he blurts. "We have live through this. What your parahuman kids shall do, it's too cool to ignore." He holds out his hand to the lunar woman. "We need to do this together. These things here, lead to high-speed switches... if you want to randomize something, help me randomize those."

Charity reaches out to take Newton's hand. She 'turns' to face the enemy, as it were. A flood of utter chaos moves through her, but it is not the mad, devouring nature of Wyld, but instead the endless bounties of nature and chance, every form, every permutation of plant, animal, and mineral are captured in the rising waves of essence, and powering them all like the moon's pull on the tides is the heart of Charity, a swirling vortex of emotions that despite her words is dominated by love, so that every new peak is more beautiful than the last.

Benford watches the luminal representation of the circuit carefully. The bomb must be some kind of compilation of mortal and Alchemical technology, as the interface has a lot of quirks; but underneath it all, ever nuclear weapon is based on a critical balance of carefully timed signals. Without them, the detonators are little more than firecrackers, and most weapons contain failsafes that render them unusuable after an attempted subversion. Like so many things lately, he finds his answer in the mortal/Alchemical interface, and directs Charity's chaotic storm of human emotion into the delicate krytron switches. A tick later and the walls of the chamber freeze; that particular timer will never count again.

Wheeler grins sardonically at Mr. Bland. "You should have understood that the nuclear device was irrelevant. Child's play to me. Child's play to him. You must let me do my job and you must let me do it my way, lest you further your own obsolesence."

"I will warn you. Pursue us further and you will enter Autochthonian Control," the nameless Alchemical says. He and Wheeler both begin to move away - their final purpose seemingly thwarted.

Charity watches the two departing with an uncertain frown. Even if she plans on killing him later she calls out, "Wheeler! For what it's worth.. thank you."
