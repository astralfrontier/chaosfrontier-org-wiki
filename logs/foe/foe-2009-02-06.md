# Fall of Eden 2009-02-06

The scene: the Wyld. More specifically, a small island of rock that floats unsupported within the raging maelstrom of primal chaos. And surrounding the rock is an ephemeral barrier of Essence. Red marks decorate the stony surface. And within their protective bubble sit two Solars, huddled close to a campfire. A carefully-wrapped portrait sits nearby, propped up against an enormous golden blade thrust into the stone.

Disturbing the chaos is the rush of a great ship, it's essence cannons blasting tight beams of destruction at whatever pursues it before it abruptly shifts directions, racing towards the makeshift shelter. Just as it is about to crash into the exalts the craft transforms in a flash of light, changing into the form of a graceful, winged woman with flowing hair.

Undisturbed by this series of events, one of the Solars rises. "Meggan," he remarks, brushing a hand through his black hair. "Yes. We're still lost. And I only have so much blood to give." He gestures at the arcane marks on their rocky island.

"It's a good thing you're lost, otherwise I never could have found you in this," replies Meggan. The goddess turns to survey her surroundings, "Lost, but not alone," she muses softly. "Since we haven't a way out, we might as well keep going, right?" she asks suddenly.

"Told you we should've made that left turn at Gem," remarks Tanuki. Even in the face of primal chaos, he's flippant and nonchalant. "Seriously though... I'm kinda feeling useless here. 'cept for that horde of bat weeds back there."

Ryushi shakes his head. "You were quite effective against the translucent tyrant lizards and the gestalt worm," he says. "And whatever that purple thing was. With the eyes?"

"This all seems familiar, somehow," notes Meggan. "Oh, and I think that one was the Thrice-Cursed Doom of Raeon." A brief pause, "Or perhaps just a goo monster with lots of eyes."

Ryu sighs. "I'm not giving up," he says at last. "We'll get there. We have to get there. But..... I'm not sure where else to go."

"My mother used to say if you can go neither back or to the side there is no choice but to go straight ahead," replies Meggan. "And here, of all places, anywhere that we believe is the right direction, if we believe strong enough, will be. We have to stop wanting this journey to go on forever if it is ever to end, don't we?"

Tanuki shrugs. "Hey, I just want to see this awesome island of hers," he says, gesturing to the painting. "Seems like it'd be fun. At least once we get some people moved in and get a night life going."

Meggan laughs at Tanuki, "I can never tell if you are serious or joking." She moves closer to the painting, settling down beside it. "So, one more try?" she asks. Her endless optimism prevents her from even thinking of calling it a 'last try'.

In the distance, something becomes visible. The Solars and Meggan together become aware of it. As it draws nearer, they can make out details: it's something like a golden fiery comet. And it's on a collision course with the tiny island they are sitting on.

As it draws closer, it's obvious that this thing dwarfs the island itself; the expedition is in very real danger of being destroyed. Nor does it look like a Wyld manifestation. "We'll have to jump," concludes Ryushi immediately, darting forward to grasp the sword and painting. Tanuki likewise darts forward, but grasps Meggan instead.

The flying colossus demolishes the rock as though it were powder. The bubble flickers and vanishes. The Solars leap, landing dextrously on the upper hull of the golden battering ram. A shiver runs through it, and the whole thing comes to a lurching halt beneath them. A nearby hatch opens, and a woman's head and shoulders pop out. She's giggling; a bottle of wine is clenched tightly in her hand. "Told yaaaa," she slurs. "Hey, sailors! Want a lift?"

From below there's a voice. "Katya, I think--" The woman grows irritable, cutting the speaker off immediately. "Berg, shut _uuup!_ We made it." She turns her attention to the passengers and hiccups. "Come on in!"

Ryushi, Tanuki and Meggan look at each other dubiously. But what choice do they have?

---

The Presidential returns are in. Barack Obama, Senator from Illinois, black man, and demigod, will be the next President of the United States.

Charity had to abstain from voting, since her legal status in Houston is dubious at best. She's spending her time with Carbon, practicing the prayers that will provide a key component of her attempts to create the children she envisions. In any free time, she is out on the streets, spending time with her family and the people of Tijuana, trying to better grasp the difficulties they face.

And with the election complete, Morgan has someone he can work with. Though Obama refuses on principle to contradict Bush on foreign policy, he is still going to inherit the reins of power all too soon; and so it is in coordination with him that Morgan intends to prepare his public education campaign. In a way, there is no reasonable way for anyone to prepare for the Chaos Frontier, but nevertheless people can be warned that changes are coming.

Benford has spent several days at the seized Alchemical facility in Mexico City, dealing with the results of the raid: not the least of which is an improvised nuclear bomb and the world's most wanted terrorist. His highest priority is the victims of the plague; and after round-the-clock experiments, he returns to Tijuana with a vaccine derived from Lunar blood samples... including Usama's. The scientist's head is too crowded to deal with the moral implications and imprecations. Right now only one thing matters: without the vaccine, a hundred thousand people will die.

The Hospital Angeles has been completely given over to care of the plague victims. Mokembe and Marlene meet Benford in the radiology department. The Alchemical vat, which held Usama, has been brought down on a cargo elevator. Benford also brings a familiar grey cube. "I want to get this right the first time," he says, "so I'm recruiting some help." He slots the cube into a socket on the base of the cylinder, and the three Solars get to work.

The design of the body is based on studies of the Golems - the Ivanova sisters and Ho Chen's doctors. Chen himself provides the basic template; the vat fills and a humanoid body, male and of medium build, takes shape. A few hours later the tank drains. The new being opens its eyes, moves its head, but does not step out. He seems to be waiting for something. Benford steps forward, recalling the 'Unity Dream' he once had. "You were Engel. You may be again. There are people in this building who are victims of a terrible plague and they need your help. Do you wish to be part of the solution?"

"I always have," the newly decanted figure says, smiling.

Benford grins. "Then live again. We'll bring you up to speed as we go."

With Engel, Benford, and Mokembe at work, production of the vaccine is rapid. After a time, Engel comments. "You've done as well as anyone could at countering the Maker's weapon," he begins, scratching his chin with a casual humanity that Benford didn't remember him having before. "Our chances of success are as good as they'll ever be. It's up to their will to live, and His will to..." he trails off. "He didn't make this, did He? You did? No, that's not right..." He closes his eyes for a moment; when he opens them, he's expressionless. "'Wheeler.' Well then." He doesn't say anything else; and Benford decides not to elaborate.

The first success comes around nightfall, when twilight and shadows lengthen over Tijuana. It is the evening of November 7th, one week to the day since the attack. The victim is an anonymous child, a girl of about ten; her family is either dead, fled, or somewhere among the sea of victims. Like most of them, she's got an IV jammed in her arm to keep her hydrated. She's been selected because she's among the healthiest candidates. Engel injects the vaccine as Benford watches; Mokembe and Chen are at the opposite end of the ward, starting a drip on an opposite case: an elderly man, who won't last much longer without a cure.

The first sign that something is going right, is from the infection disc. Its sheen changes from bright and reflective to a dull grey, and it seems to shrink. After a moment it falls from her forehead and clatters to the floor, leaving behind a round patch of stark white skin - not a scar, exactly, but a mark of the ordeal. After a few minutes, the girl's eyes flutter open. She looks confused, but alert, and begins mumbling in Spanish. "Mama? Papa? Where am I?"

Benford begins breathing again, and is startled when someone walks past him, and puts her hand on the girl's forehead. "Hush, my child," whispers Esperanzita. "Your parents are coming soon."

There are a hundred thousand victims, some still piled in the streets, but they'll be walking again soon, as free men and women. The cure spreads as fast as feet can carry it. Word of the cure spreads at the speed of sound, until it reaches the cadre of journalists who have occupied several floors of the Marriot. Then it travels at the speed of light, around the world. In New York, Chicago, Seattle, Nairobi, the spontaneous parties that broke out on Election Day are revitalized, and joined by celebrations in Tijuana, Mexico City, San Diego, and Los Angeles. The loudest cheers are outside the Hospital Angeles itself.

Benford hears none of this. He's finally fallen asleep from exhaustion in a recently vacated hospital suite... but when he wakes, he will find a basket of cookies on the bedstand.

Tai and An are a Solar from Tibet and a Lunar from inland China, respectively. They seem a happy enough couple as they arrive in Ricky's beat-up Jeep from the airport. Upon seeing the American Celestials, Tai whispers something to An, who giggles.

The Man is present, along with his cohort: the Shadow Synod, the Sidereals who manage Europe and the western parts of Asia. Their names are quickly mentioned and as quickly forgotten; hopefully it will stick once the Exalted hear them more.

"I think we got this, folks," the Man says. Every Solar, Lunar and Sidereal that could be found has been assembled here, in this one place.

Charity smiles at the strangers, but her mind is focused more on what is to come than on making small talk. "Let's find some answers," she says at last.

Not all gathered are fit for seeing. Until things are a bit better arranged Charity has decided it is in the best interest of Usama to not reveal himself openly. Having no shortage of costume knowledge and a rich background in popular cinema to draw upon leads Charity to dress him head-to-toe like some kind of action hero slash ninja. The only thing the world sees is a pair of eyes on a tall man's frame.

The Celestials gather. Each has been instructed in the prayer. There is no difficulty in performing it; no gods must be impressed or appeased. And in due course, they conclude it.

Nothing seems to happen. Eventually the Celestials look at each other. Then: "It's coming! I see it!" The observer, posted with a telescope and instructions to relay any new developments, has yelled out his announcement.

The ground begins to rumble. In the open sky overhead, clouds are shifting at an uncomfortable velocity. Benford, Charity and Morgan look up. There - off to the east, they see it. A golden dot. It's growing in size. It's descending. Or is it plummeting?

Something enormous - something the size of Tijuana itself, almost - has emerged from the sky and streaks like a lightning bolt over the city. It passes the Calle Perifeco Sur and over the foothills to the west. There's an enormously loud noise. It must have landed in the ocean.

Benford says, "Huh," Benford quips. "Guess it was too much to ask for them to land in the middle of town. Alright. We've got twenty-four Celestials and probably another two dozen hangers-on. That's about six full helicopters." He looks up; there's at least that many in the sky, between the governments and the press. Oddly, none of them have moved west at all. "Let's get them and go, now."

"Wow, it's even bigger in person," Morgan comments, grinning hugely as he makes his way toward the docks.

Charity is worried until the Ranapura goes streaking through the sky and out to the waters. "We should have anticipated this," she mutters. "I'll go ahead and make sure no mortals were crushed." She takes to the skies, and a good portion of the Lunars join her, all racing ahead to ensure that Ranapura is secured and waiting there for the others to arrive.

The trip west is frenzied, and takes only a few short minutes. The golden city itself is sunk into the sea at a slight angle, but seems stable even against the waves. Beach-goers are already snapping photos of it from afar; the Solars and Lunars are able to actually disembark (or simply land) on the top deck.

Even though it appears clear Charity and the others take no chances. There's a strange sense of familiarity to working together in this way. They barely even speak as they fan out on the top deck, every Lunar prepared at any second to come under attack.

Benford stoops, runs a hand over the deck-plating. "Some kind of metal I've never seen," he quips. "I think I read somewhere that the Goddess of this place, used to be the Goddess of abrupt intrusions. In retrospect that seems quite apt."

A hatch of sorts opens nearby, and a woman carefully pulls herself out. She's attractive, after a fashion, with wild hair and violet eyes. She's carrying a jug of something in one hand; the particulars of it are answered quickly when she staggers to her feet and drunkenly attempts to approach the welcoming party. "S-sure nice of you to get around to it," she slurs in Old Realm. "Another triumphant landing!"

"**I**... am Katya Ken! Mistress of ... of ... this big golden thing!" she shouts to the world. Behind her, a man's face appears from the hatch. "We're alive," he mutters, also in Old Realm.

"A wonder that is, too, with her steering," Morgan cracks, in the same tongue.

"You!" Katya drapes herself across Morgan, slipping close. "I will have you know that I - **I** - am the goddess of..of... " She pauses to breathe out, and Morgan gets a whiff of an extremely potent beverage. "Rude awakenings? No, arrivals! I'm very rude! And I'm doing my job!"

"This is hardly the majestic greeting I anticipated," mutters Charity. She catches the translations from Carbon and shakes her head in disbelief.

The man extracts himself and walks unsteadily toward Morgan. "I'm Sels Burgundy, protector of the goddess," he says, giving a queer sort of gesture which must pass for a salute.

Morgan nods to the individual. "I'm Andrew Morgan. I'm not in charge, but I seem to be the one doing the most talking, which some people seem to think is the same thing. So! Are you ready to give us a tour? We're going to need to come up to speed on this thing pretty quick."

"Yes, of course. Ranapura is your responsibility now. Katya Ken will be working with you, and myself and the rest of the Burgundy heirs will be available as well." The man gestures toward the hatch. "Oh yes. We also have a few travelers we discovered in the Wyld during our transit. Solars, and stranger things. You'll want to meet them, I'm sure."

Benford is acutely aware that a hundred cameras are focussed on this very event, and imagines that he can hear fighter jets approaching in the distance. "This isn't what I'd expected for first contact either, but... what the hell. Neil Armstrong blew his lines." He picks Lexi out of the crowd and waves her over. The young woman is juggling a camcorder with a cell phone conversation in rapid-fire Russian. "Congrats," he says. "You get to film the inside of the alien ship."

Morgan pauses before joining Sels, turns around to the Gaian Exalted. "Everyone here who speaks Old Realm, raise your hands! You're going to be translators until we can all learn some more languages." Singling out the relevant individuals, he directs people to form small groups around them.

In short order, Charity and the other Lunars are gathered around Carbon. They talk in whispers, fortunately able to rely on English to communicate. It's clear that the elder Lunar is doing some very quick teaching. A few moments later, Charity has half the Lunars with her and the others are with Carbon. Turning to her new found pack of Luna's Chosen, Charity has little to add. "We have to learn from each other, and quickly. For now, we will go to the armories and prepare ourselves for war."

The activities of the Lunars catch the attention of others. Those of the Dawn Caste and the Chosen of Mars are of like mind. The consensus seems to be that it's time to get armed. Heavily armed.

Benford understands Jet's intent, and tries to get Katya and Sels to focus. "The world's eyes are on us, and the eyes of our enemies. Please take us to the control center of this place. Somewhere with communications and... um..." He tries to think of a way to phrase it in Old Realm. "Watchdogs. Defense grid. That sort of thing."

"Yeah, I'll--" Katya is rudely interrupted by Sels, who gently slides her away from Morgan and off to the side. "I'll keep her busy," he explains. "My brother will show you the way. Just go down inside, you'll find him."
