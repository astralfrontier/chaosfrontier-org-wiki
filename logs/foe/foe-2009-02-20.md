# Fall of Eden 2009-02-20

There is an entire extended family aboard the city-ship Ranapura: the Burgundy clan by name. They are Dragon-Blooded of all types, and seem to be comprised of at least eight distinct ethnic origins. They divide themselves by elemental aspect into 'guilds', each guild occupying one of the five major wings of Ranapura.

Earth's Celestials are introduced to a few of them. Sels Burgundy, the "mayor" of Ranapura, has already met the group. His brother Nall, taller and with darker hair but the same face and eyes, is constable, overseeing security.

The command center of the city is in the center. It is a vast cathedral, easily the size of a major sports stadium, with a dais at the center and curved pews ringing the outer walls. A shaft of light illuminates the dais at all times. From here, Nall explains, authorized personnel may direct the operation of Ranapura simply by commands and prayer to the host of spirits and intelligences which inhabit the city.

Five corridors lead outward from this central location, terminating in spiral staircases which lead to the different levels and wings of the city. There are floors devoted to urban concerns such as shops and living areas; floors devoted to the storage of arms and materiel, as well as occult supplies, and so forth.

Benford takes all this in. "So not only did the Deliberative send a city, they sent inhabitants... but I wonder. Where are the Children? The two that we spoke to before? And may we have access to the ... umm ... detection systems? Sensors? Your arrival was very public."

"The children? Oh, Davron's. Yes." Nall smiles. "Those are simulacra - not his real children. They're part of the city, and you can speak to them if you wish. Ranapura can fully engage with its surroundings." He waves a hand, and the cathedral is suddenly bathed in blinding light. When it fades, Benford can see himself and the others as though they were standing in midair - beyond them is the beach, and beyond that is Tijuana. It's as though the city itself and everything in it had become transparent.

A momentary wave of vertigo washes through Benford; the actual ocean is hundreds of feet below, and helicopters circle the city at a respectful distance. "Oh, wow... well, I'm sorry we left you sitting out in space so long. Did the Deliberative give any particular instructions for this day?"

"Here." Nall gestures, and a vision of a humanoid figure appears on the dais before Benford and the others.

"I have no words of wisdom," the figure says to the assembled throng. "You gathered yourselves together. You called down the city through insight and cooperation. If you have the wisdom to use its power, there is nothing I should say to guide you. If you lack it, then the problem will soon resolve itself."

"The city is yours now. You know your needs better than I. It will serve you well, whatever those needs may be."

Benford notes that many of the Celestials - those not specifically tasked with finding the arsenal - have filtered into the room. The dais is the obvious center of power, both symbolic and literal; and yet nobody is moving towards it. Benford taps Morgan on the shoulder. "Shall we call this meeting to order?"

President-Elect Obama's beeper has been going off. "I think we have some news. Some very bad news, ladies and gentlemen," he says after a few minutes of consultation with his mobile device, and with one of the Secret Service agents assigned to him.

"The Assembled," Morgan guesses. "They can't possibly ignore something as big as this. What are they doing?"

"I.." Obama's voice quavers. "I'm being told that... I don't believe this." The Russian Lunar, Mirya, closes her phone and speaks in halting English where the Chicago politician pauses. "The Russian nuclear arsenal. Moscow has lost control of it." She glances at Obama. "I assume the Americans have told you the same."

Morgan pales and is silent for a moment. "I'll say this much for them," he says finally, in a strangled voice. "They don't go in for half measures." He shakes his head. "Okay, Benford. How would _you_ hack into the whole world's nuclear arsenal at once? If you were an Alchemical? And more importantly... where would you be to do it?"

Benford grimaces. "Yeah, just about saw THAT coming. And... anywhere in the Lands of Light. Physical access wouldn't be necessary. So... Hypatia, do we have LoL access from here?"

The symbiote flickers into existence for all - through the power of the city, no doubt - and shakes her head. "No, there isn't," she responds.

_Wait._ The voice is a bass rumbling. Then a massive tremor almost sends everyone to the ground. The city's entire infrastructure is trembling, and Benford can feel it moving. More to the point, he can feel a tremendous rush of something in the air. It gives him a feeling of hunger, it makes him horny, it sends red shooting stars and the indescribable thrill of life through the back of his head. It's poetry and beauty and love, and he can see the others are feeling it too. It's Essence, but more than he has ever experienced.

The vision of Tijuana vanishes. In its place, the walls of the cathedral are shifting themselves into new configurations. _Proceed,_ the voice declares, and Hypatia smiles. "Yes, that did it. Whatever that was."

Morgan blinks. "O-kay. Ranapura just punched a hole into the Lands of Light by main force. We're getting somewhere. Now, time for an announcement." In Old Realm: Then: "Attention, all Exalted. Ranapura is under nuclear attack. Everyone with an Engine and any familiarity with the Lands of Light, we will shortly be entering to halt the attack at its source. Anyone else, please find any resources aboard Ranapura that can halt a nuclear attack by conventional means. Thank you."

Benford says, "'Whatever?'" Benford mutters breathlessly. "Jesus on a pogo stick, that was intense. Hypatia, Marlene needs to be part of this but as far as I know she doesn't have an engine, so please bind to her for the time being. As for me..." He singles out Obama and Usama. The senator looks a little confused, the terrorist looks grim and excited. "I have a job for you two."

Now that the flows of Essence are so strong, those Exalted who have studied magic realize the nature of the 'access points'. They are places which channel Essence in specific configurations, drawing power from an underlying source and shaping it according to the needs of the architect. The power source is information. And the architecture that shapes it is more properly known to the occultists of Creation as a _Manse_.

Shortly after the message a group of heavily armed and grim warriors burst into view. Charity is at their head and orders are flashing along the column quickly. "You have military experience, you will organize the defense," she says to a titanic man. "The night caste and changing moons will follow your lead. As for me, I'm going into the sky to take these things on." One of the strangers leans close to whisper to Charity and the Lunar nods, "Yes, absolutely. Now let's see what the others are doing."

Benford leads the two men, followed by Agent Schroeder. Lexi hurries behind with a camcorder, which suits Benford's purposes just fine. He speaks quickly. "City, lead me to Davron's laboratory, or whatever he'd use if he were here. Now, you two, follow me. There's good and bad news here. The bad news is, every nuclear missile on Earth is heading our way, and that's bad for obvious reasons. The good news is, either way, there won't be any more nuclear missiles on Earth in a few hours. So I'm going to deal with that problem."

Discs of light flicker into existence at Benford's feet, as well as near the others who are apparently with him. "Good luck," smiles Nall.

Benford pauses before stepping on the disk. "After that, all we have to deal with is our petty differences and old feuds, and one in particular. That's where you come in." He points to Obama. "This man is Barack Hussein Obama, senator from Illinois, recently elected the forty-fourth president of the United States, and Solar of the Zenith Caste."

He points to the other man. "This is Osama bin Laden, who has at various times been freedom fighter and ally of America, and its most wanted criminal, recently freed from Alchemical torture, and Lunar of the Half-Moon Caste."

"I tell you this because we have a common and incomparable enemy," Benford continues. "Bury the hatchet between east and west, or Autochton will bury it in our collective heads. I want this war to be _over_." He steps onto the disc and vanishes.

An assortment of individuals file into the cathedral as Benford departs. They are less martially impressive than Charity's army, but many of them, like Morgan, would be instantly recognizable, either by their face or their byline, by anyone who'd ever read a newspaper or watched TV. Those that are anonymous are deliberately so - either by their own effort or by the Sidereal Arcane Fate - and yet their works would be equally recognizable. Of Solars, most are Eclipse or Zenith, with a handful of Night or Twilight; Lunars mostly fall under No Moon; and Sidereals, less Chosen of Mars and more of Mercury or Jupiter. They are warriors in the realm of ideas, and the Lands of Light is their natural battlefield.

Morgan says, as they take seats for their bodies to reside as their souls journey.

_I will,_ declares Raven.

Morgan sinks into a seat. "Our first goal, folks, is to find how the Alchemicals compromised the world's nuclear arsenal, and then see if there is any way to undo it. If we do succeed in finding them, we can expect stiff resistance from the Alchemicals themselves. Our plans will need to remain flexible as events dictate." He closes his eyes. "Let's do this."

From the other side, Ranapura looks very different, and yet the same. It resembles the information-scape of the other cities of the world, but is subtly alien in many ways - the idea of 'magic', in particular, is far more prominent, as its inhabitants are accustomed to such a world. Morgan regards his fellows. "Okay. First step - the hunt. You all have your own ideas about how to find the aggressors, so I will let you explore them. I will explore the connection between target and targeter. The missile targeting systems have this place fixed in their mechanical minds, and this means there is a recently formed connection between the idea of 'the site of Ranapura' and 'the target of a nuclear missile'."

A map appears in the nothingness of the Lands of Light, with a ring of concentric circles targeted around Ranapura. "This is the idea of Tijuana's location," Morgan says. "Let us see what is connected to it. Raven, can you relay messages between us if we split up? And for that matter, what other assistance can you provide?"

_I walk in the world of gods and spirits,_ Raven replies. _My eyes are the sun and the moon. It is gods that possess the weapons you seek, and it is gods which you must exorcise, shaman. I will support you._

Morgan smiles. "These gods - gods of design and artifice - have stolen thunder and lightning from their rightful owners. This is right out of one of your stories, Raven. Let us go." And although there is no physical movement in the Lands of Light, Morgan's mind races along the spiderweb of connections to Tijuana's location. It is a bewildering tangle at first, for it includes every airline flight into Rodriguez International Airport, every carload of college students heading down to party, and much of the mortal news media - after all, the Exalted of Tijuana have been much in the news lately.

Morgan must apply his skills as a reporter here - exclude irrelevant connections, follow up leads, bluff or boast his way past barriers. And he must do it quickly. Ironically, barriers are his first sign he is getting close, for the ideas of national security and secrecy are manifested here as well, and they are particularly thick around anything to do with nuclear weapons. But mortal secrecy is no match for the Exalted.

Benford arrives in... an empty room. The cube shape and white plastic walls look familiar, and for a moment he wonders if something has gone wrong. And then it makes sense: the most powerful artificer in Creation didn't build things by shovelling atoms around, he just changed the nature of the essence around him to fit his design. "The ultimate holodeck," he chuckles. "Very well. City, our threat is primarily airborne. Show me a summary of devices on hand for interdicting flying opponents at extreme distance." A book - or at least the image thereof - obediently materializes in the air before him and flips through several pages. One catches Benford's eye. "Pause. Oh, wow... Get Cam up here," he grins. "And tell Jet that we're going to get our own air force."

Cam arrives though a glowing disk; and Benford is waiting with a rack of wing-shaped devices. "I'm going to keep this short," he says, fiddling inside one with an unfamiliar tool. "We only have a few of these. Most beings on Earth are too Essence-poor to power them. There are a few exceptions to that rule. You're one of them. Now if you'd be so kind as to activate your battle-form?"

Charity follows behind Cam quickly, "You got me hooked up with a taxi?" she asks. On her hands are a pair of strange looking gauntlets. She flexes a fist and it starts to glow with the heat beyond that of mortal forges. "I admit I haven't quite figured out exactly how I'm going to deliver the fires of hell to them yet.."

Benford fits the wings to Cam's gleaming quicksilver form and steps back. Metal flows over and into the access ports on the device, and the engines hum with latent power. "There's something missing," Benford mutters.

"Aesthetics," Cam says simply. Benford nods, and looks at Charity. "Somewhere between Charity, and the Maker." He snaps his fingers, and a glowing panel appears in mid air. Benford draws on it wit his hand. "Let's make this fast. As soon as someone launches we won't have time to breathe."

Charity isn't sure what is meant at first, and looks uncertainly at Benford and then to Cam. She steps forward and allows Cam's form to encase her. She can feel the shifting of Cam's moonsilver body all about her and for a time she floats in this. It is not the way of a Full Moon to sit about. Essence weaves and churns and in its flow Charity can start to hear the chaotic pulse of the Wyld.

Benford's weaving grows ever more complicated, until Charity cannot sense the patterns at all. Her mind grows silent, and she waits. To her, it seems to drag on forever and then she senses the urging of the tiger in her soul. Immediately she drives essence through her form, embracing her war form at the very moment of harmony between her own soul, the flowing moonsilver, and the underlying designs of the Great Maker.

What reports the Exalted can obtain suggest that nuclear command & control systems have been compromised by now. Missiles haven't yet launched - perhaps because of readiness issues, perhaps because the Alchemicals are simply waiting before pushing the button. But a full launch could conceivably happen at any time.

Time dilates at moments like this. Everyone understands that the conflict is inevitable, and nobody shys from it. Each minute is another lifetime, each breath another battle won.

Life right now is about defense in depth. The first line of defense is Morgan's corps of hackers. Celestials infiltrate communication systems, spreading Raven across the Earth on etheral, invisible wings.

The next line of defense moves from cyberspace to outer space. The apex of an ICBM's trajectory is about four hundred miles up. Some of Ranapura's weapons have that kind of range, but there's not a lot of power to run them, so the gun crews have been instructed to aim carefully and sparingly.

The third line of defense is up close and personal. Jet and Cam and a handful of other fliers wait on Ranapura's main deck. The city projects tracking data into the air, to keep them up to date. So far the skies are clear, as are the seas - submarine missiles are a much more proximate threat.

The final line of defense originates in the old lab. Benford has two ideas: spread debris into low orbit to destroy inbound missiles in collisions and cause an 'ablation cascade'. Unfortunately, this will have the side-affect of destroying any new sattelites launched for the next hundred years.

The other option is far less subtle. With the tools on Ranapura at his disposable, Benford might be able to bend the laws of physics, particularly those related to nuclear decay. Any nuclear reaction in the area of effect would just fizzle. This is the option where he concentrates his energies; the defense of last resort.

As he works, he dictates a prayer to Raven. It is inevitable that this news will leak, and he feels compelled to make a statement. "Hugh and Helios, Maker and Gaia, hear my prayer, and let it find the ears of those who need comfort on this most difficult day. Men such as I sought power and knowledge in the heart of the atom. Instead, we engineered the means of our own extinction. Today, let the light of our wisdom at last dispel Trinity's shadow. Amen."

Charity receives the word from the city that the attack has begun. She and the other defenders simply cannot wait to see the missiles. Instead they go to meet them in the sky. Cam rockets the Full Moon upward. Charity's sector is to the northwest, where the payloads of hundreds of nuclear silos and submarines will soon be found. To her left and right Dragon Blooded of the Air Aspect ascend, serving as wingmen.

Charity has never seen a real missile up close. They're big and they move damn fast. Before she gets her first vision of one an eagle eyed archer below lets fly a bolt of pure essence that rushes by. It strikes home and with a brilliant explosion claims the first victory for the besieged line.

The wait isn't long. Charity can see them, her senses straining for any clue of an attack. She waits with something resembling patience for the order. The voice of her chosen father comes at last, ordering her to attack. For just a moment it brings to her mind a flickering reel of ten thousand battles, some won, some lost, a few where she's quite certain she died.

That sight disappears as the Lunar plunges into combat. Her hands burst into flame, heating so greatly that the very air hisses around them. With a growl she puts her fists through the metal frame of a nuclear weapon. The delicate circuitry melts instantly, shorting out and losing all power.

Cam controls the flight now, directions changing quicker than any mortal could survive. "So many," growls Charity. There simply isn't time to carefully punch as she had been. Instead Cam races broadside into the targets. Charity stretches out her frame, willing her body to become even more tightly bound to the armor. The moonsilver flows about her once more and soon the forge-hot fists of the Full Moon serve as a battering ram, punching through missiles in an explosion of sparks.

There are an estimated 14,000 nuclear missiles in the world. Ranapura's guiding intelligences are tracking 9,727 independent projectiles, with a few hundred more every minute. Many are small and fast, launched from nuclear submarines in the Pacific Ocean. These move laterally, streaking over the water. And when they arrive in the proximity of Tijuana waters, they meet a man who has little patience for such things. Standing on the prow of the _Sun's Messenger_, hefting a golden blade as large as he is, a Solar of the Dawn Caste defends the oceans which are so iconic to his nature. A missile streaks directly at him, its speed unthinkable - and he twists the blade in his hands. There is an explosion which rocks the waves and sends up a concentric series of tidal waves in the ocean below.

Benford, on his monitors, can see the detonation, knows it's a nuclear blast. But there's no radiation, only concussion, and that only seaward - the swordsman's hair blows lightly in the sea breezes, and he smiles contemptuously.

"Impossible," Benford cries, but his hands fly over control panels anyway. Implicit in the event is proof that the detonation can be diverted and controlled. Benford works to infer the principle behind Ryushi's nuclear parry, should another warhead get that close.

"What are you doing?" Sels asks from behind Benford, then gleans his intent. "Ahh. Heavenly Guardian Defense, they call that Charm. You don't know it already?"

The actions of Ryushi do not go unnoticed by his fellow "kinetic" guardians. Carbon's voice roars over the wild chaos. "Solars!" he bellows as he perches on top of missile. He reaches down into the scalding heat of the engine, crippling it and sending his missile spinning off course. "Everything comes.."

Two horrible explosions ring out, forcing Carbon to fall silent for a moment as his missile steed rips through one and then shatters on a second missile. "Easy to them!" he finishes. As he falls towards the waves his arms whip forward with unnatural speed, throwing a huge chunk of the missile's frame into yet another incoming bogey, reducing it to a rain of chaff.

"This world is starved of Essence," Benford quips. "We've had to make do. Now, what was that name again?" He opens the source code to the power plant controls... if he can emulate the effect, then their problems are solved.

Meanwhile, in the Lands of Light, Morgan is intent on a promising trail, when another Solar streaks by him in the other direction. "I already looked there - wait, who are you?" The vision is of a young lad, self-confident and light on his feet, the unfilled circle of Night glimmering on his brow. The boy laughs merrily. "You're such a huge square, you know that? Don't you know a busted lock when you see one?" Morgan bridles. "I beg your pardon. When I was in college-" "Pfft! You and your fancy book-learnin. Look here." The boy rushes off, and it is all Morgan can do to keep up.

When they arrive, it's at something that looks to Morgan's eyes much like a military institution of some sort. Morgan had noted it but passed it by - but now that his attention has been called to it, Morgan notices the padlock on the gate has a hairline crack in the shackle. Someone has already broken through this institutional barrier - which, in the physical world, is probably the data security system of a missile control center nexus - maybe just one silo, maybe NORAD itself, maybe something in between.

"Incredible. How'd you spot that?" The lad laughs. "Mister, I've broken into places guarded ten times better than that. Hey, this Engine thing is really something, eh? Glad I could borrow one. Almost made it worth coming to this godforsaken Essence desert of yours in the first place. Hope your women are hot." The kid slips through the gate ahead of him, leaving Morgan to call to Raven and draw more reinforcements.

By the time Morgan and three other Solars have ventured inside, the lad reappears - as if from nowhere. "There's at least five dudes in there. Mean lookin' too. Never laid a thought on me. Oh good, you've brought the cavalry. Let's go." "Wait!" calls Morgan. "Who _are_ you?" The lad grins. "They call me Tanuki. Now c'mon, we've got some machine ass to kick."

The stream of missiles is getting thicker. Every round of missiles pushes Charity farther back, and soon she finds her airspace is overlapping with Carbon and half a dozen Dragon Blood supporters. Tokugo's coordination makes their work seamless, but the line falls back under the endless strain, and soon even more allies are weaving about and firing in Charity's shrinking sector.

Charity and the others have been exerting themselves, physically and magically. Sore muscles and fatigued souls are making themselves felt. But as the missiles come, something else is coming to them - a strange feeling of potency, of hope, a palpable sensation of support. It fills the air.

Katya Ken, the goddess, is most attuned to it. She appears abruptly in Benford's work area - appropriately enough for her - and smiles. "You feel it, right?" she asks of the laboring scientist. "They're praying for you. All of them out there. Everywhere."

Benford steps away from the terminal. His hands are trembling, and his voice is shaky. "I do feel it," he whispers, and starts to weep. "There are not words to describe what it means to be the hero," he croaks, and grasps the terminal again. "I shall not fail them."

Charity has reached out in prayer before, and though she is not as well trained in matters of occult as others, she remembers that sensation. Now she feels what it is like to be on the other end. It dawns on her suddenly that these weapons won't just destroy Ranpura. They will kill everyone on the planet. "They would extinguish all light if they cannot have it all for themselves," she cries out. She plunges headlong through a rocket, the frame erupting around her. "You will not slay my children before they are born!" A rocket's fin is ripped free and thrown with the force of a cannon, breaking across one missile and ripping through two more. "WE WILL NOT FAIL!" Her caste mark explodes with brilliance and her anima banner bursts into a new light, no longer torn aside like a frail curtain but holding its own. Explosions of essence fill the air as the defenders hold nothing in reserve. The line will not fall back any farther.

Tanuki proves to be quite the spotter, but eventually a disturbing sign begins to appear in the military installations that the Assembled hacked into. "That's the third one so far," says Tanuki. "They've left already. See? They've left tracks coming and going. You want to go in?" Morgan shakes his head - he looks tired, and his self-image seems tattered from the conceptual attacks by the defending Assembled. "Not much point. It'll be like the last two. The missiles were already launched, and they're already in the ballistic phase. Their course is already set for Ranapura. We might as well go back to the physical world and touch base with the others."

But before they can leave the Lands of Light, they must overcome one more obstacle. Now that the missiles have been launched, the Assembled are surrounding Ranapura. They evidently cannot enter - the presence of Katya Ken and the other spiritual defenses of Ranapura obstruct them - but they nevertheless gather outside, perhaps to manifest outside and mount some kind of physical attack. Regardless of their intentions, they effectively block the re-entry of the Celestials.

Even as Morgan's allies approach, though, they too can feel the Essence of the world's prayers coursing through them, renewing their frayed souls. "Break their line! Raven, sow confusion - cover our approach until the last moment! Then we strike them with every drop of our spirit! For Gaia and Hugh! Charge!" And with the power of humanity behind them, the Celestials fight their way through the besiegers - courage is not only their aid, but their literal weapons, and their faith in humanity their literal shields.

Arrows rip past Charity, coming thick as rain. A vision of Carbon's snarling face flashes by as he alights on the racing Full Moon and leaps away a fraction of a second later. Tokugo can no longer direct from the rear. He appears in the sky in the full glory of an unveiled Dawn Caste. His sword shatters rockets in scores, and all about him a circle of Dragon Blooded do their work. All the while, in the minds of the Celestials dance dreams of being here before. Again they are arrayed in battle against a hated Primordial. There is no fear in the face of hopeless odds, but instead a building focus and a sense of inevitability. This is the very purpose for which they were made, after all.

The number of yellow dots on Benford's tracker is getting uncomfortably large. Unfortunately, the Alchemicals can do the math, and a hell of a lot of missiles are going to get through. "Even if we live, the ecological consequences are too awful to contemplate," Benford mutters. "Okay. Plan B."

In Tijuana, men and women are on their knees in the streets. The news is blaring on every television set, shouting in five languages the facts that these citizens can see in the distant sky for themselves. Throughout the crowds, a little girl gives hugs and cookies to the shocked spectators. In Los Angeles, and in New York, Americans are seeing their vaunted nuclear arsenal really in use. It terrifies and galvanizes them, and words spring unheard to their lips as they stand in the streets and offices and shopping malls and homes.

In Britain, a couple watch the telly tensely, their hands gripping each others'. In Seattle, another couple likewise afford themselves mutual comfort. A crowd of punked-out Houston girls and unshaven bikers are controlling the bar at a sleazy dive. A worried mother clasps her two worried daughters. A sandy-haired professor takes off his glasses, rubs his nose, and whispers words he never thought he would ever utter: "gods keep them safe."

The world's arsenal of death descends on one place, at one moment. And everyone - _everyone_ - utters the same prayer to those Chosen who defend themselves and their domain from annhilation: "Don't give up."

Benford finishes a program, a 'Ryushi Emulator' of sorts. Rather than waste valuable Essence on the full Charm, he's emulating a very small piece of it. Vary the Strong Nuclear Force a little bit in either direction, and many nuclear reactions - even the fundamentals of chemistry - just stop.

In observing Ryushi, Benford realizes that even his basic assumptions about physics are just a convenience. If he needs to vary a physical constant, all he need do is ask politely. In this case, he'll be asking with the terawatt-capacity generating plant in Tijuana, just a few miles away. Each particle beam is a small temple to the Sun; each will play a note in a song that will dampen any primal force of which He does not approve. Benford downloads the program into his laptop and waits, finger on the proverbial button.

Benford's mathematics are proving right in practice. The net tightens but the battle is a losing one. A pair of rockets manages to slip past the reach of Tokugo's blade. Carbon is able to catch one with a missile fragment but the second slips past. "CHARITY!"

Hearing her name even through the din of constant explosions, the Full Moon wheels about, twisting her path through two more missiles as she races for the bogey. Cam's voice murmurs in her mind, "We aren't going to make it!" Charity grits her teeth and growls, "I have it." The bindings between her and Cam start to sever and her hands pry free.

The sensors in Ranapura go off. The fusion reaction is beginning. Charity rips free of Cam and winds her arms around the missile. Her hands plunge into the core of the bomb, and she clutches the reacting mass to her chest. Her hands tighten, sealing everything in. The gloves glow red hot, then white, then they outshine the sun itself as the nuclear explosion strains against a miracle of the Age of Wonders.

Changing the laws of physics is more than just a matter of power, or even of Essence. Leverage is key. As soon as Benford is able to explain his program to Morgan, the reporter directs another sortie into the Lands of Light. This time, they have but one task: aid Benford's program. The laws of physics, after all, are also ideas - extremely powerful and rigid ideas, but ideas nonetheless. Benford's mechanism is going to locally persuade the universe to change its mind about some of those ideas for a moment... and when that happens, Morgan and his comrades will be there, lending their own Essence to assist in the persuasion.

For the Essence locked in a Celestial Spark represents an extraordinary amount of energy, even when expressed in joules - and of course, it can do things that mere joules cannot. "Just give the word, Raven," Morgan says. Hands are merely a convenience of representation, but whatever Morgan has in the place of hands are braced on the construction Benford has built onto the side of the strong nuclear force. On Raven's signal, everyone will _push_.

The Celestial 'air force' has fought to the last ditch. Even as Charity literally strangles warheads with her bare hands, a single rocket slips through - an antiquated Soviet model with six warheads of twenty megatons each. Such a thing could kill a city of millions; right now all its powered is focussed on Ranapura.

And in turn, all of Ranapura's power, and in a real sense the power of all the world, is focussed on that last weapon. When it reaches an altitude of just six miles up, Benford runs the countermeasure program.

The effect is first visible in the Lands of Light, where it manifests as a thousand beams of light. Their interplay describes a giant, pyramidal temple with the Sun at its golden apex.

In an eyeblink later, the same structure appears in the skies over Baja California; the beams converge on the incoming missiles. The image continues even as the bombs continue to fall.

There's a tense minute as the warheads approach their air-burst altitude... and a palpable sigh of relief as they pass right through it. A moment later they crash into the sea with no more significance than a giant stone.

Dud warheads fall all over Ranapura and Tijuana. Some crush houses and crater in fields, and yes, there are probably fatalities. But the moment of panic passes when the survivors realize that the bombs are not exploding. The fact is not lost on the news crews that have become a permanent fixture in Tijuana.

The work of the Solars comes not a moment too soon. Charity's eyes are locked on her hands as she plummets towards the waters. She knows little of these weapons, but she remembers that water might contain the radiation, if she can hold that long. The wondrous gauntlets forged by solars in ages past do their part, and just as they begin to fail the great pyramid appears above and Charity throws her hands open. Instead of the engulfing flame she expects streamers of purest light flow up through the waters and into the Sun.

And in the Lands of Light, Morgan and his allies literally feel the pillars of the world move beneath their hands, and as the pyramid of light erupts around them, they know they have succeeded. "You know, it's funny," murmurs Morgan. "I protested for banning nuclear weapons in college. Who'd have thought I would someday be in a position to help ban them from reality itself?"

Scarely three hours after the thing began, it's done. The Celestials and their allies gather in the central cathedral. The natives of Ranapura are strangely nonplussed. "There were the ultimate mundane weapons," Benford explains to Sels Burgundy. The dragon-blooded general shrugs. "If these were mere artifacts of man, why were you so worried?"

Morgan's body stirs as he emerges from the Lands of Light. "Where's Charity?" he immediately asks; Ranapura obliges by bringing up the tactical display and indicating a particular silvery-white dot at the edge of the perimeter, partially submerged. Morgan jumps to his feet and threads his way through the city, toward the water.

Charity's hand shoots up out of the water just as Morgan arrives. As he pulls her from the water he can notice the strange pattern that has been tattooed into her hands and arms--all that remains of the gloves. "Thanks!" She beams at Morgan and adds, "Do all Solars have timing like that? And what _was_ that thing, anyway? I was about to become a pretty little cloud of soot."

Benford agrees that Sels may be right. Everyone seems no worse for the wear, and everyone seems at a loss as to what to do next. They fought World War Three... so now what?

For the moment, the Celestials agree on two actions. The first is to organize under the name of the Deliberative. The second is to make a brief statement to the press and governments: 'We would consider it a personal favor if all humans engaged in hostilities would suspend them."

And so on the day after World War Three began and ended, it came to pass that no shots were fired anywhere man trod.
