November, 2009. Mirya is gone, back home to Russia. Her explanation, translated, amounted to: "some bad boys are about to try and be very naughty, and will have to be spanked".

It's probably for the best - now that the old Soviet Union's ICBMs have been very publically launched and Russia has no further usable reserves of nuclear weapons, catastrophic consequences may be in store.

Publishers have been vying for the rights to the life stories of any Exalted they can find. The cult of celebrity is beginning to tighten its noose on Tijuana.

The Americans are due up to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom - the most distinguished award a civilian can receive from the American government. Sir Newton Benford, already knighted, has received a similar offer: induction into the Most Noble Order of the Garter, the pinnacle of the United Kingdom's honors system.

For some, the thought of getting acknowledged with a medal is a bit harder to grasp. Before Charity can even consider accepting she has to gently inquire about certain questions of law and deal with a tsunami of fan mail. Amongst this one piece stands out. Apparently the stunt that nearly killed her made it on the cover of both Maxim and News Week. "This is ludicrous."

Ricky is slated for the Belisaro Dominguez Medal of Honor - Mexico's highest award. From the sound of it, there has been considerable political jockeying behind the scenes regarding which government is allowed to bestow which honors, due to the multinational nature of the Deliberative. In the end it seems nationality of birth won out.

Benford also has his favorite piece of fan mail, hand-delievered by John Beddington, chief scientific advisor to the British government. The whole letter is in the Queen's own hand on heavy-guage stationary fit literally for royalty. He's already framed it and hung it on the wall in one of Davron's old labs, which he's appropriated for his own use. "And we're just the most public figures because we gave our press conference. Well, except for the Senator of course." He chuckles. "Rarely do I allow myself to enjoy our victories. But today... well, did you hear?" He holds up a special issue of the 'Bulletin of Atomic Scientists', with its famous Doomsday Clock. The hands have been wound back to a symbolic 1am.

"They must only be counting nuclear destruction," replies Charity. "If they think the world is safe, well.. hopefully we can prove them right."

Morgan, to all apperances, is enjoying th e media attention immensely. His co-workers back at the Times used to comment that Andrew Morgan had the perfect face for newspapers; but of course this wasn't entirely fair, since it compared him with the polished and glamourous faces of TV anchors. Now, with his silver tongue and quick wit - and perhaps more importantly, undeniably legendary accomplishment - he has the press eating out of his hand.

As for what he _does_ with that attention - well, so far his message is short on specifics and long on positive emotion. As he hasn't had time to discuss with his fellow Celestials what the plan for the next phase of the Autochthonian War will be, his main goal is to promote confidence in the world community, that humanity is up to the challenge that the Assembled present. "We can do _anything_ if we put our minds to it," he says with perfect assurance - and for once, that boast is more than mere hyperbole.

Peter Kiernan is one of the many visitors that make it through the web of security and screening the Sidereals have erected. He has a gift for Morgan and the others. They are white plastic tags, easily worn around the neck or clipped onto something. They have the Superman symbol and the motto "Go Forward", and they are produced by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. "I thought you guys earned these," Mr. Kiernan explains with a smile as he delivers them.

Morgan remembers the vision that his avatars once showed him, and is delighted. "We are honored, Mr. Kiernan," he says. "I hope we will continue to live up to the exacting standards that these imply."

The first fruits of the challenge implicit in this gift are borne when Doctors Mokembe and Engel begin rifling through Ranapura's inventory, looking for Creation's equivalents of the spinner technology Engel used to synthesize organs. With any luck, treatment for paraplegics and quadriplegics can become a reliable reality soon.

Benford tours the flying city as well. There's room for thousands on board, though the Burgandys and their associates aren't nearly that numerous. He asks the Guild historians to tell him about Creation, the mythical otherworld of which they've heard much and seen little. In return, he tells them about life on Earth. The lack of free Essence elicits both wonder and pity from the listeners.

Despite all the fanfare that is going on, Charity remains undistracted. Sitting on the edge of the flying city and poring over some notes, she finds herself often turning her mind to the strangely beautiful remnants of her destroyed gloves. The wondrous artifacts not only saved her life, but have left their mark. In several spots the wisps of orichalcum meld smoothly into her tatoos. The suddenness of Marlene's words jerk Charity out of her reverie like a dousing of cold water, "You know, I don't think they're actually broken."

The Full Moon looks up slowly, confused that anyone could sneak up on her so easily. Marlene gives Charity no time to respond, "Obviously they are broken. I mean to say that they aren't destroyed." She reaches out, grabbing the hands of the baffled Lunar and peering at them, "Everything is essence, and in that way-" Charity speaks quickly to complete the thought, "Everything is alive."

It is Marlene's turn to look a bit confused, now. Charity goes on, more confidently, "It is essence. Unified in purpose, artifact of heroes and heroic act." Marlene nods quickly, "The gloves were destroyed, but their fundamental being has been grafted into you. The essence remaining in the physical artifact was consumed, but the essence of purpose, of intent, and even of capability seems to remain. It isn't going to be easy, but I am confident I can complete what has been started."

"It all seems much clearer now," Charity says gently. "The unifying principle. My children must appreciate through essence that the concept of living and dead matter is moot. There is only complexity, as revealed by awareness of the self and of existance in general to define what it means to be... I'm not even sure of the right word."

"The word is _sak-tuk_," the Man says, from out of nowhere. The Sidereal has arrived in his usual fashion: unobserved. "That's Old Realm. You learn a lot about a language by the meanings they ascribe to their short words."

Charity, for whatever reason, isn't as stunned at the sudden appearance of the Man. It's just that he is always like lightning from a clear sky to her. "I need to learn that language," replies the Lunar. "I have been thinking, and would appreciate advice. I believe that Sidereals have always been skilled advisors, and I don't care if you lack the guarantees of the stars. I trust you to tell me the truth." She wastes no time mulling the matter over, saying succinctly, "I am not sure it is wise that I accept a medal for heroism. I understand the actions we all took were inspiring and impossible for humans, but it feels.. backwards somehow."

"Why?" the Man asks.

"Because Luna gave me the only badge I need," replies Charity. "It is the heroism of mortals that we should be rewarding with medals. I feel like I am only being what I am expected to be, and that doing so deserves no accolades beyond creating the world we wish to bring about and protect. That is glory more than I deserve. To see my children come to be will be honor beyond any deeds I could complete."

The Man scratches his chin with his fingers. "Well... have you considered that them giving out this medal isn't for you, it's so they feel better?"

"I have," replies Charity. "But I wanted to hear it from others, honestly." She looks to the Sidereal and explains, "I have, as you know, a pretty questionable past with some very creative ideas of what was right and wrong. I need help repairing my moral compass, so to speak."

"So?"

"So whenever I feel something is questionable and yet find reasons for doing it, I'm going to seek advice," explains Charity. "So thank you. Do you think the medals are important to them?

"Of course." The Man takes out a cigarette, lifts it to his lips, lights it, and talks around it as it hangs there. "Listen. God came down to Moses, gave him the Ten Commandments. There's fire and tribulation and all kinds of crazy shit, but _people knew where they stood_ because the powers that be told them where that was." He gestures out toward the ocean. "Now you guys have dropped this shit on earth and fucked up everyone's program but good. Probably for the best, in the long run, but everyone's now dithering and saying 'god just came down, why hasn't he told us what to do.'"

"They want to know how they fit into your program, since you guys are what's going on. They just need to feel reassured of their place. They need comfort."

"So basically just go and do the ceremony, which reassures them that yes, all their bullshit still matters."

Charity smiles at the Man, "You are right." She climbs to her feet and nods, "I forget that to men, we are not just heroes, but the avatars of the Gods." She draws in a deep breath and releases it in a relaxed sigh. "I feel balanced now, and I see what I must do. They are desperate for meaning, and I will calm them." She reaches out to slide an arm around Marlene, "I want your help making my hands burn with the wrath of the Gods again. While you work, I will be writing my speech."

Sometimes, when you're prepared to die, the hardest thing to come to grips with is the fact of survival. Ironically, the nuclear attack has provided what the Senator would call a 'teachable moment', which the Celestials exploit. Since there are already Exalted from every corner of the world, it's easy to get audiences with the holders of temporal power. "A week ago, the most important thing in the world was the price of oil," Benford says at one point. "Now it's us. We can nudge the world now, and keep our hands off later."

Most of the plan was already outlined in the humanitarian briefing developed some weeks previous. Now that the will exists among the public to follow it, the Celestials can organize and advise from Ranapura while the mortals get both the heavy lifting and the ego boost. More valuable than that, though, is intelligence. The entire effort is co-ordinated via Raven terminals, manufactured by thousands in one of Ranapura's factory bays, at a bare smidgen of its Essence reserves. The same data can be used to ferret out Alchemical incursions... and perhaps find the real leaders of the invasion.

The nerve center of the operation is the Cathedral. Everyone spends a lot of time here; Benford rarely leaves. There's more dangerous things in the world than nuclear bombs. He will be ready.

While Newton works away on this task, Charity focuses on preparing herself. Night and day she practices, and when the day finally comes to travel to Washington to receive the honors she is fully prepared. Every detail has been seen to. With painstaking care Charity selected her words and with the help of Solars and the treasures of Ranapura she chose her clothing. "If I am the emissary of the Gods, I can hide no longer." Apparently that includes Newton, who is voluntold that he will be joining Charity and Morgan and any other American exalts on this journey.

This time, the flight to America is uneventful. Perhaps the Assembled are reeling from failure, or perhaps they are simply drawing back to bolster their defenses. Whatever the case, the Exalt find themselves stepping off a jet to a greeting unlike anything they've ever experienced. Reporters, screaming fans, and secret service agents engulf the airport.

Charity speaks gently to one of the members of security and without missing a beat steps directly into the throng. Her calm eyes survey the men and women in the crowd, pausing so that everyone within a hundred feet feels her gaze. Like a drop of water rousing a still pond her lips curve into a warm smile and her face reveals the joy that she cannot long conceal. Soft words impossibly cut through the noise and excitement in the crowd, "Thank you all so much for this kind greeting. We are honored."

The Full Moon kneels for a moment to speak with a child, then moves through the crowd. People do not press about her, but instead the whole surge of bodies parts in front of her, awestruck as the silver light of Luna pours out from Charity in all directions. "Please travel from here with care. Your lives are precious." With those loving words the exalts step into a waiting limousine and are whisked away.

The White House Lawn has been carefully prepared for the coming of the heroes. The crowd waiting there is itself breathtaking. What the million man march failed to do the coming of the exalted has achieved. The entire city is bursting with people straining to catch sight of their saviors. The flashing of cameras lights the way. The press corps. are interestingly populated with a lot of faces that Morgan will recognize as every station hopes to get a bit of special consideration from him. Newton's American colleagues are also present in numbers that are suspicious. It appears that those associated with Charity's past were not gathered here, for reasons that are perhaps understandable.

The only speaker chosen to preface the awards ceremony is former astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Now almost 80 years old and retired, he appears hale and hearty for his years as he approaches the podium.

"I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way." Aldrin smiles faintly. "That's just about what I said 40 years ago. I want to say it again to you all today."

"For.. for about fifty years, we were afraid that all this might just end itself. Generations of men and women struggled to keep the end at bay. I think only now can we really breathe out and say 'that great work is done'."

"We're only starting to learn the real power of those who brought this crisis down on us. But when I look at these young people, who've been so blessed by whatever higher power saw fit to preserve us, I tell myself that there's another great work we've just taken up. There's another war we must fight. There's another struggle toward peace. But, my friends and fellow travelers upon this great spaceship called Earth, I want to say this: let us give thanks that we made it this far."

"I hope you will join me in recognizing the talent, the dedication, and the humanity that our friends here today have shown. We owe them everything." He smiles quietly, nods his head, and steps down.

The President of the United States, George W. Bush, makes the formal presentation. Each of the recipients stands at the ready. George and his wife Laura stand at the podium. Protocol has long since been arranged.

"I uh, I wanted to say a few words. Both to my fellow Americans, and to you in particular, the Chosen." Bush speaks in his mellow, open voice, keeping back the lump in his throat which Morgan and Charity can spot. "I think in every great work, as Mr. Aldrin described it so beautifully a moment ago, the hand of man is destined to fail, while the hand of God will see things through. And in one day, something happened that no diplomacy ever achieved. It was a war that was started and ended in an afternoon. A war waged not against one nation, but against freedom."

"And the forces of freedom fought back. And they prevailed. And today, we are here to recognize that achievement. Both from our homeland's soil, but also the Chosen of Great Britain, and of Mexico, our neighbor to the south. From all around the world, these heroes put aside their fear. And they stood up for something greater than all of us. That's a chance for hope, and a chance for tomorrow. And today the United States sees fit to honor their courage, and their dedication, with the greatest award we can possibly bestow."

Through some strange, supernatural skill, when Charity steps forward to accept her award it seems to many in the audience that she appears out of thin air. She is dressed in long robes of purest white with strands of silver bells that chime melodicly with her every stride. The Lunar pauses to look out among the crowd. She sees hundreds of cameras and cell phones snapping pictures. No few of those on phones look frustrated as the circuits are hopelessly overloaded. Sensing an opportunity, Charity looks back to her friends and calls out, "Newton, could you please do something about their phones?"

Downtown DC is rarely so quiet. A soft 'caw' drifts across the masses assembled on Pennsylvania Avenue. It might have come from a solitary bird, save that it repeats a moment later from another point in the crowd.

The birdcalls spread, sowing mild confusion and amusement as the crowd realizes tha t the sound is coming from their mobile phones. The displays all show a Salish-style rendering of a black bird, over a waving American flag. Text scrolls across the raven: 'Our Tribute To Heroes'.

Bright lights shoot skywards from cell towers and rooftop antennas all over the city. Even though it's high noon in broad daylight on a cold, clear fall morning, the brilliant colors are as visible as if painted on the sky.

As one, the thousands assembled in the crowd gasp, turn, and point. The lights climb skyward, rippling like lasers and twining like rockets. The beams explode, racing from horizon to horizon, accompanied by crackling and thunderclaps. The display continues for a full minute.

The crowd catches on, and breaks out in applause and cheers, directly equally at the heroes and at the sky. At the crescendo, the beams converge above the White House in a hundred-foot high rendering of the raven and flag motif.

The image seperates into its component beams, which race back to the rooftops from which they came. The beams disappear back into towers and antennas, leaving a perfect, cloudless blue sky.

The display draws Charity's eyes and leaves her smiling out at the crowd. Those on phones now find no trouble connecting calls, and data soars at speeds that seem quite impossible. "Thank you Mister President, and thank you Newton and Raven. I believe everyone can send their pictures without difficulty now." A few soft chuckles sound out among the observers that confirm the notion. "My name is Charity, and I speak to you on behalf of the Chosen."

Charity's whole body bursts into light suddenly, leaving those in the crowd gasping as she unveils all her majesty. The silver disc upon her brow is captured and scattered by an array of diamonds so that she wears a crown of Luna's radiance. "For thousands of years, humanity has followed promises of a savior. We have all sought those who could deliver us from evil. To take away our shame and sadness and clothe us in the robes of righteousness."

"I tell you today that those promises are real." Charity raises her left hand and in a sweeping gesture includes those behind her in those words. "I tell you today that we were sent not to judge you, but to inspire you to acts of supreme courage and sacrifice. Though only some of us have received the gifts of the Gods I speak the truth; we are all Chosen!"

Her eyes will the crowd to stand with burning intensity. "Our path is not going to be an easy one." For a moment, her mask of strength and confidence grows heart-breakingly gentle. "My children," she intones softly, "Though I love you all I cannot promise we will shed no tears in the struggle to come. The Gods have sent us not to ensure a smooth journey, but only a happy ending."

Her voice gathers strength once more, and explodes over the crowd, "You all know that joy is dearly bought! Freedom and love are not the virtues of cowards, but of those with the spirits of champions! In the days to come, we will stand before you as heroes, we will stand between you and the darkness. We will face the very fires of hell's inferno. As we have been given life for you, we stand ready to die for you."

"Our enemies will not surrender you easily." Charity raises her hand, pointing a finger skyward. "They know that your strength is too great to overcome. They know that in the heart of every free person there is infinite potential. Beware quick and easy solutions! Flee from those who tell you to just leave everything to them, that you need not trouble yourself with any efforts. Oh, I know they can give you peace. The peace of the drone, the peace of slaves. I do not promise you peace!"

Charity lowers her hand, her stature softening, making her appear to have somehow become a foot shorter, and delicate as a rose. "At least not yet. Only when your enemies are driven back can there be peace once more, and a new beginning." Her smile changes, growing warmer, her eyes filling with a gentle love, "Remember that you are not alone. Soon a new star shall rise and my daughters and sons will be among you, to heal those who are sick in body or soul."

For a time, Charity looks over the crowd. They stand silent, all looking straight at her. She does not reflect on the oddity of having millions of eyes studying her every gesture and inflection, but finishes with soft words that carry as powerfully as thunder. "The Gods are with you, children of Earth. Their Chosen will not fail you. May Luna's light drive away the darkness as you tread the very threads of Destiny. It is you who will walk as titans in the end."

The Autochthonian agent that Benford would recognize as "Mr. Blank" is closeted with his superiors.

"Your primary mission failed," they say. The agent can give no objection to this point - its truth is self-evident. "However, one of our larger objectives has been achieved quite admirably. In addition, the removal of nuclear weapons as per your recommendation has increased the safety factors considerably."

"I'm to be terminated then?" the agent asks. There is no remorse, no feeling. Simply a request for information.

"Yes. Congratulations."

If the agent could form a smile of human satisfaction in its last moments, it would do so. And then it is done.
