# Fall of Eden 2009-03-20

December, 2008. Earth. The North American continent.

A world united behind its saviors and divided by its opinion of them. Whole nations have been told that the reasons for their hatreds are moot, yet nobody has told them what to hate in its place. Reasons to love and live have been shorn away by the simple eloquence of fact, and confronted by the inevitable reality beyond their self-selected veils, men and women are shielding their eyes from the light.

"All cities are geological. You can't take three steps without encountering ghosts bearing all the prestige of their legends. We move within a _closed_ landscape whose landmarks constantly draw us toward the past. Certain _shifting_ angles, certain _receding_ perspectives, allow us to glimpse original conceptions of space, but this vision remains fragmentary. It must be sought in the magical locales of fairy tales and surrealist writings: castles, endless walls, little forgotten bars, mammoth caverns, casino mirrors." So wrote a French philosopher, and so it is now.

Earth yearns to dream. The need for it wells up, a psychic tide waiting for the right moment to wash over the planet.

"It has become essential to provoke a complete spiritual transformation by bringing to light forgotten desires and by creating entirely new ones," the man wrote. A more modern philosopher rendered it thusly: "We'll get higher and higher, straight up we'll climb, we'll get higher and higher, leave it all behind - and in the end, on dreams we will depend, 'cause that's what love is made of."

The planet has weathered its crises well. The end of one age, the beginning of a new one, forced upon the cultures that cling desperately to the skin of the spinning globe by the circumstances of a celestial war, has not yet deprived humanity of its capacity for change.

The Exalted can feel this. Now, tonight, a few days before Christmas. The tectonic plates of North America feel like a gigantic surfboard atop the world's largest wave. The world is _moving_, and they can feel it. And answering the call of their own souls, something enormous surges toward the planet.

It's not physical motion of course. But it registers to their subtle senses in the same way: the old anchors have come loose, and their collective will is shifting them to a new place.

Slowly the planet spins in its cosmic pattern. The convergence of the Core aligns gradually with the greater truths of time, motion and rhythm. Like a switch forming a circuit as it's closed, the channels of Essence and those of Creation become harmonic. Power surges to Earth, and the Exalted feel it just as before. Now, they know much better what it means.

Truth comes with it. Essence in its purest form wipes away illusions, making truth from ephemera. And when imprinted with something, sufficient Essence cannot be denied. The Caste Mark is the simplest examle: a truth which invalidates attempts at imposture. Power has long been denied to the fragment of gods living in their souls, and as Essence illuminates that machine, each of them understands.

The Spark is evolving. Its time on Earth, the Essence conditions, and some indefinable other part of their experience has dislodged the nature of "flawless mechanism" that once defined the Spark. The impossibly complex blueprint that Benford experienced is slowly being invalidated. The Spark is rewriting itself. And in doing so, it reached out to Creation, to the Essence there, and began to call to it.

Waves of Essence, like a curtain or wall, are washing over the world. Nobody but the Chosen even seem aware of them. Behind one, a cadre of the Dragon-Blooded find the American Wild West. Behind another, crystal domes shield glittering cities of brass and steam. Essence from Creation is here, and the world's need for dreams is ready for it. Everywhere, it seems, the dreams of the planet are asserting themselves behind Wyld-like frontiers of magical energy. It is the planet's own immune system at work, somehow averting wholesale transformation of the landscape.

Here at last is enough magical power to challenge the Alchemicals. Energy enough to build the advanced devices the Celestials of old were familiar with, to employ them on the fields of battle, to change reality such that a cosmic force itself may be challenged and defeated.

Charity has waited and watched expectantly, her senses open for this moment. When she feels the first ebbs coming she calls together her family and her precious loved ones. That naturally includes Newton and Poe. She gives no specifics as to what it is that has her so excited, but it's clear that it's something beyond the waves of essence, something far more specific.

This extended family gathers on a misty hilltop that may or may not have even existed just hours before. Charity stands atop it, surrounded in 7,777 prayers written in the essence of people from all across the world who believed in her, who she quietly prepared for this day with her own vision and hope. It struck a chord in them.

But who are 'they'? Mostly those who know the hunger to have children well. The hopeless maids who never found the right man, the joyful grandmothers wishing to help a precocious young woman find her own dreams, and those living that dream now, half thrilled, half terrified by what is to come. Their voices all lifted in prayers that in the waves of essence ring out like a chorus in a valley that even now unfurls.

It is love that wheels about Charity now, and as her family joins her they, too, are brushed by its warmth. The Lunar says no words of greeting. Her focus is completely before her. She folds her hands together and drops of glinting blood fall from her wrists and elbows. They never touch the ground. Instead, they are caught in the whipping winds and lifted. They are not the only things in the air, however. Newton may recognize in the sudden swirl of air hundreds upon thousands of familiar notes. His own work that was to contribute to achieving Charity's dream. For a moment all of it mingles together, and then like a flowing rapids it bursts down into the valley below, shattering into hundreds of points of light that fly in all directions.

The wind stops for a moment, and then is filled with a sweet fragrance as it grows as gentle as the caress of a mother. The Full Moon rises and turns to her friends with a warm smile. "Come, I want us to go down in the valley and see what has happened. I want you to meet them." She holds out a hand to Poe and The other to Newton. "Please join me! If not for both of you, this day would never have come."

Morgan laughs merrily, more than a little drunk on Essence himself. To Charity, he says, "I'd follow you to the ends of the Earth - although at this point the gods alone know where those are. But where do you lead us now?"

Charity grins at Morgan and nods, "I'm glad to hear it! I like being chased." Her words are teasing, but she leads the way with such eagerness that Laura has to be scooped-up by Becca just to keep up. "We won't be going so far tonight, though," she promises.

As the family descends the slanted ground of the hill evens out slowly. Charity veers slightly to her right to follow a stream that bubbles down the hillside. The clear water turns to silver as Charity's caste mark is flooded with light. "Farther up and farther in!" she calls back joyfully, caring not a whit that they're still technicially racing down into the valley. As the dense woods begin to close in on all sides the sound of singing can be heard.

It is hard to keep track of time for most, but the Solars know regardless of the essence flows. The entire race deep into the valley lasts less than a half hour as a beautiful lake opens ahead. In its waters seven children are splashing and singing happily. Without pausing to find her footing Charity leaps into the waters with a cry of joyful recognition.

The children mind not a bit that someone has come to join them. As soon as Charity's head bobs up from the surface they welcome her in with a battery of happy splashing and laughter. Charity's family pauses for a moment, some of them recognizing what it is they are seeing, but only two have a clear idea of what to do. Ana and Laura are the first to kick off their shoes and jump into the water to join the fun. New playmates are definitely welcome in their eyes.

Morgan settles on the grass beside the lake, smiling. "I don't know where I've gotten to, but I'm in no hurry to click my heels three times."

The rest of Charity's family follow Ana and Laura into the water in short order, though Charity's mother opts instead to sit at the edge of the lake with her feet warming in the water. She teases Morgan, "So.. seven little ones all at once? Did my daughter deign to tell you her womb would have so much room?"

Morgan just shakes his head and grins. "She seems to have room in her heart for so much more... so why not?"

Benford marvells at the ecotopia, and can't help but be choked by the volume of emotion. He has seen the street tough that Charity was, and the mother of angels that she is. Most important is the sign of the tribe that will be. "A destiny flows forth from this place, and we must make it part of our future," he whispers. It is a testament to the power of family, a power ill-understood to Benford.

The joy of a family has lit Charity's path from the darkness to the light, and now she has seen it come full-circle. After some time, Charity settles on the edge of the lake next to her mother, watching the children play. The little ones seem to have no limit to their energy. "I have planted my seed in the fertile earth of Gaia, and I look to her and dear Luna to bless them and keep them strong."

When the children finally grow sleepy Charity calls them to her side. Her form shifts fluidly to that of the tigress and she lays herself down near a great tree in the wood, leaving plenty of room for her family to rest their heads on the warmth of her fur. There, in a land made of dreams, the white tigress watches over her family in peace, with her beloved friends nearby, silent but more connected than they have ever been before. When Luna is at her brightest her Chosen at last bows her head and finds a sleep undisturbed by nightmares.
