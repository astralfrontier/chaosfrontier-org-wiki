# Fall of Eden 2009-03-27

The Cathedral's interior is vast, as big as any mortal building that bears that label. It has one constant inhabitant - Benford. The space is filled with transmissions, models, documents and communications, all projected by Ranapura's helpful spirits. It looks like a physical approximation of the Lands of Light; and in this place, who can tell? The difference is somewhat academic these days.

The world has changed... subtly. Many projections show the Earth from space; and it looks much the same as it ever was. The familiar outlines of the continents are there, as well as the bright glow of cities at light, etching the same outlines into the ebon sky. But there's talk on the streets, in Tijuana and elsewhere, about ordinary people encountering extraordinary things. Aliens. Androids. Dragons. Things of dreams, and things of nightmare.

Benford makes it his business to understand what is going on, or at least to try. The moral assuasion of the Exalted is as good as a UN Resolution; ships and cargo planes are carrying Raven phones, generators, and emergency food to the far corners of the globe. Equally importantly, they are carrying volunteers from every nation, in a vast, slow creep of humane aid. It's not just the old dream of an idealistic scientist. The current battle is Humanity versus Unity. Somewhere in the sea of essence surging over the Earth, are cracks in the fabric of reality. And through those cracks are the lairs of the Fetich.

Somewhere in the sea of information, is the end of the war, and the gateway to the future. "The right future," Benford mutters, and then he's back to his work. Visitors come and go; assistants from the Burgundy clan, other exalts, heads of state... Benford meets them all, but marks time only in the progression of daylight and sunrise around his images of Earth.

On board Ranapura, security is pretty good. The five guilds of Dragon-Blooded patrol their respective areas, alert for Alchemical intrusion or a mortal blundering their way inside. What they actually catch, and who they actually drag back to the control area, is something altogether different.

The figure is a tall, slender person - man or woman? It's hard to tell. He or she has long hair the color of green growing life, and eyes that reek of cunning, if not malice. The figure is dressed in a loose-fitting robe of some kind, with a hat cocked insouciantly to one side. A smile adorns its lips.

As the Exalted gather, this individual delivers a mocking, perfunctory bow. "I am the Minion," s/he says in a curious voice. "I come at the behest of the Deliberative of Creation."

Morgan steps forward. "Welcome, then, Minion," he replies with wary caution - he has only tales and memories of the Minion's kind, but those tales are perilous enough. "I am called Morgan. On what errand has the Deliberative sent you?"

"To teach you of this marvel of the Wyld," the Minion answers with a smile. "The great gift - the Chaos Frontier. A doorway to dreams, and the road to salvation for the people of this poor, starving little world."

Morgan quietly appreciates the wisdom and skill of his fellow Eclipse who must surely have dealt with this individual. Fair Folk are difficult to bind - unless you understand the identity they have adopted; Morgan's brother, or sister, must surely have played on the fae's desire to have others "appreciate" the Wyld. "And once you have taught us of this wonder, what then for yourself?"

Benford frowns, unappreciative of condescension, but listens. _So odd to stare chaos in the face._

"What of me?" the Minion asks innocently. "There is a truly infinite miracle to behold here. I will tell this to your children, and to theirs, though the lives of the Chosen be long."

Morgan is satisfied with this, for the time being. "Very well then. Teach on." He takes a seat, and listens carefully.

"The Chaos Frontier is the Essence of Creation entering that of Gaia. Gaia rejects it. But rather than dissipating, it mixes with the Wyld itself. Boundaries of endless creativity, wellsprings of love and beauty... ahhh." The Minion gives a slight, almost orgasmic shudder, before continuing.

"The resulting admixture is a universe of possibilities rather than an expression of definites. Threads of fate that would be merely dreams are now granted some measure of reality. These realities fold upon themselves, yielding spaces that overlap each other. To cross between them, simply enter the Wyld boundaries."

The Minion continues. "Those with their own Essence - such as the Chosen and their blessed followers - may freely pass between such worlds, remembering what has befell them in each. Those without will find their memories and their very selves reshaped, of course. To them, nothing will be amiss at all."

Benford strokes his chin. "But it's still the same universe... the same Primordials, and Neverbord, and Gods, and of course, your kind, behind each veil, yes?"

"Naturally," the Minion replies, grinning. "We do not create the transcendent. But consider..." S/he reaches into the robe s/he wears, withdrawing a hand puppet, and carefully fits it onto one hand. "/I am a god, little puppet!/" says the Minion commandingly, then acts out for the puppet: "I don't believe you!" "/Observe my power!/" S/he throws the puppet to the floor and stomps on it. "I'm sorry, I believe in you and will worship you."

Carefully the Minion picks the dirtied puppet up and strokes it, cooing gently. "Godhood is relative."

Benford frowns, but then cracks into a loud guffaw. The tension of the recent past is so thick; this Minion, though obviously a lunatic, is at least an amusing lunatic. "Understood," he sputters.

The Minion grins widely. "You see? It's a beautiful place. You can find your dreams there. And so if you wish to understand more, I will be available somewhere."

"Delightfully specific," Morgan says with a slight sardonic smile of his own. "Do we have to track you down if we have more questions, or do you have a forwarding address?"

The Minion scratches his_her head. "Wherever there's food and shelter, really," s_he replies after a moment. "On that note, I'm famished. Do you have someone around?"

Benford says, "Err... some... ONE?"

The Minion smiles and speaks with all the delicacy of a nobleman discussing his mistress's pregnancy. "Well, then. You see, your food and drink is not my food and drink. We are what we are."

"The Fair Folk feed upon dreams, Benford," Morgan sighs. "Now - anyone want to help feed our guest? Don't everyone jump up all at once now."

"If you're lacking in something here, I'll go out and try the Mexican around here," the Minion volunteers helpfully.

Benford looks pained. "You know, there's a lot of serious bastards in this world, but I'm not sure that I know of anyone deserves to have their dreams eaten. How did you handle these things in Creation?"

The Minion smiles casually. "We didn't ask in Creation," s/he says.

"And to think we were called brilliant for thinking of this," Morgan mutters to himself. Aloud, he says, "I'm sure we can make some suitable arrangements. Give us leave to consult amongst ourselves." _And where will you be eating later on, I wonder?_ Morgan thinks to himself. _Sky, Sea, and Land! What have our forebears in Creation gotten ourselves into?_

Benford rubs his forehead, tempted to call for the Man. _No. I will make my own decision for once._ "Do as you are wont," he says, "but become a monster and ... well ... use your imagination." He returns to his work.

"I always use my imagination," the Minion whispers. Free to go by the look of it, s/he departs.

"That reckoning will come in time," Benford adds a moment later. "We're no longer in a position to make judgements about individual destinies, for we have become legends."
