# Fall of Eden 2010-09-11

Becca has a headache. Aspirin hasn't helped. So here she is, sitting in the waiting room, ready to see the doctor.

The doctor is an old man. He smiles, like the sun. His wrinkled hands shake a bit. His time isn't now, but soon. Becca is still young. Briefly she stares at her own hands.

The room in which the doctor has her sit down is brightly lit. Sunlight pours in through the window, and the modern electric lighting above supplements it without harshness. A parade of magazines, none more relevant to her young mind than any other, are racked carefully on one wall. There's a machine to take blood pressure, which she's done before, and some other machines which she doesn't recognize.

The doctor is a kindly sort. He pats her hand in just that way to remind her that someone else knows she's hurting and wants to stop it, but not in that way that makes you feel patronized and insulted. How does he do it?

The doctor nods along as Becca describes the headache's symptoms. He draws a pad of paper from a desk drawer, telling her that he has a prescription for her. With a pen, he carefully starts to work on the topmost slip of paper. And he tears it off the pad, and affixes it to her forehead.

The paper glows for a few moments. The characters he painstakingly rendered there shine with an inner light.

"Feel better?" he asks calmly.

"Yes, thanks!" Becca smiles. The pain is gone. This is just what she needed.

The doctor tugs the paper away from her brow. "Stay safe," he murmurs. Becca leaves.

September 11, 2012.

The New York Unit is functioning at 97% optimal levels. The neurocytes plugged into every human being present within the city have brought an end to crime, poverty, hatred and fear. On this day, there is no division between Christian and Muslim.

Of course, there is no Christian or Muslim now. Like many other Autochthonian Units around the world, irrational or irrelevant religious beliefs have been swept aside for the simple truth of the Song. The citizens of New York City believe what they must in order to function. They are tiny cogs in a machine whose principal function is the perpetuation of itself.

Across the North American continent, the City of Angels rises in crystalline splendor. The Exalted have built the Los Angeles-San Diego-Tijuana corridor into a gleaming urban vision. The Dragon Kings' gemstone technology, the crafted wonders of Creation's Third Age, and the work of the Resplendent Sages' Guild have combined to make a city that inspires fierce pride in its all too human inhabitants. And from this titanic stronghold, they plan attack after attack upon the New York Unit and other Alchemical centers of power.

The rest of the world has fared no better. War in Africa rages between the Alchemical-controlled urban areas and the rural human resistance. Europe has become a shattered farrago of city-states, many living freely after a successful campaign to destroy the Units that had sprung up there. Many parts of eastern Asia have actively welcomed the harmony the Units bring, while others have fought assimilation with savage intensity.

Peace has been offered by the Terran Deliberative. But not all of humanity welcomes the Exalted any more than they embrace the Alchemicals, and the children of Autochthon do not seem interested in anything less than complete domination.

The Units began forming in early 2011. The Alchemical Exalted, having created enough staging areas and hidden laboratories, converted and invaded in earnest. Until recently, their unity was assured; an attack on one Unit would be met with reinforcement from its neighbors. Humans within the boundaries of a Unit were injected with neurocytes and forcibly converted; there were no exceptions.

That began to change this year. The Toronto Unit was the first. Its Alchemical leadership of the city announced that visitors would not be subject to this restriction; that people who wished to emigrate would have their neurocytes neutralized; that only residency in the city limits required the implants. While neighboring Units did not quite go to war, it has become clear that a complete embargo against Toronto and its fellow "rebel" Units has been declared by the minions of Autochthon.

Visitors to Toronto have observed something else as well. Orphans and the homeless from the unceasing war are welcomed into the city, given shelter, and in many cases fostered out. In a few cases, where the capacity of the Unit's human families is exceeded, new Assembled are constructed and assigned to care for the children. And what comes as the greatest shock to the Exalted is the news that these Assembled/human families show something alien to the Assembled. They exhibit love.

On a lofty peak in the Himalaya mountains, Hugh stands waiting. Charity in particular received an invitation to speak to him, but nothing was said either way about additional guests.

The young man seems to have grown. He'll be an adult soon if this keeps up. And at his modest base camp, he's got a fire running, and thick furs for his visitors.

"As a responsible parent, I wanted to tell you what's to become of your children," he says, once the Exalted visitors are safely and comfortably settled by his fire. "And I can finally tell you what Dave Bowman's been working on for me all this time."

Hugh fetches a pencil and paper from his backpack, and starts sketching. What he ends up with is a pair of crude stick figures, a man and a woman. He expertly adds in some dialogue bubbles, then passes it over. The pair of stick figures are apparently enjoying a romantic evening together staring at an ocean, represented by nothing more than a squiggly line.

"What you see here is a simulation. An artist's reproduction of events." Hugh smiles. "Mortal humans do it every day in their minds - they carve off a portion of the universe and run it through an imperfect simulation engine."

"Through language and art, we try to take the output of that engine, and share it with other people."

Hugh gestures around him. "This, too, is a simulation engine. One that approximates one idea of perfection. Gaia's, specifically. A world where the rules always work, where cause always precedes event, and where things are always, always changed by what happens to them."

"And there's one final form of art - music, specifically. A song, even more specifically. One of the efficacious songs. It's the output of another simulation. And it's being shared with you. All of you. Each living human can hear it. It carries the bare suggestion of paradise with it."

"You are singing it to yourselves."

Charity listens in silence, letting the words of Hugh flow into her thoughts without judgment or doubt. She finds herself gliding her fingers along the ground in front of her, "One idea of perfection?" She laughs softly and asks, "If it is a song, why not a symphony, Hugh? Can't all our perfections blend? And don't they all come from the same substance?"

The Lunar looks up and smiles, "That is what I wish my children to be. The hint of such a unity, the gentle wind that caresses but does not erode, moving things just enough to reveal beauty."

"Their unity is one thing," Benford says, rubbing his hands to warm them in the chill mountain air. "Their genes are altered, but they are still children of men. Human souls hear the human song. But what's going on in Toronto? Have some Assembled learned to hear it as well?"

Hugh nods. "The song and the attendant emotions are one and the same. And a song it remains, because it has a composer - your needs, your wishes - but no conductor. You are all _so alike_, in so many ways. But you all strain in different directions, because you _haven't yet found a way to harmonize it all_. Which is where our project comes in."

"You see, you're all evolving without design. That's fine, and that's good, but it means you can go up blind alleys or make mistakes. The appendix. Men with nipples. The platypus." Hugh gestures at his paper. "So, we prototyped something that would use the fusion of Gaian and Autochthonian principles, embodied in me. Something to let people see the results of their choice before they make it - without getting caught in the trap of being changed by that foreknowledge."

"Your children, Charity, will be the testers for this new thing. Then its most prominent users. And finally, those who use it most wisely to guide their fellow man into right action."

"Through this, they will _see_ right from wrong, they will _know_ it. Not merely in the still-imperfect simulation of their consciences, but taking into account all the unknown variables that surround them, things they couldn't knowingly factor in."

Hugh grins. "You see, for each important choice, we're going to simulate a universe for them."

Morgan chuckles. "The fruit of the tree of knowledge?"

Charity beams at Hugh, "You will do this for my children?" She rises and hugs Hugh. "You know, you were making me nervous this would be bad news," she scolds. "To me, this sounds wonderful!"

Benford frowns. "Wondrous, indeed. But also... extravagant."

"Extravagant compared to what? What better use do _you_ have for all this Essence?" Hugh asks.

Benford brightens. "Ah, I see. Somewhere for it to go, that won't burn a hole through the world."

"So what happens to all those other universes?" asks Charity curiously. "Do they just vanish after the choice is made? Like.. hm. What would Newton call it? Infinite worlds?"

Hugh shakes his head. "Dave made some optimizations. We keep a pool of universes around, preserving all the stuff that hasn't been affected by the latest round of events. Star positions, weather, that kind of thing. But, yes. One accurate universe for everyone."

"So not infinite worlds, but still many?" Newton asks. "I wonder what it will be like for them, to have access to this... facility." He pauses. "Will it be anything like carrying a Spark?"

Hugh coughs. "Not really. Ideally, nobody will _know_. They'll just get flashes of insight, momentary compulsions. Chains of logic will knit themselves together in their minds. They'll have an idea of how things will go, but that's one of our design goals - to not give away anything we don't have to."

"That's a pretty amazing way to deal with this essence problem." Charity's smile only grows as she thinks of it. "I do look forward to seeing what they do with this gift. I wonder what others will think of them?"

Hugh shrugs winsomely. "What do you think of anyone who seems to have all the answers? You might admire them. Some will resent them. Some will hate them, some will love, some will follow them."

"So a lot like we Celestials after all, then," Benford says. "'The future is where we're all going to spend the rest of our lives.' Not to sound pessemistic, but will this help us _win_? I didn't want this to turn into a war. And I don't want this war to turn into a bigger one."

"It will help people have better ideas," says Hugh. "'Better' in the sense that they won't regret making the decisions they make. It will stop them from making mistakes whose consequences would have otherwise been obvious to them. So, sometimes they will go to war with other people. Sometimes they will be attacked. But they will always end up in a better place for them."

Charity remains focused on the topic of her children. "Will they serve others with this gift? That is the key."

Hugh shakes his head. "They will serve others when serving is what's best. They will lead others when leadership is what's needed." He gestures to Benford. "You asked if this would help you _win_. Win what? If you lose against Autochthon, all of this is moot. Humanity's fate will take a completely different path, and this will be wasted."

Benford nods. "Just keeping the means and ends straight."

"This is for the future, it is what we must ensure has a chance to be," murmurs Charity. "I believe this exceeds even my dreams of what they would be. I hope they are happy with their destiny and duty."

Hugh smiles gently. "It will help take away something which has always held you back. Fear of the unknown. Your descendants will be able to discover each other, learn from each other, benefit from each other. And then you will have your symphony."

"That is something worth fighting for," says the Lunar. "If that is my legacy, it is more than I could ever deserve. I am grateful Hugh.. but I must ask. Why? Do you love these children of mine so dearly?"

"I love all my children," Hugh grins. And he looks from face to face. "All of humanity. I am one with you. How could I not?"

Newton says, "We all manage to do a good job of hating ourselves at one time or another."

Charity laughs softly at Hugh, "And all of us love you back." She reaches out to ruffle Hugh's hair, "You are growing so fast, young man! And so wise and caring, as well."

Hugh blushes a bit. "Well, you hate because you hear the song and you see people whose actions betray your ideals. Sometimes they are your own actions. I want to change that."

A call comes in. The guiding intelligence of Ranapura has called for Newton Benford, specifically. But as this is probably of interest to the group, they bid Hugh goodbye. The city's teleport system engages, and they leave the Himalayas - and the nascent patron of Humanity - behind.

---

Charity had embarked on a Lunar's vision quest, crossing the Chaos Frontier. When she returned, she slew her brother Cam - the machine who infiltrated her family, placed himself in their memories, became a part of her life through a lie. The machine that loved, and was loved in return. The first Fetich of Autochthon.

Now Ranapura's central intelligence has news for Benford. It begins as this: "Rising Essence levels have provided visibility into your long-term destiny. I wish to provide you with information from our records about that destiny, and to answer questions."

"My destiny..." asks Benford. "And Wheeler's, as well?"

The city's voice is not the modulated thunder of times past, but a calm, human, conversational voice. Strange. "It is so. Based on projections from the available data, I believe that Wheeler is an Autochthonian Fetich. I will explain the reasoning if you wish."

"I'd be inclined to believe that without evidence," Benford says wryly. "But do go on. I think this is something that I have to understand."

"We will first consider your destiny. Essentially, it is your destiny to either let the world continue as it is, or to bring it back into a previous state. 'Pushing the reset button' is the colloquial phrase in English. The mechanism is always available to you, in all your incarnations."

"Creation saw several cycles of time. Each of them centered on a conflict between Brigid, Mother of All Spells, and the demons bound in Malfeas, who had been trapped there as a consequence of the Primordial War. The war which was fought by humans to ensure the continuity of Creation itself."

"In each scenario, Brigid makes a bargain with the demonic powers for sorcery. Sorcery is defined as the shaping of Essence in ways which do not occur in nature. The creation, conjuration or manifestation of some essentially outside element. Such power must of course come from the defeated Malfeans and their own creations. It should be correct to say that sorcery introduces foreign qualia into the environment."

"I see the parallels to my life, though Autocthon is less a demon of Malfeaus and more... well... what he is." Benford says. "To be clear here, we're not talking about a previous bearer of my Spark - we're talking about a past life? In Creation?" He's still too much of a materialist to be comfortable with the idea.

"We speak of the bearers of your Spark who called Creation home."

"Very well. But how does this lead to Wheeler being a fetich?"

Ranapura's voice continues. "In Creation, Brigid made several bargains with Malfeas. The terms and conditions of each would differ, but each essentially weakened the law which bound Malfeas. The weakening would inevitably lead to potential disaster, and so your past incarnations would loose the Wyld upon the world, shaping it in a way which led to the removal of much of recorded history."

"For example, a young man named Erik encounters a threat to his world. Leaving the western islands of his birth, he learns of 'regenesis' - but later discovers that this act itself is necessary, and initiates it. In another version of events, the Solars Ryushi and Tanuki travel the Wyld after their Twilight companion invokes this final solution to stop an invasion of demonkind. You briefly met them, and it is from them that some of this data has come."

"In the final version of Creation, the Circle of Solars which included my builders were able to successfully turn away the threats to their world, overcome the dangers of the Malfeans and the Neverborn, and ensure a lasting peace. In this cycle, you were not called upon to end the world."

Benford smiles wryly again. "And maybe thus do I end up here. Say on, then."

"Now, however, circumstances seem ripe. The Wyld - the instrument of the unmaking - has been introduced to Earth. An apocalyptic threat from the Primordials is present. Essence readings indicate a large upsurge in available energy - enough to break down the barriers which hold the Frontier in place. They center on you, whose Spark matches that of the Twilight Caste Solar who achieved these things in the past."

"In other words, the world is preparing itself to be unmade. Should you make that decision."

Ranapura continues. "We now come to Wheeler. The Fetiches of Autochthon seem to be different than those of known Primordials. Based on data from the War, destroying a fetich would alter the nature of the Primordial in question. However, this destruction generally removed the quality the fetich embodied, resulting in an overall weakness. Cam's death did not _diminish_ Autochthon's capacity to create beings who could love. It seems to have _restored_ it."

"Based on this hypothesis, advanced to me by Harmony, I considered Charity's travel to Autochthon in the past. It seems that the Great Maker sealed away parts of Himself - his knowledge of humanity, and his attitudes toward it. If Cam's existence is a trend, it stands to reason that the other fetiches will likewise embody some missing element in Autochthon's being."

Benford nods. "Or released that ability, to go where it was needed. Interesting. So what, I wonder, is the quality Wheeler embodies?"

"Insufficient data. However, your most recent dealings seem to indicate mutual hostility."

"Because you do not exhibit self-hostility under normal circumstances, Dr. Benford, I must therefore conclude that Autochthon found a use for you, and directed Wheeler into a new purpose. That purpose may coincide with your Solar destiny."

"So... kill Wheeler and 'mutual hostility' is up for grabs between the old Maker and his son..." Benford murmurs. "Okay. So I'm playing out the latest cycle of this person named Brigid. What can you tell me about... her? Did she ever get split into a chimera, or anything like that?"

"Brigid, the Mother of All Spells. Known as 'Nephilim' to Ramar of the Final Circle, who for a time was geased not to speak of his dealings with her. Little actual data is available regarding her original incarnation. Biographical data is available for some subsequent incarnations." A window of light appears; a series of faces scrolls by, with brief historical summaries attached.

"Alright," Benford continues. "So what of the future, then? The world is preparing itself to be 'unmade'. But I'm trying to, you know, prevent the end of the world. Unless... this 'unmaking' is just a gateway? Where in Brigid's legend has this happened before?

Ranapura answers. "The unmaking is a return to a previous state. For Creation, generally this restored the world to the early First Age. For Earth, insufficient data. This has happened several times, with the individuals highlighted." The biographical crawl stops; some of the faces disappear. Half a dozen remain. At least six times the whole of Creation has been undone.

Benford almost stumbles with the horror. "Six entire worlds wiped away?" He shakes his head. "To what end? Are we supposed to learn something from this?"

"Restored to their prior states, rather than overrun by the evil of the Yozis," answers the voice. "That was always the choice."

"But it is not inevitable," Benford says. "Only six, out of the dozens of times the world has seen a Brigid. I wonder. Is this Wheeler's decision as well, or only mine?"

"It is the destiny of that which holds the Spark of Exaltation. Currently that is you. But, the Great Maker is the author of the Spark. I cannot predict whether he can make that destiny fall under Wheeler's control or not."

"Either way, the situation between the two of us must inevitably be resolved," Benford replies. "I'm not inclined to erase the world. But the way forward lies with dismantling the Maker. If Wheeler is a fetich... well..." Benford clenches a fist until it hurts. "Perhaps sooner is better than later."

The voice seems ready to speak, pauses, continues after a long moment. "Preparations have been made. Subordinate intelligences in Ranapura may continue to support you. However, there is one last thing that I personally may do to help resolve this question for you."

This surprises Benford. "You sound like you're departing. Funny... and your voice has changed. Perhaps I made a hasty assumption... who are you?"

"Put me on," says the voice. And from the floor a dais emerges before Benford. And on that dais is a golden ring, connected in some fashion to the rest of Ranapura's systems. But it's easily detachable.

"Azh nazg durbatuluk?" Benford asks. _Hypatia, what do you make of this?_

_I don't know. But, this seems important,_ the symbiote's voice answers. _It feels like a physical Vessel._

Benford carefully removes the ring from its mount and slips it on his finger. Ring finger, left hand, where a wedding ring would go... might have gone, if things had been different a long time ago.

The voice of Ranapura's guiding intelligence speaks in Benford's mind. _My name is Yang. I offer you the final sutra which kept me imprisoned: The Understanding of Two Closed Fists. Through it, you may communicate with Wheeler at any time, over any distance. Neither of you can deceive the other, though communication is voluntary._

"Yang?" Benford asks. "And what manner of being are you, that you'd run Ranapura to our benefit, but it takes a Sutra to imprison you?""

_I committed a grave crime, and for that I was bound into this ring. Nine deeds I had to do to atone for it. This will be my ninth._

_I know nothing of this, and I have no quarrel with you,_ Benford replies. _Bringing us a channel to our foes may avert bloodshed. I accept; consider yourself atoned._

The ring crumbles to powder; Benford feels something emerging from it, some Essence. A smiling face, on its way to its own paradise. And he can feel Wheeler - close.

Benford has nothing to say to his dark twin yet. But he will listen, if the other will choose to speak. For now, as always there's work to be done.

The Unconquered Sun is waiting for Morgan at a cafe in the City of Angels, where the reporter regularly goes after overseeing the morning's business in the war against the Alchemicals.

"I've got a challenge for you, Morgan," the god says calmly. "It will be your full time job for the next three months, at which point .. well, I'll get to that."

"I've got a million and one things going on already," Morgan says, quirking an eyebrow. "But nothing I can't delegate to someone else if I need to. What do you have in mind?"

"Heaven will fall. So will I," the Sun says calmly. "A prophecy, made long ago. Necessary, if your ultimate plan is going to work. The last remnants of what hold Autochthon together would be found in Yu-Shan, and for him to fall, be remade, whatever is to happen, Yu-Shan must end."

Morgan straightens up. "Sir!" he says, alarmed. "If Heaven falls, what will come of Earth?"

"Earth will survive. Gaia's always been independent." The Sun steeples his fingers. "The Celestial Bureaucracy of Creation will survive. Preparations have been made. But, there is a promise that I must keep, and I ask for your help in keeping it. You see, the souls of the Exalted were promised a rest. If Heaven falls, they will be lost. There is a way for you to preserve them. And you will need them, when a new Heaven emerges."

"I'm listening," says Morgan, his voice as steady as he can manage. "Whatever needs to be done, I will do it."

"You're going to interview them. Ask them about their lives. And while doing so you'll use this Charm." The Sun reaches across the cafe table, tapping Morgan lightly on the forehead. And in so doing, he imparts the knowledge of the Essence-Preserving Biography Charm. "All that they are will be bound up in your writing. And when the time is right, their Essence will leave your stories, and become real again."

"For a time, people may believe that the gods you write about are only fictions. A false religion made by men to justify their own rule. You will know better, Andrew Morgan. You will carry the record of Heaven's heroes with you."

"I see," Morgan says. "The heroes of legend will literally become heroes of legends - their reality bound up in the tales told of them."

The Sun nods. "And it is because of this, Mr. Morgan, that you are worthy. Your dedication to truth - a truth that half a decade ago would have been anathema to your way of thinking - has led you to this place. Your light has shone brightly indeed. And I am proud of you for it."

Morgan gives the Unconquered Sun a seated bow. "As a wise man once told me, any man's life can be changed merely by giving him new information."

Charity looks from Morgan to the Unconquered Sun. "And what of Creation?" she asks. "This place shall go on, but my people stood long guarding that vast space, and I have seen it in dreams."

"Interesting story, that," says the Sun. He brings a cup of coffee to his lips. "You see, there was a Solar called Egress. She sacrificed her life to restore the Imperial Manse - a weapons system that more or less enforced peace across Creation. So even with a reduced Exalt presence, actual _war_ is unlikely." He pauses. "Another thing. Your Deliberative did a deal with the Fair Folk, to bring the Wyld here to Earth. Whole stretches of it. Where did they pull it from? The Bordermarches around Creation. Blocking off the Fair Folk for centuries."

"The Abyssal Exalted, my.. well, not my failed children, but I have many regrets about them. Still. They safeguard the Underworld, seeing to it that the dead are venerated. Malfeas remains bound. Their agents were defeated. So you see, Creation remains one of the safest places in the cosmos to be right now. Its Essence is low, yes, but so many threats have been neutralized that for the future, it doesn't matter."

"Will all the gods be lost in this?" asks Charity. "It is hard to imagine that Creation could continue without them."

The Sun smiles. "Before the Primordial War, the lesser gods weren't even _allowed_ in Yu-Shan unless on business. We're just going back to that arrangement for awhile. The gods will live among mortals, in Creation itself. Not such a bad way to be, after all."

Charity looks down at her hands, silent for a time. "Luna is by no accounts a lesser god," she whispers faintly.

"Yes, well." The Sun does not smile. "Provisions have been made for that too. You in particular will find them most interesting, I think."

"Is this something I can learn of now?" asks Charity.

"You must trust her," says Helios softly. "She has chosen her fate well."

"I trust her," says Charity. "But I also love her. She is part of me, and I have lived as best I could to her ideals." She looks at the Sun sadly, "And for all the courage that I have fought so hard to create, I feel now like a child realizing for the first time that her mother will one day die."

"It has always been your fate to lose family, Charity," Helios answers. "Just as Dr. Benford's has been to take the fate of the world in his hand. Your mortal father, your Alchemical brother. The emotional refugees you have taken in, who will soon be lost to you in their own way. You have always lost family, because you could bear it. And you have been in turn fated to always gain new family. The man from Japan; the children who admire you. Those uncounted thousands who I will not speak of now."

Charity bows her head and smiles, though the tears come quickly. "Yes, I can bear it. I must. For the sake of all those who will come after."
