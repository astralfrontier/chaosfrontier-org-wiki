> (OOC) Nathan changes his name to Morgan.

In his time, Andrew Morgan has experienced a great deal more of the cosmos than any typical reporter. But this is his first time traveling beyond the veil - what has been dubbed 'the Chaos Frontier' by the Exalted of Earth. The boundaries between reality and dream are sharply defined to those with a sense of Essence.

Beyond this Frontier, worlds and worlds abound. Some are Earth, of other times or other places. Some are Earths so strange as to be unrecognizable. And some are simply elsewhere.

Morgan has been busy with a vexing question: who, what, or where are the remaining fetiches of Autochthon? His journey has often led him into the Wyld or the Lands of Light. Now it ends here, in a cave.

Inside the cave is a lake, and beside the lake is a mechanical man. He looks like something out of a steampunk-inspired music video: brass and crystal, whitish metal limbs, all pulleys and pistons and mechanism. But he whirrs as he turns, staring at his visitor expectantly.

The part of Morgan that still remembers pre-Exaltation life is slightly affronted that the being is almost a caricature of a mechanical man; but he has learned that in the world of Essence, form follows function, and the more refined the Essence, the closer the form to a Platonic ideal. In any case, it lives, and it isn't in _Morgan's_ nature to not interview. "Hello," he says.

"Hello, you are unexpected," the mechanical creature responds brightly. "I am Exzperiment 36. Who are you please?"

"I am Andrew Morgan," replies the reporter. "And the unexpected is my business. What manner of experiment are you?"

"I am.. an integration of zpirit influenze and machinery. The Univerzity wizhed to zee if sacred water would rezonate within a devize." The little metal man gestures at himself. "Az you can zee, they were correct."

Another visitor reveals itself to Morgan's Exalted senses well before he becomes physically visible. Even from here, the reporter can tell what he faces. One of the Fair Folk is present.

As it steps into the dim light the mechanical man is projecting, Morgan takes in his features. Sharp eyes, attentive, darting about. A posture of listening, of _focus_, a being who lives in the here and now. He feels like the embodiment of a keen-eyed journalist, almost radiates it. He's dressed in a snappily tailored suit. Somehow it balances style and modesty, eschewing power. Morgan briefly winces. All of these impressions are carried into his mind via Essence, and he can feel it. The suit, the face - it's all an act. The mechanical man - 36 - becomes aware of him too, greeting him just as politely.

"You are alzo unexpected. Who are you please?" The Fair One doffs his hat. Was he wearing one, just a moment ago? "_Bertram Colbey, Daily Trample. Call me Bert._"

Morgan manages a wry grin. "Might've known someone would try to scoop me." For the time being, he sees no need to intervene - a being who steps into the role of reporter is not a threat until he goes to press. "What brings you to this cave, 36?"

"I am here to atone for the zin of humankind in zettling on thiz planet, and zuppressing the life which waz already here," explains 36. "I now zeek reconziliation between the red and green ecologiez which exizt here." He pauses. "I am also conztructing a ztory."

Morgan glances at 'Bertram Colbey'. "Well, you've certainly got the right sort of visitors. We're both in the business of retelling stories."

Bert grins. "_Storytelling's in the blood._" He gestures at 36. "_But this little fella says he's got something. I bet you dollars to dinosaurs that we're both here for something similar. You for Autochthon's weakness, me for the Codex. You're the man, right? Who has the Codex of Yu-Shan? The gods, wrapped into stories?_"

"Ah, now _there_ hangs a tale," replies Morgan, raising his eyebrows. "Many tales indeed." He does not bother to deny it.

"_I'm the next link in the chain,_" Bert explains. "_Your world won't survive what's coming. You may not. We're to keep them safe until the restoration._"

And those assertions cannot be denied either. But Morgan's ancestors cry out for him to remain wary when making bargains with the Fair Ones. "Tell me, then, how you shall keep them safe, and what you shall do when your task is complete."

Bert rubs his hands together, clearly relishing this part. "_Behold! The grand plan._" He gestures behind him to the cave. "_A space so vast, none can measure it. A time so long, none can endure it. A distance so long, none can traverse it. Behind such barriers the whole of the Fair Folk will keep the Codex, returning it unto humanity only when it attains Paradise at last. That moment will happen with the pacts and schemes of the Exalted - it is assured by your own avatar, your newly hatched Primordial. And when you savor the sublime pleasures of Paradise, when the gods must once again walk among you and guide you with their wisdom, then the Codex will be returned intact. This not only I, but all the Fair Folk vow._"

As Bertram speaks and gestures, the cave wall seems to illuminate by a hidden light, casting both their shadows. It can be hazardous, to summon in your mind the analogy of Plato and Platonic forms when there is so much Essence around. Nevertheless, Morgan nods, grinning. "With an offer like that, how could I refuse? What writer could resist the assurance that his work will stand the test of time?"

Bert grins, accepting the Codex Morgan conjures. "_Gotcha sucker!_" he barks, then quickly: "_Just kidding, it'll be safe._"

Morgan sticks his tongue out at Bert good-naturedly. Even when oathbound, the Fair Folk are japesters, and it does no harm to indulge them their little witticisms.

The Fair Folk gestures at 36. "_And with that business concluded... little man, tell us your story._" He glances at Morgan. "_I'm sure the Exalted would like to hear it too._"

Morgan pulls out a notepad and pen. "Why don't you begin at the beginning..."

"It iz exactly about the beginning," 36 explains quietly. "Of everything."

The King of All Life and the Emperor of Eternal Darkness are the two most basic forces in the cosmos. At first, they existed in harmonious opposition: the King would create something from his light, and the Emperor would swallow it up in his darkness. Order and stability reigned, but everything was fleeting and ephemeral.

There came a time when something came into being that could not be destroyed, for its essential nature was that it did not exist. This thing was called Oramus, and neither the King of All Light nor the Emperor of Eternal Darkness could explain it.

"This thing vexes us greatly!" they told each other. "For it hews to neither of our natures, instead existing and yet not. What shall be done?"

Out of this more such things arose, taking shelter from Oramus against the unyielding maw of the Emperor's darkness, ignoring the endless fecundity of the King's light. And in that shelter arose the second such anomaly, the Dragon's Shadow - that which existed where the King's light could not reach but the Emperor's darkness did not consume.

Oramus and the Dragon's Shadow gained a boundary, a landscape, and other companions. And together they orbited each other, knowing nothing beyond their own purest natures. And the King of All Light and the Emperor of Eternal Darkness were greatly puzzled.

"Let us stop our activities," they said to each other, "and shackle ourselves, so that we do not unbalance this new thing called existence. And let us explore what we have made."

And together the two shackled themselves and bound themselves, becoming something lesser, something separate and distinct. From the King of All Light emerged the endless thriving sea of chaos, the Wyld, and its children the Fair Folk. From the Emperor of Eternal Darkness there came the all-consuming void, Oblivion, and its children called Humanity.

Ever after it would be the fate of the Fair Folk to create, to spin stories, to be bound by the stories they spun and to change. And ever after it would be the fate of Humanity to destroy, to conquer, but also to choose and select and remove imperfections or impurities. For the Emperor of Eternal Darkness found that in his bound state he could give discrimination to destruction, and the King of All Light found that in his shackled condition his unending stream of creations could have meaning and structure.

And it is now given to these two forces to meet at the nexus of their creation, and to realize the truth: that the future spins itself from gossamer and dreams and hope, and is given life in the present world of humankind, and follows from there into the past as myth and legend and history.

36 concludes his story. "That iz the story," he explains modestly. "And there iz another truth here. The King and the Emperor go in zearch of themselves, for they have forgotten the truth. All that forgetz itzelf iz waiting for itz mirror image, itz equal. Then it iz reminded, and reunitez with that image. Then it iz complete, itz cycle done."

And hearing these words, Morgan realizes in a flash who the fetich he has been chasing really is. He remembers Autochthon of the past, when Jet visited: a Primordial which very much understood humanity, which _loved_ humanity. The Autochthon of this time has forgotten. He must meet with that old self, be reminded of what he was, and what humanity is.

Patiently Autochthon sent such a creature out into the world. Perhaps he struggled to understand why he did it, but he did nevertheless. It came, with the sole purpose of studying Andrew Morgan. Of understanding him. Gerhard, the old-generation unit.

> (OOC) Morgan says, "Man, I only vaguely /remember/ Gerhard."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "Yeah it's like that"

> (OOC) Morgan says, "Still, even without remembering the details, I love full-circle kinds of things."

The Exalted do have some means of contacting their Alchemical counterparts. In the Lands of Light, a final conversation occurs between the two. Gerhard, for his part, does not yet fully understand Andrew Morgan. And Morgan offers a deal: in the moment of his destruction, he will _know_.

And in keeping with his nature, as he promised so many years ago to Jet, the success of his mission overrides his self-protection.

---

In the deep recesses of Autochthon's nature, another of its fundamental components ceases to be. But with it comes a remembrance of humanity, a fragile fleeting glimpse into the soul of one fated for greatness above all others. And Autochthon thinks to itself: _they are ready at last._
