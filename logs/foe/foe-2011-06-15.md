# Fall of Eden 2011-06-15

> (OOC) Log "FoE-2011-06-15" started by FallGM at Wed Jun 15 21:36:19 2011 CDT (OOC)

Not content with skulking in the shadows, the Alchemicals have long since openly declared war on modern mankind. Ever since the Exalted went public, the servants of Autochthon have followed suit. Their stated objective: nothing less than the unification of humanity into a single hive-mind, a decision engine that will brook no dissent and permit no disharmony.

Some of the souls containing Autochthon's old spirit have been found and destroyed, releasing forgotten parts of himself back to the Great Maker, unbalancing his war efforts and causing disunity among his own Alchemicals. But it is not enough to give decisive victory to the Exalted and their allies.

Now Newton Benford returns from his own journey to find such a soul. The news he brings back is troubling. The Core - the mirror of the Loom of Fate in Gaia, the thing which guides Essence into predictable patterns for mankind - is the final piece of the puzzle. Destroy it, and Autochthon can be beaten. But destroying it gives only five days in which to win.

Any longer, and the accumulated Essence in Gaia will certainly wash away the feeble reality that human beings have created for themselves. It will be the end, past which nobody can foresee.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "thoughts, feelings, reactions, impressions, plans, etc. welcome here"

> (OOC) Benford has one

> (OOC) Charity says, "I thought crossing the streams was bad..."

Benford quotes the old Maker. "Let the call go out. 'All Exalted able to be mustered. All weapons of war able to be directed at a Primordial being. Hold nothing back.' We take everyone and everything we can and head for the Core. Nothing stays in reserve. We commit it all, because all of history and destiny hinge on this effort."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Alia keeps pace with the storm."

> (OOC) FallGM will keep rollin unless someone else steps up :)

> (OOC) Morgan hmm.

> (OOC) Morgan says, "No, I got nothin."

> (OOC) Charity says, "Hmmm... I will hold back for now :)"

> (OOC) Charity says, "GM, point of clarity.. at this stage of the game, how 'powerful' are we in exalted terms, so I have a rough idea of what capabilities we have to bring to bear."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "pretty f'in powerful."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "you don't have the magitech wonders of the First Age, but you've got a near-future military apparatus. however:"

As far as anyone knows, the Core exists only in the Lands of Light, the dimensional extension bridging Earth with Autochthonia, domain of information. Physical armies will not be of much use there. However, all the Primordials killed in the past were killed via basically physical means. The considerable armed forces of the Exalted will still be needed. Just not yet.

> (OOC) Benford sets the rally point inside the enemy base.

As such, the squad that enters the Lands of Light consists only of the Exalted themselves, those capable of making the trip courtesy of the Engine. And at the heart of this place, they find two beings waiting for them at the Core. The Supervisor, Autochthon's representative, and the nameless Sidereal who has mentored them from the beginning.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "how do you want to proceed? open pose here"

> (OOC) Morgan says, "The Man?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "yeah"

> (OOC) Charity says, "Just so I'm sure I'm clear.. at this point is it likely we need to destroy the Supervisor?"

> (OOC) Charity is prepping a friendly pose >.>

> (OOC) FallGM says, "that's for you guys to find out/decide"

Benford's engine's war-form has changed little since it first appeared in a Baja junkyard - orange and gold robes over a similarly-colored sheath of armor, the big recurved crossbow slung on his back. He nods to the Man, looks the Supervisor over carefully. "Well, this is a turn-up."

Charity comes ready for battle, armed so with charms and tools that her very presence is menacing, an aura of destruction hangs about the Full Moon. Thus confronted, she follows her heart, putting her body between the two and all her friends, and as a Full Moon says, "We have come to ensure that the hope of humanity is born in full. If you are our friends, aid us. If you are not, you will be destroyed."

> (OOC) Charity says, "I'm going for the very direct method n.n"

"Things will never be back the way they were," the Man says aloud. He fishes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, lights one, inhales, exhales. "But you're fighting for the chance to change things, aren't you? Fine. Tell me one thing. Are you really okay with givin' it all up?"

> (OOC) Benford says, "Hell of a time to ask."

"For what may be? Yes." says Charity.

> (OOC) Charity says, "Bah, for what 'may' be >.<"

> (OOC) FallGM wonders if Morgan or Benford have a response :)

"We would not be who we were if we shied away from doing what we thought must be done," says Morgan. His Engine-form, a toga-clad avenger with a golden gun, looks more right in the Lands of Light than it ever did in the physical plane. "We would not be worthy of our charge if we took the easy way out of anything."

Benford nods once. "The Maker's design forces us forward. This is the path we've chosen. After that... it's all about the common man."

The Man takes another drag of his cigarette. "I'm gonna miss these," he mutters, but steps aside. Still present is the Supervisor. **Exalted. The future you seek demands a permanent exile of all your kind from the world. Only unExalted humankind may proceed. Have you prepared them for that future?**

> (OOC) Charity says, "Anyone taking this one?"

> (OOC) Benford says, "Well... have we?"

> (OOC) Benford says, "Anyone on it? If not, I can pick it up."

> (OOC) Charity says, "I have it :)"

> (OOC) Morgan says, "Morgan would've considered it an obvious thing, given that his charge was to prepare the gods for /their/ exile."

"They may not be ready to live without challenge, they may struggle, but they have in their hearts and minds the keys to survival and yes, even triumph," replies Charity. "Though the exalted may be nothing but a memory to them, we have left our imprint upon them, and the children of my dreams shall walk beside them."

> (OOC) Charity says, "Feel free to add, Morgan. :)"

"Every child must leave their parents and become an adult," says Morgan. "The time has come for humanity to achieve its adulthood and prove that we can stand on our own, without gods or Exalted to catch us if we fall. And as the man who helped prepare the gods for _their_ exile, I'd have been remiss in my duties if I had not similarly helped to prepare mankind."

> (OOC) FallGM checks Benford before proceedin

> (OOC) Benford has something

"We were all unExalted humanity once," Benford says. "We lived for centuries in Gaia, with only culture, wit, and wisdom to see us through. It's not what we've done to prepare them. It's what they've done to prepare the future for themselves. They'll be fine."

> (OOC) Benford says, "We're all on-message here."

**Very well.** The Supervisor steps aside as well. **There is no need for violence. Command a shutdown and it will begin. Calibration will commence immediately.**

> (OOC) Charity says, "Ooohhh... :)"

> (OOC) Benford says, "Any of us, or all of us?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "any"

> (OOC) Charity says, "I feel like this is a moment for a Solar :)"

> (OOC) Benford says, "\[to Morgan\] "Flip ya for it.""

> (OOC) Morgan says, "I'm a talker. It feels like this moment is for a doer."

> (OOC) Charity says, "I think this is a moment for Benford, too :)"

> (OOC) Benford says, "Benford does little else but lecture and preach. But why not? Here goes."

For a moment, nobody moves; Benford, sensing the assent of his fellows, steps forward. "Core. We are the Exalted. It is time to fulfill the plan of the Old Maker and un-dam the future. You are complete; retire in peace." Then, under his breath, "Or, if you prefer, 'shutdown -h now'. But you have served your purpose well and deserve a dignified elegy."

The Core - the whole of it, the massive construct of Essence which guides all of physical reality for the Earth - commences its shutdown in an orderly fashion. And the Supervisor steps forward, facing Benford. He extends a hand-written note. **For you. I was directed to deliver it at this moment.** And on the note is a single word, in English.

"Geronimo"

---

> (OOC) Charity says, "Ahahah"

"Astronomers are reporting that some very large body - a planet, maybe - has come into existence on the far side of the Sun. A tenth planet, a counter-Earth, something or other." But the Exalted have no need to guess its origin or its name. The narrow portal of the Lands of Light is no longer sufficient. The massed armaments of a whole mechanized world are being brought to bear against the Earth.

> (OOC) Morgan thumbs up.

The nations of the world are unified in a single high command. The military forces of the planet are prepared. They've been fighting the Alchemicals already, in those places where they haven't been subsumed entirely. A military analysis suggests that the Alchemical nuclear attack on Tijuana was in anticipation of this day. If we could not be destroyed by our own atomic weapons, at least we would be disarmed of them.

The Exalted report something else, though - an answer to that challenge. Things are emerging from the Chaos Frontier. People, machines, weapons, vehicles, places. Earth's dreams have been breeding weapons for this day, and the ambient Essence that's been accumulating all over the planet now gives them reality.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "more!"

Added to the miracles of the Exalted's inventors and scientists are the mundane arms of every nation's military might, and added to that are thousands of boats, aerostats, flying battleships, tanks, platoons of inhuman cyborgs equipped with high-velocity magnetic rifles, samurai wielding immaterial blades of force, and more still.

The Wyld itself has released such dreams into the world as man chose to give birth to. The Essence of Creation has not gone to waste.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "still more when you guys are ready for it"

> (OOC) Charity says, "Sure :)"

> (OOC) Benford says, "Wish I'd brought popcorn. o\_o"

> (OOC) Charity says, "We are armed with the might of the Oramus and the Dragon's Shadow."

> (OOC) Morgan says, "Go for it."

Aboard the Ranapura, the Exalted are taking dozens of reports. Text, video, and other media are hanging illuminated in the air of the central command room. "Our biggest problem is distance," one general is arguing. "We can't effectively project force to a distant planet without carriers."

Another message comes in. This from a fleet of aerospace craft which are communicating in Morse code. Curious that they won't even use voice signalling. Are they human? DEGROOT WILL HANDLE THIS. STAND BY.

> (OOC) Morgan says, "Oh hell."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Oh wow."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Everybody hold onto something."

There is an earthquake. This normally doesn't happen on flying cities, and everyone looks somewhere - at sensors, at readings, at each other - for an understanding. "The planet! She's moving!" calls one of the Dragon-Blooded at his station.

> (OOC) Charity says, "That's no planet.. it's a SPACE STATION"

Slowly, majestically, Earth itself changes its orbit. The Sun visibly jumps about in the sky as whoever has taken control makes some adjustments. Flickering, as day and night rapidly succeed each other in the span of a few minutes. And just like that, Earth is face to face with a metal sphere.

It's no moon, it's too big for that. The size of it is intimidating, even at the considerable distance between the two bodies. "Position stable with respect to the intruder," one of the Burgundy Terrestrials reports.

> (OOC) Charity poses fast ;)

> (OOC) FallGM says, "goferit"

"Funny... I thought you'd be taller," murmurs Charity. She is ready, and as she steps forward she calls upon the powers of essence, drawing it in deeply, her form rippling and changing, revealing a beautiful nightmare. "It's time at last."

> (OOC) Charity says, "The ultimate throwdown.. we are continuing the very purpose for which we were made originally.. to kill primordials."

"Sea-going vessels are being retrofitted with long-range rockets. ETA for conversion anywhere from 30 minutes to 12 hours," calls out a NATO comm officer over the strategic network. A discussion begins about air power, and Benford glances at his watch. 4 days 2 hours 37 minutes left.

> (OOC) Benford says, "I have something to say for the moment before the shooting begins, GM. Please flag when that comes."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "Goferit"

Benford mops his forehead and takes a personal interest in the retrofit. "We repurposed the Tijuana reactor farm into an SDI defense at the last minute... not that big a stretch, since each reactor was at heart a bloody great particle beam anyway. We'll do so again: high-energy laser lift." He snaps his fingers and begins sketching in the air, Ranapura's computers filling in the design behind him. "We focus the laser output from the ground-based power plant onto heat exchangers mounted to the ships, which expel seawater from their ballast tanks. The exhaust is high-velocity steam. The reactor farm is over a terawatt; with that kind of power, you could put the entire Pacific fleet into orbit. Including the _real_ USS Enterprise," he grins.

Two hours into the updated refit plans, a new voice comes over the network. "Ho there! My friends, I have solved your atmospheric problem with the help of a pair of employees of mine. You should be grateful to these two gentlemen for their assistance." "Get that guy on visual," barks Abel Burgundy.

A lozenge of light snaps into existence, frantically scanning the airspace around Ranapura. It centers on what looks like a crumpled beer can, floating under its own power towards the main fleet. "You guys will still need to breathe, yes?" The camera zooms in closer. Atop the enormous flying disc are several people. A man, a woman carrying a young child in her arms, and two other young men dressed in football jerseys, numbers 77 and 21.

> (OOC) Benford has reconnected.

Earth itself has moved; now the atmosphere begins to as well. The display Benford can see indicates that something is skimming nitrogen and oxygen off the top of the rest of the planet, and focusing it into a tightly-packed funnel, a bridge of breathable air opening the way to Autochthonia itself.

"What the hell are they doing?" Abel mumbles, glancing backwards at the Solars for answers.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "You're in a position where the bulk of your armed forces can literally either fly or jet their way to attack Autochthonia."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Oh, very good. o\_o The JYH crew."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Anyone want to answer?"

> (OOC) Benford takes it, then

> (OOC) FallGM says, "order the attack!"

> (OOC) Benford says, "GM, with your permission, I'd like to move the 'eat light' line here."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "edit however you like"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "if you lack permission, tell me what to swap"

> (OOC) Benford is working on it, one sec

"They've given us an aviable envelope all the way to the enemy," Benford replies. "What it means, is... Let Them Eat Light."

The war-ships of the NEG lift off. Suitably modified American carriers take off, finally able to use their complement of fighters and bombers. From the Japanese fleet, Tokugo has sent a special gift: the dredged-up remnants of the old ship Yamato, now flying to carry the spirit of his country to fight the invader. The air forces from half a dozen NATO countries. All are cooperating, with one purpose in mind: open the way through Autochthonia, to let the Exalted destroy their enemy.

And aboard Ranapura, the control programs notify Charity that something else is needed. The music box, created by Autochthon, or a suitable rendering of the song it contained. "The city can become a more effective weapon," they explain.

> (OOC) Benford hmm?

> (OOC) Charity is posing :)

The titanic form of the Lunar is ready for the request, and draws forth the music box. Charity works carefully, her huge fingers surprisingly gentle as she brings the song to life. The music that flows from Autochthon's Music Box comes from all directions and none, sounding in its simplicity a perfect harmony. "Fitting how everything comes together at the close," says the Full Moon.

And with that song, Ranapura itself begins to change. "Ahh, thanks. I'm borrowing your city as an avatar," comes Hugh's voice over the stratnet. "Is that okay?"

"This show is all about you, Hugh," calls Morgan. "Be our guest."

Charity laughs softly, "It's your birthday soon Hugh, we'll let you have a few presents ahead of time."

"Right!" And the city of Ranapura begins to change. Its golden exterior and magical interior shift, seamlessly weaving about its human inhabitants. And from the control room, whose surfaces are all transparent to give an unobstructed view of the outside world, the Exalted look down. The shadow of Ranapura flying over the Pacific in formation with the fleet is now humanoid.

> (OOC) Benford says, "The Wayward Son."

> (OOC) Benford would like to work that in. Geoff knows why

"The god of destruction comes for you, father!" calls Hugh, across all channels. The myths of the Gods and the Titans, of Zeus killing Cronus, of the sacrifice of parents for their children, all culminate here. The power of the song, of hope unsullied by doubt, resonates through the fabric of Ranapura. But Hugh has never stood on ceremony. The song becomes something else, a wholly prosaic tune that plays like a battle anthem across the stratnet of humanity's armed forces.

_Once I rose above the noise and confusion..._ Ranapura launches itself into the sky, followed by the vast armada of vessels, all primed for battle. _Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion..._ It breaks through the clouds, and the Earth lies visible behind it. A small blue world, fighting for its right to survive and live as it wishes, knowing now just what that will cost.

_I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high..._ Autochthon is not without its defenses. As the armada sails through the artificial wind-tunnel created by the people of the UFO, Autochthon opens fire. Explosions and holes rock the vessels accompanying Ranapura, striking some of them down like a wounded Icarus.

> (OOC) Benford says, "Oh, VERY good. :)"

_Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man, though my mind could think I still was a mad man..._ The size of the alien world beggars imagination. Even now, some of the men of NATO and the Arab Alliance are voicing their concerns about their ability to tackle this. _I hear the voices when I'm dreamin', I can hear them say..._ And Benford, hearing a distant voice calling to him, a song unknown to the others, points at the screen. "Concentrate all fire on that zone!"

_Carry on my wayward son!_ Ranapura blasts its way through the outermost layers of Autochthon's defenses, the autonomous satellites which ring the Machine God, feeling a new gravity assert itself. Around the city-made-man, a halo of incoming missile fire, lasers, plasma, and all manner of matter and energy converge. _There'll be peace when you are done!_ A hole big as a city is beaten into the shell of the Great Maker, and Ranapura punches its way inside. _Lay your weary head to rest, don't you cry no more..._

---

> (OOC) FallGM has more when you guys are ready to roll. you'll be more active here

> (OOC) Benford will do his best to keep up.

> (OOC) Charity says, "Onward :)"

> (OOC) Morgan says, "Go for it."

The soldiers of the Spark disgorge from Ranapura, streaming into the inner chambers of Autochthonia. All are armed. Many are supernatural. Around and behind them, other boarding parties are finding their way in through the gap. Outside, the navies and air forces of the world are fighting off Autochthon's robotic defenses, keeping the boarding parties from being flanked.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "alright. This is your time. Raise some hell."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "absolutely anything not concerning Wheeler or the final fate of Autochthon here is permitted."

> (OOC) Charity enters the fray.

This charge is led by the strongest of the exalted warriors. Charging ahead of all is Charity. The robots of the enemy she swipes aside like a feeble spider's web, rending lesser enemies without so much as a pause in the charge. For the children, for the fate of humanity, she will show no quarter this day. The greatest of the Alchemicals are arrayed against her and her allies, and from the first the stakes of battle are obvious.

> (OOC) Charity says, "More :)"

The warriors crash headlong into a phalanx of Alchemicals, and the crackling of essence rocks the entirity of Autochthon. Weapons of all kinds are brought to bear, and the Major finds work, shattering the enemy with blows so hard that they do not just create physical damage, but leave the enemies bleeding their very essence from wounds that none here have the time to tend to.

> (OOC) Charity wonders if others are interested in putting a pose in here? I have more, but would like to get a bigger picture of things first :)

> (OOC) Morgan will give it a shot

> (OOC) Benford will go third, and try to think of something cool.

> (OOC) Benford says, "And then more from Charity? Battle is her element."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Like Rubidium."

A Solar leads from the front. This is how it has been since the First Primordial War, and so it is in the Second. Morgan's unit is a compact team of skirmishers of all sorts - NEG stealth mecha, Navy SEALs on hoversleds, Air-aspected Dragon-Blooded, and Morgan in the middle of it all, finding and striking at enemy weaknesses with uncanny accuracy, then melting away before the Machineborn can retaliate.

> (OOC) Charity says, "Yeah, I have more :)"

> (OOC) Morgan says, "more"

Morgan himself flows amongst his men and women of war almost like a wisp. Enemy fire never causes more than the slightest ripple of his tunic, if that. At one point, the strong-willed Eclipse casts an intensely disapproving gaze at a machine-tower, and there is a glint as the sniper that would've drawn a bead on him retreats. _A lucky shot there,_ he thinks - only with the shreds of humanity that Charity and Benford unlocked in Autochthon would such a feat have even been possible.

And then, as the team is setting up for an ambush, a diaphanous raven alights on Morgan's shoulder. Morgan holds a whispered conversation, and then directs his team to move on. They are needed elsewhere.

> (OOC) Morgan says, "done for now."

> (OOC) Morgan says, "I figure that in the increased Essence levels, the Raven network is partially reified."

> (OOC) Benford throws something in

Benford fights sparingly, and mostly alone. He's not supposed to be a killer, but he is deadly-effective. In counterpoint to Jet's direct and brutal approach, and Morgan's hit and run tactics, Benford measures his violence with surgical precision and few words. His keen eye for technical detail find the few flaws in the defense, and exploits them. The biggest and baddest of the Maker's military machine are left in smoking ruin behind him, felled by a few well-placed beams from his war-form's crossbow.

> (OOC) Benford says, "Go"

The battle rages all around the exalted, and though the gaping hole behind them is held fast by the forces of man, the guts of this metal monster are alive with every horror of gear and engine, hideous and wondrous. Lying in the path of conquest lies what looks like a city, or perhaps a fortress, but Charity knows that it is no normal city. It is among the greatest of Autochthon's chosen, an Alchemical so vast it could fit in its walls the largest cities on Earth with room to spare.

The Full Moon charges ahead, this time blazing even brighter with essence and in her passing trampling enemies that are furtunate, and simply rending in two those that are unable to get out of the way. The Full Moon tears wide the gates of the Alchemical adversary and ramps up her destruction to an extent she never dared on Earth. The power filling her makes shattering whole buildings with a fist a trivial matter, and soon her enemy shows it is Aware of her presence.

The city does not come alive, for it always has been. It attacks, with streets that would swallow up the unwary, and every matter of weapon the Alchemicals can contrive it brings to bear. A million defenders are awoken. Yet in doing so, the mind that is the city is revealed, and Charity learns of its center. Its armies are not fast enough, it's weapons not furious enough to stop her until at last the Alchemical is forced to reveal itself in a battle form, a giant that towers over the entire battlefield.

> (OOC) Charity says, "Sorry if I'm slow n.n"

> (OOC) Benford says, "It's all yours."

> (OOC) FallGM checks others :)

A shield of glowing green energy forms in its left hand, and in its right a weapon of needles and gears and screaming energy comes to be. The weapon is swung with impossible speed and power, but the might of the Lunars is legend, it is the power that held back the unstoppable behemoths of the Wyld for centuries unaided, and Charity needs all of it to first catch the weapon in her hands, and still more power to put such a tremor through it that it shatters along its length, exploding so that the great giant falls back. She is on him in moments, shedding forms and attacking in the guise of a serpent, massive enough to inspire legends.

> (OOC) Benford says, "You know, if we've got a city-size enemy, we've also got a city-sized carrier to fight it."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "yeah. you have absolute license to use any of this stuff"

> (OOC) Charity says, "Ah, didn't think that Hugh could fit :)"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "He's a growing boy"

Charity winds around and around her enemy, struggling against his grip as she tries to find the mark she seeks. The Alchemical's attention is soon drawn fatally to another threat, as Hugh's fist comes crashing into his head, leaving little behind to strike. The distraction is just enough time for Charity to find her mark. Her bite is not powerful, but the venom she inflicts carries the very horror of the Wyld. It flows into the very soul of the enemy, so even as Hugh's blows flatten the Alchemical's human form, the buildings formed of his essence begin to rot, the essence maintaining them failing slowly at first, and then more and more swiftly, so that the walls collapse, dissolving into puddles of rot, and then into nothing.

> (OOC) Charity says, "There, just wanted to destroy a city n.n"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "you guys got more?"

> (OOC) Charity says, "I think I've done enough war spamming for now ^^;;"

> (OOC) Benford has something...

> (OOC) FallGM says, "goferit"

Benford weaves in and out of the trail of destruction. He estimates that the battlespace is roughly the size of Connecticut; everywhere around him are smashed machines, and more than a few dead humans. Every possible form of trauma is represented here, hundreds of times over. And it's only one small province of the Mad Machine God. All the armies of Earth - and a dozen imagined Earths - just to plow the road. He shakes his head, sadly and silently, and wades back into the war. _Well. For it to be worth itt, let's finish the fight._

> (OOC) Benford says, "Go on."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "alright. Barring some 80-line pose from Morgan which I don't anticipate, I'm steppin back in"

---

"Bad news, folks," comes the announcement over the stratnet. "The Sun just went out." The channel remains silent for awhile as people digest this.

For another battle has been fought, this in the empty and darkened streets of Yu-Shan. At the moment Calibration began, the Unconquered Sun returned to the city of the gods, and spoke a name. As the first god to be made, as perfection incarnate, Helios has shone bright. And when the first sun rose, it cast the first shadow. That shadow now emerges to fight with its maker, as its name falls from the god's lips: "Five Days Darkness, fight me."

As the humans and their allies in Autochthon waged their war, so did the God of War. As the world shook inside the Primordial's innards, so Heaven itself trembled as light and dark vied with each other.

> (OOC) Benford says, "... didn't see THIS coming."

> (OOC) Charity says, "So the name was finally uttered.."

> (OOC) Charity says, "I was wondering if you would remember, Bill. That threat the twisted Sidereal first revealed to us."

And as prophecied, the demonic manifestation of the Ebon Dragon falls before the Unconquered Sun's holy wrath. As prophecied, Yu-Shan is destroyed. And as prophecied, the Sun lies stricken, mortally wounded. Now there is time for one last duty.

> (OOC) FallGM says, "Of course I remembered."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "This is that prophecy coming to pass."

> (OOC) Charity says, "You are awesome ^^"

Arnon, the Dark Star, the Quisling Sidereal, was stopped. This is the true and proper moment for the Sun's death. He welcomes it. But the sun cannot set forever.

Pulled from his own fight, Andrew Morgan finds himself again in Heaven, staring at the bleeding and battered form of his patron god. "Got something.. more important for you now, my son," Helios whispers, leaning heavily on his sword and smiling. "One more choice to make."

> (OOC) Benford says, "I wasn't there for this, but it's cool. .\_."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "this is old GoE stuff."

Morgan draws himself to attention. Only his peripheral awareness takes in the ruin of Yu-Shan around him, for the Unconquered Sun who has come near to losing his name is the most important thing. "I'm ready."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Ruins... the city of the Gods? So this is Gotterdammerung and Ragnarok both, then."

The Sun extends his horn, and sword. "Remember.. the most important rule of swordsmanship," he coughs. "The blade is not your strength. If you govern justly and well, it need never be drawn. A new world calls for.. a new Sun. You've been promoted, soldier."

> (OOC) Charity says, "Essence +500, congrats Morgan ^^"

> (OOC) Benford says, "So he's out if this fight. '\_'"

This is enough to give even Morgan pause... for a moment. He is already the Chronicler of Yu-Shan, the man whose stories are destined, in the unseeable future, to usher in a new Heaven. But this responsibility, this charge is almost more than Morgan can fathom.

> (OOC) Charity says, "I'm not sure I'd say that.."

Almost.

Morgan kneels and takes up the sword and the horn. "You will not be forgotten, my Lord. I have already ensured that."

> (OOC) Morgan says, "I can imagine no better embellishment of this moment."

---

And in the whirling mercurial recesses of the Wyld, Charity finds herself face to face with a dying Luna. The ever-shifting moon-goddess has fought her own battle, and like her companion in the sky, has found her time at last. But she beckons Charity close. "Lissten, child," she whispers. "You pledged yourself. And there is now only one way to see that pledge through. It is to take my place."

> (OOC) Charity poses

The Lunar is disoriented for just a moment, but seeing her fallen Queen she moves swiftly forward, casting off the visage of war, the skin of the serpent shed to reveal just herself. "Take your place?" Charity's words are full of the disbelief of a child, rejecting the very thought, "How can I? You can't die.. surely there is one in the heavens who can save you. How could I be strong enough?"

"There is one who can save me, child.." Luna breathes, smiling faintly. "You. You, whose fate has always been to lose family. Yes, I've seen. Your friends, falling around you. Your lovers, your father.. I now offer you all the world as your family. Watch over them, will you?"

There is one last moment of rejection, as Charity embraces Luna, one sob of pain, and then quiet resolution. "I will. I will be their mother, and teach them to stand strong against whatever might stand in their way."

Charity smiles at Luna, "As you passed to me the first mantle in your service, I now take up the banner." There is no sword, no weapon to signal the passage of essence, instead, a passionate kiss, no sweet gesture of mother to daughter, this is the wild desire that all Lunars feel for their queen. Charity tasted it once before, when she lie dying and was given the choice that led directly down this path. This time, it is the last taste of lips that Luna shall ever feel.

Newton Benford bursts into the most central room he's been able to find yet. But his comrades and companions are no longer with him. Charity and Morgan have gone off the net - though he somehow isn't worried about this - and the other, lesser individuals with him have been pinned down or distracted.

> (OOC) Benford is here

He passes through some sort of energy field that leaves him tingling, causing a strange vacuum in his soul. His war-armaments of Essence are stripped away by the field, leaving only whatever mundane weapons he managed to bring. The presence of the Engine is gone, and yet he can still feel the surges of Essence. Magic flows around him, obedient to his will, but somehow different. Not lessened - changed. Autochthon taking his Engine back at last?

And in this final chamber, Wheeler is waiting. His duplicate holds nothing but an automatic pistol, and is pointing it at him. "Freeze."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Anything I can hide behind?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "not really. but at your level a gun is a joke."

As it happens, stripped of his engine, Benford's sole weapon is a single Beretta, totally identical to Wheeler's. The odds are even; Benford instantly assumes a firing stance and levels the weapon at Wheeler's head.

A dozen Assembled emerge from hidden recesses in the chamber, also armed. "Surrender, Benford," Wheeler orders. "I mean it. You won't get out of this alive, but it may go better for your friends if you give yourself up."

Benford spins into motion, not even wasting a moment to grin. By inviting mooks into the fray, Wheeler has provided Benford with something he didn't have before: cover. The air is filled with bullets, cutting down the Assembled. Benford empties all three of his magazines and is forced to scavenge a weapon from a downed foe, a nasty-looking machine pistol.

> (OOC) Benford says, "More"

But try as they might, neither Benford nor Wheeler can even scratch each other. And there's something else: Benford's own movements feel strange. It's not the essence of the Sun driving him, or the Engine. It's an unfamiliar kind of magic, but still seeing him through the fight.

When the last mook falls, Benford shelters behind it for a moment. "Too easy! What's the real game, Wheeler?"

The construct looks suitably shocked. "That's not possible," he says aloud. "That field - it removed the spark of Exaltation from you. The Great Maker took back the gift. You're as mortal as they come, Benford. How did you do that?"

> (OOC) Benford says, "Am I using Wheeler's capabilities? Through that... ring thing?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "nope. This is all you"

Benford grins. "Guess I'm just that good. New world, new rules. What about, you, Wheeler? You got my Spark back. Is it still your mission to kill me?"

**It is his mission to liberate the Essence from your body, more precisely,** comes a voice. The voice. Autochthon. **Newton Benford. You are right on time. I have used all of my Essence to stave off the inevitable. My death. Or my transformation. I cannot self-terminate. But, there is a device here, powered by Essence. Your Essence. It will accomplish your goal.**

Benford responds quickly. "So I still have to die to complete the plan, is that it?"

> (OOC) Benford says, "I'm not trying to draw this out. It's just something Benford would ask. He'll go through with it of course."

**You will die the way that I will die. Not the cessation of existence, but a transition into something else.** As Wheeler listens, uncomprehendingly, the voice continues. **Your counterpart misunderstood his role in this endgame. As do you, now. It is your nature to question. And to choose. What will you do?**

Benford sighs, and lets his weapon clatter to the floor. _Well. I've been living on borrow time for years anyway._ He rises from cover. "The same thing I always do: pursue the truth for the good of all. OK. Whatever we're doing, let's do it."

Wheeler steps forward as well. "Ironic," he mutters. "All this for a bloody science experiment. Fuck reproducibility, mate." A console smoothly slides up from the floor. Around him, Benford can feel the truth of the Maker's words. All of the great planet's Essence has been expended in its own defense, all to make himself vulnerable to this one attack.

On the console, a display appears. **FINAL FUSION: APPROVED.** Wheeler nods, and turns to Benford. "You ready, mate? I destroy myself in using you as a battery. Or we destroy each other. Or ... " He allows himself a grin. "Fusion."

Benford grins back. "How very apt." He extends a hand forward to the controls; there's a mirror set for Wheeler. "You know, this once, I think we should just push the button and see what happens. I'm ready."

The controls are activated. Machinery within Wheeler's body comes alive. Benford feels himself slipping away almost immediately; this was not intended to be a slow process. But as he dies, and as Wheeler collapses into pieces, each carrying a precious piece of Essence, he realizes that this is not the end.

"Global Assembly Operators Online," announces the console. "Mandala GAO. Quantum GAO. Stochastic GAO." Machinery in the innermost recesses of the Great Maker comes alive. "Reformatting.""

The bridge of air from Earth to Autochthon becomes a bridge of Essence. Torrents of power - the whole of the Chaos Frontier, and all its millions of dreams - is dissolved, devoured, and transformed. And at the heart of it, taking a river of power into himself, is Benford's own tiny pittance of Essence. But he is the pump, and from him a universe begins to emerge.

The comforting illusions of the Sun and Moon - gone. In their place, a tiny sliver of the available Essence is all that's needed to ignite a real Sun, as real as Gaia's world. The phantom moon, fallen with Luna in battle, replaced by one as material and reified as anything. The other planets. The Oort cloud. Out into the space-that-wasn't the wave expands.

The Wyld, collapsing, as its borders are eaten away by the endless hunger of a dying Primordial. The Raksha, the all-powerful, guiding that Essence into proper channels long since agreed upon. And their lesser cousins, the Fair Folk, taking on new and embodied forms, dancing across the cosmos and partaking of every dream humanity has ever had.

Benford sees it all. His Essence is woven into every line and vibration of this newly created universe. He is inseparable from it. In one infinitesimally small corner of it, he can see humanity, preparing to launch themselves into that void on a new voyage of discovery. The gods are gone, but their spirit remains. They will be hungry for new miracles. They will find them out here.

> (OOC) Benford says, "... coool."

And in the darkened ruin of Yu-Shan, the Sun and Moon come together for a new eclipse. The successors to godhood, plucked from the best that humanity had to offer, now have time alone with each other. To plan, and to celebrate, and to watch their children reach out for eternity.

> (OOC) Charity says, "Hmm, different idea :) one moment"

In Heaven, the two who are become Helios and Luna sit alone, but feel no loneliness. After a time, Luna murmurs, "And God saw the light, that is was good." After some time more, she turns to Helios, her hands taking hold of both of his, "Our children live in a world so _real_ now. What shall they do?" She looks around the quiet of heaven, smiling, "And what do you wish to do next?"

> (OOC) Charity says, "that is was good.. my typing is poor :)"

Helios squeezes Luna's hands. "Everything, and nothing. This is _their_ time. And yet.. you know what? I'm curious. So many stories they have to tell... I wonder what new ideas they've made up for themselves."

> (OOC) Benford says, "Does Benford have the capability or interest in making an appearance here, in his changed form? Or should we just leave him as an angel in the architecture, and personifying him will cheapen that?"

> (OOC) FallGM says, "the latter"

> (OOC) Benford leaves this moment for the veterans of both Eden Cycle games, then. :) "It's always you two crazy kids at the end."

Luna laughs quietly, settling comfortably in the embrace of the Sun. "My Lord is wise. Let's listen for a while to the songs they sing."

> (OOC) Charity says, "Of course eventually they'll have to get around to keeping that promise of peace for the exalts :)"

> (OOC) Charity says, "But I'm not sure we need go into that here. ^^"

> (OOC) Benford says, "I think I can dovetail something to that, if you want, GM."

> (OOC) FallGM says, "goferit"

> (OOC) Charity says, "That is my end pose, so the timing seems good ^^"

Human scientists imagine that the world began in fire, as an infinitely dense point from which all matter and light sprang. As the universe expanded and cooled, most matter concentrated into stars, and worlds, and the things that live upon them.

The matter that remains is the interstellar medium - a gas so thin that there might be only one solitary hydrogen atom in a cubic acre. But gas it is, and as every schoolboy knows, gasses will transmit sound through vibration.

The cosmos has a sound. If one listens hard enough, one can hear it in one's soul. It is the titanic collision of worlds being born, the shriek of them dying in fire, and the static hum of those that die in ice. It is the laws of physics being read aloud, and the laughter of children.

> (OOC) Benford bleh

It is music to Newton Benford's ears.
