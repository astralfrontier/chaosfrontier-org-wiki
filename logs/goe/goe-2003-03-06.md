# GOE-2003-03-06
It is morning in Nexus. The smells from the night before are fading, replaced with the scent of bakers and other merchants peddling their wares in the morning. People mill about in the streets, their day now begun. Ramar walks slowly down the maze of alleys Rabby led them through before, keeping his eyes peeled for signs of the Lunar. When he finds the door, he knocks, waits for the slit to open, and will ask for entrance while making the sign he'd been taught.

The door creaks open; the dojo is empty of regular students, for now, though a handful of acolytes busy themselves by sweeping the floors. The sweet smell of _liet na_ tea being brewed permeates the low-roofed school, and smiles on the faces of the disciples show a contentment with their lot, despite the menial work they perform.

Ramar steps inside, moving through sweet scents and sweepers alike. He looks around carefully, and pauses to appreciate the contentment of the disciples _It must be peaceful here. In its own particular fashion._ He approaches one of the disciples. "Good morning to you. I hope I am not to rude with my interruption, but I have come seeking a friend. I was here with her and another friend not too long ago," And Ramar goes on to describe Rabby, as well as Chi-Yosh's performance that day. "Has she been around here lately?"

"Not today," the young woman answers. "If you wish to wait for your friends, please join us in cleaning. Otherwise, peace be with you." And with a smile, she returns to her duties.

"Very well then," replies Ramar. He seems content to wait, "I do not mind waiting. What duties may I assist with?" Nostrils flare slightly at the mingling of the _liet na_ with the dirt being pushed along. "I might not know how to use a pair of hooked swords, or a sai, but I believe I can wield a broom capably enough. And I hope to see my friend." He smiles sheepishly, "I owe her an apology."

"Please, take over here," the acolyte says, offering her broom. "I will see to the training dummies." And so saying, she departs to take up her new duties.

"Alright." And so Ramar takes up the broom, and guides it along the floor, bristles scraping softly as dirt and debris is gathered into a small pile. He looks curiously at what duties the training dummies require. _If I do not see her here soon, I shall find a sifu, and ask if it is known where she might be._

Time passes. Morning becomes day, as the Unconquered Sun shines his face across Creation. As he moves, so does the life of the world; slowly, serenely. Cleaning is finished; Ramar is escorted to other duties by friendly and courteous acolytes. In due course he is offered tea.

The 'sign of the Mouse', the gesture that permits unrestricted entry to the dojo, is no longer a mystery. Out of the corner of his eye, Ramar observes the silent scurrying of tiny white forms as they drift about the dojo, while the human occupants take their meals.

Ramar takes a closer look at the tiny white forms scurrying about, his senses narrowing to the point where the mouse is all he observes, then expanding out, heightened. The scent of the tea fills his nostrils, and he sips slowly. "It is good," he states, smiling softly. _I wonder if she is masquerading as one of them..._

The interval of tea is concluded, and the acolytes make to return to their jobs. It seems there is heavy lifting required, since the school's supplies of rice, millet, vegetables and potable water are let in via underground passages, and there are no dumb-waiters or elevators. Everything is hauled by hand, and Ramar is silently invited to assist further.

The Solar assists further. He takes hold of whatever he can manage to haul, and begins lifting it up. As he does this though, he'll watch the tiny mice scuttling about, keeping his eyes open for anything odd, or maybe a familiar scent. _Although how would I find her if she was hidden as a mouse? How can one tell?_

On his way up, Ramar pauses, the pack of vegetables is kept in his arms as he causally glances Rabby's way. Or what he believes to be Rabby's way. "I'm sorry you know. You don't have to stay hidden though. I'd like to talk, if you would."

The little mouse gives a squeak, its eyes wide. It scurries off in a hurry, confirming Ramar's suspicions.

"Alright," he calls after the mouse, "I only wished to apologize. Perhaps we will talk later." Ramar returns to his task. He continues lugging the supplies upstairs, until the supplies are all brought up.

While taking a rest, Ramar happens to notice the door to the dojo opening. It's Rabby, looking somewhat meek. She treads carefully, head bowed. "Stupid," is the first word out of her mouth, but it's not spiteful or cruel.

"Yes, I am." Ramar turns towards Rabby when she walks in. "I'm glad to find you though. I was beginning to worry that you'd disappeared into the city for good."

The Lunar girl shrugs. "I couldn't just run away," she says, sounding a little defiant. "I won't be beaten by the likes of you, you.. nain-ya." Pointedly ignoring her own rank, she continues. "Anyway, I was here watching you, to see if you'd really stick at it and wait. Thank you for not letting me down."

"It is the least I can do, Rabby. And no, I'd suspect you'd be hard pressed to be beaten by me." Ramar smiles. "Come and sit down, if you'd like." And now it Ramar who keeps his head bowed, "I apologize Rabby... for... well, you know."

Rabby shakes her head quickly. "You understand now, don't you?" she asks. "I spent so much time with Prowler, but to me, the idea of the Way is sort of natural. I can feel it in me as easily as I could feel my own heartbeat. But you.. I don't think you have it. And still, you came here, and understood somehow."

"I think so. I understand a little better. And what I said goes against what feels natural to you. Goes against all that you have learned, yes? Or at least, I have thrown it in your face. I didn't mean to. That came from ignorance, not malice, though it makes little difference in the end." Ramar pauses, "It is possible for anyone to learn though. Or to at least understand."

Ramar says, "Even me."

Rabby nods slowly. "And you made amends. You do understand the Silver Way, Ramar. It makes me happy to know I can trust you."

"And it makes me happy to know I am to be trusted." Ramar sits back, examining Rabby thoughtfully. "I shall not treat your trust lightly. Thank you."
