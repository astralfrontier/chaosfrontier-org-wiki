**Marina's Story**

Straightening her clothes, Marina looked around the cave, catching each person's gaze in turn. Eye contact, experience and her father had taught her, goes far in bringing together concord from discord. And there was always discord; enough to feed the family well. Discord had served her well, and would continue to serve her for ages to come, it seemed.

She looked, lastly at the Master, one eyebrow raised. Her back straightening, she strode to a place where she could see everyone at once. Her voice was low, just loud enough to be heard, but soft enough that her listeners strained to make out the words. "I was born the first daughter, and fifth child, of a man of peace. My father was a master negotiator, and people turned to him when they were ready to settle their feud." She smiles. "My father was a great man, in the back halls of castles, where he was accorded every courtesy by the other servants."

She pauses a moment, then continues. "My brothers, four in all, were good strong men. Well trained in the arts of courtly war. Comely to look upon." Her face twists a trifle. "Too comely. In time each of them angered a woman. Each of them was ... betrayed."

Chi-Yosh listens with rapt attention, the transition from Ramar's story to this one takes some time, but he isn't about to miss the details. Watching Marina, his lips purse at the misfortune foretold.

Looking at the Master, she smiles very very drily. "With each betrayal, my father died a little more. A thin husk, frail in the wind, was my teacher. He taught me what he knew, and sent me forth to barter with feuding princes, barons, dukes, merchants ... For a negotiator it is the purse that counts, not the rank."

"Betrayed? How were they..." Ramar stops himself short, glancing up at Marina. He falls silent then, and still, listening to her tale intently. "What lands did you learn in, if it might be made known?"

Her hand caresses her cloak, pausing as her fingers touch a spot of particularly fine embroidery. "I learned in all these lands, Ramar. When the last of my brothers died, blood feud was declared against our family, and we became anathema. Now I negotiate in blindness." She smiles, slowly. "Or perhaps not blindness. My father knew ways to learn, and to see what was hidden. Some I may have learned." Her face stills, the expression icily cold. "Four brothers. Four betrayals. Each, Ramar, was different. Yet ... each time one side was led by a lady. Each time that lady fancied herself in love. My brothers were not wise enough to avoid their honeyed traps. One died, when his lady's husband discovered them in the solar. Another was betrayed when she lost interest. The last two brothers learned, and were betrayed when they refused the ladies' love."

Chi-Yosh has not much to say to this sad tale. No need to pry into what needn't be pryed into, what obviously is a painful subject. But he is here, none the less, and in his silence, would offer his support to the woman.

Marina looks around. "And so I came to be the only one left. My father faded more with every passing year. Every treaty I brought to him brought him less pleasure, until at last he could not care at all. It was then that he faded away." She smiles. "After his death, I negotiated the first treaty for the Master." She grins at the Master. "A negotiation that could have gone much worse." She pauses at his expression. "Or could have gone much better; without my father's wisdom I was but an untried child, and both sides tried me. Thoroughly." She smiles at Chi-Yosh's silent encouragement, fingers relaxing against the cloak, stroking it carefully.

"Contract followed contract, negotiation followed negotiation. You see, Ramar, when two sides cannot agree, they hire an arbitrator. Someone who negotiates a truce between them. Before I take the contract, I must know what terms each side desires, and whether I can reconcile them. For if I take a contract, and cannot bring a peace, it is my life that becomes forfeit." A single shoulder moves, in what might be called a shrug.

A bowing of the head is given, and Ramar shifts slightly in his seat. He glances up at Marina, smiling to her, "Yet you are here. And you have learned as well as taught." Both eyebrows raise with curiosity upon hearing of this exploit. "You negotiated a treaty for the Master?" He cannot hide his surprise. "Although I do see, and am well aware of an arbitrator. What trials did this negotiation bring for you?"

Marina chuckles. "The Master's first contract was a simple shipping dispute." She glances over at him. "Three ships went out, two ships returned bearing three crews. There were four sides to the negotiation, as three captains each demanded their share, and there were only two shares to be had. A treaty was presented that pleased all sides, but as the Master observed, it rewarded that Captain who had betrayed his fellows to pirates; all three had fought bravely, and only a single ship was lost, but who was it who had warned the pirates? When the treaty was presented, that question remained unanswered. There are suspicions now, but as yet the Master still lacks proof." She smiles. "Proof I should have presented."

"There are dangers in being too well-informed," rumbles the Master, before he subsides into silence once again. "Marina has learned this, as her story to you shows."

"Indeed." Ramar settles back now, pondering Marina. "You've taught me much since the Master was kind enough to bring me here. I thank you for this." He then regards the Master, "It seems as though well-nigh everything in this world is dangerous... yet were we to choose the paths which have no danger, our lives would raerly affect anothers, and the world would cease to change, for better or worse."

Marina shifts, nodding minutely. "That was another contract I negotiated for him. I knew his opponent well, and the trade dispute was a simple one. I knew too much in fact, and the treaty I presented included ... included details they had both considered secret. I walked the edge a little too closely, and it was only with the Master's warning that I escaped the traps his opponent laid. To this day, I avoid that family most assiduously, I assure you."

"Which contract was this?" Ramar's curiosity is piqued. He's never had the opportunity to hear this tale from Marina and now... "What trap was laid before you?"

Letting go of her cloak, she holds her hands open. "Shall you tell, Master? These are still your secrets."

"The rulers of Great Forks, miles west of here, are a trio of spirits," explains the Master, gruffly. "Their spies and informants are inhumanly gifted. They are not to be trifled with, and yet their command of the Eastlands' waterways is not inconsiderable." He says no more, lapsing back into that impenetrable wall of silence which characterizes him.

"Ah..." says Ramar, before realizing that the silence is in fact tha Master settling back to be himself. _He's revealed all that he feels needs revealing._ "When did you realize you were Exalted, Marina?"

Looking at Ramar, Marina smiles. "Some secrets remain ... secret." She looks around again. "As the negotiations grew more lengthy, and more challenging, I learned more about humanity, learning to read their emotions, their petty desires, their hidden wishes. I learned the art of listening. Sometimes, I knew as I went in what I would find. Sometimes I would learn things in ways I did not understand. There was no moment of truth, there was no moment of light, or exaltation, as others have described it. Rather, I slowly gained mastery." She smiles. "The Master spent a long night convincing me of what I had become. When it comes to you slowly, it creeps in the night."

Chi-Yosh leans forward, though, his attention piqued at the mention of spirits. Though, equally he can understand that with things of this matter, more is said by saying nothing.

Marina pauses for a moment, then sweeps a low bow. "Thus, my tale concludes." She grins for a moment. "There will, naturally, be a quiz." She looks at the Master, and then at each of the others. "After all, there was so _much_ ground covered."

Ramar leans forward as well. His eyes dart from the Master to Marina, watching them closely as they speak. He rests his gaze with Marina while she spins her tale. When she speaks of reading emotions and desires, he nods slowly. "Indeed. A Quiz. Will it be multiple choice?"

Chuckling, Marina looks at Ramar. "Naturally. You have the choice of learning to read the questions before you answer, or of assuming that the questions and the answers will be related. The oldest choice of them all." Her voice chills, a little. "A choice we will all be making, I am sure."

Ramar nods, "I'm certain. All things are related, in some way or another, even if it's only by the fact that they're not related at all." He then ponders, "Still, the choices lay before us. And I am no doubt waxing inanely poetic..." with that, he falls silent.

Marina smiles. "If there are no other question ... I yield the floor."

**Ramar's Story**

The sun sets off in the distance, tainting the horizon with it's purple, red, and amber hued light. The cloudless Southern sky begins the slow process of cooling the Sun-Cooked desert. A lone figure rests atop a sand-dune, clad in a simple desert-cloak. Scattered at his sides are a long-since emptied yeddimskin gourd. _The stars were shining the night of my birth. That much I remember._

The stars were indeed shining that night, the first time in many a night in the Coral Isles. The stormclouds had finally passed overhead. It had been one of the worst storms of the season, lasting a ten days and almost eleven nights. This was the first thing Ramar had ever seen. "Is he...?" asked a whispered voice from nearby... "Yes. And the mother will live as well, as long as we get to port soon." The cargo ship rocked astride waves not yet over the storm before reaching a safe harbor.

The Sun and Moons continued their dance about Creation, bringing with them the marking of the years. Ten had gone by since _The Crow's Bastion_ had put ashore in the Coral Archipelago. Ramar had been serving aboard the very same ship for a good five of those years. "'Ey! Ramar! Get yer bleedin' 'ead out of the clouds and yer arse off the decks and get t'swabbin it. Lest ye feel the Bosun's Daughter." Ramar sat up, alarmed. "Aye Cap'n. I was just lookin' at the mainsail... seems torn..." "I'll get someone t'fix it. Now... get t'work!" Ramar dutifully obeyed, returning to his deck swabbing duties. "Someday, I'll sail my own ship, and swing from the riggings..."

A wry grin was wrapped around Ramar's face. Even in a situation like this, he could appreciate the irony of words he'd uttered in what seemed to be almost a lifetime ago. Of course, he was 13 now. _The Crow's Bastion_ was in bad shape. Half of the crew had been wiped out in an attack by Azure Pirates. Those remaining were faring poorly. They'd managed to repel the vicious pirates... "Three more cap'n. Sloops by the look of 'em. There's no way we can outrun them with the damage we've taken on." The captain spat an oath that did the fame sailor's mouths have justice. "Alright. Smitty, ye and Ramar climb the mast. Start soakin' the sails. If they catch us we're dead."

The boat barely escaped the pirates. Although death at their hands might not have been as bad as the fate that lay ahead of them. The boat was rapidly taking on water, faster than could be pumped or bailed out. "We're sinking..." shouted one of the sailors. Ramar called down from the crow's nest, "There's a group of islands not too far ahead. I think we've come far enough East now. Think we can make it?"

_Perhaps, if someone else had been in the Crow's nest then, we might've.... no... there's no time for regrets here. To dwell on the past is to ignore the present... had someone else been up there, the islands may never have been spotted and we may well have died._

The sun shone brightly. Brighter than it did to the West. It had been two months since Ramar had been taken from _The Crow's Bastion_ and been given slave's bonds. Today was like many a day. Except today was altogether different. Today he was to be sold. The market was bustling with human activity. Rich merchants desiring cheap labor, or a delightful comcubine came first, taking their places near the front of the stands. Behind them were those who came to watch the spectacle. They were there to be reminded that their own lives, sorry though they may be, were not this bad, or simply to gawk at the concubines. Ramar was sold to a merchant caravan, due to head Southwards to collect a few talents of Firedust and Jade.

"Stop dreaming boy." The caravan driver's voice was as harsh as the biting wind that flew without restraint here between the Dunes. "If you don't keep your eyes open, you'll be blind to the world around you." Ramar looked up. "I am sorry/

"Stop dreaming boy." The caravan driver's voice was as harsh as the biting wind that flew without restraint here between the Dunes. "If you don't keep your eyes open, you'll be blind to the world around you." Ramar looked up. "I am sorry." "Not half as sorry as you will be when they catch you sitting abo-" "I was told we'd paid for a hard worker, Kalam. It seems we've hired little more than two lazy wastes of life." A third, much angrier voice piped up then. "A desert-spawned rat and this wretch we bought in Chiaroscuro. I believe you had said a sacrifice may ensure our journey's success? Here are two."

That night the Sun painted the Mesa walls a beautiful crimson red. The same color of the blood seeping from Ramar's bindings. He was bound to a stone beside the Caravan Driver. They were to be sacrificed to the demons, to grant protection. Or so the man with the knife had said. Kalam, he'd been called. At least to his face. The other merchants feared this cultist, and with the wicked gleam in this man's eyes, Ramar could understand why. The Caravan Driver was the first to be sacrificed. His blood stained the stone, but before much else could be done, the cultist fell over, lying atop Ramar. Cold dead eyes stared into his own, and blood pooled around the wounds that the arrows left in him. All around Ramar, voices as rough as the rocks about had been arguing. One seemed to win sway and he felt his bonds being cut.

The desert raiders camp was barren to foreign eyes, though over the last five years, Ramar had grown used to it. He'd learned to see the subtle elegeances that the band allowed themselves. A dew-catcher laid atop a stone, then bound into a sand-spider's web. A sand-blasted sculpture, created by The Breath of the Desert. "I still do not see why we're out here, Golan." "We are here because we are leaving for the deep desert. The Merchant's scouts draw nearer each day, and it grows less safe for us." Ramar recognized his fellow bandit's tone. It was more questioning. A riddle lay hidden within his words. "In fleeing we risk the storm," answered Ramar. It was then that he heard Golan laugh brightly. "Good. You're coming with us. And now that you know enough to survive... perhaps you'll live longer..."

"It was Golan who taught me to survive... it was he who helped me through the deep desert five years ago when the tribe moved!" shouted Ramar, his voice as soft as sand yet tinged with an anger that no one could mistake. "And now... now you would have me kill him to prove my loyalty to you? Now... now you would have me take the life of one whom I owe my very blood and water to?" "Yes." This new leader's voice was cold. Cold and dreamless. They had said that his time in The Wyld had left him this way. He and a few of his warriors had taken over the small tribe of nomadic bandits. It had been bloody, and Ramar was given an offer. "Kill him and swear fealty to me. Or die. His life is forfeit either way."

Spit upon the ground. The insult was clearly stated. The blades had been swung at Ramar, yet he had learned to be where they wouldn't be. He ran out of the Wyld-tainted leader's yurt, fleeing as fast as he could. A storm was in the air. The sky was darkened by clouds, and a fierce breeze was bringing the sand from the ground to their faces already. It was a powerful storm, seen only towards the Deep South, just between points where the rain ceases to fall and where the clouds give way to almost unending sun. The bandits gave chase, but Ramar had adopted to the desert well. These Wyld-tainted ones... had not. "Let him go. He won't survive storm."

_The storm... the storm will consume me. Yet I can run no further. I can find no shelter. Here I face my past, and my present. Here atop this dune, I shall meet my end. The sand comes to swallow me._ He had ran for three days into the desert, before collapsing. The storm had turned then, and seemed to swallow the land in all directions around him. Even the Sun seemed to be swallowed by the moons. **Yet, you will live, Ramar.** Another voice, a presence as gentle and fierce as Creation itself became known. A bright golden and white light seemd to envelope the edges of his closed eyes. Visions of his past flashed before him... and then... visions of times before he was born. Visions of ruins he'd never seen, visions of faces he'd never known. **You are Chosen, child. Will you answer the call?** "What are you?" cried Ramar, though in the depths of his very soul he knew. **You know what I am. You know now what you are.** Voices, dozens of them echoed in his head now. Voices from ages long pas

Voices, dozens of them echoed in his head now. Voices from ages long past. Each voice became a brief image... a flash of a faded reflection in his mind. Each image became a path laid out before him. Here a warrior shouted great boasts of his battles, and a Scholar promised inventions the likes of which the world had never seen. They had been before. They wished to be again. Frantically, Ramar scrambled for a semblance of understanding. He found what he sought within the golden light shining from himself. "You show me what has been... yet... I know that to accept... I know that I will never be who I am now again. You must know... neither will you." The images shouted. Some of them cried out in protest. A few images grew dark and fearful... yet all were silenced and banished by the pure golden light. All was calm before him. The storm of choices had long since faded, as had the desert's howling winds. Ramar opened his eyes and found himself sitting atop the dune, unharmed.

_What have I become?_ The question has been foremost in his mind until now. _I have become myself._ It is then that his eyes truly open to the world around, taking in more than simply the sand scattered as far as the eye can see and he finds himself staring into the eyes of the Master. "Come with me. There is much you need to be taught."

**Chi-Yosh's Story**

Chi-Yosh lets the story be passed to him, and takes a moment of collection, before spreading his hands. "My tale is not as grand, or in such detail as yours. It is simply that I left my village, and went onward, before finding you. But, there is more understanding beneath that statement." He clears his throat, and ponders for a few moments. HIs expression remains the calm, almost expressionless visage.

"I come from the Su'Katans. We are a village within the heart of a forest a month from the Maze Forest, where you found me." He relaxes back into the chair. "The Su'Katans are very peaceful. Mainly because we are prepared to deal with what may fall at our door, while never showing up at another's. We are a tree in the forest; strong, tough, resilient, but there we stand, rooted. The Su'Katans were said to have been born of the very earth, given life in Creation from sculptures of wood and stone, birthed of the soil and all around it. The traditions date back hundreds of years, but no one knows the true origins; though, the village I am from has been inhabited for three hundred years; my people split, at some time, and moved to the site, and let their roots ease into the soil."

Chi-Yosh gestures with his hand along the table. "The village is wonderful. It is near a waterfall, in the heart of the forest. We depend on the lands around us for our survival, and thus, it is due respect for that help. Much care is taken. Fishing only so many times between one moon and the next. The same with hunting. The soil aside the river is built for growing, and while there is not a large amount of farming, crops are grown in very small quantities, where space is found - not made. We also keep the members of the village low, for the fewer mouths to feed, the less amount of food is needed, the less we take without returning, around us."

"And that is what began my trip," Explains the Su'Katan. "I have a teacher, a wisewoman who instructed me in the ways of the world, and trained me. I had a gift - she could have saw the potential of being a solar - but she trained me, to send me out into the world." Chi-Yosh glances at his hands. "She had explained to me that, I have hands. Very strong, capable hands. Others do not. It is better to let those hands give aid to those who do not, because I can, and they cannot. Just as those with no food need those who have it."

A quiet nod. "She knew at my birth, perhaps," Chi-Yosh admits. "I was treated like any other child, but upon reaching the age of ten, I was to be her apprentice. Among the training that all the village recieves, she taught me further. Medicines, knowledge, and things set apart from the ways of hunting and defense passed down from the older to the newer. In many ways, my teacher honed, sharpened everything I was taught by others, where the customary teaching was the making of clothes, she tightened, and tailored them to fit better to me."

"I set outward, with no direction except the path that my feet gave me. I wished to see what my eyes would allow, and went." An absent smile, as those hands draw to lace fingers together. "There were troubles along the way. Skirmishes, but I had learned from those. But some of the most vibrant experiences, where being one with the landscape. Like a breeze across the skin, a prickling."

Marina smiles slowly, looking Chi-Yosh over carefully. "A healer and a student walks among us."

The hunter draws his finger along the table in demonstration. "It took me many days to encounter another person. Rather odd. They were hunters, from what I could gather, but were using bows. The bow is not used by my people; the tool is not widely known, but it has been tradition, our way of life, to not use things of that manner; some even scoff at throwing thigns, spears, and much like my own. Our hunters are taught to be like the snake; to lay in wait, or creep up to their prey. To strike swift and fast. It is difficult to master this, and one reason we do not claim that much hunted food; those thta are not fast enough to get away are culled, and we honor those."

"So, I came across these hunters, who were perched in a tree with their bows. There was nothing for them to strike, and so I slipped up to them, and I nearly sprouted feathers of my own." Chi-Yosh smiles ruefully. "And so I sat to speak to them. They were hunting a wild boar. A rare thing in that area. It seemed very odd to me. It seemed they sought the death of the boar as some from of prize, or mantlepiece. Some did that, whom I knew; but the pelts and parts of the animal were worn with the utmost respect, not as items. We had a lenghty discussion. I left, to avoid to much of a disagreement."

Marina chuckles, listening to Chi-Yosh's tale. It strikes her as odd to honour the weak, rather than the strong. To thank the victim for losing, rather than praising the victor for winning.

Absently speaking with his hands, Chi-Yosh continues. "There is something about the open lands that is set apart from this room, from this marvel of stone and earth. It is... less closed in. This castle forbodes, looms, it protects while it hides and pens those inside In. But the trees and grass, rivers and fields as far as one can see, it is immense, it is humbling, but welcoming. " His tone suggests just a touch of homesickness for those lands once more.

"I was drawn towards the Maze Forest, where the jaguar men were, merely because... That was the way I was walking. But there may have been more. I do not know; I felt drawn to merely to walk with the sun's path across the sky. It took soom time to get there, but met little opposition. Interesting, now that I think about it. But the more I travelled into the Maze Forest, the more I felt a pull. An itch on the soles of my feet that kept me driving. It became less of a mere direction and more of something sought, something that ached; my being was called, as it were, and here I went with that call."

Chi-Yosh smiles in genuine peace, considering this part. "I eventually came upon a grand stretch of groved trees, tall and canopied with green more blessed then I'd ever saw. There was a brief rain, while the sun beamed down, making everything glisten in rainbows of light." His hands talk with the imagry, "The very air crackled with life and it felt... living. There was almost a singing to it. A presence to what had drawn me, kept tugging at my heart and feet."

"I eventually found what was calling me." Chi-Yosh's hands begin to weave with the details, shaping the building. "Like... a hive of kultan wasps. It was partially spiraled, and the great stonework of this... hut was beautiful. Ivy and vines grew across it like clothing. As soon as I saw this place, I knew it was ment to be seen by me. The inside was not too large, but the very ground almost glowed. I removed my shoes before going in; the very soles of my feet burned with ... I do not know. I fell to my knees, and dug my fingers into the soil, and peered over the small pool that collected in the center of the hut."

Chi-Yosh smiles wistfully. "I saw into the deep waters of it; deep into the ground. My fingers dug into the dirt, and I could Feel it. The wetness, the weight of the water through the dirt. I could feel everything, like a heart's drum, through my fingers, the deeper they sunk into the soil." Hands miming the actions, "I felt the plants breathe around me. A butterfly on a flower, outside. The sun, being soaked up by everything. And stared deeper into the pool. I drank the air, tasted the sun, smelled the water. I..." His features draw up into a confused look, as if the proper words are lost to his tongue. "I simply... was everything."

"Those feelings, new thoughts came to me in pulses, ebbing in and out like ripples, and my mind and body buzzed. I was on fire, from it all. I looked up, and saw the sappling that grew out of the pond, craddling a stone," Chi-Yosh extracts something from his pocket, a stone shimmering, almost clear, the color of moss clinging to a tree's trunk. "It called to me, and I drew up, strode through the water, and claimed it. And then I heard the roar of the jaguar men. They had smelled me, I can guess."

Spreading his hands, gripping the hearthstone between the sides of two digits, "I fought, I fled. I believe the... little hut may have been some holy ground to them, or who knows? But they were very angry, and I did not wish to stop and ask them about their displeasure." A smile comes from Chi-Yosh. "And from there, you know."

**Davron's Story**

Davron nods to Chi-Yosh as he finishes his tale. "And so it comes to me." He clasps his hands, resting them on the table. "My story starts closer to home - in a minor village, not so far from here. Arzas is not particularly distinguished, but they do have a local reputation for good bows - and as the eldest son of the village bowyer, I grew up knowing that the reputation was going to rest in my hands, to build or destroy. And my father was bound and determined that I would not be the one to destroy it."

Marina peers at Davron. "And here I thought you a clerk, to the manner born ..." She smiles.

Ramar has moved very little during the telling of the tales, save for the eyes. Each and every movement is caught and noted, focused primarily on those telling the tale. "And yet you've ended up here... perhaps your reputation will be more than you thought? But this is an idle thought, please continue."

Davron looks at his hands. "Truth be told, I'd rather not have borne that burden. Bows, fine as their craftsmanship may be, are implements of war and death, and..." He pauses, smiling at Marina. "I had much rather become a scholar - learning what I could, and guiding others in the ways of knowledge. While I've been here, I've pursued that as much as I could - although the Master still encourages me to maintain my other skills."

Smiling, Marina inspects the young scholar's - bowyer's - hands. "Still fletching, too, I see." She looks at the Master, sideways. "He does believe in maintaining what one holds, yes."

"For as much as I may have wanted otherwise, I _was_ good with the lathes, the glues, the tools of woodworking." Davron smiles with some measure of pride. "My father was a stern taskmaster, but as often as not he was pleased with my work - he felt sure that I would preserve his reputation, and perhaps even surpass it."

"And with good reason. It is said to be ignorant of the past, is to be doomed to repeat it, others may say it is to be trapped by it. A dangerous line to walk indeed, yet knowledge, in all forms, can be meaningful." Ramar bows a head towards Davron, "It is good that your father was pleased with your work."

Davron says, "Of course, my work had to be tested as well, and it was the lore of our family that one could not know the quality of a bow unless they could use it as well. If I was a good bowyer, I was a better archer; and yet I was less pleased with that, because I feared that if our village went to war, I would be called upon to fight."

"War... fighting... death... none of these are pleasant. Sadly, all of these are realities in this world. Perhaps in the next, such things may not be so prevalent... yet to gaze into the Shadowlands..." Ramar falls silent then. "Why was the call to fight a fear of yours?"

Davron shakes his head. "I was... foolish, then. Even more than now, I mean. I don't like death, or killing, and I thought people should just try to find better ways to solve their differences. I didn't reckon that there are some people who thrive on fighting, nor how hard it is to show them ways to avoid it." He smiles at Marina. "I admire you for your skill at that, Marina. I wish I'd met you then, that you could've taught my naive self how hard that can be."

Pausing a moment, taken aback at that praise, Marina looks intently at Davron. Praise? For weeks, she's heaped invective on invective, cut upon cut, and still. Will these boys never learn? Still ... she pastes a smile on her face. "I'll have the teaching of that lesson yet, Davron."

Likely as not... Ramar peeks up from his seat, peering between Marina and Davron. He smiles, "It is a worthwhile lesson to be learned. One I hope the rest of the world will learn, someday."

Davron chuckles softly. "No doubt. Well, as it happens, it turned out that I needn't have feared that I would have to go out to fight, for instead the fighting found us. I never did find out who had sent the mercenaries against us, or for what cause. Some foolish dispute, or maybe just greed. But I was old enough, and when my father went to man the ramparts, I followed with my own quiverful."

Davron looks around the table, his voice dropping slightly. "Some of you have seen fighting, I'm sure. You know how it is when you fight your first battle. The screaming, the noise, the whoosh of arrows past you..." He sighs, looking ashamed. "And I cowered behind the wall, barely daring to poke my head out to return fire. Father was so mad at me... he was so angry that he grabbed me by the collar and shook me. And when he did so, his head was exposed. Just for a moment..." Davron trails off, his eyes glistening.

"And as I'm sure you found out... a moment is all it takes." Ramar's voice is soft, sad. There's a hint of a melody to his speech when he utters this phrase, as though some wistful melancholy song has worked it's way from his mind to his speech. His eyes moisten slightly, though he blinks back whatever was welling up at the surface. "I do not know of many who are without fear... none who are in a fight." His voice has taken on a softer, calmer, soothing tone now, as though it were a hand placed on a shoulder.

Davron takes a deep breath. "The grief, the rage... the guilt... he'd intended to shock me, shame me into fighting. But I... I don't think he'd meant to do it... that way..." He shakes his head, as if to clear it. "I don't remember very clearly what happened after that. I remember taking up my bow, standing straight up and crying out in defiance, forgetting my fear, and pulling an arrow out of my quiver. And... I remember feeling as if my head was on fire." He raises a hand and touching it to his forehead. "Right here."

A hand idly raises to his own forehead, tracing a slow circle over his caste mark. Ramar has taken to painting his lately, when he's within the safety of the castle's walls. "Your mark of Illumination. Your Caste Mark..."

Following the trend, Marina places fingers on her own forehead, before pulling her bangs foreward firmly, covering anything that might have been visible. Her cloak, too, is pulled around her, and she begins to pace along the wall.

Davron nods to Ramar. "No one else would tell me what happened either. They were too frightened themselves. Frightened of the glowing apparition that had appeared on the walls, skewered the first wave of attackers in a matter of seconds, crying out curses and imprecations I didn't even know I knew. All I knew is that no one dared to look at me, or talk to me. I heard the word 'demon' muttered under their breath, and for a time I believed it. I'd feared that some evil spirit had taken me in my moment of grief, and to protect my friends, that I'd have to leave."

"I wandered a while, alone, making my living off the land as best I could." Davron smiles. "At least hunting wasn't too difficult. I didn't starve. But I couldn't go on that way for long. Besides, I still had faint dreams of becoming a scholar, nearly forgotten though they were. So I followed the road to a smaller village, hoping my reputation hadn't preceded me. And as luck would have it, the Guild caravan was in town, and looking for fresh caravan guards." A faint chuckle. "They don't ask many questions, do they? 'Got yer own bow, have yer?' 'Yes, it's one of my-' 'Any good with it?' A quick archery test, and I was in."

"Indeed? A fellow wanderer... at the least for a time you were." Ramar's eyes have returned to a delighted state, an attentive state, though some hint of sadness still lurks just beneath their surface. "Tell us of your travels? Which lands did you travel to? The North? The South?"

Davron shakes his head at Ramar. "I'm not a wanderer by nature, and I didn't spend too long with that caravan. I already was looking for some way I could find someplace to settle, somewhere that I wouldn't be noticed. So I asked amongst the merchants until I found the bowyers. One of them was willing to take an apprentice, and he seemed impressed with my handiwork - enough, at least, to let me show him that I really could make a bow. His home was in this city, and when he left the caravan, I joined him here."

"I see. So you have lived here? When did you come to realize that it wasn't a demon that had taken you, but that you had been Chosen by the light of the Unconquered Sun?" Ramar shifts only slightly, stretching both arms in front of him, before bringing them back down to either side.

Davron says, "There's little enough else to tell, really. I settled into the groove I'd had back in Arzas - making bows and selling them. And one day my master told me that a strange man was asking about one of my bows." He nods toward the Master. "_He_ took one look at me, and told the master to leave us. When we were alone, he looked at one of my bows - one of my best works at the time. I stood there apprehensively as he examined it. Finally he laid it down with a snort of contempt. 'Rubbish. The Demon of Arzas can do much better than that.'"

Davron grins sheepishly. "Of course, when he called me by that name, I reacted with poise and wit. That is to say, I foolishly gibbered in shock and finally managed to sputter out, 'How did you know-?' And he responded, 'Follow and find out.' What could I do? I followed." He nods to Ramar. "Over time, the Master has taught me the truth of what I am - corrected my misapprehensions. And taught me other things as well. For starters, the fact that I _can_ do better... especially with the right materials." He chuckles to himself. "'You can't make a bow with gold!' I said. Boy, did I learn."
