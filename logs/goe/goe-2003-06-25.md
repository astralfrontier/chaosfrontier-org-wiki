# Gods of Eden 2003-06-25

A brief but productive interrogation of the captured bridge guardsman reveals the following facts (or at least opinions submitted as fact by this wretch): that the weather has been particularly horrible for a period of three months; that it was noted that the torrential downpour focused on Syllum before the Korad lands; and that prayers of late have gone either unanswered, or have resulted in particularly aggressive weather-related troubles for the communities which beseeched the spirits in their usual fashion. The man is feverish but still relatively sane, and his poor physical condition forbids further inquiries.

"Then it seems the choice now falls to us... where shall we sail? A small village along the river, or perhaps the capital itself? The dangers and boons present with either choice are readily apparent. We are likely to be noticed in a small village, yet we may not be as troubled there, nor are we bound to worry about the legal prospects of interfering. At least not presently. Should we sail to the Capital, we are less likely to be noticed, however, it seems to me that we might be a little out of sorts." Ramar holds his palms upwards, open to the sky. They tip back and forth, as though arms on a scale. "Perhaps if we bought clothes more customary to this locale...?"

Chi-Yosh's fingers lace atop his crossed legs. "Perhaps one of us should go into the village for clothing purchasings; at the very least, two. That way we do not all stand out, nor if even we are noticed, Syllum's capital would not be aware of all of us?"

"Then it's settled. we go into the village for clothing. I'll volunteer to be one of the two who go in. Anyone else care to join?" Ramar turns the boat about in the water, letting it tack into the wind. Or at least appear to do so. "There's a village not too far from here, if the map is accurate."

Marina smiles at Ramar. "I think perhaps I should go. My clothes do not stand out so much ... and I would not be ill dressed."

A smile is returned. "Indeed. Perhaps a less... noticeable guise is needed." Ramar undoes the ties on his dishsasha. He slips it up, revealing a simple, brown, long-sleeved shirt and loose trousers underneath. "So what shall we do with the prisoner?"

Davron says, "I'd say that we should leave him with a local surgeon just before we leave. I can't imagine we want to take him any further with us, but we can't just leave him out in the wilderness, either."

Chi-Yosh says, "He will likely not talk; his concern of his own crimes, and pride should keep him silenced on his own." He glances to Marina. "Would you like me to help Ramar carry him into the village?"

Smiling, Marina nods gracefully. "Certes. He is, after all, somewhat ... filthy. It would not suit, I think, for those villagers to be confused by the physical labour of a lady." She looks thoughtful. "I think, perhaps, I will be purchasing some clothes for my maid, who was most grievously wounded in the attack which this man was also victim to."

At the next village down the river, the _Seagull_ puts in, and the party hurries to shore together, evading the periodic rainfall which drenches every inch of this already too-fertile valley. Sometimes they will pass patches of grass, or flower beds and vegetable gardens, that show the customary signs of decay and death amidst the growing greenery. Under the shelter of wooden terraces, alcohol flows from stein to gullet as the locals talk of matters both conventional and spiritual. The endless rain is one topic, but by no means the only; and in this stream of half-slurred words, those with ears to hear listen for the accents and speech of the men of this valley. The surgeon is very receptive to the kindness of these friendly foreigners who found one of their own trusted guardsman wounded near to death, and she offers a steaming cup of chava to each before they depart. Clothes, too, are easy to acquire, and in these troubled times, the villagers are sympathetic to any story of pathos, no matter how durable it might be.

After changing into these simpler clothes, Marina carefully packs her favourite cloak in the storage area. Maidservants do not have low necklines, and the shirt's high throat covers her necklace quite handily. Thus attired, she looks around, admiring the sky ... She pauses. Or perhaps admire is not the right word.

"Davron ..." The name trails slowly "... at least we can be sure the spirits are present; their sign is everywhere in the skies. Perhaps if we could find the heaviest concentrations." Marina slowly turns around in a circle, looking up.

Putting on the more common clothes, Ramar is one to take note of the similarities. "Huh. Common, simple clothes seem to vary little from place to place." He looks about, "The heaviest concentrations? I suppose I could do so, if you'd like... if we have some time. It would take hours though."

Davron studies the sky himself, shielding his eyes from the pouring rain. "I'm not so sure, Marina... the spirits here may only know what they were sent to do, and little of the whys and wherefores. We may learn more at the capital, perhaps."

Ramar continues, "We have the necessary equipment, conducting a Geomantic Survey of the area should not be too terribly hard. Unless of course, it is more difficult due to the machinations of the spirits."

"Time is of the essence, but ..." She shrugs. "I don't know. I thought, perhaps, they would be most concentrated near the sites of summoning. But you're right; they've probably traveled far afield."

Chi-Yosh's clothes are rather common. However, his simply aren't matching of the local state of fashion. They are not too unodd for him. They are plain, unassuming. This he likes. Though, he does regard the sky. This... is unnatural, to say the least. With the rain wearing thin upon the oversaturated earth, it earns a firm shake of the head from him. The spirits are harming the world around them. Why? He has to consider that not all of said spirits may very much care what their influences do - if they are bayed to do so. Like some men, their payments, or the threats to them may stay or push their hands. If spirits have hands. But whoever, whatever is threatening those spirits, if the case may be... it must be strong. And if such is the case, perhaps it is best that the Solars themselves are at this task.

The location of the temple of the village is precisely measured. Three hundred stone steps cross from the threshold of the town's borders, running over the grassy lowland in a winding line to the steps of the stone building. The temple itself is round, with a simple dome over it. Stepping inside provides a respite from the drizzle, the pitter-patter of raindrops fading away and replaced by the guttering sound of lit torches.

An old man sits in the shadows, half-reclined on a bench of stone, apparently dozing but not yet fully asleep. To the barbarians north of this valley kingdom, he would be called a shaman; here, he is merely a scholar, one of the men who teaches the villagers the proper prayers and invocations to bring forth the bounty of the Unseen World on their crops and fields.

Ramar bows his head respectfully, giving the scholar a nod. He looks about slowly, approaching the stone bench. Each movement is carefully taken, measured so that he will not seem overtly threatening. "Greetings," he says, voice slipping readily into the local tongue.

Walking along the path, Marina eyes the man curiously, through downswept eyelashes. For now, she is not the usual haughty lady, merely a young lass, come to visit the temple. As she approaches, she turns a little to the side, and stops, courteously waiting for the old man to notice her.

"Bah," announces the elderly priest, crustily, cracking open one bleary eye to survey the newcomers. "Prayers won't avail you now, so don't even ask me! Though, if you give me your jade now.." His voice lowers, husky and resonant, ".. I'll pray for your poor miserable wretched souls anyway. What do you want?"

Chi-Yosh has the chain shirt on beneath his clothing. The kamas are not obvious on his person; hid beneath the simple cloak for the rainy weather. In one hand, a walking stick, something stout and weighted he had found on the skeleton of a dead tree on the walk up to the temple. Something unassuming. A traveler, or a sheperd into town. He is quiet, lingering on the edge of the conversation, while attempting to not be seen as with the others.

Holding out a single jade coin, Marina smiles. "Pray for us, then. A prayer never goes amiss." She tilts her head. "But first, will you tell of us of these prayers that fade?"

"Someone to pray for our poor miserable wretched souls," responds Ramar, with a grin spreading about his face. "I've seen evidence the prayers aren't working. I think everyone has. The reasons, some say, are obvious, but I'm not so sure myself. I may well be a fool... but tell us more of these prayers that don't work. More to the point, tell us why you think they don't work?"

The old man points up, wizened finger shaking as it rises skyward as though preparing to pierce the very stone of the dome above. "A war, up in the sky, between spirits," he wheezes. "And all because of Kor's children. They hate us, they do."

"Kor's children?" Marina sounds curious, encouraging him to continue.

Ramar's gaze drifts upwards momentarily. His eyebrows raise slightly, and he seems to be concerned, for a moment. "What sorts of spirits would war? Or perhaps the more important question, and you'll pardon me for being the fool for asking... but who is Kor?"

The old man cackles loudly and bitterly at this. "HA HA HA HA HA HA! Those of the Korad tribes, they that sprang of Kor's blood and came to the Riverlands here? They were barbarians, and they still are. Go look at \`em from the Bridge once in awhile, or climb the mountain steps to the Shrine of Sangre, and peer upland.. Just before night, when it's twilight out, and the forest creatures start to sing their songs, you can see the eyes of those Wyld-spawned freaks peering out from their trees, all aglitter to sweep down and invade us. It was them that called down the storm-spirits on our land! They want to drown us out, that's what they want!"

The elderly gentleman is almost shouting now, caught up in his rant. "So our good Minister Wulfham, it must have been him that sent the spirits back upon them! And no fate are they more deserving of!"

"So the children of Kor rain troubles upon this land because they want its bounty for their own," Davron says, as if he agrees with the old priest. He sighs, rubbing his chin. "Always the same old stories... greed and lust for power..."

"Really? The Shrine of Sangre? And how would we know when Shangre's Shrine was reached, let along who Shangre is in the first place? Perhaps...spoof "Really? The Shrine of Sangre? And how would we know when Shangre's Shrine was reached, let alone who Shangre is in the first place? Perhaps... perhaps it is indeed in order. I think we may find more there than we would looking about elsewhere. Why do Kor's children hate you so? Is it simply the land that they seek? Is it some ancient slight? Or is it a new story... one not heard by many before?" asks Ramar, while glancing skyward. "Perhaps, there is more of the story to be told? Do you think Kor's children suffer from the same troubles that you suffer from, or is their mastery of the spirits of the Forest and Sky so great that you are not a match for theirs?"

The old priest merely shrugs. "The Shrine is up the mountains from the capital. As for what these barbarians want..." He spreads his hands helplessly. "They are mad savages. Who's to say? We've not fought with them for fifty years."

Ramar then asks, "When did the troubles start?"

"Oh, must have been three months ago," muses the priest, "in the month of Descending Water. The Korad highlands began suffering a few days after we did." He chortles gleefully. "Wulfham is a crafty fellow. Wouldn't take him long to hit upon the secret, no!"

Chi-Yosh has been quietly watching. When the old man starts ranting, it would be natural for someone to pay attention. Though, he has wandered in, closer by the minute, along the side. A casual lean is taken on the walking stick. After a moment, his eyes draw upwards to the dome that shields them from the tears of the clouds. A thought bubbles up in his brain at the admittance of the old priest. Hm.

"Oh? Who is Wulfham, and what secret is it that this crafty fellow has hit upon?" Ramar's voice is curious now, although there's a soft chuckle accenting some of his words. "Sounds like quite the fellow. So the troubles started three months ago... and you've not drowned out yet... what do you suppose keeps you from doing so?"

"Wulfham? One of the leading Ministers to the King, Long May He Reign," replies the priest, in a tone of awe. Some personal respect for the man seems indicated in this oldster.

The young bowyer paces around the temple, rubbing his head in thought. "Minister Wulfham surely knows the ways of the spirits well, then, if he spotted their invasion from Korad so quickly. And he's a power among men as well?" Davron then glances at the old priest, with a smile. "Have you met the man yourself, then?"

The old man bobs his head quickly. "He pronounced the blessing on both my sons," he proclaims proudly. "A great man."

"Indeed. One of the Ministers... sounds like you and he have met before. What secret do you suppose it was he figured out before the rest?" Ramar tilts his head a bit, "And what do you suppose he can do to help solve all your troubles?"

"You truly are an outlander, aren't you," snorts the priest. "Minister Wulfham is the guardian of the spirit world in Syllum. He announces the feast-days and the rites; he is one of the keepers of the mysteries."

"But one who hopes to learn a little more, so as not to seem so much of a fool. He is a keeper of the mysteries. Who else is one of these keepers?" Ramar watches the oldster with interest. _This is an interesting tale after all. Even if I end up looking the fool for asking... it is still worth it to not remain a fool for not having asked in the first place._

Davron chuckles softly at the priest's remark about outlanders. "Was it that obvious?" he says, glancing briefly at Ramar with perhaps the slightest hint of impatience.

The elder priest ticks off on wrinkled fingers. "Minister Magan is the astrologer and soothsayer; he surveys the heavens, praying for the guidance of the Five Dragons and the spirits below them. Minister Wulfham sees to it that the dead remain untroubled; that the spirits are appeased, and that they do not wreak their vengeance upon us for unfaithful prayers or offerings."

After his relative silence, Chi-Yosh steps forward to the old timer, head canted to the side. "Good sir, has anyone attempted to make peace with the... Barbarians?" The last word is a little troubled on his tongue, but he achieves it well enough.

"Minister Magan and Minister Wulfham." Ramar nods, taking mental note of the functions of these to figures. He remains silent for a moment, letting the old timer continue his speech, and when Chi-Yosh asks, he decides... _This too is an answer well worth hearing..._

"Bah! There'll be no peace, now that they've called down the spirits upon Syllum," spits the old man, again scornful and derisive. "Better that we pray for lantern oil to fall on their trees than rain, that we could put them to the torch."

"You wish more on them than they bring on you?" Davron says, perhaps a little sharper than he normally would. "Why is that? Granted that they've sent these unseasonable rains upon you, but what _else_ have they done to merit your ire?"

"He makes a good point... how can you be so sure that these rains are intentional? Perhaps they slipped up in their attempts to appease the spirits in asking for an abatement to a drought... and now..." Ramar shrugs, "Then again, that is an outlandish possibility. It is still one to consider."

"Is that not enough?" demands the priest, bodily rising (and trembling a bit). He takes a step forward, pointing his accusing finger outside, to the north. "We are farmers, planters, people of the land! It could be nothing but aggression, and we must respond in kind!"

Chi-Yosh's lips purse at that. "Forgive all these questions, good temple man." After a moment, "Would the people of Syllum hold any benefit from conflict, or destruction with the blood of Kor?"

The priest's fury abates for a moment, and he blinks uncomprehendingly at this question. ".. The rains would abate, the spirits would again be appeased, and we would be free to live again. Isn't that the right of any man?"

"Certainly, sir," Chi-Yosh assures, a nod. "And so it should be. If the Korads were driven off for good, to bare their lands and absence to the Syllumites, would anything good come of it, besides the peaceful skies?"

"As it should be. What should happen if the Korads stop their torrents? Or are beaten back? Would they be left at peace?" Ramar then ponders, "And aside from the barbarians themselves... who would know more of Kor?"

"You can learn what is known in the library," says the priest dismissively, as though insulted that the history of such people would be of interest.

"And is this the same place we could learn more of the history of your illustrious kingdom?" Ramar then ponders, "What's your take on all of this? What would be the best solution in your opinion...?"

Davron sighs quietly. "Peace... the freedom to live as one would. It is good to hear that the people of Syllum seek only to be unmolested. Would that the people of Kor would show such wisdom," he says, striving to keep the sarcasm from his voice as he bows to the old man. "We thank you for your time, good sir."

Ramar starts to say something... but decides against it. He bows, and offers the old man thanks. "May you find more wretched souls to pray for." He nods to Marina, as she's the one offering the coins. He then turns and heads back for the _Seagull_. "Where to now?"

Marina offers the man a second coin. "Pray for us, sir, and we'll not waste your breath."

Chi-Yosh simply bows to the man, but shows him no smile. "May your prayers go answered." He then exits a second door, and circles around to meet the others.

The _Seagull_ responds well under Ramar's guidance. It's almost as though he's seeing through the ship's eyes. The keel drifts effortlessly through the water, guided from current to current, tacking with the wind. "Mind the rig..." warns Ramar, as they execute a banking turn in the water. "Mind the rocks as well... where shall I set us down? Outside of the capital, or in her harbor?"

"Outside, of course, and we'll sail in. We are planning to be discreet, after all - or had you forgotten?" Davron says, sighing. "I just hope we learned enough back there so we don't seem like outlanders in the capital as well."

Chi-Yosh is peering down into the greyscale water, in consideration now for the moment. Then he speaks up. "I had the thought. Could it be, this Wulfham asked the spirits to rain down upon Syllum first? If there is something that could be of use to the Syllum people in the Korad's lands..."

The solemn stonework of this nation is not without its softer side; for even the common villages nestled into the prodigious valley were both sturdy with stone and packed earth, and lush with vegetation and flowers. The capital city of Syllum, and indeed the fortress which serves as its seat of government and last bastion of defense, bear all the marks of this peculiar blending of resilience and vitality. Trees are everywhere, even lining the streets and nestled in well-tended soil; flowers can be seen adorning every window, growing from ceramic window-boxes built into the architecture.

Marina smiles wryly. "Certes. For does the victim not have the right to respond?" She looks grim, for a moment. "I will have to ... inquire, Chi-Yosh."

The four figures, draped in their heavy and water-resistant cloaks, tread over the damp cobblestones of the city-fortress of Syllum. Their boots insulate the wetness, but the lingering cold seeps through it, gnawing its way through flesh and into bone. They pass a house near the main thoroughfare, whose front face is dominated by a closed and shuttered window. In a box running the length of the window frame, an artist's palette of colors adorns the drooping flowers sitting in their drenched soil. Raindrops sit perched on the petal of the largest blossom in the box, preparing to roll away like tears.

Upon attaining the area of the citadel, the party makes its separate ways, agreeing to regroup at a two-story drinking-house and restaurant from which emanates a fine toothsome smell, even in the depressing downpour.

Looking around, Marina smiles, and fingers the fancier clothes she carries in a bag. "I think, Davron, that you will find me in one of the richer taverns, where the young nobles congregate. They often speak much, bragging to cover their lack of power. It's a good place to listen." She looks around. "And it will be drier, too. Perhaps, by morning, we shall have an entree into power itself?"

"The only ones who may be willing to tell us the truth, in this matter, are the spirits themselves." Ramar's voice seems cheery, even in all of this water. He looks about, "Ah, a drinking house. Lovely place that. I daresay that smell is... disgusting. Where will you be headed off? I suppose I can inquite about the harbor, or perhaps seek out places where they are bound to know of spirits. A temple or the like."

Davron wipes away the rain streaming down his brow, a fairly fruitless effort as the downpour continues to soak him. He nods to Marina, smiling. "And I shall go to the library and see what Syllum has to tell of the history of Kor. Perhaps they'll even have some information on what Syllum has to gain from the Korad lands." He grins a cynical grin. "Though no doubt they'll couch it in terms of Syllum's just birthright which the children of Kor usurped from them."

Chi-Yosh walks among the village. Despite the relative gloom and ungliness of the rain in this city, he can see the beauty that would be here in the twilight of the evenings, the glimmer of sunshine. Flowers, trees; this barred place does indeed give to the beauty found outside of their stone walls. Nane could learn a thing or two. A glance to Davron. "I will go with you. And follow on the thought of the Korad; we will go there, after venturing from here. It would be wise someone goes to learn the customs and ways of the Blood of Kor; I am hopeful that the library will have such teachings. I do not expect it, though."

---

The Walker of Boughs and Branches accompanies Davron to the Syllum Library, and both men shed their rain-soaked cloaks at the door, hanging them on pegs over a drain. Apparently the need for this measure has been known for some time. Directed reading is in order. The books here span the continuum of age, though no truly ancient tomes can be found (or at least, none that are accessible to the public), and from several selected volumes, a clear picture can be seen.

This valley was settled scant centuries ago, as is common in the Hundred Kingdoms. Perhaps three hundred years have come and gone since the fortress was erected here, secure between two ranges of mountains and able to levy a tax on whatever water commerce might flow toward the Yanaze River. Of course, that was long ago. Dreams of taxed riches faded with the continual warfare in the region and the lack of goods coming southward, and today the valley kingdom is insular and agricultural.

Histories speak of sporadic wars with Syllum's northern and southern neighbors; the coming of the barbarian tribes predates Syllum's founding, though periodic border brush-wars and flare-ups of half-buried tension marked the first two centuries of the kingdom's existence. The spirit-worshipping primitives are now left alone for the most part, unmarked in any text more recent than the last several months. No obvious spark for this fuse can be found.

Of the Korad lands themselves, much is written but little is substantiated. It is said that they came from the east, though there is no mention of how far they travelled. The tribes settled in these lands under the guidance of Kor, the legendary Last Leader who swore eternal pacts of friendship between the differing clans. Upon settling into their new abode, the tribes resumed their accustomed lifestyles over time, and by the time of Kor's death, they had returned to their original state.

Although semi-civilized, the Korad Tribes are a fractious lot, ever competing with each other. They avoid outright internecine warfare for the most part, wary of the Spirit Tracks which criss-cross their land and have done so, it is said, for millennia. They are not particularly warlike; their conflicts are described primarily as a sort of competition amongst themselves, wars in which outsiders are not merely unwelcome, but attacked in a body by all the tribes concerned.

As to the matter of communicating with or understanding the children of Kor, little is known. Each tribe has its own customs; what may welcome you to the feast-gathering of one tribe may lead to your painful and prolonged execution some twenty miles away in the forest.

The reason for their divisiveness, and the constant conflicts, both bloody and peaceful, seem to revolve around their religious beliefs. A man killed in an intertribal war is accorded a special place in the afterlife; a man who suffers great humiliation or dishonor, and yet lives, must make his peace before he himself is killed, or his soul will go on to serve as a slave to his tormentor.

On the way out of the library, Chi-Yosh and Davron are both rubbing their eyes. The rain continues to fall, and in the distance a stroke of thunder resounds majestically off the mountaintops that frame this valley. Chi-Yosh's eyes are drawn by a sudden and surprising eruption lightning, which seems to strike viciously against one of the steel pillars rising from the fortress's foundations, whereon the kingdom's pennant flies. He looks left, noting an odd sight - a sheltered cluster of flower-boxes, covered with care to keep the rain out, and the numerous white blossoms that crowd into each box.

What makes this otherwise-commonplace spectacle unusual, Chi-Yosh isn't yet sure of. But he feels something is special, or unusual. Davron, on the other hand, is quite preoccupied, for with the furious divine bolt of lightning, a wailing sound keened through his very ears, a spiritual song making itself known against every nerve in his body with all the gentleness of a red-hot firebrand. The unmistakeable sensation of Essence, but hot and angry Essence, and in concentrations not normally found outside a Manse.

---

The inquiries of the explorer at the docks, and elsewhere, bear fruit; Ramar learns much of the business of Syllum. Trade, of course, has been depressed since the days the incessant bad weather started; such is natural. The Guild still comes, since nothing short of outright war would stop its caravans from moving, and even war is used by the Guild to its advantage. Beyond that, the nature of government in the kingdom is made clear. Thirteen knowledgeable and reliable ministers serve the King, and their posts and even names are handed down from their predecessors.

Wulfham is but one of several; he deals with spirits, death and the dead primarily. Other men have other roles, such as Minister Eidlar, who deals with relations with other lands and kingdoms. In this connection, Ramar learns that little to no trade occurs with the Korad Tribes; most of their food is locally grown, or purchased from the surrounding independent farming villages. None of the sailors here see any commercial advantage in the Korad Tribes or their forest lands, except perhaps the plentiful trees.

The kingdom, and its people, pay scant tribute to the machinations and wishes of a far-off Blessed Realm. They provide periodic gifts, as the Realm wishes, but no Realm soldier, no Dragon-Blooded, no representative of the Thousand Scales, can be found in Syllum. Such things are best left as stories of distant lands, say these simple and humble river-folk.

The traveller takes his amicable leave of these stout, reliable men, moving somewhat out of the city's radius for the next phase of his investigations. Secure under the stone roof of an empty temple, he begins the ritualized and intricate cadences, the sacred acts older than mankind itself, that attune the celebrant of these rites to the unseen world beyond.

What the man learns, as he emerges shaky and sweating from the ritual hours later, is informative, but not particularly conclusive. The natural lines of Essence gather at the mountain peaks, shunning the peaceful valley floor, and converge to the north, where the Korad lands are. Demesnes, both uncapped and covered by Manses, might be found in the region, but primarily they will be in the mountains. The regular line of holy sites and other regions of mystic import, accessible to the hardy traveller who ascends those peaks, and hinted at by the men at the docks, seems to suggest that this occult lore is or was known to the people of these lands.

Likewise, the identity of the spirits behind the freakish weather is confirmed - spirits of storm and air have been roused from their traditional playful moods into wrathful apparitions hungry to bring down the very sky on the heads of those below. Nothing clearer, either in motive or in source, can be ascertained. Like any war, the clashes in the unseen world overhead are chaotic, ever-changing and impossible to view clearly from outside.

Marina moves as her position, prowess and personality dictate - among people, but never precisely with them. Feigning ignorance at one moment, insolent dismissal the next, she swims like a shark through the sea of society. It took her little time to establish ties to those in power, for her eyes see such men and women like a watcher sees a signal-flare in the twilight.

In the time allotted, the woman moves through what circles she can gain access to, ever discreet in her questioning. This man, that minister, the King, the Korad. Roughly a third of those who hold station express to her, by words or not, their favorable approval of the current situation - namely, that the primitive tribes to the north are necessitating their own extirpation bit by bit. This movement is small but influential; adding land to Syllum would only make it stronger, after all.

The government of Syllum is a monarchy, and this valley with its considerable agricultural potential was wrested from bandits and thieves (so the local history says) by Syldun the Warrior of Roses, and Malseyn the Speaker to Dragons. This man and woman founded a dynasty whose curious custom of monarchy survives to this day: it is the heir of the house of Syldun who ascends the throne one generation, and the heir of Malseyn who ascends it the next. This duality has filtered its way deep into the political psyche of the kingdom. The current ruler is Syldunsen VIII.

Aside from the king, there are thirteen ministers, addressed by that title, who inherit their names and functions from their predecessors. The king chooses his own ministers, it is said, and though the exact process of selection is not known to the common people it is hinted by the more aristocratic of Marina's informants that extremely competitive bidding occurs among the peerage of academics, when a minister must be replaced.

The ministers are Cambirg (agriculture), Chirog (medicine), Eadal (taxation), Eidlar (external politics), Eidowin (the arts), Eldain (knowledge), Eldwyne (justice), Kynbirg (war), Magan (astrology), Raedan (coordinator of the council of ministers), Reming (industry), Virgam (civil works) and Wulfham (the spirit world). Speakers seem not to hold individual views of any given minister; those in a particular field will venerate the minister who has authority over it. For example, most of the academics spoken to show favor to Minister Eldain.

Though none of the Ministers themselves, to say nothing of the King, can be met in such a short span, the foundation is slowly but surely laid to permit the possibility of a future audience; and Marina leaves, contentedly.
