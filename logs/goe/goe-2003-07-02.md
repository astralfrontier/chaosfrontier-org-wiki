# Gods of Eden 2003-07-02

The lightning strike, and the box of flowers near to the pennant-pole that was struck, are on the third and topmost visible floor of the kingdom's citadel. This stone fortress is merely sullen in the sun, but in this seemingly-unceasing rain it broods uneasily, glaring down at the two men as brief flashes of lightning continue to illuminate the sky. Resolving to investigate it later, the two men work their way back to the expansive restaurant in which their companions wait.

The first floor of the establishment is covered thickly by the crowd of citizens refreshing themselves with a variety of warmed drinks. On the second floor, in one of the several secluded booths that line the wall, the four Solars gather, relating to each other one by one the information their respective investigations gleaned.

Looking at the others, Marina smiles wryly. "There is too much ... pleasure in the excuse offered by the barbarians for their extinction."

Davron nods in agreement, staring into space contemplatively. "Indeed. And from what we could tell of the barbarians' history, they're an insular people. Why would they be so eager to overthrow Syllum? We haven't heard that Syllum offered them any unusual threat recently. Unless, of course, Syllum doesn't _know_ why they've offended Korad..."

Ramar ponders Marina. "You mean to say that the reasons that are given for the barbarian's attacks on the town are given with too much pleasure? Or that the barbarians take plasure in the extinction of these folks? Or vice versa? I believe that there is at least one valid point in there."

Marina looks at Ramar. "What I mean is simple enough. If the barbarians attack, then in self defense the kingdom must defeat them. Too many of the townspeople enjoy the idea of adding the new lands to the kingdom. Thus, if the barbarians are truly behind this, then they are creating the cause for their own demise."

Chi-Yosh nods. "Yes." It would almost help his earlier thought. "The Ministers are our key. Wulfham more then the rest. His helpers, and the king would be good to discuss this over... The king wears the mantle, but his words carry no weight. There could be bitter sap in him, for that."

"Seems a little too convenient, doesn't it?" Davron says to Marina. "I agree... we have to consider the possibility that Syllum's engineered this war for their own benefit. Though... perhaps not all of Syllum, or even all of the ministers. Perhaps this is the ambitions of a few."

Marina nods. "Much too convenient. And it only takes one ..." She sighs. "Wulfham would be a good target, I think. He should know more."

Ramar nods, "This is true. They do enjoy the idea of adding new lands. Or rather they profess to enjoy it. This may well be the case. However, I think that if such things have resulted in this... situation in which neither side is clearly winning, that they would realize it was foolish to continue it. Then again, they may be trapped. I can make a few guesses, though I can say nothing for certain until we know all sides of the story. There is the very real possibility that we are being told the truth, and the Korad really have made this attack there own. It may be that something else is driving them to attack? Although, for brevity's sake, I agree, that currently it does seem like Sullym has a good reason to start a war. Then again, so do many other nations..."

Davron leans forward onto the table, resting his chin in his hand. "Wulfham would know most, in any case. As the man responsible for Syllum's dealings with the spirit world, he must surely be the man most involved in the workings of this war. Even if Korad is the aggressor, Wulfham would know the most about their attack, and about Syllum's response to it. Why has Syllum focused on a counterattack, for example, rather than trying to calm the spirits attacking them... or perhaps they _are_ trying, and meeting with little success."

Chi-Yosh considers more. "I could be guessing, but the Minister of War may know things, if not all the Ministers do. It is his area of expertise; I have a hard time imagining he as a blind man in this." He listens to Davron, and crinkles his brow. "Is it possible that the spirits are continuing after both sides merely urged them? And the two places are in the wake of the tempest of the Spirits' war?"

Ramar nods to Chi-Yosh. "This is a possiblity that could well be the case. For instance, if the spirits were out of control, and neither of the ones responsible could bring them back into control... why admit failure when you can simply claim that it is what is meant? Perhaps the spirits are influencing the Ministers..."

Ramar says, "It is still too early for me to come to any thorough conclusion."

Marina nods. "Yes, more information would be good."

Davron sits up again. "I for one would like to know how ambitious Wulfham is reputed to be. Does he seem content within the current scope of his position, or does he plot to expand his role? Or perhaps he is not merely greedy for personal power, but shows a desire to improve the lot of Syllum as a whole?"

Marina smiles slowly. "I do believe, Davron, that that's my cue. I've been wondering if I can reach the court, in any case ..." She strokes her cloak, smiling. "Perhaps meet a few new friends."

Chi-Yosh glances to Davron. "His position may have become much more important and more eyes on him, in the wake of this situation."

Ramar offers a wry smile. "That, indeed, is your cue, Marina." He settles back now, gazing about the room slowly. "Hmmm. I have no doubt you shall be able to arrange a meeting... although I wonder what the rest of us will find ourselves doing while you take care of arranging this?"

Marina tilts her head. "Are you suggesting you will be at that meeting, Ramar?"

Ramar raises an eyebrow, "It may be important for all of us to be at that meeting, Marina, however, it might be utterly futile. No, I am not suggesting that... why do you ask?"

Davron chuckles softly. "I for one am suggesting that I will not. I may have a way with words on a page, but alas I am not so adept at words spoken to people - at least not to potentially unfriendly listeners." He taps his chin. "So Ramar's question still stands - how should I occupy myself until then?"

Chi-Yosh considers the question for a time, on his own behalf, turning attention more to Marina. "How long will it take, do you think, to set the audiance and recieve it?"

Marina looks at Chi-Yosh. "A few days. Longer, if I must explain the presence of others in a speaking role."

Chi-Yosh says, "I do not think any of us will be present and speaking. This is your arena."

Davron rubs his chin. "We were advised, when we first landed here, to climb the mountain steps to the Shrine of Sangre, that we might see the hostility of the Korad for ourselves. Perhaps I should take the old priest up on that..."

Ramar nods, "As I said. It may be important, but in the end, utterly futile. You should be able to handle things quite deftly, I suspect. Which still leaves us to ponder, what shall we do for the next few days? The Shrine seems the place to go... and I know I'd like to examine a few of the places that the Spirits were originally reported to have attacked from, or at."

Davron raises his head. "Chi-Yosh and I witnessed one of the spirits' attacks on the fortress. We can show you the spot, if you like."

"The shrine does seem to be the place to go. Otherwise, I am sure I can find something to do with for help." Chi-Yosh nods to Davron.

With her most familiar occupation as sword and shield, Marina prepares to do battle with the bureaucracy. Honey-glazed words of faithful service and promises of a return to the quiet days of learning that the academics of this kingdom so strongly favor are her thrust and parry. With past experience firmly in mind she avoids those men who seemed most favorable to a hostile expansion northward, but even so, the woman can see as she speaks the shrewd narrowing of a handful of eyes, and sense the intent of the hearts of them who politely wish her well.

Minister Cambirg, master of agriculture, farming and all things that sustain life in the valley, is of course ready to receive the emissary of those of the independent farmlands that stretch between Syllum and Korad, lining the river and the Guild Road. Their complaints are familiar to his ears, as Marina senses when she purports to brings their case to him in his office the next day.

Like his fellows, Cambirg is a man of many summers, but not yet infirm. Still, his face is wrinkled before its time with evident signs of stress, and the man carries a handkerchief in one pocket of his official robes of gray. His hair is thinning enough for his scalp to glisten with sweat, which he wipes away from time to time as a habitual gesture of anxiety. Marina's fictitious case has been made, and the man seems entirely sympathetic.

Marina smiles, inviting comment from Cambirg, as she closes her explanation with a simple "So you see, sir, I am acting on the many rumours, and hoping to do you a service, while servicing my own pouch too."

The Minister nods and smiles thinly, mopping at his brow with the cloth. "Of course, of course..." He considers for a moment. "This has been... a most trying and difficult time. Of course the Korad peoples have made no formal offer, as we are used to it, but I understand they are a simple people, not knowing our ways, as we know not theirs.. We would send an envoy, but there is dissent in the council of ministers as to how to proceed..." He trails off, radiating evident and genuine disappointment.

Her spine straightening just the slightest half inch, Marina nods slowly. "THere is ... dissent?" Her head is tilted, inviting furtHer confidences ...

"Haha, there always is," Cambirg adds with a weak laugh, as though it were the veriest trifle. His mood is still as damp as the rain outside, though, as he quiets down. This, to his guest, is the sign of a topic of no wide discussion, and Cambirg answers the demands of the silence by rising from his seat and moving through his study to a cabinet, which he opens and extracts bottled spirits from. "Perhaps something.... my nerves..." He mutters, more to himself, and pours out. "May I interest you..?"

Marina nods, accepting a glass, and sipping slowly. "Certainly. A small libation always speeds the conversation." She radiates the very essence of helpfulness though. "Perhaps, sir ... I know this is forward of me, but could I go as your envoy? Surely, I speak for no individual camp?" She sips again, slowly biting her lip for a moment. "Or perhaps ... Who would send the envoy, sir, and who would not? For it seems to me that if an envoy has not been sent yet, this would surely be the first step towards ameliorating this disaster; a step that famers throughout the valley will welcome, not merely the ones for whom I plead."

Cambirg brightens considerably at this news. "Oh? You...? Well, there is perhaps one way to entrust the kingdom's safety in you... Will you appear before the king and council in two days?" He drains his glass to the very dregs, hand shaking as it falls away from his lips. "Young lady, I shall warn you; perfidy will cost you your life, so think carefully before accepting this. I shall.. speak to the council. This may be what is needed..." He smiles again, wiping clean his brow once again with the ever-present cloth.

Marina nods slowly. "I offer no perfidy, sir. I wish merely to break this stalemate, before the last of the crops are ruined. I will gladly appear before the council. But I fear I do not know the king, nor the council members. That, in itself is why I can offer neutrality." She pauses for a moment, apparently collecting her thoughts. "Will you tell me of the king and council?"

Cambirg outlines briefly the members of the council, a series of facts Marina is already master of. Of course, as he speaks, the ambient Essence coursing through the anima of his guest is whispering its own secrets in her ears. Of those he speaks of, five names carry the most weight, accounting for virtually half of the man's present anxiety: Chirog, Eidlar, Eldwyne, Magan and Wulfham. The nature of this distress is not made clear, but the extent of it is clear. A truthful man is Cambirg, since it becomes known that what he would rather not speak of, he remains silent about.

Marina nods, slowly. "Thank you, Cambirg. That will aid me much." She leans forward, smiling trustingly. "Should I, do you think, speak with some of the other ministers beforehand? Would they wish to come to know me?"

"Oh, yes, of course..." The man moves to his desk, spreading out paper and writing deftly, his nervous twitches gone for the moment as years of writing steady his motions. "This," he explains, presenting the paper after a moment, "will grant you an audience with the ministers.. " 'I hope' is unstated, but obvious from his mood. Right now, this man is not entirely certain that his name will be a reliable pass-word to open the doors of his fellows, though again, the reason why is not known.

Accepting the paper, Marina offers the minister a low bow. "Thank you again, sir, for your time. I hope we will all benefit."

---

"This is madness!" is Minister Eidlar's first response, upon being presented in person with his colleague's scroll, and hearing the proposed plan. "You, an outsider, would carry our message to those... those... BARBARIANS? It's entirely insane! You'd be throwing your life away." He throws the paper down on his desk and turns, facing the far wall with a grimace. Nevertheless, Marina's ear discerns the whispered words that hide behind the man's spoken outrage. He's not particularly concerned about hiding something, only fearful that such a course of action would be a useless gesture.

Treading carefully, and cautiously, listening with her inner ear, Marina tries to reason with Eidlar. "I know there are risks, sir, and better that a foreigner die than one of your own. But I ask you to consider, sir, that I travel with a small bodyguard, who will see the messages returned, should I die. I ask you to consider the farmers who face famine, and worse, should the rains not let up. Perhaps the gesture will be useless. But perhaps, sir, it won't." she pauses, hoping that he will react.

Sighing, Eidlar runs both his hands through the salt-and-pepper hair atop his head in a gesture of mute frustration. "Very well, if you wish to come before the council on this matter, I will not oppose it. You will be tested, of course...." He shrugs, and turns, with a hard, thin smile on his face. "Perhaps you are what we have been praying for after all, if you speak truly."

Smiling, she bows her head. "Perhaps I will be, sir. Perhaps I will." Marina pauses, then grins briefly. "And if I succeed, sir, I promise my fee will be entirely reasonable." _After all, if I save your entire country from famine, a little gratitude will surely accompany a fat pouch of coins ..._

Ascending the mountains is a job of hours, but thankfully not many of them. Well-worn trails for this purpose are carved into the slopes of the guardian stone, and here and there the trio of men greet fellow-pilgrims, going either up or down. Almost all of them are dressed in the tradition of Syllum, wearing either the distinctively colored robes of public office or more commonly the billowing pants, high boots and multilayered shirt of the populace. All, however, are dressed for the weather, and a few prayers are spoken here and there in the hour or so during the climb that the rain ceases.

The Shrine of Sangre is the most prominent of the few holy places that top the mountains, and the path to it is marked and named. Visitors are expected to offer a pinch of salt to the dust of the path as they pass, and the three Solars came prepared and forewarned. Each ritually dispenses his salt as he steps onto the path, which crawls ever higher up the mountains, and each pinch is carried away dutifully by the strong winds that blow here. At this altitude the weather is less troublesome, and even with rain in the valley, the pilgrims at the mountaintop shrines are comparatively dry.

The Shrine itself is a stone tower, whose apex can be reached only by an arduous climb up rough-hewn and steeply slanted steps into the very side of the tower itself. One man at a time may pass, and the three travellers make their way up. The tower's topmost deck is ten yards in diameter, and at the four corners are drawn ritual circles. Noting the brief explanation at the base of the tower, Davron steps forward experimentally into the northern circle, and is rewarded by a sight remarkable indeed.

The scholar's vision sharpens, becoming preternaturally keen, and able to grasp even the most distant objects in his field of vision. With the eyes of an eagle, it seems, he looks north over the landscape, watching mountains almost fly past as his perspective shifts. He can see into the northern forests of the Korad foothills themselves; the power of his vision to reach into the distance stops at last when he finds he's able to identify the distinctive features of an individual tree, growing at the very edge of the barbarian homelands that must be dozens of miles distant from where he now stands.

Chi-Yosh treks up the mountain with his companions. It is good that the weather has lessened here; less soaking through to the very bone. If the citizens do not die of famine, they may die of sickness from the steady rainfall. The ritual of salt earns his interest, but he doubts his friends may offer explination for the odd regional custom. The tower itself is a trek that is made careful; the stones are slick. He reaches the top of the tower last, having taken the back incase Davron slipped. The view from above is reasonably grand, but slightly more gloomy. Though he does regard the circles on the ground with interest, the Su'Katan has yet to step into one. Observation from a distance, and all that.

Davron's eyes widen at the sight. "The old priest was right, after all..." he whispers to himself. "I wonder who first crafted this circle, how long ago..." He settles himself to the ground, studying the Korad forests contemplatively... though if he does not soon see anything of note, he'll turn his scholar's curiosity to the circle itself.

The vision provided by this place proves to be limited in scope, for Davron's eyes cannot wander far to the left or right before he finds himself again with un-augmented sight.

A journey of hours, and not a one of them lost to the wanderer among the group. Ramar's gaze is constantly drawn towards the scenery as they pass by, which elicis a revered sort of whisper from him, even as they pass through the rain. He continues up along the mountain, looking relieved to be out of the worst of the rain. Though his clothing, the common boots and pants one can find anywhere, with a simple shirt tucked into them, are soaked, his spirit seems undampened. It may be the only dry thing. Ramar smiles softly, leaving the salt to the winds, though he does ask after the reasons behind such a ritual. He looks about, regarding the circles with a similar degree of interest, though he's not going to step into anything until told it is safe. He searches about the shrine for a sage, or a priest of some sort.

The circle itself is little more than an occult diagram, discovers Davron, whose purpose is to call upon the powers of the spirit for whom this Shrine was erected. His reading suggests the title "Eagle of Golden Feathers" may also refer to the spirit.

Ramar's thoughts then turn elsewhere, when no priests can be found. "Hmmm." _If there are no priests here, then none must be needed. The spirits care for this place, in some form or another, that much is certain. The pilgrims and travellers may know more of this than we do, though it is likely they are simply visiting this place for the first time themselves._ The Solar searches about for a moment, seeking someone that he might ask, "Who tends to this place, and what are the meanings behind the four Circles?"

Davron hears the question, and joins Ramar's side. He's learned something of the meaning of the place himself, but he's intrigued to hear what words are given to its purpose by the pilgrims.

One of the passers-by, who is quietly reciting a prayer, takes the time to answer Ramar's question. She is an old woman, who smiles gently as he approaches. "... The circles? Given to us by the Eagle of Golden Feathers, Sangre, in the elder time, when Syldun and Malseyn made this land their home. Great heroes, they were, and in everything the spirits were their allies. This place, for example, was the watchtower of Syllum, to guard the kingdom from invasion..."

Chi-Yosh sidles beside Davron, and regards him with interest, casting a glance from him to the circle. "What does it do?" He questions, while Ramar may earn his answer.

"I think you for sharing your wisdom with me..." Ramar bows his head then, a similar, gentle smile about his face. "I wonder if you have the time to teach a little more to a traveler..." He looks up, "In all honesty, I know little about what happened to Syldun and Malseyn, or who they were, aside from what you've told me... would you care to tell more?" _It seems that no matter the culture, no matter the lands, in any setting, everything is communicated, and told, and relived even, at times, through stories. Intriguing._

After a moment's breath, Ramar continues. "And I realize I may be interrupting you, so if there is an offense I have commited I should like to apologize for it. If, however, you have no qualms about informing me... and I am not disturbing you overmuch, I'd like to know about the other spirits that were said to have been their allies. I'd like to know about the circles gifted to the shrine, I'd like to know about what other gifts they were left... or if there is another place I might make a pilgrimage to?"

The man learns more from this ancient and knowledgeable pilgrim, who speaks in her soft and kindly voice as she relates the tales of her homeland's history. The children of Kor were already present, it seems, when the two heroes arrived and made this fertile valley their home. At first relations were cordial, since Syldun and Malseyn were friends to all the spirits of Creation, and the men of the wooded highlands were wise and old in the ways of the unseen. As the heroes aged and died, and the children of their houses led the children of their followers, connections between the valley farmers and the foothills primitives grew cooler.

In the fullness of time, all men become complacent when they are content - when their house is warm in winter and cool in summer, when food is on the table and the children play and gambol, men do not think of the places and people that secured them these comforts. For a hero, the friendship of the spirits is necessary; for a farmer, the occasional prayer for good weather and luck is sufficient. The bond of spirit-friendship no longer mattered so desperately to those who descended from the achievements of Syldun and Malseyn; so too, the friendship which the Korad had extended waned gradually, as the people left behind the occult connections which their forefathers had depended on for their very lives.

Davron listens to the story in rapt fascination. A question occurs to his mind, though. "What has Wulfham had to say about this, over the centuries? Surely the minister of the spirits would not take it lightly if they came to be taken for granted?"

Chi-Yosh considers the tale, and for a moment, thinks back to the Su'Katans. Perhaps that is another reason why they never spread more then they can; to not loose touch, to ensure that there is some fight and struggle with their survival, so they do not become disconnected from that which they have. A nod. He glances sideways to Davron, paying attention to the answer to come.

Ramar hangs on almost every word, as it were. He ends up taking a seat beside the ancient pilgrim, regarding her with a kind smile, and a thankful expression on his face. He is content to let her talk for as long as she likes, and when the stories come to a close, he speaks, "I see... thank you for telling that story... what of the Ministers? They have been affected over the years by this, no doubt? Or has it seemed to plateau out...?"

"Taken for granted? Oh, no no no," the old woman smiles up at Davron. "But, there are no more spirit-friends, only those few academics who take especial interest in learning of their wisdom, and the priests of each village's temple.. and of course, pilgrims like me." The old woman laughs softly, smiling. "Our Wulfham is as important a man as was his preceptor.."

Davron bows deeply, looking somewhat chastened. "I see. I apologize for jumping to conclusions, then..."

The old woman laughs mirthfully. "Were you an enemy, not a curious pilgrim, young man," she says, "your question would doubtlessly have reached the Minister's ear by now. That is his power and his calling."

There's a soft chuckle, one Ramar finds comes easily. "Ah... would it have? Then I am glad I am not an enemy... unless such a thing isn't as bad as it sounds. Just the same, I thank you for sharing what you have, and shall do my best to remain 'not an enemy'." Ramar gives his head a bow, amd ponders the four circles once more. He smiles, "If you should find yourself needing assitance somehow, do not hesitate to ask. I shall let you return to your prayers now, and I shall go to mine..."

Davron chuckles softly, trying to keep the faint hint of nervousness from his voice. If what the pilgrim says is true, then it must be that the spirits are listening, and speak to Wulfham of matters of import. "By your leave, ma'am, I will pray here with you for a time," he says, eager to prove his good intentions to any being that may be listening.

The woman smiles, waves and continues on her way.

Chi-Yosh gazes out over the tower's ledge, to the pouring rain over Syllum. It would seem Wulfham has power, says the old woman. If that were so, if he does have the strenght to have all the spirits nearby by the ear, then that would indeed mean there is more man to this situation then the unseen. His lips purse a moment, a shake of his head. The implications of the old woman are not grand. Here is to hoping that Wulfham's unseen organs have yet to spot them as a threat.

Together the three travellers say their final prayers, each offering whatever soft benedictions come to heart. They move down the path in meditative calm, silently considering what they have seen, heard and learned.

---

Marina's interview with Eldain, the minister of knowledge and academics is swift, concise, and useless. "The tests? Well, I can't speak of that..." The old man comments genially, shaking his bald pate and shrugging. "You're certainly going to profit well from this matter, if your intentions are honest, and I'll certainly support you, if you prove faithful... Fortunately for you, the tests search not for nobility, only integrity." Having learned what she can, Marina departs.

---

It's dusk when the three pilgrims return to the capital. Marina, however, is not to be found in the restaurant where they gathered. Nor is she in her room, at the lodgings prepared for the company. According to the master of the hostel, she arrived rapidly, just before a particularly harsh burst of rain. He hasn't seen her since. When Davron pushes open the door to her room at last, braving modesty and privacy to be sure of Marina's status, he is confronted with a troubling scene indeed.

One window is open, and the rain that's pouring outside is sprinking through it, adding little to the floor's already-damp state. The entire room seems to have been awash with water at one point. Of Marina there is no sign; her goods are still present, barring the possibility that she snuck out (unless she did so without her property). What could have happened?

Davron turns to the others, looking alarmed. "She's not there. Something's gone wrong." He strokes the leather wrapper of his powerbow. "Nothing's been disturbed, so it's not burglars. We need to go after her."

Chi-Yosh frowns, over Davron's shoulder, spying the fact that there is no one in the room. He steps past the scholar, and drops a hand to the wet floor, before crossing to the window. He has to wonder if all of that water may have come purely from the sprinkling, or if something else... But first he sticks his head out the window, to see if Marina had exitted the window, she could have climbed down easily. Or if there are signs of someone else climbing **in**.

_Water?_ Ramar looks about carefully, cautiously as he notices the way the room seems to have been. He looks around, tilting his head to regard the window, and then he ponders the luggage still within the room. "I wonder... if she'd have left for another place, withoug bringing her things? No... something's afoot. Well then, it looks as though we shall have to find her. And rescue her, should she need it." Ramar runs for the door, glancing outside of it to see what he can see...
