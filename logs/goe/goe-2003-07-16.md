# Gods of Eden 2003-07-16

What rises from the pool, to the consternation and surprise of the three men standing near its shore, is a female form, clad only in clinging water. However, there is nothing of the carnal about her.

"I am Heavenly Aspect of Water," the woman says, her blue body shifting and altering even as the words roll from her lips. Her voice is that of the creek or gentle stream, rippling over stones and singing faintly as she speaks. The very definition of her form is ever-changing. Her hair rolls away from her head and into the waves of a slow-moving waterfall that trails out behind her. Her eyes are seemingly the only constant, and even they ripple and shine, reflecting the light of the moon in twin pools of purest spring water. Her face, too, subtly alters itself moment by moment, but always it describes a vision of feminine loveliness.

Beyond the pool, legs crossed comfortably in front of her, Marina looks up, as she hears the voice. Once she moves, she becomes immediately obvious, although previously shade and stillness had cloaked her form. Seeing her companions, her eyes narrow, then widen at the evidence of combat. Pursing her lips together, she shakes her head. "Ah. Well. Glad you could join us."

Davron smiles bashfully, and bows to the apparition. "Pardon us for the interruption. We were seeking our missing comrade..." He nods to Marina. "Whom we have now found, if I'm not mistaken," he adds with a slight grin.

Chi-Yosh watches with surprise as the woman of the waves rises, concieved of the pool itself. He dips his head in respect for a moment out of respect, and listens, simply. This, he finds is somewhat of a marvel; a being concieved completely of water's embrace. Such a beauty that compasses that of mortals, but into something like a living landscape. His attention shifts, though, to Marina, earning yet another startlement to his features. "You are well, Marina?"

"I am Ramar, at your service," responds said Solar, as his eyes take in the surroundings and scene laid out before him. He kneels, respectfully, offering a more formal greeting in the High Realm's speech. He'd been studying it before leaving, after all. His feet shift back and forth as he rises, "Pardon us if we're intruding..." He then nods to Marina, "And we're glad that we could join you as well. I believe you're alright, from the look of things. It is good to see you again."

Slowly rising to her feet, Marina nods at Davron. "Indeed. I am surprised you took so long ... was the message not sufficiently informative?" One brow is definitely raised higher than the other, and she seems oddly displeased. "I was beginning to wonder who would arrive first; the barbarians or you."

As Davron takes in the situation, some of the mysteries in the capitol become clearer. "I take it you met with our friend Marina in the capitol?" he asks the being - a spirit, he's guessing. "The only message we had was Marina's trail, alas - and presumably the water in the room, though unfortunately we lacked the knowledge to interpret that message." He frowns slightly. "As for the barbarians... well, I'm afraid we encountered them on the way." As if the signs of the recent combat weren't clear enough for Marina to read.

Ramar ponders, "Message? We were given no messa-" _No... we weren't. I suspect the Barbarians meant to give us this message, and what did we do... attacked them out of turn._ "But then we didn't give ourselves a chance to be delivered one. Forgive me, but I believe we attacked the barbarians, and thus received no message."

Ramar says, "I do believe, I feel as though a fool might, except not quite so wise."

Chi-Yosh smiles but brief as things fit together for him. Ah ha. "And we will likely be meeting them again. Or one of them, at least... one whom I wish we would not."

Sighing, Marina looks at her companions and shakes her head. Honest. These ... these _children_. "The innkeeper? Surely you checked with him? I was in a hurry, yes, but I did take the time to leave a brief note, including directions and a warning." She looks at the spirit. "Meanwhile, we have a conundrum to deal with."

"Check with the innkeeper? Now..." says Ramar, in a voice which clearly indicates that the concept of sarcasm, while lost on many, is not lost to him, "Would we ever do a thing like that? It makes far too much sense."

Davron shakes his head. "The innkeeper only told us that you arrived in a hurry and went straight to your room. He said nothing about any messages, and we didn't think to ask."

Chi-Yosh looks confusedly for a moment, but his comrads fill in anything he might have said otherwise. He can often count on them to speak for him, most often; their tongues are quicker... or in Ramar's case, usually always out of it's sheath.

Straightening her sleeves, Marina smiles amiably at Ramar. "Ah well. You're new enough at this. Rest assured, if I'm not dying, and not held hostage, I _will_ leave a note with my hosts. I would suggest, in passing, that you plan on doing the same. We could have saved a great deal of worry." She turns to face the spirit, and smiles. "But the pool is still safe."

"Indeed. Well I suppose being new enough is an excuse, however, excuses are much like nostrils, everyone has at least two." A smile creeps about Ramar's face, and he relaxes. There's a hint of sheepishness in his eyes though. _And to think, it would have been that easy to check for a message. Well, if I learn at least that, I shall become wiser than I had been._ "As such, here is my second exucse. The Innkeeper recognized us enough to say you had gone to your room, but gave no message despite that. I suppose this is rather akin to, 'ask and you shall receive' but one must think to ask, I suppose. I should ask more questions."

Sighing, Marina nods. "And obviously ... hmmm. Come to think of it, I paid him to pass the message along. Not much, but it was only a sheet of paper."

Davron nods. "We should ask, when we get back," he says, with a slight grin. "Perhaps his lapse will be embarrassing enough that we might finagle some compensation for our trouble. The return of your money, for a start." The smile fades once more. "To return to the present... from _whom_ is the pool now safe?"

"First and foremost from the barbarians you encountered." Marina sighs. "This pool is ... When Malseyn and Syldun met, this pool was important to the spirit world. Now there are those who would see its powers destroyed."

Davron rubs his shoulder slightly. "Then it is only safe for the moment. We killed one or two of their number, but for the most part, we merely drove them off. If they are bent on the pool's destruction, they may yet return."

Chi-Yosh steps closer to the pool, and kneels beside it. He does not tip his feet within - he wants to, wondering if the water is different somehow - but resists, not knowing if such a gesture would be rude toward the lady of the pond. Hands settle into his lap, while he regards the Heavenly Aspect of Water. "Forgive me, lady. I do not know your ways... But if you are tied to water, and it is indeed water that falls from the skies, guided by the spirits of the Storm, do you know anything of them? Of this situation?"

Ramar shrugs, and bows once more. "Forgive the delay, and our ignorance. It is something that needs to change," he says, attention now on the spirit. "If I might ask-and forgive me if I ask improperly, I'm still uncertain of the proper mannerisms in this instance, and would ask to be taught, if the time is provided-would you be so kind as to inform us as to what our comrade has been off doing, as I'm sure it is important?"

After nodding at Davron, Marina gazes into the pool. "And yet ... answers lie within this pool, Davron, if we could but discern them. The Spirit has guided us to a window that looks on the spirit kingdom of Malseum, the spiritual kingdom that mirrors the valley."

The woman smiles, a soft and vividly emotive expression that almost literally lights up her face. "I was born in this valley from the love of Malseyn and Syldun, and I have lived my life in the waters of this pool where their eternal affection was mutually pledged." She turns somewhat, sending ripples through the pool's surface. "I am.. tied here. It was very painful to leave, but... I dreamed of Marina's coming, and so I sought her.." The woman bites her lip and lowers her head, staring intently into the waters beneath her feet.

Looking at the spirit, Marina can't help but smile back. A smile completely lacking edges, or sharp pointy corners, but evoking merely friendship. "I cannot help but wonder, though, if the pledge that was made was kept." She looks at the valley in the distance, eyeing the rain clouds that cover the skies.

"The two heroes were to be betrothed," Heavenly Aspect explains. "But.. in planting the seeds of the kingdom here, each was obliged to seek other mates, to secure themselves politically. They met here for the last time... Syldun went on to become the first ruler of the material kingdom below, while Malseyn gave order and peace to the chaos of the Celestial Bureaucracy here.. she was their ruler, in a sense."

"Of course. WHat danger is it that these barbarians see in this pool? Or is there another reason entirely that they would see this place destroyed? If even they are bent on the destruction of your waters, Heavenly Aspect?" Ramar's voice is tinged once more with that familiar curiosity.

"That is clear," she replies. "They must fear what someone may learn by looking into the waters, through which one may glimpse the spirit world. But their motive for that is.. unclear."

Ramar looks rather puzzled just then... "Barbarians... afraid of what they would learn from the spirits? That doesn't strike me as... usual? Or perhaps I am merely thinking of their Shaman. Perhaps it has something to do with who or what instigated the latest troubles in the lands below?"

Chi-Yosh gazes upon the Heavenly Aspect and nods his head. He can see the pledge, the oath and the joining of the kingdomes to create a bond, that bond this pond, and thus the bond and oath that birthed the watery woman.

Marina exhales slowly, looking at the spirit. "Yes. The first step is learning." She gestures at the men behind her. "Now, we have two who can guard, and two who can look and discern meaning." She smiles. "Will you show us what you can, Heavenly Aspect? Or perhaps, show us what you think we need to see?"

Davron nods. "Before we begin, though, I'm curious about something. What manner of woman was Malseyn, that the Celestial Bureaucracy of this area accepted her as ruler?"

Ramar says, "I am curious as to the situation of the Celestial Bureaucracy as it stands now, if indeed Malseyn is still around? Or what had happened to her?"

"She was the Speaker to Dragons, it is said," recites Heavenly Aspect in a soft voice. "Whether she was Dragon-blooded herself, or a child of the spirits, or simply a gifted mortal woman, she could see greatly beyond herself.. Strong, but curiously gentle. She loved the world, and her departure from it was greatly mourned."

Chi-Yosh takes it by Marina's tone that he is to guard. He does not mind but... He would like to peer into the pond. Later. There is important business to be had. Rising to his feet, a gesture to Ramar to follow him, he takes up silent post, watching for those who may come up, to let the man watch for those that may come down. Though is eyes drift back to the pool, to the Heavenly Aspect. _I will learn of many things of the spirits later. Before we leave for Korad, or atleast Nane, I shall return, and talk muchly with her._ For now, however, he merely listens, and watches.

In answer to the second question, Heavenly Aspect of Water sinks beneath the surface of the pool, and those who watch its blue ripples find themselves growing hazy and logy as a state of semi-detachment drips into their very bones, a contented sort of sleep that is the gateway to a mystic trance.

A rather curious look is shot towards Chi-Yosh when he gets up. Even more so when he is motioned for. Ramar stays seated, though he speaks, saying, "Chi-Yosh, why do you stand? Come and sit, if we are set upon, I believe we shall be able to deal with it, and contrary to Marina's beliefs, we four are capable of looking and discerning meaning, as wella s guarding. If nothing else, they will be heard approaching." Ramar then stands and heads for the pool, peering inside, gaze drifting lazily past contented ripples, as a similar feeling begins to wash across his own form.

Davron glances at Ramar, as he stares into the pool, and watches an expression of lassitude wash over his companion's face. "I rather suspect we _can't_ watch and guard at the same time, Ramar," he says quietly. Then, a moment later: "Ramar?" Nodding to himself, he walks away from the pool to join Chi-Yosh.

Watching Davron assume guard position, Marina smiles at him. "Thank you. My back feels a lot less exposed now." Then she sinks back to the ground, legs crossed, and looks into the pool.

Beneath the waves, then, those who watched the water look up. They do not drown, but they float in this soft space. It is as though they have risen from a long slumber and now rise to the surface of the pool from within its depths. The mountains have risen, their peaks clawing at the sky above. Below in the valley, what once resembled stormclouds can be seen more clearly as a battleground.

Chi-Yosh considers Ramar's remarks, and had expected him to guard. However, watching as Marina and Ramar do not respond when gazing into the depths of the misty pool, he merely smiles a moment. A nod to Davron as he rises, and comes forward.

Turning to watch Ramar, floating beside her, Marina points at the battle clouds. Her lips move, for a moment, and then she shakes her head, merely motioning, suggesting that they try to move closer.

Clouds move as shields; lightning strikes like spears, as the monumental gods of the sky clash against each other. The rumbling of thunder is their battle-cry, as each swears victory and dominance over his rivals. Rain pours from every cut that is opened by the weapons of these awesome deities. "This is the war of the gods of Malseum and Korad," radiates Heavenly Aspect, from every direction around the observers. "And there...." The focus of those watching is drawn to the valley below, in which a hemisphere of Essence rests. Periodically it is assaulted by one of the warring spirits overhead, but every attack is rebuffed.

"By the Fish's Net..." exclaims Ramar, as he recalls a Western expression, reserved for moments like this. He turns slowly, each motion dreamlike and surreal, almost. A hand floats effortlessly through the waves, moving towards the stormclouds and battlegrounds below. As he nears, he would mutter a stronger curse, but his mouth is unable to do much besides keep shut. He glances down once more, and at the battle, then at the hemisphere of Essence. "What started the war to begin with? And... what... is there?"

The warded barrier seems proof against every attack. Of course, Davron and Chi-Yosh would recognize this site immediately. Even the others would be aware of it. It is the citadel of Syllum, the fortress where flowers grow and lightning strikes. "I do not know how Minister Wulfham amassed such protection," says Heavenly Aspect quietly, voice flowing. "Or if it is not his doing, I am at a loss to explain it... I cannot penetrate or see beyond the barrier, but I know this. There are spirits who are free to pass it, and they have received definite orders from whoever commands it."

Looking carefully at the barrier, Marina's eyes narrow thoughtfully. "Spirits pass in and out? They receive orders? Can you tell us what these orders are? Or perhaps, how they act after they pass back out?"

"That I do not know," responds Heavenly Aspect, sadly. "I am not strong enough to venture forth often, and I command enough respect that these spirits of wind and water will not trouble me.. But, I do know this much. The men who came to destroy me and my home set out near the barrier, almost to the very hour in which much spiritual traffic passed through it."

"It all comes together now. Or more of it than before. This battle..." Ramar's eyes are drawn upwards, if there is such a direction in this place. "Carries into the other Realms. The sky is filled with a battle, that few mortals shall ever know." He inclines his head towards Marina, "A wise question to ask, do you know which spirits pass through the barrier? Which deities of which people pass through it? What traffic was there after they had set out, and these men, what did they look like? Were they the barbarians?"

Marina looks at Ramar, her gaze troubled. Then she gazes once again at the barrier, seeking to wring every mote of information from it, as one would wring a wet rag in the desert to get the last drops of water out. Her body stills, as she stretches out, collecting what she can, to strengthen her when she stands before the Council. There will be questions to ask Wulfham ...

Ramar glances back at Marina, his gaze awash with wonder and curiosity, and no small degree of concern. He wills a semblance of reassurance to become present when he catches Marina's troubled look, then looks once more at the barrier. More to the point, he peers to see what passes in and out and around it... before being inevitably drawn towards it once more. "It does not seem to be a Manse... for such a thing should have shown up on my survey... if i had done it right... do you have any guesses as to what it is, Marina?"

Still unwilling to speak more than absolutely necessary in a realm where she does not know who can hear her, Marina shakes her head. She does, however, think that perhaps they should return to the pool after she has been hired by the Council. Something else she hasn't had time to tell her companions about yet.

Turning to regard Heavenly Aspect, Ramar asks, "Can you show us those who would do you harm? Those who set out from Syllum...? And if you are able to, will you do such a thing, Heavenly Aspect?"

"I cannot. Your vision is limited by the pool itself; it cannot take you anywhere other than where it is," she replies. "But I sense that you have already met them."

Davron overhears some of this, as he paces back and forth on guard, and mutters dark imprecations under his breath. "They came by way of the citadel? I don't like this, Chi-Yosh.. something ill is afoot in the valley."

Nodding at Ramar, Marina smiles. There will be tales to tell, once the pool has released them. She turns back to the spirit. "Thank you." She gestures at the clouds, and the citadel. "We have learned much. May we return?"

"Ah. You dwell elsewhere within this realm, I take it..." His head tilts for a moment, and he asks, "Were they the men we encountered on the mountains, or were they still in the city? You lead me to believe you have seen them, though if I am mistaken, forgive me for misunderstanding, Heavenly Aspect." Ramar's voice is practically aglow with curiosity, but then common sense comes in from the next room over to see what all this light's about, and Ramar settles down. "But perhaps we should return, if there is nothing more we can see while in here, though I would ask to return at some time... if such a thing were allowed to be asked..."

Looking out over the Valley, the stormclouds which are a veilled battle unseen by him, Chi-Yosh nods,hearing the conversation himself. "Not merely afoot, Davron. But a-ankle, aknee, and athigh, perhaps."

"I was aware of them when I led Marina up the mountain," explains Heavenly Aspect. "I dared not show myself to them, and thus we took another route, whie they were distracted."

The trance ends; Heavenly Aspect of Water again rises from the surface of the pool, and the observers regain their senses. Nothing has gone amiss while they were "away"; Chi-Yosh and Davron are safe and secure.

Ramar stretches out, as though he'd been sitting in that trance for hours. "Ahhh." He then proceeds to ask Davron and Chi-Yosh, "Were you able to overhear our conversation? If so, perhaps we can form a plan of some sort... if not I'll be happy to recount it for you."

Slowly awakening from her trance, Marina looks back at the group. "I think I have information you should be aware of ..." She pauses, marshaling her thoughts. "A few days hence, I am to appear before the Council. They will consider hiring me, or perhaps us, as emissaries to those Korad. Wulfham, of course, will be there."

Chi-Yosh turns to Heavenly Aspect. "The other path up the mountain. Where does it lead? The barbarians went that way, but does that lead back to Korad, or emerely to the top of the mountain?"

The woman shakes her head. "The paths on the mountain are numerous and twisting. There is no clear way to tell their destination."

Davron nods grimly as his two companions return to the world of the mundane. "I wonder, Marina, if your petition made someone... nervous. I doubt it was a coincidence that brought us here just in time to stymie their assault."

"If we followed them, however, we may gain an idea of where it is they lead. Enough to suit our purpose. Did you wish to track them, then?" Ramar's voice is calmed now, and he can be heard to inhale and exhale slowly, once more surveying Creation that lay outside the pool. "There are more questions to be answered now, than there were before.

Marina smiles at Davron. "Indeed. We have ... " She pauses. "No, we will not pose these questions, but we will know them, and perhaps they will guide me at the council." She looks at the young men. "I would ask one of you to join me, to stand as bodyguard. But you will not speak." She narrows her eyes. "Neither floridly nor briefly; if you join me, you must give no evidence of your intelligence." Then she considers Ramar's words. Tracking does not seem the wisest action to her. Better to discern Wulfham's motives, since the barrier is his.

Chi-Yosh shakes his head towards Ramar. "The best tracker here is you with your sharp eyes and senses. Other then that, there is no telling. And while the giant is with them, I doubt the men will answer questions. It may be best if we ask questions to who sent them in Syllum. And do so quietly; there is no telling who's ears may be onto us."

Davron looks down into the valley. "I suspect we may learn as much by following their trail backward as forward," says the young scholar, his eyes squinting suspiciously in the direction of the citadel below. "Many of our questions might have their answers within the walls of that citadel."

Chi-Yosh's attention shifts to Marina, and he merely needs to smile, before simply crossing his arms, glowering towards her, and standing with a guarding, almost menacing stance.

Ramar says, "Another question to learn the answer to, is whose barrier it is... I suspect it may be Wulfham's but there are others who have the knowledge to do such a thing. And they're not terribly uncommon if I am correct."

Ramar says, "One question that sticks out furthermost in my mind, which is entirely too relevant here, is how do we intend to safeguard the pool, if we are to all leave?"

"There's nothing suspicious in protecting the citadel from this weather war," Davron remarks. "Any Minister of Spirits would erect such a barrier, if he knew the way of it. No, what is truly suspicious is that a party of barbarians was sent from there to here. We did not know of this place before the Heavenly Aspect guided Marina here. Who guided them? Answer that question, and we may have the solution to this war."

Ramar says, "Or more questions to be answered. Such is the way of things, however you raise a good point. Chi-Yosh? You are silent, even for you... what manner of thoughts are drifting through your head that bring about that guarded look of consternation?"

Davron blinks, and glances at Chi-Yosh, nodding. "Ah yes, I was wondering what you thought, mysel..." he trails off, as he notices Chi-Yosh's posture. A grin to Marina, as he says, "Looks like you've got yourself a bodyguard..."

Chi-Yosh merely gestures at Davron's words, before offering a smile towards Ramar, in explination. "I think Davron is wise in the suggestion to track the barbarians' starting point, instead of following them. We can find out where they started, and then see where that may take us."

"Indeed. And to protect the pool? What steps will we take then? And what steps will we take to find those that guided the barbarians here?" Ramar regards Chi-Yosh and smiles, "You strike an excellent guardsman pose."

Looking at Chi-Yosh, Marina nods. "Excellent." She smiles wryly. "Now just remember not to speak."

"There is one spirit who may guide you, if you wish to follow your quarry," says Heavenly Aspect of Water, as the discussion continues. "There is a Shrine to Patient Mantis in the mountains, and it is a spirit renowned for its ability to follow all trails." She beckons Chi-Yosh closer, then wraps her arms around his neck and presses close. Her lips, warm and moist, press to his, and water flows into his mouth in a soft stream. The spirit draws back. "You carry my token. Patient Mantis will recognize you and speak, if it is still present."

"Can you provide us with guidance towards this Shrine to Patient Mantis? If not, we must set out then to find it. Is it far from here?" Ramar then provides Chi-Yosh with a grin, "Ah, a fine way to carry a token, if ever there was one, I suppose."

Davron raises his eyebrows at this, with a slightly mischievous grin. "There's the matter of protecting _this_ place, of course. But perhaps they've taken enough pause from our earlier encounter. I note that they haven't come up the whole time we've been here."

Chi-Yosh comes forward, at the spirit's encouragement, and takes a moment to blink at the kiss. It was a surprise, but a welcome one. The water is warm and comforting, sitting like a weight in the back of his throat. Not drowning, does not seek to seep into his throat, nor push against his lips. It will stay, until he wills it not to. "Thank you," He says, testing the water as much as honoring Heavenly Aspect. "I am honored. I hope to return, to speak to you at lenght of your knowledge, Heavenly Aspect." He offers a bow, before shooting a playful smile Ramar's way. "Agreed."

"This is true. I doubt that we shall be seeing hide nor hair of them any time soon, though we are destined to re-encounter one another. There is a matter of honor to be dealt with, after all." Ramar inhales, exhales, seems calmed and refreshed. "Onto the shrine then?"

Thus armed, the four Solars set out on foot, winding their way through the mountains and travelling southward. A few pilgrims are encountered along the way; when questioned, all universally report no sign of any primitives or half-dressed armed men. Wherever the party's assailants have gone, it's clear that they are wasting no time loitering here. The party walks through the gathering gloom of late afternoon, and each observes the Sun sinking into its bed of distant mountains.

The Shrine of Patient Mantis is a circle of rocks around an empty space. In the light of the setting Sun, the stone surfaces seem to dance with fire as the rays of sunlight reflect off the hidden angles of half-embedded minerals. Chi-Yosh, in accordance with his Essence-given instincts, steps into the circle and quietly waits. After several minutes of motionlessness, he feels a presence.

A mantis crawls from behind one of the stones, leaping to alight on the man's shoulder. "I go where you go, Chosen of the Celestials," whispers a directionless voice, audible to the four gathered here. The distinct feel of an un-materialized spirit's presence touches the perceptions of those gathered, in the form of a slight chill and prickly sensations through the skin. "My services are yours, until you wish no more of me."

"Good day to you, Patient Mantis, I'm called Ramar." He looks curiously at a direction he'll pretend the source of the prickly chill is coming from. He nods to Chi-Yosh, "I do believe this is where you should speak and so on and so forth?"

Davron laughs softly. "Don't rush the man, Ramar. Besides, he's supposed to be the silent bodyguard, isn't he?" He settles down and bows toward the mantis. "Your help is much appreciated."

Following Davron's lead, Marina bows lightly and smiles. "Thank you."

Chi-Yosh glances up to regard the insect with curiousity, and draws his hand up to draw a finger before it, side to side. He has watched one or two of these creatures, how they may wait, motionless, until the moment to strike like some snakes. He feels the presence, and merely nods, willing the water to slide down his throat, sure of Heavenly Aspect to only give the most pure and healthy of waters with her kiss. But the liquid is more like condensed... power; he can feel it almost merging with him, filtering down inside his body like ethereal raindrops of energy. More of a nod of his head, a bowing gesture to the center of the circle, before turning his head towards the mantis itself. "Your presence is honored and appreciated, master of this shrine. Would you help us with tracking, Patient Mantis of the sunlit rocks?"

"I will," the voice replies again, after a measured pause. And with that, the light fades from the rocky circle as the Sun completes its journey into the night. All that remains now is a rosy twilight, here on the windy mountaintops.
