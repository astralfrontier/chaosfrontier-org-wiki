# Gods of Eden 2003-07-30

Chi-Yosh stares out the window, into the stormy night. So dark and trembling out there. Hopefully, the moon and sun will be seen by Syllum again, will warm their rooftops and give the night a welcoming glow. And hopefully the circle can deliver such things. His shoes and weapons are left at the bed side, but the Su'Katan does not remove his pants, as he gets into bed. It is merely a matter of habit, for no one knows when they may be ambushed, may need the meager protection of cloth, or the decency lest they run into the night for the nearest person for help. Prayers are left, and he eases into bed, to let sleep find him.

With the day's challenges behind them, Marina and Chi-Yosh both take to their respective beds. It will be a hard journey tomorrow, to bring news to the other Solars dwelling in the northern forest. Supplies have been accounted for; plans have been discussed. All that remains now is to succor weary bodies and minds. And as Chi-Yosh sleeps, he finds himself unaccountably stirring. Fitfully tossing, uncomfortably turning, he at last sits upright to the faint sound of chanting, coming from the stables and storage-area attached to the Inn. The sonorous voices, curiously bestial, join with the staccato of the rain to create an otherworldly song.

Chanting, eery voices rattle straight to the base of the awakened warrior's spine. They say that women have intuition. As do warriors. He is unsettled, left uncomfortable and wary. If this is normal, or at least, harmless, then merely Chi-Yosh is skiddish like a rabbit. But if there is reason for concern... He slides into the boots, his chainmail shirt, and the rain cloak, his weapons kept inside. With that, he moves towards the stables, towards the rhythmic voices with a growing pit of unease in his stomach.

The stables and storage consist of a wooden enclosure, perhaps fifteen yards to a side and four yards high. They can be entered by a gate beside the inn, or through a small side-door from the building itself. The stables are empty now, for horses and other mounts are irritable and intractable in rain. Instead, boxes, crates and kegs of all sizes and descriptions are stacked within this enclosure, forming a dense maze of damp wood. The gates are invitingly open. And beyond the confines of the Inn, a dense mist churns. Chi-Yosh creeps between the opened gates, and looks up. Three figures dance slowly on top of the crates stacked in the open area at the center of the stables. Three jaguar men, in fact, all armed. They turn as one, seeing the interloper, and ready their weapons.

Chi-Yosh, whatever he was expecting, did not believe he would see the jaguar men, here, or anywhere civilized. How did they get into the city? How did they track him down, how much of a coincidence is it that they are here, where he has found them? It is a good think his kamas are in his hands, and beneath the heavy coat, he shifts just slightly into a better defended stance, the kamas held close to his chest. With it closed, it does not look as though he is armed, prepared. But he is.

One of the trio - the leader, apparently - has the presence of mind his followers seemingly do not, and he leaps downward, his long and wickedly-barbed spear thrust outward. He snarls a battle-cry in his own peoples' tongue as he comes, the glint of battle-madness in his eyes.

Like bottled lightning unleashed, Chi-Yosh springs into action. Cloak flapping open, the glint of steel lashes out, catching the end of the spear as the warrior ducks underneath. A firm tug to the kama redirects the path towards a crate, and as he darts away, the jaguar's weight and momentum carries it in, to plant into the wooden box. Across the rows he moves, a jack rabbit with a purpose, arms pumping as he approaches one of the stacks that the other two cat barbarians have taken perch upon. In a full run, he hops onto another box, then leaps towards the closest stack, bringing his foot forward in a vicious kick at an unsturdy looking box near the base of the jaguar's perch. He's prepared to leap after the cat's teeter, if the strike is true, and if not... well, he has three feral men after him, one at his back.

The colission to the box rocks the stack, the jaguar man atop it rattled, and for the moment attempts to keep it's balance. Chi-Yosh's foot plants onto the top of a box, and jumps slightly in a brief spin, curling around to hurl the kama in a sweeping throw, the crescent blade spinning to slice across the feline's side to clink against the wall. The warrior falls to the ground, crouching, now with one weapon, putting his back to a stack while waiting for the counter attack.

None is forthcoming; the beast-man leader is whirling to re-orient himself against this menace which flew past him heedlessly, and his two subordinates are each busy attempting to gain initiative again, whether unbalanced or struck near-lethally.

Chi-Yosh realizes belatedly that the leader is behind him. Great. Immediately, he opens up a create beside him, and rolls on his heel, kicking the base of the crate's lid. Old wood on rusted hinges does not stand up to the firm blow, breaking loose wood, enough for him to turn on turn around, dropping to his knees. Instincts are to be applauded, for the motion turned aside the incoming spear attack, earning from his attacker a snarl of displeasure. The spear caught, Chi-Yosh darts forward with the remaining kama, the blade sweeping low, then jerking in a ragged sharp upward yank.

Steel sinks into fur, into flesh, a ragged tear opening up, before the yank of the blade earns a deeper slice into the feline body. A roar of displeasure is the Su'Katan's farewell, as he immediately turns, and darts like a grasshopper up a stack of boxes. The felines are at his heels, however, one's spear thunking into the wood at his feet, earning merely a stepping stone. But a sideways duck, a sweep of his weapon cleaves the second one's spear away, pushing the angry bite of the jaguar's maw away with his impromptu shield, before achieving the top of the stack. He has achieved the high ground... Now, he has to keep it.

With footing shaking, Chi-Yosh can do little else but channel the raw power of his calling. Like a sappling weaving among the heaving ground, he stays put, and keeps is ground. Staring the two growling jaguars in the face, a step back, before the warrior hurls himself headlong down the stack. The wooden makeshift shield is kept before his face, hiding the poised weapon, before at the last moment, it's swept aside, batting the guarding spear and letting his threshing weapon cleave through the air. Feet find their mark, and he's all ready stepping aside, weaving into the leader's defense, a sharp, closed in jagged slash to the midsection, before hopping back, a steel-fanged upper cut slicing in his wake.

The stable floor is stained with blood. The first blow was minor, catching Chi-Yosh's opponent in the forehead, a gash that lets blood trickle into its' eyes. Not as wicked as it could have been, but now blinded, the jaguar's instincts only carry it so far, letting it rush the first swipe... only to be nearly esviscerated by the upward sweep of the kama. Blood blossoms, but the victor is not finished. Shield cast aside, the jaguar's dropped spear is collected, spun, and stabbed into the jaguar's back. Chi-Yosh steps atop the fresh corpse, bringing his kama up to smear hot blood across his face. The rain cloak falls open, as he releases a roar of challange to the remaining jaguars, tearing the spear loose to hold it in ready poise to throw.

A death rattle erupts from the corpse beneath him, animated by the eruption of energy, raw and angry, from the warrior's terrifying form. Blood nearly steams on his forehead, across the weapon, as eyes nearly glow in their glare. Chi-Yosh's crouch, his grip on the spear mimic the jaguars enough to, with the casted shadows, pulled towards him by energies unknown to the primitives, he appears like vengeful spirit of their slain leader, or perhaps the consumer of that fighter's power. The roar he calls them with ends with a purely predatory growl, the stench of death and promise of more hangs like a thick mist in the air.

"STOP!" rings a commanding, guttural voice, that claims the night air for its own. The two jaguar-men, already cowering despite their ferocious anger of only seconds before, cease motion entirely, pinioned between two powerful wills. The voice belongs to a robed figure, whose face like that of the Jaguars, but for three primary differences. The cheeks and jaw and neck are marked with ritualistic scarring. The forehead burns with a silvery mark, not unlike the one that Chi-Yosh has seen in still pools of water in times past, burning from his own forehead after that life-altering moment. And the eyes are hard, graven with ages of sorrow and steady with malice.

"You, who desecrated the Sacred Place.." the robed beast-man growls. "You, who took the Sacred Stone.. You, who have no knowledge of its meaning. Even my Dream-sent warriors could not face you, the Sun's Chosen." The figure steps forward, stretching out a furry hand and extending one clawed digit. "Return to the lands of your birth soon, Bronze Tiger. Or I will haunt your dreams and dog your footsteps to the very gates of Malfeas." He turns, rippling out of existence. So too fade the bodies (living or dead) of the trio of warriors. And so, soon, does the stable. Chi-Yosh awakens in his bead, soaked with sweat. A dream... But one sent by sorcery.

Chi-Yosh sits up, immediately, gripping the sides of the bed. The dream is vivid, still in his mind, and every detail, including the jaguar. Another solar? Some shaman? The stone on his chest, felt against his skin, is hot. He had no idea they attended the manse, was not even aware they were very intelligent beings. He was attacked. He ran. For the first time, he feels guilty for the theft of the stone. The moss hearthstone is collected, and the Su'Katan stares into it's depths with worry. Return home, return to the Maze Forest. His attention shifts towards Marina's room. And he fears that he may have to go alone... or worse, to bring his circle-mates, into the obvious dangers head.

---

A knock on Chi-Yosh's door, as sunlight streams through his window. "Chi-Yosh?" Marina's voice carries well through the wood. "I'd like to leave before the nooning meal, if we can ..."

Chi-Yosh stares towards the door, startled. What timing. He shakes his head, needing to wash his face, calm the rapid beating of his heart. "Y-Yes," He calls, voice a touch shakey. "I will be prepared shortly."

The morning's light is blinding, as Marina and Chi-Yosh step out of the Inn. The reason becomes apparent after just a moment - the sun is shining, although the perpetual rain-clouds aren't far away, and seem to be regrouping themselves. "Good morning, madam," says a strongly assured voice. Its owner comes into view after a moment of blinking. He wears the red robes of military station in Syllum, and his subordinate soldiers - gathered behind him in formation - are likewise attired. All are armed. "We are your escort to Korad. We will depart at your leisure."

Marina raises an eyebrow. "A military escort?" She looks amused. "Pray tell me, sirrah, who sent you along?"

Chi-Yosh stands at attention, solid, a stone. Inwardly he's still contemplating the meanings, large and small to the dream, but outwardly he tries to show no indication of the storm within, while the storm without is kept at bay. A mere nod to the escort leader and his interrogee.

"We were detached from our posts by Minister Kynbirg to guard you, madam," the captain replies, bowing. "The Council and King stand behind you, and I am told that your safety is our sole objective. We are ready when you are."

Smiling, Marina shakes her head. "Please convey my deepest gratitude to the minister, captain. You may wish to mention that I have taken the oath, and will abide by it, but that I deem it much more prudent to appear in Korad without a large ..." She pauses, and looks the soldiers over appreciatively. "And especially a well armed contingent of troops. They might mistake you for the vanguard of an invasion. Perhaps a single soldier?"

Shaking his head, the captain demurs. "We have our orders, madam, although it seems wise to me to make our intentions known when we get there." Then his voice grows a little less precise, a little more human. "Please, madam, let's cooperate. We don't want our families' farmlands drowned out any worse. We don't want to fight the barbarians."

Sighing, Marina accepts the inevitable. She smiles, trying to foster good will. "I agree, Captain. Fighting is definitely not on my agenda." She looks down at her robes. "I do so hate having to replace my wardrobe." Looking at Chi-Yosh, she looks pensive for a moment. "We will be joined by others, Captain ... Tell me, Captain, how should I address you? You may call me Marina, although the prefix of Lady would be preferred when in public."

"I am Captain Lev," the man says, saluting smartly. But he grins again, showing his farmer's face through the regimen of discipline. "But, as you are not even a citizen, Lev is fine, ... uh, Marina. So, are we ready?"

Chi-Yosh clears his throat a second, and steps forward, beside Marina. "Captain Lev, would you and your men be willing to walk thirty paces behind us, if there is no means by which we can merely make the journey ourselves? WHile two can move much quickly, they also make less noise and are... not a big wading company of many. If there is trouble, you may rush to our aid, as you have orders to, but atleast let us move unhindered." A smile. "Unless surprised, you will make a better target then we." The statement is almost innocent, along with his smile.

Looking at Chi-Yosh, Marina shakes her head. "No, Chi-Yosh. Thirty paces is far too deferential." She smiles at the captain. "Although, Lev, some space will always be appreciated. My friends move quickly, and at will."

The departure from Syllum is uneventful. As Korad lies up-river, an overland path is the best route to take, and the men offer every pace of distance that is compatible with the safety of their charges. Heavy work-boots slog through the muddy soil, in those areas where a solid road is not available - which seems to be a problem in the northern regions of the valley, where the rains have washed topsoil out across the road. In due course the company reaches a little village in the northern reaches. Captain Lev supplies the cost of rooms for his detachment of soldiers, as well as for his two civilian companions, explaining that this is the least he can do to compensate Marina for the trouble of their company.

The next morning sees a return of the rain. The water burns hot as it strikes the few areas of bare skin that travelling cloaks sometimes expose, but for the most part the company is well protected against the deluge. By late morning the company achieves a stone shelter constructed at the side of the Guild-road, in the narrow belt of independent land between Syllum and Korad. The Captain and his company are content to make their meal of bread, cheese, diced nalan root and wine, and to watch the rain.

Chi-Yosh comes to sit beside Captain Lev. "I have been requested by the lady to scout ahead." Not one for small talk. "She is... wary of those who may be poised in wait, and I have keen eyes and know how to move among the trees. I wish merely to observe, and fear I could endanger any of your men if they accompanied."

Chi-Yosh, with the captain's blessings, heads out into the wood while the men are still enjoying their break. He had merely had a small bite, while he makes post haste to Korad, Patient Mantis in tow. He wishes to find Goran and quickly; the giant may jump to conclusions, with disasterous concequences.

The scout and spirit depart, leaving Marina alone with the soldiers. In due course they conclude their break, and lead on toward the boundaries of Korad. The woodlands are quiet and haunted, with directionless sounds of owls and other stranger beasts, but Marina has been instructed via Chi-Yosh in the tracks and signs to follow. She and the soldiers walk the Spirit Tracks, those strange trails of packed earth blessed by the gods of this land, watching for the peculiar growths of plant-life or inscribed runes that mark the way through the maze of the forest. In due course they pass by the tribal land claimed by Goran, and Marina alone steps off the path and into the wild, tree-shaded space beyond. Water drips like tears from the green canopy overhead, a product of the incessant rain.

"Ah. Pleased to see you could come join us at long last Marina. Tell us of how your meeting went. We've the time. Oh and meet Goran here. He's quite the fellow you know, when you get to know him. How have you been? Find anything else out that is of use for us?" Ramar's feet carry him gracefully across the ground, his toes crunch against the dried leaves and grasses, as they're unshod at present. With a familiar tilt of his head, Ramar asks his questions, and he settles in to listen, with a smile and a nod for the soldiers, "Greetings to you gentlemen as well."

Ramar says, "How are you gentlemen? Alright, I should hope? The trek wasn't terribly long?"

Chi-Yosh leans against a tree, resting comfortably from his brisk run. He merely nods to Marina and the soldiers, but keeps his eye on Goran.

Marina sighs, ignoring Ramar's stream of questions utterly, and looks at Davron for a moment before turning to Goran. Dropping a slight bow, she smiles. "Greetings, Goran. There has been much news that I would like to share with my friends; the council meeting was successful, as these gentlemen accompanying me can attest. Now, we come to hear the Korad side of this tale of woe."

Ramar is quite used to being completely and utterly ignored by Marina it would seem. He neglects to inform her of this fact, and simply turns, offering a shrug to those who care to accept such an offering. He strides almost silently along the ground, pausing to glance about the forest, keeping an eye out for trouble. "I could tell you that, if you'd like, but I for some reason, imagine, that you would rather I didn't."

"Come, then," announces the giant, who has been waiting with the three Solars. "You warriors of Syllum, you are welcome in my land," he booms as well, extending a hand at least twice as large as any man's present. With that he turns, his dozen feet of muscle and whalebone almost shaking the earth as he strides. "A meal for the tribe will be ready soon, and you will all join us in eating!" he says as he walks.

Davron stands attentively nearby to Ramar, watching in fascination as the men of Syllum and Korad confront each other. He does breathe a sigh of relief at Goran's welcome, though, and turns to join in the meal.

Chi-Yosh follows Davron and the rest, at ease for now. And hopefully he will see what the mess in Korad is about, with the rest of his comrads. To the heart of the matter.

Ramar raises an eyebrow. "Oh... hmmm." _A feast? No doubt about it, it's to be thrown in honor of these representatives from Syllum, to put on a suitably delightful, almost civilized face to what the men would call Savagery. It's quie clever really, show your would-be enemy that you too are human, and perhaps your enemy is not your enemy in the end?_ "A feast sounds delightful."

Ramar says, "But perhaps, while we are awaiting such a glorious occasion, we can continue our investigations into the battling of the spirits?"

Raising an eyebrow at Ramar, Marina sighs. "Why so rushed, Ramar. can we not observe the simple pleasantries of feasting before discussing?" She shakes her head, muttering something about impatient children.

Ramar blissfully ignores Marina's scathing remark. Or at least he chooses not to play that game this day. "Rushed? Well, with each day that passes by, another battle is fought and more of the people we are striving to save and protect will suffer. The sooner this is brought about to an end, the better, if it is brought about to a proper end."

The village beyond the hilltop is one that stretches from the branches of the towering trees, almost down to their roots. Ladders and steps join the various elevations, with the real activity centered in the open area around which homes and shelters are built. Vines and rope have been used to tie loose branches to the canopy of wood overhead, providing shelter from the rain. Logs and stumps serve as tables, and it seems like a hundred people or more are gathered here to eat.

Ramar eats, though it's more of a pecking at the varied foods here and there. His mind is quite clearly elsewhere at the time. He taps his fingers idly, glancing about at the falling rain. He watches the soil washed away, and ponders, as he nibbles at some food, absently going through the ritual of meal-taking. "The food is lovely, though the circumstances surrounding it are poor."

Eating commences. Whatever aspect of civility the visiting Solars may have invested in Goran and his people is erased as they observe the manner in which these people satisfy their urges to eat. Time passes, and a prodigious belch from Goran himself, seated high on his throne of wood out in the open, signals a break in the meal. "Now we will talk about the situation which has plagued our two lands!" he announces, holding up two hands, and about three-quarters of his people render their attention to him. "Va, the _yurei_ blossoms, please!" One of the tribesmen jumps from her place and scuttles off into a subterranean dwelling, while Goran continues. "Now, outlanders, I will tell you just what was stolen from us."

Ramar finishes with his plate, and settles in to listen. He makes note of the pleasantries Marina had mentioned observing, and hides them behind a small smile that he allows to form around his lips. His attention darts across the table, and the immediate area, before he settles in on Goran. _At last. Knowledge. For the officials, of course._ "Charming fellow, isn't he, Marina? You're quite Charming yourself, at times. Charmed."

In due course Va returns, while Goran has been explaining. "In these lands, the spirits rule. The Spirit Tracks are the fence which confines us. But our great leader Kor settled in this land because of what he found here - a closer connection to the gods. We forge that connection with _yurei_." Va arrives, and quickly begins distributing ceramic flasks to the Solars and soldiers. "Drain them dry," Goran directs, referring to the liquid within. Meanwhile, Va lays out a selection of well-preserved flower blossoms, identical to those that Davron and Chi-Yosh observed growing in a box at the fortress of Syllum.

Narrowing her eyes, Marina looks at Ramar. "Now is not the time."

Ramar's eyebrows raise only slightly. He chuckles, briefly, to himself. There's a subtle flash to his eyes, just as he blinks them closed. He takes the ceramic flask in his hands, cupping them to the cool material. His fingers run across it slowly, their every movement somehow heightened by the flow of Essence. His nostrils flare as the sweet smelling scent from within the flask wafts up towards them, each odor heightened by the motes of Essence that gather themselves about his nose. His eyes flash open once more, and he looks inside, before downing the drink. "Ahhhh."

As the sweet-smelling potions are consumed, one by one, the drinkers find themselves growing strangely dizzy. The feeling passes after a moment, but the world seems strangely altered. Colors seem brighter; the rain reminds them more and more of a distant drum-beat, or a voice shouting inexplicable things. In due course each can hear Goran's soft voice, sounding as though it emanated from their own mouths. "Yurei.... the dreams of the spirits..... now, watch as we invoke Gaulderak." And as one, the drinkers listen and see Goran, and his people, beginning to speak. It is the native tongue that was heard earlier, the language spoken by the people of Korad. And as they speak it, a fine mist can be seen emanating from the mouths of each speaker.

Goran continues speaking, this time audible from every direction. "Yurei makes you dream, and in it you see the dreams of the spirits... you know what they know.... you become like a spirit, in your mind... through yurei, we learn the wishes of the gods.. But, they have abandoned us. Once, the gods gave us bountiful harvests... but now they seek only their own glory..."

The burning sensation of some liquid, making its way into the gullet of each dreamer, brings everyone sharply back into focus. The soldiers, and the four Solars, each find themselves regaining their senses, and somewhat uncomfortably. Va stands back, grinning a little and hefting a pitcher of whatever "wake-up juice" was employed. Goran smiles a little. "This is what that man took from us...we offered to trade the secret of yurei to him for his help in our crusade," he explains. "But.. he betrayed us."

After a moment, Chi-Yosh's cracked voice breaks the silence. "Wh-at is ... Gaulderak? You mentioned..?" The giant nods, and explains. "Gaulderak is the god of the Korad. We speak Gaulderak. He confines us to the Spirit Tracks, as long as we give him power over us.. Everyone in this tribe speaks Riverspeak now, by my command. But even so, the power of Gaulderak confines us. We are not yet able to cross the Spirit Tracks to unite Korad."

Ramar leans up, his eyes and head still swimming from the trance he's just now coming out of. He shakes his head, and makes sure that what he's seeing is what he's seeing, and reminds himself to be wary of heightening his attunement to Essence and his Senses in such instances. "Ah, so Gaulderak is your own... that makes sense. What can you do to break free of this control? What can you do to be able to cross the Spirit Tracks?"

"That man came," explains Goran, still further. "He learned of yurei, through deceit. He came to us, asking for its secret. Yurei is a flower that grows in our lands. It is precious to us, a link to the spirit world. He made offer of military help, for as long as Gaulderak has power, we cannot cross the Spirit Tracks to conquer the other tribes. We needed other strength of arms. He took enough yurei back to his homeland, but no aid was forthcoming. Then... the rains began. Tribes prayed to the spirits and the gods. Revenge was called for. But we could not march against the armies of our adversary." And it is noted that Goran scrupulously avoids naming the man or the nation, in the presence of its soldiers.

"To conquer Gaulderak, he must be banished from the tongues of our people," says Goran, clenching his fists together. "We must do this, or we will remain savages..."

Davron rubs his chin, grimacing at the flower before him. "So this is why the flower grows in Citadel..." He shakes his head at the duplicity, and returns to the present. "How can that be done, Goran? Must we speak to every Korad tribesman in the valley and teach him Riverspeak? The valley could overflow from the rains before we were done."

Marina looks thoughtful. "So now you seek revenge against the betrayer, and a way to abandon your language? Or ... that language at least?" She looks confused. "But how did you force your tribe to speak the river tongue?"

Ramar wonders, "What then, can change your language? What can destroy this name? How in fact, are you certain it will have an effect. Should you invent your own tongue? What prevents you from crossing the spirit tracks, and where is this... 'G' fellow located?"

"My tribe follows my wishes," says Goran proudly, and at this, his people do indeed rise and cheer, answering any doubts about the loyalty of the tribe. "And if I can force the other tribes to assent as well, we will be free. The tribesmen speak Riverspeak now, but... they will not speak it among themselves. They fear contamination. We must change that."

Marina nods. "So it is not a matter of teaching, so much as convincing them to use the language of the river exclusively?"

Ramar blinks, "No. It is not a matter of convincing. It is a matter of forgetting. How, though, does Gaulderak keep you savages, as you so succinctly put it? What power does he wield thta your language can cripple you so?"

Chi-Yosh considers this. They must convince the other tribes to not speak the words of their god... but if they cross into other territories, they may very well be slain, due to conflictions of territory and religion. Thus, they cannot do it alone, without force. A sticky situation. And the yurei is used by Syllum... perhaps it was not indeed Wulfham who immediately pursuaded the rains.

Davron still seems puzzled. "If Gaulderak only chains you to the Spirit Tracks... then why do the other tribes grant him that power? What is it that your people _gain_ from Gaulderak? ...Or rather, what do they think they gain, in their blindness that you spoke of before?"

Though he omits the name, Goran lays out clearly the history of events. Minister Chirog came to the Korad lands, following his pattern of searching foreign lands for new herbs and medicines. He learned of yurei from the tribes. He offered the armed might of Syllum, to further Goran's ambitions for statehood, in return for yurei. And he took many samples away with him, back to Syllum. No aid was forthcoming, though; Goran was left high and dry. Angered, Goran spoke of the matter to the tribes of Korad (and though he does not say so, it's evident he carefully omitted his imperial ambitions when talking to them).

The tribes, in turn, spoke to the spirits of wind and water. Angry at the theft of their treasure, the men of Korad called on the spirits, invoking the old lore to anger them and drive them against the civilized lowland men. For centuries ago, before Malseyn came, the gods did wage such wars, and their memories of those times lingered. The tribes awoke the latent anger of the gods, reminding them of the past grievances, inciting them to attack their rivals in the southern valley kingdom.

The afternoon passes, as the tribe returns to its regular business. Goran, and several of his most trusted men and women, remain, and the soldiers withdraw to their own small camp-out, leaving the four Solars to discuss matters.

The discussion is long and heated, but not because the road of the past is darkened, for Goran's information has shed light on it. It is the road to the future that now occupies the thoughts of the Solars, and no lamp made by mortal hand can see it. The Master might offer insight, were he here; and those gathered carry their discussion on until twilight looms in the sky above. It is decided that the men will return to Syllum, while Marina stays and learns, in her gentle way, what can be learned.
