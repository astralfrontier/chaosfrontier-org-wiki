# Gods of Eden 2003-08-13

The three Solars debate for some time about how they might avail themselves of Chirog's collection of yurei, but only two approaches recommend themselves: sneaking in and taking some - and the guards look alert, and even Chi-Yosh doesn't feel that he could sneak past them; or talking their way in - which would be a role far better suited to Marina. Since Marina is currently in Korad - where an ample supply of yurei is already present, as well as Goran's knowledge of how to use it - the three decide to make their way back to Goran's lands, there to reunite with Marina and discuss their next move.

With this decided, the trio again begin the journey north. The rain is a familiar, if not comforting, presence in the background, though thick travelling-cloaks and newly purchased furs from an itinerant trader provide a dry shelter in which to move. On their way past, the three observe that the northern river-bridge, and the roads and passes, seem to be more strongly guarded. Soldiers in their red robes stand guard with spears, sheltered under reed and straw umbrellas whose poles jut out of the mud to stand man-high.

Spotting her comrades walking into the camp, Marina smiles from where she is sitting, listening to Goran keep court.

"Ahhh. It is good to be back, I believe. If we can be truly said to be back." Ramar steps down from the branches, striding now along the ground. He bows graciously to Marina, "And it is good to see you again, as well. The blood still flows from the spirits, I see, but perhaps now that we are all together, there is something that can be done. Marina, would you care to assist us as we ask Goran about using the _yurei_ to learn more of the Heavenly Bureaucracy, and it's relation to the... Language."

Chi-Yosh walks towards Marina, listening to the Korad's leader do his duty. A slight wave towards Marina. A sideglance to Ramar, before he offers a slight bow to Marina. "There is some we must discuss, about the next course of action. What have you learned of your stay?"

Looking at Ramar curiously, Marina narrows her eyes. "Perhaps, Ramar, you could explain to me what you ... we seek to learn, before I question him? It might make it so much ... easier." She turns to Chi-Yosh, smiling. "Ah. Yes. Come. Goran has made free a room for me; we can talk there."

Striding across the clearing, Marina strides through the entrance of a low door, her head lowered just enough to avoid getting hit by the doorsill. Inside a pillow, a sleeping mat, a few lamps, and a bowl of fruit await. She turns, waiting for the others to follow, before settling on the mat. "Shall we exchange findings, Chi-Yosh?"

Ramar follows Marina and Chi-Yosh into the room. He picks an apple from the bowl, tossing it into the air and catching it, before idly pondering Marina once more. A ghost of a smile haunts his face, "We went back to Heavenly Aspect. What we hope to learn, is how Gaulderak controls his own court of spirits, and the oaths and hatreds which keep them bound to him and out of the Bureaucracy. We had also hoped that we might be able to learn if there were any old promises which might remind the battling spirits of why they stopped fighting in the first place..."

"

Looking at Davron and Chi-Yosh, Marina smiles. "Well, this I have learned; Goran is definitely a different leader. His tribe, the Goranjin, are the first and only ones to practice farming, striving to become more ... more as the people of the Hundred Kingdoms." She pauses for a moment, collecting her thoughts. "Thus one concern is assuaged; Goran will strive to provide more freedom from his people; particularly freedom from capriciousness. His leadership will strengthen Syllum." A second pause as she reconsiders Chi-Yosh's words. "His victory will weaken Gaulderak, and thus might make the others more amenable to negotiation. Did they name a negotiator?"

Davron takes up the fourth position in the circle, sitting cross-legged on the floor. "Heavenly Aspect seemed to feel, Marina, that _you_ were the one who could broker a peace between the spirits. That you could wear the mantle that Malseyn once bore." He leans back. "The order of the Celestial Bureaucracy is held together by a myriad of oaths. Those oaths still hold, but many of them are forgotten among men, and the spirits jealously guard their secrets... but the power of _yurei_ might be able to unlock them."

Ramar nods in agreement with Davron. "And I believe that we are all in agreement of this. Simply put... ah, but then I'm sure you've more to say, and perhaps, I am in danger of waxing poetic again." The Solar shrugs, and settles in, taking a bite of the apple. "So how shall we go about asking Goran for the _yurei_?"

Marina blinks for a moment, blushing slightly, and pulling her cloak around her shoulders to mask her sudden confusion. "I ... I see." Her shoulders pull back, her spine straightening, a smile stretching across her lips as she ponders the negotiation of a lifetime. "A mighty mantle." She grins. "So we will acquire the yurei, and we will speak with the spirits, and we will broker a peace ... or die trying?" She turns to Ramar. "Why not simply ask? He will understand, I think, this notion of brokering a peace. Did he not try to broker one himself? If we use the yurei here, in his stronghold, he will not doubt our actions."

Chi-Yosh turns to Marina. "Goran has been betrayed once for giving the secret of _yurei_ out. That is what started this war. All of Korad called the spirits down on Syllum because of it's theft. Goran will not be so welcome to outsiders using their sacred drink now. He is suspicious, even of us. I would like to ask him myself. There is much that can be learned from _yurei_. I would like to look at it, and see what other uses can be drawn from it. But by Goran's permission alone."

"Which is why we must be certain of the best way to ask. He is intelligent, and though he may trust us, we do not know how far he trusts us. I believe he will be helpful, but there is no harm in excercising cautiong.. is there?" Ramar's voice is curious, and he nods towards Chi-Yosh, agreeing with him.

Marina nods at Chi-Yosh. "Certainly; I am not proposing we use it without his permission. But already he has let us use it once, under his supervision." She raises an eyebrow. "Do you see why I do not anticipate his refusal if the request is well worded? Although I would request merely the extract, not the plant, until after the peace is concluded."

Davron rubs his chin quietly, and nods to his companion. "Well spoken, Chi-Yosh. But not only that - that betrayal still rankles Goran, I have no doubt. Even if we secure a peace between the spirits, there would still be war between Syllum and Korad - either another weather war, or a more mundane one. We must secure some manner of peace between men as well - and the men named Goran and Chirog are the keys to that peace."

Marina looks at Davron. "Perhaps. I can see other keys, also. Longer lasting keys. Chirog would be more of an obstruction, I think." She sighs. "I wish we knew how, and why, Chirog thinks he's helping Syllum. I wonder if someone, somehow, has found a way to subvert the oath Chirog has sworn on the sword."

Considering this, Chi-Yosh nods. "It would be best that all the waters are calm between Syllum and Korad before there is any taking of the _yurei_ plant. But the use may not be so restricted." He frowns. "We must speak to Chirog, and the council. If we can get the Ministers to seek appeasing the betrayel of Goran, and have them agree that Goran ruling Korad would not only benefit Syllum, but would appease him, and stop the Weather War... then perhaps all would be well."

Davron nods to Marina. "I did not say they would both be _part_ of that peace. But whether Chirog is an ally or a foe of the peace, he must be dealt with in some manner. Myself, I would know why he chose not to give Goran the assistance he promised." He looks at Marina. "Your question and mine have answers that are known to only one man. I think we - and you, especially - may need to speak with him to find those answers."

Marina nods at Chi-Yosh. "Yes, but before we address the Council, I would like to speak with Chirog privately." She smiles, wryly. "I foresee a lot of talking. To Chirog, to the spirits, to Goran. Perhaps if we ask Goran first, about the oaths, and then beard Chirog in his den?" She looks up at the ceiling. "We should not speak to the spirits until ... until we know more."

"Well then it's settled. It's simply a matter of talking to those whom we need to speak with." He ponders Marina, "And why not? If we learn from the spirits now, we can find out more than Goran and Chirog know. We can find information that can be used to... neard Chirog in his den, among other things." Ramar leans back, curiously, wondering, "What more would you know before speaking and learning from the spirits?"

Looking at Ramar, Marina narrows her eyes. "I would know their oaths and bindings, I would know their pledges of loyalty, I would know their very reasons for beings. Spirits are **bound** by their oaths; their words are sacrosanct." She pauses a moment, letting that sink in. "We Men, by our very nature, cannot be fettered by our oaths alone, might magical swords notwithstanding. But the converse of that is that, when we speak with the Spirits, we must use our words like arrows, and shoot them accurately. A missed word diminishes us, and soon we will no longer be regarded; I would prefer to avoid being ignored by the spirits. Wouldn't you?"

"That we might." Ramar idly regards the narrowed eyes, for neither the first, nor the last time. "However, who would know their very oaths and pledges of loyalty? All of those who would remember such things would have used such knowledge by now... or rather they should have, from what we know. Who better to know by what the Spirits are bound, than the spirits themselves. Why shall we have to use our words as weapons, when what we need is simply to learn from them? To take from them, the truths from the past?"

"To take, Ramar, is a verb of violence. We can request, if that. But spirits see these oaths as iron fetters; if we Men have forgotten how the fetters are shaped, the Spirits will not be quick to enlighten us. What Man, freed from bondage, hands the means to enslave him to his former captors? What spirit would do similarly." Marina waves a hand in the direction of the camp. "Goran himself leads a rebellion against the fetters of his gods. If we ask, we make only targets of ourselves." She shrugs. "Better to ask those who would not wish to see the fetters destroyed."

"And there might be those amongst mortal men who would know some of what the spirits otherwise keep hidden. As I'm sure Marina could tell you, every little bit of knowledge helps, and if you know it _before_ you begin negotiating, so much the better." He chuckles. "Of course, the mortal who would know the most of Syllum's spirits is none other than Councillor Wulfham himself. So if we seek that knowledge, we face the risks of confronting a _second_ minister..." He nods to Marina. "Of course, I may seek what knowledge I can in the libraries of Syllum - but we sought knowledge of the spirits there before, and learned little. I doubt I will learn much more from a second visit."

Chi-Yosh thinks. He finds it refreshing that the spirits live by their word. Where Man may forget honor, or may only try to emulate it, the Spirit's honor of it's word is a requirement. But it is their nature, not their choice. He glances back and forth. "Would it not work to ask one spirit what the oaths another is bound by?"

Marina smiles at Chi-Yosh. "Certainly; but how do we keep the spirits from comparing notes? After which they - if we agree that they are intelligent to a pose - will clam up." She shrugs. "Better to learn as much as we can, and then speak to the spirits? Since we seem to agree that we will speak to both Goran and chirog, at the least, as well as the spirits, why not speak with the Men first?"

"And then there are those spirits who exist solely to act as deceivers and whose truth is the truth of the lie. We could argue back and forth for ages on this matter. I am simply wondering, that if the Korad make use of the _Yurei_ to learn the wishes of Gaulderak, perhaps we might use it to gain similar information. Or more. But then, if no one is willing to try such a task..." Ramar shrugs, and bows, admitting defeat to Marina.

Ramar says, "Perhaps I am the one being unwise. Such an occurrence is not unheard of, though hopefully infrequent."

"I am perfectly willing to attempt that task, Ramar ..." Marina pauses, her voice cold. "**When** my quiver is filled, and my bow is strung."

Ramar smiles a warm smile. "Of course. You are absolutely correct Marina and I thank you for helping me to see through the foolishness of my viewpoint. I admit, though, that I am not the most qualified to deal with spirits. I shall do my best to assist you in gathering your arrows."

Marina smiles back at Ramar, relief visible in her eyes. "Ah well. First we shall brave Goran; we must needs discover what his price for peace would be." She bites her lip. "Did you hear of the King's heir? What manner of girl is she?"

Chi-Yosh watches Marina, and can merely smile to himself. It is not a happy smile, perhaps one of rueful memory. So much like what he is accustomed to, yet so much that he is not. There are echos of his culture in the diplomat, or rather, reflections from a pool. But there is much difference, between the watery surface and the person. It all drives the point further that he will have to return to the area, atleast. With her in tow? With any of them? The thought earns a stoic, almost dark expression across his face.

It develops that the daughter of the house of Malseyn is six years of age, and already precocious. She takes her training from the academics and scholars who attend the house, and her poetry has even received publication in the library - vetted by a librarian who shows no political favoritism. She is also, as it turns out, engaged to be married to the scion of a man named Gauss. This Gauss is, by all accounts, the "Guild's man" in Syllum, and from the experiences of Ramar and Marina, who have dealt with the Guild before, its political ambitions in the Hundred Kingdoms are merely conduits to more jade. Gauss may or may not present an obstacle.

Marina looks troubled. Young is good. Precocious is good. Previously engaged is ... unfortunate.

Ramar informs Marina of the situation regarding the princess of Syllum, before pondering, "There is probably something to do here. The 'Guild's Man' as it is... well he is for sale... as are many of their members..."

Looking at the three young men, Marina voices her thoughts. "This Gauss; perhaps his withdrawal can be purchased. Ramar; you have guild experience; perhaps you can find his price without increasing that price by giving offense?"

The smile plays about Ramar's face, turning towards mischevious ends and then darting back at tthe last second. "Indeed. I believe I can. His withdrawal can be arranged, and, Marina, I should like to note that I do believe I am capable of not offending everyone I speak to. I should hope I've demonstrated such by now, or we are, in fact, in trouble."

As Ramar speaks, almost a dozen spear-points are levelled at the necks of the four Solars. The Syllan soldiers have entered the dwelling quietly.

"I couldn't help but overhear some of what you were talking about," says Lev, the leader of the detachment, from the doorway. "The princess.. the Korad tribes here... Just what are you people planning?" he demands, in the tone of an angry and confused man. He continues, almost immediately, in a more guilty voice. "I... I was ordered to spy on you, but... I didn't understand why... and you can't be plotting treason against Syllum, but.. if you somehow betray us, we... Curse it! Why did this have to happen!" He snarls, and the soldiers withdraw after a moment. "Our messenger came back. We're still with you until the end, Marina, Chi-Yosh, but.. ...... we trust you." The last is spoken in a softer, muddled tone of voice, and Lev and his men withdraw. "I promise you privacy now. I'm sorry."

Stalking out of the room, hands on her hip, Marina follows Lev, catching his shoulder moments after he withdraws. "Lev. Hold up." She places her other hand on his other shoulder, turning him around to face her. Looking at her troubled expression, her lips curve for a moment in what might be a smile. "We plot no treason, and we will not harm the princess." She turns a little, nodding at the campsite. "But Goran seeks peace. And since time immemorial, peace has been sealed with a royal wedding. What better wedding than one which is still a decade in the future?" She grips his shoulders tighter. "It will give both sides time to prove themselves, and it will establish tighter bonds once the peace is true. And above all, Lev, it is _only a possibility we were discussing_. Peace has a price."

The soldier hangs his head, nodding slowly. "Heaven will enforce the oath you took, I'm told, so... I have no choice but to trust you. We'll be waiting to follow you, when you leave," he adds, smiling nervously, still uncertain of what to think or do, but knowing at least his soldier's instincts - to guard those who are striving for the goals he fights for.

Hands gripping his shoulders a moment longer, Marina nods. "Thank you. We are, and I swear this to you personally, Lev. We are both on the same side. We both seek peace between the Korad and Syllum, and an end to the rain. I seek a peace that will last for generations, though, and not a single season. Like a loan, the length of the peace will affect its price."

Ramar does his best, to keep a straight face, at the timing of the soldires. He nods, simply, agreeing almost silently with Marina. He looks... somewhere between amused and sheepish, perhaps a little to the side of embarassed as well. "Thank you, Marina, for settling that. I should, perhaps, in the future, refrain from opening my big mouth?"

Stepping back inside the room, and listening to Ramar's apology, Marina winces. "Yes. Please."

Chi-Yosh smiles towards Ramar. "A man with his mouth open often has a chance to collect flies."

Ramar says, "Or feet, as it were. However, I have come to be of the opinion that at many times during the course of one's life, the case of foot in mouth is bound to happen, so perhaps it is simply best to enjoy such times when they occur. You have to admit, the soldiers' have impeccable timing."

Davron rubs his throat as his heart settles down again. "It's good to remember that we're not the only ones with a stake in this." He looks up at Marina, with a slight grin. "As to what we were talking about before... what if _Goran's_ heart already belongs to another?"

Marina smiles at Davron. "It doesn't. He has been too busy trying to mold his tribe to form a permanent attachment. I did think to ask."

Chi-Yosh stands. "Let us speak to Goran, then. Patience is a matter of importance, but time is not what the lands being washed away have right now."

Goran is at rest in his own home. This is the first time for any of the diplomatic envoys to actually enter this dwelling, which is buried in the earth and carved between the winding roots of the largest tree in the village. The recognition of the giant's unique situation becomes immediately obvious - cot, table, chair, cook-pot, and assorted knick-knacks are all scaled accordingly. The only thing of mortal scale in the room is a large iron chest in one corner. Goran himself is reading, nestled in his chair and perusing a scroll, obviously borrowed from somewhere. It's a strange sight to watch his enormous fingers, thick as a sword-handle, delicately manipulating the scroll as he reads.

After waiting a moment to catch his attention, Marina steps forward. "Goran, we would speak with you." She looks around, admiring the room for a brief moment. "I was sent, as you know, by the council of Syllum in search of a peace between the watery spirits and the two kingdoms. We have learned much, and we see our way closer to offering a possible solution, but we have questions to ask of you, too." She smiles. "We have heard of your grievances, but we have not spoken on the ways that a truce would be acceptable."

The giant nods, pushing away his scroll for the moment. "Speak."

Marina says, "As emissaries of peace, our first responsibility is to discuss with you possible peace terms. The Council, including Chirog, sent me to negotiate. I am come offering their aid. They need a single leader to negotiate with, and you at least will speak with us."

"If I agree to this, the other tribes will listen to me," says Goran, slowly. "No chief wants trouble from outsider kingdoms here, once justice is found. They agree on this, at least."

Marina nods slowly. "So the question is one of justice." She pauses a moment. "So I ask, Goran, what would constitute justice?"

Frowning, the chieftain considers this. "Chirog. He must return what was stolen. Or he must send the aid he promised. He is a treacherous man, but even oathbreakers may keep some promises."

Marina nods again. "I have to ask, Goran, for oaths bind men too ... What oath, exactly, did Chirog make?" She holds up a hand. "For certain oaths he could not make, and others would leave him forsworn and dead." She runs a hand across her chest, feeling the phantom wound. "The king of Syllum bears a great, magical sword that enforces its oaths with a heavy hand. Did he break that oath, Chirog would now be dead many times over."

Again Goran considers. "He wished to know the secrets of the herbs of the Korad lands. He knew of _yurei_ before he entered my lands. He told me that men loyal to Syllum could be persuaded to further my ambition. He promised that he would speak to the Minister of War, who he claimed governed the armies."

Marina nods again, slowly. "So he promised to bespeak the Minister of War, and request armies, rather than promising the armies themselves?" She looks troubled. "That would satisfy his oaths to the Council, but would leave you hanging high and dry even after he fulfilled the letter of his promise to you."

It is at this point that Goran gives Marina a look, accompanied by no plain speech, whose meaning is writ clearly enough to shine like an angry fire: _That he betrayed me is evident, woman. Are you here to marvel at his technique?_ He says nothing, though.

Marina sighs wistfully, clearly catching the meaning of Goran's look, bright as it shines. "Goran; I agree that Chirog acted like a rogue, a man not to be trusted, a man who treats oaths as contracts between adversaries, and not as agreements between honourable men." She steps forward, placing one hand on the table. "But we come, now, at the behest of the entire council, of which Chirog is a member." She looks straight at him, trying to impress him. "We are not, the four of us, an army. But we are not weaklings either. Our mission is to make the peace. If the price of that peace is the destruction of Gaulderak, then we are willing to consider that term." She takes a half step back. "I have seen how your tribe lives, Goran, and I have seen the lives of the others. I will always favour the leader who seeks to bring his people out of bondage, rather than the leader who keeps his people subordinate to capriciousness."

Goran laughs, after a moment of thought. He laughs again, the sound echoing through the room and nearly rattling the furniture. It contains no trace of scorn, only evident amusement. "You... You propose yourselves as Chirog's aid?" he asks. Then his laughter fades, replaced by a solemn thoughtfulness. "Very well. I accept," he says, rising to his full stature and casting a shadow over almost the entire party. "Chirog has appeased me. And now you must appease him, it seems."

Marina smiles at Goran's first reaction. "We accept. I take it that you will be satisfied with the weakening of Gaulderak?" She turns to look at the men behind her, gauging their reactions, before turning back. "And if yes, then there are other questions we would ask of you. Things we must learn."

"It is a step," he says. "If you can begin it, I can finish it. Ask what you will, I will answer."

"The spirits are bound by oaths; Gaulderak and the spirits he rules. We would know what these oaths are. Perhaps we can weaken the ones binding them to Gaulderak." Marina looks thoughtful. "In short, we must learn what we can of the spirits. In that sense, we also request access to yurei, or at least to the extract that will let us communicate with the spirits." She smiles drily. "Already, one spirit has suggested that we may be able to broke a peace between the spirits of Korad and Syllum."

"Va is keeper of the _yurei_," replies Goran. "Of spirits and oaths, I cannot help you easily; our tribe is still bound strongly enough by Gaulderak that the spirits do not divulge their vows, even with the blossom." Satisfied, the Solars take their leave of the big man. Va is in her hut, perched amidst tree branches, and she greets the four as they climb up. "Young Goran said to prepare more of the holy blossom," the woman says amicably. She offers four stitched leather wine-skins, rough and crude of workmanship, but reliable. "The essence. You must drink it when ready."

Chi-Yosh takes the initiative, and collects the wineskins. "Thank you, wise Va, keeper of _yurei_." He takes care in placing the skins in a pack. A turn to her. "The _yurei_ is sacred with your people. But has any other medicines or mixes been made, or tried, with the blossom?"

"It is said that Kor knew all uses for the blossom," the woman says, smiling. "He told that knowledge to those he trusted, those who followed him. Each of the tribes of the Korad was entrusted with one of its secrets. Those tribes who are fused from many others, as the spirits will do, pool their secrets. Those tribes who split took their secrets together. None of us alone know them all," she remarks.

"Yet together..." Ramar lets his voice end, an intriguing thought occuring to him just then. "Perhaps, the hold that the spirits have, perhaps it is somehow tied in with one of the other uses of _yurei_... either way, we shall have to see what can be learned."

Chi-Yosh nods his head to this, and considers. If this is true, then there are many secrets. And thus taking the plant and trying to discover them may be inadvertantly robbing the other tribes of their secrets. On the other hand... if the blossom is openly offered, then it may be a welcome to discover those secrets, since it is permitted to be observed. A thankful nod of his head. "Your wisdom is appreciated, Va."

With the skins safely stowed, the group makes rendezvous with Lev and his soldiers, and after every assurance, and not a few reassurances, that the group is returning to the Council peaceably to report, the red-robed guardsmen of Syllum take up their escort positions. The trip south is uneventful, at first; upon approach to the border of Syllum, however, Lev advises the company to take a detour. Smoke is rising from a mountain outpost, and the soldier translates its meaning: "enemy soldiers are afoot." However, no difficultie are encountered, and after two days of restful travel, with a merciful relief from the rain, the party returns to the capital.
