In the days following Ramar's return to Syllum, the wandering Solar had spent some time following his soon to be new acquaintance. _Observe those with whom you will deal... only a fool attempts something blindly._ He'd been waiting for a while, intrigued by the mansion and those who dared to venture within. _Yet how often are we fools in life?_ A slow smile creeps about his face as he melds with the populace, a face walking down the street here, a shadowed observer, taking solace from the rain under nearby awnings there... learning, noting whom has come and who has gone. _Three messengers, and one sent. Likely as not more Guild business. They'll be angry, no doubt... this... war, if it can be called such, is bad for business._

_Well... I doubt I can learn more without speaking to the man himself... now, to gain an audience._ As the rain falls around Ramar, he strides confidently towards the entrance of the mansion. He looks up, smirking slightly as a stray thought plays across his mind. _Imposing... almost... an interesting way to use space._ He then makes his way along the steps, pausing as he's approached by the guards. "Good afternoon, I should like to be let in, if I might. I'm interested in making a business proposal to the Guildsman."

The two guardsmen, dressed in conventional armor rather than the robes of the Syllum military, nod to each other. One jerks his head and begins walking forward, while the other eyes Ramar curiously as he passes. Through the mansion the two men walk, past the stone walls and floral decorations that Ramar has come to recognize as traditional Syllan architecture.

The Recreation Chamber is a world apart from the rest of the mansion, and with good reason. Though the hybrid of stone construction and floral artistry predominates through the rest of the structure, this room is decorated with the exotic splendors of the far-off Blessed Realm. Woven tapestries, brilliantly dyed, depict scenes of distant lands and beautiful female (or male) figures, sometimes with the features of animals. Overhead, a glass ceiling filters light downward into the numerous bowls and basins of water that reflect it in an assortment of colors. Even in the rain some light shows through.

At the center of the Chamber are two girls, robed and veiled, both professional dancers of no more than thirteen summers. The dance they perform is a millennium old, and their music-guided motions are graceful and practiced. Watching them are a handful of men and women, some studying the dance, others occupied with scrolls and viands spread out before them on low tables. Half-clad servants stand silently ready, unobtrusive in the shadows cast by artfully-positioned stone columns.

Gauss himself reclines on one of the divans that line the walls. It could not be strictly said that the man rests; even in his seemingly languid pose, he seems alive and active. His hair is done in the fashion of the men of the Eastern Guild: a bowl haircut, shaved in the back, with thick sideburns, leading down to a pointy goatee and mustache. Breeches, closed at the knee and worn over hose, are dyed a dark blue, and likewise his "daleron", or gentleman's jacket, with itslong tails and short sleeves. His linen shirt is immaculately clean, a fact which sets him noticeably apart from his guests.

Alerted to the presence at the door, Gauss rises even before a servant discreetly approaches him to convey news of guests. He smiles and walks around the circumference of the Recreation Chamber, waving a hand to the dancers and musicians to continue their performance. "What may I do for you, sir?" he asks calmly, after casual greetings are exchanged.

"Grant me the pleasure of an audience and a chance to discuss matters of business, if you would be so kind. I should hope it is not a terrible imposition, but a thought had occurred to me, and as you are the Guild's contact in these... distant lands, I thought you should be the one with whom to speak." Ramar's head bows respectfully to the fellow, while glancing briefly about the room. The dancers and musicians captivate his attention for a moment, and then he adds, "However I would not seek to bring an early end to your entertaining." As he speaks, Ramar's ears perk, hearing, the sultry tones of the music that guide the dancers along their millennia old dance. The rythyms and patterns therein become apparent, and soon, aided by the flow and ebb of Essence, his eyes become wiser, more observant. Every mannerism noted and analyzed, the more important aspects brought to the forefront of hi smind by those dancing, if invisible motes.

"'The leaves of autumn are not beautiful until the firewood for winter has been gathered,'" quotes Gauss, smiling. "Come, come, let's drink and speak." He leads the way back toward the divans, clearing out a space for his guest to sit.

Smiling, "Ah, an interesting quote. I believe I've read that before, though the name of it's author escapes me at the moment." Ramar nearly glides along the floor, following after Gauss while keeping an interested eye on the goings on around him. He settles comfortably on one of the Divans, turning to look at Gauss. "So... shall we spend time on small talk or simply get down to business, as it were? Either one is fine with me, as I'm curious about the music, yet as I've said I'd rather not waste your time if you consider such a thing to be a waste."

Gauss gestures curtly, though he still manages the sort of smile that only a top-drawer diplomat can achieve. "Firewood, my dear sir, firewood."

"Of course of course." Ramar sits up then, his posture becoming more serious, more businesslike. A simple straightening of the legs before they are folded underneath him indicates, to Ramar at least, his readiness to deal with the man. "I must start, by asking you a question... I presume you have been taking steps to secure your position within the Guild, even during these troubled times... I wonder if you've prepared actions for when the weather war ends?"

"Secure my position?" laughs Gauss. "I am quite secure, sir, as you can see." And with this he gestures about him, indicating the mansion as a whole. "As to if or when that unfortunate business should find itself concluded, I am quite sure there'll be a need to replace much of what was damaged or water-logged."

"Of course, of course. However, what more will you do? Replacements will be... lucrative, yet temporary. It has occurred to me that such an opportunity can be taken advantage of... but what of plans to secure your wealth for the long-term?"

The man's eyes light up; it's clear that he's realized the true nature of his guest's visit. "You refer to my son, of course," he says, in a lowered voice. "He's a fine boy, and I'd have none but the best for him when he marries." Gauss smiles casually. "You have the accent of the Southlands in you but you dress like a man of this kingdom," he says, after a moment. "What is it you are here for?"

"I do indeed. I am here, as I've said, to offer you something. A way to procure both the wealth and power you might gain, though perhaps one which is more... lasting. One which would help the cause of the GUild along as well as grant you more... freedoms with the wealth you'd acquire. For your own self and your son." Ramar ponders the man, letting his senses take in the expert merchant's tone as he speaks, as well as his body language and facial expressions.

Gauss nods, all business now, voice quiet. "Make your offer then, if you please. I am most curious, now."

"It occurs to me, that as a result of this war... there will be changes. Both here and in the lands belonging to the Korad. The Barbarians. Peace will be wrought, of that you can be assured, in one way or another. A war like this can only cause The Guild to lose money, and it is likely that they will step in if nothing else, though I have seen and heard rumors of people seeking to bring this war to an end. It also occurs to me, that if and when this unpleasant business comes to a close, both sides will be... needing resources. Syllum, Syllum is more civilized, more industrial if that can be said, than the barbarians. It seems, that if one were able to maneuver properly, through the arenas of both the Guild and the Barbarians... that it might be rather easy to set oneself up as a liason to and from the Guild for these... barbarians... barbarians who will be eager to crawl their way up to the state of a more modern nation... who would be all too willing to make purchases from the Guild..." or at least, fr

Ramar continues, the offer now lain out for the Guildsman to see, the hook sweetened with the ripe wriggling of the worm of profit... "Or at least, from their agent among them, one whom they considered trustworthy..."

Gauss nods. "Syllum, of course, is a case I understand entirely," he replies, more casually, and from his tone of voice he makes it clear that the kingdom's commercial needs are well in hand as far as he's concerned. "But... those tribesmen of the north? A kingdom of their own? Unheard of." He gestures to one of the half-concealed servants, who steps forward and leans over. Gauss whispers for several seconds in his ear, then dispatches the man. Returning his attention to his guest, the Guildsman smiles. "You promise summer's harvest while it's yet spring, my friend," he says, "but let us see what the future holds. And while we wait for that season to pass, what of your needs?" This is, of course, another way of saying 'and what is in it for you?'

The response was to be expected. At least the one that Gauss is sure Ramar's heard. Ramar takes it in stride, "Well everything has it's price, I suppose the most readily apparent boon to me is the aid of one whom has been helped to rise in station... there is also the matter of your son. It seems to me, that for the more ideal peace to be reached, a marriage between the barbarians and the people of Syllum, at least symbolically to... appease the spirits, as it were. It is all too likely, that the arrangement will have to be broken."

Gauss's eyebrows shoot up at this. He blinks a few times, apparently caught a little off guard. "M-marry? The barbarians, and... the princess?" he chokes, showing surprise for the first time. "Sir, are you quite sure you're feeling all right?" The man reaches for a cup of wine and downs it, while a few of his guests peek over in his direction curiously.

_Hmmm. He clearly was not expecting this. Caught off guard. These next few moments are crucial._ "Indeed," says Ramar, ready to offer aid to the fellow should it be required, as he prepares to make his move. "It's a simple matter really. The spirits fight on behalf of the two realms, it matters little who started it nor does it matter who will finish it, only that it is finished. Peace is the likely prospect, given certain information... and this way seems to be one of the best ways to achieve such a thing. It is in this manner, that you could move in and seize your powers, while they struggle. If you have reason to doubt my sanity or honesty... which I would understand, then by all means, please allow me to know how I might assuage your fears..."

Gauss's eyes narrow a little, but his voice resumes its accustomed tone of sociability. "It is clear, sir, that you know more than you reveal. Will you not return here in seven days, when we can speak more plainly with each other?"

"Of course sir. I shall return here when you've learned more, and when the seven days have passed. Should you have need of me in that time, I may be difficult to reach, but a message can be left for me with the innkeeper here." Ramar then allows a small smile, "I do hope that in seven days, we might come to a profitable agreement, on both sides."

With a brief pause to gauge this man's attitude towards his continued presence, Ramar then turns, and takes his leave of Gauss, leaving him to wonder and scheme. _He has taken the bait, but there will be more to come later. His proof might be more... difficult to come by than ours... nonetheless... perhaps some of my comrades can understand the cryptic message he left with his servant..._ Ramar walks slowly out, taking the time to enjoy the dances and the company of the other guests. The leaves of autumn can begin to be seen as beautiful.

While elsewhere diplomacy is being crafted by those with tongues like spiders, a different sort of negotiations is being held. Not in a court or hearing room, a place of business, but in the open air, where twilight rests against the weight of the God, his presence receeding away first beneath the trees, leaving them a darkness that spreads across the land. Above the trees, upon a curved slope in the mountains, is a small flat plane, surrounded by the rocks, the natural shrine to Patient Mantis. And here is a lone figure stands, sweat a dew from the condensation of focus and inner exercise.

Patience, serenity, where one should let the mind be a block ice; let it be solid in it's firm decision, before the melting of motion's flow take place. But there in lies the problem; for many actions are reactionary, a counter to something, or not thought through so much as an immediate urge. And while the mind may be calm to the actions of the world when all should be calm, with the fire of action, the taste of danger on the tongue, when speed, quickness, accuracy are a must, one can often not take the time to think before they act; it is instinct, not calculation. And so Chi-Yosh finds his challange in calming his mind, letting that ice stay solid before it melts; his instincts are to flow, to be guided by his body.

It is Patient Mantis's way to, among other things, be patient; it is what the spirit is. And it is good, for Chi-Yosh is not the fastest to grip this technique. There is a quickness inherit in the maneuvers that Patient Mantis has to show, but there is discipline to be learned. The Su'Katan can leap, but his speed lacks the assurance of the mind, the calculation.. And so he repeats it, again, and again. And it begins to try the virtue, but he continues, regardless.

"Move without moving." That is what the spirit commanded. "Move, in your mind. Be aware of the motion of your body. Visualize your body moving. Visualize your attack. Visualize your enemy's block. Try again, this time visualizing your feint, the enemy's failed block, your successful connect... " Patient Mantis teaches that a trained warrior can kill his enemy without moving a finger, if he has killed him in his mind.

A deep breath, one ment to clense, the outward exhale heavy with expelled frustration, distraction. Focus. And he does think, and see. The leap, like he had done on the bridge, but instead of an immediate attack, a pause, to wait for his enemy's return. And that they do, and he ... pauses. A blink, at something. "How do I know what the opponent will do? His point of attack, or if it is random, something I cannot expect?" For a moment, he feels like Ramar, but then he can understand why the Eclipse often waxes with his tongue rather then his mind; he's confused, and merely has a lot of confusion to be relieved.

"You must watch your enemy. You must know him. This is why you do not attack until you are attacked first," the spirit commands, harshly.

"I understand your confusion," Patient Mantis continues. "You have not yet seen that other men seek to kill you in their minds first. The impulse of violence breeds itself in the soul, and flows outward to the body. You must see this flow. You must look for Essence, not fists or feet or swords. Do you understand?"

"I understand," He responds in lenght. Another breath. Once more the effort is put forth, and once more a challange is found. Though, it is slow to acknowledge, it is there, in the back of Chi-Yosh's mind. He finds it so hard to invest his faith in the outcome of the visualisation. That it will go as he sees it. To him, unfailing insurance can be a weakness when it blinds, leaves one weak to the potential of failure. But, for a moment, he lets that fear go, because that may be what is hanging him up. Thus he does, and sees himself int he poise, in the waiting, sees the flowing essence of the oncoming opponent like a rockslide. And he leaps forward, seeing where each rock will come down, and the path of each rock is avoided, or cast aside with the brush of the hand - Patient Mantis had first requested his kamas left aside, and then encorporated. He sees it, and replays it in his mind, before stepping forward, and taking the first few steps, before thighs bunch, and he leaps.

And all goes well. It is not the picture perfect form, but there is a lightness, a sure driving force, like an unchecked wind. The jump is far, farther then it should have been, but not the full potential that could be had. And the hard-worked body flows, moving in the pattern of the image glowing like a silluette against the Sun's presence. Sight is not an issue, seeing the air before him, so much as feeling the motion of each gesture, of the sideward step, of the slight crouch and a broad, overhead sweep to cast aside would would have claimed his head, and then a step back, to the side, a ploise in preperation for the next. The realization that it was successful is slow, a dawning that fills his conciousness.

---

Some of the training has taken place in strong wind, with Patient Mantis observing calmly as Chi-Yosh attacks and parries the boughs and branches of trees at very close range, sensing their relatively predictable Essence and trying hard to avoid getting hit in the head. Now, however, the warrior waits in a clear area within one of the wild forests on the other side of the mountain. After several minutes of breathing exercises, Chi-Yosh rises to his feet. From the forest strides a green-skinned man with insectile eyes and bulging muscles. He's dressed loosely, wearing nothing more than ratty peasant garb, and his feet are bare. "Now, face me," commands Patient Mantis, his familiar voice booming from this muscular, imposing humanoid form.

There is a pause. A moment of surprise, then acceptance. While this is indeed strange, unexpected even, it is understood. Once more comes the breathing, and he pushes the doubt and hesitation from his form like a wind blowing away dust. And with that, he approaches Patient Mantis. Not in the burst of airborne countering, but slow, because his opponent has no intent, for the moment. But stopping a meter from the spirit, he takes a stance, and watches, waiting.

The currents of Essence radiating from the spirit are hazy, but detectable. Chi-Yosh's fighting magic has already been tested in the past, honed against the strange creatures of the Eastern forests and the barbarian attackers of Korad, and now he feels the magic again. His head almost turns to watch as Patient Mantis moves left, then crouches and springs forward. But the man hasn't moved. Not even his faint shadow on the ground has wavered. But another shadow, of a kind, moved indeed - the shadow that Patient Mantis casts into the forest warrior's heart. Still the green figure stands motionless.

It is much like being in water with someone else; as they swim, the wake of their movements radiate around them, their motions against the water felt before they are completed. And so it is with the spirit, and he sees it, and can see himself moving, seeing the leap, where it will go, and how he will deal, and how it will be delt with. And like clockwork, the two move together. It is Patient Mantis who goes left, then crouches, and jumps, but it is the Su'Katan who moves right, and darts back, only to jump forward at the descent of the attack. Head ducking downward, elbow jutting up. The spirit's hands clasp upon that elbow, arch over it, as if it were a dance practiced many times over. But something else is added in; Chi-Yosh reaches up, to grab the Mantis's wrist, to draw him down to the ground with him. It was his calculation, his counter, but if the Mantis foresaw it, then it is undone, lest he accept it.

And the battle continued. From the Solar's side, it is not liquid grace and smoothness, there are the rough edges of a block of stone being made into a statue; the shape is there, but not the perfect lines. And for the spirit, he is holding back. Not much, but he is powerful, and his student is merely learning how to walk, not run. And so it goes, until the moon hangs high in the sky.
