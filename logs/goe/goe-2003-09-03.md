It's best, Goran explains, for the meeting of the tribal chieftains to be handled in the heart of the forest. The big man makes it clear that he fully intends to be less than honest with his fellows about his own motives, but that the truth of the weather-war must be told unvarnished, or Gaulderak's influence will not be wielded one inch toward the ending of the eternal rain. And so, backpack and weapons girded, the giant sets off. Va sees him down the Spirit Tracks for a distance, apparently to consult with him about one final matter, then returns and bids the party enjoy the hospitality of the tribe one more time.

It's near dawn of the next day when Goran returns, somewhat bloody, but successful. And he is literally bloody - his skin is lacerated here and there, whether with knives or hooks or some other implement is not clear. He does not speak of the matter, explaining only that the tribes accepted his story and that the spirits will be invoked to call off the attacks on Syllum. At last he submits to Va's insistent demand that he return to his dwelling and be treated. His assent is mild indeed, but the satisfied swagger with which he walks, blood loss or no, is no less grand than that of a king's.

Marina watches Goran disappear into his dwelling, her gaze resting on the wounds on his body. "Perhaps, Chi-Yosh ... you could heal him a little?"

Turning to Marina, Chi-Yosh gives a nod, in a moment of consideration. He seems to have something else on the mind. "Surely." He would offer to use the stone, but from the look of Goran's body, the wounds didn't appear very severe. If so, he'll request it. But he follows the big man into his dwelling.

The inquisitive traveler Ramar follows his Circle-mate into Goran's dwelling, periodically asking questions or lending a hand where he may. Herbs must be gathered, for the tribe's own stock of medicines and other valuable flora are somewhat less than those of most of the Korad.

Meanwhile, the tribe waits through the day, doing less work than usual, fearful of something overhead. They fear a one-sided peace. For no matter what their omens tell them, no matter what assurance is given by a band of strangers from far lands, these men and women have gained some of the farmer's blood in their veins, and in living and dying by the weather, their fears and doubts are rooted deep into their very souls. Those who climb up into the trees, scaling the highest branches, report that the sun is shining. Only after the sun has set, and the day has passed, though, does the tribe truly begin its grand celebration. No rain! No reprisals!

The celebration is taken part by the Su'Katan. Merriment, food, and all the forms of enjoyment partaken. Though, while the Giant Chieftan has settled down for a drink and tales, Chi-Yosh eases up beside him. "Goran?" The man affords. "A request."

"Hmm?" grunts Goran, looking at the smaller man. "Speak."

Chi-Yosh nods. "I wish for a sample of _yurei_." Holding up his hand to ward off any immediate displeased reactions, "I realize that you have been betrayed in the past, and that the blossom is a sacred thing. I will not disrespect it. Va mentioned that other tribes know other secrets of the flower, and I wish to find some of them, or new ones. I know the way of medicines, and I believe that _yurei_ could be helpful, in many ways. I will grow no more then three flowers, and will send word of what I have discovered, if at all, before I proceed. At your permission, future King of Korad," He adds with a pleasant smile.

Goran considers this slowly. "I do not know whether you have been asked this by the men of Syllum," he says at last, "or whether you yourself have thought upon this idea. Come to me again when you prepare to leave these lands, not before. At that time the tribe will have made its decision." He smiles. "I still intend to call upon you for aid in overthrowing Gaulderak. We will speak of these matters again then."

Chi-Yosh nods his head. "Thank you, Goran. I can tell you that I am not on Syllum's side, but I do not know if you will believe me. But understand that I respect your ways, and those goals you hold, and respect _yurei_ as something sacred, and so I ask your permission." He merely gives a polite nod. "When we speak again."

Ramar returns from Gauss's residence, to find his three associates waiting. In brief but exultant phrases he details the outcome with the Guildsman: the engagement between his son and the Syllan heir will be called off, in exchange for an exclusive arrangement with the Korad, in the years to come. Va supplied estimates of the true extent of the tribesmen's population and holdings, and when Gauss was informed of the prospects of having these resources available via a single ruler, his mouth almost visibly watered.

The mansion of the heirs of Malseyn is south of the capital, though not far. One follows the river for a spell, then rides a pole-boat across where the current is weak. The building itself is like many of those seen in Syllum, but distinctly older. The stonework itself is not painted, or sculpted, in floral patterns. Instead, the mansion itself seems to be woven with a tapestry of blooming vines. They grow according to some carefully-arranged pattern, creeping up the walls and fastened invisibly to the architecture.

Inside, the foursome is greeted cordially by the lady of the house - Lady Annelon, the "Shadow Heir" who does not sit on the throne unless an emergency befalls the current king, who is grooming her daughter to be the future queen of Syllum. A brief discussion follows, and the woman's face falls as the terms of the peace are explained to her. Still, she rallies and offers a warm smile. "I had accepted that my daughter was to be given out of duty. If this... Goran... were a cruel man, I think you would not have come here. It is not widely known," she confides, "but marriages born not out of love are a part of this kingdom's history. I will speak to this man, when he comes. I hope that we will.. understand each other."

Smiling, Marina nods. "I had heard such; it is why we had hopes you would accept that part of the treaty. But sometimes ... children are born of that union who are beloved by both. One such, from the earliest days, still lives." She smiles, wistfully. "In a quiet, private place, she lives, and watches, and helped us bring the peace."

"You speak strangely, lady," says Lady Annelon, confused but steadfast. "What child is it that you refer to?"

"From the first leaders of Syllun ... " Marina pauses a moment. "Each of the two leaders married, and not each other, for dynastic purposes. Thus you now have the alternating heirs. But they _did_ give birth to one child, a daughter named Heavenly Aspect, who lives in the hills to this day." Marina looks back at the others. "We met her, and she taught us much. Still she watches this kingdom, though she cannot act directly. But yes, in this kingdom, there were few marriages made for love. Your daughter ... Perhaps your daughter should meet this ancient ancestor?"

The news of an impending Realm invasion force outside the front door couldn't give the Lady more of a shocked expression, but she rallies as best she can, finally nodding her assent. "Come.... come, then," she manages.

Upstairs, young Mallisen is at play in her room. Or more properly, she is being educated by one of the kingdom's scholars, who is teaching her the history of the Scavenger Lands by means of toy soldiers, each brightly and distinctively painted. The door opens just enough to look in, and Lady Annelon wordlessly claims the privilege of first glance. She comes away from the door after several moments, face bright and uncertain. She shows a smile, deep with pride and love, though a frown seems ready to leap onto her features, and two hot tears are forming slowly in her eyes. She turns away, leaving the party alone at the doorway, and walks calmly and properly away down the hall of the mansion, to wait.

Marina steps inside the door, leaving it open behind her, and waits for the scholar to notice her.

Dutiful academic to the last, the woman continues her lesson for a few minutes longer, before smiling and rising. "Lady Mallisen," she murmurs. "You have guests." The young princess nods, rising to her feet and executing a carefully-practiced bow. The scholar herself takes a seat in the far corner of the room and begins to read to herself in silence, clear enough invitation to enter and speak.

Dropping a brief curtsey at the scholar, Marina turns to the princess, before sinking down so that their eyes are at the same level. "Lady Mallisen, I am Marina. These are my friends, Davron, Chi-Yosh, and Ramar." She pauses a moment, letting the princess see each of her companions in turn. "We have come, for now, to invite you to meet a special friend of ours, who is also an ancestress of yours."

"Oh, you..! A nice lady came to me," the girl says cheerfully, lisping only in the slightest. Her voice is rich and textured, showing her tutoring from the earliest age in the art of speaking. "We talked, and I drew this." On paper, spread out before the princess, is a picture of four people, walking and smiling across a mountain-scape. Curiously, though the picture reflects a daytime scene, there is not one sun in the sky, but four, each one over the head of one of the figures. "She said... she said, umm.." The girl bites her bottom lip in the effort of remembrance. "'Great things are in store.'" And with that she beams proudly.

Looking at the picture carefully, Marina looks at each of the figures, and then at the four suns, and then she smiles. "Tell me, Lady Mallisen, of this nice lady?" She looks at the picture again. "She and you must have enjoyed talking; you certainly drew a beautiful picture."

Mallisen puts a finger to her lips and taps it, obviously deep in concentration. "She was here last night. She was very pretty," the young princess recalls at last. "She um, was kind of cold, but warm too.. and she dressed funny, like they did in all my books, many many years ago. She said we were related, and she said she couldn't stay long, but that she wanted to see me.. And she told me that some people had come to talk to her, and I offered to draw them for her.. But she said she couldn't take the picture, so I kept it. She said it was okay."

Marina nods, smiling. "Yes. She is really nice." Marina smiles, looking directly at the young girl. "With your mother's permission, we will take you to meet her properly, if you like. Once your mother has met her, perhaps you can meet more often ..."

"I'd like that," says Mallisen, beaming with happiness, and pride at the compliments to her drawing. She turns to look to her tutor, who bows her head and moves out of the room to speak with Lady Annelon (and also to provide some real privacy). The girl turns back to Marina. "I like you guys," she says, out of the blue, speaking in a less 'noble' manner than she did before - less formal, more friendly.

Marina smiles at the girl. "I'm glad, Lady Mallisen. You're a very nice young girl, too. Well spoken." She smiles, more warmly than she usually does. "Goran will be surprised." She looks over her shoulder at the others. "A surprise that will not harm in the slightest, gentlemen, if we prime the pump a trifle?"

Davron's brow wrinkles in mild confusion, but he nods to Marina, uncertain of his companion's implication but confident in her sense of judgment. "Whatever you think best," he says.

Brows wrinkling, Chi-Yosh regards the little one and Marina. He glancse at the picture she brandishes, but thinks for a moment. Dressed as the women in her books? But Heavenly Aspect doesn't wear clothing... He frowns, but the thought is shattered at Marina's question. "... you are the socialite expert, Marina."

Marina smiles at Chi-Yosh. "High praise, from you." She turns back to the Lady Mallisen. "We will have to ask your mother, but we will introduce you." She stands up, nodding once more at the scholar, before stepping backwards towards the door, lest the girl have questions.

The family is used to making trips up the mountain infrequently, and Lady Annelon and her daughter are escorted by several warriors loyal to the house. Along the way, Mallisen and Ramar get along famously - he loves to question, she loves to answer. It is revealed, for example, that the "nice lady" showed up last night while Mallisen was looking up at the Magic Moon, which was particularly splendid to see. Lady Annelon stiffens a little more at this line of questioning, though she says nothing, apparently out of the belief that her daughter has been involved in something beyond the mortal world. This belief crystallizes when Heavenly Aspect of Water again emerges from her watery home and bows gently, doing honor to the Ladies of the House of Malseyn first, even before acknowledging her four outsider allies. The guards await further down the path; this is no place for them.

Chi-Yosh bows slightly, a welcoming gesture towards Heavenly Aspect, his smile a touch more warm with familiarity and friendship then mere politeness. "Greetings once more, Heavenly Aspect of Water." A gesture towards the Ladies of House Malseyn. "I'm sure you know whom they are. But we thought that young Mallisen might wish to words from you handed to her, things that we and her tutors could merely touch."

The spirit inclines her head softly, smiling at Lady Annelon, whose perpetual look of fear during this trip begins to fade away into understanding, of a sort. "A spirit," she whispers. "I see..." Meanwhile, Mallisen tugs gently on Chi-Yosh's arm. "Thought we could talk to the nice lady. I like her too, but can I see the lady again?" she asks in a quiet voice.

Chi-Yosh opens his mouth, then closes it, not unlike a fish struggling for water in air. He can merely look at Marina, before kneeling down to put eyes level with Mallisen. "Tell me, lady, what did the nice lady that met you Sound like?"

The little girl scratches her head, struggling to explain. Then Heavenly Aspect drifts across the surface of the water, and stretches out a blue hand to touch the girl's shoulder. "I understand," she whispers to the young princess. "Mother came and talked to me last night, too." And with that, the water-spirit begins to tell her tale...

Chi-Yosh sidles towards the others, his tone very low. "In the Keep, the voice who had whispered to me about the Dragon... it was female, and not the same voice as that spirit whom had blessed Davron."

Marina turns to look at Chi-Yosh. Her shoulders straighten a little, and she looks cheerful. "I think Goran ... is in for a bigger surprise than we had anticipated.'"

Davron blinks at Chi-Yosh, and his eyes widen in awe and understanding. "Not the dragon, then, but the Speaker to Dragons..." He smiles, and breathes a sigh of relief. He had worried in his heart how Malseyn would have felt about the Solars' discovery of her study. Now, though, he feels certain that she would approve... indeed, perhaps, _has_ approved.

The story continues, explaining (in terms a child will accept) the nature of the kingdom's founding, and of its founders. Heavenly Aspect holds the attention of her audience of two, her gentle words bringing some visible measure of comfort to Lady Annelon, and rapt attention from Mallisen.

Time passes, and when Heavenly Aspect withdraws from her role as storyteller, and mother and daughter consider. "I... I think this makes it easier," says Annelon at last. "I will speak to this man Goran about these things, when he comes." Mallisen smiles, then, and while her mother is occupied with her thoughts, the girl unclasps her outer robe, and throws herself without reservation into Heavenly Aspect's own pool, wearing her under-robes and cheering gleefully as she enters the water.

---

The Mountain Dragon, whose body is the keep and the ancient stone beneath it, has been visited, and gave Davron what lore it held of Malseyn's journey. It spoke, too, of how to reach its "brothers", other spirits of the land that predate the founding of any kingdom.

The scholar's interest in pursuing the knowledge of magic hinted at in that hidden study in the keep leads him now to the next resting place, and he stands naked in the ford miles south of the capital, where the river runs shallow and slow. The water rushes past his body, chill and potentially deadly should the even current turn into a raging torrent. Thankfully the absence of the rains makes it manageable. And as he waits, the water rises overhead, forming a vague but unmistakeably draconic outline. **Speak your wish, Chosen of the Sun,** the waters rumble.

Davron's voice is steady, even, and yet respectful. "Dragon of the Waters, in the nature that you have named me, I am yet a child. But I stand on the threshold of my adulthood, and I seek my rightful inheritance in the lore and knowledge of my ancestors. I seek knowledge of sorcery, O Dragon. Will you aid me in my search?"

**I will give you the keys, but you must unlock the door,** the sonorous voice proclaims, and a wave rises from the current of the river, a draconic claw of moving river-water. It touches to Davron's forehead, filling his mind again with memories of Malseyn and the dragons and the spirits of the valley, showing him every moment of the experiences. **You will understand the use of of this gift. Go to my brothers.** And then the water comes crashing down, the dragon's shape that lifted itself from the river nothing more than a memory.

Davron closes his eyes as the wave of water passes over him, and takes a deep breath, finally allowing himself to shiver in the water's chill embrace. He makes his way to the river's edge and dries himself off, preparing to continue on his quest.

The dragon of the woodlands is a beast that crawls between the trees at the deepest fringes of the forests that dot Syllum, and it slithers around Davron as he stands waiting with far more grace and stealth than he feels comfortable with. Nevertheless, it is greeted as formally, and it too offers its knowledge to him.

The sky dragon, beaten and bitter from the war of weather with Korad, knows Davron from the negotiations. Of all the dragons seen thusfar, it alone has shown any signs of being active. It blows like a twisting tornado around Davron as he stands atop the highest mountain peak in the kingdom, ravaging his mind with memory. And it too departs, to seek the peace of sleep so long denied it.

The dragon of fire is the most difficult to reach, for it calls upon Davron to light a mighty blaze to call it. As he stands in the darkness of evening, watching a woodpile the size of a small house burning away, the billowing sheets of smoke begin to snake together. The angry red eyes of the dragon of fire confront the seeker, who states his claim just as boldly. The touch of its claws is a hot poker against his forehead, but Davron endures the pain, feeling the warmth of memories beating down his will, flooding into his mind. As the fire extinguishes itself, he slumps to the ground, unconscious.

Chi-Yosh sits at the table for the morning meal, fingering the drawing in his lap. He might as well do it now. As everyone is eating, he begins. "I had a dream. In the dream, there were the jaguar men, whom I had ran from the day you met. We battled. That perhaps is not something important, but..." He removes the paper, unfolding it to bare the mark. "Davron said this is the mark of a Lunar, a No Moon. The barer of this mark told me that I must return to the Maze forest, for the injustice I have done." He takes a pause, to let this injest, before drawing the hearthstone from it's drawstring. "I must go, for what I had done to their manse, to what I had took, for I do not wish to caution what the Lunar may do, even from a distance, if he can enter my dreams. I must go, after we arrive shortly in Nane."

Marina looks up, thoughtfully. "With the Master's permission, perhaps we could join you?"

Chi-Yosh smiles ruefully. "I ... did not wish to ask that, because it will be dangerous, and this is nothing that you must do. But I would welcome all of you who may help me in this cause."

Davron gazes at the Hearthstone thoughtfully, many competing thoughts vying for his attention. One of them wins command of his voice: "You've been an invaluable ally, Chi-Yosh. If you wish our help, you need but ask."

Marina nods. "Indeed. Unlike some ... you know the value of silence." She grins, looking sideways at Ramar. "And wisdom."

"Thank you," He says again, before his expression grows flat. "Realize that this means I will follow you where the problems grow thick like weeds. Not that I would not have before, but I will be eager to repay the token. I owe you nothing, but I wish to offer what I have been given back. We are circle mates. It is as things have been done."

The matter of Goran and Gaulderak has yet to be settled; but, in a sense, the Chosen of the Sun are entirely concerned with the unfinished business of all Creation. Taking time to settle matters with the mysterious Lunar of the East who haunts Chi-Yosh's dreams is another step on that road. The four pay and leave, setting out back for their vessel, and home.
