# Gods of Eden 2003-09-10

The party noted on its Guild-issued map the existence of an odd ruined keep to the east of Syllum itself, and after the quartet's experiences in the abandoned fortress in Syllum's own mountains, a strong case can be made for the prospect of exploring it as well. Although it seems to have no obvious connection to the kingdom or its founders, it's on the way, and a preliminary fly-over shows no sign of habitation or evident danger. The _Seagull_ lands in a clear pool of water deep within the forest, perhaps half a mile from the ruined keep, and the four Solars disembark, wary but curious.

"Ha ha! To the ruins... this is rather exciting, don't you think?" Ramar steps gingerly from the _Seagull_ onto the ground. He looks around the surrounding mountain ranges, and back towards the keep. "Here... I suppose I shall lead the way, though we'd do well to keep our eyes and ears open for anything." With that Ramar makes his way through the forest, staying under the cover of branches, headed for the ruined keep.

Davron smiles slightly. "And stay quiet, lest we alert anything dangerous before we see it," he advises. Although he too finds the ruins fascinating, his own enthusiasm is tempered by the fact that other, possibly dangerous, creatures - or even sapient beings - might previously have been similarly fascinated. And so he proceeds, bow held lightly in one hand.

The keep is clearly built as a defensive fortification. It rises up at the very crown of the low hill that springs up from the forest, and the earth around it remains poisoned for hundreds of yards in every direction, to deny cover to an attacking force. The walls slope gently inward, evidently built with the curious architectural knowledge of an earlier age that compartmentalizes the damage a siege engine can inflict.

The entire ediface is square, forty yards to a side and almost twenty yards in height, marred at intervals only by arrow-slits. No sign of any emplacement for larger arms is visible; either it's rotted away too, or the keep's defenders counted on external allies to break a siege. What must have been a wooden pair of doors has rotted away with time, leaving withered and decayed fragments behind. The interior of the keep is dark, with shadows of fallen rubble visible from outside.

Ramar turns his head from side to side, gazing at the square edifice with an open mouth. The walls slope so oddly... yet... _Fascinating. Perhaps something from..._ Ramar shakes his head, tossing aside an errant thought. He looks again at the arrow slits, and then to the doors, his voice is almost a whisper, "What do you think? Who goes in first?"

Marina smiles, looking at Ramar. "Please. Be my guest. An edifice like that ... almost demands the attentions of one such as you."

Davron raises his bow. "Don't worry, friend. We'll cover you..." A glance at the arrow slits himself. "Whoever once defended this place has long been in the earth... but no telling what else may have taken it over in the ages since."

"I choose to take that as a compliment," replies Ramar, as he strides softly forwards. He pauses a moment, near the rotted remnants of the doors. His nostrils flare slowly, and he bends an ear to the ground, listening to the tales that the land has to say. When he looks up, his eyes have slipped from relying on their own sight to being aided by the ebb and flow of Essence in the area...

The keep is dusty and run-down, though curiously devoid of animal or insect life. Here and there, one can find evidences of some destructive final battle that must have spelled the end of the keep's former inhabitants: broken blades, spears whose wooden shafts are decayed to fine dust, tattered clothes ruined by the passage of centuries. Nowhere are there bodies or remains of any human inhabitant; whatever may have happened here, the victors (or survivors) took every precaution to ward away hungry ghosts by properly burying the dead of this place.

The occupants of the keep are identified as the party finishes canvassing the first floor. Ramar spots an imperishable jade disc, stamped with the heraldry of the Dragon-Blooded Shogunate. If this item marks the historical home of the last living inhabitants of the keep, then this fortification was ruined almost eight centuries ago, perhaps even during the Great Contagion itself.

"Look at this..." Ramar gestures towards the jade disc. "What... that has to be..." he then falls silent, as the realization is too much for even **him** to comment upon.

Marina looks curious, looking at Ramar, and then at the jade disc. "Well ... the good news is that this keep should be abandoned. The bad news, I suppose, is that we should expect a multitude of traps?" She shrugs, inviting Ramar to move forward.

Davron nods slowly. "Such is the way of things..." he says sombrely. "At this age, even many of the traps may have decayed. But not all of them, of course. Let us move on."

Ramar continues his exploration of the ruined edifice. His fingers reach out to trace slowly against the ancient walls, curious as to the feel of stone from the Age before. As he walks, his eyes are ever wandering, waiting to note anything unusual, anything of interest, or danger. His ears, mindful of the sounds and echoes of their own footsteps and inhalations, are ever-alert for what may lie in wait for them. Slowly, hoping to keep from setting off the now-mentioned traps... he heads for the second floor, if nothing remains to be seen on the first.

The central area of the keep seems to be blocked off on all sides by fallen stone, although something seems queer about how the rock has fallen. Almost regular it is, as though some First Age siege weapon or sorcery had been used to obscure passage. The second floor is more promising, and several staircases to reach it have been located.

As the first floor is principally devoid of anything interesting, being apparently reserved for storage rooms and compartmentalized chambers for fighting off attackers, the party slowly ascends to the second floor after studying everything of use on the first.

Looking around, Marina peers in every corner, disturbing the dust after examining the patterns in which the dust had formed. She's particularly intrigued by the rocks. Their fall is so regular, so secretive, so ... tantalizing. Perhaps she should point this out to Ramar? Perhaps. But for now ... better to see if there are more interesting things to look at, first. How often, after all, is a keep abandoned in so orderly a fashion that all the bodies are buried. Surely, someone, somewhere, must have recorded this tale?

Ramar heads up one of the more sturdy looking staircases. He takes a breath before planting his feet on the ancient steps and ascending to the second floor. When he reaches the apex, before stepping out into the open, as it were, he stops and listens, then peers slowly around. "I think it's safe," he whispers...

Following behind the little train - in case the rear need defending - Chi-Yosh observes all with a nod of his head. The layout is smart; minimalizing the chance of invaders clouding the compartmented areas, thusly choking them and offering for better defense. Smart. His eyes sweep to the rockfalls, and it seems suspicious. He infact wants to start moving them aside now, but decides otherwise, as the others continue up the stairwell.

Marina spends much time poking about in the ruins, and in that time the magics that reach out from her touch against everything of even the least significance. And in the study, she learns much. For example, the pattern of fallen weapons, such as spears, reveals the nature of the attacking and defending force. Both were human, or at the very least bore human weapons and fought as men would. The defenders were considerably equipped, but fewer in number; the spear-heads are of an old forge, but the wood that was gathered to make them came from the nearby forests. No army marched here; the attack was begun here, and ended here.

The technique of the crafting is considerable, though done in an almost alien fashion, as though a great master of the art were tutoring a thoughtless pupil in the ways of war. The workmanship becomes plain after a few minutes of deep consideration. It is that of the Fair Folk, whose crafts Marina has encountered in passing in her negotiating days. Some of the Fae must have educated men in the making of arms, and then perhaps led an assault here, at the height of the Great Contagion.

Whatever evidence of a concerted search might have once existed is long gone; perhaps something on the higher floors may yield results. Of note, however, is the existence of more rubble blocking access to the center of the keep itself. Only one staircase exists in good enough condition to provide access to the third floor; from examination of the rubble, it must either be capped there, or possibly open.

Ramar looks about carefully, taking even greater care now that more of the nature of the attack and the involvement of the Fae has been taken into account. "This way," he says, before ascending the last remaining staircase. He'll work his way slowly up the steps, mindful of any traps or treachery that men or Fae alike may have left, his hands cupped around an ear to listen for sounds of wind passing by over head... in an attempt to determine what lays in wait for them up this last staircase.

Chi-Yosh frowns. Fair Folk. He's learned enough to be on his toes and wary whenever the potential for their involvement is high. Hands rest upon the hafts of his weapons, and while yet drawn, can be ready at a breath.

The third floor is much taller than the others; over six yards in height, it's at least as high itself as the lower floors combined. This is where the command of the keep began, and anticipation of the threat is clear: the three remaining pieces of furnishings in the room are all cast from 'cold iron'. One is a locked security-box, and the other two are large cabinets in which the scrolls and ledgers of the fortress commander and his staff would be kept. They appear to be sealed still. Also of note is a large iron plate affixed to the top of the rubble, near the center of the keep, and some distance away. The rest of this floor's details are of a similar nature as those found below.

It's worth noting that spears and other "mortal" weapons cannot be seen here; no sign of active warfare is present. If the battle reached this level, evidently somebody took enormous precautions to hide all trace of it, but it seems as though this floor was spared the ravages of those below.

"Cold iron?" Ramar frowns thoughtfully. "Is that not what they use to ward away the Fair Folk? And... that this place is spared the battle below..." He looks around again. "No, something is not quite right here. Be ever wary, yet we may find more clues as to what precisely has transpired here within the cabinets and the security-boxes..."

Davron taps his chin. "This _is_ curious," he says. "Surely the human attackers would've looted all this if they'd gotten this far - unless their fae commanders prevented them. But in that case, surely the fae could _order_ their human followers to remove what they themselves could not touch..."

Marina smiles at Ramar. "Wariness is called for." She looks again at the iron. "Still, the Cold Iron can't harm us. Perhaps ... " She looks around carefully, trying to ascertain the purpose of these artefacts. She would rather not touch them before she knows the dangers involved, but in time, if nothing comes to mind, she will try to open the cabinet.

Chi-Yosh looks over the room, and frowns deeply. Turning to Davron, "You are aware of the flows of Essence, yes? Of sorcery?" A gesture to the box and shelf. "Could there be some magics on these? Keep them protected and harm someone? So that the human servants wouldn't touch - or had and were carried away?"

Davron nods, extending his senses even as he continues his train of thought. "Indeed... whatever the details, the commanders must have at least had some time to defend what was important." He scratches his head. "Perhaps the defenders even _won_, but in too small numbers to survive another assault; so they sealed these places, buried their dead, and abandoned the keep..."

There is the persistent prickling of one's neck-hairs as the Solars approach the strong-box and cabinets, and each recognizes the presence of magic. But the nature of that sorcery is obvious to all but Chi-Yosh: it is enchantment designed to ward off any who do not owe their allegiance to the gods. This magic would bar approach to anyone who was not Dragon-Blooded. Or, in this case, Chosen of the Sun. The strong-box is locked, but the cabinets are not.

"Perhaps..." Ramar says, as he glances about from item to item, "The Dragon-Blooded had made a final stand in here, keeping the men away? Or they..." He shakes his head. "They had to have escaped." Without saying anything further, Ramar proceeds to the security box, examining it a moment before attempting to open it.

The iron plate says one thing, and one thing only: "Ware The Regent"

Inside the cabinets are what one would expect to find - papers and other records of the keep, preserved over the centuries, perhaps by the uncanny magic that protects these vital sources of information. They describe one of the outlying fortifications of the Shogunate of ancient times - principals in the chain of command, dispositions of men and materiel, recent orders. The keep was one of the innumerable small defensive outposts of the Shogunate, supported by the empire's limitless command over the bread-basket of Creation here in the East.

Ramar looks about curiously. "Ware the Regent?" He blinks. "Oh dear. I hope that we do not..." He then utters a sharp oath as he fiddles with the lock. "**Blight.** I can't open it... lets see if we can find some keys... or I shall try to open it with stone..."

Marina looks up from the papers. "Hold on, Ramar. Don't use a stone just yet." She looks back down at the papers, knowing that in records nuggets of information are often hidden accidentally. "First, let us discover who this regent is that we should ware of." She begins to carefully examine the papers, placing the interesting ones in one pile, still in the cabinet, and the others in a second smaller pile.

Davron frowns at Ramar. "I would be loath to damage this, just because we lack the wit to open it any other way." He puts his hand on the side and drums his fingers. "And we should find it hard to carry off, even with all of us lifting."

Looking over the stones, then the iron box, Chi-Yosh considers. He can tell that it's safe to open and touch such things; the others are doing it, so the magic must be of some benevolence. A glance to Marina, but then back the way they had entered. "Maybe the answers are also behind the layed stones blocking off the rest of the keep."

Davron nods to the plate. "I think we should find it easiest to gain access to it by removing that plate. Shall we give it a try?" he says, flexing his fingers.

Ramar nods, "Or it could be that we can access what lay within the center of the chamber after opening the box. Yet, I shall lend my assitance where it is needed." He moves to aid Davron in removing it, stretching his arms before putting them to good use.

Marina's reading of the paperwork indicates that the keep was the last defensive position for the Shogunate's forces on this side of the mountain; the abandoned fortifications in Syllum's mountains were the next part of the chain. There are no specific orders that give hints as to any special function the place served; soldiers would withdraw to it if attacked en masse and an organized retreat across the mountains was not immediately feasible. There are records of messengers coming from the East with word of the Fair Folk invasion; preparations were apparently begun immediately to deal with the threat.

Finally, something of interest: the abandonment of the keep, paperwork hastily filed beneath some other reports and concealed clumsily. "We leave this blasted keep and the Regent to their fates, and seek passage West, to our home. We will face the justice of a tribunal if this is seen as a defeat, but for the six of us, this is all that we could do in the end. May the gods forgive us."

As Marina reads these words to herself, the iron plate that blocked the central, rubbled-off portion of the keep can be heard clattering harshly to the stone floor.

Marina looks up, when she hears the clatter, and swears loudly. "Clot it, couldn't you wait, dammit? Boys, every single one of you!" She glares at Davron. "**First** you look, **then** you read, and **only** then you start moving stuff!"

"Oh. Well then." Ramar sounds quite flat and emotionless, much as one who has done something along the lines of putting their foot in their mouth would sound. He shakes his head, "Er... quickly, we can put it back then, I think? Or uhm... I daresay that..."

Through the keep, a sudden sound can be heard: it sounds like that of stone portals slamming shut, those meant to isolate groups of attackers assaulting the keep.

Marina looks at Davron, and at Ramar, and glares at both. "Battlestations, boys."

Davron looks up, chastened. "...You're right, of course. I..." he begins, and then is cut off by the distant thud of stone on stone. "...hope we survive to regret our mistake."

Ramar draws his sword. "Battle stations... right..." He swings his blade in a swift pattern, moving from West to South to North. "Points of the five blades..." he mutters barely audible as he looks about for what might be headed their way. He strains his ears to see if he can hear anything... moving...

Davron watches everywhere, but especially on the opening where the plate had once been. His first thought is that the stone doors were rigged to seal if the plate was moved, perhaps not against something outside, but something within?

Chi-Yosh winces as the plate hits the floor. Marina's scorn is understood, but what truelly catches his attention is the boom of stonefalls. He immediately points to one side of the hole leading down into the center of the keep. "Ramar." Then the Su'Katan moves to the other side of the stairwell, while lingering to the back, so anyone coming up would have to crain their head backwards to see him waiting, weapons poised. He gestures to Marina and Davron, pointing to the far corner. "Both of you. Davron, shielding."

Davron nods quietly, bow at the ready, as he moves to defend Marina from whatever may come, either from the stairwell we entered, or the new one revealed.

Ramar strains his Essence-accentuated hearing to its utmost. What he hears from beneath is the guttering of torches and the soft chiming of bells.

Ramar moves to take a stance near the hole leading down to the center. He looks down, "There are bells within. Torches as well..." He strains his vision to try to catch glimpses of the points of light he hears being guttered about down there. His blade rests in his hand, ready to be wielded in defense of himself or his comrades...

At the base of the stairs, far beneath the earth, the rockslides have obstructed everything but a single doorway, beyond which the flickering light of torches can be discerned. The sound of bells clearly comes from within it.

Chi-Yosh looks down into the stairwell hole, nodding to Ramar. "Ramar, you and I are going to move the plate in front of the normal stairway. In case any Fae come up from behind, the cold iron will ward them off. If it is something else, we are less prepared, but I would like to cover our backs over atleast this."

"Indeed. Then we shall..." Ramar moves to aid Chi-Yosh in shifting the plate. He then turns back towards the staircase. "Whatever this... Regent is... I should imagine is down there. Along with whatever is making those bells chime..."

Chi-Yosh reclaims weapons in hand, and gestures to Ramar. "You can see better then I can, with the current aid. You will go first, I will be right behind you, on your left." The swordsman doesn't need his blade obstructed. "Then Davron several paces behind. Keep low; I care not to wear a feathered skull." With that, he moves to the stairway's top.

Marina moves forward, looking down into the darkness, and the light beyond. "You know, lads, it occurs to me that ... perhaps ... we could try talking our way out of this? I know it's a novel approach, but ..."

Davron glances at Marina, and smiles. "From the stories, if what is down there is indeed of the Fae, you may find you've finally met your match. But... we should have _all_ the resources we can at our disposal. Come along, but stay behind us."

Chi-Yosh glances over his shoulder. "The precaution in case the host does not wish to parlay. You are welcome to talk. I think we can still blades until we are sure we needn't."

"Of course." Ramar goes down first. "Yet it occurs to me that ... perhaps ... whatever it is that's down there is quite irate and willing to lash out at those who might have imprisoned it, or the first thing to come along. If this Regent can be reasoned with... then we shall try to do it. If not... then, we shall pray that we can reach the _Seagull_ before it does..."

Shrugging daintily, Marina nods, ready to pick her way down the stairs behind her cordon of young but determined guards.

Within the ruined keep, where only dust and death seem to hold sway, is an opulent chamber, behind the stone door. Within it sits the Regent, his features beautiful and terrible as with all of the Fair Folk, on an ornate throne of gold and gems and ivory. The room is decorated with walls of gossamer and light, woven into shimmering tapestries that hang from lily-white walls. Candles burn radiantly in silver-forged brackets affixed to the walls, shaped as outstretched fists gripping the slender stalks of wax.

The Regent's eyes are closed, but moments after the door's opening becomes audible, they open to reveal violet orbs. Long ebony hair sways like a stream of black water as he rises. Affixed to his shoulders is a purple cape or cloak of exquisite workmanship, and as he leaves his throne it's noted the cape seems almost attached to the marble base. He steps forward, and as he does the palatial features of the throne-room begin to drag themselves along the wall. The opulence of the room moves like a loosened layer of paper over the cracked and dead walls of the Keep, flowing out behind him, until nothing is left of that great room but a particularly decorative image of a throne-room, woven into the tail of the Regent's peculiar garment.

Her shoulders straightened, her throat dry, Marina drops a light curtsey. "Greetings, Fair Sir."

The Regent smiles languidly, reaching up to brush a hand across a stone set into jewelry on his shoulder, and as the eyes of the Solars follow it, some distinguish the characteristic marks of a Hearthstone. "Welcome, honored guests," his perfect voice gives answer. "To entertain visitors so late in the day... Forgive me, for I am not properly prepared to receive you."

Smiling, her head even, her gaze raised, but avoiding the mistake of looking directly into his, Marina smiles. "We, I fear, are not properly prepared for this audience, fair sir. We are but humble travelers, seeking a night's rest and repose under shelter." She looks at her compatriots, before turning back, inviting him to smile with her. "And being young, we could not resist the opportunity to explore these walls."

Davron remains silent and wary. The Regent is clearly a personage of some power - and, likely, confined up until now only by the cold iron plate which he and his companions so foolishly removed. At Marina's raised eyebrows, he manages a smile, and has no trouble giving a respectful bow.

Chi-Yosh tries not to stare. But attempting such is like trying not to get wet in a river. This is his first time seeing one of the Fair Folk, and one of the first impressions made is that they know how to make a grand gesture. The Dawn is wary, but he is also fearful. This is a Fae. If it gets angry... he is also regretful the iron plate was not placed at the top of the staircase they decended, just in case.

"Er uhm, ahem. Yes. Hello." Ramar remains mostly silent after that, though he smiles along with Marina. He tilts his head just a bit, after The Regent speaks, he decides to chime in, curiosity and nervousness getting the better of him. "Prepared to receive us? I suspect it has been... er... that is to say we're quite honored to have you receive us. Even so late in the day."

"Well said, for my domain is one of splendors unimagined," concedes the Regent loftily, with a patronizing smile. "Who indeed could resist its temptations, particularly young boys... and their well-spoken young sister." The sound of bells grows louder, and the Fae stirs somewhat. Nevertheless he loses his composure for the briefest moment only, continuing unruffled. "Make yourselves comfortable. My hospitality has never failed, even when I lack preparation; I promise you this." His eyes narrow as he smiles. "You will come to enjoy whatever you experience here with me."

Nodding, once, and blushing slightly at the implied compliment, Marina smiles. "We thank you." She looks around, slowly, careful not to give offense. Noticing the drawn weapons, a raised eyebrow suggests sheathing. "Perhaps, sir, we can contribute to a feasting? We have some small trifles; none, I fear, as grandiose as you no doubt possess, but we would be honoured to share."

Chi-Yosh slowly, cautiously puts his own weapons into their holdings. While they are a security blanket for him, they do not aid the case for the Circle's peacefulness. And he can defend himself without them. While loathe to do so, it seems for the better. Let Marina do what she does best.

"That will not be necessary," says the Regent, gently enough, eyeing the weapons with little fear indeed. He returns to his "throne", settling in, and as he does, the cape or cloak he wears begins to insinuate itself into the rock of the keep. The ways gradually shimmer from cracked and ancient stone into the palatial splendor they held before, and as the room is transformed, so too does it become populated. Lithe, attractive figures of both sexes (and sometimes, of no clear gender at all) emerge slowly from the air, bearing platters of fruit and crystal decanters of wine. "Please," says the Regent, invitingly.

"Or something. We are always honoured to be helpful where we might be." Ramar glances Marina's way, an apologetic look in his eyes as he glances back towards the Regent, a rather wary look in his eyes. His sword is sheathed, and he watches carefully, making sure never to seem overtly threatening. He watches the room shimmer, blinking curiously. "Perhaps..." he blinks, "Perhaps you could tell us more of the things that have occurred here?" He looks about quite alarmingly as things begin to shimmer into existence.

Davron slings his bow over his back, his wariness increasing markedly as the glamour - for this surely is what it must be, though he has never experienced it in person before now - manifests itself around him. "I..." he begins, then glances at Marina with a worried look.

"My kingdom," explains the Fae, in a voice of reminiscence, "is bordered here. It extends to the East, to the very border of what you know as the Wyld. My servants came with me," he adds, gesturing to those graceful beings who offer sweets, wine and other appetizers to the four. "They are loyal, and very very attentive."

"Of course. I should imagine it does... but this fortress? What of the happenings here? Has..." Ramar glances warily at the glamour-laced food. _I dare not risk such things... for though they may seem real, what enchantments may lay within are..._ Ramar shakes his head, clearing away the unbidden thought.

Marina smiles, accepting a goblet filled with wine. Sipping it, she rolls the nectar around in her mouth, before swallowing it with a pleased expression. "Your cellar, sir, is most wonderful." She takes a second sip, before holding the goblet carefully. "You have, sir, a great Kingdom. May I introduce myself? I am Marina." She nods. "And these are my good friends." She gestures carefully with the goblets, though she names no names. "We wonder, sir, how we should adress you."

"I am the Regent," says he, "as you must have seen. I commanded my servants to leave monuments of me and my name beyond. They carved such pretty pictures ..." He gestures, and the servants as one converge at the center of the room and deposit their platters on the floor. The food shimmers for a moment, revealing another illusion - or is it - of a dead and naked soldier, whose body has been mauled with the crazy rune-marks of the Fae. "Such pretty pictures..." The Regent sounds almost wistful, then, and looks up at Marina. "Shall I show you the portraits I commanded painted? I think perhaps the predominance of red overshadowed their artistic merit."

Marina looks down at the goblet in her hands, and then back at the dead and naked soldier, shaking her head. "I fear, sir, that your presence has passed into the depths of time ... Now the lands you claim are ruled by others."

The Fae's eyes flash angrily, as he looks up at Marina now, and his hands curl together into fists, the delicately-painted fingernails extending out into talons. "You lie, I am afraid," he says smoothly, in that flawless voice. The bells ring, suddenly, and the Regent grows visibly pale, relaxing back into his calmer state. "My kingdom is eternal. I am the Regent who rules in place of the Shogunate here."

"The commanders of this keep realized their mistake when they met me at last," he continues, in a silky voice. "They surrendered one of their baubles to me as a gift, and showed me to my throne room... Of course I could do nothing but accept their gracious gift. And so here I have remained, with my faithful servants, ruling wisely and justly.."

Marina smiles, trying to make a peace. "Yes, sir. I see I misunderstand now." She looks around. "It's one of the weaknesses we humans share, I fear. We remember poorly at times, although memory returns quickly when prompted." She looks again at her friends. "Perhaps, sir, we could carry this reminder for your to the folks beyond this room?"

"Ah, I see. A bauble had been left for you? What bauble, if I might ask, was this gift? So that we might be aware of the fineries one as worthy as yourself can only graciously accept...?" Ramar's voice is curious, if cautious. He nods, slowly, listening to the fellow after his question has been posed.

The Regent brightens considerably at this suggestion. "I have often wondered if my servants have become mere sycophants," he admits, candidly, waving a hand to dismiss the apparitions back into the thin air from which they sprang. "And none have come to parlay with me in ... so long. I have always known I ruled wisely and well, but perhaps they simply... do not know they can bring their problems to me." He sighs, and nods, considering. "Very well. Please, take this with you." He extends one flawless hand, offering a signet ring to Marina. And turning to Ramar, he gestures with his now-free hand at the Hearthstone set into its piece. "This, a treasure of the keep's former occupants."

Marina accepts the signet ring carefully, cradling it in both hands, examining it carefully. The smallest tendril of essence pulses forth, caressing its surface, before she carefully stows it away in a pouch at her belt. "I shall carry this ring, sir, and take it to those who need to be reminded." She drops a second curtsey, before placing the goblet of wine carefully on the ground.

"It might simply be that they do not know that you would be willing to listen to them. Or that they are in too much awe to approach." Ramar gives something of a smile then, peering at the Hearthstone set into the piece. "Ah. A treasure of the keep's former occupants... indeed." He peers closely at the hearthstone, curiously, "It is quite fascinating, you are indeed a worthy host, to receive such an excellent gift."

The Regent inclines his head politely to Ramar, in silent approval.

Davron smiles and lays a hand on Ramar's shoulder and squeezes it lightly, hoping thereby to discourage any further talk. He has some vague ideas of the purpose of the hearthstone, and some rather clearer ideas about not wishing to speak them aloud until this chamber is firmly sealed once more. Instead, he bows very deeply indeed, as befitting a subject of a lord. "We thank you for your hospitality, good sir. I only wish that we could stay to enjoy it longer."

Chi-Yosh merely bows towards the Regent, still offering silence, but mustering the strenght to afford him a smile, even so far as to afford a salute worthy of a ruler. If he were to speak, he may have mirrored Davron, and he does not wish to rouse any suspicion in the Fae. Marina has paved way for their exit. Let it be done, and fast.

"I fear, sir, I have no gift of equal worth I can offer you." Marina looks a little embarassed at this. "I offer, therefore, my services as your messenger as my gift." She stands straight, and drops a last curtsey, before slowly backing towards the staircase. There, she needs to turn to walk safely upwards, but she does so slowly, climbing back to the room above, where she eyes the iron plate thoughtfully.

Ramar bows, similarly. Then he backs up the stairs carefully, looking fairly relieved to be walking away from such an encounter with his soul and sanity intact. At least he's fairly certain they are. Once at the top of the stairs, he ponders the plate, and nods towards the others, indicating that all four should move it as silently as possible to get it back into place.

Davron and Chi-Yosh take their places beside Ramar, and with their efforts the plate, with its warning, soon secures the stairwell once more. That done, Davron breathes a deep sigh, his shoulders slumping with sudden relaxation. "Ware the Regent indeed. Well... let that be a lesson to us. It's lucky that the Dragon-Blooded keepers were able to seal the fae so securely."

Looking at the plate, shaking his head, Chi-Yosh makes a mental note to heed omnimous warnings more closely. There is a reason they are omnimous.

The ring, under normal circumstances, bore the Regent's crest, that of the Dragon-Blooded Shogunate with certain monstrous alterations. Now, however, it is a plain band, clearly of Orichalcum, with lettering in the Old Realm's script ringing the inside.

The ring is subjected to close and careful scrutiny from two pairs of eyes, and the following words are tentatively recognized: Trapped (or Confined or Limited), North, Heaven and Astrology (or Astrologer, or "Wisdom from the heavens").

With the combined strenght of Ramar, Davron and Chi-Yosh, the iron box is moved with much grunting and shifting down the stairs, and out of the keep. Likely there would have been less shifting and near dropping, but everyone seems in a slight rush to get out of the keep, box or no. The half mile to the _Seagull_ is equally full of juggling the strongbox, but thankfully they all make it, unloading the item finally with a thud upon the wooden deck. And sail is set for Syllum's capital.
