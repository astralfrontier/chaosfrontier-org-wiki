# Gods of Eden 2003-09-16

King Calis Leom is a strong man, sitting on a weak throne. His people are strong, but like the ocean, they are strong only when flowing in a wave, and unresistant to a casual diver when placid. Still, the king commands, and his thains obey. That is the way of things, and in the deepest cells of each man's heart is locked the fear of the alternative: endless chaos and anarchy. And so they obey.

"Little Gally" is how the king might once have spoken to his daughter. Now it is as a leader of men to another, though they be much fewer in number and in station. Now he stands beside the table in his chambers, like a half-burned candle, the flame behind his eyes revealing the fire that has almost completely consumed this man. "Lady Gallius," he greets, formally enough, with one hand resting on the table unconsciously for support. The door shuts as his daughter enters the room, and before she can offer a greeting or ask a question, he raises a hand and smiles gently. "Now, now, I know you've heard rumors.. all sorts of business. Now, let me set you straight on what's happening."

Gallius enters with the same confident stride that her father once claimed, the one that even long, hard years cannot entirely steal from him. She cannot help but meet her father's smile with her own, though she fails to hide the slight wavering of the corner of her mouth, a problem she didn't have a few season ago. "King Calis," she replies, formally in turn, but with warmth that she does not care to hide, "I would greatly like to hear what is happening, hopefully in time to help turn it to the aid of our people."

"War is brewing. This much is true," says the king, tiredly. "The Marukani are mustering their horse-warriors, and many of their Hammerers have already ridden east along the Yanaze River. Even the River-Trader Tribes to the east are growing restless, trading in arms they bring from the South." He lets out a long sigh, gathering his strength. "The Scarlet Empress vanished. The Realm has grown chaotic. We cannot side with them, and yet many of those in the River Province still give tribute to whatever Dynastic House is willing to collect it. The Confederation of Rivers has decided that now is the time to drive the Realm out entirely. They intend to push through the Hundred Kingdoms, riding an army to the gates of Greyfalls."

Lady Gallius nods, folding her hands carefully at her waist. She does not sigh, her smile not vanishing, but growing stronger, more confident. She is young, and news of challenge envigorates her yet. She is also patient, and speaks not, waiting for her father and king to reveal more.

Her father studies the face of his heir for a moment, then smiles. "I sense in you not the impatience to fight, but the curiosity to know more than what is simply presented," he says with more than a hint of pride in his deep voice. "I, too, have looked beyond the basics. Did you realize that the barbarians of the southeast are moving again? And that they began moving almost to the day that talk of war was bandied about in the Confederation council?" he asks softly.

"That news is unsettling," answers Gallius. "I wonder just whom they shall come to fight. Perhaps they seek to join in this battle, or perhaps they wish to loot those who march off in haste." She frowns for a moment (as she always does when thinking of questions she cannot possibly answer) and asks, "Do the barbarians travel with heavy provisions, or do they appear to be itching to steal their supper instead?"

"That is not known," says the king, gravely. "But I suspect a little of both." He moves forward, walking with unsteady strength, and clasps the shoulder of his daughter with a familiar grip. "I want you to find the leaders of the savages. Find them and follow them. Learn whether this organization is accidental, or if there is some greater purpose behind it. Then return here. Do you feel capable?"

"It will be done," answers Gallius calmly. A moment passes, and the steel of her voice and her expression fades away. She raises her hands to clasp her father's arm. "I will take care and not fail," she says softly. Her hands return to their place with careful grace and her expression of neutrality is restored. "I imagine my liege wishes his captain to hasten."

King Calis nods his head slowly, and backs away. "Go with the blessings of gods and dragons," he says in a soft, confident voice.

Gallius drops to a knee bowing her head deeply. She remains there for a moment, then rises and turns without a word, marching from her father's hall. A page is seen and called to, "Please seek Lady Yuri and tell her Lady Gallius departs in the hour, and then find Malis and give him the same message." Before the young boy can turn to his task a coin is offered, his protests of honor retorted with a teasing comment from Gallius. "I have seen the way you look at Tiera, you will need all the coin you can come across." This leaves but one companion for Gallius to seek, and the one that only she has any skill in finding: Gari, the 'reformed' horse thief and would-be head of scouts.

As is often the way, Gari is found where few would imagine it wise to look. Fortunately, Lady Gallius keeps careful tabs on Gari, lest he slip away and get himself in some foolish adventure. She steps confidently into a stable at the General's Grace Inn. "I hope your hangover has passed by now, Gari. And if Misha is up there with you I will expect a ring on her finger before the week is out!" calls out Lady Gallius, her tone making it hard to determine if she's joking or not.

"I'm not up here, Lady Gallius," calls out Misha helpfully. "Oh dear.." The tavern maid pokes her head up out of the hay and looks down at Gallius with wide eyes. "This is so very embarassing!" she says, laughing softly. "Gally, can't you EVER let a man have an honest day's rest?" comes another voice. "Gari, I ride out from here within the hour. If you wish to come, I suggest you put your pants on and saddle your horse. That is _your_ horse, is it not?" Before the man is given much chance to protest Misha blurts in, "It's true, then! It's going to be war?" Gallius frowns and shakes her head, "Not for us. Not for a long time, I hope. Of course, if Gari doesn't get down very soon, you will see war." With that, Gallius turns to go ready her own steed.

Preparations for a long ride are made around the castle. A morning departure seems like the sensible thing, and so plans are made well into the night. Maps are consulted, trackers found and questioned, ideas formulated. The barbarian movements were identified; now it is up to the Lady's party to follow up on those movements, and learn whatever can be learned about what motivates them. As Gallius enters her own room and shuts the door, preparing to change, there's the softest sound of a cleared throat, and a strange voice speaks from the dimly-lit chambers. "Let's speak."

Lady Gallius shifts on her feet abruptly. The history of Roleyn has made her family aware of assassins and unpleasant surprises. The hand that reaches for a dagger pauses though, and she waits. "Who are you?" she asks, her voice somehow betraying not even the littlest bit of trepidation.

The unknown visitor is dark like the shadows of the room, tanned and bronzed by the Southern Sun, and wearing a heavy and embroidered cloak, as a merchant prince might. His eyes glower as he blackly regards the scene beyond the window, but he grows more neutral as his gaze tracks the room's owner. "You are Gallius," he says in a quiet voice of absolutely iron certainty, a voice that brooks no opposition or denial. "You're Chosen of the Unconquered Sun." He walks forward, clasping his hands behind his back as though he were a scholar tutoring a wayward student. "We'll have need of you soon. So don't die."

The Lady turns her head, eyes narrowing. "What are you saying?" she asks softly. "The chosen of the Unconquered Sun?" Inside her, she feels something shift, something that somehow makes sense, something that she rejects completely. "Is this some sort of foolish prank? Did Gari put you up to this?" If so she's going to skin him alive!

"Your secrets are known," says the visitor shortly. "We waste time. Listen. You seek answers among the barbarians of the south. You will not find them alone, and if you persist, you will not live. Since I know you will not listen to me, let me add further advice. When he challenges you again, accept the hunt, not the battle." And with that, the man's form becomes limned with light, as a fountain of Essence springs up around him. His shape shimmers and blurs in the brilliant display, and after a moment it "pops", leaving only empty air behind. The contrails of Essence in the room flare out, fading to nothingness seconds later. And Gallius is reminded of the last time she saw such a thing...

---

It was over three months ago, in the month of Resplendent Earth, the Lady Gallius had been riding. She rode to survey her lands and her lord's holdings, to ensure that the king's word was obeyed and to show that the king's promises were kept to his people. She rode to ward off the persistent attacks of tribal primitives who persisted in taking what they needed from the villages around them. She rode with a hundred men, her pennant proudly flying overhead and snapping in the breeze.

She rode, and the tribes fell back. She drove in, and they withdrew. And then, when she rode and saw no signs of them, the barbarians came upon her and her people. And the greatest of them all was a Wyld-touched monster out of nightmare, a creature like a great goat or wolf, and it ran through the troops like the scythe before wheat. The screams of men dead or dying rent the air, and the rains poured down, as the clouds welled together in sympathy for the carnage and the waters of heaven were wept like tears at the winnowing of a hundred brave lives.

And at last, bleeding and barely conscious, Gallius lay with her back against a rock as the creature faced her, eyes glittering hungrily, mouth stained with the blood of her comrades. "And so there is only you left, young one," its honeyed voice said, issuing from that horridly fanged maw. "And so here you will die. Let your ghost find its way back to your father to tell him what has happened here." And he turned, and began walking away through the curtains of rain.

Gallius looked up then at the sky, knowing she had failed her father and her people. Despite this feeling of shame and sadness, what burned brightest in her heart was wrath, both for her people and for her humiliation. "Would that my dying wish be granted," she thought to herself, trying to urge her ruined body to one last action and finding nothing left inside it.

**And so it is, child, that you find yourself with the will, but not the power,** a voice says silently, resonant in the mind of the dying leader, strong and masculine and paternal. A father, but not Gallius' father. Or, perhaps, it is after all. **If you were granted the power, child... would you fight? Would you use the gifts I would bestow upon you? Would you bring my light to the world again? For I am the Unconquered Sun, and I am Strength.**

Responding to something that Gallius does not know, with a voice stronger and more clear than any she had in health, the dying woman answers, "I will fight, I will light the world, I will bring justice to the wicked and mercy and compassion to the weak. Grant me the strength, and I will do all this." Somehow, in the midst of this, the wrath vanishes, replaced by a hunger for life, a will to return to her father and her people.

The rains part, and the clouds roll away from the battlefield, almost respectfully. Overhead blazes the Sun, shining down defiantly at a world that cannot hide itself away forever. The light would be blinding to mortal eyes, but now Gallius looks up with more than mortal vision. She sees a shaft of light, reaching down to touch her face, to pour power into her body, to transfigure her very being into something newer and stronger. Her wounds close of their own accord. And she rises to her feet, with less effort than she might spend to blow a feather out of her outstretched palms. The battlefield is deserted; only the dead are here, and instinctively Gallius raises her arms. Essence pours from her, consuming the bodies to a fine ash. The sunbeam widens, and she can almost see the souls of her departed comrades, given freedom to travel to Heaven, rather than rise as ghosts and the soulless undead.

Gallius looks about her and lets out a soft sigh. She is not tired, she is not worried, nor sad. She is floating in calm and certainty. She speaks to herself, or perhaps to the spirits, "It must not kill another. I am the servant of the Unconquered Sun. I am the light bringer."

Gallius takes a step forward, already seeking to pursue a hopeless battle, but her path is disturbed by the neighing of a horse, followed by the nuzzling of the nose. As if roused from a dream, Gallius shakes herself and turns to her loyal mount, "Wingfoot," she murmurs. "You are still alive.." She looks down, seeing the horse is hurt, blood still coming from its wounds. "I will protect the weak," whispers Gallius, wondering where she has heard that before. Somewhere.. but it is like a dream, almost. "I will take care of you, Wingfoot. Come, we must return to my father's hall." She turns away from the battle, then. For now justice can be postponed, but these killings will never be forgiven.

---

The battle is replayed in Gallius' dream, over and over again, and she wakes with a start, feeling the golden Caste Mark burning on her forehead. "Coming in, miss!" calls the voice of one of the ladies of the household staff, and Gallius quickly tosses a blanket over her head to hide the mark. The words of that strange man resonate in her ears, even now. Could he have meant... that monster?
