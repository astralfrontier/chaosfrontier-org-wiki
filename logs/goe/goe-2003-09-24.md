# Gods of Eden 2003-09-24

Far to the southwest in Marita, and much nearer to the northwest in Greyfalls, plans are being drawn up to begin a war. The Solars had asked the Master about the origin of the conflict, and their enigmatic patron promised he'd do what he could. For now, though, the shadow of war that hangs over the Scavenger Lands seems distant, a black bird that hasn't yet come to roost. Curiously, the Master said nothing about the five Solars either assisting in the conflict or about staying clear of it. He did wear a faint smile, though, as they departed.

And now, the _Seagull_ makes its swift, sure way through the kingdom of the air. Here the sky-gods hold sway, and sunbeams shine down overhead as the Unconquered Sun gazes proudly down on his brave soldiers. The air is hot as it rushes past the sky-ship, and even the speedy wind cannot contain the exuberant heat of the spirits of fire as they do their unseen dances, celebrating their newfound dominance. It is now the thirteenth day of Ascending Fire, and the Court of Seasons is presently ruled by the gods of flame and heat. Summer is assuredly here.

"Ahhh. Can you feel that? The warmth in the air! Quite inviting. Welcoming even!" A smile is worn on Ramar's face as he sails the open sky. "So we are headed towards Maze? What are we to expect there, does anyone know? I cannot say I've ever traveled in that direction, nor can I claim to know what we will face there. We're dealing with the... Lunars, yes?"

Gallius, for her part, remains rather quiet, half-withdrawn. She looks ahead, her eyes narrowing as she strains to see ahead. She lets out a soft sigh and her neutral expression gives way to a wry grin as her thoughts wander very far away.

Marina watches Gallius curiously, noticing the sigh, and the smile, and wondering what they portend.

Leaning against the mainmast, peering out over the prow, Chi-Yosh tilts his head towards Ramar. "The Beastmen. The jaguar people who threw spears at us the day I fell into the lap of the _Seagull_. They are lead by the Lunar sorcerer... Who he is, I do not know. The Master's notes did not say. He is shrewd and determined." Silence prevails for a moment. "I will try my best to make this a non-violent exchange. I will see if he will treat me as his equal, if I take the trials beastmen do at adulthood." A hand lays over the hearthstone on the neckless beneath his chain shirt. On the one hand, he truelly should not care about it - going at great lenghts to gain it back is unneccessary. On the other hand, its powers can be put to great use, especially for the Unconquered Sun. Selfish reasons aside, sacrifice for the Sun takes precident to avoiding mere hardship.

Turning towards Chi-Yosh, Marina raises an eyebrow. "You've yet to mention, lad, what these trials are."

Partially paying heed to the words of Chi-Yosh, Gallius turns and says, "If you take their tests, are you an equal of the leader, of his followers?" Her lips curve more fully into a smile as she cannot shake whatever warm thought it was that crept into her mind.

Chi-Yosh answers without looking away from where the ship is headed. "I have yet to know. The sorcerer is ever the cat; mysterious and sure of himself." A shake of his head, finally turning towards the others, arms lacing over his chest. "Maybe. He said if I pass those trials that all jaguar men must take, then he will see about earning respect."

"The Beastmen. I remember them. And now we return to soothe their angers. I shall do my best to aid you, Chi-Yosh in anyway I can. If it means joining you in taking the tests, I'll do so. Although I do not know that he will teach you as an equal... we shall at least be certain he will hold more respect than he did before..."

Davron looks off into the distance. "I wonder what they will make of our presence," he muses quietly to himself. "Will we be asked to endure the challenges as well?" He shakes his head. "First we must arrive there. And that may prove to be a minor challenge of its own."

The verdant expanse of densely-packed forest rushes past, passing beneath the keel of the vessel. Far below, the tiny black dot of the _Seagull's_ shadow can barely be made out. To the north is Chi-Yosh's home, perhaps 300 miles distant. The Maze Forest is so named for its twisty and deceptive ways, its mischievous spirits, and the wood-elementals that play at rearranging the pathways between landmarks. And now the _Seagull_ passes over it, traveling toward that point at which Chi-Yosh first made the acquaintance of his fellow Solars - the hard way.

"He is doing what is right," Chi-Yosh rebuffs, glancing towards Ramar. "I strided into the holy land of his people and stole from a place of worship. He is not doing the unreasonable." Hands spread. "I do not know." Gaze shifts back over the forest. "I think we should find the cliff I lept from first, and set the _Seagull_ atop it. That way we could retrace my path back to the Manse?"

Davron stands up, looking out over the prow at the forests lining the cliff edge. "You are the only one who has traveled these parts before, Chi-Yosh. I think you are the only one who _could_ find our path..."

Gallius will leave the preparations for this little foray to those who have been to this place before. As for her, she will just study this curious place. She's never seen the like of this forest.

"I think I could perhaps retrace his path. It's difficult, but it can be done," answers Ramar. He starts to set the _Seagull_ into a slow circling path, directing it towards the ground in a lazy-ish manner. "And finding a Manse should not be hard."

The _Seagull_ docks at precisely the cliff Chi-Yosh leaped from. The Su'Katan can even inspect the crumbled rock edge off which his feet propelled him, in that mad leap.

Gallius stares down at the winding forest, looking at it as if it were a viper. "I rather preferred it from higher up," she murmurs. "This place is a bit too.. stuffy." One might think the forest makes Lady Gallius uncomfortable. That person would be right.

Ramar steps down from the Seagull, loooking around. A wry grin is on his face. "I told you I'd find the place where you started. And retracing your steps from here should not be terribly difficult. Presuming of course things haven't been terribly disturbed..." Ramar glances around, eyes opening wide as he surveys the forest around. His gaze travels over the branches, "You took to the branches, yes?"

Chi-Yosh climbs from the ship onto the earth below, taking a deep breath of the forest about him. It smells so much like home. Vibrant, full of life, and just enough danger to keep one's mind sharp. But here he had hoped to return to such a place on better terms. It takes many moments for the mind to still, and then he draws forward. At peace, eased so, the very vegetation bends to him, accepts him, and the Su'Katan moves quietly. A nod to Ramar, but he does not spare a lot of attention to the Eclipse. The Manse once called to him like a sirine. Now, he hopes it will call him again.

The five Solars haven't moved fifteen yards before there's a screeching sound behind them. A hawk, previously unobserved, is now diving toward the _Seagull_ at top speed. As it fans its wings out to brake, its form changes radically, becoming that of a lithe young woman with cat-like ears. Her nondescript grey garb slides effortlessly out of Elsewhere to conceal her human form even in the midst of her change. She lands easily on the deck almost directly by the controls, and one hand waves jauntily, while the other jerks on the elevation lever. The craft begins to dart into the sky.

Gallius steps off the ship just in time to see it stolen. She takes a look more or less towards her homeland, letting out a sigh. She says only, "I cannot die here," before she turns back to look at Chi-Yosh. "If we can, I'd rather destroy this sorceror of yours at this point," she adds.

"Well..." Ramar looks on as the craft darts into the sky. He blinks. Several times, stunned. His eyes are wide open, and his hands tremble slightly. The sound of cloth fluttering as his knees give out and he finds himself resting atop them is accented and complimented by the sound of said knees hitting the dirt. His eyes are stuck skyward, as he mutters softly, under his breath in the Western tongue... "She was a good ship... I'll see her again..." He sounds, almost eerily calm.

Marina sighs, and pulls her cloak closer around her shoulders. Now, at least, she's glad she travels light. No treasures left to lose. But the Master will **not** be happy about this loss.

Davron whirls, and half-draws his bow, before thinking better of it - even if he hit the mark, the _Seagull_ would be left without a steerswoman, and would fly beyond reach, or even crash. "Damnation! They've got us all trapped now!" He sighs, and kicks the dust. "There's hope, I suppose. She was clearly a Lunar... if we are successful, perhaps it'll be returned to us."

"WELCOME TO THE FIRST TEST!" the voice of the girl bellows, from overhead. And with that, the sky-ship begins to lurch unsteadily, off to the north.

Marina nudges Davron. "Remember wondering if we, too, would be tested? The answer is yes." She grins, drily.

Chi-Yosh turns, and watches the woman takeover the ship like the bird of prey she had once been. And he is none surprised. The Lunar is taking precations - the Su'Katan will not escape like he had last time. Very well. "He will return the ship," he says. "This is part of the test." With that, he turns, and moves into the forest. In his heart, the warrior hopes that the sorcerer is only going to make him suffer. In his mind, he would not second guess the Lunar, for he knows not of this one's honor.

Ramar looks skyward. He stands, stretching himself out slowly, calmly. His eyes close tightly, and he shakes his head as though something were on it. His eyes open then, and the smile returns. "Well we shall be successful. And don't worry. We'll get the ship back. Willingly or not However, we shall go to the Manse. Come with me, if you will, or not." With that, Ramar takes to the Forest, looking for the Manse and signs of passage.

Gallius will just follow Chi-Yosh, trying to keep alert in this foreign environment. She cannot help but keep her spear in-hand and ready. Next time she sees that Lunar, her weapon will not be idle.

After a few moments to regain their collective senses, Chi-Yosh and Ramar forge ahead, leading the group. Like a river, the subtle and faint currents of Essence that make the forest what it is can be felt drifting this way and that, following its set course. And like every river, the Essence of the forest has a spring. The woodlands are dense and often confusing, but Chi-Yosh's feet know the trail he has walked before. The two men push ahead, clearing branches and brambles from their path.

There is a soft chuckling sound, now and again, the thick laugh of the wood elementals who lurk in the forest. Sometimes the evil sound emanates from very far away; sometimes it sounds disturbingly close. The five push through, though, mindful of the ground beneath their feet. And finally, the eyes of the other four widen, while Chi-Yosh merely looks at that which found him allies - and trouble.

Sunlight streams through the great canopy, casting shadows and rare highlights of radiance across the Manse. While large and small at the same time - fifteen feet high, the same as the base. The stonework is smooth and delicately crafted, seeming untouched as though it had grown instead of crafted by hand. The walls are partially honeycombed, half formed bubbles that slowly spiral up the tapering lenght of the manse, before it reaches a domed point at the top. Not only do plants grow around it - looking almost too real by the flow of Essence feeding their vitality - but leafed vines grow on it. The foilage coils around the construction as though possessive, as well as following the spiraled grooves that spiral upwards.

Chi-Yosh breathes in the feeling of life in the air, the sheer swimming power of the Manse and how it floods the forest around it. He feels at home, but it is a great shame his home has caused such strife, for he and his Circle. A glance backwards, one rueful smile towards his comrads, before the Su'Katan strides forward.

Gallius studies the Manse slowly, trying to figure out just what it is she is looking at. "So this is the sacred place," she murmurs. Normally she would make some sign of reverance, but the memory of theft pushes any such olive branch gestures far from her mind.

Ramar is unable to resist having his mouth drop open at the sight of this Manse. He looks up, studying it with an awed expression on his face. The foilage and the vines catch his eye immediately, and as he walks, a slow, almost surreal pace, he looks around. "Wow... Chi-Yosh... this pace is beautiful... where... where should we go?" Each footstep is soft, yet inexorably, assuredly real. The dirt clouds his feet kick up flow into soft patterns, caught by a stray stream of essence, shifting into glyphs with little meaning, before dispersing.

Davron nods quietly to himself, wonderingly, admiring the work of the occult architect who had crafted this place. "A work of art... and no wonder the Lunar and his beastmen value it so." He steps forward without further words, following in the footsteps of his companion.

Chi-Yosh moves like he has trod the soil a thousand times, by memory or mere intuition. Walking around the circular structure, he leads them to the arched opening. "The view is better from the inside." With that, he steps within.

The inside is just as majestic. A curtain of moss, green as emeralds, obscures the entrance. From within, the half-sphere honeycomes are almost translucent, allowing light to filter in and cast long shadows and circles of light upon the clean soil of the Manse's floor. Water has pooled in a small pond in the very center, clear as crystal, and within it springs forth a sappling. Branches rise like a ribcage, circling into a small bower where Chi-Yosh's hearthstone had nested once before.

Ramar follows Chi-Yosh inside, his gaze drawn to almost every part of the Manse as he steps in. He strides carefully, his hands flexing as the thrill of the Essence flowing and being focused washes over the group. "A... I... should say it again... wow." He steps towards the small bower, "Is this where it was? Should we... wait here?"

Gallius looks inside, but does not enter. "Quite an interesting place," she comments softly. The Lady is out of place, and though she senses the beauty of this land, she cannot quite relax. "I imagine soon we'll know just what these tests are for."

Marina nods, slowly, at Gallius, as she, too, waits outside. Some houses she prefers not to enter until invited in.

"He knows we are here. He will come when he is ready." Chi-Yosh doesn't intend to sound omnimous, but truth and the weight of it is ever pressing. He pulls the hearthstone from within his shirt, and plucks it from the necklace. Wading into the pond, the stone is fitted into its nest. Turning, "The hearthstone was requested returned. And it has been. Now it depends on our host."

Davron nods to Chi-Yosh, rousing himself from the fascinated study of the Manse's interior. Quietly he waits - no hand on a weapon, but alert for the arrival of... whoever it is that may choose to arrive.

"And on ourselves. We are all here. We will all pass these tests and return safely. I'm... well, I must admit to being worried before, however..." Ramar shrugs, and looks around, "The sheer beauty of this place seems to have washed such worries away. I can understand why you would have been here..."

Drawing from the water, Chi-Yosh's attention has for the moment been fixated on a spot before the pond. While the earth shows no sign of it, that is where he had fell, where hands and bared feet had dug into the ground, and his Exaltation had taken place. It brings a swell of pride and deeper things to him in memory - how he desires the unity with the land he had once felt.

Looking around, Marina keeps a wary eye on her surroundings. An effort soon rewarded, as she stiffens. Somewhere, nearby, there's a presence. Somewhere ... She turns slowly, pivoting, while her gaze sweeps the forest. When she senses a presence, she moves, nonetheless, determined not to prove she knows where that person - if person it be - is watching, and waiting. Finally, after a full sweep, she turns again, to watch the forest, turned so that she keeps the presence in her peripheral field of vision.

Davron glances at Ramar, his expression calm, but his voice with the slightest of an edge. "Do not speak lightly of the tests," he chides. "I know not what they may be, but from Chi-Yosh's tale, they are the rite of adulthood of the Lunar's people. This is not a game we play, Ramar." He glances toward the entrance, and notes Marina's heightened alertness. He steps to the threshold of the Manse and studies the forest beyond... uncertain if he will see what she sees.

Gallius shrugs to herself and looks up at the tree tops, studying them curiously. She asides to anyone who is listening, "I've never been in a real forest before. At least nothing like this. The whole place is alive."

The archer's untrained eyes are soon thwarted by the concealing branches and foliage, however. Davron speaks softly. "Do you see something, Marina?" he asks.

Ramar nods, "I do not mean to be disrespectful. I am simply saying that we shall pass them. Though they be deadly serious and our livelihood and lives likely rest on our success, I know that we can succeed." He looks upwards, "We have to." He peers around, wondering, "Should we keep watch outside?"

Chi-Yosh steps from within the Manse, surveying the denseness of the land beyond. "This is a test that they take at adulthood. Our thief said this is the first test. We must survive here, I know not for how long, but we must find shelter, food, warmth. Live by our own means."

Marina moves towards Davron, and speaks in an undertone that does not carry. "We speak of watching, while someone watches us." Her lips twist, as her hand comes to rest on Davron's arm, fingers nudging in the direction of the watcher.

Ramar blinks for a moment, peering at Marina and Davron as they stand outside. He moves carefully towards the pair, a curious expression on his face.

Davron's voice is quiet in turn. "Should we go and see whatever it is they want?" he says. As Ramar approaches, he explains, in the same low tones, that something in the forest has taken an interest in us.

Gallius decides, quite oddly, to inspect the area. She'll make a sentry walk of the perimeter. She is more interested in getting the lay of the immediate area than anything else. At this point, she's eager to pass these trials or destroy the Lunar.

"I think, gentlemen," Marina's voice remains low, and pitched to carry no further, "I think that the woodwise among us should exit from the far side of the manse, circle round, and capture our watcher. We have ... questions."

"Indeed. If we can. Although if you'd like we could simply approach it. It may not be something that is threatening to us. What if it is... friendly?" Ramar shrugs, and peers in the direction it is. He shakes his head a moment, closing his eyes and letting his other Senses take over easily. The flows of Essence whisper in his ears and carry scents to his nostrils as he begins acknowledging them.

Davron shakes his head. "I have little enough woodcraft, and none for sneaking up on our new friend without his awareness. I would have to hope that he comes this way, should the hunters amongst us flush him out..."

Marina nods, and shrugs. "I suppose ... I suppose I could try speaking to them?" She smiles wryly. "Apply a little presence?"

Ramar opens his eyes slowly, glancing in the direction of the watchers. "Hmmm." His voice drops to a low tone. "There is something that smells...human and hmmm, something simian. Something that's a skilled tracker... perhaps... yes, Steel. Armed. Presence may be the key here. Whatever it is likely knows we're here. And it has likely scented us by now, or it can take to the trees easily enough, should it detect us sneaking up on it. Hmmm. Odd... leather... it smells of leather. An armor, I think."

Marina looks at Ramar. "So; do we try to sneak up on it, or confuse it by talking to it?"

Ramar says, "I'd say talk to it. As it likely knows we're here, we can at least let it know we know as well. I know I could not sneak up on such a thing. If it flees, we can track it, perhaps... if not... well..."

Gallius returns to stand by Marina and Ramar. "I could try to talk our friend out of hiding, as well." She will leave it for the others to do what they will first, though. After all, she is not really that familiar with what they can do.

Chi-Yosh draws his attention to the trees. "The notes spoke of Beastmen who were part monkey, as well. This may be an aid to the sorcerer, or his enemy. I do not suspect it will flee away. It has steel. It is not stupid. It may be cautious, but there is a reason we are watched. If not as prey, then as potential allies, or as suspects."

Stepping away from the others, Marina moves to stand directly between the Watcher and the Manse. Her cloak hangs over her shoulders, leaving her hands free though pointedly empty, as she gathers her Presence around her like a second, warmer cloak. As she feels her essence flowing through her body and mind, she projects to the watcher, trying to draw him - or her - out into the open, trying to convince it that she means no harm, but also that the watcher will not harm her. Finally, after long moments of silence, she speaks, her voice pitched to carry to the Watcher's ears, and no further. "Greetings, Watcher." She pauses, gauging its response.

Marina's seeking, penetrating gaze drills through the fog of trees and branches and leaves, meeting another pair of eyes, which gaze back, widened. The observer seems mesmerized, waiting to see what this uncannily perceptive outsider will do next.

Lips curving into a smile, Marina takes another small step forward, eager to see this watcher more closely but determined not to spook it. A second step, and then she stops. "Greetings, Watcher," she repeats herself, "We would be overjoyed if you were to join us tonight. We have little hospitality to offer, but we will willingly share what we have." She shrugs, apologetically. "Though until our hunters fill the pot, dinner will be a trifle thin."

Warily, the watcher moves forward, eyes locked on Marina's. From out of the dense forests it comes, eight feet tall, an ape with a man's face and a man's hands, wearing patchwork leather armor obviously adapted from that worn by more... human.. warriors. It wears a bandolier of throwing knives, and clutches one in a giant, hairy hand. The workmanship of the knives is exceptional, perhaps the only sign of true craft evident on this otherwise-primitive being. He says nothing, still staring at Marina, but obviously compelled.

Moving another step closer, maintaining eye contact all the while, Marina holds out her right hand, empty palm up. "Greetings, Watcher," she repeats herself again. "I am Marina." She looks at the knife in his hand. "You carry beautiful knives."

Chi-Yosh's eyes widen, but just a fraction. Such is what the other beastmen the Master's notes mentioned. He makes no movements, seeing she has him entranced and, considering the weaponry, it might well be a good thing.

Gallius tenses just slightly at the sight of the knives, but it lasts only a little while. She watches Marina work, curious as to just what will come of this.

Hesitantly the ape-man extends his unsheathed weapon, gripping the blade and offering it for inspection, perhaps. It is a fine knife indeed. It is unlike the others, and its handle is shaped into a gloved hand clenching a coin. The coin is real enough, marked with sigils and runes and clasped in the knife-handle. Marina and Ramar have seen such weapons before, used by assassins of the Guild. The handle is filled with a silver or jade piece, representing money that was taken from the Guild by whatever victim the assassin came for. "Present," the ape-man offers, fumbling over the words of Riverspeak. "For lady."

Davron keeps his own hands at his sides, giving the beastman as friendly a smile as he can muster. Truly, Marina has a way with words... and more than anything else, he is curious where this way is taking us all. He dares not speak, lest he break the spell... but the offering of the knife is a fascinating gift indeed.

Ramar watches the ape-man step out of the woods. His gaze travels along the creature, curiously, eyes widening as he notices the make of the knife. _The... GUILD? Their assassin's daggers... here?_ This causes the Solar to grow a little more wary, though he remains calm. The knife is being offered. This is good.

Stepping closer to inspect the knife, Marina holds her empty hand under the knife, fingers slightly curled, but not quite touching. She looks down at the knife for a moment, seeing what the knife is and what it represents, before looking back up at the man. She places her other hand on her chest, fingering the pin that holds her cloak together. It's a gold pin, a simple leaf design, one that this man might appreciate. Waiting for him to notice the pin, her fingers slide it loose, letting her cloak flutter to the ground behind her. "Thank you, sir." She smiles, her eyes twinkling, as her hand slides up to hold the handle, grasping it firmly. "A present, sir, for a man who will wear it well." She offers the pin, hoping he will accept it as a gift of friendship.

The ape-man accepts the pin, attaching it to his leather armor, and admiring the leafy design and ornate craftsmanship. "Knife.. better for fighting," he says. "But this easier to conceal."

Nodding, Marina smiles. "Yes. And a treasure concealed is a treasure kept." She takes a step back, trying to lead him into the open. "Will you join us tonight?"

Looking around, Marina pauses for a moment. "Actually, we don't really know where to camp tonight. We ... have much to learn." She looks at the man again. "Do you know a good place to camp?"

The bestial ranger scratches his shaggy chin with one large hand, then points up at the Manse. "Why not there?" he asks. "Is sacred place of Cat God. But is also dry in rain."

Ramar prepares the meal. It's not the best of meals, but it's terribly edible. And that's what matters here. "What is your name, I wonder? If you don't mind sharing such information with us? Here... have some of this. It's... good, I hope?"

"Name? Am Non Valon. Non Tribe. Valon." The ape-man eats quietly, partaking of the group fare without comment or complaint.

Marina smiles at Valon. "Valon, I am Marina." She nods at each of the others in turn, naming them by first name only.

Chi-Yosh listens to Valon without speaking, just yet. Instead letting the big man enjoy his meal, before asking, "Are you welcomed into the territory of the Cat God's people?"

"Not cat. Not welcome. Come to see outsiders," the tracker replies around a mouthful of meat.

Ramar listens. He eats, peacefully, even as the sun moves through the sky above. He breathes in slowly, and exhales in a similarly relaxed manner. "I am pleased to meet you then, Valon. Why did you come to see the outsiders?"

Gallius sits in silence, though she does at least offer a nod to the stranger as she is named. The Lady's gaze strays upward and she surveys the sky, still listening to the conversation going on, though she's remaining distant from it, still.

"Curious if Cat God kill you soon," is the disconcerting reply.

Blinking, Marina turns to look at Valon directly, her hand suddenly gripping her eating knife quite tightly. "The Cat God, Valon?" She looks around the manse. "Why will he kill us, Valon?" She projects concern, and a little fear. Not deepseated fear, just the frisson that a statement like that would normally induce.

Davron raises both eyebrows. He opens his mouth as of to speak, but a glance from Marina silences his reply. Instead, he just cocks his head... for indeed he shares Valon's curiosity.

In answer, the ape-man gestures with one crudely-shaped hand toward the Manse beyond. "Man go in. Ghost come out. Tribe lay salt, stay safe. Soon, no more men come. Tribe happy."

"Which tribe, Valon?" Marina tilts her head. "Your tribe? Or the ghost's tribe?"

Ramar hmms. "The Cat Tribe then? How often have you watched them, Valon?"

"We lay salt. No tribe of ghosts. They all alone." The ranger gestures toward the knife he'd offered to Marina. "Not need that any more." The ape-man's unattractive head swivels to look at Ramar. "We watch since Mad Ones came out of Wyld, kill all. Tribes friends before, enemies after. Many seasons. Many, many seasons."

Ramar continues eating, though as his curiosity is made hungrier, his appetite is diminished. "I see." _They lay down the salt to prevent the ghosts from rising, as they might in a place with such Essence._ "Are there more of you, Valon? Did you have a tribe before that?"

Gallius hmms softly to herself, considering her spear for a moment, then looking towards the apeman. She looks towards Chi-Yosh. "Do you have a moment to spare? There's something I saw back in the forest, and I'd like you to explain it to me." Hint hint.

"Always have tribe," says Valon, sounding nonplussed.

Chi-Yosh draws up to his feet, nodding to Gallius. Setting his plate aside - food taken care of while he listened - the Exalt moves to stand by Gallius. "Surely."

Gallius will nod to those staying behind, "We'll be back in just a moment." Maybe she's dragging Chi-Yosh away due to loneliness? The world will never know! She does lead the way away from the camp, only stopping when she is out of view and definitely out of earshot.

Smiling, Marina nods at Valon, as her fingers trace out the design in the knife's hilt. "I think Ramar meant, Valon, if you were alone or if your tribe was near." She looks at Ramar, her eyes narrowed a little. "Although I could be mistaken."

"Tribe not make Cat God angry," replies Valon carefully. "Live far away. Keep scouts." He thumps his chest proudly through the armor.

Ramar swallows the bit of food he'd been eating. "Oh no... you're not mistaken. I believe you've got it right, that was indeed one thing I'd meant by it." He looks past Marina's narrowed eyes, and bows his head to the chest-thumping Ape-Man. "Indeed." He returns then, to eating his food.

Marina looks at the manse, then smiles. "We scouts too." She looks at her clothes, embroidered and fine. "Though some of us are not dressed well for that." She shrugs. "We seek the Cat God. One of our ... scouts has been challenged. He will undergo the trials of adulthood." She looks troubled, looking at the departing Chi-Yosh. "It is a debt of honour, and we do not know how to pay it."

Gallius leads Chi-Yosh well away from the camp, stopping once she's quite positive she can't be seen and certainly not heard. She says what she is thinking without a pause, "I think it rather odd that this apeman is here. I have a strong suspicion our guest may be the Lunar we seek. Perhaps this is another part of the test? I was hoping you might be able to find out, and I thought I should share my suspicion. It is better we both watch closely from now on."

Chi-Yosh is curious upon Gallius's desire for seclusion, but at her words, he can merely nod while gaze sweeps back towards Valon. "There is a faint scent of fish, yes." A glance back. "I have no way of knowing, how to find out. If it is the Lunar, then he intends to trick us. If it is he, then he is a great actor. He masters magic, and might be able to change his shape..." He frowns. "I do not know."

"I think these Lunars have no shape. They can be however they wish, it seems, and if they wished they could be an apeman.. perhaps they might even pretend to be one of us." Gallius finds that thought disconcerting, obviously. "In any case, we should not linger long. Let's see.. what is the official reason I called you out here. Perhaps to explain what a certain plant is? That sounds somewhat plausible, does it not?"

Chi-Yosh merely nods to her questions, and frowns. He does not know how strong of shifters they may be - they might just be an insect, watching overhead, or a snake waiting in the bush to strike at the foot. It is not a pleasant thought. "Perhaps your skin is itching where it will, and you wished to know if it was a plant's cause, and if there was anything to stop the itching?"

Gallius nods, "That seems good enough. Let's get back now, before we arose suspicion. I am going to keep a close eye on our friend, though I don't know how I can possibly find the answer I seek." She turns back towards the camp, starting to head back slowly.

".... eat grubs." Valon is explaining to Ramar, Davron and Marina, perhaps against their wishes, a few of the more common staples of Non diet.

Chi-Yosh returns, following the general-to-be without pause. He eases into the spot he had left, and wipes hands absently on the trousers, a glance to Davron, in hopes of earning what he might have missed.

After looking curiously at Chi Yosh and Gallius for a while, Marina turns back to Valon, and ponders ways to stop talking about larval foodstuffs, and instead talk of the Jaguar men. Finally, she decides a frontal attack is simplest. "Valon; what of the Jaguar men? Do they roam hereabouts?"

"Yes. This their land," says Valon. "We see them. They see us. Cat God awake now, we not fight. He sleep, we fight. So now peace. For short time."

Marina nods. "The Cat God ..." She pauses. "I think our young scout needs to find him." She sighs, visibly looking scared, not wanting to look directly at Valon. "We don't know, though, where he is."

Gallius just keeps listening, though the action hunger in her is getting more than a bit restless. It doesn't help that she's stuck in this bizarre place with nothing at all to do. She mutters under her breath, "The first test must involve sloth."

Valon thinks for a few moments (with evident effort), then leans forward. "Cat God have many gems, pretty things. You take them? Then Valon take you."

Chi-Yosh watches Valon, and gestures to himself once Marina mentiones the scout that needs to find him.

Marina looks confused. "Should we take the gems, Valon?"

Davron smiles at Gallius, overhearing this. "Or perhaps patience," he says quietly. "A hunter sometimes must wait for his quarry to approach close enough to be brought down..."

"Why not?" the bestial hunter asks, confused. "You reach for thing, you draw away, you not lose hand, thing in hand yours."

"Yes, Valon, but why do you want us to take the gems?" Marina looks confused, in a matriarchal kind of way.

"So Valon have them," replies the ape-man, smiling with pride. "Price for death, if Cat God find Valon lead strangers there."

Gallius raises an eyebrow at the response of the apeman. It's a good thing they don't have to hunt anything intelligent, else their tribe would be quite extinct. To Davron she says, "A hunter usually has an idea of what he hunts and more importantly why he hunts."

Ramar blinks then. "Gems..." He ponders. He remarks to no one in particular. "Well then... there's an answer. I am ready to go if you'd like, and I an also eager to learn more from you Valon. I thank you for sharing with us what you have. Perhaps after this business with the cat people has been settled, you would share more knowledge?"

"More... yes," says Valon, puzzling over what Ramar says. "Not go now. Return in morning, guide strangers, if strangers still alive." He rises to his feet, revealing an uncanny agility despite his rough appearance.

Standing, too, Marina nods. "Tomorrow, Valon."

Ramar rises to his feet as well. He bows slowly to Valon, showing respect for the ape-man. "Indeed. Sleep well, and we shall do our best to live through the night." To the others he asks, "Who shall take the first watch? And where do you propose we sleep? The Manse should afford us some safety..."

And with that, the simian scout retreats into the forest, ambling stealthily. He is unheard and unseen in less than a minute.

Chi-Yosh watches the Apeman rise. Not only is it a matter of hunting and finding what is needed in the forest, but fending and protecting oneself. And here is to hoping that can be done. Rising to his feet, "I will take the watch until Twilight."

Davron tilts his head. "I wonder what the... the Cat God would think of us sleeping in his Manse. But... we would need _some_ shelter, certainly. And we are already on his lands..."

Gallius says to Chi-Yosh, "I may join you for a few of those hours. I cannot sleep yet, and I certainly will not enter that place. I feel strange enough just being here." She'll be much happier to have the stars for her roof.

Ramar looks about. "I shall take the second watch. I recommend we all get the rest we need tonight. Tomorrow promises to be a most interesting day. I plan on sleeping in here... it is beautiful, and, it provides shelter. If you wish to have shelter elsewhere, I shall make one for those who wish it."

Marina nods at Ramar. "Please." She looks at the manse. "I'm not ready to become a ghost yet."

Chi-Yosh glances sidelong to Davron. "I am..." Searching for a word, "Attuned to this manse. If that means that it is mine, then you are all welcome inside, if that calms any." He looks outward. "It is a haven, and a place to be bottled up, sadly."

Chi-Yosh turns then to Marina. "If something crashes through the forest, and will not listen to reason, I ask that you go inside. There is no telling what might come out, and ... we cannot have one arm behind us and one arm in front."

Davron says, "If our friend has time to prepare, he can bottle us up anywhere he pleases. A Manse, at least, may be defensible. If you will sleep in the Manse, I will as well." He nods to Ramar. "But I will help you construct a shelter for Marina and Gallius, if they wish it."

Ramar smiles at Marina, "I shall then construct a shelter. As best as I can with what's available. Let me know where you would like it to be... and, I apologize if I was overeager with my questions earlier, Marina, I didn't mean to disturb your own interrogations."

"I do not think a shelter is needed for me," replies Gallius. "If our Lunar friend wanted to kill us, we would know about it already. And as for our odd friend.. well, I'd almost welcome a fair fight at this point. I will rest here near the Manse, that should be safe enough."

Marina smiles at Ramar. "Over yonder, under the forest's canopy?" She shrugs. "When too many people speak, a man may feel threatened and intimidated." She sighs. "It's not that I don't welcome your questions, it's that I didn't want to overwhelm him. Which reminds me, I had best find a new cloak pin."

Marina pauses a moment, looking at the manse. "Hold off, Ramar ... Come to think of it, no matter where we sleep, we should all sleep there, I think. So if it is to be inside the manse ..." She sighs. "Inside it is."

Gallius sets herself down near the Manse, finally deciding to ask, "Why are we here again?" She sighs, somehow managing a smile. "I imagine my father is terribly worried by now over my absence. I hope the people can be kept calm. My disappearance is ill-timed, with all the other rumors of war." She frowns thoughtfully, "Now I wonder when I will ever be able to return."

Ramar nods, "Indeed. Well then show me where you'd rather be. We are here to earn their respect, and to prove that we are indeed adults in the eyes of the jaguar men..." He shrugs. "If we are to survive the night perhaps we should do so outside of the Manse? To prove to the Jaguar People that we are more than mere children, relying on the devices of their Elders to survive in the environment which they obviously thrive within? Gallius, Marina, you guys are correct... let us camp outside then. Away from this place. Follow me."

Ramar heads out into the woods. It's not terribly hard, for they are in all directions. He glances about, taking note of a place near a clearing, though well out of the way. "Here. We'll sleep on the ground... hmmm, near these roots. The trees shouldn't hold too much to be worried about, and if we can, we'll dig in a little." He disappears for a moment, gathering some materials, and when he returns, after a few minutes, and with help from those who desire to help, a structure is built that seems to blend them in with the plants growing near the base of the tree, that they might be unseen during the night. "Now... we sleep."
