# Gods of Eden 2003-09-26

It is the evening before the party's departure for the forests of the east, and the Master has invited the newest arrival to join him aboard the flying vessel, the _Seagull_. Chi-Yosh, too, has been invited along, and silently the two left their respective quarters and made their way down to the docks. Now the boat is sailing slowly through the starlit waters of the Rock River, under the competent guidance of the older man. He strokes his dark hair with one hand, looking up into the night sky in silence. Finally he speaks: "Gallius. Chi-Yosh. The newest arrivals. I want to talk to you, together, about what all this means."

Gallius arrives in full gear as a matter of habit. In fact, she's rarely out of her armor, it seems. She stands on the deck with a mask of confidence to hide her doubts about where she is. "I would like to know what matter is important enough to draw me away from my father when he needs me most," she says simply. "I appreciate the rescue, but I have duties behind, as well."

Chi-Yosh is standing at the starboard side, watching the water flow beneath the boat, thick with moonlight like liquid glass. Attention shifts, though, to the Master as he begins to speak, and the Su'Katan moves closer. A glance to Gallius, then back to the Sidereal. A simple nod, acknowledgement, encouragement further.

"Gallius, the being you fought with is named Ma-Ha-Suchi. He is the Chosen of Luna, just as you are the Chosen of the Sun. Night and Day are not enemies; they are cycles, each complementing the other." The Master normally does not speak this much; Chi-Yosh, at least, can see the mask slipping away, the remnants of a mortal man hidden behind the grim facade of the merciless, foresighted authoritarian. "But, that cycle was disrupted, fifteen hundred years ago, in the Usurpation. It is not something that one often reads about. The Lunars... slaughtered their spouses, their lovers, their leaders. The Solars. They hacked them down, under...under the guidance of the Sidereal Exalted, the Chosen of the Five Maidens. Under our guidance." 'Under my guidance' seems ready to slip out, if the man's face is any indication, but he does not say it. Instead, he continues.

"Not all Lunars are so hate-filled as Ma-Ha-Suchi. Gallius, to serve your father, you must uncover the truth behind the movement of the barbarians of the south. It is clear that Ma-Ha-Suchi is involved somehow. You have a chance, tomorrow, to go among another of the Lunars. To learn their ways, perhaps. Do not go with hate in your heart. Go, seeking to learn more."

Gallius frowns thoughtfully, "If this leads to justice and safety for my people, it is a worthy cause," she answers. "But for the murder of so many good men, there is but one penalty in Roleyn, and if the chance comes to me, I will see it is carried out." She looks from the Master to Chi-Yosh. "How likely is it this other Lunar is going to be anything but a dangerous nuisance?"

Tomorrow they go to see a Lunar who is obviously hostile. Chi-Yosh looks out again over the water, frowning. While he has his honor, he does not know if the sorcerer does. Maybe, given his actions, or maybe it is merely that he sees things as property and territory, and that has been breached, and he is insulted. The Su'Katan is going to try and win their respect, but he must also wonder if they are respectable to begin with, or if he must instead not fool himself, not try to play the game by his thoughts and instead their rules. Gallius's words drag him back. "I... do not know. He could be a scorned upstanding leader. Or he could be harsh and feral despite intelligence."

"Luna's Chosen are as individual as any other man," says the Master, calmly enough. "If you, Gallius, can slay or otherwise punish Ma-Ha-Suchi, then you may do so, if you feel it is just. But right now, none of you alone are any match for him. And perhaps not even together." He sets the rudder in place, trusting the waters of the Rock River to carry the boat safely enough, and paces the deck. "This unnamed sorcerer may or may not be one of the old ones, the Lunars of the First Age. I know nothing of him. He may be ally, he may be enemy. He may even be both. But know this. You are the Chosen of the Unconquered Sun himself, the god of victory and strength. You can be the equal of any being in Creation. Show yourselves worthy of that choice."

Gallius turns to look at the sky, her hair lifting in the wind. "I did not chose this, but if the power is mine, I will use it well. I will grow and in the end, I will destroy Ma-Ha-Suchi for murdering my people, and trying to murder me not once, but twice. As for the sorceror, we will have to see what happens. I have little patience for these strangers that seek my death, though." She turns to the Master and asks, "What exactly do you wish of us? Why have you brought us here?"

Chi-Yosh scolds himself internally at the Master's words. He should not compromise his morals if the opposition has them or not. It is the integrity of keeping them that is the matter. While some may say honor is as useful as the enemy sees it, that does not save the respect of the man who dies without it. "He does not seek yours. He seeks what is rightfully his."

The older man smiles grimly. "You lie, Gallius. Each of the Chosen may reject the gift, when it is offered. I know you remember the voice of your patron." He paces further. "I protect the Solars, those called 'Anathema', that fall into my care. It is preached by the Realm that you are the enemy of all life, and it is believed by some. Certainly you are dangerous, but you are not mad demons. And yet the Realm sends its Hunt after you. Do you wish to see?"

Chi-Yosh watches the two, and at the older man's words, the fires within him are lit. He is not mormally wrathful, not driven to anger and desire for destruction. But those facts make his blood seethe. That those blessed by the Sun are hunted down for the sins of the past. That the Realm's power be left unchecked. Solars, new and old are hunted like scared rabbits. This, and only this he can despise beyond all else. And somewhere, he wants it gone, removed.

"I suppose I did," answers Gallius. "If you consider it a choice." She looks out again and sighs, "I had a choice, but I did not make it for myself, I do not think. I made it for wrath, for righteous wrath, I hope, but for wrath all the same. I wish to see the Hunt. Perhaps one day I will meet the Hunt head-on.."

"We," says Chi-Yosh. The words are determined, unyielding.

The _Seagull_ has drifted into a little cove, and has come to rest in the still waters. The timing is excellent; coincidental even. Par for the course for the Master. "Sit, then," he counsels. The man himself kneels on the deck, a darkened shadow in the gloom of the cove. He begins chanting softly, waving his hands in a ritualistic pattern, and from his body there springs a soft light - Essence being gathered, manipulated, shaped, given purpose. Then the light begins to move, forming pictures, making sounds.

Gallius sits, looking over at Chi-Yosh. She considers the man very carefully, critically even. "I wish to know you better before we fight side by side," she says softly. She turns back to see what the Master is preparing, her hands folding in her lap.

"Wishes are what they are," the Su'Katan replies. "We may not have that choice. Let us hope we do."

The light radiates outward, and the sound warbles and wavers into comprehensibility. The picture is of eight men, combing the woods. With a start, Gallius recognizes the place. It is the very battlefield where she nearly fell, before being driven ahead of Ma-Ha-Suchi's 'hunt'. The men are wearing the livery of the Realm, the Scarlet Empire whose hand clutches the throat of the world even as it struggles not to fall apart. All are armed. "She was here all right," reports one man, saluting another - the commander, certainly - with a crisp gesture. "The geomancy is clear."

Gallius watches closely, more curious than anything else. "So I am to die, and that, too, is just," she whispers softly. "I imagine I cannot return home now, even if my people wished to have one of my kind lead them, I could not let them die for me.. and what shall I tell Casus?" The young woman sighs, but does not let her expression waver from its serenity.

"Justice is what you make," rebukes the Master. "You are the Chosen of the Sun. With his blessing, your word is the law of Creation. He has stamped your judgement with his mark of approval. The Realm does not possess the Mandate of Heaven. You do. But you must earn your kingdom again, before you can rule it rightly."

Chi-Yosh's eyes lift from the scene depicted up to the Master. "How is it they know she was there? Has she left a... track in the Essence?" For a moment, he suddenly finds himself wary. But not at this moment, for the Master is with them, and suspects if they were to be assaulted by the Realm, the Master would not have led them there.

"The Hunt has many methods," remarks the Master, as the scene changes, following the men back to their horses. "Their leader may himself be a sorcerer, or have one such with him. Whatever the case, they will not follow you here, Gallius."

Gallius would almost enjoy a fight with those who hunt her. "I am glad that trail will lead them nowhere fast," she says gently. "I do not enjoy killing men, even those that deserve it. Death is a hard judgement, and it goes beyond all righting should the judgement be in error. Perhaps I might dissuade them from this task. I have found that I'm far more able than I was before."

Chi-Yosh considers something, for he knows it can say much. "Death is an inevitable. It is unstoppable. But some have it brought to them early, because of their choices. Some times, you need someone to bring it to them, for their choices are not what should have been."

"If it is your kingdom you fear for, Gallius, you need not worry. The Realm has the power to move against the kingdoms of the Scavenger Lands, but a squad of the Hunt will not incite trouble in such a fashion unless specifically ordered to." The Master sounds confident of this, at least.

"If they attacked my people, I fear I would have to do something unpleasant," says Gallius. "It may not be as dangerous to attack Roleyn as it was in the past, but we have allies that will not abandon us, and they do not love the Realm." She smiles thoughtfully, "But you brought me here as a.. general, did you not? I am to make an army? If I guess rightly, you wish for me to raise a banner and a force capable of destroying the Realm."

"It is not what I wish. It is what is written in your destiny," replies the Master, calmly. "Your nature, your true self, would not permit any other outcome. My role is to keep you alive and secure, to train you, until that time. Our creed is simple: Diplomacy by any means necessary. Until you are ready to leave my protection, you are with us."

"We cannot march on the Realm tomorrow. And we cannot do it alone." Chi-Yosh looks back to where the motes had been, the scenery gone. "The Realm is powerful, and does many horrible things, but they cannot be stopped for perhaps decades. And not just by us, but by many, many like us. Ma-Ha-Suchi is a powerful thing, and there are no doubt those out there with his skill. If we banded those like us together..."

"We must divide and destroy our enemies," says Gallius. "I can raise an army. In time, I may be able to make a force unlike any the world has seen, but such things take time and money and willing hands." She looks to Chi-Yosh and smiles, "Ma-Ha-Suchi can die, and that is what matters. We have to act with patience and daring. If our enemies can unite, then our hope dwindles. How many of us are there? I imagine it is more than just a few."

Chi-Yosh nods simply. "It is good that we have many, many years ahead of us to cultivate the neccessities. The first men you train may die of old age before our weapons are raised in unison against the Realm. But by that time, I can only hope we have carved the Realm's power enough that it cannot withstand our thrust."

Gallius smiles, "Perhaps that is so. Perhaps we might win by tearing the foundation of the Realm away, making war unnecessary. The best use of an army is to frighten those around you. Just like carrying a spear.. especially if you don't know how to use it, you must have the most violent looking one you can find." She laughs softly at this, turning to stare off the ship, "So we are to.. what? Rule the world, then?"

The Master smiles softly. "Precisely. The Unconquered Sun has chosen you as his Exalted. That simply means that he approves of how you WOULD rule, and thus has given you the power to do so. That is all. It is the mandate of Heaven."

"That sounds strange to me," says Gallius. "I do not feel that I am worthy of it, but I will try my best. The rule of my people was honor more than I deserved, but now it seems that I must extend even further. I wish Kirri still was alive, then I could be certain and know that Roleyn would be stable even should I die."

Chi-Yosh reaches forward, placing his fingers on Gallius's shoulder. "You were born with the mantle of queen on your shoulders, were you not? And you accept that, happily, feverishly. But you have been born again, with a larger mantle. You will grow to accept that with ferociousness too."

"In a way," answers Gallius. "But when my sister was born, the mantle was her's. But.. she passed away, and the role I had prepared myself for as her mentor and advisor was swept away, leaving me to carry the weight of two. Now it seems that another world is calling. I will do my best to serve, but I also must protect my people. I hope both are possible at the same time." The Lady sounds fairly confident, despite her uncertain words. "I think my people are loyal enough to follow me, even when they learn what I am. They dislike the Realm, in any case."

"You have the power," replies the Master quietly. "What you must supply is the wisdom, and the virtue, to use it."

"Those will come only in time, and only in errors," says Gallius. "My father said that wisdom comes to those who live through their mistakes. Since I have already died once, I think I may come farther faster. I hope so. I do not have the luxury of time."

The Master moves to the controls of the little vessel, and once again begins steering it, guiding it from the safety of the cove and using its arcane engine to propel the craft up-river, back toward Nane.

Lady Gallius rises, moving to the front of the ship. She gazes ahead, letting her hair fly free. Her helm she holds at her side. For now, she is confident and certain. The future may lie ahead, but her feet might as well already have traversed its roads, for now she knows the way she must go.
