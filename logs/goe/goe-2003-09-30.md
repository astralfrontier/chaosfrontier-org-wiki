# Gods of Eden 2003-09-30

The night is just growing dark as Gallius returns with Chi-Yosh. The two head their separate ways when they arrive back at their new home. Gallius seeks her room, first, but after that it will be time to tend to her horse.

"Can't sleep?" Asks Ramar, as he watches Gallius walk through the corridors within the mountain hideaway. "Or are you simply lost..."

"Lost in ways that midnight wandering can't solve," she replies, smiling. "I can't sleep until I make sure that Wingfoot is alright. He had a bit of a snuffle earlier, and it's got me quite worried. He's the finest horse in all of Roleyn." She sighs and frowns, looking rather like a fretting mother.

"You would be surprised at what paths make themselves known when all the rest of the waking world sleeps." Ramar hops down from the stony seat he'd been perched upon and gestures down one path. "As for where Roleyn's likely to be kept, I should say he's down this way. I'll show you if you'd like." Ramar turns, as though he were to head down the passage, and waits, looking to Gallius for his cue.

"I would appreciate that," says Gallius. "Though I think I know the way to Wingfoot, I would rather not take an extra turn and get myself lost." It is probably noticed about this time that she is bearing a small pack, the kind that might hold herbs.

"Ah, so it is Wingfoot who is your horse, and he does not take his name from the land he is from?" Ramar asks this question, as curiosity rises in his voice. "I am all too glad to guide you there. You'll get used to it eventually... it's a bit confusing at first, as I'm sure you know." Ramar leads the way down the familiar twisting hallways that connect various areas together.

Gallius follows quickly, muttering under her breath, "Apply a handful to the chest and two fingers to the chin.. I hope this works." More clearly, she says, "Wingfoot was a gift from my father. He was given to me before my younger sister died, when it seemed that my destiny was to be her advisor and general."

The ghostly hint of a saddened smile seems to linger on Ramar's face for a moment. "I hadn't known. You were to be an advisor? What position was your Sister to hold, before your duty had been changed? I'm still uncertain as to your position, if you do not mind such an inquiry." With a simple change in direction, the room where Wingfoot is stabled comes into view.

"My younger sister Kirri was to be the Queen," says Gallius. "Our line followed a pattern that is unique, as far as I know. It is a line of youngest children, alternating between men and women. So one generation will be a king, the next a queen. Fate has kept our line this way for some time, the words of the seer have withstood the test of time." The Lady Gallius adds softly, "Now that line is rather damaged, so I shall be Queen." The Lady is more relaxed when she sees Wingfoot, and far more comfortable yet when she can hear his clean breathing.

"I see. You then, have been chosen for this duty. I would say, that there is more to it than simply that. I would even go as far as to say... ah... but we neglect Wingfoot." Ramar gestures towards Wingfoot, "He seems alright...though I wonder..." Ramar takes a few slow, peaceful steps toward the animal, hands held out to the creature, displaying the fact that he is harmless, at least to this creature. "Hello there Wingfoot. I am Ramar. I am pleased to meet you."

The horse is passive enough, though it is clearly a warhorse, large and powerful. "Wingfoot is very calm when he's in a stall," says Gallius. She moves over to the horse, stroking one of his flanks, "Soon we'll get to ride, I promise," she whispers. She opens her pack, then, and a strong smell pours from it. The horse's snorts draw a chiding remark from the Lady. "You will take your medicine and no more complaining!" She reaches into the pouch and draws out some kind of pasty gel, the source of the odor.

The grin is unable to remain hidden in Ramar's voice as he suggests, with a wink towards Wingfoot. "Perhaps if you took some of the medicine yourself, it would help Wingfoot to realize that it is in fact good for him, and not in fact, as deadly or horrible as it smells..."

"Perhaps Ramar should do so, as well?" suggests Gallius. The Lady laughs and holds some of it under her nose, inhaling deeply. "It actually does work almost as well as mistleberry, though it smells a bit different. I'm not master of herbs, but I have had to use these kinds of mixtures before."

"It would only seem fair. Although I am neither sick, nor am I a horse." Ramar wrinkles his nose at the strong scent. "I cannot say I am a master of herbs as well. I do know a little, however, namely their uses in preparing food or aiding in the healing of wounds. Chi-Yosh seems to know the most of any of us though, should you have questions for him."

"He took me to a man who knew of herbs, and this seemingly is the closest thing to mistleberry, which is used in Roleyn." Lady Gallius laughs softly, applying the stuff to Wingfoot, whose protests quickly fade. "See? It's not bad at all, now is it?" When the horse snorts in her face, Gallius draws away and laughs, "Alright, alright, I won't put any on your chin then."

"I wouldn't know what mistleberry does." Ramar reaches over, taking a bit of the medicine on his fingers. He then nods to Wingfoot, "If I go through this, you are as well. It seems to be her opinion that it will help you... so..." He gestures to his chin, and moves his hand to smear the strongly-scented medicine thereupon. Though he stops, in the nick of time, "Or does it not need to be put there?"

Gallius takes a bit of the medicine and smears it under her chin. "This is most odd, putting on this medicine now. But it does help against illness of the lungs and nose, so it can't really hurt to use it." She adds almost casually, "I don't think it will cause any harm, anyway. At worst you will have a very clear head from it."

The night has come and gone, and another day is here. It's early when Gallius first arises, stepping out of her room before the first rays of the sun spill upon the ground. She is dressed the same as always, her armor seemingly part of her normal wardrobe no matter where she is.

"Good morning," greets Ramar. He's walking down the hallway at that precise moment, garbed differently. He's wearing a simple outfit, typical of that worn in the desert. "To bed late and up even earlier?"

Gallius nods to Ramar, "I always rise early. It seems such a waste when I wake up and the sun is already up. I hate to lose valuable time. It never seems I have enough." She at least doesn't have a bag of herbs for the horse, this time. "I was thinking of going for a ride, then exercising a bit. I don't want to get rusty."

"Time." Ramar repeats the word. "An interesting concept, time. There are many ways of interpreting it. Like you, many people place value within it. Or rather they place value on what is done during the time they have. What makes you feel you waste it? It is my belief, that so long as you are alive, and able to appreciate the world around... there is no such thing as wasted time."

"Perhaps," replies Gallius. "But there are many important things to do, and when I am not doing them, or preparing myself for them, I feel the time is wasted." The Lady considers for a moment, then says, "Would you care to join me? Unless of course you have other matters to see to."

"If you spend your life preparing to do important things, or doing important things, when then, will you take the time to do those things which are not important, yet need to be done in any case? One's whole life cannot be spent doing things. Or perhaps it can be. I am unsure." Ramar shrugs, then offers a smile. "I should be glad to join you. I have no other matters to see to."

"We will see if it can," replies Gallius. She leads the way towards the stable where Wingfoot is kept, fortunately not taking any wrong turns on the way. "Miracles never cease, I didn't get lost," she murmurs.

It's fairly easy for Ramar to follow after Gallius. He takes his time, gaze drifting across the walls of the passages as he wanders. "Miracles never cease, I concur. They are simply seldom noticed by others, until they are large enough that they matter to more than one person." Ramar gives Wingfoot a nod, "Good morning Wingfoot."

The horse snorts loudly, shaking its head a bit and stamping a foot. "Oh now, it wasn't that long," says Gallius. She scolds the horse with a smile, "And see, you feel better, don't you? You should always take medicine and be good." She gets to work readying the horse, though, brushing him quickly, then readying his saddle.

"I'm curious. How long will it take for the herbs to remedy Wingfoot's ailment? A snuffle, you called it, I believe." Ramar nears the horse, bowing his head in greeting. He quirks an eyebrow when Gallius readies the saddle, and his head tilts to one side as he studies the contraption.

"It wasn't very serious, just a light cold, you might say. He occasionally gets them, and they rarely last long. I just get what he needs and everything is right back to normal," Gallius explains calmly. "Do you ride, Ramar? I always feel that everyone does, but I've been told in some lands there are people who do not even have a horse."

Ramar smiles. "Do I ride?" His smile is a curious smile, as though some hidden thought were being kept from display. "I am unsure. Perhaps, I might, if you let me try." He glances once more at the saddle, curiously. "Although perhaps Wingfoot will only accept one rider..."

"Wingfoot is trained to let me ride, or those I allow to ride him," says Gallius. "If a thief were to come to him, though, it would be.. unpleasant for them." She laughs softly, her mind drifting to the past. "Poor Gari learned that the hard way, thinking he could teach an imperious girl a thing or two."

"Gari?" Ramar turns his head back towards Gallius, while offering a hand to Wingfoot, that the horse might sniff it if it were desired. That an apple is contained in said hand is probably more important. "You'll forgive me for asking who Gari is, as I do not know your past in it's entirety. Although I suspect that if I began speaking of Hovan, you would not know of whom I spoke."

"And the dapples have very strong hindquarters, good for jumping," calls a voice just toughened with adolescence. Behind the top of his red head comes a bail of hay on shoulders, shielding the one behind it.

"I'm sorry, I drift into memories from time to time. Gari is a horsethief who became one of my most loyal friends," explains Lady Gallius. "He's kind of like a mix of older and younger brother. He tends to be very protective of me." She falls silent as she sees that she and Ramar are not alone. Wingfoot, for his part, is interested quite a bit in that apple, nuzzling at Ramar's hand and then biting into the fruit.

"I see. Well then, to an old friend." Ramar glances in the direction towards the red-headed bale of hay. "Good morning," he says, before offering the apple up a bit higher. When Wingfoot nuzzles at his hand, he's quick with the other one, petting the horse's head. As he does this, he turns, peering a little more curiously at the redheaded bale of hay.

"And the white one over there, he's a breed not from around here. Don't know where, but it's not normal." The red head turns towards the others, or rather, the top of the head does. Hay bails drop out of sight behind the boy, before his head comes down aswell.

Gallius nods to Ramar, "Old friends are good." As more than just an afterthought, she adds, "But new friends are always welcome. I have a feeling we're going to be relying on each other quite a bit in the future." Wingfoot ignores the commotion caused by the walking hay bails and continues working on that apple.

Ramar explains. "The five of us will depend heavily on one another. Much as the five corners of the world rely upon one another for support and strength and bearing their respective burdens. Or at least that is one way of looking at it."

The other side of the barn is quiet. Or atleast, tries to be quiet. It sounds like someone is sneaking around one side, towards the pair. But with Wingfoot in a center stall, this attempted sneak is coming from the other side. However, far too close to Wingfoot's stall nearest to the two Solars, the duo hear an audible **thump**, "Ow."

Gallius arches an eyebrow, "I have a feeling we're being watched." She laughs softly, moving to see just who or what is trying to sneak about so early in the morning.

"Of course we are." Explains Ramar, as he rests his hand on the hilt of his sword, simply making sure it's there. He raises his hand, and leaves the rest of the apple for Wingfoot, as he joins Gallius in investigating the stealthy... or not so stealthy... noise.

Chi-Yosh is standing in the middle of the stall aisle, rubbing the side of his cheek and glaring over at the bottom of a rake sticking out from one of the stalls. He looks up, and can only spread his hands. "Ha! Horse thieves!" bellows a boy as he throws himself half over the wall of Wingfoot's stall... to find no one inside. "Oof."

Ramar explains. "Chi-Yosh, you've got to remember to step around rakes. Just the same, it is good to see you. Why were you back here, though, I wonder?" He sniffs, "It's likely not for the smell..."

Gallius shrugs and looks at Ramar. "Is it normally like this here?" she murmurs. Wingfoot snorts loudly inside the stall, and the boy is suddenly eye to eye with a large, curious war horse.

"I needed help with the hay. He can carry them two at a time," Replies the red head. "Woah boy." He gives Wingfoot's nose a rub, then climbs up to stand on the top of the stall walls. He balances himself and walks out towards the pair. Chi-Yosh can simply shake his head and draw towards the pair. "Out for a ride?" He questions Gallius, "Or just checking on Wingfoot?"

"I cannot say what is normal for here, unfortunately. Nor can I say what is normal for elsewhere. It is merely that I know it is like this now." He ndos towards the red-head, "Although I assure you, we are not horse-thieves." He turns to Chi-Yosh, then to Gallius, curious as to the answer.

Gallius nods to Chi-Yosh, "We were thinking of riding a bit. Maybe you could join us? I'm rather light, so Wingfoot can manage it, as long as we don't try to gallop anywhere." She grins and nods, "We are not horse-thieves."

Chi-Yosh grins good naturedly. "This is true. But the boy and I were going to have some fun..." He just turns and mock-glares at the rake again. Though, at Gallius's question, he seems almost reluctant. "Ah... well, will I be riding behind you? I have never rode on a horse." "So I have to do the hay by myself," concludes the stable boy.

Ramar explains to the stable boy, "Nonsense. I shall help you with the hay. What precisely needs to be done with it?" He then nods towards Gallius. "Indeed. It might be interesting. Though I am unsure if Wingfoot could take on three riders. I may have to attempt this on a separate horse." He then turns back to the stable boy, waiting for further instructions.

The boy seems enthused now. "Great! There's a wagon outside that's Filled with haybails, right up to your neck. And they want me to do it all by myself. I mean, I'm strong and all," He sideglances to Gallius, "But I'm no Immaculate, so... Come on, I'll show you." He jumps off the stable rail and jogs down the aisle.

"It's not always the easiest to start on a rather spirit war horse, anyway," says the Lady. "We should all help. It's good to do a bit of work early in the morning, and many hands make light of loads, it is said." Gallius will follow, as well. She adds to Chi-Yosh, "Besides, I dislike letting others tend to Wingfoot. He's not a possession, he's more like a brother."

The Solars and the stable boy who declares himself Thayen make short work of the wagon full of hay, getting it taken care of in record time. This, of course, frees up Thayen's schedule, and he runs off to harass the local boys. With that taken care of, the three mount up, Gallius and Chi-Yosh to Wingfoot, and Ramar to another steed, head out of the stables, and into the morning light, elsewhere bound.

Ramar mounts his steed, though only after he has spoken soft words with it and relieved it of it's saddle and other such burdens. A smile is on his face as he heads out of the stable. "So where shall we head to my friends?"

Gallius shrugs at Ramar, keeping Wingfoot in-check, lest the beast take his full head and charge off. "Somewhere away from the city, maybe? Is there a place where we can work out a bit? I was thinking of taking a bit of practice with the bow today so I don't completely lose my vision."

Looking around, Ramar grins, "We are already far removed from any city... however... I know of a place..." He then lets his knees guide his horse as he steers it off towards the North. The horse begins gathering speed, and he heads through the forest, leaping over a low branch and when he lands, he is no longer sitting astride the horse, but rather standing atop it, for a brief moment. He lets a loud cheer resound, before he once more takes his seat, guiding the horse quite skillfully through the woods.

Chi-Yosh takes a deep breath, watching the world from the saddle, smiling a touch, although he has to brace on Gallius's shoulders a little. He is used to holding his balance on tree limbs, but a horse is a new business, especially without the stirrups that the woman has. Though, watching Ramar over the woman's shoulder, he murmurs close to her ear, "Bet you a jade he'll hit his head on a branch."

Gallius laughs softly, "Men must always show off, it seems." As for the bet, she says, "If he hits his head, the Master will probably never let us hear the end of it." She presses in with her heels, letting the horse have its head, and soon the thunder of his hooves is all she can clearly hear as she rushes through the wood and after Ramar.

Ramar rides along, his face exuberant as the wind rushes past him. His voice is echoed upon the wind as he rides on, and he is at ease on the horse as he is when merely standing on steady ground. He speaks in the horses ear, and it breaks into a slight gallop. He guides the horse effortlessly, his head kept close to the horse's. Every now and again he looks up, checking behind him to make sure that the others are keeping up with him. He only does this when there are no branches visible, however, and he's sure to keep his head low.

Keep up? Of course Wingfoot can keep up. He's a lot finer a horse than the local stock, that is certain. "So, Chi-Yosh, are you enjoying the ride so far?" asks Gallius. The horse has a knack for choosing a good path, it seems, avoiding jolts that other animals just blunder through.

Holding closer to the woman, "It's... a little quick!" He says, calling over the bounding horse. It's also a little awkward trying to hold the woman without being too... impolite. Now, while he personally is more focusing on holding on then anything, it's a matter of her comfort. "You mentioned working out. Do you have weapons in the bags on the saddle?"

Eventually the two horses will come to a rather beautiful clearing. There is the soft babbling sound of a creek running, and the scent of a recent rain still lingers in the air. The trees have grown around the rocky bank somewhat unevenly. The grass grows freely here, and flowers are still in bloom. This place is peaceful, quiet, and large enough to be used for many a purpose. At present the sun is high in the sky, casting shadows along the ground, and every so often, a cool breeze whips through the area, rustling the grasses. "Ahhh. Here we are..." says Ramar, as his horse turns and he hops from his horse, doing a slight flip as he dismounts. "We have arrived. And I hope you'll forgive me for... how did you put it... showing off as all men must? I prefer to think of it as enjoying the ride."

"Boasting, boasting," murmurs Gallius. She helps Chi-Yosh off first, then slips from her saddle. "There are tools on the horse, yes. I thought we might wish for some kind of filler for an otherwise empty day." She naturally had to keep the practice spear out, since that can't precisely fit in a saddlebag. "In any case, it's good just to be away for a while. I miss being on my own."

Chi-Yosh finds himself happy to be on the ground. He is merely unused to riding the horse, but finds himself more comfortable with the _Seagull_ as opposed to the natural animal that is Wingfoot. He looks over the clearing, nodding his head, content with the place.

"My apologies for boasting then." Ramar bows his head apologetically. He nods to his horse, who is busy drinking from the creek. "I hope this place will do. Er... tools on the horse? What sort of tools have you brought? I have little in the way of tools with me, save what I carry within my robes. Although there are many edible plants and fruits nearby."

"Just a few simple things," says Gallius. She gestures to a saddlebag, "In here should be enough food for a decent lunch, as well as a few things I use when I'm trying to work out. I tend to train heavily with weapons when I'm away from patrols. It's important to keep yourself sharp and prepared."

Chi-Yosh looks over the saddle bag, and inspects the practice swords. There are a few different ones, and extracting two, the Su'Katan steps back, swinging the pair. He tests their weight, how well they move in his hands. While one is curved, another is straight. The style of the curved weapon he's familiar with, to an extent; since his dreams, he has trained with the weapon of the Wyld Warrioress. But for now... both will do.

Ramar ahs. There's a slight sadness in his eyes. "I see. Weaponry training... it is necessary, although I am ill-prepared for this sort of thing at present. Unless you happen to have a lighter sword, like my own." He brushes his hand across the hilt of his sword, worn on his left side. He then gazes off into the distance, fingers tapping idly as clouds roll by above.

Gallius nods thoughtfully, "I may have something that will work.. I tend to keep a fairly simple assortment." She sets aside her spear, drawing out a more thin practice blade. "Do you prefer long or short blades, Ramar? Since this is only practice, they all tend to be rather light."

Chi-Yosh watches Ramar's dissapointment, and props down one of the weapons, leaning on it while he regards the Eclipse. "You were expecting something else, Ramar?" The man is so happy for peace, he cannot begrudge him.

"I prefer a long blade... I was aught," explains Ramar, "To use a slashing, or a fencing sword, if you will." That odd curiosity of his tinges his voice, though after a moment, he heads over to check the assortment of weaponry. His brows raise as he peers at the practice weapons, and a distant look comes over his eyes. He snaps out of it when Chi-Yosh speaks. "Ah, no, I can honestly say I was expecting nothing whatsoever, save to enjoy the day, which I will thoroughly. I simply wish such training weren't so absolutely necessary." He smiles, "Yet it is... for now. Someday things will be different... but until then... I believe I would not mind sparring with you two."

"We should probably focus on learning to work together," suggests Gallius. "I'd imagine all of us know how to fight on our own, but groups that do not train together die together. I have a feeling that soon we will be tested." The Lady opts for the spear, as usually, though it would seem she's trained with all of these before, as they all have seen use. "And then maybe a bit of archery practice. I'm not a very great shot, but I don't want to lose what little skill I have."

Chi-Yosh nods his head, and smiles to Ramar. "Very well." He flexes his fingers, squeezing, and then spreads them. His weapons sweep side to side, testing, and then he nods. "No special capabilities," He adds. "No telling who may watch." He walks out into the center of the clearing, and simply watches the two, before raising the weapons, and urges them with a beckons from either sword while dropping into a crouch.

Chi-Yosh adds, "I want the two of you to attack me. Work together the best you can, at finding holes in my defense. Don't let me tap you."

"Learning to work together is well enough, I suppose. It is something we'll all have to learn eventually. We may as well practice it now." Ramar shakes his head a moment, chuckling. "A... well I'm no good at archery. I doubt I could hit anything." He then turns to Chi-Yosh, "Very well. I shall do my best, Gallius? You will likely be better than I." He whirls his practice sword for a moment, before settling it into a somewhat ready position. He nods to Chi-Yosh, saluting him with his blade.

Gallius looks over at Ramar and then back to the task at hand. "I figure flanking is always in order." She will move forward with Ramar, stepping away from him and towards Chi-Yosh. It will be good training all-around, at this rate.

Gallius nods to Ramar, then moves in to strike, using the practice weapon as she would her regular naginata, first to stab, then to slice.

Chi-Yosh leans to the side as the jab comes in, sweeping his sword beneath the spear, not to parry, but to ward the woman off, dancing away from the sword's slash, while keeping wary of Ramar.

Ramar waits a moment. He observes Gallius strikes, and when she moves in, he is near enough, ready to block any counterattack from Chi-Yosh. As soon as Chi-Yosh begins a sweeping slash with the sword, he brings his sword around in a controlled curve, coming just along the edges of Gallius' spear and Chi-Yosh's sword.

Chi-Yosh's wariness is far too late, and he recieves a thorough slash across the chest from Ramar's weapon. He looks a touch surprised, and nods. "Good, good." He then steps back once more, and taps his weapons together. "Now, do it again. If I tap one of you, you're out." A nod. "Come get me. Quicker this time. Don't let me anticipate."

Ramar swings his sword as soon as Chi-Yosh is tapping his weapons together. It's a brief, testing little thrust that is made with the tip as he draws back to his original readied stance, but it is an attack just the same, and meant to draw his blades in one direction as well, that Gallius might come at him from the other side with her spear...

Gallius tries her luck again with Chi-Yosh, finding the man slippier than a snake the first time, this time around she dives in, only to draw back and then strike suddenly once Ramar draws Chi-Yosh's attention away.

Chi-Yosh, as Ramar comes forward, does a curt spin, and brings his foot right underneath the hilt of the practice weapon. Instead of kicking it from his hand, he knocks it towards Gallius. At the same time, his sword lashes out towards Ramar, before both feet find the ground, to face Gallius.

Gallius draws away, feeling the spear meet Chi-Yosh at the side. A sound blow, but fortunately nothing that got out of control. "You move like a serpent," she says to him, and the words are compliments. "I doubt I will have that kind of luck again."

Chi-Yosh grins a little bit at that, and salutes the woman, acknowledging the blow. "Good work. Now..." He steps back, readying again, before jumping towards Gallius in a sword's stroke.

Ramar was quite ready for Chi-Yosh's sword-stroke. He'd been tapped out, however, he's decided to pick this time to step in. His sword is interposed with Chi-Yosh and Gallius. "Mind if I cut in," asks Ramar.

Gallius takes the opportunity Ramar's parry gives her and strikes out at Chi-Yosh, this time aiming lower, though she fully commits to attack, holding nothing back. She rather doubts her chances of hitting anything but air if she does anything less.

Chi-Yosh sees the workings of Gallius's shoulders, but more over sees the trails of Essence move towards him. He leaps backwards, tossing the straight sword at Ramar in an underhanded thrust, while the curved sword is brought downward in both hands, striking the tip of Gallius's blade and driving it downward. He dances back, sweeping the weapon side to side, and stands his ground.

Ramar's weapon is brought low, attempting to block the sword, yet he parries to fast, and the straight sword hits him, albeit lightly as he watches Chi-Yosh. He grins, wryly, "I am not the only one showing off, I daresay."

Chi-Yosh can only smile. "It's a game. The matter of the game, for me, is to defend, and get you both out. The game for you both is to ensure I do not win." He beckons with his sword.

Ramar nods, "Which is of course why you have it easiest. It is the attacker who must actually succeed, the defender has merely to stay alive to win the game. And I am afraid that the two of us, together, are little challenge." He puts his sword down, and takes a crosslegged seat. A smile is on his face, "I shall watch, and perhaps learn. And take a turn on my own in a moment."

Gallius nods to Chi-Yosh. "You are quite skilled. This time, I think we will have to be more hasty, though I doubt I'd be this reckless in most situations." The lady suits her words by attacking Chi-Yosh swiftly, testing defenses as best she can.

Chi-Yosh is prepared for the spear's forward dart. Sword gripped in both hands reverts to a grip in one; an inverse, the blade's inner curve swerving along his forearm. And as the spear comes forward, he hops aside, and then forward himself. Spinning curtly on one foot, he dips, bringing the practice blade in a brush across Gallius's side. As the spin comes to an end, he stands behind and beside the spearmaiden, blade in both hands, poised for another strike. Or more accurately, ready for Ramar to jump him.

Gallius sighs and shrugs, "Perhaps I will have better luck next time.. or better luck from the back of Wingfoot." She steps away, taking a bit of a breather and sparing some of her attention on her horse. "Do you think we'll be with the Master for a long time?" she asks.

Chi-Yosh smiles a little bit. "I offer a bit of advice, Gallius. First, do not lead head first into your oponent. Size him up, let others attack him first, or wait until he attacks you, and you defend. You get to see how he fights, how he moves, and anticipate what he will do. Next, go for more variation then a forward lunge. Your first attack, the stab-slash, very good. Perhaps start with a high slash and then crouch and stab upward." A glance towards Wingfoot. "I... think it would hurt if you hit me from atop him."

Gallius grins at Chi-Yosh, "I have never been in a battle where I was not on a horse," she explains. "I much prefer to ride, it allows for more effective attacks, I have found."

Ramar ponders. He watches. "Interesting. Chi-Yosh, you actually seemed to be dodging out of the way better when both Gallius and I were attacking you." His eyebrow is quirked, though to Gallius he explains, "I believe we will be with him for as long as we are meant to. At least that is what he says. You never know, really."

Chi-Yosh nods to Ramar. "I do better with multiple oponents... It's reflexive. I do not know why... With a single combatant, I... focus more? I do not know." He then sets the practice sword aside, and nods. "I suspect he knows."

Gallius hmmss, "I wish he would treat us with more respect." She collects the practice swords from Chi-Yosh and Ramar, putting them away. "I have trouble following orders when I'm treated like a child. I only tolerate that from one man." After a short pause, the Lady blushes for some reason and adds, "Well, perhaps two.."

"To him," Chi-Yosh explains, "We are children. Children with... our gift. And we must master it, and until we have, we cannot support ourselves. He wishes for us to learn, and not be fed the answers we want, but to discover them. That way they mean more."

"Chi-Yosh is correct. And these gifts we have are dangerous. We do not know to use them to their full extent, and in some ways we are unaware of what we are capable of. He has. It may be that is one reason he treats us as he does, though I have never felt anything but respect coming from the Master. We are a family, after all... some people have other ways of expressing themselves..." Ramar gestures dismissively. "Although I cannot be certain how you feel. You are new. You've not had the time to adapt. You will get used to it in time."

"Perhaps," murmurs Gallius. "Whatever happens, though, it was a pleasure to know both of you. Soon I have a feeling we will be in the thick of things, and then.. what will come, will come. I hope only to fulfill now the words of a seer who died long ago. I begin to wonder just how much he knew of what would happen."
