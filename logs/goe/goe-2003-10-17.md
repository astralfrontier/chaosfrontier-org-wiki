# Gods of Eden 2003-10-17

Chi-Yosh walks among the forest to watch the animals about him, waiting for their reactions. He has been walking around for hours. So far, he has been Weeping Prowler's guest for two days. Earlier in the morning, Ramar and he had taken the boat out - the Eclipse wanting to reaquaint himself with the ship - to collect the warrior's hearthstone. For the rest of the day, he has been practicing with the stone. There is a way to simply not be noticed by all around, to only be spotted in the corner of the eye. But taking a break, the man now seeks out his host.

Prowler has returned from the forest with one of his "lieutenants", an enormous figure. The man is another product of potent magic, standing twelve feet tall and powerfully muscled. His entire body appears as a human-formed tyrant lizard might, and his eyes are dark and dangerous. They now stand together at the edge of the lake that rests beneath the mansion, looking out over the water. The sorcerer himself inclines his head in a casual greeting as he catches sight of the Solar.

Chi-Yosh watches the great beastman, and is just a bit intimidated. So powerful and dangerous, and if he is any like the man from the river... The Su'Katan drifts to the edge of the pond, while dipping his head to return the gesture. "Is it a painful thing, to merge one with a great creature?"

The hybrid glances at his master for approval; Prowler gives the faintest nod. Only then does the great lizard-man speak. "It is a great thing," he rumbles in a deep bass. "It is strength. I won the right to receive this sorcery for my victories."

"It is a worthy prize," Chi-Yosh agrees. "Do you rule as your master is sleeping?"

The hybrid bows his head in mute deference to his master, and Prowler speaks. "They govern. I rule. This generation of warriors produced some fine leaders and chieftains, and I have chosen to reward the bravest and most loyal with greater power. But they have always abided by my wishes."

Chi-Yosh takes a breath, his eyes drifting from the chieftan to the master. They do not appreciate ghosting across the edges. "The man in the river. He was a worthy champion."

"I am glad you speak so of him," replies the sorcerer, as his eyes turn again to regard the placid surface of the lake. "I do not like to think I bestow my blessings or mercy upon the undeserving."

"It took four warriors of the Sun to defeat one of your people's finest warriors. That is a great accomplishment." There is a moment of hesitation. "If you were going to leave us in the woods alone, then why did you send your champion to face us?"

"I was aware of your coming via magic. You acquired a guide I had not counted on. The man asked for the privilege of turning you back or defeating you, and I gave it to him." Prowler seems unconcerned with casually discussing matters such as having his guests murdered, and the hybrid lieutenant's face betrays no emotion.

Chi-Yosh says, "It was his choice then." A bit of silence, once more. "I wish to speak on Lesell." A tilt of his head towards the tyrant-hybrid, as if to ask if it si best to talk of matters with lieutenant.

"Speak on then," suggests the sorcerer calmly. The sorcerous amalgam makes a brief sign with his enormous hands, and the sorcerer waves one hand dismissively, mumbling something in a strange and guttural dialect. The lieutenant lopes away, heading back into the woods that surround the lake on all sides.

Chi-Yosh is more at ease, though words are chosen carefully. "In the First Age, many mated pairs ended like your experience. A thing of pain and mercy." His words are soft, almost concerned, while eyes rest upon the lake. "The wound is still raw. I can see it in your eyes and face."

The sorcerer does not reply, nor does he tense up, defensively. He simply waits, recognizing the obviousness of the opening words, waiting for more to come. Across the lake, a brief breeze stirs the still waters into small waves that dash across the surface.

Chi-Yosh's words must tred careful on the brittle surface of one's heart. "The Lunars say that you must be able to defend what is yours, else it is no longer yours. You have powerful champions to guard what is yours, but there are things within your kingdome that is weak."

"Have you come here to taunt me?" the sorcerer demands, after a moment, his eyes still locked on the waves of the lake yonder. His voice has lost some of its civility, though his body remains motionless.

Chi-Yosh turns towards the Lunar, eyes seeking. "In my village, I was trained as a healer. A man who can take life away and give it back. I see a man in pain, one who's heart is sundered. But I fear that the longer that wound is open, the closer it will get to infection. And if it is left alone, denied the medicine it needs... it may take what life is left."

"Would that be so bad?" Prowler asks, softly. "Perhaps that is how things should have transpired. Perhaps they may yet. Valon might still come for me. He is no sorcerer, but he is cunning. I may give offense to the elders. I may be killed in battle." He actually smiles.

Chi-Yosh's breath is slow to take, and long to escape. "You battled Lesell because you had to, to save her from others. To offer mercy that a loving heart could. But would she want what is happening to you now? What mercy is in a lamed man from his grief?" A heartbeat of pause. "You mourn her, yet she is out there, for her soul lives in another, and they have not forgotten you."

"Were I so fickle a man that I could cast off the love and hate of millennia," retorts the sorcerer impatiently. "You claim knowledge of medicine. Yet you speak like a man treating a light cut. If so you have misdiagnosed the wound, surgeon."

Chi-Yosh says, "I am not talking of light things, Weeping Prowler. A brew will not heal. But tell me," He stares back at the man across from him, "Can simply sleeping stop it? Or is it having as little time awake to hurt? It would not be easy, or sudden; a man who has his arm maimed may never fully use it. But he still goes on, still continues, and protects what is his."

"Do not presume to tell me my business," says Prowler. His voice is icy like the winds of the northern mountains, and as he stares over the lake the winds blow more steadily, churning up greater ripples than before.

Chi-Yosh has to take a breath, to calm. He is getting no where. Hand dipping into the tunic, he draws from it the necklace with the hearthstone. "I swore to you that I would protect this, and honor Lesell. But no other manse, or anything else, is under my protection." He lets that set in. "She is my ancestor. And in that, we are related. It is not a matter of telling you your business."

This seems to pacify Weeping Prowler, who again regards you with his feral eyes, breaking off his contemplation of the lake. "You have done me some minor favor," he says at last. "It does not excuse you to speak of my affairs, but I will let that rest. However, you claim the title of kinfolk quickly, for you were ignorant of the truth until very recently. Learn the truth before you presume upon me."

"Then I apologize for my foolishness," Chi-Yosh replies. "I may be speaking in haste, but I am speaking in concern. I do not know the ways of Luna's children, or one as old and powerful as you; to think I do is an insult. But to ignore a great man in pain is, what I feel, foolish."

The Lunar actually smiles at this. "When great men wish to be left alone, they are. And when they do not wish to be ignored, they are not. That is the value of power, is it not? To make the world obey your whims? And as long as my wishes give no insult to my fellows, nor harm my lessers, no one ought to censure me for my choices."

Chi-Yosh feels as though he can say no more, for the Lunar's words have built traps around him, and offered him a safe path. If he treds any further, it is repetitious, and will help none. If he takes the exit, then they both may walk free. He approaches a trap. "Yes. As long as nothing is insulted. I shall leave you alone, Weeping Prowler. May you find what you need, to do what you must do." With that, he turns and walks towards the forest.
