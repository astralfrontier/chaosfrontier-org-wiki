# Gods of Eden 2003-10-21

The _Seagull_ has been following the river which washed over Weeping Prowler's den for some time. The air is chrisp, the day forecast with not many clouds to hide the spreading, vast landscape of lush treetops and the clear water of the river from their high vantage point. "There!" Chi-Yosh calls from the prow, his hair whipping in the breeze, released from the braid to flow in the wind. Sunlight catches the faint green highlights, leaving the otherwise brown a stark contrast.

"Are you sure this is the right... ah! There it is." Ramar grins, sending the craft in the direction Chi-Yosh gives. He's in high-spirits this day, the clear sky and swift breeze seem to bring him no small amount of happiness. "Ha ha! And down we go! Shall we set down in the village or on it's outskirts my friend?" He lets his hair be caught in the wind, after all, dramatic gusts of wind are meant to be capitalized on.

Beyond the river is a village, and the _Seagull_ comes to rest in the quick waters, carried along by the current downstream toward their destination. The first and foremost notable feature of the village is an enormous tree, well over forty yards in height, and spreading out at least ten yards from the colossal trunk to the outermost leaf and twig. Lashed to the limbs of this behemoth of wood are ropes, forming a series of crude nets that permit ascent into the green, leafy depths. Around the base of the tree is clustered a small village, with houses built at the boundary of the tree's branches overhead, and an open communal space set in the center, where the people can gather comfortably even in the rains.

Gallius stands on the deck, lost in thought for a time. Chi-Yosh's voice brings her back to reality. She watches the village draw near and smiles. "A homecoming," she murmurs softly.

Chi-Yosh smiles to his friends, and he is obviously pleased to return. "This is the Su'Katan," He explains and hops over the railing of the ship, landing waist deep in the water. Wading to shore, the warrior waves to the others. "Come! It is almost time for break."

Gallius doesn't waste time, following swiftly and easily. A simple leap, a splash, and the lady makes her way after Chi-Yosh. "I should probably have asked more of the customs of your people before," she says. "Ahh well, I shall do what is proper in Roleyn and hope to be forgiven my foreign ways."

The ship is skillfully brought up to a crude wooden pier, and lashed to shore with the aid of one of the villagers, who runs off to bring word to his elders, one assumes, the moment the vessel is moored.

"Time for break?" Ramar muses over this point curiously as he leaps from the rail of the ship, taking care to moor it himself. Or at least to assist the other villager in doing so. He does so with practiced ease, and then asks Chi-Yosh, "Where shall we head to then?"

Chi-Yosh, being a touch impatient to let the boat dock, lets Gallius follow him to shore. "Up the river half a mile is a waterfall. Not as grand as the one which we had fought Prowler's champion, but the rocks are worn smooth like stepping stones." He collects Ramar from the pier. "I wish you to meet Le-Mian."

Ramar is collected from the pier, although not before he gives another glance about, searching for any more Lunars. He grins, "Well at least if Rabby decides to take the ship again we know where to find it... hopefully..." He turns, and follows Chi-Yosh. "Who is Le-Mian?"

Gallius will keep up with Chi-Yosh. "It's nice to get your feet wet every once in a while. I look forward to meeting your people, Chi-Yosh."

"You will see," He assures Ramar, and leads them around the outskirts of the village, to a point opposite the river. It is a well beaten path, wide and clear of trees. A few dozen yards from the first dwellings is a small stone structure, one well cared for and clean, the ground around it smoothed with preened vines and flowers. The structure itself is like a column, pieced together intricately and packed with mud. Yet there is a hollow point, a place where pretty baubles of shells and glistening, smooth rocks have been hung. "This is Le Mian."

"Le Mian was the guardian of the Founder. He was strong and powerful, and the wisest man when it came to harming those to protect those he cared for. He knew how to kill, but he held a large heart, one that left him watching vigilantly over the sick and the needy, sometimes a day without rest. And he would mend and care for the wounded and sick. But it is said that when the village was first getting built, great beasts came from the woods, and he stayed behind to fight them that the others could flee, and he fell."

Chi-Yosh continues. "The Founder came back, and found Le-Mian, and buried him here. But the guardian did not pass on, he clung to this spot, and he grew strong as our village grew strong. He protects us, from ghosts and sickness brought by misfortune and curse. He also helps those of the dead, who may die outside of the village back, so that their spirit may be one with us once more."

"He must have been an impressive man," says Gallius softly. She looks around curiously, studying this odd place. "So you lived most of your life here, Chi-Yosh?"

Ramar listens intently to his friend's tale. He bows his head reverently then when introduced properly to Le Mian, speaking to the structure. "The Founder then, had great care in mind for the Su'Katan to com. I am honored to meet you Le Mian, and hope to be welcomed to the village you watch over."

Chi-Yosh nods. "Yes. I had not been more then a month's journey from here, until I went to the Maze forest." A sideways glance to Gallius. "You could say that my Exaltation was a rebirth for a more exploring life." He nods to Ramar, and then leads the Solars into the village itself.

Gallius smiles at Chi-Yosh and follows him, waiting to see the villagers and the village proper.

Ramar stands up, and nods to Chi-Yosh. "Indeed. Lead the way my friend, and let's see this village you come from." A smirk spreads on his face, "Perhaps we can hear amusing tales from when you were younger... well amusing for us..."

Davron has been lost in thought till now. The idea of hearing Chi-Yosh's childhood tales does elicit a chuckle from him, though. "Now, Ramar... don't embarrass the man," he comments, grinning.

"This reminds, I should share all my plans with you, when we have time." Gallius smiles, "Perhaps.. no, we shall see. This is not the time to fret about the future."

The Su'Katan waves to a few individuals, men who are perched on a roof to mend a hole, another who is chopping wood, doing very small jobs. He glances over his shoulder at Ramar, and can merely smile innocently. "You can try." Striding towards a small home, he knocks on the wooden frame that holds a curtain shielded door. "Come in," calls a woman's voice. Brushing aside the curtain, he steps inside, and instead of calling in warm greeting, grows silent.

"Chi-Yosh!" Comes the woman's call, and the three can spot an older woman come into view, hugging the man around the waist before pushing him slightly. "You arrive so soon, and who do I hear of your coming first? Not my son running from where he has come, but from men at the dock." "I am sorry, mother," He replies, gesturing towards the doorway. "I have guests, and I wanted them to be seen by Le Mian first." "Oh."

Gallius looks from Chi-Yosh to the woman, a small smile creeping to her lips. She offers a deep bow, "Since our friend is overcome and cannot be bothered to introduce us." Her words are jesting, of course. "I am Galius Leon of Roleyn, it is pleasure to meet you. Chi-Yosh has done great things to aid us, you should be very proud of him."

Chuckling, Ramar regards Chi-Yosh's mother quite warmly, with a rather bright smile worn about his face. He smiles, "Though we are sorry for keeping your son from you for the few moments we did, I would like to greet you. I am Ramar, 'tis a pleasure."

Davron bows in his turn. "Davron of Nane, ma'am. Much obliged." The archer is a man of few words, but he offers the matron a warm smile in lieu of a long speech.

"And it is good to meet you too, Gallius. I am Ama-Mata. Come in, come in." The dwelling's main room - not much bigger then to accomidate one or two small ones blocked off by curtains - is filled with whicker wood, along with other wood. She smiles to Davron, before nodding to Ramar. "I am proud, yes; he is a special man, otherwise he would not have been chosen."

Gallius smiles and nods her agreement. The lady enters the house and looks around, admiring it and studying the way it is made. After a moment she remembers herself, "Ah, my manners are wavering, I fear. Lady Ama-Mata, in Roleyn it is customary to bring gifts to those who would allow us shelter. I fear I have little to offer, but perhaps you will like one thing that I have brought." She reaches into a small pouch at her side and draws out a small piece of wood, cunningly carved like a charging horse. "I hope you can accept this."

"Ahhh, Chosen, yes indeed." Ramar bows his head once more, and regards Chi-Yosh a moment, sending him a questioning look. He then decides to take a survey of the house-hold, catching each detail and smiling, relaxing in this place. "It is a pleasure meeting you lady Ama-Mata. And I am honored to be welcomed into your home. So now that we've dispensed with the pleasantries..."

"Oh, well thank you," Ama Mata replies graciously and collects the horse. She holds it up, half admiring and half appraising, before nodding her head. "I have heard of these. Not very common in the area, too many trees. The wood craft is grand. I will keep it," She announces with a nod. A curious look is given to Ramar. Chi-Yosh interrupts, "And I will be showing them the rest of the village, I was hoping to visit shisha before the break." Ama Mata gives her son a critical eye, before concluding, "Very well. I would like to finish the last of this basket before I too will come out."

Ramar nods, "Perhaps we can wait a moment for you to finish the last of the basket? I'm sure that Chi-Yosh wouldn't mind waiting long enough to have you acoompany him on the tour. Besides, it gives us a chance to exchange tales..." Ramar has a rather mischevious gleam in his eyes. "After all, we've many to tell."

Ama Mata's eyes lid just a little as her brows furrow up. "Ramar is foreign," He explains quickly, and moves beside the Westerner, slapping him on the back. Gallius receives a new glance, before she nods to Chi-Yosh. "I see." The warrior gives a quick tug on the back of Ramar's clothing. "Come along, I would like to speak to my teacher first."

"Oh? Well I suppose we can leave then." Ramar bows, wondering, "And if... well nevermind." He follows after Chi-Yosh's tug, "Alright then. To speak with your teacher? Lead the way my friend."

Chi-Yosh explains to Ramar as they exit the building, "I should have warned you, just a little. The men here are... quiet. We do not run at the mouth. We are not subserviant, but it is considered polite not to... waste words and ears, for the women to speak. Thus the fewer words spoken, the more they mean, the more you listen." He smiles disarmingly to Ramar.

Ramar considers this. "Ah..." and that is perhaps all he says for the time. A smile is on his face, and he gives an apologetic look to Chi-Yosh. "Then I am sorry, I should perhaps have asked. Instead I'll do the best I can to keep my mouth shut. Lead on."

Davron chuckles. "This explains much," he comments to Chi-Yosh, smiling. Fortunate it is, he decides, that a taciturn mood has descended on himself at the moment. Although he does go on: "The Master would fit in well here, then."

Laughing at that, Chi-Yosh pats Ramar on the back. "You are a fish out of water. I am sorry. In your circles, I am the quiet oaf. Ama Mata is... a little more firm in belief then some of the other women, but..." He shrugs. A simple, sage nod to Davron. He then almost pounces on a boy who sprints past. Catching him by the shoulder and ruffling his hair, it inacts various pleas for release intermixed with half-executed kicks to the shins. "Ah ah! I need a task of you." "For what?" Exclaims the boy who evades the warrior's lax grasp. "To see a wonder not of the village." A moment's consideration. "Yes." "Find for me Los-Mian, Talu, and Ke-Ran." With that, the boy is gone. Glancing up at the sky, "We must hurry; I will show you the greatest thing of all."

Ramar smiles, "Ah, well so far I seem to have but the one Circle..." replies Ramar, before falling silent. He nods to Davron, agreeing, and blinks when Chi-Yosh rather nearly pounces. He looks at Chi-Yosh, then upwards, he muses slowly, "What is the greatest thing of all, Chi-Yosh?"

The circle is led to the tree that stands in the middle of the village. "This is the Su'Katan," Chi-Yosh explains with a swell of pride and awe as he gazes up at the great tree. "This was planted when the village was first founded, and instead of growing so slow, it grew one foot for every new home that sprung up, and for every new life that continued here, until the tree said 'No more'. The roots span, and link every home to the great tree, for it is the ebb and flow of the community itself."

He waves a hand to the dwellings that give the tree a wide birth. "The boundry is that no soil may be disturbed past the shadow of the Su'Katan at noon. Here, in the soil are the pyre burned bones of everyone who has lived here. They are buried here, and their soul becomes one with the tree, one with the community." Pointing upwards, "It is said that every leaf that the tree spouts is one who has died, and one who will be born here."

"Wow..." is all that Ramar can say in the presence of this magnificent tree. "I..." Ramar's mouth works to produce words, but fails summarily. He kneels, studying the tree with a reverent sense of awe and wonder clearly visible on his face.

Chi-Yosh can only smile and nod to Ramar. "Yes."

Davron gazes up into the branches in quiet contemplation. He has seen many a wonder of late, but this is the greatest he's seen that is purely natural. Something as merely human as words is tiny by comparison.

The network of ropes that leads up to the branches of the tree begins with fixed and stone-pinioned station points below, in the midst of the village. The party climbs carefully, ascending up nets designed for even a child to pass over easily, yet nevertheless their inexperience with this peculiar form of ascent keeps Davron and Gallius slow and cautious. Ramar's sailing and Chi-Yosh's youth excuse them from such cares, but still they hang back from their comrades. The weather beyond gives way to a gloomy, humid shroud of green as they begin walking single file along a tree-branch as wide as an ox-cart.

Ramar is quite clearly enjoying himself. He's rather used to this sort of movement, and has taken a shine to travelling the Tree Branches while in the forest. A smile remains on his face as he looks around, curiously. Wonder is in his eyes. He follows after his friends, taking his time and enjoying every moment he can of this journey to meet Chi-Yosh's teacher.

Gallius will keep up with the group, lost in thought as she admires the scenery. She normally prefers to have her feet on the ground, but for a good view, she'll put up with it. "Your mother is very polite and kind, Chi-Yosh," she says, trying to at least appear like she's not struggling with the idea of walking up in trees.

Beyond the branches, nearer the heart of the tree, the party comes upon an interesting sight - a wicker cage, as though for a songbird, were that bird twenty feet tall. It is cleverly lashed to several of the branches around it, so as to steady it during high winds, and none can quite see inside. However, it is easy to enter, as one need only ascend the rope ladder hanging from a hole at the bottom. One by one the Solars climb inside, steadying themselves against the hint of rolling. "Welcome, welcome," murmurs Kai-Teyo Leun, who sits cross-legged within, rubbing her hands together.

Chi-Yosh smiles as his head pokes through the hole of Kai-Teyo Leun's home. "Greetings, Sisha Leun." He climbs up the rest of the way, to help Gallius and Davron who might have trouble with the rope ladder. "I have come to ask many questions, of great importance."

Gallius will accept the help, offering a bow but no words, this time. She will just let Chi-Yosh lead in these matters, since her people are more verbose with their greeting ceremonies.

The woman spreads out her hand, making a beckoning gesture and inviting all comers into her strange abode. She offers a toothsome smile. "I will try my best to answer, warrior," she says gravely.

"Greetings to you," replies Ramar, as he ascends the rope. He spends a moment attuning himself to the gentle swaying of the cage in the breeze that floats past. "I am Ramar.." he begins, and then recalls Chi-Yosh's earlier words, ending his statement with, "I am honored to meet you."

Davron may be unfamiliar with the ropes and climb-ways of the Su'Katan village, but his native reflexes still stand him in good stead, and he makes decent time, even if he doesn't quite keep up with his more wood-crafty friends. He accepts Chi-Yosh's hand up into the dwelling, and offers a bow of his own.

Chi-Yosh settles into the cross-legged sit across from Kai-Teyo after his friends have achieved the climb. "I have come to question the teachings that are our history. I have found evidence that... things are not as they seem." Watching the woman carefully, "What do you know of Lesell?"

"That is not a name I know of, although the spirits I commune with give answers only when asked the proper questions," the wise-woman says calmly. "I will ask of it, if you wish, when the time comes."

Chi-Yosh nods his head. "Please. For I was told by a Champion of the Moon who lives in the Maze Forest that Lesell, a Champion of the Sun, had died here. And that the village was founded as her followers, and she is intombed nearby."

"I will learn what I can," says the Shishi, sounding vaguely troubled by this. "Perhaps this is related to the tales of the village, for it is whispered sometimes that the village's founder did not lead its population here, but came here and found many people already. Perhaps these stories are indeed true."

Ramar shifts a bit from foot to foot, almost opening his mouth once or twice during the duration of the speaking. After a moment, he speaks, taking his time and choosing his words carefully. His voice is kept somewhat soft, "Is there anything we can do to help?"

The wise-woman hmms. "When I speak to the spirits... if you are all possessed of gifts as our Chi-Yosh is, and if you have a knowledge of their courts and their ways, I feel I could gain much better answers. But for now, ask what else you wish."

Chi-Yosh nods his head. "I think so, because I discovered this." He reaches into Davron's pack, and extracts a map. Unfurling it, "This is a map of the river systems of the East." Handing it to Kai-Teyo, "Does something ring to you?" Though, he glances over to Ramar with a pleased smile, only to glance back to his Shishi.

The woman reaches for the map and begins to pore over it carefully. "Ahhh!" She smacks the back of her hand against the document, grinning. "We are a small village, and you must have gone to some place in the outside world. This...this is the land we live in, then? Perhaps there is meaning after all..." Her fingernail stabs down, tracing the cities and the three dots. "But.. there are only two shown here.."

Gallius listens intently, but does not speak. She shoots a curious look at Davron. Maybe he has a clue as to what is going on?

"Yes," Chi-Yosh replies. "The third dot is not marked. I think there is something of importance there. Or was there. Or... I do not know."

Ramar considers things a moment. And despite the rather tempting statement of asking what he wishes, Ramar does keep quiet. Or at least he keeps his words to a minimum. "What are the tales told of your village, I wonder?" He then moves to see the map as it is unfurled, looking at the lines drawn against the parchment. He wonders. "Which is the one with only two, and what are they meant to represent?"

"Hmm...hmm...." Kai-Teyo muses over the map, thinking quietly. "Yes, I remember now," she says at last. "It was said that the patron goddess of the village had three homes. One, the Court of Spirits. That would be Great Forks, its reputation as the Abode of Eight Million Gods is known even to us here. One, the City of Ghosts. That must be the Empty City, Denandsor. And one, the City of Dreams..." She breathes out, looking down at the map. "The third dot."

Chi-Yosh glances to Ramar. "The image is the symbol of the Founder. But..." He listens to the Shishi, before down at the map. "The city of Dreams?" This only leads him to Davron.

Gallius raises an eyebrow. City of Dreams? That at least sounds promising. But then again, not all dreams are good.

"It should not be hard to find," suggests the Shishi. "Take a sacred talisman from the tree, and walk to the place where the dot would indicate.. call on the spirits and present the talisman."

"Chi-Yosh, when we have finished with the current business at hand, I would be happy to help you find this... City of Dreams..." states Ramar, using as few words to convey that as possible. At least, as few words as he feels are necessary.

Chi-Yosh nods his head to Ramar's words, but has to consider the Shishi's message. He is being offered a sacred talisman from the Su'Katan itself. "I shall, Shisha Kai-Teyo Leun. Thank you."

Davron scratches his head. "City of Dreams..." he muses. "Now _that_ is a fascinating concept..." he begins, and then frowns. "Dreams... dreams do not follow the normal rules we know. Normally one never finds such things in the waking world, but there is one place in which one can... the Wyld. But even then... some patches of Creation are so strong that even the Wyld cannot conquer them readily, even though it may surround them. Perhaps this City of Dreams is such a place."

Gallius hmms at Davron, "Are you suggesting this City of Dreams might be a patch of the Wyld? If that's true, how could it be a real city?"

Ramar considers, "Perhaps... or it could simply be the name of a place." Ramar shrugs, dismissively almost. "It is a worry for another time, I should imagine."

Davron shakes his head at Gallius. "A story I heard once... of someone who had ventured too deep in a Wyld zone, only to find that in its midst was an island of Creation, still untouched by the prodigies of the Wyld. Of course, the luckless Wyld-wanderer was... not entirely stable when he emerged again. But there may have been a grain of truth to the tale, even so."

Gallius nods to Davron, "There are some places where we simply do not belong." She smiles calmly and looks back to Chi-Yosh and his master.

Chi-Yosh turns to Kai-Teyo. "When will you be questioning the spirits, Shisha?"

"Tonight, as the Sun and Moon pass each other in the heavens, the time of the failing light," she replies softly. Twilight.

Davron shakes his head at Gallius. "There are places where no mortal man may venture, but..." He glances at the wise woman briefly, before going on - it is Chi-Yosh who will decide when his nature, and the nature of his companions may be revealed, and so he is circumspect now, saying only, "but the Exalted may be able to force a road."

"I will be glad to assist in any way I can." Ramar nods, taking a moment to ponder thoughtfully about the passing of the Sun and Moon. Such an auspicious omen. "Indeed... thank you for what you have given us."

---

The lore of the spirits is hoary indeed, and from ancient times. There is a spirit buried deep, a sleeping ghost whose dreams have brought the great tree of the village to life, and now nourish it with the dreams of the departed. A spirit that in life gave judgement and sat in the high place, making just and equitable laws. A spirit that fell in the giving of justice. The great tree of the village is now the merest shadow of something greater, a strange glimpse of something that stood in the Elder Time. This ghost gives no name, for it does not wake, and even the gods of the village dare not disturb it.
