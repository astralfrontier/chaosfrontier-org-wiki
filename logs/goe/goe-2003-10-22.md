The throne room of Roleyn, kingdom of the western Threshold, land of plains and pennants and horsemen. In the throne room of Roleyn's king, a delegation of six men stand in ornate and colorful jade armor, bearing with them spears and other trappings of war, though they are cleanly attired and presentable for the court. "We thank you for receiving our delegation," their leader says, smoothly enough, inclining himself just enough to show respect to one's host.

The King nods gravely. "I have no wish for a Realm garrison in my lands, I have made that plain. Nor do I wish for a demon to trouble my people, and so I am extending you every courtesy while you and your Huntsmen do their duties. I would offer you the aid of my daughter, had she returned from a mission to the south of our lands, but I fear she has been delayed." The Huntsmen glance at each other, then forward again as their leader speaks. "Your hospitality and wisdom are appreciated, your majesty."

One of the court's aides steps forward to the throne, leaning close to the King and whispering a message into his ear. The King nods, whispers a reply, and points the man toward the door, continuing to speak as he steps away. "I have received word of a disruption on our eastern marches, by the Sandy River. I hope this may be of assistance to you." The Huntsmen bow as one, taking their leave of the court, and three other individuals are called in...

Once again the five Solars meet, making council in one room of the crystal mansion in which dwells Weeping Prowler. They discuss matters for three hours, during which time they are served for meals by Rabby, who comes and goes quickly. At length, all is made clear. Chi-Yosh's visit to his village was fruitful, and he bears with him a complicated piece of twisted bark and wood, a mystic talisman of his village's guardian tree. He and Ramar seek to undertake the Lunar trials of initiation. Davron wishes for his part to continue the practice of magic, and will return to Nane to inform the Master of all that has transpired. With him will go Marina, who will then depart for Marita, home of the Confederation of Rivers' council.

Gallius has already spoken to Valon, and now seeks to travel with him to his home, to undertake some great deed which she now explains.

"It seems that the Lunars will not stand by as Greyfalls hangs in the balance," begins Gallius. "I am no longer able to sit idle, either. The Master told me my destiny was to lead men, and so I shall. Valon has offered me a fair test to see if I am fit to lead his people in the battle. I accept this challenge freely, for I trust him and believe that this cause is worthy. However, I also will need help. I wish to send word to my father in Roleyn, so that our forces may combine in the battle." She adds with a smile, "And I need two of my friends to be brought to me, if it is possible. Gari and Malis will be needed in this training." The Lady pauses, collecting her thoughts. "Unless I am mistaken, we must all be there, working together, if we are to make the fall of so many men worth the cost."

Marina turns to Davron. "You know, it strikes me that I have not yet visited Roleyn. Perhaps ..."

Chi-Yosh leans forward. "Marina, before we left, the Master took I and Gallius aside and said that the Hunt was in Roleyn searching for Gallius. If they still linger, or have their eyes on the kingdom, is it wise that you go there just yet?"

"It may be a dangerous place, if that is true," says Gallius. "But my people have no love of the realm and their faith is in their own blood and people rather than the false religions of a distance power. I know my father will aid you, as will his captains and my friends. I know of one who could probably sneak anyone in right under the noses of the hunt. Unless of course they have brought a sorceror."

Looking thoughtful, Marina looks over at Gallius and Valon, then back at Chi Yosh. "Probably not. However, I am in many ways the most expendable in this upcoming battle. And since I would learn more of these people of Roleyn ... I deal in information, Chi-Yosh. I can't gather information without travel."

"Just be wary, Marina. You know how to watch the ripples in people's words. Be cautious." Chi-Yosh sits back. A glance to Gallius, then back to Marina. "Perhaps you arrive quietly, with quiet word to the king, rather then a viewed arrival and presence?"

Marina nods. "Naturally, I will arrive quietly, not in full Solar regalia. And not merely for lack of the regalia ..."

"Either way can be arranged," says Gallius. "I just wish to have Gari and Malis brought here. I know Lady Yuri would find your company welcome, Marina. She rarely gets to speak with those who appreciate the workings of a kingdom." The lady smiles, "I will be very grateful if you can do this favor for me. I hope I can repay it someday."

"Naturally, Gallius. Some day, perhaps, you will. For now, though, I would know of this one who can sneak me in." Marins smiles, intrigued at this chance to expand her web.

"Well, Gari is a good friend of mine, and well.." The Lady mulls over words, then gives up. "He was one of the most skilled horse thieves in the city, until he was caught by one of my friends. He likes to let his tongue wag with young women, and he said too much. He's learned to keep his mouth shut from time to time, now, and he's a loyal friend. He ought to be, since he was supposed to be banished." Somehow the lady laughs over it all, "He's far too amusing to send away, though. Just be wary of him, Marina, and if he compliments your beauty don't let him fetch you a drink."

Marina grins. "Fair enough. Perhaps I should trip him up first?"

"I'd love to see him kept off-balance by a woman. It'd be refreshing." Gallius grins, "I think you can keep him in-line, though. If he does anything stupid, though, Malis will break his arms. I will send a letter with you for full access. I fear our libraries are not great enough to impress you, but you can learn of my people, and our scribes will tell you the tales that are handed down."

Raising an eyebrow. "I can't just bruise his ego, instead of asking her to break his arm?" Marina smiles wryly. "Ah well. I can always go back to practicing on Ramar."

Gallius nods to Marina, "Well, do what you wish to him, but try not to kill him. I will have need of a scout." The lady lets out a sigh, "At least things are now set. The pieces are moving into place, and the game is already beginning. If all my messages come through." For a time her eyes stare off at nothing, and she just offers, "I asked the elders to send word to Ma-Ha-Suchi. I told them to let him know that the bearer of his consort's soul shall await him at Greyfalls."

Marina nods. "And what will he find at Greyfalls?"

Chi-Yosh can't help but smile wryly. The battle of Greyfalls is going to be chaotic and a thing of legends. What the Circle is bringing to the table is impressive enough.

Gallius hmms softly, "That I do not know, Marina. I only can hope we find victory there, and then.. what I wish for most would be peace. But I am not childish enough to think that will be." She smiles sadly, "It will be unpleasant, as all battles. If you have not been in one, I can try to find the words, but nothing can really prepare you. Not even former experience."

Marina nods, smiling wryly. "Betrayal on a whole new stage." She shrugs. "Nonetheless, I'll bring your friends."

Gallius nods to Marina. It seems that now the lady has nothing more to say.

Non Valon and Gallius depart together on the next day, and for almost a week they travel through the dense forests that surround the Maze. Already the heart of the forest has been closed off by the secretive elementals to whom Chi-Yosh pledged security, and slowly but surely they spin their webs of wood outward to the Maze's borders. They arrive in the ape-man's traditional home at last, a network of half-buried stone ruins effectively camouflaged by the woods around them. There they are greeted cordially by Valon's people - servants and slaves, concubines and lieutenants. The ape-man barks out order after order, sending his minions scurrying in every direction.

Valon makes preparations for Gallius' stay in a vast ruined temple near the center of his "city". Food is brought for the weary travelers, and for the first evening, the Lunar explains in detail the disposition of his forces. He commands the loyalty of perhaps two thousand beast-men, Wyld barbarians and other uncivilized beings, although they are at the moment widely spread out. His warriors are equipped with bronze arms and armor, and some lucky few possess steel.

Lady Gallius first spends time learning ranks. Captains are called, men are reviewed. The first thing she introduces is the concept of respect for leaders, so often lacking in this wildness. Men are given free reign to challenge her with a variety of arms. Once she has bested ten men in a row, then several groups of two or three men, there is little doubt left that she is strong enough. But strength is not enough.

Intellect is also required in leadership, and a strong magnetism. The Lady speaks to the captains, forcing an order to exist in the normal chaos of their men. Tactics are not just explained, but demonstrated. More challenges, this time with teams of men led by captains. More proof. Finally the lady reveals herself utterly, calling upon the essence to allow her being to glow with the glory of the Unconquered Sun as she addresses the men she would lead. For an hour she tells them of herself, of the future, and of the battle and glories to come. She talks of life and death in battle, calling upon her own experience. There is battle without quarter, victories that mean sweet life shall continue, and losses and failures that need to be avenged, and then a peace she pledges to bring to them at even the cost of her own life. Somewhere in the midst of her words, the Zenith stops speaking and begins to chant, every phrase bending into a lyrical poem that ends only when her heart has been laid bare to those she asks to die in her service.

Davron returns to the laboratories of his quarters, inspired by the example of Weeping Prowler to make use at last of the gift granted him by the Five Dragons of Syllum. The wisdom they have granted him had threatened to overwhelm his mind at the time, but now that he has had time to comprehend the deluge of information and make it his own, he is now ready to sculpt that basic knowledge into orderly structures. Insights from the Dragons of Air and Water, in particular, are uppermost in his mind as he begins shaping a means to summon ice from pure Essence.

For the first several weeks after his return, though, the inexperienced would-be sorcerer seems stymied. His first few experiments are successful enough - he has soon learned how to conjure a small volume of water, or to draw the heat away from an area. But the attempts to do both at the same time suffer from unforeseen effects, as the Essence-patterns of the two different magical workings interfere with one another in unexpected ways. On one occasion, the chilling process is accidentally reversed, and Davron narrowly escapes being singed by the cloud of steam that erupts over his workbench. Notebook after notebook is filled with lists of failed attempts.

Nevertheless, Davron does not give up so easily - the practice of sorcery is arduous and unforgiving, as his elders have repeatedly warned him, and a mere month without results is nothing compared to the dangers that may befall an experimenting magician. He steps back and re-examines his earlier failures, hoping to see the patterns in them - and as he reviews the notes of the steam-cloud mishap, he recognizes a pattern taught him by the Dragon of Fire. If he can account for that, he realizes, success is not far off.

And indeed the next day's experiment proves to be the crucial breakthrough - everything seems to fall together as Davron chants the new syllables, and in a swirl of cold air his workbench is coated in a thick layer of ice. Now that the basic principle is proven, he works on scaling up the power to create a wider pattern - although after skidding into a wall upon summoning an ice-field beneath his own feet, he realizes the importance of increasing the spell's range.

Finally, after two months of intense study and experimentation, he decides he is ready. With the Master's guidance, he seeks out an abandoned field where he will not readily be observed. He concentrates, his anima flaring about him, shaping into arcane runes of light that hang in the air as he recites the syllables of the spell...

...and with one final gesture, glittering Essence swirls and crystallizes into a broad circular patch of ice, glistening and treacherously slippery, certain to send unwary foes sprawling should it form beneath them. As Davron studies his handiwork, he is pleasantly surprised by the intricate patterns formed by the air bubbles trapped beneath the ice - short swirling arcs that intermesh with one another, forming expanding concentric rings around its center point.

And as he studies the curiously beautiful design, he realizes what it reminds him of - and as if it were whispered to him by the Dragons themselves, he knows the name of the spell: Unfurling of the Rime-Rose's Petals.

Accepting the letter of introduction, Marina makes her way to Roleyn. A side trip, first, escorting Davron back to the Master; there are qyestions she has for the Master in any case. The further she can get without using that letter the happier she'll be. Still ... Eventually she uses the letter, and the name, penetrating into the castle.

Gari and Malis are easy to find, although Gari is indeed a proper charmer, and anything but prim. Still, Marina's eyebrows are as sharp as they've ever been, and combined with a determination to avoid drinking any wine he has poured, all seems to go well enough.

The audience with the king is a little more subdued, the letter delivered to him, along with a precis of what's happening. His debriefing method - while gentler than that of the Master - is certainly just as detailed, delving down far further than Marina had intended to talk. Still, he seeks news of his daughter, and it would seem cruel to deny him.

While the King composes his reply, Marina wanders around the capital under the aegis of Gari and Malis. Quietly, without drawing attention to herself, Marina meets many people - powerful nobles and counsellors, but also servants and stable keepers - as she seeks out people who will trade information or help for favours and coin.

The letter obviously causes the King some grief; it takes him a week, and more, to prepare it to his satisfaction. But, finally, Marina is summoned back to his presence, and tasked with the delivery of his reply. Curtseying, the only request Marina makes is the company of her two charming guides. A request quickly granted, and by morning the trio are enroute to rejoin Valon and Gallius.

The woods, secluded from all life. The Lunars, after their Exaltation, must take the trials. However, the Dawn seeks respect among Lunars. Being considered one of them, taking the same rights of the lunars as they had, it can earn respect and take many shortcuts. The Children of Luna who believe the Solars are ment to be destroyed may be swayed by the lenghts Chi-Yosh has went.

The time in the forests was not spent alone. Ramar, taking the trials himself, became an ally. The Eclipse's expertise at survival became a useful asset, and the two worked together when need be through the Trials. Yet Chi-Yosh was not always within sight of Ramar; a good portion of the time was sought in seclusion, a period of physical, mental and spiritual exercise. Patient Mantis had introduced him to a path, the second step was taken in Nane, but here in the serenity of the forest the Dawn hones himself. The ebb and flow of Essence is the spiderweb which he perches, watching and feeling it tingle and flow. His mimicry of the mantis has taken a solid foothold; the technique is down, allowing for many benefits, but it is the foundation which can spawn many useful moves. But those are for another time.

Once the trials are over, Ramar and Chi-Yosh return to Weeping Prowler's crystalline home from the lands of Sunrise Seer's apprentice, farther East from the Maze forest. The Elementals of the Woodlands allow the Su'Katan and his circlemate through without trouble. It had been pre-arranged that Davron return to Prowler's home after a month, and several days as the Lunar's guest were taken before Davron arrived. The herbs and plants that the Dawn had collected are loaded aboard, and a promise to Rabby is given: in exchange for sending word if the Elementals' home is molested, Rabby may accompany them to Greyfalls, and for an unset lenght of time thereafter.

Upon arrival at Nane, the various plants are handed to Padma for tending and care, as well as observing any uses that Chi-Yosh had not himself decieved. For a short time, the Dawn is locked away, testing the _yurei_ flower, following the ingredients and procedures he had been given by Val. The results, a container of salve, is tested; smeared onto his chest and given time to set in, before a knife is taken. The blade's cut leaves a line on the skin, but it was deflected as surely as if he were wearing armor.

Taking the _yurei_ armor with him, Chi-Yosh sets out with Ramar to observe Greyfalls' area, to take notes and survey for weaknesses. Other plans are put into motion, to gain the resources they require.

---

And so it comes to Ramar, whose time has eben spent in a manner similar to Chi-Yosh's. He became fast friends with the Lightbringer, and the two aided one another when need be. Yet their paths would separate during this time, and Ramar found himself drawn deeper within the forests, eager to see the majesty and the danegrous beauty that lay within. He learned a great deal from his experiences, the Path he'd started when he took the test stretched out before him... and he spent many a day pondering it.

And deep in the woods, something beckoned to Ramar. The tides of Essence seemed more tangible here, and it was as though he could almost perceive it... and he realized then that it was more than his mere skill being tested here. It was he that was to be tested, and thus he faced his test, his thoughts turning from idea to idea as they were revealed within the forests. Chi-Yosh had been helping him, he'd been teaching the Eclipse to keep his body hidden, to keep his footfalls light... and now, when the trials ended, Chi-Yosh and Ramar returned to Weeping Prowler's home, and the two shared their knowledge and enjoyed their brief stay as Weeping Prowler's guests.

Ramar's thoughts turned to Greyfalls. When Davron and Rabby and Chi-Yosh were ready, he piloted the _Seagull_ as swift as the wind to Greyfalls, bringing with him many secrets that had been learned by those on the boat. He spent some time conversing with the Master, sharing the tale of his ordeals with those willing to listen. When he was done, with a sense of calm regarding the upcoming battle... he traveled to Greyfalls. Here it is that their immediate destiny lies... it is here that the separate worlds in creation, the separate nations, the differing peoples will come together. A chaotic gathering of many parts... _It is here, that I am needed. To help bring order and to unify these separate parts... to show them the whole that they could become... to help bring about this destiny..._

When they return, Ramar shares his information with the rest of the Circle, he tells them of what he has learned and how he thinks peace may be best brought about. There is a sadness in his voice and behind his eyes as the days trod slowly, inevitably, towards war. He spends mroe time with the Master, conversing in many languages about many things, and he asks his Solar companions for their views on things to come, and he asks them to share their tales, eager to hear and learn from the experiences of the others, as he is from his own.

"Greyfalls... herein lies the end of a great tale, and the beginning of something greater than has ever existed before."
