# Gods of Eden 2003-10-24

Blindfolded, the two Solars were led aboard a bobbing vessel that rested at harbor near Prowler's mansion. Blindfolded, the two listened to the invocations of the sorcerer, and felt the boat rock beneath their feet. Blindfolded, they felt the wind speeding by them at unguessable velocities, in an unguessable direction. And blindfolded, they were thrown over the side of the vessel and onto stony ground. As each man removed the fabric from his eyes, he could see Prowler and Rabby standing on the deck of the ship as it bobbed in the river next to them, a river that ran through a thickly forested land.

"This trial ends when you find your way back to the mansion," instructs the Lunar sorcerer. "Following that there will be other challenges." And with that, he shouts an invocation, shaping a burst of Essence around him that suffuses itself into the little vessel upon which he stands. It rises into the air, propelled by white wings that burst into existence on either side of it, and the craft disappears off into the distance.

"Then we will see you when we return," calls Ramar, after the retreating vessel. He takes a moment to survey the surroundings, "At least we are near water... however, if we are near here other animals will likely know of it, perhaps even predators. Still..." He gives a nod to Chi-Yosh. "It is a beautiful land we are in..." He looks about, slowly, taking in the surroundings, attempting to get his bearings in this new land, as it were.

Chi-Yosh watches the ripples left in the wake of the magic propelled vessel. No telling how far, or in what direction the two are from the mansion. However, the fact that the mansion is on a river does not escape him. But he would not put it past Weeping Prowler to travel to another river. "It is," Replies the Su'Katan, as his eyes drag up over the landscape, before back to the river. "We should follow the water, but stay in the trees. Unless we deal with a hunting cat, or something with incredible agility or sheer size, we can elude or be warned first."

"And where does this river lead? Should we follow it up or downstream, Chi-Yosh? It is difficult to tell for now. There are many forested lands, and we could be in any direction from the Manse." Ramar muses on this a moment. "Although it may do well to try and determine where we are first." Ramar begins walking along the bank of the river, kneeling down to study it and the creatures swimming within, if any can be seen. "I agree, but again, staying along the river is one way that anyone searching for us, or a quick bite, even hunting cats... will be sure to find us."

Ramar says, "Indeed... we do not even need to follow the river for fear of running out of water..." Ramar spends a few moments studying the land, letting a hand dig about in the ground while he listens to the wind around. "It should rain in the next few days... we'll not run out of water anytime soon."

"Avoiding predators seeking a drink is wise. Several yards from the water at least, for traveling." Sticking his hand in the river, he can feel the way the river runs. Chi-Yosh's first instinct was downstream; this river is small, and small rivers feed bigger ones. Yet they could be close to the Elemental Pole, and there is no telling how the rivers run in conjunction with it. Not to mention his unintimate knowledge of the river Prowler leaves him weak; the waterway could split, at some point. This earns a frown. They truelly are dumped into the middle of no where.

"Well none of these trees seem to overpower the others... perhaps if we were to ascend to their tops, we might get a better idea of the lay of the land," suggests Ramar, as he walks lightly, noting the ground around. "We should be not too far from the Pole, however, to find life so abundant like this..." He looks about for a reasonably tall tree. "And this way we can at least determine where our wanderings may take us, and perhaps see how far on the river flows..."

Ramar drops down from a tree, after surveying the land. He informs Chi-Yosh of the smoke, noting, "It's either a natural fire and will get bigger very soon, or we have company..."

"We are not alone in these woods, my friend," The warrior replies. "They may be travelers, natives, any such thing. And they may be after us." After a moment, "I do not believe asking directions is against the rules, do you?" A grin.

The two warriors creep closer, ever closer, to the area where the smoke plume must have originated from. Taking to the trees at last, they make their final approach over the last quarter-mile. Unfortunately Ramar chooses unwisely, and the branch onto which he leaps snaps between his weight. He falls crashing to the forest floor, sending a dozen birds fleeing from their quiet roosts in the treetop to flutter into the heavens above.

The smoke emanates from a camp-fire, surrounded by stones and burning itself down. There is nobody visible now, although all the signs are there to suggest recent use. Even the smell of well-cooked and herb-seasoned coney still lingers.

"Who...o...ohhha..." cries Ramar as he attempts to catch himself a second too late. He groans softly and rises to his feet. _Whoever's nearby knows we're here... likely as not._ He takes once more to the trees, _And something's not quite right about the fire. Someone's been here very recently..._

Chi-Yosh sucks in his breath as Ramar hits the dirt, and watches the birds fly above them. That no doubt will alert the fire makers of their presence. But there is not much they can do. Upon making it to the campfire, suspicions are further roused. _No woodsman worth his salt would leave the fire going, if he left._

With a voice no louder than a whisper meant for one person and one person alone, Ramar suggests following the Tracks to Chi-Yosh. He will then begin following after them, keeping to the trees as best as he can, and he'll keep himself as alert as he can be, as he's more wary now.

Leaving the dying fire as it is, once they are confident that it will not be a danger to the forest, Chi-Yosh and Ramar set out after the tracks. Their pursuit takes them south, up the smoothly sloped hill. Here, concealed well among the trees, is a watchtower of sorts, carved carefully into the trunk of a living tree, with a short rope-ladder to aid in ascent. Ramar is conscious before-hand of the presence of someone moving about at the top of the primitive look-out post.

Chi-Yosh moves closer to Ramar, and is informed as quite as can be about something in the tree itself. Whatever could be the lone tracks they followed. While the potential this individual may be friendly, the would care for a weapon; his hands are competent, but not fully. Yet, this trip will see to him walking a path to change that. "Care to find out who it is?"

Ramar nods, slowly, his gaze sweeping across the area in search of other signs of movement... or other things that would give away the presence of more than just the one. He motions towards the tower, using only a flick of a finger to indicate it, as Chi-Yosh is the quieter of the two.

Ramar whispers, as softly as he can, "Although since we know where the watcher is... we can be alert for more, and perhaps we can simply bypass them... should they not have our best interests at heart."

"I will see what I can make of him." Chi-Yosh melts into a crouch. Instead of branch-striding, he prowls like a cat across the limbs, moving arm over arm or climbing like a spider around a trunk rather then jump. Without the hearthstone, the leaves may betray him; movements are balanced to not ripple the foilage. Wind may caress the leaves; here he moves. Shadows play; here he lurks, ever closer to the outpost.

The dweller in the watch-tower remains unaware of the warrior creeping close. Finally he rises from where he apparently sat, as Chi-Yosh now observes, and leans over the edge of the tree above to look out across the forests. He is humanoid, with green-tinted skin and deep green hair. He wears primitive skins to cover and warm himself. Three eyes gaze steadily across the woods, studying it intently.

A branch across from the Wyld-twisted barbarian quivers. Sound comes, as the sight from the corner of the eye; too late. The shadows claw at Chi-Yosh as he swings, legs lashing to sieze the forward leaning barbarian's neck. The barbarian is yanked from his perch head first, before the assaliant's body curls. The green humanoid strikes the ground on his back, long enough to know the wind has left him before knuckles to his temple send the world into a black sleep.

Ramar blinks, quite stunned as Chi-Yosh makes his attack against the Barbarian. He isn't quite sure he's seen it, and instead he remains in his post on the tree. He blinks, again, this time his attention shifting to the surrounding terrain, watching for signs of other observers.

Chi-Yosh retrieves the knife from the unconcious tribesman, and inspects the outpost to find nothing of use. He waves to Ramar, gesturing for the man to come before he climbs down, and begins walking into the forest.

Ramar follows after Chi-Yosh, shaking his head a bit. He whispers to his friend, "You know when he wakes up he'll at least be on a higher alert, and he might have had information worth sharing with us... however he might also have been a danger. We should be well on our way and try to be on the alert for mroe Wyld Barbarians... and Wyld areas."

"I do not think he would have spoken our language. Even so, I do not think he would be helpful. By the time he wakes, we shall be long gone. Unless he..." A pause, the Su'Katan glancing aside to Ramar. "Spirits."

"Indeed. We should be wary of them... or do you mean they are here now..." The mention of the word sends Ramar's gaze searching once more, as he walks along, moving with Chi-Yosh to try and get away from the outpost.

"No no, my friend, I have a bond with the Elementals of the Maze Forest. That word may have traveled. Thus, they may be willing to give us directions. It is worth a chance to question the local deities, is it not? Or are you lacking needed materials to call them?" Chi-Yosh inquires.

"I do not have any materials, other than the clothes on my back, my friend," grins Ramar, as he gestures at the expanse of forest ahead of, behind, and all around them. "However, we may find shrines devoted to them... but we feel so isolated... so very far from any sort of inhabitants, I'm not sure there would be such things."

"Well we can at least travel to the West. If we've gone to far, we can at least find some familiar point with which to get our bearings, before getting lost in the trees at the Eastern corner of the world..." suggests Ramar as he begins walking that way, ever alert. He ponders a few of the trees, "And if we need water... then we can set up a few catches over the next few days and clean the water out as well."

---

The Sun is brushing itself against the horizon as Chi-Yosh and Ramar continue to stride through the forests of the East. They have descended two cliff faces so far, following the river and observing the beautiful waterfalls that dot its length.

To deal with neccessity, the two scrounge the brush. Chi-Yosh pointing at which things not to eat, and Ramar knowing how to find things, even the occasional insect, the two have enough food to last for a few days. The river provides what it may.

"Then we shall sleep on our decision for the night," suggests Ramar, before he wanders away from Chi-Yosh. About an hour is spent in silence, observing the world for a while. He attempts to understand which plants are edible and which are not, and is aided by Chi-Yosh's herbal knowledge. _But what's more, if I watch to see how animals react around things that aren't safe to eat, I may learn to see such signs in the future and be wary of unidentified plants in such a manner..._ He harvests a few of the more safe-seeming plants, and having gathered enough to provide sustenance, he does his best to cover his tracks, and to make the gathering seem as though it were one of the local creatures, lest the Barbarian and his comrades try tracking them and find such an obvious sign.

Ramar says, "Or is it several ones all kinda stacked together. We could try to find an edge, and from their get our bearings on just where things are. Then we'd have a landmark. Maze Plateau."

Chi-Yosh has found a tree to sit beneath, and think. He is not faring so well, but this is the first day. The challange is fair, but this possibility was foolishly unexpected. They have been traveling southward, along the river. They are not in the Maze itself; the elementals are present moreso in the Maze. But otherwise, they are at a loss. Silently the man sends a prayer to the Maiden of Journeys.

The night passes uneventfully. Ramar, shakes his head, the Solar lost in thought for a while. A stumped look has come across his face as he settles back into the lush, verdant grasses beneath the towering-sort of-trees. His fingers run slowly through fallen needles and the grass, and he idly stares at a blooming flower by the roots of one of the trees. _Er... hang on a moment..._ Something begins to dawn upon the Eclipse, _If things are this ful, this lush out here, we had to have been moved to the East... no wonder I keep comparing the plantlife around here to that around Weeping Prowler's Mansion..._ With little more than a rustling of the grass beneath him, Ramar slides up from his resting place, and confirms his observation. With haste, he goes to find Chi-Yosh, eager to share his discovery with his friend.

Chi-Yosh finds his mind clear. He is trying to think of something he has yet to think, but is coming up blank. Rolling over the facts of their position, their trip. A leaf falls onto his forehead. Looking around, then back at the leaf, _Things are so beautiful here. Even moreso then the Lunar's own home. The East Pole breathes more life into..._ The leaves. The plants. He leaps to his feet, and moves into the forest to find his circlemate.

The two Solars hurry through the twilight, spotting eachother at once. "We are East!" In unison they share the thought. "West!" A moment of clarity, a partial celebration, before all calms, and grins are worn by the pair.

And with the mutual enlightenment that the Solars have shard, the two friends set out to the West. Their spirits quite lifted over the next few days as they spend time checking, ensuring their directions as they travel through lush, verdant woodlands. Several times they will stop, to make sure they have enough water to drink, and when the rains begin to fall, Ramar takes some time to find some plants and make shallow basins to catch water with, ensuring their continued survival.

"Well my friend," remarks Ramar to Chi-Yosh with a grin, "I think we've come a long way... but I suspect that this is merely the beginning of our journey. We're somewhere to the Northeast of the Maze forest... yes... but how far?" Ramar can't hide the joy on his face, now showing signs of being well-traveled. That is to say he's quite filthy. And unshaven, and unkempt. "We'll go this way... I can only imagine what it must have been like here though, spending your days surrounded by trees taller than yourself... and where life is in bloom even to the untrained eye..."

"It is the life I knew. I am glad to be back to it." The two once more scrounge for food along their travel further southward. They have yet to hit the Maze forest, but the knowledge that their path is correct is with them. Ninety more miles falls beneath their belt, and on the sixth night of their trail, the two find a deep pool. Chi-Yosh first inspects the water for depth and danger with a stout, long stick. Then he climbs a tree before leaping into it with an enormous splash.

The water looks quite inviting. And after a moment or two himself of ensuring it's safety and watching the things swimming about within, Ramar slips into the pool, though not quite as noisily as his companion. He ducks his head beneath the water and swims with practiced ease, almost as though he'd spent much of his earlier years doing just that...

"In some ways," continues Ramar, poking his head up above the water, "This life isn't terribly different from what I knew..."

Chi-Yosh enjoys the water. There is no way to fully rid hair, body and clothes of filth, but the water helps. Breath slowing, he sinks beneath the surface, feeling the movements of Ramar. Peaceful, soothing. A nice break. Pushing back to the surface, a cant of his head towards Ramar's comment. "This is much like the desert you knew?"

Ramar kicks his legs, letting his back arch as he brings his feet up to breach the surface on the water. He's floating on his back. "A little... yes, but that was not what I was referring to..." Ramar takes several slow breaths, relaxing now that they have found a place in which to do so. "Originally, I hailed from the West, you know. Life there is similar to that I saw in your village. People live their lives and depend on the land to survive... except there the land is water... and often times people would wander. Some were named explorers, charting places, others... well we called them pirates. Still, it applies to the Desert, and indeed to people everywhere..."

"No matter the substance man lives upon, or the changes in how he says hello and what he wears, it is all the same, while all the while different." Watching the Eclipse, Chi-Yosh immitates. He had swam in Prowler's lake, but the waters in this pool are more appreciated, more welcomed and grand this moment then any other. "A friend I know in Nane is similar. He is from the West. Men rule the family there, do they not?" A mirror are East and West, where right is left and left is right.

"In some places, they do. It does tend more towards that... however there are islands, nations unto themselves where this is different. Much as there are exceptions to every rule," explains Ramar, and he grins, noting the similarities, and the stark contrasts. A mirror indeed. "And there, instead of scaling the branches of the trees, we scale the masts of ships and the riggings."

Chi-Yosh lets the stillness of the water fill him, as the crickets sing. "Is there beauty to be found there, Ramar? I have seen sights, but only here. I know your feet are made to walk, but I would not mind seeing Creation as it has been carved, in all angles."

"Such is my goal, Chi-Yosh, to see the world and all it has to offer." Ramar floats, his arms paddling slightly to help keep him afloat. A slow smile creeps at his face and an odd tone tinges his voice, "And then I mean to show the world what it can be, and the greatness it hides within itself, to show Creation that it is so much more than most regard it to be..."

Chi-Yosh sits up just a bit, water swalling his stomach and chest. "I see the use in that." A sigh escapes, eyes drifting into the treetops. "Look around you. Harmony. People can leave in peace, yet there will always be one who will try to break the surface of that tranquil pond. I wish to bring the waters stillness, and keep those from tipping the scales between happiness and suffering to pain and terror. Greyfalls I find important, for this reason. It is a step. If we can do it there, we can do it many places, and offer our protection."

"If our protection is fit to be offered. There are dangers in the world Chi-Yosh, and in that way, there are dangers within ourselves." Ramar explains, "Good and evil, if such things exist, are in both of us, for there cannot be one without the other... more, they are two sides of the same whole. Parts of a puzzle, you might say..." He continues, "I'm not sure we can stand up to every danger in the world... yet. I wonder if we can stand up to ourselves?"

"I am Dawn." This offered as though it were explination enough. "I am a man, who is not perfect. But my hands are apt at what they do: to help others. To serve man, as the Sun dictates. It's what we're ment to do. Just in different ways." Chi-Yosh shifts in the water, upright. "And I think we should slow in our travels. Prowler said more challanges await our arrival. I would like to be prepared for these, and the trials ahead, in Greyfalls. For every day we travel, the next we stay put and travel inwards."

Ramar smiles, "Indeed. A journey inwards often yields more questions than it does answers though... I warn you." He shifts a bit, disappearing beneath the waves, only to come up behind Chi-Yosh. He attempts to push the fellow beneath the waters, and then makes a hastily swimming retreat.

Chi-Yosh doesn't resist, disappearing beneath the water. Body crouches, feed kick off the muddy pond's floor, sending him into Ramar's stomach. And so the two wrestle in the water for some time. Dragging themselves from the water, food - a delicious rabbit - is snatched by a snare Ramar weaves. And the next day, the two work not on foot, but on development. And the next day, they set forth to continue the pattern.
