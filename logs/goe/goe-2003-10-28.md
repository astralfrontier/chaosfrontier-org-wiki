# Gods of Eden 2003-10-28

Leaving the thicket where She of the Veils was met, Ramar and Chi-Yosh continue on their trek. The thought of fish has planted a seed in both minds, and sooner then later the two find themselves walking south and west, towards the Lirak river without knowing. When this revelation his discovered, they move in a more obvious path towards the fish-laiden waters. Night and day come twice before the pair come across the waters' edge.

The days are spent in slow, meandering travel, done during the sunset hours when it is cool and while they still have light to guide them. In the meantime, the two Solars journey inwards, their minds focusing as they practice, as they train and spend the morning and evening hours honing their abilities, seeking answers to unanswered questions, and learning things they hadn't before.

As time passes, the two Solars find the answers they seek, and though they are left with more questions... the need to travel and the thoughts of completing their trial drive them forwards. That night finds them camping near the river's bank, and when the dawn rises the next morning, Ramar exclaims, "We shall have fish for breakfast! Fish!"

And fish they do. Catching them with hands isn't as easy as She of the Veils suggested. Nor is fashioning a fishing line with weeds, a stick and a cricket. But, using Chi-Yosh's shirt as an impromptu net does seem to do the job. The cook fire is made several hundred paces away from the river, and the two dine like kings.

A prayer is offered to She of the Veils. "We thank you lady for the gift of your knowledge and for the water. We hope to find you again should you wish us to, and to learn from you once more." Ramar feasts a while, and spends some time simply relaxing, enjoying this meal. _After all, I do not know when I shall again have the time to enjoy a simple meal._ Ramar stands up, "We should be on, Chi-Yosh. The question remaining now is do we float down the river? It might do well to do so, as I can steer us clear of danger and we may expedite ourselves by several miles..."

"If nothing sees us as an easy meal or convenient prey," Replies Chi-Yosh as he stands up. Eyes combing the area for stout wood - dead trees and limbs, anything which might offer suitable materials. While doing so, he sends up a prayer himself to She of the Veils. "Let us pass down the winding water trails without spilled blood, Wood-Tender, let our passage be swift and safe."

Finding the proper equipment to build a raft isn't a difficult task. It's actually fitting it together into something water-worthy that's the Challenge. The wood grows quite strong though, even as they draw further from the pole, it's as though the forest is more alive, almost awake. Several shadows of clouds pass overhead on their way to bring rains to the trees, and as the two Solars work, a few of the more curious birds stop in to watch. When at last they are finished, Ramar looks about, and retrieves an older looking branch. He raps it soundly aside the makeshift raft, "I christen you... the Lirak Traveller. Hop aboard then."

And the Sun rises in the sky as the two set off down the river. A stick, the longest that can be found, Ramar takes hold of to help dislodge things, and then the two begin their trip. As the Sun takes it's noon position, it finds the two Solars gliding easily over a spectacular sight. Light glitters as it reflects off the river, accenting the white frothy foam welling up as it gains speed and rushes past rocks. And when it calms down, the fish, dozens of them, can be seen just below the water's surface, their scales catching the refracted light. Three fish leap out of the water, bringing a startled laugh from Ramar, "Ha! See that! There's something I've not seen in ages!" They pass slowly down river, and Ramar talks of sailing and his days in the West. He stops to marvel at the long drooping, almost weepy trees found at the edge of the River's bank, their roots pulled in by the current so that their branches slip in to cool themselves. Once or twice Ranar will fall silent and gesture towards some of t

Once or twice Ranar will fall silent and gesture towards some of the more interesting creatures who have stopped to drink at the river's edge, and he notes what their presence near here must mean.

Chi-Yosh relaxes on the makeshift platform. It is good that they are relaxing for the time being; ten days on their feet has left soles tough and in need of the time soaking in the river. With legs dangling off, it offers some meager manner of steering; pushing off of rocks to get in the right direction, paddling just a bit. Of course the wariness of something biting a leg off is there, but with waters so clear as the sun peers through them to the muddy depths, it would be seen coming. While the Dawn may be one of constant movement, action and doing, he is also one of tranquil sitting and relaxing, taking the time to enjoy the sights. "The world needs to experience this more," He asides to Ramar.

Morning has not yet come. The Sun has yet to bless the world with his radiance. Both men are awake, roused early by the relentless rocking of their improvised craft. Both men stir, moving on the raft by instinct, as a hollow 'phoot' sound emanates from bush after bush along the riverbank. Chi-Yosh is agile and deft, his forest-honed senses dodging the burst of needles launched from unseen attackers. Ramar is not so lucky, and he falls to the makeshift raft, twitching, as two needles protrude from his throat.

Chi-Yosh moves like the leaves in the wind as the spines fly by, but as the raft bobs heavily, a glance aside spots Ramar momentarily sprawled. He can only assume the worst, and drops to his side, throwing an arm over Ramar, holding him tight, and rolling off the raft. The river is cold and uninviting. He siezes the raft with one hand, and digs feet into the mud of the river, while dragging the raft forwards. His face plants against the underside, using it more as a shield then any more volleys of needles. One hand keeping it from drifting, while the other steadies Ramar's head above water, beneath the impromptu shield.

Ramar offers little more than a groan as the needles slam into him. His neck twisted almost into the path of the burst of needles even as his reflexes attempt to drag him out of the way. _Why.... didn't I see it coming..._ is one of the few thoughts on Ramar's mind as Chi-Yosh rolls off the raft, dragging him into the water.

Ramar's body screams out as his every nerve begins feeding him conflicting reports as to what sensation is flowing through them. Most of them seem to be some sort of pain. Ramar's mind is sent reeling even as he makes a strangled attempt to cry out. _Is this my end? Is this where I am to die? No. It can't be. It won't be._ Six Falcons leave the forest canopy that morning, borne on wings that carry them as swift as quicksilver, even as the Sunlight begins to shine through, warming and lightening the horizon. Ramar aids Chi-Yosh in the struggle, even if he is unable to do much more than that.

Chi-Yosh feels the man's feeble movements beside him, and he knows what is the matter, instantly. If his wind pipe had been punctured, there would be more struggling and fighting, likely more horrid sounds. First, the needles must be removed; no small feet with arms full. Doing the only thing he can, Chi-Yosh bites the raft. Holding a platform being pulled by a river with only your jaw is no small feat, doing so while juggling relatively dead weight, while delicately trying to remove needles from a vital area is a challange. With touch all that he can go on, the warrior is as slow and careful as he can. The spikes are removed. Pushing fingers between three sticks, holding Ramar close and above water to breathe, the Dawn has to walk careful down the river, keeping raft steady above their heads to ward off another attack.

The attempt is going well, for four paces. Then the warrior's feet slide, dip into a deep pocket in the river, and his grip on the raft is lost. He comes up, and can nearly see down the barrel of the blowgun. A backwards jerk, ducking his head down in a sweep, then kicking sideways off the riverbed. Even splashing the water before him, hoping it might deflect. Then it occurs to him: the raft. Squeezing Ramar's chest hard, then letting go, the body naturally gasps for air. Then one hand slaps over the Westerner's mouth, squeezing his nose shut, as a dive into the river is taken. Leaping off a huge rock beneath the water, Chi-Yosh kicks like he has never kicked before. The sweep of the river is a blessing he will thank She of the Veils later. What seems like a painful eternity ends when he surfaces briefly, sucking in air. Turning back towards the riverbank to watch for another attack, ready to dive his head beneath, he continues to kick in a swim.

Ramar is dragged underneath with Chi-Yosh. His feet kick feebly as he works to aid his companion in his movement. He is still conscious, and capable of taking in a deep breath, though it causes pain to shoot like ice and fire through his veins. When he is brought back up for air, he gasps for a deep breath, moving with Chi-Yosh as he continues down the river.

Chi-Yosh tilts his head, dimly aware of Ramar's conciousness. Good, at least he can breathe for himself. "One more time," He suggests, and with a deep breath, dives beneath the water. The two continue down the river like so, and after thirty minutes of repetative diving and swimming backwards, watching the riverbanks, they hit a buildup of silt in the middle of the river. The raft has been caught on it haphazardly, and here Chi-Yosh drags Ramar up to, checking the wounds.

Herbal poison. It is not unfamiliar to the medic; he was taught many potent things by the Shishi. It can be stopped. Yet, should he leave Ramar on the silt bar, to fall prey to their attackers? While they may beat the bush around the river to see if the two had ran, looking downriver would be simpler. _She of the Veils, let my friend be overlooked. Let your the dirt your river draws hide him, the lush lands around your waters distract his attackers._ Moving the raft, Chi-Yosh lays it across the Eclipse's body and tucks limbs beneath.

Within the recesses of Ramar's mind, his consciousness now battered and threatened by the toxins coursing through his vital systems, he is barely aware of the goings on of the waking world. He can feel himself slipping further and further within, sleep beckoning to him. _No, I must fight it._ The world swims over head, the sky seeming as fluid as the water. Trees that before had seemed weepy now seem to tilt and threaten to crash in the water, and the fish floating beneath are scattering in a veritable sea of multicolored lights and colors, each motion flashing before Ramar as he's covered by the raft. He makes some vague sound of being aware, of being awake, as he desperately clings to the last bit of consciousness he has left. _I must stay awake, even though the pain threatens to overwhelm me, I must endure._

Chi-Yosh waits in a tree. What he needs is a mushroom growing at the base of his hiding place. Yet the boar snorting around the base, unaware of his presence is a deterrent. No time to kill it, risk injury while Ramar needs aid. Instead, he moves cautious and careful through the branches to claim an old bird's nest, hurled out into the brush. The boar trots to investigate. Mushrooms harvested, the Dawn is away.

Bleeding from several tiny punctures, wishing the blessed _yurei_ war paint was with him, Chi-Yosh pushes through the thornbush. A blossom that grows on the inside is collected, but not until he has wounds to show for it. The final ingredient is a root, one that is stubborn enough that the plant - a stout bush - must be pulled out of the ground to get. Several moments of fighting before it cracks under the pressure, and he digs the severed roots from the earth.

Returning to the silt bar, Chi-Yosh removes his shirt. The root and blossom are smashed together with a rock until there is enough paste to work with. The shirt's contents are scooped out and mashed together to stir them better, before the Dawn kneels above Ramar. Smearing the mixture across each puncture, Chi-Yosh wishes he had a knife to administer them straight to the bloodstream. But the mushrooms are less complicated to apply; they are force fed to Ramar..

Blurred forms, shadows and light sifting through the cracks in the raft. Light plays around his eyes, and hey dilate in response. _It is daylight. Will I see the sun rise once more? I must. I know I must. How then? Fight it. That's how. There is strength within you, believe it or not, use it._ He cries out as the mixture is smeared across the puncture, though the cry is muffled as he works to chew upon the mushrooms, swallowing them in hopes that they will save him.

Chi-Yosh kneels over Ramar, wincing as he screams. Though, something else finds his ears; the sound of movement up ahead. Replacing the raft over the Eclipse, he swims ashore. Climbing into the drabbing limbs of a crying tree rooted on the edge of the river to wait. Clinging to the very base of each branch, the rest too flexible to offer support, essence weaves through him. Even here, perched so awkwardly, joints ease and strenghten in the readied, calm way of the Mantis.

Wyld Barbarians. Three, moving through the brush with enough skill to show they know something about hunting. That something is not enough to conceal their movements. The Su'Katan waits, looking over them. While all are green skinned and have the rough shape of a man, there the similarities end. One is square and short, weaving back and forth with steps, blowgun held like a flute to fire when ready, but in no concern. The second is nearly skeletal, arms too long for narrow shoulders. The third is holding its' hunting weapon clutched in a single hand, one which grows from the chest. They are drawing closer, unaware of his presence. That is all that matters.

Chi-Yosh waits until they are nearly underneath him. Their tongue gestures towards the silt isle, and as Thin moves near the water's edge, the tree gives a faint rustle. Down pounces the bronze tiger, feet curled up to his chest until they lash outwards, Short's head a convenient springboard. Body twisting, the elbow lashes to the chest-armed barbarian's face, while rolling over his shoulder for cover.

Short collapses under the kick, yet grabs Chi-Yosh's foot, sending the elbow's strike wide. Landing on one foot, both hands launch forward to catch Chest-arm by the shoulders, shaking him as the Dawn's forehead meets his face. The barbarian is pushed away while the Dawn tilts on his heel, bringing leg up close, to snap upwards under Thin's pointed chin. A hop backwards brings up the defensive stance.

Chest-arm's nose crunches, the blowgun dropped to instead craddle the blossom of pain and blood. Thin's head snaps back as he crumples. Turning back to the concious pair, Chi-Yosh grabs the blowguns, spreading his arms wide. He appears larger, eyes staring past the two with firey intensity, yet watery cold. The weapons are slammed together, shattered wood spreading in a wide arc as the warrior's foot stomps. Sound is a booming thing, his roar and stomp stirring birds from their perches as the sundered tools are hurled back to Short and Chest-arm. The two collectively run into the woods in opposite directions, squealing in their native tongue. The warrior claims any darts on Thin, as well as his blowgun, before returning to Ramar.

As the hunters creep about, the sound of their footsteps, echoing as though they were rocks falling in a canyon, are carried to Ramar's semiconscious form. _Beings are moving about... I can hear them... and I can hear Chi-Yosh fighting them off... I hope he wins._ And with the thoughts of the waking world slipping through his head, Ramar journeys further and further inwards. _I can feel my thoughts beckoning to me. I must find the answers ere I die._ Ramar's eyes flutter closed briefly, and in that moment he sees the shining, pure light filtering in past his vision.

The wandering Solar is now adrift amid an inky black sea, stars wheeling by above and below, each plane of existence reflected before him in a multitude of tiny twinkles. He slowly becomes aware of the ground beneath him, cool and hard, almost as though it were stone. Ramar stands, casting his bleary gaze about. _Here I lie within my mind._ In the distance, one of the Stars grows brighter and brighter, until it shines with the light of the Sun, Unconquered in it's radiance. Ramar strides towards it, almost absorbed by it. As he stands closer, the stars begin to swirl and run beneath his feet, they blend together to form a great milky river, washing through all of creation. He kneels down to drink from this river of starlight, and as he does, it begins to acquire a soft golden glow, picking up the radiance from Ramar's body. The liquid is clear and cool, refreshing him as he begins to wander down the path of Sun and Starlight laid out before him.

_My mind is reeling, like this river, it flows, changed, forced to change and forced into contemplation or it's own destruction. What then must I learn,_ calls the Solar, his voice wavering across his thoughts and drifting through the hazy realm of his mind. As he strides down the corridors of his thoughts, a tall mountain shapes into this new reality, and he is drawn towards it. Trees line his subconscious, growing and spreading before him as he walks. _You know what you must learn, Lightgiver. And you know what must be done._

The river winds it's way through trees growing from a starry void, and Ramar walks, his feet carrying him as though he were lighter than air, journeying towards the mountain at the center. The cold hard feel of rocks greets his fingers as he touches the massive formation. Slowly, with every muscle in his body screaming out as though he were truly awake, the Solar begins to climb. Many times during this ascent, he is asked to stop, his body crying out in agony, yet his mind is resilient, and the climb continues. He falters, almost slipping from the rocks, and then a pure white light begins to emanate from the edges of his vision. _My own divinity calls to me, I shall shape it. I shall forge my own path through this world._ Ramar's fingers grasp with renewed strength as he pushes away from the mountain. He does not fall, but instead begins a slow, steady ascension. His feet come to rest at last atop a tree growing in the center of the very mountain he stands upon, while above him the Sun and the Moo

He does not fall, but instead begins a slow, steady ascension. His feet come to rest at last atop a tree growing in the center of the very mountain he stands upon, while above him the Sun and the Moon drift together, letting the light of all of the Heavens shine down upon him.

A hand is felt on Ramar's forehead. "No fever," Murmurs a voice familiar. Ramar awakes in a cave. Little more then an alcove, it offers enough shelter to hide them from open view. Chi-Yosh is sitting beside him, watching vigilant. The Su'Katan is nervous. Ramar cannot die. He can, but Chi-Yosh wills it not to happen. He is a solar, a circlemate, a friend.

"It is an interesting thing," groans Ramar, as he struggles to sit up, "Being confronted with one's own mortality, perhaps moreso for having been Exalted."

A smile as bright as dawn finds Chi-Yosh. He helps Ramar sit up a little more. "We confront it every day, my friend. It just happened to walk up and shake your hand today."

"Perhaps. Or perhaps I simply admitted it more than we usually do, friend Chi-Yosh." Ramar leans back against the cool stone wall. "Yet there is something to be learned from each experience, and I thank our assailants for giving me this one."

"And I thank you for saving my life, my friend," continues Ramar, as he slumps against the stone. "I hope it is the last time anyone's life needs saving, though it may not always be so."

Chi-Yosh nods his head. "Yes. You learned not to be poisoned again?" He is more mirthful given the Eclipse's recovery. "It was not too much trouble." This offered with more rueful a visage. He hands what food he has salvaged to the other man. "Eat. You are weak."

"More than that. I found a place within myself free from turmoil. Free from questions, free from answers, free from pain and free from death," explains Ramar, gesturing limply. "I have stood atop my highest place, and saw the world beneath me." babbles the Solar, as he turns to take what food he can. "And now there are more questions to be answered. As is the way of things. But what is this I'm eating? It smells."

Ramar says, "It smells... delicious."

Chi-Yosh chuckles, and leans forward to pat Ramar on the shoulder. "Good. You have taken another step to that path which you must walk. I am glad you have found something in this, now the next task is to not forget it, and remember it always." Leaning back, "It is... probably better I didn't say."

"I have not taken any steps, Chi-Yosh. I have added them. My path is that of my own making. Where it leads, and where it ends, those matter little now... I have... I have cho..sen." Ramar nods off a bit, and blinks awake. "But what... what is it that you would not rather say?"

Chi-Yosh chuckles. "Sometimes, you just shouldn't ask questions. Now eat."
