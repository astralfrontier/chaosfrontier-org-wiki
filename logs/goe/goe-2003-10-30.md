# Gods of Eden 2003-10-30

A messenger from Valon comes to meet with the Solars as they prepare for departure, and Gallius receives the news: Valon is ready to announce his plans, and needs her to work with him on strategy. She walks with the messenger back toward the ape-man encampment, while her friends depart with well-wishes.

Gallius lets out a soft sigh, steeling herself for preparations. Battle is never easy, and planning is nearly as stressful as the assault itself. She brings Jin-nu with her, as the apemen have had some time to get used to her. And Gallius wouldn't mind a very different view of the battle.

Valon is seated in a small gulch, crouched on some rocks with the greatest of his warriors. Before him on the ground, cleared out of the dirt and sand of the gulch, is a crude diagram of the city of Greyfalls and its environs. He rises to his feet on the rock, waving casually as Gallius approaches. "So nice of you to join us," he remarks with a sly grin.

Gallius snorts softly, "I'm glad you at last decided to pay some attention to the battle, Valon, I had begun to think you did all this just to have a general you could flirt with." Jin-nu snorts a soft laugh and nods to Valon.

"I've learned of the Confederation strategy - never you mind how," he adds with a wink. "They intend to blow out part of the river, to deprive Greyfalls of its water advantage. The Realm will learn of this soon enough, and they will be forced to take the field to prevent it." He leans over the rock, drawing a line in the sand with one agile toe. "They have two harbors above. One outside the walls, for cargos. One inside, for their armored steam-ships, which will form their supply line, undoubtedly, when they sally forth. They have an unwalled harbor at the bottom too, but that doesn't mean a thing."

Gallius nods slowly. "So the city is the heart, the army is a hand.. and we need but slice the artery and the hand shall die," says Gallius simply. "Who mans those ships?" she asks. The lady crosses her arms, humor seemingly vanishing as business is discussed.

"Normally such vessels escort the Realm's craft through nearby waters, at least to Mist Isle to the south, where the Rock joins with the Yanaze," Valon explains. "And to the north up the Rock, where the river grows thin and barbarian attacks upon shipping become likelier. They are generally manned by Greyfalls' own sailors."

Gallius nods slowly, "Does the enemy have the slightest clue that we are knocking on their door at this time? If not, we have advantages. If so, they still cannot possibly hope to defend both sides of the river and block against the confederation forces." She continues, moving closer and drawing lines with her naginata, "Likely the attackers will split forces here, sending enough men to the castle to force the defenders to man the walls while the bulk of their forces move north to carry out their plan. It would seem that from here to here they are most likely to face harrying forces and ambush." She marks each place carefully, then turns to the river, "It's an interesting plan they have. It may save many lives."

"To be honest, I do not know what the Confederation army will do, as their commanders are from Lookshy and my ah, sources cannot penetrate their security." Valon chuckles softly. "If only they would consent to send me regular reports, eh?" He curls up in a Lotus position on the rock. "If Greyfalls stays behind, they lose the Rock River itself. Their harbors are destroyed, and they lose their only renewable supply of water. It's certain that they depend in large part on the presence of the river, but it's not certain how much. Thus, they must take the field. And this is where we come in. We'll flank their supply line and destroy it."

"That can be done with a small force of able men," says Gallius. "I think I know just who to call upon for aid in this matter." She laughs softly, "Provided they are willing. Either way, this seems wise. If we can capture or destroy these ships, we will at worst deny the army supplies, and at best have a lot of extra food for ourselves. Do you believe they will send food this way, or all the needs of war?" She turns to one of the warriors, "You mentioned shooting a fly off my finger at fifty paces.. if we can fire over the river I think things will go poorly for them. And it will be worse if we steal their ships and pour out of them into the battle." Gallius looks to Valon, "After we destroy this supply line what would you ask of us?"

"After that, it depends," says Valon, calmly and soberly. "I believe these vessels will bring primarily materiel. They are not setting out for a long campaign, only a quick strike to drive the Confederation's army back. Their primary goal will be to destroy Marita's ability to damage the Rock River, which means they'll strike hard and fast against whatever engineering capability the Confederation brought with them. That means firedust, gunpowder, warstriders, and engineers."

"Those things are rather vulnerable, as well," says Gallius softly. "Without much care the attack will fail swiftly, leaving us to break out spears on the walls of the fortress." She sighs softly, considering the layout carefully. "We cannot be everywhere. When I meet with the forces of Roleyn I may be able to learn more about the attack, but what I shall learn is uncertain." The lady considers her next question carefully, "Valon, what do you wish to gain from this, besides the destruction of the Realm in this area? I cannot know what strategies to use if I do not know your final aims."

"My final aim is simple," the Lunar chuckles. "Control of the city of Greyfalls, intact, if possible. Once I am through with it, I intend to leave it to those native peoples who have lived there. They may then do as they wish. They may join the Confederation of Rivers, or live independently."

Gallius nods to Valon, "Good. It makes the battle simultaneously more difficult and potentially easier. The equation need not ignore those people. They will likely send out the most expendable against the river assault. That would mean many Greyfalls citizens will be there. If this is presented correctly, their will to fight may be weak." The lady is lost in thought for a moment, and Jin-nu murmurs, "Now you need but know the goals of the confederates."

"Indeed," remarks the Lunar calmly. "Capture the supply-line or destroy it, I leave the choice to you. Once the success or failure of the Confederation strategy has been seen, we may plan more accurately, I think. If it succeeds, the forces of the River Province will likely lay siege to Greyfalls quickly. They have the Hundred Kingdoms behind them, many of which are loyal to the Confederation. On the other hand, they cannot lay siege too long. The Realm must have heard something of these plans, and some of their forces may be sent up the Yanaze, either to attack under-manned kingdoms, or to support Greyfalls - I am far more inclined to believe the former."

Gallius smiles, "I suppose this means we finally get to roll some dragon-blood heads." Her eyes flash with excitement, "This is indeed a good test for us. We will deal with these ships as they come, and then Greyfalls will be dealt with." She looks to the warriors, "What do you feel we need for this attack? I think rafts can be made easily enough, and that may be all we need, but if Roleyn is with us, we will have heavy weapons to sink and disable these ships."

One of the beast-warriors chuckles softly, and all of them look to Valon. "Oh, that's easy enough," he says lightly. "We'll wait for them under the water. In seven days, I go to Heaven, to do honors to a spirit I know of, and request its favors. If it assents, its children may bless a small party of warriors with water-breathing. The lead boat in a supply train is the important one. It's where the sharpest eyes will be. After those eyes are blinded, rafts and heavy weapons are the order of the day."

Gallius smiles and laughs softly, "Wonderful. I may have helpers that shall be of great aid in this. It shall be as you ask, Valon." She lets out a sigh and looks towards Greyfalls, "They are ready, of course, but I do not think they are ready for everything. There are so many forces converging on this place now. If we do not consume ourselves we should be victorious."

Valon nods. "The supplies must not reach their destination. Beyond that, I leave the planning to you. Get me into Greyfalls."

"If I have to tear the walls down with my bare hands, you will enter that city," says Gallius flatly. She turns to the warriors, "Who among the new recruits is the trustiest rider? I wish.." She looks upward, eyes locking on a small, white bird. The creature dives down, landing abruptly on her shoulder. "I apparently need but think and my wishes will be granted." Gallius sets down her spear, turning to draw out a message from a small scroll case tied to the bird's leg. "Roleyn is already moving. I am to send back information about our position and they will hurry to us. Hmm." The lady tsks softly, "Apparently only 500 horsemen, but every bit is an aid, and they bring with them siege weapons. Have you seen a trebuchet before, Valon?" The lady grins, "If not, in a few days you will have to see a demonstration."

"Oh, always from the wrong side," quips the Lunar, and his warriors chuckle in agreement.

Gallius laughs softly at Valon, "Well, this time around you need not dance with falling stones and not be able to return fire." She turns about the piece of paper and draws out a small piece of marking coal. "With luck they will be here days before the battle begins. Then we can lay our plans more carefully. Do we know what tricks the enemy will have? I imagine they have been making many deals with spirits to protect this place."

"They have mines, we cannot find, my lady," one of the warriors says, gruffly. "Tunnels too. How many, where, if, we do not know. Guild soldiers, arms, perhaps more. Two sky-ships we have seen. Many sorcerers."

Gallius hmms and slips the paper into the holder, then urges the bird to fly off, back where it came from. "Tunnels and mines. And sorcerors," says Gallius. "Well, it would be dull if my first major offensive was easy, I guess." The lady turns to Valon, "I imagine we hope to win this fight without playing rough with those sorcerors."

"They will be the communicators and coordinators. The Realm fights with magic," Valon says softly. "Slay them quickly and Greyfalls would crumble within a week."

"It is easy to say, and I shall find a way that it can be done," says Gallius. "Even a sorceror must worry about wearing the plumage on the end of one of these," and the lady leans to tap a finger on one of the warriors' arrows.

Valon and the warriors chuckle, and not at all in a friendly way. "If it can be done, decorate whoever you can," the Lunar suggests. "Beyond that, I expect that most of the forces that remain behind the walls will be the Realm's own men."

Gallius nods to Valon, "I don't plan on holding back when dealing with their sorcerors. Do we have any idea who their leader is?"

Valon shakes his head. "It is not known. Perhaps not even to them, hmm? Their general staff is led by a woman named Alcis, but I do not even know her House or family. I do not know who she listens to among the civil administration, if she does at all."

"Alcis," murmurs Gallius. "Well, at least my enemy has a name. Perhaps before the end I may put a face to it." She studies the crude map closely, planning out a defense in her mind. "I hope she's stupid," she finally says, laughing softly.
