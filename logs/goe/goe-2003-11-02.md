The day is a dry and exhausting one. Gallius has only just finished raiding the city and nearly dying at the hands of her rival. She stands looking over the village. She turns at the sound of an apeman shout and she offers a nod as Bloody Axe draws near. "War leader," he offers for greeting. His voice is like gravel, but at least under that rough tone is a hint of respect.

The Lady smiles, letting out a sigh, "Captain. Is there some news you would bring to me?" The apeman snorts and speaks in the same harsh manner, "I have found something for you." He scowls, "Perhaps nothing, perhaps something you would wish to see." The Lady considers the apeman carefully, then laughs softly, "As long as we don't have to kill each other."

At this Bloody Axe laughs his unpleasant, gutteral laugh. There are no more words offered, then. He simply begins to move swiftly away, and Gallius must pursue him or be left behind. It is an odd, silent journey. The sun shines, the wind blows, but to Gallius it seems that she moves through a curious dream, following her former rival on and on. It is a marathon of sorts, or perhaps another test, she imagines to herself. A test that drags on for some 20 miles.

Bloody Axe only slows when the chase leads well into a wooded area. By now the daylight has nearly ended, leaving the forest in a pale darkness. The apeman leans down, studying the ground carefully. He holds a hand up to Gallius and grunts, "It moves swifty when it wishes, but it seems to be waiting for us. Come."

The way now is cautious, with Gallius following her guide. She asks no questions, nor does she fear trechery from Bloody Axe. He follows her orders now, and this therefore must be of great importance. The course is difficult, with many windings that few could read, but Bloody Axe passes through them all. He pauses suddenly and points ahead, "There. You must go and find it there. I have done what was needed. I will await your return, war-leader." Once Gallius nods to him, he moves swiftly away, leaving her in the forest. It does not even occur to her that she barely remembers the direction the village lies.

But it matters little, for her path lies ahead, and not back. Whatever she was brought here for was important and meant for her alone. Thoughts race through her head, many of which linger on terrible. They all shatter as a high, clear voice reaches her ears. Gallius follows this voice that calls her like a beacon and just as the last sunlight falls through a break in the wood she beholds her.

Jin-nu stands singing in the light of the sun, glimmering. In front of her sets a small tree, and to it she sings in the forest tongue. But what creature is this that sings in the woods?

Gallius studies the equine closely, marvelling at the golden coat it bears. On the head of the proud creature is a long horn of golden pink, and her hooves are of the same material. Her eyes are a deep violet and her voice seems to Gallius more beautiful than any sound she has heard.

Enchanted, Gallius simply stands, listening. But the song kindles in her a power that she hadn't felt before. Not knowing the words her voice joins that of Jin-nu, mingling like the light of the stars and the moon.

Jin-nu does not turn, but raises her voice, drawing with it that of her partner, so that soon the forest is like a cup overflowing with sweet sounds. Almost outside her will Gallius' feet move, carrying her out of hiding and into the clearing.

She moves ahead of Jin-nu, stepping lightly, each motion part of the song, every movement of the wind, every sighing limb. Gallius moves closer and finally kneels in front of Jin-nu, their voices intertwined like leaves as the song goes on and on, not ending with the day, but lasting into the passing of the moon.

Bathed thus in silver light, their song moves from the forest and over the plains, crashing into rivers and vaulting up waterfalls to play among the stars themselves. The beauty of the flawless moon is twisted into tones far too beautiful for words and on the song goes, and seasons seem to come and go, like snowflakes moving past. Light comes again, and the Sun shines brightly in a sky made entirely of sound.

Minutes pass unwasted as the two voices join again and again in thought and desire, creating worlds and visions that have never been, for in the Wyld all things that may be are. With the passing of clouds above the song finally falls into a gentle murmur, and though Jin-nu and Gallius simply look at each other, the song does not end.

Neither seems willing to speak, but eventually Jin-nu breaks this quiet, "Humans do not see the world that way." Gallius smiles and nods slowly, "I am not sure that I am human anymore. I was once, but now a harder path lies ahead."

"You do not fear it," says Jin-nu softly.

"No, I do not," answers Gallius. "Fear is a thing best lost. I have learned that I may be cautious without being frightened, and I may be brave without being foolish. I must be, for I am an emissary now."

"You stand among the Chosen," Jin-nu says simply. "Your vision is greater than those who trudge through life, your song is free of worry and fear. There are no voices like this among mortals."

Gallius smiles and for a time is silent. Finally she nods, "I am Chosen. I have come to let the world know the words of the Unconquered Sun. The lies of the past must be banished with the light of truth. For all this, though, I am not greater than anyone else. At least I wish not to be. I would raise the world to greater heights rather than stand above it wreathed alone in the light."

"Why do you come here, where the forest would hide the light of the Sun?" asks Jin-nu softly.

"The Unconquered Sun sees all things, and even the mansions of the earth are in his power," answers Gallius. "And even in the places of darkness I might find comfort. Tell me, please, who are you?"

"I am as you have seen me," answers Jin-nu. "I do not know what I was, but I am Jin-nu. I live in the woods, where the eyes of men might not seek me, or in seeking, not find me."

"Yet you wished me to find you," says Gallius. "I heard you calling. Your song drew me where I might well have simply hidden and stared in wonder."

"The woods were growing quiet, and often I wish to no longer sing alone," says Jin-nu. "Voices are not meant to carry song forever on their own," she explains. "Thus you say you were called, but I was not calling you. The song was."

Gallius smiles, listening to the song that still goes on. "I hear it now, but it is like a whisper. Before it was so clear." She considers carefully Jin-nu and offers, "My name is Gallius, and I too am not meant to be on my own. If the song called me here, I call you now to join a greater orchestra, for the future of many words is at stake."

"You wish for the voice of Jin-nu to leave this wood with you?" asks the horse softly. "That is much to ask, for the outside has ever been a place of danger and fear for those who have laid long in hiding."

"And yet all things have value, and hiding such beauty diminishes the light outside the wood, though it casts a brilliance among the trees," answers Gallius. "And yet our song tells me more important than this is our bond. Let us find our way together, Jin-nu. We will create such a song that all who hear it will fall silent, waiting only to hear the next word. We will bring that song back here one day, I promise you."

Jin-nu considers this for a time and turns to look among the trees. "Long will our lyric wind about the boles of this forest ere we return," she murmurs. "And yet to the trees it shall seem but a little while," answers Gallius. "Come, let us go from this place together!" The lady rises, her arms spread out.

And Jin-nu strides forward, pressing into this embrace. "Very well," she answers softly. "Let us make our way. But a lady should not walk on the earth, but ride. Climb onto my back and I shall carry you swiftly where you wish as long as you will it."

Gallius hugs her new friend and smiles. "We will go together, Jin-nu," she agrees, leaping onto the back of the horse. "Let us find the way."

The way back to the camp is far shorter than Gallius remembers, and along the way the two friends speak of all they have seen under sun, star, and moon. Hopes and dreams and fears are shared freely, and by the time Gallius and Jin-nu return, the sun is rising. As it moves above the horizon Gallius laughs for joy, and the brilliant rays of the Unconquered Sun turn the returning war-leader and her mount into a blinding, dazzling display for the villagers and the army.

As she rides past Bloody Axe, Gallius simply says, "I have found what I sought. At last I am ready." To this, the captain nods silently.
