Though time seems to not travel at all at Yu-Shan, things still can and do happen here. Gallius and Kirri have spent hours talking, followed by a short rest. Like children before their birthdays, they cannot sleep long, and soon they are up and eager to explore more. Kirri leads the way, pulling her sister forward and laughing. "Easy now, that is attached, you know!" teases Gallius, only to earn a wry grin from Kirri. "Oh dear, I wouldn't want to damage the future Queen of Roleyn! Much less one of the chosen! I had best be careful," she teases. Gallius grins and the two rush onward.

Kirri leads the way eagerly. Gallius has no idea just where she is going, save that she was told she had to hear something. "You will love it, sister. A feast for the ears!"

The way is not short. Or maybe it is. Time is hard to follow for Gallius here. The way ends at a huge building, somehow shaped like a giant shell. And seemingly made of the actual substance. "This is incredible," Gallius murmurs. It has no door, per se, but it's entrance is covered by a curtain of falling water.

Kirri steps close to the water, considering it for a moment. She reaches forward and draws it open, as if the flowing sheets of water really were a curtain. Gallius for a moment is surprised, but somehow it fits. As the curtain opens music pours out, the notes sweet and pure, obviously played by true masters.

Kirri draws her sister inside, and soon the two are bathed wholly in music. The way behind closes again, the flawless surface of the water settling where it was. For a moment, they are spellbound by the flowing sound and then together they following the passage which opens up into an enormous room, easily three hundred feet across and twice as long. The roof is dizzyingly high. "Oh my," murmurs Gallius. "It's just like they said it would be," whispers Kirri. Even when they speak the song is molded about their words, finding a place for them in the melody.

A pair of attendants, green as the grass and flowing with the vital energy of life as they walk, approach Gallius and her sister. In their hands are white masks, with patches of black where the mouths ought to be. "These will be worn _For your speech is all wrong_ You may both take them off _When you join in the song," they sing, one alternating with the other to sing the lines. "Wait for the time_ When you feel you can sing _There's no need to rhyme_ You may do anything," they further advice, in lilting voices, before leaving the masks with the visitors and drawing back to their place.

Gallius looks at the mask, then to Kirri, who is smiling. She tries her hand immediately, singing softly, "I fear we are both caught _and all is for naught_ if we realize our fears _and put mask over ears." Kirri raises an eyebrow, running a finger over the mask before she replies in song, "My dear you are right_ these masks are a danger _though they be white_ they'd make song a stranger."

As one the two find places

And set themselves down

Listening to the traces

of sweet flowing sound.

With music dancing, dear Kirri's smile grows

Though sorrow is sent lancing through her heart as the blows

of the horn grow more softer and sad

the musicians summon images of a time gone mad.

And the tone she grows warmer, a lover's carress

Yet soon the drums pounding reveal the stress

Of a time when the chosen of the dragon rose

And the Solars had fault in the land's many woes.

But the song's tale goes on,

And no end can be heard.

For the players are still listening

And this song is their word.

Have they forgotten, Helios' Chosen ones?

That all light in origin must come from the Sun.

Or do they tarry here listening because they fear naught

Not even the stirring of a dark, shadow plots?

Yet the time is now dim and the light must again rise

For the few who are gathered reach up to the skies

There is their source, their essence, their life

Even while over the land lies bitter strife

The Unconquered Sun is calling, he's calling

To those who rise from their slumber

The world needs you now, to keep her from falling

before the sun's rays turn to umber.

Walking and sitting, a maid joins the pair

As both feel the music, noble and fair,

Creep deep into soul and sinew and bone.

They realize slowly they're now not alone.

Greetings are given, in language that's sweet,

A joyous occasion, when strangers should meet.

Opinions are asked of the music that's heard

And for a moment the princess can utter no word.

Speech fail Gally, itself rather strange.

She replies with a note at the end of her range,

And adding a second, and a third in as well,

And the joy in her voice has a tale to tell.

The strange woman listens, smiling along.

She too, and Kirri three, join in the song.

It syncs with the music, and flows like a dream,

The river of song is joined by its stream.

Their words flow like honey mingling with brass

and reeds and the bass, and with the clink of a glass

as chimes are sent calling out over the din

binding the noises and the melody within

The song rises softly, the reeds to the fore

And the drums though present are to be ignored

For the song here grows smooth like a purring lion

And against the sweet ache, useless is tryin'

To hold back the tears from pain thus revealed

As parts of the song one by one are congealed

And the tune is one sound no notes to be made out

from the flowing of strings louder than a shout

Called at the beginning of time and left to be heard

Through every last day in ev'ry age of the Earth.

And here we stand still in the midst of time

Fluid as ever no matter that rhyme

Holds us like chains on a path we know little

For the ways of our fates are petty and fickle.

Yet we can all hope even now where it's dark

That on some great voyage we have yet to embark

The truth that we've known will be with us inside

Though many times distractions put a kink in our strides

Let our eyes see the truth and judge matters well

To shatter the lies and break the spell

That lies on the land like a raven cloak

And makes clear the truths that to us were spoke

For the sun is our father and his joy is ours

And if ever we strive then like golden bars

His light we reflect to the joy of all men

Who are true of heart and free from the fen

Of shadow and falsehoods that would lead us all

Away from our Sun and his true call.

And thus let us be free and remember the way

To end this long night and restore light of day.

The music calms itself for a time, and there is a polite smattering of applause. No song can last forever, and even silence is a vital part of music.

Gallius lets out a soft sigh, and simply relaxes, the words sung lost somehow, sent back perhaps to the nothing from which they came. She looks to Kirri and smiles. For now, there are no words.

Time passes, and some peculiar arrangement begins making itself seen on the 'floor'. An unknown man, a spirit by the look of him, takes the center stage, bearing a foreign instrument in his hand.

Around him, a few musicians begin to congregate. One with a stringed guitar or lute of some kind, another with a tambourine, still another with nothing at all save her voice. The stranger places his odd instrument to his lips and begins to blow, using his fingers to arrange the intricate controls.

The sound produced is hard to describe. The tone is clear, there is not blatting or wind to be heard, but yet it has a power. Like the deepest humming it sounds, almost like a cat's purr, yet higher and more fluid. It glides without effort from the lowest edge of its range to the very heights, untroubled somehow by the motion. Gallius watches this strange thing slowly. Somehow it is a familiar sound, heard in the wind, or hidden from the normal ear in the endless call of a waterfall, and though she's never heard it alone, now it is clear that it is a sound found in many things and here purified.

The maiden of Roleyn searches her memory, pushing back cobwebs of half-forgotten memories. Soon, though, even this stops and the sound is all. It is soft, yet can cut like a knife. It can be sad or joyous, blaring one moment and carressing sweetly the next. Somehow to her this one instrument captures all that she is and knows. All she has seen or touched or smelled, all she has heard and felt. For a time the sound leaves tears on her cheeks as it plays out so easily the promise of a summer's day after so many years without hope.

But the true power of it that resonates strongest in Gallius comes not from the joy, but the empathy of the instrument. The sound knows pain, has seen it and felt. It is pain. The pain of disappointments after such high expectations. It knows what she fears, and with gentle flows it lets her face them one by one. It knows other things besides, things she has never seen, emotions are put into her that she has no words for. They simply are. Shades of sadness, joy, pity, and excitement that she'd felt many times, but simply hadn't paid any attention to. Until now.

Finally, the player ceases, and his accompaniment ceases as well, winding down their performance. The troupe bows to all and sundry, then breaks apart, with the spirit - dressed in the white and embroidered robes of the city of Yu-Shan - approaches Gallius with a smile.

Gallius looks up at the spirit, rising to her feet. Or was she always standing? The song leaves her wandering half in a dream. Her voice is left mute as she watches the spirit approach. She simply smiles as tears briefly trapped halfway down her cheeks flow further, gliding towards her chin unheeded.

"You have my spark," the man says, softly enough. What an odd greeting. "Well, it's not mine anymore... It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Jyamis." He extends his hand.

Gallius reaches out, taking the offered hand. "I am Gallius," she answers softly. "Your spark?" she asks softly. Does he mean? It couldn't be. "Oh, this is my sister," she adds, indicating Kirri, who rises to offer a silent greeting.

Jyamis inclines his head to Kirri, then nods to her sister and speaks again. "It's a pleasure to meet you both. Can we go somewhere and speak?"

Gallius and Kirri lead the way to a place where they might speak. A little ways off the beaten path, near a fountain of blue smoke. The sisters sit down and Gallius says, "So you bore the spark once upon a time. I imagine things were very different, then."

Jyamis nods slowly. "I assume so. I have been busy with my duties in Heaven, and so much has changed...I have not seen it, only glimpsed fragments of the world as it is." He pats his strange instrument, which he still carries, with a soft and loving hand. "Some things, though, remain with me forever."

"What is that instrument?" asks Kirri. "I've never seen its like." Gallius smiles, her sister is again reading her mind. "We'd both like to hear more about you, Jyamis, if you have the time to tell us," adds Gallius.

"And I you. But first, the love of my life..." He smiles a little. "This is an ophicleide, a serpent-horn. I crafted it in my days in Creation. I have few other memories, but I do remember that somewhere my first one still rests, and I blew my last breath upon it. I cannot remember feeling more contented." The man lets out a wistful sigh.

"You mean one of these is still out there where the living walk?" asks Kirri, suddenly very interested. "I wonder where it might be! Ahh, but I suppose it matters little, as long as I can hear this one played so well." Gallius is in agreement, "The sound is amazing. I've never heard of such an instrument. I fear their making was lost to us."

Jyamis' face is a study in disappointment. "I... see," he half-whispers. "And I had thought.... but no matter." The sadness fades and he smiles again, nostalgically. "Perhaps I was not meant for such a lasting legacy."

"There is still hope for your legacy," answers Gallius. "If the instrument can be found, there are those of craft and skill yet to play and reproduce them." She smiles, feeling only pity for this spirit whose creation was lost. "If you will permit it, I will seek the work of your hands."

Jyamis nods. "I have had time to craft more. Here... if it will aid you, take this one." And he extends the ophicleide he had been playing. The instrument feels warm to the touch, and though it has no innate magic that Gallius' Exalted intuition can discern, it throbs with the power of its craftsman and his home city. "Then you need not trouble yourselves. But... if you were to seek out the one I once bore, I would be eternally grateful to you."

"I will find it for you, Jyamis," answers Gallius. She holds the instrument carefully, settling her hands upon it. "Part of everything is in this," she murmurs. "Metal of the earth has been fired to form it, pearls of the ocean mark the keys, and the wind of your breath flows through it," Gallius says. "You give a great gift, my friend. I hope I am worthy of it."

"You bear my spark, the gift of the Unconquered Sun. You cannot fail to be worthy," says Jyamis, reassuringly. "It is not in you."

Gallius examines the instrument still, simply holding it. Kirri whispers to her, "It longs to be played, can't you hear it?" Gallius is suddenly a bit shy, looking from Kirri to Jyamis. Well, she has played instruments with reeds before. They just weren't anything like this one. Carefully she settles the mouthpiece between her upper lip and her lower teeth, just a little skin pinned between. With a few experimental blows she begins to produce something of a smooth tone, though nothing compared to the mastery of Jyamis.

The man sits back, smiling with a strange and charmed expression on his face. He seems content, now, simply to listen and enjoy the sound of his creation being used by another.

Kirri listens closely, watching her sister find her way with the instrument. It is not a quick study, by any means, but it plays better and easier than most instruments Gallius has seen and heard. She begins to get steady and stronger, so that the darkness of silence is shoved further away and the air grows warm with the melody she begins to find.

Jyamis nods approvingly, saying nothing. His face and eyes speak for him, for something has been offered him that has been lacking for time uncounted. Nothing could take away the joy he now finds in the performance, it seems.

Gallius' play gathers strength as her confidence grows, and soon there is essence put into it, as well, the sound summoning visions of wind over the grass of Roleyn. He wished to know of her, and so her tale begins to appear in front of his eyes, images flickering. Casus is there, and Kirri, and her father. She rides over the plains and faces Ma-Ha-Suchi. The exaltation is brought to life. Each moment passes swiftly with the motions of music. After what to her seems hours her song comes to its conclusion. Here and now.

"The visions you have shown us are strange to me," says Jyamis, once the music sleeps again. "But when I watched you while I played, I could see what you felt. I am glad we found each other."

"As am I," answers Gallius. "Do you think in time I will come to dwell here?" she asks. "Ever has the world weighed on my mind, and now I find the song a release unlike any other. I hope one day all I need do is play here."

"The Unconquered Sun gathers his own," explains Jyamis. "Your soul goes to that which holds your allegiance. If you love the world, and cannot bear to part with it.. that is where you will stay. If you are the Sun's Chosen, he cares for you. But you have many thousands of years to live. Do not neglect them."

Gallius nods slowly, "And yet I am not daunted," she says softly. "That seems strange to me. I should feel worn with such a long time ahead, and yet it looks like it will not be so difficult. Now that I am here, and I know even better what I fight for, I am certain that we shall be victorious."

Jyamis nods. "In the years After, our purpose was clear to us. It faded, as we grew accustomed to empire. I declined immortality for that reason, because all that was left to me was beauty. I believe you have more to look forward to than I ever had. I envy you that."

"I hope to learn what I can of the mistakes of the past," says Gallius. "But it will be a difficult way. The journey is long, but it will be well worth it. I begin to think that maybe I am meant to guide my circle, somehow. I want to know how to help them when things grow difficult. I seek wisdom beyond that which I have."

Jyamis nods. "I am only a god of music and art here, now," he murmurs. "I have forgotten much of my mortal life, I fear. I found wisdom in beauty and art. Study that which is elegant and natural. You will understand wisdom from these things."

Only? Kirri laughs softly as Gallius' jaw works without making any sound. Kirri helps her sister snap out of it by poking her in the ribs. Gallius squirms a bit and clears the throat. "Music and art are what life is for, aren't they?" suggests Gallius. "Men may rule wisely and justly, but their memories would be for nothing without song and verse to remind us of them. Deeds once great are easily forgotten unless they are entrusted to the wisest of historians: the artist."

Jyamis brightens. "You see? You have wisdom already. And there is more, which you also know and have not said: that the artist will remember stupid actions with derision, and wise actions with fame. Therefore listen to the tales which the bard praises, and emulate the rulers whose fame the minstrels sing of with joy."

Gallius blushes and looks down at her hands. "I will try, Jyamis," she says softly. "It seems I have much to live up to," Gallius adds quietly. "I must wrestle with much confusion to find my way. I think now, though, that I am ready for even the most bitter pain and sadness. They will teach me."

Jyamis inclines his head and smiles, saying nothing at all.

Gallius smiles and winds an arm around her sister. "I am starting to learn why I came here," she explains. "Though I am rather leery of most parties, this one has joy that is real. Here you can really learn something of use and meet people you didn't know. And you find swiftly that you can love them as dear friends."

The man nods and chuckles softly. "That is the purpose of the Carnival," he agrees. "So it has been since the gods were gods."

Gallius nods slowly, smiling. For a time, she says nothing at all, letting her mind stray in thought. Kirri softly speaks up, "Jyamis, what was the name of the land you lived in? Was it at all like Roleyn, a place of rolling fields and whipping winds?"

Jyamis shakes his head, then struggles to think, concentration forming on his face. "The winds.." he says at last. "They carried the smell of the sea. I can remember them... I remember walking the cliffs, and smelling the tang of ocean water. It was... rocky, but green."

"It must have been very beautiful there," says Kirri. "What inspired you to first make this instrument?" Gallis listens eagerly, wondering just how it was that Jyamis came to make such a thing.

"A study of wind, and snakes, I suppose," murmurs the musician. "I knew that I wanted a different sound, like..... caves! Caves, when I was a boy. I had heard music as wind blew through caves, and I wanted to recreate it. With tunnels that I could open and close, as I wished. I happened to see a spotted snake, and it was at that moment I realized what I wanted. Thereafter I began to work carefully.."

Gallius tilts her head, smiling. "The result was something that speaks in all things, it would seem." Her voice remains quiet and calm. Kirri nods her agreement, "The sound is very lovely."

"What you hear is the sound of my childhood," replies Jyamis gently. "Perhaps all childhoods. Or so I like to think, in my more whimsical moments."

Gallius laughs warmly, "It reminds me of many things, and yet it is very much its own sound. It fills a hole somehow. It belongs."

Gallius turns the matter away from music, at least for the moment, "Did you serve here before things changed?" she asks. "I would like to know how it is meant to work. What my role is supposed to be."

"What change?" asks Jyamis curiously. "After I passed away, I lingered in darkness. I was brought out by the Unconquered Sun, and given a place of authority by Venus, the Maiden of Serenity. It is she who is matron of my craft, and she had sought someone to take the station I now hold."

"I mean before the Chosen of the Sun fell," she explains. Gallius sighs, "I just.. want to know what it was like. It would help to know how it was and why we failed. I know it was arrogance and pride, but I wish to know more details."

"Then I cannot help you, I fear," says Jyamis soberly. "I can only speak of the time After. The time when the world was given to us, the Exalted. Before then, the Primordials governed All That Is, and the gods and other spirits were their servants. But the Primordials were not at all like the gods, or humanity. There was fear..." He shakes his head. "I wish I could remember more. I remember rising up to fight, when the Sun came to us. I remember crafting my first weapon.. and my first instrument. I remember marriage.. I remember singing to my child..."

"Then I will have to know what I know," says Gallius. "And remember that many have fought before. The time I live in is not so dark. Many dangers have come and gone, and we are still here. We can only do what we are meant to do, and serve the Sun in the fashion we are suited for."

Jyamis nods and smiles. "It is a relief to hear. If I remember more that would be of service to you, I will convey it to you as rapidly as I can."

Gallius seems to have many questions, "Can you tell me about the spirits of the world, Jyamis? This is probably strange, but I was hoping you could help tell me about them. What they enjoy, what I can do to gain their trust and keep it. I have encountered some here already, and they were so happy to see me. If all creation were that way, the world would be a better place, would it not? If I guess rightly, Solars are sent forth to ease the world of its troubles."

"Most of the spirits in Creation are selfish, or lazy, or simply corrupt," says the musician softly, mournfully. "I once had a staff that rewarded the artists and players of a thousand courts, honoring them for their performances... Now, they neglect their duties, patronizing artists or cursing those that exceed their own ability. They are jealous and fretful, and no longer heed their duties. Perhaps I have grown soft as well, for I find the most peace here, playing to an audience, rather than attending to my own duties.."

"I will do the best I can for you," answers Gallius. "I have the loyalty of some good people, and if you are willing, we will play so that you might hear us. Yes, even here.. It is a small village, but they have good, strong hearts and though they are not of Roleyn I love them. I came with nothing and they have trusted me, and thus they are enriched by the gifts of the Unconquered Sun."

"Then I will be listening," smiles Jyamis.
