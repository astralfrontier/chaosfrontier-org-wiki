# Gods of Eden 2003-11-07

The lines of golden light proceed out of the park, in places that the others do not. Some of these lines lead towards a large building, carved seemingly out of a single aquamarine of a size beyond measure. It sparkles in the innumerable lights that radiate outward from the Carnival grounds. Great double doors of water spread wide, the water flowing through the night air of its own accord to let pass visitors.

Inside is an art gallery, where paintings of all shapes and sizes and descriptions hang. Each is numbered, framed in gold leaf, and each depicts a scene of some kind. After a few minutes of inspection, it's clear that the paintings reflect scenes from Creation itself. Here is a war-scene, dating from the Scavenger Lands almost twenty years ago, when Thorns fell. There is a gentle portrayal of the romance between the Scarlet Empress and her first lover, the nuances and facial expressions captured with intimate detail.

The paintings are more than mere reflections of the events in Creation... every emotion, every thought, everything about life seems to have been captured in the paintings herein. From the tender excitement of two lover's first kiss, to the sheer horror of the sigt of some beast who should not by any means exist... all are present. Ramar wanders inside this building, drawn by the waters and the light filtering outwards. Slowly he passes by each of the portraits hung here, gazing deep within them and almost losing himself within a few.

_Strange... it is as though I can feel myself there... or at least as though I know what each and every being protrayed within these pictures feels, and how they look, and I can almost imagine how they might sound. If I stare long enough, I fear I may be lost within..._ Ramar moves onwards, stepping silently through the gallery with an expression of awe on his face. Water nymph's frolicking with Mortals can be found on one wall, while next to it lies a picture of the Celestial City, decorated with a thousand different colors and thoughts. Peering closer, it's almost as though the painting itself is moving. A sense of order and dignified duty hangs over this painting, and yet just past the surface lies something hidden, something wonderful. It can be seen in the tiny trails of light left by the flitting courier spirits, ferrying messages between the gods. It is almost heard through the brass reeds that line the music halls. Here, a bureaucrat is captured, walking with arms full of paperwork, steppi

Here, a bureaucrat is captured, walking with arms full of paperwork, stepping from one bureau to the other, while two minor spirits follow closely behind. And yet through it all, there is also the sense of longing, of something lost. It takes a moment to realize that this painting is of ages past, of times long ago when things were different throughout Creation, before the dark curse had completely twisted the hearts of those who walk it's face, before the world had been usurped, before this... age of sorrow. Ramar stands before this painting curiously, dazzled almost, by the beauty and harmony that pervades the painting. _That will not be again... but perhaps, with time and hope, there will be another painting here in heaven, one of a city far greater than any have dreamed of..._ He steps back, turning from one painting only to find himself staring into eerily familiar eyes on the wall behind him.

Eyes as deep and as grey as Ramar's stare back at him, their stare as piercing as the Sun breaking through clouds, or as the falcon's cry. They are within sandy mists... surrounded by chaos on all sides... and yet the body that holds these eyes is illuminated from within. _Those are..._ A step back is all the movement Ramar can muster for now. The sands seem caught in te act of parting before him, flashing and fusing with determination and joy. A new path cutting through the chaos in the world... It is several minutes before Ramar breaks himself away from the picture, shaken somewhat. _There must be pictures of everyone up here..._ is his thought, as he finds another scene, a scene of the First Age given the look of it, given the sense of importance and unity.

A Ship, as exotic as any of the ancient buildings, glides upon a sea of light. It's threefold hulls glinting in the light of the Dawning Sun, casting it's shadows on the waters behind it. Yet this is not a scene of peace... no, turmoil and strife can be seen on the faces of those aboard the ship. Conflict. Figures that tower over the others, looking at once beautiful and terrible are shown being cut down where they stand, while other more numerous ones cut swaths of fury through those standing in their path. Yet both sides seem to believe they are right, both senses of unity on the crew and their former masters is captured with precise detailed strokes of the brush. A master artisan has captured the Essence that seems to flow throughout the whole painting, capturing the dark and all to real brutality that occured this day, long ago. Desparation on behalf of it's captain, shown fighting his way through to the helm of the ship, as the Sun shines furiously upon the battle below. Ramar shudders, and as he

Ramar shudders, and as he does, he catches the title of the Ship. The _Dawning Sun Indomitable._

After stepping back from the painting of the furious fight aboard the exotic ship, Ramar casts his gaze about once more. _Perhaps..._ his mind wanders as the sights of scenes from Creation's past stretch out in front of him, lining the walls in frames of silver and gold. After a moment, though, he finds what he might have been looking for. A few careful steps guide him to the curator of this gallery, the one whom organizes the paintings and likely knows them inside and out. He speaks in a friendly manner, "Greetings to you."

The curator is a being garbed in robes of shimmering white snowflakes that fall into place around it's body, accenting the official garb it wears beneath. It regards Ramar with a similar curious look in it's solid black eyes. It's voice is as soft as a whisper, yet as artfully crafted as any of the paintings within the gallery. "And to you, Chosen of the Sun," is the reply. A long, gangly arm is extended, and Ramar takes it cordially. "Welcome to the Gallery of Creation. I am the Caretaker." Ramar bows his head respectfully, "It is a most impressive place, Caretaker. And I am pleased to see the wonders within it, and to meet the one responsible for it's care."

"Yes, most are when they see Creation before them, as it was, and as it is." The Curator mile, an odd gesture on an otherwise neutral face. It turns and gestures at the gallery of hundreds of thousands of paintings. "Such beauty all should behold someday," muses Ramar, taking another look around. "I concur, Quill of Heaven. And I see by the look on your face you have seen yourself, or some semblance thereof in the great paintings. Everyone is in them, at some point... a place within these halls can be found for almost everyone." Ramar smiles at this, "Indeed. I imagine that even the humblest of merchants has his day, as does the mightiest of kings. I am honored, and I hope to see more. I wonder if perhaps you might help me to find a particular series of paintings? Or help me to understand who creates these paintings?" The Curator smiles its odd little smile again. "Ah yes, of course. I am glad to enlighten others with regards to the Gallery, tell me what it is you had hoped to find, if you would?"

"I had hoped," muses Ramar, taking time to choose his words carefully, _I must be careful here to not give away too much, yet I should not worry about being so vague that I forget or obfuscate my purpose needlessly,_ he continues "To find paintings of the world in time gone past, to see all of Creation, moreso than maps, I mean. And perhaps paintings of how the world stands now?" The Curator pauses a moment, though its smile remains. "Ah yes, this way." It turns on long spindly legs, and begins heading towards a staircase composed of water, flowing in the shapes of the steps, flowing both up and down at once. "Sadly, there are few to no new paintings brought in. Formerly, spirits and... well... other interested partes... were those who brought the art here, to see that the art of Creation itself was preserved for all time. Since things have changed... that process has lessend." A hint of sadness and longing creeps into the Curator's voice. Ramar steps unsurely on the liquid staircase, finding it a

Ramar steps unsurely on the liquid staircase, finding it as solid as any stone. The Curator makes a turn down a hallway filled with glimmering light that seems to come from the air itself.In this room, paintings are hung along three walls, and a fourth stands blank, ready to be filled. "I see. I am sorry to hear that, for there are many things in Creation, many wondrous things that perhaps should be preserved..." Ramar gives a tilt of his head curiously, "How would someone capture the paintings as they are thusly, and bring them here? I at least am interested in rekindling this process, if I am permitted to speak of such things." It regards Ramar uncertainly for a moment "Here are the paintings of the First Age of Man, observe them and perhaps your question might be answered." it says, and it watches the Solar with a curious little smile.

_These paintings seem to surpass even the most skilled of mortal Artists... the Spirits must infuse their works with Essence and work with that which i beyond the ken of others... but perhaps in time..._ A soft smile spreads around his face. "I shall see what I can do to restore this process, Curator..." The Curator's eyes seem to sparkle, and it gestures to a painting wherein the eye of the painter has captured the flows and weaves of Essence, and here, it shows a painting filled with wonders of the cities of the First Age, their buildings reaching towards the sky, almost beyond all imagination. Ramar asks, after a time, "Are there paintings from the era of the Shogunate? From before the Contagion... in the East? I have always found that land a marvel, and it may help me in a small trouble."

"There are not many, I am afraid. What few I can show you are here within these walls," speaks the Curator. It gestures towards an almost barren wall, when compared to he others. "If you are looking for paintings during the Scarlet Reign, these might be them. I hope you find what it is you are seeking, Quill of Heaven." Ramar nods, "And I in turn hope that these walls are filled before long. And that guests return to this building with more frequency." Ramar smiles politely, turning to gaze over the paintings he'd been shown. As he does, the Curator walks along the walls of the Gallery, every now and again a long gangly arm reaching out to casually straighten or dust, or brush off the pictures present. And it too cannot help but stare at some of them, though in it's eyes there is more than simple awe. Ramar muses to himself... _These are perhaps the Curators greatest treasures... perhaps Greyfalls will be a scene worthy of a painting, should an artist e found._

Ramar pushes that thought from his mind for the time, and lets his thouhts drift back to the maps and things he had one through in his search for the fortress that had gone missing hundreds of years ago, _The clues are there, and perhaps there are more here, when the world was painted as it was back then... perhaps there is a way to narrow down our search to be found within these walls._

After finishing his studies of the paintings, Ramar turns to find the Curator, wandering the halls of its Gallery. He bows respectfully, addressing the being once more. "I thank you for taking the time to show me the sights I have seen. I feel more inspired now, having seen the great deeds that have been done in the world." The Curator smiles, regarding Ramar, "May you return then, and may you find your own manner of inspiring others." Ramar gives a soft smile of appreciation, "Thank you. Might I ask where I would find pictures of those who once lived in the first age, I would like to perhaps see how life truly was back in that time, rather than learn only through the dreams and old ruins of what once was." The Curator bows its head, and as it does its robes shimmer just slightly. "Come then, and I shall show you one of my favorite paintings."

The Curator wanders down the almost labyrinthine halls of the Gallery. Like many things it is not quite what it appears, seeming larger inside than it is from without. Ramar's footsteps begin echoing softly, caught and reflected by walls of flowing water that are shot through with gusts of crystalline air. Every now and again the Curator turns, and with a wave of its spindly alabaster hands, the waters part before it. Ramar notes the paintings they pass, each one almost more fantastic than the last. Here a great battle is fought, with the light of a band of Solars holding back a tide of immeasurable darkness, demons glowering at them with hatred and fear... there, on another side of a wall ships more glorious and complicated than any skyship Ramar has seen sar through a sea of clouds, with spirits gliding alongside them.

The journey continues, and through it Ramar glimpses the destruction of a monstrous behemoth, and the birth of a glittering palace of gold. The terrible armies of the Wyld Advancing on Creation draw a shudder, as do those paintings hinting at the darkness that has fallen over parts of the world. And yet through it all the Curator wanders ever, until at last they reach their destination. There is but one painting floating in air, illuminated by light that seems to come from it's own frame. It takes a moment to see through the glare, but Ramar endures, that he might view the painting within.

Within the frame's illumination lies a road, and towering buildings of Orichalcum loom in the background... but at the forefront of things there is a mother, watching over her children, a peacful smile in her eyes. The two children play in the streets, they play without worry, without fear, without the burden of the world lain on their shoulders. In the distance a baker pushes his wares as a pair of lovers cast flirting glances towards one another, and as Ramar continues to view the paintings, more and more people, simply living out their lives surrounded by the wonders of the First Age, but far removed from the dangers therein... it is a calm painting. One that displays the serenity that was strived so hard to achieve during the First Age of Man, and even in those Warriors of the Sun, the look of their goals met, of their loved ones alive can be seen. And the world stretches as far as the eye cares to see, limitless possibilities painted against a sky of tranquility.

"Here, Quill of Heaven, here is life as it truly was in the First Age. In the days when the great war had ended, in the days after the heavens had been calmed, and those imprisoned beneath the Earth had yet to find a way to work their tendrils within Creation. Here, there was simply life. Such a thing may never be seen again in Creation, yet that is merely because things are not as they were. Nor will they be, nor should they be. That is why it is the past... but I believe you feel this is so already." Ramar nods, slowly, speaking beyond him for the moment. "But things can change," he adds at long last. "And life goes on, whether we move with it or not. The world may never be as it was, but it shall be, and while I am alive, I shall do my best to make it greater than anything that has come before." The Curator smiles knowingly, "As many will. But do not be consumed by this, or any other desire." A pause, "You are an interesting being, Quill of Heaven. I invite you to return once more, in ages hence, an

"I invite you to return once more, in ages hence, and we will see what has been added."
