The Lady Gallius has spent most of her time with her sister, enjoying the time together greatly. But there is a most serious matter of business to attend to, and there is no time like the present. Of course, her search is going to be rather difficult, and so she's asked for her friends to join her who are not otherwise busy. She explains herself to Chi-Yosh and Ramar rather simply, "I wish to find the Goddess Mars, Maiden of Battles."

"I wish to speak to her too," Replies Chi-Yosh. A thought had occured to him earlier, while conversing with someone, and it has been a thorn in his side. Mars might have the answer he seeks. "Let us not take too much of her time about Greyfalls."

"Very well. Hrmm..." Ramar nods curiously, glancing up to Gallius as she arrives. He takes a sip of what looks to be colors made fluid, and sets the glass back down. "We shall find her, and perhaps we might find the other four of the Maidens with her. I imagine that we shall have to approach on business though..." Ramar strokes his chin thoughtfully, standing. The silvery robe flutters softly as a Celestial wind blows past. He straightens the crown atop his head, and looks around, "Shall we find her then?"

The Pavilion wherein the Unconquered Sun, Luna, the Maidens and Gaia currently dwell is apparently unguarded. Perhaps such beings need no guards; their presence is enough to deter any who lack legitimate business to call upon them. Nevertheless the trio of Solars approach the door to it, and explain in quiet tones to a messenger-spirit the nature of their visit. The spirit departs, returning moments later and inclining its head. "Enter and be welcomed," it lilts, leading the way.

Gallius enters with a grim expression. This is nothing but business to her, and it may have a very high price. "Let us trust to the wisdom of the Gods," she says softly, though just whom she is speaking to is uncertain.

Within, the eight gods are relaxing on divans. At the center of the room is a map, but what a map! It is as though Creation's every detail was perfectly recreated on a miniature scale, even to the heights of mountains and the flow of rivers, the clouds and the occasional speck of movement as a particularly large caravan makes its way across the roads of the world. Eight heads look up, as the Solars approach. "Welcome," booms Helios, smiling. "You come at an auspicious time to discuss these matters. Speak."

There are several moments spent in sheer awe as Ramar gazes upon the wonders of the map of Creation. He peers at it, moments before his attention is captured by the deitires themselves. It is quite the attempt, but he manages to keep his mouth from dropping open, or from swooning. He stands, looking as composed as one can be in the presence of these eight beings.

Gallius falls to her knee, pressing both hands open on the floor before her. Her voice is clear and somehow both meek and confident at the same time. "My Lords," she begins, "If my understanding is right, a great battle is about to begin. Thousands of lives hang in the balance, and yet this whole contest is but a message, itself a beginning. I find myself at a crossroads and I seek to know the will of the Gods. I wish to know what can be done to most please those who are before and above me so that I might make their dreams real. Tell me, if it is your will, what you wish of me and my Circle."

The Unconquered Sun glances at his guests and companions, and smiles genially. "Child of mine, do you know the promise you made to me when you Exalted?" he asks.

Chi-Yosh's face is not as grim as his Circlemate's. While the state of affairs may be grim, the air is not, and he won't sour it. Respect in the fashion of a light bow and a smile offered to the Eight. His eyes are drawn to the map, and this is given a thorough eyeing, but Gallius begins to speak, and attention must be payed.

"You asked me to fight and to use your gifts," answers Gallius. She allows the smallest smile to curve her lips as she looks upwards at Helios. "I have not forgotten."

The Unconquered Sun nods. "Just so. I wish for you to reclaim your birthright. I wish for you to become masters of Creation again. I wish for justice and glory."

Gallius seems lost in thought for a moment, then says, "Much time has passed. We are divided and have forgotten much which we should know, my Lord. I believe the key to true victory is preventing the loss of the innocent. Even a fool can take up arms and kill, but the true power of a warrior is to take up arms and save lives. I am but one, and though I feel your power, Lord, I know I am still a child."

Chi-Yosh listens to Gallius's words and feels his own concern echoed therein. Any can kill and to save lives is their cause, but when is the right time to kill for that cause? When is it neccessary, or should it be always avoided? They have come for business, and while plagued with the question, he does not speak out.

"A child thinks only of himself. You are not a child," remarks Luna softly, smiling. Helios nods. "If the innocents weigh on your mind, do all that is in your power to succor them."

"And so we shall," says Ramar, his voice reverent in tone. His eyes dart across the Eight, and when he speaks, they rest on whom he is speaking to. "And though I cannot profess to know the intimate details of our endeavors, I believe I know why we are here. We have come here this night to ensure we are doing all we can to preserve the innocents, and those who need our protection in this matter." He glances towards Gallius, checking to make sure that this is indeed what they have come for, then back to the Eight, thoughts reeling as he attempts to find the best way to phrase his next statement.

"I believe then, that in the interest of doing what is in our power to do to preserve life and to see that the Course of events within Creation are for the best... it is aid we have come here seeking, if we are indeed permitted to seek such a thing." Ramar keeps his voice reverent, moreso than with anyone he has ever spoken with. "It is a delicate matter this, I imagine, so we put the question to you delicately, and perhaps Gallius can explain things in greater detail than I, if it is allowed."

"If we wish to avoid killing those who might become our friends, they must understand in some way that their cause is unjust," says Gallius. "I wish for help in doing this. I want the slaves of the Realm to know they face the power not of just an army, but a force blessed and favored by the Gods. I come here to ask, nay! to beg that you will help me spare them their lives which they would otherwise throw away, thinking they are doing what is right. If these people see that they stand against the truth and the light, I know they will be quicker to cast down their spears and listen to us."

"Then reveal yourselves as Chosen," murmurs one of the Maidens - Jupiter. The others fall silent as the Maiden of Secrets speaks, her half-whispered voice sending a slight shiver down the necks of the Solars. "But... a man cannot see what he will not open his eyes to look at. If some stay blind, that is how it must be."

Chi-Yosh watching the celestial bodies, his tongue finally loosens. At first his eyes are on Helios, but as he speaks, attention drifts between the Unconquered Sun, Mars, and the Maiden of Endings. "I agree with what Gallius has said. We are your hands, my Lord, but do you wish bloody justice?" Words are carefully selected, for he does not wish to let the river of his mouth run forever. "It is our decision to do what we do, but is to kill our enemies ever neccessary? Or should it?"

Jupiter inclines her head toward her sister, Saturn, the Maiden of Endings, who speaks. "Those who do not raise a hand against any man will find themselves in the grave next to those who murder thousands in cold blood," she intones. Helios nods as well. "You must choose for yourselves what you will do." He smiles a little, regarding each Solar in turn. "But know that I would not have granted the Exaltation if I foresaw that your choices would anger me. I have turned my eyes from the Solars in times past. I do not do it now."

"Then we shall be revealed to them," says Gallius. "And we will destroy those who cannot see, for their lives as thralls to falsehood hold little joy for those about them." She pauses for just a moment, "And when Greyfalls is in our hands, we will not let them forget who has saved them."

Chi-Yosh cannot argue. He did not intend for complete pacifism, but perhaps the Maiden of Endings means that if someone is not stopped, it will not end. But bringing up such a petty point is unneeded. He can only smile at Helios, and know that while he may not be certain, the Sun god will not have erred in his judgement.

"If it is not seen as hubris or error, I wish that after the war, the first things we build shall be great temples, one to each of you here, so that men will remember well and know where they might go to find their answers," says Gallius. She looks longest at Luna, her eyes indicating some thought that she holds back, yet. "I have found what I came for, and I have no doubts. There shall be a sign in us that will show those arrayed against us of their folley."

The Unconquered Sun smiles. "You speak bravely. Be as bold on the field of battle, and I will not allow it to go unnoticed."

"I am not sure, my Lord, if it is bravery anymore," answers Gallius. "In my birthplace it was said that only frightened men could be brave. I see no point in fear, now. What shall be, shall be, and it is not for me to fear it. Mine is the purpose of the Unconquered Sun. Who shall stand above me if he does not will it?"

"We shall be bold, and in doing so, we shall ensure that you will not go unnoticed. Or unrevered. In our own way we shall continue to serve you, that we may remain worthy of having your eyes trained on us, instead of turned away once more." Ramar bows respectfully, and he looks towards the Unconquered Sun, smiling as he looks upon him. He speaks, as though to everyone, "Thank you."

"There is something else," murmurs Jupiter softly. "Something you three have not yet spoken of."

"There is..." Ramar ponders this revelation. A moment passes by, and in this moment, which to Ramar is almost an eternity of unspoken thoughts and half-thought dreams, of questions and answers sought in the depths of his mind, and he speaks once more "Well this is true, there likely is much we have not yet spoken of, although it is because we are unsure as to whether or not it would be worth speaking... or even how to phrase such things, however I would ask which it is that we have not yet spoken of that you refer to? And I ask only to avoid confusion and second-guessing on our part as to what this matter is."

"So there is much you have not spoken of?" suggests Jupiter, her half-whisper innocent and unassuming. "Perhaps you should mention it all." She shows her teeth in a strangely unsettling grin.

"Our hopes and dreams alone would take years to speak of," says Gallius. "What I have come for, I have done, though there might be one other thing I could offer, though I am not certain it is entirely appropriate. It was meant for Lady Luna, though perhaps others here might wish to hear my words."

Luna raises her hand, a gesture of invitation, while the Unconquered Sun raises a thin-stemmed pipe to his mouth and lights it. The other guests likewise relax, awaiting whatever is to come in their respective manners.

Gallius rises to stand before the greatest of Gods. Her voice is somehow more clear at this moment than it has ever been before. She explains nothing, saying first, "Of the Rising of the Sun at Harvest."

There is a time of year

when the wheat rises up to the breasts

and it covers me as I run naked

through the fields.

The wine sends heat through my body

and warms the wind with my laughter.

Of course he is chasing me!

My laughter is like leaves of corn,

waving in the field as I dart from his

sight.

In a few weeks the fields will be

misty like dreams.

Misty like my memories of the day

he caught me with that light in his eyes.

So bright.

Bright eyes like the sun, but more

than even I, he loves Luna.

Gallius speaks with careful words throughout her poem, smiling warmly. Only with the last word offered does her voice return to normal, though there are still hints of that warm clarity in it, like drops of honey. "I think now, beautiful Luna, that I understand why Ma-Ha-Suchi loved you most of all."

Luna bows her head in mute appreciation, while the others nod as well, showing their respect for the most primal of magics - an expression of emotion.

_It seems as though Lady Gallius has come to my rescue in this time when I knew not what to say._ Ramar smiles softly, listening to Gallius as she recites her poem. Each verse lends images and emotions to itself, and Ramar watches in awe as the eight themselves show respect for this expression.

Gallius smiles at Luna, bowing to her deeply. She turns to Venus, then, and says, "Thank you for your gifts, Maiden of Serenity. Now I need but understand why I love one who has tried to kill me twice. But perhaps soon that answer shall come." She smiles calmly, turning back to Helios, "You have aided us again and honored us in ways that I would have thought above us, and yet I now understand. What you give us you do because you feel we are worthy. You have given us the way and the truth. I suppose the only question left to ask would be if we can be of assistance to you outside of that which we already know. Greyfalls will be bathed in the light again. The Realm will be roused from its slumber and forced to face the truth our coming makes clear. I can't help suspect, though, that there are still other things, perhaps not so lofty, but still important to you."

"They will be revealed, in time," says the Unconquered Sun, lifting his pipe from his lips to speak. "Much still depends on your own actions, as well, and on the actions of my children as a whole. Of this matter I will only say - the stone that has been cast will send waves throughout the East. Your battles began there and will end there. But your allies and powers must come from all five of the Poles."

Gallius nods to Helios and falls silent, answered for now. Already she has designs in her mind of what must be done when Greyfalls is free of the Realm.

Chi-Yosh finds Helios's message dire. Their ends shall be met in the East. A question bubbles up which has been nagging him. "My Lord, I recently found out who the true founder of my people is. She was one of the First Age's Solars, named Lesell. Could you tell me who bares her spark now, that I might meet and learn of her memories, and know the one who carries the Essence of someone I owe respect?"

The warrior-god rises from his divan, approaching the entrance to the pavilion. He makes a sharp, loud whistle, then points outward, and makes a quick, jerking beckoning gesture. A few minutes pass, as he waits, then confers quietly with a messenger, before returning to his seat. "I've arranged an audience with Lytek. He will answer your questions," he says at last.

Chi-Yosh bows to the Unconquered Sun. "Thank you." Of all the Solars present, there would be no searching. Or there may still be, depending on what Lytek says. But at least he is closer to knowing.

"Before I leave to do what must be done, I have one request," says Gallius. "It is perhaps much to ask, and it may seem a small matter amongst all that is happening, but to those who will listen to me it will prove invaluable." She gathers herself as she says, "I wish to be given a symbol to show the men and women of Greyfalls, something that will let them truly feel the connection with the Gods. Mortals long for physical connections, this much I know."

Jupiter frowns for a moment, then rises from her divan. She draws forth a piece of parchment, then pricks herself carefully and begins finger-tracing a message onto it. Once done, it is offered to Gallius, un-rolled and readable. "Give this to the man who brought you here," she smiles. "He will instruct you in the particulars of that which you seek."

Gallius accepts the parchment and bows deeply to Jupiter, for once finding nothing at all to say to express her feelings. This time, silence is better.

"I have one more question. Luna, Venus, the Maiden of Serenity," Chi-Yosh hesitates but for a moment. "What are your favorite flowers?" There is a knowing expression on his face, but the tone is meant to lighten the mood after the business of the sesson.

Venus taps her chin thoughtfully. "The lilac," she says. There are a few repressed snickers or laughs from her sisters, and even the stern Saturn lets herself smile softly. Luna leans forward. "A gift from her first love," she explains calmly, as Venus blushes a heavenly magenta.

_There are a million and one things I could ask, I should ask, but I cannot bring myself to think of any that must be asked, or ay that are more than trivial enough to be brought before the divine ones. And for that, perhaps I am a coward. At least Marina shall not have to tell me to stay quiet._ Ramar stands respectfully before them, glancing towards Gallius and Chi-Yosh as they speak in turn. Several times he draws in a breath as though he might speak, yet he does not, instead choosing to listen and learn the wisdom of the eight.

Gallius turns to Ramar, studying him for a moment. "You have been quiet, friend. Something must weigh on you. Speak, those gathered here will listen. Surely you wish to know something. Your mind is ever wandering, though your feet be still."

Chi-Yosh hides a chuckle. Gallius requests Ramar to speak, and before the very Gods? Tossing oil on a candle.

A soft laugh, a rather nervous one, as Ramar replies, "In truth at this moment I can think of nothing worth asking, nor anything that I might find out myself in due time, and that is why I am silent, as I do not believe I have anything worthwhile to say that has not been said, nor heard before by those present here," he explains, cheeks tinting slightly. "And even this explanation must have been known. So instead, I shall ask, how is it that one learns that which is worth asking?"

"We chase after our dreams," murmurs Venus. Her sister Jupiter nods, chiming in. "We seek most after that which we do not have." Mercury continues the thread. "We journey the road we have not taken." Mars nods, joining in as well. "We fight most passionately for what we believe in." Saturn concludes. "In the end, what is worth asking is what you wish most to know about. A diplomat may find swordplay useful, but it is not his passion. He will never be the swordsman in his heart. You know that which you love most. Seek after it."

The three Solars bow, and turn to leave. "Wait," murmurs Jupiter. "I have one more thing." She rises, walking toward Ramar. From her robe she withdraws a mask, but one with no eye-holes or mouth. It is blank, faceless and impassive - a true mask. The texture is fine, as though woven from fine spider-silk. "You may find this useful," she smiles. And with that, the trio depart.

---

Chi-Yosh's hands move through the flames of small candles. Each is a certain color, its' flame pleasant, bright, dim or engulfing. And as his digits pass within the hues of their flame, the emotion keyed to each candle runs up his arm. The Red Rage boils his blood and distracts him only until palm settles onto the indigo of Bliss. From Confusion to Sadness, and the spectrum are all displayed and all sampled, some with more degrees then others. But finally he tears himself away, feeling a touch emotionally drained - or perhaps that mental fuel has been burned up - but not enough so to give up his exploration.

The display of candles is not far from his intended target: a water garden. Yet rather then seeing the garden from above, with its' rich lillies and flowered plants, the water is allowed in levels along paths. Some at the feet, and others at shoulder level that one might peer through the floating water, and others higher to offer the view from below. Here he has been directed by a few questions directed at helpful spirits and the Master himself, as to the whereabouts of a powerful spirit accepting great aid for reward.

On the other side of a wall of water is a coral bench, where two figures can be spotted through a wall of water. As Chi-Yosh approaches, he hears, "A pleasure to speak to you, Azel. I will keep in touch." The departing creature he does not get a good look at, for it disappears behind a column with a school of fish and underwater flora, but the name he did catch. Coming around the corner, he calls "Azel, Mistress of the Sea?"

"KEEPER of the ANTIQUITIES of the SEA, please," calls a somewhat harried voice. It's impossible to tell if it belongs to someone old or young, but it sounds at least somewhat female. "Who are you, and what do you want? It's Calibration, you know, and I'm very busy!"

Chi-Yosh steps fully into view to get a better look - and address the spirit respectably. "I'm sorry," A sheepish smile his armor. "Keeper of the Antiquities of the Sea. I come to ask about representing you, as you see fit. A champion, a retriever, what role you might have."

"Oh, I see they've been spreading rumors about me again," sighs Azel. She is definitely a she, with long green hair and blue skin, and though her eyes are old, the rest of her seems of indefinable age. Her robes are deep blue and dark. "Well you're very polite about it, at least." She steps forward. "Now, seriously, what are you here for?"

"A spirit refered to it as 'the gift of gifts'. Those of great power can give great rewards, but I seek to work not inwardly, but outwardly for that goal. I want to do good, and spread the word of the Chosen as I go. I was pointed in your direction." Chi-Yosh spreads his hands. "I wish to be closer to the Essence around me. Can you help me, and in turn I help you?"

"You're not joking, are you?" asks Azel, now serious and calm. Her voice has gained a measure of depth to it, though it is not merely the depth of a lower scale of sound - it is a resonant weight that carries with it implications of power, and something else. "You know who I am? And what I represent?"

Chi-Yosh has to steel himself. "I only know what I have been told. You oversee the traffic of the Seas, the respect that is owed to the oceans, as well as it's protection and all who dwell within. This includes pirates and the Fae of the West. Your hands stretch all over Creation." He lookks back expectantly, as though he knows something is missing.

"Yes, that is correct," muses Azel. "But if this is some extended joke at my expense, Solar.. remember that I can inflict curses as great as the boons for which you ask."

Chi-Yosh says, "You have the power to. But you are a busy God, and there are many infractions and insults that fall within your reach. Even the best at what they do have attendents to do tasks that would distract them from what would otherwise divide their attentions greatly."

"I see," says Azel softly. "So you do come in truth, not to mock or pity me, but for... an exchange of favors? Very well. Such a boon I can only grant once a year. Swear a solemn oath. Serve me and my office honorably and faithfully for that time, and I will give you the gift you seek."

"A year." That is a great amount of time. Much is happening within the next few months... Chi-Yosh nods. "I will have to discuss with my Circle, but if there is no great discrepency among them, I would give my oath at next year's Calibration."

"Next year..?" Azel hums to herself. "A year is a great amount of time to wait as well. But.. return to me when you wish to agree to this thing, and I will gladly receive you."

Chi-Yosh bows slightly. "Thank you, Azel, Keeper of the Antiquities of the Sea. I will give you word as soon as I have spoken to all of my Circle." He smiles soft. "And know that you were spoken of with respect."
