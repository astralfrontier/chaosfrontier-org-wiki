# Gods of Eden 2003-11-12

Calibration has wound on, and through it feasts, plays, and things more spectacular than can be imagined in the mortal realm have happened. The Circle has been at the heart of some of these, and on the sidelines for others. This particular night finds Ramar wandering the streets of Yu-Shan. His mind wandering far beyond the boundaries of the golden light, even if he does not. His silvery robe catches the golden light of one of the boundaries as he ponders things beyond it, with a shrug, Ramar turns to walk away, wandering back down towards the center of the area, though he is stopped before he gets too far. "Hello Wanderer," comes a beautiful, almost ethereal voice. A voice which is the sound of footfalls rushing through flowing streams and along roads.

Following behind, a vague smile plays across Marina's lips. So far, Ramar has been remarkably restrained in his words and actions. But now there's this spirit ...

Gallius follows Ramar, but is rather distracted. She is studying a book written in her own bold hand, surveying it carefully and occasionally furrowing her brow and looking off into nothing for inspiration.

"Er... hello," says Ramar, turning to face the direction the voice is coming from. Nothing is there, however. The subtle sound of a desert wind flowing from the Southern Coasts to the icy peaks of the Northernmost mountains is made manifest, "Ah, perhaps if I take a more recognizable form..." And it is then that a road, wound around the form of a lithe being clad in a shimmering hooded cloak appears. Ramar bows his head respectfully, "I am honored that you greet me then," says Ramar. And the Spirit chuckles softly, the sound of a waterfall its voice now. "And I you, Wanderer. I couldn't help but feel you calling out to me."

_I don't believe I was calling to anyone..._ is on Ramar's mind, and the question can be seen in the curious look playing in his eyes. A thousand whispers of secrets held by a thousand stones, "You look confused, Chosen of the Sun... do not be. I listen to the hearts of all travellers, you are no exception." Ramar composes himself, "Well yes, I suppose that explains it then. I am honored to meet you, you must travel over many roads, that ours should cross is fortuitous." The spirit replies, "Or planned. You have much to say, I am sure, yet you are with friends, and I do not wish all of your time, merely a moment or two of it." A nod from Ramar, "Very well, though I would gladly ask you as many questions as can be politely asked..."

"And I have no doubt that you will, in time. I would answer them all, or all that could be answered. But that would take ages upon ages." The spirit winds about Ramar slowly, almost as though it were circling it's prey. Ramar smiles, "Yes, though I would be glad to know the answers you have to share... you sound as though you have seen the whole of Creation..." The Spirit giggles, as though the Eastern wind met with the Western wind, and they flowed downwards to wash over the Blessed Isle. "I have." Ramar raises a curious eyebrow, and with a moment's thought, asks "I wonder, is there a place you have never been?"

The Spirit gives a slow smile, "Perhaps. But perhaps not... I do not know for certain. I have seen the tip of the Blessed isle and all around it, I have been into the East and the West and the North and the South, I have been in places that time has long forgotten... yet with each journey I discover the newness of the path walked, even if the lands are the same." Ramar listens curiously. "You do not know?" He strokes his chin thoughtfully, his brow furrowing slightly as he digests this. "I wonder then... you have seen the world, yet... perhaps there is a land you have not yet been to?" The Spirit gives Ramar a curious look, as the shapes of waves come into view over the spirit's body. "Perhaps there is. Yet if there is, I cannot find it, not on my own."

Gallius looks up from her book to offer a nod to the spirit, though she does not speak, either through politeness or because she is wandering far afield in her mind. Or perhaps both at the same time.

Marina stays even more silent than Gallius, standing just far enough back to be a silent observer, one who perhaps is paying no attention at all. Or perhaps, is paying a gerat deal of attention, trying to understand the currents in this watery conversation.

"Then what if I were to find such a place for you?" asks Ramar, his voice full of wonder and excitement at the thought of such an epic journey. "A land which neither you nor I have been to... yes, I think I would look for such a thing. Would you in turn share your wisdom with me?" The Spirit laughs, the joyous sound echoing through the streets. "I like you Wanderer. If you can find such a place for me... I will gift you with not only my wisdom, but a boon..." The Spirit's voice trails off, and it is almost sad as it relates, "A gift I give to few these days... but perhaps you shall change that Wanderer. If you can find such a place and return to me."

Turning to look at Gallius, Marina bites her lip. "This is ... a grande promise, indeed."

Ramar bows to the Spirit, "Then I look forward to finding such a place for you, and returning to share this new wonder with you, and those who come with me on my journey." The Spirit smiles, "A grand promise for a grand journey, yes... then I shall leave you to it Wanderer. And await your return." The Spirit is gone, the sounds of another journey capturing it's attention for the moment. Slowly it vanishes, footsteps fading into nothingness.

"Perhaps it is," answers Gallius softly, "But we must reach high if ever we are to lead others to the light and the truth." She looks to Ramar and then to the spirit, "This is our place. This is our destiny. Without purpose we would be like most mortals these days, simply maintaining their existance and failing to live in the process."

Marina nods. "True enough. Well, we shall see what Ramar finds. I suppose you and I can keep our ears open, in case we learn of places that might help him."

"Indeed, though I think this trip Ramar has decided to go upon is not so much a matter of location, as it is sensation," says Gallius. She smiles strangely, "It is perhaps the same trip all of us our going on. We simply have no yet recognized how far we've come."

"Either way," muses Ramar thoughtfully, watching the Spirit fade into the distance, "I look forward to the journey... and I would ask my friends to come with me to such a place... such wonders should be shared by all... but this can wait of course." Ramar smiles softly, and wonders, "Where shall we go from here?"

"Places, times, thoughts ... " Marina shrugs. "It will nonetheless take some searching. And while we search, we will meet new people, and strengthen our ties to the land ..."

"What will be will happen as it is meant to," says Gallius. "Perhaps while we have time left we should seek out our kindred. I believe that some of them may have things to say that we would like to hear." Gallius looks to the other members of her circle, "Unless there are other duties that we need to attend to?"

Davron's eyes flicker slightly. "Purpose..." he murmurs. The word seems to have stirred something in him. Finally, he chuckles softly. "To wander, and find what has not been found before, may be Ramar's purpose, but... well, although I will be honored to help you in your search, my friend," he says, bowing to Ramar, "I think that my own purpose lies elsewhere." He looks down at his hands, flexing them slightly as he turns them over and over. "No, I think my role in this world is not to find what has been hidden, but to _create_ what has never even existed before."

"We are a circle, Davron. We have our own drives and abilities. We were drawn together by the very guidance of destiny to become something greater than what we are alone." Gallius smiles, nodding, "And soon the power of the Sun shall be seen by all."

Ramar smiles at Davron, "And a grand purpose it is. I had thought that perhaps such a new place might need to be created, but then it might not... there is much to dwell on in this matter. When the time comes I will aid you in creating a new path for this world to walk upon. It is a noble goal, and perhaps as is said, the Sun shall be seen by all, and more revered." He pauses a moment though, "There is one thing," he says, turning to Davron with a very sheepish look on his face, "While we are here, I would ask if you might not use one of the names you had uttered before..."

Davron blinks. "What do you..." he begins, then his eyes widen, and he puts a hand to his lips. "I... didn't, did I?" he murmurs in consternation, blushing intensely.

"The time for hiding is soon to be over for us," says Gallius simply. "I tire of it. The light of the sun is not meant to be concealed in the shadows." She lets out a sigh, "But come, we should find our kin. There are many things to learn, and to teach."

Ramar nods, "It is something to be careful of. That we should all be careful of," he says, glancing at the rest of the circle, "Yet what will happen will happen and I am not worried, let us go find our kindred. And perhaps later I might show those interested a painting I found in the gallery here..."

Davron sighs, smiling ruefully. "Well, what's done is done, I suppose. Let us see... hm?" he says, raising his head and looking past a statue. "What was that?"

Ramar looks about, "What was what?" He turns towards the statue that Davron looks past, his senses easily slipping into the streams of Essence so prevalent around this City. He lets his sight be carried far, and his ears listen for that which is being silent...

Gallius follows Davron's gaze. "What did you see?" she asks calmly. She puts away that book of hers, peering towards the statue.

"A ball of light, over here..." he says, taking a few steps toward the statue. "It was behind this statue a moment ago. I'm not sure which way it went... there! What is that, anyway?" Davron sounds increasingly worried, as the glowing sphere is too far away to reach now.

"Now that I think about it, I see it as well. I cannot help but wonder what that was... alas it is gone." Ramar smiles softly, hiding a small bit of worry, "Shall we be on our way then? We should find those we seek for and worry about this when we might deal with it. I do not know what it was, perhaps we may find one who would."

Gallius raises an eyebrow. "This is a strange place," she murmurs. "And it is most certainly not where we belong." She pays it no more mind at all and goes on.

"I'm sure we will find out sooner or later," Davron mutters, shaking his head, and looks up at Ramar again. "And if something comes to find you, I promise you I will stand with you when it does."

Ramar smiles, "I am not worried my friend, nor are you the only one whose tongue has slipped. It is fortunate that it has been caught now, and perhaps good will come of it in the end." Ramar has a faraway look in his eyes for a moment, "These things have a funny way of sorting themselves out you know. It is merely up to us to determine how. Onward then?"

"What is it that has us standing in the middle of the road?" Chi-Yosh's head can be found situated above Gallius and Marina's shoulders. Nary a notice of him approach, and the ease in his posture suggests he did not just stop walking.

Gallius continues, focused on meeting her kin far more than worrying about lights and portents here. She has what she needs from this place, it is time to make arrangements for the real world.

Ramar smiles at Chi-Yosh, "Our own indecision it would seem, but now that we are gathered, let us go from here to find our kin." Ramar gestures after Gallius, and he follows after her, robe fluttering gently in the Celestial breeze.

Davron nods. "Perhaps I can find Rumika there," he says. "She might know more about what manner of thing that glowing sphere was." He grins ruefully. "Perhaps? If it's a gathering of Solars, the difficulty would be in _not_ finding her."

---

One of the ancient traditions of Calibration, thoroughly ingrained into the fabric of the mortal world, is the Reversal of Fortunes. It is even practiced here, in the city of the gods, with amusing results. The five Solars make their way toward the carnival grounds again, and find a unique sight - a young boy sitting on Helios' golden throne, while the warrior-god himself kneels in mock deference, listening to his commands. Similarly, many of those wearing Solar robes and golden crowns can be found serving drinks to the appreciative (or bemused) spirits who cluster around them.

Rumika, not one to miss a chance to act strangely is dancing her finest for one of the dragon-blooded. Her motions are meant to tease, and it's definitely having the desired effect, no matter how aloof the man attempts to be.

Chi-Yosh watches the procession with a wry smile, and moves off into the crowd. He finds a Solar who is passing out the trays of drinks and small food items. One he collects with a smile, and begins moving among the gathered. "Hello," He greets a man in armor of lush White jade, collecting a glass to draw it forward. "Would you care for some of..." There's a brief moment as it dawns that he does not know what is in the glass. "This?"

Gallius looks upon this strange sight with an arched brow. "Curious," is all she says. "I have a feeling this may hamper our progress somewhat, but we are meant to serve before we can lead." She offers no other suggestions, moving forward to a fountain. She takes a vessel from it and dips it into the fountain, gathering the water. She looks around for a moment, and then makes her way to the young boy on the throne. Her voice is soft as she speaks to him, "Great Lord, no doubt a long path is behind you, and your feet should be washed."

Davron takes in the scene with a growing grin. "Now _this_ looks like fun," he says, leaning back and putting a hand on his hip as he turns to his companions. "I wonder who'll come to give us our orders..." he begins. Across the room, his eyes spot the dancer, and he chuckles quietly to himself. "Obviously _some_ people have their way of establishing themselves under even the most adverse conditions..." he mutters under his breath.

After a moment or two taking in the scene, Marina looks at Davron, and grins. "I don't think we take orders; I think we merely serve, as we observe ... find those who need our aid, and aid them?" She steps forward into the crowd, seeking out the dancer, to lend her voice as music to the dance.

_Hah! The Reversal of Fortunes... how long has it been since I last...._ A joyous smile is on Ramar's face as he surveys the crowd around him. Not one to disregard this sort of thing, Ramar laughs and finds himself simply observing his circlemates, until he too reverses his fortune. He steps towards a fellow garbed in robes similar to those of the Masters, with an unadorned head. When Ramar speaks, it is in a teasing tone, with enough lighthearted humor to dismiss any curelty that might be perceived "Hello there, you look as though you need counsel and guidance, someone to help chart your destiny. I would be willing to do so, my liege. You have but to listen."

Rumika will accept music as it is offered, and the whole will do her best to set crimson the cheeks of the dragon blood who watches her. She seemingly needs no charms beyond that which she bears to reverse fortunes in more ways than one as dragon blood starts to wrestle with the impulse of hating anathema.

Gallius smiles as the young boy and kneels before the throne, taking his feet and carefully washing them. Lacking a sponge the lady uses her hair instead. "My Lord is having a most wonderful Carnival," she compliments.

Davron squares up his shoulders and takes up a serving tray. Cautioned by Chi-Yosh's example, he proffers the hors d'oeuvres without providing any commentary beyond the dishes he can identify - which, given his somewhat plebeian upbringing, aren't many, so he mostly remains silent. All the while, he lets his movements drift him through the crowd in Rumika's direction. As her dancing turns her toward him briefly, he catches her eye with a smile.

Rumika raises an eyebrow at Davron and suggests, "Ahh, you have come to help aid my great lord?" she suggests. She means, of course, the dragon blood who gapes at her. She winks at Davron, "Unless you of course need something?"

The robed man Ramar had spoken to turns and regards the Solar with a hearty laugh. He pats him on the shoulders, "Nonsense! I would not accept advice from one such as you, I am but a humble servant" Ramar picks up a tray and serves a drink to the fellow, "But I appreciate the gesture, it brings some of the weariness from my mind away, thank you, and go, share your counsel with these others. I have my floors to clean and I must see that my lady," The fellow gestures to a small girl, "Has her dolly garbed immediately." Ramar shares a laugh with the fellow, and departs, moving through the crowd. He bows his head humbly, listening to others rather than speaking, until he finds himself with a cluster of Solars. Unable to resist, he joins in the conversation, commenting on whom should be served and where. Laughter echoes during this interesting time.

The Jade-armored man takes up the glass, but does his very best not to even acknowledge Chi-Yosh's presence. This is accepted as the Solar moves through the crowd. Though, a glance at his robes, a chuckle finds him. As a Night passes him with an empty tray, the Warrior offers a swap - the empty for his drink laiden one. With this, he strides across the hall to another Dragon Blooded, her armor of lush Green jade. He does not know her name, but as he draws closer, "...and your movements with the Vermilion Legion is quite impressive, given what they were." The Solar takes up a post right beside the Wood aspect, his platter held like a shield, and face grown solemn. The woman casts a sideglance at him, her face dower, but a smile from Chi-Yosh allows the corner of her lip to tug upwards.

Gallius finishes washing the feet of the young boy and steps away, bowing deeply. Turning away, she looks about slowly, seeking one she saw earlier. The robes of a dawn caste who moves like a leopard. Yes, that is the one she needs to speak to. She will follow him and see if he might be drawn away from the merriment.

And so Ramar and two more Solars find suitable props. To one of the towering Warrior spirits, they bring something made to seem a tome of great lore and ancient secrets, to a scholarly sage, a mock-sword is brought. And Ramar finds his conversation joining those of the other Solars he has been aiding. They agree, that perhaps they have much to teach one another. Yet there will be time for this later, when Calibration is over. "Indeed... and we can settle upon a place after Fortune has Reversed itself once more."

Davron bows respectfully to the Chosen of the Dragons with a smile, and proffers the tray. "A delicacy, milord, whilst you partake of the entertainment?" he says. "I _do_ have a question," he adds, addressing Rumika, "but I should not impose my minor troubles on his lordship."

Rumika nods, "I think my lord needs a break to eat, and to regain somewhat of his faculties?" She ceases her dance, striding away and indicating with a nod that he should follow.

Davron nods. "As you wish," he says, pausing long enough for the Dragon-blooded to accept a food item if he is willing, then turning to follow Rumika once more. "I saw a thing today, and I'm wondering if you can lend some insight on it..." he begins.

As the festivities wind on, Ramar is set upon by another of the unadorned robes, this time a woman, asking for his counsel. He gives it as he might, bowing respectfully and displaying homage to his ruler for the time being. He talks of selections of drinks and of delicacies to sample first, advising as to why they should be consumed and in what order. Then, Ramar the Counselor is brought near Guardsman Chi-Yosh, just as he says, "And so that is why you might be fated to try the bananas first," and it is then he is unable to suppress laughter, and wonders how ridiculous he must look to his friend.

Gallius manages to draw the Dawn away, though not without comment. "A zenith with wet hair washing the feet of others," the man says, crossing his arms. Gallius answers, "Pride destroyed us once, I would have you perhaps teach me yet another discipline." Whatever else they mean to speak of is not overheard here, for they move away from the crowds to speak.

Rumika nods to Davron, waiting for the part where she can help. She gives Davron a curious smile, "I hope you haven't landed yourself in too much trouble."

Davron chuckles nervously. "As do I," he remarks, rubbing the back of his neck. "What I saw was a sphere made of light, about the size of my fist. It was hovering behind a statue when I spotted it, then departed at great speed."

"Ahh, that's nothing to worry about," says Rumika. "It's just another spirit of Yu-Shan," she explains. "At worst it overheard a few things, but it is no danger." She smiles, turning her comments to the embarassing again, "So, did you like seeing me dance?"

Chi-Yosh can only watch Ramar with amusement. The Eclispe has Sidereals in the good jest. He shifts positions, crossing his arms with the tray held in both hands across his front. His protectorate turns to him after a moment, as her conversationalist has departed. "You guard with your life, soldier?" "With life, limb, and heart." There is a drawing of his posture, at attention. "You carry out the orders blindly?" "I can see, but those eyes are sharp. If I see my orders unjust, I stand tall. If I see my orders as right, I look from the hight of loft loyalty to my leader." A nod from the woman. "If you stand tall, do you defy the next ruler?" "If the next in line is as bad as the first, I rally my fellows against him, and hope that far better comes about." "At ease. You may call me the Roseblack."

Gallius continues to speak softly with the Dawn Caste away from the party. She draws out that book of hers, offering it to him. He raises his eyebrows, and then considers the text carefully. Whatever it is, it sparks a lot of conversation. After a moment, the Dawn looks out towards the gathering and waves a hand impatiently at a younger girl, whom by the looks of her robe appears to be a zenith. She moves away from the gather to join them and the three speak together in hushed tones.

Davron's cheeks color brightly. "I..." he begins, his mouth opening and closing a few times. The tray he's carrying wobbles precariously. "Y-you dance very well, Rumika. As, as if you were born to it."

And as the advisor and the guard regard one another, Ramar watches Chi-Yosh curiously, watching him speak with deference to the Dragon-Blooded among their number. A respectful genuflect to the Dragon-Bloods, before he is lead away. A smile is given to the Soldier, and so the crowd continues, groups solidifying and fracturing, their members moving about through the crowd joyously. Ramar leaves Chi-Yosh to his own fate, and as he walks through the crowd, his companion finds her fortune reversed once more. She leaves Ramar, returning to her own companions. Ramar wanders through the crowd, aimlessly almost until he finds himself regarding a small Spirit who is leading two Solars in a game of Follow the Leader. Ramar joins in, striking up conversation with those who share his predicament.

Rumika laughs softly at her student, "Careful now, young one. I'm old enough to well.. hmm." She grins widely, "Let's just say old enough to be your wiser sister. Perhaps we should move away from this mess. You have yet to introduce me to your friends. I'm guessing you do have a Circle?" As for the use of her name, she doesn't show any concern at all.

Davron blinks, and chuckles. "I do indeed. Thank goodness for that, I'm sure I'd have got myself into trouble sooner or later, on my own. I wonder what _they_ will make of you?" He looks out over the crowd. "Let's see... some of them shouldn't be too hard to find..."

"It matters little what they make of me," answers Rumika. "I have no circle, and I see myself as always standing on the outside. That is my calling and my way." She smiles and adds, "The Carnival ends soon. I must find you, but I have a feeling I will do this easily. You need not say where. I will know. I have seen it."

Gallius nods to the two solars she speaks to, letting them return to the festivities. She waits patiently, her mind no longer focused on this place. She now is eager to be on her way. Time is passing and she cannot stand anymore idleness.

Davron raises both eyebrows. "You've seen it? Are you Chosen of the Sun or the Maidens?" He shakes his head, smiling. "Never mind. Somehow, I believe you can find whatever you want to find. And when you do, I shall want to know why your errand is so urgent. But for now... this is a party, as everyone so often reminds me."

As if on cue, Ramar hops past, as led along by the diminutive spirit. He stops a moment, as the Spirit does, and to Davron it speaks, "Hello there. You should join in, some of these games are quite fun." Ramar smiles softly as he notices Gallius standing alone among the crowd. After time passes, and fun is had by all, Ramar will lead Davron and Rumika her way, having told the Spirit to find her. They pause for but a moment to relieve Chi-Yosh of Guard Duty. Marina is found moments after Gallius is, and when the game ends, they speak at length of the things they have seen and done, as they head back towards their respective rooms, towards their own groups and those they knew before they came to Yu-Shan.
