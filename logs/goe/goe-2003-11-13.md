The office of Lytek, Divine Administrator of the Exaltation, is an expansive, almost palatial, area of a tall tower in Yu-Shan, off of the Carnival grounds. Chi-Yosh has been escorted outside the lines of golden light by two spirits who identified themselves as his emissaries, and who commanded him to wear a blank black mask while they guided him. Now the mask is off, and the Solar can examine the chamber he's arrived in. Noticeable above all are two things - that one side of the great room is open to the starry night of Yu-Shan's sky, and that almost a thousand cages, as for a bird, can be found hanging here, from ceilings, hooks on walls, or brass stands affixed to the floor. Many of the cages are occupied, but none of them have doors. The varicolored birds that nest in them seem free to fly in or out whenever they are so inclined.

Chi-Yosh had not refused the blank mask. His God had sent him here, and in that there could be no mistrust. Now free to let his eyes roam, they drift out into the night of the City of the Gods and to the marvel of the carnival beyond, lights of the various paths and that of other buildings offering a skyline like a dark tapestry. Then, as the birds whistle and chirp, his attention shifts. The cages are peered at, though never does he put a hand in; no telling which species is more aggressive or defensive, if which beaks are made for tearing and pecking. But the plumages of this one, the song of that one... each can draw the eye some way. The man has been left here to wait, so he can at least occupy himself.

"Beautiful, aren't they," murmurs a voice. A man stands in the doorway, wearing the robes of an official of Yu-Shan. His arms are folded behind his back as he steps forward, peering at his visitor. "Each of them exquisite."

Chi-Yosh appraises the man he can only guess is Lytek, but so is done with a smile. "Yet you let them roam free at their leisure. One thing I have learned is that many will take an animal and keep it shut up, rather then let it come and go. So expensive, yet not neglected." A smile. "You are kind."

"I cannot keep what is not mine," he replies, with a smile. Stepping further into the room, he unfolds his arms, gesturing at a chair that sits before a desk in one corner. "Come and sit," he invites, taking his place behind the desk. "What can I do for you?"

Chi-Yosh regards the man across from him with more respect by the moment. "I seek the Solar who bares the spark of a Solar long departed. Her name in the First Age was Lesell." There is a pause. "I wish to know her through this Solar's memories." There is a touch of hesitation, almost guilt.

The man frowns for a few moments. He turns, rising from the desk, and presses a hand to the wall, whose almost-invisible seams become clear as it swings open. Behind is a long series of filing cabinets, and he begins to thumb through the files slowly. "Hmm. Hmm. L... L.... L... Le... Le...." He turns and pauses. "Are you sure?"

Chi-Yosh frowns in turn. "I... can only say what I know. She is entombed in the East, she was wed to a jaguar Lunar who caused her demise. Try looking for Su'Katan?"

"Who'Katan?" asks Lytek, frowning. He finally withdraws a pair of files, and sits down at the desk again. "Alright then.. let's look. What would you like to know?"

Chi-Yosh licks his lips. All right. He must be very careful here. Asking the name of another Solar can be very futile, at least in Yu Shan; the warrior does not wish to spread the name. But... "I wish to know who carries her spark now."

"Oooh then." Lytek glances through his two files, examining the paperwork carefully. He then glances up at the room, seeking a bird-cage, then another, with his eyes. "Nobody," is his succinct answer.

Brows knit, as Chi-Yosh follows Lytek's eyes for a moment to the birds before they return to the man. "What do you mean? I thought that when a Solar dies, their spark is taken to the next in line?"

"Yes, but not immediately, young man," chides the official, smiling. "A spark finds a compatible host. Such a host doesn't just come along every day."

Chi-Yosh considers this, looking back at the cages over the rows of birds. "How do you know which is which?"

"It is my job to know," reproves Lytek gently. "I know because I must know. Now... is there anything else?"

Chi-Yosh turns back with a sheepish smile. "What can you tell me about Lesell?"

"Well, hmm," muses Lytek softly. He opens his folders, laying them out and leafing through the paperwork. "Oh dear...." He rearranges the paperwork again, peering at sheet after sheet. "Well, it was the third Exaltation of that particular spark, and ..... how interesting. It was reincarnated seven more times, but all within a thirty-year span."

The spark had not lasted very long in any body. Chi-Yosh must think of something that would be listed. "What caste? And what was the spark's goals? What were they like?"

"Well, now... Goals? I can't really say, you understand, without authorization. But the Exalted shard was of the Zenith Caste." Lytek hmms again. "She's also still got quite a destiny associated with her."

Chi-Yosh can't help but lean forward a little. "Oh? Or is that withheld without authorization too?"

"Well, it's just not my department," muses the celestial official. "I simply have a note here, indicating to pay special attention to this spark when it comes in. But here..." He scribbles a brief note with a feathered quill, blows briefly on it, then hands Chi-Yosh the scrap of paper. "When the Heavenly Bureaucracy of Destiny re-opens, take this to them."

Chi-Yosh takes the paper, folding it up and putting it inside a pocket of the robe. "Thank you." There is not much else he can think to ask but... "It's against the rules to send a notice to someone when the spark reincarnates? And a general way of finding the owner?" He can be hopeful.

"Oh my, no, it's not against the rules," smiles Lytek. "But of course... you must be authorized."

"Of course." Chi-yosh smiles back almost dissapointedly. "And that's a harsh task to accomplish, I can imagine, being autherized."

Lytek smiles. "We do have rules here, young man. Otherwise, think of the chaos that would result!"

Chi-Yosh grins, looking out over the night sky. "I _couldn't_ imagine what ever you mean."
