# Gods of Eden 2003-11-16

Having gathered the forces of Roleyn outside of her main base, Gallius decides it is time to go and see about sparing the lives of innocents. And thus opening any kind of warfare she might wish to wage later. In this pursuit, she gathers 20 of her most trusted riders, all skilled at getting away and doing so very quickly. Among this count is Gari and Lady Yuri, who will serve as the voice of reason, should it be required. Gallius of course does not go! General Creol, leader of the Roleyn forces, does, however. The resemblance is striking, but the tell-tale signs of her station are left behind. Jin-nu of course cannot come on such a trip. "Let's get this over with," mutters Gari softly. "Like as not we'll take a spear for trying it." Lady Yuri considers the man silently, then looks to Creol, nodding. "What shall be, shall be," says the general.

The party marches towards the city of Greyfalls. They were told about the defenses, but they move under flag of truce and though they bear weapons, they are not drawn. "This is a strange trip," Malis says quietly. "But the cause is just. The outcome for those who stand by is likely to be a sad one if they are not kept away from the furnace of battle." Creol just stares ahead as she rides, wondering just what she is going to come into contact with. Wondering if her faith is going to cost her more than her life.

The brooding stone walls of Greyfalls rise overhead as the company approaches them, and a series of tense hails, challenges, counter-challenges and threats ensue, as the armed warriors and the sturdy guardsmen in their towers and on their walls regard each other with fear, suspicion, and muted hostility. At last the company is given access, and the ponderous metal gates swing wide.

Creol nods to those who give challenge. "Remember, we come here on a mission that does not involve using weapons," she says evenly. She studies carefully the men she sees, trying to judge their feelings not just of her presence, which seems obvious wariness, but of what is to come.

The company continues inward, joined up by an escort of guardsmen, all armed with pikes and marching lockstep with their 'guests'. Through the winding streets they march, toward the inner gates. These are drawn open, and under the points of two dozen drawn bows, the soldiers of the western Threshold enter the inner bailey of the fortified city.

This is not the first time these riders of Roleyn have had weapons pointed at them. Drawing on the will of Croel they hold themselves still, remaining relaxed and apparently untroubled by the greeting, for they expected nothing else. The General simply nods to those soldiers who greet her with weapons drawn. Occasionally she will catch the eyes of one of them and in the space of a few seconds measure his will and strength. Some can only meet her glance for moments, while others, the more seasoned, stare back evenly.

The inner doors of the fortified tower at the center of the city swing inward to admit the party, and as they pass through, Gallius notes a feature of the doors - two stone columns, bound with powerful chains to gear-work in the shadowy depths of the upper wall, designed to crash down and block the doors in a final defensive gesture. The warrior company is received cordially enough by the major-domo of the citadel, but even she reflects the nervous tension that is prevalent throughout the city.

Creol bows her head to the woman who comes to greet her. "I fear our arrival has caused somewhat of a stir. I had hoped with such a small number there would be no concerns. If I have erred, I apologize. I come on a matter that my King deems urgent enough to justify this appearance, and would speak with whomever is willing to receive me." The strange final defense is noted. Gallius can only pray it does not go so far.

"There are never no concerns in Greyfalls," smiles the major-domo, thinly. "However, you are welcome here. Your men will be ... seen to. Follow me, please." The woman turns, her robes waving outward for a moment as she spins on her foot with military precision, and begins marching toward a grand set of stairs at the northern end of the hall.

Creol slips from the back of her horse, patting the animal's flank gently. Moving with her is Lady Yuri, the others will all hang back. They have their own tasks to see to. Most of them are to ascertain the morale of the troops and what the general feeling is in regard to the CoR forces. Not among Realm folk, of course, but among the real people of Greyfalls. Gari and Malis have permission to explain their presence to whomever they speak to, as well. If all else fails, the rumor mill should spill out the news fairly quickly.

The stairs twist and turn, and Gallius' alert eyes note the preponderance of defensive apparatus built into walls and other things. Hairline cracks and painted rice-paper, for example, cunningly colored to match the walls, conceal invisible traps designed to block the path of intruders or to slay the unwary. The major-domo leads the way through three more large chambers, ascending, ever ascending. At last the trio emerge into a sumptuously-appointed room, a study or conservatory of some kind, wherein are three people. Two are male, one dressed in crimson jade armor, the other wearing sea-blue robes. Each is the spitting image of each other - dark haired twins with gray eyes. The third is female, blonde, unattractive in the eyes of a young lad seeking a comely lass, but with a compelling presence to her. She is seated, but rises when the major-domo announces the guests of Greyfalls. "Speak," invites the blonde woman, her voice cordial and controlled.

"My name is General Creol of Roleyn, and I was sent here to address the concerns of my king," replies Gallius evenly. "This is my aide, Lady Yuri, who will be here to address questions you might have that are outside the scope of my knowledge." She wastes little time getting to the point, "On our way to this place my forces passed a large army that is to be arrayed against you. I have no doubts you are already aware of the Coalition of Rivers and their intentions regarding this place." A short pause for some sign, and then she goes on, "My King is the son of many warriors, and though his heart is strong and cold in the face of battle, he is not unmerciful. He wishes to change my purposes in regards to the battle to come. Our force is not a large one, and so he would rather we divert our men and offer a sanctuary to the commoners. Our reasons are clear and the advantages numerous."

Creol goes on, "This allows my people to avoid death in a distant land. Our forces have been seriously damaged by barbarians raids and we cannot afford to lose our best knights in a battle that will gain us little. In addition to this, we hope to gain some measure of respect from the people of Greyfalls. We have no interest in the wholesale slaughter of innocents. Death in battle is the way of a warrior. It is not meant for farmers and servants. As for what you would gain from this offer, no doubt you are wise enough to see the benefits. Lady Yuri, if you would?"

Lady Yuri bows to those present, "There are three forces in Greyfalls worth noting. The Realm is the strongest, and they are of course the main reason this battle is taking place. The Nuri are loyal to the Realm and are the second force. Being a minority they will cling tightly to those who keep them powerful. The third faction is the largest, the true citizens of Greyfalls. At best they are hostages to you, at worst a force that might rebel and destroy your plans at a critical point in the battle. You cannot simply imprison them all, since it would force the issue and many would starve. They are important to the future of Greyfalls, no matter who might lead them. If you win, which is certainly possible, you will still need these people to support the city. If you lose, keeping them here may well be the cause."

The woman frowns; the major-domo has long since departed, leaving the half-dozen here in privacy. "I must take exception to the word 'hostages'," she says softly. "For almost seven hundred years, the Realm has had a presence in this city. And now, the Confederation of Rivers thinks to march upon us, unprovoked, unwarranted. I will send my own soldiers, my kin and comrades, to defend their homes. Think you that the Confederation will peaceably leave Greyfalls, should they achieve victory?"

"My goal is to give them no choice," replies Creol. "I stand outside the Confederation now. If they think to stand upon this city like vultures we will move against them. We are a small force, but we have friends now who would aid us in this. There are others watching what is about to happen with much interest."

"I think that, like the Maritan army, you pit yourself against a superior foe out of confidence and good intentions, however misguided." The woman smiles grimly, pacing, while the twins watch Gallius steadily. The eyes of the man in red jade are smoldering with hate, while those of the man in blue are less clear. Their depths cannot be read. The blonde woman speaks again. "Let us see what Tauri has to say about this, however." Then she barks, loudly, "Runa! Fetch Tauri here. Send also a message to the shrine, begging for Him to come here." The sound of the major-domo's footsteps can be heard, retreating down the stairs. "While we wait," the blonde suggests, "may I offer you both drinks?"

"For us it matters little, perhaps. We know the will of our King, and that provides us with all the courage and intelligence we need," answers Creol. "I would be honored to share a drink with you," she adds. Lady Yuri nods to this, as well. "It is not the way of Roleyn to refuse polite offers. You say this attack comes completely unexpected? The Coalition sent no message at all?" She clearly doesn't approve. At least an ultimatum should have been sent. "If they are harsh warriors they are unlikely to send word," says Creol, allowing a small smile. "We must admit we have yet to learn their intentions. We raced her to arrive ahead of them."

"We are hardly ignorant of the doings of the Confederation Council in Marita," responds the woman kindly. "We have diplomatic envoys stationed there. We were signatories of the Confederation constitution. To their credit, they did not have our diplomats slain out of hand."

"That would be a black crime," says Creol. "There is some hope yet that they might show some manner of restraint. What I do know is that they are deadly serious. Their force is enormous. Your hands shall be very full, it seems." Gallius asks of the woman, "What is your title? I would address you properly. Most of my education is in war, and Lady Yuri comes here, I admit, to smooth my tongue when I falter, but I think in this my question is proper."

"I am Cathak Alcis Katsura," the woman replies calmly. She gestures with a hand, and her two male associates move to retrieve crystal drinking-glasses and a decanter of wine. "I have no title - or perhaps more truthfully, I have too many. 'Alcis' alone suffices."

"Alcis, then," says Creol. "Titles are rather a burden, and they make less sense the more you have. Fortunately I have few to trouble myself with at the moment." She smiles and will accept the wine glass when it is brought over. "Do you come from the Imperial City? I must admit I am curious. I have heard a lot of stories about that place but have never been there."

"I am likewise," smiles Alcis. "I have been told the stories but have never visited. However... it does not matter. I may visit it someday. But I was born here in Greyfalls, and have lived here my whole life. It is my home, and I will not abandon it - or its people - easily."

"You are not what I expected," says Creol softly. "You have to understand, where I come from we only hear tales of the Realm as rumors, third hand or farther. We are instructed that the leaders of the Realm are haughty and callous, treating those who are not noble as stones to move on the board. If I am any judge, however, you do not see things that way. This really is your home. If Roleyn were in danger, I would die defending it to the end." She nods slowly, starting to understand. "Things are not as simple as rumors would have us believe."

"So it has been observed," murmurs Alcis. The twins serve guests first, then incline their heads as they present a third cup to the woman. They too partake. The simmering resentment on the face of the armored warrior is clear, but his brother seems as unfazed as ever. "Well then... to the people of Greyfalls. May they find the protector they require." And with that she raises her cup.

"To the people of Greyfalls," says Gallius, raising her glass. Lady Yuri follows suit, "May they survive the tides of war and grow stronger," she says. Gallius can only hope it is so. At least this captain she speaks with seems wise and just. Not at all what she feared. Far better than she could have hoped.

The major-domo's voice can be heard a minute later, as the two leaders and their respective aides drain their cups. "The City Greyfalls, and Tauri, Devoted Icon of the Will of the People," she announces, and two figures ascend the stairs. One is mortal - a tradesman by the look of him, squat and short, powerfully muscled, with intelligent eyes. The other is robed in colors of the stone walls without, and his long, waist-length beard is blue, the color of the waterfall that thunders down the cliff to the south of the city. His eyes are deep black. Alcis lowers herself to one knee before this being, as do her two companions.

Gallius and Lady Yuri follow suit, though they do not bow in the exact same manner. They kneel and put both hands to the floor, bowing their heads. And there they will stay until bidden to rise.

"I have not heard of an emissary," rumbles the god, striding forward. Alcis rises; her two companions do as well; Gallius and Yuri follow suit. Alcis nods toward Gallius - 'Explain yourself', reads the silent message of her eyes.

"I come on behalf of Roleyn's King," says Creol. "I am no emissary of the Coalition, for their goals and mine no longer are the same, it seems. I am ordered to protect the common people of Greyfalls while minimizing my own losses. My King's realm is pressed seriously by barbarian forces led by a monstrous being. We cannot afford to squander our knights here, and so I seek a more peaceful way to achieve my orders. I believe that if your people wished they could take up refuge behind our arms in a location away from the walls of Greyfalls. My main force has pitched its camp near one of your villages and pledged to protect those living there from foreign forces."

"Tauri," says Greyfalls, calmly. "What is the will of the people in this matter?" The tradesman coughs, delicately. Though his appearance is that of merely a hefty commoner, there's a glint of political sophistication in his gaze and body language as he considers. "Well, sir, there's the barbarian tribes.. they'd no doubt be a lot of trouble for us outside the walls. There's the problem of making shelters, but I think we could handle that."

"If I may interrupt," says Gallius. "I have reason to believe the common folk of Greyfalls need not fear the barbarian forces. At least not all of them. We have come into contacted with a force of apemen, and though they do stand on a war footing, their purpose is against the Realm, not against the commoners. They have not troubled us, and if my scouts report the truth, they are not far away. We are accustomed to fighting such creatures, so if they do test us, they will not find us unprepared."

"Well, now... " Greyfalls pauses, then beckons. "Alcis," he says. "Thou shalt give no offense to the men of Roleyn that give no offense to you. Creol, thou shalt give succor to those of my city as choose to leave its walls, as though they were your own kinsmen. Clasp thy hands and swear to it."

Creol bows her head and turns to Alcis, offering her hand. "The people of Roleyn shall defend those who wish to avoid this danger to the fullest of their strength. To the last man. Should the city fall and they fear for their safety, we shall stand beside them still. So I swear by the authority of the King."

"I will give no harm to any protector of my kinsmen and people," says Alcis, evenly, her handclasp firm and warm. Greyfalls nods, and the room slowly suffuses itself with Essence. The god himself becomes radiant, as his power operates. On the brow of Alcis radiates a sigil - a Caste Mark, that of the Aspect of Earth. And on the brow of Alcis' visitor, too, a Caste Mark begins to shine. Four pairs of eyes widen; Tauri and the three leaders show evident shock at this revelation, while Greyfalls himself seems unconcerned. The red-clad warrior draws his sword halfway out of his hilt in anger, but he is stayed by a sudden hand on his arm - his brother's hand.

Gallius notices the caste mark, and seeing the eyes of the others, knows what must have happened. "I wish, Lady Alcis, that we had met in times other than this. Perhaps still we might be friends. If you should fall in this battle I will remember you always for your kindness and fair treatment. I long for a future in which we can once again all be what we are truly meant to be. The past is a sad tale for which many have suffered. Those of my kind were perhaps justly punished, but the time has come to right things once more." She smiles warmly, still holding onto the hand of the other woman.

The handclasp ends; Alcis steps back, her face troubled. "You must leave now," she says quietly. "Tauri will speak with the other representatives, and make his decision; a messenger will be sent out to inform you."

"Of course," says Gallius. She turns away, followed by Lady Yuri. As she departs she says only, "What will be, will be."
