# Gods of Eden 2003-11-17a

Gallius, Lady Yuri, and Ramar prepare and head towards the river ere the sun rises. Gallius rides swiftly on the back of Jin-nu towards whatever might come. She leaves getting the attention of the spirit to Ramar. As for the deal she will propose.. well, she can only hope her own counsel has her prepared for this. Riding as an assistant in this is Lady Yuri, who hopefully will provide good advice as she has in the past.

The sound of hoofbeats across the ground is a precursor to the arrival of the three. They blend smoothly with the sound of the flowing river, drowning out the approach of the Three. The last few rays of starlight linger in the sky, their reflections dancing across the unbroken river's surface. Ramar nods to Gallius, hopping down from his mount. The wind picks up as his survey of the land begins, and he studies for a time, the flowing of the river. With a soft chant, Ramar stoops to pick up a stone from the ground. Ripples form along the river as the rock skips across it, bathed in starlight. "Spirit of the Mighty River, we who travel this land seek your counsel."

Time passes, silence-save for the steady beat of the river's flow-ensues. _Well that was unimpressive... is it any wonder no one has responded?_ Ramar closes his eyes, letting the sound of the water fill his mind. He listens to what it has to say, to its tales of where it has been, and where it will go, and of those within it. He can almost hear the tinny motes of Essence swirling about, pushed by the water, guiding it along it's course. Water sloshes swirling around him as he wades through it, feet planted firmly on the river floor. Ramar walks until he is waist-deep, holding his hands out as water flows through splayed fingers and around his body. He dives beneath, gathering up the smooth, polished stones that lie on the floor of the river bed, the silt disturbed leaving faint sigils as they flow away. He returns, laying the stones out on the river bank, embedding them in the soft soil, arranging them in a circle, with the path of the river drawn within it's center. Three lines intersect it, ind

Three lines intersect the river's path, indicating a rising of the river, or of something within it, and Ramar waits patiently; as patiently as the river must wait.

Still more time passes. Ramar stares at the circle he has made in the ground. He turns back to the river, a look of determination crossing his face. _Very well then, if you wish indeed to see why you should come and speak..._ Ramar shivers softly as the night air chills his damp body, his clothes fluttering damply in the breeze. The ground sinks softly beneath his feet as once again he wades along the river's edge. He grabs hold of stones to help weigh him down, and begins wading into the water, until his head has disappeared from view. A soft glow begins to come from within the depths of the water, not far from the edge. Within the shadowy depths of the water, amidst the clouds of silt his every step is disturbing, the burning brand of the Sun's Mark is on Ramar's brow, it's illumination casting aside the distortion of the rushing river, and letting the river know just who and what he is. He calls out to the spirit until he is almost breathless, then he releases the stones and swims for shore.

Time passes. From upstream, there finally comes the sound of rumbling water. A wave of unprecedented magnitude is sweeping down the Lesser Rock River, sending secondary waves splashing over the shore. It subsides a hundred yards or so from where Ramar stands, then the river seemingly explodes. A dragon, long and sinuous, blue as the depths of the river itself, enormous in size, bursts out of the waters and flings itself skyward, then executes a complex loop and dives again for the surface. A tremendous canyon of water is kicked up as it sweeps over the surface at great speed, stopping almost instantaneously only ten yards from where the Eclipse now stands.

Gallius watches the spirit closely, showing little sign. She reaches into her bag and draws out a blue mask, which she puts on slowly. Calmly she studies this impressive spirit, marvelling at its size.

Ramar remains standing where he is, though when the Dragon speeds to it's halt, he bows respectfully, giving it the reverence due any being of this magnitude. The light shining from his Caste Mark reflects dazzlingly off of the river's surface, and he greets the spirit, thankful to remain unharmed, though he is thoroughly impressed by the Dragon's display. "Honored greetings, Dragon of the Rock River."

**I am here, Chosen of the Sun. You have revealed yourself to me; I now reveal myself to you. State your wishes.** The voice is soft, with undercurrents of power and age, a flowing voice that sinks into the bones of those who hear it. The Dragon waits, patiently.

Gallius looks to Ramar and then back to the spirit. "We come for your aid, great spirit of the river," she says. "There is a battle coming, which you likely know of. What you might not have heard, however, is how your position is in danger. We have met other spirits of the water and as they have showed kindness to us, we would show kindness in return."

**Speak on,** reverberates the Dragon's voice.

"The forces that come against Greyfalls seek to blast your waters off course," says Gallius. "They wish to deny the people water to drink, and thus force them to submit. While I do wish for the defeat of the Realm, I do not wish for the city to be destroyed. I am unaware of what you might be able to do to aid us, but I fear that if you come into direct conflict with the Coalition you will be harmed. They are a very large force. Thus we come to offer and ask for your aid and your wisdom."

"We also come to inform you of the plans of those who would change your course, though you are likely aware of the actions of the Confederation of Rivers and those who would work to repair the damage to be done," adds Ramar. He nods to Gallius, then to the Dragon, "We have come to ask for your wisdom in finding a way to keep those who depend upon the river and who depend upon your bounty and your generosity... to keep them from suffering due to the actions of forces that they may know nothing of, or indeed care little about. If we may ask for those things."

**It is not my wish that my river flow aught but where it does,** the Dragon rumbles, at length. **I will oppose them, when they come.**

"It is not our wish, either, for the way things are you are provided for as are the people of Greyfalls," says Gallius. "But your resistance may not stop them. Can you withhold the waters of the river, if you wish it, great spirit? If so, then perhaps there is a way the Realm can be destroyed and you can avoid risking yourself as well. Though you be strong, I do not think you can stand alone against an army of dragon bloods."

**It can be done.** The Dragon hovers closer, extending a claw, drawing pictures in the water. **You are the Princes of the Earth. Yet you have not come demanding servitude. I am your ally in this.**

Ramar pauses thoughtfully, "We have the hopes of removing the teeth from these plans to oppose you, or to change your path... and gifting in turn power to those whose voice should be heard; the land and the people of the land. We welcome your Alliance, Master of Water, and offer our most humble thanks for your agreement in aiding us. With your aid, perhaps the land will be better for our passing." He smiles at the Dragon, bowing his head to the mighty being, "This day is a most welcome one," he muses, as the first rays of dawn begin creeping past the horizon's cusp.

Gallius bows to the spirit, "Once we were princes and mighty ones. Because of this, disaster followed. This time we are powerful only in our ability to aid others. Since you will aid us, great spirit, we will aid you. We shall go to the Coalition and tell them to leave you alone. If they dare to ignore what I tell them, those who follow me will die defending you against your enemies." She lets out a soft sigh, smiling under the mask, "It will be another wearying journey, I fear, but if it saves so many it is well worth it."

**Take this.** Bobbing to the surface of the river are seven stones, blue-green in color. **They are my token. Cast one into water, should you wish to call upon me.**

Reaching out, Ramar grabs hold of one of the stones, studying it carefully. He retrieves the others, and hands them to Gallius, "We shall have to keep these safe, until we need them." He bows once more to the Dragon, "Thank you for your kindness, and for your gifts and for your aid."

Gallius nods to Ramar, carefully putting the stones away. "You have honored us, great spirit. We will do all we can to prove ourselves worthy of your trust," she says, bowing deeply.
