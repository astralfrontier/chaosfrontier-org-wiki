# Gods of Eden 2003-11-19

The torrential flow of the Rock River is unimpeded by waterfalls, rapids or other hazards for much of its length. For the most part, its prodigious volume of irresistable water provides hazard enough for those who underestimate the might of the river. And the river runs fastest where it runs most narrow. The Orchid's Grave Valley, a deeply-carved channel upriver of Greyfalls by twenty miles, is well known to the villagers of Arzes. And on the dawn of the first day of Ascending Air, in Realm Year 769, the assault on Greyfalls begins.

Bestial soldiers and loyal villagers gather together under the direction of a handful of engineers, none of whom have ever accomplished a feat of this magnitude before. Nevertheless, they are familiar with the concepts water pressure from their readings on steam science, and all are knowledgeable in the patterns of wind, water and stone. Fumblingly, uncertainly, desperately, the small army labors for seven days, erecting an ever-heightening barrier wall around the river-cliffs of Orchid's Grave. The first four days are marked by heavy rains, and the winds are unusually chilly. There is a low grumbling marked among the beast-men, but they press on. On the eighth day of Ascending Air, stone and timber sufficiently reinforce the walls of the valley. A nearby community of shepherds is warned of the coming danger to them and their flock, and these hearty, un-warlike peasants have no wish to quarrel with the ape-soldiers who come to inform them that they must retreat to the uplands.

The dawn of the ninth day comes. The whole valley of Orchid's Grave is quiet, as Gallius sheds some of her blood across one of the token-stones, calling out to the great spirit of the Lesser Rock River. In due course the waters burst forth and the Dragon again emerges, its sinuous and scaly length shimmering with turquoise hues and iridescent in the sunlight. **You have called and I have come,** speaks the Dragon. **I am the Lesser Rock River. Speak your wish.**

Gallius bows deeply. "It is time, great spirit. All is ready. It is time to divert the waters and begin this battle in earnest." She looks over the work of her forces, smiling. She then looks back to the spirit. "It is time," she says once more.

The Dragon dives back into the waves, and there is a tremendous cacophony of sound as the waters of the entire river roil and writhe, struggling to flow freely in spite of their master's command. The water's fury reduces to a stream, then a small channel, then a tiny trickle of its former power, only a hundred feet wide and shallow enough that one might ford it. "NOW!" cry the captains of the engineers, and with as much organization as they can muster, the assigned beast-men knock out the supports of wood and stone, sending ton after ton of material into the dry gully. The river rages again, unchecked by steps as the Dragon releases its control, until finally the waters are completely freed. Stymied, impotent against the dam that man has wrought, the power of the River now expends itself against the wall in a futile gesture. The army has won; the Lesser Rock River is dammed.

Gallius admires the work of the people and the spirit. "This is what we can do together. Surely nothing can stop those who are willing to combine their strength." She turns away, then, saying to her friends, "They will come. We must be ready for them. I imagine just one ship, but they will be prepared for battle."

Marina nods at Gallius, shrugging a little in her clothes. The combat ahead leaves her feeling ill prepared; combat never was her strong suit. But after that ... after that her services will be required in the negotiations, she hopes.

Jin-nu, the golden horse of Gallius, stamps a foot. "They will come. There can be no doubt that they will be prepared to deal with a rebellious spirit," says the horse in her fine, clear voice. And if true, that can mean but one thing. The dragon-blooded shall come.

Chi-Yosh has watched the spectacle from atop one of the river cliffs of Orchid's Grave, a bright smile on his face. For the last eight days he has lent arms and back to the construction, and now the fruits of that labor stretches far. He had spoken to many of the villagers who agreed to quickly swipe up the waterless fish along the silty riverbed as the rivers have stemmed. Those they do not get will be the spoils for otters, bear and other predators along the mighty Rock. A simple nod to Gally. The easy work is done; now must come blood, pain and patience.

Davron taps his chin. "They may well be prepared for more than just a rebellious spirit. Let us hope that they are not prepared for _us_." His lips quirk into a smile.

"Get the volos ready," says Gallius evenly. "We'll need to hit them in an ambush. I suggest we focus on stopping the dragon blooded aboard first. The crew may be spared, if they surrender. Their exalted will not surrender, I imagine." Her face becomes a grim mask, "I wonder how long it will be before the river dries up at Greyfalls?"

Rabby, the Lunar girl, returns a few hours after the dam is set up, and while the engineers are scuttling about in the distance, she reports what she's seen. "Saulos Nebarr, the general, is three days away," she reports. "The Confederation army's about umm, sixty miles to the southwest." She points the way. "They brought wagons full of parts and supplies. It doesn't look like all of the army though. Maybe other units are coming from another direction, I don't know."

"They must be sending a force to camp out south of the city walls," says Gallius. "They are wise enough to keep the enemy honest, it seems. If they don't need to waste their powder here, perhaps they will find better uses," says the woman of Roleyn. "In either case, we have our tasks. Rabby, I think your master would be very angry if you were injured, so I must ask you to stay down here, out of harm's way, if you wouldn't mind." She knows better than to try and order the girl. So muley.

Drawing a crude map in the dust of the cliff, Chi-Yosh marks Orchid's Grave and Greyfalls. "Here is the riverbed. We can guess that the skyship will be coming straight from Greyfalls." Another point is marked. "Here is a high outcropping of dense trees. We should attack with the volos from here, after the ship has passed overhead, coming up beneath and then behind the ship itself."

Gallius nods to Chi-Yosh, "I'll try to keep the attention of the dragon bloods onboard. I think if Davron works with his bow we can make short work of anyone else resisting us. We'll have to just be ready. Who knows what we might face?" She smiles, sounding not nervous, but eager, "Our cause is just. Lord Helios has given us his mandate. We cannot waver now."

---

The skyship resembles nothing so much as an inverted pyramid, with gun emplacements and other strange devices fixed on the four corners. It flies silently, with a soft and radiant glow of Essence visible on its underside. It is one of the old machines - the original bearers of the sky-engine. Vessels like the _Seagull_, whose keels are those of river-boats, are equipped with scavenged engines. Not so here.

On board are six men. Four are soldiers, wearing the armor and livery of the Blessed Realm. They are armed with swords and pistols. The other two are men that Gallius has seen prior. Though twins in face and build, each is attired quite differently. One wears armor of red jade, resplendent in the sunlight, and bears a daiklave of similar color slung over his back. He bears himself proudly, as a warrior ought. His brother is more subdued, wearing a buff jacket of jade beneath cobalt blue robes, and armed openly with but a shortsword. His mien is calm, a contrast to his brother's haughty air, though there is no trace of humility in his own bearing. Both men are Dragon-Blooded, confident in their Exalted station; each flicker of eye movement or unconscious adjustment of position on a moving deck shout to the world their pride in their noble heritage.

The pyramid passes overhead, its' guns speaking not to the Solars' hiding place. As the shadow befalls the dense grove, leaves part beneath the upward rush of beaten, Essence-warmed wings of the alabaster automation. Up rises Eclipse and Dawn, a pair embraced tight within the soaring creation. Ramar pilots first, intending to allow the Su'Katan to drop first. Chi-Yosh is preparing, all ready his body easing into a stance even as wind whips across his form, a calmness coming over him only the coming challanges could test.

Davron emerges from the treetops in a shower of leaves soon after, the engine of his volo humming with Essence as he speeds toward the enemy airship. He holds Gallius firmly against the thrum and beat of the rushing air past both of them, and his teeth bare in a grimace as he swoops down upon the Chosen of the Dragons upon their own airborne platform.

As soon as the ship comes into view, Gally calls upon the essence, feeling her weapon already lighten in her hands. She recognizes the ones she will face. A pity, in a way. One at least seemed polite before. Now they both will almost certainly die. Once she is over the ship she drops from Davron's hold, bursting into a golden light as she calls again upon the essence. As she hits the ship she rolls, rising smoothly and holding her naginata at the twins. "Surrender the ship, children of the dragons, and you will be spared," she says flatly.

The man in blue briefly releases his grasp on the controls and begins a quiet chant. The elaborate cerise shade of his brother's armor catches the sunlight as his arm extends an accusing finger. "I'll send you demons back to hell," he grates, reaching to his back and drawing his daiklave in a blindingly swift motion. The weapon sings as it cleaves air, and the man seemingly bursts into flames of crimson Essence as he readies himself in a fighting stance. "You'll find your black blood on the edge of Maiden's Kiss soon."

With wings driving furious, Ramar soars up over the railing, tilting down as the volo's arm grows lax. Down tumbles the Su'Katan, and feet touch the deck to hurl him forward in a roll. Up he comes, form melting into a practiced stance. Kamas poised, his eyes become deadset on the pair; they linger a moment on the robed one, but knowing Davron is above, sights settle upon the Fire aspect. "If we be demons, then let Malfesa break lose, good sir."

The coruscant flare around the sword-fighter increases in intensity, and were the deck of the vessel not made of this strange ceramic-like substance, it would be so much ash now. Behind him, his brother completes his spell, and a gout of flame rushes outward from his hands, circling him in a protective cocoon.

Gallius lashes out in a series of quick strikes. Her foe is ready, though. The first two strike without effect, striking his armor, and the last is caught by his blade and turned aside.

Davron swoops around in an arc and alights in a standing position above the enemy craft. He focuses his mind, draws his bow back, and the alabaster wings of the volo are lit a brilliant purple and gold as his aura flares about him. A whistling sound, then, as arrows fly from the coruscating glow, hurtling toward the Dragon-Blooded's men even as those worthies ready their pistols in response.

He that wields the Daklaive must be stopped. Chi-Yosh does not bother with the men on the deck, and instead waits until the brilliance of Gallius's spear sparks by the light of the sun. Then the Su'Katan sprints forward, coming in like a pouncing jaguar from the side. With the jade blade busy parrying, in sweeps a kama by the man's hip right with a higher stroke ment for the man's shoulder. Essence blazes like angry stars behind each swing, the sparks swept up to dance within the anima's inferno. The Dawn sidesteps, one burning downward arc to the Dragon-Blooded's head, then a crouch for a low scything. If that sword draws back to him, Gallius's spear might strike from behind.

One by one the soldiers, doughty though they may be, are felled by Davron's arrows. An instant later, a fifth arrow whistles through the air toward the sorcerer as well. His fiery guardian flashes to interpose itself, and succeeds in singeing the shaft, but the arrow still gets past its guard and wounds the man beneath.

While the strikes are true, so to does the fire-blazed jade hold up. Man's steel scraps across sure armor once, twice, then uprises the daiklave, sparks flaring all the way down until weapons meet at the guard. The blade dips low to scoop the final strike free, leaving the air ringing with steel on jade, echoing the angry battle of essence.

A glance spared Gallius's way is all Chi-Yosh allows before an instinctive plan comes into work. He crouches down and surges forward, kamas held close, arms coiled. The first attack is tight to the body and savage, a bright warm explosion at collision. The second is executed as the Dawn drives forward, an overhead sweep marked to score the man close, in the chest, or to drive his blade down. All the while pushing to the ledge; his back is all ready to Gallius as much as the Su'Katan can get it, and if the attacks work, the daiklave will be low.

The fire-aspect's grin is grim as the Dragon's Chosen draws in a blessing. Moving as agile as the flame between the two Solars, the daiklave sweeps wide while he draws aside, allowing the Dawn's kamas to follow in the wake of his flaring anima to the Anathema behind him. However, the radiance and might of her power curbs the attacks.

With a sudden rush Gallius moves, first towards the robed twin. She leaps into the air, her spear twirling out from her left in a gleaming arch that reflects the light of the fires arrayed against her. Even as her feet touch the deck she twirls her weapon above her head, the blade of it brought to bear in a vicious slash at the neck of the armored dragon blood.

Gallius growls as her first swing is parried, but her a smile grows on her lips as the blade of her naginata digs into the flesh of her armored opponent. She spins away, reading herself for further attacks, now forcing her foes to either face her or face Chi-Yosh.

From the depths of the red knight's luminous, flickering aura, an explosion of flame appears, coruscating along his blade. He swings low, dodging and weaving with the agility of a bonfire, cutting at Chi-Yosh with all his might, growling.

Fire rails up the daiklave as it blows through kamas dropped in defense, dragging them with it in the hellish strike. Chi-Yosh's parry can only but draw the blade higher, letting it drive deep into his hip rather then threaten to severe a leg. He sways, blood a fountain down his thigh.

As Davron watches his companions struggle with the deadly foes, he leaps into action. With a mental command to the volo, he plunges down from the sky, gathering speed, faster, faster, his dive leveling out into a straight run right at the blue-robed sorcerer. The Solar archer roars his defiance, bearing down on his foe... and just as the Dragon-Blood turns his head to face him, Davron swerves aside, clearing the fringes of the Dragon-Blood's aura. As Davron swoops past, he rolls onto his back and his aura flares into the image of a great hawk, its glowing wings beating the air as he fires two arrows through the wake of his passage...

The glowing shield of the sorcerer flashes into position, and flares about the arrows as they plunge toward him - but enough of the arrows survive to slam into the blue-robed man and send him staggering, two smoldering tufts of feathers protruding from his chest.

With a hoarse cry of pain, the Dragon-Blooded sorcerer throws over the controls of the sky-ship. As one, the brothers leap port-side as the vessel tumbles to starboard, and they hurtle downwards into space. The invocations of a spell can be heard, and below, the first signs of a great vortex of wind can be seen forming around the twins. Meanwhile...

The deck of the ship pitches to the side. Like the sun blossoming over the edge the horizon, Chi-Yosh's anima is a raging flower of gold, pinks and reds. It curls around him as he charges up the severely tilting deck, jumping over a sliding corpse and leaping. Arm catching the railing, up sprints the Solar as the ship starts to become a pyramid. Blood is a river down his leg, pain screaming up nerves, but all that howls through the Dawn's mind like the wind clawing at his clothes is: move. The ship continues to turn, the incline growing steeper, until he leaps. Feet strike one of the gun barrels, and off he hurls himself. Head first he slides down the lessening incline until his arm lances through the railing, body twisting to coil himself around the support.

Gallius senses the rolling of the ship. She glares at the departing dragon bloods. Cowards. She throws herself at the rail, swinging her naginata out to stab into the ship with all her strength.

As two bodies plummet from the ship, summoning the winds to their sides, Ramar angles the Volo, slicing through the winds. Just as the pyramid begins turning over once more, the Volo releases him, tumbling onto the deck. As the ground starts to shift once more, Ramar vaults over the control's, turning mid-air as he lands. His hands fly over the controls, and the ship begins to turn the other way, rocking until it's level. "Alright... the ship is ours... I am bringing us lower now, if you would, see to the wounded."

---

When things are seen to, Gallius prepares those who should be brought. Lady Yuri, her knight Malis, Bloody Axe, and Jin-nu. The group is gathered on the air ship, along with Marina and the rest of the circle. Everyone is ordered to dress for ceremony. Bloody Axe naturally will be made to wait on the ship with Malis. Can't terrify these men completely. This is a show of power that is not to lead to war. Hopefully.

The camp of Marita's army is two days away from its objective; on the afternoon of the 10th day of Ascending Air, as the season-spirits whisper their chilly messages to each other on the wind, the Exalted sail their appropriated vessel sedately across the green and grassy fields, clearly in sight of the Confederation scouts, and flying a flag of parlay. They are met, explain their mission, and told to wait. It is half an hour later that General Saulos Nebarr himself, the scarred and cagey Dragon-Blooded commander of the forces here encamped, comes personally with his escort to meet these strange visitors.

Gallius leads the way, walking beside Jin-nu. She glows with the light of the sun, her caste mark glowing. She will not offer the greeting, for that is Marina's right and this is her task. Instead, she offers a bow to the commander and as she straightens meets his eyes, trying to gauge his reaction.

Stepping forward off, Marina raises one eyebrow, her mark flaring on her forehead. Gathering her essence inside her, she prepares for this battle; the kind of battle she is suited to. "General. We have come to talk." She looks around the encampment, before turning back to him. "Are you ready to listen?"

The general raises his walking-staff, tapping the hull of the sky-ship and smiling. "Well, quite a calling card you've brought. I've no choice but to receive you. I am listening."

Smiling, Marina nods. "Good. These are the calling cards we bring. We have redirected the river you planned to use, we have an army armed and ready, and ... as you have noted, we have your ship." She pauses, waiting for this to sink in. As he's about to speak, she interrupts him, knowingly. "We have come to discuss terms." She admires her nails for a moment, buffing them, not even doing the general the courtesy of keeping her eye on him nonstop.

"Terms for what? You are not the enemy, I assume," the General says, cordially enough. "You have my attention. Let's cut to the chase."

"The chase?" Marina smiles, inviting him to join her in the joke, such as it is. "I do believe, sir, we've concluded the first hunt. Now we meet to organize the second, larger hunt." She pauses a moment. "We would like to discuss the upcoming battle with our ... allies." Her pause is delicately timed. "Both the manner of the fighting, and the price and prize of victory."

"Allies, you say?" The general quirks an eyebrow, and rests on his staff for a few moments. "Well. We have many allies here, of course. None of... your particular nature. There are some who would say I consort with demons even to speak with you. What say you to that?"

"Demons, you say ..." Marina smiles impishly. "I say the gods smile on us. I say the dragons aid us. I say the spirits stand behind us." She lets that sink in for a moment. "Last of all, I say that it is one's actions that truly determine one's inner nature. And it is those actions we wish to discuss with you."

"Some would call us demons, ourselves, for what we propose to do," murmurs the general, glancing sidelong at the gathered Exalted and their allies. "But we, like you, must be judged by history. I assume you know of our plan. What are your concerns?"

Marina indicates Gallius, behind her. "We have ... those who wish to consult with you on the arrangement of the battle. We wish to assure that there shall be no looting, after the battle." She smiles. "I am blunt, I know, but it is demons who loot, and feast on the flesh of those weaker than themselves. We would prefer that no demons leave the field alive; the city will need time to recover, and we have offered our aid to them. We would not see it squandered."

The general turns, gesturing at one of the aides who came with him; the woman scurries off, and returns less than a minute later with an elderly woman, carrying a thick satchel. "What's this now?" she demands, to which the general replies, paraphrasing the demand. "Looting? Well, er, soldiers are soldiers, we can hardly hope to restrain them all..." she murmurs. The general nods. "The city will not be sacked," he says evenly, speaking to Marina at last.

"Indeed. You are a good man, general. Easy to discuss terms with." Marina smiles, her demeanour softening a little as she lets more of her charm leak out, and less of her presence. "We only have one other concern that I am sure we will clear up in no time. It's about the control of the forces on our side." She nods at Gallius. "We have thoughts on that."

"Indeed," says Gallius. "I am glad we were met politely, it allows us to speak in civil terms rather than at the point of blades. It seems that many of your goals have been achieved already. Whereas you had prepared a massive force to blow the river, we have used a small, mobile, and highly talented force to not only achieve this end without any losses on our side, but simultaneously used this event to take control of what we estimate to be half of the enemies air support."

"In a short time, the forces I have lead have exceed your goals. It would seem logical that my advice be given heavy weight. I do not stand utterly outside the structure of the Coalition, as I also have taken the lead of Roleyn's forces. Therefore some spot is by agreement owed to me. Since I also command a division of barbarians and with the aid of my friends have taken control of the river and half the sky, it seems that my position should be quite high. We are prepared to be fair about this, of course, but that is not so much the question. The question is, are you prepared to listen to take orders from demons who have already swept through most of your battleplan?"

"Well... " The general is given much pause, but at last he speaks. "I favor results, myself. Were it in my hands, I would consider the matter closed. However..." He glances sidelong at the old woman standing nearby before speaking again. "The Confederation is much like the rivers of these lands. Same water, different branches. Not all rivers flow the same direction, and my destiny is that I must sail them all."

Marina looks at Gallius. "Shall I offer help in the sailing, while you enjoy your whaling?"

Gallius grins at Marina, "Indeed, I think this matter is best left in your hands. General, perhaps we might talk our own language away from the streams? I have many questions and many answers, as well. Unless I miss my guess, the walls of Greyfalls are the most pressing issue on both our minds." The zenith smiles, quite eager to hear what the dragon blood general has to say.

Arrangements will be made. General Saulos will see to it. If the Solars wish for recognition in the chain of command, beyond that minor rank Gallius holds by birthright, it can be sued for. It'll only take convincing fifty separate leaders, most of which are gathered here.... And who can't even agree on what constitutes acceptable trail rations while campaigning. It'll be a long afternoon.
