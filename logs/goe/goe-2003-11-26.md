# Gods of Eden 2003-11-26

On perfectly flat ground, a mile and a half away from the dry river-bed of the Lesser Rock River, Ramar and Davron have begun their preparations. Five torches are pitched in the five cardinal directions, their eight-foot shafts sunk deep into the ground, their flames lit ritually with prepared oil at the moment the sun rises. Over the course of the day, the pair employ their ritual instruments, gleaned from the supplies the army has been willing to share.

Slowly, almost agonizingly slowly, Davron begins to build a tower of mud, shaping it into a hill, then another, molding it with his hands and watering it from time to time with a pitcher of spirit-blessed water. Ramar sits nearby, kneeling near the center of the guttering torches, chewing slowly and deliberately on the leaves of an herb that brings visions. As Davron sculpts the landscape and chants the sacred names of the Maidens of Journeys and Endings, Ramar rises from his position and begins making marks in the damp soil.

By the end of the day both men are weary, and as the five torches are ritually extinguished and wine can finally be brought into the circle, they collapse to the ground. The geomantic survey has been completed; the paths of power and the flow of luck and auspicious energies throughout the region is known.

Meanwhile, Marina canvasses the three villages located north of the city of Greyfalls, politely and subtly eliciting information about the area's magical and immaterial denizens. In particular she seeks knowledge of "forbidden places", areas where the Dragon-Blooded lords of Greyfalls forbid their common citizens to go, and what legends may be connected with such areas. Spirits, too, are a topic of investigation, though rarely are the questions she asks put in such bold terms. With the weapons of wine, charm and Charm, the negotiator wages her own subtle war to scale the walls of reserve and conquer the truth within.

Gallius has spent her day talking with her captains. Bloody Axe and Malis her main contacts. Lady Yuri has not been able to work in her normal circles so much, but still has made contact with the friendlies from the Marukani lands. "So this is it," muses Gallius. "It would seem the dice roll is coming soon," says Gari as he comes from behind.

The air is chilly this night. The wind is flowing swiftly across the land, which Davron and Ramar spent the daylight hours surveying. Now Ramar has rejoined the others, and has informed them of the results of the survey, letting them know the lay of the land, as it were. "I can only wonder how the rest of you fared, and how to best put this information to good use..."

Chi-Yosh shakes his head, staring into the evening. Their plan depends on the cast-away lives of other men. Yet, to the commanders it seems as a fit judgement. If they would not be sent on this fate that is chance, an executioner would wait. He does not like it, but he cannot see the potential for them to continue, and the possibility of changing their ways. And if not, they most likely will not suffer long. For now, i t is not to focus on the grim. War has just begun.

"We will take away their power, and hope we will have to kill less people," suggests Malis. Gallius nods slowly. "We want to avoid hurting those who deserve to live if possible. But we must win. The Unconquered Sun demands no less."

"I am curious though as to the cost of this victory. With any luck..." Ramar lets his voice trail off in silence for a while. _Is there a better way of dealing with those who have cast themselves in roles that perpetually harm others? Is there no hope of redemption? It is not mine to decide. Nor is it my wish to have to do so..._ Ramar settles back carefully, regarding the other members of the Circle, "Do we have a plan for gaining entrance to the Manses themselves? Just in case the... plan the council has come up with is not as effective as is hoped..."

Davron rests from his labors by the campfire. Now that the strenuous activity of the day is complete, he too is now free to contemplate what will be done with the fruits thereof. He looks up at Ramar. "Their... plan," he says, his voice breaking slightly and his eyes glinting with distress, "wouldn't gain us entry at all. It merely tells us which Manses are worth investigating." He sighs and looks back at the fire. "Human life... seems a high price for little other than gaining information."

Looking thoughtful, Marina nods slowly at Davron. "Information we have already gained, in large part? You through your surveys, and myself through the simpler method of listening?"

"Murderers and rapists rarely deserve mercy," says Gallius flatly.

Marina says, "Mercy? We're not offering them mercy. We're offering them new and painful ways to die."

Davron frowns, still looking troubled, and shakes his head slightly. "What you've gained, perhaps. All Ramar and I have done is to learn the places of power. We could not learn for certain, from afar, which ones are harnessed, let alone by whom. It is to answer the latter question that the... murderers and rapists," he says, smiling weakly at Gallius, "are to be sent to answer."

Ramar nods, "It is," he settles back, legs folded beneath him as he rubs at his temples. "Perhaps we can find an alternative." He looks at Marina, "Our surveys have let us know th lay of the lands and where we might find them, but I do not know enough to determine which ones we should enter and which ones we should not." He asks Davron, "Had you fared better?" When Gallius speaks, he turns, peering curiously at her, "And how is it that you are to decide those who deserve mercy and those who do not...? I am curious, as the decision is a very weighty one in my heart."

"We are Chosen," answers Gallius. "We will lead. Do you think a leader can shirk the duty of judgement? Even before this was my fate--to judge men and condemn those who I deem guilty." She sighs softly, "In any case, their deaths will serve a purpose, perhaps enough to balance the evil they did while they lived."

"Perhaps. It is not for us to decide their fates ultimately. We can offer them a choice to perhaps better themselves or at least their fates in the next life." Ramar glances downwards, eyes staring off into the distance. "If we are unable to do anything else, then we must see to it that their deaths are not in vain, and that their sacrifice has meaning."

Davron rubs his chin, and stares into the flickering flames once more, as if they would provide him counsel. "I suppose... the judgment has already been made. By the tribunals, the courts, or whatever the armies of the Confederation use to determine guilt or innocence." He picks up a twig from the ground and twists it between his fingers. "If anything... we're offering them a chance at life. Sparing them from the executioner's axe and sending them to an uncertain fate - death perhaps, or worse than death... but then again, perhaps not."

With a sigh, Chi-Yosh pats Davron on the shoulder. "We are instruments of the Unconquered Sun. And part of that includes righteousness and justice. The gods will decide what happens, after the thresholds of those manses are breached."

Davron looks up at Chi-Yosh, and smiles a little more firmly. "Yes, that's true. Though... if we're to be instruments of justice, it may well be our role some day to _decide_ it, rather than merely administer it. I just hope... that when I face such choices, I'll be able to do the right thing. To let live those who should live..." He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. "And put to death those who should die."

Ramar regards Davron, "It may well be indeed." He offers this small comfort, "However, that you are asking such questions now is a sign that at least when the time comes the decision won't be made lightly. There is some peace of mind in that... now let us plan for the morning..."

The deliberations of the Confederation's military leadership - the strategoi of Lookshy, the princes and lordlings and dictators and democrats - occupy a day and a half of heated discussion, and armed guards stand as a watchful barrier around them. The decision is returned by messenger to where the Solars are gathered on their airship, plotting out their campaign. In true Confederation tradition, the reply employs words like a strutting peacock might use its colorful tail.

"To the esteemed captors of the sky-ship of the Realm," it reads, "greetings and salutations. We, the convened Lords of the Confederation of River, Protectors of the River-Lands of the Eastern Threshold, Defenders of Justice and Peace, acknowledge the considerable service you have rendered in our war effort.." Marina scans the document, noting the relevant points: First, that the war-council will cede control of Roleyn's forces to Gallius at her discretion. Second, that the Marukani and River-people's forces will obey the old treaties and alliances and obey her if she commands them. Third, that no greater force will fall under the command of any the Confederation has not authorized. Fourth, that such exceptional results indicate exceptional power and that the war-council will lend its aid to the Solars to the extent possible.

Gallius looks at the 'fine points' and snorts in disgust. "So what they are saying, simply, is that they will 'give' me what is already mine by birth, and that they hold us in esteem. I fear we are on the brink of two wars, not one," she murmurs. She stretches a bit, smirking, "So be it. Valon no doubt is prepared for just this. I don't imagine I should have hoped for much more than this."

Davron chuckles. "Let's hope it doesn't come to another war, Gallius. The Confederation may not be everything we could hope they'd be, but they're a darn sight better than the Realm." He nods to the document, grinning. "As fractious as they seem to be, we might be lucky they could even agree on that much."

It is a rather interesting thing for Ramar, watching as the messenger arrives. The way words are employed as... well as a way of displaying prowess... _It seems as though he is using his words to inflate his being. This is something to be wary of, learn from this display if nothing else. And now I am not the one being undiplomatic_ Ramar smiles, a soft serene expression crossing his face. After the messenger leaves, he sets about composing a response. He shows it to the others. It reads 'We are pleased to know the wishes of those who have sent you, and moreover, we shall of course accept those terms already in existence. Although the... possibility of further negotiations should of course remain open, that we might aid one another in this endeavour and not come to squabble any more than is absolutely necessary.' He smirks, "There that seems wordy enough for them. Shall we send it back and be on our way?"

Shrugging, Marina looks at the proposed response. "I wouldn't bother, Ramar. They know we have received their decision. If we do not respond, we leave ourselves open to renegotiating later."

"The Chosen of Helios will take whatever he tells them to, and will not trouble to negotiate," says Gallius.

The Manse of Roses is a crimson building, decorated with floral motifs across its surface. True roses are also planted around the borders of the Manse itself, growing strong and beautiful in the fertile soil of the East. The Manse stands near a grove of trees, and the approach to it is a simple stone bridge over a softly babbling brook. The scene is peaceful and calm, not at all suggestive of danger. This is no consolation to the three men who now trek mournfully toward it. These three, the "Bitter Root of the Swiftly-Growing Vine" (known as the the Walking Dead to some), are sent to examine the defenses of the Manse. If they return alive, the Manse may not be an objective after all.

Half an hour passes before the screams are heard, and with wary steps the Solars edge forward. Chi-Yosh is the first through the archway, and he perceives twin ramps on either side of a large room. The interior of the Manse is alive with red, brown and green hues, decorated richly with crystal and stone mined from the surrounding lands. At the top of the twin ramps are two platforms, with darkened doors leading deeper into the structure. A hand protrudes from the darkness of the left-hand door, draped over the edge of the platform there, stained red and dripping blood slowly onto the vermillion floor beneath.

Chi-Yosh surveys the manse with a wary eye. The screams have echoed forth, and so - the drip of the blood upon the floor draws his attention. Up, up the ramps, to the darkness beyond and the dead appendage set as though it beckons. He turns, waving to the others to come, and as they move in, he directs in a fanning pattern as he moves up the ramp, quiet as a hare. Kamas are poised, the crouch tense like a paranoid snake. He draws close to the shadows, awaiting the needed backup, before he can get a better look at the corpse and the cause of demise.

The body inside the left-hand doorway is wound tightly in vines - the man's face is set into a ghastly rictus of pain, for his arms, legs, neck and torso have been pierced by the innumerable thorns of the rose whose unnaturally elongated length has constricted around him.

"And so the wicked have fallen this day in the name of glory." Ramar mutters this sadly, keeping his voice as soft as a feather's fall. He draws his sword and follows after Chi-Yosh, readying himself for danger as his awareness slips into the ambient fields of Essence. The soft dripping of blood onto the floor, and the sound of a now stilled heart seems to echo in Ramar's head. He can hear the way the droplets of blood impact against the pool, hear the flow of blood into the darkness, where the corpse is sure to lay. He listens for the sound of things within the walls, hidden things, he sniffs about for the scent of danger, relying on more than simply sight to guide him.

Davron has spent most of the morning studying the _River of Heaven_, learning what he can of the structure of a Manse and what its weaknesses may be. Still, given his still-limited familiarity with the ancient language of the tome, and the short amount of time at his disposal, he feels that he'll mostly be dependent on his intuitive sense for the occult. His eyes flick from place to place as he studies the architecture, seeking for the signs that will guide his search, resting finally and uneasily on the corpse. He nods to Ramar and Chi-Yosh, and follows the Su-Katan, stepping likewise around the unfortunate who'd discovered the Manse's defenses the hard way.

Gallius will just move with the group, readying herself for whatever might happen. She stays quiet for now, waiting to see just what is going on in this manse.

"Someone is breathing, further inside, though I cannot tell whether it is oneo f those sent with us or not. It does sound Human, though. More blood lies this way... let us see if we can find whatever it is that is still alive." Ramar gestures further inward with the tip of his sword, his free hand held alongside the hilt as he advances forward slowly. As he does, he looks around carefully, keeping his senses open for the telltale signs of whatever it is that lays ahead.

The next room is wider, shaped like an oval, whose far side is blocked off entirely by a thick wall of thorned vines and rose-blossoms. The bramble would be impassable, and the fate of anyone who dares cut it is clear - one man lies in a pool of his own blood, likewise constricted by deadly vines. The third man lives, but holds very still, a knife clenched in his hand. Vines surround him but do not tighten - yet. He's sweaty and afraid, motionless in the midst of the vines which threaten to rive life from his body, unable to move the knife in any direction without severing something. And it's clear that the act of cutting through the vines is what brought his companion to his grisly fate, for his knife lays discarded among the thicket.

Gallius wanders up to the vines, inspecting them carefully. "Don't touch the vines if you want to live, convict," she says softly. "Time to find out just what this is like." She sticks an armored hand into the brambles, pushing it inside and watching the reaction at this harmless maneuver.

"Hold very, very still," says Ramar, stating the obvious. He leans in to inspect the vines carefully, though not so close that he would set anything off. "If you attempted to go through... I would worry about what would happen to those trapped within." He explains to the others, "We need to find some means of freeing him, lest we kill him in our attempts to get through."

There is a niche between the twin archways leading into this room, visible as the Solars turn about in place to study the area. On the left is a silver pitcher for watering plants, empty. On the right is a small basin of water, which can apparently fill up the pitcher.

"Perhaps if we were to fill the pitcher and provide the plants with some kind of nourishment other than blood, their thirst may be satiated?" Ramar gestures towards the pitcher, "Although again, I would worry about our results if this merely made them grow further..." He walks forward to inspect the pitcher and the basin.

Davron raises a hand. "Steady, Ramar. You may be right, but let's not rush things. Nourishing the plants may make them worse." He steps forward to join Ramar by the niche, studying the pitcher contemplatively.

"Well then..." Ramar turns his gaze towards the prisoner trapped in the vines. He takes hold of the pitcher, filling it with water, and moves towards the cluster of vinces holding the dead convict. He begins watering the vines, the clear water mixing with the blood-stained floor as it washes over the thorn-impaled convict.

A bad feeling can only creep over Chi-Yosh as the water nears the plants. He moves forward, quickened as clear water splashes through the air and into the vines. The tendrils rear up, lashing forward with waiting, spiked limbs to collect the giver of water. They drag across Ramar's clothing as Chi-Yosh's fist has sunk into the Eclipse's shirt, throwing himself backwards while yanking Ramar.

There is a surprised shout as the thorny vines wrap themselves around Ramar. He attempts to dodge, though he's not at all fast enough to avoid being snared by the vines. Even as they snare him, the thorns begin lengthening, and though the tips of some of them break against his armor, many more are shooting through his arms and legs, wounding him greatly. Ramar cries out in pain.

Ramar avoids being completely trapped though, pulling free of the vines. He darts back towards the basin, "Well..." he takes in a deep breath, "We now know what not to do."

"Well, that's obviously not it. I have some oil back outside with Malis and Gari. We could just burn this whole place to the ground. Wouldn't that remove the attunement, Davron? Or should we fertilize this place with our blood instead?" Gallius shrugs at Ramar. "Not a clue. The whole water and pitcher could be nothing at all except for drinking."

Davron shakes his head at Gallius. "Let's try a few more things first. First of all, what we do may well be _symbolic_, so we probably shouldn't even be going near the roses at all." He sets the pitcher and basin down in their original places. "Now..." he says, beginning by picking up the pitcher and emptying it sideways into the basin, then motioning as if to pour the empty pitcher into the basin...

Chi-Yosh winces as the vines rend into Ramar, and he takes the man aside, inspecting the wounds. There is nothing he can do for Ramar as of now, but the wounds are telling and will hamper them further. All he can do is smile at the Westerner, clapping him on the back. "Try not to get hurt again?"

"I think I'll do my best not to. It's not as bad as that time when I was caught by the poisoned dart..." Ramar gives a bit of a smirk, as he concentrates on his wounds a moment, willing them to stop bleeding so freely. He looks back at the pitcher, and the basin, "Perhaps if you filled the pitcher, and set it back in it's place, it might signify to the plants that they are to wait to be watered instead of being as... active as they are?"

Gallius looks to Davron and raises a brow. Riiiight. She just glares at the roses. Symbolic. Right. "I prefer gunboat symbolism," she says. "What precisely are we supposed to water, then? Go outside, throw water everywhere and hope we don't get killed for our kindness?" She grins, but there's a very real chance that she's serious.

Davron nods to Ramar. "Or perhaps if we empty the basin into the pitcher, it will mean that the roses are no longer watered..." he says, and carefully pours the contents of the basin into the pitcher.

"No, that doesn't seem to be it. I would suggest leaving both the basin and the pitcher half full, and seeing if that has any effect." Ramar pours half of the water from the pitcher into the basin, taking care to get the measurement as accurate as he can.

Gallius shrugs at the guys, "Just a moment, going to get Marina in here. I think I'm beginning to look forward to fighting a real battle after this." And she's going to mosey on outside, since the only real danger here is plucking roses.

Gallius will get outside and bow to Marina, "Well, fine time, isn't it? Air is pretty nice here." She admits, "We're failing in marvellous fashion. This might be up your ally. So far I'm thinking we either burn the place down or miss the next hundred years staring at a pitcher and a basin. Care to give it a try?"

Davron nods to Gallius. "Fair enough," he says. As the roses remain obstinately motionless, he says, "Well, they certainly reacted when you poured water on them directly. Obviously, the water has _something_ to do with them. Hm... before I try deliberately spilling some of the water, let me try this..." He refills the pitcher, then carries the empty basin over to the wall of roses, setting it on the floor.

"I warn you Davron, they move faster than it seems as though they do." Ramar moves near Davron, preparing to aid the Twilight in his attempt to escape if it should be needed, even as the basin is set. "Now then... let's see if this doesn't work..."

Marina looks thoughtful, considering the description of the basin, and the pitcher. Certainly, they seem evocative. "Davron and Ramar have confirmed that the basin and pitcher are actually related to the powerflows of the manse?"

"Well then, perhaps it is to do with the niche itself. It may be that the location is the key to controlling them," explains Ramar, "When the pitcher is full and the basin is empty... hmmm..."

Looking at Gallius, Marina shrugs. "It seems to me that experimenting with the basin and the pitcher is much safer outside the manse."

Gallius nods to Marina, and will go back inside. "Feel free to tag along, if you want. It doesn't seem to kill you unless you make mistakes. Talking at least is safe. So far." She's clearly more than ready to burn this place to the ground. She adds louder to Gari, "Prepare some oil. I think we may be having a little brushfire shortly."

Davron frowns, as he and Ramar try several combinations of pitcher, water, and basin, all equally fruitless. "This is frustrating," he grumbles. "I'm just going to take the water away from these things and see what they do about _that_!" he declares, snatching up the full water pitcher and carrying it out of the room.

Gallius reaches down to pluck a rose. Having yanked off the pretty thing, she sees the suddenly lashing out of the vines. She whirls to block them, but suffers much as Ramar did. When she flounders back she growls. "That's it. Here, it was dear bought." She throws the plucked rose at the wall of brambles and stomps out. In a few moments, her voice can be heard, "Gari, bring me the oil! We've lost enough time here. This should have been left to the dragon blood sorcerors!"

Gari looks at Gallius and arches a brow. "You really think you should burn a place like this, Gally?" The Lady draws herself up, her eyes narrowing. "I would put the world to the torch if Lord Helios desired it. Just be ready."

Davron watches Gallius go, and sighs. "There's got to be another way..." he says. "Here," he says, filling the basin full of the water, then taking the empty pitcher and pouring it over the cluster of roses that just assaulted Gallius. To his astonishment and relief, the sprouted stems wither and die. "Ramar!" he calls. "Go get Gallius! We're on our way!" he says, 'pouring' the lack of water over the stems that sprout from the walls.

"Very well." Ramar leaves the Manse, staying wary of any roses that may still be active. Once outside, he regards Gallius with a smile, "We have found a way through. You see? It did not take but a few minutes of careful thought and so the problem was solved... come on then, we can head for the heart of the Manse now."

"You can go ahead," answers Gallius. "I have no interest in entering." She turns away from the manse, a palpable chill coming from her. "Malis, Yuri, Gari. We have things to discuss," she says flatly. "I'll see to your-" starts Malis, but Gally cuts him off with a gesture. "It is irrelevant. The battle is everything." And with that, she will draw her followers away from the manse to plot out a new strategy. Not against Greyfalls, but against the Coalition, after that war is won.

"Gallius? Why do you not come with us? Battle is not everything," he says as she departs, "There are other things to be done... however..." He shrugs and turns, heading back into the Manse. _I worry about her... she seems to be angrier than before... but then we all have our moments of frustration._ Ramar rejoins the others, "Lady Gallius is to leave us. She wishes to plot with her followers our strategy no doubt. Let us continue and reclaim this Manse."

Chi-Yosh watches as the roses wither and die beneath the pitcher. He gestures for Davron to clear the Bitter-Root, who shrinks away until all is clear, before he springs up. Chi-Yosh blocks his path, staring equally at the condemned man. "What you have done, it must have been horrible for your commanders to give you this fate. You did not end up as they," A gesture toward the two dead men, "So some god has taken pity. Honor that choice, and do not defy the honorable path soldier. I say you are free to go; ask my fellows if you may leave. But if you do, realize this: the gods do not look favorable at wasted second chances. If you were spared now, imagine what will not be stopped later."
