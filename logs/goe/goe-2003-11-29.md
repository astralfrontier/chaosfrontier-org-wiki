After the apparent taking of the Manse, Gallius moves away from it, leaving such things to others. She gathers her followers about a fire which has been prepared and begins to speak to them.

"War is almost upon us," she begins in her calm, confident voice. "In battle there are many possibilities, death not the worst. Dishonor and disgrace await those who violate the honorable rules of combat." Gallius settles on her knees, her spear laid beside her. "All contests require rules, and war is the most die of conquests."

Trying to remain quiet, Lady Yuri draws out a small book which serves as her journal. A bottle of ink and a pen are taken out next and she prepares to write, some impulse in her indicating this may be important.

"And so I plan to propose a set or rules for this conflict," says Gallius. "And also for all armies I lead to follow." Malis nods his head and Gari looks away, obviously not pleased about any talk of battle.

"The first crimes I speak of are crimes of the sides. I call them this because either victor or defeated may commit them, and the entire army is at fault for allowing them. Among these crimes are slaughter and large cases of arson and theft. Burning cities after conquest and killing entire cities of people are examples of these crimes. For such terrible offenses the entire command structure is to blame and must be slain. Their followers should be punished with the rod or slavery. For theft, 9 strikes of a rod. For massacre, ten years of slavery. For burning cities four years of slavery. When the command structure does nothing to restrain their men, they are all guilty up the chain from the company to the general of the army."

Gallius goes on, paying little attention to the writing of Lady Yuri. "There are also the individual crimes of soldiers that are to be administered by their commanders." She pauses for a moment to consider the stars and the moon before going on. "Those who commit rape or murder those who are not in combat must be slain. Those who steal from noncombatants without due purpose are to be given 10 lashes if the value of the item is deemed small or 30 if is it considerable. The disarming of civilians is not theft unless the commanders define it as such."

"Before any conflict there should be offer of succour to the uninvolved, so that those who claim defensive stance may protect those who wish to stand away from combat. The slaying of women and children who ought to be left aside puts us in the stead of mean beasts and is not to be tolerated."

The followers of Gallius remain silent, allowing their lady to continue. "It is critical to meet enemy commanders in an honorable manner before battle whenever conditions allow. In certain cases the use of ambush and surprise is critical to victory, which is the goal of all armies. It is critical to understand the universal laws of war are few. In some cases, there may be no such thing as a citizen who is not in the army. There are certain kingdoms in which all men and women must train in the ways of war from youth and they do not lessen in valor with age. In this case, the slaying of the army may appear to others as massacre, but it is not so simple."

"What is right does not vary by the way the enemy approaches war. What is reasonable does," says Gallius. "In most cases, the toleratin of surrender is commendable. However, certain despicable warriors will feign surrender and then return to battle, defying the laws of war. Should such men return to their camps, they should be judged harshly and slain for murder."

"Should cases of false surrender go unpunished it is just and wise for a side to refuse surrender or dishonor their opponents by placing them in heavy bondage before accepting their surrender. All those who feign surrender should be slain. By the noose or the axe. Either way can afford a swift way to justice."

All this talk of slaying and hanging makes Gari blanche, but the Lady Yuri shows no such signs of surprise, and Malis nods in agreement. "All sentences of men can be reduced or pardoned by their commanders if there is proof of innocence or in the case of minor crimes, signs of value in the convict."

Gallius turns away from these generalities and applies what she says to Greyfalls. "Men who loot the city of Greyfalls are to be punished severely. The commander of a force has the full right to increase penalties prior to engagement and to judge signs of treason or cowardice as they arise. Either may be punishable by death, the lash, or terms of slavery. In the case of Greyfalls, treason shall earn death. Looting will cost a man his hand. Rape shall cost a man his neck, and also will the penalty of murdering those who surrender honorably or who are not in the combat bring death to the offender."

"The rewards of combat belong to the victorious," says Gallius. "However, the men who surrender should also be shown appropriate honor. If they have carried themselves in battle with honor and fairness they are to be commended and are not to be enslaved. The guilty who surrender must be punished as any other. Those who do not fight may be held away from their homes, but should not be treated roughly without cause. The righteous goal of all warfare to those who follow my words is to unite men and restore the order that once was, seeking another great age for us all."

"The rules of warfare are not, however, reserved only for men," says Gallius. "We must battle as honorable men if honorable we would be. You cannot throw away the laws of war against any foe, even the Fair Folk or the slaves of the Deathlords. Victory over fell enemies is pointless if you yourself become something to be despised."

"The victorious in all battles may claim grievance against those they have battled, and those defeated may do the same," says Gallius. "Though it might prove difficult for commanders to find their force at fault, they must be the supreme judge in these cases and listen fairly. If there should be a neutral party of appropriate wisdom that both sides can agree upon, they shall judge the affair. If both sides prove guilty of causing the battle there is no grievance, but there remains the right of armies in victory. Armies in victory may take one tenth of all material wealth from the conquered. These spoils of war cannot include food unless the victorious are out of supplies, and even then the lives of those who have stood outside combat may not be threatened."

Gari opens his mouth, but does not speak, listening to the calm words of Gallius, who nearly chants as she makes clear her wishes. "Should grievance be reached, the cost of battle lies upon one side. Should it rest upon the defeated, the judge may allow a higher percentage of wealth to be taken from the conquered army. They may also rule that those in the defeated land must cede territory permenantly to cover this greater cost or strip them of the right to bear arms outside of their city."

"Should the victors prove guilty, they lose all right to indemnities from the vanquished and must instead offer weregeld for all those slain. The costs of this are based upon station and rank of those killed. The victors may also be forced to cede territory and certainly are not to be allowed to hold any additional lands for their victory."

"Who can make the victors honor these rules?" asks Gari softly. At this, Gallius smiles, "The future, as I see it, involves a nation of nations, a city of many states all with different people and customs, but all working together with honor. Thus, there is a pressure to not defy laws by all those in power. It is much like the Coalition of Rivers, but I see it is as a more firmly-tied force. Thus if one nation should assail another in this group, their action will be judged by a council or by a single justice. This allows for judgements of such weighty matters to take part without requiring any man to bear judgement against his own cause."

At this, Gallius falls silent, looking towards Greyfalls. "It may come to pass, my friends, that we are betrayed by the Coalition of Rivers," she says. "I do not trust them very well, though their leader at least seems a wise and fair man. He is but one face among many who are trying to organize this farce of an army." Malis laughs softly, "They are indeed very much a ragtag lot. You have no time to fix the Marukani situation, so I fear we must make due with what providence has offered us." Gallius nods to this, "Indeed. Let us trust to the favor of Mars. Victory shall belong to the righteous."

Throughout this, Lady Yuri writes away, recording whatever she can of Gallius' words for later consideration. "My lady is wise to plan a course for even the most dire of situations," she says softly. Gallius sighs softly, "I wish I could trust them to win and then depart, but I fear they will behave poorly. For the rest of the night we will have to discuss a strategy in case this should occur." And long into the dark hours do the followers speak with their lady, plotting and preparing against the worst of cases.
