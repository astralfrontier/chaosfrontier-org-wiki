# Gods of Eden 2003-12-07

As the night descends Gallius becomes very difficult to find. She's not in her usual haunts, but her followers can help Ramar find her. The directions lead a full two miles from the city, but when Ramar draws close, he knows he is not astray, for a sad sound song can be heard in the air. A song that hasn't been heard in creation for a very long time, the sound of an ophicleide.

It is no difficult task to follow the sounds of the keyed serpent, it's wailing shattering the serene calm settling in before the storm that is sure to follow. As the last few rays of sunlight threaten to sink beneath the horizon, Ramar comes upon Gallius. A few moments pass, as he waits for her song to finish, as he does not wish to interrupt her playing.

The song ends with the failing of the sun and Gallius sets the instrument aside. She stares off towards Greyfalls, murmuring, "I must save her. If she dies, I fear what is best in me will die with her."

A few graceful steps carry Ramar down from his observation point, and with the sound of rustling leaves and falling footsteps, Ramar is beside Gallius, as one thin ray of light remains, illuminating the sky, and painting it shades of violet and orange. "Gallius..." speaks Ramar, his voice filled with serenity, "We will save her, though I fear for you. There is much that troubles me that we must speak of."

"I will be what Lord Helios wishes me to be," answers Gallius. "We are ringed in enemies who will do anything to thwart us. The Abyssals, the Guild, the Fair Folk, and of course the Realm. I wonder if we shall ever get to enjoy a day of real peace? I know we live a long time, but I cannot see so far. I will be plotting battles and rebellions for centuries at the least."

"Even the very wise cannot see all ends Gallius. Though all may look bleak and trying in the future, there is always hope." Ramar pauses, "Always." There is a sad smile on Ramar's face as he regards Gallius, "I do not believe you have been asked to be anything other than yourself. It is all that has been asked of any of us."

"I suppose," answers Gallius. "We are meant to be victorious, but that does not mean we shall not suffer for it. We shall. This is just a small battle, not even a real war. It is just the beginning and already the stakes are thousands of lives. I do not wonder if I am the right person for this job, but rather wish that the ones I admire would not have to face such danger." She smiles and lets out a sigh, "There are so many evil people in the world, Ramar. I am an axe, and I will remove them root and branch. We are just starting, so I cannot strike hard yet, but there time shall come. I will not forget what they would do out of greed and malice."

"No Gallius. You are not an axe. Look around you," Ramar gestures out at the surrounding land, pointing out where birds dip below the tops of trees, as the steady flow of Creation moves on. "Look to the East, to the lands where we have worked in the past, look to the North, to the city you have freed... think of how many there are that you have saved already, think of how many mothers will see the joy of their child's first steps. Think of eyes thatwould weep for hoy if they knew why they were able to look up and see before them the Sun, warming the world with it's gentle touch. Think of the others to come," Ramar shakes his head, stating once more, and this time quite vehemently, "You are no axe."

"I suppose you are right," says Gallius. "But for now, war is my way. And ever will it be needed. The justice I shall bring will make many weep for mercy, and I fear few of them will be spared. If so long a time has taught men that greed and disregard of their fellows is tolerable, it shall be my goal to swiftly show them that justice has returned. The faithful of Helios will not stand by." She looks to the stars, watching them slowly claim the sky, "And yet I regret the blood we must spill. These are men who might have been valiant and noble, but for the sad times."

"If I am right, and you believe what you say, you may be the worst casualty to this war." Ramar shakes his head, blinking away moisture pooling in his eyes. "Death and justice are not the same Gallius. It is time the world learned that things have changed, yes, but to show them by destroying them does nothing. To pull up the roots disturbs the soil and destroys all life around it, so that nothing can grow. Instead... what if you showed these men and women who have known naught but cruelty and greed in their lives... that there is something other than this... something other than death and existence? What if you showed them the kindness that they have never known, and how to nurture their fellows rather than conquer them? I ask you, can the Sun's touch be as gentle as it can be fierce? Need I tell you the story of the Wind and the Traveller?"

"You make changing a man sound very easy, Ramar," says Gallius, laughing softly. "As the heir to Roleyn, I have judged men. I know that men are extremely difficult to change. Many times it is impossible. You cannot selfishly avoid harsh judgements to seem gentle and forgiving. It is very hard to explain to a woman why you let the killer of her son go free two weeks before, when you had fair reason to stop him then. Justice is tempered by mercy, but if we waver and favor kindness we will likely have a lot to answer for."

Ramar regards Gallius, "Then why is Gari still alive? Why are any of us still alive? Certainly in these battles we have become the killers of mothers sons?"

Gallius sighs softly, "You truly don't know the difference between the murder of a worthy person and death in battle? Hmm, how old are you, Ramar?" She looks seriously at her circlemate, frowning, "It is the difference between night and day, of course. There are those who are evil and vile. They steal, they oppress, and they use other men like animals. These must be destroyed. If they wish to change their ways, they must lay down their arms and surrender to us. Than we shall let them make amends for what they have done, even if it should take the rest of their lives. If they will not surrender, the judgement shall not be so gentle. There is a difference between the death of a warrior and murdering him while he sleeps."

"There is indeed a difference Gallius. I apologize, for I have misspoken. Words are failing me. I have sat here arguing with you the necessity of war and death and justice, which is not what I came to do. I came to speak with you about what troubles me. About you. About the darkness that is casting it's shadow upon you. About the desire to make war upon the world."

Ramar says, "I have come to show you that you are no mere axe. To show you that kindness and compassion are more than things to be avoided. To show you how those whose lives you touch touch the lives of others, and how you can reap more than what you are sowing now. Yet... I am failing myself, for I cannot find the right words."

Ramar says, "I am... sorry Gallius, I am failing you."

"You are the dreamer among us, Ramar," says Gallius softly. "Your concern will stay with me. Even if you feel you have failed here somehow, I do not believe it is the case. I am not dead yet, so your fears and your hopes for me go on." She laughs softly once more, "Though I rather wonder what Valon would think if he saw you with me here. Are you trying to woo yourself a Lady of Roleyn?" Her words are a gentle tease, of course.

"I cannot simply stand and watch. I would show you that you need not walk this path you set yourself down, that you can instead forge your own path, your own destiny. That you can bring your Light to the world, and that it will be all the brighter for your journeys. That is why I am here." As he has been speaking, his words have grown more hopeful, more compassionate, and it is almost as though this last ray of the Western Sun is shining upon Ramar, lending its warmth to his words, lending its beauty to his thoughts.

"I am the instrument of Helios' will, Ramar," says Gallius. "Any who would stand against him are my enemies, and though I hope to change their mind, should they remain in the darkness, I will show them no quarter. I have no illusions." She sighs softly, "I am tired of this, Ramar. I have worked so hard to prepare for this moment. I have risked my life to ensure that the refugees would have a place to stay. I nearly died to gain the leadership of Non Valon's forces. And now some stupid, spineless merchants think they can stand in the way of the Unconquered Sun and feel no bite of judgement for it. I think they have woefully understimated the righteous wrath of Lord Helios."

Ramar gives a soft laugh at Gallius' words, doing nothing to hide the redness about the tips of his ears. "I thank you for your kind words Gallius, Lady of Roleyn. And I feel more at ease knowing that it is not all in vain... although the day I manage to woo anyone is the day that the grass grows green in the sky, and that the waters flow from the sea up into the mountains..."

"From what I have heard of the wonders of the First Age, Ramar, those things might just be possible," says Gallius. "But I do not think you need fear. My temper is harsh, but I am merciful in victory. And your dread relies upon a power we lack. For now, we are at the mercy of the likes of the Guild and the Realm. They likely could kill us, if they wished. I do not know what will happen to use after this war. Should we win, our tales shall move like wildfire. Will it be enough for the Realm to fear us? We may have to do what I hate most after our victory, Ramar. We may have to hide."

"Then I fear no longer, but I needed to make them known and I am sorry to have taken your time in such a manner." He smiles a simple smile, showing great relief. "And though we may yet have to hide after our victory, there are other things we might do. Other ways of combatting the Guild, or the Realm. I believe I understand how you must feel though." A hand is placed gently on Gallius' shoulder, "There will come a day when the world will know of us, and we will not need to hide any longer."

"I've lost one sister already," says Gallius quietly. "I don't want to lose someone that I feel might take a similar place in my heart, Ramar." She sighs and raises a hand, setting it over his. "But thank you. I am glad you are with me tonight. It is a bad time to be alone."

There is a confused look on Ramar's face as Gallius talks of losing someone else that might take a similar place, "I'm not quite sure I know who you mean, but you are welcome Gallius. I am glad to share company with you, at any time it is needed."

"Have you ever met someone and knew that they were a kindred spirit? That is how I felt the moment I met Alcis. I felt we were so alike, and I wished to have her friendship, but now.." Gallius sighs. "It is a sad affair that makes those who should be together enemies, in my mind. And yet here we stand, in a contest of armies and assassins and creatures of darkness. How can we even be sure just whom our allies are?"

"We shall simply have to trust. Be it ourselves, be it the Sun... we shall simply have to. I have not yet met Alcis, but if you say she is a kindred spirit, and the two of you should be together instead of enemies, then I shall help you. We will save her. Do not forget that Marina has the dagger of a Guild Assassin, so they can be dealt with. Which leaves us only one foe to worry about now..." Ramar turns to Gallius, and bows his head low, "Although I do not know what I can do against this creature of darkness, I will stand against him with you."

Ramar says, "If that is what it comes to."

"I would rather he just leave at this point," says Gallius. "I don't like my changes against the creatures of darkness. Not yet. I heard that the Abyssals slew many demons in the manse you entered. Is that no true?"

"I would rather he just leave as well. Although you are suited to battling against the darknes more than I. He did slay many demons, and butchered them afterwards. He intended to wait on the men of the city to come and investigate, before moving on to begin turning Greyfalls into a Shadowland," says Ramar, glancing back at Gallius.

"You really think they are powerful enough to simply do that? Just two of them?" murmurs Gallius. "If so, I'm not certain I can do much to stop them. What did our new friend Rumika have to say of them? Surely they aren't that strong."

"I do not know how powerful the demons were, or how injured or weakened the deathknight was. It may have been no easy task, or he may have had aid from Rumika and the other." Ramar gives a rather noticeable shiver, stepping closer to Gallius, at the thought of the two Abyssals he ran into that day. "I do not know what she has had to say of them, I have not had the chance to ask her that yet. Though I think one of the others might have while I was out scouting."

"I fear we will need to learn all we can of these creatures. We are likely to meet them many times," says Gallius. "I hope to also hear from The Master about our situation. We have not made good use of his wisdom as of late, and I think we had best change that trend before it lands us in serious trouble."
