# Gods of Eden 2003-12-10

Gallius wastes no time in sending out her messages. To Alcis a very simple message is sent: A grave danger approaches. There are those who seek your head and I fear that I am not strong enough to defend you from them. The Guild and Abyssals are after you. Trust no one who comes in my name, for the enemy may bear many shapes. I shall come to you myself with the caste emblem of the Zeniths burning brightly. I will come as soon as I may.

The Twins whom she met in Greyfalls and whom the others helped fight for the airship are also sent a message: You have not failed your mission yet. I am Gallius of the Zenith Caste, servant of the Unconquered Sun and defender of the misplaced people of Greyfalls. There is a terrible threat looming over us all. The Guild and the Abyssals wish to have their way with Greyfalls. Both seek the head of Alcis, and I need your aid in preventing it. I will meet you at Netrot two hours before dawn. If you are late, I will not be able to wait. We have no time, for the servants of darkness know ways to steal the forms of others. You will know I am who I am when I show you the caste mark of the Zenith. Trust none who come in my name, for I will come to you myself.

The village of Netrot is so named for the familiar reek of fish that hangs over it - a peculiar odor that distinguishes the natives from outsiders by their recognition of it. While the locals go about their daily lives untroubled by the stench, those who arrive from beyond its borders almost always show some sign of discomfort. It is for this reason that outsiders can meet each other. One's own loyal soldiers cannot go about disguised as fishmongers and fishermen without detection. The drinking-house is uncrowded during the early morning hours; the netters of dawn have not yet barged into the creaky wooden establishment with its lewd sign out front. Two men, cloaked and fidgeting, sit on opposite sides of the table from each other. One by one, the Solars file in, likewise concealed by traveling garb.

Gallius is of course on time and she approaches the twins, bowing to them deeply. She can waste no time this day. Upon her brow her caste mark glows clearly. "I am glad you could come on such short notice," she begins. "Time is running swiftly, and dangers beyond my control have come upon us. The Guild has summoned mercenaries and seeks to shatter the strength of Greyfalls. Worse still, Abyssals draw near, wishing to turn Greyfalls into a Shadowland for their master. We have little time, and there is only one course of action I can see that will help us now. We must prevent Alcis' death." She looks about the place, frowning but swiftly returning to business. "The only way I can see this being possible is to remove her from the city, thus making her death unnecessary in the plans of the Guild and the Abyssals. This also affords her more safety."

The twins look at each other, then back at the war-leader. The sorcerer - distinguished primarily by his mien of tranquility - speaks at last. "You realize the chaos that such an act would bring, of course. We are disgraced, but at least known to the guards and captains. And we are loyal to Alcis Katsura, it is true. We are also loyal to our homeland, the Blessed Realm. And how will they see us if we cooperate with monsters?"

"You know as well as any that what has already befallen leaves a black mark against you with the Realm," answers Gallius softly. "Only in helping me save Alcis can it be set right. I care nothing of the Realm, but I will not stand by and watch a noble heart be slain by filth." For a moment she clenches her fists, but her tone is not strained as she goes on, "Alcis is important, too important for this. If there is to be any future for Greyfalls to stand on its own, she must live. I need your help in this."

The warrior is next to speak. "What do you know of noble hearts," he demands angrily. "You called for the people to divide their loyalties, you now no doubt starve our citizens..." He is silenced as his brother raises a restraining hand to his shoulder. The sorcerer then speaks, calm as any ocean. "I am Naro, of the House of Ledaal. This is my brother Kano. We have other names, by which we travel at times. We honor our commander, but there is no honor in standing in rags as our home is plundered. It is a difficult thing you ask."

"We speak of honor, but we also must speak of compassion and love. Do you hold your personal honor above your duty to the people you are ment to defend? To your commander? Chaos will happen when Alcis is gone, be she dead or escaped. If she die, then the knights of the Dead may swallow your kingdom, or the Guild move in like vultures." Chi-Yosh's eyes meet Naro. "If you help us, you can prepare to fill Alcis during this time. If you do nothing, both of you may fall in defending her. Weigh the best for the city you protect, then see if your shoulders may bare that weight."

Smiling at Chi-Yosh's impassioned plea, Marina shakes her head. "We starve nobody, noble sirs. I should know; I'm the one responsible for feeding them. And housing them. Ensuring that their hurts are tended, and their beasts protected from the elements." She sighs, looking around the taproom. "This is my vacation, and it cannot last long. My lieutenants are still in training." She offers a cheerful smile. "I swear, on my honour, we starve none, though I will admit that there are shortages. Feeding large numbers at short notice requires stores we do not fully have."

"It is a difficult thing we do." Explains Ramar, his voice calm and soft, "Yet there can be no dispute of what would befall things, should Alcis be lost to either faction. While we may be at cross-purposes in many things, in this we have a chance to do what is right, to rise above honor and duty, and to protect your commander, to protect your city and those whom you served from falling into the hands of the Deathlords."

Naro smiles grimly. He listens silently, restraining his brother (who clearly has a great deal to say about the situation). "'Drifting upon the river currents _The gentle blossom has no eyes but the stars to weep for it'," he observes to his brother. Kano shakes his head. "'See the failed beauty of the flowers!_ They lie forgotten on the floor as mama prepares their roots for the soup'" Naro frowns, then turns his eyes away. "We will take you as far as Alcis, and if she commands that we kill you, it will be done," he says at last, glancing at Kano for approval. The warrior nods his head in agreement.

"So be it," says Gallius. "The chill dawn comes _The river runs golden_ The blood of men stains the grass" she adds softly. "It is time."

There is silence from Ramar as he listens to the brother's poetic argument. When they are finished, and the decision made, "Then let it be said that good is done this day. That despite the directions our paths may take us, for this moment we share the same Road, and our journey down it will not soon be forgotten. Lead the way." A breath, "And... thank you."

Though a bit morbid in the doing, it is not a difficult matter for the Solars to acquire the uniforms of the Realm's soldiers, as this is the ruse that Naro believes will be most successful. Kano is smoldering with resentment and anger at something, though he is disciplined enough to reveal no hint of its cause or focus. Nevertheless, his love for and trust in his brother is evident in every action, and Naro respects his sibling's role in every decision they have made before the party thusfar. The warrior keeps his temper, and seven soldiers march toward the towering doors of Greyfalls. Yana agrees to stay behind, and with her bow she is prepared to pick off soldiers on the walls, should the matter come to such a disagreeable outcome.

The twins are met at the door, and recognized by the guards immediately. Their story of a recon patrol returning to report is accepted, and the gates ponderously creak open. The afternoon sun shines down, smiling on five faces as the Solars enter the city of the enemy.

And so seven soldiers pass through the front gate and into Greyfalls that afternoon. The shadows cast by the Sun give the Solars a path to follow, one that winds out of the view of watchful eyes, and through the city as it prepares its defenses. They walk, heads bowed in respect as they approach the Citadel wherein Alcis awaits them. As they approach the doors and the Twins prepare to give their story, the Solars can only hope that they will arrive in time.

The river of falsehood floats the party all the way to the inner gates of the citadel, where they are greeted as a matter of course. These guardsmen remember Gallius from her initial arrival, although recent stories and heavy gossip have altered that memory to cast the woman as a blazing firebrand of hell, ordering her troops to march to their deaths. Thus, they waver until the very last, as Naro wields his persuasive tongue as agilely as his brother has been observed using his daiklave. Into the citadel the seven finally march, and up the stairs. It will be only minutes at most before they encounter the major-domo, who will almost assuredly remember Gallius.

Alcis Katsura can be found in her war-room. She is surrounded by soldiers and attendants, almost a dozen in number. The plotting of the imminent siege is a thing of great import. Her major-domo recognized Gallius, of course, and the Solars had the time and forethought to strip out of their borrowed uniforms - such an appearance would be distasteful now, and in any event the party has arrived. It would be pointless to question how, except as a detail of security.

Stepping forward, Marina sweeps a low curtsey, before rising once more, a troubled look on her visage. "Greetings, Alcis. We come, with the aid of these two fine young men, for we are much worried about your safety. May we have a few moments to put our case to you, under the eyes but not the ears of your retainers?"

The commander appraises the newcomers coolly, then flashes a silent gesture of dismissal to those around her. They nod understandingly, stepping away into the corridors that lead elsewhere in the tower. "Calm words cannot be heard. A scream can be," she says, confidently. "I welcome your company." She nods as well to the twins, smiling. "It is good to have you both back again." Each fidgets nervously, but neither say anything.

Marina nods. "Indeed. Well, let me introduce my friends, then, quietly, as you suggest." Turning a little, each Solar is presented to Alvis, leaving Gallius to the very end. "We come to you, Lady, with a tale but a few days old. A tale that puts you in mortal danger." She shrugs, a little. "Danger may come as no surprise, Lady Alcis, but when we heard the quadrant from which these threats came ... A warning is the least we could do, and silence would damn us to a life where honour failed to exist." Ater pausing a moment, Marina goes on to explain her own role in the provenance of the refugees, and the tale that Yana has brought.

"I see," murmurs Alcis. "You sense some danger, or you would not have attempted to reach me by sorcery, and now you come in person. Well..." She steps forward, clasping both hands behind her back, walking slowly about the room. "It is our habit to have a sorcerer here in the citadel, employing countermagic against all strange comers. He who came was revealed quickly, and left peaceably. As far as we know.. though he proposed peace with me, an alliance between the city and his master."

Gallius' caste mark bursts into a brilliant light. "There is no peace with the shadow, Lady Alcis, as all well know. They only treat with the dead, who are to be their slaves." She steps forward, "I have come as I promised, but it now is clear to me that I have few ways to know that you are yourself. I would be much relieved, Lady Alcis, if you could prove that the woman I admire is not dead."

"There is no illusion, no glamour or sorcery known, that can obscure or conceal the mark of Exaltation, it is said." Alcis speaks softly, her own Caste Mark springing to life upon her brow. "Even the emissary of the dead bears one, I am told, though I did not see it."

Gallius smiles, "So it is said." She meets Alcis' eyes and says, "Do you really believe you are safe here? The assassins of the Guild are persistant, and few escape them. I have come to save you, if you will allow me, for your life is entwined with the fate of this city. Greyfalls will need you, Lady Alcis, no matter what happens in this battle. You are meant to lead these people, none are better fit for it. And yet I cannot save you here in this city."

"And my city will not be safe without me," Alcis replies, coolly. "I am the one hope, and I say this without hubris, for keeping the factions within this city from murdering each other. What would you have me do?"

"I would have you save the future of the city rather than the moment," says Gallius. "Your city will be torn apart if you stay or leave. If you stay here, however, you deny Greyfalls its rightful leader for all time. If you leave, you will survive to return. It is a choice between the easy comfort of honor and the weight of true duty, Lady Alcis. As heir to a throne myself, I know well that it is not so easy a decision as we would like. Ask these men here how they feel?" She nods to the twins deeply. "I believe they want you to live more than a few days."

"'I know the loneliness of leprosy / The river alone will embrace me tonight'" sighs Alcis. The twins say nothing. "If I live, and my city falls, what will I have? No. I cannot accept," she says finally. "Please, respect my wishes."

Marina steps between Gallius and Lady Alcis, daring to touch the lady on the sleeve, hoping to draw her away a little, and to change the tenor of the conversation entirely. "Lady Alcis, I respect your wishes. I also respect the wisdom of my friend, and the tales of the refugees, told and shared as we find housing, bed and board, for them." She looks thoughtful. "As with any court, the factions are no doubt jostling for attention. However, we seek only to protect you for a short time; a week, perhaps, at most. Can we not negotiate a truce for, say, a single sevenday?"

Looking thoughtful, the woman shakes her head at last. She has at least given the suggestion the consideration it merits. "I'm sorry, but I cannot be spared from the defense of the city even for that long."

Marina looks surprised, and visibly disappointed. "Your city is so poorly defended, Lady, that were you to fall in the first skirmish, the city would fall with you?"

Gallius turns away from the discussion with Alcis. She speaks softly to Naro, "Will you help me save Alcis?" she asks quietly, "You have to know that is she stays she will die, and it will have nothing to do with honorable battle. Do you not care for her at all?" The last words are delivered in angry frustration.

"I--" Naro's comment is cut short, as his brother suddenly turns, flashing his arm out. He catches something in his hand, a long knife - one identical to the knife Marina was given by Valon, one that marks the wielder as an assassin of the Guild. A shadow moves in the stairwell, as a scream goes up. A moment later the herding of feet can be heard, and several voices as well - "They've betrayed Alcis! Kill them!"

Turning immediately to a small table, Chi-Yosh hefts it into the air. As the door bursts open, his body rolls to kick the table square in it's center. It flies into the onrushing men, knocking the first two to the ground beneath it's might. The men behind rush over the two, to be met with the swing of a chair. A sword is thrust, and caught and twisted within the legs of the chair and yanked into the direction of an oncoming mace. The swordsman is disarmed, and for his loss he is afforded a kick to the jaw, sending him into his fellow.

Davron grimaces. "Dammit. If the Guild can get this far, Alcis, you aren't safe here. We are _moving!_" And with that, he turns to face the door, glowing Essence swirling about him as he chants the words of sorcery while Chi-Yosh occupies the first few defenders. Just as the press of people threatens to overwhelm the Su'Katan, Davron completes the shaping, and the stone floor is coated with the glittering sheen of slick ice.

Leaping into action, Gallius rushes forward. She says simply, "I fear, my Lady, that this is terribly abrupt, but given the circumstances.." And with that, she grabs Alcis, throwing her over her shoulder and turning around to shout, "Let's move!" She also bursts into a glorious light, hoping to send terror into the hearts of those who are rushing forward foolishly. Then again, since most of them are painting the floor with their butts, it's probably not all that necessary.

As the ice is made to bare, Chi-Yosh pushes, kicks and otherwise escorts the fumbling throng from the door. His steps are much more at ease, letting him charge forward and glide chair-armed ram into fumbling soldiers on his path to the downward stairwell.

"We need to leave now. Alcis, we're going with you, and as it happens, you're going where we're going. Let's all get there in one piece yes?" With that, Ramar is down the hallway, Essence flying invisibly in front of him, seeking out the faint telltale signs of traps and telling his eyes what they might otherwise have missed. Even as he runs, the Soldiers begin sliding, first on their feet. They begin to wobble to and fro, and some even manage to move in the direction they meant to move into. There is a brilliant looking backflip as one of the soldiers is sent flying backward by that one false step. The ending is poor of course, but... dominoes on ice is an interesting game to watch played.

Chi-Yosh is in time to meet the soldiers charging up the downward stairwell. One glance at the wall and ceiling with it's rice paper holdings suggests one thing. Hefting the chair, he waits until the first two guardsmen are close enough before he hurls the furniture. The first three duck, the step beneath one of them letting lose a 'click'. Their comrads behind are not so lucky. One man takes the seat in the chest, falling back and knocking the two behind him down. As the three stand up, a steel rod sweeps down from above, cracking the frontsmen in the ribs and sending them and the third careening down the stairs.

As more soldiers try helplessly to catch the fleeing Solars, Ramar's footsteps carry him down the hall, his body a blurred streak that disappears down the hallway. As the others run past, they will note pressure plates pried open and spikes waiting to shoot out of the ceiling quite clearly marked by slashes of Ramar's sword.

Davron's bowstring sings as he does his best to keep the soldiers at bay while the group of Exalted flee down the corridor. The barrage of arrows is not nearly as effective as it might be, as more often than not their blunt tips simply glance right off the soldiers' armor, but Davron clearly feels that, on this occasion, the metaphorical points he is making will eventually be felt more keenly than steel points would be.

There are two muffled groans heard coming from the door leading up to the roof, and as Sunlight streams through it, the now unconscious bodies of the two guardsmen who remained behind are cast inside. The altogether familiar sound of the airship's engines powering up can be heard, with the resonating hum cracking through the air as Essence lends the ship the power to move it's massive frame. A Western Wind caresses the rooftops, sending Ramar's cloak fluttering as he waits patiently, a smirk on his face. "What took you guys so long?" he asks, after the others board. As he awaits an answer, the ship separates itself from the roof, picking up speed rapidly as it sails the skies above Greyfalls, outmaneuvering what defenses they manage to bring to bear against the ship.

As the airship lifts off, the twins and Marina stand on the top of the citadel roof, observing it go. They have scant seconds to enjoy the sight before soldiers begin crowding up the stairs to the roof. Together the brothers form a barricade in front of Marina, twin anima banners flaring into brilliant light. The soldiers of the Realm, instinct overriding anger, cower before their Dragon-Blooded masters, and after a few seconds, order seems restored. Kano holds out the knife, bloodied by the passage over the palm of his hand. "This was thrown by an assassin of the Guild! These people are not the enemy!" he says, forcefully, his voice carrying a hard note of command. He starts to wobble a bit, then adds in a weaker voice. ".. Probably poisoned, too. Bloody Guild.." And with that he falls to the floor of the parapet.
