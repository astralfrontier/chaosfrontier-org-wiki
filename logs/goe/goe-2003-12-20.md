# Gods of Eden 2003-12-20

Gallius hasn't spared any expense on guarding Alcis. The main issue is keeping Alcis from running back and getting herself killed in a pointless demonstration of courage. Gallius entrusted this task to her best men. Or in this case, women. An odd pairing, but Lady Yuri and Rumika seemed to like each other and are also more than just capable. Adding Bloody Axe was an afterthought, showing some of that Roleyn humor that Gallius secretly enjoys. In any case, Lady Gallius is returning from a long talk some of the more outspoken men and women of Greyfalls and as she enters looks more than a touch weary.

Rumika takes this as her chance to dismiss herself from a pointless but pleasant conversation with Yuri. She politely bows to both Yuri and Alcis, then arches a brow at Gallius, snorting. Later she'll have to set the record straight with that irritable woman. Alcis wasn't at all what she had hoped. Just another military type! Bah! Gallius hides her grin quite well, knowing that concessions will make up for the offended solar's feelings, but only after the task is done.

Alcis shifts position on her seat, consisting mainly of blankets draped over boxes. The cellar isn't much, but it's a more honorable place than prison would be, and exits are quite limited. That Alcis, an Earth Aspect, hasn't chosen to take advantage of her nearness to her affinity element is a point that has been debated among her captors and hosts, but for now the woman seems content to calmly wait out her fate, whatever it may ultimately be. "Welcome back," she says politely enough.

"I haven't forgotten you, Lady Alcis," says Gallius, sounding and looking troubled. "I've thought about you all day, and your people. I would like you to take a walk with me and help me find the answer to my questions. I believe I know what is best for you and for the people of Greyfalls, but the only one who can convince me is you."

The woman rises carefully, stretching for a few seconds to work out the kinks. It's apparent that she's not accustomed to a life of waiting and sitting. "I can hardly refuse such a polite invitation," she replies softly, following her visitor out.

Gallius nods to Alcis and turns to lead her from her 'room'. "I find myself ever in a difficult position," begins Gallius. "For my heart and my mind are ever at odds. Concerning you as much as anything else. Since I first saw you I believed I could count on you to be just and fair and to tell me the truth of things. I have heard but one side of an argument as of late, and that leaves me incapable of understanding my way through what must be." Gallius winds her way through the bustle that the refugees have created, heading away from the city. "My mind told me that the Guild's interests in this battle might turn to benefit my cause. However, my heart knows that I cannot stand by and watch noble people die when I might save them. That is why you are here, against your wishes. I hope some day you may forgive me, but if not it is a small price to pay." Gallius continues, for she has much on her mind.

"I see in you the future of these people, Lady Alcis," says Gallius. "Unless I have judged poorly, you are the one that should lead these people when the Realm departs. There shall be no extended occupation, I believe. I am still seeking ways, but I think soon we will discover a means to end this stalemate swiftly, and with as little death as possible." The Lady says abruptly, "Tell me of the Nuri. Tell me why they and the people of Greyfalls would treat each other so poorly."

"The Nuri are from the East," the war-leader replies softly. Her feelings lie in wait, hiding behind the mask of neutrality in her voice, as she recites soothing fact alone. "Almost nine centuries ago, they settled here. When the Great Contagion came, they were some of the first people to re-settle the lands here. Many of those lands were claimed by the people who lived in and around Greyfalls. But there were so few people.. the people here, the twin tribes and the city-dwellers together, took the Nuri as slaves or workers for the fields. They worked the land while the city people prospered inside their walls. Many of the people of this village have Nuri blood in their veins."

"So that explains it," murmurs Gallius softly. "Then it seems it is wisest to divide them after this is over. I will not abide more of the same. The people of Greyfalls wronged them and were in turn wronged. It ends. The Nuri shall be protected when the time comes, save those who are the most violent. I will at least bring justice." Gallius sighs quietly, "I know you are furious, and I admire and appreciate your ability to hold it in-check. I cannot think of any way to convince you of my concern for you, but perhaps I can find a way to make you understand that your place is here, where many of your people are gathered. You feel they are as important as your army, I believe."

"The Nuri would gladly retreat with the Realm, should it depart from Greyfalls," observes Alcis as she walks. "They know that without the patronage of the Realm, they have no strength here." She says nothing of the other matter, trusting her companion to lead the way, walking with her measured footfalls, holding her dignity about her like a coat against freezing winds.

"I will offer them other options that may seem sweeter," says Gallius. "A place where they will be greatly appreciated and welcomed. From what I have heard they are skilled in trade and bold. They need not cling to the apron straps of the realm." The Lady winds her way towards a familiar spot. It has become known as 'her tree', and it is where Jin-nu can often be found, as on this day, surrounded by children. They sit spellbound, listening to the golden unicorn spin her tales of the eastern forests. Gallius hangs back, not wishing to interrupt, "This is where I go when I need to remind myself that good things will come. The future is strang and wondrous. I wanted you to be alive to see it, Lady Alcis."

"What would you do, Gallius, if the future you saw was one you could not bear?" asks Alcis softly. "If this grand plan of yours, this great sense of justice you feel, were taken away by someone yet stronger?"

"My sense of justice cannot be taken away, Lady Alcis," says Gallius. "It may be opposed, yes, even by those stronger than I am. For the Empress was stronger than I. Much stronger. And yet it would change nothing. The truth is not different today than it was before. Greyfalls deserves to be free, Lady Alcis. I have been sent here to see that it is done. I will let neither the Guild nor the Realm nor the Coalition of Rivers prevent it. Should the cause seem lost, I shall seek another way to bring about what must be." She studies the children and Jin-nu, shaking her head, "There is much pain, much sadness in the future. Whether I can bear it or not is no longer relevant. I have a duty now, and if it costs me my life and soul, so be it. If even one person lives free in the light who had before been wandering in the darkness, than it was well-spent."

"Freedom is relative," remarks Alcis calmly. "Free peoples have lived quietly in their valleys and cities. Free peoples have also overrun the world, brought chaos and disorder, taken slaves, salted fields. Some people need to be guided. Others need to be leashed."

"Perhaps," says Gallius. "But it is our job to correct them when they fall into folley, I think. We were chosen for a reason, it just seems that so many have forgotten that being exalted is not simply a gift, but a duty. There is a price to be paid, and we owe it to all who have not our strength." She smiles, asking, "Do you think that we anathema are what you were told we were?"

"I think that you have come to my city, taken me away from where I am needed most, and now plan the division of it to suit yourselves," says Alcis, showing for the first time some real fire. "I do not think you are demons. I think you are conquerers."

"If I felt your presence there was safe, Lady Alcis, I'd have left you there. I think it was clear, however, that your death would have come swiftly had we not taken you away," answers Gallius. She remains calm, sounding sad and tired. "And I plan the division as the people of Greyfalls wish it to be. Well, for the most part. They want the Nuri to be stripped of all their possessions and turned out with naught but the clothes on their back. I would rather not let them be destroyed. As for the conquering, well. I fear it may hurt my pride, but the presence of my cousins and I has not had a signifigant effect. Between the Lunars and the Coalition and the Guild, Greyfalls' fate was sealed before any of them knew I existed."

"I hear nothing to prove me wrong," she replies harshly. "I hear that you wish for my people to be safe. This much I have seen with my own eyes, and I do not doubt it. But as for the rest.. someone must rule in the city, if it remains standing. Who will that be?"

"You, if you are willing, and if the people listen to my counsel," answers Gallius. "My task is not done, and it is not time for me to take up any crown, not even that which is mine by birth. I believe with my death the right to any throne in this realm was lost. The time will come when the great armies must be formed, for there are enemies which must be fought. The servants of the Deathlords and the Fair Folk will certainly require my attention before long. I will do what I may for Greyfalls, but I cannot be their Queen, even if they wished it."

Alcis stays silent. Then she laughs at this, unable to speak for several seconds. "Then... you come to overthrow the Realm's garrison here, so that you may.. put its commander on a throne in Greyfalls?" she asks after she's managed to recover.

"You find this amusing?" asks Gallius. "Thousands are dying, most of them for nothing they understand. If the will of the people of Greyfalls is to have you as their leader and to have the Nuri leave, it will be worth it. I do not come to destroy, but to build, Lady Alcis. I do not like death, and the glory of battle grows pale when you comfort a child who wishes to know why his father is gone. The quest given to me is a difficult one. I must milk joy from a river of tears."

"These fair words would have been better spoken to the Confederation army, to have them turn back," grates Alcis. "Or is it that you hate all that you do not control?" She slumps down, leaning against the wall of a building near the tree, pulling her knees up. "Yes, I am angry. I don't know how to judge anything you say."

"I do not hate many things," answers Gallius. "And if there were no armies here, I would not be heeded, I would have been slain. Or would Lady Alcis have saved the life of the anathema, though she came begging only that the people of Greyfalls be given the right to choose whom they should follow? I think none could have saved me." She sighs quietly, admitting, "I cannot say anything more than what I feel and believe and hope, Lady Alcis. I will do all I can to protect your people through this battle, but I cannot see a way to prevent it. I fear my lack of talent will cost many lives." She quietly adds, "I could have used you as a bargaining chip in an attempt to gain control of the forces, but.. I am selfish and stubborn. I do not trust the Coalition of Rivers to protect you, nor to help establish you as a leader in the Greyfalls to come. If the people ask you to lead them, Lady Alcis, will you answer their call?"

"Like you, I have been called demon by those I seek to protect," says Alcis with a faint smile. Her equitable mood is starting to return. "Extremists and malcontents in the city have seen me as a tool of oppression. And at the end of the day, I was forced to pass judgement on some - and renew the bad beliefs of their followers - and do all I could to save others from the hatred of their own fellow citizens. If I were asked to lead, I would, because of my love. But.. it is not a burden I carried lightly."

"If you are willing, then I have hope for the city once more," says Gallius. She does not smile, though, but only seems more tired. "I will have to speak with the Nuri somehow. I do not know how I can manage it, now. Perhaps I might send messages to them, but.. no. That will only put them at risk. No, my plans shall have to wait. For now, I can only cut off any thoughts of harsh reprisals among the people here. I must find a way to drive the Realm away and not destroy the walls of Greyfalls, Lady Alcis. Or, barring that, to find a way to swiftly win and to do damage that can swiftly be repaired. There is just so much to do, and I doubt any of it will prove quick or easy."

"I have spared no effort in making my home a difficult objective," says Alcis with a sly smile. She shifts about, but remains seated. "Tell me this, at least. Why must the Realm be driven out?"

"Because I do not think they will allow the people of Greyfalls to rule themselves," answers Gallius. "And because they wish to kill me and my kin. Part of the duties I inherited was to tell people the truth about the past and to stop the spreading lies about the servants of the Unconquered Sun. We are not demons, we do not deserve to be hunted like animals. Until the Realm stops this, I must work against them. And yet I appreciate much of what they do in protecting the people from the spreading shadow. I do what I do because I am not yet strong enough to accomplish my goals any other way."

"And yet you will rule in the place of the Realm," observes the Dragon-Blooded with a slight smirk. "The Nuri will do this. The people will do that. I do not say - yet - that the legends are wrong, that you are not a threat to the world. I know what it is that the Realm has done. I know very little about what you and your kind have done, in return. Perhaps I stand in a place of ignorance."

"Then let me tell you what I do know of the past, and what I see in the future, Lady Alcis, and perhaps you will better understand what is meant to be," says Gallius. "Before the rise of the Realm, the Celestial Exalted ruled creation, standing above men and above the Dragon-Blooded alike. As kings and queens they grew proud, forgetting themselves and angering the Lord Helios. He turned his face from them and the Dragon-Blooded tore them down, punishing them for their sins. This tumultuous time lead to the rise of the Realm. Because of the threat the terrestrial exalted saw in the other chosen ones, it was decided that The Hunt must be made, and until the disappearance of the Empress, little changed, my kind were slaughtered and tormented wherever they might be found. With her vanishing, though, the Realm started to weaken. And now Lord Helios has remembered his children again and is calling upon us to restore the world, bringing truth and order to the land again."

"Our turn now, hmm?" is Alcis flat summation, after digesting this for silent seconds. "Our legends are, as I'm sure you can imagine, quite different. But let us say for the moment that what you say comes to pass. The Realm is destroyed. Do you have the power to hold back the Fair Folk and the other horrors that sprang upon us in the Contagion? Can you keep the peace between warring nations, as we did? The throne you seek to sit on is still stained in blood."

Gallius does not answer that just yet, going on. "This time will be different. This time we learn our lesson, for we are no different than the Nuri and the commonfolk of Greyfalls. If we seek ever to avenge our wrongs, we will always fail. But that is not why we are here. That is not what Lord Helios demands of us. The world is horribly unbalanced, the spirits wither away, their purpose lost, while others grow proud, seeking to dominate men. I wish to restore what was, only this time the Solars must understand that our power exists only to serve the mortals, not to dominate them. We are meant to bring peace, to force men to live with each other rather than at the expense of their cousins. I would not destroy the Realm, but rather change what it is. If it will stop killing my people and give us fair consideration, the wounds of the past will be forgotten. Everyone relies on us, Lady Alcis. We cannot betray them by fighting amongst ourselves for the rest of time."

"Then let us see what happens," says Alcis, calmly. "Tell me what would happen, if I were to get up and begin walking back toward the city, right now."

"Hope would fade for Greyfalls, but my quest would remain," answers Gallius. She sighs, "I truly hope you will not go. I fear the people here will lose hope if you return. I want you to at least speak with them once, first. If you do return, I will send guards to protect you on your way, if it is your wish. I cannot assure you of safety when you return there."

"Do you think that my safety is what I value most?" asks Alcis softly. "Do you think I would not die in the defense of my home?"

"I know you value other things more," answers Gallius. "But I believe you should understand how important you are. Your life is worth a great deal. Without you, I do not see how Greyfalls can be restored after this mess is finished. I imagine this means nothing now, but I had hoped that someday we might be friends. I suppose it is too late for that, but pain and the loss of the ideal must be borne if it will help the people survive."

"A bargaining chip I am, then," says Alcis faintly. "Well. I suppose there are worse fates." She rises slowly from her seat, brushing herself off. "Let us see what you accomplish for the people I hold dear. Then it will be time to speak of friendship."

"I think you misunderstand me, but if you will speak with your people and defend your life, it does not matter," says Gallius. "As for me, I wish to end this swiftly in the best way that can be achieved. The rest of Creation has not been idle while I've tarried here, and my duties are only just beginning."

Alcis says nothing, but her eyes widen after a moment as something in her line of vision catches her attention. She takes a pair of hesitant steps forward, frowning.

"Something troubles you, Lady Alcis?" asks a voice, one that seems strangely familiar to Gallius. Its owner is well-built man, a Southlands soldier by the look of him and probably a mercenary. His skin is darkened by the sun, and he bears himself with a hint of nobility uncommon indeed among the sell-swords of the Threshold. "Lady Gallius," he adds, inclining his head politely.

"You were the man who saved my life, aren't you," the Dragon-Blooded says. "You took an arrow for me, ten years ago." The soldier smiles faintly. "I am honored to be remembered."

Gallius watches closely, saying nothing herself. She looks to Jin-nu, who is still entertaining children, though it seems most of them have decided to use the unicorn as a napping site. Only a few of the eldest remain awake, asking questions and occasionally darting around under the watchful eyes of the wylding. It's merely old habit that causes her to ready herself for conflict. It has become natural, now. Who can rest when assassins and servants of Deathlords may be about, wearing any guise that suits them?

The soldier pats his shoulder gently and smiles. "It seems we were destined to meet again," he says. To Gallius he then salutes smartly. "There have been questions and rumors about the Lady Alcis," he reports. "Some of the refugees from the city wish to have it confirmed or denied that she is held prisoner, or remains here, or is here at all. I've been sent with this message."

"She is not a prisoner," says Gallius. "She may come or go as she pleases, with the understanding that should she leave we will wish to guard her way back to the walls of her city or wherever she might wish to go." Lady Gallis sighs softly, rubbing the bridge of her nose and frowning in thought.

---

Gallius has spent another day negotiating and planning. Not for war, but for peace. At the moment, though, she has herself settled next to Jin-nu, by the tree that she can often be found at. With the two are several children, all of them napping on the soft wylding. Gallius does not sleep, of course, but remains lost in thought and worry.

It is some time before Gallius is aware that her circlemate is there. Seated by Jin-nu, the Su'Katan is content with Jin-nu. The unicorn had been offered an apple at first, afterwards the pair had simply made a game of facial motions and the shift of body this way or that. Gallius needn't be distracted from her current thoughts.

Gallius sighs, mulling over the puzzle of Greyfalls again and again. "Fair Folk.. Realm.. Guild.. Deathlords.." The words are whispered softly, and each is weighed in her mind. "If only we could remove just one of these problems and make it an asset." She sighs and shakes her head. Finally she turns to Chi-Yosh and says, "I've run this through my head a thousand times, but I can think of nothing better than I have done thus far. I simply lack the strength to avoid this war and achieve our goals."

"We look to the past to learn for the future. If there is nothing you can learn that you should have done, then look to what your enemies have done. With that, we can see what to do the next time, to prevent their strenghts with our own." Chi-Yosh affords a smile to the Zenith. "There is nothing we can do but go forward. So, what is crucial for us next?"

"The Nuri and the commoners must be separated after the war is handled," says Gallius. "I think Lady Alcis shall accept the leadership of the city, if the people will it. I believe they will listen to my advice and select her. The Nuri will be offered a place to dwell in Roleyn, they shall rule themselves, provided they pay the taxes of the king who shall defend them and pledge not to cause strife. I think they would be very welcome, for large areas lie barren where people once dwelt."

Chi-Yosh folds hands over his lap. "That is how all should go. Plan for any bumps in this road. And realize that this will not matter if we fail." A slow inward breath. "It is sad, but truth. What faction within this melting pot of war has you the most concerned, Gallius?"

"The ones I imagine I have overlooked," answers Gallius. "I feel like something has been overlooked, but I do not know how I can find it now. The commoners and Nuri are enough. Ridding us of the Realm will be an aid, but the Guild is going to cause us trouble, I am certain." She shrugs it off, though, "We can do only what we can, I suppose."

Chi-Yosh says, "Exactly." The man's eyes drift over the children. "My biggest concern is the Deathlords' servants. If we win or fail, life will continue for the people here. Yet if the Abyssals have their way, darkness will prevail, and their lives and deaths will be squandered. They are a threat to all. They are not a part of the battle, and may be anyone."

"True," replies Gallius. "But I am not strong enough to detect and defeat them just yet. The key lies in learning the ways of sorcery, I believe. I have little time, but it looks like we will all need this talent sooner or later."

Chi-Yosh has been considering that. While it is not his strenght, it is a capability which he can agree is important. A talent for emergencies. "Agreed." A moment of silence. "The Coalition of Rivers has those with sorcery. If they believed the threat of the Abyssals were as prominent as it is, do you think they would help?"

Gallius pauses to consider, finally admitting, "I don't know much of the Coalition, my friend. They are a many headed creature that I cannot quite decide is friend, foe, or indifferent. They might help, but many of them might see us as demons to be destroyed. I honestly am not sure we are ready to trust each other just yet. They might be rather afraid of us." She smiles suddenly, "It would be worth working at though, if you are willing to try."

"From the Coalition's point of view, the decision may be hard. The demons which seek to help them, or the demons which seek to take their prize from them." Chi-Yosh's own smile is bittersweet. "But I will try, if it might distract you from your worrying."

"Any attempt to restore what is meant to be helps," says Gallius. "I need to speak with the general, in any case. I may have stumbled upon a way to help end this war without killing everyone along the way." She smiles, "It all hinges on making a large weapon fire just once. Perhaps it could work even if it misses. One shot is all I need, though. Assuming we can get it built. It will take very careful crafting."

Chi-Yosh eases up to his feet, and offers down an arm to the Roleyn heir. He might only hope that the transaction will go well between they and the Confederation, for Galliu's sake among them all. "Then come, and we will see what we might."

Gallius takes the offered arm. "It just occurred to me.. Davron might help see to it that this device will work well enough. I envision building a siege weapon not with men, but with warstriders. I want to make it so large that one shot from it could crush a large tower. With such a thing against them, surely the forces of the Realm will except our terms, don't you think?"

Chi-Yosh looks surprised. "Assuming something that size could work. And you could find something to fire from it. There is no telling if Greyfalls will back down. How many shots from such a mighty thing will test how stubborn the head of their garrison is."

"I'm not sure it will work, Chi-Yosh," admits Gallius. "I want to use it force them to surrender, rather than actually using it for the damage it might inflict. I have no idea where we might find the shot for it, but I imagine we can come up with something."

Chi-Yosh nods, and starts walking from the clearing. "First let us see if building it shall happen, before worrying if it will succeed."

---

The encampment of the Confederation of Rivers is a bustling, enormous thing with supply trains coming in, messagers running from tent to tent, and a general anxious discomfort. The pair of Exalts ride in, halting at the edge of the camp by a small squadron of guardsmen.

Time passes, as the institutional paranoia leaps from heart to heart and mind to mind in the encampment, settling back to sleep fitfully. Under guard, the duo are escorted towards a tent, where five men and seven women are gathered, discussing matters of war. The pair are announced, and the dozen figures nod, continuing their talk for a time. Finally they rise, almost as one, to greet their patiently-waiting guests

Gallius slips from the back of Jin-nu. She holds herself well, though her eyes betray some clear signs of exhaustion. She will follow the guards and wait patiently to be noticed. When the eyes turn her way, she offers a small bow, "Good evening. We know you are busy, and so will take up very little of your time. My business is official, and my friend has questions that might be answered by those in your command." She turns to Chi-Yosh for a moment, before going on to explain her task, "I wish to propose a shortcut in this war. It may or may not work, but if it does not fail, many lives shall be saved." She trails off into silence, leaving time for Chi-Yosh to speak. Lady Gallius need not introduce herself, most of those here know her appearance well, by now.

"By now, you all should have heard that two Abyssals have wormed their way into this conflict." Chi-Yosh watches the faces of the war council before continuing. "Thorns is proof enough what they can and will do. They are under the guise of fallen men, seeking to infiltrate the Capitol, or to seize the land at a crucial moment. If they succeed, everyone loses. I ask that we try to find them and drive them out before this can be allowed. Can any sorcerer be spared for the task of flushing them out?"

"And how would you propose that they be flushed out," one woman asks carefully. "Think you that we are able to breach the city's defenses at will to investigate slain soldiers roaming about?"

Chi-Yosh can only reply humbly, "I know not the way of sorcery. I do not know all of the possible usage of the arts. But now that their presence is known, the goal and intention, and the spell used, is there a way, if we work together, that we may prevent a Shadowland from swallowing Greyfalls?"

"The city will not become a shadowland without wholesale slaughter," observes another of those assembled, speaking calmly. "A shadowland is not simply something you take from your pocket and drape over a city. It is not an easy thing to create."

Chi-Yosh, while feeling foolish, merely nods. "Thank you for calming my fears. I though the potential threat worth bringing to your attention." The warrior then turns towards Gallius, letting her take the floor.

Gallius pats Chi-Yosh's shoulder softly. She had thought he came to ask something else, but it matters not right now. "I came to ask for the assistance of your warstriders. I am working on plans to construct something that may, even if it is not quite effective, end this battle swiftly. You have seen the great weapons my people use, much like your own, they hurl great stones over a large distance. They are made by men with tools that mortal craftsmen employ with skill and ease. I wish to enlarge the design, and with the guidance of my best workers and perhaps one of my circlemates, create a truly frightening weapon. The kind of device that need fire but once to force the Realm to reconsider its position. It may fail, but as we are simply waiting about, it seems wise to give it a try."

To this the twelve give no immediate answer. Instead they gather together, whispering and discussing amongst themselves. Finally one woman speaks. "We have no immediate pilots for the machines captured from the Realm. Secure enough Hearthstones to power them, and you may use them for whatever you see fit. This task has been attempted in the past and has always failed." A few eyes show signs of dissent, but none speak up.

"That will have to suffice, then," says Gallius. Find stones, huh? Well, at least she has permission to fail, anyway. "We have used enough of your time. Thank you." She offers another bow, then turns and goes. Where is she going to find stones at this point? And pilots who are up to this challenge?

Chi-Yosh smiles to himself as he offers homage to the council, then follows behind Gallius. At the very least, the circle has two stones among them. Three, were Marina with them at the moment. Now at least some worries may be placed to rest, and all new ones be added.

"I have no idea how we're ever going to achieve this," Gallius admits, slipping onto Jin-nu's back. "Perhaps we have something they did not. Or maybe a few somethings. The favor of Helios, the aid of Valon, the wisdom of the Master, and a craftsman who may even be skilled enough to handle the clumsiness of some men taking their first steps in a 'strider." She laughs softly, letting Jin-nu lead the way back to the refugee camp.
