# Gods of Eden 2004-01-02

It is a few minutes before sunrise, the skies are illuminated now, moving from the dark inky hue of midnight, to the lighter hue that preceeds the Sun's first peek over the horizon. The world seems asleep, or at least at rest. The refugees from Greyfalls are no different, sleeping peacefully, though in their wake they've left a somewhat harried Ramar, who is stealing a few minutes of time for himself, perched atop a high hill that overlooks the city. In the cool morning's breeze, his cloak flutters. "And so, we survive to see another day..."

Gallius has been up already for at least an hour, perhaps more. Even for a Solar the lack of sleep is telling, but she conceals it as best she can. She notices Ramar up in his perch as she sends off some errand-runners and alters her course, making her way up to him quickly, thanks to Jin-nu's timely arrival.

"It seems I'm not the only one who has lost sleep these past few days. If indeed, you ever do sleep," Ramar has a warm smile for both Gallius and Jin-nu. "Good morning. To you both. What has you stirring so early, as I take it you're not out to see the sunrise?"

"The sunrise is lovely," says Gallius softly. "Yet the sunrise is not the reason I rise. I am trying my best to manage things in Marina's absence, but I'm wearing thin from it. Her skills are needed here, and I fear the one we took is not so eager to help manage things. I do sleep, though, Ramar." Jin-nu snorts softly, murmuring, "Not near enough."

"Waking to a new day is always lovely, whether or not you can see the sun. Some days, though, it is nice to find some time where you have neither worries nor cares. Even if it's only for a minute or two." Ramar smiles, "I have been doing my best to help manage things in Marina's absence. I think I understand a good deal more on how you have things set up. Why should Alcis wish to help manage things? She's a captive." Ramar chuckles at Jin-nu, "Fear not, Lady Jin-nu, we'll see to it that she gets enough sleep. Lest she tire herself out and sleep through the siege..." He looks up at Gallius, smile doing little to hide the worry in his eyes.

"Alcis is no captive," answers Gallius. "If she wishes to leave, she may, to the ruin of all her people." The lady does not notice the look of her friend, but instead stares off into the horizon, watching for the sunrise. "The light of Helios will be my strength, and it will be enough. We must do his will, Ramar, no matter the cost."

"Yes, and I'm sure she has been made aware that if she leaves it is to the ruin of her people. So she stays for their good, and not hers, a captive yes, but not one held by any physical force." Ramar returns his gaze to the sunrise, watching as a patch of light blue spreads, leaping from the horizon slowly. "I am aware, Lady, and I know you will be well. I was merely jesting with Jin-nu." A pause, as the light bends across the sky, driving back the lingering night. "I'm scared."

"There is no need to fear," answers Gallius. "There is nothing to fear, now. Not since the day I was reborn have I had a valid fear. Now I have cast it all away. You cannot be both afraid and utterly faithful, I've found. Everything will be done correctly." She smiles warmly and leans against Jin-nu, letting the horse support her as the light of the sun slowly drives back the dark of night. "What would scare you, Ramar, here on the brink of a new world?"

"The days to come. It will not be long now before we assault the walls of Greyfalls. I've thought on it, perhaps too much. On the battle that is to follow." Ramar stands on his toes, then settles back on his feet, "I have never been in one before. I've fought before... but never in a manner such as this. It scares me."

Gallius slips away from Jin-nu, moving forward to put an arm around Ramar carefully. "Ramar, we have seen death before. But do you remember at Yu-Shan? The children of Gaia were there.. the good do not die, but are rewarded with another life in a wondrous and strange world. There are no fair folk, no dragon-blooded, no abyssals. It's free of all such fears, though it is still a world of struggles, it is a better lot they find there than here. That is my understanding, now. Some may fall, but they need not fear, for there is another life after this."

"It doesn't mean I am in any hurry to shuffle off of this mortal coil. I have much to do in the world, much joy to bring to others... yet I am not as afraid of dying, passing into the great beyond, as I am of failing here. Of not winning a victory, or causing those I fight beside to die, of fighting for the wrong reasons, of killing when there may be a better way, of questioning myself, when action is called for..." He laughs, "Of talking you to death."

Gallius laughs softly and shakes her head, "Ramar worries far too much. My dear friend, you really must not let doubt gnaw at your heart. You are Chosen of Helios. You are what he wishes. You will do what needs to be done just by being as you are. Do not be troubled. If you wish for counsel, my door is always open. As long as you do not mind finding me in varying states of undress." She laughs again, her smile more honest than ever before. "The sun is rising!" Gallius cries, raising a hand to salute the first beams of light to fall upon the hill.

Ramar bows his head at the rising Sun, lifting his eyes to watch the disc climb higher and higher past the horizon, waking the world with it's presence. He laughs, "Then I shall not doubt myself, nor be scared. I suppose the anticipation of it isn't helping matters much, things are often worse than one imagines." He raises an eyebrow though, "But were I to continue to seek your counsel, and find you in your varied states... what would Valon have to say? Or your husband? Or your father?" A grin spreads on his face, "I've enough trouble as it is..."

"I fear that the only husband I have now is the Will of Helios, Ramar," answers Gallius. "The one I was to marry will have to understand that everything has changed, save my feelings for him. But I cannot be the wife he would wish. I have a duty now that is more important than any lesser joys." She lets out a sigh, somehow untroubled by this, "But it is hard to say. Perhaps Casus is braver than I think. Maybe even now he will desire his Gallius and pursue her. What then shall I do, I wonder?" The lady laughs and turns around, tilting her head and saying plainly, "And what does Valon have the right to say? Until he stakes a clear claim to my heart, he must hold his tongue. I imagine all his words are just in fun, Ramar."

"Feel free to imagine what you will, Gallius..." responds Ramar. "Your Casus may well choose to pursue his Gallius, and that's where the real trouble starts. Suppose he fights off hordes of demons simply to win a single kiss... no no, it's impossible to compete with that. As for our good friend Valon, well, it's not his tongue I'm worried about..."

Gallius grins, "So many men after my heart! What ever can a girl do with such worthy heroes pursuing her?" She turns back to the sun, "Perhaps I shall marry, perhaps not. Any who would be with me must understand, though, that my heart belongs first to another."

"I'm not sure... nor am I sure I would count two or three -depending on whether or not you count Ma-Ha-Suchi as after your heart, I can't tell, he may simply wish to feast on it- as 'so many' Gallius. After all, we can't have your head swelling out of its helmet now can we..." Ramar glances skyward, watching the Sun, with a playful smirk on his face. He says, rather more sincerely now, "I believe that any who would be with you will understand, or they'd not be with you in the first place."

"We will see. Lord Helios is my first love, and the people he has placed in my care come next," says Gallius. "Somewhere in there I imagine there might be room for a husband, but we'll see. I have good enough friends to make up for the loss, at least." She playfully adds, "And isn't Ramar also after fair lady's heart? After I granted you a fine viewing, too. I should be rather embarassed if you were not at least slightly interested."

"Well, you will see, I am not certain that it would benefit my continued health and well being to concern myself with the love affairs of others." Ramar laughs, "However, I imagine that your heart is at least as big as the Sun's." He keeps his gaze fixed on the sky, "And Ramar's thoughts one way or the other are something neither here nor there, though I have to wonder at why you would be embarassed? My opinion can't matter that much."

Ramar says, "Besides, the grass has yet to grow from the sky, and the sea is not flowing into the mountain tops..."

"It matters to those who care for you, dreamer," answers Gallius. "And even a woman who is more than half steel likes to be remembered that some desire her softness. Or what is left of it." She looks down to the city, "Soon they will wake, and I must be among them. They need us too much, Ramar. For now, we must simply aid them, but soon we will be able to teach them to walk on their own."

"More than half steel?" Ramar teases, "That is not what I would gather from what I saw... but then I must not have been paying attention terribly well. Battle concerns and all."

Gallius laughs loudly, tilting her head as she walks up to Ramar. "Well, at least you do admit to having an eye. Perhaps I will have to arrange a second viewing? Jin-nu could call you at the right time and then you would get to be more sure just how much of me is still soft and smooth." She considers him carefully and adds, "You know, after the second viewing, I am supposed to see you, as well. You aren't shy, are you Ramar?" One might think she's actually serious.

"Two eyes, in fact," counters Ramar, although he has a somewhat far-off look to his eyes when Gallius walks closer, "And they see more than most might think. Ways the world might be." He shakes his head, and turns to face Gallius, "To arrange a second viewing you say? But why in the world would I wish to spoil what few Illusions I have left. If I wished to see something more than half-steel I'd find a suit of armor and stare at it."

Gallius raises an eyebrow, "Oh very well. A pity, I so rarely get to dress for such occasions. Only Casus has ever viewed me twice. You snuck in what might be a first viewing, but only if we were in a rush to elope," explains the heir to Roleyn. She can't help but enjoy the teasing. "I'm glad you are here, Ramar. I really need this. It helps me remember that somewhere under the armor part of me wishes to be nothing more than a woman," she says, her tone much more serious.

"I see," explains Ramar, "Or rather I won't see. It is likely better this way. You are saved your viewing, if you were supposed to see me, and your imagination will serve you better than reality, no doubt." A grin, "Were we in a rush to elope? I wasn't sure. I always thought that there would be more loping." Ramar smiles softly, "Then I am glad to provide what is needed. And to remind you of that which we all need to remember every once in a while." His tone matches Gallius, though the teasing is picked up again, "I feel useful Gallius, you're going to spoil me this way you know."

"I hope so, Ramar," she answers. "If we are to carry so much weight on our shoulders, we ought to at least give ourselves a little time for fun. I don't want to wear myself away forever without a laugh and a smile." Gallius stretches and shakes her head, "We're all a little bit crazy, aren't we?"

"You are right Gallius, and I'm glad to see that you realize this. Thank you for pointing it out." Ramar considers her words, "I'm not sure I would say that..." Two beats pass, "It's more that we're all a good deal crazy. Why do you ask?"

"Because we're seriously talking about conquering the entire world as if it were a foregone conclusion," replies Gallius. "And yet in my heart, I know it is. It's a long path, but it is as certain as the rising of the Sun. And it shall be no less irresistable."

"Perhaps not conquering, changing it, certainly." Ramar smiles, "And it is but one path we walk in life, one of many that all lead down a long road, one which we all walk down." He stretches, "I look forward to this journey, you know."

Gallius hmmss, "We will see. Much will have to be conquered, though, Ramar. Surely the Abyssals and Fair Folk will not respond to negotiations. Much of the Realm, too." The lady sighs deeply and smiles, "I want to see many things before this journey ends, Ramar."

Ramar nods, "Much will, yet battle and negotiations are but two of the many things we will use. I for one hope we get to see some of the ancient buildings, and to explore new places." He laughs, "And here I am, prattling on again. Do not wory Gallius there are many things to see, and this journey never ends..."

"Never? I imagine for some it will not. For me, I dearly hope it will end one day," she replies. "The road is long even for that, but I cannot bear to imagine I must walk it endlessly. Someday I too shall have my reward, Ramar." Gallius lets out a soft sigh and returns Jin-nu's side, stroking the horse's flank. "Our road shall be as long as it shall be, and no longer," answers Jin-nu softly.

"I misspeak, Gallius. I mean to say that the journey goes on, even though the paths we walk come to their ends. To say that once you have walked your road, and found your well-earned reward that is a journey in and of itself. One of rest. Perhaps I should simply quit while I am ahead." Ramar shuts up, glancing anywhere else for the time being.

Gallius smiles and shakes her head, walking away from Jin-nu to stand closer to Ramar again. She considers him in silence, then moves swiftly to kiss him on the cheek. "Your heart will ever be the best part of you, Ramar. Do not fear for mis-steps if they come as a price for it. Like it or not, you are a good man."

"Thank you Gallius. I'm flattered." Ramar smiles, "I'd be careful not to spread the news around though... I have a reputation to maintain." A grin, "Well not really, however I've always wished to say that."

"You will have one sooner or later, Ramar," replies Gallius. "But I think we have work to do, and the day is not going to wait for us. And I think Jin-nu promised to look after the children again while their mothers fetch water." The horse nods and smiles, "It's fun, and they are so eager to hear of the woods of my home."

"Of course," replies Ramar, adding, "May the Sun watch over and bless you this day. If you wish my help with matters, let me know." He looks to Jin-nu, "I'm sure that many are eager to hear your stories, and yet you never seem to share any with me. I've three apples for three stories when this siege is said and done." He straightens up, and turns to face the day, "Thank you for talking with me Gallius. I feel better about the days to come."

"What will be will be the will of Lord Helios," replies Gallius. "This is his story, he has simply chosen this chapter to be ours to write on his behalf. Do not fear. I will send for you at noon and we will talk then. I want someone to help Greyfalls get rid of their excess canons. I will talk to you then, my friend." She swings easily onto the back of Jin-nu and the two dart off, the sudden burst of speed more than enough to make up for lost time, it would seem.
