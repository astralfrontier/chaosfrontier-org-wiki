# Gods of Eden 2004-01-07

Within the city of Greyfalls, control has always been a tenuous and fragile thing. Leading "the people" is an exercise in diplomacy and discretion; as the people to be governed have come from all corners of Creation. The matter is complicated in that the city's masters have always been among the outsiders from their own society. The Realm sends the politically unpopular or dangerous to Greyfalls, and in this far-off stronghold these exiles have plotted their return to power and influence, or taken to lording it over the hapless inhabitants of the city.

The citizens' representative, Tauri, has done his best. He and his lieutenants work grudgingly but efficiently with the leaders of the Nuri, the Realm's favored people, who are hated by the peoples who founded Greyfalls to begin with. Above them are the Realm's civil administration - the bureaucrats of the Thousand Scales, who manage the assets of the city. Other players include ambitious officers within the military garrison attached to the city, the major-domo of the Empress' palace, and even the representative of the Immaculate Order who tends to the spiritual needs of the people.

Taking advantage of the old, human, need to air one's grievances to the fullest, Marina starts her pacification campaign - designed to keep the city from revolting in Alcis' absence - by arranging a number of open courts where people can bring their complaints and grievances to her attention. Knowing, too, that some people prefer to make their points in private, she leaves the open courts to the mornings, and closed courts to the afternoon. Carefully, she maneauvers to keep the courts as short as possible, without making this utterly obvious, so that the grievance gathering procedures last as long as she can stretch them out. In all these manoeuverings, the aid of the twins is invaluable, giving her the moral heft she needs.

There is, of course, the matter of the dam. Cutting off the water supply has doomed any chance of getting supplies to the city, and overland shipments will be hampered or prevented by the presence of the Confederation army. Word has come from the Linowan, who will be attempting to run supplies to the city despite the presence of the army nearby. It is suspected, but unproven, that some of the military and civilian leaders of the Realm have made other arrangements as well, or have their own private reserves of supplies, or both, and there is a strong call to have these private assets brought out for the use of the public.

Kano and Naro, for their part, are privately of the opinion that this is just good policy, and they praise the foresight of anyone who might actually possess such resources. Publically, the military's policy is to seize any food, water, medicine or other essentials in times of "dire need" - whose definition is left vague.

For now, Marina listens to the call, but refuses to act on it. Matters have not, yet, become truly desperate and - as she explains to all - a fair and equitable solution requires the consideration of all sides.

Aside from that is the issue of the evacuation. Tauri is behind it, the City Father of Greyfalls himself supports it, but the military is loathe to do anything more than carefully trickle civilians outside the walls. On the one hand, they see it as a prime opportunity to send spies or agents provocateur into the refugee encampment managed by the Solars. On the other hand, there is always the risk of deserters, or the possibility that a few spies will sneak in during the mass exodus of citizens. The major-domo of the Summer Palace has further made invitations to the military and civilian leadership to dine at the Palace itself, which the twins privately consider a trap.

Again, Marina decides to leave the issue of evacuation at its current slow dribble, confident that Gallius and the armies will keep the walls from falling. The invitation is a trickier problem; for a day she feigns illness - a mere inflammation of the throat, harmless but enough to keep her from visiting anyone - before she decides to bite the bullet. Counter invitations are issued for a banquet she will host, the evening after the major domo's event.

A few of the otherwise-loyal Realm representatives have taken umbrage at the interference of an "outsider"; Marina's task has been very difficult, and she's made very little head-way compared to what she might have been capable of in times of peace. Nevertheless no blood has been shed, which in itself is a miracle in Greyfalls under the circumstances. The invitation is replied to, of course, though it is made clear that were the Empress really here, the situation would be far more uncomfortable for those who had refused her hospitality. The Empress has disappeared before, and even after five years, there are those who believe she will return. Only recently has a ceremonial funeral for her been held on the Blessed Isle; she hangs like a hungry ghost over the entire city, and it is with this mood that the major-domo and others respond to Marina's invitation.

The event goes cordially; enemies eye each other across the table. Like the icy river in a winter afternoon's sun, polite and frosty words are exchanged. The casual flow of social niceties is interrupted only at the very end of the evening. It seems the Guild's assassin was still in the city, and still active, and he strikes.

The calm of the evening is broken by a flashing knife that carries its message of death through the torch-lit air of the banquet hall, directly toward Marina. Kano, seated next to her, is ready. As the Solar ducks, instinctively following the dictates of her demigod's heritage and a primal sense of danger, the Fire-Aspect warrior's hand closes around a leg of lamb and raises it to block the path of the blade. He's caught such a weapon before, and has no taste for poison. At the same time, two of his associates, apparently primed for this, fling their own knives. There's a gurgling sound, and the hidden assassin falls, brought down. Everybody breathes out a sigh of relief. Once it's been demonstrated that no further acts of aggression are forthcoming, conversation drifts to safer matters, though the question hangs silently in the air: was the attack staged by Marina herself, or was it legitimate?

---

The meeting point is set, the time made sure. The speed of the airship is going to be tested, indeed. In the dark of night the solars choose to appear, flying towards the city at top speed. This is mostly a distraction, however, drawing all the eyes of Greyfalls away from the true source of motion. A lone volo comes from the opposite direction, stopping only to pick up Marina and then to move swiftly away. Before the city can raise a defense both volo and airship turn hastily away. The entire episode lasts only a minute, and then the panicked city is left behind.

Once well out of sight of the city, Davron circles around for the arranged rendezvous with the airship, dropping off Marina safely aboard and stowing the volo. A quick status update to Ramar - that nothing unusual happened - and the airship is on its way back to Gallius' makeshift headquarters.

Yana, who has been absent much of the time, is waiting with news when Davron and friends return. She's already spoken with Gallius, and now she summarizes for the new arrivals. "The Guild has an army of mercenaries waiting," she explains, in a sober voice. "I found out from my contact. They counted on being able to murder the leader or leaders of the city's military, wait for the Confederation to make a quick strike to take advantage of the confusion, then bring in a counter-force to restore order in the city and repel the Confederation. They're playing both sides, and their final goal is to keep the city of Greyfalls a trading post for the Realm. Who runs it doesn't matter, just as long as the port remains."

Turning to Alcis, Marina makes her own report, explaining the steps she undertook to keep the City pacified for the time being.

Gallius frowns thoughtfully, for once her map is set aside and all worries about the battle are secondary. "So now we have another force to deal with, but at least this one bases its loyalty solely on the weight of silver. And it is fortunate that Greyfalls itself won't fall apart too hastily from the inside." The warleader sighs, "This is indeed a serious trouble. They were annoying enough when they were simply sending assassins out, but this.. this demands more serious attention. I do not think it wise to attempt war against this new force. There may be a better means of victory available to us."

Marina nods, soberly, at Gallius, and ponders offering to broker a trade agreement.

Chi-Yosh stands up. "If the Guild seeks to fatten their purses, then that is where we should strike to dissuade them. Their mercenaries and assassins seek money and gain for this attack; if we can find out more about the payment they will receive, we could intercept it. If they are to be payed before the official attack, that is."

Yana frowns. "The mercenaries would be waiting for their payment, and their final orders. I'm not exactly sure how they'd be delivered, but I can take a few guesses. But they won't move until those things arrive. If they're from Nexus, not the Five Dragons themselves could get those men to march before they received their wages."

"I would like to hear of these guesses, Yana," says Gallius softly. "We could use that money to help relieve the city of Greyfalls after this is all ended." She smiles and adds, "And it might help us pay off our current allies should they think to stay around and make a claim to the city, as well. This may work out well for everyone. That would almost enough to make me forgive the Guild. Almost." But clearly not quite.

"Well, the sky-ships that you now hold are rare, but it's possible the Guild would risk one for this," muses Yana. "That's the fastest way to deliver the goods, and it's pretty easy to get one past a rival army's blockades."

"Well, then it is simple enough," says Gallius. "We find this shipment and attack it. We will then take whatever it is they are paying with and stow it away for later use." The lady turns thoughtfully to Alcis, but then looks away again. "Yana, can you tell us anything more? We must stop the shipment. Even though these mercenaries may well deserve it many times over, I'd rather not have to kill them all."

Marina grins impishly. "While we raid - or better yet, intercept - their payments, can we leave a few forged orders behind? The kind that make it obvious to the dimmest of mercenaries that they're intended as sacrificial victims, first to die, least likely to survive?"

"Well....." Yana hems and haws. The youthful Solar seems somehow reticent about the matter, but finally comes to a resolution, and speaks. "It could be done. We could trace the Guild operatives in the area, if we had the help of that girl.. umm, Rabby was it? If the assassin was successful, he'd have to tell his masters about it, right? And that's the signal they'd be waiting for, to tell their forces to move forward. If we could find those people, we could do something about it."

"There is another way," says Alcis, who has been listening quietly. "You could kill me. There are witnesses in plenty around the village; they would corroborate the story."

Chi-Yosh shakes his head. "That would not do well for Greyfalls in the aftermath of the battle." After a moment, "But if someone like you were attacked, and feigned death..."

"I suppose a feigned assassination is a tolerable solution," says Gallius, who is clearly reigning her temper in. "If it can be arranged. And swiftly. We cannot sit here forever. Greyfalls is waiting to erupt."

Arranging the demise of a Dragon-Blooded leader is an interesting sort of affair. Even in death, the demigods of the Realm demand attention to detail. Specifically, a plausible occasion for the assassination must be found; word must be sent to Greyfalls early, so that Kano and Naro can spread the word that the "successful assassination" is Guild propaganda in the wake of their failed attempt on Marina's life. Things may become more unstable than usual, but that's like counting the loss of the leather pouch after finding one's jade has been stolen.

And on the appointed day, shouts and cries spring up from the inn where Alcis stays. Trusted soldiers, hand-picked by Gallius and reviewed by Marina, were in their assigned places, and they respond as good, loyal soldiers ought to. The grief shown by the strange leaders of those soldiers due to loss of their prisoner_hostage_guest is believable and convincing. Yana escapes, carrying with her as proof a hand bearing the proper signet ring on one finger - the product of Davron's craftsmanship, worn on a hand taken from an enemy spy who has no further need of it.

In due course, Yana's crafty observation of affairs has apparently netted results. Through a messenger, she dispatches word back to her fellow Solars - a day, a map with a course outlined, and a note reading "By Air. Sorry, but I don't think it'll be safe to be seen around you again for awhile. - Yana." For herself, Alcis must stay out of sight, at least until the mercenary army has been routed by some device, and she is fed and tended to by only the most trusted of her captors.
