# Gods of Eden 2004-01-11

The sun is already high in the horizon, leaving a palette of blues and whites painted across the sky. A warm wind flies from the South, bringing with it clouds that may rain upon the world below. Rushing directly against the winds, and soaring through the groundward fog clouds is the now Solar owned airship, its point angled downwards as Ramar urges it up... _If I time it just right, we should catch them from below and behind..._ He mutters soothing words to the ship, as though urging it towards their destination... the guild's caravan. "Alright then..." says Ramar, unable to hide the grin of anticipation, "Be ready, with any luck, we'll catch them unawares... just remember what happened last time. Grappling hooks at the ready?"

The Guild airship is egg-shaped, at least on the bottom, and has a flat top deck. It is painted blue and white, and were one on the ground, it might be very difficult to see the craft overhead, especially at a high altitude on a cloudy day. For those who know what they seek, however, the movement of men on the deck, and the distinctive hue of wood at heights no tree ought to exist is a clear sign.

Davron nods to Ramar, his golden bow drawn back, a barbed hook taking the place of his usual arrows. The edges of the hook are streamlined, to ease its passage through the air. "Just give the word," he says, measuring the distance.

Gallius stands near Jin-nu, her arms crossed. "There it is," she murmurs softly. Without a further word she leaps onto Jin-nu's back, readying herself for battle. "Time to move into position," she says confidently.

Chi-Yosh is anchored into the volo. While its' wings gleam with essence, the light rolls down the Exalt's body in a tender glow. His kamas are ready, eyes poised above, all ready the thrum of dawning battle speeding his heart.

"Alright then..." says Ramar, his voice quavering as the moment draws nearer. The airship breaks through the clouds, moving swiftly, too swiftly almost. "Hang on everyone..." With little dip in speed, the airship shifts, reversing course as it's brought up alongside of the egg-shaped Guildship. "NOW!" Shouts Ramar as they close in, hair whipping in the wind, bringing the Solars just within range... the egg-shaped ship looks so pretty, sitting there in the sky...

Several of the men on deck shout, and there's a general commotion as the Guild's guards rush to their stations. Bows and arrows are readied, and a hail of arrows begins to rush at the quartet of pirates and their fast-approaching vessel.

The volo's wings glimmer as the Su'Katan rises upwards. The birdlike contraption strides to the edge before it leaps, the wings held closed, a glittering shell around Chi-Yosh as he goes over the edge of the ship. Down he tumbles before wings spread, snatching the air and sweeping forward, beneath the Guild's ship. He sweeps up over the starboard side, dropping from the Volo's grasp to fall in a roll across the deck. Up he comes, kamas first towards the Guilds' guardsmen.

The cresent blade slices clean through a bow and into the armpit of the bowman. Quick, Chi-Yosh twists with the contorting man, bringing his blade around to stab into the shoulder of a started Guildsman. The third is ready, a stout sword unsheathed, but he is distracted as the gasping bowman is tossed into him. He evades to the side, right into Chi-Yosh's sweeping blade.

Davron ignores the arrows whistling around him, narrowing his eyes and taking careful aim. Drawing his energy around him, he sends the grappling hook whistling through the sky to tether the Guild airship securely to our own. Even as the barbed metal flies home, the wings of Davron's volo unfold, and with two strong beats he is airborne, striving for height, winging an arrow at the nearest Guildsman seeking to stay his advance.

From out of thin air, it seems, a group of almost a dozen creatures materialize. The stench of hell accompanies them, and their horrid and hunched-over forms are nothing the mortal world would welcome. They spread their arms and bellow as one, a war-cry of an alien plane, before leaping at the interlopers aboard the Guild vessel.

Even before Ramar calls out Gallius' aura bursts into a brilliant flame. With a cry she urges Jin-nu to charge. Rider and horse move forth and leap skyward, causing a glittering arch to span from ship to ship. With a crash they land upon the deck and Gallius' spear is raised, bearing down upon the demonic forms with the very wrath of Helios.

Gallius' arching swings send three of the demons reeling, their foul blood boiling on the edge of her spear. If anything, the terrible glow about her grows brighter, and Jin-nu charges through them, turning at the edge of the ship, readying for the next terrible charge.

"So... demons is it..." Ramar plants one foot solidly against the deck, propelling his body upwards, seeming to flow through the breeze. As fast as quicksilver, the Solar's feet bound off of the shafts of fired arrows in mid-flight as he races across the volley towards the demonic attackers. His sword glistens as it's brought to bear against one of the demons. He follows through carrying the weight of his blade over his head, planting his feet against the demon as he leaps through the air towards Gallius.

Ramar's sword however, is as a feather, striking against the demon's alien hide. The Solar mutters a curse at his ineffectiveness... and as he tumbles towards the ground, he twists. He brings himself upright, unfortunately it's right in front of one of the arrows...

The arrow bites deep, finding it's way between the layer of Orichalcum resting against Ramar's chest. A dot of red begins spreading against the edge of the arrow.

Chi-Yosh senses the shift in the battle. The demons must be delt with, but with the jerks of their body towards the opening downward, he must act. The Dawn moves like a bolt of golden lightning, two steps before knees bend, sending him into the air. It lands him on the shoulder of a soldier, then a second, before he dives, to land before them. Though even before he falls, the weapon is raking down across one, then he lands, turning into a spin that pours power in a splash across a bleeding hellish wretch. He throws himself backwards, snapping arms in a broad X to dig the blades in fleeing backs.

As Chi-Yosh falls upon the demons, sending their foul ichor spraying in many directions, Ramar has moved in to drive his blade between Chi-Yosh's slash. The demons however move faster than he anticipated. He ducks his head, pushing off the flooring of the ship to avoid the second's attack, jumping high as Essence-Quickened Reflexes carry him out of the path of the demons' blows....

The Erymanthoi rally, pairing off to attack their mortal foes, the Chosen of the Sun. Claws and talons swing wildly; some are felled, or wounded sorely by the flashing blades Chi-Yosh brings to bear. One manages to penetrate the aura of the mounted paladin, but its claws ring off her armor rather than digging deep into flesh. Their only success is with Ramar.

Davron pauses in mid-air, the sun at his back, as the servants of Malfeas swirl into existence below. "So be it," he calls, as his companions engage their infernal foes. "Take this, demons!" His anima swirls around him as his bow bursts into deadly song, raining down upon the blood-apes a shower of arrows that seem to rain down from the Unconquered Sun itself.

The Erymanthoi hear Davron's call, and as they look up, their unearthly cries ring out across the deck of the Guildship as the Arrows of Heaven rain down upon them. Three of them fall to the ground and lay still, slain immediately, but none of them are entirely untouched, save one - the arrow lodges in his pelt, but fails to pierce through to the dark flesh beneath.

Gallius starts off another charge through the demons. With a roar she bears down upon those still alive, her spear flashing at the side of Jin-nu, reaching out greedily at the remaining demons. The horse is hardly content to watch, filled with her own hatred of the demonkind. The terrible point is stretched-out, aiming for the demon who currently is gloating over surviving the arrow storm.

Gallius growls at the demons, this time not charging away, but staying near those left alive, daring them to even try and harm her. Those stricken fall away, their useless bodies sinking to the deck. It is clear from the fire in the eyes of Gallius and Jin-nu that no quarter shall be offered in this melee.

Following in Gallius' wake is Ramar. Though the demon's talons have marked his flesh, he shows little sign of weariness. "Go back to the shadows that spawned you!!" The ship pitches back and forth slowly from the melee, though Ramar is in tune, swaying with the ship, as his blade and body as one dance from demon to demon to demon.

The remaining guardsmen - those conscious and alive - have retreated belowdecks, shouting warnings of the mayhem happening above.

Gallius turns to face two of the remaining demons, her spear blade relieving the first of its head with a violent swing. As the blade comes up in a wide arch Gallius spins it above her head. Seeing another demon move close she thrusts the blade out. The head of her lance is buried in the bowels of the demon, Gallius glares down at the demon, twisting the spear before yanking it clear, leaving the demon's guts to spill out with the last of its life-force.

Everything knows when it is going to die, when the sands of time have ran out. The ape crouches down with a roar of defiance, and hurls itself towards Ramar, planning on taking the wounded man with it. It bounds over the body of another demon, pouncing forth to come down atop the Eclipse with weight and upraised claws, it's palm impaled by a spinning Kama. Ramar is knocked backwards, his place taken by Chi-Yosh, surrounded in a roiling surge of Essence. A two-handed grip is swung at the shoulder, not only taking the ape in the stomach, but sending it backwards in a skidding roll across the ship's deck.

The demon rolls to a stop, unmoving. Jin-nu apparently is going to make extremely sure, and raises a powerful leg, stomping down on the head of the beast with an audible crunch. The horse snorts in disgust, her head turning to study the motionless demons, waiting for any to even consider rising from the dead. Gallius turns her attention to the path that leads below, her mark still glowing, though it almost appears dim next to the affects she already is employing.

Standing there, with a rather stunned look on his face is Ramar, as he finds himself now displaced several feet. His sword, ready to impale that demon, is now pointed towards the hatch. "Remind me to thank you for saving my life when we get through here. They've gone belowdecks," shouts Ramar, as he wastes no time in racing after the soldiers. He nods to Davron, readying his sword as he reaches the hatch leading below. He tosses it open, sword ready to parry any attack that might be sent his way.

Belowdecks, Ramar will find that the soldiers have surrendered their weapons already; they stand at attention, noncombative, with their arms sheathed and stacked neatly in the central corridor of the sky-ship.

The egg-ship is built expressly for sky-travel, it seems; none of the normal accessories necessary to keep a water-borne craft running are present. A steep ladder leads down into the aft end of the ship, and from there a corridor runs the length of the vessel. Another deck can be found below that, built in a similar fashion. It is at the fore of the vessel, on the first belowdeck, that the helmsman's chamber can be found. The door is closed and barricaded; the soldiers seem to be uninterested in giving further trouble.

"I can at least see that you are intelligent. Good. Is this everyone aboard the ship? We'll have no further fighting, if you'll cooperate." Ramar makes certain that the weapons are collected, "Take them aboard the other ship, if we can tie them, tie them. We should perhaps find some way of breaking through the door?" Ramar is at present belowdecks, addressing both the Solars and the soldiers that are down there. His voice is calm and collected, though there is an icy tone as he speaks to the soon to be prisoners.

Davron nods to Ramar, with a coil of rope, and one by one he pinions the soldiers' hands behind their backs - the knots tight enough to ensure their security, but no tighter. Unused to his role as a pirate of the skies, he doesn't attempt to speak with them, but instead simply leads them back up on deck. Above-board, he says to Gallius, "The helm's closed and barred. What'll we do with our friends while we work on opening it up?"

"We should land these ships and leave them here, under guard. I think they will not try anything stupid," she says. "I would hate to make Jin-nu hunt them down and skewer them like pigs." The wylding snorts and says in a hissing voice that sounds far from her normal, "It sounds rather fun, actually." Her eyes glitter as she studies the capties, stamping a foot impatiently.

Chi-Yosh inspects the door. He is no craftsman, who can tell the details of a door and, how it is made, know the weakness. He must look at this like a hammer, and how to simply burst through it. Although he has no Gifts to do so, there must be a way to accomplish the task. Asking Ramar while regarding the wooden portal, "Do you think Davron throwing his weight into the door would uproot it?"

"Your demons are defeated, your men have surrendered. Our ship's cannons outnumber yours, and as we speak we are preparing to open this door. If you open it, and surrender yourself and your ship, you will not be harmed, nor will your men." Ramar knocks against the door, his voice raising to inform the pilot of the current situation. "We can end this peacefully."

The sound of the engine, and the wind rushing past the ship from above, is the only answer Ramar receives.

"Then you leave us little choice." Ramar nods to Chi-Yosh, "We can likely hack through the door. Unless the ship is piloting itself... fetch one of their weapons. An axe if we can find it."

Davron looks at Gallius and Jin-nu coolly, not especially fond of their manner toward the captives. "These men are just doing their jobs. We should just..." he pauses, and raises his head, looking around. After a few moments, he says, "We're not alone. There's something here, unseen."

Chi-Yosh spots a few axes, but ignores them for the moment. Rather then carving their way in alone, the man leaps onto the ladder and up to push his head through the hatch. "Davron! Gallius! Your arms and backs are needed!"

Davron shakes his head at Chi-Yosh. "Not right now. We've got other problems. Get Ramar up here - we may need him to take the helm of our ship."

"Lovely," murmurs Gallius. At least Davron is unwittingly playing perfectly into the good captor/bad captor routine. "We have another problem," she says to Chi-Yosh. 'Can't anything go to plan?' she thinks to herself.

_Well it's like they say. No plan survives contact with the enemy._ Ramar runs up, axe in one hand, sword in the other, he looks to Davron, worried "What do you need? What are these... other problems?"

Gallius moves past Ramar, "All I know is apparently we have a guest. Jin-nu? Come on along, we're going to knock on a door together." With much care, the two head down. "I suppose if we can't take this ship over, we'll have to evacuate everyone and destroy it. It will not escape us," says Gallius softly.

Chi-Yosh darts across to collect his thrown weapon, then back to the hatch. He lands into a crouch on the first belowdeck. If something is still here, ready to appear at any time, then they need every direction protected and watched.

With a loud crushing noise the hooves of Jin-nu start smashing at the door. Again and again they swing and bash against it, sending the strength of the powerful wylding against the work of mortal hands. Gallius moves to pick up the heaviest axe she can find and trades off attacks with her friend.

Ramar heads below, seeking the jade intended for the mercenaries. _Well here are the doors and here are the locks..._ He tries the doors, and shrugs, heading back towards Chi-Yosh and Gallius shaking his head. "All of the doors down there are locked."

Meanwhile, the door to the helm-room breaks into flinders; the iron bars that held it closed have nothing to bar, and pose very little hindrance. The helmsman himself is dressed in the uniform of a sailor, with black, beady eyes and a determined, ruthless expression on his angular face. It's what's in his hand, and what's below that, which give pause to the skyjackers.

The man is bearing a lit stick of ever-burning stone, a peculiar product of sorcery and alchemy, over a rather large keg of something conspicuously marked FIREDUST. "Not another step," he warns, in a low and icy voice.

"Sir," Says Chi-Yosh, lowering his weapons. Even as though he has to watch over Gallius and Jin-nu, "We have a ship of our own, and a way to get to it from a plummeting ship. You do not. Your sacrifice would be honorable, but all that will be lost is the ship, you, and your men standing on the deck. Surrender, and we will lower our weapons."

The pilot's steely glint doesn't waver; he shakes his head once. "The moment this blows, Tia Ting cuts the rope. You'll be stopped too."

Gallius is moving into the room, taking a step in before she notices what the man is doing. She doesn't waste any time, letting the man speak as she charges forward. She knows he'll drop the stone. That's exactly what she is waiting for. With a whistling swing of her spear she attacks the target that is bursting with light like a beacon, so eager to be knocked away. Through her whole body, essence bursts to make her aim true.

The blade of Gallius scythes throgh the air, striking the stone and sending it slamming into the wall. She moves further, raising the tip of her spear and pressing it at the throat of the one whose position has just radically changed. "I wouldn't even think if I were you," she says flatly, waiting for her friends to move in and aid her.

Chi-Yosh's breath is caught in his throat, the captain's dire message delivered seconds before Gallius acts. Though as the stone is struck, he vaults over Jin-nu and scoops up the barrel's top before coming to his feet and slamming it atop the volatile dust.

"Nice move, Chi-Yosh," says Gallius, letting out a sigh. "Maybe now we can get back to the plan?" Jin-nu sighs softly, shaking her head, "Being with you people is going to make me lose my mane!"

"Thank you, I was wondering when someone was going to do something or another. Now then, let's go back shall we? Tell the others to move to the other ship, I'll set it down." Ramar then takes the helm, spending a moment to attune himself to it's ryhtm and rhyme... and then the ship begins to head back to a safe, out-of-the way location, where the cargo transfer can take place. "So remind me again... this was a part of the plan yes?" Ramar grins, after they've landed. "So let's see, that's two different people who like as not know my name and face."

Ramar says, "I'm going to be rather popular one of these days it seems..."

"Well, I think we should set these soldiers down somewhere safe and let them take whatever provisions are here that they will need to survive the trip home," suggests Gallius. She knuckles her back, "And then I have to be spokesman for the Guild. I am afraid we're going to be spending some of our jade immediately, my friends."

"Very well then. Let's help these poor soldiers home. Perhaps we can avoid the inevitable confrontation for a while, and have it occur on our own terms. And non-violently." Ramar smiles, "I am ready to return when you are. If nothing else... we won't be bored anytime soon."

Chi-Yosh simply gazes towards Ramar. Knowing Gallius and her blood-stained spear, he doubts that the confrontation with the Guild will prove anything but painful for someone.

Once the Guild's egg-ship is secured, the two vessels set down on a quiet stretch of caravan-road, and the erstwhile crew of the Guild vessel is left by the edge of the road. "The nearest village is in that direction, about a half-day's walk," says Davron, cutting one soldier free and handing him the knife to free his fellows. "Good luck to you," he adds, launching in his volo and taking the helm of the pyramid-ship, which then lifts off, egg-ship flying in formation beside it, and heads to the north, a cargo of four Solars and erstwhile Guild's jade aboard. The Circle has earned some powerful enemies this day, but they may have also earned Greyfalls' salvation, and that is worth the risk.
