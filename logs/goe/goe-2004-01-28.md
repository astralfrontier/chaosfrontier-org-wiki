# Gods of Eden 2004-01-28

Davron paces back and forth anxiously in the inn's common room. "Where could they be?" he mutters. "What's taking them so long to report back?" Which is not entirely fair - there's hardly been time for Gallius's scouts to even find the slave train, much less report back with any news. "The train was going south... where could they possibly be going?"

Gallius is not at the inn, she is away, managing the last fragments of the victory over Greyfalls. Jin-nu has yet to return with word. It seems she, too is part of the chase, and though Davron may not know it, her paces already are set against those of the Linowans, but who will prove the faster?

"Davron. Perhaps, instead of pacing back and forth and wondering on the news of the scouts, we might go after them..." Ramar pipes up, while watching Davron wear a groove in the floor. "At the very least I can put to use my skill in tracking them for you..." He shrugs, "I simply feel so useless sitting here, watching you suffer."

Chi-Yosh grows restless with Davron's pacing. Ramar, once more, can mirror his thoughts with his tongue. "That would not be wise though, Ramar. We could miss the scouts going the opposite way, and then we would truelly be lost."

Davron pauses in his pacing and turns to Ramar. "We could certainly try. I can show you where I spotted them - although if you can trace their path through the tramplings of tonight's battle, you could probably teach Patient Mantis a trick or two," he says, with a half-hearted smile.

"I do not think I would miss the scouts, Davron... as for finding their trail after the trampling of last night's battle..." Ramar smiles softly, "I imagine that I could. Following them is the real trick. I suppose there is nothing to do but wait then, if you are worried for getting lost..."

The front door bursts open like the cork of some excited bottle, and through it comes an unlikely figure. Rumika strides in, her beauty holding despite the way her hair dangles lank on her shoulders. She wears a pale blouse and slacks, pale pink with some darker reds, where men bled and the water did not wash it easily away. "I'm looking for.." she blurts, then she sees Davron and makes her way over there. "The scouts have sent word back, and they can find nothing, not even a bent blade of grass for a trail," she says.

"Then they do not know what to look for. We should find them. As swiftly as we can. Davron, take me to the place you spotted them. I only hope that we do this in time." Ramar nods towards Rumika, "Hello. We're on our way out, as I'm sure you surmised." Ramar stands and finishes the last of his tea. He sets it down, the leaves floating gently in the bottom of the glass, "Shall we?"

Davron's countenance changes several times in quick succession... surprise first. "Rumika!" he gasps in astonishment. "What brings..." Next, disappointment and despair: "Nothing? Nothing at all?" Finally, determination. "Then we'll have to figure out where they're headed," he says, returning to his pacing - this time not out of impatience, but to collect his thoughts. "The scouts know their job, Ramar and even if they lack your talents, we may have better luck figuring out where they might be going first."

Davron wears a groove in the floor, trying to track his lost cousin's captors with his mind alone. "The Linowans aren't slavers, I know that, so they aren't going home, and that's the wrong way anyway. They certainly aren't going to free them - if they didn't want to hang on to the slaves, they'd have just cut and run and left them in Greyfalls. They must be planning to sell them somewhere."

"Why? When they could be going anywhere, why not simply go from the source? It is worth a look. If we can find nothing, there is nothing stopping us from trying to guess where they have gone..." Ramar shakes his head, "Although, I suppose this is your task to accomplish, and I am merely to offer my advice. Let me know how I might help." He ponders this a moment, "If they were planning on selling them somewhere, I can think of a few places that might spring to mind... perhaps the cities on the SouthEastern Rivers..."

Chi-Yosh unfolds himself from the seat, and readies for the coming trials. They may find the slaves, or no scent, as the scouts have encountered. Either way, much despair will be at hand. "If we are to follow their trail, Ramar, you and I will take a Volo for a closer look at where Davron will spotted them. Davron, you may be able to see them from the deck of a skyship."

Davron nods, coming to a stop. "Then let's go. I'll show you where they started from, and we'll fly south from there. Maybe we'll cross their trail, maybe not." He nods to Ramar. "I'll sail the skyship to keep pace, while you search lower to the ground. I just fear that the speed of the skyship will outpace them - if we go the wrong way, we may miss them entirely."

Rumika wavers slightly on her feet, leaning herself against a chair. "If they truly vanished from all sight of scouts, there is but one answer to how, and I wonder if even your eyes will tell you where they stand," she says softly.

Davron, already moving to the door, stops in his tracks. "What do you mean, Rumika?" he asks, the worry returning to his voice.

"Sorcery, I should imagine." Ramar smiles, "Else they took to the rivers." He sighs, "Then I am useless once more. Rumika, perhaps you might aid where my talents are utterly inept?"

"I fear tracking is no talent of mine," answers Rumika, "But I will come with you and help as I may. Perhaps the answer to all your difficulties, however, is not far away, but near. These people came from Greyfalls, and those there would know some story of where they might go, I imagine."

Ramar says, "Then let us go and ask them. Let us see if we can find what we need with the people, with the blades of grass, with anything. Do we have a plan?"

Through the last swirls of madness Gallius makes her way through rubble and bodies to find the citadel. Looking back over the ruin of war, she lets out a sigh and turns to survey the place. If there should be no guards left, she will pound on the door with a mailed fist, wondering if anyone still lives inside.

The citadel is principally intact. Inside, it remains inviolate, a stark contrast to the scene beyond. And here, the twin Terrestrials, Kano and Naro, can be found amongst their fellows, as concessions to the army of the Confederation are being drafted.

Gallius enters the place and makes her way to the twins. She raises a hand in token of peace as she approaches and waits to be acknowledged.

It takes a few minutes, but the twins disengage from their activities. Naro comes strolling over, moving as easily as a wave in troubled waters, while his brother burns with barely-restrained humiliation and rage behind him, making no effort to conceal his distaste for the new arrival.

"And so we meet again, when all is blackest," says Gallius. "Has Alcis come here yet?" she asks. "I had hoped she would aid you in dealing with.." And here she lowers her voice, "My allies. I am curious of their demands, and how I might help, for my goals were achieved already and I will not stand by and see this proud city broken after so many died to protect it."

"She's performing the tea ceremony for General Nebarr upstairs," replies Naro, easily enough. "If you need to see her, I'll arrange it."

"I see," says Gallius. "She may have some need of me, and so I will remain and do what I may. I have already done some things to speed the recovery of the city, for much damage has been done. I would have come with my friends, but they are seeing to other matters. Perhaps you might know something of a group of Linowans that fled the city?"

The twins look at each other for several moments. Naro shakes his head firmly. "Our Linowan allies retreated from the field before the siege commenced," he states.

Davron looks astonished, and breaks his silence. "But I saw them! I know Linowan garb when I see it, and I saw it that night, leading a train of slaves south, out of the city!"

Gallius looks for a moment confused, "Then.. they were not perhaps Linowans.." She turns to Davron, then to the twins, "What group might have taken many slaves from the city just a few hours past? They move and leave no trace." She turns to Davron, "How many did you see? Just one? Do not forget one who wears other guises and moves about, killing all he wishes!"

Kano shakes his head. "No slaves were taken from this city, unless you have faltered in your protection," he replies, savagely.

"Protection? What do you..." Davron begins, and then his jaw firms up. "I see," he says coldly. "Well, so far as we know, none of our forces have... _stolen_ any slaves from your fair city. Though if the slave guards were not indeed Linowan, they could be on any side, or no side but their own." He sighs. "But no slaves were sent out of the city by order of the Realm, then," he says. It is a statement, not a question.

To this Naro nods, once. No elaboration is necessary.

"Then I fear the search grows very difficult," says Gallius. "An unknown group that moves with no trace. Clearly sorcery is on their side, and so the more mundane methods must fail. But who else is there, now?" She sighs softly, "I fear I can offer no additional aid, then. I hoped to find the truth here."

Davron bows deeply to Kano and Naro, and to Gallius. "Thank you for your help," he says, looking troubled, but being as courteous as he can as he takes his leave. "I must continue the search..."

---

"Even my eyes can find nothing. Let us see if we can find something else to aid us," remarks Ramar, muttering something about not opening his mouth so much again. "Well, as I fear, I may be useless here... however..." There is a brief scratching of finger to dirt, as the bloodied grass parts and the rocks are set down at the edge, designed to direct his energy, his summons over the field. A soft golden and white set of circles form on his forehead as he whispers to the spirits, asking one who watches over this place to come to him, the wind suddenly picking his whisper, sending it flying...

Minutes pass. From out of the ground there can be heard a rumbling, at last, and without warning a geyser of fire-hot water springs forth. It gushes for several seconds, and the gap widens further and further by the moment. Out of the gaping wound in the earth steps a woman with dusky skin, robed in raiments of steam and scalding water. "I am Rains Bring Bounty," she declares, in a smokey voice, examining the two Solars.

Chi-Yosh stands beside Ramar, the golden starburst a banner on his forehead. "Greetings, Rains Bring Bounty, she that nurtures the lands and feeds all. I am Chi-Yosh, Sworn Guardian to the Maze Forest. We ask of you an urgent question. A group of many men, with other mortals bound by chains have passed through here. We suspect they have used sorcery. If you can aid us with any words on this, we will be sure you are thanked."

"They passed by, yes," reports the spirit calmly, smiling. "I am not permitted to say where, but I will say that it was not done with the sorcery of the Exalted. It was done via collusion with my master."

"A greetings to you Rains Bring Bounty." Ramar bows his head, the glow lighting the ground briefly. "May we ask and have the answer to who your master is, great spirit, nurturer of the land?"

"My, aren't we formal," the spirit whispers huskily. "Well, you may ask. I serve the King of Stone Circles, who commands all the lands that men walk on, here in the east. But perhaps you'd rather spend time with me than he."

A chuckle is afforded from Chi-Yosh, who is reminded of another one of water who was less bold and not so steamy as she. "Your offer is appreciated, Rains Bring Bounty. And it might be accepted, were the circumstances different. It may be accepted in the future. But for now, our cause is urgent in finding this group of men."

"I am not sure how I might be informal, certainly it is not my wish to offend..." Ramar shrugs, and smiles towards the smokey spirit. "I do believe that spending time with you would be enjoyable, even preferred to the other choices... but as my friend says, we must track down this group. They have stolen someone dear to a friend's heart. We are trying now to track them."

"Well, then I wish you both bad fortune." The spirit is still smiling, charmingly. "When you face crushing disappointment and can't go on with your hopeless cause, come back and see me again." And with a wink she descends back into the earth.

"Well... that was informative..." muses Ramar, mind racing. "So, I suppose if Davron were here Marina would be the one telling him to remove his foot from his mouth. It might have been an interesting change. Now then, I suppose we may as well go face crushing disappointment and succeed in this hopeless cause."

The flapping of wings can be heard in the distance as Chi-Yosh and Ramar discuss their finding. As the sound draws nearer, it becomes the familiar beat of a volo, and Davron sets down in a flurry of alabaster wings beside them, the machine's arms unlocking. "Have you had any luck?" he says, looking grim. Clearly his own inquiries have been less than fruitful.

Ramar says, "Yes. We have. Though not the sort of luck you would wish. We must find one knowledgeable in the ways of spirits, moreso than I at least, and see what can be learned regarding the King of Stone Circles, who commands all the lands that men walk on here in the East."

Ramar says, "For it is with his aid that the men have evaded our tracking. Not through sorcery."

Chi-Yosh wishes for Gallius. For she is truelly the one with the iron claws of determination and assurance in the power that is the Solar. A part of him dares to call the King of Three Circles, to remind him who is also a King of this land graced by the Sun. Such could not be fruitful, but...

Davron's brow wrinkles. "All the lands that men walk on in the East? A spirit so powerful would not stoop to talk to the likes of any ordinary slave-thieves. Whoever he granted passage to must have powerful allies indeed. And only one such ally can I imagine, that both has the clout deal with the ruling spirits of this land, and trafficks in slaves."

Davron rubs his chin. "Of course, your spirit friend could be overstating the King's importance, or his influence. Or she could've been spinning a tale from whole cloth." He sighs, and reports his own findings. "Kano and Naro knew nothing. The slaves were taken without the knowledge of the Realm, and so they could offer no clues as to where they might have gone."

"Then we shall have to try asking once more." Ramar shakes his head, "I'm sorry Davron. I suppose I should have actually paid attention instead of asking questions. Are spirits forbidden from telling people things? Perhaps..." He returns to the circle, "I shall attempt to summon Rains Bring Bounty again, if you'd like..."

Davron frowns. "Time is of the essence, Ramar. Every moment that passes brings Willow further away from me, and to what terrible fate?" His voice almost breaks for a moment, then he catches himself. "We could spend days working our way through what remains of the Celestial Hierarchy in this parts, and still be no closer to finding them unless we can offer the spirits a higher price than the slavers paid. And if they are indeed with the Guild, there's small chance of that." He shakes his head. "Let us go to the river. Perhaps its spirit will help us once more. Or if he will not or cannot, we will search for them with our own wits and our own abilities."

Ramar nods, "Then with all haste, let us head to the river. You can carry one of us in your volo, and the other can stand atop it. If we return to town we can pick up the rest of the circle and take the airship so... let's go."
