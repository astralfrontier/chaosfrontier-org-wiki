# Gods of Eden 2004-01-31

Even after the battle the pains of war are being felt by many. Before sunrise until well after darkness falls Rumika is aiding where she can in tending the wounded. She is drawn particularly to the youngest of those who were harmed, and though it pains her terribly each time a cloth must drawn over a child's face, she knows this, too, is the way of the world. Life and death will forever struggle for the mastery of time.

Davron is, if anything, more affected by those who are lost than Rumika is. He had hoped that coming to ply his own healing skills amongst the wounded would take his mind off his own troubles, but if anything, it's making things worse. He keeps seeing Willow's face in the faces of the refugees he attends to, and each one that slips away reminds him forcefully that she too is receding from him, mile by mile.

Seeing daylight slowly fade away, Rumika lets out a sigh, knuckling her back. Her anima banner has dimmed to nothing. While she had little to offer magically, somehow seeing her arrayed with the power of the sun gives hope, and often that alone is enough. She moves away from the makeshift clinic, but pauses when she sees Davron trying to give aid. She watches him for a time, but seeing he, too, is exhausted she moves over to him, "We should rest. We have done what we can for now. We too, are in need of sleep, if only for a few hours."

Davron's hands tremble as he wraps a bandage. "I... I don't know if I _can_ sleep, Rumika. I don't know if I dare. I just _know_ that I'll see her in my dreams..." He shakes his head, nodding to a passing medic to take over. "I've got to take my mind off that," he says, closing his eyes tight. "There's nothing I can do right now, until we can catch up with them."

"Then come with me, Davron," says Rumika. "Not all healing is of the body, the greatest afflictions affect only the heart and mind." She will lead him away from the tent, and then away from the city, as well, to some quiet place where the bustling of men is not so near. "I may have something for you to see. It may make you happier to see it."

Davron follows behind in the pre-dawn chill. "I hope so, Rumika," he says softly. "I know I should be glad that Greyfalls is out of the Realm's grasp now, but I've seen so few reasons to be happy this night. Anything that might give me hope..."

"There is still hope," she answers softly. Rumika will settle herself down, putting her back to a small tree that stands alone on the plain, looking rather lonely amidst the flat. "Come sit, and perhaps you will realize your fears are not as terrible you thought. There is darkness and death, but only through them can come day and renewal. The sun shall always rise again."

Davron nods, and sits beside Rumika, his own back to the tree. He still knows not what Rumika has in mind, but will not ask, not yet - rather, he will wait to see.

Rumika settles down and takes a deep breath. For a long time she says nothing, and then she begins to softly chant in the warm speech that is the Forest-Tongue. After a short while the air in front of her shimmers and a strange bright figure begins to take shape, formed seemingly of little wisps of wind. The little shape just watches Rumika at first, sitting in mid air and listening to her chant.

Davron's eyes widen curiously as he regards the figure. "What are you?" he whispers softly, but says little more, content for now to observe what is unfolding before his very eyes...

The little figure, a girl by the look, just notices Davron now it seems, and she darts to the side, hiding on the other side of Rumika. Obviously shy, she looks around the female solar and peers at Davron curiously. Her voice, when she speaks, is like the wind, "Who's he, big sister?" Rumika just smiles, "He's a friend of mine, Leyi." Leyi considers Davron carefully, "Does he want to play?" Rumika laughs softly, "Perhaps later, but I think he's very tired tonight."

Davron, despite his distress, can't help but give a small chuckle himself. "Rumika's right, for now. But..." He grins. "Pleased to meet you, Leyi," he says, inclining his head as if giving a seated bow.

Leyi looks at Davron closely and tilts her head. "His name is Davron, little sister," Rumika says softly. The little figure ahhss and smiles, darting around Rumika's head and moving her hair like a wind. "It's nice to meet you, Mr. Davron." Rumika explains, "Leyi is in the service of the dragon of air, and her job is very important." The little figure nods quickly, whipping around Rumika as if to show off what she can do. Wherever she goes, the wind seems to follow. "But until she grows up a little bit, she can stay close to me and I will play with her and keep bad people away," Rumika says. Leyi settles amongst the strands of Rumika's hair, perching easily there and causing the locks to move this way and that.

Davron blinks at the breezes, and smiles. "You seem a lively one, Leyi. I almost wish I could spare the time..." He slumps against the tree, but the weariness on his face lifts noticeably. Perhaps it's just the smile that does it - he hasn't smiled, really smiled, since sunset the previous day, if not longer.

The little spirit stretches and yawns. She curls up in Rumika's hair, "I'm going to rest now," she says, and then she vanishes once more. Rumika just smiles. "She's such a wonderful child. She is quite new, though. She may have even fallen at Greyfalls." Rumika goes on, "And so you see, even when we pass on, there are things that are wonderful waiting. It can be very difficult, though, being all alone and unsure of yourself. I will look after this little one, and she will help me, too. I wanted you to see that things are not so horrible. There is warmth and love even after the ground takes us back."

Davron nods. "There is indeed. Thank you, Rumika..." he says. "There are indeed wonders in this world worth preserving. After all the pain and suffering I've seen tonight, it's worth so much to be reminded of that."

"Well, maybe I'm fit to help you learn a few things after all," replies Rumika. "Though I must warn you, I fully expect a reward in the end. You will just have to trust that I put the price at a reasonable level." She delivers this all in a teasing tone, but there's still a measure of seriousness in her eyes. "Since you are about to dart off after this captive one, I think it is necessary for me to go with you. In any case, your chase is likely to lead to a place where I wish to come."

Davron meets Rumika's gaze for a few moments. "I think I could use all the help I can get," he says at last, nodding, with a slight, wry smile. "I fear you have the bargaining advantage over me at the moment, Rumika. Right now, I would pay a very high price indeed to see Willow safe." Though, in truth, he holds little fears that Rumika will ask more of him than he would be willing to give, even in better cicrumstances.

"The price may be something that makes you happy, but we shall see," answers Rumika. "A lot of time will pass before it comes to it, in any case. We both have a lot to learn from each other. And paying may indeed be the most straight-forward way to get a friend out of such a mess. Does Willow have any unique talents? And have the scouts any idea where that odd group snuck off to? I do not know a great deal of the situation yet, though Leyi tried. She is still young, and rather shy of some of the more aggressive spirits."

"We still haven't heard anything," answers Davron. "And if what Ramar learned is true, there may be little they'll find. I can't blame Leyi for being wary." He gets up, stretching. "Perhaps the next day will bring counsel. Or perhaps we will not find them until they reach the river, or even afterward." He gazes off into the south. "But we will find them."

"We will. But what then? Are you going to save a friend, or to see justice done upon your enemies?" It is clear that Rumika's question is a very serious one. Not perhaps concerning her opinion of her student, just her understanding of him. "The Unconquered Sun is the source of justice and nobility," she adds softly.

Davron's hand tightens into a fist. "I..." he begins, his voice breaking, tears running down his face. "They stole her, Rumika. Or they bought her from someone who had. I _will_ show them justice. One way or another. They may be too many for me in the here and now... but I will not forget." His eyes close. "I only hope I do not forget what justice _is_."

"In many places what they have done earns death," says Rumika. "And few would fault you for slaying them." She clearly isn't terribly troubled by it, no matter how soft her exterior might seem. "But death is swift and for many an easy escape. Perhaps a reversal is more fit. Did you know that in some lands when a man is doomed to die for justice they will instead hand his life over to those he has wronged and for the rest of his days he must serve them, knowing that at any moment they might slay him justly."

Davron's lips curl slightly. If it's a smile, it's not the sort Davron usually wears. "Tempting..." He pauses for a moment, then puts a hand to his head. "But no. I'd rather not multiply suffering in this world. It will be enough if they are prevented ever from stealing a man, woman, or child from their home again. With six feet of earth, if needs must."

Rumika nods slowly, "Perhaps it is enough, then. The most difficult part of being what you and I are, Davron, is that we have no one to make our decisions for us. We are not children, even if we might be very young. And yet we are no wiser at the start than we were as mortals. We have the same weaknesses, we have the same desires, and they may often turn us from what is righteous."

Davron nods slowly, his shoulders slumping wearily. "If they are the same. I... cannot remember feeling more angry before, more full of rage, than when I saw them taking her away. Except just once... on the day I... the day I had to leave her behind. It's almost as if I'm not myself anymore." He sighs softly. "I'm tired, Rumika, and there's a long journey ahead. Let's go back." He pauses, turning back toward Rumika and letting himself smile, once more. "Don't let me forget about Leyi. I'm looking forward to meeting her again."

Rumika rises and nods, "You won't forget her. She is going to travel with me." The night caste laughs softly, gesturing to her chest, "She sleeps in here. She says the sound of my breath is like a lullaby, she feels safe there. I wish someday to make a great preserve to protect the greatest beauty in all the land from the wicked. I never thought before that I myself could be such a fortress on my own."

Davron laughs, his cheeks coloring a little - or is that just the light of dawn peeking over the horizon. "She is surely safe indeed, then." He bows deeply. "May the preserve of beauty be as safe, when its time comes," he says, as he moves to return to the camp. Perhaps now his dreams will be less troubled... he hopes so. He will need the rest, to face what will come.

"Let's go find a place to rest. But you first. I won't be able to sleep until I see you dozing peacefully, Davron," says Rumika. She will take his hand without asking, and with a laugh lead him away swiftly. "You need to be safe, too," she explains.

Davron's hand trembles slightly, before he clasps Rumika's. "We all do, Rumika," he says, as they walk back. "We all do."
