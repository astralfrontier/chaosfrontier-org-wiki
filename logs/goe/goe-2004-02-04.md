# Gods of Eden 2004-02-04

The provisional government of Greyfalls is being arranged. A three-way balance exists between Tauri, Alcis, and General Saulos Nebarr of Lookshy, and the loyal men and women who follow each one. Tauri distrusts Alcis to an extent, for fear that the Realm's military sparked the siege. Alcis distrusts General Saulos, because of his hand in the systematic conquest of the city she once held high station in. The General distrusts the civilian leadership of the Confederation of Rivers that put him in this position, and which now is caught up with internal debates on the disposition of the city.

The Nuri are fleeing. With the restoration of water traffic imminent, and the good graces of the soldiers who guard their lives fleeting, the tribe is preparing to set sail for their own sake. To most of the citizens of the city, this is all right. For the most part, there has been no looting or rioting, and the re-integration of refugees with those who decided to stay behind is proceeding apace.

In the midst of the proceedings, the Solars have come to an agreement as to their next course of action. Rabby has re-appeared, back from her time spent talking with Non Valon. She seems troubled, but nevertheless she expresses her intention of returning to Nexus with the Solars. "Somebody has to show you around," she insists. And now the _Cloudy Sea_ sits ready for take-off, as dawn comes, and the Solars make their silent prayers to the rising sun for a safe and productive journey.

Though she cannot aid her circle, Gallius will see them off. "Mind yourselves well, and may Helios and Luna smile upon you. I will see that things here stay well, and wait for your return." With this, she returns, trying her best to aid Alcis in forging a bright future for Greyfalls.

Davron takes the helm of the _Cloudy Sea_, the vessel rising into the air and striking a course directly toward Nexus. The vessel cuts swiftly through the skies - the young archer wishes to waste no time, and the routine tasks of sailing help him keep his mind off his worries over Willow. In truth, his impatience to arrive is one of the main reasons he was chosen for the helm - had anyone else taken that responsibility, Davron would surely have spent the duration of the voyage pacing the decks and haranguing the hapless steersman to go faster.

Rumika spends her days on the way to Nexus quietly resting and observing, save for a few hours each day, when her voice rises in song and she dances, joyous simply from the motion itself. At these hours a most odd thing happens, for the figure of a little girl takes shape in air, rippling with each soft-sung word and swirling about, joining the dance. When Rumika finishes she speaks quietly with the little spirit, who smiles and giggles happily, delighted.

In addition to this, Rumika leaves herself available for teaching, should anyone wish it. She is more than willing to share her knowledge, but doesn't force herself on anyone.

Chi-Yosh can be found intertwain with the rigging of the ship, seated upon a beam within the lotus position. The wind whips across his flesh, pulling his hair about behind him in a chestnut flag. Despite the elements raging around him, the Dawn is emersed in stillness, finds himself not there. As the day passes, the only thing which might draw the eye is his hair. It draws the eye to him. The second day, the hair is up. As the sun climbs in the sky, where once the Dawn's shadow had fell on the deck, now there is sunshine.

"Very well then Gallius. Please, try not to get killed. We'll be back soon, if all goes well." Ramar smiles, then boards the vessel, asking Davron to steer the ship. Much of his time will be spent belowdecks, in or near his quarters. The soft singing sound of Essence at work might even be heard once or twice. "I'm glad we could reach this agreement." The same statement is repeated over and over, though the ways in which it's said are as numerous and varied as the flakes of snow falling far to the North. Every now and again, in the mornings and evenings he will poke his head up, and be sociable. During one of those times, he'll stop by to talk with Davron and coincidentally Rumika. "Good evening."

Rumika watches Davron most of all, of course. Seeing him there, day and night, troubles her. She goes to him, reaching out to place a hand gently on his forearm. "We will be there in time," she says. Her dark eyes turn to consider Ramar and she offers what is either a deep nod or a small bow, "Good evening to you."

Ramar smiles, "We will Davron. And once we're there, we shall free the slaves. Perhaps, those who have enslaved them will even learn from their mistakes..." The traveller moves to stand near his circlemate and Rumika. "Good evening Rumika." After a few seconds pause, "We do have a plan right?"

Davron nods to Rumika. His face is placid and calm - only in his eyes can the worry that gnaws at his heart be seen. "I know, Rumika. This ship sails faster than the river. But I want enough time for us to be ready when they arrive." As Ramar enters, Davron nods to him as well. "Good evening to you," he says. "I rather hope we do have a plan..."

"There are people in Nexus who are not friendly with slavers. The laws even prohibit slavery, though there are loopholes. There are many allies we can find there, some willing to fight even a small army," answers Rumika quietly.

"Nexus is a place of many things, perhaps even beings such as ourselves." Above, Chi-Yosh moves through the rigging like a monkey, at ease with the terrain. "There are allies beyond the problem at hand that we may need in the future." Dropping down beside Davron, "We will have time to spare, Davron."

"This I am aware of. I was just wondering if we have steps planned for when we land in Nexus and get a grasp of where things are... to see if perhaps there are other things we should be doing that haven't been mentioned yet." Ramar gives a little shrug, and shifts his weight effortlessly with the sawying ship.

Rumika falls silent, just staring ahead. She lets out a deep breath and smiles. "What will be, will be," she whispers.

Davron seems reassured most of all by Rumika's quiet confidence. "Whatever it takes," he says, turning some of his attention to the helm once more as he corrects for a slight breeze. "I don't have your way with people, Ramar, but I don't doubt that you'll be able to find the help we need. And perhaps, even, the help that needs us, if our abilities are enough to tip the balance from 'willing' to 'able'."

Ramar grins, "You know Davron, if Marina were here, she might tell you that not having my way with people isn't necessarily something one should feel bad about." He chuckles, "However, I shall help you find all the help as can be found. I shall also do my best to harry them, if I might. I think my studies are coming along nicely. In any case, I am returning to my quarters, let me know when we've landed."

Zigzagging over the course of the Mighty Yanaze gives the airborne crew a chance to survey the terrain of the lush lands below. The river itself is properly named; even from the air, there are times when the eye can see nothing but water on any horizon. None of the greater cities are visible from the air, with the course that is taken - for the vessel to pass by even the most barely-inhabited area could cause disaster later on.

So it is that the _Cloudy Sea_ sails serenely toward the city of Nexus, after two days' flight. The prevailing winds are blowing upriver, and so the smell arrives even before the city itself can be seen. The wind is full of odors, sublime and horrid - the stench of meat rotting in the sun, the foul reek of body odor and worse, the delicate aroma of flowers, the musky melange of a thousand perfumes sold by two thousand vendors, the tang of salt carried from those deep-water freighters that manage to make their way up the Yanaze every week from the Inner Sea. It mixes together and intoxicates the senses with its variety.

"Well... it certainly... smells interesting." Ramar pauses a moment on the bow of the ship, relaxing now, revelling in his newfound knowledge. As the scents waft along the prevailing wind, the temptation to let Essence heighten his senses is too great, so it is particularly intriguing to him. He's sniffing, catching the scents, sorting and sifting through them. "There must be... a thousand different scents on the breeze alone..." comments the Solar to no one in particular.

The sounds are next, and the loudest that carry as the sky-ship creeps closer to harbor are the yells of dock-wallopers, junkworkers and the dozen other types of low-grade laborer that are required to keep a port functioning. Beyond, the spires of the city rise into the sky, slung here and there with long chains or draped in snapping banners that blow in the winds. The shape of many of the most prominent buildings and structures stirs a faint familiarity in the hearts of those scholars aboard who've studied the First Age and its cities; echoes the skyline of old Hollow are still preserved, even in the tangled chaos that has built up around it.

As the ship drifts closer to harborage, Rabby approaches Davron at the helm. "You may or may not have realized this," she comments in a low voice. "But there's nobody here who'll stand guard on your ship for free, and nobody who'll jump to stop thieves, without something in return."

"That I have heard," says Rumika. "We will need someone to look after the ship. There are probably various dock guard companies available, though. I fear the fee may well be based on the value of our ship, as well. I hope we have carried a large enough purse for this."

"Very well then," remarks Ramar, regarding the 'guardians' he's managed to drum up. Two mercenaries, and a few dozen dockrats-er-children, who have promised to keep their eyes and ears everywhere. In protection of the ship. "I'm glad we've come to this agreement, and you shall be paid of course. I trust you to keep your words and guard our ship. Thank you very much, it has been a pleasure doing business with you." Ramar smiles, though there's a pained look in his eyes for a brief moment as the breeze picks up and the almost unbearable smell of fish gone bad sucker-punches his nostrils. _It's been ages since I've had to put up with that... strangely enough, reminds me of home._

Chi-Yosh steps onto the dock, and even here at the water front, the city of Nexus is a grand and intimidating place. Even the stay within Nane could not prepare himself for the sheer size of the people, the buildings, the city itself. Having been warned by Rabby not to stare too long at the sites to ignore the cutthroats, he has hidden his power to be poised for such an assault. Which is good, for his attention could never be focused upon his person; the small marvels of carts moving upon rope-like tracks, the sadness of beggers combing through refuse within the ugly alleyways wedged between beautiful architecture, the spectrum of people so different sifting through the streets, shops, and upon the waterways like an explosion of a million cultures.

Rumika steps onto the dock and stretches, letting out a sigh. "The first thing we need to do is find a freedom crier. I don't know if that's the word, but there should be many people out crying about the laws of the land that bar slavery. I'm hoping they will point us in the right direction. Assuming, of course, we find one who can speak a language we know." She smiles, looking over the city, "It is everything I've heard, and more."

Rabby is off the boat, and moving confidently toward the heart of the city proper. It takes a few minutes, and her purpose seems pointless, as all she's doing is muttering random questions to passersby. She returns after a time, grinning. "The Incunabulum has changed a lot," she reports. "Children can't be sold. Adults cannot be enslaved. Indentured servants must be observed smiling at least once a day or they are automatically freed. Umm, nothing about bringing servants into the city, or selling one's own servant."

Davron nods to Rumika, grateful for her show of purpose. "Lead the way," he says, and little more. Even with close companions around him, he feels terribly out of place in this city of cities. As Rabby returns with the news, he looks thoughtful. "Nothing barring keeping one's servants... but then, nothing barring them being taken away, either. Except their own defenses, of course." He sounds uncertain as he says this - a city that has few "laws" beyond what its individual citizens can enforce is still difficult for him to understand.

"Er... the Incunabulum?" Ramar looks puzzled at Rabby. "I take that to be some kind of set of laws for Nexus, yes?" He falls silent to listen to her speech, and as he does so, his gaze drifts about, observing the streams of people, keeping an eye out for those to be wary of, should it come down to it. As Rabby finishes, "Then it seems logical that there may be many a servant sold when the others arrive. Although it remains to be seen if they will risk entering the city proper."

"Changes for the good, it sounds like," says Rumika. "Do you know of any powerful abolitionists, Rabby?" The night caste tilts her head, rather overwhelmed by the sheer size of this place. "What I've read in books is of little use in reality. I guess we must just move further in and hear and see what we may."

The Lunar girl shakes her head. "It'll take longer, but I can find out what I can," she says. "Come on."

Ramar follows after Rabby, reviewing these 'laws' in his mind as he winds his way down the streets of Nexus. "Alright... where are we headed Rabby?"

Chi-Yosh frowns a touch. Children are no longer for sale? Which suggests they were for sale before. No matter. The Su'Katan files in behind Rabby, who among them is the most experienced with this overwhelming crucible of people.

Rumika nods to Rabby, following quickly. She keeps her eyes open, and does her best to watch the pockets of her friends, knowing quite well that there are likely to be many pickpockets about.

Rabby leads the way through the streets. Twice she's accosted, and twice she deals out a painful beating to the would-be mugger/rapist/admirer/merchant, before the Solars behind her can intervene. After the second beating, she approaches stalls nearby, throwing down silver slivers as currency and snatching up a handful of wood-carved amulets, to be worn around the wrist. "Put these on," she says firmly.

As he slips the wood-carved amulet over his wrist, Ramar asks Rabby, "What exactly is it that these things are for?" He stares down at his for a few moments, wondering just what it is he's just wandered into, before looking back at the Lunar.

Rumika takes the amulet and puts it on. "They are for our own good," she says, laughing a little bit. She will move up to stand by Rabby, "I think I'll keep up near you, where it's safe," she offers, half-teasing the Lunar.

"They're umm.." The girl stares down at her wrist for a moment. "Uhh. Looks like prayer-tokens. But look around you.. a lot of other people are wearing them." And so they are. Many people in the crowd are dressed similarly, and the amulet can easily be mistaken for any other piece of jewelry. "I guess they're having some sort of appeasement ceremony coming soon. But if you dress like an outsider, you get attacked." Rabby ceases to explain, and simply continues to push her way through the thick mob of smelly citizens.

Davron adjusts the bracelets on his wrists. "I see," he mutters, but says little more. He's wary of making any long conversations before so many ears. The huge crowds, and the encounters so far, have made him nervous if not outright paranoid, and right at this moment he wants nothing more than to rescue Willow and get out of this city as soon as possible.

"Ah," remarks Ramar, striding after Rabby and Rumika, following in their wake through the smelly citizens that have come together. _It is an interesting city, to say the least. You'd do well to mark what separates the citizens of the city from the outsiders, lest you have to face such an encounter._ A smile, "Thank you."

Chi-Yosh, as he slips on the token, does desire to not be seen among the crowd. Considering the ebb and flow of the people, the Dawn could not simply blend in with all the clashing citizens, so he must simply fit the part in custom.

Up ahead of the group, there is a break in the crowd, and more noise then is usual. The cause is, for a long time, hard to make out. A woman's voice rises piercingly above the din, "Don't hurt him! Please! Don't kill my son!" And then the crowd divides suddenly, leaving the solars on the edge of a gulf in the sea of bodies. In the middle is a young man, with blood running from a cut on his skull. About him, people are stooping to pick up rocks. "Kill him, he will infect us all! Plague-bringer! He bears the wrath of the gods! We must kill him!" cries out an old man, trying to stir up the others as he lets loose a stone.

Seeing this, Rumika darts forward, not even heeding Rabby, who no doubt would advise avoiding notice. She says nothing at first, just throwing herself across the boy, caring naught for the dangers. A few stones are thrown, some of them striking her as she tries to protect the young man.

Davron reaches out and grasps the shoulder of the nearest stone-thrower, almost as heedless as Rumika of the danger he puts himself in thereby. "What's going on? What's the meaning of this?" he asks gruffly.

"Now see here," cries Ramar, as he steps out of the gulf of bodies and addresses the crowd. He will snatch one of the stones out of the air, and toss it to the ground. "Just a moment..." his eyes pierce the old man, "Before things get out of hand, let's hear what's going on, so that we might know why we are to stone these two..."

Chi-Yosh strides forward even as Rumika sprints forward. His path comes before that of the old man, the mob bringer, guarding his line of sight. "Do not assume you know who has brought down the wrath of the Gods, lest they tell you in person. I am a healer. What sickness does this boy have?"

"He bears the plague, and if we do not expel him he will kill us all! The gods have spoken, he is marked!" The old man turns to the crowd, "Remember well the great plagues! They sear the flesh and leave us so many bodies that they will have to be burned!" The crowd is only going to grow uglier, as a few reach for their weapons, and more than one or two see this as a most opportune time to start removing things from various vendor's stands.

Rumika presses herself slightly off the boy, noticing that she's no longer being struck with stones. "The gods do not mark you, child, they are all about you, and they will care for you." And with that, her voice rises in a soft song, this time using the tongue of the Old Realm, and before her again appears that childlike spirit of air.

"He bears the plague? I see no markings, save the ones you have given him. You who speak of searing flesh and burning bodies..." Ramar regards the old man, "And what of your associates who are stealing from the vendors? Are they infected as well?" Ramar will raise his voice loudly, and indicate those doing so. "Are we so quick to pronounce he has the plague?"

Davron narrows his eyes as he regards the lad in the center of the circle. Something about the look in his eyes... Davron loosens his grip on the man beside him and lets his senses expand, striving to learn more about the subtle cues that the "plague victim" may have run afoul of the spirits...

To Davron's perceptions, the youth is surrounded by a black nimbus of foulness - a dark and corrupted presence, an immaterial spirit of plague and decay.

Stepping before the boy, a mighty blaze of saffron light bursts from the Dawn's body, energy which curls around him, then above him like a surging tide. It rolls down his arms and across the blades of his kamas, for a moment leaving them as long as scythes with the eldrich power. Power flows around him, clawing at the cobblestones and as it flows, leaving the Dawn imposing. His voice is the crash of the ocean, the roar of waves ripping at vessels and the howl of a hurricane's heart. "Strike first, and know the wrath of a God."

Before the display of divinity, the crowd as a whole takes a collective gasp and bows backwards. Cart-gripped items first claimed in fear and the mob mind now are forgotten on the ground. Where the people crackled with the tension of violence are now broken to turn and rush down the lanes away.

Rabby, for one, is nowhere to be seen, though a lean and gray cat leaps out of the way of the fleeing citizens.

"And now we need even more healing." Ramar shakes his head, regarding the trampled bodies. "You are a healer... I will lend you what aid I can." He indicates the trampled bodies and the young man. Ramar looks to Davron, "How is he?"

Rumika doesn't focus on what is occuring around her (thankfully!) Her mind is bent on the young man. She speaks softly with her little spirit, who whispers back. For those who know the forest tongue, they are speaking of evil spirits. With a sudden burst of wind and light, the small child spirit flares out about the form of the young man, smashing away from him what the spirit's eye can see as a dark cloud which at first writhes madly, and then, it tendrils moving like a scream, flees hastily.

As the mob is shattered, the terror of Mighty Helios ebbs away, splashing onto the cobbles around Chi-Yosh. Shrugging the shroud of power, he is suddenly stabbed with dread; the people are a stampeding tide. "I did not think..." No matter. Setting his jaw, he moves forward to hopefully right his impulsiveness.

Davron shades his eyes from Chi-Yosh's glare, and regards the boy more closely as he cowers beneath the Solar monk's fearsome display. He nods quietly, managing a small smile. "Well struck, my young friend," he says, nodding to Leyi. Regarding the lad once more, he says, "Are you all right? You're safe now, even though it may seem otherwise," he adds with a sheepish half-grin.

Rumika rises slowly, shivering a little as the spirit of Leyi leaps past her lips to hide in the safety of Rumika's lungs. "That was a strange thing. Perhaps a few offerings may make sure this does not occur again," she suggests. She looks about, "What caused all this?" she murmurs. Leyi's little voice pipes up from around Rumika, "The scary man was glowing and drove the bad people away."

"There will be time for remorse later," soothes Ramar, his voice soft. "For now, we must tend to the wounded, and we should probably clear away from here, lest we attract unwanted attention." A glance around, "Let me rephrase... _further_ unwanted attention."

"Moving them would be a bad idea." Another he does not need to make. Chi-Yosh kneels beside an older woman, and taking up a shattered crate board, immediately begins setting a broken leg. "Lift her head up, check the back of her head for blood. And open her eyes."

Davron offers a hand to Rumika as well. "How about you? Looks like a few rocks found their mark..." he says, reaching to his pack for some bandages. He'll be using quite a few today, he doesn't doubt.

The group works quickly and efficiently; they are given a wide berth by the passersby who slowly resume their accustomed courses through the road. Only once does Davron glance up, with his spirit-seeing eyes, and see the hint of a cat-like humanoid crouching high on a rooftop nearby, before bounding off.

---

Rabby is nowhere to be found, as the group threads its way deeper into the crazy city of Nexus. Passing over a bridge, they are accosted by half a dozen men and women, yammering in as many different languages or dialects, and emerge from the encounter a few minutes later and a few jade pieces lighter, secure in the knowledge that whatever god, doom, or tax-collector they've just offered money to will be convinced to let them live. More travel, and offers shouted from the market-stalls and windows that bring a bright red bloom to the cheeks of the more refined members of the group. As they near the Coffleblock Market, it becomes progressively easier to identify those individuals and tightly-knit twos and threes who are oppose to the sale of indentured servants that takes place here.

Selecting a group at random, Rumika turns aside from this wandering and introduces herself. As is her wont, she uses her real name, "Good day to you, free people. My name is Rumika, and these are my friends." She gestures to the other solars, but allows them to use whatever names they might choose.

Rumika speaks quickly and to the point. "We are in search of a dear friend who was taken as a slave. The caravan they were taken with is enormous, however, and we cannot do this task alone. We seek the aid of those who believe in the founding will of this great city. Nexus is for the free, and I know there are some here who still remember this."

The conversation is quiet, with much nodding of heads. A name finally surfaces: Ragara Soras Minan, of House Ragara, who makes her home here in Nexus and has a long-standing rivalry with the members of House Cynis. Many of the scions of Cynis will take servants, slaves or worse for their own purposes; Minan has made it her personal mission to oppose them and interfere with the taking of human beings for such purposes.

Having what she needs, Rumika offers a most sincere thank you, and pledges to repay this aid by freeing the slaves of the caravan. "At last we have the beginning of hope," she says. "You see, we are not so alone in this world as you may have feared. There are still some who are noble and true." She smiles and reaches out to snare one of Davron's hands. "Come, let's go find some friends. We have much to arrange."

Ramar smiles, "No, we've had the beginning of hope when Davron aked us to travel with him after his friend. This is cementing that hope. We are never alone here." He glances about, "We shall need to busy ourselves, I think... we have a few more days to prepare before they arrive."

Davron blinks in mild surprise as Rumika tugs him away, but follows, a smile on his face. "What manner of friends are these?" he asks, although he hardly needs to know the details - just knowing that there _are_ allies in this fight is enough, for now.

"They are the best kind of friend, Davron," answers Rumika, "Friends who love freedom, and who are willing to lay down their lives to see that Nexus becomes a terrible place for slavers. Before I came here, I was naturally a bit skeptical, but seeing how large this city is.. even a force of a thousand men is unlikely to stand comfortably against the powers of the freedom fighters."

Chi-Yosh remains silent, mentally sorting what had happened. He had believed the others would cower, rather then flee, before him but... he acted without thinking. A flaw that could cause errors much more grave down the road. All he can do now, though, is focus upon their cause. Though he lingers in the back of the Solar group, finding it ironic that he learned how to be unseen, and yet made himself an obvious eyesore. How well it would be if he could disappear now.

The party departs the Coffleblock Market, intent on finding who and what they need next. Through the crowded streets they press. As they're about to cross another bridge, however, they're hailed by a stern-looking man in robes, who crosses over the bridge first and holds up a hand. "Identify yourselves, in the name of the Council of Entities!" he declares sternly.

"I am Ramar," speaks the Solar of the same name, "What is it we might do for you, oh agent of the Council of Entities?" _What manner of trouble have we gotten ourselves into now?_

Davron comes to a halt. "And I am Davron," he says, momentarily thinking of using an alias but deciding against it, mindful of the tales of the Council's powers and of the consequences of lying to their face.

Chi-Yosh steps forward around his other Solars, standing solid and now resolved for what trouble he's caused. "I am Chi-Yosh. It is I who caused the disturbance."

Rumika bows smoothly, "I am Rumika, and as the council almost certainly already knows, I am of the night caste, Chosen of the Unconquered Sun." It's pretty much impossible for them not to have at least heard some tale from a former festival in Yu-Shan. Rumika has never been quiet about her identity.

"Ah-hah." The robed man nods. "I thought you might be. Anyway, I have a message from the Doctor, Udelph, who sits on the council. 'No being of power shall make a display of obvious power unless its own life be beset.' He also added, on a more personal note, a request: go about your business, just don't burn the place down."

Rumika laughs softly, "Well, we will not burn the place down, though I was thinking if things go well I might sponsor a celebration. The city seems glum and downcast, which hardly encourages people to freely empty their purses." She knows the Council's language there, at least. "And it was a must dreadful mistake, which I assure you will not be repeated." She turns to Chi-Yosh and grins at him impishly. "Right?"

"Indeed. We have no designs on burning the place down to the ground. If I am permitted to ask, where might I acquire a copy of the laws set here in Nexus, so that we might be more aware of what it is we are to do and not do?" Ramar looks a good deal relieved. _Why would anyone want to burn this place to the ground?_

"Laws?" The robed man clears his throat and begins a recital. "No taxes shall be raised, save by the council. None shall obstruct trade. None shall bring an army into Nexus. No one shall commit wanton violence. None may falsely claim the council's name or sanction. None shall harbor a fugitive from the council's wrath." He sighs. "Clear enough?"

Davron simply bows. "The Council is gracious," he says, grateful that the earlier misjudgment will draw no further official attention. Now all that must be reckoned with is the unofficial attention, but that is a rather less fearsome peril.

Chi-Yosh looks sheepish, but affords the weakest of smiles to Rumika before it melts away as he turns to the robed man. "Thank you, sir. It will not happen again; I expected a less mobile reaction. We will be sure to not place ourselves in a position to be in danger."

"Yes, it is quite clear. Thank you very much for your assistance." Ramar bows his head to the robed man. "Is there anything else we should be aware of? Or are we keeping you from your other duties?"

"Yes, you are," mutters the official, before walking past the party. "Be seeing you."

Rumika laughs softly, "Well, that was exactly as I expected." She moves over to Chi-Yosh and says, "Don't be down, you made a mistake. You won't do it again, right? We'll just have to move on. Now that the Council is watching us, we'll probably not have much shot at stealth. Maybe notoriety will work just as well, hmm?" Like Rumika would have it any other way!

Davron wipes his brow, chuckling sheepishly. "If nothing else, our new friends surely will have learned by now what we might bring to the table. Besides, I doubt any of us were thinking of hiding our actions from the Council - just from anyone who might tip off our quarry."

"Perhaps, though I am not certain that the council will act one way or the other. It is simply a matter of not attracting the wrong sorts of attentions at different times." Ramar watches the robed official leave. "I believe that we might try visiting the House Ragara to speak to them, perhaps they will help free the slaves."

Chi-Yosh offers a slightly broader smile Rumika's way. "Naturally you wish to be noticed by all. Perhaps I have in a way helped you." After a moment of scanning about, his smile grows "Though, it seems that one injustice of my actions have been overlooked; Rabby is no longer aside us."
