# Gods of Eden 2004-02-07

In the aftermath of the battle, Gallius first sees her friends off, and then gets right back to work. With Marina's help, the reconstruction of the city is moving right along. Walls and gates are fixed, fields are repaired and healed of damage that thousands of trampling feet tends to cause. The apemen are even ordered to render what help they can, but are also kept away from most of the people (who tend to run away.) Day and night the work goes on. Jade is drained away in the course of it, and of course Gallius also is arguing with the CoR regularly.

The Nuri are continuing their plans to evacuate the city. Beyond what they have assembled to carry out their journey, their tangible belongings, possessions and holdings have been willfully deeded to the reconstruction effort. While the flame of bitterness that burned in the hearts of the citizens has been quenched for now by the act, the gesture can merely delay hostilities, and the warrior-tribesmen-turned-overlords are taking advantage of it. Here and there other such efforts are made by all. Nobody wants to face armed insurrection in a city so recently devastated.

Gallius has a draft prepared, offering the Nuri a place in Roleyn. The land is still larger than Gallius' people, after all. Many messages were sent from Greyfalls to the King of Roleyn to certify it. Using the authority thus granted, Gallius offers the Nuri land and a place where they might settle in peace, giving them and her own people a chance to benefit from each other's presence. She won't press the issue, but simply offers it. There's a certain air of resignation and disappointment that clings to her, leaving her incapable of acting with great passion, though she works no less hard on her self-appointed tasks.

---

"...It's located near Calin, which has been a staunch ally of the Realm," muses Wheel, the delegate of the Nuri who speaks with Gallius now, over tea. "Although the journey would be long. Our greatest difficulty will be the passage. Is there anything you can offer us on this matter?"

"The relations with Calin were strong, or so I was told," says Gallius, "Some centuries ago. But Calin does not acknowledge the Realm any longer. If you speak with them, you will find most of their commoners doubt they ever did, but it was once the case, according to historians." She goes on, "What I suggest is to depart with the hosts of the Marukani and my own people. They will see to it that you are not troubled on the road. I also would like to have the eldest and youngest sent along in air ships. If you wish to settle in Roleyn, it may also be wise to send your most skilled officials ahead, so they can direct those preparing for you. Roleyn's builders do good work in wood and fair in stone, but I think your people wish to live as they have, and not in the strange buildings my kin favor." Gallius sighs softly, "I fear this is terribly rushed, but more patient and careful arrangements can be constructed when you meet the King of Roleyn. I'm sure you will find it all very acceptable."

Few other nations would offer them land without any cost, after all, and no taxes at all for a full generation as a bonus. Merely a promise to aid Roleyn and a promise to be protected likewise is made, and only for defensive purposes, so that the Nuri will not have to march with the CoR against their wishes.

Wheel considers this for a time, then offers his hand in silent acceptance.

Gallius accepts the offered hand, bowing over it. She smiles then, "I will have to prepare the airships and find worthy pilots. I know someone who might aid me, though what he shall ask in repayment I do not know." She must find the twins, and face again some serious growling, it would seem. "If you have any needs, please send word to me swiftly, and I will come swiftly."

---

Gallius wastes little time. Messages are sent to the forces of Roleyn and the Marukani: finish swiftly, we march whenever the Nuri are prepared. She thinks it will set a good precedent. The Nuri, being a proud people, will likely appreciate the gesture, and the honor guard. Malis and Lady Yuri will stay in touch with the Nuri. Gari shall stay away, she hopes. She doesn't want trouble. Gallius also asks for an audience with Alcis and the twins. The latter is really quite redundant, since they always seem to be here with Alcis whenever Gallius comes to speak. The relationship has thus far been dry, stuffy, and formal. Gallius has no hope of it improving. Sighing in resignation, she will wait to be called.

The summons comes, and Gallius is escorted back to the citadel, to the room in which she met Alcis and the twins so long ago, before the war began. This time things are different; the livery of the guards at the doors is that of the Scavenger Lands nations, and Lookshy's generals are consorting with each other over tables, rather than the Realm's military leaders. Nevertheless, the three Dragon-Blooded can be found within, just as they were. "Welcome, Gallius," says Alcis, simply.

"Lady Alcis," answers Gallius. She tries not to sound as tired as she is. Sleep isn't curing it. "I will not waste too much time," she begins. "I have spoken with Wheel of the Nuri, and they wish to accept the offer of land from Roleyn. I wish to aid them in their travels by having the airships carry some of their officials, as well as the old and young. My soldiers are no pilots, however, and I ask for aid in this. I think it is in the interest of all parties that the Nuri be helped to a peaceful land they can call their own. If they remain, violence may break out and so much of our efforts will be undone." Gallius adds rather abruptly, "The Marukani and the forces of Roleyn shall depart with them, which I know you will appreciate."

"I have no objection to it," murmurs Alcis, who has no problem sounding somewhat tired and worn-out. "I'll dispatch our pilots to see to it. If I'm permitted to do that."

"Permitted?" murmurs Gallius. "Who is interfering with you?" The solar is mentally drained, perhaps, but she's still paying attention, and after so much despair, needs just a little spark to burst into flames.

Alcis gestures toward the door. "They have shackled my wrists in my own city," she says. "Officially I am part of the rulership of the city even now, but... No matter, you did not come here to hear of my weakness. It will be seen to, I promise."

"Perhaps.." begins Gallius, "It is time for the sun to rise." She narrows her eyes and tenses. "I have fought, and killed, and the battle is not yet over," she says. "I have little patience left for this interference. Will all good things forever be subject to the festering of maggots?"

"That is the fate of the world," intones Naro. "The brighter the light, the stronger its shadow."

"Then it is time for the darkness to grow," says Gallius. "I'm going to have a little conversation with our dear friends." She is already reaching for essence. "I am going to reopen negotiations with them for the last time. If they think to trifle with me this time, they will not go home." She offers a bow and turns, already preparing to drive whatever rats are outside into hiding.

Gallius pauses and sighs, "But if I die, even should I destroy most of them, they will only treat this place as their treasure trove." She slumps her shoulders. "The brighter the light? This candle has burnt out." She says nothing more, heading out. She does not look at the guards, nor the slugs of Lookshy, lest she say something that will make things worse.

---

Non Valon can be found in the village, entertaining the children who are once again playing freely, now that the shadow of war has been lifted somewhat. He wears his human guise, for he knows well the fear that the people of the Threshold have for the beast-men, and rightly so. He breaks off from this light activity and approaches the Inn as he spots Gallius' approach, a silent invitation to meet and speak if that's what she's come for.

Gallius stops when Non Valon approaches, watching him curiously. When he draws close, she will let out a sigh. "I fear I have failed. The Realm is gone, but it appears the only ones profitting will be the CoR. I can't throw them out. If only we had started earlier, before they got here, maybe.. but who knows. Maybe if we have let the Guild attack them? I don't know. I know they will not listen to me anymore. They have what they wanted. I'm sending the forces of Roleyn and the Marukani away. I think your people should also withdraw, there is no more good to be done here. They have bled and sweated enough."

In response, Valon merely turns and begins walking away, silently.

Gallius lets out a sigh. "So that is the way of Luna's Chosen," she murmurs. "I need you, Non Valon," she says sadly. "If you leave me now, there will be nothing left."

"Then come get me," he says conversationally over his shoulder, smiling for a moment.

Gallius follows, ashamed. She says nothing in response.

Valon leads the way into the Inn and takes a seat, waiting for drinks to arrive. He takes hold of a heavy stein and begins draining it, eyes shut. Finally he opens one eye and sets his drink down, regarding Gallius. "Is it the way of Helios' Chosen to give up in the face of adversity?" he asks quietly.

Gallius just stares at the table for a time. "Once I believed that I had the power to do great things," she says softly. "But that was before I died. Before Kirri died. Now I am Chosen of Helios. We are given power with no clear purpose. We feel direction, but there is no sign that what we do is ever right. We are no less prone to horrible evil than others. What are we? I thought perhaps that by leading men in battle I could do great things in this afterlife. I am no more powerful now than I was before, it seems. I am a warrior, but I cannot slay all my enemies, and I am more tired of having to cower before them than I ever was in battle."

"Oh? You think the entire Realm would have even noticed you before the Exaltation?" asks Valon in surprise. "You think that the generals of great armies would know you by your face and name, where once you were nothing more than the commander of a few thousand men in some periphery state? You think that the Guild would be preparing - as they likely are - to deal with you in the future? Don't give me that shit." Valon slams his mug down on the table, hard enough to send cracks and fissures through it. Alcohol leaks slowly out of the damaged stein. "You've inherited more problems. But the power you've been given is there for you to use as you see fit. That's the freedom you have, which we lack."

"A pity I don't see very well," says Gallius. "I imagine this will pass. I imagine I will forgive those whom I wish to destroy right now. Well, some of them. I suppose I will even regain some measure of that blind faith I had before Greyfalls. But not all of it. We force an order on the world that we cannot even be sure is wanted. We can't even be sure it is for the best! After all, if I understand it correctly, the Solars once had the mastery and were struck down."

"Of course not," says Valon, conversationally. "If everybody wanted the same thing, what room would there be for individual wishes and hopes?" He pushes the broken stein away and clasps his hands together, elbows on the table, as he leans forward. "You know why Lookshy is in the city now? Because of mercy. You and your Circle-mates acted, going against my plan for the city. You traded lives for self-determination. But now that I've had time to think about it, I have to agree with what you did. The people who would have been flooded out would thank you if they ever knew what you'd done. And the city can always be wrested from the Confederation, far easier, I imagine, than you could restore lost lives."

"That at least is true," says Gallius. "I am so furious, Valon. I almost killed all the Lookshy delegates in the city a few hours ago. A part of me still yearns to destroy them. But what good will it do? They will just hamper Alcis all the more and I won't be able to help her anymore." She frowns deeply, "I have to face how many hundred more years of obnoxious frustration like this? The trade doesn't look good in hindsight."

The Lunar separates and spreads his hands, shrugging a bit. "So why not get them out?"

"Because I have no means to do so," answers Gallius. "I'm no manipulator. I can go ask them to leave and they can ignore me again. They won't pay for it for hundreds of years, so what do they care? Unless you have some wondrous suggestion, anyway. I have done my share of diplomacy already in this mess. It's not something I tend to enjoy."

The Lunar scratches his head. "So, do you know any diplomats or manipulators?"

"One, and I already have set her to the task, with as much time as she can spare," says Gallius. "Getting rid of the CoR has always been one of our top priorities. If it wasn't for Lookshy we wouldn't have these problems. We wouldn't have needed them, either! Your troops and my troops do the big fighting, my circle does all the logistic run-around, and who sits at the head of the table? Hah! We conquered armies that the CoR never even saw."

"Maybe that's the problem," chuckles Valon softly. "However--"

His words are cut short by a discreet cough, and Valon's eyes widen. Gallius turns to see what he's staring at. A muscular brute of a man, dark and saturnine of appearance, wearing a heavy cloak of dirty fur, stands in the door. On his face and huge hands are decorative tattoos, similar to those that Gallius has seen elsewhere - on the bodies of the Lunar elders, and Weeping Prowler himself.

Gallius surveys the stranger. She knows a few things. Far fewer now after Greyfalls than she knew before. It's a funny trick of war, destroying so much that one knows. "I began to wonder if you were going to come see me," says the Solar. "I fear the circumstances are not as desired, but such is the fate of those who try to claw their ways out of a deep grave. I can't help but wonder, Ma-Ha-Suchi, how your eyes see me, for my own are crooked by dreams of a past that is not my own."

"I see just fine with two eyes, despite your efforts," growls the newcomer. He strides in, and rather than waiting to be served, pushes his way past the serving-girl and fills a stein to the brim for himself. That done, he marches toward the table, climbs up on it and squats down atop the table itself before taking a long drink, and letting out a prodigious belch.

"It is odd, but my dreams lend you a more graceful and pleasing manner," answers Gallius. "Or perhaps Valon had merely skewed my thoughts of Luna's Chosen. I had thought you were all fuzzy and playful." She definitely didn't expect to have the most powerful chosen she's ever met on a table in front of her. "I imagine you know Ma-Ha-Suchi's name, Non Valon, but I'm guessing you haven't met. I hope your introduction isn't as painful as mine was."

"Yeah.." Valon's voice is low. Meanwhile, Ma-Ha-Suchi extends a hand, which becomes a taloned paw, and drives the spikes into the table. He drags them a few inches, while tortured wood peels and shaves, before he withdraws the terrifying claws. "Fuzzy and playful?" he rumbles. "What is it you want with me, Solar?"

"I had a thousand questions for you, when I sent the message," says Gallius. "And now that you are here, and now that I know better of what I am, they are all seemingly of no value. We do what we are meant to do. Whether we pretend it is our mind or by compulsion of a more direct means. There is one question I would ask. Did you return the love that the bearer of my spark gave to you? Did you feel that strong pull that even now haunts me, passed down through the ages?"

"And if I did?" is the big man's only reply for a moment. He takes another long drink, finishing the contents, before throwing the stein carelessly over one shoulder. "I obey my instincts," he continues. "I did then. Even when it burned me like a flame."

"Your instincts led you here, then," says Gallius. "Your instincts made me Chosen of Helios. Do not expect me to smile over it, however, for many died so that I could be exalted. Will you at least tell me her name?"

"Not quite," says Ma-Ha-Suchi with a smile. "I came to inspect my handiwork."

"Oh?" murmurs Gallius. "What precisely is that supposed to mean? Have you come to gloat over me? It would not matter. I cannot change the splinterings of the past inside me. I cannot free myself of you. My life will not be long enough to heal that wound."

"Not you," retorts the big barbarian. "The city. The Confederation was easy to manipulate." He sits back, scratching his ribs with a hand.

"I wish you could manipulate them right off a cliff," says Gallius. "They are causing me no end of trouble, now. I don't suppose you have an army you'd lend me? Just for a few days. I wonder if I was such a violent woman back then? I suppose not." She doesn't even wonder in the back of her mind how she can talk so lightly and freely with this incredibly powerful exalt.

"I have no army for the likes of you," the wild-man mumbles. "It seems like you've mellowed with age, though."

"Hmph! I'm not mellowed, I'm weak. I need time, then I'm sure I'll put together a pyre that will impress you," retorts Gallius. "But at risk of being honest with you, I am sick of this. This killing, this fighting. The humans don't want to be helped into a time of peace. They want to kill each other for profit. They don't want justice, they want the mastery. They have no wish for freedom, they want to be the owners of vast estates manned by helpless slaves. Such are the men who arise to power in so many of their lands. Take the Guild, for instance. They sell men to be devoured by the Fair Folk, and then buy back their mindless husks."

Ma-Ha-Suchi remains silent. Valon drums his fingers against the table. Finally the barbarian speaks. "You talk a lot more, too." He shrugs helplessly. "But why talk? Want peace and justice? Make it. That's the proper way."

"I'm not the same, I just happen to inherit a few unfortunate things that some incompetent spirit didn't clear away," says Gallius. "Like this stupid emotion that draws me to you. If I want something, just take it? Tell me this. Why were my kind killed in the first place? I want to know that."

Ma-Ha-Suchi leaps from the table, gathering up his stein in the process. He goes for a refill, then returns, pouring beer over his chest as he drinks sloppily. Another belch, and he speaks. "They went mad," he says. "Crazy. Drunk with power. They forgot themslves. So we killed 'em."

"So we deserved it," says Gallius. "And if I do just what I want.. why would it not turn out the same? I don't want to crush the world under my feet. I don't want to give in to my instincts and kill everyone who opposes me. In the end, the world would be silenced." She looks seriously at Ma-Ha-Suchi, and then to Valon, "And what do you think? Do you want the Solars to rise again? What is your instinct?"

"Do what you want," is his reply. "If you're fit to rule, you'll rule eventually anyway. If not, you'll be trampled or killed. That's what's natural."

Gallius sighs and looks at the table for a time. "Are you not also Chosen? Are you not meant to stand beside us? We will surely need your help if we are to ever overcome the same fate as before." She frowns, "It may not mean much to you, but I am sorry for failing you in the past. I would promise not to let it happen again, but it would be a shallow oath. How can I hope to stand against something that overcame those who were so much more powerful?"

"Isn't hope how you stand against anything?" mutters the big man. He shrugs. "I was Chosen because I was meant to survive. That's what Luna demands. That we endure."

Gallius smiles and considers his words. "So that's all you want, survival? Why was it you tried to kill me? And why did you kill my men? They were no threat to you, and you could easily have just avoided us."

"Who you were, and still are, is a threat," growls the big Lunar. "You complain of men killing each other. What do you do about it? You put your men and women in villages, take away their weapons, and organize an army. What has that got you? Now these soft peasants quarrel with each other freely because they do not fear death. And your soldiers, I am told, had to be commanded not to rape and loot. You think you can throw off all the unpleasantness onto your soldiers, and command them not to indulge in their passions. You can't, and that is the danger."

"So what would you have me do, then?" answers Gallius, getting a bit annoyed in turn. "I doubt you can come up with a perfect way. Thousands have tried, and this remains the best means to the end. Killing my people surely helped a lot in that, I imagine.. so many children left without a mother or father, so much pain. That is what I try to prevent."

"Prevent killing, by leading troops into battle against a far-off city?" Ma-Ha-Suchi throws back his head and laughs aloud, slapping the table with a hand. "How grand."

Gallius rolls her eyes, "It seems your eyes have been shut and your ears deaf. I have done much to avoid bloodshed in this battle. I do not think asking the Realm to leave will work very often. Not yet, anyway. If you have nothing worth listening to, you can leave, I would do better to be alone. Or if you will not.. maybe I will go myself. I told you why I sent the message to you, but you have yet to tell me why you came." She rises swiftly, kicking her chair back as she does, so it slams into the floor.

"I did indeed tell you, my deaf companion," chuckles Ma-Ha-Suchi. "Who do you think caused the Confederation council to go to war?"

"Did you? Does the city of Greyfalls lie on this table?" She narrows her eyes, looking at the surface, "No, I'm afraid you are quite lost. Perhaps your mind is failing." Gallius turns away, shaking her head, "I fear we will meet again, though I can't imagine it will be very profitable for me."

"Think what you like," the Lunar rumbles, hopping from the table. "While the Great Houses squabble about what to do with their precious port city, my troops are marching on Harborhead, in the Southeast. Those slavers can join the Dragon-Blooded rabble of Greyfalls in falling from power."

"Then I should be grateful to you," says Gallius. "And yet.. I must go. Everything is amiss, now. I need to escape this place, and never return." The Lady just stands still, though, unsure of where to go, or what to do. "What I seek none here can give me. Those who could are gone away, and I am chained to a task that will steal my will." She bows to Ma-Ha-Suchi. "Farewell, and thank you for coming. I fear I am nothing but a feeble reflection of what I was. It is just as well you did not come this way for me. I know less and less. Farewell." And finally she is able to move, and she moves swiftly to the door.

---

Ma-Ha-Suchi has gone. In the room over the inn, where Gallius has sometimes stayed, Valon enters. "Hey."

Gallius lies on her bed, looking over a battered map of the route back to Roleyn. It was just penned today. She's apparently not treating it well. She looks up, "Well, at least you got to see your great hero," comes her distracted answer.

"He's about what I expected," remarks Valon, calmly. He takes a seat on the floor, curling up and leaning back against one wall, his hands clasped behind his head.

"Did you need something?" she asks. Gallius crumples the map again and throws it across the room towards a small desk. "I was just settling down to stare at the ceiling for a few hours."

"Yeah," says Valon, lazily. He hums softly, reaching up to scratch at his head with a hand. "I gotta figure out what a ceiling has that makes a lovely lady want to look at it instead of me."

"I'm sorry, Valon," says Gallius. "I wasn't really aware of what it really is to be Chosen of Luna. I was thinking.." She frowns at the ceiling and sighs. "I was thinking I could get something from you that isn't really possible. We are too different. How did Lunars and Solars ever marry in the past? We are nothing at all like each other."

"Well, that much is true." The monkeyman hums again. "Different in some ways, but very similar in others. Solars and Lunars of the First Age both bore the heaviest burdens of responsibility and duty to Creation. They just went about fulfilling it in different ways. Both knew what it meant to hold the lives of thousands in a hand. They.. supported each other, because no single leader of men can really stand alone."

"I need someone to support me," says Gallius quietly. "I think I look badly enough upon myself. I do not need more to judge me." The Lady sighs, shaking her head, "Yet.. I don't know."

Valon hums again. "Alright then," he says. "I'm still waiting to see how you'll give the city of Greyfalls back to its people. Whether or not you see a way now, I believe you will find one, if you have faith in yourself. I know the people have faith in you. I had enough to give command of my warriors to you, and that faith continues. And until you find a way, they - and I - are yours, for whatever you require."

"Thank you," Gallius says softly. "Did Ma-Ha-Suchi leave?" she asks warily. "I don't know why I even had that message sent. Stupid romance and ignorance, maybe. Those feelings may still curse me, but I won't listen to them."

Valon shrugs and nods. "Yeah, he's gone," he says. "So you acted out of instinct? We're not so different after all, eh?" The Lunar smiles broadly. "Your instincts are good ones, Gallius. You act to preserve life, and honor, and freedom. Those are good things."

"Do you really want to become like that that uncultured bellowing slob?" asks Gallius softly. "If you jump up on a table and spill beer all over yourself I assure you I won't be wooed by it. I might put your on your head, though."

"Huh?" Valon is surprised for a moment, but he thinks quickly, and a light of realization dawns. "Well, to be frank, Ma-Ha-Suchi fights for what he believes in. He's good to the people under him. He's ruthless to his enemies. He is a man of virtue. He has bad table-manners, but he's a conquerer, not a king. I don't think he wants what I want, but I wish that I could fight with the same determination he does, for the things I believe."

"I hope you don't lose the parts of you that I like most," says Gallius. She sighs softly and smiles, "Valon, Valon, Valon. You are a man of virtue, as well. I wonder though, what you want. I wonder if it is what I want. I wonder if I really know for certain what I want?"

"Well, think it over," remarks the Lunar with a smile. "Think about what you really want, yourself. Then fight for it. Put every ounce of your power into getting it. Honor those who pledge themselves to your banner. Overcome all that hinders you. But if you don't know which way to go, then it is truly best to hold back and consider it. That is wisdom."

"I haven't thought about what I personally want in a very long time," murmurs Gallius. "I haven't cared, I guess." She adds, "I do not think Valon is willing to tell me what he wants."

Valon laughs aloud. "Well, since you asked so nicely.. I want a world with meaning. I want to understand the natural order of things again, the way I used to. The way all Lunars used to."

"And that is it?" says Gallius, sounding just a little bit bothered. "There's nothing less lofty that you are interested in?" She rolls onto her side, studying the Lunar closely.

"Oh, well, lots of things, none of which are fit for a classy lady's ears," jokes the Lunar. "If you can't stand to see a man belch after a beer you sure as hell won't like what I have to say."

"I think I know what I want. For myself, anyway," says Gallius. "I want to be loved. Not as a queen or a goddess, but as a woman. And I want to love a husband, who won't hate me for what I am, nor fear me, nor doubt himself because I am powerful. Ma-Ha-Suchi fails that on just about every count." She laughs softly, "But I should be glad, I guess, that he is worried about me."

Valon nods. "So then, better chase after a husband. Wield your armies to impress him, et cetera," he remarks, sounding solemn, with a gleam of mischief in his eye. "Ma-Ha-Suchi has a love of his life, and that is Luna. Maybe you should see if your Unconquered Sun is available?"

"I've seen him," says Gallius, "And he's just not at all my type. I was thinking of someone more down to Earth, but.. maybe that won't work, either. I will not play my husband as a second, and so I cannot accept being second to any in his eyes, either. If I wouldn't have to as a mortal woman, why should I have to now?"

"Sounds about right. The women are usually in charge in our lands, and I keep forgetting you're not from here, so to me you sound very humble," chuckles Valon. "Well then. You'll want to find yourself a Solar, it sounds like. Or someone else with enough power to keep his manliness intact in the face of his new wife."

Gallius sighs, "I suppose. Though I honestly doubt I'll get on well with another self-important Solar." She frowns in thought, "Maybe I'll just string along a host of men, one after another. Or maybe I'll get smart and forget about such a silly thing as love."

"Right!" Valon smacks a fist into his hand. "Dally about. Philander to your heart's content. It's worked for me!" He winks, casting doubt as to his actual sincerity in this matter. "Or at least, it worked for the Scarlet Empress. Four marriages, seven long-term relations, and a host of random lovers."

"Or maybe I'll just settle for second," murmurs Gallius. "Luna is very beautiful, isn't she? I was lucky enough to see her in Yu-Shan. Second to her can't be that bad, can it? Not if the man was a fine catch, anyway." She grins impishly, "Then again, if the man were too thick-headed to even know when a woman was really interested.."

".. Or if he felt he was already second and was stalling for time to be equal," observes Valon, casually waving a finger. "But what do I know about thick-headed men?"

"A great deal," answers Gallius. "I hope he realizes that I will wait for him, even he's already first in my mind. Valon, you have left me so weak that I could not handle any more pain, and then you have healed me. I'm not sure you even realize it."

"You'd be surprised by what I realize. I frequently am, anyway," remarks Valon with a smile.

Gallius nods, "I really am glad you are here, Valon. It probably sounds silly, but.." She lets out a soft sigh, "But I think you'll run away if I tell you the full truth. Run away and think, and I like having you where I can keep an eye on you."

Valon chuckles. "The full truth? That you are the reincarnation of the Empress herself, who died and came back from the Underworld to be with her one and only Lunar? ... Yes, you're right, I'd flee screaming." He smiles broadly.

"You are such a clown," says Gallius. "Of all the Chosen why did I have to wind up with you, hmm? I don't think I really want you to be serious, though. I don't like it when you growl or shout at me."

Valon shrugs and smiles. "I'm not a particularly nice person. I can be sometimes, but not always."

"You are being nice now," says Gallius. "I'd really appreciate if you were nice to me most of the time." She stretches out on her bed, considering the Lunar for a while before adding, "I think you are a very good person, Valon. Don't worry, though, I won't spread it around."

"Well, my secret's safe," scoffs Valon. "So who's going to keep YOUR secret, hmm?"

"What secret is that?" murmurs Gallius. "That I'm a dispirited, tired woman? I don't think it's a very well kept secret. I'll try my best to break out of the mould, though."

"That's good. Trying your best is who you really are," says Valon gently.

For a long time Gallius is silent, watching Valon. After a while, she curls up on her bed and softly sighs. "Valon? When you think you are ready, let me know, will you?" She smiles and leaves it at that, remaining quiet until she finally slips into a sleep that might finally give her some energy back.
