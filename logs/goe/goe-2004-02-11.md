# Gods of Eden 2004-02-11

Forewarned by their earlier excursion through the harbor and markets of the city, the Solars mill about for a bit, observing the habits around them as they pretend to shop. As Rabby is still missing (or hiding), they are without any guidance except their own wits. Still, wits are enough - learning the prayer one speaks as one crosses the Stone and Bone Bridge, for example, is easy after Ramar observes that every pedestrian speaks it softly before stepping onto the bridge. Likewise, picking out those on Council business, representatives of the Guild, and other power players is a skill that requires only a few hours of practice to hone.

Rumika learns what she can. Her main goal would normally be to find the best parties and the wildest, more cheerful people. However, she's got business to handle, and she doubts even after it is handled that Davron would want to actually enjoy himself for a while. Instead, she does her best to gather info about the abolitionist whose name was offered. She can be oddly subtle, when she wants to.

"So I suppose there's not much to do now, is there," muses Ramar as he looks about. "I mean aside from finding out who it is we're talking to, there's really not much I can think of. It's a nice city to be certain, but I cannot help but feel we're wasting time just waiting. We should be doing something. If I were more clever, I'd think of a way to turn the market against the filthy slavers by the time they arrive, so we could acquire all of the soon to be freed people and turn them loose."

"If it were that easy, Ramar, we could just rally the guards and free everyone, but the truth is that right now there are thousands upon thousands of slaves in this city, being sold and bought," says Rumika. "I think I explained that already, though.. I hate repeating myself. I feel so old when I have to do that."

Chi-Yosh has always been one to sit back, listen, and watch. It is then no challenge to observe the workings of Nexus people who are, if nothing else, an animal of their own kind. It takes him several hours, but he begins to sense the eb and flow of the people, and a hand full of customs from a half-dozen different groups. He has spotted at least three arguements - which led to blows over some misunderstanding gesture - two pickpockets, and a few slick salesmen and merchants hooking in potential customers. Letting his Circle mates handle the fencing of words, the Su'Katan simply enjoys the scenery and learning experience. All the more to see how to blend in here.

Ragara Soras Minan, enemy of House Cynis in the city of Nexus, is known by reputation to many of those Rumika and the others speak to. She retains a home on the hill above the Nexus District itself, a neighborhood called "Bastion" for its well-guarded walls and gates (and thus safety, in this city). She is known to participate in the School of Philosophy, and any social introduction is best made at the salons the School is known for. Soras Minan has been attacked before; her guards are extraordinarily suspicious.

"Being an enemy of house cynis is a very dangerous thing," says Rumika. "It's no wonder that the guards are going to be rather jumpy." Rumika sighs softly, watching a small group of men from the corner of her eye. "I think we should move on, though." Her presence is going to start causing trouble for at least then tenth time today, it seems.

"Very well then. Let us move on to one of these salons. At the very least we can attempt to make an introduction. At the very best, we shall learn all we care to learn, and not a thing more." Ramar smiles, then moves on, stepping serenely through the city, paying no more attention than is warranted the guards as he heads for the school. "Here goes nothing..."

An event at the School of Philosophy is scheduled for the following day; time is taken to prepare for it. Like all of the members of the Realm's nobility, Soras Minan moves in rarefied circles, and despite the cause she champions, she too will be aware of the station of those who come to her for favors. Night falls, and lodgings are found; dawn finds them riding in state within a hired carriage, toward and through the gates of Bastion. The School of Philosophy is a marble edifice, grand and imposing, a work of refinement and culture that shows the better side of the lawless city in which it resides. Stepping through the archway of towering double-doors, the party sees a mingled crowd of attendees, dressed in finery from a dozen cultures, grouped together beneath a dome of marble at least twenty yards overhead. The dome's underside is a decorative painting, showing five Dragon-Blooded teachers instructing a crowd of children in a pastoral setting. Several faces turn, appraising the newcomers as they enter.

Rumika knows a few things. Making an entrance is one of those things she is very good at. Here among mortals it's easier for her to make an impression. Far easier than it was in Yu-Shan. She wears the glistening Gown of Dancing Nectar. Each step sweeps out, baring her ankles and causing the fabric to glisten in the light. In her hair, Rumika has woven gold and silver ribbons that form an ornate web, holding her dark hair in order. Through the elaborate work are stabbed two chopsticks, the wooden lengths carved in a cunning design. Her face bears light painting, her eyes hi-lighted and her lips colored a vivid red. She moves with the lazy, casual grace of a seasoned dancer, each step not a means of motion, but an expression of her confidence.

Sleek, calf high deer-skin boots tanned to the shade of the Blessed Island's chocolates lead the Easterner in. The boots themselves match the tanned skin of taut leg before disappearing beneath the leaf-dyed tunic of cloth less durable than attractive. A belt capped with a silver buckle loops about the Woodman's waist, offering a compliment to the vest of red-brown, made living by the delicate stitchwork dedicated to the Eastern vegetation. With hair put in a tight braided bun, Chi-Yosh walks in with little anxiety; the clothing, while not him, are simply a paint over him. The same ease finds him as though he were striding through the trees, but now in the equally dangerous social wilderness.

Of all the strange places Davron could go in Nexus, a School of Philosophy seems the sort of place he could best fit in. As an out-of-towner, though his sense for the current fashion in the apparel of scholars and academics is probably a little less than perfect. Nevertheless, he makes his entrance attired in a way that he feels will suit him - something not too ostentatious, not too outre', but nevertheless the garb of a man who makes his living by the work of his mind rather than the work of his hands. Definitely in the shadow of the flamboyant Rumika, but still fit to be in her company.

There is an outpouring of color and cloth as the carriage pulls up to the School of Philosophy. The cloak, as soft and elegeant as water flows over the ground, a river of blues and purples that runs from the Ramar's back downwards. The collar thereupon rises, stretching towards the sky, framing Ramar's face... and down the front, the edges part, revealing darker hues that wreath the Solar's form as he sails deftly towards the entrance. His feet sound against the polished ground, tapping in rhythm with the rise and fall of conversation echoing from within. _Well... this is it..._

All eyes are on the entrants; whispered conversation begins to pervade the assembly. One man, dressed like a peacock, approaches, hints of uncertainty visible on his handsome face. "Welcome guests," he says, smoothly. "My name is Lingering Rainbow, and allow me to welcome you to the School of Philosophy. May I introduce you?"

"We thank you for your welcome. It is a pleasure to attend the School of Philosophy, Lingering Rainbow." Ramar smiles a soft smile and bows his head respectfully to the peacock. "If you wish to introduce us, I suppose you may. This is Rumika," he says, as he indicates the beautiful girl of the same name, "These two are David and Owl," is the prelude to Davron and Chi-Yosh, respectfully, "And I am Wandering Wind. It is a pleasure to meet you, and an honor to have you introduce us."

The salon's patron smiles, inclining his head. He takes Rumika's arm rather possessively, escorting her out into the crowd as the others follow. For the next half-hour, conversation and wine flow together, and the air swirls with poetry, music and perfume. The cultured come here to exhibit their knowledges and talents; the less cultured are free to come to the School during "open" events, such as this one, to enrich themselves. In this way the freedom of Nexus is a benefit to its citizens.

Ramar enjoys the freedom of Nexus for the time being. _Although such freedom is likely a double edged sword._ Thankfully, Ramar does not mention that thought aloud. Over the next half hour, he will while away the time listening to conversations, tilting an ear to those subjects which are most interesting... and all the while, the subtle flows of power, knowledge, and indeed, life itself, are echoed beneath the words, caught by motes of Essence and brought to Ramar's ears, whispered. Ramar smiles, offering an interesting viewpoint or two regarding the subjects when asked, even if they are views he himself does not share. "While I might not believe this to be so, perhaps others might view this matter thusly," And as the conversation ebbs and flows, and the dance of life and people around him unfurls, he is careful to learn from the experience. _We're here after all... why not do what is meant? Why not learn?_

Chi-Yosh carries himself as though he were in danger; his eyes are alert, and he watches and listens to those around him very carefully. But while he will not be hurt, it is a matter of intellectual survival. The Dawn does not speak much, unless he is spoken to, or a moment of insight is offered for him to sprinkle his perception into it. Like his namesake, he listens far more then he speaks, and only when the best weight might be offered.

Rumika accepts the escort gratefully. She doesn't let him think of her as a trophy, however, for her mind if as formidible as she is attractive. She wishes to enter debate and sharpen her mind on the questions these people have come to consider. Ideal government, the road to true bliss, and the exchange of freedom for safety are the kind of discussions she seeks out. She enjoys a verbal fencing match with a man convinced that democracy is the only good government and gleefully slicing his arguments to ribbons, for the will of the majority is to enslave those who are less than they. Rather than pay attention to currents, she forms her own, standing her ground with anyone who has the wit to understand her.

Conversation grows with attendance; the four are introduced widely. Eventually their target arrives. Soras Minan is a woman in her late forties who could easily be a decade (or more) younger. She carries herself with the mature grace of mortal age. Rather than surrounding herself with young and handsome men, as some of the dowagers and matrons of the salon have done, she is content with the company of her guards and assistants, young men and women all. In due course introductions are made, and she attaches herself firmly between Chi-Yosh and Ramar in conversation.

Ramar is pleased to converse with Soras Minan and Chi-Yosh. He's thankful to have a friend along to help keep the pace of the conversation, which of course will be turned towards the subject at hand. Of course the topic is not to be breached bluntly. It must be danced around, hinted at in polite conversation, but the subtle underpinnings of the conversation will flavor the talk. "So you see," he explains, after having revealed some of what he knows. He's not going to reveal enough that it would be dangerous for her to know it, should she decide against help, but he will ask for her aid, and reveal what he can, "My friends and I were wondering if we might enlist your aid in this endeavour."

"An interesting dilemma," Minan remarks, with a sad smile. "I'm afraid I cannot directly intervene - the forces at my command are too sparse to act on such a scale. However, I can aid you in other ways. Meet me at my home this afternoon, dear boy.." She removes a ring from her left hand, pressing it into Ramar's palm. "This will gain you access without question. Though just what it will gain you access to, I leave for you to find out."

Chi-Yosh nods to the gracefully aging woman, his smile almost more affection and appreciation then the dissapointment can damper. "Thank you for what help you may assist. Your reputation preceeds you for your willingness for a just cause." He peers across the woman's ring to Ramar for a moment.

Ramar will close his palm around the ring, and tuck it away after a moment. A smile, "I thank you Lady, for your aid, and I am honored to accept what can be offered." He bows his head, then peers over at Chi-Yosh, raising an eyebrow in a silent query, as if to say 'what?'...

Davron has spent most of the morning quietly listening to what is said, rather than making many contributions of his own. This moment is no different, but he does offer the woman a grateful smile of his own. The ring is a token of hope to him - and he for one will be there this afternoon to see what this hope will redeem.
