# Gods of Eden 2004-02-11a

Gallius doesn't let herself lose hope for long. She steels herself, thinking of a new, more reasonable way to get rid of the CoR. Perhaps for a long time. With the help of Gari, she goes out intercept a string of scouts. To each she says the same thing. "You saw a great host arrayed against you. The Realm is sending a formidible force of reinforcements to Greyfalls and they are ready to take the city." She even offers little tokens of this or that house for them to return with, when she wants to weave a more elaborate tale, turning these scouts into fantasy heroes who overcame enemy front runners who never existed.

Even as she does this, Gallius sends a message to Alcis. It is carefully ciphered, so that spies will find it utterly baffling. It warns the leader to be ready for the CoR to depart hastily and to keep order. Gallius will have to be away for a few days, catching scouts and keeping them mis-informed.

Gallius does not limit herself to just the spies. She goes to the highest of mortal commanders that she can meet. Marina begins staging it, carefully creating a document of seemingly great import which is sent to the battle leader. Not from her, of course, but seemingly from Lookshy. The letter contains not a single bit of writing on it, but Gallius just happens to be there when it is opened, and she is the only one with the reader. "You have just read a letter of utmost secrecy. You have been ordered to withdraw immediately and the magical ink has faded away. You are still ordered to burn this secret message, lest a sorceror find it." She goes on, explaining, "I came into the room, spoke for you a while, and you ordered me to leave so you could prepare for these matters." And with that, Gallius leaves the camp.

Gallius pays attention to several things in this matter. A force to flee from, orders to return. They all make things plain enough, but she figures she ought to add to it. Ma-Ha-Suchi's forces are real enough, and she makes sure the scouts in that direction interpret this quite incorrectly. Instead of seeing them move against another city, they will be quite sure that the barbarians are storming north, lead by a terrible monster. It should be enough to encourage the confederates to flee. Here and there Gallius pulls strings, playing on old suspicions and fears that have developed over time. Every nation involved here has enemies that it has to worry about, and home comes first. Whenever possible, Gallius bleeds off the strength of the motley band, telling this or that general that his homeland is in need. Sometimes via scouts, sometimes via fake messages carefully assembled by Marina.

The Confederation's plenipotentiary council has met quickly. This body was granted near-absolute authority by the Confederation itself, to act as circumstances dictated. Already primed and suspicious by Lookshy's generals, they have gathered to discuss the grave matter before them. The Realm and its allies are in no position to easily reclaim the city, and the Confederation's forces are better served by forcing an engagement down-river, should it come to that. This is the buzz of conversation Gallius can overhear, and even feel in her bones, as she strides into General Saulos Nebarr's tent. The General and his staff have refused to do as the plenipotentiary council has done, and move into Greyfalls proper. The Lookshy Dragon-Blooded still camp outside, in their tents, surrounded by their forces. And here, once the guards have gone, the General regards Gallius with smiling eyes but a stern frown.

Gallius offers a bow to the general. "You have called, and I have come. What sets this camp in such a strange buzz?" She looks around, frowning as she considers the place. "I doubt it's any reaction to the worries of my people. I only hope that the Marukani and Nuri add enough to the diminished Roleyn forces to dissuade any interference from barbarian forces." She pretends to suspect a more eastern course for Ma-Ha-Suchi's army, just to make herself appear a little bit out of the loop.

"A Lunar Warstrider was present during the battle," says he. "It aided our troops - coordinated with them, in fact. Beast-men, too. This has been an uncanny battle. It makes me wonder, about many things..." The General turns, clasping his hands behind his back as he looks away from Gallius. "And now evacuation from Greyfalls is discussed. The recon reports are all consistent. Everything checks out. And yet..." He smiles and chuckles softly. "The military commander of the city - Alcis Katsura - has spoken of you, Lady Gallius. She and you share some sort of connection. Our departure would please a great many people, including her, wouldn't you agree?"

"That depends," says Gallius. "If you leave us and the Realm should come back, what do you think they would do to her?" She frowns, "I have done my best to protect her once, and I will do so again. I care for her and admire her. In her lives something noble and fearless, general. I think, perhaps, the same thing is alive in you. You are no fool. You know that I wish the confederation would leave and allow Greyfalls to become its own place. Tell me, why is it that you have not moved in to the city like the others?" She leaves the question hang for a moment and adds, "Surely if any deserve credit for the victory, it is the leadership of Lookshy and not some fat-bellied bureaucrats."

"It is a truth of history that those most responsible for a good deed are the least remembered, Lady Gallius," says the General, softly. "Perhaps history will never record the name of that man or woman who was ultimately responsible for the Confederation's departure from Greyfalls, a fact which now seems inevitable. The people of the city would hail this hero with accolades, if they knew. Is that how this person would wish it, I wonder?"

"I wish I could tell you everything you deserve to hear, general," says Gallius, "For the more we speak the more I admire you." She sighs softly and offers a sad smile, "I hope that you at least will not look at those who are my kin as beasts, but as people that might not be so different than you are. If you need my help, general, I will give it. Tell me, though, if you wanted to fight to make a puppet state or to create a strong ally. I think we are not so different."

"I think I have all the help that is required for now," smiles Saulos. He spreads his hands wide. "Now the council will vote on the matter of abandoning Greyfalls - or rather, I should say, moving our present forces to a more secure defensive position. Come with me and observe, will you?"

Gallius nods slowly, moving to join the general. "I will see what there is to see. I hope not to take up too much of your time. We both have many duties to see to." She won't mention how she has been scarce as of late. She thinks the general knows that she's arranged this departure.

---

The plenipotentiary council's vote is split, of course - divisive issues, by nature, are close votes. Nevertheless, the decision to withdraw in an orderly fashion is passed. A motion is advanced to draw up a two-week timetable for departure, and adopted almost unanimously. That the timetable has probably been long since completely drafted by someone in Lookshy's staff is a suspicion that grows in Gallius' mind, based on the faces of the military personnel in attendance at the meeting.

After enjoying a peaceful night of rest, Gallius gets back to work. She wakes up, washes herself, and makes her way to speak with Alcis. Hopefully Alcis won't be disappointed that it'll be two weeks before the confederation leaves. Gallius was hoping for a faster panic, but Lookshy is too steady and calm an influence to create such a kneejerk response. It's all just as well. Gallius thinks of all these things as she makes her way to see her friend. Hopefully Alcis will be pleased.

Alcis receives her visitor. Or visitors, as it turns out: Gallius and General Saulos arrive at almost the same time, and greet each other cordially before being admitted. Kano and Naro are nowhere to be seen. The plain woman inclines her head thoughtfully, then kneels to begin the tea ceremony. Conversation is withheld while Alcis works, swiftly performing the ritual of culture and breeding recognized among the Dragon-Blooded. At length, three cups of tea are poured and conversation can begin. General Saulos, for his part, begins by drinking his tea, leaving the opening to one of the two women.

Gallius observes the ceremony with care. She started knowing something of it, but has become somewhat of an expert over days of seeing it. One of these days, she will have to perform it for Kano and Naro, just to stun them. She drinks her tea and smiles, "As refreshing as the spring air. If there is no business to speak of, perhaps I might speak of a question I had. I find myself knowing only a sliver of the truth of the world, and though I am told I will have time to learn I believe that the road to wisdom is not tread by sloth." She pauses for a moment and goes on, "I know little of the stories the Realm tells, save that they are not the same as my own. But who would teach one such as me?" She smiles and shakes her head, "Few Dragon-Blooded wish to speak with my kind. Sadly, even I think there may be a very good reason. How can I change the future, though, if I do not understand the past?"

"Our history teaches us that the Realm has always existed, since the dawn of Creation," recites Alcis. She's smiling; this is a time of happiness for her, when the cares of war have left her shoulders, and she's allowed to indulge in culture and education. "We, the Dragon-Blooded of this generation, are the inheritors of the Realm. There are those, like the General, who are opposed to the Realm and all it stands for. But even enemies must be civil. But Gallius, this much I know." Her eyes narrow somewhat, and concern is graven into the lines of her face. "The Anathema have always been monsters, and have always been a threat to peace and civility. I do not believe you are evil, but I believe that the power you hold will turn you to evil in the fullness of time. That is why the Immaculate Order hunts the Anathema with such zeal."

"And yet I have been ordered to live as this," says Gallius softly. "And I fear you are right, that if my kind are left to ourselves we will grow corrupt and evil. I hope to find some way to save the Solars. I tell myself that there is a way. I believe we are meant to exist, that we can offer much to the world." Gallius looks down at the floor and sighs quietly, "I must know everything if I am to have any hope of claiming victory and freedom for the Chosen of Helios. I do not believe that one as noble as the Unconquered Sun would change me, knowing my fate could be nothing but to become a thing of evil."

"Perhaps you would be served by speaking to an Immaculate monk?" suggests Alcis. "One who does not know your true identity. As a penitent, and someone who is of royal birth, if I remember truly, you would be welcomed as a seeker of knowledge. I will write a letter of introduction, if it would be of use. The Immaculates hold in their libraries many records of our earliest history."

"I would feel uncomfortable lying to them," says Gallius. "But if that is the only way, I suppose it is the only way. Still.. honor is something I try to maintain whenever possible." She turns to her tea and says then, "But I am wasting the general's time. I'm certain he didn't come here to listen to one of the anathema prattle on about her hopes and fears."

"The General came at the invitation of Alcis Katsura," replies Saulos calmly, taking another sip of his tea. "The tea is excellent. I intend to take my time in enjoying it." He smiles, lapsing again into silence.

Gallius nods slightly and turns her attention to the tea once more, wondering what she might learn in the libraries, with the right help. She has heard of great libraries, and knows enough to admit that she could take a hundred years to find what a knowledgeable man or woman could tell her in just one afternoon.

"There are lies of omission and lies of commission. Any leader of men understands the value of a lie of omission," remarks Saulos, as he puts his tea-cup down. "To attain your objective, subterfuge is an acceptable tool."

"But will an Immaculate Monk respect me when he learns that I am both anathema and liar?" muses Gallius curiously. "It is not enough for me to find the answers. Many of my kind could tear the truth from someone, I imagine. I would rather do what I do differently. Even if I use tricks and illusion to achieve a goal, I wish the end result to be honorable. I wish to make friends of those I believe are honorable."

"Respect, young lady, is earned," comments the General in a faint voice. "It is earned by your actions, and in spite of all that you've done or all that you may be, your good character will shine through. And those who may be bitter over past wrongs can still find it in themselves to respect you anyway, if you are worthy of it." He smiles, and glances up. "Isn't that right, Alcis?" he asks with a wink. The Terrestrial only stares down at her tea, saying nothing, a faint blush coloring her cheeks. It seems she's been found out.

Gallius pretends not to notice, her eyes studying the surface of her tea. "Very well. I will go under this pretense and learn whatever this monk is willing to teach. Do not worry, though, Lady Alcis, it will not interfere in my duties to the people of Greyfalls."
