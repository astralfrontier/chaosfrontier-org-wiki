# Gods of Eden 2004-02-13

Gallius isn't sure just how much hope there is in secrecy for her. What she is has become somewhat well known, so the Immaculates may all know of her. At least with Alcis' letter they may be inclined to give her some attention. With more than a bit of hope, Gallius will make her way to the school that the Immaculates are known to run. She's helped them already, though she wasn't completely aware of every place that the jade was going to. She knocks at the door, waiting to be acknowledged.

An acolyte dutifully answers the door, mumbling a welcome. The young boy sounds tired, and he escorts Gallius inside with a minimum of politeness or enthusiasm. The reason for the lad's exhaustion becomes clear, as Gallius navigates the corridors and emerges into the courtyard of the school. Everywhere there are wounded and ill people being tended by the monks. While ordinarily the Immaculates and their lay brothers minister to the soul, at the moment they are tending the body as well. At the center of the courtyard is a shiny jade box, shimmering with a haze of Essence; it seems to be for those who have lost limbs in the warfare that preceded this uneasy peace, for a patient's leg is slowly but surely being regenerated as it lays inside the gap on one side.

Gallius looks around and frowns in worry. So many injured that the leeches are overwhelmed everywhere. At least things are slowly improving, and these men are obviously being very well treated. She says nothing, being far from skilled enough to offer any aid in medicine.

Gallius will say to the young boy, "I was advised that I might learn more of the Immaculate Order in this place, but it seems everyone is terribly busy. Are there any monks who might spare me a moment? If not, perhaps I can offer assistance. I am no healer, but I believe there are things I might do until someone has time to see me."

"I'll take you to the master's aide," murmurs the acolyte, and he leads the way. The master, the senior Immaculate monk here, is even now tending the wounded. The aide turns out to be a mousy young woman, a lay sister of the order, who is busy at a desk and looks like she's ready to panic. A brief conversation follows, and Gallius quickly finds herself leading a wagon through the city, gathering water from the nearby reservoir into ceramic jugs and hauling it back toward the school. From there the water is dispensed to the monks and other healers, both for mundane purposes and as part of the healing magics they practice. "We could use some wood too," remarks the aide, upon meeting Gallius at the gate.

Gallius nods to the aide, "Of course. I will find all that I can for you." Oddly, this makes her feel much more comfortable. It reminds her of home, in a way. And these are things she can do to make a difference. The mundane nature of it makes it seem more honest and worthwhile to her, as well. She'll take the wagon out once more to seek wood. An axe is also taken, of course.

The work is not swift. Roleyn and the Marukani are gone, and somehow Gallius feels that this is really something she should be doing herself, anyway. Fortunately she's more than capable of handling herself and loads the wagon up pretty quickly. At least compared to what a normal woman her size could.

With the wagon-load carried into town, Gallius and a few of the other Immaculate acolytes begin to unload it quickly and deal with it. Gallius uses axe-work to chop the wood into bricks and smaller chunks, while the acolytes busy themselves with the work of carrying it to the monks. In her few moments of rest, the war-leader observes just what they are doing with it - the healers are applying water, wood, fire, earth and even directed air, thanks to paper fans, to the bodies of the wounded. Each cries out in pain at the touch of the flames, but that pain almost instantaneously subsides as the monk casts his or her restorative magics. After even a handful of such healings, the sorcerers must rest, and in one corner of the court-yard, a few of them can be found in meditative poses, Hearthstones sparkling on their breasts or in tiaras.

Gallius does what she can, which right now is observe and not interrupt those who are healing. She asks one of the other aides, "Has this been happening since the battle started?" She sees she wasn't wrong in one judgement, these dragon-blooded are not evil. They are doing everything they can to help these men.

"More or less," comments the acolyte, a girl of no more than fifteen summers. "War is always hard." Her face is dirty and there's a sad look in her eyes.

Gallius nods, "It is very hard, whether you win or lose," she says quietly. "But we must hope for peace." Gallius offers a hand to the acolyte, "I'm Lady Leom. What is your name?"

"Sala," the girl answers, shaking with a soft grip. "Thank you for helping us, my lady."

"Thank you for letting me," answers Gallius. "I feel foolish, I never thought to use my time here before, and I could have been of aid. At least I am here now. I didn't realize there were so many monks in the city. It is good fortune."

---

The work proceeds apace, even into the evening hours. As the sun burns lower on the horizon and eventually vanishes, torches are lit to supply the healers with illumination. Gallius' Solar-granted time sense counts almost three hours past sunset before the monks finally break apart, drifting toward their communal room to partake of food and drink. The acolytes, too, are meant to go, and Gallius is invited along.

Gallius will go with, grateful for the invitation. Thankfully she has a fair measure of endurance, or she'd be worn quite badly by this time. She feels pity for the others who are here, working through terrible exhaustion.

At the tables, the monks and others eat quickly and quietly, refilling their expended reserves of fatigue with food and drink. For Gallius, accustomed to a "normal" diet, the spartan rice, vegetables, and other foods on the table are an unusual taste experience. The monks, however, seem quite content with the fare, and the Solar's own body won't resist the nourishment the table proffers, in spite of its effect on her palate.

Gallius will deal with the light fare. It's not food she came here for. She hungers for something far more important. She watches the others at the table, trying to figure out what ceremonies might exist and do her best to match them or at least not offend.

As a body, the monks are remarkably humble, compared to the Dragon-Blooded of Gallius' memory and expectations. They carry themselves like lordlings, it is true, in their gait and in other ways, and yet there is a lack of haughtiness. These men and women stand on high ground, in their own eyes. And yet when they look at those lower than they, it is with mercy, not contempt. The acolytes and mortals who serve here treat the Exalted monks with due deference, yet there are few traces of resentment.

Gallius approves of this, and grows more confident with each moment that she's come to the right place. That these wise men and women can help and may even be willing to help her knowing what she is. Still, she's not going to be foolish. When there is an opportunity, she will draw out her letter and say, "I know you are very tired and you have little time, but I was advised by someone I trust that I could learn much here. I seek answers to many things, and I think I might find them with the guidance of those here. Lady Alcis is the one who advised me to come to you."

Some of the monks look at each other. It is clear that the name of Alcis will not unlock every door here, but at last one clears her throat and speaks. "Come with me, Lady Leom," this woman says. "We will finish dining in my quarters, and we will speak of what you have come for." She rises, taking with her a selection of food and drink, and leads the way once her guest is prepared.

Gallius didn't truly expect any doors to unlock so easily. She merely hoped for the right to earn her place here. She rises smoothly and will follow the monk obediently. She wonders to herself what this will lead to. She can't help but hope for the best, now, though. She likes these monks, even if they hate her and her kind. They have quite valid reasons for it.

The woman's quarters are spartan, but not terribly austere. She sleeps on what looks like a normal bed; a wooden sparring-dummy can be found in one corner of the room, as can numerous books, on an ornately-crafted bookshelf. A coat of arms hangs on one wall. Several cushions and a low table are available for guests, and the monk avails herself of one, kneeling comfortably into place on it and setting her food down. She gestures for Gallius to follow, and looks on expectantly.

Gallius settles near the table and meets the eyes of the monk, studying them for just a moment. She says simply, "I asked Lady Alcis where I might learn of your order. I seek knowledge of the past. I feel that to have any hope to have a favorable future, I must understand what has already come to pass. There are many things I wonder, some of my questions are already answered, just by working here today." She adds with a bit of a blush, "I hope my abruptness did not offend anyone. I wasn't sure when I should ask."

The woman smiles. Her hair is a lustrous green shade, and she wears garb similarly colored, elegant in its simplicity. The comments seem to lift some weight from her, revealing the feminine beneath the weight of exhaustion and duty. "Well, I don't think anyone is offended. Curious, certainly. Tell me what knowledge you seek, and I will offer what I can."

"I fear in a way you should treat me like a child, because I am ignorant," says Gallius. "But I wish to know of the history of the Immaculate Order. I want to know what you believe in, I guess. I come from the east, and I have only a few stories to go by, and I already know that most of what I was told is very inaccurate. I admire what you do here, and I am very impressed. I want to learn the truth, so I can enlighten my people."

The monk rises from her seat, proceeding to the bookcase. She withdraws a slim volume and kneels again, presenting the book to her guest. It is a primer on the Immaculate Order, a basic teaching tool meant for apprentices and acolytes to learn from. "Normally we are instructed by tutors as well as guided by the books," she explains. "If you wish to join the Order, we would welcome you. If not, however, I hope this helps. Please, ask about anything you don't understand."

"You mean I could come here and ask questions of you any time?" asks Gallius. "I think I'd like that. I'm sure I will have many questions. My other duties are becoming far less demanding, so I hope to spend more time here. I need to learn all I can, and time always seems to be against me."

The woman nods, smiling. "Yes, you are welcome. I am Oaken Claw, daughter of the dragons, and I am at your service, Lady." She still hasn't touched the food; politeness dictates that her guest signal her readiness to join in eating, or to depart.

Gallius smiles, "Thank you, Oaken Claw. Are all monks called children of the dragons, then?" She looks down at the food and suggests, "Please, don't let me delay your meal. You have been so polite to offer me this much, I will be shamed to distract you. You have all done so much today, and will have so much to do tomorrow."

And with that the woman smiles, and continues eating. She chews and drinks sparingly, nourishing her body in a regular rhythm, watching her guest between bites with a curious expression on her face.

Gallius looks over the book, running a hand over the cover. She opens it, looking over the fine work. She smiles, reading the first few paragraphs with care. "I have so much to learn about the world. Wisdom is a very long way off." But she has more faith now than she did before. "Were there any other questions you have of me, Oaken Claw? Is there a title I should be using when I speak to you? I know nothing of hierarchy in the Order."

"My name is enough," the woman says, smiling. "Our secular cousins in the government of the Blessed Realm do not insist on a great plethora of titles, and we follow suit. Spiritual enlightenment is what distinguishes us, rather than rank."

"What brings joy to you, Oaken Claw? What pleases the Order?" asks Gallius. She feels her questions might sound strange, but she's eager to make good use of this time.

"Ensuring that we do not dishonor our place in Creation," answers the monk with a smile. She puts her food down to speak at greater length. "The Dragon-Blooded are those souls who have reincarnated after finding spiritual enlightenment. For their efforts in their past lives, they are rewarded with power in this one. The Order is pleased most by harmony, and to achieve it, we monks are expected to use our Dragon-given gifts as wisely as we can. As for myself, I find great comfort in reading and studying, and traveling when possible. But my life belongs to the Order, in the end, and I must put my wishes aside when it is necessary."

"That seems very admirable, to me," says Gallius. "Are you calm and content, Oaken Claw? It seems you are so certain of yourself, like nothing could upset you." Though Gallius imagines finding out that she's teaching an anathema might..

"I wish I was," sighs the monk, then smiles. "Internal peace is one thing we strive for, but few of us will ever truly know. It is torment to see your goal and yet be so far from it, and yet we all must continue to try."

"You are much closer than I am, at least. I am constantly in conflict," says Gallius. "I am used to fighting and battle, and it seems that even when there is no strife about me there is much inside. I hope that by learning more from you I might dampen these problems. I want to know calm again. I haven't felt fully comfortable in a very long time." The solar smiles, "I have a lot to learn."
