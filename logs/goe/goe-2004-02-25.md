# Gods of Eden 2004-02-25

The cold white winds of Resplendent Air blow and swirl over the skyscape of Nexus, like frustrated vultures hungrily eyeing the atmosphere of heat below and wishing it would finally die. The city, for its part, continues to cheerily pump out vents of steam, waves upon waves of heat, and even blistering pillars of fire from some part of the industrial base that makes up the city's lower levels (physical and social). It is a vast, loosely built web of greed, skill and ambition, a spider-web dangling across the hills at the intersection of two rivers, happy to catch whatever flies drift into its net.

High on the hills, at a more rarefied altitude than the nose of the typical Nexan will be privileged to enjoy, the four Solars and their carriage clatter through the gates of Bastion and toward their appointment. Each is well and properly dressed. They arrive, make themselves known to the butler, and are ushered into a stately chamber to await the pleasure of their hostess. The door clicks shut behind them.

Rumika will wait as patiently as she can, musing over what she's seen of this odd city. "So many pages, and yet it's not even a chapter," she whispers aloud, revealing her thoughts.

"I suspect it won't be long now," muses Ramar as he waits patiently. He turns his head about, making note of the waiting chamber and the message it hopes to convey to those waiting therein. "Just long enough to let us know how important we are, or are not, today. What will we ask to begin with?"

At least in the throngs of the streets, the unaccustomed sheer size of many peoples of many cultures, there was a sense of understanding and connection. However, standing in the well furnished room in clothes rich enough to purchase all he previously owned, Chi-Yosh is out of his element. Even though he believes the trappings of the room around him are unnecessary, even dangerously distracting, a thought finds him. There is a similar vein between the mortal vanity and presentation and he; while Soras Minan is quite wealthy and sits in lap of luxury, as do the Solars in the Celestial Bureaucracy; they are the kings of the world of men. The wonders of the world are one with them. The thought puts him at ease.

The socialite enters, and greets each of her guests cordially, smiling. "Welcome, one and all," she says, while her butler moves to begin pouring drinks. "Please, sit," and her hand sweeps inclusively around, indicating the divans and other seats available. "A drink first, and then you can tell me all about yourselves."

Rumika curtseys politely and settles herself with care. With a graceful hand she accepts a glass of wine. She smiles and wafts it, collecting its fragrance before she actually takes her first drink.

"We are honored to be welcomed here," says Ramar, with a bow of the head. A gesture towards lavish furnishing precedes the claiming of a simple drink. He sits, and as he does, he breathes in, attuning himself to the flow of words and motives building within the room. "So... what do you wish to know...?"

As the man who has the most at stake in this venture, Davron finds himself in the unfamiliar and somewhat uncomfortable position as spokesman for the Circle. Uncertainly at first, but then with increasing passion, he fleshes out the brief description of his dilemma that was given at the salon. The fact that it's his own flesh and blood at stake is a fact Davron couldn't begin to conceal, even if he wanted to - but the thousands of men and women held prisoner against their will has touched his heart as well, and he lets that come through in his voice. "I don't know what it is you can do for them, Soras Minan, but whatever you can do... I will be in your debt."

The woman withdraws into herself, drinking very slowly from the crystal in her hand. Her eyes are downcast as she considers. "I cannot help you," she says at last, "unless you can find a way to do something for me. Something that would permit the Council of Entities to intervene. It would be dangerous. Do you know men or women who would undertake such a task?"

Rumika listens with concern, reaching out to put a gloved hand on Davron's shoulder when she speaks. To the lady she says, "We know some who may be able to achieve such a task. If it is safe to name here, tell us this duty and we will see it achieved in whatever ways present themselves."

Soras Minan turns, and nods; her butler removes himself from the room. Minutes pass, and finally he returns, nodding. Only then does she speak. "House Cynis has people here, and in Great Forks. It is they, and only they, who could receive such a body of captives. For years now I have sought to uncover the records buried in their vaults - evidence enough that the 'servants' they take into the city are indeed slaves. Lay hold on these, and they must flee the city. I can do the rest, I think."

Ramar merely observes for now. This is a dangerous business being discussed here. A subtle clue in the tone of voice or the wavering expressions on a face must not be missed. He is silent, though it's a studious silence as gaze darts from person to person. As Soras Minan describes what is to happen, he breaks the silence and asks, "Is there more that you can provide us to aid you in recovering these records? Information as to the vaults and the like..."

"I do not," the lady remarks, with a frown. "All I can tell you is the location of their safe-house, the headquarters they think is secret from me, and the place from which their operations are directed in this city. What is inside, I do not know."

Chi-Yosh finds the deck stacked against them, for this task. But it is the nature of the Solars now to rebuild the deck from the ground up. "We thank you for this valuable information. We will assure you the best that we deem worthy of this challenge will be put to the task. With your help, we can cure the illness of Slavery on such a great scale."

The lady rises, and begins writing with a feathered quill on a scrap of paper. This note she presses into Davron's hands with bright eyes. "I will not fail, and if there is even a chance of success..."

"We may have to become acquainted with House Cynis, at least to learn from them, that we might pass this information on to those chosen. Unless the safe-house is easy enough to gain access to." Ramar nods, slowly, thoughtfully. His fingers tap idly along the edge of his chin. "Might I ask if there are those who we should be wary of dealing with among the house? Those who should be avoided outright?"

"There are those of the Exalted among them," Minan says. "It is said they traffic with other, stranger entities and spirits as well."

Rumika rises as the lady does, standing politely until the hostess either sits again or departs. To her, this meeting is no adjourned. House Cynis, it is. They have weaknesses aplenty, and one of them is right up Rumika's alley.

Davron takes the note and bows deeply. "I thank you, my lady. I knew in my heart that I would do anything to save my cousin, and those who are held with her. Now that I begin to see what 'anything' may mean, I am daunted... but while there is breath in my body, I will see it done."

"It seems our meeting is ending much too soon," replies Ramar as he stands. He smiles, bows his head, then lifts his glass to the others. "To endings and beginnings. May they both be happy, and turn out the way we hope."

"To endings; may they come with ease and new beginnings." Chi-Yosh toasts, but his mind isn't in it; all ready whirling with a way to deal with the safe-house. How he wishes Marina were still with their band. But still united, they are strong. The four depart from Soras Minan's estate, and within the carriage, the Dawn begins. "Ramar, you are apt with words. Circulate around the Cynis headquarters, speak to the neighbors, the servants, the average people who go to bars and shops and find what you might. Rumors, opinions, experiences. Davron, you can see into the veil of magic; let your sorcerous eye follow the outside of the building to look for defenses, presences of the Exalt, Spirit or otherwise. Rumika, your magic gives the gift of unsight; follow Davron's instruction on a safe way in, and scout ahead."

Ramar nods, slowly. "Very well then. I shall see what can be found out... but what will you be doing while we busy ourselves, I wonder?"

"No doubt they have a host of spirits and lackeys to make their places safe," says Rumika softly. "It may be far more dangerous to scout than you imagine. I have learned that I cannot always rely on magic when dealing with these things. Much care will have to be taken in finding that safe way inside. Perhaps I could go in another fashion to get past the outer barriers, however, it they are too strong."

---

Late nights are a bad time to sneak in this matter, perhaps, but it's still rather logical. Rumika goes with Davron, leading him stealthily across the city. She doesn't use the streets save when necessary, but instead winds about the rooftops, making her path next to impossible to follow. Finding a good vantage point near the House Cynis safehouse, she allows Davron to see what he might even as she calls gently upon her friend Leyi to have a look as well.

The afternoon is a time of chilled breezes and grey skies. These matter little to the inhabitants of the city themselves-the heat from the vents, from the manufacturing, and other less reputable sources is more than enough to warm those wandering the streets. The smell... is another story entirely. So it is that Ramar wanders these warmed streets, flowing amid the river of relationships and conversations that make up portions of the community. He'll study an eddy of swirling gossip, then carefully navigate around the rocks of suspicion and doubt as they encounter his path. He'll converse, seeking out those who are willing to boast about the unstoppable might of House Cynis, and of those willing to tear it down for every little fault they can find. These are sources of information, information to be analyzed and sorted, but treasures one and all...

Davron pauses on the rooftop beside Rumika, and closes his eyes, meditating on the inner flame of his Essence in the way that has come so naturally to him... as if he knew it all along. When he opens his eyes once more, they see not only the world of light and color, but the unseen comings and goings of the little gods. In a city as busy and tumultuous as Nexus, plenty of such beings are to be seen everywhere he looks - but it is the business of those which may be patrolling the safe-house below that interest him most. Lookouts, guards, messengers... all of the various functionaries that appear to have business in the slaver's headquarters are subjected to Davron's occult scrutiny.

Chi-Yosh sits cross-legged under the awning behind a small shrine. Rather than constructing walls, rugs of simple make have been hung to make for privacy, interwoven into the threads a promise of silence. Before him are pebbles and dirt from the earth outside, layed out in a circle. Water from one of the mighty Nexus rivers is poured over, each drop made in a pattern. Chanting rises up from the Su'Katan as he tosses pinches of road dust over the symbol. As Davron had perceived the lands of the Little Gods, Chi-Yosh had asked for one pointed out, detailed. Thusly aided, Chi-Yosh set to finding out the ways of the spirit, and within several hours, began the summons.

Water is an element of communication and pan-presence. Rivers flow through uncounted lands; much of the heart of mankind's prosperity sails atop oceans. The waterways in Nexus serve as roads to many. The invocation of a spirit takes time, indeed, but at length a curling tendril of water can be seen rising from the damp soil, and particles of dirt and dust come with it. "Speak," comes a hollow voice from within the shrine.

"Spirit of Nexus's clear blood, I seek the Chosen of Luna that claim Nexus as their home." Chi-Yosh's voice is quiet, but sure, and worn on his brow is the blessing of Helios. Let him show his face for the spirit, for hiding would be disgrace.

"Your name, wanderer?" the spirit asks. It is not a challenge; there's a sense that the spirit will deliver a message, rather than make its own decisions in this matter. This alone gives Chi-Yosh a measure of hope.

"I am Chi-Yosh, Protector of the Maze Forest, Nain-ya of the Full Moon." For the first time, and many times to come on this trip, the Dawn has claimed his title gifted by Weeping Prowler to another.

"I will see to it," says the spirit, and disappears just as suddenly as it came. "Dip your hand into the waterways of the city at dusk, and you will be answered."

In thanks, Chi-Yosh calls to the spirit, "May your waters stay pure and healthy, Spirit of Nexus's Clear Blood."

---

The party gathers again, to review what they have learned. The abandoned temple, a structure of the First Age city of Hollow, has been claimed many times, but it is now being held - officially - by livestock traders and cultists from the Southeast. This temple is the secret headquarters of House Cynis, and it has openings on both the street and into the waterways of the city. Many spirits can be found around it, but not within; the temple itself is a spiritual shield of surpassing potency. Few people are seen to enter or leave, and no unusual sounds are heard from its depths. Wherever House Cynis conducts its debauches, this structure is free of such things.

Davron spits, as Ramar explains his findings. "Livestock? _Livestock?_ Those bastards! How dare they..." he begins, then subsides... but just a little. "No doubt they think it's funny, that little joke of theirs. Oh, I can't wait to see that joke rubbed in their face..." He takes a deep breath. "Sorry, Ramar. Continue."

As part of Ramar's investigation, he tipped a beggar a few pieces of silver and sent him, dressed rather better than before, to the door of the safe-house, ostensibly to do business with the traders. The beggar was turned back, and the men guarding the door claimed that only those who had verifiably concluded large transactions with the company were welcome - that the building was only for conducting the latter part of such business.

"Well, we have a few options," says Rumika. "From what Ramar tells us, we may try to play at buying a great deal of slaves and gain access. This will require some creative use of funds that we don't precisely have." She considers and then goes on, "The other option is to enter it by force of stealth or strength. It is hard to say what is inside. I do not know how potent you are in war, but if you are very strong, this way may be fastest. In any case, when the truth is known, the guilty shall be torn apart in all likelihood. As for stealth, I can guard us from sight, but that is no sure way to enter this place, and it is limited in length."

"True. Then perhaps we shall have to combine these options into a plan with several redundancies and contingencies. We could enter on the pretense of buying many, and use stealth and strength to push our way inside... reconnaissance on the place is likely going to be difficult beforehand, so we may well have to continue planning on the fly." Ramar takes a breath, nods to Rumika, "I like what we have come up with so far. Such as it is."

Chi-Yosh licks his lips. "The Lunars of the city might know something, but asking of such a task as a lowly new Exalt in the eyes of other Lunars, it likely would not work." Looking from one face to the other in his circle, "I hesitate about using strenght. While we are powerful, that might raise the hackles of the Council of Entities, at least in getting in. If we are stopped before we reach the vaults... I feel stealth is our best option, until it's no longer an option."

Davron frowns and rubs his chin. "We are no laggards in the matter of physical strength, but there are but few of us. Their stronghold is probably well manned, probably with at least some guardians with the use of Essence. More than that, though, I fear making a commotion and drawing undue attention to ourselves." He chuckles. "Though even for all that, it may prove the least perilous of many perilous options."

"But your source said we go at the conclusion, and not before," says Rumika. "Unless you are hiding a mountain of jade or silver in your pockets--unlikely--we must find a way in without that." She smiles at Ramar and hmms, "I can bar us from sight, but they must open the door and leave us room to enter. And once inside.. what then? I cannot work my magic without being seen by most. Surely the Entities will know immediately."

"Then we shall simply have to use what Stealth we can. Mundane or otherwise. Likely as not we will be spotted. Perhaps word from the Lunars in this town might lead to new options. Some of them, I should hope, would be happy to aid us." Ramar shrugs. "I could very well be wrong."

An idea bubbles to the top of Chi-Yosh's mind, though it is not a pleasant one, and while his hesitation to air it is great, there are more matters at hand. "Rumika, would it be possible for you to get into the compound, and then let us in before? We have had others turned aside, but what if we had someone pose as the true goods House Cynis wants?"

"That would be.. an interesting way to do things," says Rumika softly. "It might be a little difficult, but it could be arranged. The main issue is getting me in their hands. And, I point out again, that it does not seem that the bulk of the transaction occurs here. I am unsure if I would be kept inside."

"Perhaps... but as has been said, this is where the conclusion of the business takes place." Ramar pauses thoughtfully, "It would be terribly risky. Perhaps we can simply find an alternate way inside." He glances about, "You know who I'm thinking could help us gain entrance... Rabby. Has anyone seen hide or hair of her lately?"

Davron's eyes widen, and his cheeks color. "Chi-Yosh --" he begins sharply, then turns to Rumika as it becomes clear that she's considering the proposal seriously. He seems unable to speak for several long seconds, then says just as softly. "It sounds... terribly dangerous, Rumika. And... if you fall into danger once inside, I don't know if I-- if we can break in in time..."

Rumika laughs softly and considers Davron, "You forget, perhaps, to whom you speak. I am not quite a delicate princess." She stretches and sighs, "If I were certain it would work, I would early risk it. I just am not sure, and I hate to complicate things by failing and requiring another rescue."

Ramar says, "It seems to me that if we can get the door open... we can get in." A frown crosses Ramar's features, "You know, we seem to have more trouble opening doors than just about anything else..."

Chi-Yosh frowns inwardly. Rabby has been hidden since his earlier exposure to the mob. With her hidden, it is no help. "If nothing else, we must find Rabby eventually. Though it may be a team effort to corner her."

---

At dusk, as requested, Chi-Yosh finds a secluded water-way and dips his hand into the stream of filthy sludge that flows past. It's suddenly gripped, and a humanoid figure hauls himself out of the waterway. The surface of the flow is deceptively dirty; the man himself is naked, but hardly covered by the muck and grime one would expect. "You're none of Luna's," are the first words out of his mouth, after a few seconds of examination.

Chi-Yosh helps the man to his feet, and is respectful enough not to flick his slimey fingers in disgust. "I was not Blessed by Luna herself, but I have earned the beginnings of respect for her. I am Nain-ya, initiated by Weeping Prowler of the Maze Forest."

"That so?" The man's eyebrows elevate considerably. "He's awake? Well then... here I am. Speak."

Chi-Yosh offers a nod of respect to the man. "Three things. First, I am but a weaned pup in the moonlight, I have yet done anything for the Children of Luna. I wish to change that, and offer my hands before those here in Nexus. Second, my circle has brought a young lunar, a woman named Rabby, and she's disappeared; cats are very good at hiding."

"And third..." Ramar chimes in, taking a moment to introduce himself as a Changing Moon, intiated by Weeping Prowler and so forth. He then spins the tales that those Changing Moons, even the nain-ya, are famous for, bringing up the wicked deeds of the slavers and the secret dealings of the House. "We were wondering if we might be able to get help getting through the door. Or a means of finding out more information, if such can be asked of you."

"Rabby? That explains much," laughs the Lunar. "I know who you are now, 'Torch'. Well. If I and my friends got you in, what could you two do, do you suppose?"

Chi-Yosh's smile is both sheepish and friendly. "Like I said, a weaned pup in the moonlight." He gestures to Ramar, and then himself. "We are part of a circle who are seeking to ruin House Cynis; slaves are coming to be sold near the city, and Cynis is behind it. Within their compound is evidence ripe for the eyes of the Council of Entities."

Ramar cannot help but grin. He turns and raises an eyebrow at Chi-Yosh. "Well, Torch," he says, placing more emphasis then necessary on the word, "and I, if we got in would be headed towards their vault to... take steps to bring proof to the Council that the 'servants' are in fact slaves. These steps, hopefully will be quiet and not noticed until it's much too late."

"You don't seem like the sort to stay in Nexus too long. I doubt anyone will come looking for us if we just aid you. Take the heat for whatever you have in mind, and we'll assist you," the man says, then spits on his hand and thrusts it out.

Ramar spits in his hand, and then goes to shake the outstretched hand. "Alright then. You've my word. Thank you for your help."
