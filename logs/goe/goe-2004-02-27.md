# Gods of Eden 2004-02-27

The words from Valon are enough. The restless noon will not wait. Gallius makes for the Lesser Rock River. Time is not wasted. She calls upon essence, flooding herself so that the mark of her caste shines and the lion stands menacingly about her. She strides into the river itself, waiting for the spirit to awaken.

As before, the river responds, sensing the appearance of a power in its midst. Rising like a tremendous fountain, the spirit manifests itself. Gallius stands in the water, looking up at the spirit. She politely speaks to the spirit, who has not forgetten those who spared him much trouble. A way to maintain the favor of the lady is taken with interest, and so Gallius finds herself warded. Scant advice can be given, save the obvious. The River Spirit has not been on the borders of the forming world.

Gallius finds herself on an airship in short order. The piloting she leaves to others, as usual. Also as usual, she at the front of the ship, staring ahead.

---

"Here is where the elders sometimes come," says Valon. The sky-ship hovers over the treetops of the Uttermost East, and the Lunar peers over the rail, pointing through the thick green canopy. "There's no actual ground down there. Beyond this point, it's a cliff that just goes straight down, forever. The trees still grow, though. Hell if anyone knows how they get nourishment or stability. It may not even matter." The big man paces thoughtfully, finally returning to the rail again for another look downward. "You ready?"

Gallius smiles, "I have not been ready since I was spared from death. I have learned that readiness is of no particular importance. I am, and that is enough." She looks over the rail, "So.. do I simply leap down?" she asks.

"Not quite yet," grins Non Valon as he boards his Warstrider. Carefully he waits for Gallius and Jin-nu to clamber on, before unlatching the hooks that keep the enormous armor attached to the airship. There's a sudden whistling as it drops away; looking up, Gallius can see it disappearing through the verdant shield of the treetops. The strider plummets past trees and branches and greenery, dropping into darkness at a hellish rate of acceleration. "Any time now!" yells Valon, straining over the whistling wind to make himself heard. And then, the strider strikes ground. And breaks through, as though it were dropping through an ocean of dirt. The soil gives no more resistance than the waves would. Down and down and down, until the very bowels of Creation itself must have been reached. Slowly Gallius' perception of motion changes; rather than down, they are going forward.

The strider emerges from an embankment of dirt, and Gallius and Jin-nu shake themselves clear of the clinging mud of the soil behind them. Ahead of them is a brackish fen, the product of a filthy ocean's leavings on low terrain. Ferns and vines grow here in abundance, and rather than fruits, some of the vines sprout miniature, stylized human faces.

"This is the madness of the Wyld," muses Gallius. She strides slowly forward, pausing to consider the curious fruit of the twisted flora. "I did not expect it to be even this real," she says evenly. "I imagine that one must go further in to see things of more value?"

The air is musty and dry, barely fit for human use. Still, there is no difficulty in breathing it for now. "We're on the Bordermarches," explains Valon, sounding rather more cautious than his usual affable self. "Most things here will be fairly ordinary. No great surprises - those will come later." A thick, hateful mist curls about the fen, obscuring sights in the distance. Every direction seems to be the same; no comforting Sun can be seen, though Gallius' sense of the cycles of her patron god is still accurate, and she can feel the time of day.

"Then I must move on. Time is not waiting on me," says Gallius. She moves warily, studying her surroundings carefully. She imagines Valon did not bring his warstrider for amusement, after all.

The fen gives way to odder things, as the trio move deeper into the strange and forbidding landscape. Sometimes Gallius can hear a nearby cry, such as a bird's caw; other times, that cry seems to come from two opposite directions at once, as though twin creatures were circling about the company from a distance. The mist parts slowly for the travellers, closing off and obscuring the fen behind them. Here the terrain grows dryer, though no more hospitable, and the bark of passing trees is colored like candy-stripes rather than good and wholesome wood.

As she walks, Gallius can feel the strange place insinuating itself into her body, carried via the breath she draws, or the light of the sights she sees. The seeds of ungoverned change stir inside her breast, the death of some grand illusion called "reality". Nevertheless she takes comfort from the golden glow of her Essence, warming her heart and spreading outward through her limbs to reinforce the reality that is she. Valon says nothing, guiding his massive armor through the trees. The trio emerge at last on the edge of a cliff, over which can be seen nothing but mist in a tremendous valley. Off in the far distance, mountain-tops, capped with snow or greenery can be seen; other such mountain crowns are more different, such as one that is vomiting lava forth, or one in the shape of an upraised fist. "Do as I do, and watch carefully," commands Valon, then steps over the edge of the cliff.

The warstrider does not plummet; it's apparent what Valon is doing, though it seems impossible - one foot is now planted firmly on the cliff-side, and he is guiding the strider down in this fashion, walking sideways down the cliff face as though he were upright on solid ground.

Gallius arches an eyebrow. She doesn't hesitate, however. Here, reality is a useless concept. She steps over the cliff, swinging with a rather exaggerated step so that she walks no on what had been a vertical face. 'If one can die and still live, why not walk down the side of a cliff in a world that is not yet real?' she thinks to herself.

Jin-nu follows with the most natural ease of all, for she not only accepts the lack of reality that is here, but thrives and relishes it. Here in chaos the Wylding is reminded somewhat of her own origins, though the truth of the matter lost in the swirls of a world still trying to be born.

The trek down the cliff-side takes the small party through the mist. The crushing sound of Valon's 'steed' striking stone is the loudest sound that can be heard; there is a complete lack of breathing, even in the sound-echoing mists, and more than once Gallius checks herself to be sure she's still taking in air. The mists finally clear and the three step off the cliff face with only minor difficulty, finding themselves in a strange place indeed. It would be a field of grass, if each blade of grass consisted of a forefinger thrust defiantly up out of the ground. The fingers wave delicately, twitching and writhing about in slow motion. The fingernails are somewhat crusted with dirt, on closer inspection, though the skin is very pale indeed. Nearby can be seen hints of a river.

"I had half-hoped that the Wyld would be a place that hid some beauty," says Gallius. "But here there is only mockery and grotesque twisting of the world that Is." She frowns at the disgusting 'grass' and looks ahead, "Sure this is a fitting prison for the Fair Folk to be stuck in."

More oddness can be seen at the river; birds are what can be seen darting under the surface of it, dashing back and forth as they swim down-stream. The river has a rope bridge for crossing it, but this is both useless and disconcerting. The rope bridge is apparently intact, and hangs halfway across the river's distance. Beyond that, it disappears - cut off, invisible, or something else. Nevertheless, Valon's Warstrider is easily able to cross the distance. Beyond, another field awaits the travelers. Rather than fingers, tiny men, dressed as soldiers, are assembled in mathematically precise rows. Thousands upon thousands of these diminuitive figures are visible; as they see the questors approach, their commanders bark out orders, and legion after legion of the two-inch warriors march aside in lockstep to clear a path.

Gallius marches through all these things, studying the eerie land. A silence falls upon her, and she imagines that in a place like this, even the best of men would go insane eventually.

Rock walls rise high beyond the field of soldiers; a narrow defile permits passage. In the canyon beyond are butterflies, composed entirely of silk and spiderwebs, that dance ethereally on the soft winds that blow through the canyon. Valon's Warstrider can barely fit through, and it is slow going for him. The butterflies flicker and flit about Gallius especially, and after a time a number of them converge on her, their wings touching each other for just a moment, crafting a silk dress of a kind. Then they break apart in an explosion of motion, with each creature returning to the air and dancing about on the winds joyfully.

"We're approaching an outpost of the Fair Folk," remarks Valon. "It will be better to avoid them. Gallius, you will want to mount up on your steed, just in case."

Gallius marvels at the butterflies and considers Valon curiously. "An outpost? Is it true they enslave men and women in such places and devour them?" asks Gallius. She swings upon the back of Jin-nu, then, looking about, hoping to see whatever outpost might lie near.

"They devour dreams," replies Valon, walking as softly as he can while wearing armor seven yards in tall. "Few mortals would come this far." The valley broadens outward, and Gallius can perceive that ahead of them is the center-point of a convergence of five almost identical canyons. At the center is a broad expanse, wherein is a lake. A spout or column of water rises from its surface, supporting a castle of crystal and brass, whose pennant-flag is sheerest gossamer and whose battlements are half-translucent.

The seed grows no weaker, but also no stronger; Gallius can feel the essence of this place trying to infuse itself into her very bones, as though vines or tendrils had reached up from the soil beneath her feet and twined themselves about inside her body. Nevertheless she resists, using all that makes her Exalted of the Unconquered Sun. Valon is leading the way, and Jin-nu looks troubled as she advances. No scouts or observers can be discerned atop the battlements of the outpost; satisfied, Valon pushes forward, daring a rapid run toward another of the canyons. Once safe, the party continues. The canyon ends in a toothy maw, a gaping mouth of stone, with stalagmites and stalagtites for teeth, whose gullet is a cave. The mouth is surmounted by a fractured stone nose and two crystalline eyes. The face looks down, and the maw moves. "Welcome, ye children of Creation," it booms out.

Now there's something you don't see every day. Gallius turns to shoot Valon a curious look and then returns her attention to the cave. She answers the cave with a nod. "Well met, Wylding," she answers. For that is the only word she has for such things.

"We wish to pass through," declares Valon. "Is that so?" asks the stone-creature, drawing its mouth into a smile. "Is there some way I can aid you on your way?" Its voice is warm and deep and impossibly ancient, and its crystalline eyes twinkle.

Gallius frowns thoughtfully at the cave, wondering just how many strange things she must do in this insane unworld. She says simply, "I seek only a free path to whatever things might be seen beyond."

"Come in, then," and the mouth opens wide. Valon leads, and through darkness and depths the three move. The stone of the cave gives way to wood, with the texture of living trees but the shape of earth's hollow spaces. And finally, in the very depths of this place, Jin-nu puts a foot forward and steps on nothing at all. "We're getting close," remarks Valon.

A vast library of books, scrolls and other implements of wisdom shake Gallius from a momentary bout of disorientation. Many books leap from the shelves, their bindings and pages flapping as they fly like birds through the open space. Some of them alight, sliding into gaps on the shelves; others roost atop the shelves and stacks themselves. Looking down, Gallius can see that Jin-nu is standing atop water; below the surface of it, the sun can be seen shining. Her sense of time's passing feels skewed and separated; Helios staggers through the sky like a drunk, in her perceptions. She tries to dismount one way, and finds herself on the other side of Jin-nu from what she'd intended. A hand stretches forth to take hold of a book, which is suddenly on the other side of the room. "Now is the time to take the drug and begin your focusing," remarks Valon, referring to the supply of hallucinogen that's been brought along for this purpose.

Gallius sighs, and as she lets out her breath golden light passes from her lips instead of air. She watches the strange stuff fade away slowly. She reaches to take the drug and frowns at it. She does not trust such poisons. She reminds herself again that it is too late for her will to interfere in her destiny. With a deliberate motion she consumes the drug and draws her legs up, sitting not on the ground that seemingly lies beneath, but well above it. About her, the Wyld shifts, reacting perhaps to the sudden loosing of will and control as the lady's ability to discern anything at all is torn asunder.

Gallius reaches out, and opening her hand the entire world slowly forms. Infinitesmial elements settle there, so that for a time she can see every spire, every person. On the Blessed Isle, an angry light is starting to grow, and everywhere dark shapes move in alleyways, horsemen ride with hasty messages. Men and women die to the dagger. And still her mind drifts on.

Over Greyfalls a glimmer of light exists, just starting to grow. Here and there armies are moving, barbarians long prepared finally finding their place on the board of this giant contest of wills. But this is not what the lady seeks, and soon the land twists in her hand and tree of silver and gold springs forth, its petals singings out loud as the branches sway in still air.

About Gallius' head the elemental dragons begin to fly, long forms leaving trails of light behind them. About her head they weave themselves together, forming a tight circlet that settles on her brow. Her eyes narrow and she glares at her open palm. Again what she holds is changed, and a solid line of silver suddenly appears. Creation again appears, but this time it is cradled in but on hand. In the other, the source of the silver light appears. It comes from a city beyond match. Tower upon tower, endless lanes of palaces that shame all those in the Real. Yu-Shan is unmistakable. With each breath of Gallius the music of the very oceans can be heard, and with each breath the hand that holds Creation shifts itself, setting towers to slow disassemble themselves. Rubble leaps from the group, winding itself into vast mansions near the sea. A radiance is seen there on the moving world in resonance to the sounds of Gallius' breath.

The map begins to spin then, until all is raised up. On the other hand, Yu-Shan vanishes suddenly, and a silvery plane rises into being, standing above the world that Is. Floating above it, upside down, is a world like and yet unlike Creation. There is a darkness there that knows no light. Terrible forms move and the sea writhes as if it were rotten flesh full of serpents and maggots. Suddenly a black needle stabs through the silvery plane, and where these terrible points touch Creation, a small, black dot takes shape and slowly grows.

Creation reels and lurches; Gallius can feel herself rocking with it, growing a little dizzy as she feels the rush of Everything as it passes on the left side of her head. She falls over, or seems to; on a field of black, a single drop of water plummets from unknown reaches and strikes an invisible pool. She feels herself waking as though from a dream, and shaking her head. Here - it is here, in this cave, a terribly cold place, in the North. She can feel the bones of Creation beneath her grit-covered hands, the lines of geomancy converging on this place, on the coast of the Northern Threshold, almost eight hundred miles due south of Whitewall.

Slowly, slowly it comes. First there is the sense of touch. Her hands are clenched. She can feel blood where her nails have dug into her palms. Slowly they relax, though the sense of pain was welcome. It reminded her that she was not dead. Next is scent. She smells flowers in the air, then rancid meat. Then she hears something that she does not understand. After a time, she comes to recognize her heartbeat. Last she opens her eyes, remembering them at last. She sees in front of her Valon in his warstrider and Jin-nu, both upside down. With a blink and focus, she realligns herself and they stand in their proper places. "We should go now," she says simply.

The journey back is no more or less difficult; at the convergence of the five canyons, and in sight of the Fair Folk stronghold, however, Valon, Jin-nu and Gallius are confronted by a troblesome sight indeed: twenty-four Fair Folk warriors, arranged in rows.

"We should run," suggests Valon, quietly.

Gallius smirks. "Indeed," is her answer. She already draws upon the essence, readying herself to defend against these pitiless enemies. "A pity we cannot stand and kill them all, though," she admits, feeling her heart ache at the thought of flying from the hated Fair Folk.

The warriors are attired in armor of glamour and spider-webs, intricately shaped and molded to resemble scales made of silvery tree-leaves. Their arms and jewelry are just as intricate and beautiful; yet the unearthly, inhuman aesthetic of their faces and forms puts such things to shame. As one, they draw their weapons, attractive faces shining with the flame of battle, and they charge. Valon waves an armored hand from within his strider - "go! Back to the cave! I will buy time." And he smashes a fist into the canyon wall, dislodging chunks of rock and gouts of flame that pour downward.

Gallius frowns at Valon. "This is hardly the way to fight," she mutters. She hesitates, and then with more than a bit of wrath allows Jin-nu to spring away, back towards the cave. Gallius wonders just how getting cornered in a cave is a good plan.

Once again the toothy maw opens, and twinkling crystal eyes gaze down at the onrushing Wyldling and her mount. It opens the way immediately, closing thereafter; as Gallius and Jin-nu charge down the mouth of the thing, hearing behind the a distant rumble as Valon's Warstrider follows them in. The irresistable feel of dreaming overtakes Gallius, and she feels herself slipping from Jin-nu...

Gallius wanders alone, through fields of spun gold and tall corn-stalks that play the melodic strains of a harp when disturbed. She feels she is dreaming, and in that dream she calls out for Valon, for Jin-nu, even for her father. The faces of her Circle-mates smile at her, one after the other, as she puts her hand to her brow and gazes up at the curiously dim Sun. More than once she feels her body reverting, and Gallion strides forward, stepping carefully as he adjusts to his new shape. _The King bore a son..._ She shakes her head, fending off curious thoughts, but new ones take root. Her skin grows gray and pale as she looks at her hands. Somewhere, the mournful tones of a funeral march can be heard. _Gallius, our fallen friend, Chosen of Helios. May she reincarnate soon.._

The visions end and Gallius finds herself conscious again, crouched by the edge of a stream. She looks up, following its course down-river, through woods she knows nothing of. The abnormalities of the Wyld are gone; only a fleeting memory remains of her last thoughts - _Gallius, chosen of Luna, survivor.._ - and as she stands, she feels something unexpected behind her. Peering over one shoulder, she perceives a sleekly furred tail, that of a big cat's, swinging lightly behind her.

"I'm sure somewhere, someone is laughing about this," murmurs Gallius softly to herself. "And if they can hear me and see me, I promise someday to tear out their throat." She looks around and frowns deeply, "It seems that the River Spirit has betrayed me, as well." She tries to reach for the essence, to see just what she feels.

Gallius hmms, "Well, at least everything else seems more or less in order." It doesn't improve her mood at all, however. "Well, since I know nothing of where I am, I might as well see about getting my bearings... and it's just early morning." She calls out for her friends heedlessly. At this point, she doesn't care about being stealthy. Pausing to strain for their voices, she makes her way along the stream, heading south and west whenever possible.

The stream runs, as Gallius discovers, north and west. The temperature, too, is much warmer than she's accustomed to. In time she reaches the desolate logging community known as Farhold - hundreds of miles south of the lands she knows. The Wyld has indeed carried her far. But if she emerged safely, there is every reason to believe her friends came through as well.

Gallius guesses this entire voyage was a lesson in humility. Fleeing from Fair Folk, hiding in a cave, and now having to appear as a beast among men. Fortunately the whispers of men are kept quiet, for she carries her naginata in such a way as to make it clear that she's not only used it before, but would be more than happy to do so again. She pays silver for a room in some inn and settles there to gather her wits. She examines her new self in a mirror, frowning. "If I cut it, I might bleed to death," she says to her reflection. "Or if I live, it could grow infected." Still, she considers it seriously before murmuring to herself finally, "There are things I must yet do. I do not have the luxury to return the spark yet. I cannot die for honor when my task is not yet complete."

Two days pass before sorcery, and later an air-ship, let Gallius know for sure she has not been abandoned. Jin-nu, it seems, emerged in a Wyld zone near the Hundred Kingdoms; Valon himself was able to return from the northern wastes via magic, and has been steadily moving south to retrieve his companions.

Gallius awaits her retrieval. She is hardly eager to get picked-up in her current state, but she's also tired of wasting time in the middle of nowhere. She climbs onto the ship in silence. She says only this, "I am ready to leave." She doesn't mention the tail, keeping her revulsion and damaged pride to herself.
