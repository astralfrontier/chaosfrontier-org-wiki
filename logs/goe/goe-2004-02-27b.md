# Gods of Eden 2004-02-27b

It is evening. There is a brief pause between the investigations into the Cynis temple, after all, there're only so much one can do in a day. Resting atop the roofs, above a majority of the smell, in the cool air of the evening, is Ramar. The sun has painted the sky a shade of pink and yellow, and all in all it's rather peaceful. He's waiting. He'd left a note for Rumika, asking her to join him.

Rumika finds the note, considers it curiously, and decides she might as well see just what it is Ramar needs. She creeps to the rooftop using her usual stealth and sets herself a short distance away from the other solar. "You wanted to see me?" she asks.

"Ah you've made it." Ramar stands, basking in the rising heat of the city. "I believed you wished to talk, if my memory serves. It seems to me that this might be a quiet place for such conversation. Peaceful."

"You pick odd times to talk," says Rumika quietly. "And odd places, as well," she murmurs. "I am rather curious about this circle. I have never been in one, so I'm still figuring out how it works. You are a family, I think, more than anything."

Ramar chuckles, "Odd... I suppose so. Odd times and odd places make for less curious visitors. Besides, sometimes you simply need to shift perspective on things..." He gestures out to the city below, "From up here, things seem quite different. And it doesn't smell quite as bad." The Solar nods his head, "We are. I have to wonder why you would ask? Curiosity I can understand... but haven't you known a family before?" A hint of sadness plays in the corners of his eyes. "Your mother at least..."

"My mother is gone," says Rumika softly. "And when I next see her, only one of us will escape alive," she explains. "But as for other family, I have forgotten them. And with mother it was much easier. She taught me so many things that I needed to know. Now I fear that I'm needed as a teacher, and I hope I am able to be of use."

"Are you needed? I'm not certain of that still... the circumstances of our meeting were... unusual. Yet you seem so certain. May I ask why?" Ramar peers curiously at Rumika, wary, yes, but not hostile.

Rumika sighs softly and looks down at her hands, "I hope I am needed. I gave up everything to be here, to follow the destiny I had shown to me." She looks out over the city, "Perhaps I can teach you something of use."

"I imagine that you could. I would ask what you have given up and what destiny have been shown you, if I am permitted..." Ramar bows his head, then looks out over the city, "At least before you taught me something. Perhaps you are not the only one who will be doing the teaching..."

"The destiny to leave my mother, to spread the knowledge I have," says Rumika. "I imagine your circle knows of the weakest circle of sorcery. I think you know something of the occult. I am well on my way towards attaining the greatest power our kind can ever attain. I am destined to achieve it, and I and those who stand with me will turn its power against the Abyssals." She frowns thoughtfully, "And yet I would rather leave all of these things. If I could have my wish, I would be far from here, surrounded by children of my own making with the world forever shut outside."

"So what precisely is the greatest power our kind can achieve... I'm curious..." Ramar shakes his head. He ponders Rumika a moment though, "Why would you shut the world forever outside? Why would you seal yourself away from this?"

"The final circle of sorcery, the circle that our hands alone can master," says Rumika. "There are only tales and whispers of it, but there are those among the dark ones that remember. Did you not know that the Abyssals are themselves twisted sparks, stolen by the Deathlords? Amongst them there still remains much of the past, if you can get a straight answer." She takes some time before she tries to explain herself. "I wish for peace and rest. I don't want to worry about the world outside. Part of the learning of sorcery has made me see the dwindling life in all things. It is tiring, Ramar, to see everything about you wilting and failing."

"I would imagine so. Perhaps this is part of how the Abyssals see things, Rumika, to see the dwindling life in all things. To tire of the weariness some equate to life." Ramar pauses. "The Abyssals are not all that remember the First Age, nor are they the only ones capable of teaching. I cannot help but wonder what might have been if you'd learned from another teacher... do you not remember what it is to see a seed begin to bud?" A pause, "As for the Abyssals... they are perhaps encouraged by those of the Realm. Do you know of the Immaculate Faith?"

Rumika laughs softly, "I know a few things. My mother and I killed Immaculates a few times. They are dangerous folk, but End of Fate's Twisting is far stronger than any that we ever met. I rather doubt the Realm and the Abyssals will cooperate very often, either." She stretches and lets out a sigh, "In any case, one should not insult those who teach when they could just as easily have killed me."

"Have I insulted you? If I have, Rumika, you have my most sincere apologies. I do not wish to do so," replies Ramar. "I was simply curious as to what you knew. And to what you believe to be true regarding the Immaculate Faith and the Anathema and the Abyssals. It seems to me that one could draw a corollary easily enough. If such was your desire."

"You insult the Abyssals, and though I know they are not good, one of them was very kind to me," says Rumika gently. "The Immaculate Faith is a fraud. The Abyssals are a sad by product of the disasters that the rising of the Dragon-Blooded caused." She sighs softly and shakes her head, "There is some tie still between our kind and the Deathlords and their servants, though, and I am unsure to what end it will lead us."

"Then I apologize. I am aware of the falsehoods that have been spread around. And I must admit I do not know the origin of the Abyssals. Not in detail yet. If there is such a tie, perhaps it can lead to life once more. Things seem so difficult at times. And here I find that no, you are not some malicious figure, merely someone burdened with knowledge. At least that is how you seem to me. I apologize Rumika."

"It is alright, Ramar," says Rumika. "I stand outside the circles, and I shall never really be one of you." She smiles and lets out a sigh, "Still.. it is nice to pretend, even if it is just for a while. Soon, though, I will go to my island, and when you have a need of me, you can come there. I will be preparing for the final step, and you will likely not have the time to research the secrets I mean to probe. What I do know is that the solar circle is more than a matter of learning. It is a voyage of spirit and body both. But I have yet to learn anything else."

"Such is the way of many things in the world." Ramar smiles, though it is a sad smile. "Perhaps you needn't stand outside the Circles. No one is an island, truly. But perhaps..." He shakes his head, "I am, to put it simply, having a hard time trusting you. Or your knowledge. So much of it seems steeped in the dark lore of the Abyssals... but perhaps I am mistaken. You are strong. Stronger than them, I would think."

"I am not truly very strong," says Rumika. "I am a little older, perhaps, and I have a stronger grasp of essence, but that does not make me strong." She smiles and lets out a soft breath, "I only wish to be left out of this. So much pain is coming. I can smell it in the air, Ramar. Much suffering, of which we've only seen the first moments. If I can aid you, I may request something small in return, should you find it along your way."

Ramar says, "But you say it yourself, a grasp of Essence or age does not make you stronger..." He nods, leans back, "You have given up everything to accept a destiny, or so you say. That takes strength. Does it not?"

Ramar adds, "What small thing would you request of me?"

"Not just of you, but of your circle," says Rumika. "You have seen the Lunars, and how those who follow them often mind the form of man and beast? Their forms are unlovely to behold, but their is a wisdom in this. I am going to create a sorcery to bind two forms and produce a beautiful, new life. I ask your circle to find me a creature, preferably a bird, that has a beauty unmatched that does not fade."

Ramar asks, simply, "Why?"

"Because then I will have someone with me, to share my home," answers Rumika. "No one else will come there, at least not for long. I imagine there will be those who wish to learn and who might come to me, but they will not stay long. Some I will not wish to. I want to have my children who will adore me as a mother and who will be comfortable in the quiet."

"And when life dwindles and fails Rumika? What then?" He settles back on the roof, seeming a little more at ease. At least this is noticeable. "What would you do should your quiet be disturbed?"

"I do not think it will," she answers. "My children will die, of course, but they shall have children, so I will never be lonely." Rumika smiles warmly, "I am eager to have many beautiful offspring on my island."

Ramar asks then, "And what of those who desire your company, Rumika?"

"Then they may come to the island to be with me," Rumika replies. "That will be a very small number, though. I can think of only one who might wish to make that journey only to see me." She closes her eyes, breathing deeply and letting out a sigh, "My island shall become a place of safety for those who want to forget for a while the sadness of the world. They will heal there, but they will not stay. Humans and the Chosen alike rarely desire rest for long. I think my desire is somewhat unique and strange."

Ramar raises an eyebrow, "Only one, Rumika?" He chuckles, "I would disagree with you. There are more. None can have seen you at the Carnival and believe you to be all alone. At peace, yes.. but..." Ramar chuckles, "Yet here you tell me you are. What will you do then Rumika? Rest in your island and watch the world pass by?"

"I will be able to see much of the world, and I will be able to explore a great deal without going anywhere," says Rumika. "And perhaps men shall come to me to ask questions of things, and I can aid them." She hugs her knees to her chest, "And there will be children, and relaxing, and dreaming. That seems enough."

Ramar says, "Dreaming... yes this does seem enough. Why limit it to only one island Rumika?"

"Because it is enough," Rumika says. "I want nothing more. My island is large enough for my children and I. If they grow too numerous, there are many others not far away, but my home shall be where my manse lies."

Ramar says, "It sounds lovely enough. And there I imagine you can make all the journeys your heart desires..."

"If I ever desire to leave the island, I will be surprised," admits Rumika. "But if the need comes, I imagine I will know a way to do so without danger. And I must prepare, for there are always evil ones who would harm sanctuaries such as the one I would make."

"Sadly this is the case. For now. Perhaps someday this will not be. I am striving to make the world a better place in my own way." A smile broadens on Ramar's face, if only slightly. "I suppose we share goals in this manner."

"You wish to improve the world, I wish to make part of it my own. A safe place for beauty and peace," says Rumika. "The goals are similar. If things grow safe in many places, perhaps my daughters will come to live among men and share their beauty with them."

Ramar nods, "Perhaps. It is something that time will tell." Ramar folds his hands together, "Why is it that all you see is the dwindling of life and the failing of living things, for your learning Sorcery?"

Ramar says, "If I am permitted to ask..."

Rumika hmms, "When the eye grows more attuned to the use of essence, it can start to see things. It is true of me, and true of my mother. I have spoken with another solar who just recently achieved this level of skill, and he too began to see things, though slightly different than I." She frowns in thought and says, "I hope that I don't see things even more strongly when the final circle is mine."

Ramar tilts his head, "Hmmm. I wonder... what spells have you learned, Rumika? Perhaps those which you know have something to do with how your view of the world has been colored?"

"I do not think so. Before I even learned a spell of the celestial circle I was seeing things this way," answers Rumika. "I know spells of concealment, but my more powerful sorceries allow me to turn my body into something rather stronger than iron, and to shatter the spells of my enemies."

Ramar considers this, "Then perhaps as you learn this last circle of Spells, you should learn to view the world in a different light. If you wish to. I would be glad to at least try to teach you that." He smiles, looks down, "I'm sorry Rumika. I should have trusted you from the start."

"You have a circle to worry about, a family. You do not have the luxury of trusting someone easily," says Rumika. "It is better now, though. I was afraid earlier. I do not wish to cause a disruption in your circle, nor any other, and I feel that I am becoming a distraction that you cannot afford right now."

Ramar shakes his head, "You are not. A distraction would be those fellows who tried to assault us the other day. You are a person, and for a moment I forgot that." Ramar bows his head, "Again, I am sorry."

"Apology accepted," says Rumika. "I need to find out what kind of teacher I will be. Magic certainly is my main gift to the solars. Those who seek me out will be taught, and yet I must be very careful at the same time." She frowns, "I don't want to get the Wyld Hunt after me. I am sick of the Dragon-Bloods."

"How do you suppose you will learn what teacher you will be?" Ramar sits back, lying flat against the roof as the breeze of the night air carries heat and smoke across the rooftops. "Sick of the Dragon-Bloods?"

"By teaching," says Rumika. "And yes, I am sick of them. They are troublesome upstarts, and though I believe we had become dangerous when they rose against us, they have come to trust to lies. The world is deceived by them, but our kind has returned and soon their lies will be laid bare."

Ramar says, "And what will happen then, Rumika?"

"That is for others to decide," replies Rumika. "I will watch, and wait, and tend my small paradise and my children. I have no higher goals."

Ramar thinks on this for a moment. He sits in silence, save for the passing of his thoughts. "I am afraid I do. It must be nice to have such a simple thing to accomplish... my dreams are a little more than this. I suppose it is in this way I might come to envy you, if I did not love the dreams I have for myself and the future."

"We are each chosen for a reason. I believe I know what my purpose is," says Rumika. "And that is what I will focus on. I will help others as I can, but I do not wish to risk my dream."

Ramar says, "Why do you not wish to risk it, Rumika?"

"Because it is my dream, and it is precious to me," she says. "There are some things I would say are more valauble, but this desire is dear to me, and it will bring me happiness." Rumika smiles, "Dreams are worth a great deal."

Ramar smiles, "They are. Dreams are worth more than many can imagine. It is what keeps us alive and what makes us great. If I may say so."

"True enough," Rumika agrees. "But I think we have spent enough time on the rooftops this night. I am growing chilled, and need rest if I am to be ready. The morrow may bring many things."

Ramar nods, "I believe we have." Ramar stands, then offers to help Rumika down, should she wish it. As they descend, he pauses, looks back up at her. "Rumika, thank you for the talk tonight. You have taught me much, and perhaps, before all is said and done, I might teach you something worth learning as well."

"Have I?" murmurs Rumika. "We will have to see. For my part, I just wish to survive. I fear I am not very brave when it comes to it." She will of course accept the help that is offered and make her way to her room for some real rest.
