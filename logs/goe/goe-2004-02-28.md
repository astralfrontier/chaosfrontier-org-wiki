# Gods of Eden 2004-02-28

While the rest of the Solars collect their thoughts and organize some plan of action, Chi-Yosh and the Lunar separate themselves, and talk privately. "First of all, your young Rabby is okay. I'm taking care of her for a bit. If she wants to come along with your group when you go in, that's up to her. If she doesn't, then I think she's a fool."

Chi-Yosh can reason why. As far as he can understand it, word of mouth is key to the Lunar, who's reputation is spread by their kind. "I knew she was fine, but she is our guide in Nexus. One which I seem to have driven off." A joking smile is offered, before a glance to the waters. "Are they not so poisonous as the locals claim?"

"The waters? Well, people do shit in it, but there are layers of current that are clean below that." The Lunar grins widely, showing unaccountably sharp teeth. "Come on, let me show you." And with that he seizes Chi-Yosh bodily, diving in with him and sinking down to the bottom.

Chi-Yosh is caught completely off guard, and reflexively swallows a great bit of air before he meets the water face on. Grime splashes, then the two are beneath the surface. Only after hesitation does he open his eyes.

The waterways of Nexus flow rapidly - if they didn't, it'd present great problems for the city. The current tears the Solar and his captor along at a good clip, and looking back, Chi-Yosh can half-discern flippers or fins, rather than legs, below the Lunar's waist. Twisting and turning through the water-ways, the two swim as best each can toward some strange destination in this maze of canals.

Through light and shadow the two dart down the waterway, and up and down as well. The raging current ends at last, and Chi-Yosh can feel the pull of the water lessening. The stream has apparently emerged into a large pool, and Chi-Yosh and his companion swim closer and closer to a shimmering outline of gray at one end. They break the surface of the water and begin ascending steps, leading up onto a flat stone platform in an underground cistern. The rippling of the waters and the plink of moisture echo in this chamber, and overhead Chi-Yosh can see a rusty grating, over which feet sometimes pass. "You held on pretty well," the man observes, chuckling. "Good."

Not surprised with the hint this Lunar is as at home in the water as land, Chi-Yosh swam with ease. As a boy, he'd spent many bright days in the waves of the river bordering the Su'Katan village. While not as good as he was, the Dawn had learned to even spear fish underwater. Though coming up for air is a relief, breathing deep once the water breaks. From wetness into quiet they have come. "I have introduced myself, but I know not what to call you, friend."

"You're right, you don't," says the Lunar, stepping further into the shadow of the underground chamber. The sound of bare feet descending stone is heard thereafter, and Chi-Yosh follows. The man leads the way into a well-appointed den, decorated with furs, and lit with candles. He throws on a robe of thin furs, then turns. As he does, his form changes again - but not into any animal. Short dark hair lengthens past the shoulder; the body swells and recedes; the frame loses some of its strength but gains in grace. He turned; she completes the turn. "I am Seven Devils Clever," she says, inclining her head politely. "And you are in my home."

Chi-Yosh can only guess what the Lunar means by that. He may be hiding his identity to keep himself safe. Or perhaps the Nain-ya has not earned the respect to gain the name, yet? His eyes comb the den, though as the Lunar begins to change, it gains the Solar's full attention. He returns the bow, even though his brow has risen. "You wear your disguise well, Seven Devils Clever."

"We'll wait here for a bit, while your Rabby returns from her hunting. She feeds herself, as I expected her to," the Lunar woman says, kneeling down on the floor and taking up a relaxed, meditative pose. "While we wait, tell me of yourself and your deeds."

Chi-Yosh eases down onto the furs, the dampness of his condition payed no heed as he takes up a cross-legged seat. Smiling almost ruefully, "Yes, Rabby's independent." And there he tells of the first time Rabby had met them, and the tale alongside it, how he had eventually been initiated into the ranks of the Nain-ya. From there, the story of Greyfalls, leaving out a few details, but leaving the others firmly intact.

Seven Devils Clever listens intently, stopping the speaker only once with a raised hand. She looks to the steps, then nods approvingly as Rabby can be seen to descend them. "I came and... oh!" The girl scowls. "Why did you bring HIM here?"

Chi-Yosh turns his head, his face molding to one of innocence. "It is my charming demeanor and winning personality, Rabby. I had to build it up in person, since it has been _torched_ in word."

Rabby enters the sanctum, turning and putting her hands on her hips as she leans forward into Chi-Yosh's face. "You are an IDIOT!" she exclaims.

Chi-Yosh continues to stare back at Rabby, unshaken. "You are right. The circle plans on more idiocy, and it was ignorant of me to come here and invite you to it." Casting a glance to Seven Devils Clever, "Would you agree?"

The Lunar woman shrugs. "All I know is what I've heard," she says. Rabby, meanwhile, slumps down and extends a claw from one of her fingers, scratching at her neck lightly and staring at the Solar. "What are you planning now?" she asks, curiosity mixing with apprehension.

Chi-Yosh smiles, more inwardly than out. The best way to dodge Rabby is to hit her where it would distract. "House Cynis is behind the mass of slaves headed here. Soras Minan will aid us, if we can enter the House stronghold here and capture evidence from their vaults for the Council's eyes."

"What?" The girl looks confused, but shakes her head. "Come on, we're going back, so you can explain this to me." She turns, offering a low bow to Seven Devils Clever, who nods politely.

---

Rabby, Chi-Yosh and Ramar all finish hashing out their mutual question-and-answer tug-of-war, and the Lunar girl nods at last. "I was right," she mutters to the easterner. "You really are an idiot. Why not just sneak in, get this girl out, and run away?"

Chi-Yosh holds out his hand, and begins to count his fingers. "One, there are far more then one lone girl. Two, if we were discovered, the amount of guards would be deadly for us. Three, it would not stop future slave caravans. Four," And he looks at Rabby now, "Which would appeal more to other Lunars, do you think?"

The Westerner remains silent for now. Though there is a curious smile on his face as he shifts his attention to Chi-Yosh to listen to the man's answer. When he finishes, Ramar replies, "And it's also more fun this way."

The girl shrugs. "I guess. But still... anyway, nevermind. You will do what you will do, I suppose."

"If Davron's cousin is in the caravan, then it is likely more from his home village is there. He does not want to leave others he didn't see behind. And we do not want to leave any behind, in good conscience. Will you join us?" Asks Chi-Yosh.

"Join you? Umm, in going in there?" asks Rabby. "I suppose I could.." She shrugs a little, and looks uncertain. "What would you want me to do?"

Chi-Yosh says, "When all hell breaks loose within the compound, and I am sure it will happen, there will be much fighting. So much so, we may be too hard pressed to all make it to the vaults." Gesturing to Ramar, then Rabby, "Someone has to push ahead while we are the distraction."

"At the very least," says Ramar, with a thoughtful air to his tone, "You could help us get in the door, much as you did before. It gives us a chance to get the distraction further inwards."

"I suppose..." The girl frowns further, but shrugs. "We have time, at least. So come on. I want to show you two something."

"If you could help us in getting an idea of the layout of the building and the people therein, guard schedules and the like, it might be even more helpful. Although that is dangerously risky." Ramar quiets himself as the girl goes on. "Alright then. Lead the way."

---

The Little Market of the Nexus District is a sprawling place whose quietest moments suggest a hurricane. The calls of a thousand greedy merchants in a hundred tongues can be heard, barely audible over the din of the buyers themselves. Rabby leads the way, pausing to glance about now and again, especially along the rooftops. She guides the two Solars through allies back of the Market proper, then knocks carefully on a wooden door on one wall. A slit in the door opens, then closes after a second or two. The door opens, and Rabby enters the gloomy interior, flashing a sign to the unseen doorman as she passes.

Chi-Yosh is suspicious. Rabby seems always the most wary within the streets. Either she is paranoid or wise. Unsure about the gloom that holds before them, a simple glance is shot sidelong to Ramar, before the Dawn pushes in. At the very least, he knows Rabby is not foolish enough to lead them into a trap.

Ramar returns Chi-Yosh's nod. He glances about, and mulls over the varied cries and shouts in the background. A moment to collect his bearings is all Ramar needs before he steps inside.

What lies inside is a school, of a kind. Wooden training dummies are visible in the corners; weapons racks are on every wall. A number of students are on the floor, practicing their moves, while teachers casually amble around the group, observing, commenting or reprimanding. "This is a school for martial arts," explains Rabby in a soft voice. "I learned to fight here, for awhile."

In an equally soft voice, Ramar remarks, "I see." The Solar raises a curious eyebrow as he watches the others fighting, learning moves as graceful and deadly as the aspects of the world they seek to emulate. "Why show us this," he half-whispers.

"I thought you might want to know about the city, about where I came from.." Rabby breaks off, hesitation and self-doubt lingering in her voice. She stands quietly, and says no more, content to watch the katas of the students.

Chi-Yosh looks around with interest. Then he pauses, stepping back to lean against a wall, as though from somewhere inside him something had unlocked. The roomer was grander, more elegant and made of marble, with great devices built even into the walls for optimal space and storage. So many lessons had been taught there, pain and triumph, a tempered pride and an iron resolve. The practices, the battles with Sensei Falling Talon... The words of his companions bring him back, moments later, covering this lapse of... of something by inspecting a weapon on the wall, or at least seeming to. An interesting thing, a sword that angles up into a hook...

"Why wouldn't we," replies Ramar, using the tone of his voice to smooth away any lingering self-doubt. "So what was it like then, learning to fight here, learning to survive in this city?"

Chi-Yosh, though, does start to peer at the weapon itself. Taking it off the rack, testing the weight and balance, it feels... right. While different from his kama, there is a certain similarity, one which flows with the practiced ease of his arm. He tries it a different way, taking up the stance he knows so well, and executes a simple strike, one to catch a shoulder and draw an opponent close to grasp. And it fits, almost perfect.

Rabby shrugs, and turns away a bit. "It was a lot easier when I didn't know so much, but a lot harder because I couldn't do so much," she replies quietly. "Since... It happened, everything has become strange. But I'm glad I am back here, at least for now. I have good memories, too.."

Chi-Yosh stops. While the new wonderment is at hand, he can simply feel the unease in Rabby's words. They are in Nexus for a while; he can return. A hand falls onto Rabby's shoulder, gentle, but there. "It is all a cycle. When something new comes, it is hard, and completely _different_. If nothing else, there are those here who experience the same."

"When you didn't..." Ramar trails off, "Ah yes. I see what you mean. Perhaps this is one of the reasons It happened. Happens. Will continue to happen. Such is the way of things... but what will you do about it Rabby?" He smiles, "What memories will you make?"

"I like to come here.. well, to remind myself," the girl says. "This school was started by slaves. A lot of the fighting styles of the southeast were designed by slaves or enslaved peoples, and a lot of escaped slaves carried their skills with them when they came here. They set up schools in Nexus, like this one, and taught selectively. They make good money, too. I guess I want to do the same. Turn hard times into an asset. Become stronger, like Valon and Prowler and you."

Chi-Yosh is delicate with his words. "Those escaped slaves needed to be free before they could come here and teach. We have the opportunity to make some slaves stronger, Rabby, turn their hard time into opportunity in a new place. But it will take our strenght to do it."

Meanwhile, one of the teachers has approached from behind, and Chi-Yosh can sense his presence before he speaks. "Welcome friend. You are familiar with those weapons?" he asks.

"If only more people saw that. Turning hard times to an asset." Ramar turns to watch the students fighting, the way they move as though some of them were still chained, the way some of the moves are hidden in more innocuous guises. "Someday, perhaps the wor-" Ramar breaks off at the sudden interruption, and simply smiles. He does take the time to give Rabby a questioning glance, however.

Chi-Yosh tilts his body, still close to Rabby while acknowledging the teacher. Opening his mouth, then closing, the Su'Katan finally offers, "I once was, with some of them. It seems like a lifetime ago." Or several, perhaps.

"Perhaps you would like to give us a demonstration." And the teacher claps his hands. The others look over, and nod; the students withdraw to the edges of the room, kneeling quietly, as the sifu guides Chi-Yosh out into the center.

Chi-Yosh is nervous, like some tingling in his gut, but there is a calmness that is beyond the man himself. A hand is extended towards the sifu, who selects at random a staff and tosses it to the Dawn. Rather than a mere catch, he darts forward to grasp one end, swinging his arm and spinning it across his shoulders. Catching the tip in the other arm, the staff's next twirl is halted with three swings which are more slow and graceful than powerful. High strokes, low, a butt of the shaft itself sprinkled within flowing motions of the body, the move of a foot in conjunction to the opposite strike of the weapon just right. The man himself had not picked up the staff since the morning in Syllum, but even now, his mind is no longer dusty.

As if moving through water that is slowly draining away, the Dawn's motions gain speed. A broad gesture to one teacher, before he tosses the shaft to him, while the glance to another sifu brings into the air a sai which is caught in the bend of his arm, dropping down to snatch the falling weapon before it hits the floor. His stance and style change slightly, and even though he had never picked up the weapon, it is as though a creak is running down the ancient bed of a river, the water once more claiming tracks which have carved themselves upon the earth. Once more calling a sifu, two shafts of wood afixed together are tossed in. These claimed mid-air by the sai bring them into hand, and together, like two foiled siblings the weapons lash for one stroke, and in the same motion the sai is delivered to a third teacher.

A tempo is rising slowly, like the stillness before the storm. The Dawn is neither hurried nor sluggish, each tool given it's due, even ones that the death-deep memory does not recall are not used in error. But the collection and abandonment of each complimenting object gets quicker, swifter, with more ease, until the sifu together are catching and tossing weapons back to the Su'Katan. A chained dagger is gripped by the Su'Katan, swong in counter with each of his motions like a slender twin, the two in harmony but for a moment before traded off. Even at this speed his motions are graceful, running through the patterns, til finally two swords tipped with hooks find his fists.

The tension begins to ease now, the tide pulling back with each wave. Fast at first, the swords weave with the graceful poise in the foundation that Patient Mantis had laid months before. Chi-Yosh bonds with those weapons with each fire of his muscles, not remembering, but understanding them. Until the dangerous, beautiful dance grows so slow that the man simply stops.

The sifu who called Chi-Yosh out nods, and the students clap and cheer appreciatively. Another teacher inclines her head politely to the visiting weapon-master, signalling the school's satisfaction with his performance. Rabby smiles from the sidelines, too.

Chi-Yosh offers respective bows to the others, his muscles burning, a small sheen of sweat glistening across his brow and arms. But the man is pleased, delighted. And touched, deeper down. Something inside him was smiling, and it was not just his lips as he leaves the mat to place his weapons back on the rack.

Ramar claps in appreciation for his friend. He cheers, loudly, but not too loudly. "Well done!" _Very deadly, very graceful... although I can't say I ever remember him using those..._ Ramar shrugs the thought aside, and watches Chi-Yosh, smiling. _He looks at peace. Happy._

Again the students resume their katas and their performances, re-energized by the dazzling performance of earlier. Such demonstrations are likely part of the school's regimen - hard work is more readily given when one can see the pay-off with his own eyes.

Chi-Yosh singles out the instructor who had invited him for the display. "I was hoping that I might return, once certain obligations are done within this city. There is still much I need to learn."

The sifu turns, listens, and nods. "Give the Sign of the Mouse at the door and you may gain entry," he instructs. "Your friend knows it; have her teach you, and you may return at any time."

"Thank you," replies Chi-Yosh, who bows in departure. Returning to Ramar and Rabby, a deep breath escapes him. Words low and playful, "I think I am ready for another dip in fetid water."

"Nicely done my friend." Ramar bows his head to the Sifu, then asks, "What shall we do now?" He asks Rabby, "Are there other places you could show us?"

---

An hour later, Rabby returns from her surveillance of the temple that House Cynis is hiding in. "It's just as you saw," she reports sullenly. "There's the front door - closed and barred - and a side-entrance on the waterways, similarly closed and barred. Even a mouse couldn't enter. They have air-vents that are screened just this thin." She pinches her fingers together for emphasis.

"Seven Devils Clever said she can get us in," offers Chi-Yosh. "I have to wonder what she has in mind."

Rabby shrugs helplessly. "She knows Nexus far better than I," the girl remarks, sounding a little bitter - as if anyone could command greater knowledge of HER city. "When I become ikth-ya, I'll come back and challenge her."

"That thin you say..." Ramar is quiet, settles back for a moment and ponders. "You know, perhaps if you helped us to find a way in, it'd increase your standing. Although it might... hmmm." He raises an eyebrow, "Ikth-ya?"

"A lunar rank of attainment, fool," growls Rabby. "Didn't you learn ANYTHING from Weeping Prowler?"

Chi-Yosh glances sidelong at Rabby. "You know Weeping Prowler as a teacher," He points out. The sorceror was informative, but there was much to be left to know. The more Ramar asked, it seemed the more he withdrew. "Are you Uf-ya, Rabby?"

The girl opens her mouth, then shuts it again. "I'm nain-ya, like you. I haven't proven myself yet, really," she says, in a quiet voice.

"I did. Though I did not learn everything from him, Rabby. As I'm sure you might well know. I'm still learning, and likely will continue learning until the day I pass on. How am I to learn though, if I do not ask questions?" Ramar smiles, then adds, "You will prove yourself yet."

Ramar says, "I meant to ask, though, which rank ikth-ya is. I do not know the system of ranking well enough yet."

Rabby counts off on her fingers. "Urrach-ya, the nonperson. Nain-ya, the kin. Uf-ya, the honored. Ikth-ya, the respected. Murr-ya, the revered. Shahan-ya, the greatest."

Chi-Yosh, while he has a sense of the Lunar methods, is not sure on the details of their etiquette. "Rabby, is there a polite way to ask what a Lunar's beast is?"

"Why would you want that information?" asks Rabby, somewhat suspiciously, as she eyes Chi-Yosh.

Chi-Yosh gestures to Ramar. "Etiquitte for the curious."

Chi-Yosh adds to that with, "And I saw part of Seven Devils' transformation, but I am not sure what she is. It made me wonder."

Ramar blinks, "Oh sure... bame me for this."

Rabby shrugs a bit. "The curious need to be patient," she replies. "If it's any of your business, a Lunar will tell you. If it's not, start a fight. If he has the beast-man form, he'll adopt it, and you can guess from there. You'd also better win that fight."

Chi-Yosh can only smirk. "Then I would be wise to be patient, if she is Ikth-ya."

Ramar nods, "Even I could guess at that one. Still..." Ramar raises an eyebrow, "Why do you intend to challenge her when you become ikth-ya Rabby? Is it necessary for you to challenge each other?"

"Because she lives in Nexus, and she knows everything about it," mutters Rabby, sounding put out. "I should be the one..."

Ramar ponders, "There can only be one? The two of you cannot simply share knowledge and know that put together you make a more powerful force than any?"

"No, we can't, okay?" Rabby almost shouts. "This is my hometown. This is where I was raised. This is.. this is... it's mine. Not hers. Not anyone else's."

Ramar quirks an eyebrow, "I see. So if she knows everything about the city and lives here... that makes it hers? I am confused on this matter, Rabby."

The Lunar girl swings - and misses. Shaking her fist, she bows her head, then turns and runs for it, clutching one arm over her face and trembling as she goes.

Chi-Yosh simply stares back at Rabby. He knows that the Lunar would be better simply learning about the city from Seven Devils, if she knows everything about the city. But Rabby has a pride, a... Sighing at the display, watching Rabby leave, his words are quiet. "Ramar, it is a matter of territory. Two male tigers cannot share the same strip of land."

Ramar ducks back out of the way, dodging the clumsy swing. He spits a word out in another language, then "I'm an idiot. Remind me of that sometime... Torch. I suppose. But they are neither male nor tigers. We must learn to get along, to share. Or perhaps not. Either way... we should go after her. I will at least..." and with that he turns to follow.

"It is not so simple." Chi-Yosh says no more, knowing it will likely fall on deaf ears. Rising to his feet, he follows behind, but at less of a pace than Ramar. The girl has been shamed, has exposed her sensitive underbelly for them today, and Ramar has accidently kicked it.

Rabby is nowhere to be found, in spite of Ramar's searching and keen senses; whatever shape she has taken to elude pursuit, it is a skillful one. She is a survivor and always will be, one crafted from the belching, steaming city around the two Solars. Her peculiar mix of strength, pride, and weakness mirror the city's own, and like the city, she withdraws when threatened, to survive to another dawn.

Chi-Yosh catches up with Ramar, to tug on his sleeve. "Come on. She must lick her wounds. I have someone for you to meet." Hoping Seven Devils Clever does not mind the company, Chi-Yosh backtracks the way Rabby and he had left the Lunar's lair. If the lynx had returned once, she will return there again. Next time, Chi-Yosh thinks, he will clap his hand over Ramar's mouth. Stop it from the source.

Ramar sighs. He finds a quiet place to give up the chase, and catches his breath. "Why isn't it that simple? Don't they see how much better it could be? Instead of quibbling over this... territory, they could have the run of it together. It could be so much better... so different..." Ramar shakes his head, and turns to follow Chi-Yosh. _And here I thought that talking this over might solve things... that's two Lunars I've driven to attack me. Valon and Rabby. Learn from this idiot._

Chi-Yosh says, as they move through the streets and byways, "Ramar, there are some subjects which are very, very sensitive to some. Be it their past, their heart, honor, or something else. For Lunars, honor, strenght, respect, these are key. You do not question them, or they will claim defense."

"Yes, I realize this Chi-Yosh. But in order to change the world, everything must be questioned. Don't you see? If the Lunars stopped fighting amongst one another, stopped trying to measure whose is bigger, they could be so much more than they are now..." Ramar sounds frustrated. "Why? They can't always have been like this..."

"You cannot change the world by pulling apart that which an individual holds dear, claiming blasphemy and offense to their code." After a moment, the Su'Katan reasons, "Perhaps this is the way it has to be for the Lunar. They are about strenght. The strongest will survive. The strongest rule, and have to challenge others to move up. We inherited the world, and let it down; now they protect it from the Fae and all other things. Change them by changing the world around them."

Ramar says, "I do not pull apart anything. I asked if they could share this... city with one another, if it had to come down to a contest between the two. It makes no sense, Chi-Yosh. If they were about strength, you would think they would realize that _together_ they are stronger. Much the same as our Circle is greater than the sum of its parts. It must have been different before... something must have tempered them. Something must have had them together. Forged them into the glorious generals the tales say they were. As brothers in a pack instead of rivals. Something. Maybe... who knows, maybe it was us."

Chi-Yosh smiles sadly. "Ramar, think of a wolf pack. You have the alpha couple. Beneath the alpha, you have the beta. You do not have all alphas who work together by taking votes on if rabbit or stag will be had for dinner. It is the alpha that leads. The alpha that has that right because they are the strongest. They keep the pack in line. Gallius claimed the village in Greyfalls without a single blow, it was seen as weakness by Valon's tribe. She was challenged. She and the other general could not share the power of leading an army, there must be one most worthy. Lunar are independent, and sharing power may be seen as weakness. Not to mention fighting when you disagree."

"But they DID in the past. They CAN. Sharing power isn't seen as a sign of weakness among us. Among others. They are NOT a pack of wolves all bloodthirsty and primitive. They are more. They are the blending of man and beast, they led armies, they commanded the secret lore that lay hidden in the Wyld, that never was and had yet to be. All of this they did together. It was theirs to do in the past. Perhaps..." Ramar pauses, looking about, "Perhaps not. What if that was what the Solars did, Chi-Yosh? And what if in turn they tempered us. The Sun and Moon do the same, they are as different as Day and Night, yet they share the sky. So do the Stars. And when there is an Eclipse..." Ramar trails off, thoughtfully. "When we can learn to work together again, the world will be changed. Perhaps it will not be the First Age once more. I think... I think it will be better than anything that has ever been."

"You're getting the idea. Right now, the Lunars are different than us, and they will be, until they aren't any more. Right now, we must simply play their game, and gain their respect, then perhaps they can consider the Solar an ally and friend once more." The pair are close to Seven Devils lair. Chi-Yosh begins walking careful, but is not silent in his approach, making it rather obvious of their approach for her. "But, remember you cannot turn water to ice or steam simply by wanting it. Change comes when it is ready. Do not try and force it, else you will lose."

"Such is the way of things Chi-Yosh. Yet sometimes, we must be the catalysts, the agents of Change. And as you can turn water to steam by boiling it, or to ice by freezing it, things can happen. Perhaps. We shall see what there is to see. Where are we going, Chi-Yosh?" Ramar sounds a little less troubled now. A little more sure of himself, perhaps, as though a question deep inside had been answered, and the resulting sparks of questions and answers rush in, unasked for, but welcomed.

---

Chi-Yosh had found Seven Devils Clever in a cistern, via water. But hunting down specificly where he and Rabby emerged from the water is a difficult thing. And even as he thinks back, he did not memorize the exact pattern of lefts, rights, and other crucial directions to get there. After leading Ramar around for half an hour, the Dawn decides to return to the Circle, and hash out the plan for the Cynis building, before trying to call the Lunar again.

"Then perhaps we can go and find the Spirit you talked with. Or its shrine." Suggests Ramar, "We can perhaps get the message out once more, or something. If you wish to do so."

The shrine is not difficult to find; Chi-Yosh did it before, when he called up a spirit before. With a purchased prayer-strip, he begins the short ritual of prayer and observance. The spirit materializes at last, hissing angrily and writhing, apparently in some pain. "Fool! It burns! It burns!" Only then does Chi-Yosh stare in horror at the half-burnt prayer-strip, to find it marked with the runes of air and fire. He was sold the wrong thing at the spirit-wheedler's stalls in the Little Market, an unwitting victim of the thousand and one vendettas of Nexus against itself.

Chi-Yosh drops the prayer strip, before stomping the paper and letting his boot tear it apart. The ritual shifts from prayer to apology. "Great Spirit, I intended to offer proper prayer in respect. The merchant misled me. What can I do to soothe your waters?"

"Find another... a priest.. set me right.." The spirit writhes and quivers, thrashing about and pinioned by pain.

"A priest. Very well then," speaks Ramar. "Will you be alright while we find this priest? Should one of us remain here with you?"

Chi-Yosh says not a word, and instead is out the door at the spirit's request. He seeks out another temple, a shrine. To his misfortune, the first that he comes to is a set of Immaculate missionaries. Perfect. Hailing one, "Sir! Your services are needed, immediately! Dire need!"

The befuddled Centralist listens to Chi-Yosh's claim. Unfortunately this man is not an actual spirit-speaking priest, but a layman who took up the word of the Immaculate. The Dawn works his way up the hiearchy of the missionaries before finally he finds the actual Dragons' blessed priest. "All right. What's the matter." "A spirit, I have accidently poisoned it with the wrong blessing." "Well why would you want to go and do that?" "I didn't intend to," Assures Chi-Yosh. "Even if you didn't, you did, so what are you going to do now?" Chi-Yosh stares at the man. "Ask for your assistance." "Oh," Replies the monk, who takes his time in collecting what he needs. "That will cost you." "I'm sure. But Hurry."

Chi-Yosh succeeds in dragging the priest to the pavillion. Inspecting the scrap of dangerous prayer strip, the Immaculate begins - after jade has warmed his palm - to soothe the spirit's ills with a continual chanting. On a sheet of paper he draws the runes for water, while dropping some balls into the pool of the shrine which begin to dissolve in the water itself, turning the pool dark and murky. The quivering form of the little god has resided, and now at the least at ease.
