# Gods of Eden 2004-03-03

The pre-dusk hours are exhilarating to walk in, as the steam-powered heat of Nexus and the cold winds of Resplendent Air clash in a merciless war on the streets. The Solars, having adequately prepared themselves, return to the rude hostel where they are staying. Seven Devils Clever is waiting for the party in one of their rented rooms. Rabby is with her too, and is unusually subdued. Introductions are made; Chi-Yosh has told his companions about their guide in the city, at least. "Shall we go?" asks the Lunar woman, smiling.

"I am ready," replies Ramar. A look of worried anticipation is on the Solar's face, though it's somewhat masked by the grin he wears. "Whenever the rest of you are... let's go and be done with it. I can't help but wonder how you plan to get us in... but, anticipation is half the fun, yes?"

Rumika just nods, waiting for the others to confirm. Her preparations are more or less complete. Her skin is a dull color, looking like cold wrought iron. As she flexes her fist, long spikes protrude, like the nails of a metal cat.

Chi-Yosh's pleased that the misfortune to Nexus's Clear Blood did not endanger the meeting. Even so, the Dawn is tense. Their plan is dangerous, and while the rewards are pleasant, the threat is great. His eyes do not seek out Rabby's; for once, he lets the woman alone to her self, and does not silently remind them of earlier.

Davron's own expression's worry is overlaid with... not eagerness exactly. Just a sense that his hopes and fears will soon be laid to rest. He rubs his burnished hands together. "Let us go, then..." he says, his voice trembling slightly.

---

Seven Devils Clever leads the way through alley after alley, wisely avoiding the more troublesome corridors or visible plazas. More than once the heavily-cloaked party is obligated to fend off some drug- or lust-addled assailant, and as they descend the sloping hills of the city's terrain and into the Nighthammer district, the air becomes less and less hospitable. Steam and soot swirl in the evening air. The belching furnaces offer a worse assault than any mugger, but the party endures. The Lunar woman strides confidently, working her way almost to the waterfront, and through a maze of junk and garbage whose least offensive odors would put a charnel-house to shame.

An end to the surface journey comes into sight. The tunnel arch is a hemisphere of ugly stone. Rotting cloth, dead vines and other detritus hangs from the ceiling, silhouetted into shadow by the blue light of Nexus reflected by rippling waters that shine into the tunnel. Here and there, collapsed stone lends a jagged texture to the floor. The tunnel seems hewn into the rock of the hills that rise up from the flood-plain, boring into the heart of the bedrock above which the rich neighborhoods of Bastion are built. Rusty iron bars block the entrance, but those are easily removed, and with a minimum of sound. The line of salt that's carefully spread across the entrance is another matter; everyone knows why it's there, and nobody wants it to be disturbed in the slightest.

Further into the tunnel, other colors stand out against the horrid earth-tones of rock and refuse. Numerous pinpoints of red light become visible as the eye becomes dark-adapted. As the gloom grows progressively more prevalent, the paired glows of unhealthy crimson show themselves more fully. The red eyes belong to motionless and seemingly mindless human figures, draped in rags and smelling as much like a sewer as the tunnel does itself. They stand erect and quiet, like living statues, sometimes turning their heads a fraction to gaze at the interlopers who have intruded onto their subterranean lair. None move otherwise, nor make any sound. Even the echoed breathing of the intruders stands alone, and not a whisper of sound escapes the unholy throng that loiter at the walls of the tunnel.

Seven Devils Clever presses on, guiding her companions into the depths of this strange place. The eerie figures behind them do not interfere. At last an anemic shaft of light can be seen from overhead. Crowding underneath it, the Solars look up to discern a rusty iron grate, encrusted with refuse. It is locked, but Rabby beckons for and receives a boost up by the other Lunar. A moment later, one of her hands is forming itself into a lockpick made of bone and flesh, and the aged lock creaks open as she defeats it. The grate is pushed upwards, Rabby pokes her head up to inspect what's beyond, and lifts herself up and through. One by one the party ascends into the temple proper.

"What were those things back there," whispers Ramar, still shaking off the unnerving feeling the red-eyed figures sent down his spine. He enters the temple proper, his senses heightened by the subtle flows of Essence, and in this way kept alert for the telltale signs of trouble.

Chi-Yosh gives a start. The silence had been heavy like an iron cloak, made more dreadful by the creatures before. Easing up into the Temple, his hand drops to offer aid to Rumika, who surprises him in weighting no more then normal. Even as his assistance comes, eyes comb the grounds.

Rumika looks over at Ramar and listens for an answer. She would have asked herself, but she's learned over time that she doesn't really want to know everything.

Davron, on the other hand, welcomes Chi-Yosh's assistance, as his unusually heavy form climbs through the hole. He maintains his own silence, but is glad that Ramar asked the question that has been weighing on his own mind for the final leg of the journey.

Rumika waves a hand, indicating the group to draw still when they climb. Calling upon the forces of essence, Rumika binds about her not the aspect of unsight, but a deception that makes her appear to be here as something else. Should the eye leave her and return, it will see something quite different, something not so out-of-place. With a last flourish she extends the magic, so that all the solars and Rabby are likewise shrouded from sight.

Seven Devils Clever waves a hand as the party vanishes from sight. She crawls back down through the grate, closing it behind her but leaving it unlocked. "I will await your return," she hisses.

---

The temple's walls are of chrysoberyl, changing color subtly as different forms of light are cast upon them. Unlike the stacked brick construction of some newer buildings in Nexus, the architecture is truly that of the First Age; the walls appear to be grown rather than carved, with the organic imperfections of living wood stamped into the enduring hardness of earth. Perhaps for aesthetic reasons, there are no inner doors within the temple. Instead, curtains of crystal shards, interlocked together like chains, separate the various partitions of the interior. Faded frescoes adorn the walls, their pigmented illustrations celebrating the long-forgotten practices and nameless gods whose worship once occupied the former occupants. A few of the time-weathered paintings leer out at Davron with such disturbingly well-painted hungers that he hurriedly turns away from them.

The temple is lit by lanterns that hang from the ceiling. Each one is carved into some sort of grotesque symbolized animal or other, less mentionable creature, and flickering candlelight radiates from their staring eyes or open bellies. A few such lanterns swing unsteadily in a breeze that no human intruder can feel, and their chains whisper almost-audible messages in the faint sound of their creaking. One lantern in particular, a raiton with a long and devilishly sharp-looking beak and outstretched wings, seems to twist and turn in the curious wind as though seeking to follow the party with its gaze.

Davron eyes the lanterns suspiciously as he passes them. Though he is not entirely disbelieving of coincidence, on this hostile ground he is inclined to suspect other forces at work. He says nothing, not wishing to disturb the party's progress, but wishes he had the art to confirm or assuage his forebodings.

Rumika will admire the paintings, whispering to one particularly unpleasing picture, "If I were a god getting painted in that state of dress, I'd want them to at least get my good side." Even in this affair, she can't help but try and relax the others.

Chi-Yosh's spine crawls. It seems that no matter where they are, something is watching them, glaring eyes or other, more unpleasant things borne shape by lantern or painting. Even with Rumika's words, ease does not come, but merely the reminder of who - and what - they deal with. If this is how their gods are seen, may Helios help the slaves.

Davron's gaze slips from one lantern at Rumika's remark, and he manages a faint, wry smile. "At least they save on lamp oil here," he remarks dryly, nodding back up toward the ceiling.

Stairs lead down, always down. The unseen stalkers creep through the bowels of the temple, realizing that they must be far indeed under the earth's surface by now. Here and there they have witnessed men and women casually going about some dark business, carrying mundane-seeming paperwork or curious sigils on crumbling parchment. In all cases their security remains intact; no mortal eye has fallen upon them. Nor have any of the more sensitive Solars apprehended the invisible touch of a spirit. In the deepness of the underground levels, they discover a well-concealed door, marked with subtle characters: "House Archives - Restricted Access".

Rabby repeats her performance, unsealing the door's lock and opening it without difficulty. The Archives are comprehensive; reams upon reams of paper and parchment are here, stored away in meticulously precise patterns on scroll-racks or in files. It will take some time to consider, and there are many locks which will need to be bypassed. While the Solars peruse this collection, several pairs of ears prick up. Voices come from beyond; another doorway leads out of this room and into a shadowed hallway. Words can be barely made out, but the voices are very different from each other.

Holding up 4 fingers, Ramar points off in the direction of the voices, indicating at least the number of people. He then frowns, and points towards the door, and more specifically the sealing lock. He mouths the words, 'We do not want to be locked in here...' to anyone who cares to try to discern what he has to say.

The room beyond the shadowed hallway is a cube, almost twenty yards on all its faces. Cubical shapes jut at random from the walls, floor and ceiling, made of the same chrysoberyl as the rest of the temple. Other hallways lead out in other directions. In the center of the room is a pit, filled with something that looks like jet-black water that undulates lightly. Four men are gathered around the pit, speaking in low tones, apparently in some kind of conference. All are dressed in the finest robes, and decked with gems and jewelry. The outrageous opulence of their attire is matched only by the haughty demeanors on their patrician faces.

Rumika draws the group away from the men and explains in near-silence, "That black pit was in the pictures from before. Men were casting the dead into it." She considers carefully all she knows of the Deathlords (which is indeed a great deal) before she considers elaborating. "The Well of Udr.." she murmurs, and the very words make the shadows about her seem to quiver in the imagination of those who have heard them before.

As Rumika speaks, the seals on the Archive Room snap shut with a resonating clang. The door, for now, is closed.

Ramar looks confused. He shakes his head, "I'm afraid to even ask what that is, especially since we need to get started in finding out an answer." He whispers. That is, until the door seals itself in. He sighs. _This is why Things Which Must Not Be Spoken remain nameless._ He rests his hand on the hilt of his sword, then gestures towards the archives. "Only one thing to do now..."

Davron's eyes flick to the door as it seals itself, then back to Rumika's metallic form. "Perhaps. But first, I think we need to know - what is the Well?"

Rumika raises an eyebrow, but remains cool as steel. "The well is a pathway, a door to the Primordials," she explains. "If they have meddled with it, it may be that the power of those who should not touch the Real has stretched out across the expanse to trouble Creation once more."

Ramar nods slowly, winces at the use of the name Primordials... but when he finds himself alive after all is said and done, he breathes a sigh of relief. He whispers, "Very well then. Let's please get on with our business before we find out much more than I care to know at this point..."

Chi-Yosh feels steadily uncomfortable. As things progress, he finds himself less useful. A personal note is made to find and learn more of the magical, and unearthy. Warily eyes move across the stacks. It would take some time, and what they seek may not even be within these papers. "Agreed."

Down the hallway, the conversational voices have ceased.

Turning towards the hallway, Ramar draws in a deep breath, shaking his head from side to side, slowly, surreally, as though in disbelief. The sword unsheathes itself silently. "Well then..." he whispers, voice raising enough to reach the others' ears, and theirs alone...

Rumika turns back towards the voices. "Let us go deal with our fellow cellmates," she says grimly. She leads the way back towards the black pool. She heeds stealth as much as she can, but she is no longer of the belief that they can hope to avoid being seen, now.

Davron's hands tighten around the handle of his bow, and an arrow whispers from its quiver. He nods to his companions, filing in behind them, prepared to back their advance with a hail of covering fire.

Easing from their places at his sides, up come the wicked tools into Chi-Yosh's hands. His body sings with the subtle pattern of essence, reflexes and nerves gifted like flexible steel.

The four men are waiting patiently, hands on their belt-knives, as they wait patiently. "We know you are present," one calls after a time, while the Solars creep unseen into the cubic chamber.

Rumika is careful, leading the group around the men, trying to get behind them. She's going to try and get in a position to put on a particularly painful clinch on one of them. The time for kid-gloves is over.

The water bubbles and boils, spilling out over the sides of the pit and splashing across the floor. The surface breaks. Four oily-black tentacles slide their way free, slapping at the floor and pressing down in support of some inhuman weight beneath. The water stirs still further, splashing about wildly. At last it disgorges a black, slick shape. At least a dozen slashes of brilliant red are visible, apparently eyes or something answering the same purpose. Pseudopodia extend from the quivering mass, waving about wildly like the feelers of an unholy insect. **Welcome, Anathema. I am ready to receive your sacrifice,** booms a directionless voice, deep as a giant's, and quavering as though spoken from a great depth of water.

Rumika doesn't shed her invisibility. It still has some use against the weaker men, at least. She rushes forward, using one of the pseudopods like a ladder, springing up it to aim two swift kicks right into the body of the demonic form before leaping away once more.

"Go crawling back to whatever miserable hell spawned you, demon." Ramar spits these words from his mouth, sending them echoing off of the chrysolbaras. The echoes of his words preced the sound of footsteps running across grown floors, and the flash of a blade through the air as the Solar calls upon the ambient powers of life to banish this darkness. Twice Ramar's sword strikes out, guided by the same Essence that now pervades his senses, bringing every scent, every sound sight and sensation to a crystal clarity, even the meaty slice of sword to black oily flesh...

As the unearthly horror writhes and shudders from iron-footed kicks and sword slashes, the four patricians scatter, pairing off and running for the other hallways leading away. Rabby darts off after one pair, growling loudly. If she has fear of the monstrosity the Solars now face, she does not show it.

Eight tentacles, alive and slick with the unimaginable grue of the dark pool, smash outward in four directions at the offending creatures who have dared to assault it in its very sanctum.

Chi-Yosh hurls himself to the side, essence boiling up his system as jutting walls make an impromtu staircase, Chrysoberyl turning dark under his shadow. Back arched, the Bronze Tiger stops and kicks backwards, bowing over the tentacles. Slapping palms on the stones, his spine snaps inward, bringing him to his feet, blades rising defensively.

The first of two tentacles slaps ringingly across Davron's bronze skin; the second sends him reeling back a few steps, but fails to make any major impression.

Ramar's feet are already in motion when he hits the ground. His sword flickers briefly, charged with Essence still dissipating, and the Solar plants the point of his blade in the living ground, scoring a pointed groove into it as he pushes upwards with his feet and arms, pushing off of the sword and the ground to vault over the onrushing tentacle. "You'll not claim any further lives demon..."

Both tentacles strike with the unholy fury of the creature, sending the Solar swordsman crashing against the cubed walls of the temple. There's a shattering sound, and Ramar slumps to the floor, motionless.

Rumika lands with slick gore from the body of the beast. Without a look backwards she leaps straight forward, her foot growing a dull claw that stabs easily into the ground and gives her better footing. Turning to see the tentacle swing across at her, she bends straight backwards, held there impossibly as her form stabs iron claws into the floor.

The tentacles find another target, slapping Rumika lightly and sending a shiver through her iron frame as she nimbly sidesteps and weaves. **Evasive mortals.. you'll tire soon!** the voice declares, booming through the temple. **And then I feed..**

Chi-Yosh, even as Ramar is shattered against the jutting wall, stiffens himself, then relaxes. His hands raise, before poising, as Essence and a calmness washes over him like a balming sea. He cannot rush to Ramar's aid; focus on the task at hand is what is needed. Watch and wait, act before acting. Now more crucial then ever.

Standing his ground while his companions scatter, Davron winces as the glistening pseudopods slam with terrible force into his bronzed body, but he somehow manages to roll with the blows. A greater pain to him is the crumpled body of his comrade-in-arms, and the cry of "Ramar!" is laden with anguish. Turning his wrathful gaze back on the chthonic monstrosity, the light of the Unconquered Sun flares into life on Davron's brow, and as he calls out in rage, "Here is _my_ offering!" his hand becomes a blur upon the bowstring, and a hailstorm of arrows scream through the air to return the favor... with interest.

The beast screams and writhes as Essence-laden arrows dart like lances of light toward its flabby, shadowy hulk. One tentacle is sheared off entirely by the force of the arrow; the others are damaged or crippled to lesser or greater degrees. **I'll have your skull yet, impudent godling!** hisses the thing as it twists about in pain.

Rumika charges the body of the Primordial spawn, but rather than strike it, she uses it again for a platform, using her form to cling to it as sure as firm sand as she leaps out at a mass of tentacles. She seeks to come down right atop them and with spikes from both hands and feet stab through them into the very floor before leaping away once more.

Chi-Yosh begins to move, and around him begins the curn of dem light singing off of steel. He draws closer to the bases of the tentacles before the twin scythes harvest black blubber. He slashes down, then rolls over a tentacle, leaving in his wake a stab, before jumping up between two and raking kamas across. As he moves, the gleam becomes more, a sparking that shines off the oily hide of thick flesh as the sickening sucks come to the ear, with each strike of his man-made pincers.

Another tentacle is sundered under the withering assault of the Easterner's edges, and the thing screams in rage. Its body shimmers and writhes, exploding outward in a shower of grue and shadow, as two tentacles appear, freshly formed, where the severed ones had grown.

His hands still trembling from the flood of Essence that just coursed through them, Davron pauses only for a split second as the creature's tentacles flash toward him again, then breaks into a run, circling around the central pool, ducking, leaping, and rolling as the pseudopods seek to bring silence to Davron's bowstring.

As the four tentacles spring outward, wickedly barbed talons of iron spring from their oily surfaces. The creature is exerting its uncanny powers to the utmost, and its raging appendages seek to strike down the menaces that have hurt it so.

Another pair of tendrils snake out and strike at Chi-Yosh, the cruel talons shredding flesh and seeking bone. They come away bloody. **Your flesh will be mine soon, o Anathema,** howls the beast from its oily depths.

Rumika glares at the swinging clubs of the beast's pseudopods, leaping up to dodge the first, and aiming to kick-off of it even higher in the air and flip right over the second attack.

Rumika's flight over the second is flawless; the monster anticipates it, though, and manages to reverse its pseudopod's course, sending Rumika tumbling to the roughly-shaped floor of the cube.

Davron tumbles to a halt before Ramar's prone body. Leaping to his feet, he cries out, "You will die first, creature of darkness!" His usual gentle demeanor is long gone, stripped from him by sheer wrath against the dark abomination that calls his Circle by names better applied to itself, and two more arrows sing through the air, propelled this time not by Essence but by the fire kindled in his heart.

Quivering with inhuman rage, the beast claws uselessly at the ground. **I'll have you yet, whelps.. This isn't over..**

Above Rumika her snake anima hisses in fury and as one they move forward like lightning. The tentacles are ignored and with a shrill scream the iron form of the solar hurls itself on its pitiless foe. She shreds at its flesh as if she were not interested in attacking, but trying to burrow into the very body of the monstrous shape, hooks, nails, and claws stabbing out from her arms as they smash like mauls against the gehenna spawn. Holding her fast, her toes turn into long barbed daggers, stabbing into the flesh of her enemy.

"When I am finished, you will need flesh." The pain only adds passion to his voice as the Su'Katan moves, taking a quick hop onto a tentacle and rushing down it. The oily cable with which he runs ripples with a thrash, but the Dawn only uses it as a springboard, launcing him up over the creacher. Down comes a kama, sinking into flesh and threshing, landing him atop the blobby creature. Finding one of Davron's arrows, he begins to carve the wound, once, twice, before a pained tremor sends him rolling over the slick side. Once more the steel rains to catch his fall, ripping into the beast before each is wrenched free as his feet touch the slick ground.

**You will remember the name of Nomolous,** the creature's sighing voice breathes, as it shrivels, though it is not quite yet dead. With a great burst of strength, its limbs explode outward, showering the room with a black and oily spray of immense foulness. From the other corridors, the familiar sound of steel pins sealing a vault can be heard. The party is trapped within.

Davron wipes the muck from his face. "And you will remember the name of Helios," he says, as the Copper Spider draws back the bowstring one last time, the lambent purple wings of the hawk-anima stretching across the fell chamber as one final arrow screams through the air, cutting the last thread of the creature's dark life.

The sheer force of enraged Essence propelling the arrow is like the sweep of the hawk's talons, and the dark bulbous form is flung from its perch above the black pit to slam against the far wall in a splash of black ichor, which drips from the cuboid projections and spreads in a puddle around the monster as its dripping, scarred tentacles tremble one last time, then collapse, limp.

Rumika narrows her eyes, even through the splash of foul fluids. "Nice shot," she says, emotionless. She shakes herself and comes slowly to her senses, rushing over to where Ramar lies, moving to check him. "You better not have gotten your fool self killed," she says, trying to sound angry.

Chi-Yosh can but spare a grim smile soaked in gore at the burst balloon that was something not of this world. Then he wheels, slidding through gunk on a rush to Ramar. Reaching the man he hurls his weapons aside and crouches to check him. "Rumika, Davron, check the halls."

Davron pants heavily, sparkles of Essence flying from the bowstring as it hums its way into silence. Then the golden bow clatters to the floor, as unheeded as Chi-Yosh's orders, as he turns behind him. "Ramar! Ramar, speak to me!" he cries, sobbing, kneeling beside the man as he checks for vital signs.

A thorough examination of the various hallways reveals much. There are indeed other repositories of paper records. Rabby returns, empty-handed - the four patricians of House Cynis escaped, and the four vault doors are all sealed. Doubtlessly the House's guards are massing outside even now, ready to strike down the exhausted and injured Solar party once the door seals are removed. Meanwhile, Rabby withdraws a crushed root and presses it carefully between Ramar's teeth, then forces him to chew. "The _yau ko_ root won't last for long," murmurs Rabby. "Let's try to find what you came for, then.." The rest does not require articulation. 'Then find a way out'.

"That tastes disgusting," murmurs Ramar as he is brought to consciousness once more. The Solar says little else after that. He stands on shaky legs, looks about, and stumbles towards one of the hallways, motioning for the others to follow us. "C'mon. We need... ugh... to find this thing. And fast."

Rumika moves to help Ramar walk, forcing him to hook an arm about her shoulders. "If there are only mortals barring our way, we may yet escape," says Rumika softly. She hopes that she sounds hopeful.

---

It is then that the three R's: Ramar, Rabby, and Rumika, go about flipping through the almost innumerable stacks of paperwork. There is precious little time, but as they are sealed in the vault, this is the primary concern here. And so the locks are picked or broken, and papers stacked and scattered across the floors.

Rabby shakes her head, tossing papers casually to one side as the Lunar works her way down a pile of particularly imposing papers, relying almost on instinct to find ones that may in fact be relevant. "No, no no, who in their right mind cares about... 'ten thousand dried apricots shipped to House Tepet' or 'Crops written off as losses'." Rumika is digging through one of the racks, iron-clad hands crinkling papers effortlessly while searching for names and dates and other such clues that will help connect the pieces of the puzzle to one another.

Though bruised and bloodied, Ramar manages to delve into a stack of paperwork, disturbing dust that's long since settled, sending it flying into clouds that will no doubt settle elsewhere. A few crumpled looking papers lay spread out at each corner of the Solar's body, the elemental poles of paperwork with Ramar as the Blessed Isle in this bureaucratic nightmare of a Creation. With a pained movement he reaches down and grabs hold of something. "Ahhh... here we are... I hope," groans Ramar, holding up what might be the very thing they have been looking for.

The root has run its course; Ramar keels over, unconscious, a blissfully happy smile of satisfaction on his face. He's done his job, and the demands of his tortured body once again assert themselves. It seems House Cynis received a messenger-spirit, offering the sale of hundreds of slaves at a very cheap price, no questions asked. In addition to this, Davron and Rumika spy something else, nestled nearby, a thing that stirs vague recollections in both.

It is a ring; a simple band of orichalcum, unadorned by jewelry. A tightly-wound scroll is nestled inside it. Sensing no danger, Davron slides the ring off and opens the papers within. They summarize attempts by sorcerers working with the house to communicate with the "soul in the ring" - progress is noted as frustrating, and no hint of unpleasantness or risk is indicated.

Outside, the party can hear the faint tappings of someone working. It seems the seals on the vault door are to be removed soon, though it is certain to be a slow process.

Rumika looks at the ring curiously, shaking her head. "Whatever mystery that might be, it must wait until later. Is there no way out but those doors, I wonder.." She frowns in thought, "I fear I don't have a great deal of strength left. We will have to either break through swiftly, find another path, or wind up in that pool."

Davron turns the ring over in his hand, marveling at the way the artifact seems unmarked by time - and his heart tells him that this ring has seen a vast amount of time indeed. "I suppose the soul in the ring didn't _want_ to talk to them," he says, his attention momentarily taken from the problem at hand. He looks through the gleaming golden band. "Perhaps it will talk to us..."

A few moments more, and Davron comes to a decision. The orichalcum ring is quickly worn, and Davron waits, as if listening for an unseen voice.

_Ah-hah! You're.... you're not you. Who are you?_ The voice is quaint and curious, lively and energetic, as it resonates in Davron's mind. _You are greater than the others, but you still don't even have mastery of the Celestial Circle. You're useless._

Davron breaks into a smile. _Not yet,_ he thinks in response. _But I know someone who does._ He slips the ring from his finger, and proffers it to Rumika. "It's for you," he says. Then blushes. "Uh, I mean..." he stutters, then shakes his head. "The soul in the ring needs someone more learned than I to wield it."

Rumika will offer a hand to Davron and grins. "If you would be so kind? Maybe I can shed some light on this ring of yours?" Even here, on the brink of disaster, she has to joke around.

The voice makes itself heard in Rumika's mind, after a moment or two. _Where'd you...? Oh, you aren't you either. You're not even the last you. But you're better endowed. Yes indeed, I can sense Celestial magic stirring in you._ Outside, the sound of work on the door's seals grows more audible.

Rumika arches an eyebrow, "I think I've just gained an admirer. I like them a little taller, I'm afraid." She asks of the ring, "Perhaps you are skilled yourself, little ring. We are in a tight spot. Do you have a way to help a few tired souls escape from trouble?"

The ring is silent for a moment. _Yes, yes I can. But you will need an infusion of Essence. The sorcery we're going to enact requires at least twenty-five motes of Essence. Have you a quick way to regain your power?_

"I'm going to need a loan, my friends," says Rumika softly. "Davron, if you could spare a little energy for me? I'm rather tired out. Just a little boost and we'll apparently get to survive this mess."

Davron nods. "It turns out I'm not quite as useless as he thought," he says, smiling, and gently rests his hand atop Rumika's. Closing his eyes, he focuses his not-quite-so-depleted reserves of life's energy, and the interface where bronze touches iron glows softly as the Essence flows into Rumika's body.

With the ring's guidance, Rumika begins chanting, slowly building up her reserves of reality's lifeblood and shaping them into an impossibility. More than once she falters, unused to this style of sorcery, but in the end the magic is successfully shaped. Everyone gathers close as a visible nimbus of Essence climbs from a ring on the floor and swirls wildly around the gathered Exalts, and as the last seals on the vault door are retracted and soldiers begin pouring through, the five vanish in a burst of power.

Seven Devils Clever is waiting calmly near the grate; she's stunned when a burst of Essence swirls out of nothingness nearby, and the shapes of her companions become visible in its center. The display fades, and the five stagger a little, trying to regain their equilibrium. The Lunar woman gives a wide grin. "Success?" Her only answer is an out-thrust hand, as Davron holds up a thick bundle of Cynis records for inspection. Nothing more need be said.

---

Soras Minan is overjoyed; her eyes burn with tears as she peruses the material brought back by her new-found associates. "This is.. this is far more than I could have ever hoped," he stammers, wiping her eyes with an already-wet hand. "The Council of Entities will see this... They will act, I promise you! I must go to them!" Preparations for her departure to meet with the Council are made, and the Realm abolitionist rides off into the early hours of the morning.

Chi-Yosh sits on the roof of the Inn, watching as the sun crests the skies, the blessed Presence of Helios sending sparkles across the skyscapes. First Age towers draw in the light and reflect it back like a land of prisms, bringing unnoticed cheer to the citizens of Nexus. The trip has been both good and bad, hard and hardening. But no matter the darkness of the night, the Unconquered Sun shall return.

"Remind me... never..." Ramar winces, clutches at his head, and decides that getting up and moving around is generally a bad idea at this point, "To try that again."

Davron shakes his head. "Rest, Ramar. That hellspawn gave you quite a beating. All of us, really." The archer's bruises are already fading, faster than normal, as his own magic knits the wounded flesh together, but he cannot yet help Ramar in the same way. Though he resolves that he will learn how, as soon as he can.

Rumika will admire her shiny new ring, and hope that she will have time to figure out all its secrets. And of course it gives her a chance to tease Davron more than a bit. "Oh, you know you are supposed to wait until I say 'Yes' before you slip the ring on my finger," she explains to him.

Davron blushes crimson as the sunrise. "Well, it was an emergency," he murmurs bashfully. But he looks back at her with a sheepish grin.

The joy of a safe return, and the rescue of loved ones, is mixed with more somber reflection.
