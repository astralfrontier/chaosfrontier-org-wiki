# Gods of Eden 2004-03-06

Gallius tosses and turns, her body wracked by the hazards of the hammock. The cat-like tail that is her trophy of victor over the Wyld hangs halfway over the edge, twitching feebly as she dreams.

In her dreams, blood and death hold sway. Warriors whose faces are painted crimson by the vitae of the slaughter shriek like animals, brandishing their blindingly-burning weapons and leaping toward their fellow berzerkers. There are no sides, there are no laws. It is the simple ferocity of hatred, unleashed on any moving thing in sight, a war of all against all. It has the tang of age to it, a foul reek of encrusted blood and accumulated layers of unclean grue building up beneath the skin as the centuries roll past. It was the time Before, the dying time, when the fire of the Solar empire was burnt down near to the embers. And here the madness lurks, swirling and consuming, feasting and feeding, until the unrestrained carnage and unending lust are blotted out into blackness.

Into the despairing depths of space the dream carries her, and through the stars. She orbits strange spheres that writhe and fall past burning alien suns. Other gods, whose names burn their imprint onto her memory, and those greater than the gods, the Primordials, who once held Eternity in their palms. These great worlds of silver and brown and melted gold fall away, and the stars attain their stately sweep across the heavens once again. The sound of rushing water grows steadily, and the stars shimmer, for they are seen in the depths of running water. Gallius finds herself, clad in the thin body of her early life again, on the banks of the River Near Home Off Where Sun Rises and staring down into the starry depths of the river after dusk. She wears her best white dress, and her bodyguards are just over the hill, within running distance.

A man is fishing nearby, up atop a high rock, his legs folded underneath him. A ruggedly handsome four-armed man, bearing tokens - a horn, a sword, and other things. Most of these are on the ground, though. He's casting a simple line into the water, letting it play out for a time before reeling it back in to try again. "Hello there," he calls, and Gallius feels the rush of her waking memories carrying her closer to him. "Come over here and sit with me, Gallius," calls Helios, making a beckoning sign with two fingers as he tries for a bite again.

Gallius looks down herself and furrows her brow. This is strange to her. But since her change, normal has been hard to come by. She will wander over to Helios and set herself down. She doesn't speak, but instead just looks at Helios, wondering if this is just a dream, or more.

"Do you know why the gods talk in secrets, Gallius?" asks the big warrior, turning slowly and smiling a little. "Why we are evasive, and don't always give you a straight answer? If I were you, I'd be pretty pissed off about it by now. 'If the gods know so much, why don't they start sharing? Even a map or a spellbook or something! Damnation!'" He chuckles softly. "If you said that, you wouldn't be the first of my Chosen to do so."

"I only wonder why we are broken, Lord Helios, and why you wish us to return. We nearly destroyed everything in our madness, did we not?" Gallius finds herself kicking her feet a bit and stills them. "Why trust us this time? We are the same sparks that betrayed your trust before, and I don't know how our new selves will fare any better."

In answer, the big man smiles. "I'll tell you a story. Once upon a time, ... well, once before there was time, really, there were the Primordials. They were called that because they came before time was woven. It was they who grew together and crafted what is now called the Loom of Fate. Each contained some vital aspect of true existence, but none of them could cooperate with each other. So they made the Loom, where their diverse natures could fuse safely, and they made other things, like the Well of Udr, which your friends are contemplating even now." Helios flashes a knowing wink, as if to say, _Aren't we naughty for breaking the rules like this?_ Nevertheless he continues speaking. "So they had this thing, but none of them could **understand** it. Its potential, its power, was beyond them. There was only one who even dimly understood what the Loom truly meant, and that was Gaia. And there was only one who could let the children of the Loom make any real use of it, and that was Autochthon."

"And so the gods came about. Your old legends say the Primordials created us. That's true, in a way. We were a natural consequence of the Loom. We **had** to exist. There will always be an Unconquered Sun, for as long as Fate endures, because there **must** be one." The sun-god smiles a bit, thinking about something, before returning to his narrative. "We, the gods, understood the Loom in a way no Primordial could. And because of that, and because of their power, we could not let them do what they would have done anyway - destroy it, through their own alien natures. Left alone, they would have pulled apart, and all would be lost, for us, and for you. At the same time, because we were so integral to its function, we couldn't distance ourselves from it. We could not destroy that which was to destroy us. Not directly."

Helios sighs. "We fought, through you, our Chosen. And we triumphed. Not only for ourselves, nor for our children, nor for the mortal charges even then coming into being within the Loom. No, what we fought for was change. The right to grow, to become. The cycle of existence, rather than the endless, changeless omnipotence of the Primordials. Do you understand?"

"I understand," says Gallius. "If they were omnipotent, my Lord, how did you win? And is it the Primordials who have essentially tainted the Solars for all time? Is it going to be my fate to fight to restore order only to turn into a destroyer? Will it come to pass that one day I will need to be struck down to save the world?"

"Because, in joining together in the Loom, they could be changed," Helios replies. "Their Essences mingled, split apart, and became unique individuals in their own right. The Exalted defeated those fragments, and in doing so, they changed the fundamental nature of the Primordials. As for your fate... it is possible for you to become another tyrant, striking down any who offend you. It is also possible for you to become a glorious ruler, whose name is remembered until the stars have burned out."

"And how can I make the world right again? I wish to become a worthy ruler, but Creation is suffocating. Men have fallen to base evils. They sell their own kind to the Fair Folk, they sell drugs that destroy their own people. I see few peaceful ways to stop them," says Gallius. "It is wearying, my Lord. I am a Zenith, but I find myself wavering. I'm afraid."

"Grow at your own pace. Solve the world's ills a nation at a time." The god chuckles softly, then points. "Look there. The river is running at its own pace. Nothing stands before it, and yet it does not hurry unless there is a flood. Nor does it stop flowing, even at the command of the greatest of mortal kings."

"Though Solars can find a way to make it stop," murmurs Gallius softly. "I have much to learn, but I am impatient. I want to do many things, and now there is little denying it. My sister was right. I am the Lioness. Now I even have a tail to go with it." She adds playfully, "And if Valon puts a finger on it without my permission I'm going to throw him overboard.."

"The lioness knows when to sleep," counsels Helios. "She knows when her cubs need attention. She knows when to hunt. You too know these things, Gallius. Have faith in yourself. You torment yourself with visions of death and madness, but why? Does it serve you to imagine yourself as the next tyrant? Or does it instead distract you from what's important to you?"

"If I do not remember what was, I am afraid I shall make it happen again," says Gallius. "And part of me still seeks some sign that the time is ripe. The lives of mortals are short, my Lord. I know I can make them better and let them live as they should. But there are thousands upon thousands who will stand in my way. Many of them are Chosen themselves. The children of the Dragons, the children of Luna, and of course the Chosen of the Maidens, as well. I don't even know if I can rely on my own kind anymore!" She laughs softly and clutches a rock, sending it skipping across the water. "So, why is it that you don't you give us the tools and knowledge to make our jobs a lot easier?"

Helios speaks. "Humanity stands where we once did. We are afraid to meddle with you, afraid of becoming like the Primordials we sealed away, gazing like addled narcissists at our own reflections. We don't want to meddle in the unguessable greatness you and your kind will become. And so we stay our hand, and let you stumble, because we know you will soon walk."

"And many of us shall fall," says Gallius softly. "But better to fall doing what is right than to betray our cause. I wonder what questions I can even ask.. I suppose I would like to know what the Fair Folk are.. why they exist, and also the Abyssals. It seems my fate shall lead to many wars with them, and the signs I have seen show little hope for a truce."

"You've seen the Wyld first-hand, Gallius. Even you haven't faced its true depths. You met its most shallow aspects. What was your opinion of it?" asks the god.

"It is nothing and everything," says Gallius. "It seems like a source for existance itself, and yet without something to hold it fast, it is of no constant shape." She frowns, "And though it can be tamed into becoming, it seems far more eager to destroy those solid things that exist. I wonder how it is kept at bay, and how the Fair Folk have come from it."

Helios nods. "Just as the Loom of Fate drew identity and individuality out of the Primordials, it draws those known as the Fair Folk out of the chaos of the Wyld itself. They are nothing other than infinite potential given finite form. They are not men or monsters. They are simply passions. Like emotions given bodies."

"But yet they are destroyed and dangers to men," says Gallius. "If the Fair Folk must consume men to survive, it seems a very large war would be inevitable. That is for another day, though. It is tiring enough to think of tomorrow, and next week shall only be more difficult. It is going to be a wearying road."

Helios chuckles. "Are they any more or less dangerous and lethal to men than anger, lust, jealousy or greed?" he asks quietly.

"Perhaps not," says Gallius. "But their presence may be easier to remove." She sighs and lays back on the grass, staring up at the sky. "How long do Solars live?" she asks abruptly.

"Depends on the Solar." The sun-god muses a moment. "Four or five millennia are certainly reasonable. The spiritually-advanced of the First Age's Chosen was easily seven to nine. Longevity sorcery and anti-agathics improved that somewhat. They were very clever people, you know."

Gallius laughs softly, "I suppose they were. They just didn't have much for self-control in the end, it would seem. Why is it I remember parts of the past? Why do I remember being Ma-Ha-Suchi's wife?" She adds with a grin, "It's very irritating."

"You'll want to ask Lytek about that," advises the man, smiling. "He's responsible for that sort of thing, and he's very hmm, possessive about his particular craft."

"He apparently likes bad jokes," says Gallius. "Do you dote this much over all your solars, or am I some special pet project? I don't suppose you would tell me just how many Solars are out there, nor where a few might be? It'd be nice to start seeing some unity. Every other Exalt seems to have some kind of hierarchy. We ought to have our own. We need one rather desperately."

"Then make one," suggests the Sun. "How would you go about finding them, do you suppose?"

"At this point I'm not very certain," says Gallius. "I am supposed to meet a few others, and if I wish to arrange something, I must supply a few things. I don't know that I can ask my father to allow us to meet there, and.. it may be foolish, but I do not wish to return home, save in triumph, when many of the things I wish to do are already accomplished."

Helios nods. "Alright then. Who do you know who already goes about finding Solars?" he asks, persisting.

"The Master," says Gallius. "I will have to ask him. Though that still leaves me with the small challenge of finding a place with the courage to let us gather. If we are to form as a cohesive group, we must have a place where we can exist without hiding in the shadows. We are Chosen of the Sun. We are meant to be seen, and in so give hope to those around us."

Nodding, the sun-god claps a hand on the shoulders of his guest. "Then I believe in you, Gallius," he says simply. "I have faith in your success."

"If you can't tell me where hidden things are, perhaps you provide other information, Lord Helios. Was there a high king in the past? And if there was someone, what sign of station did they bear?" Gallius can't help but ask. "I would guess that there must have been some kind of high council to manage things."

"Sure. They had the Solar Deliberative." Helios muses. "You should be able to look it up in Yu-Shan. There are some gods who still keep a more extensive history on it. But the true symbol of Solar authority always has been, and always will be, here..." He reaches forward, tapping Gallius on the forehead very lightly. "There is no symbol that'll make people turn to you again. But it is in your power to make the symbol you have respected again."

Gallius hmms quietly. "And here I was hoping I could just find a crown, save the prince, and ride off into the sunset," she says. "Oh well. But one would think they had some sign of station. I was hoping to find something from the First Age for the Solars to rally around. Some sign to enflame hearts that are tired and worn out. We will have much to do, and we will suffer greatly in achieving it. What is coming is a terrible conflict, perhaps the most dangerous since the Solars were struck down."

"Don't you think success is the best sign of all?" the god asks, gently. "What would give you more heart than to know your fellow Chosen had won some important battle?"

"I would think we've done that already," says Gallius. "The first battle. The next is far larger, and far more lives hang in the balance. And after that.. still more. I am a spear that shall grow rather weathered in the years to come. I wonder what the other Solars have done. Probably they are still gathering power, I imagine. If we are in small circles, though, we will be more easily destroyed, and many may work towards the same goal only to undo each other."

Helios shakes his head. "And what have the others heard of that battle? Perhaps some have. Some haven't. Why not find them, and let them know there is hope?"

"I will do my best," says Gallius. "You have a way of answering certain questions and avoiding others. And yet I don't think you really enjoy being mysterious, my Lord. You are far more informal and direct than I imagined you would be. But it seems correct. The Sun does not sneak into the sky like a thief in the night, but charges over the horizon and banishes the darkness. Even when you are covered in clouds you are revealed to us."

"Gallius," the man says, with a tender tone in his voice. "You are no longer a child." And so it is; the woman finds herself, clad as before, tail and all, fully grown. "I can't protect you forever, even if I could. But I love you, I love all of you, and you have survived everything that has faced you, and for that I am proud as well. You have the strength to succeed."

Gallius looks over herself and smiles. "And all of us adore you in our own ways, my Lord. It is simply that some of us have little skill in expressing such things," she says quietly. "It is your love that I treasure more than your pride in me, though. Even when I fail I can hope that it shall last. I will do my best for you." She lets out a soft sigh, "First we must unite. Then we must act in concert. With the help of the Sidereals who are still true to us we may yet succeed.. if our circles hold true. There will be failures, of course. We are still much as we were, and though our spans and powers have increased, what is inside has not changed so much." She smiles sadly, "There shall be war. Wars so terrible that it might seem that death shall take us all. And all that we love will be risked in what is to come, but in risking it we shall love it better. And then, when all is done, there will be a music unlike any that has been heard in ages. The free voices of everyone shall lift togethe

And then, when all is done, there will be a music unlike any that has been heard in ages. The free voices of everyone shall lift together in one chorus, and that will be the sign that my task is complete."

"Yes, you understand," the sun-god says with pride. "It will be difficult, but that difficulty is necessary for you to come into your own."

"Still.. I wish it could be over more quickly," says Gallius. "There are many I would save. Can you tell me what the role of the Dragon-Blooded is to be? Or is that all left up to us to define for ourselves? There seem to be few expectations, save that we will be what we are."

"Yes, you undestand completely," the god says again. "You are the arbiters of the world order. That is your power, and your destiny. You have the power because I believe that you will not squander it."

"Then I will carve a realm for my Solars and gives us a safe place to gather, and then we will go about rescuing men from the evils of the world." Gallius grins and adds, "And if I manage all that I plan on taking at least a day off."

"Feel free, you'll have earned it by then," chuckles the Solars' patron. "So how do you feel?"

"Eager," says Gallius. "And as restless as ever. But I think you picked me for that reason. There's always a fire under my ass." She laughs and asks, "I can use that word with you, right? I'm not sure just how lax we're supposed to get. Then again, it is my dream, after all, isn't it?"

"Yeah, it is. But this is my fishing spot, so don't screw with it," warns the god, sternly.

"Bah, I know where this place is," says Gallius. "And I think I can show you a better spot, if you really plan on catching anything." She looks at the line Helios is using. "So what exactly does the Unconquered Sun use for bait, anyway?"

"Anything he wants," mumbles the god, reaching for his pole.

"Well, a gold brick probably won't catch much," says Gallius. "Oh, by the way, how is it that each of the Exalted is somehow bound to a certain material?" She doesn't wait much for a more serious question, "And umm.. what do you think of the Chosen of Luna?" She's beating around the bush a bit with that one. There's a specific one she wants to ask about.

"The Primordials whose essences wove this world each contributed something. An element, or a concept." Helios casts, and continues talking. "The symbols you know, the sun and moon, the magical materials, and so forth, are all products of some Primordial's nature. The Exaltation builds on the strengths and qualities of its components. The Solar Exalted are what they are because I am what I am."

Gallius nods and listens closely. "I imagine we'll need lots of gold and orichalcum to keep our friends well-equipped. But there should be craftsmen among them who can prepare things in peace while the rest of us get entangled in all matter of strife."

"Probably," Helios says. He tugs at the pole a bit, playing the line out through the river. "So when are you two going to start screwing?"

Gallius blinks and raises her eyebrows. She laughs a bit. "You mean Valon? I don't know. He can be so charming sometimes, and more than once I wished he would show me some of that animal impulse these Lunars boast about, and then of course he has to go and be the perfect gentleman. You'd think he would have better instincts. Next time I am in Yu-Shan I'm going to go to Luna and complain!" She laughs out loud, "She might find that funny. But poor Valon would be so embarassed."

"The Lunars are many-faced, and I hear Valon is no exception," smiles the Sun. "Now, you're about due for waking up, I think.... Have heart."

"See you around, dad," jokes Gallius, winking at Helios. "And if we have kids maybe I'll name the first one after you." With that, she lets herself go and drift away from the dream, and back towards the waking world.

---

Valon hasn't said a word, as the sky-ship drifts through the higher sky on its way north. He's just bunched over, thick elbows atop his knees, staring. Usually at Gallius as she passes. Finally, he breaks the silence. "It looks good on you. Really."

Gallius turns to Valon and tilts her head, giving him a curious look. Her tail thrashes for a moment, and then resumes its more even and controlled motions. "I suppose it might," she says, watching the Lunar closely. She turns her back to Valon and twitches the tail in his face, "You want to touch it, don't you?" she asks, teasing more than a bit.

"No, no.." The Lunar seems distracted. "But it's a nice touch, nonetheless. Makes you look exotic." He reaches up to scratch his head with a hand, then continues staring vacantly.

"What's got your head in the clouds, Valon?" asks Gallius. She will set herself down in front of the Lunar, lying lazily on her side. "You've been quiet, and you've been staring at me."

That pulls the elder Lunar out of his reverie, and he looks up, smiling. "Well, don't worry, I'm not thinking anything inappropriate. I'm 1900 years your senior, easily. Just thinking about the people I know. Uka, Prowler, Spider Woman, Sunrise Seer, and the rest. I wonder what they're going to do now."

Gallius snorts, "I wonder if those 1900 years drained your.." She coughs and realizes she's not talking to Helios right now. "What do you mean? I imagine they'll do whatever they think is best. What else?"

"Well..." Valon hmms. "If Ma-Ha-Suchi goes to war, we're almost certainly obligated to follow along. I just wonder if he isn't being impulsive, just to goad you and the other Solar Exalted into rushing. The Solars are the one unknown in his calculations, I imagine."

"I will go to him," says Gallius. "He did not reveal his plans without purpose. I will not betray him or fail him. He is old, and though he is crude, he is worthy of respect. And his cause is undeniably just. I do not ask any to follow me against my will, nor should anyone go who does not feel the way I do." She sighs softly and drums her fingers. She is going to tell Luna how clueless he is. Completely without a clue.

Valon smiles. "Well, maybe he'll like your tail too?" he suggests.

"Don't be absurd," says Gallius. "I have no interest in him, if you couldn't figure that out. Ahh! You are hopeless, Valon, if you couldn't even figure that much out! I thought you Lunars were so good with your instincts."

"We're good with our tongues too," says Valon, innocently. "We can craft the words we want to use, hmm?"

"And what words are those?" asks Gallius. She meets Valon's eyes and just stares at him. "If you are good with your tongue, then maybe you can say something useful. You don't have to worry about the other Lunars. All you need to think of is yourself. What do you want, Valon?"

Valon scratches his head, looking thoughtful. "Me? I'd like to go hunting for dinner when we land. Gettin' hungry."

Gallius sighs. "I can't believe you," she mutters. "I try to be serious and you are nothing but a clown." She rolls onto her back and stares up at the sky. "You know... hmm.. nevermind." She frowns and shakes her head.

Valon smiles, rising from his seat. "Yeah, I know," he says, "and yeah, nevermind. Let's go sightseeing, hmm? We should get some beautiful jungle terrain if we look down."

"I suppose," murmurs Gallius quietly. "You know, Valon.. I'll always have you to remind me that conquering whole nations isn't really that tough. At least not as difficult as a stubborn, old Lunar." She rocks back, and then kicks herself to her feet.

"Being tougher than national conquest is what being a Lunar is all about," retorts Valon, chuckling. "It's our destiny."

"I guess," Gallius says. She stares down at the jungle and yawns. "Trees," she mutters. "Yeah, sure is a great view." Her excitement knows no bounds, clearly. "I think my destiny is to be eternally frustrated. But I'll get used to it."
