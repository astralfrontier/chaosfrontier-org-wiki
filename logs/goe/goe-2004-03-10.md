# Gods of Eden 2004-03-10

The General is no wise man, but he is at least wise enough to know it. His mercenaries have been hired for a great attack against slavers outside Nexus. Rumors had come to him of a Dawn Caste Solar in Nexus who announced himself publically, and the matter of the slavers transpired with unusual suddenness. House Cynis had found itself suddenly unwelcome in the city, and the General's mind, though not as keen as some, was tactically sound. Troop movements are the same throughout Creation, even if the troops were Heaven's own.

The city of Great Forks has stood for generations. Since its founding, it has dwelt in the presence of one of the great Deathlords, and yet the city's ruling spirits have held that power at bay with strange pacts and tales of magical power. And in that place have mingled humanity, the little gods and spirits of Creation, and the primal, powerful elementals. Each has their place, and each can be valuable to a seeker. Those who live in the city know much of the mystical doings in the Scavenger Lands; information comes to the inhabitants through many channels.

The artfully-wrapped bedroll and backpack he bears conceal a wondrous sword greater than any mortal man could wield; but the General is no mortal man. In that time he has dealt with the Council of Entities in Nexus, battled the demon Sinabulos and rescued a fellow Exalt from implacable enemies. The spark that burns in his soul has been as well-concealed as his sword, and now he seeks a brighter flame still. Now that no sign of the Dawn Caste or any hypothetical companions can be found in Nexus itself, he has come to Great Forks for answers.

The General passes through the gates, bowing his head as he mingles with the crowd around him. The guardian ifrits, blazing with flame, arms folded sternly, inspect each passing figure with a smoldering glare. Nevertheless they do not challenge him. The city itself, with its brilliantly-lit spires and snapping penants, shines with an inner light. Vine-choked walls stand next to open-air cafes where God-blooded sip glowing wine from crystal glasses; the cries of a thousand priests of a hundred gods can be heard distantly in the air, while in one corner a group of three Immaculate monks look distinctly uncomfortable.

The General follows his leads with care; his time in Nexus has given him a harsh education on how one deals with the powerful. He questions, and bargains, and promises, and bullies. In the end he is directed to the shrine of a god of horses, near the gates of the city. "Match my prized pupil in a test of endurance," this god challenges him, and the General obeys. The stallion he is to race awaits him beyond the confines of the walls, and with the god in observance, they leap toward the western horizon like twin streaks of lightning.

The General is strong, and fierce; though human, he is of hardier stock than any mortal horse, no matter how well-bred. His immortal inheritance shines through his body, reinforcing his strength and power. He runs, and he runs, until the wind itself strains to keep up with him. And in the end, as he and his rival streak to the end of the allotted run and halt, both panting for air, the god approached. "Well done, Chosen," it intones. "I shall tell you what you seek. A woman, scion of Roleyn, those who are fast friends with the Marukani. She is one of those you seek."

---

The General is clever and determined. His subtlety is not that of the clever diplomats with their smiling masks and their guarded eyes, nor the millennial-old mysteries of the arcane scholar. His subtlety is that of the stealthy warrior, the soldiers moving through terrain toward a foe guided by the wisdom of their leader, of the tiger preparing to pounce on its prey. And with his force and drive he seeks answers. "A man of the east, a warrior and healer," is the rumor of the spirits of wood, whose delegation have approached the spirits of Great Forks as an emissary. "Lord of the Maze. It is he who revealed himself in your city - this we know." And so the General travels east, taking passage anonymously on the barges that seek upriver, drawn by the lush riches of the Scavenger Lands.

Nor is the Maze Forest difficult to find. It has grown wide, and the crafty and cunning elementals who guard its ways will allow no traveler through. Nevertheless they will speak, and the General has come prepared to make his supplication to the wood-spiders who spin their cunning nests in the trees. They whisper to him of the man who has sworn himself to their defense, and the lands in which he might be found. Nodding, the General thanks them with a blessing of Essence and proceeds on his way.

---

The Council of Entities has granted an audience to Soras Minan; her associates have opted to stay behind, feeling (rightly so) that the personal attention of this body is not always to be desired. Long-suspected notions and deeply-buried doubts surface; the hefty bribes House Cynis provides the city were once enough to assuage too much inquiry, but the House has overstepped itself. An example will have to be made.

Within a day, those of the House who have not fled are collected and ritually skinned. Their flesh is given over to a group of unsavory skin-changers, hereditary Wyld-touched creatures that Minan whispers of in the party's inn. She uses the lowest of tones, and even then the quaver in her voice is audible. It is they who will impersonate the House members during the purchase, and they who will signal the hundreds of mercenaries to throw off their slave-disguises and fall upon the slavers, once their captives are clear. The Solars are joined by Gallius at the last minute, and carefully they outline the strategy to her before taking their own positions.

And as the throng milled about on the high plain several miles east of Nexus, on the southern bank of the Yanaze River, the conclusion of the war in Greyfalls, and the rescue of one important to a Circlemate settles over the disguised Solars like a fine ocean mist. A palpable sense of abated horror runs through their blood as they prepare for, and then ultimately commit to battle, as the signal is given.

The rags and chains that anchored nothing did not matter to Chi-Yosh. He threw them off and claimed his weapons not as a warrior for glory or conquest, but as a healer. Boils must be lanced to remove the sickness inside, limbs must be severed to save the body. He was removing filth and corruption from Creation. But just as he must cause pain, he comes to heal the broken backs of the slaves. Iron links are their illness, one which cuts deeper then the skin. The dojo strenghtens with discipline, Nexus soothes with a home, and he will cure them with freedom. To cure Willow, Davron's kin, and thus, Chi-Yosh's kin.

Rumika comes for love. Love of friends and love of those who are suffering. In her is a desire to see all things flower and achieve their complete beauty. She has no wish to live among so many people, but her powers were given to be used as she would, and she would see all things of beauty be saved from the ugliness of brutality. Slavers may go where they will, she has no hunger for vengeance, she wishes to save the victims, not punish the guilty.

_And so it comes to it. We set the trap for the slavers. They will doubtless be able to fight back, even if we catch then by surprise. It falls to me now to join in._ Ramar walks slowly back and forth under the shadow of an alleyway. He casts a glance at the Sun above, "I know. Its going to be dangerous. Help me through this. My friends need me. Those who may die otherwise need me." _I worry. Davron is angry at these men. I myself once fell pray to twisted hearts such as these. Yet, the slavers may still learn. These mercenaries are not being paid for their mercy, but I will see what can be done. It is the right thing to do regardless._ And so Ramar takes his thoughts, his silent worries and his doubts, and with slow rhythmic breathing, he expels them. Fear turns to confidence, doubt to strength, worry to determination. A smile spreads on his face as he salutes the air with a flourish of his sword. "Very well then."

Ramar allows himself a quiet moment to run his fingers over the spots on his wrists that had been bound a lifetime ago in a blood-red mesa deep in the South. "Let it never be said that justice is without a sense of poetry." He calls to mind the faces of those who did not survive the capture and sale. "Rest in peace my friends. Ghosts long since put to rest need not be disturbed, but if you happen to look in on the world today" He winks towards the sky, "Know that I remember you." With that the Solar heads to join his friends.

Lady Gallius of House Leom comes for justice. She comes changed, torn by the Wyld, the fierce power that has made her incapable of denying her destiny. The Lioness has a tail, now, and yet her mind is calm, more confident than ever. In her left hand is strength, but it is the work of her right that shall truly move the world, and her greatest weapon shall be the written word, though today is a spear day, and justice shall be bloody, but if freedom faces strong opposition that will not turn away, it must be destroyed.

Rabby went in because she had something to prove. Nobody but Luna might ever see it, but to Rabby, that was good enough - Luna's opinion, ultimately, was what mattered to her Chosen. And if the Solars she traveled with saw it too, so much the better. They might support her when it came time to stake her claim to the territory she desired, and even this glimmer of bravery would help make up for the glory she lacked. Lunars respected the cunning, the brave, the bold and the wise, but they respected most those who could be all at once, to a greater or lesser degree. It was time to show that the cat had claws after all.

And finally, Davron went in to exorcise, once and for all, the memory of that fateful night in Greyfalls when he saw his beloved cousin being dragged away in chains. The agony, the grief, the rage he felt to see her helpless, captive - magnified a hundred, a thousandfold as he imagined the eyes and hearts of the other slaves' friends and family, had they seen what he had seen. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step - and now, by putting this slaving ring to an end once and for all, he would take a step toward a world where none would ever have to feel that pain again.

Though Davron normally was the very image of gentleness, the battle tapped a river of righteous wrath that flowed hidden beneath the surface of his soul. Faced with the crimes of the slavers, it was his compatriots fighting by his side, as much as his own better nature, that helped him keep the flood of rage in check - to let justice, not revenge, guide the hand that pulled the bowstring, and to show mercy to those slavers that surrendered.

The slavers are, understandably, caught off-guard. Even their exceptionally paranoid precautions had not guarded them against this, treachery in the final hour of their desperate flight. And now, as blood seeps from a thousand cuts and staring faces gaze out in pale surprise, the slavers die with one thought, one question on their lips: "How?" A dozen, then a hundred, earth elementals pour out of the ground, springing to the slavers' defense, and these are dispatched just as swiftly as their mortal charges. Where one of the concealed Solars is not present, an elite squad of the assorted mercenaries is ready, and the extraordinary aid dries up almost as it is offered from the earth. Dusk finds the battlefield a sea of blood, and the priests sent by the city begin the process of burial and sanctification. There would be many hungry ghosts in the midnight hour otherwise.

---

Gallius stands beside Jin-nu, using the shirt of a dead slaver as a rag to wipe his blood from her spear. The lady pauses a moment, then stoops down, tearing some of the cloth away and turning to Jin-nu. "Your turn," she says softly. The horse stoops her beautiful head, and Gallius wipes the blood from her pale horn. "The blood of the guilty will score even the hardest of things in time," the zenith murmurs softly.

"It seems the battle has gone well," remarks Ramar, as he wills the wounds on his body to staunch themselves. "And I find you two alive." Ramar smiles, "It is good to see you again Gallius, and you as well Jin-nu. How fare you? How is the city?"

"The blood is guilty, but from that guilt will spring new hope," offers the Su'Katan behind Gallius. "This place will be a great field for crops, with the river silt and richness of blood." The Eastern warrior sidles up beside her and Jin-nu, offering a curious glance. "Something looks different. New armor? A cut of your hair?"

"Well whatever it is, I'm sure there's an interesting tale behind it," remarks Ramar, as innocently as a newborn babe. Or thereabouts.

Gallius snorts softly, and her tail thrashes. "Acceptance of that which I cannot change, and the will to do everything else that is required of me," she answers. "Much has happened while you were away, and yet I see you have not wasted any time here, my friends." She glows for a moment, her hand extending out towards the dead slaver. With a sudden rush of radiance his body is consumed utterly. "Even the evil do not deserve to linger as ghosts."

Ramar smiles. "No. None deserve that fate. When the time comes, and life is spent, it is best we all pass from this world peacefully. But this is not the time for such talk. There will be time enough for that... but now, now we should rest, and tend to what needs tending while we catch up with one another."

"Much has happened for all of us. We will share over something to drink, once all has been handled. There is much ahead of us to accomplish, but now we may rest." A pause from Chi-Yosh, surveying the field, pleased to see there are very few wounded, who are being taken away now.

"Do these free people have a place to stay?" asks Gallius. "It is a long way from their homes, I imagine. I hope these slavers have enough silver on them to buy these people passage back to their homes." She frowns thoughtfully, "I am not sure how much is left of the money we came across, nor do I wish to return to Greyfalls just yet."

This question occupies Gallius' attention sufficiently, and she spends a bit of time inquiring. It turns out that the holdings of House Cynis are being seized by the Council of Entities wholesale. A number of merchants and shippers are solicited (after swearing oaths of proper conduct) to provide transportation; the lowest bid will probably win. Thus does Nexus enrich itself off the spoils of the House, divest itself of those who would otherwise become beggars far from their home, and reward the competitive spirit of its merchant-princes, all at once. For such is the way of the city of Nexus.

"Well, that at least is good news," murmurs Gallius. She has the answers she needs. "And all will end as well as it could at this point. The weak have been freed, the evil have been banished, and justice is sated. House Cynis has paid a bitter price. Perhaps they will learn? Hope for that kind of cure is not to be given-up utterly, I think. Even the dying may find healing."

"Even the dead may learn the error of their ways," comments Ramar as he rejoins Gallius once more. "I am glad that things went as they did. And I am glad that you arrived. What news of Greyfalls? Why do you not wish to return there so soon? Is there some trouble there?"

Chi-Yosh shakes his head as he overhears Gallius. Although he is tempted to tell of House Cynis' deal with that which no mortal nor Exalt should meddle, he knows the woman of Roleyn, and she will take the tale with a fire to see it put to an end all over Creation. But not yet. Small steps are needed, for they are but fresh Exalts.

"I have done all I can to heal the city, Ramar," says Gallius. She lets out a small sigh, and goes on. "A great spirit of healing and growth has been brought to the city. I do not know what tasks I may have to do, but I imagine the city will by now be in full bloom, blessed with fertility. To arrange this, however, I have made a deal with the Sidereals. Fortunately they wish what I wish, and that is to keep the Realm away from Greyfalls." She suddenly laughs, "I think they will be very angry the next time they see me, however. We Solars trouble them to no end. Soon a far larger holding of Realm interests shall be broken."

"If Greyfalls is not your destination," Asks Chi-Yosh as the four move through the field, looking for Davron, "Where are we headed next?" The man has his own plans, a few things he wishes to do, but the Circle is ambitious, and with it he will go.

"Yes, I am curious as well. There are bound to be many interesting turns on our road together, I am looking forward to seeing where the next one shall take us." Ramar smiles, then ponders Gallius, "Might I ask about the deal you have made with the Sidereals?"

"I am headed to the north," says Gallius. "To complete my promise to a friend. And after that, to Harborhead, to accept a challenge. I would be honored if you would come with me, but I do not ask you to if you do not wish it. The deal I made with the Sidereals was to prevent the Realm from sending legions against Greyfalls without bloodshed."

Chi-Yosh, from the Eastern reaches, has not seen the bitterness he has only heard in tales of the North. "I would enjoy joining you for a time. I will only come with you to Harborhead if your challenge permits."

"Preventing bloodshed is always good." Ramar manages a chuckle as he jokes, "Even theirs. As for going to accept a challenge... well I would be honored to help if I knew more of what it was I am going to go help you accept." He stretches upwards, "In any case, may I join you in goign to the North? It's been a while since I've last seen the frozen lands... it would be nice to visit them once more."

"We will go together, then," says Gallius. "And the challenge is to conquer Harborhead, of course. My former mate is going there, and if he thinks I shall simply let him go and have all the glory for himself, he is sorely mistaken. Besides, he will no doubt make a terrible mess of things in the end."

There are many things Chi-Yosh wishes to do. From discovering the ancient city of Luriel's, and other important business before his service to Azel is needed. With so many prospects before him, though, it is a hard choice. "Tell us more of Harborhead." The promise of Lunars presence could mean Lunar allies in the future.

"And are you sure he isn't just hmmm..." Ramar pauses thoughtfully, "Inviting you? Perhaps sending a message to you to have your presence there that he might use you and whomever else he might to whatever ends he seeks in Harborhead?"

"Lunars do not use people in my experience. At least not in the way that others do," says Gallius. "I will be useful to him, of course, but he is not manipulating me so much as challenging me. He wants to measure me against what I once was. I will not ignore his words." The lady smiles and lets out a sigh, "Besides, it is my desire to go there. So much the better if I can fight beside Ma-Ha-Suchi and whatever other Lunars come to his aid. We are meant to stand beside each other. In any case, we will talk more of this later."

"As you wish." Ramar nods slowly, "I am a little more wary of the, Gallius. Fighting is fought just as valiantly with words and schemes as it is tooth and sword. Nevertheless, I shall go with you to Harborhead. I would like to see the events unfold there. To observe there and to learn." He smiles, "And I will offer you whatever aid I might. But you are right... we should talk more of this later. Let us go find Davron and celebrate our reunion with a meal together."

---

Davron moves amongst the freed slaves, a bandage wrapped around his head to conceal the last glowing embers of his caste mark. He'd never wanted to let it show at all today, but the children of the Earth had forced his hand - and now, now that he will see Willow again, he hopes to spare her the reminder of their last parting. The thought that she may have seen him in the battle is pushed away - he can wait no longer to see that she is safe, even if she still fears him as Anathema.

And finally, there she is - at the edge of a small crowd of refugees. Davron hesitates, his heart in his throat - even when he faced Nomolous itself, he had not been so nervous as this. "Willow?" he whispers... then, louder, "Willow!"

Willow's eyes grow wide. "I know that voice..." she whispers, as she turns to face him. "Davron? ... Davron, is that you?" says the woman, wonderingly, as the young Solar comes up to her, his hand clasped to his chest. There is a long, awkward pause, that to Davron feels like a lifetime. Then, finally, she reaches a trembling hand to his brow, to the spot his headband conceals. "Is... is it still there?" she asks.

Davron blinks, then nods, tears forming in his eyes. "Yes," he says, his own voice quavering. "Without it, we never would have found the slavers... and we'd certainly never have been able to stop them." When she doesn't answer right away, he stutters, "I, I'm glad to see you're safe now," and makes as if to turn away. "I, I'll just..." And that's as far as he gets before Willow throws her arms around him, sobbing. He puts his arms around her, sighing deeply, and whispering, "It's all right... it's over... you're free now..."

Rumika follows Davron from a distance, but says nothing and does nothing, save to watch him curiously. The sign of acceptance makes her smile and, seeing things here are all in-hand, she turns away. For her a long journey lies ahead, along a path that she does not yet see before her. Little does she know her destiny is about to be bent from her wishes to serve a greater good.

Davron is in tears as well, tears of relief, not only that his cousin is alive and well, but that she hasn't pushed him away. After a while, another question, one that has been eating at him for weeks now, finally demands to be asked: "How did this happen, Willow?" he whispers, gently. But perhaps he could never have asked it gently enough, for the woman bursts into tears anew, and he can do nothing but console her. "Hush... hush... we'll talk about it later," he murmurs, his eyes closing shut again. Although he will learn the details later - about the slave raid on his village, the fact that their Linowan appearance was but a ruse - Davron knows from Willow's reaction that there are tales of grief ahead for him yet.

---

Once hints of Willow's tale become known, Ramar is the first to observe the truth of the matter, and easily. The men now garbed as the Linowan, allies of the Realm long known-of, are in fact from the Hundred Kingdoms region, and other local states in the Scavenger Lands. They are the armsmen of those lands, the soldiers and mercenaries of the dictatorships and democracies, anarches and autocratic states. A few of the lands whose kinsmen Ramar can identify are known to be members in the Confederation of Rivers. It seems that greed, fear, or a fusion of the two can sway even an independent nation to throw their support behind the Juggernaut of the Realm.

And on the eve before the Solars' departure, Davron discovers that Willow is not in her room at the inn. He searches quickly and worriedly, and finds her standing on the roof, her hair blowing in the cold and cruel wind as she stands facing away on the edge. As she turns, the archer can see that her eyes are glowing vermillion. "I am Nomolous," her sweet and innocent voice says, "and I have claimed this girl for my own. Your role in my defeat has not been forgotten, nor will it be forgiven."

Davron's joy turns to ashes in his mouth in an instant. He stands in stunned shock and dismay, as if mesmerised himself by the glowing red eyes. Then he springs forward, calling out his friends' names in anguish. "Rumika! Chi-Yosh! Ramar! Gallius! Help me!" He cannot imagine how they can help him, when he has no clue himself what has happened; all he has is the faint hope that Nomolous' victory over his cousin is not total, that he will - somehow - be able to save her a second time.

For a moment, Willow's eyes become cloudy, and resume their former hue. "Davron! Help me!" she cries out, then her features twist. Again the red coal glow shines from them, and the young voice continues, unsettlingly changed in some fashion. "To destroy me, you must destroy that which you love, warrior." And Willow steps forward, haltingly, arms outstretched, fingers outstretched like talons.

Davron reaches for his bow, and shaking fingers pull an arrow from the quiver. He nocks the arrow, draws the string back... and hesitates. Tears run down his face, as the girl takes one step forward... then another. And then... his hand steadies. "I'm sorry, Willow..." he moans. "I've failed you at last..." And he releases the arrow.

In that moment a bursting cloud of black shrieks from the wound in Willow's body, engulfing the stars and the rooftop, plunging Davron into a deep obsidian void. He feels no brightness, no color, no life at all. Time, it seems, has stopped for him completely.

The first glow he sees is the brightest, and the purest. It cannot be directly seen, only felt, for it is the radiant star of his own Caste Mark, the sign of his Exaltation and the true evidence of Heaven's mandate. He looks outward through the deep black, seeing other shimmering signs as well - the Caste Marks of other men, other Exalts, other sorcerers, stretching out in a chain through the seven millennia. He can feel their words of encouragement, and their welcome - _all will be made light_. And then nothing can be seen, for the world is suddenly illuminated. Every dark corner, every hidden secret, every fragment of the most occult lore, can be seen, and Davron can feel the truth of it all down to his very bones.

Flashes of his victory spring now to his memory - his humiliating failures during his magic research, his encounter with Rumika and its strange aspects, the barren journey through the void of his soul as he searched for Willow's salvation, the black fear of Willow's seeming possession, the final sacrifice he made in the end. And knowledge, too, comes to his mind. Davron wakes, shouting with joy from the rapturous sensation of unity. He's drenched with sweat, but alive and unharmed, in his bed. And as he regains himself, he sees an armored male figure sitting on the side of the bed. One of this man's four arms is outstretched, offering a cup of water. "It took a bit of doing, but you managed it. The true power of Essence comes from will, and leads to hard choices. The legacy of that power is truly yours now."

Davron takes the glass, nearly spilling half of it as he drinks it down gratefully. Such a traumatic, yet cathartic experience... and though he knows in his heart that he will face such terrible trials again in the future, he is steadied by the knowledge that he has done it once, and that he can do it again. In fact... he speaks the question aloud. "Is that why? So that I know that I _can_ act, when the need arises?"

"So that you will know what it's like to act when no path seems right," answers Helios, smiling grimly. "You wouldn't have that --" and with a finger he gestures at the spot where Davron's Caste Mark would be "-- if you didn't know you could act. Sorcery is different. Nothing can stop you, ultimately. That's what you have to prepare yourself to cope with."

"'The power of sorcery is limitless,'" says Davron, as if reciting a maxim, then chuckles weakly. "Such a deceptively simple word, that." He shakes his head. "And it still seems hard to believe..." And so much yet that he has to digest...

The god's hand clasps his shoulder gently, and he rises from the bed. "You'll get there. Until then, your cousin is waiting for you."

Davron nods. "Thank you, sir." He bows deeply to his god and patron, then rushes out of his room. Willow is somewhat puzzled by Davron's unusually effusive greeting, as indeed are most of his companions. Only Rumika seems to have an inkling of his night's ordeal, raising a questioning eyebrow at him, which Davron answers with a sheepish grin. The full tale can wait - but of all his companions, he knows with utter certainly that she will understand it.
