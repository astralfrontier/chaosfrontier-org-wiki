Ordinary inns, tea-houses, restaurants, and other places of common unity often have plants of some kind. A decorative touch of nature, especially if it is one of the exotic species of fauna from the thickly-wooded East, adds distinction and an organic aesthetic. For his part, Chi-Yosh understands the merits of living among living things intuitively. Yet his experiences in the civilized River Province have never included a tree, perhaps two yards in height, rising from the floor-tiles as though it grew directly from them. It's slightly dewy, and rustles faintly as the door opens and closes. From its branches hang luscious fruit of deep azure shade.

Chi-Yosh clears through the door, avoiding a serving woman as he weaves amid the furniture in surprise and curiousity. Crouching down to inspect the floor, to see if it had been constructed around the great thing or else it had somehow grown up through the floor. After which he gives the fruit a consideration, not recalling this paticular color outside the city at all.

"Ahh, you're a stranger here?" asks a voice. Its owner is robed in the scarlet and white of the Immaculate Order's lay brethren, a novitiate and journeyman who travels the Threshold and outer rings of the Blessed Isle. "I'll tell you about that tree, in exchange for a meal."

Chi-Yosh looks up from his inspection to wince. Having delt with the Immaculate Order only briefly had further added to his hesitation towards them them, but after the initial trepidation, the warrior raises to his feet. Offering a bow, "Greetings sir. I accept your fair offer." A tilt of his head towards a free table, letting the man lead before settling in.

The lay brother immediately begins ordering, and plate after plate is delivered to the table. He digs in, hungrily, and for the space of three minutes the only sound he makes is that of chewing and swallowing. "Well," he says around a final mouthful, and pauses to pull back a long swig from a wine-flask. He lets out a contented sigh, and begins speaking. "Welll... it seems that Alcis Katsura, the garrison commander here, had a few shadowy friends. By all reports enemies of the Deathlords, and perhaps it was they who drove off the Anathema reported here recently." The man takes another long draught of wine. "But one of them struck a bargain with a god. Halvah, the Life-Tree. Its spores have been spreading slowly through the city. The seeds will grow anywhere - can you imagine? Anywhere. Halvah is obedient to the will of the City Father, too, and the monks have had no trouble at all."

Watching the man devour reminds Chi-Yosh of why he does not give into excess. But in his tablemate's defense, perhaps the man does not get a chance to dine so well. Brows raise. "Driven off the Anathema you say..." Lips resist turning wry; what interesting stories start to circulate. "And how much have they grown so far? Just a few remote miracles, or more? I have not had a chance to walk the city." A glance towards the tree itself and its fruity gifts. "What are the wonders for?"

"Mphgbn thwmb prrart," replies the lay brother, then swallows. "They heal too, good for curing almost anything in time. The trees are sprouting up here and there, as people plant seeds. Only reason they don't get more prevalent is because of Halvah's edict, which is that no violence can be offered in one of his temples - which includes wherever the trees are. Obviously a big problem."

"Especially depending on what he calls violence. Like tredding on grass or trimming hedges." Chi-Yosh considers the possibility of taking some of the fruit home with him. It may not work without the God's blessing, but the trees themselves may be of use to Gallius, if nothing than physical proof for her prayers, and the fruit for himself. "Do you think they could grow anywhere, outside of Greyfalls?"

The priest shrugs helplessly and goes for another handful of chicken. "Who's to say?" he asks. "Perhaps you should talk to the Immaculate monks still here in the city. They have had dealings with Halvah. But I suppose the quickest way to find out is to simply plant some and see. They sprout within a few days."

Chi-Yosh nods in consideration, feeling the hearthstone's weight in his pocket. "It is worth the thought." With that, the Dawn collects his cup, and takes a sip. More than likely, it would be better for him to question the City Father, for honesty with his origins and the question for Gallius can be posed.

While Greyfalls the City Father would be the best to speak to, for he knew Gallius and could tell Havlah of her Circlemate's question, the spirit cannot be reached. The Monks offer assistance, giving the helpful warning: "Plant these blessings careful. Each seed is a prayer and homage to Havlah, and it would be an insult to throw them about or plant somewhare which is shoddy and ugly." Chi-Yosh packs a small crate with soil and fruit, to keep the contents safe in the trip.

Down the mighty Rock River a mile and a half, a natural inlet draws water which tumbles down a sheer ravine into a waterfall. Its' destination is through the funnel-shaped roof made of faceted crystal. The water splashes down into a pool too deep for the bottom to be seen among the clear water. And inside Chi-Yosh dives. At the bottom is a natural bowl, the slot wherein his stone would fit. Expelling breath, he sinks like a stone, sitting crosslegged at the bottom, and letting the Essence flow into him, and then outwards, feeling every inch of the Manse become him.
