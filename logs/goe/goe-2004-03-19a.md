# Gods of Eden 2004-03-19a

The streets of Nexus are athrong with people, as always, at almost any time of day or night. The press of the crowd, the stench of unwashed and vibrantly alive humanity is at times intolerable. Here and there, perfumes and scents from a thousand ports of call steal into the air to calm the angry odors that obscenely assault the senses. Food-stalls, restaurants, and tea-houses can be found at street level, or on the second story, their luridly-painted signs advertising the delights to be found within, and the aromas drifting from their windows and doors caress the nostrils of passers-by like the hand of a beautiful woman cradling one's cheek.

Within the cracks and crannies of the burgeoning behemoth of commerce that is the city of Nexus, more rarefied forms of exchange take place. Only three blocks north from where the Tomb of Ice lays underground, underneath the rude criss-crossed rope bridges that connect three extraordinarily high glass towers of First Age architecture, a merchant can be found. His shop is not ordinarily open to the public, and yet the arcane sigils that lie unobtrusively in the area draw the eye of almost every member of the Solars who walk the street.

A spiral staircase leads one up through a cylindrical tower of grey stone, past several doorways, and to a trapdoor. Three stout knocks will gain admittance, report the occult markings that lurk in the shadows of the staircase, and three raps on the trapdoor are answered moments later. The merchant himself, a tall and weather-beaten fellow with flax hair and cat-like eyes, introduces himself as Pai Tao and welcomes the four cordially. "Good day to you, sirs, madam. Come up, come up.."

Davron smiles warmly. "And to you, sir," says he, climbing up and offering a hand to his companions. As he surveys his surroundings, he reflects that, in time, he shall have to learn to _make_ himself comfortable in dealing with strangers in a strange land. But for now... a slight incline of his head to Ramar, and a bashful smile, suggests that he would like the Eclipse to open the conversation on his behalf.

"And a good day to you as well Pai Tao." Ramar smiles easily, and watches Davron give him the nod. He wastes no time in making the introductions, a smile coming to his face rather easily. "I hope the day has found you well, and that we are not interrupting anything terribly important. You have a nice shop you know, and we are hoping to perhaps do some business with you today, if such a thing can be done."

The man only smiles. "Please, make yourselves comfortable," he says, gesturing to a series of low divans. "I am a Scavenger Lord, Westerner. I am unlike other merchants; I cannot predict the fruit that will grow on my trees. Perhaps you can tell me what you seek, in general terms?"

Chi-Yosh does not understand the markings. Yet they give him impressions, as though this one is a mark of Essence's flow, and that one... like he had seen them all when first waking, the Easterner regards all the splendor with new eyes, but he feels older, not the naive magical savage but the soldier's first sight of an army.

Ramar bows, "I had not realized you were a Scavenger Lord," he raises his eyes, then turns towards the divans and takes a seat. The Solar smiles and gestures towards Davron, "I believe that's your department," he says, "If you don't mind doing so."

Davron speaks up. "Of course. What I seek..." he says, then hesitates, as he assembles his thoughts. "The gods have seen fit to grant me the talent of craftsmanship, of bringing forth new works, weaving mundane and mystical into new wholes. But... what I can make, so far, is limited to mere copies of the lesser artifacts that the great men of the First Age brought into being." He pauses again. "Just as there are hammers and lathes and looms to aid the work of the hands, surely there were tools of Essence, implements that shape the mystical forces of which wonders were made. It is such tools that I seek."

Pai Tao considers for long moments. "Such a thing I do not have," he concludes at last. "However, I once dealt with an old Exalt, who must now be near the end of her span. She was an artist, and rendered beautiful glowing rings and jewels for her close friends and companions. It was said that she knew secrets of crafting that no mere sorceress commanded, and that her prowess was made manifest only after a visit to the south. Yes.. Yes, I believe I have something here, that may be of interest..."

The flaxen-haired Scavenger Lord moves to a cabinet of books, sealed with a grate and lock. From his robes he withdraws a key and opens it, returning with a book. He lays it out on his lap as he sits, holding it up for inspection. Within, the silvery lines and characters of the Old Realm's script shimmer like precious metal catching the light of the setting sun. "This is a rare copy of the book she was said to have followed, and I can give you her name as well." He draws out a scrap of paper and in twelve deft brush-strokes has scribed a name, which he slips between the pages of the book as he closes it. "Does this satisfy your needs?"

Davron's eyes widen, and a light burns in them - the desire for knowledge, never far from his heart. "Aye, it does indeed, Pai Tao," he answers. "This is knowledge of great value." He tilts his head, lifting his gaze from the tome to the Scavenger Lord's eyes, and raises an eyebrow, suspecting that his next question need not even be asked - only answered. For if there's one thing Davron has learned in the past few weeks, it's that nothing comes without a price - and nowhere is this more true than in Nexus.

The man sets the book aside, next to him, and spreads his hands out wide. "And now that I have made an offer which serves your interests, perhaps you will do the same?" he asks, smiling.

Chi-Yosh's eyes are critical from the divan. While he does not know the complexities and subtle currents of merchants and politicians, the Dawn can tell the measure of someone. And peering at Pai Tao, he can tell the man wants something. The offer is honest, but likely special, in need of something to make his eyes grow wide. The Solar glances to his mates, to catch their attention, and raise the silent question.

Davron lapses into thought as the Scavenger Lord makes his request. His eyes rove around the room... falling frequently on the locked book cabinet, as this is the greatest treasure in the room to his eyes. By degrees, it occurs to the Solar scholar that the merchant before him must be of the same opinion. Finally he speaks, carefully. "You have an impressive library, Pai Tao. Tell me, what books have you on the theory of Demesnes, and the construction of Manses thereon?"

The merchant looks a little distraught for a moment. "Well, err, I have a few tomes graciously donated by a Dragon-Blooded patron," he says, gesturing to the cabinet. "You may look for yourself, if you wish.."

Rumika stays oddly quiet during this entire transaction. After all, there is little she can buy that will help her achieve her goals. Nexus has many things, but the beauty she seeks is not to be found here. Still, she will show some interest when the books are offered for Davron's inspection.

Davron nods, and walks over to the cabinet, keeping a respectful distance as he peruses the titles of the books, looking for a familiar title - or rather, looking for its absence, which is soon enough verified. Satisfied, he turns back to Pai Tao. "Perhaps we may be able to offer you something after all, sir. In our travels we have found a copy of a tome known as the _River of Heaven_. Have you heard of it?"

"I have," the scavenger says. "Is that your offer to me?" He still looks somewhat disappointed, but that is quickly fading at the promise of a rare book of immense value.

Rumika tilts her head as if listening to something. Hmm. "Interesting," she murmurs. She moves over towards the locked books and gestures at the glass, pointing at an unlabeled book, "And where did you acquire this one, sir?" she asks casually.

Pai Tao is distracted from his mixed feelings, and rises, peering at the book for long moments and scouring his memory. "Those are the notes of sorcerers long past, that were collected by a colleague and given to me. I have not reviewed them extensively."

"Would you be offended if I took a look at the book?" asks Rumika. "I sense something very interesting about it, and would like to learn more. Perhaps I might be able to offer you something of a favor in return, if it catches my eye."

Pai nods, unlocking the case once again. He slides the book off its shelf and presents it to Rumika, slipping a hand inside his pocket as he does. The hand stays where it is - perhaps it holds a device of some kind, meant to deter would-be robbers and thieves.

Rumika looks at the book carefully, but doesn't open it at first. With care she finally draws the cover back and studies the pages inside. She is no thief (at the moment, anyway) and so she does not worry over the device.

Davron thinks quietly, as Rumika and the Scavenger Lord converse. Pai Tao's response to his suggestion was clear enough... interested, but there's something else he wants more. Then Davron chuckles softly to himself. "Of course," he whispers quietly. Then, out loud: "Ah... Pai Tao? You spoke of the fruit from your trees. But what you have offered me is not so much a fruit as a seed, from which fruit may grow in turn. What say you to a share in the harvest?"

The man smiles broadly, and his cat-like eyes twinkle. "Now we're talking," he says. "And of course, should it transpire that you do have a copy of the _River of Heaven_ as you say, I might part with the book your friend has there.." He nods in the direction of Rumika, who is studying an unmarked book with interest.

"We can provide you with such a copy, yes," replies Ramar, as he looks towards Rumika. He cannot help but raise an eyebrow at the unmarked book, "Is it an interesting read?"

Its pages are mismatched; the binding is less than professional quality. Rumika thumbs through the book, and finds several pages set apart from the others - pages distinguished not only by their larger relative size, but also by the fineness of their make. It's like touching velvet when she runs her hands over them, and there's a warm sensation somewhat akin to that of baby's skin. There's no suggestion of necromancy, though; it's a comfortable and soothing warmth. The formulae, canticles, precepts and predicates are strangely familiar to her, but highly advanced sorcery indeed.

"They have this book, Pai Tao, but I do not," says Rumika. "But perhaps there are some who languish in illness that you would like to live instead?" she suggests. "For my gifts are not quite the same as others, but against my skill even the Great Contagion cannot stand."

The merchant shakes his head slowly. "I and my family have no need of doctors, but perhaps you can find someone who can pay a fair price here in the city, and bargain with them."

"Ahh well, many things of my desire are not meant to be," says Rumika. She offers the book back to Pai Tao. "Perhaps if you have not sold it I shall return later to take it off your hands."

Davron looks over at Rumika, and grins bashfully. "Nay, Rumika," he says shyly. "Consider it as a... a gift from a friend." Turning back to Pai Tao, and trying not to blush too obviously, he says, "Two deals, then, sir. The _River of Heaven_ for the book that has caught Rumika's eye. And for the other book that you offer..."

After some discussion between the Solar architect and the Scavenger Lord, a deal is finally reached: in exchange for the book and the name of the Exalted sorceress, Davron will construct a series of minor wonders according to the periodic requests of Pai Tao's customers.

"We have an arrangement," intones the seller of wonders, smiling. "Now, if you please..." From a pocket he extracts a small golden gemstone, cut like a ruby but glowing with the inner fire of the sun. "Place this in your mouth and speak your agreement. I will then do the same," he directs.

Rumika looks at Davron for a moment, starting to object, but then falls silent, looking down at the book. Her lips purse and she assents. "I hope this book is worth it."

Davron hesitates for but a moment, then does as Pai Tao requests, feeling the tingle of Essence from the magical gem as he speaks. Removing the artifact from his mouth, he passes the gem back, nodding to the merchant.

"I swear I shall deal honorably with my customer," intones the Scavenger Lord, his words slurred only slightly by the gem. "I will honor his efforts and maintain discretion." He withdraws the gem and pockets it, smiling. "I will await your return to my place of business soon, my friends," he says.

On the street is the oddest of contraptions, for in the midst of the road is a small vessel, like a boat, but it is not resting on the ground, but above it. Rumika sighs and moves towards it, pausing at its side and turning to face the circle. "Well, my friends, I fear it is now time for us to part ways."

Davron looks at the boat, and then at Rumika. He knew this day would come, but it doesn't make it any easier. "You're leaving, then?" he says, trying to sound calm about it, and almost succeeding.

Rumika nods, "It was.. interesting coming out again. Every once in a while I guess I'll have to do it." She looks down at her hand and notices the gold ring. She sighs and reaches to pull it off, but fumbles a little more than she really should before she succeeds. "This is yours, and you have the right and the power to use it," she explains, offering it to Davron.

Davron takes the ring quietly. "Thank you, Rumika," he says softly. He pauses, looking into her eyes; his expression wavers as testimony to the many unspoken questions that compete for his vocal chords, until he settles on, "When will I see you again?"

"When you come for me," answers Rumika. "And the next time you give me a ring, Davron, I promise never to give it back." She smiles sadly, "What you have given me is a beginning, Davron. This book is beyond any of my abilities. It's beyond anything I ever imagined. I have to unlock its secrets. I will count every minute until you come to see me."

Davron blushes brightly, but smiles, even though his eyes glitter with tears. Blinking them back, he nods. "So will I," he whispers. A brief pause, and then he steps forward to put his arms around her. "Fare well, Rumika!" he says, with feeling. "Until we meet again..."

Rumika smiles and embraces Davron. She shows a little bit more fire this time, and shares a kiss with him. Drawing away, she says, "We will meet again. But now it is time for us to part. I suggest you depart as quietly as you may.. I hope to draw them after me, rather than you. But go, and go quickly!" And with that, she steps upon the small ship and with a last bow, rushes off into the sky.

Davron looks up into the sky, watching until the vessel becomes a speck in the distance. At length, he sighs deeply and turns to his friends. "I don't know who 'they' are, but there are many things in this world that we are not yet ready to face. Let us not wait to find out which ones they are." And with that he strides, with quickened pace, leading the way back... pausing only to wipe an errant tear from his eye.

Somewhere, in a hemispherical tunnel that is poorly-lit and foul-smelling, a crowd of motionless, soundless human figures mill about. They begin shuffling, making not a sound even to breathe. Their eyes glow a lambent red with purpose, filling the tunnel with an eerie and unnatural halo as they draw together in a circle. Ritually, each slides a hand into pockets or inner linings; mechanically, each hand withdraws bearing a wickedly barbed dagger marked with a strange rune. Methodically, three slashes are made across each left wrist. Black blood pours in viscous streams onto the damp and littered ground, and begins to creep toward a center point. The agglutination of malodorous blood begins taking a shape. The human figures waver, weakened by the loss of their vital principle; some collapse, soundlessly, while others wobble weakly on their knees.

One by one the figures fall, brought low by the loss of their unnatural blood. And in the center, a dark and forbidding shape rises. Eyeslit after eyeslit appears on a body black as night. They glow red, the fire of a sun fading beneath the horizon and defeated by darkness. **I live.. again...** hisses a sibilant voice.
