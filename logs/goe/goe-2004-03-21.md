# Gods of Eden 2004-03-21

Overlooking the magnificent waterfall that the country takes its' namesake from sits a villa. Ivly crawls up the marble and plaster, while the fence itself is a living hedge which is said to bury intruders itself. The garrison around the villa is tough. Several heavily armored guards spread out, with archers on the roof itself as well as in neighboring trees. Gallius herself had placed the soldiers there to keep watch of the former Autocrat's Champion until further notice. A flurry takes up the guards as one of the Sun Gods approaches the villa, the mark of the Sun bright on his forehead.

The other of the so-called Sun Gods approaches, although he has yet to reveal himself as such. Ramar simply tags along with the other, looking about carefully as the guards begin to make way for the approaching Solars. "What exactly do we hope to gain from this conversation? Refresh my memory..."

"A potential ally," Answers Chi-Yosh as the guards bustle about, coming to attention. One or two offer some prayer as the Exalts walk past the gate and towards the front door. Hustling forward is a pikesman, saluting while raising his visor. "The Dragon-Blooded remains within, sir." "Good job. If all goes well, you can leave your posts for a new assignment. But do not leave until we have; the scent of trouble is not strong, but always present." The guard nods and steps aside as the two Solars mount the veranda, and push past into Villa's foyer.

Crystal quartz and marble decorate the interior; iron bands add the severity of monochrome, offsetting the shimmer of bead-work and glass that adorn the walls. The villa is a new construction, evident even to Chi-Yosh's unpracticed eye. Within, the Dragon-Blooded captive reclines boredly on a throne of stone. "Welcome, Anathema," she says with a surly tone of voice.

Chi-Yosh's marveling at the interior of the abode is quick. As soon as his eyes settle onto the Chosen of Earth, a bow is presented, his demeanor one of respect for another warrior. "You have been kept here until we could tell if you had committed offenses against the kingdom to cause execution or exile. You are innocent of any charge, and have been respectable since your arrival. You are free to go." The way he says the last, as well as his look upon Low Mountain, he has left a "but" hanging in the air.

The woman rises, and begins stepping lightly and methodically, a footfall puncturing every few syllables of speech. "In that case, demon," she says with a thin smile, "I will take my leave. Give my regards to your queen."

It is then that Ramar gives a questioning glance to Chi-Yosh. He gives a shrug of his shoulders, then turns to watch the Low Mountain leave, curious eyes falling on her, reading her moves as she makes her way towards the exit. _What in the world is Chi-Yosh doing?_

Chi-Yosh simply smiles to Ramar's gaze, and offers a nod to the Dragon Exalt. "May you be prosperous where your travels take you. I hope we do not cross weapons again, but I would be honored to none the less." After a moment, as she draws close to the door, "Greyfalls is lacking in Dragon Blooded after the war. You would find a worthy place, for they are still rebuilding their garrison."

The woman stops, and sneers. "They have no garrison," she remarks coldly. "They have fools. I will return to my home. This land is nothing to me now."

Chi-Yosh can simply shrug helplessly. "As you see fit." He considers the woman, and for a moment, is hesitant. While he knows it is likely feeble, a part of him wants her respect. The hatred of the Dynast Terrestrials can be overcome in time, but he must wonder if it can be done on the individual level. Thus, he takes a chance. "Hit me."

"What?" The scornful look is replaced by curiosity. "You think to challenge me now? Don't mock me."

A shake of Chi-Yosh's head. "No. I know that you despise me. And you are angry for being deposed from this land, because the evil tide of the Anathema has swept over it. So hit me, just once. No defense, no guard, no infernal gifts, nor insult to you as a warrior. Just an offer to take your frustration in one punch. An offer of faith." He squares his shoulders, takes a solid stance, and crosses his arms behind his back in an almost military stance.

"No insult to me as a warrior?" the woman spits. "A warrior does not strike a defenseless victim to assuage his anger. That is the spirit of a barbarian." She turns and stalks off, passing through the doors out front. The faint sound of commotion can be heard.

Chi-Yosh can once more merely shrug his shoulders. In baring himself as defenseless he hoped to expose his weakness for understanding. But it was instead taken as insult. He should likely think these impulsive things through. The two turn and walk out, releaving the guards from their posts.

Hidden at the base of a mountain beneath a fallen tree is the volo. Chi-Yosh had hidden it well, after Ramar had been kind enough to fly him out to the forests not far from Goran's land. After hiding the contraption and taking the hearthstone with him, the Dawn trudges up the mountain along the tracks his Circle had passed many months ago. He climbs, and comes to a familiar place, one of power, the den of a spirit. Here he kneels, and waits for the return of Patient Mantis.

The spirit is not long in making itself known, via that directionless voice. "Student. You have returned." The stillness and patience hanging in the air deepen perceptibly.

"Yes, teacher," replies the Dawn in calmness. "I have learned on my own since I left your home, but I return to further my understanding."

"Begin to understand, then," says the voice, and from nowhere a green shadow appears, flickering into existence. It's humanoid in shape, and lunges quickly at the penitent Solar.

Chi-Yosh comes to his feet, watching the shadow approach while all ready seeing its' reaction. He moves when he has to, a sideways step with a grappling counter-attack aimed for the general direction of the shoulder.

The spirit flickers away, sending a swift strike toward the legs. And the contest ensues. Hand and foot, leg and arm, snap out, or swiftly twist to the side. Bodies, too, move in the rapid dance of the Mantis, making lightning-fast motions that are economy incarnate. One hundred heartbeats pass.

The figure draws back, still no more than a half-glimpsed illusion. "You have not wasted your time, student. What is it you wish of me?"

"In the battle of Greyfalls, I faced an Immaculate who I could only defeat by a stalemate. I was hard pressed to disarm him, and I could not capture him in my grasp," Chi-Yosh admits. "I wish to learn the ways of defanging the spider so it cannot attack, and clipping the wings of the moth, so they cannot escape."

The figure inclines its... head. "Then we begin."

The Unconquered Sun opens and closes his eyes many times over the practicing Solar and Spirit, for while the underlying principle is a temperant discipline of time, that time is still put to good use. One of the first powers of the Art is to parry a blade with the body itself, by seeing, then deflecting the strike with a solid opposition and flexible rebuff. The next lesson is not to simply fend it off, but strike at the weakness in each tool, the gripping hand, the heavy head. To see the strike, and turn it so to send it elsewhere.

The second lesson feeds off the first. But rather then going after mere tools, the point is to get in close, to ignore those tools. A man with a sword cannot attack one pressed against him, and each limb offers itself a handhold for the grasping claw, when the proper time to strike is presented. Emerald shadows are everywhere and no where, but even their flighty nature is soon restrained by the iron grip of the Dawn's arms, because they have no evasion from his mind.

Even after the grip has been toughened and treated, still the Solar practices. While good, there are gaps and harsh edges, ones that with honing are filled in and rounded off, until the spirit draws away, pleased. Chi-Yosh desires to test his new gifts, to use them, but the knowing instructor chids otherwise. The time to use them will come, no need to go and look for their purpose. No need to hunt when there is no hunger. And thus, Chi-Yosh, after the weeks of understanding, departs from his sensai once more with the promise to return.

Chi-Yosh knows Ramar is coming. He had payed a messanger to alert him when the Eclipse started down the adjacent hall towards his room. The Dawn stands just inside Ramar's room, still as a wall, gripped in his hand a bucket of water. Patience.

And so it comes to pass that Ramar walks down the hallway to his room. The door opens, and the Solar steps through into the safety of his own room.

Chi-Yosh waits until Ramar has walked passed him. And as soon as the Dawn can spy the back of his Circlemate's head, the bucket snaps upwards to introduce Ramar to its' contents.

Ramar's reflexes, trained such as they are pick up on the water as it rushes towards his head. Using the latent Essence in the room as a guide, Ramar pushes off of the floor, leaping towards the wall just behind him. A second flex of the legs pushes him off and has him spinning around towards the liquid's source. "Wha?"

Chi-Yosh tosses the bucket up to Ramar as the Dawn dives beneath his Circlemate. A roll leaves him standing up, laughing. "Good. Good. But that can only get you so far."

Ramar catches the bucket with a casual ease, and lands on the ground, facing the Dawn as he stands up. He laughs, "Yes yes I suppose you're right..." Ramar then tilts his head, curiously, "So I imagine then you're going to teach me things that will get me even further than that, yes? At least I hope you would... I would like to learn."

"Yes. After seeing you struck down by Nomolous, I thought it would be wise for you to evade all attacks towards you." Chi-Yosh gestures. "What you had done was feel the essence move around you, and where to go. You must learn how to expand yourself, and move without thinking constantly. What I had done caused ripples, and you had felt, and moved away; it will take attuning yourself to the world, and avoid those ripples even while your mind is elsewhere."

Ramar laughs, "Ahhh yes... well I was trying to avoid remembering that just now... but you are right. I do need to learn that. Move without thinking constantly... hmmm." Ramar has a curious expression, "Interesting. Yes, I think perhaps that learning this would be helpful."

Chi-Yosh smiles innocently enough. "It should not be hard. You have mastered the art of talking without thinking." Clapping Ramar on the back, he leads the way outside.

Ramar grins, "Yes and I can see that you're well on your way to mastering that path my friend." The Solar chuckles, then turns towards the exit, following alongside Chi-Yosh.

Chi-Yosh offers the witty reparte of sticking his tongue out. "I was thinking, I merely was thinking wrong." Leading Ramar away, to a barn. Up into the loft they climb. "Now sit." Walking around behind him, Chi-Yosh waits, then mock-attacks the back of Ramar's head, pulling up short. "Do you feel the Essence calling you, like it did before? Now focus on it, and try to feel each strike come." And like so, the warrior attacks the air inches from Ramar's head.

"I see..." Ramar concentrates, rather than on dodging each attack, on feeling the attacks. On sensing their motions on predicting where they will be and how to dodge them. He focuses on each one, noting how it begins to blend into another, making a dance, some kind of pattern perhaps. At last when Chi-Yosh attacks in earnest, the Solar manages to dodge both of them. "I think I begin to understand."

"Beginning is good." Chi-Yosh works with Ramar, continuing this exercise for some hours until the Eclipse has mastered simply seperating, then letting each one run together. The next day proves to be more interesting. Archers stand around Ramar, some poised on the wall, others in various random directions. Upon instruction, each is armed with arrows tipped not with steel, but with cork. Chi-Yosh stands to the side. "Ramar, for now, simply focus on them all." To the rest, "Do not all fire at once. On the count of three, begin your assault. One. Two. Three."

"Ow!" Ramar winces as one of the cork arrows bounces off of his head. He'd managed to dodge the first few, though it's clear the Solar still has a ways to go. He's coming to a better understanding of how he uses Essence... instead of simply relying on his reflexes he's becoming more aware... "Alright try once more," he says, as he prepares.

Letting the archers gather their arrows then return to their places, a chuckling Chi-Yosh issues, "One. Two. Three." And so the day goes, Ramar starting to get the hang of more attacks, for every archer he spies shooting at him is three others behind him, but the process becomes better. The third day proves to be more interesting, as Ramar is brought onto the field blindfolded. Stretched out before him are a gauntlet of guards with false weapons, and at the very end, all will simply circle the man and swing. "I want you to simply Run forward when I say go. And while you are at it, recite a story or sing a song. If you stop, we will start all over again." After several moments, "Go!"

"Alright..." Ramar has a wry grin on his face. He pauses a moment, catching his breath. As the blindfold cuts off his sight, he allows his other senses to take command. He can hear the sound of the men breathing, can feel the wind as it distorts around them. It goes without saying he can smell them. With one more breath his body is lighter, and so as he runs towards the gauntlet of men with sticks he begins singing a tale of derring-do and vaults up on top of the onrush of air brought about by the first swing. Deftly he runs across the tips of the sticks and the heads of the guards until he reaches the other side. He turns towards the sound of Chi-Yosh's breath, and smirks. "Done."

Chi-Yosh can only laugh. "Tricky. But you're learning!" On the fourth day, the final time, the Su'Katan stands with his kamas in hand. In the dirt before Ramar is his own weapon. Around them are the guards, armed with their false arrows and weapons. "They have specific instruction to attack you from the sides and from behind. Your job is to not get hit. But do not focus on their attacks, focus on mine. You must parry - and not evade - my own. On the count of three, we begin. One. Two. Three." And at that, the warrior is charging towards Ramar, throwing the first of many sweeps and stabs in a cascade of curved blades.

"Of course." Ramar shakes his head. "Why do I..." He has little time to finish the thought as he kicks his blade up to intercept the first blow, then spins it around to parry two more before finally snatching his sword in his hand. He's hard pressed to keep parrying every attack... and as he does he evades a few arrows, though every now and again one bounces off of his torso, or his head. "This is... alot harder... than it looks..."

"it is," Assures Chi-yosh, as he backs up, and for a moment there is a pause. "But it will save your life some day." And with that, he pounces towards the Eclipse, to begin once more, as the guards rush toward Ramar's back while archers twang their bows.

As the guards rush towards Ramar, he vaults up and over them, twisting in mid-air out of the way of their strikes. As he lands his movement carries him backwards, sending dirt flying into the air as Chi-Yosh's kamas cascade the air in front of him. _It's all so clear now. I can see it. I can feel it..._ And Ramar flows around the attacks... "I did it..."
