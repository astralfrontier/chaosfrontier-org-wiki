# Gods of Eden 2004-03-22

Without much explanation of hows or whys beforehand, Gallius will seek Ramar to aid her as a pilot. She will never be her own airship pilot, that is certain. Leaving a message for her friends, she directs Ramar to fly her towards the gate that last took them to the Carnival. It seems like another life-time, somehow. On the way, Gally is working over a letter, fretting here and there at details.

They leave Bridal Veil early in the morning, and soar to the north at a fast clip. Jin-nu is along, just in case there is some trouble. In addition there are ten men of Bridal Veil, who look rather uncertain of themselves. All have been training with Gallius. She'll turn them into elite troops yet, but for now her mind is utterly bent on her letter.

"So... we are headed where I think we're headed... right?" Ramar is just double-checking their destination. "Because you know, I think I've figured out a shortcut, I've been dying to give it a try since I've learned a little more... we catch one of the windstreams here... should be just like sailing the rapids..."

The airship dips into the rushing wind, and sure enough under Ramar's guidance they manage to catch the current. The ship tumbles and is tossed about as they take Ramar's shortcut. It is a little faster, if bumpier, and soon they will arrive and head for solid ground. Ramar is grinning as they land, "Now THAT was fun!"

It takes the better part of the day, and by dusk the vessel has landed. The Master, and his own ship, are waiting for them. He flips out his pocket-watch, stares at it for a few seconds, then snaps it shut and drops it back into a pocket of his robe. "You're early," he announces, gruffly.

Gallius stretches her back and leaps off the ship. She smiles at the Master, "So are you," she says. "Because of the shortcut we took I didn't get to revise my letter." She studies the Master for a time and considers him in silence before offering the letter. "I fear it's far from polished. I have more skill in the spoken word, still. I have much need of your aid and advice."

The sage reads it over carefully, then turns on his heel, beckoning with a curt wave of his hand. He strides into the thin woodlands, crossing over a hill and descending into the far valley as the Sun finally vanishes on the edge of the world. There, amid crumbled ruins, is the gate, and the Master begins to work the shaping of Essence around it. The gate blossoms into vivid life, and the party steps through. Again, the celestial gates come into view, and the Sidereal intones the ritual greeting. The lions give the ritual response. And the gates of the starry night part, leading into the magnificent splendor that is the City of Heaven.

Gallius moves swiftly to keep up with the Master. She cradles the instrument in her arms and looks around. "I would like to handle my obligation quickly, and then seek to find another spirit in need of some aid. The kingdom below cannot last if the kingdom above does not function with it."

"I agree. Although I think the more that Creation itself begins to function, the more the Celestial City begins to function. I could very well be mistaken," admits Ramar, with a somewhat sheepish smile, "It was just an observation I've made."

Chi-Yosh follows his Circle Mates, having been quiet for the trip. Fortunate for he the Dawn caught Gallius just before she and Ramar left. Since then, he has been considering what to say to Lytek. How to propose his request. What possibly could he offer the man in return? Though he allows distraction for a moment simply to marvel at the beauty that is Heaven and its' majesty.

The wondrous streets of Yu-Shan carry little in the way of distraction for Ramar. "I am afraid I have some pressing business with the Bureau of Travels. You are welcome to come along if you like, although it may take some time." Ramar will request an aerial rickshaw ride to the Bureau of Travels. Along the way he glances outside, watching the Celestial City pass by. _To travel a great distance, swiftly and safely... there is a way._ He watches, becoming acutely aware of the dance of Essence around him, of the ebbs and flows and whorls of life itself, in glorious abundance in Yu-Shan. His head is swimming as he approaches the great golden ship. _It is like sailing, almost, or exploring. It's just a matter of finding the right path, and then following it through and learning what you can from it until you have found what it is you sought to begin with. To ride out the whirlpools of petty bureaucrats is just as necessary as avoiding those of the seas..._

The Solar and his companions travel up the steps and into the Bureau. He's greeted rather courteously and he takes his time, explaining the purpose of his journey here, and what it is he hopes to gain from it. "Very well..." mutters the secretary, as papers appear out of nowhere. "Explain to me what it is you wish." Ramar does just that, carefully choosing the words that will fill the sails of his request, giving them enough strength to push it along it's course, but not so forceful as to sink it before it reaches its destination. "And so I seek the aid of a spirit gifted in the art of travel... or at least a way to find such a being," he continues, navigating delicately around the turbulent waters of his request, and then, it's as though the skies are parting when he comes to its conclusion. He smiles, and bows respectfully, _Now all that is left is to hope for the best._

A member of the hierarchy, a minor scribe, comes in due course. This flame-sheathed being with eyes of crimson shakes its head, clucking thoughtfully. "Solar," he crackles, "there is much that is hidden, or perhaps absent.. no sponsorship is mentioned, nor is any greater goal than err, what seems to be a personal project given." This being gives a low, respectful bow. "I must regretfully inform you that the Bureau must postpone a meeting with you on this matter."

"I understand." Ramar returns the low, respectful bow. "My apologies for wasting your time, and thank you for your courtesy." He smiles, then stands, and turns to leave. "Well that didn't go as I'd hoped, but such is the way of things." As he's outside he speaks, "I shall simply have to think of another way. Well I suppose that concludes my business here. Is there anything you needed to do?"

Chi-Yosh, as Ramar steps out, gives him a pat on the back in reassurance. "There will be better fortune later. But you have a way with words that I do not, and maybe you can help me at my task. I seek to understand more of Lytek; why and how he is in the position he is in. If I know these things, perhaps I will have a map in the right direction."

"Oh I'm not worried. I'm sure I shall find a way to accomplish what I must..." Ramar smiles, "And it will be a great day when I have done so. For now though, I believe I can do my best to help you with what task you have set for yourself." He quirks an eyebrow, "I shall ask these things... but why is it you wish to know?"

The Dawn is silent for a second, looking away. "I have not went to the City of Dreams to know more about the one who founded my village. But, I do know that during Calibration her spark was here in Heaven." Chi-Yosh glances back to Ramar. "When the next inheritant of her spark takes their second breath, I wish to be there and guide them into Golden hands, as we were. Then, perhaps I can learn about Lesell from buried memories."

Gallius will remain oddly quiet during this. The way of heaven is rather clear to her. Barter seems the heart of things. Offer something or get nothing. She will just wait to complete her task, and to speak with the master about the most important reason she called upon him.

"I see." Ramar nods, and once more an aerial rickshaw carries the group through Yu-Shan. After a little while, they arrive at the Bureau of Heaven, and Ramar will turn once more to Chi-Yosh. "I shall see what I can find out... I am not guaranteeing anything world-shaking though."

The Bureau of Heaven is a shadow of its former self; much of the power in the Celestial Hierarchy is focused on the Bureau of Destiny. As a result, the once-proud Bureau has become even more insular and secretive. Getting answers will be difficult.

Even though the Bureau is a mere shadow of what it once was, Ramar has found that often one can bring a much-needed glimpse of light to those dwelling in such shadows, with little more than the right phrase, or the subtle changes in tone that let a voice sooth and seek at the same time. Though the beings running the destiny may turn to one another for their secrets and their work, Ramar makes his attempt to slip into this tightly-knit group, wielding words as delicately as the point of a blade in search of chinks in an opponent's armor.

Here, more productive results can be found. Taru-Han, the Shogun of the Department of Abstract Matters, Lady of Souls, and the god of the act of dying, has long been a rival of Lytek, the Daimyo of the Division of Exaltation. Lytek once held the post Taru-Han does now, and there is no love lost between the two gods. It is said that an inordinate number of Sidereals have visited him in the past few years, and it is further whispered that most of them hail from the Convention of the East - the Scavenger Lands, where the Gold Faction is strongest.

Casually questioning among those gods and officials he can, Ramar pursues this line of inquiry. Not a few of the members of the Convention of the Deathlords have also paid a call on the Daimyo, and a flurry of prayers and astrological efforts always seem to follow such meetings. Though the Bureau of Heaven does not have formal ties to the Bureau of Destiny, their jealousy has forged many in-roads and bureaucratic 'spy-holes'. It seems that Lytek sees the returning Solars as the instrument of his re-ascension to power.

Naturally, the Master is one of those Sidereals who's visited Lytek in the past, as an envoy of the Bureau of Destiny on those occasions where it must consult an outside authority.

This business done, the Solars and the Master return to their aerial rickshaw and streak through the heavenly city, bound for the Cerulean Lute of Harmony - the Department of Serenity, inside the great Bureau of Destiny itself. Here the Master takes charge for a time, leading the others through corridors, over walkways made of flowing water and past sparkling star-bells of fairy-dust that tinkle and twinkle when one touches them lightly with a fingertip. Following the strains of music is no strain at all, and Gallius takes the lead as the group emerges into a large ampitheater.

Gallius looks around and for a time, just listens. Of all the marvels of Yu-Shan, it is music she loves most of all. She weaves her way through the ampitheater, looking for Jyamis. It occurs to her that she has the key right in her hands. She draws out the ophicleide of Jyamis and looks it over before guiding the reed to her lips and beginning to mingle its warm sound with the music that already ebbs and flows here.

The ampitheater is truelly a place of wonder for a Spirit of Music. The air is trimmed in hanging motes of starlight that glimmer in time with the melodies. The music itself flows, from different directions, and the power of their composition is behind them; each inflection is a sensation of the skin, from suaveness almost almost a lover's touch, while the dropping notes a twang of chill sadness upon the heartstrings.

Sound and music swirl in the evening air. At first the air seems to vibrate with the impact of a note; then it is suffused with color, as complexity and passion pour into the music. From out of the sound a figure steps - Jyamis, one of the gods of music, and a former Solar soul. He smiles politely, inclining his head. "Welcome back." Then his eyes set themselves on the instrument.

Gallius bows to Jyamis and holds up the instrument. "It is well made, and has endured the ages quite well. The reaction of the keys is remarkable, and tone is warm and rich. The work of your hands is a joy to play, Jyamis, but the music it brings forth is always yours, and can never be mine." She smiles and goes on, "I have brought back what you desired, and I wish you to accept it as a token of my appreciation and friendship, and to play it and remember the music of the sea."

The god blinks back tears, smiling as he cradles the instrument to his chest like a child would to a long-lost toy. Then he returns to himself, and a new sparkle of understanding washes over his face. "I remember now," he murmurs, half to himself. "Lady Gallius, I wish for you to have something." And with that, he reaches out, pressing his fingertips to the war-woman's forehead. Power erupts from around him, a blossoming of Essence that radiates the songs of birds and the passionate cries of lovers, the melodic strains of the harp and the crashing waves of the ocean that Jyamis loved, all at once.

Gallius gasps and then smiles, feeling a sudden rush. She sees things of the past. She sees the Blessed Isle of old, hears the sea singing in the caves, basks in the warmth of the Sun, and feels the joy of the best days of the First Age. For a moment she sees memories pouring through her mind, of joy, sadness, and music. Always music. Echoing the words of the man who once bore her spark she says softly, "I remember now." And then she returns to the now once more.

Jyamis smiles slowly. "Yes, you understand," he says. "Music is at the heart of all things. And now, I must go speak to Yaogin. There are things I remember now, things he must hear... You are all welcome here," he adds, looking from face to face. "Come soon, and tell me of the music you make."

"I would be honored to do so," replies Ramar as the ancient soul looks from face to face. "I am glad to see that your instrument has been returned, and honored to have heard your songs." He then turns to Gallius, and smiles, "It is done, is it?"

Gallius bows to Jyamis, "We will return as chance allows, my friend." She is still feeling a strangeness in herself. A strength that has been increased. "Now we must part again, though. There is much that needs doing." And she must find another to serve. She has one in mind already, however. One near and dear to her tasks.

Chi-Yosh lays a hand on the Master's shoulder as they walk down the steps of the Bureau of Destiny. The Dawn lays out the pieces like a web. Heaven has grown secluded and departed from Destiny, while a few loopholes still exist. Lytek wishes to advance, but possibly does not have the politics to do so. "You have met him as an Envoy to Destiny," points out Chi-Yosh, "You know him, and the work that he does." Not fully knowing The Master's true position in the Hierarchy in Destiny and of Secrets, he asks the Sidereal if his powers with the Celestial Bureaucracy can be used to aid the Daimyo.

As always, the Master is the hallmark of eloquent speech, and his reply is evocative of the nature the Solars have come to know: "Yes."

With that out of the way, the Master returns the group to the offices of Lytek in the Bureau of Heaven. He makes his way inside, vouching silently for the group as he passes the officials and scribes of the Bureau. More than once he slips a note to a passing clerical assistant, presumably one of the thousand-and-one surreptitious channels by which the Sidereals operate. No appointment is necessary; the Master strides into Lytek's office, accompanied by the three Solars. "Ahh, it's you again," smiles the god. "I remember you, from Calibration. Yes, I see you've all improved, greatly improved. I'm very, very proud of you all."

Gallius bows to Lytek, rather abashed by the compliment, but also quite pleased that heaven is paying attention to them. Which it obviously should, though that doesn't occur to her at the moment. "Your compliments are humbling and appreciated. We will continue on our path and do what we were meant to do," she says calmly.

"Why... thank you..." replies Ramar, his smile brightening no small amount to hear such a compliment paid to him. He bows respectfully, and is thankful for the opportunity to hide the sudden tint to his cheeks. "I am glad to hear we are doing well," he says, after regaining some modicum of composure. "I only hope to continue doing so."

Chi-Yosh bears with him the reply from the Bureau of Destiny; he attended to his own matters while Ramar went in search of information and assistance. Now he unfurls it, reading silently over what it says, then handing it to the Master, who hands it to the god - "Deliver this to the Daimyo of the Exaltation. Say to him that a destiny is being executed in connection to this spark and that he has authorization to release any and all information he deems safe to. Authorized, Wayang, God of Silence, Division of Endings, Bureau of Destiny." The note includes Wayang's personal chop, and Lytek examines this document with silence and significance.

Chi-Yosh is elated by what he reads. Before during his first meeting with the Daimyo, the knowledge about the spark could not be given, for he was not given permission. But now... The Solar waits until Lytek has finished reading, taking the subtle cues, and begins as the paper. "Thank you, Daimyo. I come for the information regarding the Spark, and ask a favor regarding it." He lets that linger, before showing the ace. "My gratitude if you can help me would be shown with aid to you through the threads of Destiny's bureaucratic spiderweb."

"Of course, of course.... What can I tell you about it?" asks Lytek, now smiling differently than before.

"I wish to know about the ... Nature, those goals that beat at the heart of it. I wish to understand it. You said there was a definite destiny in connection with this paticular one." Chi-Yosh ends that as though a blank is offered for the God to pick up.

"The spark was driving, questing, never content," explains Lytek carefully. "It was so crafted to match its first bearer, and all those who inherited it could not escape that destiny. Its destiny now is intertwined with yours. You are to prepare a way for it, just as it prepared a way for you."

Chi-Yosh smiles. It is not one of surprise, but simply understanding. For he is all ready working down Destiny's path, and it is only proof to show he is making the right decisions. "Thank you. What I wish then, is that when the bearer of this spark takes their Second Breath, to be notified. Where the new Solar is." His eyes drift over the birds, the magnificent creatures. "You see to them here. You can understand my desire to see to them down there."

Lytek scribes out another quick note, and presents it. "The Bureau of Destiny will alert your companion," he says, nodding in the Master's direction.

Chi-Yosh accepts the note, but it will go to The Master once they leave. He bows once more to the Daimyo. "I thank you once more. And may you find new opportunities ahead." He steps aside, as if letting The Master have the floor with Lytek.
