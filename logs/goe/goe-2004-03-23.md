# Gods of Eden 2004-03-23

With the challenges of Yu-Shan now handled (more or less) Gallius turns to her more important order of business. She will state her case simply to the Master, and see what he says. She speaks to the Master away from the gate they had just used, and does so away from the others for now, as well. "The Solars are scattered still," she begins. "We grow here and there, like weeds stabbing through a street. We spring up again when we are trampled, but I feel we would do better were we to start gathering and organizing in some way. I would like your help in starting this, Master. I think the time has come for the Solars to have a safe haven. A home."

"I offered your Circle such a thing," is the Sidereal's reply. "I still do. That you have grown beyond my offer is natural. It will soon be time for me to return to the business of training other Solars, those who recently Exalted."

Gallius nods and smiles, "You offered us a safe place, Master. Do not think we are not grateful for it. There are many others out there, and I would protect them, as well." She adds more softly, "And you know many of us do not wish to hide forever to be safe. The Solars have much to learn from each other. After all, it is our duty to replace the Realm with something far better and that shall be no easy task. If many of our efforts are wasted on small fights we will either fail or waste precious time."

The Master nods. "Then you face a larger difficulty, and that is to convince the Solars, en masse, to do anything. How would you feel if someone approached you and said, 'surrender your dreams for a time, and join my crusade'? That is how many you approached would perceive your offer, whatever the truth." There is no sternness or rebuke in his voice, simply an air of weariness or familiarity, as though his words stem from sad memories.

"Perhaps that is true," says Gallius. "But not all those who dream are different than I am. Those who wish not to come may continue as they have, knowing that there is one place they may turn to when they are weary. Those who seek safety without anonymity will find it here. Those who have dreams but do not know how to achieve them may find their answers. I do not wish to make subjects of those who are Chosen of Helios, but to give them a place where they can exist. Perhaps few shall come, but I think many will at least send messages or come to see things for themselves."

Nodding, the Master hums. "Then you must find a place that is proof against detection or intrusion, or both together. You must ensure that your stronghold's existence cannot be deduced by statistical analysis. You must proof yourself against spirits and scrying magic. Otherwise the hope of safety you offer will be a faint one. The Realm is not the only enemy the Solars face."

"But you have done this before," says Gallius. "And I imagine other of your colleagues have, as well. Will you help me? Can this be done?" She looks the Master in the eye and explains, "I do not rightly understand why you are helping us, save that you feel it is the right thing to do. I cannot offer you much of value in return. But I am asking for this because I believe it is right. I believe our time is coming, and if Solars remain strangers to each other far more suffering will be the price of our ascension."

"I can help. It can be done." The Southern-born Sidereal quirks the edges of his mouth. "But it is not something you can rush into. Your new acquisition in the East is admirable, and a well-placed first step, but you will invite attack if you make it a sanctuary of any size. Nor is Yu-Shan a safe place, else we would have used it. You must start by building your name among the gods and spirits. There are magics that your Circle can learn that will aid in this effort."

"Actually, that is something of great concern to me," says Gallius. "I am doing all I can to show the spirits and Gods that I desire to work with them, rather than bind them to my will. I would like some advice on where to find the right spirits and how I might help them. Certainly Halvah's aid is proving useful in Greyfalls, and I would like others of that sort to aid me here."

The Master opens his hands in an inviting gesture. "Seek out a knowledgeable occultist. Ramar and Davron both show promise in that regard. I can as well, though it is not my strongest lore."

"I will do that," says Gallius. "I hope they will have time to spare for me. They, too, have their own dreams. And yet.." The Lady smiles, explaining, "A Circle seems to me to be a fated grouping of those whose dreams, though seemingly different, can all follow the same path. But I've started thinking that there are two other Solars I know of who for a time entered our Circle and seemingly departed. And yet they will return. I know it. I believe that in time, all Solars will find their way into one circle and one purpose, but I am not entirely certain how long the wait shall be. All I can do is prepare things for that day."

The Master nods. "Consider, then, the place of refuge you wish to offer. We of the Gold Faction maintain our own strongholds and safe-houses for the Solars, because that is our way."

"I think for now Bridal Veil is a poor place to offer for refuge. We are revealed here already, and have not been able to shield ourselves against prying eyes," says Gallius. "But if the sorcerous power can be found, it will be a fitting place. The point is to be open about ourselves but to be too strong for our enemies to do much about it. As long as they have the ability to see our every move, however, this is impossible. It will take a unifying of spirits, Gods, Solars, and Sidereals to do this. But this brings me to another question that I find difficult to phrase. What does your faction think of Lunars?" That is not her exact question, but it's a starting point.

"The Gold Faction, overall, has no opinion on Lunars, overall," states the Master flatly. Despite his wording, his emphatic cadence leaves no doubt that this is the best truth he can supply.

Gallius laughs softly, "I suppose that is about all you can say on that. And yet they are important to our plans. That cannot be denied. They, too, are meant to have a high place in the world. I admire their bravery, but I wonder about their ultimate goals. As you probably have guessed, my spark's former mate is making his way towards Harborhead. I plan on aiding him."

The Master nods. "My approval is not necessary; my censure is not meaningful. I wish for you to return safely."

Gallius nods her head, guessing that those words are true. "I confess my reasons for going are only mostly professional. The end result, however, offers a reward that I cannot ignore. That place could be turned into something of great value. And with its fall I could greatly accelerate my plans. But it is a dangerous venture. That is why I wish to seek out other Lunars. I also wish for their aid in tempering the impulses of Ma-Ha-Suchi. His taming is beyond my strength. But this is all explanation. I think it might benefit you to know what my plans are beforehand."

The Sidereal makes a gruff-sounding noise. "I know little of the Lunars. Your associate Valon would be a better aid in that."

Gallius nods, "I suppose he would be. If he would stop staring at my tail, anyway." She can't help but smile a bit, though the words cause said tail to thrash. "I think that covers most of the things I wished to tell you about and to ask you about. There is just one last thing, however. How might one find their way into a tomb of the first age? Can a Solar safely reclaim his or her birthright in such a way?"

The Master hums. "Many of the Tombs that were created were crafted by the Dragon-Blooded, who would later form the Shogunate, with all its marvels. Much of their lore is still hoarded in Lookshy, but you may also find answers in the libraries of the Threshold. Sijan, in particular, may hold clues, but the Morticians' Order may not look favorably on your intention. Tread carefully in the City of the Dead, if you go."

"I imagine the Dragon Blooded would rather we never set foot inside any tomb," says Gallius. "But if there was ways to get in that can be found, we will have to consider a way to find them." For a time, she stares off, and then says, "Do the Sidereals know how many Solars there are out there?"

"Even with our astrology it is a difficult matter. There are some, like one you know, who took refuge in the Underworld for a time and so escaped detection by both Factions. Others struck up bargains with spirits and gods, melding their fate with that of their allies." The Master sighs. "I will be honest. It's sometimes distressing at how crafty your kind are, even days after the Exaltation."

Gallius grins, "Yeah, we're pretty tricky sometimes, I suppose. I wonder how well those Solars live." Her expression grows more serious, "I really want to protect those who are in worse situations than I am. It bothers me to think that somewhere there are Chosen of Helios no less worthy than I am and they are running scared."

"Your conquest of a kingdom is a good step. Take control, and build your temporal power. It is not your ideal sanctuary, but it is a necessary step in establishing that which you seek," counsels the Master.

"I will continue as I have started," says Gallius. "And woe to those who would hunt my kind like dogs if our side proves the stronger." She lets out a sigh, "And death to us if we fail!" And here the lady leaps off on a tangent, "Do you enjoy music, Master?"

"Perhaps," the Sidereal says, as his lips quirk. "Why?"

"Because I've got nothing to offer you except music, and I'd like to give you a gift," says Gallius. "You saved my life, you've aided me many times. You have done many things for me, and it just seems odd to me that I've yet to do something just to please you."

"Stretching out and achieving your destiny pleases me," the Master remarks, looking at his Celestial colleague curiously. "What more do I need?"

"Need?" murmurs Gallius. "Need is a beginning, is it not? It is what you want that can make you beautiful." She looks to a flower nearby, "This needs water, it needs earth, and it needs sun. But it wants to bloom. It wants to put forth fruit. It wants to be beautiful."

The Master shrugs. "As you say. Very well. I like music."

Gallius nods to the Master. She will fetch her ophicleide and begin to create music. In the wilds, there are many melodies that can mingle with her own, and bolstered by essence, her song is soon filling the area, drawing all sounds into its flowing motions. This mixture of sound ebbs and flows, and when Gallius' song rises, butterflies swirl about the trees and bands of warm light flow around every living thing. When her own sound grows more quiet the shades are of pale blues, and the butterflies turn into pinpricks of light, like stars bobbing about on hidden strings.
