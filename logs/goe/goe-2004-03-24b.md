# Gods of Eden 2004-03-24b

In the mountains of the Southeast, between the arid desert of the Jackal Tribes and the forbidding and gloomy forests of the Jungle Tribes, there is a great and forgotten citadel carved into the dusky stone. This ancient fastness has no civilized roads that lead to it, nor any easy approaches; all paths to it were sundered in the cataclysm of the Great Contagion. Nevertheless it is sometimes inhabited, as it is now. A fire burns in the ancient hearth, while at the low stone table, a dozen Lunars sit in moot. The seat of honor, highest in the room and warmed by the fire behind it, is reserved for Ma-Ha-Suchi by right of place, and none of the others contest it. A ghost-wind moans softly through the high and narrow windows of the citadel, and shafts of failing sunlight glide through the dusty air as he speaks.

"You have been called here because of this Circle of Solar Exalts," the ancient speaks, his melodious voice betrayed by the imposing fusion of wolf and goat whose shape he bears. He raises a taloned paw and gestures to the Solars, seated at the far end of the table. "Speak."

Having managed to get this invitation, Gallius begins her explanation without any ado, knowing that Lunars have no appreciation for wasted words. "Ma-Ha-Suchi and his forces march on Harborhead, seeking to strike a mighty blow against the Realm. I have seen for myself and heard from others that Ma-Ha-Suchi is considered one of great virtue among the Lunars. No doubt one such as he can do great things on his own. But I do not think he should be left alone in this task."

The Lady pauses only for a moment before going on, "Harborhead is an opportunity to present a united front. I cannot speak for all Solars, but I believe that my kind are meant to stand beside the Chosen of Luna. I also would say if Ma-Ha-Suchi is one of great virtue that those of virtue would do well to aid him. His methods are what I imagine are holding people back. I know his main desire is to dispose of the Realm."

"There are many ways to do this. I suggest that turning these enemies into our friends is the best idea. I have a dream for Harborhead, a dream that I believe the Lunars will approve of. I want to create a new kind of human kingdom. A place where men and women can be part of nature again while still holding on to the advantages of their cities." Gallius looks about at the elders, trying to gauge their opinions.

"I would restrain the more violent desires of Ma-Ha-Suchi in his victory and offer mercy and hope to those who survive this contest of wills," explains Gallius. "I cannot do this on my own. I ask for you to help us. Battle is certainly required in this, but total destruction is not. If we are stronger, less people may have to die."

Ma-Ha-Suchi says nothing, and his face is an unreadable mask. The other Lunars consider in silence. Finally, one - Sand Spider - rises, addressing the hybrid warrior at the head of the table with a wordless inclination of his head before he speaks. "What Ma-Ha-Suchi does with his warriors is not our affair. You seek to make it our affair. He is murr-ya; you have no face among us, and you bring two nain-ya Solars who managed a weak sorcerer's trials."

"I have no face among you, but that does not make me a fool or a child," answers Gallius simply. "I am not asking you to make his people your business. I am suggesting you make use of the powers you have to aid in Harborhead. If you are unable to handle such a contest, then I have no words for you. However, if you are interested but have wishes that differ from Ma-Ha-Suchi, it would seem to me that you have some desire that Ma-Ha-Suchi's orders to his men not lead to that course which you so dislike. If you wish only to fight and let him do as he will, then you are already aiding us in whatever ways seem best to you."

Sand Spider rises, glowering as his fists clench together. "Upstart," he spits, hissing a bit. "We duel now. I'll see that you're--" He's interrupted by the sound of claws scraping across stone. Ma-Ha-Suchi speaks. "As you just said, Sand Spider, she has no face. You'll challenge an outsider to a duel of honor, now?" Trapped, the southern Lunar quiets down, and returns to his seat. "If you want to attack her, you may do so after the moot, and she will be free to respond," Ma-Ha-Suchi continues. The room falls silent again, as other Lunars now consider their own responses.

"I do not come to make you do anything. To tell you to make Ma-Ha-Suchi's affairs your own is folly. I have come to speak what I have observed, to offer the thoughts of one whose ways may perhaps offer a new perspective. To offer the viewpoint of those who live further from the boundaries of Creation." Ramar draws in a breath, and turns to address each Lunar in turn, "At Harborhead, the Realm will be driven back. Here is the chance to show to your packs what can be done in this world, here is a chance to show all of Creation what the Lunars are capable of. To show others the Virtue of the Silver Way."

Another man - Tamuz - rises, nodding politely to Ma-Ha-Suchi before taking his turn. "I think before we go further, I would like to hear of the deeds of these two nain-ya. Weeping Prowler has been diligent in spreading the rumor of his proteges, but I have not heard their boasts for myself. Come forward and speak, please." He sits down, and a few Lunars glower at him resentfully. A few others chuckle, smile, or show no outward expression.

A smile spreads around Ramar's face. "You wish me to tell my tale?" The Solar who is also the Changing Moon begins to spin his tale. He begins shortly after the Trials he'd faced, when his deeds became worth telling in the eyes of the Lunars. Greyfalls, the beginning of the journey. His words are chosen carefully, and as he speaks, he lets his face tell its own tale. Eyes seem to light with excitement when he speaks of his heroic deeds, his smile broadens as he reaches points he is particularly proud of. The tale has taken a life of its own now, and Ramar is merely the way through which it is told. Its own path grows stronger as the Teller of the Tale's words gift it with the breath of life. As the tones alter and the Solar stands, his tale blossoms after the careful cultivation. Each thread that he'd lain down is now woven together, and the journey's path reaches its destination.

From Chi-Yosh's understanding of the Silver Way, of Lunar tradition, there are few things that are most important. Opposition of civilization, of slavery, of defending those who can't, and taking the fight to the abusers of the ones who can't. Civilization he has not destroyed, but the Realm the corrupt, he has. He lays them out simply, emphasizing what he has done that is held up in the Lunar mindset, and while his words are not humble, they are made powerful, not pretty.

Tamuz smiles, and Ma-Ha-Suchi nods in slow agreement. The other Lunars murmur among themselves, or remain silent. Another elder rises - Nightrunner, a Lunar in jet-black jackal-man's shape. "This matter of Harborhead," he says. "What is your wish, Ma-Ha-Suchi?" The goat-wolf's reply is equally succinct: "I intend to leave not one stone upon another." Nightrunner turns, then, to Gallius, and questions her similarly. "And what is your wish?"

"I care nothing for stones," says Gallius, her expression changing, turning into something of a dark mask. "They can be delved. Let those who would cling to the Realm die there to the man, but let those who would live free of the lies of our enemy be spared and healed, under my care or others who will tend them. Let those who would hold slaves also be destroyed. Those are my wishes."

"If the massed citizens of Harborhead were put in your care, how would you be responsible to them?" asks Nightrunner, quietly.

"I have in my hands the beginnings of a nation," says Gallius. "With it I have the means to create for those who survive a new place. This place will shelter them like a city but not turn them into weaklings cowering and forgetting their place in the world. I know you feel that way of those who dwell in cities, and I agree. They have forgotten what it means to be part of this world. I will make a place where those who truly are weak are cared for, but those who are able shall use their hands or get out. I feel that enough time has been wasted. They will learn swiftly if they believe they must."

Nightrunner returns to his seat, and is silent for long moments. At last he speaks. "I will assist you," he says. Tamuz, too, nods. "I as well." The others remain quiet for a few moment. At last, three other elders rise in silent support.

Sand Spider rises from his seat, shifting shape rapidly. His war-form is a horrid, four-armed spider, mottled grey and blue, with bulging muscles and glowing eyes. "I challenge you," he hisses, pointing now at Chi-Yosh. "You dared to boast of your deeds before a gathering of the murr-ya. For that presumption I'll teach you a lesson." And he advances.

For the next few minutes, the combatants face each other, turning, sparring, exchanging blows and deflecting the others' attacks. Sand Spider is impossibly fast and terrifyingly strong; for his part, Chi-Yosh is nimble, able, and protected at every turn. Sand Spider fights with tooth and claw, and all the strength, cunning and rage of a divine beast-man in the fullness of his power. And Chi-Yosh responds, with everything that makes him the Chosen of Helios. Both combatants' anima banners and Caste Marks burn with blinding, incandescent fury by the end of the contest, and Sand Spider is breathing heavily and scored in a dozen places as he finally throws Chi-Yosh, half-conscious, to the ground, where he stays.

"Gallius," the Lunar growls, through weak and rapid gasps, "is this the caliber of man who willingly follows you on this crusade?"

Time slows down. The first instant, Chi-Yosh's stomach is crushed in an iron grip, before adrenaline reflates it. Thoughts are mere rapid impressions: Survival. Weakness. Gallius's cause. Assured Defeat. Gallius's cause. Respect. The answer comes as the Nain-ya's hands fall to his kamas, and rather then fear, he wears the mask of determination and a smile welcoming the punishment.

Gallius looks at the Lunar with disdain. "Chi-Yosh is an noble man and true to his word. He is the guardian of my Circle's Honor. There is nothing that makes a man more worthy to stand at my side. He has proven he will stand for what is right even in the face of a more powerful foe. There is no better way to show courage," she answers.

"Yes... and you did nothing, you stood aside, as you should," pants Sand Spider, as the burning bonfire of his Lunar's anima banner continues to rage around him. "I.. support your cause." And with that, two other of the formerly-motionless Lunars rise as well, in support.

Gallius nods just slightly to Sand Spider. She will wait for Chi-Yosh to rise and then she will bow to the moot. "We are finished then. If I am to bring my own army to bear, I must go create it," she explains. "If you have need to send word to me, you know where to find me." And with this she is finished here.

Body screaming, head swimming, the roaring Essence of his Anima like a fever, Chi-Yosh is not quick in crawling to his feet. All worth it to see the eight Lunar standing. There is no question in knowing the aid of his Circle will be needed to help him afterwards, it is all the world that he walk outside on his own power.

Ramar smiles. _And so a new dream begins. Perhaps this one will be a little brighter than what has been. We would do well to be cautious._ He offers a hand to his friend, helping him along. "You did well." He nods to Gallius, "As did you. I am proud to be a member of the Circle."

"Ramar, my friend," says Gallius softly. "We've only just begun."
