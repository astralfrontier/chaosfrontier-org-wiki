# Gods of Eden 2004-03-27

The Sun has risen and fallen several times since Ramar last set foot in Nexus. Now he comes again, one of four passengers on a sailboat chartered upstream. He departs and strides down the streets of Nexus, purpose burning clear in his mind as he finds a White-Robed Man. "I seek an audience with the Council of Entities," he explains, "Or whomever it is I would speak with concerning my purpose," which he then goes on to relate.

Men of other nations might look flabbergasted. This one simply draws his visitor into an alleyway, and reveals a shortsword beneath his robes. "Prove your identity," he says, eyes glittering with challenge.

The golden circle within a circle reveals Ramar's identity. The hand on his sword is his assurance that he is prepared to reveal a good deal more than that should it come to it. "Is this proof enough for you?"

"I've never seen it personally," the man admits. "But wait for a messenger at the 'Hunted Lord'." And with that, he steps out of the alleyway, merging with the massed hordes of humanity in the streets.

It is then that Ramar reaches into the pockets of his robes and withdraws some cloth with which to conceal the burning brand of his Caste Mark. _No being of power shall reveal themselves, after all._ He then pulls his hood over the top of his head and then moves with the hordes of humanity towards the 'Hunted Lord'.

In due course the rest-house is occupied by a garrison of mercenaries, ostensibly to acquire a new recruit. They pay the master of the house handsomely, drink, tell tales, swap stories, and in general embody the essence of hard-edged mirth so common among fighting men. And when they leave with Ramar among them, it is as gentlemen and friends. Ramar alone knows that these men are commanded to draw steel and cut him down the moment he should prove dangerous or unfaithful, for he is going to meet with the Council of Entities.

It is not too difficult for Ramar to adopt the hard-edged mirth of the fighting men who now escort him down the street. He will do his part to make the illusion that much more convincing. As they walk, he keeps his questions to himself, save for one, "Do you know how I am to refer to them?"

No man gives answer, to this or any other question. The company marches, winding their way through the streets of the grand metropolis, the 'city of a thousand sins', and they navigate toward the ruins of the First Age's splendor whose towers are the bones of a corpse long-rotted and buried under the newly-built heart of the city. Through sealed doors and past hissing vents of steam they march, taking twists and turns to throw off any pursuit. The company commander at last places his hand to a metal plate on one wall. As a hidden door slides open, he speaks at last. "Inside with ye," he growls, gesturing.

Here in the graveyard of the First Age, the long-buried tunnels, Ramar finds himself somewhat nervous. When at last they reach the hidden door, Ramar pauses, and draws in a deep and calming breath. He nods, slowly, "Very well. Thank you." And then he turns, and steps inside.

The tower is large, and a massive spiral staircase of translucent crystal ascends to its very peak. Doorways, arches, and catwalks adjoin it at various altitudes, looking like frozen spiderwebs of gossamer and dream, and yet this entire structure is remarkably sound as well as beautiful to behold. Ramar ascends, accompanied by the mercenaries, and notes many people hiding in the recesses and doorways as he passes. At length the top-most level is attained, and the wanderer can behold the city of Nexus almost in its entirety were he to walk to any edge of the room. The Council of Entities is here, gathered around their table, for the august body of beings assembled can be no other.

Wearing his silver mask is the Emissary, reputedly the very same being who founded Nexus so many centuries ago. There is the Midnight Queen, who wears a spider-silk veil and wears the fingernails of her two smallest fingers on the left hand very long and encrusted with jewels. The Evening Master, wearing an assortment of jewelry and gems. The Doctor, squat and sturdy, with smiling eyes and a hard face. The Astrologer, whose attention is occupied by a book. The Minister of Ways neither sits nor stands, but floats. The Dawn Sergeant wears a great sword sheathed on her back, and her face is concealed by a full-coverage helmet. The Midday Husband and the August Councilor of the Eclipse sit quietly, discussing some matter or other. "Welcome," intones the Minister of Ways. "Speak your petition, Exalt."

"I am honored," speaks Ramar, as he turns his gaze across the august body of beings assembled before him. Wonders here even in the heart of Nexus' old splendor. Ramar is careful here, though his smile is worn easily enough. "I have come to offer my abilities to aid you and bring more of Creation back to the way it once was." He then goes on to outline what it is he has planned, to bring the Wyld Area within Nexus' districts back to the stability of Creation. He explains to them how he plans to do it, and then bows his head and holds his hands in a gesture of thanks as he waits to hear the Council's Response.

The Emissary flicks a casual hand, and Ramar's quick eyes catch the details of it. Studded with emeralds, it's a thin glove of leather that reveals an emaciated, almost withered hand, with spindly fingers hidden away beneath the leather. The Doctor, Evening Master and Astrologer gather together, speaking amongst themselves for a time.

Keenly aware that his fate may well be one of the things hanging in the balance here, Ramar is silent. The Solar is also observant. His quick eyes and keen ears are kept alert, filing away little details that might one day be important... or at the very least interesting.

Finally the three break from their circle, and the Astrologer speaks, lilting her words. "Your power is to sanctify oaths, Chosen. Swear to this council that you will make restitution to the city of Nexus for any ills or evil your action may bring about."

"And I would then be making restitution for any and all new ills and evils that transpire in the new section of the city..." muses Ramar slowly. He pauses thoughtfully, considering the council members carefully. _The first of many a trap, I suspect. I shall have to be careful about my counter-offer._ "Perhaps though I may counter-offer a different oath, if this is what you would require of me?"

A few of the councillors look at each other. "What is your suggestion, Solar?" asks the Astrologer, smiling sweetly.

The Solar takes a moment to collect his thoughts and weave a counter-offer that will help him to avoid the traps and pitfalls that the Council may have set. "And should the Wyld zone cause destruction to other areas of Nexus during its shaping process... I would make restitution for that..." He pauses a moment, and regards the Council, waiting, wondering.

The men and women look at each other for long moments. Finally, the Emissary emits a low and metallic chuckle. "True to your nature as always, Solar Wind," this being remarks. "Very well. Swear your oath to the council, and sanctify it with the blessing of Heaven."

"This I swear," breathes Ramar as the letters of the oath begin to burn brightly in the air around him. The runes that will Sanctify it then begin to swirl around, blown about as if by the Solar Wind he's so named for. They then leap Heavenwards, disappearing into the reaches of the tower's ceiling. Ramar breathes in slowly, recovering, "Well then," he looks at the Council, bowing his head once more.

"You have our permission to act," says the Doctor, sternly. "Do not abuse it." And with that, the Councilors signify their visitor with a low, polite nod or half-bow.

"I am honored, and I thank you for your permission," replies Ramar. He then considers something, "When do I have your permission to do this? I ask, so that I might know when to go down and use my abilities. If I may know such a thing, that is."

"I guess you're not familiar with how Nexus works," remarks the Doctor, smiling. "We aren't going to tell you when or even if you can do something. That's not the Council's job." The Dawn Sergeant chimes in, sounding rather less like chimes and rather more like gears grinding together. "Just that we won't have you killed for causing a disaster."

"Ahhh. I understand." Ramar smiles back, "Then I shall use my judgement, and will not cause a disaster for your city." He bows once more and proffers his hands up in a gesture of thanks. "Is there anything else I need do then before our business is concluded?"

The Doctor shakes his head. "Stay alive," he remarks with a smile.

Slowly, as though waking from a dream, Ramar wanders down the streets of the Firewander district. His robes flutter and billow in the cool breeze as he makes his way past the wretches and the robbers waiting to prey on one another. He glides past them, moving to the less populated areas of the Firewander, until at last he comes to the edge of the mile-wide storm gnashing and gnawing about at the very stability of Creation. The Wyld. "And so... it begins..."

_I must not let my fear or my doubts control me. Creation will hear my Dream and find itself becoming the path I create. This place will become more than it was before... it shall change and improve..._ The Quill of Heaven's thoughts turn to the task at hand now, and he presses the fingertips of his hands together, drawing them back as he focuses his mind, projecting his inner calmness outward, sending it rippling through the raging chaos of the Wyld. His breathing is strained, and beads of sweat begin trickling down his forehead, illuminated by the glittering glow of his Caste Mark. All around him Essence flows, guided by his thoughts and his dreams, surging into the patches of now-calmed Wyld to give it shape, to give it form and purpose. To give it truth here in Creation.

Now, as the Wyld surges back against his encroaching wishes, Ramar strains under the effort. The air around him begins to fly faster and faster, threatening to whip itself into a whirlwind, before suddenly it's brushed aside, and there is utter stillness. Rains of colorless fire begin to fall from the Wyld-spawned sky, they hiss and steam as they become nothing more than harmless water. As the ground threatens to crack apart at the seams, the thread of Ramar's consciousness flows over it, sweing back the wounds. Across the district, a breath of air is sucked out of a would-be thief by the sudden rush of wind. His dagger falls to the ground, and as it falls, its shadow is burned away by a bright golden and white light. The Solar himself disappears within the bright beautiful vision of his anima unfurling, illuminating all within its path by the light that pierces the Wyld.

The Solar, now revealed in all of his Heavenly Glory breathes in. He strides into the heart of the raging Chaos, and with one last triumphant shout returns it to Creation. A radiant sphere spreads out from the Solar, stretching out around him as Ramar shouts his exultant cry! For a moment it is too bright to see anything, the world around Ramar seems to dissolve into light. When at last his eyes are clear, he kneels at the center of the Firewander section reborn. It has gone through much, and like Ramar, it has come out all the better for enduring it. Indeed, it is brighter than before, is better than before. Ramar pants, trying desperately to recover his breath. He speaks, his voice tinged with the power of his Anima, "_**Know now, those of you who dwell here, that your homes and your lands are reborn. You have it within you to make them better than anyone has seen before in this district. Do so.**_"

The crowd that has slowly started to gather out of curiosity, and that has stayed well back in fear, continue to cower. Nevertheless, Ramar can discern a few hopeful eyes through the celestial bonfire of his anima banner.

In the days following the Rebirth of Firewander, as it has been called, Ramar has remained within the district. None have dared to attack the Solar, and the Eclipse finds himself using another of his abilities. He has been offering his aid to the citizens of Firewander, at least those few hopeful souls who dare to dream once more. He gives them his skills with the bureaucracy, his knowledge of how to wheel and deal and what's more, his hope that things might be better than they once more. With his help, indeed they might. Though it is not to be anything in the immediate future. There are still all manner of unsavory types in the district, but even they must admit that there is something to be said for improvement. And now, Ramar relaxes, as away from it all as one can get within Nexus. That is to say he's sitting in one of the many inns, sipping on a cup of tea, pondering the leaves.

The Solar's reverie is interrupted by the arrival of another of the Council's representatives, who coughs politely and bows. "The council brings a message for you," this man says. "By the decree of Doctor Udelph, as of several months ago, 'No being of power shall make a display of obvious power unless its own life be beset.' As you have violated this edict, the Council and the city of Nexus demand compensation."

_Of course._ Ramar allows himself one more sip of tea, using the cup to hide the sigh that threatens to escape just now. He looks up at the representative, smiles. "Yes..." He laughs, ruefully, "I suppose I have. Am I to ask you what the compensation demanded is, or who is it I should see about doing such?"

"Two talents of jade," the man replies promptly. "Payable by the end of the month. If you cannot render payment, you can either speak with the Council of Entities, or you can sell yourself into indentured servitude. Your er, services, are worth at least that much, I'm sure."

Ramar nods, "And if I wished to point out to someone that my life was beset by the forces of the Wyld, and that had I not revealed myself, the city and myself would have been torn asunder, are you the one to whom I would relay such a message?"

The man shakes his head. "It is known that you entered Firewander of your own volition. I'd advise you to not waste anyone's time with such a story."

Ramar smiles, "Then I shall accept your advice and not waste anyone's time with such a story. Forgive me if I have wasted yours. Is there anything else? Would you care to sit and have a cup of tea?"
