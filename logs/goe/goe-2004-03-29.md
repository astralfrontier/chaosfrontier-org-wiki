Once some semblance of stability was established in her initial conquests, Gallius began to expand. The first target was away to the east, a series of small villages (called Levendon) that specialize in river transport of a rather impressive kind. Rather than rely wholly on oars or sails, the people most often were propelled with the direct aid of elementals.

Their leader was a godling who had bound many elementals to her will and used them to maintain her power over the people. While some might see this as a form of tyranny, Gallius and her advisors learned that the people were treated fairly. While the laws were a bit vague, they were enforced and the people were kept safe.

Gallius met with the godling and the two had a very long conversation. The godling, Gallius learned, was very wise and surprisingly powerful for her modest origins. She was interested in joiningg the Nation of the Sun, and because of her position and her just use of power, Gallius suggested the godling remain as the leader of the city in the name of the Nation of the Sun.

The reasons for the rather easy taking of Levendon became clear within a few days of the victory. It seemed that Yealon's dictator had his eye on Levendon for some time. Seeing the Nation of the Sun move in, the dictator grew desperate.

Unfortunately for the dictator, his plot was obvious and his mode of conquest clumsy. Calling upon spirits was not the wisest of choices, for Gallius' treatment of the godling of Levendon made it clear that she respected them and would treat them far better than he would.

The death of the dictator took the city he ruled by shock. Nobody saw Yana slip into the kitchen. Nobody suspected a poisoning. And with the death of the most grasping, megalomaniacal, and spineless dictator in the area, there was little mourning. Even with his fall, the take-over was not easy.

Gallius had to make many deals with various spirits in the city, but it taught her many things. She found spirits to be little different than humans. Negotiation, oath, bribery, and threats were all used in the work done in Yealon. In the end, Gallius had taken over a city with little bloodshed.

The city of Damon's Well marked one of the most important stages of Gallius' conquests. The highly productive state lies along the Lesser Rock River's shore. Due to its more considerable size, greater preparations were made. Damon's Well relies heavily upon the wind and the water to create the energy that fuels its very existance. In many ways, this power feeds the entire state.

Between bribes, promises, and bullying, Gallius and her allies leave the spirits of the wind few options but to grow still and encourage the waters to grow violent, damaging the water wheels in many places. After letting this disaster send the city into a bit of panic, Gallius and her entourage ride into the city. What follows is a simple ultimatum from the servants of the Unconquered Sun.

The bargain was a hard one to drive, of course. A few of the more troublesome residents of the city had to be suitably bribed, and a few were simply sent away due to their lack of proper motivation. In the end, the regime change was surprisingly bloodless, save for a few problems that Yana put away with well-aimed shafts.

Calibas was a particularly swift conquest. Being done shortly after Damon's Well, the city state's ruler was easily removed. In fact, after hearing that Gallius had taken over their large neighbor, the Prime Minister fled so fast that the servants found warm food left on her table and a complete mess left in the departing woman's wake.

Due to this situation, and in fear of military engagement, the people of the city quickly elected a group of wise men and women to negotiate for entry into the Nation of the Sun. This would be the first nation to so readily surrender.

Following the victory at Calibas, Gallius found herself presented with an interesting target south and east of her current holdings. Because of their military bent, the people of Amber Vale would prove a truly fascinating conquest. Battle, Marina cautioned, would be a terrible choice. Even with the states gained so far, the costs of war would be far too high.

Acting on this notion, Gallius suggested something so remarkably simple and odd that her advisors were stunned, and then eager to make it come to pass. Amber Vale was a democracy, and elections for the leader of their government were about to occur. "Why," said Gallius, "Should I do anything but try to win the popular election?" And so the wheels of politic were thrown into motion.

Calling upon the talents of her advisors, Gallius found a way to swiftly gain attention as a viable candidate. Her own formidible and potent personality was then brought to bear. With the bribery of the city god, the victory was complete.

Seeing a small village standing in her path, Lady Gallius pauses to speak with her advisors. After sharing a few words, the Lady rides into the middle of the town, and there she waits. Her reputation naturally proceeds her over such short distances, and so she find herself confronted with a few nervous guards. The Lady holds out her hand, "Hold!"

The guards pause and look to each other, confused. "You are my soldiers now, and this city is part of the Nation of the Sun. Here are the terms your city shall enjoy. Please study them to make the transition easy for us all." The lady holds out a pair of sealed scrolls. "If you have any questions, you may direct them to Marina. You will summon your leaders or elders to that inn," and at this she points to the only multi-storied building in town.

The nations of Pragon Vault and Lagon's Ridge were a dual conquest. Gallius had heard that a pair of her neighbors had a feud that had gone on so long that nobody knew how it even hard start. Out of curiousity Gallius arranged for a meeting with a local spirit and found out that the entire mess started with the alleged theft of a hog some two hundred and fifty years ago.

Gallius pried further into the past and the spirit revealed that it had a rival in the area. There was another spirit named Scowling Wind that for years had used the conflict to generate worship for himself as a spirit of war. In particular this spirit claimed power over accurate aims and favorable conditions for battle. Time and time again when things hung in the balance Scowling Wind would force a stalemate.

The two countries were now at war as the feud was again erupting amongst the two families that had managed to maintain their hold for so many years. Watching the armies move into position on the field, Gallius and her advisors could only scratch their heads over such an absurd cause for war. Still, the war was quite handy. While the two armies pummelled each other Gallius' forces moved-in.

First Pragon Vault was entered, and there Gallius inspired a revolution against the elected leader. Simultaneously, the leader of Lagon's Ridge was poisoned by Yana. He was not killed, but he did wake up tied to the back of a running horse with a note glued to his head. The note was very much to the point: "There is a enough silver in your bags to maintain you for a year. Do not attempt to return."

The armies were still fighting for a full week after both nations were taken from their control. Only when their supplies were completely gone and their reinforcements failed to arrive did the armies start to lose some interest in killing each other. Exhausted, both sides retreated only to find out that they were no longer ruled by the ministers they had been. They were now officially part of the Nation of the Sun.

The last detail to see to was the reward of the informative spirit. In Pragon Vault there had been a dragon-bloood who was in control of a local manse. With a little convincing, the terrestrial exalt surrendered control of the manse and the spirit was allowed to tap its potential.
