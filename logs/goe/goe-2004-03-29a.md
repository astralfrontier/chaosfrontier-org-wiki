# Gods of Eden 2004-03-29a

The tent is comfortable and well-equipped for its purpose; Gallius is no stranger to roughing it on the campaign trail, and her whirlwind of political and military activity must sometimes give way to periods of rest and relaxation. She sleeps comfortably, the fires of her ambitious program burning faintly in their coals for a time.

Gallius rarely dreams, but she she does it is seems to always be a matter of import or prophecy. She has learned to accept this. To an extent. Tonight her mind for a long time is empty, drifting through shadows into shadows, only to shift away and settle on a seemingly endless plain, rolling in the distance. She kneels there, her head bowed as if dragged-down. With a sigh the lady slowly lifts her head and looks over the flat, barren land.

She is not surprised to be here, though she has never seen this place before with her waking eyes. She pushes herself to her feet and looks to either side. She is not alone. The large forms of enormous lions set on either side of her, their claws testing the earth. Where they dig in, a black ooze seeps out. Gallius' tail thrashes behind her as she meets the eyes of the lion and finds that they are dimmed by the strength that lies inside her. The Lady blinks, and the lions both turn to stone and then she is alone.

The Lions are not the only beings occupying this rolling endless plain. Just behind one of the larger hills, smoke is rising and carried on the wind. Wisps of smokey grey wind fall through the air. As they blow past Gallius, a voice, perhaps a familiar one can be heard. "Lady Gallius?" It is Ramar's voice, though it seems lighter, a little airier. "Is that you?"

Gallius frowns and turns to consider her tail. "I'm not entirely sure," she says. A moment later she decides, "Yes, it is me. Or as close to me as I can be." Whatever that means.

He is standing there beside Gallius, clad in a plain hooded grey robe. His eyes peer out from within the shadows of the hood and he smiles. "Yes. And I believe you are close enough to be you." Ramar smiles, and bows his head. "Why are we here?"

Ramar says, "And where are the others?"

"They are not here," says Gallius. "I am here because there is no other place for me to be." The lady rubs her arms, trying to generate some warmth against the wind. She is dressed in only a thin gown of some blue fabric. "I do not know why you are here. Perhaps only because I need you to be."

"Perhaps." Ramar tilts his head a little. He tosses back the hood of his robe and stands nearer to Gallius, offering her a bit of warmth. "There's a fire back here, although I believe any warmth is merely a function of our higher selves. If you believe in such things."

"Fires won't last long in this place," says Gallius. "This is the emptiness of my mind at night. It's usually so quiet that I don't even exist in this endless realm. Let's go watch the fire die."

"As well she should," comes another voice, this one deep and booming, spoken with the air of confidence that only a lifetime of training and skill can bestow.

Gallius pauses as she turns. "Rarely do I hear a voice here not my own, and now two?" she turns around to see to whom this other voice belongs. "And what brings you to this emptiness, stranger?" she asks.

The voice belongs to a man who towers above the other two. He is clad in ornately wrought armor, though it is kept untidied. Food and dirt cling to it, and one of his massive hands is wrapped around a sword easily as long as the man himself is. "He is the one that brings me here," he replies, indicating Ramar. "Me and the others."

"They you are splinters of his mirror," says Gallius. "But my own will not come to this place, for I have banished them." The Lady looks at the strange warrior, then turns back to Ramar. "Curious, the changes time can bring about."

"You have banished them," asks Ramar, with his eyebrows raised. "How is such a thing possible?" The towering warrior then chuckles, and it is a deep booming laugh. "Doing the lady Jupiter's work are ya?" He turns to Ramar, "Curious lad." "I concur," replies yet another voice, this one floating somewhere above Ramar.

"No, but I will not let them come here," says Gallius. "I do not wish to speak with the shards of the mirror. They are too strong." The lady only slowly turns to confront the new voice. "My emptiness it seems has been disturbed. So many voices."

"What do you mean, Lady Gallius? What is it that they are too strong for?" And as the other voice speaks, Ramar looks up. A lady, floats there, descending slowly. "We are all called here tonight. But it is so empty here. So flat."

"It is always empty here," says Gallius. "The voices pour over into me," she says. "And sometimes they make me feel things that should not be mine. They are not mine. It is nice having other voices around that don't change me, though."

The two That-Are-Not-Ramar turn and exchange a knowing look. Ramar catches this, then turns to Gallius, "Then perhaps this is why we are here tonight." "Perhaps indeed," replies another voice, as a green-clad jester climbs out of a black crevice in the ground. "But I don't like this place very much. We should go. I'm sure there's much to learn"

Gallius frowns at the jester and sighs softly. "Well, I'm afraid there's not much here to see. This place is rather barren. It's potential, but it is not yet achieved."

Ramar smiles, "It could be. But you have achieved so much Lady Gallius." For the time being the others are silent. Choosing instead to listen to what Ramar has to say. "May I show you, Lady?"

"If you would like to," says Gallius. "But I have not completed my dreams, and so things here do not wish to change." She looks at the other voices, considering each in turn. "It's odd. I did not think the other voices could speak into my mind."

"Then it may be that you have strayed outside of the realm of your mind. Or perhaps I have wandered into it. I know that I am roaming, that I seek answers to questions left unasked for far too long, while somewhere I rest, my mortal shell as hollow as an old log." Ramar turns about, "If I am intruding upon you Lady Gallius, I am sorry, I do not mean to."

"It's nice not being alone," says Gallius. "If you are intruding, I do not mind. Show me what you would, though. This place is empty all the time, and when I wake I have nothing to remember."

"Then I shall try to help you find something to remember. All dreams need not be realized, Lady Gallius. There are more to them than simply finding out what must be done, and then and only then letting it take root..." He gestures to the flat ground, "This could be different, full of potential in another form..." He shrugs, "Although it is merely how I view things, and I know not whether you should wish to see them the way I do."

At this the towering armor-clad warrior speaks with his booming voice, "Ye make an interesting point, but why do ye turn back now when it is made?" Ramar turns to the warrior, "I am unsure. Am I to change the way you wish?" The towering man laughs, "That's not why we're here... you'll see soon enough."

Gallius tilts her head and looks around the flat landscape. "I wonder if you are here for me, or if I am here for you," she says simply. "My dreams are made manifest in the real. Here, I don't know. They don't seem to show up."

"We shall see soon enough," responds the Jester. A look from the lady silences him as Ramar speaks once more, "What are your dreams, Lady Gallius?"

"My dreams are to free men from lies and to let them live their lives," says Gallius. "I hope I can create a proper order that will last longer than the first rule of the Solars. Along the way there are a lot of beautiful things we can create."

There's a chuckle from the other lady at this, it's a light airy sound. "That is a good dream," she says, and then turns to watch Ramar. "What have you to say to her now?" Ramar looks up, "What is it you wish of me?" He turns to Gallius, "These are good dreams, they are beautiful goals that you will accomplish someday... but do you dream of nothing else?"

Gallius looks down at her feet and hmms. "I know I used to," she says. "But I've forgotten them all. There are things I had wanted to do, and yet.. when they become troublesome I just forget all about them."

"Why is it that they have become troublesome, Lady Gallius?" As Ramar asks the questions, the three visitors are whispering amongst themselves. And they are watching, curiously, as the two Solars exchange words.

"Whenever something grows difficult that is not related to my overall dream and purpose, I give it up," explains Gallius. "I do not have time to deal with such things. I can only move on and do my duty."

"Perhaps this is why the other voices are too strong. They fill you with terrible purpose, and you move with them to do your duty." Ramar considers, "But simply because something has grown difficult does not mean it should be culled or given up... it may need tending, and such things will perhaps help in ways you might not have thought of before." Ramar and the three have each spoken in turn here, now they moev about Ramar, peering at him. "Yes, you begin to understand Dreamer." Ramar nods, "You are not here to change me, nor are you here to change Lady Gallius..."

"Perhaps," says Gallius. "But the big dream is more important than anything else. What does it matter what happens to my little dreams if so many people are helped?" The lady looks at her cat tail and adds softly, "I will pay the price."

Ramar says, "If you cannot even help to realize the most insignificant of dreams... how can you realize the greatest of them? I am not saying you need see everything through... but Gallius..." He gestures around, at the empty waste. "You could have much more here... come with me, let us go find a high place, and I shall show you."

"A high place?" says Gallius. "I'm afraid you'll have to make one. There are no higher places here, just endless plains, flat as far as I've ever seen." She moves closer to Ramar and says softly, "You know, even Roleyn isn't this flat."

"A place in which you can sit, apart from the troubles and worries of your mind. A place in which you are more than you believe you could be." Ramar chuckles, "And Roleyn, from what I recall you telling me, has soft grass, perfect for lying in."

"If you want soft grass, I think.." Gallius looks out over the flatness and for a moment, everything fades, then gives way once more to being a plain, but not so flat. The ground is suddenly covered with the soft grasses of Gallius' home. "So.. is this better?"

"It is a start. But will you remember this when you wake up?" The three that have come with Ramar now begin walking through the grass. And as they tread it is made infinitely more real, from the way each individual blade sways with a barely felt breeze, to the sound of the grass crunching beneath bare feet. Ramar then asks Gallius, "Is your mind solely Roleyn? What else do you dream of, troubling or not?"

"I don't dream of much of anything," says Gallius. "Unless you mean what I wish for, anyway. You will have to be more clear, else I'll never quite understand. It's nice, though, being here with you, even if it's a bit odd."

"I mean to say both. What you wish is merely some form of expression of a dream. I do not simply mean... what you think about at night, though this too may be something. It is hard to explain, though I shall try my best." Ramar smiles at Gallius' words, and this elicits a knowing look from the other three...

Gallius tilts her head and looks at Ramar. "So, this is all a dream, right? Are you really here, or just my imagination, though? How could you actually be here, though? But if you aren't here, are these others really the other spark-holders?"

Ramar considers this. "I am not sure. Perhaps it is you who are merely a product of my imagination..." Ramar looks rather thoughtful. "I know that my mind is wandering far, perhaps I have wandered into your dreams? Or perhaps you are dreaming of the place I am wandering..."

"Well, we are here," says Gallius. "Kinda odd that you brought an entourage, though." She laughs softly and sets herself down on the grass, stretching along it. "Warm as I remember," she declares, allowing herself a mischievous grin.

Ramar nods, "Although I am not certain I have brought them with me." He sits down on the grass beside Gallius, "Is it? Well then, I am glad. It is as real to you as it would be elsewhere..."

"It's real enough," says Gallius. She grins suddenly, "So, you have me all to yourself in my dreams." She notices the others then and laughs, "Well, all to your selves."

"Well they are as much me, as I am them." Ramar shakes his head ponderously, "It is interesting, for though we have all carried the same spark, we are not at all one and the same." He leans nearer Gallius, "But here I am focusing on that when there is soft grass to sit upon. What do you think of those who have come before, aside from the fact that they are too strong?"

"I don't know," says Gallius. "They aren't me, and I'd just as soon keep my distance. Their dreams are not mine. They did many things, I suppose, but many things they did were also bad. One of them married that Ma.. no, I don't want to say his name. That ancient lunar with the manners of a goat. Yes, that's him."

"This is true..." Ramar then turns to his companions, "Why is it you are here then?" "While we may not be you, and while our path is no longer yours... we offer our counsel. Our lessons. Through us your path may gain some speed." Ramar then turns to Gallius, "What will you do about those mistakes in the past, Lady Gallius?"

Ramar says, "If indeed they are mistakes..."

"I don't know yet," says Gallius. "I think I'm going to make some mistakes, but I'm not really that worried of them, I guess. I've felt and heard some things from the past. I just don't relish it. The emotions are strong and they can overwhelm me. I don't want to share myself in that way with people who held my spark in the past."

"Is there anyone with whom you would share yourself in that way?" Ramar stretches out, "This grass is nice... but there ought to be a little more around here. A seed of a dream... yes, I shall give you that. If indeed I am wandering, and you are real."

"With someone I love," says Gallius. "You know, stalking the dreams of a woman is quite serious. You must be very interested in me, hmm?" She can't help but tease, even here. "Since you are so set on pretending you aren't here just to flirt with me, maybe you should tell me what these guys have taught you."

"Very well, if you are so intent on hearing..." Ramar and his companions are now seated in a circle, around a lazy campfire that is in front of Gallius. "I have learned the lessons they have to teach, I have learned of their paths through life when they still lived... and how they differ from my own. I have learned from them to realize who it is I truly am, and from their experiences, I find wisdom in my own."

"That's good for you, then," says Gallius. She grins widely and stretches out on the ground lazily, looking very much like a cat. "Mmmm, it's nice and warm. You really don't need a fire here. It's not like it's that cold in Roleyn this time of year."

"I know, but the archetype of relating a story around a campfire is a strong one in my mind. I believe it has taken root from my days in the desert..." Ramar leans back, and looks up at the sky. "Are we in Roleyn, Lady Gallius?"

"We are in the next best thing," says Gallius. "In a way, this is better, because there's no way it'll rain, and there's no way a fly will buzz around here. And there will be no interloping relatives or servants or advisors." She smiles widely, "Yes, this is pretty good."

There's a soft chuckle from Ramar as he stretches back, eyes looking rather dreamily skywards. The three that make up his entourage have begun walking along the grass, their footsteps glowing softly. "It is. Lady Gallius... are there many trees in Roleyn?"

"In certain areas," says Gallius. "We're away from them, though. I like the plains more than the trees. No roots to dig in your back. But no shade from them, either." Of course, there's no normal sunlight here, which makes that unnecessary. "But that's life. The good with the bad."

"This is true." Ramar sighs peacefully. "What goes on in the world around you Lady Gallius? What has you sleeping so restfully that you have enough time to dream of me..."

"Well, you saw what I usually dream about," says Gallius. "Nothing. I think you are the one who has time to barge in. And here you have me thinking of warm grass and soft winds and Roleyn." She sighs softly, "I wonder when I'll ever go back, anyway?"

"I will help you find the time to return to Roleyn, if you so wish it..." He then sits up, and looks about. "This is a nice Dream, Lady Gallius, thank you for sharing it with me."

"I will probably remember it," says Gallius. "I wonder, though, will you remember it, too? That'd be interesting, if we both know about this when we wake up."

"If it is important enough for me to have dreams of barging in your dreams, I shall likely remember it." Ramar chuckles, "After all it's not every day I find myself having the Lady of Roleyn all to myself on the soft grass..."

"Well, now that you have her, what are you going to do, hmm?" asks Gallius. She rolls onto her side and considers Ramar curiously. "You know, this is very strange, being here together. I think it really is you, too."

"I believe I am going to teach her to dream." Ramar smiles softly, then looks at Gallius, "Why is it that you believe I really am me, out of curiosity, mind you..."

"Because I don't think I could copy you like this," says Gallius. "It feels like the real you, and my dreams usually feel very.. fake, I guess. This seems real, somehow. Even the others seem real."

"Well that's always nice to know," replies the jester. Where the three have taken up spots to stand, the grass seems to grow a little greener, and a little taller. Ramar looks ponderously at Gallius, then muses, "Perhaps this is all too real, perhaps you have called me through your dreams... or I have found you. I am not certain."

"Whatever happened, happened," says Gallius. She grins at the jester and shrugs. "You are a little bit strange, I'm not sure we'd get on all that well. I don't think you'd like me much." She looks then to the lady, "I think I like you, but I haven't had much time to find out."

A cool shadow has passed over Gallius and Ramar as they find themselves dreaming together. The grass seems a little lusher, particularly near Ramar's body. He stretches towards the blank and empty sky. "You know Lady..." He chuckles, "Your mind is beautiful... full of possibilities... but it is also barren. May I show you something?"

"If you can cause it to grow here," says Gallius, "You may show me." She lets out a soft sigh and shut her eyes, "This place is nothing but potential, after all."

Ramar smiles. "And what are we all if not potential? Destiny and Fate are merely expressions of our Potential, Lady Gallius." He turns towards the Lady of Roleyn and holds out a hand, grey eyes shining softly. "Take my hand and walk with me."

Gallius reaches out to take Ramar's hand. She does not move to get up, but simply is up, the motion lost in her dream. "Lead me where you will, then," she says.

Then Ramar walks. The grass at first seems to be all there is. Soft, cool, dew-tipped blades of grass, whose scent now grows stronger. The grass crunches and folds beneath the feet of the Solars. The horizon nears. And it is apparent now that the endless plane of grass was stretched and spread atop a flat hilltop. A crystal clear river slices it's way through the land now, winding around Gallius and Ramar as they wade through it. The gentle rush of the water as it clears the edge of the hill and falls down into the river beneath it, seems to fill the air. Ramar breathes.

Gallius stares over this changed land and studies the water and the scent of grass and water as if they were new things to her. She exhales and smiles, bathing in the light of the sun. "What else have you changed?" she asks softly.

"I have changed nothing, Lady Gallius. Merely Dreamed." Ramar's voice is soft and airy, sounding almost as though he were speaking from far away. The barren grey cloud that served as the sky now parts, and sunlight warms the ground. They near the edge of the hill, where the water falls into the river. The river below stretches for miles, knifing through the gentle lands until it flows into a vast forest. A desert plains edges one corner of sight, and the lonely ocean another. Straight ahead though, looming out impossibly far, is a towering mountain. A golden and white light burns at it's top. "Our path does not take us to that point. That point is for me, and for me alone. It is where I am, even now." The three that accompany Ramar and Gallius bow respectfully towards the Dreamer on the Mountain. "Not even they may reach me there."

Gallius looks at the far mountain and hmms. "That point is for you alone? Then why is it in my dream?" she asks curiously. "It would seem that all this land should be mine."

"I am showing you the path to a point in my dreams, Lady Gallius." Ramar smiles shyly, murmuring this next point, "It is up to you to find your own high point within yourself. I had hoped it might inspire you if you'd seen mine. Perhaps convince you of the importance of your own dreams..." at this he gestures to the surrounding lands. "There are many paths through Dreams. Some of them meet and mingle in certain points, it is said."

"Perhaps this whole land is my place," says Gallius. "But because of who I am and what I desire, I know that I shall have no refuge, no place to be alone. I wish to be Queen of a great nation, leading all the lands to work together as they should. If so, all places are mine, but in no place am I alone. I will always be open to the words of my people."

"It may be so Lady Gallius. I do not know your dreams. Not yet. I am beginning to learn more of mine. And of the world. I have seen much during my wandering these past few months, though I have not left the place my body rests." Ramar chuckles an odd little chuckle. "From the highest point, you can hear the words of your people. And there, they know you are wise, and that you are good. It is a place of the self. If you believe in such a thing."

"I do not know what to believe in," says Gallius. "Save myself and my friends. I will do what is good for the world, though the road will be hard. I will not waver, for if creation is not united, the deathlords or the fair folk shall destroy all life."

"That is all that counts, Lady Gallius. So long as you know what is right for you." Ramar walks a little closer, perhaps more than necessary. "Your road may be hard, but our Circle shall walk it with you for as long as we will." He ponders something silently for a moment, as a fish swims past the pair as they stand together. He digs a hand in the nearby dirt, pulling up a handful of soil and a seed. "Here. Grow this. And perhaps you will remember this."

Gallius takes the earth in her hands and hmms thoughtfully. "You wish for me to show you what I shall grow in my garden, which shall span all creation?" she asks softly.

Ramar considers this request. "I am merely curious, Lady Gallius. I was wondering what you might grow here, but now that you bring this up, my curiosity is piqued even more." He laughs, "In other words, yes."

Gallius looks at the soil in her hand and holds it up where the light of the sun can strike it directly. "Grow, my garden. Let the winds plant you!" And there is a sudden gust, and the soil and seeds in her hand are scattered and drawn into the bosom of the sky. In all directions each speck of dirt is settled, and the seeds carefully lowered onto the earth.

And from each spawns a green shoot that bursts towards the sky, and under the blossoming branches the earth puts forth buildings of wood and stone, joined with perfect roads of some glistening substance. The voices of birds are heard in the trees, and the barren plains give way to ordered crops in many places, and in others the land still rules itself, and forests and deserts span between marvelous cities, each an oasis for weary men to rest between journeys that probe the wonders of creation.

And out and out it goes, a mix of green things that grow and stone and wood and people and the creatures of the world, all living in tune with the very pulse of Gaia's creation. Gally remains where she is, but she wears a robe over a sleek armor, and on her head her caste mark burns as sign of her royalty. "This is the kingdom I shall forge."

"It is beautiful Lady Gallius. I can see the land growing ordered in some places, and growing wild in others... as it should be." Ramar looks about, amazed. "And yet before all this... your dreams so empty? I find it hard to believe..." He smiles, softly, looking around.

Gallius looks down in her hand and leans down. Carefully she draws out the last seed of all and guides it into the earth. This time a smaller plant sprouts up, a rose bush where no two blossoms bear the same color, but instead form a complete spectrum of shades mingling freely. "And this shall stand as a reminder of all that creation is meant to be."

Ramar leans down over the rose bushes, watching Creation blossom in moments. "And as a reminder of all that it could be..." He reaches out and a bloom is in his hand. He sniffs it, pauses thoughtfully, then twines it within Gallius' hair. "There. To remind you that you too are as much a part of Creation as anything else."

Gallius smiles and hmms thoughtfully. "You are a very gentle dreamer, Ramar," she says warmly. "But I wonder, do you put flowers in every girl's hair when the chance arises?" Her tone is a teasing one, and she keeps smiling.

Ramar teases right back, "Well that all depends on whether or not they dream about me..." He smiles softly, and glances around, thoughtfully. "It has brightened in here."

Gallius grins and moves just a little closer to Ramar. Her eyes glint mischievously and she meets his eyes. "So.. you have seen my garden, and I've seen the place where you will let no one else go. But you are in a place where I don't normally let people go, yourself."

Ramar ponders Gallius curiously. "Perhaps then..." He smiles innocently, "You might ask something of me in return... I thank you for showing me this place..."

Gallius hmms and for a long time just smiles. "I suppose I should ask for something worthy of that. I won't ask to see what you keep to yourself, but.. perhaps I might ask for something else. A gesture, maybe." The lady laughs softly, "The Queen of the Nation of the Sun asks but one thing of her loyal subject Ramar, and that is for a kiss." She can't help but grin triumphantly at her own curious request.

"It is not that I keep it to myself... it's that the place is mys-" Although as Ramar listens to the Queen of the Nation of the Sun's request, he finds himself at a loss for words. An embarassed smile crosses his face, and at last he finds words again. "I do not believe I would refuse, even if I could. I would ask though... what sort of kiss?"

Gallius laughs a little bit and answers, "The sort of kiss you want to give me." And now it is the lady's turn to be evasive. "It will let me know how you feel better than any clumsy word might, will it not?"

Drawing upon the lessons he's learned from the Master, Ramar replies skillfully, and elegeantly. "Perhaps." He grins roguishly, then draws a breath for a thoughtful moment. "You are ready?" Ramar seems intent on drawing this moment out as long as he possibly can.

Gallius lets her eyes slip shut and nods just slightly. She draws in a deep breath and smiles. "I'm very ready," she murmurs.

"Then if you are sure..." Ramar tilts his head curiously as Gallius lets her eyes slip shut. "Why have you closed your eyes, I wonder?" Before she can answer though, he will grant the Queen her request. A kiss, one worthy of building a dream upon. He'll even go as far as to embrace the Lady, if only for the moment. But how long a moment it may seem... an eternity in and of itself. "You have such interesting dreams, Lady Gallius."

By the end of the kiss, Gallius is a bit less sure of her footing, and she leans against Ramar, not letting him slip away so easily. "It seems they are interesting tonight, at least. But if you are just part of my dream, you will not know anything of this." She sighs softly and smiles, "Still, it was a very good dream."

Apparently Ramar is utterly unable to slip away from Gallius. He smiles, "I suppose so. Maybe we are all mere parts of someone's dream. I agree though, this dream is a very good one, as far as dreams go."

Gallius lets out a faint sigh and makes a very brief but distinct purring sound. "I suppose I should wake up soon," she whispers. "But someday, when this dream is real in the waking world, we will stand in this place and just relax for many seasons."

"If you must," Ramar smiles a shy smile, "I hope though that your dreams may be real in the waking world sooner, rather than later. Although I imagine if we were here... we'd have to... relax... with one another."

Gallius grins and nods, "Of course. But this night is ending, and another day awaits. I hope you know of this in the waking world. Else I will have to tease you again." She pauses for a moment and then adds more seriously, "I am glad you visited my dreams, Ramar. I will see you in the waking world."

Ramar smiles. "Of course. I shall face my day. My wanderings call to me, and my guests are travelling far already. I must find where they will lead me." He pauses though, standing near Gallius. Very near. "Here's to hoping that we both remember the dream. Thank you for dreaming it. But... before I go..." Ramar leaves Gallius with one last kiss, just before he turns and leaves, and the sky and the world shift, and Gallius' tent now forms reality. Although there's a petal drifting in from above, floating down on a light wind.
