# Gods of Eden 2004-04-07

The black shape resolves itself into detail, and the Solars can see what it is - a sky-ship like theirs, painted black as night. On the foredeck are six figures, each attired in their own fashion. A moment's examination reveals the true nature of the attackers who smashed the Solar airship into splinters. They are the Dragon-Blooded, scions of the Realm, but they are something more. The professional warriors who seek and destroy the Anathema: the Wyld Hunt.

They are led by a squat, massively-muscled man with long black hair, wearing ornately-crafted armor of yellow jade. He wields a blade as tall as he is, and easily a foot wide, also of yellow jade. Next to him is a sharp-eyed man clad in white, with a shock of white hair, twin revolvers in holsters and a belt of ammunition across his chest. A bobbing flame or will-o-wisp floats beside him. A smirking woman, very short and lightly-built, with short black hair and an ornate gem set into a circlet on her brow, stands beside the two men. She wears a light cape cut and styled to resemble feathered bird's wings and has an assortment of knives.

Set apart from this trio, and forming their own group, are three men and women wearing the distinctive robes of the Immaculate Order. Their heads are likewise shaved clean. A thin bald woman with triple blue lines painted on the left side of her face, wearing blue monk's robes and carrying a Powerbow of the same color. Another woman, wearing green robes and sporting an ornate dragon tattoo on the right side of her head and neck stands with her. They are joined by a muscular, arrogant-looking man in black monk's robes, wearing tiger claws.

Water bursts into a blossom as Chi-Yosh gasps for air, then he is hand over hand towards the shore. Fortunate for he, the sailor had made the fall, and like any good sailor, knows his way within as well as on top of the water. The Solar comes ashore, panting, and one look towards the amassed Dragon-Blooded strikes a cord within him. Running along the shore towards his comrads, the cold rush of exhiliration and anticipation runs through his system, chased by the rolling tide of Essence, suffusing his body with the fluidity of grass in the wind. They wish a battle. So be it.

Chi-Yosh, coming to stop beside the Circle, glances over the debris of their ship, now driftwood within the lake. Then gazing towards the Dragon-Blooded on their ship, he calls forth with a grim smile. "There are more polite ways to say hello."

"You cannot run from us, Anathema," announces the armored knight, boldly. "If you stay and fight, we'll permit you time to prepare yourselves to meet your end." Soft glows of ambient Essence begin to flicker around the six as they draw on the power of magic.

Gallius alights on the ground, bouncing off a parried branch and whirling about. As she turns she bursts into a golden light and again draws essence to her to lighten her weapon against the coming of her foe's attacks. As a final touch, she surges power into those allies about her, forcing fate to smile upon them. To the guards she says simply, "Get away from here and prepare a shelter."

Davron narrows his eyes at the foes ranged against him. "Anathema indeed," he shouts. "You hold to old stories too long. May your wisdom be greater in your next lives!" he calls, and his voice shades into the ringing cadence of spellcasting, as he draws the pattern of one of the oldest sorceries in Creation, hardening his flesh against the assault to follow.

Chi-Yosh gathers his Essence, filling his center with the great ball of power, and lets it flow outwards to define itself. Reflex. Let the slings and arrows of the enemy not touch him. Strenght. The wind kicks up, grabbing at wet hair as his body ripples beneath the unleashed power. Guide his weapon with the Might of the Sun behind it. Muscles bulge as motes spark across them. Dexterity. The broken path shall not hinder he. The density of his form eases. Above him the crashing golden waves and swirls of Essence is a herald, as the eldrich sapphron churns across him.

With one smooth motion, Ramar is standing on his feet and his sword is unsheathed in his hand. The case clatters to the ground as he slices at the air. _Cut away the bonds of ignorance, find yourself flowing through Creation..._ With each slash, with each movement of his body, he begins to move in a fluid, almost dreamlike manner as the bitter wind howls around him. After one last whirling slice, his sword is swung behind his head, tip angled above the hand that is stretched towards the ship. With a perfectly calm expression on his face, he regards his new foes. "Come then, and learn what you will. Perhaps it shall do you good in the hereafter." He then curls his fingers, beckoning the Hunters closer. _May the Sun shine upon all of us._

Six ropes, braided of yeddim-hair and thickly twined, are tossed over the side of the sky-ship. Six Dragon-Blooded rappel downward. Six pairs of feet, booted or bare, land on the cold stone of the highland. The ropes are immediately cut by some unseen source, and coil downward into loose stacks on the ground next to the Hunters. "The skin of Bronze, Maiel," murmurs the stark-white gunman, asiding to his companion in her bird-feathered cloak. "Don't bother."

The two female monks take up defensive postures, guiding themselves in the graceful stances of their Dragon. The arrogant man in black flexes his fingers inside their tiger-claws, and begins walking forward toward the party. He is joined by the stout, stocky knight in his jade plate-armor.

Gallius charges in like a bobbing star, closing the distance between herself and the monk. She wastes no time with words. They are enemies and must be killed for the safety of her people. Her first attack is aimed to press her foe back against a pile of the airship's remnants, and the next will come when Gallius leaps from a protruding board, using it like a spring.

Gallius' swing draws the first blood of the battle, but it is her coming that strikes far more fear into her enemy. The monk readies a strike, but instead recoils, the fear of the sun clear in his eyes. Gallius stands ready, her eyes locked on his, and above her a lion of radiant light roars its challenge to these lesser chosen.

The redoubtable knight is less easily quailed, even by the brilliant displays of his hereditary foes. His great Daiklave's yellow-jade edge moves with the slow, unstoppable grace of the grinding mountain ranges, erupting with power like a volcano at the end of its swing.

The strength of her enemy's attack comes like a whistling wind, but Gallius wheels her weapon around in a glittering arc, her legs stretching out to brace her with debris against the ferocity of the dragon-blooded attack.

A burst of speed brings Chi-Yosh towards Gallius, seeing her in the thick of battle. Even though her aura is frightening and powerful, it will not save her from the sheer might of the Earht Knight's swing. Leaping over her, the Su'Katan tucks the kamas close and churns, lining his hip with the blade to slam into the Water monk. Touching down, two quick, percise slashes follow, lining his back up to the Earth knight.

The monk waits, and waits, as his form ripples and shimmers with Water Essence. The blows are absorbed into the depths of his soul, and only a slight grimace passes his features as Chi-Yosh's attacks are completed. "Novice," he observes, with the stern mein of a disapproving teacher.

Even as the two Wyld Hunt warriors stride forward and the Lion of the Sun lashes out against them, Davron is running at an angle, back toward the trees, vaulting to the top of a boulder nearly as tall as he his. He turns on one foot, and looses two arrows at the caped Dragon-Blood, before taking another step back to drop lightly behind the rock.

The feathered cloak expands like a bird's wings, and closes around the haughty knife-thrower's body as a shield. Still, two arrows pierce her defenses, and she grimaces in pain, staggering a bit.

Meanwhile, the green-robed woman sprints forward, approaching her black-clad companion. She reaches out in passing, caressing him with a light touch, and wincing a bit as the injuries dealt him pass over onto her body. The man bearing twin revolvers draws his weapons from their holsters, and as the man in black ducks, he opens fire at Chi-Yosh.

Chi-Yosh dives forward over the ducking Water monk, and rolls to his feet to dive aside, around the Earth Knight. The bullets snap the air like wood in a fire, and one slashes across his lower back as he weaves between the Dragon-Blooded.

The trees sway back and forth, conferring amongst themselves, one of the tall slender trees in particular takes notice of the Solar running along the length of it's trunk until he's grabbed hold of a branch. With a quick stroke, pinecones still nestled in the tree are sent towards the archer and the feathered-woman. He flashes them a grin from atop a particularly slender branch. "Well ladies... shall we dance?"

Gallius readies for another round, ducking amidst the wreckage and racing her way at the jade armored knight, swinging a strike first as she darts past, and then running up the remnants of the shattered hull where she kicks off and leaping, turns in the air to come down at him from directly above, her naginata a sun-lit spike stabbing at his throat.

Feeling the blood of the first strike only makes Gallius hungrier, and when again she slices the flesh of her adversary, her anima's claws glow brighter, and its jaws open, eager for the kill.

As Gallius leaps from the wreckage, Chi-Yosh comes around the Earth Knight like a whirlwind; a forward jump brings twin slashes like a scissor at the Water monk's neck. He throws himself backwards into a roll, coming up with two quick slashes across the Earth Knight as he pushes past, deft feet dancing over the wreckage and away, to turn and beckon the monks after him.

Undeterred by the paired kamas striking his body, the black monk flexes his burly muscles, and waits for Chi-Yosh's body to spin past him. Strong arms grab hold of the Solar's upper arms, and meaty hands converge behind his back in a painful hammer-lock.

Davron emerges from behind the boulder, just in time to see Chi-Yosh pinned down by the black-robed Hunter. "Heretics! May Helios burn you down where you stand!" he roars with rage, and abandons his cover to stride swiftly forward, his bow singing as two needle-sharp arrows fly out. His bonfire of Essence flares into the image of the Hawk, and its talons lash at the flying shafts, kindling them into flame as they scream through the chill air.

The black-clad monk staggers, as Solar-sharpened arrows pierce his back and side. "What.. not yet..." he gurgles, staggering to his knees and collapsing. Chi-Yosh is free of his grasp.

The trio of ranged-weapon users in the background step up, now that their target has revealed himself from his cover. The monk-archer swiftly nocks and fires, sending an arrow streaking on the four winds towards Davron's position and swirling with Essence. Behind her, the gunman has holstered his weapons and is droning the sacred syllables of a magical incantation.

As soon as Ramar spots the arrow flying towards his companion below, Ramar drops from the tree. As the four winds that bear the arrow towards his companion start to toss leaves and wayward dust in the air, Ramar lands, legs sweeping as soon as he does to help Davron flow away from the swift winds. Before the Bronze-skinned solar can clang against the rocky ground, Ramar flips up on one hand, and catches Davron with his legs, and swings them forward propping him back upright. "Careful!"

Undaunted, the knife-artist spreads her "wings", and Essence swirls about her. Eight razor-sharp pinions streak outward from her cloak, materializing in motion, and streak toward the swordsman who intercepted the arrow.

As soon as the wings have spread, Ramar has sprung into motion. His feet are planted on the boulder, and carry him two steps up the side. He pushes off just as razor sharp feathered death streaks past, sinking into the boulder moments after Ramar's foot left. In mid-air the Solar twists, as he can hear two more whistling towards him. His foot touches the tip of one, just enough so that he might push upwards. He flips back towards the ground, sending rocks skidding as he holds a hand out to one side, watching as the feather flows through his dreamlike body.

Only two of the rain of deadly feathers have managed to catch Ramar. And even they only draw small pinpricks of blood that form around his shirt, at the edges of his armor. He glances towards the Feathered-Woman, "Eh... that was... adequate."

The armored bastion re-orients his massive weapon, growling and intent on avenging the fall of his black-cloaked brother in arms. The hiss of air rushing away from the mass of his Essence-permeated jade weapon sends a hot breeze over Chi-Yosh's face as the sword sweeps at him in three strokes of an imaginary triangle.

Chi-Yosh senses the avalanche coming. He can't out run it, but he can move, and the Su'Katan darts to the side. Fear may give men wings, but desperation gives them cunning. Fingers dig into the downed rigging of the ship as the sword swings. Back contorting, the Dawn wrenches up a web of ropes, sale and chunks of the mast, hurling it up like a shield in the knight's path while he dives beneath, aiming between the Earth's pilars.

Seeing her foe move his attention like the coward he is, Gallius darts in growling. "Cowards, you and the worms you serve crawl on your bellies. You will all bow before the servants of sun." She leaps in the path of the enemies Daiklave and hisses as her naginata whirls to catch it. Locking eyes with her enemy she whispers, "I'm sending you to oblivion next, you little bastard."

Even the bold stroke of his fellow Solar was not enough to abate the fate that lay in store for Chi-Yosh, resting on the edge of that five-foot blade. A terrible gash is torn open on his arm and torso, and the knight in jade scowls disdainfully at Gallius. "The serpent's tongue is ever loaded with scorn," he growls in his deep voice. Behind him, the woman in green kneels quickly, striking her fallen friend in black with two fingers, and makes a quick pattern across seven vital nerve clusters. With a gasp his breathing returns, though he remains unconscious.

Drawing in a deep breath, Ramar takes off like a shot across the battlefield, leaving a faint shadowy trail of Essence behind him as he settles into an offensive stance. He has the tip of his sword pointed at the Gunman...

Seeing nothing but two alternatives, Gallius knows she must either defeat her opponent now, or die. No longer thinking of the now, the mind of every spark rages in hers and with a deafening roar she hurls herself at the knight in front of her, wanting nothing but his blood, yearning at this moment more to see his death than to see the next day come. Each scything swing throws debris up as essence suffuses her strikes.

Once, twice, a third time, the lioness leaping from board to broken barrel to part of mast to vault over her foe and come crashing down behind him in a flip that rockets her spear at the back of his neck even as her feet are overhead, spinning towards the earth.

The yellow jade blade arcs through the air, catching a shaft of sunlight that peeks through the clouds. The ray of sun seems to burn itself into the blade as it plummets, as though the light itself were forcing the potent weapon into the icy depths. The stocky knight catches two follow-up attacks with expertly-thrown hand parries, but his true strength is gone and Gallius' weapon clangs twice on his ornate armor.

The green-clad woman scoops up her unconscious friend, trotting as best she can carrying his weight. The unconscious black monk stirs atop her shoulders, still resting uneasily in the arms of Sleep while its cousin Death eyes him with envy.

Chi-Yosh, hurt, bleeding, near death, one thing rings true into the Su'Katan's mind: ensure victory for his friends. He could be struck down any moment, but the longer they wait, the more attacks shall come. If he will meet his God, it will be in the moments of glory. The Dawn turns and with the swiftness of the wind, charges towards Maiel. He dances across the rocky ground towards her, seemingly unaware of the bow wielder. His last steps come with a pounce, and like a tiger sensing its' doom, he unleashes with all of his fury. High and low, pinching like a crab and stabbing with brutal efficency, his crocked claws are every where she moves.

The white-haired warrior's magic concludes, and a whirling, buzzing sound begins to fill the air. A glittering array of razor-sharp edges is formed out of magic in an eyeblink, and it streaks upward into the air and darts toward the distant Davron, whirring and humming with its merry message of death.

Davron, still staggering slightly from the arrow wedged into his chainmail, has scant seconds to react as the Essence coalesces into whirling blades flying at him with terrible force. Realizing that he must evade the whirling doom or die trying, he lunges backward into a handstand, his archer's arms bunching beneath him, then launching his form into the air, and toward the boulder he'd hidden behind earlier. He somersaults in midair, his feet toward the rock, then as the blades hum toward him, he kicks off with all his might, Essence blazing around him, the glowing lavender hawk's wings searing the sky.

The hurtling archer is fast, but not quite fast enough. The Guillotine careens past him, only the last blade of the chain gouging into his neck. Sorcery pits itself against sorcery, and the conjured metal bites through the bronze skin of Davron's throat, crimson blood welling from a gash that misses his jugular vein by only scant millimeters. Davron rolls to the ground, clapping his hand to his neck with a quiet clang as he stumbles to his feet.

"So you probably have the Virtuous Guardian of Flame..." Remarks Ramar to the Gunman, as he dashes forward. His blade flashes out, testing the flaming guardian, the weapon gaining a slight glow in the flurrying exchange of attack and parry. He pauses a moment, and with a grin says, "Although... for your choice in weaponry... that has one distinct flaw..." He then leaps forward in earnest, kicking out with one leg as he whirls around, bringing his blade up against the rocky ground, sending a spray of sparks flying towards him as he swings the tip of his blade in a spiral past the flames, and stabs the gun man's ammo belt. With another flick of the wrist he's got it looped around the edge of his sword and he's yanking it back into the sorcerer's own defense! As the ammunition begins to ignite, Ramar elaborates, "Fire and bullets do not mix well under most circumstances."

The spirits of fire, so long denied, leap hungrily and greedily to the craft of the mighty god Autochthon's mechanical hand. The ammo-belt explodes in a shower of flame and Essence, singing both men badly and sending a cloud of thick-foul-smelling smoke skyward.

_Of course... fire and ammunition are also unable to discern between friend or foe when set off in this manner._ Ramar reminds himself of this should there ever be a next time, as his flesh is seared by the sheer heat of the long-denied flame... _I am never going to hear the end of this from the Lunars._

Both women flanking the gunfighter back away, frowning and revealing doubt. While the haughty thrower draws back, hurling a pair of knives toward Chi-Yosh, her companion decides to do likewise, and fires arrows in rapid succession at Ramar through the hazy cloud.

Hugging the air so close to Maiel, Chi-Yosh weaves around, keeping her distracted. As the air detonates behind him, leaving the two men partially reeling, the Su'Katan stands in the woman's line of sight. Knives come his way, born onto the air, and they are like dance partners, the Dawn weaving around them with fluid detail, hoping his twisting path will to put those blades on the path of the Blue robbed monk behind him.

Singed, pierced, and by no means quite up to full capabilities, Ramar turns to regard the arrows streakign his way. He leaps into the air, spinning sideways as the arrows streak towards him, and at the last moment he's up and over them. Landing agilely on his feet, sword extended towards the archer. "You're getting better. One day you may actually hit."

The tempo of combat slows somewhat, as the energy of the moment begins to fade and the wounds on Solar and Terrestrial alike begin to tell. Nevertheless the grim cold of the north will permit no stragglers or weaklings, and one by one, each combatant rises again to face the boundary between life and death that is so often observed here in this cold and unwelcome land.
