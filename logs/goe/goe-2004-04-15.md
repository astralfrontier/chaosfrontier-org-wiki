# Gods of Eden 2004-04-15

The unforgiving sand dunes of the desert stretch out as far as the eye can see. Like the Northern wastes the Solar Circle recently passed through, the South is inhospitable and inimicable to civilized man. Though its temperature extremes fall on the other end of the spectrum, life is just as harsh, and inattention to one's survival exacts the ultimate penalty. Eight thin rods of wood are planted in the sand here; thin white sheets of woven cotton, dyed in the colors of the desert and describing the heraldic crests of millennia-dead kingdoms, snap in the heavy winds that kick sand up over the dunes and send it smartingly into the eyes of those present.

Gallius is here, wearing nothing more than a thin, full-bodied wrap of spun cloth. Her armor and weapons are gone; her strength against the desert is the true challenge. Three other men and women stand with her. One is Tamuz, the chieftain of the Southernmost lands in which the trials are to take place. Another is Sand Spider, who has consented to observe the trials and bring news of them to his fellows. The third is a tall, brown-skinned woman with flowing black hair, dressed scantily in blue-dyed cloth as though daring the cruel sun overhead to do its worst to her skin. Her body's curves roll gently as the sand-dunes do, and her eyes are the sparkling blue of the oasis waters. She is Luluri, the No Moon who is formally administering the trial at Tamuz' behest.

Gallius faces the desert calmly. She has seen its like before, for this is much as the bitter north, with air that can steal the breath of a man and leave his skin shattered with dryness. And yet here and there things live. She studies those with her for a moment, and looks to Tamuz, "It is time to find out if I am ready," she says simply.

"There is a mountain to the south - a caldera," says Luluri, quietly. "Its name is the Earthshaker. Meet us at the peak of the mountain in three days' time, or you will fail this part of the trial. You have whatever you are, and whatever you can wrest from the desert." And nodding to her two companions, she turns, and the three take several steps before shifting and melding their forms into raptors. They streak away on the desert updrafts, taking to the sky and disappearing slowly.

Gallius examines what she has been given with care. The cloth she uses mostly to protect her skin from the light, and her eyes from the sand. She sees nothing to the south, but knows which way that is, at least. She has heard of the deserts from the Marukani, as well as other travellers, and she heeded their words well. She knows that the blazing sun is merciless and at night it shall turn to a bitter chill. She has no time to waste, however, and she will start making her way as best she can, keeping her mind sharp and her eyes open for any hint of plantlife.

Gallius will pause before going, looking at the rods. "Well, I can wrest these from the desert," she murmurs. And so she does, taking them all. At least now she will not be utterly unarmed against whatever might be waiting.

As Gallius goes, it is not her martial prowess that she recalls, but the lessons of her more distant cousins, who taught her how to hunt when she was just a woman trying to become a captain. She knows the ways of tracks, she learns how creatures move in the shifting dunes. She uses the length of the rods to hunt snakes, finding two make an excellent scissor trap of just enough length to avoid any unpleasant bites.

Gallius also knows that green things need water, and in needing water, they have water. She doesn't seek an oasis, but instead seeks the prickly growths of the desert. She knows if she can break these and consume them she will get all the water she needs to stay alive.

A day passes, and a night. On the dawn of the second day of the ordeal, Gallius' skin burns, and her throat is parched. The few cacti she's found have yielded little water. The sun, perhaps mindful of the hard challenge its priest has put herself to, burns down with especial intensity, adding fire to the air around her. The desert is the forge on which the Southern Lunars hammer themselves into the blades that will cut the Realm, and the sun shows no mercy to one of its own who seeks to face the same gauntlet.

In the distance, as she raises a hand to wipe stinging sand from her eyes, a cloud can be dimly seen, approaching at a slow pace. Even Gallius recognizes what it is: a sand-storm. It will be upon her soon, and she has little time and even less material to prepare with.

The sun Gallius faces without fear. It may burn, but to the heart of a Solar of the Zenith Caste, it holds no fear even as the air shimmers in the distance. It is the marred horizon that troubles her. Seeing little time to spare, Gallius begins to dig into the sand with her hands, throwing the fine stuff behind her carelessly in her haste. The cloth upon her is hastily removed, but the digging continues. The rattlesnake skin she has kept is also set aside for use in this project.

Hearing the whispers of the coming storm, Gallius takes three of the rods and binds them together using the hide of a rattlesnake. She grimaces at the crude shape, but doesn't have time for much else. She digs further, clawing down through the bitter sand until she finally strikes a bit of moisture, and then finally a tangible amount of water. Into this she thrusts the cloth, trying to soak it as best she can.

The cloth sucks up the water like a greedy sponge, and then Gallius takes the three bound rods and press them into the hole she has made. About this she starts to wrap the damp cloth, knowing that a wet fabric is far more likely to survive what is about to happen than a dry one. The other rods she places at angles in the sand. Two she keeps aside with the last bit of fabric she has. She sets this at an angle with the flow of the dune she is on. Even as she slips inside this small fortress she starts to refill part of the hole, entombing herself for the moment, but protecting herself against the bitterness of the sandstorm.

As the shelter covers, Gallius uses her last trick. She uses the last two rods to maintain something of a downward slanting shaft out of her chamber, allowing her to draw in air from the outside, suck through the last scrap of cloth to keep the sand from her mouth.

The sandstorm blows, whistling with rage as the desert-spirit whirls over the top of the war-leader's hideout. The fierceness is greater than any army; the punishment is worse than any arms forged by man. Gallius waits, and waits, the sand burning into her bones, and finally the storm withdraws, streaking northeast on its endless quest. Gallius rises, dusting herself off and shaking her head free of sand as she collects her rods. And at that moment, a dozen other figures rise from the desert as well, encircling her. They are scaly-skinned lizard-beings, the strange products of the Wyld's near proximity, and their claws flex as beady black eyes survey a new source of nourishment.

Drawing herself out into the bitter desert air, the last thing Gallius wants is to waste time beating something to death. She shakes her head and even as the aura of the sun bursts about her as a bright reflection of the sun, she says simply, "You can run now." The creatures hesitate for a moment, but when the lady raises two of the rods, they dart away, seeking less terrible prey. Gallius carefully gathers up all of her materials. She has taken the time to again wet all the cloth and then she wraps them about her once more after sating her thirst as best she can.

---

Dawn comes on the third day of travel; the time will be up when the sun sets. Gallius can see a line of mountains stretching across the south. They are low, and pointy; some are visibly volcanoes, of black stone. Here and there, shimmers atop the ridges indicate the encroachment of the Wyld, while others reveal plumes of steam indicating some sort of activity. The desert sands are giving way to rocky steppes.

Gallius frowns in thought. Every single volcano could be her target. The name is of no use. Every single volcano is an earthshaker. They all seem about the same size. The Lunars have a knack for making these things tricky, though. Gallius will continue making her way, moving as fast as she can. Even if she knew which was the right one at this moment it would be no small task to arrive in time. Along the way, she keeps her eyes open for any ruins, or any signs of men living in this area, and all the while the desert sun bears down at her, trying to burn the life out of her.

Gallius pauses, seeing that she know has drawn close to her goal, and that it is a matter of guessing or knowing which is right. The guess is likely to fail, and she'll be damned if she's spent three days for nothing. She falls to one knee and gathers essence about her, letting her anima burst into a fierce light. Seizing a rod, she empowers it with essence and with a downward swing like a hammer she slams the essence-flooded weapon into the very earth.

Three or four pounds later, the swirling sands that lie above the stony steppes begin to converge, and the voice of a whistling wind blows from them. _Ahh, a visitor. I am awake._

"My name is Gallius Leom, Solar of the Zenith Caste," begins the Queen. "I have come far and now I seek but one thing, the Earthshaker. Tell me, force of the earth, which of these peaks is the one I seek?" The lady draws upon her essence, and despite her state, drained and tortured by heat, stained with sand, and wearing only torn and filthy rags, her regal bearing shows no blemish.

_I will guide you. Shed a drop of blood on the sand, and follow its guidance,_ directs the elemental.

Gallius nods to the elemental. She clenches her fist, digging nails into her palm until her skin is broken. Squeezing further, she lets falls a thick drop of blood. Gallius considers the falling blood and steels herself for the last lap. This, she imagines, will be the hardest of all.

The sands swirl as the blood strikes them, and the wind whips the crimson dot up into the air. Despite its small size, it glistens with remarkable visibility, and Gallius has no problem following its lead as she plunges across the steppes.

---

It is mid-afternoon as Gallius ascends the side of the Earthshaker, walking steadily despite the mild tremors that plague the volcano's northern face. The three Lunars are waiting near the peak, and all three incline their heads in welcome as she arrives.

Gallius nods deeply to the three Lunars, forcing her battered body to maintain its proud posture. She is weathered heavily now, cut in many places, her tongue swollen with thirst, but her mind still undaunted, for even as the sun was starving her body, it was flooding her spirit with more and more strength.

Luluri presses her palms together and bows. "The next trial will begin when we take off. You must reach the bottom of the volcano before it erupts, and its lava incinerates you. It will be erupting shortly. We will meet you at the bottom, if you survive."

The volcano's smooth stone is marred by jagged edges and thin slabs of stone; there is a glassy consistency to much of the rock, and a slickness of surface that made ascent difficult. Luluri indicates the peak of the Earthshaker. "It will erupt... now." And with that, the volcano seems to obey, trembling far more than it did during Gallius' ascent. The three Lunars again take to the sky, their bird's forms darting northward.

Gallius nods, and even as the earth steels any sense of stability, she works away. Seeing the Lunars fly off reminded her of stories she heard. Stories of travelers. While the mountain roars, she is carefully wrapping the cloth in bands from rod, then about her, then to the other rod. She'd laugh, if this hasty thought wasn't going to hold her fate completely.

The Queen takes the rods and measures the cloth's distance. The span is just right, her arms fully extended are left with just a bit of slack. Gathering what she has tight to her, she turns and sprints towards the most sheer of cliffs. In her wake the scalding heat of the earth follows, steady and unstoppable.

Gallius reaches the very verge and without a second thought, leaps from the precipice. Her arms swing wide, holding the top of each rod. Her feet move with them, hooking about the bottom of the rods. The wind billows, catching the cloth and the Queen of the Nation of the Sun flies on the strength of a cloth and some rods. She can only hope they are well crafted enough to bear this use.

The little craft wobbles and shakes, the materials composing it never intended to survive the treatment it's being put to now. Gallius skillfully steers the thing, and where she seems to be losing altitude too rapidly, she uses the heat of the lava flowing only several yards beneath her as an improvised updraft to regain the air. At last, though, her luck runs out - as she spots something swooping toward her. It's an enormous, scaly flying creature, like an enormous, web-winged raiton. Her improvised air-craft chooses that moment to snap into component sections, and the beast swoops rapidly toward her as she plummets, its maw wide and exposing row upon row of fangs.

Gallius feels air rushing by, but her mind is still moving swiftly, despite the danger. Her attacker is a gift from heaven, and she won't fail to make use of it. Twisting like a snake in the passing nothingness, the Queen swings out with a broken rod, trying to use the splintered end like a piton and her attacker like a cliff face. She shifts her aim, trying to avoid anything that might kill this beast quickly, and instead just create something of a handhold.

The beast screams in pain, but Gallius manages to grab a handhold. Blood oozes from the scaly skin and the puncture therein, and the creature flips this way and that, seeking to escape the torment the thin shaft of wood inflicts on it.

Using her successful strike to get a better seat on the beast, Gallius pivots on the spike and throws herself atop her flying foe. Even as it moves like an eel Gallius takes a strong hold with legs and arms, trying not just to keep astride this strange creature, but to gain something of a bit of control before the ground finally catches up with her.

The wounded scale-bird wings its way to the sandy rock of the plateau, while behind Gallius, the lava torrents of Earthshaker pour out onto the plain and cool themselves. The creature flops about a few times, then begins to shift shape. Tamuz lays where it did, a gash revealed in his shoulder. He rises unsteadily to his feet, shaking his head to clear it. Blood spills out in drops and streams onto the sand as he turns to regard the trial's questor.

Gallius moves away from Tamuz. She says nothing, but arches an eyebrow, wondering exactly what his presence means. She looks back at the volcano and shakes her head. "I did not think the Lunars interfered in the trials," she says simply.

"What I did was out of respect for you," answers Tamuz. "A newly Exalted Lunar is a fresh cub; if his spark finds a new home because he was careless or foolish, then we will train his successor. You are not a cub; you have faced greater dangers than these. You do not come here to prove to us that you are a survivor; you come here to prove to us that you respect us and our ways, Gallius. I honor your accomplishments by aiding you now."

Gallius offers a nod, "I cannot speak of us coming together if I do not honor those who might otherwise stand apart. I cannot lead unless I first serve. I am grateful for your aid." She turns away from the volcano then and asks, "Are the others waiting nearby, or do I have more searching to do?"

Tamuz replies by taking the form of an enormous stallion, a desert-bred horse with wide feet. He tosses his head, indicating for his fellow Exalt to mount his back.

Gallius vaults onto the back of Tamuz and muses over her tests up to this point. She's ate rattlesnake, faced a sandstorm, talked to an earth spirit, climbed a volcano, made a glider, and twice hitched a ride on a Lunar. And she's not even finished yet.

---

Tamuz guides his rider to a desert oasis, miles distant from Earthshaker. He resumes his human form as she dismounts, and inclines his head in the direction of Sand Spider and Luluri. The other elder smiles grimly, then flings something with a suddenness that dazzles Gallius. She feels a pricking in her left forefinger, and looks down. A thorn has embedded itself therein, and a hint of red is appearing in a ring around it. "The thorn is poisoned," Sand Spider explains. "Survive the poison and you will have passed the final test. Tamuz will not save you this time." He reaches to his belt and draws a knife, flipping the blade into his hands, then hurling it into the sand at Gallius' feet. "The oasis is dedicated to a potent spirit. The oasis and its god, that blade, and the flowers and herbs you will find therein are yours to use. Stay alive." There is no harshness, malice or note of victory in his voice; this is the mein of an elder seeking to test the mettle of an initiate, and nothing else

Gallius takes this quite easily. After all, what's a little poison after escaping the hungry maw of a mountain? Every step of this has been a battle against death. She will take the knife and begin quickly considering her options. She must survive the poison, so drawing it out is not allowed. It's a matter of endurance. She will make a quick survey of her surroundings. Flowers, plants, water, knife. That's a good start. Spirit.. that's the starting point.

Gallius will make her way into the water of the Oasis and try to call upon the spirit. She again calls upon her essence, igniting her caste mark and bowing her head into the water as she calls upon the spirit, "Come forth, cousin. Gallius of the Zenith Caste wishes to gain your wisdom!"

Time passes. Gallius can feel a strange, throbbing sensation in her finger. It spreads slowly down the digit; it'll be inside the hand, soon. The waters ripple at last, as the Lunar trio observe dispassionately. A shape emerges from the oasis, a watery form whose voice is the softness of water on the cheek, a light spray of mist that lightly tickles the ears with its quality. _Priest, here am I am here, priest,_ it whispers. _Answers give I give answers.._ The voice ripples, echoing backwards and forwards like waves on the surface of water.

"I have been poisoned, my cousin, by a bitter thorn," says Gallius. And here she holds up the thorn carefully. "Somewhere here is something that will help. Tell me what herb here can stand against such a poison and how it must be prepared." The priest frowns, feeling the poison spread into her hand. Soon she will have but one hand to use.

"Stop!" rings Sand Spider's voice, from behind Gallius. "You cannot simply ask it for help like that."

Gallius turns from the god to face Sand Spider, "Did you not say this god, these herbs and flowers, and this blade are mine to use?" She studies the elder closely, "Do you now choose to unsay what you have said, or have you sought to deceive me in this trial?"

Sand Spider smiles, revealing nigh-carnivorous teeth. "Good, good. Proceed." The spirit, sensing no opposition, continues. _Flowers blew over winds over blue flowers,_ it whispers. Gallius glances about, spotting a deep azure blossom near the edge of the water. _Drink shed blood in me in blood shed drink_

Gallius wastes no time, but moves to the flower. Of course, the help of this spirit isn't precisely specific. Yes, here is a blue flower. It can be assumed this flower is of use. But how? Should it be consumed, should she use it to staunch the wound? Gallius frowns and decides it has something to do with the 'drink shed blood' comment.

Of course, drinking a flower is absurd. Gallius will bite into the flower and swallow it down. "Drink shed blood in me.. in blood shed drink," murmurs Gallius. It's nothing but the ravings of a spirit, but it's all she has to go on. She bathes the small wound that remains in the water, then, hoping she's guessing something of what this cryptic spirit means.

The pool shimmers with activity as blood seeps into it. _Drink me drink_ commands the spirit. _Water for blood for water_

Gallius hmms thoughtfully. She presses her hands together and then drinks deep of the water in the oasis. There's nothing else to drink around here, and the spirit is of the oasis. What could 'me' be but the water?

_Good, drink more drink, good_ encourages the spirit. _Drink all drink_

Gallius continues to drink; more and more of her life's blood seeps out, staining the oasis red. She drinks and bleeds for what seems like forever, until the entire pool is deep with the crimson of her vitae. She rises from the pool's edge at last, looking at the angry wound on her finger. The bloodied ring is now a dark blue, and droplets of water drip out onto the poolside where once blood fell. Examining her scars, bumps and bruises from the grueling desert crossing, she can see the same thing - the red of her blood is absent from her injuries, and the pool's deep and abiding blue has replaced it. _Healed are you are healed,_ explains the spirit. _Within body helps herb helps body within._

Gallius lets out a soft sigh and bows deeply to the spirit, "Thank you, cousin. In time, I shall repay your kindness. People should honor your healing oasis." The Zenith caste considers this god for a time, then after a last bow turns away, facing the Lunars.

"I seemingly have survived," says Gallius simply. She looks around, feeling strangely refreshed, despite the terrible strain this day has put on her. Death has dangled in front of her so many times in such a short period. She mentally reviews this test and feels a small surge of pride. She has done as she wanted, relying not upon strength and martial prowess, but on her keenest weapon of all: her knowledge.

"You were right to confront me," says Sand Spider. "If someone tells you something, and you do it on their say-so, either you are a great fool or you respect their word. I doubt you value my commands more than your own life, and you acted rightly."

Gallius nods to Sand Spider. "I do not think my fate is to die yet," she says. "There are too many things left to do. And I would not fall here, before we could fight side by side at least once. I am eager to see what we can achieve together."

Luluri steps forward, holding up a hand. "This trial is ended. I recognize you, Gallius, with the rank of nain-ya among the Lunar who follow the Silver Way. This does not earn you respect within the Lunar fraternity, only a place. You must now make your own respect, your own Face, within the pact. However, we have neither the power nor the right to remove the renown which is already yours by dint of your deeds. Keep our ways, and we will do you honor."

The No Moon continues. "You show some aptitude for conjuring, and little in lore, but you are cunning. You are of the Changing Moon Caste." She steps forward, extending a claw from one finger, and begins ritually scratching a mark into Gallius' forehead.
