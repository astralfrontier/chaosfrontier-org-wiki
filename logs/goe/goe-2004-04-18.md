# Gods of Eden 2004-04-18

Gallius begins with a problem. How can she create a powerful force of warriors that can get to distant areas of a large realm swiftly and safely? Horses are fast, and would suit, except they are not fast enough for a large realm. Magical means are very interesting, but something constant and tangible means more to men.

She considers for a moment stories she has heard and what makes her strong. A trusty steed like Jin-nu would be ideal for her armies, but she is just one horse. Ironically, Gallius realizes that magical means might lead her to her more constant and tangible goal. If magic can blend men and beasts, surely it can bend the greatest parts of one beast with another. The lady decides that the only ones who can help her in this are the Lunars, and she knows one well that might be willing to aid her.

Gallius travels to the Marukani, knowing that they are the source of the greatest horses in all the land. Bartering for a fair price is straight-forward enough. These men know the name of Gallius Leom, and though the tail is a bit of a curiousity, it doesn't seem to shock them, given the tales they've heard. She buys four fine mares and a stud. She arranges for the horses to be delivered to Roleyn, where she goes to see how her own people are faring. And to tell her father what she has done.

"Though I thought you lost for a time, it seems you fulfilled your mission after all," says the King, sounding grave but relieved as he receives his daughter privately, away from the court. "The attacks expected from the south never materialized after all. And you have received new.. additions." His eyes wander to the strange new appendage adorning his precious flesh and blood for a moment, but return. "We will pay for the horses, of course. And whatever else you need."

"Thank you, father," says Gallius, curtseying deeply. "I am glad I had the time to come see you. The business of ruling a new nation leaves me little free time." She adds more quietly, "And this is far more stressful than any other crown, I have learned." And at this she taps her brow, where her father knows her caste mark lies.

The King nods. "Please say goodbye to your sister, before you leave. She needs to know how you are doing, and where you are going, so she can properly look after you."

Gallius nods gravely, "Indeed, I shall speak with her." For a moment she is unsure, but then she says, "I have seen her, though, since I left. She was doing very well. She is happy and as beautiful as ever."

Gallius' father smiles widely at this. "You have faced her, and I also will be able to face my ancestors proudly, because of you. Do all that you must."

"We are what we are because of you, father," says Gallius. "I owe you a great debt, and I am trying to repay it by living up to the honor that has been bestowed upon me." She smiles warmly and adds, "If you should ever come to the Hundred Kingdoms, you will be able to see what I have done with the help of my friends."

---

As requested, Gallius visits the grave of her sister. She dresses in the clothes of mourning and remembrance, and brings the gifts suitable for the dead from the living, as is custom. Some things cannot be neglected. And when this has been done, a thought steals over her. Her sister's guiding words, those that led her to the weapon which has stood with her through the time of her Exaltation.

"So again I should ride?" murmurs Gallius. Jin-nu's voice answers, "But not alone." The Lady turns to her friend and nods. "We have somewhere to go, if you wish to join me." The wylding nods her assent and Gallius and her steed charge off like a gale, seeking the place where the solar found her naginata.

The ride is not a short one. To Gallius it seems almost the same time of the first trip down this path, though that should not be possible. The entrance is hidden near a stone, and it is far from regal. The lady had stretched a strong net over the entrance and over it cast sod to conceal it from eyes. This she now draws away, revealing a very dark shaft that leads down into the bowels of the earth.

The shaft is a rather large one, and Gallius and Jin-nu may both enter, though it is not so tall that Gallius may ride. She uses essence to set her caste symbol aglow and shed light in this utter darkness. Runes are scrawled over the walls in some tongue that the Lady is not familiar with. After about a fifty foot drop there is a broad landing where there are three doors. The one straight ahead shows that it was opened not so long ago, as the dust there is far less thick. Gallius opens the portal and examines the stand in the next chamber that once held her weapon.

Much of the architecture here is regular, almost ritualized - from her new experiences in several Manses, Gallius can recognize that this was once the site of such a structure, positioned underground. The Essence flows of the place are gone now, and perhaps there are other answers buried under the rubble that forms two of the walls in this chamber.

The light of Gallius' Caste Mark, too, has a strange and transformative effect. The walls shimmer and sparkle discernibly as she looks this way and that, here in the inner chamber, and at one point she can see the writhing runes of lettering on the wall, struggling visibly to re-form themselves. And in time they do, as she stares more intently, to form legible words: **Here lies the Midmorning Sakura, whose petals must fall for a time on barren earth**

Gallius looks to her weapon and then to Jin-nu. "Well, it seems this weapon has a name, though I fear there is nothing else of value here. This is a baren pit, now, though it remembers better times." Jin-nu nods, "This is all that remains of the past. One can only hope we have all learned to do better things." The journey back for the two is somewhat slower, though it certainly feels faster to them.

---

The next leg of the journey is rather straight-forward. The Lady has to go ask Weeping Prowler for a favor. She hopes he is in the mood for guests, and she also wonders what he will think of her, now that she has done so much and shown respect to the Silver Way. Only time will tell, and as she has little time to wait.

The eastern forests that are the home of the reclusive Lunar are teeming with life throughout the summer months. This trip is no exception, and Gallius witnesses an abundance of flying, floating, and swarming creatures on her trip to the lake in front of the magnificent waterfall-Manse where the Lunar once known as Erisus makes his home. Gallius is greeted before the entrance by the river-dragon hybrid, the very creature she and her Circle fought with months before. He looks to be quite healthy, and glowers as he sees who's arrived. "Master will see you," is all he says, gesturing with a clawed hand inside.

Gallius bows to the river-dragon and smiles. She's actually happy to see he's lived. Even if his attitude is still rather repulsive. She will enter the manse and seek out Prowler. She believes she knows how this will work, even though it's a bit strange, as she has two worlds of honor and respect to deal with.

The magnificent structure, with its crystalline walls and half-glimpsed shadows, is still a marvel to behold, and a testament to the architecture of a long-faded eon of wonders. Prowler, himself almost a relic of that earlier time, is calmly meditating at the highest level, kneeling in lotus before the open gap in the room that admits the waterfall. He rises, inclining his head in what passes for politeness among men of power. "Be welcome in my house," he says.

Gallius bows more deeply, "Thank you for your warm greeting." She looks around, adding, "This place's beauty only seems to grow with the passing of time. Or perhaps it is that my eye is more able to perceive it?"

"This place was erected by Solar hands," replies Prowler, sounding contemplative. "As you grow in your power, as I know you have, the true artistry of it naturally becomes clearer to your sight." He gestures to the walls. "In time, I'm sure even you, with little interest in craftsmanship, will discern the words of power formed by the crystals that make up the wall, or perhaps hear the whispers of those words as they command the water to flow properly."

Gallius nods slightly and considers the manse once more. "In time, I suppose. I have little interest in the crafting of things by my own hands, save the future itself. A better one, it is to be hoped." She does not want to waste Prowler's time, however. "I have come to ask for your help. In two ways. I am unsure which will put me more in your debt."

"Speak, and I will consider it," the elder Lunar suggests.

"I wish to learn more of the Silver Way," says Gallius. "I have faced the Trials, but I am still ignorant in many things, I fear. The other request is perhaps a strange one." The Queen pauses, trying to consider her words carefully, "I have seen beastmen who blend the blood of a man and the strong creatures of the world, and it seems that Lunars know the secret of this mingling. I do not wish to mingle men with creatures. Well, not yet, at least. But I wish to create a new race of horses who can fly and who are cunning enough to better understand riders."

Prowler considers for long moments. "To learn of the Silver Way," he grunts, "speak with whoever presided over your initiation. It is not my affair to instruct young cubs unless they've come to me for their trial." To the other matter he now turns himself. "You've seen my servants. They were created through sorcery of the Celestial Circle, a simple spell I've made use of. It works equally well on two beasts as on beasts and men."

"And what might I do to convince you to aid me with this magic?" asks Gallius. She is privately amused. Through his refusal to tell her of the Silver Way Prowler is telling her much of the Silver Way.

"There are things that might convince me to furnish the trivial effort required for such a task," Prowler remarks, offhandedly. "I'm interested, Gallius, in what you think I'd like."

Gallius considers Prowler for a time and shakes her head just slightly. "I am not sure, Weeping Prowler. You are strange to me. You seem so distant and reserved, as if you could stay here for another age and be content. In me burns a fire that can only be quenched in death or victory. We are, I'm afraid, very different."

"You are a doer of deeds. I am a survivor of history," says the Lunar. "That is the difference between us. I am drawn to the flame of the Solars by my nature.. but there is one flame in particular that held my heart. Still, there are things I desire."

"I am sorry for your loss," says Gallius softly. "I will do what I can to aid you, Weeping Prowler. If you have watched me you know how I have carried myself with others. I do not like to ask for favors when I have not had an opportunity to offer service first."

"Well, you have made your offer. But I put little stock in promises whose outcome I cannot see," replies the Lunar, a little testily. "Nevertheless, you asked, and I should respond. My Jaguar-men are independent and willful; they make their own fates, and I approve of it. But they are still crude half-men, and scorn civilized ways. Bring them arms, and tools, and show them what they can make of them, and I will create whatever steeds you require. Obviously I do not expect this to be done personally; but in your present position, I have no doubt you can see to it."

"I can see to that," says Gallius. "I imagine I will first have to show that my ways are worthwhile to them." She smirks and recalls, "I had to demonstrate the effectiveness of my methods to Non Valon's apemen. I suppose this shall be no different."

Prowler chuckles. "The jaguars and Valon's get are old rivals. Simply tell them that his tribe is using such arms and are far superior thereby, and they will embrace them immediately."

Gallius laughs softly, "I suppose that will work. I will do what I can, though this is not really a great favor, for it is what I was made for. The servants of Lunars and the people of cities both should benefit from my presence. I will aid your these men and show them how powerful they might become."

Prowler inclines his head in the barest nod, a show of politeness. "Bring your mounts and other creatures to me, and I will work my art on them."

"The other creature I have yet to decide upon," says Gallius. "I know it must fly, be very powerful, as well as intelligent. I have heard stories of birds like this, but such legends are far from specific. Do you know of a creature that might suit?"

Prowler gives this some thoughts. "Among the forests I know of no such creature, but further south there is a great bird called a strix, resembling an owl. They are quite large and intelligent, but carnivorous and canny as well. Valon can guide you to their nesting-spots, I am sure."

"It should prove an interesting journey," says Gallius. "I will bring this creature then. I will waste no time." The Queen definitely doesn't like wasting time. That much is clear. She will offer another polite bow and take her leave of Prowler once more. She has a job to do.

---

With the help of Valon, after a brief stop by his ruined and forest-eaten lair, Gallius and Rabby, her colleague in the hunt, streak south, following the guides Valon established. Part of the trip involves following a songline the ape-men use to stalk past the outposts of loggers and soldiers in the eastern woods; the rest is a simple set of directions.

The trees are dark and spectral, brooding with slow malice as they hang over the long, narrow pool where Gallius' sky-ship sets down. She and Rabby alight and walk carefully into the densely-packed woodlands, noting the shimmers of light reflecting off wet leaves, and the thin shafts of sun fading with twilight through the canopy overhead.

Gallius studies her surroundings with interest. Ever since nearly dying to get initiated she's tried to gain a greater appreciation and understanding of the wilder parts of Creation. "There's so much life here.. so much energy," she whispers faintly.

"That's not always good," mumbles Rabby, who stalks warily beside her. "If you can keep quiet at all, follow me.." And so saying, she takes the lead, her clothes disappearing and her form melting as she adopts the shape of her totem, the lynx. Looking back once, she flicks her ears, then proceeds to lead the way into the depths of the forest.

And so the lioness, master of the plains, will follow the lynx into the woods. Gallius knows how to hunt and stalk, though she is far from a thief in the night when she moves. It is mostly her natural grace that aids her in maintaining something of her silence.

The lynx is quieter by far; she's already preparing to pounce when, well after dusk, the pair come upon a nest of the creatures. They are indeed large, and the weight of even two of them bends the branches of the two trees in which they lurk in pairs. Three hear Gallius' approach, and fly away; the fourth lets out a horrid screech, and tries to take wing, spreading its feathered wings and casting a shadow over several yards on the forest floor. But Gallius is ready; boldly springing, she leaps and severs the branch on which its claws are too deeply dug in, and the horrid owl-thing comes crashing down. Rabby is ready, abandoning the humble lynx for the powerful and ferocious sand-tiger shape from the South. She rushes the strix, meeting each of its screeches with a deathly growl.

The Lunar wins; there was little doubt to begin with. And in the failing light, Gallius can see the ferocity, the savage single-mindedness, that lurks at the core of every Lunar. Gone is the sometimes-snarky, always-verbal Rabby, the loner of Nexus streets and lover of Luna. The creature that snaps the neck of the owl-thing and buries its fangs deep in the bloodied neck of the beast as its yellow eyes lose their shine is no longer human. It is the antithesis of civilization, the true essence of nature given Exalted form, and Gallius witnesses the last act of consumption as Rabby howls into the sky while overhead the pale moon and her blue-green sister shine down impartially.

And yet, this, too, is part of what must be in Creation. Civilization cannot be all there is. This is how life grows, gains strength, and moves from humble origins into new forms. Gallius watches for a moment, then turns away, knowing well that the world is a very large place. Much is necessary and therefore good.

In time Rabby has sated herself, and a new strix claws at the earth impatiently, near the body of a dead one. Rabby extends her new wings, experimentally, then gestures with one wing-tip, and takes to the air. She circles overhead, flying slowly and lazily and letting Gallius follow her into the eerie night.

It's not too difficult to locate the course of the three spooked striges. Rabby, despite the smell of blood on her, is accepted into their company. Gallius can see as much as she crouches, using her plains-born predatory instincts. She creeps closer to the four owl-things as they perch on the low branches of their new home, a short and leafless tree near a stream of water.

Gallius makes her way towards her quarry from downwind, making use of the river's chatter to cover her approach. Closer and closer she comes, until finally she bursts from a crouch and uses her naginata to vault into the air. Landing on a branch near the largest strix, she pushes off, using it for a springboard to slam as hard as she can into her unsuspecting foe.

Her foe's wings strain against the crushing hold of the lioness, but the solar holds tightly, gripping the wings of her foe with a ferocity not unlike that of the lunars, though her strength comes not from beastial rage, but from her own indomitable will. The struggle goes on and on, but Gallius does not flag or give up, though the outcome is far from certain as the strix shows no sign of surrendering its freedom just yet.

Gallius is hardly an expert bird-keeper, but she knows a thing or two about dealing with wild creatures. Holding isn't really enough. She reaches out to reclaim her naginata and slips in a few well-timed kinetic suggestions on the struggling strix. Once the beast is fairly subdued and rather exhausted, Gallius draws out the binding she has prepared. It is a net of many ropes, woven by hands far more skilled than her own. She uses this to restrain the wings of the best, and then uses still more rope to bind the talons of the strix. This being done, she looks over to Rabby, who is still in the form of the bird. "Do you think you can carry it back to the ship this way?" she asks.

The Lunar girl's response is to adopt the form of a lumbering draft-horse; apparently her versatility has grown. The strix fits uncomfortably but adequately over her back, and the trip back through the forbidding forests is accomplished. More than once, Gallius can see pairs - or triplets - of glowing eyes regarding her from the distant gloom, but no further unpleasantness assails the pair.

---

Before returning to Prowler, there was the little matter of picking up the promised goods and talent. Gallius is not cheap, she brings a few men she herself had trained, as well as a few skilled craftsmen. The weapons are of fine make, designed specifically for the bodies of the jaguarmen, which both Rabby and Valon are quite aware of. With all that she can safely pack onto the airship she returns to Weeping Prowler's manse.

The soldiers are uneasy. On the one hand, they have learned that the sun-gods are virtuous in their public dealings; on the other, the Anathema - the Lunar Exalted, and their beastmen - are an all-too-known commodity in the lives of the Threshold, and men fear what they do not know, which has always been so and which always will be. Nevertheless they cooperate, and do not balk or blanch when they see the creature that awaits them once again at Prowler's door.

Gallius maintains her men's courage by showing no fear herself. She speaks with them often, and assures them that they will be kept safe. If the beastmen should harm them, Gallius will not be gentle or forgiving. She greets the dragon at Prowler's manse politely, "I believe your master is expecting us."

Again Gallius enters the crystal castle; this time, though, Prowler meets her on the second floor, apparently having descended as he saw the arrival of the craft outside. "We'll not work here," he announces. "I will accompany you while your men are delivered to my jaguars."

Gallius bows her head and will let Prowler dictate the place where this.. work shall begin. "The jaguars may need a demonstration of the worth of the knowledge my people can give them. I have brought some of my best, and had weapons prepared that will serve your people well. I trust they will receive these things honorably and treat these men well."
