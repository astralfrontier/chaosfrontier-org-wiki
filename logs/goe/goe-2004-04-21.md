# Gods of Eden 2004-04-21

The mountaintop lake warms up several hours after the last battle with the Mad Wolves, and light begins streaming down once again. The air is cool, but not especially frigid. The Solars themselves have recent memories of the furthest reaches of the desolate North, where Ramar's Manse lies hidden in its glittering armor of ice, and each is privately grateful that the summer months lie easy on the more temperate northern coastline.

"Ahhhh. Summer at last." Ramar has a grin that can only be described as well-worn, like a pair of used, but entirely comfortable and utterly practical socks. He chuckles, and as the group walks amidst the beautiful terrain, watching light stream and pool while the Sun shines gently down, Ramar speaks. "So since we're out here in the middle of nowhere... but we've got a general idea of where we are, heading for Cherak ought to do it. We can find a way to hitch a ride to wherever from tehre." He nods to the Dragon Blooded members of the group, while his footsteps crunch the ground, managing to sound hungry. Or maybe it's the soft growl of the stomach. "I think you shouldn't have too much trouble booking passage out of there. I'm sure we'll be able to help. Anyways, I'm hungry."

Meanwhile, Davron has been concentrating, focusing his attention on his spirit ring. Now he slumps over. His eyes are darting this way and that, as though he'd entered the "midnight hunt" wherein sleepers confront their dreams. The ring feels slightly warm to the touch, and the other Solars can feel a faint but steady stream of Essence between the ring and its wearer. Perhaps Davron is in a close communion with the bound soul who occupies the orichalcum band?

Mountainheart speaks up. "Vanda and I, at least, are not unschooled in survival and foraging," he rumbles, indicating the black monk with a hand. "Neither of our groups will be a hindrance to the other, I hope."

Gallius is planning ahead. Cherak is a logical, but somewhat dangerous choice. If what has transpired has gone ahead of them, it may be very deadly, indeed. The Dragon-Blooded, she knows, are but one claw of the mighty fist of the Realm. The Bronze Faction could send someone far more potent, and it is weighing on her mind. Even amongst this, she reacts to the slumping of Davron, and moves to catch him. Sensing no danger, she scoops the man up and keeps going, still saying nothing.

Walking through the snow, Chi-Yosh is less impressed with the winter lands, considering his time spent enjoying the visit with Yurgen. However, as he walks, the different fauna is inspected. Having taken a drenched sack from the ship, the Su'Katan plucks plants and roots new to him and drops them into the rucksack for later investigation. Some are overly soaked, because even now the frozen ground begins to melt and saturate the plants, and several look unedible, but who knows what might occur. "We are not a burden on eachother; we are a team. If you lack one skill, you have another which can support those who do not."

"We are a team," observes Maiel, the woman who wears the bird's-feather cloak, still sounding somewhat haughty. "You are a group."

"And being haughty out here helps no one." Ramar then turns towards Mountainheart, and manages to convey the fact that he's quite capable and willing to work with others to make the journey quite easy with the words, "We won't be a hindrance." Ramar puts a few more words through the ringer, demonstrating the Master's lessons in taking a phrase or a sentence and packing it down with all manner of intents and purposes as he addresses Maiel again, smiling an odd little smile as he says, "We're a team now. I'm going to get food."

Gallius ignores the argument, knowing that for now things will have to be as they are. Time will wear down the lies of the Realm. She speaks softly to Spring Lotus, "Do you think we will find trouble awaiting us in Cherak?"

The gentle monk shakes her head. "I've never been there," she confesses. She turns to Ice, the gunman in white, who chuckles. "I have. It's a rowdy town. Miners come south; merchants come north. They meet in Cherak. Gold and drugs change hands. Spirits are few and far between. The only trouble waiting there is the city itself."

"Which may be enough," says Gallius. "But I think if we are wise we may get through without trouble. I have not been in this city before, so if there are any warnings you would give, I would appreciate it. We are travelling together, though we are not yet one, as I wish to be. What would harm any of us will harm us all."

"Is that so? Sounds a bit like Nexus, except a little... I'm not quite sure... it sounds like the sort of place that people might wind up in of their own volition." Ramar chuckles, then asks, "Do you suppose it will be difficult to arrange for a ship headed towards the Scavengerlands?"

"Wear concealing cloaks," advises Ice. "We'll trade for furs when we get further south, if we make it that far. Once in Cherak, we'll have no difficulty finding transport."

Chi-Yosh moves closer to Mountainheart. He and Ice seem to be the leaders of the Huntsmen, and while Ice may know, it is possible Mountainheart deals with the Realm as well. "How does the Huntsmen process work? How long does it take to organize the Hunt, and the location of the target?" It would be good to know how much time they have, if an opposition might be mounted against them. And the knowledge of the Wyld Hunt's procedure could be helpful in the future.

"You assume you've earned our trust rather quickly," observes the stocky knight, furrowing his eyebrows together.

The sun sets on the first day of travel; almost everyone has hunted or foraged after their own fashion. The Solars, hardy survivalists all from their recent experiences and close contact with the Lunars and other dangers of the Threshold, perform more adequately than the civilized, urbane Dragon-Blooded. But in the end, it is they who go hungry for lack of adequate food to sustain almost a dozen persons traveling in the wilds of the north. This goes unremarked, though certainly not unnoticed, by Mountainheart. Davron has regained his consciousness, and aided in the efforts, performing admirably.

Over the course of the next two weeks, the Solars, Dragon-Blooded and their mortal companions travel south. Snowburn, the guard-captain, expresses his gratitude to Gallius more than once about the efforts being expended on their behalf; Mountainheart says nothing, but his grudging appreciation for the skills of the Anathema is expressed with equal plainness. There are days when some go hungry; almost always, it is one of the Solars, and hunger pangs are strongly noticeable at the dawn of every day.

At a small village built in the lee of the southern coastal mountain-range, Mountainheart barters with the spirit-ruler using a thick nugget of jade in exchange for food, as well as furs and blankets enough to conceal the group's unusual weapons and armor. The god, a spirit of the northern winds with twin elemental concubines, seems to know something of the party's passing already, and with smirking condescension he hints at the true hospitality awaiting travelers bold enough to return to the north, suggesting that few who visit the north leave once they are frozen into the barren terrain of its wastelands. Nevertheless the party receives its furs and provisions. The party eats heartily and hungrily, while the tribesmen watch in awe.

In time the group pass over the mountains, following the well-worn trader's trail. Cherak is not far off; another day suffices to come in sight of its crude stone walls and carven glyph-towers. The Dragon-Blooded each exhibit signs of relief at the sight of the far-off city, and make haste to reach it.

---

Cherak is a walled city with many towers, each inscribed with a glyph of protection worked cunningly into the stone. The walls, similarly, are inlaid with runes of warding, made of bone, simple rock, and sometimes semi-precious metals. Light sparkles from the thick glass windows in the towers and high buildings of this trade-city, radiating an eerie aura at dawn and dusk but shining brightly during the midday. The eastern gate of the city is closest, and the party makes its approach. They are thickly furred, but Ice reveals himself, manifesting his Caste Mark and establishing himself as an Exalt of the Blessed Isle, and the guards almost lose their weapons in their haste to abase themselves. The sorcerer leads the rest inside, threading his way through streets blushing with spilled wine or speckled with hints of snow and seeking a familiar place.

The squat, heavy front face of the inn the man leads the way to is decorated with cartouches and scenes from a battle of some kind. _Betrayal at Kalten_ hangs over the door, and inside is the sound of some sort of brawl. The Solars look to the left, at one of the windows, as it smashes into bits. Two bodies tumble through it, trailed by the strong odor of alcohol and worse, and the two brawling men continue their altercation here in the very street. More raucous sounds emanate from within, suggesting that this is not an isolated dispute.

"Now this, this reminds me of home," says Gallius softly. She can't help but grin as she turns to Ice. Yeah, she thinks she'll get on well with him. "I trust these accomodations will be quite comfortable, and the entertainment is clearly exquisite."

Ice replies by spotting a man staggering out the front door, dagger drawn, and smashing a fist into his face. The man almost goes down, before the sorcerer's other hand grabs his shirt and pushes him roughly out of the way. "You gotta do it like this," he explains over his shoulder to the others.

"Hummm... well..." Ramar regards the two bodies tumbling through the window. He opens the door, ducks, then dodges to one side. After a moment or two he peeks inside, already quite certain of what he'll find in there. These sorts of rowdy raucous-filled taverns are all the same, there's a sort of archetype that they tend to take the shape of, much like Elementals eventually take the shape of the dragon. He chuckles, "Well now... this is my kind of place. Reminds me of shore leave almost. A little calm, but then..." He grins as Ice walks in, "Ah. Here we go. Lively." He wades into the mele-er... the inn.

Mountainheart says nothing; he's content to raise one eyebrow in consternation.

Davron rolls his eyes, his expression caught between a scornful smirk and exasperation. "It's the innkeeper I feel sorry for," he remarks dryly. "If it's like this every night, I shudder to think what he's spending in glass. And tables." He turns to Gallius, cracking his knuckles. "What d'you think? Is there room at this inn?"

In answer, another man is tossed through the window on the right. He rolls around, staggers drunkenly to his feet, wipes his forehead with one hand - and the goat's horns growing out of his brow, for good measure, finding them still attached. That much established, he drunkenly stumbles down the street.

Gallius grins and shakes her head. "I'm sure there is room. After all, the occupants are all falling out. And the first guy who lays a hand on me without permission gets an arrow in his foot," she says casually. She'll follow Ice's lead. But she just carries herself as one expecting not to be mettled with, and that is generally enough defense.

Chi-Yosh watches the exchange without much expression. For they are in the company of the Dragon-Blooded, and everything the Circle does is a reflection upon it. After slipping inside behind Ice and Gallius. Let them haggle over rooms. The air is cold outside, the room is warm, and no doubt there is soup at hand. Pushing past, he walks to the counter among the shifting tables and patrons either raring to fight or in the process of. Ordering a simple cup of soup, the Su'Katan takes it to a table, to sit. It is the eye of the storm, as he is flanked by two fisticuffs started over someone's mother and an yeddin. A tankard whizzes by his head, missing due to the slight forward incline of his head. The Dawn merely picks up his soup and tips the table forwards as a man is thrown towards him, offering a proper barricade.

Gallius moves through the place with ease and confidence. Even when a rather burly man wanders up with alcohol strong on his breath, she smiles calmly. His offer of a drink is accepted, but when he tries to get a bit familiar with the serving wench, Gallius' tankard is brought down on his head like a hammer, relieving him of troublesome consciousness.

"Well then..." murmurs Ramar as he finds his own place in the sprawling fight. "Doubtless no one knows what happened around here?" It's usually about the time someone asks this sort of question, that a glass is flung. Three of them are, in this case. Ramar dodges out of the way, managing to snare a thankfully empty glass that might have at some point been clean. As a bottle flies overhead his cup begins to runneth over... but then Ramar looks down and realizes drinking it would be genocide to whatever life is growing there. He doesn't really bother to find out, instead tossing the glass upwards, then ducking back as a chair spins wide. As the chair-wielder advances on Ramar, the glass, now teeming with life, realizes that it must in fact fall at some point, and does so. It shatters, and the chair clatters to the ground. Ramar perches atop it, and makes sure that his friends are all holding their own. Or someone else's own. Whatever. He'll call to the innkeeper "Rooms... how many are vacant?"

Davron's own entry is remarkable, mostly, for being unremarkable. He steps lightly around pairs and groups of brawlers, reacting only to those threats that refuse to be ignored. He even allows his companions to do the talking - his own role, as he sees it, is to simply ensure that drunken fools do not interfere.

The proprietor has to yell to make himself heard; he's wringing his hands and muttering prayers to a hundred gods, but he manages to collect a fair bit of jade from Ice, and the dozen or so thickly-furred travelers head down the steps and into the rooms of the inn, buried beneath the earth and comforting stone. The din is much reduced here, and with four interconnected rooms, privacy and security should be assured.

"Yes. This is much better. I think things are..." It is at that moment the din decides to grow a bit, then fall back to the regular level. "Nevermind. So we have four rooms? Who will sleep where?" asks Ramar, ponderously.

Gallius will be glad to have a room away from all this racket. She also will be happy to get out of the furs once the room is shut. "That wasn't too difficult." She pauses for only a moment and says to Ice, "In your opinion who should we ask for passage away from here? There is much waiting to be done, and we should not delay."

Davron raises his head, and then his hand, the gold glinting off the ring he wears. "I think you should ask me."

Gallius turns to Davron and hmms, "What exactly were you doing with.. well, nevermind that. If you have a solution to this problem, I am eager to hear of it." She will ask him in private about that trance of his.

Ever the one to ask a question, or two, or three, Ramar asks Davron, "Well alright then. What is it you've got in mind for transportation?"

Davron nods to Ramar and Gallius. "You recall what we discussed, as we were headed southward? How we planned our transportation to the far South?" He raises a questioning eyebrow to Gallius, as if to ask if she wishes more elaboration - he is still uncertain of the extent of the truce between the Solars and the Wyld Hunt - but continues, with a smile: "Well, it would seem that we have need of the crucial spell rather sooner than we expected."

Gallius nods to Davron, "If there is a way to accomplish that still, it will save many, many lives." The Lady, for a moment, lets her mind drift. "And I must arrive swiftly at Harborhead, for I have yet more work to do to spare great lives from useless death," she finally says. She must trust the Dragon-Blooded, else her words are nothing but lies.

"Time is of the essence, then," Davron says, nodding at the mention of Harborhead. "Then I will spend the time _now_ to learn from my new tutor within the ring. All we will need after that, to return home swiftly, is a vessel whereon I can work sorcery without undue comment."

"Leave that to me," rumbles Mountainheart, clapping a hand on Ice's shoulder. Vanda, the black monk, eyes the knight speculatively. "You aren't going to commit theft, are you?" he asks, and Mountainheart shakes his head. "Commandeer," he replies. "Come." And he and Ice take their leave, heading up the stairs.

The Lady spends her night repaying the inn keeper, and doing something she does extremely well: performing. She draws out the ophicleide of Jyamis and amidst chaos, creates a powerful song, sending its soothing beauty into a different sort of war with the melee taking place about her. The lady needs no essence to enhance the potency of her song, for this long lost instrument works a magic that is as old as sound itself.

As the song goes on and on, brawls are stopped and even alcohol-dimmed minds are turned from fighting to listening. Grown men stand with slack arms, enchanted by the haunting, dancing notes of the ophicleide as it is played by a true master. Gallius moves from a sad, slow work into more uplifting ones, moving cautiously, for she knows that her notes tug at emotions and can change minds, given time.

Before the night is very old, men dance with men whose eyes they had blackened just a few hours earlier. Gallius sets aside her ophicleide, and after whetting her whistle, she picks up a borrowed lyre and begins to play while she sings a strange song of the past. It is both new and old, for in it Gallius sings of the earliest days, when everything was new and nameless. Surely this song is based on those ancient memories, sewn together by the skilled bard and performed in this distant age.

This song goes on and on, an epic that traces the beauty of Creation, from desert to forest to the heights of the sky and the depths of the ocean. The rhytm is a powerful one, for Creation has a pulse to it, here slowing and there racing, but present in even its most distant corners, where it battles the Wyld.

Gallius is singing for a full hour broken only for moments where the lyre is alone and her voice rests. With the last note, the spell of music slowly wears off, leaving men with a strange feeling of euphoria and a desire to simply rest. It is more like waking from a long, pleasant dream than anything else. As they slowly rouse themselves, Gallius will slip away to her room, satisfied.

Chi-Yosh sits upon the steps leading down into the rooms. This gives him the perfect vantage for listening to the sounds of Gallius' power, while he sifts through the sack of roots collected from the frozen north. Sadly, nothing proves more promising than something to brew in steaming milk to soothe an aching head. Later, the innkeeper finds a small bag filled with the medicine, a small note attached detailing brief instructions. The simple message beneath: "You need this more than I do."

---

The party spends a comfortable night in the reassuring bulwark of the earth-buried rooms, a sweet respite from the two weeks of nerve-numbing cold they've just endured. And in the morning, they find three things: first, a sumptuous breakfast like nothing they have ever seen, laid out on bamboo trays; second, their room-fee, in jade, returned in full and with interest; third, a note of appreciation from the inn-keeper. Ice and Mountainheart return to report success; a large sailing vessel, the _Sou'easter_, is at their disposal. Both men are somewhat surprised by the bounty awaiting them, and after quietly questioning their fellows render mute recognition of the performance's effects. And by mid-morning, as thirteen bellies are fulled, weapons are stowed, belongings are accounted for and hearty belches are uttered, a sense of satisfaction descends over the Solars. They've survived, and thrived, and if the Northern ice and the Blessed Isle's elite warriors cannot stop them, nothing will stand in the
