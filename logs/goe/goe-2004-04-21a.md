# Gods of Eden 2004-04-21a

Davron wraps the fur around him tighter, so that it will not be disturbed while he meditates. Closing his eyes, he folds his hands together, opening up his mind to the ring upon his finger. "I never got the chance to thank you for your help back in Nexus," he begins, speaking with his mind alone. "For that matter, we didn't even get a chance to introduce ourselves. Who are you?"

_My name is Yang,_ the inner voice answers. _Once Chosen of the Maidens, a Sidereal Exalt._

Davron mentally nods. _I am Chosen of the Unconquered Sun, known now as Davron. Although, as you pointed out at our first meeting, I am not 'me'. Many centuries separate me from the last incarnation of my spark, and my memory has yet to span that gap._

_You are a Solar indeed,_ replies Yang. _Yet you are unlike the Solars I remember. So very unlike them.._

Davron is perplexed and intrigued. _What were they like, then?_ he asks apprehensively.

The voice ceases, and Davron feels himself blanking out. He's not at all conscious of his own body falling, slumping into a deep sleep, nor being caught and carried by his friends as they trek through the mountains.. Instead, he's only aware of himself, dressed in glowing robes of light, and wearing a golden crown with several jewels in the brow, much as he was attired in Yu-Shan. He walks from darkness into light, finding himself treading the stone pathway of a temple. It is situated high on the slopes of rolling foothills, overlooking a vast and impossibly blue ocean. The air is hot and somewhat humid, and very comfortable. It is the tropical West, and the Essence of Water suffuses everything.

Davron wanders the halls, seeking whatever Yang has set for him to find. He assumes that this vision is meant to _show_ Davron the answer to his question. "What am I looking for, Yang? Where do I need to be?"

Outside the temple is an island, and Davron shields his eyes with a hand as he steps onto the waving grass. Another man, dressed similarly, though with lesser majesty, is standing outside, hands folded behind his back as he stares at the sea. He turns, revealing a young and handsome face, with eyes alight with adventure and energy. "Watch this," he says. "The pattern is almost complete." He gestures outward toward the ocean, and in seconds a monumental column of water, one that must be as wide as a city, explodes upward into the waiting sky. So vehement is the thrust that the clouds themselves that gather overhead are wetted and pushed back by the uprising flow. The sound arrives a few moments later, and Davron can witness the torrential waves flooding toward the island.

Davron takes a step back toward the temple door, his voice tinged with trepidation. "I... think I'm going to be more than watching in a moment..."

The young man chuckles. "Davron, the only way for us to communicate like this is for you to appear in my memories. This, here, happened well over a millennium ago. Anyway, you don't suppose that the Solar city-builders wouldn't account for this, do you?" He makes this final remark as the tidal waves gather strength to attack the beach - and are repelled by an invisible barrier, while runes of protection, water and warding burn and twist like molten gold in the air.

Davron relaxes by degrees. "Now that I know where and when I am, I understand a little better," he says, smiling a little. He then frowns again. "But who shaped that attack, then, and why? Surely _they_ knew the protections placed upon the island..."

"It's not an attack..." Yang points outward, as the column of water finally begins to subside, falling downward. Davron can see now lines of Essence growing visible in the distant air, and noting how the water falls no further than each line dictates. The explosion is, in fact, shaping itself into quite an intricate form.. "It's a city," finishes the once-Sidereal, quietly. "They're making a city out of water."

Davron's eyes widen, twinkling slightly as he smiles. "Giving solid form to water. A fascinating coincidence, that - I was recently challenged with that very problem. Albeit on a far smaller scale. The secrets of those city-builders yonder have been lost in the millenium since."

"Then it is perhaps not coincidence that this is the memory you entered," suggests Yang. "I wish I understood the full depth of secrets behind the construction of that monument. Perhaps in time I can tell you what I do know. But you are here for something else." The young man, with his bright eyes, turns from his position and steps closer, facing Davron.

Davron nods, turning his gaze from the growing aquatic construction to face Yang. "I am," he says, his expression becoming more somber, as he reprises his earlier question. "How am I different from the Solars you remember?"

Yang chuckles. "Well, for starters, you aren't in the West," he says. Growing a tad more serious, he continues. "You.. don't put yourself above them. That city out there? It's like...they're showing off. 'We are Chosen, we have built you this city, worship us.' You lack that hubris."

Davron nods more seriously, gazing out onto the ocean again. "That fits," he says quietly. "That hubris is what brought down the Solar Empire. I don't know if that happened before your time or after, but it cannot have been many centuries after that city was erected that its builders were overthrown by the Dragon-Blooded."

"That much I have learned," observes Yang. "Of course.. you wear another monument of their power as well, certainly one less visibly impressive. Is it hubris to confine a soul into a ring?"

Davron glances by reflex at the hand that normally bears the ring... then sighs and returns his gaze to Yang's. "It may be," he admits, bowing his head slightly. "Why were you confined, then? And what do you now seek?"

The scene changes. Davron now finds himself, similarly robed, sitting on a throne. Beside him, to the left and right, are four other thrones, all occupied. He sits to the left of the center-most throne. The room is enormous - it would almost be mistaken for an outside court if Davron could not see the distant ceiling overhead, instead of clouds. Pennants wave lightly from the walls; tapestries, depicting the victories of the Chosen in battle and diplomacy, are everywhere. A host of men and women, spirits and gods, elementals and other, stranger beings throng the court. And at the center, kneeling before the five thrones, is Yang. "Yang, Sidereal advisor to Merela, are hereby condemned for your misjudgement and disruptive damage to the Loom of Fate," booms the Solar from the center throne, a bearded and regal man.

Davron, having once again come on the scene _in medias res_, can only listen, hoping that the sentencing will include the details of Yang's alleged transgressions. As he listens, though, he takes in the impossibly ornate - and, as Yang suggested, self-important - decorations, unable to entirely conceal his distaste.

"I have no defense," says Yang, quietly, casting an eye at Davron. "I manipulated the Loom to suit my own ends. I changed fate for selfish reasons. I sought the power greater than the gods. And the region of Alacian paid for my transgression." The bearded lord on his throne rises. "For the damage you have done, Yang, you shall be soulforged into a spirit ring. You will be the advisor to sorcerers, as you have done so admirably. But never again will you be Chosen. Never again will you interfere with fate." He steps down, regarding the supplicant Sidereal. "Guards, remove his robes of station." The Dragon-Blooded step forward, stripping Yang of his garments of light. The lord raises his hand, two fingers outstretched, and empowers them with Essence. "I mark you now with nine sutras. Your fate depends on your observance of them."

So saying, the Solar thrusts his tight-closed fingers forward, marking and scoring the prisoner with patterns of light. He etches phrases, glowing with the light of molten gold, onto Yang's flesh. The process does not seem unduly painful; it is with regret and shame that Yang weeps, not mere physical pain.

Yang rises, and the Dragon-Blooded flank him. "Take him from this place, to the Forge," commands the lord, and the memory shifts again. Now, Yang is naked, in a small room, whose every wall is etched with runes and words of power. Davron is present, wearing black robes. The Sidereal looks up, noting his own body tattooed with similar glyphs. "The Soul Seal," he says, with a hint of a smile. "It took a year to complete the purification rites. I was a bad boy."

Davron nods. "So I hear," he says dryly. "And so this was - this is your sentence, then," he adds, musing. "I... honestly am not sure how to answer your question, then," sighs Davron. "Wrongdoing demands compensation, after all, and I heard you confess before the thrones, but..."

"The sutras. The Nine Sutras of Righteous and Harmonious Behavior," says Yang. "They are what saved you in that awful temple, when you rescued me and took me away from those infernalists. There are eight to go."

Davron nods. "What are the Nine Sutras then? That is lore I have not yet learned."

Yang smiles. "The sutras are my punishment and my salvation. They are the nine lessons of proper behavior that were inscribed on my body by the magistrate, as you saw. They describe the laws of Heaven and earth that I broke, and what I should have done to behave properly. I invoked the Eighth Sutra - the Path of Escaping Calamity - to bring you and your party out of the temple."

Yang sees the facial expression of his new associate, and struggles for a clearer means to explain what for him is a fundamental truth of existence. "Think of existence. Your life, the lives and fortunes of everyone around you. It's governed by a set of laws, or principles, or umm, sometimes guidelines. This is Dharma, the foundation, the firmness. Things happen a certain way - a man is wronged, he takes revenge. A man is stabbed, he dies. A man cheats on his wife, he sleeps on the roof. You know, how things just naturally work, right?" He pauses, then continues. "The sutras are parables, or stories, or short sayings, like a proverb. They summarize some aspect of Dharma in an easy-to-read form. Those are the written laws of Heaven, and the laws the Solars governed by."

Davron nods, slowly. "I begin to see, somewhat. The details are still obscure to me, but..." He scratches his head, trying to summarize what he has heard. "The Sutras are the laws that govern fate. And you invoked the Eighth Sutra... and thus you found for us a path to escape the calamity we found ourselves in?"

"Yes. There are thousands of possible sutras. Some include others as parts of themselves. But there is one, that will always be true," replies Yang, softly. "'Elephant crushes gnat.' Power predominates. The sutras that bind me are fairly specific."

Davron nods. "So... I think I begin to see. You may invoke one of the Sutras when the proper shape of fate allows it, when it is _right_ that things happen according to that Sutra. And when you do, when you mend the Loom of Fate in such a way, a part of your sentence is fulfilled. And when all nine are invoked...?"

"If all nine are invoked, and I lived righteously and harmoniously, my soul is freed to claim its reward. Reincarnation or rest in Heaven. If all nine are invoked, and I do not.... I stay bound."

Davron purses his lips. "An exacting sentence. But you have lain a millenium, waiting for a chance to fulfill it." He bows. "I cannot determine how you live, of course. But I will be honored to help you bring your sentence to an end, for good or ill."

"That is all the chance I need," smiles Yang. He touches a hand to his shaved head. "The Soul Seal ended in my ritual suicide, and I was bound into the ring. I am at your service, since there is nothing else I can do."
