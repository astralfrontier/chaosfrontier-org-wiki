Defiler's Grave is the resting place of one of the First Age's mighty Solar despots, and the Convention of the East has always kept a careful eye on such tombs and monuments. Many resting places for the First Age's deceased tyrants lie in the Scavenger Lands; one of the Convention's many tasks is to see that they are not entered - or if they are, that they are not unduly disturbed.

As a consequence of this, many potent spirits of the eastern lands hold long-standing non-aggression and mutual-alliance pacts with the Sidereals as a whole, or with individual Circles. Many of the Chosen of the Maidens have grumbled about the periodic demands such a god will make of his allies. Sometimes, maintaining the bargain calls for small twists of fate in accord with the spirit's whims; other times, one party or the other must merely exercise its power, and a fear of escalation restores the equilibrium of the agreement. But all in all, matters remain peaceful. And so the Convention is duly notified, when in the fullness of time a Solar Circle takes up residence north of one such tomb.

The Woodcarver, Chosen of the Maiden of Serenity, is the man tasked with taking care of difficulties like this. He has dealt harshly (though indirectly) with would-be tomb-robbers in the past; he's familiar with every successful Scavenger Lord within a thousand miles of Nexus. Resolving the issue of a break-in by a band of Solars is not a normal task, but it is one he is nevertheless capable of handling.

Heaven is a magnificent city. Constructed from the elements of life, architected on a foundation of dreams, and nurtured by the Essence of deeds, it is a shimmering jewel in the endless night of Elsewhere. Its beauty sometimes contrasts with the truth of its social order and current position in the state of the world; large swaths of its residences are unused, claimed by greedy gods and left abandoned, while others are explicitly dangerous to visit, for a myriad number of reasons. The greater pantheon seems content to let the Exalted manage this state of affairs, but it is a difficult effort. Coranna reflects on these things as she passes at great speed through the streets, aboard one of the self-guiding flying conveyances the city of Yu-Shan boasts. She reflects further on this upon entering the Cerulean Lute of Harmony, and seeing Woodcarver's face as he greets her and guides her back into the spacious office he holds.

The man seems haggard and lacking in vitality, but his smile is still present and even pleasant. "Welcome," he says. "We've got a problem. Please, sit down." He gestures to a divan, then takes a seat of his own, folding his arms together.

Coranna does not smile, her expression maintaining the neutrality that it nearly always does. She settles herself at the divan and, after a moment, turns to Woodcarver. "A problem?" she asks. Her voice, as usual, greatly contrasts the rest of her, for the music in it. She imagines her stay will again be short. It generally is.

"In the Hundred Kingdoms region of the East, the Scavenger Lands, there is a kingdom called 'Defiler's Grave'," explains Woodcarver. "A Circle of Solars recently set up shop just north of there. The kingdom is named for a mountain, wherein is a tomb. We've had a long-running astrological curse on the savants of the region - any god-blooded or other fractious spirits have been driven away - that's put a great fear into the people. They'll do almost anything to avoid disturbing it. Now it looks like that defense may not be enough; if this Solar Circle does what I expect, and tries to open it, those people may no longer be safe from the tomb."

Coranna nods in agreement. The mention of Solars manages to gain a frown from her. "No doubt they will, and that situation was already delicate," she says simply. "What do you wish to occur?" Her question is simple, and her expression returns to its normal serenity. She does not recall a time when people spoke to her other than for work in Yu-Shan. It is always business.

"We know the Bronze Faction is going to send its best against them," says Woodcarver, sounding rather neutral about the matter. "They may have already. There'll be a lot of tension in the region very shortly. Stopping them from opening the tomb, if they wish, is at this point unlikely given our power and shortage of resources. But I want that tomb's most dangerous areas sealed. Find whatever enchantments or items might be inside - put them nearer the entrance. Use ward-stones. Cause tunnel cave-ins to block access to dangerous chambers. Do whatever you have to. But keep them from disturbing the inner sanctums."

Coranna sighs and nods. "These Solars will be the death of me," she murmurs. "It will be done, though. Stopping them is probably foolish, but with a little work they can be steered away from the greater dangers. I imagine they seek tools of war. Solars always have need of them." Still, there's a hope. "If the Bronze Faction does its job well, maybe our precautions will be unnecessary. Nonetheless, I will see things done correctly myself." Besides, she would like to see these Solars herself.

Woodcarver nods, and gestures. A feathered quill on his desk rises into the air, hanging over a piece of paper. He begins to dictate a brief memo, authorizing his guest's limited use of Heaven's resources, then rolls up the paper and slides it neatly into a scroll case. This he presents, with an adjuration: "This is a medium-priority assignment. If you require us to change fate, we of the Convention, and a lesser minister in the Cerulean Lute will co-sign for it. But I don't anticipate any trouble."

"That should not be necessary," assures Coranna as she accepts the case. "But if you expect no trouble.." She wonders why, then, he chose her, of course. Her eyebrow arches, showing her curiousity even more clearly than her words. Then again, part of her guesses that it was because of her that he sees no trouble in this task.

---

Coranna considers the scroll case for a moment as she makes her way to her manse. Oddly, she's distracted enough by it that she barely even realizes as her flying platform comes to a stop. After a moment she remembers herself and steps off. The manse, like all of Yu-Shan, is a thing of wonder to behold, though time has made Coranna grow more accustomed to it. It is made of material like woven ice, and each stride upon it is like the ringing of a symphony of bells far in the distance. The door, as it were, is a sheet of flowing silver that the sidereal steps through without even a second look.

Entering is like moving into another world completely. Inside the Manse is made of living wood, warm to the touch and bearing an even glow that fills the rooms with a comfortable light. Coranna sets the scroll on a small table that stands near the entrance and makes her way into a central chamber. She does not see Wolf Brother, but she knows he is here as she speaks, "We are bound for the Hundred Kingdoms."

A moment passes, before a hulking human figure appears. He has iron-grey hair, with eyes of the same color, and could easily pass for a rough brute or barbarian in any corner of Creation. Only the placid look on his face suggests he's anything more than that. "Where?" he asks, digesting an entire lattice of thought and planning into a single word.

"Defiler's Grave," says Coranna. She frowns and shakes her head, "It seems we will be meeting some Solars this time." She settles herself down on the floor, leaning on a cushion there. "We are to prevent them from bringing harm to the people there."

"As usual," observes the Lunar, showing teeth for a moment. He spreads his meaty hands wide, an inviting gesture. "Your needs?" The laconic attitude is typical of his post-meditation mind-state; thought and speech occupy opposite ends of the spectrum for the big man, and as he returns his attention gradually to the real world he generally grows more talkative.

Coranna actually laughs softly, "Well, we will need a free hand with them. We are to see to it they get what they need and get out before they cause harm. The Solars are not to be stopped, merely.. guided." Her words are mirthless, despite her wry smile. "So it seems baby-sitting is the order of the day."

"The Sidereal specialty," observes Wolf Brother, taking a few steps forward as he speaks. "But you cannot shepherd the weak forever."

"No, soon we will be trying to shepherd the strong," agrees Coranna. "For these children grow like weeds in an untended garden, and more and more they force our hands, altering fate with their careless ways." She sighs and turns her eyes back to Wolf Brother, "They are like some sort of young animal with huge claws that finds itself in a herd of sheep."

"Careless?" asks Wolf Brother, with a hint of humor in his voice. "Were these under guidance of the Gold Faction or not?" His suggestion is obvious, and a point he's made before: to get someone to do as you wish, train them properly. His belief in the Silver Pact has matured over the years, a change from the rebellious days of his youth.

"Even those thus guided are a danger," says Coranna. "And they remain as they were. In any case, our task is the same. We are to make sure they do not enter the more dangerous places in the tomb." She smiles widely and says, "Of course this means we must do a little furniture moving for them."

Wolf Brother flexes his muscular arms for a moment, glancing at them with a mournful expression. "Once again my strength will be used against an unworthy object," he concludes.

Coranna hmmss, "We will see. If our task is useful, these Solars will have overcome a considerable trial. It seems we are not the only ones interested in them." She purses her lips in thought for a moment. "Still, there is unlikely to be any battle, unless they go insane."

"Why not just remove all useful items and weapons?" asks Wolf Brother. "Stockpile 'em somewhere?"

"If they find nothing, they are likely to pick apart the landscape," says Coranna. "Better if we learn what we can of them and select whatever lies inside that would satisfy them. What I imagine will be most convincing is to leave some way open that is adequately difficult and dangerous to those robbing the tomb but will not rouse one of the slumbering spirits."

The Lunar nods. "We better get going, then."

Coranna moves to her feet and frowns. "We will make for Defiler's Grove, then. Do you have what you need?" She does not wait for an answer, but instead gathers what few things she will be bringing. A bag, the scroll case, and little else. She need carry no blade, for the tatoo on the palm of her left hand holds it for her.

"I'm it," replies the Lunar, sounding a tad reproving. Nevertheless he assists in what way he can.

---

Long ago, the Sidereals realized the need for a swift, efficient transportation system throughout Creation. Potent spirits, magic artifacts, and certain Charms are all employed to move someone from place to place. Today, Coranna and Wolf Brother stand before the Calibration Gate, a shimmering rectangle of light surmounted by a gate-arch of ancient stone and covered in runes aglow with power. Time passes; the pair wait patiently. At length a robed and masked figure - the Gatekeeper - passes through the magic portal, appearing before them. "The Calibration Gate has been summoned to an underground grotto, four miles from your destination," this figure whispers, in his characteristic soft voice. "Make a prayer to the Golden Barque of the Heavens when you are ready to return, and I will be notified." He steps aside, sweeping one arm invitingly toward the Calibration Gate.

Coranna nods to the Gatekeeper and strides forward with her usual confidence. Her mind is already working out just how to deal with the solars should they become difficult. At worst, this will be interesting, and that's something the sidereal appreciates.

Wolf Brother follows, armed and arrayed in his moonsilver attire. The transition through the Gate and into Creation is instantaneous; the Sidereal's foot steps off the delicately sculpted marble and falls again onto rough stone. The air is thick and choking, but not harmfully so; darkness reigns. "Ahead," says Wolf Brother, his eyes remolding themselves into cat's eyes to see better. Behind the pair, the Calibration Gate's archway vanishes like smoke.

Coranna nods in the darkness and follows, letting him lead the way. She goes through her usual mental checklists, wondering just how the tomb shall be handled. It would do no good if her work roused the spirits.

As the tomb slowly draws coser, Coranna calls for a halt, still some half a mile shy of where the ancient grave ought to be. Here she settles a mask on her face and draws out a candle. She kneels upon the ground and twists the candle into the earth. After blowing her breath across it, she reaches once more in her bad, this time bringing forth a pair of glinting stones, which she strikes together. The whisk of rock on rock goes on until finally the candle is lit. It burns with little smoke, but it casts sparks wildly as it burns. Over this strange light the sidereal bows, shutting her eyes.

The sidereal lowers her brow slowly, drawing closer and closer to the flame. When the flame finally is lapping at the brow of her mask, her caste mark bursts alive beneath it. With one last motion the sidereal lifts herself from the flaring candle. Deftly her fingers stretch out and, with a swift pinch, put out the small flame.

Time passes. A warmth begins to rise from the soil nearby; then actual heat begins to radiate. From the ground rises a small figure, looking somewhat like a bird comprised of molten magma. Its joints creak and hiss in the open air; the coals of fire that are its eyes twist to regard its summoner. _I am the tender of the river of lava that sleeps here now,_ it croaks. _The source of the mountain yonder. Who are you?_

The masked woman bows her head to the spirit. "I am the Outstretched Hand," she replies evenly. "I seek news of things held beneath the earth." Her words are clipped, the music of them gone as if by magic.

_You seek the tomb,_ concludes the spirit, its bright and burning eyes a-sparkle. _It is not of my domain, but I know of it. All fear to tread the paths to the mountain. Guards are posted at every entrance. But there are lava-tubes beneath the surface that lead to it, and I can show you their secrets._

The Outstretched Hand nods her head. "That would indeed be of much use," she agrees. "I would rather not trouble the guards with my brief interruptions." She hopes that Wolf Brother is indeed prepared. There may be some digging to do.

_Then follow me._ The magma-spirit turns, burrowing into the earth, forming a small but serviceable tunnel downward. The tunnel exits out into a wide lava-tube, as advertised; the only light is that of the Caste mark on Coranna's brow. Wolf Brother follows, adopting the graceful form of a hunting-cat, his armor and weapons vanishing as the magic of his transformation takes place. The strange bird-spirit begins winging its way ahead, slowly guiding the pair through the rough and twisting tube.

Coranna makes her way down the tunnel without too much trouble, depositing herself into the lavatubes below. She makes way for Wolf Brother, allowing him to take a place slightly ahead of her. Fortune is with her this day, it seems.

In time, the tubes widen out, mingling with each other, joining together and separating in the crazy intersections that molten rock will cause in its passage. Upward, through the bowels of the mountain. The three come to a solid wall of rock, and Wolf Brother adopts his beast-man form. Using his hybrid form's colossal strength, he literally batters the wall into rubble with his fists, brushing his hands of dust and flakes only after. Stepping through, he glances about before beckoning and indicating safety.

The Outstretched Hand watches the action impassively. When her guardian indicates, she moves forward, eager to see what may be seen. There is no need for words yet. This an ideal way to get inside this place, and she believes it would be ideal to use later.

The Sidereal has a strong working knowledge of the occult, and the principles of geomancy; since almost every Solar tomb was built by the then-nascent Shogunate, using their imperfect understanding of such principles to confine the newly dead Solars, the actual layout of such tombs is often a known quantity. Coranna takes little time in establishing her relative position, and within minutes has an accurate working knowledge of the layout. A few exploratory trips down corridors confirm her suspicions. "Demons lurking about, immaterial," reports Wolf Brother, as she returns.

The Lunar, upon being prompted, describes the sensations and shapes his peculiar senses can receive. His partner listens, collates, asks a few brief questions, and cogitates. The magma-spirit has taken leave of them; the tomb is once again quiet, aside from their speech. At length the Sidereal is confident of her deductions: a mixture of erymanthoi, dejeva, and munatenzes, all demons of the First Circle, relatively weak.

"Well, at least there is nothing too terrifying there," says Coranna. Then again, the most potent spirit is the one who was entombed here to begin with. "I think we may have to cave in one passage, but the rest I am not too terribly worried for. If worse comes to worse, we can always destroy whatever demons the blundering Solars awaken. Let's have a careful look at the central vault."

Warily the two Exalts patrol the interior of the tomb. Wolf Brother confirms the suspicions of his charge, that the demons here are bound to specific passages or chambers, and hence will not threaten a casual intruder. More and more a strong and pervading sense of awareness grows in Coranna. This is no mere tomb; this was once the workshop and sanctum of he who was interred here.

A number of magical tools can be found, along with a half-glimpsed forge for orichalcum goods, and a refinery for turning gold into orichalcum can be found at the apex of the tomb, covered over now with tons of rock to hide the sun's glow. Long-rotted paper books are visible on shelves; others, bound in brass and with flexible metal pages, can be seen beside them. "A craftsman, a maker," concludes Wolf Brother, upon seeing these sights.

"This fits well with their need," says Coranna. "The craftsman would benefit from this place." She inspects the books with care and nods to herself. "Indeed, this fits. The others will need things, but this is ideal for the one. That leaves us with the mantis, the dreamer, and the leader. Each has needs that likely must be sated for this place to be left behind."

"Well, as long as this place is not ill-used, I think the spirit should remain in slumber," says Coranna. "However, this leaves a few demons to contend with, still." She looks to Wolf Brother, "Shall we wake them one at a time, or is that unworthy of your attention?" She can't help but grin behind her mask. "I wish to leave one, however. I'm no Gold, I want these children to at least partially earn their profits."

The big wolf-man draws his reaver daiklave, Ten Thousand Edge, watching the blade ripple with Essence as he re-affirms his power over it. "Five at once," he suggests, a slow smile spreading across his feral hybrid features.

Coranna laughs softly. "Suit yourself," she says softly. She puts her empty hands behind her back, but she draws them forward again, she is holding a daiklave of star metal. "Well, let's not keep them waiting," she says, leaving it to Wolf Brother to start the dance even as she calls essence to her in preparation.

The refinery is the first room. Wolf Brother strides in, confidently, his hybrid shape radiating cool waves of barely-restrained Essence. Ten Thousand Edge hums with readiness, its eternal shifting and reshaping sending vibrations through the air. The demons come - erymanthoi, the blood-apes, hungry and bestial. Their claws drip with red and their stupid eyes burn with half-witted malice. And Wolf Brother is among them, and upon them, letting them bestow their claws upon the empty air where he once stood, letting them claw at each other fruitlessly as he dodges, daiklave held close to his chest. And then he cuts, describing a single perfect circle with his weapon. Five erymanthoi stood; ten discrete slabs of demonic flesh fall to the floor. And more come.

Moving as if in a dance, the Outstretched Hand's light steps bear her around the typhoon of death that is Wolf Brother. When demons draw near, the Razor of Prophecy lashes out, guided by fate and with each strike making its weilder ever more powerful. When a pair of demons charge her from front and rear, she leaps, thrusting forth the hungry point of her daiklave and extending a foot out, her body suddenly as rigid as her blade, allowing the force of the first to slam a foot like iron into the second.

In time, the power of the Celestial Exalted is made known to the demons who were bound here, and the millennium-old confinement is broken permanently. The unnatural bodies evaporate into a foul vapor, leaving behind no evidence of their passing.

By the time all is done, the Outstretched Hand is once more flooded with essence. For a moment she maintains her stance, but then, satisfied, she straightens up. With a flourish she swings the Razor of Prophecy back and then brings its point down at her left palm. Rather than slice through flesh and beyond, the sword simply vanishes, as if her palm had absorbed its entire length. "Now that we have had a little activity, we should finish our task. I believe we now can see just what it was these demons guarded without any interference. Some may be too dangerous to leave for the Solars."

"Well, it seems we are in luck," says Coranna. "There's knowledge here, and a few parts, but hardly anything world-threatening." She nods to Wolf Brother, "If you would be so kind as to block off the burial chamber, we may soon get out of here. We'll trim a few more of the guards away, and then I'm going to look at some of these books. I have to consider carefully the information stored here. Some may need to be lost."

"I understand," says the Lunar, loping away. And in a few minutes, the sound of careful chiselling can be heard. Wolf Brother has apparently seen fit to collapse the tunnel, not with the raw fury of brute force, but with the cunning eye and attention to detail of a craftsman. Perhaps it is paranoia; perhaps it is wisdom.

It would seem wisdom, to the Outstretched Hand. Still, there is much to consider. "With these, they might gain a great deal of power," she murmurs. "And yet Woodcarver was unclear. It must mean that the Gold and Bronze fought to a standstill. They would probably gladly leave it in someone else's hand to make this decision."

Patiently, Coranna examines her options. She begins to invoke sorcery, wielding the spell called Shadows of the Ancient Past. She speaks the invocation, channelling Essence into a "crystal castle", immaterial, that forms the true form of the spell. Having thus crafted her spell, she channels Essence into it, calling out an illusion of a bygone age to learn more.

The workshop changes. The illusion of antiquity descends over it, and here she can witness the Solar who sleeps here even now, hard at work at his forge. Five daiklaves are nearby; he labors now at the sixth. The ringing sound of his golden hammer makes itself heard, while a cunning array of mirrors - now destroyed by the ruin of the mountain-top - channel a broad, bright shaft of sunlight down onto the forge itself. The books on the shelves are revealed in their fullness. Books of history, of mythology, of sorcery and other arts and lores are here. Books of stories, tales written to amuse men of learning or to instruct the young, are here as well. Tomes of occult wisdom predominate, but they are not the sole occupant. Art-books can be found here too, and other works of the creative spirit.

The Outstretched hand nods to herself. As a matter of caution, she will select those books of sorcery and gather them. Waiting for Wolf Brother, she explains, "These should be hidden, lest someone uncover a way to remind these pages of what they once held." The thought is not a pleasing one, and the risk of even a chance is too great. "We will bury them somewhere out of the way. The rest.." She frowns at the remains of the warstrider, and at the books of craft. She opens her mouth, but does not say what she clearly intended to, as if feeling a sudden push from the threads of fate. "The rest we will leave," she finally says. For a moment, she looks confused and uncertain, but this she swiftly smooths away.

The Lunar nods, and together the two carefully gather up the undisturbed piles of dust that now represent the books on sorcery. There is no such danger of learning sorcery from the metal books that survive.

The books now safely interred out of sight, the Outstretched Hand and Wolf Brother clean up some more of the demons. When all but two are destroyed, the work is considered done. The Outstretched Hand leads the way back out and then settles herself near the tunnel that she will follow with the Solars later. "I hope you are not completely bored. Your next task is far more dull," the sidereal says to the Lunar.

"I've slain two dozen demons, and you haven't once offered me spice-cakes, garlic bread, or anything else," remarks Wolf Brother, balefully, holding a hand to his stomach. "I'm beginning to think you want me to lose."

Coranna draws the mask from her face and arches an eyebrow. "I'm sure while you are scouting this area and keeping all but the Solars away you will have time to hunt," she says evenly. "We want no meddlers. The Solars will come, take what they need, and then leave. I will see to it."

The Lunar shrugs. "Then you will see to it. And I'll see to my mission as well," he says. "But I'll hunt after I perform my duty as guard." He pats his stomach again, casting a glowering eye at his partner. "It's demeaning, but I'd even settle for honey and rice-cakes now."

Coranna lays a little at the Lunar. "Well, I wouldn't stand for that. I can't have you going hungry and bothering me about your grumbling stomach. We will make a deal." At this, she picks up a rock. "I will cast this stone, and you may hunt the quarry and bring it back for both of us. We have some time, after all, and I do not plan on going hungry while I wait on these blundering Solars." At this, the hand of Coranna flicks the rock carelessly out amongst a more densely packed part of the wood, and immediately from it two deer sprint, startled by the sudden noise.

Wolf Brother leaps to his feet, shifting his body into his totem-animal's form and bounding off toward the fleeing prey. He needs no invitation, no time to consider the matter, and his howl can be heard as he relentlessly and joyously indulges his instincts.

Coranna smiles to herself and sets herself to gathering a bit of wood and some dried leaves to start a fire. By the time Wolf Brother returns, she should be ready to cook whatever he brings back for her. "The web tightens," she murmurs to the first spark of the fire. In a few moments, the spark grows to a warmer blaze.

The Lunar returns in time, wearing his human form. Over his shoulders he's got two deer. He sets them down roughly, crouching down and drawing a long and wicked-looking knife from his belt. With expert precision he begins applying his hunter's skills, dressing the game out, humming a melody to himself. "No herbs?" he asks at length.

Coranna smirks and shakes her head. The Sidereal digs into her bag for a moment and produces just the thing. She draws out a few small vials, all carefully sealed. "I'm no hunter," she murmurs, "But I do have some salt and a few other bits I picked-up at.. which village was it? I forget. In any case, I think this will do. Salt, pepper, sage, thyme, a few others. I'm sure you will be quite sated. I thought we might be having a meal.."

Wolf Brother grunts; he's all too used to this sort of thing. His secret weakness is for civilized food, but he has not forgotten his essential nature, nor does he reject it. Compliantly he cooks and seasons venison, staying silent for most of the process. "No ale either, I bet," he adds, sounding depressed.

At this Coranna laughs aloud, "My, but you do need looking after, don't you?" She wrinkles her nose, but she is a provider, and seems to always have just what is needed. This time she draws out a flask of steel. "Now do be careful, it's not ale. It's the finest lightning water to be had in the Hundred Kingdoms." She herself would not risk a taste, but she knows what her friend likes, and when forcing him to do boring tasks she tends to treat her friend.

Wolf Brother accepts this, and venison and drink are had. "It's still not ale, but I like it," is his considered judgement, after several swallows. He continues speaking around a mouthful of food. "You going to wait here for the Solars, or just call upon a spirit?"

"I think I'll wait," says Coranna. "I am.. curious. I need time to think. The return of the Solars is something that I have not thought of nearly enough. I have done my best to stand aside from the schism they have made in the Chosen of the Maidens, but I wonder how long I can do so. They are growing more and more powerful, and the Realm weakens. And the Realm is going to grow weaker still."

"They won't be missed," mumbles Wolf Brother between bites, with a sharklike grin on his face.
