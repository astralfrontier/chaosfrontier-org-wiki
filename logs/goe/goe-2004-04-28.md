# Gods of Eden 2004-04-28

The kingdom of Defiler's Grave is typical of the Hundred Kingdoms in that it is fiercely unique. The nations that make up this diverse, sometimes chaotic, region of the world are the product of seven centuries of infighting and greed mixed with independence and solidarity. "Nobody can conquer the Hundred Kingdoms," it was once said, "not even themselves." This has changed with the advent of the Nation of the Sun, but news of that has yet to travel far beyond its borders.

Chi-Yosh and Ramar have returned to the Nation, their refuge of the moment, and Davron is returning north to bring the mammoths from Yurgen Kaneko into the southlands, in anticipation of the war in Harborhead. Gallius has gone ahead, and so the two men are left to their own devices.

While the battle with the Wyld Hunt was successful, one thing was clear to the Circle. The shape of your tools often influences your performance. Half of the circle yet wields mortal weapons, and several gaps remain in the Circle's armor. With Harborhead looming in the distance, the promise of antiques from the Solars of the First Age is a sirene's call. As Ramar remains in the Nation, making the final shifts of power before their venture Southward, Chi-Yosh seeks the neighbor of Bridal Veil.

Even though the Dawn would prefer to walk, Ramar had insisted one of the Volos be taken. Wittling the time down would allow both Solars to arrive shortly after Gallius finished the Lunar trials. The volo is landed in a small ravine, a wood elemental assuring its' hidden placement after the removal of pests eating at sacred trees. Chi-Yosh enters the capital of Defiler's Grave shortly after, following in the footsteps of Ramar by visiting the lowest places. Ale houses and gambling halls, and the Market of Arms, where men tell tall tales too close to the truth.

Local legends speak of an ancient evil, alternately describing a burning giant or colossus of some kind, and a black-eyed demon whose voice was a vapor that burned the brains of any who heard it. If the stories are to be believed, the mountain called Defiler's Grave was once a volcano, and it belched dark smoke day and night as the sounds of hammering rang through the air. Some whisper that no mere metal was worked on the vast black forge inside, but human souls. An army of light came, and after a great battle, the evil was cast down, and the volcano closed. And so things have stayed, with the nation's guards placing a wary cordon over the narrow and dangerous mountain trails, letting none through.

Legends are the flowers that seeds of truth bare. Chi-Yosh ponders the possibilities of the old days as to what may have happened. A Zenith, once making the mountain their territory, was struck down by the Usurption? Or an actual demon brought down by light, yet the Exalt killed in the process? The pieces have yet to be put together, but the answers lie within the cooled coals of the mountain's heart. Chi-Yosh claims his automon once more, getting a bird's eye view of the place before deciding where and how to continue.

A small indention in the mountain itself proves to be the hiding place for the Volo, below and just out of sight from the door. While suspecting no potential threat, it is always wise to have an escape plan to run to. From there, Chi-Yosh finds the path, and walks with his Caste mark bared towards the boulder-weighted door. The guards attention immediately snaps as they spot the newcommer, and knuckles grow white at the hilts of their swords. "Do not fear!" yells the Anathema as he comes closer. "I have come to make sure the danger that lurks beneath your feet still slumbers. One of my strenght put the demon to sleep; one of mine can keep it there, if it has risen from its' bed."

For the next few minutes, Chi-Yosh busies himself evading attacks from four skilled, dedicated swordsmen. Each is determined, steeled to defend himself, his teammates, and his homeland from whatever horrors might wait inside the tomb. By extension, each also fights against anyone who even seems to threaten the security of the barricade.

There are ways to move between the strikes of a man to make him appear foolish or a novice. And there are ways to evade as though each blow were but a hair away from dealing death. As time ticks by, the threat seems less endangered by the quartet of blades, but it is not offensively expressed, but the slow evidence of something not mortal. As archers' boots are heard not far down the path, the one baring the magical mark speaks since the charge. "Your loyalty is true, your arms are sure, and you continue til your faces are blue with effort." The intruder leaps back, before raising his arms as if signalling surrender. "The watchers of this mountain deem it safe."

"Hold it! Hold it!" screams a voice from down the hill. A scribe, still wearing his robes, is sprinting up the mountain, and as he reaches the pinnacle, he stops, panting for air. The winded guards move to cover him as well, naturally, until he mumbles a string of pass-words to them. They relent, and he withdraws a scroll from his sleeve, presenting it with shaky hands to the guards. "R... request.. for examination of the tomb.. G-granted to Scavenger Lord and.. and.. sun-god guest.." One of the guards extends a hand, takes the scroll, and reads it over with wary, suspicious eyes.

"Why weren't we notified?" asks the guard, still sounding on edge. "And why didn't this man announce himself? Why didn't we get a signal from the outpost below?" The scribe only shakes his head, drawing beads of perspiration from his forehead with one sleeve. "My.. my fault," he gasps. "Can't see how I... overlooked it.. won't happen... again." And wearily, this hapless bureaucrat turns, shuffling down the mountainside. The pack of archers two hundred yards distant stand down as well.

Chi-Yosh turns to one of the guards, sigh a held breath of relief. He knows that something had turned in his favor, either the strings of fate being played like a harp, or someone else thinking ahead. "I am also sorry; I had thought you were warned ahead, and would be expecting me, so I did not explain. Once you charged, I knew something was wrong. I simply saying 'I mean you no harm' would not have stayed your sword."

The lead guard grunts, though he does not sheath his weapon. "You may be god-blooded, or a true spirit, as they say," he replies. "If so, I may be blasted down for saying this, but we have a duty, and we must do it, no matter what."

Chi-Yosh merely nods. "Such loyalty to any cause is a merit to be admired." Though now, the Dawn wonders what the message had declared.

A woman in threadbare robes is making her way up just as the scribe did, if not so swiftly. She seems to only partially heed where she goes, reading a tattered and worn book in her right hand. About her feet dances a grey cat, which, like her, looks somewhat the worse for wear, being rail thin and having lost its fur in several spots.

Cloudburst doesn't look up until she is nearly on top of the guards. With a thump the book in her hand closes, sending up a cloud of dust. "Now.. where was it," she murmurs to herself. "Ahh, yes, of course!" She reaches into a weather-stained bag that hangs at her hip and draws out a scroll. "I believe I was announced?" she says, offering the paper to the guard leader.

Chi-Yosh watches as the woman walks up the trail. First the scribe, then... a suspicion rises in the Dawn; could this be the one that the scribe intended to bring forward? If that's the case, then she... For now, the Solar stands aside and watches. He's caused enough trouble just yet.

The guards peer at the second scroll, then at the newcomer. "Something's amiss here," remarks one, rather pointedly, but makes nothing further of it. The credentials are returned without incident, and the guards return to their station.

For a time, Cloudburst just watches the guards go and for just as long a time she stares at Chi-Yosh. "Well, now that that is settled, let's have a look, shall we?" she suggests briskly.

Chi-Yosh offers a smile to the woman, and gestures towards the guards at their post. "met is your papers which they will answer to. Perhaps they will listen to you more then they would me."

Cloudburst blinks at Chi-Yosh in confusion for a time, then nods. "Of course. Well, let's see.." She sets off, setting a pace and leading not to the tomb entrance, but on a line that will lead a ways away from it. In a soft voice, Cloudburst says to Chi-Yosh, "I saw you up there." She points up at the sky, "And thought you might be useful."

"Ah." Sidling beside the woman, a reassured smile creeps into his features. "I could say the same for you, after the fact. I am Chi-Yosh," he informs, while he becomes aware of their path, looking where they are headed, then back towards the sealed door.

"My name is Cloudburst," says the woman. "And this is Master Greywind," she adds, indicating that cat. "I imagine you are here to rob the tomb, yes?" At this, she offers a toothy grin to Chi-Yosh. "You are a strange one, though. Very strange. Do you always speak with the guards you ought to be trying to avoid?"

"Master Greywind," Chi-Yosh repeats, and honors the feline with a polite nod of the head. "Rob is... an inappropriate word. I came to reclaim the past." This twist is accompanied with a sly smile, which bleeds into sheepishness. "Sometimes, who you are opens doors. Others, it closes. Especially when you headbutt the door."

"A most curious approach," says Cloudburst. "In any case, I suggest you be more circumspect. There are, after all, other things to consider, yes? The front door is the most guarded, but the back gate still gets you inside, does it not?" There's a strong hint of amusement in her questions, of course.

Chi-Yosh chuckles, more about himself then anything. "I did not know there was a back entrance. I did not ask the right sources." He merely asked the tales that surrounded the mountain, and looked down from above; not thorough research, in the least. Even the spirits may have been a better source to seek then boasting tales.

Cloudburst pauses mid-step, then settles on her feet and turns to look Chi-Yosh up and down. "You are who I think you are, yes? I have no time for fools, and what is ahead will kill a normal man, else I'd have done this already." She crosses her arms, still holding that dusty book. "Can you handle this?" she asks plainly.

"Yes." The declaration comes with a brief pause, as the Dawn looks towards the mountain, as though he were trying to peer through the stone to what lies beneath. "If I can not handle this, then I am better to find out now, then to fail at what lies beyond this grave." He looks back, just as blunt. "You think you know who I am, but I have only an inkling as to who you are.

"Good," says Cloudburst, and it's unclear as to which part she is speaking. "I am quite curious, though, why you went to the guards. You are one of the sun-gods, and here you are feared and yet.." She trails off to silence. "No matter, I suppose. Let us find the way. Best to do this before night falls. The guards might grow suspicious. I'm uncertain how long my coin will buy away their wariness."

Cloudburst stands, waiting for Chi-Yosh for a time. Seeing him just standing there, though, she sighs and turns, setting a harder pace. She stops abruptly and gestures at her feet, "Just as I had heard. Others have been here, but if they did not take anything out. Oh no. Not a thing." The grin she turns on Chi-Yosh is far from pleasant. "Not so much as a sliver of jade for all their trouble."

At the feet of Cloudburst is a hole. Far from a proper entrance, it seems to have been cut for some other purpose. A purpose that the guards likely know nothing of. It goes at a sharp slope down into darkness. "This was a volcano," Cloudburst says, as if that were clear enough explanation.

Chi-Yosh crouches down, to inspect the hole itself. He nudges around the hole, noting the once smooth layers of rock that circles the hole; dripping water from rains on the side of the mountain have only weathered one part of the hole's wall. "The view from above showed the mountain's top having sunk inwards."

Cloudburst nods. "Indeed. There are many hollow places in this mountain," she says. "There were lava floes here, once. Now many empty tubes wind through the bowels of the mountain. Some, naturally, not far from the tomb." She looks from Chi-Yosh to the hole, then, expectantly.

Chi-Yosh takes the cue. Reaching forward, he pries a sturdy rock from the hard soil, and draws close to the hole, while rolling the stone through the air. The echo should give an impression of how far down the hole goes before some kind of bottom, or if anything might be nesting just below the light's piercing veil.

The rock strikes shallow just beyond the darkness. With little prompting, the Dawn grasps the hole's edge and drops downward, the tube briefly sloping before emptying into a short drop. His Anima flares up, a shining beacon in the darkness.

The lava-tube is cramped and claustrophobic. Its uneven edges and jagged spars suggest a time when the heated blood of the earth poured here, stopping and solidifying as ages passed. The surface is almost glassy, with a dusty layer and a strange texture.

Cloudburst and her cat both make the trip down into the lava-tube. She shies away from the bright light Chi-Yosh sheds, but is clearly none too eager to move into greater darkness. "We'll find out if the rest of the tale is true soon enough," she murmurs. Her voice is nearly swallowed by the thick air of the shaft, though, so that Chi-Yosh can barely hear her.

Through the tube, and up, the two crawl. They emerge into a long corridor, shaped of cut stone, and leading out through a circular doorway into a larger chamber.

Chi-Yosh is reminded of the Manse where Stormclouds at Dusk had been discovered, and the Cynis temple. The place is not the same, but there is potential for similarities. Upon listening closely within the hall, senses alert also for signs of magical warning, the Solar presses forward through the doorway.

The interior of the mountain suggests open space as much as possible. Shafts of rock have been carved into columns of delicate and intricate workmanship that seem to support the ceiling. Lamps of everburning Essence burn brightly in stone replicates of wall-socketed torches. Overhead, the black of the ceiling is dimly lit by faint flickers of Essence, made to resemble a starry sky. The doorways between chambers are wide and circular, stylized to resemble the Caste Marks of the Solar Exalted. Doorways to specific rooms bear appropriate Caste Marks - a room that once held books on its shelves, for example, is shaped like the Twilight mark.

There is a central elevator system, also powered by Essence. It is far more sophisticated than the one in Nane, which was wholly mechanical in nature. This mechanism has survived the intervening centuries almost entirely intact. A wide shaft cuts up and down through the stone, and a flat disc rests apparently unsupported at the center. A globe of stunning crystal rests on a rod jutting from the center.

"Indeed, as I heard. This must be the interior of the tomb," says Cloudburst softly. The sickly cat sniffs for a moment, then curls around her ankles lazily. The scholar opens her book, studying it carefully.

Chi-Yosh surveys the work, reminded once more of Manses; the harnessing of local Essence to fuel aspects of the crypt, such as the lamps. No doubt the same could be for traps and waiting summons. Pausing to survey the elevator with suspicion before stepping out onto it, "What is the real story behind this resting place of Sun gods once ago?"

"Like most tombs, it was made not so much to keep people out, but to keep something in," says Cloudburst. "Powerful spirits, as dangerous as anything I've ever seen," she explains. "We dare not rouse the one buried here, but perhaps there are hints here on how to avoid angering this spirit and still get what we came here for. Ghosts are dangerous enemies."

Chi-Yosh finds no instructions labeled around the disk. Then again, there shouldn't be. His hand lays upon the crystal sphere in the center, a sense of warmth finding his hand, like the glow of a candle. His first instinct is to give a direction, but the Solar's hand draws away. "Please, join me. I would hate to be seperated here."

Cloudburst looks at Chi-Yosh for a moment, as if considering the wisdom of this. After a moment, though, she steps upon the platform beside him, joined immediately by her cat. "You have no idea what you are doing," she says. It is not a question.

The Solar rests his hand on the crystal, willing it to move down. And so it does, obediently drifting down through the bowels of the mountain for hundreds of feet. It stops, several moments later.

The bottom-most level is enormous. Three sets of metal rails run in parallel across the stone floor, apparently connected by several switch-points. A four-wheeled steel wagon rests atop one set of rails, apparently able only to move where they run. It looks immensely sturdy. Pipes, carrying water and other possible substances, are securely bolted to the stone walls.

There are eight alcoves on one side of the chamber. All of them have cat-walks and other, stranger accoutrements, and Chi-Yosh recalls many of these accessories from Prowler's refuge, where his warstrider was kept. Most importantly of all, the Solar can see a warstrider itself - or at least, three pieces of one. Each piece is supported by chains hung from wheeled runners embedded into an overhead gantry. It seems likely that they can be moved about easily, via the runners, though much work would be required to repair the thing.

The strider itself is massive, a knight of gold and white gleaming with the sparkle of orichalcum and proof against the dust and signs of age that mar the rest of the chamber. The quality of artistry is self-evident; this mechanical armor was as much the product of a highly advanced aesthetic as it was an engine of war. The massive gauntlets are delicately textured for even the finest work. The arms, seemingly encased in stylized and sculpted plate-armor, reveal signs of musculature that suggest the human form without actually duplicating it.

The level above the grand hall of stars is a workshop, or a set of connected rooms serving different functions under the aegis of craftsmanship. Most notably, there is a chamber dominated by a forge and anvil, with orichalcum and adamantine instruments such as hammers and chisels.

There is an armory, adjacent to the main workshop, whose doorway is naturally the Dawn Caste's symbol. Weapons broken by the weight of age are on racks and display here; nothing seems particularly usable. In another room, reserves of steel ingots, and a few precious bars of orichalcum, can be found. Also on display are six daiklaves, in various states of completion, each set on its own marble rack, and each accompanied by a leather-bound booklet resting atop it at an angle. Monochrome ribbons are attached to the binding of each booklet, apparently to serve as bookmarks.

Below, the magnificence of the Warstrider must remain until it can be retreived. Here, the items are more easily removed. Chi-Yosh still moves through the workshops with an appraising eye, taking in the once detailed weapons which are now rust and dust eaten. The shining bars of orichalcum are noted - Davron will find them preciously useful. Yet the daiklaves draw his attention, the detail in some, and one in particular he regards, noting the Essence inlayed is nearly complete. The books at the base of each are regarded with cautious curiousity, their purpose inspected.

Each of the booklets is a dedication to the weapon on which it rests, written in the poetic verse of the Old Realm. Each names its respective weapon, and speaks of the great battles and glorious deeds the blades may find themselves put to. Here, too, are hints on the identities of those Solars the weapons were once intended for; all, presumably, now long-dead and without further claim to the tools of war that lay here unused.

Cloudburst looks over the room slowly. She muses over the tools and daiklaves both. "Well, not the best condition, but still worth a fair bit. I drive a very hard bargain, sometimes." She muses further, "And yet, I bet with those tools I could nearly finish this work with my own hands. Unless I miss my guess, the one buried here was a great builder, his tools likely remember well his hands, though the years are long."

Chi-Yosh removes from the rack the nearly finished Daiklave, a mighty heft, but a beautiful weapon none the less. Eyes roving over the tools long neglected, he smiles to himself. "Before we leave, I would not mind filling the last gaps in this one..." After several moments, he turns to the woman. "And I have a deal for you."

Chi-Yosh gestures towards the daiklaves. "These great craft are not finished, but I know a Sun God who is a master smith, and could finish the job soon. Five Daiklaves set for sale would fetch a fare price, no matter they are orichalcum. The bars, I would like. There is one more thing of use: the books there. While they are accounts of what these swords should do, they may also bare clues of past Solars, which might hint at more lost history."

"The daiklaves," murmurs Cloudburst, and she actually smirks. "Indeed, I imagine they would fetch a fair price." She shakes her head, "However, that is of little concern. What lies below.. that is of value to those I deal with. If I get that for them, I will live like a King, as will all my heirs. A few swords are no match for that." She smiles to herself, "And I will have a library to rival the greatest private collections in all of Creation."

Chi-Yosh clucks his tongue. "We shall see." He feels as though he is in a losing battle, for the Warstrider would benefit the Nation, the Solar's cause, greatly. But, he has little to bargain with her for. Either way, there is no need to concern over it now. "There is one place we have not seen. Though I hesitate to go there."

"I doubt the body is further up," says Cloudburst softly. "If you fear something, you do not keep it near the surface. No, I imagine the one who is entombed here is safely tucked away somewhere else. And if fate is kind, none shall disturb it."

A moment's reflection on Chi-Yosh's part recalls to mind a section of corridor on the larger level, the one below the workshop. It's possible that something was closed off there, and cunningly hidden away - the burial chamber, perhaps. If so, then there is little to fear, as long as one does not blindly smash stone walls in search of treasure.

Chi-Yosh gives a final nod. "Good point. Then let us see what marvels await us at the hight of this inner tower." Leaving the Daiklave to wait for now, the Solar leads the Scavanger Lord to the disk. Laying his hand on the crystal, they are upward bound.

The uppermost level is an enormous refinery, with channels that apparently pumped lava at one time. There is an apparatus at the center, now smashed but potentially fixable, that Chi-Yosh recognizes as part of the transmutation process for turning gold into orichalcum. No such operation is possible now, for the sun's light, so vital to the process, cannot penetrate the yards of stone overhead.

"Quite curious," says Cloudburst. She looks around for a moment and frowns. "Well, there seems nothing of use here. Still, it is not such a bad haul, now is it? I think my investments may well prove to be handled nicely," she explains. "That scribe surely has no debts left," she mutters.

"With the proper maintenance, this place could once more be alive with the creation of Artifacts." The knowledge of this place alone could be worth it for the Dragon-Blooded, but Davron will be made aware. "I never thanked you," He says offhandedly, turning back towards the elevator. "Even if it were in your best of interests, it helped avoid an international issue."

"Such things are of no use in trade," says Cloudburst. "Besides, this northern kingdom of yours.. the Nation of the Sun, I heard it called, yes? I might find trade there, perhaps. You know, there's a great deal of money to be made in such places."

Chi-Yosh's hand hovers above the crystal, waiting on Cloudburst to follow. "There is great trade to be made, yes. Even without the great knight below, there would be great benefits in dealing with us." When the woman and cat climb aboard, he drops his hand, willing them down to the next level. "This tomb is merely the first, and what we have found will be dwarfed by the contents of the Nexus tombs I seek next." Glancing at the woman sidelong, "One who knows the way of such places would be highly valuable to somoene who knows not what they're doing."

Cloudburst reaches down to scratch the grey cat behind its left ear and nods. "Go on," she says simply. There's a hint of expectation in her voice, as well as amusement in the slight curve of her lips.

"The grand suit promises you a comfortable life in luxury, no matter where you go. You all ready have an offer to sprawl within the Nation," the Dawn says as the platform descends, "For such a weapon would aid our cause greatly. But, to have security of your home and your funds - a steady influx of jade - would be wiser. That could be promised by the continuation of your work, investigating the tombs of Nexus and then some, for the Nation of the Sun. Even the smallest tasks, such as getting the Council to allow the Sun Gods to display their power to get into the tombs themselves would be worth your weight in silver."

Cloudburst arches an eyebrow as she straightens once more. "Yes, it is a weapon unmatched. I imagine with it the Realm would give me a title, perhaps I would be adopted into a great house. Or better still, made a curator at the Imperial Library. I would never have want of jade there." She watches Chi-Yosh curiously, wondering what he might offer.

The Essence-driven lift comes to a stop on the workshop level. "Indeed, you could." Several moments tick by as he draws towards the Dawn Caste door. "If that's your plan, I would think of your job security. Given how the currents of the world are moving, the Realm may not stand within five, ten years." His brow raising towards the woman, "I recall you mentioned wanting a good place for your heirs. And while it may not compare to the Imperial Library, the administrative head of the Sun's Radiane Eldrich University would not be too shabby."

"That's a remarkably long title," says Cloudburst. "What exactly does it mean?" She is listening, and her interest is piqued.

Chi-Yosh returns once more to the forge where the unfinished Daiklaves wait. "One of the reasons I will be seeking to reclaim the past," this said with an idle turn of his lips, "Is the pursuit of First Age knowledge, of Occult power. I am going to create a college, amassing this knowledge, along side information of spirits, and power that the mortal man can reach. I hope to bring in mortal, Dragon-Blooded, and all in between."

"And you are offering me a position at the head of this college that you will make, then?" asks Cloudburst. "You sun-gods are a curious lot. And yet none but a fool can deny that the wind is changing."

"And you are a wise and capable woman," retorts the Solar. "Someone who can weave through old tombs and the administrative channels would be a great boon for my plans, for our plans. The offer of comfort and leisure, of power and prestige is held in my open hand, Cloudburst."

"Very well, then," says Cloudburst. "We will take these things from this place to your Nation and we will then make plans for what must follow." The scholar smiles and taps her lip, "Yes, a university would be a comfortable place to spend my time. And in time I might not have to dirty my hands with this work myself. In any case, we should take what we can and make our way out of here. The removal of the larger objects will need some more careful planning."

Chi-Yosh says, "Agreed." Glancing down at the blade before him, "But first, this requires some refinishing; I have the perfect place for it. It should not take but a few minutes." Said over his shoulder as he prepares, "Have you ever flown before?"

"Once or twice," says Cloudburst. "On an airship. It was a long time ago," she explains. She arches an eyebrow at Chi-Yosh and asks, "Are you a craftsman, as well?"

The Solar selects his tools, guided by instinct and intuition, and carries the nearly-complete blade to the forge. There, in the flickering light of the Essence-torches, he works, slipping an orichalcum setting-piece into the missing socket awaiting it. The process is interrupted by two things, both happening almost simultaneously: the wail of Cloudburst from behind him, and a terrible feeling of sharp claws raking across his back. The suddenness of the attack shocks him into an awareness of the pungent odor in the forge, one he immediately recognizes from the Guild's airship: erymanthoi, or the blood-apes, a variety of demon.

Wheeling around, Essence blooms in a radiant burst around the Dawn as he seeks to evade the seeking claws of the demons. One misses him, but the second tears a gash across his chest. A leap puts one of the Blood Apes between its' brother and the Solar, a shield for only the moments it takes for the explosion of curved blades to carve through it, before the Solar strikes the second. Its' escape is only momentary, the grunting, crouching beast ducking aside, only to once more be brought beneath seeking, tearing weapons. It shrinks away, then roars as they score blood, but powerful arms are no defense from the fury that is Chi-Yosh, and it soon withers upon the floor into silence.

Chi-Yosh turns, then, and spots the broken woman on the floor. A leather cord within the Solar's jerkin holds the stone gifted to him from from the trip to Greyfalls, and this is yanked into his hand as he rushes over. One hand falls upon her greatest wound, while the other holds up the stone. Waves of heat, then cold rush through the Scavanger Lord, painful, then numbing. The same drags through the Solar, as bones crinkle and flesh tears, the minor wound on his chest becoming something more threatening. But she once more draws a healthy breath, and he still stands.

Carefully, Chi-Yosh staggers back to the forge, and finishes uniting the orichalcum setting with the weapon it's meant for. A brief prayer to the Unconquered Sun, and he raises the weapon experimentally. At last it feels complete, shimmering slightly in the light of the Essence-driven torches. Its name is Swift South Wind, according to the poetic verses that lay with it.

Chi-Yosh admires the blade, its sleek curve not unlike the blade Ramar carries. And while the weapon is different, the Dawn can see it used with the man's style. A present for his Eclipse friend, and the name proves fitting, seeing their destination soon. The book is claimed for Ramar's reading, and everything else for the time is left to be carried when there is less bleeding.

Cloudburst carries out a few things, as well. Anything small and manageable. It is her turn to support Chi-Yosh. There is no more talk of deals or negotiations over treasure. She does explain to Chi-Yosh that she has a plan for getting the great war strider away from here. "Sun-gods are capable of negotiating with elementals. If we were to make a tunnel under the earth it would be far easier than trying to bring anything of this treasure above it, yes? It will take some doing. Such a powerful elemental will surely need a fair bribe, but it is easiest and will draw no attention. And if you wish to ever make use of this place directly, coming unseen would be best."
