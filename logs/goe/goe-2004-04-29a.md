# Gods of Eden 2004-04-29a

In characteristically calm fashion, Chi-Yosh delivers his present, and begins making preparations to set sail for the deep South, where Gallius and others await Ramar and himself. Arriving in his chambers in Bridal Veil, the temporary headquarters of the Solar campaign, Ramar finds nothing more than a daiklave, resting atop a wooden sword-stand, along with a booklet of verse and a note: 'Come to the sky-ship.'

Carrying this new gift, Ramar joins his friend. The two begin the journey toward the line of volcanic mountains and blasted deserts that mark the southern borders of existence. The traveler has questions; the warrior has a tale. And thus does time pass.

Guided by an old songline, related to Chi-Yosh from Gallius via the shimmering messenger of Essence her No Moon mentor summoned, the sky-ship makes good time. Miles flow as freely as talk, though as the desert heat grows fierce and insistent, and beads of sweat burn down the cheeks of both men despite their best preparations, talk is abandoned; the water of their bodies must be kept for more important things than speech. And so the sky-ship lands gently, near an oasis in the deep South. Gallius, as well as Tamuz and a tattooed woman, are there to greet it.

Chi-Yosh has never experienced such an inferno that is the harsh glare of Helios's unyielding gaze. The sands sift under the Solar's feet as he approaches the Oasis, and every bit of him wishes to dive into the cool waters. But that can wait, for the Lunars and Gallius awaits, with expectation. Pausing before the three, the Dawn offers forth a bow of greeting to their great Lunar patrons, and a smile that promises good news to Gallius.

Still puzzling over the tale of how he's come by his new gift, Ramar exits the ship. He smiles, and bows his head in greeting as he disembarks. "Greetings," he says, as the smile turns into the faintest hint of a grin. "Feels like home." He walks towards the oasis and fills his water-gourd. A moment later and he's joined the group, "There is much to be said."

Gallius, whose skin has swiftly taken on a much darker shade, bows to her friends in turn. "I am glad you came so swiftly. Time is always short for us." Decorum lasts for another moment, and then she moves embrace her friends. "It is good to see you well."

Tamuz turns silently to the woman beside him, who tilts her head in curious inspection. "I am Luluri," she announces, "No Moon. You were initiated in the Lunar rites by Erisus?"

Chi-Yosh is careful not to squeeze the Zenith too hard; no telling what toll the sun has taken upon her skin. "Your trials fared well." She's alive, that much is testiment to their success. Gazing at the mark drawn upon her brow, "Though I never would have suspected the mantle of the Trickster." His attention turns to Luluri. "Y... yes. I have only heard his first name spoken once. He is... a guarded man."

"The desert air has done wonders for you, Lady Gallius. There's nothing quite like it you know..." Ramar seems to actually be enjoying the blistering sun. Or at least the fact that it's there. He does sort of keep to the shade, where such shade exists. "I am glad to see you are doing well..." He then turns towards Tamuz and Luluri. "Yes. We were."

"It was shoddy workmanship," concludes the No Moon, coolly. "Call a spirit of the Pact here, if you deny it. Otherwise, we shall begin with the essentials, and you will be trained properly."

Gallius turns back to Tamuz and Luluri, listening closely and waiting. She has learned a great deal these past couple days, but still has much to learn. Too many questions. It seems her friends, too, have much to learn.

"Trained properly?" Ramar can't help but chuckle as he glances around. _I wonder... training in the desert... it might be interesting to be able to teach someone else, for once. Though it is likely they know much that I do not._ "I look forward to learning, then."

"Very well," mumbles the woman, and guides the way to the oasis. "You three have not been taught about the Brotherhood of Lake and River. It is the name of a Charm that Lunars learn," she says, as she walks across the hot sand. "But it is also the name of a pact of spirits. When the Celestial Bureaucracy crumbled - when you, the Solars, failed the world, I mean - there was chaos in Heaven. We, the Lunars who came to the edges of the world, we built our own hierarchy, but not a bureaucracy. Not a failed structure of control, but a brotherhood of spirit, god, Exalt and mortal man, which we call the Brotherhood of Lake and River."

Gallius listens closely and nods her head. She will say nothing yet. She has learned that asking questions prematurely wastes valuable time. For now, she is focused on the words of the Lunars.

"There are spirits who will follow you, and take you the tales of other Lunars, and take your tales to others. They are not under your control; if you exert your authority on them, you will lose face among us." Luluri stops at the oasis, and bends down, touching the waters with a fingertip. Ripples slowly flow over the surface. "The greater your impact on the world, the wider your tales will spread. Your power among the Lunars is your reputation. No matter what Charms you know, no matter the magic you wield or the forces you command, strength without honor is meaningless. Acquiring strength is your own responsibility; but word of your honor will spread throughout us through these spirits, and through your boasts to your fellows."

"I will teach you how to see and know these spirits," the woman says, turning and rising from her crouch. "But first, if anything troubles you, speak now."

"What troubles me is what has since I first understood my change," says Gallius. "I believe that what was must not be as it was, or we shall fall again. I would hear all I can of the old ways of my kind, so I can find us a new destiny. It is also my belief that this new way must understand the values of the Silver Way. But perhaps this is not the time for long conversation."

Chi-Yosh merely nods to himself. In many ways, the Lunar path is something that is more resonate within him. Rather than pay homage to one with the might of arm, they pay homage to the one who is might in deed. It is said that to know a man is to know his actions, and what is said of him. In many ways, the Lunars know the measure of one far better than the courts ever may.

"I can think of nothing that troubles me now, save for the question... why do you say that our training has been... Shoddy Workmanship?" Ramar explains, "It is not that I doubt you, I am simply curious to know why."

"Your inability to summon a spirit of the Pact, a basic function of any Lunar, proves it," states the woman, flatly.

Luluri frowns. "Each of you must know the Silver Way, at least. It is the Path of Virtue, the one we have always followed. Never flee; never surrender. Repay your debts. Be just and generous to those beneath you. Slay not your brothers and sisters. Defend what is yours. Honor your word to the deserving. The spirits that make up the Brotherhood of Lake and River will not task you to do these things; if you needed prompting, you would be unworthy already. But they will bear witness when you uphold the Way. Now, watch."

Luluri begans describing a symbol in the soil of the oasis. It is a simple message, written in Claw-Speak, with an equivalent translation in the script of the Old Realm below each mark: "Those who listen must now speak." She stands back. Slowly a spirit begins to materialize, a strange and bird-like humanoid. _I come, No Moon._ The woman inclines her head, then points at the three Solars. "Recognize them as nain-ya," she directs. The spirit bows itself, feathers rustling in the desert breeze. _I so recognize._

"You can call such spirits now?" asks Luluri, curiously.

"Er... can we?" asks Ramar, rather curiously, "I uhm, thought we couldn't... but if all it takes is the Claw-Speak mark..."

Gallius looks askance at Ramar and tries to conceal a grin with only a little success. "I imagine we can now that we know the script," she assures.

Ramar considers this for a moment. "I imagine so..." He raises a curious eyebrow at Gallius, then commits the script to memory. "Then to answer your question," he replies, "Yes."

Chi-Yosh dedicates the symbol to memory. Prowler had taught he and Ramar at least how to interpret Claw Speak. His knowledge of the spirits is growing; all the better, for the coming months. "Can the Silver Pact spirits be messangers? Not of notes between Lunar, but more sophisticated for declaring territory or learning about a Lunar than claw speak?"

"They can carry messages, yes. But do not ask them for trivial things. Whatever message you send should be worthy of the effort required."

"Very well. That is the first thing you must know." Luluri allows a faint smile. "You Solars are difficult creatures, but not bad ones, nor flawed, nor weak." She squats down on the ground of the oasis, inviting her charges to join her. "Now, I will tell you about the forging of the world..."

---

After hearing the bare minimum of what she must know, Gallius has many questions that are a bit more detailed. "I have met many Lunars, and each seems to have their own race of beastmen," she begins. "These men and women are stronger, more able to survive hardship. I will be striving against powerful armies, not all of them will be mortals. I will have a great need of superior forces who can stand against even the unliving and show no fear. Are all followers of the Silver Way able to create beastmen? And if so, when do they get the right to do so?"

"All Lunars are capable of siring beast-men," replies Luluri. "It is an ability of the body, not the heart. The right? The Way does not dictate it. Only that if you sire beast-men that you treat them with generosity and honor, if you intend to be their master."

"Hmmm." Gallius seems troubled for a time. "If that is the case, I can understand that being allowed to lead the beast-men of another would be like stealing their children." The Solar frowns in thought. "Then it shall be as it is, though I fear more of my people will die for the victory."

"Then you misunderstand," retorts Luluri, sounding harsh. "You send the sons and daughters of another into your wars, and they march under your banner, either willingly or not. The beast-man tribes are sired by a Lunar, it is true. But that alone gives no right. Each tribe swears itself to whoever it sees fit. A tribe that knows honor will respect its sire first. That sire may have no interest in being their god; or he may give his authority over them to another. do you understand?"

"So the people are still free," says Gallius. "But I have met these beastmen, and the Lunars who sired many of them. I imagine I just wish to have my own to claim and earn the loyalty of." She thinks for a moment, "But since that cannot be, I must look to other solutions. Time is ever against me. Years I have, but Creation does not."

"I have heard of your Nation," replies Luluri. "You have done in three turnings of the moon what takes a Lunar a hundred years to accomplish by breeding. I find no fault with your methods."

"You honor me," says Gallius, nodding her head deeply. "But if it were not for the Lunars, the world would be lost to the Wyld already. The Silver Way has stood almost alone against the madness for a very long time. It is time for the Golden Way to join you again. Only this time, my people will remember their place better. I just wonder about those ancient days."

"I have told you of the making of the world, and some little hint of the First Age, and of the overthrow of the Solar tyrants," says Luluri. "These things I find good for you to know. But ask what you will of other matters, and I may answer."

Chi-Yosh has sat aside for some time in silence, listening. As the line of questions have journeyed, his path of thinking has been on Weeping Prowler. When a pause presents itself, he claims it. "Is there a way to change Erisus? He has done poorly in educating us in the Silver Way; in other areas, he has likely neglected. I have sought the spark of the mate which he destroyed, the one which has him sleeping while his beastmen tend to themselves. Is there a way to stir him from his sulking, or would that be stepping on the tail of an Elder?"

"Chi-Yosh, your pursuit of the Solar dream is foolish," says Luluri, calmly. "It's a waste of your time to pursue the salvation of a world that doesn't want you, and fears you unless you bend their wills with your magic." She pauses, to let her words sink in, then continues. "That is merely for your instruction. If you are wiser than another, you are right to correct them. If you are not, then hold your tongue, because if you do not speak wisdom, it will sound offensive and insulting."

Chi-Yosh sighs inwardly. He is supposed to know that. And he can see the side of Erisus's, that of heartache. But the Solar's vision is tinted to one of progress, and he cannot help but wish that for Prowler. But to do so is to push his own will upon the Lunar who is his Elder in far too many ways for he to push such upon the man. The Solar only nods in response.

Gallius slips off into her own thoughts. Prowler is something to be handled in due time. Among so many other things. Too many things. "I need to learn more of the First Age," she decides. "The Solars failed, but few are very clear how we fell into evil. I rather doubt it happened in the span of a few minutes, or even in a day. I need to know everything I can."

"The Solars simply ceased to care for the welfare of the mortals beneath them," replies the No Moon, softly. "They abandoned their duty as protectors, and embraced their role as gods. That is a consequence of holding power. It is clear to me because I was raised in the Way, where strength without honor is meaningless."

"But yet it was not the mortals that tore us down," says Gallius. She frowns in thought, "Yet we are taking the Dragon Bloods to task, slowly but surely returning them to the way of the past. They are making the very same mistake, it seems."

"Everybody in power makes that mistake," replies Luluri calmly. "The gods overthrew the Primordials. The Dragon-Blooded overthrew the Solars. And now the remnants of the Celestial Host from the First Age are preparing to overthrow the Dragon-Blooded in return. Only two of the ancient powers have escaped this cycle of violence, and one is now beyond it entirely."

"Why did the gods overthrow the Primordials?" asks Gallius. "I have heard something of it, but I am still curious. Did men fight in that war?"

"Luna tells us that it was to gain freedom, to keep the Primordials from destroying what they had created," she says. "The Exalted were the champions of men. The champions of the gods fought too, and those of other beings who once walked these lands. Men could not fight directly; even the Exalted died in great numbers."

"And the Primordials stood alone against all of Creation?" asks Gallius. "I imagine there must have been some who cleaved to them. That would explain much, were it true."

"Their champions were those called the demons," says Luluri. "No creature of fate would willingly hew to those who sought to destroy them and everything in their existence. I know not how the Fair Folk stood in that time, or even if they existed.." She thinks slowly. "You seek knowledge of the very earliest days, I perceive. You cannot understand how the Solars could have fallen from grace, do you. You cannot see how they could fall. Perhaps seeing it from the beginning would aid you."

"All I know is that power is a dangerous thing," says Gallius. "Power can destroy a soul. I would have thought that those Chosen would have been better selected."

Luluri laughs. "You cannot select saints, if they do not exist," she suggests. "The Exalted were mighty, but not paragons of virtue. They were just those who.. " The Lunar struggles for words. "They simply wanted to live. They hungered for life. That is all. In those who the flame burned brightest, the gods gave their sparks."

"The gift was too much for us, then," says Gallius. "But what can we do, when our strength is too weak to handle the gists we were given?" She frowns deeply. "It matters not. We must find a way, then. How were the Primordials defeated, if they were the makers of all things?"

The Lunar mentor begins scratching marks on the ground, indicating concentric rings and tracing symbols around them. "This represents the hierarchy of the Primordials' power. These are the demons of the Third Circle, so called because the spell to summon them is of the Third Circle of sorcery, the Solar Circle. Here, the demons of the Second, and the First.. In the same way that a flower is stem, petals, and roots, a Primordial is comprised of parts which define it. Pluck the petals of a flower and it lacks its beauty. Pluck it up by the roots, and it will die. So too may you destroy a lesser part of the Primordials, to change their nature, make them something lesser, to weaken them.."

"And here, the nature of the Exalted." She draws several rings, connected by lines to a single larger source. "The destruction of one Exalt does not harm the patron god that Exalted him. That is the strength of the system. It is also its weakness, as you have seen - nothing binds the Exalted into the service of their patron except their own will to serve. You honor Helios through your service; we honor Luna likewise. The Dragon-Blooded, some say, have abandoned their gods, and I will admit that even some Lunars have forsaken their proper path, to become chimerae, or worse."

"This would seem to indicate that the Primordials can be utterly slain," says Gallius. "And yet they made everything. But they did not make us. Did they create anything, save the Gods and those who came to be Demons?"

"This is beyond my lore," confesses Luluri. "I am told that they created all that exists, save themselves, even the gods, and that the gods were forced to create the Exalted in order to wage war upon their makers."

"You mentioned that some escaped the cycle of violence. Who are they?" asks Gallius. "And how did they avoid becoming entangled in the the same circle that binds so many of us?"

"The first group is the greater gods themselves. They have never been overthrown by the Exalted; they alone have shown enough wisdom not to be usurped by their lessers. The second are those we Lunars call the Bygones. Those that human scholars call the Dragon Kings, whose faded shadows lurk in the ruins of Rathess, are among them. There are other, stranger creatures, who taught the Exalted much, but we have no great lore of them. Perhaps great Leviathan alone remembers them."

Gallius looks thoughtful for a time, thinking to herself. "You said these Dragon Kings can be found in Rathess. If they are wise enough to avoid the web that has bound us all, then perhaps they might share their knowledge. Surely even the Solars can emulate them and overcome our limitations. Would you advise I seek the counsel of Leviathan first, however? And who is Leviathan?"

"They were wise, or perhaps lost to despair. You would not seek to emulate them, I think. Their souls are gone from them. The true Dragon Kings are no more; only their bodies survive." Luluri speaks more quietly now, with a tone of reverence. "Leviathan is the greatest among us, recognized by Luna herself, he who swims in the quiet Western waters. He is the oldest living Lunar. On his word we would slay ourselves, or overrun the Blessed Isle, regardless of losses."

"If the Dragon Kings remain, then there must be some way to restore them. If we are to free ourselves, all must stand together as they did so very long ago." Gallius sighs softly. "Rathess. The burden of the past is a heavy one. But carrying it makes me strong."

"You may find their secrets in that place, even if you find the reptilian inhabitants unfriendly," says Luluri. "The Mountain Uprooting Brotherhood lays claim to Rathess, and Ma-Ha-Suchi does not contest them. Indeed, he finds some amusement in their presumption."

"The Mountain Uprooting Brotherhood?" asks Gallius. "And who might they be?" She smiles and adds, "I'm rather used to meeting unfriendly inhabitants wherever I go."

"They are a Circle of Lunars - we would call them a pack." Luluri smiles. "They are young, but bold and powerful. The new Lunars, the ones who hunger to taste the blood of the Realm. Even the Guild treats with them now, though in secret."

"But they follow the Silver Way," says Gallius, and it is not really a question. "I imagine there is a way to travel their territory in a fashion that is honorable for all involved."

"You know how to call the spirits of our Brotherhood now, and they recognize you," says the No Moon. "You would be greeted upon entering their territory."

"That will have to do," says Gallius. Still, she has a feeling that this, too, will be more trouble than it seems. "It should be an interesting meeting." But she rather doubts it will be pleasant.
