# Gods of Eden 2004-05-02

The rain came down in heavy sheets, as though all the tears of Heaven were being shed at once.

In the decimated ruins of the city, a foreman, defiantly standing atop a half-decayed pillar of stone, bellowed orders. His jade armor was scarred and scorched in a dozen places; the dried blood of a demigod gave the white jade a sickly hue. He yelled, and yelled again, using the commanding power of his voice to direct his men. The thunder competed with him, but it was merely the undirected screech of the sky-gods; mere spirits could not compete with the voice of battlefield authority that the soldiers of the gods held.

Another voice could, and did. Its terrible cries threatened to drown out the desperate commander, as he wiped tears, blood and rain from his eyes again and again. His men, dressed in the six-yard-high, heavily-armored suits of Essence-imbued jade and steel, used their powerful proxies' hands to draw segments of marble into place. Every square inch of them was inscribed with powerful glyphs of warding. They would soon form a semicircular ring, but the soldier's attention wasn't focused on that. Instead, he stared in visible fear at what was at the center.

It was a great black darkness, a shadow with a voice, and a glowing golden ring upon its brow. It screeched, bellowing curses in a language so old the stones beneath its feet had been young when last it was commonly used. The angry spirit writhed and twisted, testing the boundaries of Essence formed by the five concentric rings marked into the ground around it. Channels cut into the earth and filled with sorcerers' blood anchored these wards, and they held fast in spite of the boundless fury of the wraith within. Near where it raged, the body it once occupied lay motionless on the stony ground.

"Halasen, get those rings in place!" screamed the commander, seeing one of the magicians wobbling in place at the outer edge of the ward. The dozen or more warstriders moved as quickly as those ponderous machines ever could, fearing what should happen if their protections failed. A minute passed, though it seemed to the commander that eternity had slipped by while he stood helpless. The ring came together. Another, smaller ring came down atop it, guided by the strider pilots' frantic efforts.

Inside the zone, those holding back the ward began to fall. One man collapsed entirely. A woman fell to her knees, her face strained. Blood vessels burst across her forehead and arms, but still she held. The others forced themselves to their limit, their reserves of endurance visibly aflame as Essence halos surmounted their bodies and the Caste Marks of the soldiers of the Shogunate rippled across their bloodied brows.

The last layer was set in place. The struggling guardians within, those who kept watch on the barriers of blood that confined the monster, knew the sacrifice they would be making. Each of them volunteered, willingly trading their lives for the safety of Creation, and each had a smile of relief on their face as they saw the dome of their eternal prison set into its place.

Three men rushed forward, then began chanting hurriedly. Their lips spoke evocations of the gods, whispering the secret names of earth and air and the celestial powers. They burned with the incandescent fire of their station as leaders of the armies of Heaven, and under their irresistable command the shape of marble twisted and changed, becoming diamond under their fingertips.

"Second stage wards, activate!" barked the commander. "Essence glyphs, charge!" His men, already weary from their exertions, staggered to comply. The rain beat down on them, its rapid beat on their armor keeping time with their rapid heartbeats. The structure shone with an inner light as magical power began to course through the cunningly-designed barriers.

"Five lives lost," murmured the commander to himself, again wiping his face clean of wetness, watching rainwater mingle with tears on his fingertips as he drew them away. "Only five, only five... " He stared at the sphere of diamond where the brave sorcerers now lay trapped. Sadness for his lost comrades mingled with a great wash of relief. "How much worse it could have been..." This momentary indulgence in pathos brought him back to the task at hand, and he again spoke, voice ringing confidently over the thunder above. No longer did it need to drown out the raging spirit they'd just contained. "We lost five good men and women! This shrine will be not only for the monster within, but also for them. Let's get to work!"

The ritual began at sundown, at the moment the Unconquered Sun's face vanished from Creation's sight. It will end at midnight, that moment when the Sun is lowest in its passage through the underworld - or wherever he may journey. Davron has read the secrets of the Yozis' least servants in the treatise penned by the Mother of Spells herself (or so the legends say). He has read of the sesseljae, and after hearing of Chi-Yosh's bold plan, chose such a creature as the best possible aid he could render. The Black Treatise speaks of the enslavement of demonkind, and the true reason why the Exalted of the First Age bound their broken foes rather than destroy them utterly. "To unmake the Yozis is to unmake the world," the painfully ancient text ran. "Better that authority over the world be granted to the sorcerers of mankind, that man's fate should rest in his own hand."

Davron has spoken the words that call the attention of Cecelyne closer. The Endless Desert, the gateway between the twisted realm of Malfeas and all else that exists, is the portal by which demons enter our world. He speaks the ancient names and bindings, the secret names of his divine forerunners who placed the strictures on demonkind to begin with, and he recites the pledge the once-masters of Creation swore. Its power hangs in the air around his ritual circle, the words escaping his lips and burning like black fire before him.

Inside the protective circle, the hazy shape of a fist-sized beetle, its ten legs long and disturbingly angled, begins to appear, as the sesselja forces its way through the protesting fabric of Creation. Its existence finally solidifies, and it scuttles about in a peculiar and alarming fashion. "herehereherehereherehereherehereherehere," it says, again and again, in a thin and reedy little voice. "Serveserveserveserve."

Davron breathes a slight sigh of relief. The extra energy invested in the binding runes in the circle have paid off, and the test of wills was less arduous than he might have feared. Aloud, he says, his voice resonating with divine command, "Serve you shall, then. For a year and a day, as ordered by the ancient pacts."

"Yearyearyearyearyearyearyear," chatters the tiny creature. "Daydaydaydayday. Commandcommandcommand."

Chi-Yosh has been educated about the demons, how they were bound into servitude before the First Age for they had lost. It is their right, as Solars, to command the Malfeans. This demon, he is assured, is the perfect healing vessel, and will cause no harm. The tasks ahead may call for such a creature, within the tombs of Nexus, and the battles of Harborhead. None of this, however, releaves any of the trepidation that the Su'Katan finds when staring down at the circle of power at the insectious thing scuttling about, knowing that it will be inside of him.

Davron turns to Chi-Yosh, and reads the doubt and hesitation on the man's face. "The minions of the Primordials do not have our aesthetics, and even their more benign forms are not pleasant to look at." He glances at the stomach bottle bug and swallows slightly, none too thrilled at its appearance himself, but steadies himself. "Sesselja, ride inside me for the time being, until you are needed elsewhere."

The beetle-like creature complies immediately, and leaps directly at Davron's face. Chi-Yosh is confronted by the sight of it melding directly through his fellow Solar's features, and even more than that, by the sight of one last leg protruding from Davron's left eyeball and wriggling about, before tugging itself into the man's flesh completely.

The Tomb of Singing Blades rests behind a high fence in the Bastion District of Nexus. The landscaping, the careful arrangement of bushes and trees, as well as the wall itself that divides the First Age relic from the upscale neighborhood around it - all these things are carefully sculpted and arranged in both geomantic and aesthetic fashions. The keening sound of the whirling messengers of death has always put people a bit on edge, and the park-like area reduces the sound to a distant suggestion. As a side effect, it also conceals the sight of anything that may occur inside the tomb's environs, and hence the Council of Entities, through a messenger, has given full permission for Chi-Yosh to make his attempt on the tomb.

In fact, one of the Council members has come along personally. Her name is Pellicia, and though she is not the most attractive specimen of womanhood, she carries herself with the easy grace and self-assurance of a trained warrior. Her reputation among the citizens of this anarch's paradise is fearsome indeed. She intends to enter the tomb, if possible, but that must wait for more daring (or perhaps foolhardy) souls. And she stands, with Davron, Ramar and Cloudburst flanking her, as Chi-Yosh walks calmly toward the boundary the blades define by their passing. The stomach-bottle bug is nestled safely in his innards, feeling like nothing so much as a thick flapjack that's stuck to his ribs.

Nervousness and fear slithers through Chi-Yosh's gut, not unlike other things. Despite the comforting knowledge of the demon surgeon, he is still restless, the sound of the air cleaved a hundred fold the backdrop to his worry. Death weaves through the air just before him, his only chance the fluid nature of Essence running through him. A small mantra builds within him: keep focused on the door, keep moving, keep tight to be less of a target, do not stray far from the door.

With each motion to scale the small wall circling the Tomb, Chi-Yosh condenses himself with resolve, until he is as calm as he can be with slicing edges whistling mere feet from his nose. Essence sings in his body, making it lighter, more durable. The demon stirs inside of him, as if impatient for the task to be done. Collecting a breath, he leaps over the wall.

Feet hit the ground running, eyes squarely on the door. Two steps upon the littered earth have the Dawn ducking down, then bowing backwards. The next two steps are trickier, steel nearly simultanious in the assault at head and calf level. He nearly curls in the air, before stepping on a stout cleaver, hopping to another to dive forward through the rain of weaponry, knees tucked into his chest. The flight is cut short, a hand slamming into one dagger as it whirls by, using the motion to throw his body into a sideways spin, just in time to roll over the top of a cutlas.

Once more the Solar touches ground, back lain open in an ugly gash. Immediately he hurls backwards in an arch over the saber as it whistles past. Catching himself on his hands, the Dawn's legs split to evade a knife, before he's crouching, three running steps, one backwards jerk, before becoming airborne again. It, like any other motions, are short lived; hands latch onto the guard and hilt of a sword, hauling him upwards in a swing to roll across the ground, only to snap flat as a dagger shaves his shirt.

Breath heavy, heart thundering, and sweat is a thick sheen, as power guides each motion of Chi-Yosh's body like the strings of a puppet, his muscles still move. Flesh knits back together, leaving only blood and sweat where he lay, the demon stow away proving to be an ugly blessing. The blessing of Helios is the only thing that jerks him to his knees, and the final two yards to the door are a wild frenzy of sideways sprints, leaps and bows, the keening steel like some relentless swarm of gleaming wasps.

The blades whistle past, the Solar bobbing to and fro, and one instance he must move three places at once; a cleaver slides right through his form. Much to the confusion of the demon, it simply... passed through, not an inch lost. But other parts of him are not so lucky; cuts and slices leak over legs and shoulder as he finally springs for the door, a moment of triump bounding in his heart. No matter what waits behind the portal, at least the blades are behind him.

The sesselja inside Chi-Yosh has been busy, furiously mending cuts and gashes as fast as they are produced. The industrious little stomach-bottle bug is almost completely finished correcting the imperfections of the Solar's body by the time he reaches the door.

The door is three yards wide, and built of solid gleaming orichalcum. It opens with a touch, and behind it can be seen four shapes. They are wiry and spindly, dressed in tattered rags and broad-brimmed hats, and resemble nothing so much as diabolical scarecrows with luminous, blood-red eyes. Each bears with it a long and curvy-bladed scimitar, dripping with red ichor.

Chi-Yosh's attackers fall upon no easy foe. Their scimitars swing straight and true - and are of little account, compared to the zone of death that lies outside. They are the vultures, meant to pick off whatever stragglers may have survived to the tomb's door, but they do not find an easy target on the verge of death. Paired kamas and twin arrows, hurtling their way through the impossible maze of spinning blades, find their mark. One of the demons staggers, mortally wounded, its innards dumping sand and straw over the floor of the tomb as it is punctured repeatedly. The other dissolves into a foul grey cloud of dust and stench.

Two remain, uncaring for their brotherin falling apart in the tomb's foyer. A vicious slash rakes across the grip of one creature, turning its' wrist to powder; lifting the weapon with the other hand proves fatal, as twin arrows soar in over the scimitar's curve and drag the thing across the room. The final one rushes at Chi-Yosh with blade raised high, and the Solar accepts it, turning on his heel quick and sidestepping, dual kamas coming in to hook its' back, and rather than slice, merely hurl. Out stumbles the vulture into the path of the onrushing blades, shattering beneath their assault, grit and straw batted about on the deadly wind. For a moment, the scimitar simply lays defeated on the ground as weapons whisper over it, before it shivers, then is picked up, swept into the defending currents.

The tomb is expansive. Chi-Yosh is set upon six more times, but his own ability to evade attacks and his mastery of his weapons, combined with the sesselja's efforts to reweave his body's structure, make them of little consequence. He finds three symbols on the floor of the ground level, but they are more than symbols. Each is an enormous glyph, crafted from quartz crystals, jade, marble, iron and other elements of occult construction. They are shaped into rings. At the center of each ring is a rune, representing one of the three elements. To the west, wood. To the north, water. To the south, fire. And around each rune is a set of smaller characters, spelling out words and names of occult significance. The runes are all formed of jade bits, like a mosaic of words.

Several moments of study convinces Chi-Yosh that these runes have a heavy amount of Essence flow through them. The jade tiles and segments that compose the glyphs are not fixed in place; it seems like they could be shuffled about like building blocks or tiny bricks.

The wood glyph reads: "From the source of all power." The water glyph reads: "Through the inward and outward channels." And finally, the fire glyph reads: "Empower the instruments of destruction."

Chi-Yosh studies the runes for a long time. He is uncertain as to what to do; if the wrong pattern is created, it possibly could destroy the binds that hold more important things in place, wards that keep things in. Instead of playing a fool's game, the Su'Katan hurries to the door, and calls out to his friends, explaining in brief what the warding puzzle depicts.

The mortal Scavenger Lord is the first to realize the significance of the glyphs; Ramar is a close second. They discuss the matter amongst themselves, while Pellicia listens, a little wide-eyed - despite her position and evident prowess in all things physical, it is clear she's not the most magically savvy. And finally, Cloudburst shouts out her best advice for how to proceed.

The glyphs power the blades, as well as the other defenses of the tomb, and presumably the inner-most wards that seal away the sleeping Exalted soul. They cannot be damaged without breaking the ward; but they can be altered, adjusting the way Essence flows through the structure. The tomb is, in fact, an enormous machine for channelling Essence in the proper fashion, and like any machine, its function can be redirected without impacting its operation. The key is the glyphs. "There should be two more!" shouts Cloudburst. "One earth, one air!" Chi-Yosh discovers these; the earth glyph two floors down, the air glyph, two up. The earth glyph reads: "All power ends inevitably." The air glyph reads: "Spread through the world."

The day passes slowly; Chi-Yosh waits while his friends consult, and makes suggestions of his own. The decision is made, and he approaches the Fire Glyph. He kneels down, eyeing the red jade and feeling it pulse with the lifeblood of existence. With careful fingers, he begins withdrawing jade segments, and placing them in new configurations, always careful not to disrupt the validity of the sutra inscribed in the ring around the symbol for the hottest and most destructive of the elements.

Outside, the observers witness a peculiar spectacle. The spinning blades first continue their orbit as normal; after several moments, though, they begin spreading outward, shredding effortlessly through the trees and bushes and making their way toward the wall. The resistless blades actually shear through a few yards of the barrier-wall before Chi-Yosh can continue the next transformation, and those outside breathe a sigh of relief as the blades begin to slow and then eventually stop.

Cloudburst hmms at the pause of the blades and moves amongst them. She studies them carefully, as if they were the reason she were here. "Quite interesting. Even after chopping through a wall they are as sharp as the day they were forged. Remarkable!" She pulls out a notebook and a pen and considers the swords carefully. She seems to be sketching a hasty picture of them, as well as a record of what was just done.

Without warning the swords suddenly lunge at Cloudburst, eight of them diving towards the woman, all point first.

Each strikes a vital nerve center; each pinpoints a crucial part of her body, and eight tips sink effortlessly into her skin. But no further. They've struck her nerve centers, rearranging the flow of Essence through her body subtly, as a doctor might. And a moment later, they withdraw, returning to their assigned places.

Cloudburst, oddly enough, doesn't react as the blades move. As they withdraw, though, she looks up again. "Ahh, well. Thank you most kindly." And then she buries her face back in the notebook and moves on towards the door, side-stepping weapons as if by mere chance.

Pellicia is the next to follow, a strange smile playing on her lips, and the Council's representative here confidently strides through the open door of the tomb.

Davron is nonplused by the sequence of events, but eventually, when Cloudburst and Pellicia seem unharmed, shrugs and follows along behind. "I just hope we don't get ourselves into worse trouble later."

Ramar is the last one through, and the four bold souls find one another inside the tomb's interior.

Inside the tomb, the savants among the party examine, wide-eyed, the Essence-distribution channels that Chi-Yosh witnessed earlier. They too can feel the flow of power through the system, and they too see the wide, spiral staircase that surrounds the diamond heart of the tomb.

Even when inside the tomb proper, Cloudburst has her attention in the notebook. She stops to consider her surroundings and admires the murals. "Quite fine work, really." And with a hand that moves at a remarkable pace she starts to make sketches of every mural as she goes.

Chi-Yosh stands on the staircase, gazing down through the levels, into the diamond, then back to the cylinders of crystal that lead essence through the structure, amazed. The trials of battle are long lost from his system, and with the needed task finished, now he might simply marvel.

Cloudburst, after she's had a good look around, settles her eyes on the water glyph. "Perhaps if should be changed to: 'Through the inward and irrelevant channels.' But I only advise." She grins and then continues with her sketching.

Davron scratches his head. "But how do you get from 'outward' to 'irrelevant'? Choose your words with care, lest an intervening step kill us all, or worse."

Cloudburst hmmss thoughtfully. After a moment she seems to understand Davron is speaking to her. "Oh. Oh yes. Well, outward is external, external is extraneous, and of course extraneous is irrelevant."

Davron still looks skeptical. "'external' could include _us_. And then again, it may not. I would feel better if we could find a more specific word." He taps his chin. "'Outward' to 'Outdoor', perhaps?"

"You could make the last step 'immaterial', if your prefer," says Cloudburst absently. She is already quite focused on her sketching.

Davron stares at the glyph some more, pondering Cloudburst's suggestion. "External... well, it still has to be external _channels_, after all. And those channels can't lead just anywhere." He nods to himself. "All right everyone, keep well away from anything, just in case," he calls out, kneeling down to change 'outward' to 'external' in the water glyph.

As Davron makes this change, the Essence flow to the wards shifts slightly, but they remain in place. After discussing further with his allies, the sorcerer makes another change, to 'superficial'.

The glyph flickers, and the faintly luminous boundaries of the wards become visible. But only the boundaries are truly empowered; the depths and core of the wards, their actual power to repel passage or to punish the overly greedy, has been removed.

A total of ten smaller sepulchers or monuments can be found inside the tomb, as well as the obviously central crypt. On the "Moon level", the Solars and their companions discover five symbols over such monuments, each containing a phase of Luna: full, waxing, half, waning and dark. And on the first level belowground, five more, dedicated to fallen Terrestrial heroes.

It is the level below that which presents the most interest to the scavengers. The centerpiece of the level, which appears to be an armory of some kind, is a single suit of super-heavy plate armor, flanked by two more suits of articulated plate, all cunningly crafted of orichalcum. Beside each is a long powerbow, and elsewhere in the armory, in each case enshrined in some fashion and dedicated with verse or crafted murals, are a grand daiklave, a grimcleaver, and a mundane broadsword.

"Nine Hells' Proof," claims Pellicia, indicating the super-heavy armor suit with a hand. "Some of these weapons I can identify as well; their stories are known to me."

Cloudburst hmms softly. She turns to Pellicia, "Ahh, truly? Now that is very interesting to me. Perhaps you might share those ancient tales with me?" From her perspective, all these shiny metals are nothing more than things to prop up in a museum.

"I will tell some of what I know," replies the Councilwoman, sounding a little severe. "However, for our complicity in permitting you to risk the safety of Nexus in this adventure, we expect a third of these things in remuneration."

Chi-Yosh marvels at the items stored within the Armory, his attention tilted towards Pellicia, to catch any bits of information while he inspects the various tools. For a moment he is reminded of Defiler's Grave, but these are finished in construction.

"Yes, yes, of course," says Cloudburst. "Most reasonable," she declares. As if she cares! She's too busy sketching to pay much heed to it, it would seem. "You know, it would be fascinating to know just what old ghost is held here, but that must wait for another day, yes?" She nods as if it were agreed by default. "And sadly not a thing for any of my students here. Nothing of use at all! Well, at least there are the murals, though removing them is out of the question."

Meanwhile, Pellicia has stepped over to the ornately-crafted, but purely steel, sword, and is running her hand lovingly over the blade. She hums to herself, seemingly enraptured in thought.

Cloudburst notices Pellicia with the sword and nods her head at it. "A fine blade. Yes, quite fine. It.. suits you, I think. I'm certain they will see the wisdom in letting you have what you desire." She frowns at something for a moment, then turns back to her sketches.

The Councilwoman picks up the broadsword, swings it about experimentally, then presses her hand against the pommel as she makes an especially forceful down-swing. Without warning the blade detaches itself from the hilt, flying across the tomb and embedding itself in the wood of one of the weapon-stands. It remains connected to the hilt via a narrow length of wire. Pellicia smiles. "So it still works," she murmurs.

Cloudburst looks over at Pellicia for a moment and scribbles down a cyphered note for later use. The scholar rubs at her nose for a moment, getting a bit of ink smudged across. "Hmmm." She doesn't get much clearer.

Chi-Yosh considers all of the equipment for a moment. They must part with a third of it, so it must be decided somehow. The armor, they must take, for it seems in demand in all of their areas. Turning to Pellicia, "Do you know of the power to any of these weapons?"

"They are potent weapons in the right hands," the woman replies. "Some have unique gifts, it is true, but most of their former potency came from their Legend-forged status, which I doubt will help you now. The tales that gave them strength have been forgotten."

Davron is studying one of the powerbows, comparing its construction with the more recently constructed model he bears, when he looks up. "Legend-forged? What does that mean, milady?" he asks, sounding immensely intrigued.

"When you make a weapon," she replies, "you often require exotic ingredients - umm, pieces of power, like a talisman or walkaway. You incorporate these things into your forging, and their symbolic power lends itself to the final weapon. But you can reforge orichalcum, as I understand it, with a new talisman, one that's charged with the power of some victory or accomplishment. The weapon becomes greater, because it draws strength from the story of that deed. I'm not a wonder-worker, but this is what I have been told."

Davron rubs his chin. "Fascinating..." he says, a light glinting in his eyes. He glances at his own bow once again, then returns the tomb's weapon to its place as his mind returns to the present. "One moment, milady - my fellows and I must discuss how to pay your price."

Pellicia nods slowly, then begins doing the most curious thing. She folds the broadsword in half, its blade hinging effortlessly. She folds it again, and again it becomes ever more compact. And again, as she opens panels in the apparently-solid steel of its construction, until the whole thing is no larger than her fist.

The Councilwoman turns, noting Davron's interest, and glowering for a moment in evident disdain. "You'll find little of interest in this weapon, Exalt," she remarks. "It's a product of Autochthonian engineering, not the magic gold you favor."

Davron chuckles. "All works of craft are of interest to me, milady. Though, perhaps such engineering is not so relevant to our more immediate needs."

"Well, if you have interest in this, speak to Brueghel," she replies curtly. "He may teach you what he knows of Autochthonian lore, for a price." And with that the Dawn Sergeant moves for the spiral stairs up and out.

In due course the remaining raiders settle on their prize: the three suits of armor, the grand daiklave, the grimcleaver, and a powerbow. The other powerbows, and of course that peculiar broadsword, are left behind as the price paid to the Council for standing aside. And in due course Cloudburst has compiled her collection of mural-sketches. Chi-Yosh and Davron have considered the matter carefully, and it strikes both men that the sesselja Chi-Yosh still carries, while not the best conversationalist, is quite intelligent enough to restore the glyphs to their former order.

The equipment is hauled out and consolidated in a corner, while Cloudburst arranges for a wagon to be brought up. It must pass through the gathering throng of onlookers; even the conservative residents of the Bastion District are curious enough about the tombs that word of one's deactivation spread like wildfire. The mercenaries of Nexus are enough to hold back those among the crowd who would seek to enter, and the wagon leaves, laden with possessions, well-guarded, and accompanied by three cloaked strangers.
