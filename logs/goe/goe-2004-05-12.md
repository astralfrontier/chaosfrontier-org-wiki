In the early hours of the morning, the Tri-Khan is wakened by the sound of his guards. A great gong rings, repeatedly - the call to arms. Using strange Eastern herbs, three audacious Lunars rendered the leader's immediate family unconscious. Using the power of Exalted sorcery, they drove a jagged hole through the arcane defenses that barred their quickest exit. Using the aid of a powerful Southern spirit known as a Life-Tree, they opened a magical gateway out of the palace.

Mid-morning, as the Tri-Khan is sacrificing a condemned criminal upon an altar in the center of his city's temple to invoke the merciless gods of the hunt and of vengeance, Gallius is entering the palace of the King of Harborhead, Shanam lo Dan. She bears with her a proposal - "I possess the family of the Tri-Khan, who has sworn before six great gods that he will see justice. I will exchange them to you as hostages, and the Tri-Khan will cede much land for their safe return, for so he has vowed. In return, I wish to command the Brides of Ahlat, for my honor as a soldier will be greatly enhanced."

Though the king is naturally suspicious in a time of war - Ma-Ha-Suchi has been visiting his power upon the southern marches all through the month - this offer comes almost as an omen from the gods, and he accepts it gladly. And being a charismatic and attractive woman, Gallius has little difficulty in arranging a more intimate venue to extend her offer. The guards outside are trained to see and hear nothing; and inside, Shanam is receiving much less than he believes. Willingly he signs the orders placing Gallius at the head of his elite soldiers. And as Gallius takes her leave of the palace, he makes the prayers and sacrifices to Ahlat with his priests, speaking to the great bull-god of the new commander of the Brides and the daring she demonstrated. And only for a moment does his newfound confidence in victory waver, when he witnesses the Southern god's bouts of raw, masculine laughter at hearing this hero's name.

The palace of Shanam of Harborhead, Esteemed Ruler of the Southern Coast, Potentate of the Inner Sea, and other titles whose lengths dizzy the imagination, validates those titles more than adequately. It is a magnificent abode, despite being constructed on the backs and blood of slaves. In her time here working her persuasive program on the king, Gallius has witnessed frescoes and other works of sublime art describing the most common source of slaves the kingdom employs - the captured soldiers of hostile lands, and their retainers. Delzahn nomads, ambitious barbarian leaders from the hundred tribes of the Southlands, eunuch desert-warriors grown strong in the harsh sands to the southwest, Varangian mercenaries hired by who-knows-who, and even the ambitious scholar-knights of Kish in the far south - all these have found themselves in shackles, scrubbing the floors and working in the kitchens of Harborhead.

Many have come to try Harborhead's strength; most have ended up enslaved, and civilized to the extent Harborhead permits. Their children are free citizens, always, and so the kingdom has a constant influx of slave labor. Nor is its program of capturing suitable specimens purely defensive - numerous raids throughout the south, and programs of conquest, have added greatly to its stock. And yet, the city is prosperous, the palace is palatial, and Gallius has seen her share of smiles, scowls, and sad eyes in her time on this mission.

The Solar frowns inwardly, but shows not a hint of it. Her eye has been a calm, weighing one. This place is.. efficient in her mind, if immoral. That will soon be remedied, and the guiltiest shall live only long enough to know that the ancient judges have returned. Gallius makes her way away from the palace with her usual easy, measured pace, drawing her mind back to the task at hand. Everything is going very well. But her guard is far from down.

Rightfully so is the child of the Sun on her guard - but perhaps mere wariness is sufficient, rather than a true battle-posture. She rounds the corner, finding waiting for her an enigmatic figure. Snakeskin boots and spurs; a long, dirty duster, and wide-brimmed hat frame a dark silhouette whose face cannot be seen for the shadow cast on it. His arms are folded loosely over his chest. The air of decay hangs lightly around him, a hint of ancient black royalty interred in its crypt. It is Stormclouds at Dusk, the Abyssal envoy Gallius' friends encountered, for it can be no other. He seems to catch sight of the approaching general, then raises a hand to his hat and lifts it a mere half-inch in mild politeness. "Ma'am," his dusty voice resonates.

Gallius raises an eyebrow, offering a nod in response. "I did not expect to find you here," she says simply. "But then again, why not? I would offer to.. entertain you, but my current business is far too important for play."

"Seems we're here on the same kinda' business," observes the Abyssal, his voice blowing with the dry emptiness of the south winds. The shadow where his face ought to be moves and changes somewhat, hinting of his mouth in motion as he speaks, without revealing anything further, and that same reticence is reflected in his mein. "Think I'd best be goin', though." He salutes again by tipping his hat the barest fraction, turns, and begins moving away. Behind Gallius, running feet can be heard.

Gallius smirks and waits for a moment. If this is an attack it will likely ruin all her plans and she'll reward the attacker with a very slow death. For a moment she wishes the Abyssal had stayed. He might provide useful suggestions. In any case, she turns around, her expression even, but her eyes sharp as daggers.

Several yards distant down the hallway, and coming closer, is an armored figure - a woman, with long black hair and a deep southern-touched complexion. Her hair is braided behind her, and it waves rapidly as she sprints. Her grace and fluidity are clear, even beneath the sculpted lamellar armor she wears, and she goes armed with paired swords, even in the palace of the king himself. This can be none but one of the Brides of Ahlat, and as she draws closer, Gallius makes out the three white stripes on the left side of her face. This is Koriko Usoma, the leader of the Brides, whom Gallius has never before met in person. She stops, seeing Gallius, in the hall, and considers for a moment. Then she walks, warily, like a wolf appraising a rival.

Gallius considers the woman carefully, her face somehow both bland and harder than stone. She offers a respectful nod and studies the leader of the Brides of Ahlat thoroughly. She considers for a moment, and then speaks, "You are Koriko Usoma." Even her voice is flat, and yet the statement is somehow turned into both an acknowledgement of fact and an unspoken command for explanation.

"And you are a stranger, and perhaps a demon as well," the woman replies. She does not yet draw her swords, but her body language suggests a willingness and readiness to do so. "I am not ignorant of the events unfolding around the King. Some bargain was made, and it has an ill omen for me. And there is a creature of darkness nearby. And here you are, a new arrival. Explain yourself."

Gallius appraises the woman for a time. "An ill omen," she says flatly. "Your allegiance belongs Ahlat, does it not?" asks the Solar. From all the expression Gallius shows, the Bride of Ahlat may has well said nothing at all. "If that is still true--and for your own sake, I hope it is--then you should only seek his word, not mine. I wonder, though, why he would trust his brides to any man. It matters little, for Ahlat is willing to consider a more worthy and respectful settlement." She doesn't change her expression, but rubs two fingers against her thumb as if something distasteful had touched her at the thought of a man leading the Brides.

"It is through a vision granted me by Ahlat that I grow aware of these matters," spits out Koriko defiantly. "So it is true, then? You seek to command us?"

Gallius arches an eyebrow and hmms. "As much as anyone can command you," she remarks, allowing just the littlest of smiles to curve her lips. It is swiftly gone, and she goes on, "You look like one who has difficulty bowing her head. That is just as well. I am the spear of Helios, and the weak cannot follow me, though they may shelter behind the power of my blade." Seemingly as afterthought the Solar adds, "Ahlat is more worthy than most know." And it is clear that Gallius judges it so due to this woman's strength.

"You do not deny my accusations of your demonic heritage," Koriko announces with a smirk. "I am glad you do not judge me such a fool. But I, and no other Bride, will submit to any creature of darkness. Do not think to use the name of the forgotten sun-god in vain, for I will show you the true power of his might, and you will know the two gods I serve." And with that she draws her weapons, a Caste Mark - identical to that which at times has graced Gallius' brow - blossoms into life upon her brow. "Take heed."

Gallius considers the caste mark and somehow seems.. unmoved. She wishes she were so still inside. Gallius replies by allowing her caste mark to mirror that of the other woman. "You know I am no demon," she answers simply. "So do not quote to me the heresies of the wilting Realm. Once I considered them my greatest enemy, but now they are only a nuisance." She tsks at herself for speaking of that. "If you would judge my use of the name of Lord Helios, you will have to see for yourself. If this.. king.. continues as he is going, you shall have your chance. At worst, you will be freed of him."

Koriko looks like a woman who's been smote to the foundation by a hammer-blow, but she rallies quickly. "I see. So you are... like me. And there are others, I suppose." She narrows her eyes. "It still does not excuse or explain what has taken place." One of her sword-points is levelled at Gallius. "What bargain has been struck here?"

Gallius looks about for a moment. No one is near. That is just as well. She does not like killing, even when it is necessary. "Control your outrage," says Gallius. "That.. king of yours, is going to 'sell' the brides for a worthless bit of earth that his pride treasures." For once, Gallius does not control her voice, letting disgust drip from it. "Ahlat will see that mortals are not meant to lead the elect of Gods. As for the Brides, they are living beings, and I do not buy them in truth. I will speak to all of you away from prying ears. What happens then is up to you and your sisters, I think."

The commander sheathes her blades, eyes narrow as she evaluates her apparent rival and would-be leader. "Yet, I have sensed evil close, and I know that you are the only.." A polite cough interrupts her speech, and she and Gallius turn at the same time, to see Stormclouds at Dusk leaning up against the wall, quietly watching the proceedings. Again he tips his hat. "'Fraid that was me, ma'am," he corrects Koriko.

Gallius taps her foot in annoyance. If she tries to kill him now, she may well succeed, with the aid of her fellow Solar. Succeed, and ruin everything. "Can't you do something useful with yourself," says Gallius. Like bury yourself and die, she thinks to herself. "We ruined your plans in Greyfalls," she says simply, "And if you meddle here, you may not find it so easy to escape. This game grows dangerous. Is your master so eager to risk our attention?"

The Abyssal shrugs limply. "Don't mind me," he says. "Just thought you'd like to know we already made a deal here. So I've got some entertainment coming. Thought I might go watch the sand-dunes for a bit. But I couldn't neglect bein' sociable."

"Hardly surprising," says Gallius evenly. "The Realm and its wayward allies are likely to start offering treaties with anyone who is drunk enough to stand with them." All the more reason to kill that sick animal swiftly. These mortal rulers have memories best measured in seconds, it would see. "We will just have to remember to hold our noses when your.. things take the field."

Stormclouds at Dusk only smiles. Koriko scowls, reaching for her swords - but the Abyssal holds up a hand. "No need for that, I'm goin'. But you two are welcome to join me, if'n you wish," he offers.

"I think not," says Gallius. "There are more pressing matters. I have a feeling we will meet again soon enough. There is no need to ruin the moment with impatience." The Solar turns to face Koriko, hoping the woman is wise enough to not waste time with the Abyssal right now.

The Brides' commander simply shakes her head, glowering with pent-up rage. Stormclouds sighs and shrugs winsomely, shrugging in his long and dirty riding-coat, and turns, waving one gloved hand over his shoulder in a gesture of farewell. "Then that...." Koriko does not complete her thought. "My apologies. Still, we shall see if you are worthy to seek control of the Brides." And with that, she too takes her leave.

Gallius watches first the Abyssal depart, and then the Solar. She murmurs softly to herself, "What will be, will be." And with that, she goes on her way, as well. Nothing she's seen today shall be allowed to alter her plans. There is just a higher likelihood that contingency plans shall be put into motion.

---

Helios lurks behind the endless dunes of black sand. In the distance, clouds gather over the horizon in preparation for the great sun-god's arrival over the world. Here in the canyons, the barbarian raiders and inhuman beastmen of the Southern deserts gather. A dozen Lunars, three Circles strong, eye their newfound Solar allies with some trepidation. It is clear that some hostility and wounded pride lurk in their hearts; and yet, these strange scions of civilization have come on Ma-Ha-Suchi's request and live under his protection, at least with regard to the Silver Pact. With unwavering confidence the Lunar war-god distributes his allies among the six divisions of battle. About half of the beast-men clamber aboard the flat-bottomed barge that inexplicably rests here on the sand. And elsewhere, Davron and Ramar go hunting.

In the cool moments between the night and the day, when the great sun-god is already warming the canyons, sliced by rivers in the rocky cliffs that snake and twist beneath Ramar's eyes. _There. Focus on the landscape, learn what secrets it holds, and the day may be won._ The Solar scout nods to Davron, "In a moment..." then, the plain, featureless Mask is slipped over his face. Ramar staggers, a gesture made all the more odd by the lack of expression... and then, slowly, that which is hidden is made known to his sight. There against the rocks, and there atop the canyons, perched near the entrance... hidden behind a thin veil of mud, and behind the shadows of the rocks cast by the uneven pre-dawn light, are two of the scouts. Ramar points, revealing to Davron that which is no longer meant to be hidden by the Maidens.

Davron nods to Ramar, listening carefully to his directions and focusing his eyes where he's directed... then closing them again, picturing not the virtually invisible blob in the shadow of the cliffs, but the faint traceries of Essence that make up his target's life force, standing out in sharp relief against the unliving Essence of the rocks about him. When the archer opens his eyes again, his imagination has become reality, and the scout's painstaking efforts of camouflage are as naught to Davron's second sight. Davron quietly draws back the bowstring and lets the arrow fly, the narrow shaft whistling through the sky as if hungry to consume that life force.

In a moment, a life passes. The scout, a dedicated career soldier of Harborhead, a man satisfied with his life and driven to defend his way of life, lays in concealment. He thinks of his wife at home, his nearly-grown son, the three slaves whose children he's proudly taught the arts of war, so that they will not shame him when they finally take leave of his household. And without warning, existence is taken from him. The narrow shaft, so exquisitely aimed, brings no pain, and his next experience is that of a smiling woman, who holds out her hand. "I have a place to show you," she whispers, and he looks up into the pre-dawn sky, seeing the Blue Moon growing closer...

Davron turns his eyes next to the cliffs above. Another observer spotted by Ramar's heightened senses - another observer soon to be silenced before his time. Softly Davron asks Ramar to repeat his directions, but his own unaided eyes see little more than rock and mud at the spot indicated. Another moment of concentration, though, and the soldier of Harborhead stands out to Davron's eyes as if he were carrying a torch at midnight; and once again the golden bow bends and springs back, sending a feathered wind to snuff that torch.

No voice calls out, no signal fire alights where the arrow landed. So far so good; but Davron will not allow himself to become complacent. It only takes one scout, one missed shot, to raise the alarm - and only with the preternaturally keen eyes of Ramar would Davron even know where to look for them. And so one more time Davron calls upon his own Essence to guide his eye, his hand, and finally a deadly swift arrow to a third scout in his nest upon the high cliff, to ensure that no warning will come to the guard upon the southern gate that an army marches upon it.

A hard-faced woman, her bloodlust evident to Ramar's enhanced vision, is the third scout; Davron's silent herald delivers its grave message, and the woman's desire for war flickers into nothingness as she finds peace, albeit unexpectedly.

In the encampment, Ma-Ha-Suchi is exhorting his troops. He spends a few minutes speaking to them in Flametongue, using animalistic growls and grunts in conjunction with his charismatic and practiced human voice. Gallius, Chi-Yosh, and even Dace can feel Essence flowing from his words; whatever Charm or innate gift he possesses, its effects are visibly bolstering those who listen.

The sun begins to shine, greeting the new day confidently. The heat of the desert has not yet come; it is fortunate, for there will be enough to exhaust those on the field. With a shout, Ma-Ha-Suchi and his Lunars command the wild forces of the peripheral Threshold to begin advancing. They have taken up position a third of a mile south of the fortification, approaching by stealth. Now there is no more time for that. The thousands of barbarian-soldiers, weapons raised high, scream death-oaths as they charge across the packed earth of the canyon. They defiantly mock the defenders on the wall, who realize almost too late the extent of the unanticipated attack. Volleys of arrows are unleashed from the top of the wall, but Ma-Ha-Suchi has chosen his leaders well, and Gallius has planned accordingly; the scattered formations present a difficult target indeed.

As dawn's light begins to take hold of the battlefield Gallius and her mount bring the power of Helios to bear. Above the head of the Solar Queen a lion of silver roars, flaring as if to compete with the very sun. The mammoth charges on, its eyes glinting gold in the brilliant flare of its rider. Just as the wall looms ahead the beast rears onto its back legs and striking out, flooded with essence, lashes out with its front legs.

The first strike is like the smash of a hammer against a giant gong. The next sends a brilliant burst of light up to the heavens and the wall shatters like glass, bursting apart and flying ahead of the charging beast. As the mammoth crushes the ruins of the wall flat, a man rolls from his cot to look toward what had once been a fortress wall, but now is a gaping wound in the defenses of Harborhead's line.

Even as the way is cleared forces pour into the gap. Arrows launch out at the army arrayed inside, driving them to ground but taking no serious bite. Not so lucky are the archers above. As they face the rain of arrows from Gallius' men they are cut down, and the fearful fire from above is utterly silenced.

Meanwhile, as the sounds of battle filter through from the north, Davron and Ramar, having completed their counter-reconnaisance mission, are climbing onto the seemingly-misplaced barge. As Ramar preparse himself for battle, Davron bows his head and clasps his hand around the golden ring upon his finger. He is still for a moment, his eyes closed, as if listening to an unseen voice... for indeed he is. And then his eyes fly open, and he speaks, not the language of men, but the harsh syllables of sorcery. The symbol of Twilight on his brow begins to burn, then to flare, his anima swirling and pulsing in time with a whirling vortex that appears and grows above the land-bound barge.

As the Solar sorceror completes the final gesture, the vortex coalesces into a enormous flying creature, its feathers gleaming white in the light of the rising sun. Four great legs reach down and clasp the wooden vessel on all four corners, and with hardly a lurch, the barge lofts skyward. The spirit's many wings beat the air with the sound of a thousand birds as it bears its deadly burden toward the towers beyond.

The barge baring its' payload of Beastmen flies steady towards the western guard tower. Among them is Dune Stalker, Helios' gaze glittering off the Lunar's scales. Yet the tower itself is not defenseless; men gather by the dozens, arrows nooked and blades held in anxious grip, ready to give the animal troops a bloody welcome. Speeding behind the barge like some flash draws the alabaster automation, its' Essence-laden wings beating the air like a conductor; much faster than the sky boat, it dips from above and dives beneath the barge, only to fly at a straight line towards the oncoming arrows.

Up rears the Volo just before the tower, exposing the Solar pilot. Power blasts from him in waves, the unnerving glare of the Unconquered Sun in his eyes, shrouded in the clawing of his Anima, the length of segmented staff that glitters like a fire-touched snake in his hands. They flinch as he launches from the Volo, landing on one man's shoulders, kicking him to the floor as Chi-Yosh darts over the top of another. Golden lightning rains down among them as the sure-footed demon dances over their weapons, leaving an ugly path in his wake.

Finally feet touch down, and as the hesitant defenders crowd around the assaulting Anathema, the Exalt is everywhere, and no where their swords can find. Raw strength of blows send several pitching over the edge of the wall, while the air is filled with the scream of metal exploding beneath Orichalcum might, echoed by roaring waves. The rows upon rows part like shredded paper, first plowed by Chi-Yosh, then fear gives men wings that send them soaring down the ramps and stairs from the tower top. The panic is the Exalt's playground, before the sun-lit tiger is snapping at their heels, only stopping to strike down those who have the backbone to stand.

On the field, four waves of Threshold warriors race forward. Three are led by the shapeshifting terrors the barbarians know as "Lunars", the recipients of their awe, worship and respect. The fourth is led by a bald man, bearing a great golden sword, and burning with a similarly-colored radiance. He has earned no name among the savage tribesmen of the South; his name is told in none of their songs. But as with the four other sun-gods whom their totems seem to regard as equals, one had only to look at him to sense that leadership was his birthright. When he charged like a madman, demonstrating a ferocity the tribes' greatest warriors could only aspire to, they followed him without hesitation.

The gleaming light cast from the now aloft barge scatters through the canyon, banishing shadows back in those places shielded from the Sun's approaching gaze. The soldiers standing beneath, those stricken by the blinding light, run. Others are less fortunate, choosing to stand and face the ship as many-feathered wings bring the vessel low across the ground. The massive bulk of the ship sends up a cloud of dust, and this cloud bears the tide of beastmen at it's back. Spears and teeth flash in the now scattered fog, leaving soldiers scattered and broken in it's midst. With a sudden breeze. the clouds of dust part, revealing the beastmen crashing as a wave against the struggling soldiers. The fighting is fierce, but the beastmen are led by those the Sun has blessed, and the confused soldiers can do little against the onrushing horde.

Before the Exalt had touched down on the Western tower, a score of soldiers stood guard upon the stairs and ramps between the roof of the tower and the wall itself. After the Solar's arrival, they are first swept up in the stampede of men, some shocked, others alarmed, and some barking orders to rally a second line of defense. Some of the fleeing men have courage thrust back into them under the rage of their comrades, and away from the glaring light of the Sun's herald, they forget their cowardice. He will have less room to move, and now they are prepared for him.

Like a comet, Chi-Yosh explodes into the tower, diving down the open air between the layers of stairs. Staff snapping around a banister, he swings onto a level, feet first into the two startled guards before standing safely. From there, destruction is unleashed upon the men further down the stairwells, sending them pitching over the railing, down the steps, or screaming out onto the wall. Turning, the Solar ducks from the downward-charging men by running up the railing and launching up through the divide once more, pouncing the last men coming down the stairs, and the rest is mere repetition.

Davron leaps from the barge as the beastmen claim the tower for their own, and takes up a position on the battlements, his aura burning like a lavender flame. Though he surely could do damage aplenty simply by wielding the powerbow Excelsior willy-nilly against the opposing force, the sight of an enemy commander's banner upon the field suggests a better use of his talents.

Drawing back the string, Davron channels his Essence through the arrow and bow, and the lambent flame about his form coalesces into the hawk once more as the screaming arrow flies through the air and strikes the general with terrible force. As his forces mill about in confusion, Davron lets fly another arrow, this one empowered with nothing more than his God-given talent and the native might of Excelsior. It is enough. The commander slumps and falls from his horse, and the soldiers scurry in fright like ants from a smashed anthill.

In a short time the entire battlefield turns into a frothing sea. The tide of Gallius' charge slams across the line of defenders, blasting aside units and crushing them under the wheels of Celestial fury. At the head is Gallius, now riding Jin-nu and still glowing as bright as the sun. Joining her avalanche are three Full Moon Lunars and a Changing Moon. The foe, in a panic, looks into the face of death on every Exalt's face, on every barbarian and beastman weapon.

Some stand to be swept away, others falter, watching their allies vanish under the advancing lines of Ma-Ha-Suchi's allies. For a moment they teeter on the brink, then many break away, rushing away from a crushing defeat. Spurring them on is Gallius, grinding over the last defenders before turning to consider the field once more. Seeing the ruin of her enemy, she holds back her men. The wall has been won. Anything more would be wasteful.

The East and West towers now resound with the triumphant cry of the victorious! The shouts and cheers fill the canyon walls, and send those last few who dare not run, running. With Ma-Ha-Suchi atop one tower, and the Solars atop the other, those on the ground give shouts of exultation as they move to secure the wall. The dust settles, and the wounded are corraled and tended to. The battle is over, for now.

Gallius turns away from the cries of joy and studies the field. She says to one of the Lunars near her, "Those who surrender will be bound and blind-folded and led away from this place until the battle is over. We will set main camp here at the wall. If you can get word to Ma-Ha-Suchi to speak with me after he's finished. The next move awaits." She spurs on Jin-nu and goes forward to speak with the other Lunars. The next move.

Nearly a thousand men, stunned by the decimation of more than twice their own number, begin making an orderly retreat. Over a thousand more simply flee, unable to maintain combat discipline in the face of the forces so unleashed. The archers atop the walls were unable to attack the tribesmen who poured through the gate underneath them; they were too busy defending themselves from a savage attack from the Wing of feral beastmen who poured out of the western tower in a frenzy of battle-lust. From the eastern tower, the Lunar elder uses his commanding presence, bellowing an unmistakeable message across the canyons: "DO NOT PURSUE THOSE WHO FLEE." His warriors immediately rein themselves in, abandoning pursuit.

And so, the Sun rises on a new day. It remains, as always, Unconquered. As the cries of victory are raised near the entrance to harborhead, preparations and alarms are sure to be raised elsewhere. Victory lies within the Solar's grasp this day. Somewhere, within the impossibly beautiful realm of Yu-Shan, the Unconquered Sun smiles. His Children are growing. Perhaps the world may be set aright after all...

---

Precious few prisoners could be taken; some killed themselves, rather than submit to the control of the desert raiders. Others knew their way about the canyons and used that knowledge to make up for what they lack in desert-craft, compared to the tribesmen. The small but doughty army commands the fortification, and Ma-Ha-Suchi is sending messages via sand-burrower to his other forces to the west.

Now that they have time to do so, many of the tribesmen are marvelling at the strange and singular magics the Solars have brought with them - the flying barge, the strange and shimmering golden weapons, and the winged steed. Wingfoot has grown sleeker since Gallius left her loyal mount in the care of Weeping Prowler; feathers are now prominent where hair once was, and the two aesthetically-lined owl-like wings that jut from the shoulders and flanks. Each argent feather is tipped with a blood-red diamond-shaped hue, and the overall effect is highly distinctive. Wingfoot's eyes are almond-shaped, and stare with a crimson mixture of affection and more alien emotions as Gallius draws near.

"A strange combination," observes one of the No Moons, eyeing Gallius and her mount. "A hybrid of two beasts, the strengths of both, one assumes. A battle led by Solars and Lunars both is another such combination. Only the future will tell if either type breeds true." and with that, he turns, striding away across the sand.
