# Gods of Eden 2004-05-19

The Month of Resplendent Earth has been a momentous campaign, like nothing the Solar Circle's individual members have experienced before. Their lips are dry and fine; many have shed some weight. Their skins are tough and tanned, sometimes a tad burned, by the relentlessness of the Sun. It is easy to understand the Zenith Caste's affinity for this direction. The heat of Helios burns away weakness and fat, strips a man or woman of weakness, and toughens the soul. It is the heat of the fire that forges an Exalt into a weapon of the gods, and the burning sand underfoot is the anvil.

Five major battles have been fought, and a dozen smaller skirmishes. Ma-Ha-Suchi has skillfully driven his forces around and through the defenses of Harborhead's finest. The legions, dazzling in their desert-ready open armor and billowing with the black and white robes that shield them from the harsh sun overhead, put up a strong resistance. There are times when Gallius' tactics and unfailing leadership prove successful, and bulwarks that cannot stand against the concerted charge of the north's mammoths. Already three of the beasts have died, either in battle or due to climate, despite their handlers' best efforts. Sometimes a great beast is the wrong answer, and a silent shaft from Davron's bow puts an end to an otherwise-organized unit.

Nor has the archer simply used his skills as the weeks went by - he has been improving them. Every moment he has not been called upon in battle, Davron has been haunting the archery butts, standing farther away from the targets than any but the Lunars could imagine possible. And as the days go by, he hones his art to such a pitch that, with a sufficient focus of mind and body and bow, any arrow that can reach the target can hit it.

Even this is not enough for Davron, though. To deadliness of aim he adds deadliness of the impact itself, learning by painstaking effort to better channel his magic into the arrows themselves; where before he could merely kindle the arrow alight, now he can cause them to blaze, and strike down a foe, with the brilliance of Helios Himself.

Gallius looks little like the child she was but a few seasons ago. First bathed in the ice of the north, and now heated again and hammered as if Helios' Chosen was being forged. She has grown stronger, and seen her world grow. In an odd way she's gained a daughter during this campaign, and found a sister. She only hopes that this war does not take both of them away.

The blazing heat of the Sun's Forge is as deadly as the enemy, if not moreso. The heat can sear the flesh and tire the body... yet Ramar has endured this and more in times past. Ramar now teaches those who are still getting used to the desert sun... the mahouts from the North, his circlemates, and any others who care to accept his aid. _And so I return again... perhaps it has been too long since I have left. Still... I can help these others survive. I can teach them what I was taught._

There is something else the Solar has learned. Something else he has recently discovered. At night, it has been Ramar who kindles the flames, who wards off the freezing darkness that night brings... yet he has never needed kindling nor flint, merely the flow of Essence. _The desert has much to teach those who will learn. I am thankful to be one of those who will._

The spirits are not ignored. They make the deserts thrive, for like the water stowed beneath the earth, their powers are stowed away, but sustain the bleak, harsh world around them. Even moreso, the spirits themselves offer assistance - for the right price - in the Campaign's effors. For the things that the Lunar themselves cannot do, or simply cannot at that time, the spirits' aids of observation, diversion, and sustenance come in handy. Chi-Yosh is their ambassador, for when he is not busy with finding the apt ways to weave the Essence into brutally effective patterns, he is at work for the campaign at hand.

Another project the Dawn sees to is harnessing the life of the fierce land around them. The plants that grow are survivors, and they are rich in things that keep them from being eaten by some animals, or thrive in the heat and sand. And in them are true power. After collecting many of the various plants that can be hunted down, the Solar mixes and matches, crafting the elements like a smith at a forge. His efforts are long, and after experiments that leave one man sick and two nearly dead, the product is finished despite suspicion.

Chi-Yosh presents the mixtures to his fellows. Substances to make men like storms on the battlefield, shrugging off pain and heavy wounds to continue moving. Others make their blood pump fast, muscles bulge, to hit harder and deeper. A third gift to the cause is one for moving the men. A score have died of heat exhaustion, but with the application of salve upon the poors, helps drain excess heat, and retain water better. The barbarians are wary, after the botched results during testing, but are won over as the Solar shows them the effects on captured coyotes.

The outer defensive line of the city of Kirighast comes into view near the end of the month. The sight is greeted by all - barbarians let out rousing war-cries, mingling with the triumphant roars of beastmen. Here, the fiery southern breezes have given way somewhat, and the cool breezes carrying moisture from the Inner Sea can be felt on one's face. The sensation of ocean water carried on the wind touches sand-tormented skin, sending a faint shiver through the nerves. It seeks to spread through the body with its revitalizing power, displacing the aching heat the desert has left behind.

The uniform smell of arid lands and dust-choked canyons, too, surrenders unwillingly to a greater melange of aromas. Spices and herbs from the city and its environs; the smell of the sea, which intoxicates sailors from every corner of Creation; wood-smoke and oil, used in cooking. Other, more arcane sensations play across the awareness of the Circle. A growing sense of active Essence, moving underground, becomes active in their perceptions. They approach some great work of magic.

Unopposed, and with the Third Legion well over two days' travel from confronting his present forces, Ma-Ha-Suchi leads his people forward. They have raided and slain, cutting down the soldiers of the outlying villages who opposed them, leaving alone those who meekly surrendered. The Lunar has made no secret of his presence in Harborhead, nor his ambitions for it, and he declares to all who ask that any who seek to match strength with him have asked for the defeat he will provide them.

The outermost defensive ring of Kirighast approaches. Three columns of feral southern outlanders stride forward. In the distance, a sparkle can be seen from the capital itself. A moment later, an explosion tears the world in half. Only a few hundred yards ahead of the advancing troops, an explosion has hit ground, and chunks of stone come raining down over the heads of all. The earth beneath their feet quakes as well, stirred by the vehemence of that thrust. "Essence weapon!" barks one of the Lunars. "A beam attack. Another coming within fifteen heartbeats," replies Luluri, the knowledgeable No Moon. "We'll have no defense." Ma-Ha-Suchi growls, turning about, using his Exalted presence and magnifying his words to his people, exhorting them to spread out as quickly as possible. But even this will not save many lives, now.

Gallius frowns but does not falter, even as the earth is tormented by the power of essence. She strides forward confidently. "You have a defense," she says flatly. Her voice rises, booming out, "Davron, show them that we are not to be trifled with! I will stand here. Do not waste time!" She hefts her naginata and strides forward, readying herself to confront the next beam.

Even as Gallius readies she raises a hand, calling Wingfoot to her side. With a gust the flying horse appears and in a moment she is on top of it, flying and readying herself to block whatever might come.

As the warning of the great cannon goes up, Chi-Yosh makes a run for the cart being hauled by a mammoth. "Davron," he calls, "We have a large fly to swat!" Leaping onto the cart and activating the winged automation. The Volo launches into the air, before Chi-Yosh swoops down and snatches up the archer given only a moment to prepare. They are off towards the cannon, wings beating harsh into the sweeping salty wind.

Ma-Ha-Suchi notes the Solars taking off in their various ways, and begins reversing course - his orders are now to ready bows and provide cover. The first defensive ring is a low stone wall behind which soldiers will often shelter, and the Lunar leader fully expects the unexpected now.

When the next blast comes, Gallius is ready. About her essence gathers like a shield, flowing up and down her weapon. An eye cannot trace the beam. Gallius is there one moment, and in the next she is an exploding star bursting in front of the army. The force of it shudders the air, and the ground groans and quakes, though she is above it. Inside the blinding light Gallius is lost. None can see the tension that rocks her, nor see how the entire force of the 30 foot blast is drawn into a space little bigger than a hand. For a time the blade that turns the blast is hot as the sun, and even as the first light is gone it glows with white heat.

Wingfoot's shriek is swallowed in the screaming heat of the blast, and then again in the roar as if a hundred lightning bolts stabbed through the same air, sending a deafening rumble out for miles, sound so powerful that is felt just as much as it is heard. The steed reels for a moment, but holds wing, keeping the guardian Solar aloft, ready to face another blast, though the effect of the first has left her far more drained than anything yet in this war.

It takes the blink of an eye for Ramar's Volo to be airborne. He swoops easily through the air, dodging out of the way as the cannon is fired a second time... though as he glances Gallius' way he sees it is all for not. He shouts triumphantly, and his shout echoes across the canyon walls as they speed by. His ears pick up the echoing, and as the sound returns to Ramar's ears, it bears with it the whispers of motes of Essence that sing of the cannon's next shot. He follows the trail of eldritch power back to the weapon, and then to those beside it. Ramar flies underneath Chi-Yosh and Davron, matching their speed as he calls out the positions of their foes to the archer. Only to peel off moments before smashing into a rock outcropping. "Take care of them! We can't keep this up forever..."

Behind the clustered wall, dozens of soldiers kneel. They see the flying vessels and their glowing occupants; the Anathema and the feral demons have brought hell to their home. There is no way the arrows nooked can chase the flying machines after they have went overhead, so as one the archers stand when the contraption draws within a dozen yards. Arrows blacken the sky like locusts.

By the will of Creation alone they do not meet their mark; the Solar first arching up, then diving to the side straight into the fringe of them. Wings coiled like a protective blanket, the Volo spins and thrashes, arrows batted aside or grazing along. Two make their mark - and Creation refuses to let them stay there - spitting them back out behind the machine. It falls several feet, before wings snap open, turning it airborne once more.

Again and again the Solar Queen faces the terrible weapon of her enemy, and each time she meets the explosive strike with her naginata. Each time she keeps her mount in the air, keeps her arms raised and ready for the next harrowing rain of radiant death. Her head is kept high, but the tremor in her arm is telling, and soon her entire weapon is glowing from the heat absorbed and about her a silver lion roars defiantly, showing no fear to even this foe.

But not just her arm's steadiness changes with each shot of blinding fire. At first it seems but a trick of the light, but under the rain of the ancient weapon Gallius' hair fades by steps, until in the end all color has been burnt from it, leaving her with a mane of silver, just as the lion above her.

Davron's head spins from the uncanny and erratic maneuvers of his companion and defender. "Damnation! Where's Ramar? I don't see - Ah! There! Chi-Yosh, off to the left! Higher! Got it! Now..." The golden bow Excelsior creaks as the string comes back, faint traceries of Essence running along the ornate carvings, and Davron narrows his eyes, falling into the battle-trance. In a moment, the howling wind of the desert, the beat of the volo's wings, the remaining vertigo from ... everything around Davron is but a grey mist except for the bow, the arrow... and the glint of the telescope's lens. Far far away, yet as near as across a narrow street.

The string is released, and the arrow flies. Chi-Yosh cries out in dismay - to him, it seems that Davron's shot veers off to the left by a mile - but Davron is unworried. "Watch..." he says, as the high winds of the desert alter the arrow's course. This way and that it is buffeted, but it seeks out the far-distant spyglass as if it had eyes.

"There Davron..." And it may be that Ramar alone is capable of following the arrow's path through the sky. He steadies his Volo, twisting artfully through the air, keeping his flight as straight as the arrow momentarily. He calls to Davron, "There are three more remaining," and then he shouts their positions, before falling beneath Davron, ready to distract the fire of the archers...

And far away, on the Essence-gun emplacement... "Okay, two degrees left", says the observer, "and up thr... what?" The observer has time to be astonished by the sight of an arrow momentarily in view before his spyglass erupts in a crash of shattering glass, and he falls to the floor as the arrow emerges from the eyepiece and pierces his skull. His two companions at the gun cry out, but the commander barks, "Hold your ground, men! Aim at the last designated target!" Looking out onto the battlefield, the gun-commander can just see the speck that is Chi-Yosh's volo in the distance, and another much smaller speck detaching itself and flying toward him...

The gun-crews scatter, and distant Davron can see them disobeying the order as the slender shaft of wood brings its grave pronouncement. And even at this distance the archer, his pilot, and his own observer can see the fate of the shot. It is absolutely flawless - until from seemingly out of nowhere a black-edged axe extends, catching the arrow on its cutting edge and slicing it in two. Stormclouds at Dusk stands beside the startled commander, staring up into the sky in the direction of the Volos. While the gun-crew and commander flee down the stairs of the tower to escape certain death, the Abyssal emissary regards the gun for a moment. Then he simply tips his hat politely in the direction of the Solars, and disappears down the stairs himself.

---

The battle through Kirighast has been short and bloody. The Legions, diverted through clever planning, cannot adequately defend their home - military planners did not anticipate the speed at which mammoth-assisted forces could break through the canyon defenses. The barbarians and beastmen gleefully slaughter the Home Guard, who are ill-prepared for Sand Spider's horrifying troops. Here and there pockets of resistance doubtlessly remain; but the palace is attained by sunset.

With the defenses outside cast aside the Solar Circle marches into the king's palace at Ma-Ha-Suchi's side. The ornate front door gets one look from the powerful Lunar and in the next it is flying off its hinges, struck so hard that the guards behind are flattened. A charging soldier is grabbed by Sand Spider and shaken like a kitten until several sickening crunches announce his passing. The body is cast aside like trash, having not even caused the Lunar warrior to break his stride.

The way now opened, Gallius prepares herself for what must lie ahead. Flanked by her most trusted friends and the fearless Lunars, she has no doubts that this war is finally won. There remains little else, save a few executions.

The throne room of the palace is elegant and sumptuous. And inside, Stormclouds at Dusk is waiting. He stands in a ring of lit candles, set at the center of the throne room floor. Nearby is the king of Harborhead - already stripped of his fine jewels and crown. With him are his wives and concubines, and apparently the entirety of his royal family. Children ages four to fourteen are crowded together, flanked by nemessary servants in their heavy black cloaks and silver masks. There is another here, too, a woman with skin of white alabaster. She has the beauty of an angel who has drunk poison and now awaits its lethal effects, and wears an ornate black robe embroidered with glyphs of occult significance.

Gallius narrows her eyes at the sight of the Abyssal, and notices that he is not alone, this time. "What brings you here, graverobbers?" says Gallius. "Flee or you will be destroyed!" Already she is readying the essence to give her enemy a wound that will not soon heal. There is no negotiation with the shadow.

_So this is what they are up to._ Ramar narrows his eyes as he takes in the scene. Every sense is reeling with information to be relayed, and Ramar takes it all in, calmly. He raises a curious eyebrow to the king of Harborhead and his family, then to the Deathknight and the alabaster skinned woman. "So now you have come. You will not be welcome here, you realize. Leave now, and leave alone. Take nothing with you. Or surrender. Be redeemed. Give up this foul corruption."

"An invitation," says the woman, softly, though her voice carries. "I am Nathicana, an ally of the king of Harborhead." She gestures to the deposed monarch. "I am here by invitation. I do not imagine you can say the same. I also must ask that you stay your weapons.. if the lives of those present mean anything to you." And here she gestures to the children, gathered quietly in a huddle.

Chi-Yosh is filled with a chill at the sight of the Death-touched. The Dawn is not surprised after the axeman's display earlier, but the presence of Stormclouds at Dusk sets the Su'Katan standing a little straighter. The weapon at his side feels heavy, fingers itching to grasp it. Still he walks forwards, pausing beside Gallius to give a curt nod towards the tall Death Knight. Though Nathicana's words give him pause. Glancing towards Stomrclouds at Dusk, "I'd say it's good to see you again, but I'd be lieing. Too bad we couldn't meet under better terms."

Davron looks over the scene with mingled dismay and resignation, though with little surprise. Speaking last of his Circle, he nods to Stormclouds at Dusk with the grudging admiration of one artist to another, remarking dryly, "Nice move back at the Essence-gun, I must say." He gestures with an empty hand at the hostages across the room. "Though I suppose this one is the more... impressive." Whatever he truly feels about the situation, he is keeping it in abeyance... for the moment.

Within the huddle, Davron and Chi-Yosh explain in quick words. Each candle is tied to a member of the Royal family like a macabre spiderweb; if one is extinguished, so is the life of the one linked to it. "I do not know if it works both ways," speaks Chi-Yosh, "It could be they cannot fully die until the candle is out, but do not put weight to that thought."

"You've gone to quite a bit of trouble to collect hostages, old friend," Davron says to Stormclouds as the Solars break from their huddle. "But what did you hope to gain?" Despite himself, the archer's voice wavers somewhat - it's one thing to conquer and slay in war, but something else entirely to watch the royal family die at the hands of Abyssal necromancy.

"So you would use these as your shields? I was mistaken. You are malicious cowards. Little more than bullies who have turned their back on their father after taking his sword. I am ashamed that you have fallen so far..." states Ramar, shaking his head. "Please... while you have the chance... it does not need to come to this."

It is not the big man who replies. "Did you know, o great Ma-Ha-Suchi, that we are the same as they?" asks Nathicana softly. "That the Abyssals and the Solars spring from the same mystic bloodlines?" Several of the Lunars look at each other, evincing disbelief or confusion. "It is true," the woman lilts, with a smile. "And for all of their professed desire to oppose us as messengers of death, look how ready their priest is to snuff out the children of a kingdom who gave her no offense at all.." She gestures with a hand at Gallius, and smiles. "We are truly of the same stock."

"It is easy to spin words, coward. It is even easier when you hide behind the lives of those you hold in your dark power. Your very existence is an offense to all of Creation. A taint." Ramar narrows his eyes.

Chi-Yosh's words are leveled upon the Abyssal witch, but they are for the Lunar. "And the Chimera are of the same bloodline as the Lunars. But they are things without minds and discipline, sucked up into the wyld and made primal and mad. The corruption of the Solars' bloodline is just more subtle and pretty."

"We have made a pact with these. Death will not be the end of existence for them," Nathicana says softly. "My master has prepared a place for them in his domain. Should they die here, as our brothers and sisters seem to wish, they will be taken care of." She eyes Ramar with a smile. "These are not mere words, brother. They are a pact. They are our agreement with the king."

"Then sister..." Ramar's eyes widen. _They truly have fallen. How can we have let this happen?_ "And what is to happen to them if they do not die here, but instead live a lengthy life and die of old age?"

"Then I am sure they will be as happy as any other mortal," replies Nathicana with a smile. "But would you allow that? Or would your Lunar allies allow it?"

Gallius ignores the Abyssals, now, though she wrinkles a nose. She speaks to the King. "So this is what you truly wish for your family, is it?" She shakes her head, "You have made me right. Truly you were never worthy of any rank above that of the meanest servant in a field. If you truly do wind up at the hands of the maggot kings, you may find they eat your flesh for eternity. In the land of shadow there is no joy." She is losing her patience with the stupidity of this particular mortal, and is more than a little tempted to send him on his way.

Davron sighs. "You merely seek to drive a wedge amongst our kindred, Nathicana. Were it otherwise, you would have taken these peoples' lives with you while we were entering, rather than wait here for us to arrive. Or was that too part of the pact? Did the king ask you to wait, that he might see us with his living eyes before he joined you?"

The King says nothing, glancing at his Exalted allies near their dark circle of candles. Nathicana smiles. "If a wedge is driven, it is not because of any lies we speak," she says quietly. "What I wish most is that all here see you for what you really are. The murderers who shout 'murderer' at their dark reflections."

Gallius hears that, clearly. "Dark shade, twisted wind," says Gallius. A smile finds its way to her lips. "Death must be for life to be. Chaos must be for order to exist. You and the Fair Folk are both insane, you are.. things that do not see that balance must exist, you would slay all and swallow all, leaving nothing. I bring death and life. I bring order and chaos. I am a servant of the Unconquered Sun, worm of the grave, and your presence here is no longer required."

"You are wrong," replies Ramar, his voice is without doubt. He smiles, though it is a sad smile as he watches them. "So twisted. I am sorry. I was perhaps too harsh on you. You do not see..." Ramar draws in a deep breath, and turns his gaze to the King and his Family. "And to you, I am also sorry. Your lives are mere pawns in a game between us... it should not be this way. You are worth more than this. Life is not a thing to be tossed aside casually. I am sorry." His voice doesn't waver, even as two tears trace a path down his cheeks.

Gallius turns her mind back to the King, giving him a very disapproving glance. "You did not answer me. Is this what you want? You know, I had planned on tutoring your children in an academy to rule this land one day, in having you live as a farmer. Is death better than that?" She studies him closely, "Is your pride so great that even knowing this you will hide in the grave?"

The king looks from the Abyssals to the Solars, then to Ma-Ha-Suchi, the goat-wolf hybrid, the monster out of nightmare. "You cannot restrain these Anathema," he croaks, gesturing with a hand to the assembled Lunars. "They would kill us first..." To which Ma-Ha-Suchi, to the evident surprise of the royal family, and the amusement of the Abyssals, steps forward and shakes his head. "I will spare your lives, if Gallius asks it of me, but on one condition." And with that he leans close, whispering something in Gallius' ear.

Gallius listens to the whisper and nods thoughtfully. "I do ask it, then," she says. "I offer you life and hope. They offer you a world of darkness and misery. The choice is yours. There is one here who can make this pledge as certain as the rising of the sun, if you should wish it."

"We will honor the terms of the pact," says Nathicana, smiling sweetly. "Well wishes, your majesty," she offers, bowing to the king. Black cherry-blossoms swirl in the air suddenly, engulfing her and stretching out to touch Stormclouds at Dusk, and the two are gone. The ring of candles flicker and fade, and yet the royal family remain alive. The threads of Essence are broken; their lives are their own again.

Gallius growls under her breath as the Abyssals flee. It is clear that though the war is won and things shall go as she wished, the Zenith is not happy. In fact, she is barely able to suppress the fury she feels, though somehow she does not reveal it in her voice. The clenched left fist, drawing blood, leaves little doubt to the more observant. "Come with me, King of Harborhead. We have to see to sealing the future of this land. It will be years before your children are ready to claim it, and yet we have little time to waste preparing it.. and preparing them." She wonders where the maidens are. It matters little right now. That will be resolved in time.

The king holds up a hand. "Wait," he says, in a tired voice. "Not yet." And with that said, he turns his attention to his children, his wives, embracing each of them tightly. Uncertainty is written on the faces of them all; the sense that their lives were held for a moment in greater hands than theirs, and the sense that other hands have now claimed them, is plain to see. And yet he comes in time, having made his farewells.

Chi-Yosh is both relieved and dissapointed as the Abyssals step back. While the royal family has their breath, the Abyssals are free, and the seeds of mistrust between Solar and Lunar may be planted. The Dawn finds the desire to break Nathicana's face, and it is haunted with the presence of it, for it makes her words burn with some glimpses of truth somewhere inside. Not to mention the anger he feels for the king, who gambled with the lives of his family, and how troubling he finds himself. The war is over, and it has left a bad taste in the Su'Katan's mouth.

Davron eyes the empty circle, and the smoke still wafting from the candle wicks. "So he slips through our fingers yet again..." he murmurs. "They seemed less than displeased. What have they won here today?" And as he asks that question, he ponders Ma-Ha-Suchi, the proud and headstrong warrior. Whatever the Deathlords have won today, guesses Davron, it was won at the Lunar's expense more than anyone else.

Gallius watches the King for a moment and sighs inwardly. She asks again why she came to this place. And again she answers that she had no choice. She reaches back in memory, trying to recall when she felt she had a choice that mattered. She murmurs softly, "Yes.. it was the choice to live." For some reason, it makes her smile. "The choice to live was the last free choice I had." She looks at the king's family for a moment, and then turns back to him. "Tell me about the succession you had in place," she begins. No doubt she and the King will be speaking for a long time. No doubt the Zenith will not sleep until conciousness is torn from her by exhaustion.
