# Gods of Eden 2004-05-22

In Harborhead, the Circle has discovere a missing piece in an old puzzle. Almost four seasons have passed since Ramar became aware of a hidden layer of fortifications managed by the long-gone Shogunate. The Solars have studied three ancient tapestries that hung in the throne room and chambers of the king, realizing that even the face of the land itself has changed since that time. The Fair Folk, who destroyed the old order, also destroyed some of the geography of the East. Mount Metagalapa is the most visible example, but enough else changed that their initial search for the rumored fortress was fruitless. Now, however, they know where to look.

There is a lake, near which the hinted redoubt can be found, and in studying detailed Guild maps of the northeast, Ramar is the first to find a likely candidate. The Solars set out, curious about this possible tie to the Realm's powerful defense grid, especially in light of their own needs for magical wards about their newly-acquired homeland.

---

The lake is long but narrow, and stretches out to the northwest as far as the eye can see. A forest grows hesitantly on the western side, expanding from the shoreline and growing in size as it crawls toward the setting sun. Spreading out from the forest is a thick carpet of grass and low bushes, covered liberally with flowers predominantly green and yellow in hue. In the far distance, a line of smoke curls up thin as sewing thread from some faraway encampment buried deep in the forest. But a nearer settlement is plainly visible, too: a cluster of spheres that bob low in the waters of the lake, rough and stony in texture. Their upper portions are painted in a rainbow of hues in abstract shapes, and their barely-visible bottom halves are dusky and damp. Each sphere is perhaps ten to twenty yards from top to bottom. They are connected together by an intricate maze of rope-bridges and cables, attached to the apex of each sphere.

Beyond commonality of size, the spheres all exhibit uniqueness. The color choices and design of the paintings that adorn the top halves of each are clearly not common to all. Several evidence thin stone chimneys, from which issues hints of smoke and a palette of scents that mix with the aromatic bounty of the forest and fields and waft on the gentle southeasterly breeze into waiting noses. In one particular case, three such orbs are bound together by wooden trusses, and support a fourth atop them. This last structure is apparently a building of some importance, if its size and the degree of interconnectedness in the rope-bridges leading to it is any indication.

The Solars, having approached by air, now make their way on foot. They have been observed, and as they reach the lake shore they are greeted by a small group of men and women who wait in a small coracle, all armed and looking suspicious. Upon identifying themselves and their business (in the most general terms), the wary air evaporates and the villagers welcome the group with smiles. "Come, come," they say, and row to the shore. The guests are brought aboard and the little boat returns itself to the strange village. Up the riggings and ropes the villagers climb, and their guests follow.

Dismounting from the rope bridges is easily accomplished through an open hatchway into the very pinnacle of the spherical dwelling; upon stepping down the brief ladder, a hatch-cover, presumably a shield against bad weather, can be seen. This "entry room" occupies the uppermost three yards of the orb, and a spiral staircase leading downward seems to be the principal feature of this chamber. The remainder of the room is painted uniformly green, a color that is welcoming and gentle on the eye. Potted plants are hung from hooks buried into the curved ceiling.

The spiral staircase leads downward, abutted up against a wall that bifurcates the abode. Against one wall is a fire-pit, and very literally so, for within a hemispherical bowl there cheerfully burns a fire, whose smoke rises easily into a tube and emits through the chimney above. Next to it is the kitchen, and occupying most of this partition is a low table, set into the floor, around which several divans are likewise emplaced. Thick pillows provide backing for those who sit.

The master of this strange little home is a wise-woman by her appearance; the occultists among the Exalted recognize the otherworldly air of her manner, and the tokens and signs of spirit chiminage adorning her body and clothes. "Welcome, strangers, chosen of the gods," she wheezes, smiling. "We are blessed by She of the Lake, our god, who protects us here. There are hobgoblins and creatures of no sane dream who haunt the woods beyond, but our lake water is death to them. But you we welcome." And thus is the floating village's nature made clear.

Gallius bows to the wise-woman. "I am Gallius Leom," she begins, and one by one she introduces her circlemates. "You have a lovely home here, in the safety of the waters," she adds. "I believe Ramar could best explain just why we are interrupting your peaceful lives." The Queen's eyes tilt to him curiously.

"Very well then." Ramar smiles a soft smile, while bowing his head respectfully to the Wise-Woman. "We have come to gain an insight into the time before the fair folk ravaged the land. To learn of the way things were before. To find and to explore."

"And what is it you wish to find?" she asks, with a cunning grin. "Herbs and other secrets of the forest? Or do you seek something else?" It's clear from her tone and features that she knows of something specific, and wishes for her guests to either admit to it or deny it.

"While we always hope to find herbs and secrets of the forest, and indeed, I and my companions will greatly appreciate such knowledge... we have indeed come in search of something more specific." Ramar smiles back, "There was once a fortress, when the Shogunate claimed to have rule of this land... it has long since been abandoned. But it is what we have come in search of, if such searches are welcome."

"Well, well, well," the old shamaness grunts, grinning. "You must dare the woods for that. If so, gather up some of our lake-water and take it with you, to ward off the creatures that infest the forest. And I will send our hunter." She turns to one of the men who greeted the Solars, who has waited about for further instructions. "Go and fetch Zin, he will be needed!" And as he takes his leave, she nods her head, looking thoughtful. "There is a great stone monument in the woods, and the hobgoblins shun it. I knew immediately that the gods' favored must be here for it, and nothing else."

"You are wise, I admit. I meant no insult to you, but we are cautious out of force of habit." Ramar smiles, then watches the man depart to fetch Zin. "How much water would you suggest we take then? And of course, I thank you for sharing your knowledge with us."

"Take whatever you need," counsels the wise-woman. "Whatever you can carry, I advise." She turns, and notes the return of the messenger. Another has come too - but what a strange person! The hunter Zin bows from the waist as he descends into the spherical home, smiling as he regains his full height.. of half a yard. His hair is green like the forest's leaves and his eyes sparkle like the lake waters at sunset. The tiny boy looks from face to face. "We'll leave when you are ready," he says with a smile.

"Of course. Is there any particular manner that the water is to be carried in?" Ramar bows as the hunter Zin strides into the sphere. "We shall be ready shortly, Hunter Zin. We need to collect the waters, and we will be on our way."

Gallius considers the hunter for a moment and arches a brow. Well, at least now she is just that much closer to being able to say she's seen everything. "Well, I imagine we should get started as soon as possible, then," she says neutrally.

Outside, the sunset sparkles across the lake water. Davron casts his spell, freezing solid a sheet of the lake surface. With a single accurate stroke, Gallius' naginata shatters the sheet into pieces, which are quickly and easily retrieved - the ice shards make ideal throwing weapons and may have other uses as well. More water is gathered into skins and stoppered bottles, and Zin leads the way toward the woods. "The twilight is the ideal time," he explains. "There are creatures who move only during the day, and others who move only at night. This time, the between time, is when most are somnolent." Despite his small size he is remarkably agile, showing signs of his fae heritage as he moves.

Through the forests the Solars and their strange little guide travel. More than once they are called upon to defend themselves; Davron's bow, tipped with ice-shards, and Chi-Yosh's accurate throwing arm, send hobgoblins fleeing - or leave what's left of the nightmare-creatures, no two of which look the same, vanishing into wisps of glamour. By nightfall the party has made it to a great stone mound, deep in the heart of the woods. There is an entrance which Ramar's keen eyes can discern, but which is obscured almost completely by rubble. Gallius again makes short work of this difficulty, and as a cloud of dust rises around them, the Solars discern a pathway, leading into the darkened hillside.

Zin waits outside, professing disinterest in anything that's not under open sky. The more perceptive eyes of the party's lore-wise members, though, note the faint hints of Essence that pervade the place, dimly recognizing them as a defense of some kind. It seems that Zin's blood bars him from fully passing inside, and this thought at least gives them comfort - no hobgoblins will disturb them either.

"So it falls to us then to learn what we can from this place." Ramar looks around, smiling a wary smile. "Although I am worried about what lurks within these halls after such a long time has passed. Shall we then?"

"We shall," answers Gallius calmly. "We must continue as we have started."

"I am not worried," says Davron, bending the string of Excelsior idly. "Not overmuch. We have overcome difficulties before, and we will do so again."

The twisting, claustrophobic tunnels become more developed, showing signs of workmanship of greater and greater sophistication. The Solars descend through dark spaces untouched since the Contagion, using their Caste Marks for illumination. There are no signs of danger, and yet a terrible death has reigned here for centuries, and the weight of the ages hangs on the walls. Though dust in quantity can be found on every surface, not even a spider-web hints at the presence of life in this tomb-like fortress.

At last the principal area of the fortress is reached, and its regular layout offers no resistance to navigation. Everything seems to be centered around a single sealed chamber, locked at the heart of the fortress. The Circle can at last find a single doorway that leads to this enigmatic core. It is sealed through magic, but as the Caste Marks of the Solars shed their light across it, it opens without hesitation. Overhead is a label, identifying that which lies beyond, and in the common tongue, Davron renders the meaning of the ancient script: "The Great Machine of the Coordinators of the Defense of the Blessed Realm".

"Is it just me... or is there something decidedly ominous about that title..." Ramar studies the ancient script rather eagerly, filing away it's form and patterns for later. He draws in a deep breath, which only accents the silence of the surroundings, instead of shattering it. With a hand reaching back to grip Swift South Winds nervously, he nods towards the door, moving inside.

Gallius just smiles to herself and moves onward. This is part of the Solar inheritance, and she means to reclaim it.

Davron simply follows, his eyes growing wide as he finishes reading the inscription. He smiles broadly to Ramar. "Ominous? Nay, I believe this is what we came here to find." Perhaps the mere words 'Great Machine' have invoked Davron's cupidity for all manner of lore. Regardless, he follows close behind.

The very nexus of the Great Machine pulses like a hyperactive heart. The continual flow of Essence through this chamber, for the moment unguided by any force, can be felt by every one of the Chosen present. The sound of water sloshing nearby and the vibrations of machinery buried deep beneath this chamber contribute their voices to the primal song of this central room. A dizzying array of scents and odors also clouds the chamber, everything from the recognizable smell of oil and industrial lubrication to hints of smoke and sulfur. The air is thick with it, the fetid breath of a mechanical Behemoth. The riveted walls of steel form the room into a sphere, perhaps twenty yards in overall diameter. Ringing the room are arcane sigils and characters, composed of almost all the Five Magical Materials in varying proportions - only soulsteel is absent. Above and below these sigils, shuttered vents can be seen, all in the closed state.

Human access is provided by a catwalk that leads from the doorway to almost two-thirds of the way to the center of the room, and wide enough to accommodate two people abreast. It is supported by steel cables strung from the ceiling, which double as hand-holds. To the left of the entranceway is an alcove of sorts, into which a single person can step. The alcove offers a complex arrangement of levers, dials, knobs, gauges and meters, most of which measure either pressure or supply.

Pipes of all sizes, shapes and descriptions hang from the ceiling or jut from the floor, crazily angled. In most cases, cables or gears connect to several segments of a given pipe, apparently connected to the alcove's intricate maze of controls, permitting an operator to control direction and angle. Fittings of brass and other more obscure materials connect the pipes at different points. At the apex of this spherical room is a glass hemisphere, embedded into the ceiling and faintly glowing with an almost living energy. Below it, at the very core of the room, there is a hint of motion, an almost-visible glimmer, that suggests unformed Essence being gathered together expectantly.

Davron's eyes sparkle as he takes in the fantastic complexity of the machine. "Wow. This is... I've _dreamed_ of working with something like this..." he breathes, stepping forward toward a nearby pipe as if to brush his fingers against it... drawing his hand back as some instinct suggests otherwise. Rousing himself from his fascinated trance, he explains to his companions. "This is a mechanism for manipulating elemental Essence," he says as he walks toward the controls, drawing a distinction thereby from other varieties of Essence. "It's... not a weapon, not exactly, nor even a means of creating wards. But what it _is_... I'm not sure. And I can only think of one way to find out."

He studies the controls at the far end of the catwalk, nodding to himself - the arrangement is strangely familiar to him, as it follows the principles of magic as he knows them from the occult texts he has studied, as well as other hints from memories he didn't even know he had. Memories of another time, perhaps... He turns to his companions, noting their worried expressions.

"I _do_ understand this well enough to not do any serious harm," says Davron, "or at least to shut it down quickly if it does something we don't want. And in any case, we should be safe enough in here. All the same... keep your wits about you. This thing manipulates a _lot_ of Essence, and just about anything could happen. Within controllable parameters."

A klaxon begins blaring from some hidden source, an ugly, nerve-torturing sound that reverberates through the sphere. Three pipes swing as one toward the center of the room, and begin vomiting out sawdust. A torrent of water gushes down from almost all of the vertical pipes hanging from the ceiling. Nozzle arrangements set into the pipes fan the flow of water out evenly, creating a sort of curtain through which the sawdust is blown at high speed. The klaxon changes pitch, then, and the shutters snap open. Torrential winds blow through them, and overhead, the glass hemisphere's gentle light begins to intensify.

As Davron activates the machine, and the shutters snap open, Ramar heeds some instinctive knowledge deep within the recesses of his mind. He walks slowly down the catwalk, breathing steadily as his Anima begins to flow in harmony with that of the Essence that emanates from the machine...

A ghostly galaxy springs to life, visually manifesting itself inside the great chamber. Using Ramar as the focus, and the core of the rapid intermixture of elements as an energy source, the display flickers and solidifies at last. Phantasmal images hover about in a flat plane, with lines of power running visibly between them. The whole display seems to be rotating gently, like a compass in search of a direction to point toward. More than once, some aspect of the mandala passes through the catwalk, or the solid bodies of the Solars. Some of the clustered nodes are brighter than others, and all bear one of many aspects - the colors of jade here and there, the gold and silver and dark violet of the Celestials, even the deep and forbidding blue-black of death.

Some of the points of light depicted by the display seem filled; others appear hollow, as though something is missing from the heart of them. And something else as well - almost all of them display a solid boundary around them. Some, though, have a hazy border.

Davron watches in fascination as the display spins. After a while he comes to a conclusion. "It's a geomantic map. The points of light are Manses - there aren't enough of them to include Demesnes as well. The color and brighness indicate what kind of Essence, and its strength." He scratches his head. "Hollow and filled points... perhaps that indicates whether the Hearthstone is still in its socket? Notice that the ones with fuzzy boundaries are almost always filled? Fuzzy points may mean unattuned Manses - and who would take a Hearthstone from a Manse without attuning to it?"

"Someone who wishes to steal the stone to prevent someone from benefitting from an attunement?" Chi-Yosh looks over the great map with consideration. "Or Manses that have been stolen from by thieves?" If nothing else, this could lead the Circle straight to unclaimed Manses. A hearthstone goldmind.

As Ramar's mind focuses and directs itself toward a particular sphere of light, whose boundary is wavering and whose heart is filled, the mandala changes - it magnifies itself quickly, then unfurls outward again. The map is no longer centered where it was; its center is now on the point of light Ramar selected. And in brilliant letters of fire that appear written in the air beside it, the Manse is named and identified - The Manse of the Garden of Ever-blooming Romance. Its stone, too, is depicted and detailed, a rotating phantasm that hangs in the air like a dream-temptation.

"The Manse of..." Ramar blinks a few times. "Interesting... this is very very fascinating. And more useful than I could have imagined. Although... I have to wonder what made this place fall into disuse? Do you think it had something to do with the grid being activated?" Ramar ponders curiously, "Can you set it for Air and Water? I would like to see just how far reaching this is... perhaps my Manse is there. Either way, we shall have to visit this Garden of Ever-blooming Romance."

Ramar says, "You know... it makes you wonder what else this might display..."

"Many things were lost in the Great Contagion," says Davron in a quiet but carrying voice. "How this facility came to be one of them, I know not; perhaps other such devices exist, and this one was not needed. Should I try changing the elemental controls?"

"It could be that it will only work for Solars," says Gallius softly. "Or it could be that it was simply too much power to remain in lesser hands."

Gallius, of all people, is undistracted by the lure of the machine's potentialities, and she alone can discern the nature of the Hearthstone being depicted. While the men continue their slack-jawed study of the structure, she takes a closer look. The stone seems to have power over love and romance, perhaps aiding the bearer's own efforts, or assisting the bearer in creating unions among others.

Eventually all good things must come to an end; the reserves of the elements the machine depends on are being depleted for every minute of use the machine sees, though Davron is confident he can re-stock them. The controls are re-set, targeting the far north; Ramar can indeed confirm that Icehame, his Manse, is (or at one time was) part of the grid the Great Machine taps into. There is no special indication or connection of ownership beyond what the machine already shows, however.

Davron sighs softly as he carefully shuts down the Machine. Being at the controls of such a wondrous device was... indescribable. "It's almost a shame to have to leave," he comments, with a small grin. "But then, if we stayed here for the rest of our lives, how would we reach these Manses?"
