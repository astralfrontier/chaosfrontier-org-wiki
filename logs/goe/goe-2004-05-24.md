# Gods of Eden 2004-05-24

Gallius frowns in thought. She is far from alone. Men picked at random stand about her, awaiting orders. Or suggestions, depending on how deep their fear runs for the one conquerer who isn't destroying whole cities. She has ordered the people to evacuate their cities, leaving their trifles behind.

Most come with little but food and skins full of water. A few had tried to bring gold out, but beastmen managed to put a stop to that swiftly enough. Craftsmen were allowed to bring what tools they could, and animals and weapons were also brought, but not all weapons.

Spears, slings, and bows all abound of the weapons brought here, but there are no swords, no battle axes, no halberds or shields. Every weapon must be useful for hunting, and so these men have come. But they are not the only ones summoned here.

The followers of Tamuz also are present, here to provide knowledge of how to hunt to men whose hands never knew a callous, and to women who were more used to carriages than their own feet. With all these drawn together, Gallius and some of her circlemates pass on their orders.

Gallius speaks first, and she does with her usual calm, as if what she were asking were just a little thing. "First the most able bodied shall be taught the hunt, and then those less-skilled. The people of Tamuz cannot spend their whole lives teaching, so those taught must in turn teach all the others, until every man or woman who has seen twelve summers knows how to live on their own."

Chi-Yosh follows after Gallius. "Those who are not being taught to hunt first shall be taught about the plants. Which are safe to eat, which are not. The most able minded will be schooled in medicine. The knowledge of farming will be crucial to all of you; the hunt cannot sustain all."

Gallius nods to Chi-Yosh, "It is a beginning. In time, what was taken away shall be returned." Though not as it was, of course. "Your cities shall not be as they were. You have strayed from the right way of Creation. Men are not above nature, they should live as part of it." She frowns deeply before going on.

"It is not just that which needs changing. This scheming and plotting against one another will be put to an end. The dangers of these days are too great for men to go out of their way to kill each other." Gallius considers these men of Harborhead carefully for a time. "You realize that all but a handful of you would be dead if you were not to be aided by those you call barbarians."

"But..." Ramar speaks up then. His voice is soft at first, but as he speaks it grows stronger and stronger. "We will help you to survive. Those of you who are neither learning to farm, nor to hunt, shall learn the ways of the desert. You will learn to survive the biting heat and the bitter cold. You will learn where it is safe to find shelter, and where the canyons will do little more than spell an early end to your days. You will learn to live with the land."

The men of Harborhead look more than a little uncertain. Seeing their homes destroyed had a profound effect. Hearing that their lives were narrowly spared added to that. Learning that their very existance depends upon those who are involved in all these acts and the war that laid low their kingdom has not made things easier. Most are pale and tight-lipped, their eyes betraying the strain. They look as if they might run, if they had anywhere to go.

Gallius reads the men and turns her mind towards lightening the blow. "The rebuilding of dwelling places will begin once the Nation of the Sun can get men here to aid you in this. You are not being alone, and you will not be left to starve. We are here to help you find your way again."

Gallius sees her words bring some measure of relief back to these strangers who now, she imagines, are also going be part of her kingdom. A rather wildly set one, at that. At least a river can span the distance. "I have arranged for tools of learning to be spared destruction. There will be a library among the other things we build, and it shall be open to everyone who wishes to learn."

"The acquisition of new slaves shall cease immediately," Gallius adds, her voice draining of emotion. "Any man who tries to buy another shall forfeit his life for the act. Other laws I shall give you tomorrow, and they shall be marked. Honor takes time to grow into habit, and if you slip into your old ways you will surely perish. Do not forget that who you were is gone. Who you shall become is what matters now. I hope you will aid me in creating a future for Harborhead that is beyond anything you have dreamed of, but if not..." Her silence speaks loudly enough.

Clearly the thought of retribution weighs heavily on the men assembled. Though none speak, their concerns are expressed visibly on their faces. When men are in mortal danger, they will fall to their knees to embrace any savior, no matter from where it emerges. But when their lives are succored, their fears turn to mistrust; when men are protected behind a shield, their tongues turn to those of serpents as they speak of the opposition they no longer fear. So it may be with the people of Harborhead.

Silently, or at least too silently for the crowd to hear, Ramar addresses Gallius. "They are concerned for now, Lady, but in time we will assuage their fears. I have some thoughts on how we may help them, when we have the chance to discuss it."

"Harborhead was once a place that held itself on the backs of slaves." Chi-Yosh's eyes touch those of the men gathered. "Upon hearing of its' downfall, your neighbors would be taking up banners of raiding in revenge. But we shall ensure they will not. Those who have had their loved ones stolen from them shall be compensated and agree to not to return the favor. Just as you shall make no slave, nor shall you be made any."

Gallius sifts the words, though her mind is more on the men of Harborhead. Tamuz's people seem as calm as ever, except for the occasional sign of disdain they show for the civilized men. "In any case, learning must begin as quickly as possible. And you need not fear, the Brides of Ahlat have not forgotten their people. You will not be left as prey for the other nations." Whom Gallius imagines she'll have to crush just to settle this part of the world. Maybe she can talk to Ma-Ha-Suchi about it..

---

The throne room of the king, Shanam of Harborhead, is now open to the air. Ma-Ha-Suchi has left this much intact for now, that any who come to the city can witness the power that brought low the slaver nation. Three of the most prominent tribes have sent their elders and representatives here. Now, they speak with Gallius, the other Solars, and Tamuz himself.

A strong-looking, short woman named Ab is their leader. She is joined by a tall, thin, and weatherbeaten man called Ri Ni, and a thickly muscled warrior, Bonebreaker. Ab is speaking, having explained her concerns about Harborhead's slaving ways. "We want our people freed," she says, simply. "Let us come for them, and we will not attack the citizens. But we want something, and I want to see how greedy you outlanders intend to be."

Ab points at the throne. "Break this into pieces. Send a piece to the leaders of the tribes as a sign. They know its shape. Send a jade coin with each slave who goes free. Send one for each family wronged. It will be their talisman of victory. This is what our god has commanded."

In answer, Gallius turns to the throne and frowns. For a moment, she stands there, in the next, she is bursting aglow, and there is a gust of air as she strikes like twin lightning bolts. In front of her in a radius of many strides lies the remnants of the throne. "The jade shall be gathered by those who owned slaves," she says flatly. "Those who refuse to gather what they owe from the ruins can explain themselves to you and you will do what you will to them, but they will not become slaves." She has some mercy, but not much for a slave owner, it seems. "They will need some time to gather what is required. Can you be ready in a week's time?"

Ab bows low. "Our people have been ready for years to take our blood-debt from Harborhead," she avers. "There will be peace." Tamuz inclines his head slowly, as well. "If the tribes will accept jade as a price for their humiliation and loss, I and my people will not contest it. We have no use for money; nor do the tribes. But it will be a respectable trophy," he says with a careful smile.

Gallius does not answer further, but wears an emotionless mask over icy fury. She isn't sure who she is angry at, nor why, at first. The weight of thousands of lives seemed lighter when battle was all she faced. Slavers. Justice is cheated in what she does here. They ought to face far worse than a week of terror as they scramble to gather coin. She will add to the price, but that will be her little secret.

---

Gallius has had her time to settle the issue of slaves now, and has managed to put her wrath away until a chance to make use of it should present itself. It will, she imagines. Eventually she will find herself destroy Abyssals, and Fair Folk, and heavens know what else before she finally dies. This day, however, she has sent word to Tamuz and to Koriko to come to her as soon as may be arranged.

It is at the top of one of the fortification-walls that the Solars, and their fellow Koriko, meet. Ma-Ha-Suchi and Tamuz have come together, apparently discussing business of some kind. "Well," booms the hybrid elder, glancing about at the ruins of Kirighast. "Strange bedfellows indeed."

Gallius maintains her calm with an effort. It seems she's making a lot of efforts to hold back these days. "I will be leaving soon," she says flatly. "I mean to return, but lately I've had doubts as to how long the web means the Queen of the Nation of the Sun to continue her story. I wish to appoint a pair of regents to see that things here are handled as well as they can be. If I do return, I will not be pleased if I see nothing but shallow graves. I shall be equally angered if I should return to find cities rebuilt as they were."

"Shallow graves and fine cities aside... we do need to discuss the regents and the governance of Harborhead." Ramar studies the faces of the gathered Exalts, keeping an eye out for signs of their thoughts seeping through into their words or faces. "Naturally there is much to be gained by holding such positions, so I wager we'll need to talk about what is to be done, and who is to be appointed..."

Ramar says, "And of course, what everyone hopes to gain from the outcome of all of this."

"And who would you put in power, given the choice?" asks Ma-Ha-Suchi, evenly.

"For one, the people must have a face they know and who cares for them," says Gallius. "Koriko, if she is willing, shall stand as one regent." The eyes of the Queen shift to Tamuz. "I turn to you to suggest another who shares a hope for the future of these people. I have no time or patience for those who will hate this task. I need one who follows the Silver Pact and who will guide these people to a new honor."

"Tamuz would choose one of his friends in the south," observes Ma-Ha-Suchi with canny smile. "Sun and Moon as regents, eh?" For his part, Tamuz shakes his head. "I do not think keeping the Brides in Harborhead will help the people find their way," he says, "but we must wait and see if it develops into a problem. I will call a woman, who hails from the cities but loves the peace of the sand, and she will serve admirably. Her name is Solitary Rose." Koriko listens to the two Lunars with wariness in her eyes. "And I will see to it that none pillage and despoil Harborhead - whether from inside or out," she says, carefully.

"We will see," says Gallius evenly. "I would take the Brides with me, if I felt that what was left behind would keep these people safe," she explains. "I do not wish to have to destroy every nation nearby later for daring to disrupt my plans." But she will, if they do, is the clear implication.

"Sun and Moon ruled once before... perhaps the time is at hand for them to work once more." Ramar considers this carefully, smiling a secretive smile. _There is indeed hope for Creation..._ "Lady Gallius, I do not believe it is necessary to wreak havoc on the nations nearby. I trust that Koriko and Solitary Rose shall prove themselves as capable as can be. And we will be helping the transition until it is time to leave."

"Have no doubts about me," sneers Koriko, studying Ramar a moment. "I have faced greater challenges than this." The Lunars whisper among themselves for a few moments, then Tamuz speaks. "As long as they are not attacked, the people here will survive. Some will die; those who refused to learn another way certainly will. The strong will become prominent; the weak will fade. That is right."

Gallius nods to Tamuz. "That is as it should be. Only the strong core shall go on to make the new Harborhead. The weak wood shall rot away." She turns her eyes to Koriko then, and just looks at the woman for a time with a flat stare, judging her, obviously. "You will do well. When I return, I expect those still alive will be ready for the changes I shall bring with me. For now, though, they must suffer the pain of sudden growth."

"You misunderstand, Koriko. I have no doubts about either yuo or this Solitary Rose. As I said, I trust you." Ramar smiles, then turns to regard Tamuz and then Gallius as they speak. "What changes will you bring, Lady Gallius?"

Gallius does not speak for a very long time, staring off at the horizon. Finally her voice lifts, "I will bring the changes needed to ready these men for the coming of the next age. They think they have seen war. They think they have known hardship. If they are to survive, they must realize that only through terror and pain will peace and joy be returned to the world in any lasting fashion."

"I am not so sure about that, Lady Gallius. The difficult road is not one meant to be walked by all, nor is it necessary, just yet. Perhaps it may be, but it may be that there is another path to take." Ramar speaks quite thoughtfully, taking the time to mull over his words. "But I do not believe this is the time for this discussion..."

For a moment Gallius' expression darkens, but it is gone swiftly, leaving one to wonder if it ever changed in the first place. She answers simply, "What will be, will be. We are done, if there are no more questions."

---

The meeting has broken up; the Lunars are satisfied that the fate of Harborhead will be the memorable "ruin of history" that Ma-Ha-Suchi intended, while Koriko is grudgingly satisfied that the people she has known and loved are to be treated fairly and cared for, even by those who broke the back of the nation that they called home. It seems that lives matter more to her than which flag flies, and that is well.

Chi-Yosh is the last in line as Gallius, Ramar, and he walk toward the capital's ruined heart. Davron awaits there, and he has been hard at work examining the Essence cannon that was emplaced on a tower. The energizing mechanism was destroyed, showing clear signs of axe-work, but he is optimistic that it can be repaired. And as the three Solars clear the fallen gates of the city, Chi-Yosh feels a light tapping on his left shoulder.

Chi-Yosh is pleased with the fact the Essence cannon is salvageable. While it would serve the Nation as a defense, the weapon is nearer to the Realm's shores, and could repel any reclaiming invasion. Muscles driven through with Essence, allowing him to tear away and lift debris among the gates, his attention is left to the task at hand, unaware of being crept up upon. At the tap, he peers over his shoulder, before stepping to better face the one behind him.

There's nothing there, as Chi-Yosh turns, nothing except a small block of wood on the ground. It seems to have been whittled at with a knife, and on it are clearly marked characters in the common tongue of the East: "I hear you need a spy. I offer my services."

Chi-Yosh clucks his tongue as he collects the block of wood. With a nod of his head, the message is tossed into the air casually before him. "He who has left this message is good. Show yourself, that I might shake your hand."

It is Ramar's first reaction to let all of his senses search for this supposed spy... even to the point that Essence aids his search. He smiles, "It seems as though we have found an answer to one problem... I was not aware we needed a spy though."

The wood block is intersected by a knife in mid-flight; both land roughly on the ground. The knife bears only a single character: "Service". It seems that if one takes the knife, one accepts the offer that is written on it.

Chi-Yosh considers this option. He prefers to see who he is dealing with. Yet, perhaps it is better he not know; the truelly anonymous cannot be exposed even by his superiors. The Dawn walks forward and plants his foot upon the block, yanking the knife out, flipping it in his hand.

Ramar removes the mask from within the confines of his robes. He scans about once more, attempting to get his bearings, before he straps the plain white mask on his face. For a moment or so he staggers about as though drunk... and then he removes the mask, and sighs. "Well... I suppose it was a mistake to bring this... and even moreso to wear it. No sign of our mysterious assistant."
