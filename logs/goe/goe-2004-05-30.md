# Gods of Eden 2004-05-30

Before the Harborhead campaign, before Greyfalls, the Circle had traveled to Chi-Yosh's village. So long ago, it seems. They had learned of the City of Dreams, a city graced by Lesell, the First Age Solar who's followers began the village. But the trip to it had been put off for more pressing things. Now, the yearning for history, for the answers to heritage burn in the heart. They are more pressing. The Skyship setles down just beyond the village itself, and the Dawn disappears inside to see the Shisha, and retrieve those loyal to him.

Returning to the ship is the Solar, followed by two men of similar stature. Los-Mian is tall with a queue of autumn leaf red, a quiver of javelins slung over his shoulder. The other is lighter in complexion and hair, more solid with - to Ramar's guessing - more Northern blood. He carries a simple bundle upon his shoulders, climbing beside Los-Main onto the ship, both wide eyed with wonder at the sight of the pyramid birthed in the First Age. "These are members of my Circle," Chi-Yosh informs the pair. "They will be making this journey possible."

The pair bow, and pleasantries are exchanged, while Chi-Yosh removes something carefully from a sack. Growing from the blessed dirt in a tiny, ceramic pot on a sight to behold. A blossom with petals of living gold, rich enough for Davron to attest as Orichalcum. The stem is something all together, crystal as green as emeralds, brittle and see-through. The flower itself leans into the warmth of Helios, reflecting beams of light across the ship's deck. "This, I am told, grew at the heart of the tree. It will get us within the city itself."

Davron looks almost entranced by the bloom, studying it from all angles. "How did this come to be, do you know? Did its seeds come from the Wyld, or was it formed by more formal sorcery?" He blinks, looking up, and chuckles self-deprecatingly. "Sorry. Prodigies like this are fascinating to me."

Chi-Yosh draws the throng up around his neck, letting the blossom's pot bounce across his chest. "I do not know. The Su'Katan is a thing beyond words; perhaps it gave birth to the seeds on its' own." He cups the pot, letting Talu and Los-Main marvel in turn.

Talu walks across the deck, giving a heavier step here and there, testing the deck with a satisfactory nod of his head. "Very good hands built this," He concludes, rapping knuckles across the railing.

"Of course they did," responds Ramar. "And very good hands are about to fly them." Ramar jumps behind the controls, and the engines within the pyramid power up. It lifts into the air effortlessly, floating along on the breeze under Ramar's careful guidance. He grins, "Well then, Chi-Yosh... where to now?"

The Dawn strides beside Ramar, rolling out a map and pointing. "We are here," He informs, tapping a dot on the map. "Our course, here." Showing the circle-mark on the map, "We will have to go..." A glance upwards at the sun. "Northwest, then west." Behind him, the pair of mortals are clinging to the railing as the ship lifts, looking over the side.

It takes about a day of flying, with the skyship staying high, and within cloud cover where they won't easily be spotted. The sun is setting as the skyship sets down and Ramar informs them, "We're close to Nathir, we can go there if you'd like, but I am not sure how visible you wish to be."

Thousands of miles have gone under the keel of the strange craft, and the landscape below is strange to the eye as the ship descends toward a hilly, rolling area. A cliff-top, hundreds of feet above Nathir's elevation, and half a mile from the city itself, seem to provide adequate protection against observation. A small grove nearby, and berry-bushes interspersed among the green grasses that grow on the high plain, suggest food and shelter for the night.

As the whistle of the wind fades, and the strength of the gusts of higher elevations gives way to the gentler ground-level breezes of early evening, the three Solars and their two mortal guests detect the scent of a cook-fire. Curiously they glance around, spotting a thin and anemic trail of smoke emanating from the top of one gentle hillock. It seemingly rises from the very earth itself, and walking about to get a closer look, they spot a wooden door set into an embankment in the side of the hill. There is a house here, built under the hill, and its occupant must be home.

Chi-Yosh is reminded of the homes set in the lake near the Northern Fortress. Yet, there is no telling what may dwell within the home itself, for stories are chocked full of unique or eccentric fae or spirit. The Dawn creeps forwards, silent over the grass, to crouch at the wooden door. He inspects the soil for tracks, and listens intent beyond the wood.

The door bursts open and a haggard-looking old woman, back hunched, dressed in foul rags and smelling like woodland, is behind it with gnarled fingers on the door-handle. "Ah! Hah! Thought you'd be spyin' on me!" she exclaims, indignantly, in a shrill voice that could crack tempered glass. "Thought you'd be flyin' down in your fancy ship to be spyin' on me! Ha! I know better!" And with that she reaches out, grabbing ahold of one of Chi-Yosh's ears and tugging him toward the inside of the home-under-hill.

The Dawn is not the only one investigating the curious house under the hill. Ramar has disembarked from the Skyship and now turns his senses to this house, his senses heightening as the door opens. He blinks as the old woman drags Chi-Yosh inside. "Er... wait up!" He rushes after his friend, looking worried.

Chi-Yosh's limbs flail as he is dragged inside. "No! Wait! Ma'am - Ow! Let go plea - ow!" He disappears inside the doorway, the only thing escaping the woman's grip are various exclimations.

Inside the little hovel, a fire burns in a hearth. An iron cauldron hangs over the flame, and inside a stew is cooking. The place is crammed - packed with old and crumbling books, carved wooden figurines, star-gazing tools, and complicated skeins of beads and thread. "Ahh, yes, good, your friends are coming," the old woman croaks with a black-toothed grin. "Come in!"

Davron, likewise needing a break from sky-travel, comes up behind Ramar, an arrow tipped with a wooden ball nocked on his bowstring. "What's going on?" he mutters to Ramar for a moment, then takes in the scene for himself. As Chi-Yosh disappears into the hovel, he heads after them. "Old woman!" he calls, with a voice firm but not yet hostile.

There's one other thing to be found here, lying on the pile of furs and quilts that must answer for a bed. A young woman, unconscious or asleep, dressed in the plain green garb of an Eastern forester. Her dirty blond hair is plaited and a braid trails down as far as her waist. Her breathing is shallow and troubled.

Ramar suppresses a chuckle at Chi-Yosh's predicament. _It might well have been me in that situation..._ The Solar ponders the situation a moment, "Er yes thank you. Good evening. Er... who are you? And is she alright?" Ramar indicates the young woman on the pile of furs.

The old woman has let go of Chi-Yosh, and turns her back to the trio, lifting the lid of her stew-pot to take a long sample of the aroma of the food. "Well, well, well," she mumbles. "The stars did not lie after all.."

Chi-Yosh takes the time to rub his ear, once it has been released. He then takes stock of the surroundings, catching sight of the books, and equip- labored breathing turns his head around. With no answer forthcoming, he crosses to the woman, kneeling down to check for signs of her ailment.

Ramar tilts his head slowly, a curious look coming across his features. "Hmm. Er, what exactly is it that the stars have told you? Were we to be expected then?"

The young woman on the bedding turns a bit, fitfully, as Chi-Yosh examines her. She mumbles a few words, then rolls again, hands clenching and unclenching. Her skin is sweaty, and after several seconds a brief but brilliant mark shines from her forehead - the outlines of a golden circle. And then it fades again. "She had a touch too much sun," observes the old woman from her stewpot.

Davron raises an eyebrow in fascination. "The stars may be obscure, but they seldom lie - although there are better experts in their lore than ourselves..." The remainder of his spoken questions are Ramar's, and need no repetition, though a practiced eye scans the shelves as he attempts to gauge his surroundings. And then the all-too-familiar glint upon the young woman's forehead catches his eye.

"That man came to me, told me others would be along to claim this girl. Just as the stars foretold he would!" The old woman chuckles again, and begins to ladle out supplies of stew. "And here you are. And SPYING ON ME!" Again, her shrill tone shakes the nerves of those inside the hut.

Chi-Yosh traces his fingers over the spot on her forehead, lips pursed. That's quite a feat. He knows of few diseases that actually cause images to bubble up on the skin - except for some used as omens by a specific set of spirit. "Spying on you because we were told to come here," assures Chi-Yosh, a sly glance spared to Ramar. "We were informed by a bird that we were needed here. I had to investigate."

"Ah!" The crone's tone makes it clear that everything is explained. "Well, then, you are welcome to take this poor unfortunate off my hands. But stay for stew, you undeserving, creeping, skulking little wretches!"

Ramar clasps his hands to his ears as the old woman's voice reaches that shrill tone. He smiles apologetically, "My apologies for the spying, but thank you very much for the offer of stew. What is it made from, I wonder?"

Davron chuckles, and settles himself to the ground. "Aye, we've encountered the young lady's condition before, right enough. She'll be all right, we'll see to that. Though she'll never be the same, poor lass."

Chi-Yosh smiles to himself before nodding gravely to Davron. He sits down by the furs, crossing his legs. "Might we have two extra bowls? There are two more men on the ship, and they are no doubt hungry."

"There's plenty of rabbit stew for everyone," the old crone says, smiling and showing her teeth in the process. "I'm sure if those men are with you, they're conniving, no-account jackals just like you, but even jackals get hungry." She waves a hand. "So come, get yourselves comfortable."

"So... what is your name, if I might ask?" Ramar takes his stew and studies it carefully, sniffing it for a moment. He looks to his companions, "So we're to take her with us? Where then shall we go next?"

"On course," replies Chi-Yosh as he takes a taste of the stew, before blowing on the next spoon-full. Hot. "She can remain on the ship. There is no telling how long we will take in the city. Unless you would like to return somewhere safe?"

"Very well then. If you believe that to be the best course, we shall do so... I have to wonder how she will feel about this?" Ramar inclines his head, "Perhaps we should at least wait until she's awake? I would hate to be the one explaining to her where she was and what was going on while aboard the ship..."

Ramar says, "After all, we must consider what she wants as well, my friends."

Chi-Yosh nods sagely. "And quite a burden to anyone who is left at the ship. And if none stay, she may wander off. Good thought."

Ramar considers this, then rephrases his statement, "And what if she does not wish to come with us?"

Davron nods. "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, Ramar. Ultimately, we must all decide where our souls will take us - her included. But regardless, we're responsible for making sure she knows what she needs to know, before she makes her decision."

Ramar nods, "We are in agreement then." He asks the old lady, "Is it alright if we wait around here, at least until she awakes? If you do no longer wish her on your hands, I mean, and do not mind the extra company. We can help out around the place, if need be..."

The crone shrugs. "You will not find enough room to live in here," she observes, correctly.

"We will stay nearby then, if this is alright with you?" Ramar looks a trifle concerned, but with a glance dismisses whatever was troubling him.

Time passes. Conversation is sparse, dotted with the delightful verbal banquet of insults from the crone. After dinner, stew is taken to Talu and Los-Main, who enjoy, while the Solars move the woman outside. A tent is made atop the hill, the safest place around that isn't inside the ship itself. Luna and Gaia rise in the sky, as the ship's crew turn in for the night, preparing for the next day's course.

Overnight, the young woman tosses and turns, moaning and whining in the throes of her fever-dream. Chi-Yosh renders what aid he can, and his two friends bring water from a nearby stream to bathe the forehead of the nascent Solar.

The morning arrives without the mystery woman's conciousness. She is taken aboard the ship, and placed in comfortable quarters as the pyramid rises into the sky, and takes to the clouds for a safe, concealed trip towards the City of Dreams. As Helios' climbs into the highest perch, in all his glory, the woman awakens with a start. Immediately the order is sent up, and down drops the ship to rest in a small ravine. Chi-Yosh sets a glass of water beside the woman's bunk, before stepping back towards the doorway, waiting patiently.

"Who... where am I?" the young Easterner asks, in a thick and weak voice. "Who are you?" She struggles to sit up, then collapses onto her back, and with a trembling hand reaches up to touch her own forehead.

Davron bows deeply. "I am Davron, and these are my Circle-mates, Chi-Yosh and Ramar," he says. "You are aboard our sky-ship for the present. You're free to go where you wish, but... there are things you may need to know first. Questions you may have... and which we can answer." With that, he allows the half-circle of Twilight to burn upon his brow.

"You? Then it was you that... brought me away from the mines?" the girl asks, hesitantly. "I remember arms.. a mark on the brow.. the uprising.. "

Chi-Yosh's own Caste mark burns on his brow, but for the moment he lets Davron speak, merely smiling to himself.

Ramar too, allows his Caste mark to burn. He studies the girl carefully, watching her for signs of comfort or panic, and smiles. He too will wait on Davron to finish before saying anything.

Davron shakes his head. "Not us... though I think perhaps we may have been sent by whoever did." He takes a seat upon a chair in a far corner or the room. "The mark upon your forehead is kin to our own, marking you as Chosen by Helios. The old lady with whom we'd found you, in your feverish state, said nothing of any mines - only that you'd had too much sun. Which is true, after a fashion," he says with a wry smile.

"It was... I was leading an uprising of the miners," the girl says, grasping at fleeting memory. "And, I caught on fire.. but it didn't burn me." She touches her brow again. "It came from here first, then all around me..But yes, I recognize.. you are like me." She sits up then, seemingly regaining something of her old self. "We have to go back! The miners! They need me.."

Davron looks to Chi-Yosh and Ramar. "We could do that... but it may be too late. We know not how long you've lain in fever - it's now the fourteenth day of Resplendent Earth, if that helps." He tilts his head. "I warn you only that your miners may no longer accept you, after what happened to you. That is what happened to me, after all," he adds, with a heartfelt sigh.

"Only two days," the young woman observes. "But... you think they will fear me if I return?" In her eyes the beginnings of tears are revealed.

"Please... please, if you are like me... I don't have the power. But you seem confident and sure of yourselves," whispers the new Exalt. "Take me with you. Teach me, so I can go back and finish what I started."

"Such confidence you will learn in time. And we would be honored to be your guides," says Davron. He rises, and offers his hand. "And if we can help the miners whose suffering you attempted to end, we will - for how can we calm those who fear us, if not by showing by example that we wish to help them."

"It may be that you have already done enough for them, and that you were meant to come away. We shall find out what is going on. And if you wish, we can teach and be your guides." Ramar bows his head, then asks, "What is your name?"

"I am .. Sun-and-Moon," the girl says quietly. "I never thought much my father's choice of name until now.. he was a seer, among the miners, but perhaps he foresaw this." And she reveals her Caste Mark at last, struggling to master the streams of Essence inside herself. The symbol she shows is a mirror of Ramar's own.

Chi-Yosh smiles upon Sun-and-Moon. The latter grabs his attention more than the former, for how shall Luna's touch come into this, if at all? "Our course has been set for a place that may be dangerous, or merely wondrous. You may join us if you wish it, or we can take you somewhere else."

"If you go, then I will too," states Sun-and-Moon, emphatically.

---

The search for the fabled city takes the better part of two days. Sun-and-Moon, and Chi-Yosh's two followers, study the three Solars carefully. Each, skilled in the occult and knowledgeable to some degree about the motions of heaven, earth, and the denizens of both, study both material and spiritual evidence. The geomancy of the general region is of principal interest, and Ramar sees to this while Chi-Yosh consults with the crafty elementals who infest the trackless region south of the Yanaze River. Davron stays busy sighting and computing, and at length, through time spent on the ground and in the air, a likely place is found - a valley, whose only land-ward passes are nearly obstructed with fallen rock. Thick forests and wild, forbidding growth could conceal almost anything.

The Solars find a likely place to land; a deep and murky pool of water with a spur of rock jutting into it seem almost the ideal site. Setting down, the six disembark and begin to survey their environs. Here and there, they can spot oddities. Flowers whose petals bear the wrong color. A human voice is heard, but its source is a songbird, spotted at last perched in a tree. The touch of the Wyld is faint, but unmistakeable.

Chi-Yosh draws the talisman around his neck, the blossom's petals gleaming as sunlight threads through the canopy above. He is uneasy; while half of his circle has entered the untamed Essence, and one can command it, there is still an unnaturality about the place that disturbs him. Not to mention the things that may lurk just beyond. Turning to Ramar, "You are at the lead, at least until we have cleared the Wyld zone."

Ramar nods slowly, "The thought occurs to me, Chi-Yosh, that the entire city could in fact be a Wyld zone. Although I do not believe we have entered it as of yet. Merely we are near a place that feels its effects... still I will prepare myself. Are you warded against the Wyld, Chi-Yosh? Or able to Ward yourself?"

Chi-Yosh shakes his head. "I have no protections. I thought you might carve us a safe path. Like some bubble around us." Since Ramar had erased Nexus's Wyld, it's a likely assumption.

Davron nods, closing his eyes briefly and drawing his own Essence about him, his Caste Mark glowing faintly as he focuses his will upon strengthening the Laws which bind his mind and body into one. "We should not linger, regardless. Even if we can protect ourselves, the Wyld surely bears prodigies which can do us harm."

Ramar and Davron both see the necessity of what must be done - the barrier of Wyld that will certainly be stronger near the heart of this strange place must be undone, and only Ramar can accomplish it. Davron himself is protected against the warping influence of the present chaos, but none else are. And so, daiklave and bow at the ready, the two daring Solars begin marching deeper into the forest. "They dare the Wyld?" asks Sun-and-Moon in awe, as she watches them go. "But why?"

Chi-Yosh watches the pair trudge forwards. "They dare the Wyld because they are trained for it. Though it is dangerous, it is they who can withstand, and complete the needed task. That's why they are what they are."

---

The forest grows progressively stranger. Trees bend this way and that, sprouting vines instead of branches, or reflecting the hues of a rainbow. The grass underfoot changes as well, sometimes curling into glyphs and written characters, other times singing sad ballads of long-lost warriors and broken trysts. The sky shimmers and merges; clouds mold themselves at great speed overhead, forming vaguely obscene and unsettling shapes before blowing away with equally unnatural swiftness. Rain falls at times, though the sun is still clearly shining, and once, a passing leaf cuts open a gash on Davron's cheek as though a sword's edge had touched him. Nearer to the heart of the forest, the pair find a strange door woven of interlocking tree-branches, complete with door-handle in the shape of a knotty outcropping. It turns easily, and they pass into a stranger space still.

Here, the trees are bent, and have replaced the ground, it seems - one walks upon the bark of horizontal trees, or crosses the limbs, while beneath, one can see not dirt or soil or stone, but leafy greenness - perhaps all the way down. And here, in the core of the Wyld, Ramar realizes that the power that twists Creation can be undone at last.

"Davron, I trust you will help me deal with any... trouble... that may come from this." And then Ramar falls silent. He flexes his arms, weaving them in a pattern to aid the mind in focusing. His will is bent on the world around him, and as he breathes, the trees and the bark begin to ripple and bend. The leafy greens beneath them rustle in an unseen wind, and a torrent of bladed leaves whips towards Ramar. With a glance, they fall across the Solars harmlessly, mere leaves that impact against the shifting ground. They turn into caterpillars, one of which flies away, the other dissolves in the brilliant sunlight that begins to pour out from Ramar's body. Light from his fingertips strikes the ground, and the Essence flares around him like a bonfire. He opens his eyes, and they are pools of molten white light, that streams upwards towards the canopy of twisting angry branches.

A chilled wind picks up as the Wyld is shaped according to Ramar's will. The wind becomes a torrent of firey dragons that breath crystals of lightning and ice. Their destructive breath becomes a rain of colorless serpents that melt upon the now recognizable ground. The world is slowly regaining its rightful shape now, and sheer unadulterated Chaos rages as it is burnt away by the power of Ramar's mind. For a moment, the Solar disappears within the beautiful light of his anima, and brilliant wings of light wrap around Ramar to shield him from the Wyld energies. They unfurl, revealing the golden halo of Ramar's Caste mark burning as brightly as a brand... Ramar's voice rings out within the Wyld, his cry loud and powerful... and then all passes... and the world is changed.

As his companion channels Essence to enforce Creation's law upon the unformed madness, Davron's brow furrows at a strange sound that begins to grow, the Copper Spider uncertain whether it is the flapping of wings, the rustling of leaves, or the sharpening of knives. As the sound grows louder, it is now accompanied by a sight revealing that it is all of the above - creatures in the shape of raitons, with wings alternately of razor-sharp steel and oak leaves, feet of gnarled wood tipped with copper talons, and bronze beaks glistening with sap. With an outraged cry like the grinding of gears, the flock swoops down upon the Solar who dares to sweep away their home.

But dreadful though they are, they are still vulnerable to arrows. As Davron proves in an exquisite display of the bowman's art, the arrowheads clanging as they pierce the fell prodigies' metal hides and sending them plummeting to the reshaped earth. A handful of birds peel away from the flock, attempting to circle around to attack from another angle - only to be caught in a passing wave of Ramar's magic, and transmuted into ordinary birds. Forgetting their Wyld-rage, the raitons flee in terror from the carnage of their former brethren.

The almost blinding light from Ramar's angelic anima fades, dimming, relatively, back into a filmy fluctuating corona of light that blazes brightly around him. He has succeeded. The Solar looks around, and in place of the twisting, chaotic, dangerous Wyld, Creation is restored. The ground is once more what it was, and remains so. The directions no longer shift, nor do the trees cry out for blood. In the distance, the animals cease their uneasiness, and a flight of birds leaving the trees no longer caws in terror as they pass over. Ramar stands at the center of the calm, and he looks to Davron, "Thank you," he manages, when once again he remembers to speak. "We did it..."

No explosion, great wind, or even the unsettling of birds heralds the changes in the Wyld, at least for those standing close to the ship. The only indication is silence, stillness. The flowers are still wrong, but they have grown that way. After a time, Chi-Yosh nods to himself, and turns to the two Su'Katan natives. They acknowledge the danger ahead, which may be more than a mortal can withstand. So they follow behind, weapons in hand as Chi-Yosh leads into the forest, Sun-and-Moon on his heels.

Davron grins wryly as his companions come into view. "Ho, Chi-Yosh, Sun-and-Moon! You missed all the fun," he jests, picking up one of the impaled metal-birds by the shaft of his arrow. His face turns slightly more serious as he sees the newly-minted Solar's expression. "Do not fear, Sun-and-Moon. You too will grow to face perils like these with confidence."

The girl bites her lip. "I have confidence in myself, but this world is new to me. The surface is very strange.."

Ramar nods, "And that's only the beginning." He has a tired look on his face; re-shaping Creation took a good deal from him. "Yet, we will all do what we can to help you understand it better... for all the good we can do that is... we still do not understand much of it."

Chi-Yosh reviews the bird with a wary chuckle. "Davron, next time I hope you will hunt that which we can eat. That looks a bit tough." While still facing forward, he offers back to Sun-and-Moon, "Confidence is good. Be aware of what you can do, and do not overestimate it. You will find as a Solar, you can do almost anything."

---

Deep in the forest, the Solars find white walls, though ruined - a fortress or city of some kind dwelled here at one time. And before the gates stand two guards. Their inhuman beauty, elegant poise, and flawless forms betray them at once. They are the Fair Folk, the guardians of the gnawing nameless appetites at the edge of the world, and the children of chaos.

"Greetings," calls Ramar as he walks towards the white walls of the fortress. He bows respectfully towards the fair folk guards, offering them an uneasy smile. He pauses for a moment, and his Caste Mark begins to glow upon his brow. A fluctuating aura of light outlines the circle as Ramar speaks to the Fair Folk. "Know I am an Eclipse, and that I mean you no harm."

The elegant guards begin to draw their weapons, but subside upon seeing the still-burning mark. "You are welcome here, emissary," says one, in a lilting voice whose beauty is that of an icy mountain stream in the white purity of winter. "But you may not pass these gates unless one of your number recites to us three dreams beyond belief, as is our custom."
