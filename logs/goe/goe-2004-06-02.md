A chilled wind rolls off of the river and across the ruins of an ancient and once proud temple... most of it lays in waste, ravaged by time and the onset of the Wyld march... yet few mortal hands have plundered wealth from it. Ramar stands in the center of a raised platform, staring into the depths of an old, unassuming set of stone doors. There is nervousness in the Solar's face as he prepares the spell, going over the rituals he'd been taught not long beforehand. He draws in a breath, and focuses his mind on the lines of power and the shape of the Essence flowing around him... and then, he begins to shape the Magic. Essence flows in vast quantities through the Solar, who struggles to bring it under control. There is a moment of tension as the stone begins to quake... and then a soft golden hue colors a select few runes engraved on the rocky surface. Ageless doors now swing open, and rather than opening to the river, they lead down a misty corridor lined with mystic sigils.

Ramar draws a breath and then steps forward, "Follow me." The gates swing shut, and the elaborate doors that lead into Yu-Shan now stand before the Solars. The Gold and Bronze Lions that wait by the doors tilt their heads towards the Circle. "Greetings," states the newly christened Sorcerer. "I bring with me guests, Chosen of the Sun. I must humbly ask for passage into Yu-Shan," he states, while his Caste Mark burns brightly atop his brow.

The way to Yu-Shan now opens before the Solars. The Lions have given their warning, and inclined their heads that the Circle might pass. There is no hiding the exultation in Ramar's eyes as his body adjusts to the raw Essence he shaped mere moments ago. He steps through, and the garment of Heaven is draped over his body. He turns to make sure his Circle-Mates have come, and then asks, "Where to now?"

Davron raises a hand. "Since we're looking for something specific... perhaps we have someone who can provide a reference." He focuses his mind upon the spirit ring, his eyes gazing into the immeasurable distances of Yu-Shan. After a few moments, he returns to the present, though he still seems distracted, undoubtedly by the voice of Yang in his head. "This way," he says, leading his fellow Solars down a great boulevard between ornately decorated buildings.

Down one street then another, Davron walks purposefully, occasionally pausing for more directions. At one point, he seems at a loss, when an intersection looks different from Yang's memories of long, long ago - Yu-Shan, after all, has not gone untouched by the tumult in Creation, and once-bustling offices are deserted, or even redecorated by new occupants. He retraces his steps for a block, then sets off on a new course, presumably a detour... which is borne out when his footsteps end at a side-street. Davron knocks firmly upon a door - ornately decorated, but nevertheless distinguished from its neighbors primarily by being free of dust.

The door opens. A small being, perhaps a yard in height, stands behind it, and bows politely. Its skin is scaly, and its eyes reflect the magic gold of the setting sun divided by ophidian slits. "Yessssssss?" the creature hisses, rising. "Your busssinesssssss?"

Davron bows to the creature. "We are three Chosen of the Sun, seeking an audience with the master of this place. We are in need of advice."

"I will ssssseeee if..." The diminuitive being is interrupted by the sound of a rock striking wood, and four pairs of eyes turn to the source. An hourglass has just turned, and a pebble - apparently once resting atop the timepiece - has fallen down. Etched on its flat surface is a single character: "Study". The creature pauses a moment, seemingly in recognition of this sort of thing, and beckons for the Solars to follow.

The study of the Heavenly house is well apportioned. Divans and chairs can be found, in quantity enough to become comfortable. There is a journal on one chair, a leather-bound book with a bookmark in it, and the creature picks this up and presents it to Davron.

With steady hands, the Solar opens the book to its appointed page, and reads aloud as he studies the words contained therein. "Greetings to you, my honored guests. Please be good enough to make yourselves comfortable while I consider your offer."

Perhaps half an hour's time is required before the small, sibilant creature announces the arrival of its master. "The Fisssher," it whispers, stepping aside. The man who enters after it is short, with fine features marking his birthplace as the Blessed Isle itself. The shape of his eyes and the fine black hair that lays in a long pigtail to his waist reveal the unmistakeable habits of noble breeding among the Realm's people. This man came from a patrician family, it is certain. "I have decided to accept your offer," he says, smiling. "Now, will you be so good as to tell me what it is?"

Chi-Yosh appraises the man as he steps inside. While the trips to the Blessed Isle were brief, they were not ignored by the Dawn. As the Sidereal enters, he rises and offers the proper greeting of a bow. After straightening, "At one time, the five of our Circle were under the tutelage of a Sidereal, and that time has passed. We now control a growing portion of the Hundred kingdoms, with nearly a hundred Exalt loyalists or allies. We seek an advisor to assist in the pursuits of our Circle and our Nation."

"I see," says the Fisher, and asks another question. "How did you come to select me? I am curious."

Davron seems about to speak, but pauses, as if listening to a voice. He raises an eyebrow, but simply nods, removing the spirit ring from his finger and offering it to the Fisher. "Our reference," he explains.

The Sidereal reaches for the ring and slips it onto his finger. A mixture of emotions peek out from his face, each hinting themselves in turn: shock, anger, horror, and an increasingly visible awareness that something is amiss. Without a word he slips the ring off, in time, and passes it back, his composure completely restored. "Ah," he says.

"So now, you might guess what you've gotten yourself into." Ramar chuckles, almost ruefully, "Though I am pleased to make your acquaintance. You are called the Fisher, yes?" He studies the man intently, trying to read what else might lay behind that freshly restored composure. _After all... it never hurts to know ones acquaintances either._

"Thank you," the man says, and bows again, returning the ring to Davron. "I now understand why I accepted your offer."

Through all this, Gallius remains quiet, studying this Sidereal and his domain as calmly as she surveys her troops. The internal struggle is well hidden, of course. She has known the Master and liked and respected him. She has not known this man, and has more than a slight impulse to not trust any Sidereal easily.

"Our first order of business is the country of Defiler's Grave," says Chi-Yosh. "They are a state south of our Nation of the Sun, known for the mountain grave of a great evil. There's a fierce defense of the grave itself, a portion of their military heavily drilled for that purpose. Inside the grave is a First Age Solar's tomb with a Warstrider and other wonders. We need to get them out, without starting a war. How would you approach this?"

In response, the Sidereal reaches left, toward a shelf of books. Without looking his fingers come to rest on a particular volume, and without hesitating he withdraws the book and opens it. It falls open of its own accord, and he studies the text carefully. "I see," he says after several seconds of consultation. "I would first lift the astrological limits placed on the nation, then employ diplomacy," he replies, as he returns the book to its resting place.

"Can you life those limits for us, Fisher, since you have accepted our offer?" asks Gallius calmly. Her eyes drift down to the book for a moment, then back to study the Sidereal. "Defiler's Grave is of great importance. Far more than its people would ever guess."

"I personally cannot," the Sidereal smiles, shaking his head. "But I can facilitate the process. Come with me, please."

Gallius rises smoothly and waits for the Sidereal to lead the way. It seems that things will go even better than she anticipated.

---

The offices of the Most Excellent Designers of Destiny and Sidereal Conjunctions are, as always, impressive. The Fisher presents himself at the doors, passing in without interruption and leading his four guests. Through the maze of the Bureau's interlocking offices, spaces, and chambers he moves, with a calmly assured stride.

An enormous warehouse of tightly-rolled and bound scrolls, set onto racks, is where this journey ends. Upon demonstrating his identity, the Sidereal lovingly unwinds one particular scroll, and studies its contents. "I shall make an appointment with the Gate," he announces. "She will remove the binding for you within a day." And so saying, the records are sealed shut. "I will see to it now. Please expect me at home," he suggests.

As the circle makes its way towards the home of Fisher, they may have a sensation of being watched. Occasionally footsteps can be heard, but if one looks back, little will be seen. Only after they are nearly back does the sound of someone coming closer grow quite obvious, footsteps very easily heard, though the source is not until Rumika rounds a corner and stops suddenly.

Davron freezes in his tracks, several expressions crossing his face - surprise, embarrassment, delight - leaving him speechless and gaping for several seconds. "Rumika..." he pauses, then laughs, striding forward with arms outstretched. "You always have had a way of turning up when least expected!"

Rumika laughs softly and strides out to meet Davron in a warm embrace. "Well, this was not quite what I thought would happen," she says calmly. "I didn't know you were rubbing elbows in Yu-Shan so often. It seems that I was supposed to run into you, though."

Davron chuckles, hugging Rumika warmly. "Well, we _are_ here to seek advice from a Sidereal. These things have a way of happening when they're involved." He blushes slightly as he regards Rumika. "We got your message..." he says hesitantly. "I'm sorry we've had to meet like this, rather than coming to visit you in person."

"It is all right," answers Rumika. She tilts her head to look past Davron at his friends and waves, "Hello guys! Miss me?" Her laughter rings like bells here in Yu-Shan. "You know, Davron, there are very important things we need to see to. Hmm, it's odd.. I even brought the book with me. I think if you use it wisely you can find the answer to the greatest of questions."

Chi-Yosh wiggles his fingers at Rumika with a tossed smile. "It's been less energetic with your leaving. Let us see if the book changes all of that?"

Davron nods slowly. "May I see?" he asks quietly. As far as he's concerned, the business in Yu-Shan has suddenly become less pressing.

Rumika reaches into a bag at her side and draws out the book, offering it to Davron. "I have what I can get from it. This chasing the past is not for me, you know. I just want to be on my island and be content there. I have my own tasks.. and I hear you have started a new nation."

Davron nods, accepting the book. "Together, we've done things I'd not have imagined possible. There's so much to do, yet..." He sighs, looking into Rumika's eyes. "I wish I could be content on one island. Perhaps some day I can be. But..." He shakes his head. "After what Gallius has shown me, I can't turn my back on the Nation."

"I wouldn't want you to," answers Rumika quietly. "I can be patient. You really should visit, though. I'm making progress with my work. The book proved more useful than I had dared to imagine. Maybe when your nation is ready, it can spare you for a few weeks and I can show you things you haven't even dreamed of." She smiles widely and steps back to look over Davron, "It's just so good to see you!"

Davron's eyes twinkle as he returns Rumika's gaze, sighing to himself. "You look as good as ever, Rumika..." He chuckles and shakes his head. "The Nation will not be 'ready' for some time to come, yet. I don't think I can wait that long. There are a few things I _must_ attend to, but soon... Gallius will just have to do without me for a little while."

Gallius, for her part, is grinning very widely at this entire exchange. "I'm sure a little vacation time can be arranged," she says, trying not to say just what she expects that time to be used for.

Rumika nods to Davron. "There are many things to do, but there will be time," she says. She tilts her head down, trying to hide a bit of a blush. "In any case, I hope your visit to Yu-Shan has been.. beneficial." She actually sounds off-balance for once.

Davron nods, his own blush far too big to hide from Rumika, as he smiles at her. "It's... been more fruitful than I'd ever have guessed..." he says, softly and hesitantly, reaching out to take Rumika's hand. He opens and closes his mouth a few times, but no sound comes out...

Rumika sighs softly and smiles at Davron for a while, just kinda standing there with dreamy eyes. Her lost focus is restored when a small, winged toad lands on her shoulder and croaks loudly. "You are late for your meeting with rrroak! with the benevolent, marvelous, all-knowing Desceletani, Most Efficacious Architect of Oceanic Streams" Rumika turns to frown at the toad and flicks it off her shoulder with a snort. The thing reels about and darts off, flying as if it were drunk. "Well, time's up," she says softly. With a mischievous smile she darts forward, brushes Davron's lips with a kiss, and then departs just as abruptly as she appeared.

Chi-Yosh waits for a heartbeat or two as Davron stands awestruck, before walking to the Twilight. Sinking a finger into his collar, an urging tug is given, pulling Davron along. "If you stand here any longer you might start to collect moss."

"Someday she'll have to tell me just how she does that," murmurs Gallius. She can't stop grinning. "I suppose we really should go wait at Fisher's home now? Unless you want to follow her, Davron."

Davron startles quite magnificently. "Wha?" he says, looking in the direction Rumika departed. "Y-yes, well, well, um, we'd best be on our way," he mutters in as businesslike a manner as he can. Though no matter how calm he can manage to sound, the vivid crimson dyeing his cheeks gives him away. He most certainly will be taking advantage of that offer for vacation time.

---

The Fisher arrives precisely on time - though what time was the correct moment to expect him, only he himself knows. "I must tell you three things at this point," he says without preamble, after inclining his head politely in greeting. "First, that I am an adherent to the Bronze Faction. This has been my ideological choice, and I wish you to respect it. Second, the curse that hovered over Defiler's Grave has been revoked. Third, that it would be in the best interests of your Nation and the region to continue to preserve the sanctity and peace around the tomb for as long as possible. I am told that removing grave-goods from it is permissible, but entry into the burial chamber must not be allowed under any circumstances."

"I realize that my beliefs may trouble you," continues the Sidereal with a calm half-smile. "I believe that the world is a more stable place without the Solar Exalted. However, as destiny has seen fit to return you en masse, my beliefs may be in error. If you believe that I will betray you as an advisor, I give you my assurance that it is impossible. We are rational people. We can see past differences of opinion, if we let ourselves."

Davron bows in return. "Well spoken. It is for all of us to do our duty as we see fit... and if you _are_ in error, it is our responsibility to prove it to you. However long that may take."

The Sidereal shakes his head. "You cannot prove or disprove an opinion," he observes with his half-smile. "But my opinion will not impact whatever matters I advise you on."

Chi-Yosh smiles to Fisher, though the expression is partly wary. While this might hold the potential for disaster, he has to respect the Sidereal for being honest, and open to not only his destiny but his duty, and his opinion. "You cannot prove or disprove an opinion. You can simply put the evidence before it, and hope that it is enough to change that opinion."

---

Once returned to the Nation, Gallius sends men south, trying to once more open negotiations with Defiler's Grave to enter the nation of the Sun. Once the door to meetings is opened, she and Marina begin working the same magic they have worked so many times before, turning minds and wills to new tasks is the goal. Concessions are offered. That which is taken from the tomb is to be counted against the taxes of the citizens, freeing them from taxes for a full ten years, as the offer reads.

The people of Defiler's Grave seem no different in demeanor; they permit the diplomatic overtures, asking for the usual spate of concessions, and agreeing in time. Their principal negotiator insists only that military activity be kept as far away from the tomb as humanly possible; the Fisher concurs, privately. The man apologizes for a certain gruffness of tone in earlier dealings, and suggests that compensation for the removal of the tomb's riches is appreciated, but also that the public removal of them will act to discourage would-be graverobbers and thus reduce the burden of security on the mountain's guards. All seems well.

A chain of wagons heads southward for Defiler's Grave, an anxious Davron at the head - he's heard the tales from his companions. But even these do not adequately express what he sees upon his arrival - the ancient but still functional elevator systems, the forge and its tools, and of course the magnificence of the great warstrider itself. But there is no time to stare in awe; the dire warnings about the wonders' former owner are not lost on him, and he wishes to linger in this place no longer than he must. He works tirelessly, but with great care and reverence - making use of Gallius' laborers where he must, but reserving the actual dismantling of the workshop and warstrider for himself.

The laden wagons creak with their orichalcum burdens as they arrive at their destination, Davron impatiently riding herd upon the treasure trove for the entire northbound journey - even though the Nation's borders are secure for the moment, the sorcerer-craftsman takes no chances. The first wagon has not even come to a stop at the warehouse door before Davron is unshipping the restraints upon its precious cargo and preparing to bring it inside.

And now the real work begins. Gallius has impressed upon him the urgency of this task - not that it matters; almost nothing in the world could tear him away from a chance to restore this mighty machine. Candles burn by the dozens as Davron peruses the library brought along from Defiler's Grave, seeking to understand the occult forces that channel the power of a Hearthstone through the mighty limbs. Where the library is inadequate, his own intuition must suffice.

Day and night Davron's hammer rings out, as he shapes the replacement parts, his anima burning as brightly as the forge-fires - for every piece is more than just a hunk of orichalcum and steel. The link-pins on the left knee joint, for example, must _know_ that their purpose is to hold the upper and lower legs together, allow one to turn freely upon the other according to the dictates of the left leg bound in the pilot's harness high above, and - if the pilot channels Essence in a Charm - must resonate with his anima to give the knee-joint the same supernatural speed and strength his leg would have, on a much larger scale.

After what seems like an age, the work is done. The giant armor stands erect, gleaming golden in the forge-light, looking like the perfect replica of a mighty warrior. But appearance is the least part of the whole, and, tingling with nervous excitement, Davron ascends the scaffolding to the pilot's seat, borrowed Hearthstone in hand, to run the armor through its paces. Socketing the enchanted gem into its home, Davron channels his Essence into the great form even as he secures the many oiled leather straps about his limbs. The process is complete... and now the acid test. Davron takes a deep breath to steady himself, and raises an arm...

To Davron's immense relief, the metal arm whispers almost soundlessly as it mimics Davron's movements precisely. With growing exultation, Davron tests the other arm, then each legs, the grip of the gauntlets, and finally, picturing an attack in his mind, uses his magic to dodge it - everything is in perfect order. Grinning from ear-to-ear, he unstraps himself once more, and to the guard looking in and watching in wonder he gives a gleeful thumbs-up. The soldier salutes, and exits to deliver the message to Gallius: Success.

Gallius looks up from a myriad of reports to receive the news of Davron's success. She nods thoughtfully, sending back words of enthusiasm before she goes to meet the representatives from Lookshy who arrived but a few minutes prior. Time. She will never have enough of it. Tomorrow what was just finished will be shown to the people of Lookshy. After that, her plan truly begins.
