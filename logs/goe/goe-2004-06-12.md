# Gods of Eden 2004-06-12

The way to Yu-Shan opens once more. A solitary figure clad in simple garments goes almost unseen, save for the rush of Essence that leaves a mist-hewn tunnel behind a previously utterly mundane stone gate. Ramar steps inside, and passes the Celestial Lions, shedding his simple clothing for the garb of Heaven. _And now... to find the architect of Yu-Shan's gates..._

The Solar walks the streets of Yu-Shan for a while, collecting his thoughts and his goals. It's utterly necessary to have these things planned out, lest he be given the runaround once more. Soon, Ramar is speeding across Yu-Shan in an aerial rickshaw. "Thank you," he says as he steps from the craft and prepares the last of his thoughts. _The Bureau of Destiny awaits._ The doors of the Golden Barque open for him, and again Ramar enters. _Perhaps this time, things shall be different._

The august presence of Heaven's most important, most invisible Bureau is entirely self-contained; everything about the Bureau of Destiny is crafted to give the impression that nothing out of the ordinary ever happens, and yet it is the political mandate of its directors that the Bureau be considered pre-eminent among its fellows in Heaven's organization. The spirit who attends to visitors is an excitable and agitated-looking female, with long green locks and tufts of green fur covering her entire body. Her deep blue eyes focus on the new arrival and she rises, bowing cordially. Other spirits and delegates nearby provide similar gestures of obesiance, groveling as they are obligated to by Heaven's law.

"Greetings," speaks Ramar, bowing in turn to the green furred attendant. "I have come to gain an audience with a particular individual... I understand that the process should begin here... erm, with whom should I speak?"

"What is your business, please, Exalted one?" asks the obsequious creature, eyes glancing about before fixating on Ramar.

"I've come to speak with the one who designed and built Yu-Shan's gateways, in hopes of learning more about them and their workings," replies Ramar, who also spares a glance to see who might be listening.

"I will pass your request to the proper parties," the spirit replies, unctuously, pressing a hand on a softly glowing crystal. It grows warmer and more visible for several seconds, then the attendant rises, gesturing to a door behind her, set into the wall. "Follow the corridor to the Embarkation Point," she instructs, bowing low.

Ramar raises his hand in a gesture of thanks, "You have my thanks." With that, he turns and walks through the door and into the corridor beyond.

The corridor is long and winding, and terminates in a long staircase whose endpoint cannot be seen. Nevertheless it is the only place to go, and Ramar begins descending, making his way down the nearly endless procession of stairs. At last he reaches another door, a high barrier of iron marked clearly in glowing crystalline runes: EMBARKATION SITE FOR THE GOLDEN BARQUE OF THE HEAVENS. And in pushing it open, he feels an enormous gust of wind. Beyond, there is nothing but cloud - Ramar is well above the clouds of the sky! He steps out onto a platform, looking up and seeing nothing at all except sky. Behind him, the door lies open. And in front of him, something breaks through the clouds below, rising swiftly.

The Golden Barque itself is a vast skyship, hewn from gold and other precious metals and stones. Its lines are sleek and streamlined; its control services and verniers are without question of precision grade. The great monolithic craft swims like a graceful whale through the sky, pressing its port side against the embarkation point with nary a shudder or disturbance. And on its side, a golden hatch unseals with a hiss and opens. "Come aboard, please," calls a voice, and within, a minor attendant-spirit can be seen, bowing.

_Even the sea of clouds has its very own whale..._ Ramar bows his head humbly as the majestic craft swims through the sky and against the Embarkation Point. "This is... a marvel..." says Ramar, in hushed and reverant tones. He steps inside, passing through the golden hatch, and to the attendant-spirit, "Thank you. Where next?"

"The Golden Barque sails where it must," the spirit whispers. It is no more than a vaporous apparition, and it flickers and changes shape into new and indistinct forms as it leads the way into the corridors of the great vessel. Arriving before a door, the spirit's tenuous hand reaches out, grasping at a bell-pull beside the door and ringing the bell. "Come in," calls a voice, and the door swings open of its own accord. "You are expected, sir," the cloudy being whispers, before taking its leave.

"I see." Ramar watches as the spirit takes its leave. He steps through the open portal, and bows respectfully to the occupant of this new room. "Hello there, I'm Ramar... I believe though, that you probably already know this, as well as why I am here..."

The man inside looks like an ordinary human being, but for two things. The first is that his entire left arm, from shoulder to hand, seems composed entirely of animated glass. It sparkles as the hand turns the pages of a book resting on the table at which the man sits. The second is the blue aura that burns in his eyes - they glow of their own accord, erasing any visible detail of the eyes themselves. He turns his head, examining the new arrival to his sumptuous cabin with those eyes, and gestures with that glass hand. "I do not - I was told to expect a distinguished visitor. You are Exalted, Chosen of the Sun, yes?"

Ramar's Caste mark glitters upon his brow. "Yes, I am." The man's glass arm has not gone unnoticed, and though many questions may be flooding Ramar's mind he manages to quell most of them. "And then you are the architect who designed the gateways, yes? Is there another title you would prefer to go by?" _I wonder, did he build his arm himself?_ "In any case, I have come in hopes that I might speak with you about the gateways that lead into Yu-Shan, if you do not mind talking about them."

"Have a seat." As the transparent arm gestures, an empty chair slides across the floor of its own volition, stopping near Ramar. "I don't mind talking about them." The man folds his book up and sets it aside on the table, sitting back and steepling his fingers together. "Call me En," he suggests.

"Pleased to meet you En." Ramar sits down in the chair, after giving it the sort of look that one gives a dog when it first begins to speak, and instead of saying 'arf' it has instead said 'pardon me, but I'd like a cup of tea'. "Have you er... built all of these..." Ramar gestures at the chair. There's a curious expression within his eyes as he continues to speak. He takes some time to explain his project, and what exactly he hopes to accomplish, and then, "So I was hoping to perhaps gain an understanding of the gates, and how they work, and their history and the like from you, that I might put the knowledge to use myself."

"The gates make use of a property of Essence that we called 'sympathy' - in other words, like seeks like, and like attracts like. This is something any occultist will know." En settles back, smiling, giving the impression of a willing schoolmaster imparting knowledge to a student. "What we also found is that there are layers of Essence, each one concealing the other, and that one layer - pe ka ma ri, although that probably means nothing to you - that one layer dealt with closeness and distance. The gates simply connect two points together by charging the pe-layer with a flood of primed Essence. The energy reserve you put in must be tuned to some other, identical, reserve, which will be the gate on the other side. You must also avoid disturbing the intervening layers, but we created a mapping diagram to help with that."

Ramar listens intently, giving the impression of the willing student receiving knowledge from his teacher. "I see... different layers of Essence, charged with primed Essence to form the pathway. You are right though... pe ka ma ri means nothing to me... yet. How can I learn enough for it to mean something? What happens if you disturb the intervening layers of Essence?" _At least there is a diagram... I'm fairly certain I wouldn't want to try working something like this blindly._ "What other properties does Essence have?"

"What other properties? You should know that already, or you're wasting your time with me," snorts En. "Now, if you disturb the other layers, you lose sight of the pe-layer, and you end up channelling Essence all over the place. In other words, something probably blows up."

"Well it pays to ask every now and then... I think I have a grasp of them though. Not as great as some, but enough to follow along. So the pe-layer is the main one to worry about. What about this diagram you've mapped out?" Ramar tilts his head curiously, "Does it help to keep things from blowing up? Things blowing up would likely as not be a bad thing at this point."

"I might be able to dig it up," remarks En, and his glowing eyes narrow. "Just what are you hoping to use this for?"

"Well as I said... I was hoping to create something like this myself." Ramar once more explains the task ahead of him, "I believe this might work as a way to help move people safely back and forth. Do you think that passing through the Wyld will have any effect on this?"

"Not if where you're going is also stable," replies En, after a few moments of consideration. "But you will want to build your gate almost at the center of the stabilized zone."

Ramar nods slowly, "Alright. I'll make sure that it stays in a stable place. Does it matter what the gates are constructed from? Are there any special considerations that should be made for non-Exalts or Spirits travelling through it?"

"Of course it matters," growls En, and the change in tone suggests a teacher reproving a student who hasn't paid attention to their work. "But aside from that, you can move anything - mortals, spirits, Fair Folk, Exalted, or anything else. The gates make two places coterminous - they are, for the duration the gates are open, effectively the same place."

Ramar says, "Ahh... more sympathy at work. It makes sense. Though I believe asking about the gate material mattering was the wrong question to ask," replies Ramar after hearing the tone shift from imparting to reproachful, "I meant to ask, what should the gates be constructed from?"

"You'd know once I showed you the Essence flow diagrams," observes En, speaking carefully. "I thought you were an artificer though..." He holds up a hand, and obediently a book from his bookshelf in one corner flies into his grasp. He lays it out on the table, then opens it, and begins speaking in low tones to the book itself. And on the blank pages, words and pictures begin to form. "Copy whatever you need from here," he recommends. "But file a notification of work with the Bureau of Destiny before you begin."

Ramar shakes his head, "No. I'm not an artificer. At least not yet. I'm learning though. Perhaps not as fast as I could... but I am learning." He watches in awe as a previously empty book becomes filled with knowledge. "Very well. I shall do that."

It takes some time for Ramar to sort out exactly what is and isn't needed. Even longer still to copy the charts and data needed. Any information he can glean from the book that is new to him, he will learn, or ask En about if something is not quite clear... _I may return here someday, and when I return, I wish to be the well-studied student._ After he has finished, Ramar and En will part ways, and the Solar is once more in the company of a spirit-attendant. The Golden Barque's journey carries them near a point where he can travel back to the Bureau of Destiny. From there it's easy enough to get back home, with new knowledge in hand. _And now for the actual doing of this thing..._
