Chi-Yosh does not trust Olo. The Fae are crafty, cunning, and only trustable when their word is given. Were he to stay down in the cavern, there is slim chance he could get out. While Olo does not wish to guide him, the Fair Folk can be forced to, by being followed. The Solar runs towards the steps, essence boiling under foot, aiding muscles tension like the coiliing of a spring, before he bursts upwards, coming to a solid halt behind Olo. Close enough to see the intricate weave of the warrior's armor, Chi-Yosh paces step for step right behind the fae, for now.

A sudden realization sweeps over Chi-Yosh as he perceives the flows and currents of Essence around him. His own presence has been under the effect of some sort of glamour - a Fair Folk trick to make he, himself, invisible! But from what? Olo can clearly see him. The others could speak with him earlier, and recognized him. And now, as he feels the first tendrils of hate from the tree behind him, seemingly gnawing at his soul, he comprehends in a flash just what entity the fae intended to hide him from. For how long the ruse was to be maintained is now answered, it seems.

Olo dashes off, a toothsome grin giving his face an ever more feral cast than usual. He seems like a warrior, yes, but also a child at play, amused by the challenge and haughtily superior of his own abilities.

Chi-Yosh charges up the stairs after Olo. The heavy man almost seems to dance through the air at a pace too fast to follow. But Exalted eyes stay on him, for he is the beacon to lead from this house of mirages. The Solar's foot catches on the top step, sending him pitching forward. Instead he kicks off the step mid-fall and curls, hands planted to throw himself forward to land running. It cost him several seconds, but how much more could have been lost? Speed is of the Essence, but in the wake of his leap, the Exalt's Essence must be patient. Even if here, time is the current he swims against.

Through the avenues and galleries Olo races, with Chi-Yosh barely able to keep up. The laughing warrior is tireless, running with the ease of the wind itself, his lithe body able to ignore the twists and turns of the crazy maze that is the Cathedral in ways that no mortal frame could manage.

Those precious seconds lost only add to the flight of Olo, who's passage sends the scenery into ripples that drag after him before snapping back. Through the glamour Chi-Yosh races, and now Essence blows to tear him closer. A glance up offers him a better lane to travel; at the next bend, the Solar doesn't turn but instead charges at the wall, before gracing two steps upon it. There he kicks up, sailing onto the ledge of a balcony to race, before jumping to a ledge carved for flickering statues. Approaching the next curve fast, Chi-Yosh leaps from the perch's end to bounce off of a wall to touch down and scramble behind Olo, nearly landing upon a piece of moving crystal art.

Olo looks back, frowning a moment and losing his look of glee. His early lead is fading, though slowly; he takes a surprise turn left, leaping bodily through a tapestry that seems no more solid than air.

Chi-Yosh can't stop moving; that's the key. While he doesn't trust the scenery at all, he can only let Olo be the guide, and thus through the draping cloth he goes. Falling into a lane that curves around a garden of pillars, Chi-Yosh cuts through the scenery as Olo takes the path. Between the pillars are spiderwebs of gauze that sparkle like light-trapping diamonds. Beyond the path, things - shadows, transparencies and memories made visible - flirt around to some unnotable plot, words, arms and eyes following the Solar's flight. They whisper like pleading ghosts, trying to derail him, draw him into their games of dance and play, or get in his way. Chi-Yosh keeps on running, dispursing some of them in a cloud of dreamspun fringe, to burst out onto the path behind Olo.

Through gates of gossamer and phantoms spun of children's nightmares, Olo races, and Chi-Yosh paces him. The warrior looks less confident; his bold mein of earlier is being replaced with the grim face of determination to win, and the cocky attitude that informed his fang-laden sneer is giving way to a simple realization: the illusion of his strength is being eroded by the truth of the Exalted nature.

Even as reason and reality are tearing away at the glamour game, the Cathedral itself will have none of it, sheltering the Fae in his flight. The hall next is one of crystal and frozen moonlight, a plane of reflection akin to some forest of mirrors. The racing pair are everywhere, and for a moment Chi-Yosh is dazed, nearly ramming into a wall at a sharp turn. Relying not on the whole view, Olo's legs are watched, for each turn is telegraphed through the body; he turns left, there will be a turn ahead, one the mimicing walls and hanging glitter can meagerly hide.

Olo dives through another hanging tapestry on the wall, in a rare moment of superior position - he's seconds ahead of the Solar. Chi-Yosh follows, throwing himself through the glamoured wall. What he finds to his shock and pain is that the tapestry is (or has become) very real indeed. And as he hears the sound of distant laughter tinkling like chimes in the wind, he realizes that he is lost...

---

In the Cathedral's heart, the two remaining fae spend their time smiling at each other and their guests, whispering from time to time, and occasionally Aris will giggle or Elef will manage a knowing smile. The pair seem cordial and in high spirits. At length Elef speaks. "Perhaps your friend and Olo are engrossed in studying the tree," he remarks to Sun-and-Moon, Ramar and Davron together. "Would you like to go check on their progress? It will be safe if you do not enter the chamber itself, I think."

"Well yes, I would like to check on their progress... if I'm not... interrupting anything that is." Ramar shifts his weight from foot to foot as though he can't quite get comfortable standing in the presence of two smiling Fae. "Where should I head?"

It is at that moment that Olo returns to the chamber, the doughty warrior's face composed into a look of concern. "I come to tell you that your friend has disappeared from the chamber. I have just come from there, and I can say that he is not present anywhere inside. You must come."

"What? He's..." Ramar's brows furrow and the corners of his mouth tug downwards with concern for his friend. "What happened then? Will you please try and explain as we go wherever it is we must go?" The Solar slips into movement easily enough, ready to dash off in whatever manner is needed.

"I will lead the way," offers the warrior, and the Solars follow. At length the twisting journey is made. Olo ventures down the steps to the underground chamber, then turns and gestures. "He is still absent. I fear that he may have angered the tree, for I do not think he would be so foolish as to wander the Cathedral alone."

Ramar raises an eyebrow, "And what could the tree do to him, if he has angered it? I do not understand quite how he could have done such a thing..." Ramar's voice has a hint of doubt and a pinch of worry in it as he queries the warrior, "Where would he be if the tree has caught hold of him?"

In answer, Olo gestures to a lake, at the center of which is an island. And on the island is the orichalcum tree itself, with its jade leaves blowing where no wind blows. And in that lake is the color and consistency of blood. "There is only one place for any whose fate the tree decides," intones Olo solemnly.

"Very well then." Ramar turns to Olo, "How do I find him?"

Davron looks about the grotto, his brow furrowing and his lip trembling. "And... what becomes of the victims' flesh, Olo? And the equipment they carry? Is that too drowned in the lake?"

"That I do not know," replies the warrior, shaking his head. "I have never witnessed the tree's method of execution personally."

"Then he's dead." Ramar sinks to his knees. "He is... no... I won't believe it. I won't." Funny thing that. The way his voice sort of breaks. "You did this to him. Led him to his death."

"Any mortal who sets foot alone here is warned of the dangers," replies Olo sternly.

Ramar says, "And he is NO mortal."

Ramar's eyes narrow into as stern a look as Olo's. He fights the tears back as best as he can. "You were with him were you not?"

Olo shakes his head. "He is destined to die. He is mortal by our judgement. And yes, I was with him for a time, here. But you were all warned, above, of the dangers this place posed. Yet you went anyway, willingly. Do not think to lay the blame for his death on us."

Davron firms his jaw and visibly steadies himself. "If there is anything of him to find, we must find it." He turns to Olo. "Your compatriot said that one may approach the tree safely. I will risk it. The rest should remain here, and watch." He shakes his head. "We should never have let him go down alone."

Ramar considers this, carefully. He is silent for several moments. "You are..." a heavy sigh escapes from within the Solar. "You are right." He turns to Davron, "No. You're not going. Not alone."

Sun-and-Moon hesitates, her face a mask of uncertainty and fear. At length, she too speaks up. "I will go as well," she offers.

Davron opens his mouth to protest... but as both of his companions interject, he is silenced. "...Very well, then. But we must take care. If Chi-Yosh could anger the tree alone, what would three of us do?" He hesitates, and turns to Olo, as a new thought enters his mind. "If you were with him for a time, why did you not see the manner of his death?"

Ramar shakes his head, "No. I think it's best if we go ourselves. It wouldn't do to put yourself in danger. We can go."

"I was with him before he approached the tree," explains Olo, carefully. "I spoke to him about it, answering what questions he had as best I could."

"What questions did he have?" Ramar asks this of Olo, and as he asks, he allows the flows of Essence to bring to him whispers of the subtle and varied motives of the Fae. He is especially curious of Sun-and-Moon... the way her face is a mask of the very emotions that he feels for his friend.

Each Solar feels, at that moment, a waving or flowing sensation. The unmistakeable touch of dream washes through three hearts, and Davron is the first to identify it: a spell or working of concealment has fallen away from the trio. Olo smiles grimly. "It seems that you will indeed be in danger if you approach the tree," he says.

"Perhaps. It is a danger I will face." Ramar narrows his eyes as he turns to face Olo, "Why do you wish to be away from us? Why did you wish to leave our friend alone, hmmm? Why do you not answer the questions we pose to you, and instead make comments that are at best vaguely related to the topic at hand... perhaps even threats."

"One does not make threats to guests," replies the warrior. "I tell you that you will be in danger. It is not a danger of my making."

"And you still evade the questions..." Ramar shakes his head, "Are you going to be useful at all, or are you only going to tell us of the danger we are now in... why do you not answer?"

"One also does not take an aggressive tone with one's host," replies Olo, eyes flashing. "I have told you what I will, and now I will return to my companions. You may come with me if you wish." And so saying, he turns, beginning his ascent of the staircase and moving toward the halls of the Cathedral, above.

"Then it appears we shall have to uproot an old tree... perhaps there is something of Chi-Yosh within." Ramar watches as Olo ascends the staircase, "You still do not answer. Why are you afraid to do so?"

Olo continues to ascend, though his hands tighten into fists. "I do as I wish. I do not fear to answer, and accusing me blindly will do nothing but sully your own honor."

"I do not accuse you blindly. Do not try to hide the fact that you wish to leave us... you've wished to do so since we have come down here... is this what you did with Chi-Yosh as well? Left him to anger the tree?" Ramar draws a deep breath, then turns to Davron, "I do not believe they shall help us. We will likely have to enter the chamber..."

Davron has been silent, his grief knotting into anger at what he finally suspects to be a betrayal. Finally, he speaks. "He will not answer, Ramar. Nor will he allow us to see the tree unmolested. We can either leave Chi-Yosh behind and hope to save ourselves, or take our chances below."

Mounting the top of the stairs and entering the chamber, Olo is stopped; something flits into his field of vision, and reflexes catch it. A ball of tapestry, now only a shadow of what the glamour had made it to be. A voice low enough for him to pick up returns, "We'll see how good you are without hiding behind artwork, next time we race."

The trio linger by the entrance into the tree's grotto, the threat, suspicion and potential fear lingering in the air like a stench. Even as they turn to regard the passage, a command shouts down, "Halt!" Standing atop the steps is a disheaveled Chi-Yosh, his clothing torn and ruffled, looking almost wild-eyed. Down the stairs he goes, two at a time. "The tree itself is filled with the hate of the tortured souls."

"Chi-Yosh!" Davron's exclaim of delight at seeing his friend safe, if a little less than sound, is quickly tempered by the Su-Katan's words. "Then what can we do? I don't suspect there's any point further in following Olo back - I somehow doubt he'll allow us to..."

"Chi-Yosh! You're alive!" Ramar shouts with as much joy as relief... although after a moment this passes, and his emotions and nerves are calmed, lest the fae get what they want. "No, I rather imagine not. Olo lied to us, misled us." the Solar considers the tree ahead of them, "We shall perhaps free the souls from their torment, or the tree from the hate... it may help us to escape."

Sun-and-Moon, for her part, has stepped down off the stairs and is slowly crossing the cavern. She has a dazed look on her face. "I've never seen anything so lovely," the girl whispers.

"Following him back is what nearly cost me my sanity," He says with only a hint of mirth among the weight of his words. "He tried to get me to fight him, to ensure I was not tainted." A nod to Ramar. "Precisely." Drawing down to the cavern floor, he approaches the trio and gives a quick summary of what he's discovered.

Davron listens to Chi-Yosh's words, turning to Sun-and-Moon and wondering what she thinks of this... and does a double-take when she's not there. Aghast, he looks down into the cavern and sees her walking forward. "Sun-and-Moon!" he calls out in dismay, taking a step forward... then pausing. "What is she doing? What would the tree do to her?" he asks Chi-Yosh urgently.

The girl draws closer, wading out through the lake of blood. Her clothes grow damp and crimson in the passage, but her progress never slackens.

Davron shakes his head. "Damnation!" he calls, caution thrown to the winds as he races forward into the grotto...

Ramar enters the passage calling out to Sun-and-Moon, "Wait! Come back!" He runs after the girl, his feet lightened by Essence as he moves with the quickness of lightning.

Immediately Davron and Ramar are seized with a cold sensation, as the claws of the dead themselves seek to rake over the warmth of their hearts and souls. The tree grows somewhat radiant, and the leaves blowing in an unfelt wind grow more and more agitated.

Chi-Yosh pauses at the entrance. He is alarmed, but perhaps there is something to Sun-and-Moon's attraction to the tree. Suspicions about the turn of fate upon meeting the new Solar shift into the concious. He moves to join his fellows, hoping to control the tree for he is attuned, and then the spectacle of threat takes over.

"Do what you will, oh souls of hatred, you shall not claim this girl's soul as your own." Ramar's voice quavers, but there a certainty to it that pervades a sense of calmness. "Sun-and-Moon... are you alright?"

"I am... home," whispers Sun-and-Moon, rising out of the bloody lake and wrapping her arms around the trunk of the tree, squeezing it tight in an embrace. Her eyes close, and tears squeeze from them. "I am home, my friends.."

Davron draws to a halt, and takes a step back, cringing at the unseen and hostile presence. "Sun-and-Moon! Don't you feel it? Don't you feel the hate?" he calls back... and then his eyes narrow with puzzlement. "Y...you don't, do you? Why isn't it attacking you?" As she responds, his eyes widen with the shock of sudden realization. "Lesell..." he whispers.

Ramar watches cautiously as Sun-and-Moon steps out of the lake of blood and embraces the tree. He looks around warily, and makes all haste for the girl and the tree... "Chi-Yosh... is there something you'd care to share with the rest of the class?"

Chi-Yosh's ear catches the dirge of spirits, angry whispers and half-muted emotions raging from the branches. "Stop! You will be free! Patience, resist blood and death, reward with freedom to Gaia!" He does not enter the chamber, just yet, lingering at its' opening. Even as he commands the spirits, Sun-and-Moon has his attention. Upon the trees embrace, skin marches in a dragon up his spine.

Ramar is hit with Davron's realization suddenly. "Lesell?" He watches the tree and the girl as they are locked in an embrace. "Is it... is there something we should be doing?"

Davron simply laughs, despite the chill range around him. "Don't you see? Don't you see, my friends? Why she was put in our path to _here_, and not anywhere else? She was _meant_ to come here, fated to do so!" He calms a bit, and calls out as he strides forward slowly. "Sun-and-Moon! Is it safe for us here, do you know?" His gait is cautious - he isn't certain how much she might know right now.

_Set us free.. let us have our fill of blood..._ The voices are everywhere now; the air is enough of a conduit for their bloodlust that their whispers are audible to all. "Yes, yes," intones Sun-and-Moon, as though crooning to a tender lover. "I will set you free.."

"Be careful... I trust you Sun-and-Moon... but I also worry for y-aaaugh..." Ramar cries out as the hatred of the souls within the tree rips through his body. He bites back the bile rising within and calls to Sun-and-Moon, "Do not release their hatred! Free them from it instead! Are you there? Can you not hear?"

Davron, too, grits his teeth as the chill seeps into his very bones, seeking to slow him down. "Ramar! We have to do something! She isn't listening! You're closest..." He cannot bring himself to retreat yet, not when his friend is in danger - even though he cannot imagine what he can do to save Ramar if he can't even save himself.

The cold chill in the air becomes stronger, and the howling of the spirits is audible. The jade leaves whistle and swirl, turning madly in sharp and aimless twists.

_This is it Ramar... her fate may well be out of your hands... but there is still something to try..._ Ramar takes hold of Sun-and-Moon's shoulders and tries to pull her back, "Stop! You've got to get out of here! Do NOT release them into the world to tear the living apart! Hear me Sun and Moon! Somewhere, beyond all hatred, hear me!"

The girl turns, eyes blank. "I'm not Sun-and-Moon, I am..." Her voice wavers, and her eyes lose focus. The Caste Mark on her brow shines and wavers, the Eclipse mark fading in and out slowly. "I am... home..."

"No!" Ramar feels the hatred of the souls rising higher and higher. Even as their tendrils of death grip him, as though they were sucking his very life from his body he fights to reach Sun-and-Moon. "Then... perhaps the Sun should shine down upon the tormented souls, and send them into Gaia's Embrace..." Ramar's eyes roll upwards, pupils disappearing behind his eyelids as the sky seems to part overhead. There is a bright pinpoint of light high above, and through it a stream of golden white light and sacred fire pours forth, streaking from above to wash over the corrupted souls within the tree. For a brief moment, everything in the room is illuminated with the light of a new day's Sun, and the shadows fade to nothingness... and then as quickly as it came the light and fire fade.

Chi-Yosh finally acts. It almost feels like slow motion. As the spirits gnaw at his very being, the Solar sturdies himself against it, while pushing forward towards the pair. Sun-and-Moon is torn between who she was and what she is; Lesell was a Zenith, and Sun-and-Moon... The Dawn pushes through the bloody moat, wading towards the Island. "You are home! This is your City, where you ruled..." He pauses in the middle of the water as the flash takes over his sight.

As the wash of Solar fire engulfs the tree, a brilliant golden light responds, and Ramar is bodily thrown back across the lake by the counter-blast, rolling like a limp rag-doll as he lands hard on the other side.

Ramar groans and tries to stagger to his feet. He is bloodied from the lake and charred from the counter-blast. He manages, after a moment or two, to get to his feet. "Sun-and-Moon! Lesell!" Pain tinges his voice, and there's defiance of the pure hatred seething about the room now, "Whoever you are! End this now..."

Davron shakes his head. The tree has made it clear that open attack is not the way to go. So there is only one hope - for he fears that Sun-and-Moon may herself bee in some manner of danger, though he does not understand how. Gritting his teeth to ignore the angry ghosts' claws upon his soul, he splashes into the lake and emerges from the other side. "You _are_ Sun-and-Moon! Come back!" He reaches out to her, this time not to simply attract her attention, but hoping to pull her away, in the hope that interrupting her will awaken her from her fugue.

Chi-Yosh makes it to shore, charging his way to Sun-and-Moon. Scrambling beside her, dodging Davron to get a look at her face, "You were Lesell, Zenith of the Unconquered Sun, ruler of the City of Dreams. This tree was ment as a tool of wisdom. Now these souls are tortured, after you fell into madness. Erisus! Do you remember Erisus? Remember who you **were**, and what you are now!"

Sun-and-Moon turns, the Caste Mark on her brow fading almost to nothing, as she gazes at Chi-Yosh with a wide-eyed and vacant expression. The screaming souls of the tree send ripples through the air of the grotto, straining at the bonds that confine them to the jade leaves.

Chi-Yosh ignores Davron's jostling, and almost plays tug of war with the fledgling Solar as he lurches forth. Hands cradle her head, one cupping the back, the other rubbing across the Caste mark. Nearly nose to nose with her, the voice he gives is soft, nearly lost to the wailing dead. "Lesell. Erisus. You were once a god graced by Helios. The memories from before are a nightmare, but remember them with resolve; you must. Free the souls now, they will consume the living. They must be purified. Remember, burning away the body and freeing the spirit? Remember Helios' divine promise?" He shakes her. "Who are you!"

Chi-Yosh digs his heel into the ground. It is quick and crude, scuffing and scratching, but the lines begin to take form, having some semblance to the symbol of the Founder. He angles Sun-and-Moon's head downward. "Look, at what once was yours! The Su'Katan, the tree of life, the village, the people, me, look! Your followers, your people!"

Ramar nearly flies across the lake as he fights off the soul-searing pain... Essence once more guides his body and in a flash he is beside Chi-Yosh, Davron, and Sun-and-Moon... or whoever it is that she is becoming. "What can I do to help?"

The girl shakes her head, then blinks, and again a Caste Mark flickers into existence on her brow. "I am home," she says again, in a stranger, stronger voice, and with one hand she touches the tree. At that moment, there is a screech louder than any of the three have ever heard.

The souls are loose. They pour from the jade leaves, howling for blood, demanding satisfaction. And Sun-and-Moon - no, Lesell - is ready for them. Her brow blazes with power, followed by her entire anima. "Protect yourselves!" she barks, in a tone that brooks no hesitation, the voice of command that once ruled a nation. "The dead come!" And from her anima, bolts fly, as she guides the power of the Zenith Caste to destroy one spectral attacker after another as they seek to batten on the four Solars.

Chi-Yosh stands his ground as the spirits come, those that trickle through the cracks of Lesell's power, or the dwindling that claw to unlife with stubborn ferocity. They are upon him, and the Dawn is both there and not there. While he does not move, they do not find him, and even if they do, he is solid and unyielding. Essence rages inside of him like a purifying pyre, solidified by the convictions and success of his cause: Lesell has been reborn, and the tortured past will be laid to rest. Their ethereal claws find no hold, their bloodlust finds no quench, for his body is no where to find, and the being behind flesh and blood has no chink in armor of piety.

Davron hesitates a moment, as the fully-reborn Solar looks back at him. Then he is off, bounding away over the golden roots of the tree. His advantage is mostly in speed and evasion, in being where the shades are not; and where that does not avail, he often must resort to his own Caste's ability, the flames of his anima stilling and coalescing for moments at a time to turn aside the attacks of the dead.

But as Davron draws upon his power to see the unseen, to more clearly see the ghosts and dodge their blows, his uncanny vision sees that there is something of the immaterial in all material things. Pulling his hammer from his belt, he charges it with Essence, trying to strengthen its immateriality, and swings wildly at his foes in response. The first few swings are fruitless, passing through the substanceless shadows, but then he feels the weapon connect, dragging through the shade as if through water. It is not efficient, not at all, but it is enough to dismay his assailants, and he lashes out with renewed vigor.

There is a bright sunburst of light that burns like lightning through the shadows of hatred now unleashed. Ramar seems to almost float within this sunburst as its shape gradually becomes that of the Anima. A towering figure crowned with a Halo of sunlight, adorned with Wings of purest light. Feathers comprised of nothing more than Essence flutter in an unseen and unfelt breeze... and these wings of light coalesce around the Solar's unflinching form, as the dead try to tear him to shreds... there is nothing for them to rend, save the burning light of the Unconquered Sun. Ramar speaks, his voice echoing with the power of the Sun... _**You shall find no blood to feed upon here, oh hateful dead. You shall have the peace you were denied for so long. Rest now.**_

With the loss of the souls in the tree, there is a rumbling that shakes the grotto. It seems that the Cathedral's very existence was buttressed by the spirits within, and all three of the occultists in the cavern remember what Chi-Yosh said about their whispers. Now, perhaps, whatever lay above will fade away as Creation erodes at it - or perhaps the City of Dreams will find its end more destructively. As Lesell's seemingly limitless power pours through the grotto, the Cathedral above, and the city beyond, howls in agony.

Chi-Yosh gathers up Sun-and-Moon, who has slumped over unconscious; Davron retrieves the battered Ramar, helping him limp out. The stairs lead upward into the ruins of a castle, whose fallen battlements and half-collapsed walls are halfway visible from the grotto. Shimmers of the Cathedral's great glamour sweep across it, but the structure of the city is already fading. Davron is called upon more than once to use his magics to unbar the way, or hold up a ceiling that might otherwise collapse. The four Solars race to the light.

Outside, the Fair Folk are waiting. "You have assaulted our city!" howls Olo, drawing his weapon. And a thousand warriors out in the city draw their own weapons, yelling their battle-cry as one with their elegant voices. A host of Fae charge the party, as it staggers up onto a half-toppled stone wall. And as the rampaging host are merely yards away, a great swirl of wind kicks up, and a shadow blots out the sun.

Ramar groans with agony... although it's not clear if it's from the pain, the prospect of the fight ahead, or the thought _What ELSE can go wrong..._ Regardless, the anima blazes brightly in the face of the Fae host. "You left us to do so, Olo. I suppose... if it has to come to this... then..." Ramar falls silent, "I don't suppose we can outrun them," he says, asking his friends and Circle-mates in a voice that's barely above a whisper.

Chi-Yosh shuffles the limp woman atop his shoulder, patning for breath as he regards the gathered Fae. Well, there is no way to explain themselves. The truce isn't exactly going to hold up after the rug was pulled out from under a Fairy city. Panting, sore, anima like an angry ghost clinging to his shoulders, he can only reach for Radiant Lightning. "We might as well give them a hell of a dance. Our true purpose has been served."

Davron grits his teeth, blood oozing from several cuts earned from splintering debris, and gazes out upon the Fair Folk horde. "The souls are at rest. Let us die well." His magics are depleted by the battle in the grotto and the retreat to daylight - he knows he and his companions cannot hope to prevail by mere force of arms. But he will not die before he can remind the Fair Folk what a Solar at war can do. He draws himself erect, drawing his bow and calling out a challenge of his own, arrow aimed at Olo's chest... pausing only a moment as darkness falls upon them...

"Ahoy!" calls a voice. The Solars look up. Their airship is descending over their position, and Los-Mian waves from over the side. "Aboard! Quick!" the man calls, fear written on his face. Many among the Fair Folk host draw bows, firing their weapons into the air at the offending airship, and seeking to bring down the hated Solars. Talu at the helm does his best to tilt the ship to deflect the archery, but his skill is not that of a professional.

"My friends, your timing is as welcome as always!" Patience may be a virtue, but right now, a speedy getaway is prefered. Hopping off of the broken wall and up a sinking tower, the Dawn pounces, running up the side of the ship to hurl himself over the railing. He hunkers down, ready for another volley.

"Come on!" calls Davron, laying down covering fire for the wounded Ramar as they make their way to the airship. He turns to face the Fair Folk as they charge at him, and looses a fiery bolt at them in farewell, before turning and leaping onto the railing and scrambling aboard behind Ramar.

The Solars make it aboard, dodging or deflecting the forest of arrows that streak toward them. Los-Mian is struck by an arrow and falls, crying in pain, until a surge of Essence from Ramar leaps out and strikes him - and the arrow that once pierced his torso is revealed as nothing more than a long, slender twig of wood, such as one might find in the forest around the city. He rises, shaking his head in puzzlement as the pain fades, and the airship streaks skyward, leaving the frustrated Fair Folk behind...

The air rushes by the airship, and Sun-and-Moon shakes her head slowly as she regains consciousness. "I..." She reaches for her brow, experimentally, and the Eclipse Caste Mark springs to life after a moment. It flickers, then fades, and she slumps down. She is utterly drained of Essence and vigor, but she is alive, and she manages a faint smile. "I feel older," is the only thing she says, before drifting off again, and letting sleep claim her.

Chi-Yosh scoops up Sun-and-Moon, rising once the ship is clear of the Fair Folk. Walking towards the passage downward, he is stopped by a curious Los-Mian. A simple look is shared between the pair, before the Su'Katan says to his comrade, "Know that the sins of the father have been forgiven by the penance of the son. The one who guided our founder was not a good woman, in her last days. But that she has wrought has been burnt and the ashes scattered, so life can grow once more." Los-Mian is solemn for a moment, then only nodding, before Chi-Yosh disappears below deck.
