# Gods of Eden 2004-06-23

The _zheng_ player sits in lotus in the corner of the dimly-lit inn, his instrument laid across his lap. His withered fingers lovingly stroke the strings of his instrument, giving a melodic voice to the melancholy of autumn and the carefree play of cormorants over waters drenched in sunset. The chairs of the inn sit in a semicircle, allowing the musician ample space while his audience listens, and every chair is filled. A few burly men, sellswords or mercenaries by their looks and gruff manners, occupy some and smoke the exotic herbs of the East in reed-stemmed pipes. A man of learning, the Realm's blood in his veins clear by his face and features, occupies himself likewise, talking in low tones as he leans across the arm of his chair to speak with one of the soldiers. Local men take up the remaining seats, content to listen to the zither's haunting whisper.

Outside, voices are heard, approaching the inn rapidly. The door opens and three men enter, calling for wine almost immediately in voices halfway out of breath. "Defiler's Grave!" one gasps. "The mountain's been opened! And the Hawkriders! Those barbarians atop the flying mountain! Do these sun-gods respect nothing?" A chorus of voices rise in question - this is news, even by the standards of the day. "What have they done now?" demands one of the locals, and the Realm-born scholar too cocks an ear, though he stays silent. "They've gone and spoken with the Hawkriders! They're allies now, we're told!" is the reply from the newcomers.

The sound of the _zheng_ slips quietly out of the room in the commotion; all that's left now are excited human voices. Finally one of the men who sat in appreciation of the music rises, shouting his fellows down until the entire inn is silently awaiting his pleasure. "Now listen here," this man of authority says. "The mountain has not erupted, as some would have you believe." He casts a withering glance at another seated nearby, and this boastful rogue shrinks into his chair silently. The speaker continues. "It's also been said that these gods went to Lookshy and saw their truthsay. And you remember Gen of Malas Mogant, to the south of us, the tyrant? He went to the truthsay and returned, and there's never been a fairer tyrant in that valley's history. So let's not assume that they're going to start a war here."

A storm of voices rise at the word 'war'. "Eldest, they've already attacked kingdoms! Their empire began in blood!" The Eldest, the speaker from before, shakes his head. "I've heard the tale of Bridal Veil," he announces firmly. "Like many in the Hundred Kingdoms, they were slavers, and they fought for the Realm, and in my mind they got what was coming to them. Others have fallen, yes, but to the peaceful nations they've been peaceful. Anathema or not, gods or demons, they're at least civil if you are."

The door swings open again, and all eyes turn to see two cloaked figures arrive. One is tall and imposing even in his garments, and as he casts back his hood, a simultaneous gasp stirs in the host of men and women crowded into the inn. His features are proudly and darkly handsome, the work of an inhuman artist rendering flesh into the visage of a warrior. He has a feral cast to him, and his eyes and hair are the iron-grey of a wolf's pelt. "My name is Olorudomu val-Natha. My companion is Arisetani. Tell us, good people, of these sun-gods, and we will be on our way."

---

The city of Great Forks lies fifteen hundred miles west of the Hundred Kingdoms region, over uncounted nation-states, farmlands, unclaimed wilds and wolf-haunted forests. This distance is of little consequence to Davron, whose mastery of the flying machines available to the Circle is more than adequate to pilot himself to the city. And awaiting him is a woman known as Ledaal Nara Temi, a very distant relation to the brothers Naro and Kano, who the Circle met in Greyfalls. She was a scholar of distinction a century ago, and Davron read her name in some of the books Chi-Yosh's aides have been assembling in the library. Now in her third century of life, she seems content to have settled into the City of Gods as a retired resident.

Some of the habits of secrecy have worn off Davron - the notoriety that comes of being one of the 'sun-gods' of a growing Nation have defeated his earlier concealment under the tutelage of the Master. So, though he does not proclaim himself or his true nature with great flourish, he also does not hide behind aliases or subterfuge. Instead, he arrives at the address of Nara Temi and knocks, firmly but politely upon the door. When asked, he intends to state his purpose plainly: "My name is Davron. I have come on the advice of Pai Tao of Nexus to seek your wisdom and your assistance."

The grand mansion of the grand artificer is a splendid product of marble, and the doorman is equally stately. With practiced grace he escorts the lady's guest inside, and with the ornate artistry of a dance performance he departs to convey Davron's arrival to the lady herself just as a maid arrives, all smiles in her modest robes, with a drink. In just the proper time to finish a glass of Nathir wine, the doorman returns with apparent instructions to convey the guest upstairs. And up the white marble steps the pair ascend, and to a room at the end of a long hallway whose entire length is hung with portraits of past luminaries. Important men and women of the Realm are depicted on one side; on the other, surprisingly, are portraits of many of the heroes of the Scavenger Lands: Dictatrix Brightsword, General Nefevrim of Lookshy, and other leaders and conquerers who held off the Blessed Isle long enough for the Scavenger Lands to unify.

In the expansive room at the end of the hall rests a Terrestrial Exalt. Her hair is white, and her fingers seem to tremble as she works, but nevertheless she retains the outlines of an attractive face and is evidently still active. She wears a long, loose robe tied with a silken sash, and sits near a bay window. The sunlight aids her in executing a painting; in her hands is a brush, and on the canvas, a the barest sketches of a face are beginning to take shape. She turns, smiling with green eyes that glow with enjoyment. "Come in, sir, come in and be seated," she offers, gesturing to a chair opposite the room. "Dansith, bring that closer for our guest." The doorman arranges for Davron to sit, then takes his respectful leave, and the woman smiles.

Davron glances at the canvas, clearly admiring the exquisite brush-strokes. After a time he speaks. "I..." he begins uncertainly, then takes a deep breath. Once again, the direct approach, since he still lacks the niceties. "I am a novice in the art of occult crafting, seeking ways to better my art. Pai Tao spoke highly of you... and I see that his praise was well-founded."

"You, an Exalt?" smiles Nara Temi. "You seem so... so...." She struggles for the proper word. "Well, I shall say you seem very much like an Easterner. But don't take offense at an old woman. I do not think I am much fit as a teacher, though. Tell me, though, what you dream of doing, and what you seek from me, and perhaps I can be helpful?" She gestures around, indicating the house as a whole. "This place is far more peaceful than the Blessed Isle, and here I encourage people to speak their minds fully. Art demands no less."

Davron chuckles softly. "I take no offense, for indeed I am from the East. I came to Pai Tao seeking _tools_ by which I could better direct my skills. He told me that you had undertaken a quest to enhance your own prowess, and that I should seek you to learn more."

"Ahh, you speak of the _ho te ri_," says the ancient artifex, with a knowing smile. "Let me tell you of it...."

---

Long ago, when the world was new, the Children of the Moon went in all directions for their masters, the Children of the Sun (and this, insists Nara, is a fabled origin for whatever truth may lie behind the matter). And they found a valley where birds can fly only south in the wind, never any other direction. And they found other things besides, and marked these places as landmarks. And they found a spring, which they called _ho te ri_, though it had another name, and that name meant "the bubbling of living gold that flows from the heart of the earth".

This spring, some say, is the outpouring of the blood of a defeated demon, whose body lies far beneath the surface of the earth. And others say it is the sun's blood that pours through when he is cut by sharp rocks on his passing through the underworld to return to the east before dawn comes. But whatever the truth, the liquid gold that pours from the spring and joins the waters of a nearby river is possessed of something: the spark of life, the genius of creativity, some inner shard of awareness perhaps. And one can pour this gold into specially prepared molds, casting tools out of it. It is said that weapons poured from it will not cut or bludgeon, that the aura of purity on the spring resists being forged into weapons of war.

Nara Temi journeyed to this place in her youth, or so she says, and with the spring of gold, _ho te ri_, created shining tools of occult craftsmanship that sparkle with the sun's light even in a darkened room. And with them she worked many wonders, excelling in all things that an artist does. The spring's location was told of in an ancient book, a book long-lost until she found it (and she does not say how).

---

"It is the spring you seek, or is it my tools? If you spoke with Pai Tao, perhaps he gave you the book I used," the old Exalt says, concluding her tale. "If you have it, you may find _ho te ri_ for yourself, and need not trouble yourself with tales told by an old woman. But I have little use for my tools now, and would offer them to the right inheritor. Tell me, Davron, are you the proper heir?" And her eyes grow wise, and piercing, and Davron knows with certainty that this woman was trained in the legendary secondary schools of the Realm, where every graduate who survives could rule an empire if given the chance.

Davron returns the old sage's gaze. "I may well be. What do you seek in an heir? Do you seek proof that I can use them effectively... or that I will use them justly?"

Nara Temi smiles. "Neither," she answers, with surprising vigor. "I want to know that you will use them to beautify the world. So again I say..tell me your dreams and hopes. Tell me to what end you would use living tools."

Davron takes a deep breath. Such a question... and it needs a proper answer. "We live in a world torn by war, brother against brother, father against son. And often than not, such wars are mere foolishness, each cruelty a mindless act of revenge for the last cruelty, fomented by lies and distortions. I would see an end to that. I would create artifacts that would open the eyes of men to the hurts they wreak upon each other."

"Difficult, because there are men who wage war with their eyes open," the Exalted elder replies with a faint trace of sadness in her smile. "But perhaps there is nothing to be done for them. And would this make the world a more beautiful place?"

"It is my view that those who wage war with their eyes open do so only with the help of those they keep in the dark," answers Davron. "And... how can the world help but be more beautiful, if the ugliness of foolish wars is abated?" He sighs softly. "I know well that there are some wars that must happen. But if foolish wars are averted, more men can turn their minds to creating things of beauty rather than weapons and death."

"Interesting..." The old woman smiles again, more brightly, and rises from her seat. "Come with me," she urges, and Davron is led down the hall, down two flights of stairs and along a low passageway of stone carved to resemble creeping ivy. At length she arrives in a large chamber, shaped like an inverted hemisphere. The workshop is well-equipped, and Davron recognizes more modern versions of the tools taken from Defiler's Grave. He can spot missing implements as well, and for a brief moment the losses of the First Age make themselves a heavy burden on his heart.

"Go to the center of the room," instructs Nara Temi gently, "and take hold of the long-hammer with your left hand. Place your right on the anvil." Gleaming golden tools await Davron's presence at the center of the workshop, and the artificer gestures mildly. "You have the mein of a young man who's not yet taken a wife. Picture the gift you would give to a new bride, and describe it to me. Tell me about the wonder you would bestow upon her."

Davron does as Nara Temi instructs, his cheeks coloring noticeably. "I... oh boy," he says, chuckling bashfully. He half-closes his eyes, forming a mental picture first of the woman who may be his bride, his blush deepening as he realizes that there is a name to go with that image. "I would create..."

The night is growing quite old when Gallius is free from her duties. She's been considering testing this new advisor on two issues. Two things that have troubled her mind for some time. Both relate in some way, she imagines, but first she must think of the strength she will need to manage the second.

Gallius, knowing Sidereals, approaches the door to the Fisher's chamber and simply waits, counting seconds in her mind. Before she reaches a count of three a voice from inside calls out, "You may enter." The Queen smiles to herself and pushes open the door, glad for now just to be away from the usual flock of toadies that any royalty draws.

The Fisher keeps his dwellings spartan and simple; even his Celestial home, grand as it may have seemed to those unfamiliar with the nature of Yu-Shan, had the same aura of elegant absence. Right now the Sidereal is toying with a small carven figurine, a child's toy any woodcarver could produce in a few hours of artistic effort. He raises his head and smiles. "I am at your service."

"I have done a task in the past," begins Gallius, "Services for a god for which I was rewarded with a greater trust, a deeper ability to make use of the energies of creation. To go any further, I must find more who seek services and will provide similar rewards. Whatever the tasks. I do not know how long they might take, but I have a need to grow far more powerful than I am now. If creation is to survive without terrible damage I must have the strength to guide it better. Time is against me more than I ever imagined."

"You are confident that the rush to power is not also inherently dangerous to your state of mind?" asks the Fisher slowly. There is no hint of personal recrimination or smirking superiority as a Bronze Faction adherent; it is simply a question put to a leader by an advisor chosen for his forethought.

"Perhaps it is," replies Gallius. "I do not think that essence is the source of the problem Solars faced, however," she adds. "I do know that if there is a risk, it must be faced. We do not have the luxury to wait forever. We are growing, but I know our enemies better than I used to. They are growing stronger far faster than we are. And now we are revealed."

"Some revelations are your own responsibility. Others have been thrust upon you." The Fisher muses quietly. "Your reasons for the former are of course your own. The reasons behind the latter.... " Again he hums, and it seems from the expression on his face that he is savoring the examination of a puzzle or riddle. "You seek the blessings of the gods, rather than finding your own path to your sealed memories?"

"I don't have time for finding my own path," answers Gallius. "My hands are busy elsewhere. Besides, this service has another purpose. Solars are meant to bridge the gap between mortals and gods, it seems. This service may well make it clear whether that impression is correct or not."

"Interesting," smiles the Sidereal. "Shall I tell you of the Celestial Bureaucracy when the Solars reigned, and the sparks the gods have bestowed upon the Chosen, and why I find humor in what you say?"

"If it would help me find my place in the world, it would be of aid," says Gallius. To her, it is clear that every second requires a purpose, these days. "I want to know the swiftest ways to restore the parts of the past that I believe served a good purpose while preventing those that lead to disaster."

"The very act of dealing in gift-exchanges with individual gods - in short, bribery - is one of the great banes of the Hierarchy," he explains. "Perhaps you do not seek to restore the harmony that once existed, but to establish a new pattern of interaction between humans and spirits. That is your affair, and I will support it if that is what you wish of me. Nevertheless, as you must have learned from your first such blessing, it is the closeness of your soul with the Celestial spark embedded within it that permits you to channel Essence in greater ways. The more you learn of your past existence, the closer you come to the hubris and inhumanity that characterized the Solars at the close of the First Age. Do you understand? Every step on your road to power takes you closer to the madness that overthrew them. Nevertheless, I will aid you. The Solars of that time did not understand the true nature of their deaths; but you do. Perhaps it will be enough."

Gallius considers for a time, frowning deeply. "If I do not risk suicide, I cannot save them," she says simply. "Very well. I will risk my life, and you will promise that if I fail as I did, you will not fail to kill me."

The Fisher inclines his head. "There was something of madness even in the Sidereal Exalted of the time," he says, simply. "There is madness even now in the Lunars, if reports are to be believed. And were it not for the long-gone Solars and their wonders, the Fair Folk would now rule what was once the world. It seems that Creation is fated to madness." He smiles, sadly, and sets down an uncarved block of wood that was once a child's carven toy. "We will all do what we think is wise, and if we succumb to it again, perhaps our inheritors will fare better. But for now, I will act as you direct." He rises. "I go to Yu-Shan. I will return when I have brokered an arrangement with a god who can and will grant what you ask."

Gallius nods her head and sighs. "And I must see what I can do about preparing for the next step," she says calmly. "Thank you, Fisher. I do not understand why you help us, but I believe you will do the task well. And I hope together we can find a way to not go mad."

---

Three days have passed. And late one evening, as Gallius stares up at the stars after a long and trying day, she feels a tap on her shoulder - surprisingly, since there is no other sign of a presence, and she sees no one as she turns quickly. Instead, on the ground, is a simple rag of cloth, on which is painted words: "Three would-be rebellions put down in the last month. I'm getting bored. Challenge me." Apparently this is a message from the unseen (and perhaps unseeable) spy that attracted Chi-Yosh's attention in Kirighast.

Gallius turns to speak casually to the air. "There are some things that are terribly trying," she says simply. "Cloven Hoof, Sunbeam's End, and Eyralt are all lead by dangerous tyrants. Some of their cousins, I understand, have been exiled and would leap at a chance to retake their place in their realms. Even if it meant joining anathema. Of course, it is dangerous, and even a hint of involvement might cause untold problems.."

"The Guild is also irritating, of course. They no doubt mean to interfere in the fate of the Nation of the Sun soon, and I do not yet have long enough roads to put all the guilty on gibbets along them." Gallius smirks and goes on speaking to herself, "It would be much easier were they to be convinced that such interference is far from profitable. And that doesn't even scratch the surface of the issues. I understand that there are some pirates troubling river trade. Apparently there is an exalt among them, if stories are to be believed. Bringing that one to heel would be of great aid."

"I imagine there should be more, of course," says Gallius. "There are three dangerous wyldings running loose on the southern borders. I have heard they are remarkable due to their pelts. The people would be greatly eased if their queen were to appear at her next proclamation wearing a robe that makes it quite clear what has happened to the beasts. Oh, and if I had someone with a very skilled eye and a nose for finding things that are hidden.. I imagine there simply must be reasonably useful mines somewhere near my borders where silver, jade, or orichalcum might be found."

After a moment, Gallius notices there's something else underneath the cloth rag - another, smaller slip of paper, on which is written, "I will see to it."

---

The Fisher returns the next morning, sending a message for Gallius to meet with him when she is available. And in his chambers, he extends a sealed scroll-case. "There are two prominent families on the Blessed Isle," he explains. "A wedding must be arranged, involving one member of each family. They need not marry each other, I'm told, but both need reliable spouses. Those in the Bronze Faction are far too busy with other matters to arrange this, and those in the Gold Faction are unwilling to aid - they contend that this is not the business of any other Convention, and they are correct. Arrange whatever weddings can be arranged. Go with guile, and the Sidereals will not trouble you while you are on the Isle. Bring whomever you wish." He pauses, as though hesitant to speak further, though clearly something else weighs on him.

"You may say whatever you wish to me, Fisher," says Gallius. She takes the scroll-case and opens it, drawing out the contents but not yet reading. "I know I shall speak freely with you. If we do not carry on with trust, I know in my bones that we are doomed to destroy the world once more."

"I, and my faction, are being sent a message with this," he continues, uneasily. "This is a .. political matter. We are being slighted for our busy schedule. The goddess herself has other servants; she is willing to favor you to insult us." His tone and expression make it clear that he finds such petty dealings distasteful. "You may sense resentment from those of us you will meet. I wished you to understand the specific cause."

"Fisher, how do you know which gods are worthy of our aid?" asks Gallius. "Many of them sound petty. I have seen the Maidens, Luna, Gaia, and Helios, and I know that the honor of serving any of them is greater than I will ever deserve, but what of the others? How can we be sure of them? Do you know why this marriage is important? What is at stake, and who profits?"

"I do not know all the truths of the matter," replies the Sidereal gravely. "I know two things that lead me to suspect more. First, that the father of one of the two prospects is from Gaia - born there of Gaian parents, and brought here upon his death in that place. Second, that there is some auspicious destiny attached to his fate, signed and sealed by the Maiden of Serenity herself."

"So this is a very delicate matter," says Gallius. "And it is odd.. if the Maiden of Serenity believes this fate so important.. I can see why the Sidereals would be upset that this task is falling into my hands." The Queen frowns for a moment, trying to make guesses at the politics of heaven. "I do not know near enough to guess. I know enough to understand that this is not going to smooth things over very well with the Bronze Faction."

"They will not interfere," states the Fisher, with conviction. "The Bureau of Destiny will not allow its good name to be sullied so openly. You will be safe."

"I do not really mean that," says Gallius. "I just don't like snubbing them. Or being a part of such an act. The management of fate is the duty and right of the Sidereals, after all. I have yet to figure out just how the rest of us fit in, but.. in time I will. We are all meant to work together. I imagine that the way it ought to be is together. No matter how that goes, I think the Sidereals will be those giving most of the advice."

"Very well. Go when you wish. Take who will come." These are the Fisher's word's of advice, and he allows himself a small smile. "Leave your weapons behind. You will not need them."

"In all the most important things I have done of late my spear has proven to be of painfully little use," says Gallius, letting out a sigh. "Oh, if it would not bore you, I would appreciate it if you joined me at council meetings. You see things better than I do and have a feel for the future. The people would benefit greatly if you joined us, and they are my ultimate concern. I will understand if you do not wish to be quite so public, but I would appreciate it if you at least considerd it."

"The Sidereals have had seven millennia to consider openness," replies the Fisher quietly. "The end of the First Age removed our ability to make the choice for ourselves, however."

"Many things that were done, Fisher, must be undone," says Gallius softly. "I can't believe that there is any wrong so terrible that we cannot mend it. I will do what I can to help you, if you wish to share more with me. I already know something of a hole that was left in the Lunars, and perhaps one who is powerful enough to guide me on the dangerous and long path to aiding the children of Luna.. which is part of a theory of mine." She smiles and explains swiftly, "I think that the Solars must offer healing to their celestrial cousins to find the path to their own healing. If we heal others, perhaps the final path will be clear."
