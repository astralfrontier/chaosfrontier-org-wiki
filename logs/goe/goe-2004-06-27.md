# Gods of Eden 2004-06-27

Queen Gallius Leom, the Lioness, Queen of the Nation of the Sun, is absent today. In her place stands Lady Arafein, a noblewoman who has lost her position and place due to the troubles in the nation of Harborhead. After much struggling she has managed to find her way to the Blessed Isle. Another one of a growing number who wish to hide from the rising forces of the Anathema.

Her way was bought from Goodharbor, and her clothes carefully gathered. Rich, but slightly out of date. A mix and match of good and less good weaves. Fit for a lady who has fallen quite far from the lifestyle she was once accustomed to. The Lady Arafein is, after all, a refugee.

The boat trip to the Imperial City was uneventful; many sail to the Blessed Island in search of refuge or opportunity, even knowing that they will be beggars on the streets when they arrive. It is better than to be embroiled in the war that seems poised to wash over the Threshold. And at the Imperial City itself, on the outskirts, Gallius can see just how far poverty, greed, charity and pride can go. Shanty-towns have always existed on the outskirts of the city - indeed, pitching shelters outside the Imperial Manse is how the city was formed. Now they are packed with people. Beggars hold out alms-bowls, and the devoted adherents of the Immaculate doctrine toss coins into them with murmured blessings. Though few in this place will find their way out quickly, and though many wear dirty clothes or even rags, few go hungry.

Atop the roofs of inns, shops and brothels that line the shore, people sit to watch the sunset - in this season, there is a spot in the Imperial City where one can watch the Sun descend almost directly down on the tip of the far-distant Imperial Mountain. Gallius is among those gathered here, guided by some instinct, and with those around her she beholds the magnificent vanishing act of her patron god as he slides behind the mountain. The wind's breezes blow in from the east, catching her hair and tugging playfully at it. Around her, travelers, merchants, men in scarlet and green robes from the guild-houses of the city, and even children and young couples occupy the sea of rooftops, and all seem entranced by the sight.

Lady Arafein watches as the others do, appreciating the sight, though not as much as she would were she not standing on the edge of a razor. She did not come her to gawk at the city, nor even to learn more about its people, though that is likely to be critical in achieving her task. As is her usual way, her mission is all. How it is to be achieved she has yet to even guess. It is yet another service that will make her new friends and new enemies, no doubt. The first things to do are the practical. Food and shelter and directions.

In the presumed privacy of her third-story room, the Hidden Lady again opens the scroll-case the Fisher presented to her. Inside are three things - an unsigned explanation of the principals meant for her eyes only, a letter of introduction to one Zetai Kalthazar written by a senior member of the Heptagram, and a similar letter addressed to the headmaster of the Cloister of Wisdom, signed by the same individual. She reads the explanatory note again.

"Attending the Cloister of Wisdom is a girl named Ragara Calel Chandra. Go to the Cloister - it is located in the Incas Prefecture, in the southeast of the isle, near the city of Sion. To enter, you will need the aid of a man named Kalthazar, who is Ragara's liaison to the school. He can be found in the Imperial City at the time of your arrival." A basic outline of the Zetai household's location in the city follows this. "Give him the letter of introduction and he will conduct you. We believe that Chandra is best suited for marriage to Nellens Chenault Linus, a mortal of House Nellens, though another Nellens candidate may serve."

Lady Arafein studies the orders with pursed lips. They fortunately indicate nothing of her station, save that someone important is commanding her. Most helpful in the case of disaster, she imagines. She memorizes this short letter and takes care in burning it. The letter of introduction she tucks back in the scroll case and the lady prepares to make contact with Kalthazar. A liaison to a school. She at least should not suffer too much difficulty in locating him.

The Imperial City started life as the camps of petitioners to the newly-acceded Scarlet Empress, centuries ago. People of importance, and their retinues, had come from across the entire Isle, and even from some places in the Threshold, to lay themselves penitent at the doorstep of the Imperial Manse. This chaotic, politically conscious origin shows itself in the arrangement of the city, with streets bearing the names of famous figures from history, reputed heroes, and other people whose destinies were fated to intertwine with that of the Scarlet Empress. One's placement in the city is almost a matter of random chance, and yet the political boundaries have laid stable for centuries.

Finding that district loyal to House Ragara is easy; finding the household of the Zetai family is more challenging, but no different in principle. Several people the Lady stops to speak to think it strange that she should travel unescorted, and two gentlemen (neither of much repute by the look of them) offer to act in this capacity. Nevertheless she arrives before the front door of a mansion, the Zetai household, without incident.

The Lady looks over her clothes carefully. All seems in place, though not as well as it ought to be. A far step from the finery she had grown used to. She strikes the door with forced calm and waits to be greeted. There's a beggar at the door, she thinks wryly.

The door opens easily on well oiled hinges. As it does, the scents of exotic-and expensive-incense wafts out. A man dressed in the elegeant finery of House Ragara's servants stands in the doorway. "A cordial greeting to you, is there some way I may be of service?"

The Lady Arafein greets the man with a pleased smile, as if she had imagined the door might not have been opened for her. "My name is Lady Arafein, it was suggested to me that I should speak with Master Kalthazar, if he has the time to receive me." She adds a slight wavering to her voice, making it clear that she is far from in a commanding position.

"I see. I shall go and see if the Master is at home. Please wait here." And with that, the servant moves to close the door, presumably to talk the matter over with Master Kalthazar. A few moments later, the door will open once more. "Please come in. The master will be with you shortly." He then leads the Lady Arafein through the door and into a lavish waiting chamber. The house is richly decorated, and it's clear to see that what is being displayed is designed to impress, or convey importance to guests. Another servant walks in with a glass of wine. "Please sit, the master will be with you shortly. You are welcome to wine while you wait."

Lady Arafein accepts the wine, wafting it and then sampling with a smile. She absently thanks the servants, her mind already turning to the truly important tasks. After all, Lady Arafein is supposed to hold herself aloof from the servers, even though her eyes weigh the bearing and disposition of every one she sees.

The servants depart for their stations, leaving Arafein to wait in the room. It's a very nice room. The furniture is both comfortable and made of rather fine material. Paintings adorn the walls, and every now and then a breeze blows past, causing the windchimes to play their tune. It so happens that these windchimes tend to play a few different tunes, depending on the wind. Several minutes pass. Time enough to get comfortable in the seat and to finish perhaps half of the glass. It's also time enough to convey the importance of the master's time.

The door opens once more. Another man walks in, although this one is dressed in clothing much to nice for any mere servant, even one of the Grand Houses. He is impeccably groomed, and walks rather gracefully into the room. "Welcome to my home," he says, while taking a seat in one of the chairs. "Please, make yourself comfortable. I am told you are the Lady Arafein? I am Zetai Kalthazar." There's an easy smile on his face, "I hope your day has been well." There is the obligatory exchange of pleasantries, and then, "What is it you wished to speak with me about?"

Lady Arafein needs no introduction to know the man of the house when she sees him. She offers up a curtsey fit for a woman who has fallen far to a man who stands quite comfortably above her. She answers with a calm voice, however, though her eyes drift to betray a bit of unease. "It is an honor to meet you, Master Kalthazar. I believe this letter will explain much better than my words." At this, the Lady offers the letter of introduction, its unbroken seal held up where Kalthazar may see it clearly.

Kalthazar takes the letter in his hands. He holds up an ornate, silver-stemmed eyepiece and proceeds to break the seal and read the letter. "Letter of introuction..." he murmurs. Every so often, at pre-selected intervals, he mouths a few sentences, or pauses to clean his lens. When he's finished, he idly toys with the handle of his monocle and regards his guest. "You come highly recommended Lady Arafein." There's a wry smile forming at the corners of his mouth as he finishes his statement.. He bows in turn, "Well, this is a rather interesting letter. I take it that you are hoping to attend sometime soon? Or is there some other reason you wish to go there?"

"As you have no doubt heard, Master Kalthazar," begins Lady Arafein, "Things off the Blessed Isle have gone far from well in many places. A few months past, I had thought my future and that of my heirs quite firmly established. Things change swiftly, and I must change with them. I have much to learn, but I have always been told that I have great potential. What better thing for me to do than learn all I may?"

"I suppose you refer to the little matter in the East. It's doubtless things will be cleared soon enough. Barbarians and criminals, and nothing more." Kalthazar speaks rather disdainfully. "I see at least that our attempts to produce civilization out there have some degree of success, if you're any example of our citizens living out that way." His voice has moved from disdain to flattery, "Now then, that I might best... aid you... what is it you need from me?"

"I wish to spend a time in the Cloister," says Lady Arafein. "I am aware how exclusive such an education is, but if I am given just a short time to prove myself worthy, I will not disappoint. The hopes of my house are not what they were, but I must not fail my heirs. I wish to achieve a suitable station and find a proper husband to secure their futures, and my own, as well."

"Very well..." Kalthazar turns his back to one of the paintings for a moment. "That painting was done by one of the students. Quite nice it was. I helped him as well." He turns back, "It will not be too difficult to give you the aid you hope for. You should be warned, Lady Arafein, that the instructors and even the students may be prejudiced, or harbor the same feelings that their own Houses hold... are there any... er... difficulties between your house and any of the others I should be aware of?"

"I rather doubt it," answers Lady Arafein. "What influence we had ended at the sea. I had meant to change things, to come here on my own terms, in time." She frowns deeply. "In any case, there are none who will have any reason to think poorly of Lady Arafein at the Cloister. And I shall do my best to see it stays that way."

"It goes without saying." Kalthazar does his best to indicate he believes this to be true. He might not succeed. "Now... how am I to introduce you, Lady Arafein, if and when the opportunity should arise?"

"Lady Arafein of House Galt will suffice," says the Lady. "There is nothing else to offer them, I fear. My home lies in ashes for all I know. Or it is a sanctuary for those who seized it." She manages to assume something of an even expression once more.

"Very well. That... can be dealt with." Kalthazar nods to himself. "For now... we will need to get you prepared for the Cloister. I'll have my servants find you more appropriate clothing and prepare a room among the guest quarters out back. Unless of course you have a place of your own to sleep. I shall leave in the morning to make the necessary arrangements."

The Zetai household is probably safer than anywhere else available; as retainers to House Ragara itself, a virgin girl carrying her weight in jade on a cart at night would be safe within a hundred yards of the mansion. Finding Linus may be a harder matter, but the girl Chandra is attending the Cloister of Wisdom, and she has no place to go. Finding and studying her will be very easy. With this thought in mind, the Lady attempts sleep, and finds dreams.
