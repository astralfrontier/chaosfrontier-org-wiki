To the city of Great Forks, Davron went. And from that city, Davron returns, the airship he came aboard loaded. The elder Terrestrial dispatched a letter with him, addressed to Pai Tao but also for his eyes. In it, she suggests that the scavenger-merchant rely on Davron for his future needs, and that she intends to fully retire to her life of ease and art.

Wings teeming with Essence slash the sky in a rapid dash, the flyer diving and surging through the air. Wind laughing all around, dancing just out of reach, before darting through the treetops. A burst of speed given to an arc over the trees, before the downwards plummet of the Volo ends with the contraption hovering. Air coils and churns before it, dirt and leaves coloring the wind sprite's outline. "The trees, they slowed me down." "Yes," Smiles the Easterner. "Caught you. Now, as I was saying..."

Smoke claws at the air, rippling in anger as the fire shrieks in the song of consumption. But the blaze is dwindling, the anger slowly ebbing. The Solar stands before it, skin scorched from the flame's tongue, but held triumphant in a hand is the glowing spark of everlasting coal. Searing tendrils claw at the dirt in exasperation as the ember's heartbeat drains. After a moment, the popping, hissing sigh whispers through the underbrush. "I agree..."

Chi-Yosh winces as the air whips over his burns, every movement of the Volo painful. The Elementals are wiley creatures, some wanting payment or favors in return, others stubborn and requiring to submit and respect their master. Others have no consciousness, like instinctive embodiments of the poles, and need to be handled like wild tigers or tamable puppies. The work is hard, for some of the creatures have the secrets to their operations, and others are brunt and, like any part of the landscape, must be overcome to be mastered.

The Solar sits before the cracked walls of the ravine and waits. After a time, eroding from the walls steps the squat, square figure, eyes of faceted quartz surveying the Exalt. On cue, Chi-Yosh opens a purse and dumps the contents, rubies that capture the rays of the sun. "I will speak to my brothers," rumbles Edifice.

The Maze Forest has grown thick and untamed since the Wood elementals took over. Yet there are whispers among them, brought by birds, that loggers are coming. They have yet to set up camp, but the signs are there; the surveying men, the camp site markings, caravans coming from the northwest. Yet it is a surprise, as captured sunlight writhes around a figure as he walks into the heart of the forest, and waits. "Yoooou... have come." "To fulfill my bargain. And when I am done, I wish to make a second." "Yesss..."

---

With the aid of Chi-Yosh's new allies, Davron has found himself a likely location. Nestled in a thickly-wooded valley near the northern edge of the Nation's boundaries, in a place where only woodsmen go, is a low hill with an orchard nearby. And atop this hill is a great tree. The spirit governing the valley gives permission for the use of it, and for the rocky cliffs and plateau just behind it. The tree is shaped through the cunning hands of woodworking elementals. It continues to live, but now within it is a common-room, a smaller bedroom above, and a small library adjacent to the ground flood. It's a homey and comfortable dwelling, useful as a second home. And behind it, in the cliff, is the source of its necessity.

Into the cliff, and throughout it, caverns are hewn by the diligent and hard-working elementals. A central chamber, large enough to hold three dozen Warstriders, holds the abstracted tools from the Defiler's Grave site. And to this collection the scholar adds the shimmering golden tools he received in the city of Great Forks. He spends at least a week in dedicated effort to organize this collection, and at the end of this time, while the magical creatures are burrowing other chambers around the primary, the workshop is a magnificently organized machine.

The subsidiary chambers act as storage-rooms or auxiliary work areas; one, near the top of the hill, is the first foundation for an orichalcum-refinery. A source of lava, and mirrors of the proper design, are necessary - but perhaps in time, and with effort, even these things can be obtained. And while they continue their work, Davron reviews some of the ancient books that were also found in the mountain, hidden in corners or behind secret doors. Some of them describe crafting techniques lost to the modern age, and among them is Legend-forging, whereby the power of belief augments a magic wonder.

The day is waning. The sky is colored with the hues of the setting Sun, when Ramar appears. A soft wind accompanies his arrival, bringing in the first hints of the night's cool embrace. Leaves order themselves around Ramar, swirling subtly, then clinging to the folds of his garb. "It is time," he says. He speaks softly, as light as the clouds in the sky, "I hope you are ready... there is much to learn... we should head for the Gate." He spends a moment studying the board between Davron and Chi-Yosh. "If you place your next stone about three down from where you currently are considering it, you will have victory in two moves." Ramar gestures to the black and white stones littering the board, "Now, when you have finished, we shall be on our way. I have the airship prepped and ready to leave."

Chi-Yosh regards the board with a purse of his lips. He left his left flank open while going for a pincer maneuver with the two leaping stones. A solid nod as he sees the chink in his armor. "Ramar, I would like to take a detour to Bridal Veil. Cloudburst has been working hard on the college, and perhaps a holiday in Yu-Shan will show appreciation for her hard work."

"Very well... although it will be a while yet before we head for Yu-Shan. We are going to study the Gate itself, not the destination I am afraid. Now then... I hope you have packed everything you need... if all goes well we should be arriving shortly. Please..." speaks Ramar, his voice calm, deadly calm, "Take care when doing this. Study the diagrams and notes I've assembled for you... I do not care to lose my friends this night, nor any other night... especially not to this. The Pe layer is the one to watch out for..." And Ramar's voice trails off into silence as he guides the Airship through the sky, racing with the setting sun... there are still a few rays of daylight remaining when the ship arrives in Bridal Veil, "Go and get Cloudburst. If we hurry we can arrive just as the sun sets..."

Finding Cloudburst is far from difficult. A good portion of Bridal Veil has come to revolve around her orders, the college having all the funding its capable leader could require. Much work has been done already, but nothing has eclipsed Cloudburst's efforts in uncovering lost tomes and dusty old manuals. It is hardly surprising that half a manor is used just to hold the books while they are sorted.

It is in this swirl of activity and careful study that Cloudburst can be found. With a most satisfied smile she is reviewing an inventory, one of many papers that are painstakingly organized on her desk. "Everything is coming quite well. Quite well, indeed," she murmurs to a pair of old men who sit in front of her. "Once the library is ready we will be able to arrange things very much to the liking of all the scholars, thanks to your work," she adds. The two men sit up straighter and bask in the approval of Cloudburst. And this is how she is as Chi-Yosh comes to her.

Chi-Yosh walks around the pillars of folders and papers that decorate the office like a thicket. He bows to the pair and their mistress, smiling between the two old men to the Scavenger Lord herself. "Good evening. The Sun has nearly disappeared. I believe it's time for a holiday from the great mechanics of your jobs. Cloudburst, I invite you to come with me and my Circle to see the Gate, and beyond, to the greatest Bureaucracy of them all."

"There is no time to waste," shouts Ramar, who has the ship in motion as soon as Chi-Yosh and Cloudburst are aboard. Before any of the others have had the chance to settle in, it is off like a flash. The cool evening air whips about the ship's deck as it carves a path through. As the last rays of the sun disappear behind the sky, and Night prepares to roll its inky blanket of stars across the world, the airship arrives. Ramar swings down, landing near the gate and begins incanting softly, causing the runes upon the old, battered, stone doors to light up, however faintly. "Come on you three... we need to get as much information as we can. Remember to mind the different layers of Essence... please. We are to study the Gate and determine how we can build another. To a destination of our choosing... this will be our model for departure and arrival points..."

The Gate itself is glowing with Essence. Ramar, for his part, is focusing the majority of his attention on this as he channels a faint stream of Motes through the Gate, tuning it through carefully, so as not to disturb things anymore than necessary. There's not much, just enough to keep it active for study... "We should study the way Essence interacts with itself... I believe it's called 'Sympathy'. There are various layers, whose names mean little... but there is one relating to closeness and distance... the Pe layer, I believe it is called."

What Ramar refers to is _pe ka ma ri_, a term he remembers from En and recites to the others as the study continues. The Essence that forms the world can be found in layers - "lower" layers embody more fundamental aspects of reality, while "higher" layers are responsible for more specific effects, such as the workings of magic. Davron is at least roughly familiar with the specific layers, though to hear the old name for it sparks other memories that pirouette across his consciousness like an evasive veil-dancer.

When one creates magical effects, one must either empower or draw upon the Essence of one or more such layers - usually several at once. When working sorcery or invoking Charms, Essence filters into the anima banner of an Exalt, and from there, the Chosen directs it "down", embedding it into the world around him. More sophisticated effects - the spell of Travel Without Distance, for example - are more complicated because of the maze-like pathways of Essence they must establish.

Cloudburst provides a good share of information. She knows a great deal about the workings of essence, and she provides names of the books she has read concerning the direction of higher essence forces into the lower levels, taking the conception and making it reality. "I have a few sources. "The Spinning Worlds" was composed by a man known as The Grinning Fool, and he was mostly interested in the most theoretical levels of knowledge. He wrote in a rambling manner, as if he was eager to say something, but afraid to say it too clearly. Another example is Fullhorn's "Winding Voices". Fullhorn writes in such a way that you aren't entirely sure that she's even speaking of magic, but this tends to be the way of these things. Some even think Fullhorn wasn't even the true author, but rather was just copying a still older work."

"In any case, they were never direct about their research or findings. However, it was clear that it was easiest for them to work on things directly, rather than trying to wind about reality. A gate, I imagine, is going to involve a lot of tunneling through the real." And with that, Cloudburst falls silent once more.

Chi-Yosh walks around the platform before the doors, feeling the resonance of his steps through the stone. The vibration ripples through like his anima that brushes against the folded Essence of the Gate. He can feel it, like running a hand along the side of an empty river bed to feel the different sediments and rocks. Fingers finally settle on the great doors, and while he lets information soak through his ears, the power soaks through into his touch.

Davron takes up a position opposite Chi-Yosh and lets his own Essence flow into his anima, fascinated simply by the study of nature and reality that this Gate represents. He half-closes his eyes, the better to clear the vision of his mind's eye as a vision of Essence shapes itself before him. As he gazes into the forming portal, he studies the strands of Essence as they weave themselves into threads, the threads weave themselves into ropes, and the ropes weave themselves upon...

It is hard to describe in words what it is that Davron sees Ramar's Essence flow into, but if he had to describe it to a non-Essence user, he would speak of an intricate crystal maze embedded in the lower layers of the gate's component matter. Is this the Pe layer of the Gate's structure? Is it this that Ramar's Essence is pulling upon, as the Gate tries to change the definition of "nearby" so that Creation is on one side of the portal and Yu-Shan is on the other?

Swirls of power harmonizing two points, Heaven and Earth, together dance before Ramar's eyes. As Essence wafts lightly through his Anima, his eyes widen with amazement... he feels his mind wandering the wispy halls of Essence, notices the power transforming the air, the ground, as it becomes Yu-Shan, and Yu-Shan becomes it...

And then the time for studying passes... and the power begins to fade. Ramar allows the last few motes of Essence to escape the gate, and quite harmlessly lights begin to dance about the gate and Ramar... he closes his eyes, then reopens them before the silent stone. "There... it is done... we shall begin again at Sunrise. Either rest or help me to gather this new information together..." Ramar pulls an old, weathered journal from his robes, and after shaking sand and salt from the cover, begins to scribe in Essence-laden ink the information he learned this night. "Sunrise, and Sunset. Those are the key times, I believe..."

Cloudburst draws out a fine book and looks to Ramar. "Dictate. I will record for you, and accurately," she says. The woman grins widely and gestures to her journal. She sets her pen to writing and says to it, "Begin recording what he says," she instructs calmly.

"There is one further thing that needs doing..." Muses Ramar. He turns to face the Gate once more. "I have a petition to file... and... an apology to offer." He gives a rueful little chuckle, "For my own foolishness. I am going. I shall be back soon... if you must leave, please, leave me a note of some kind, and if possible a Volo. I should not be too long, however." And with that, he begins channeling Essence once more. This time more consciously aware of how it interacts with the Gate, he is careful, and the casting is a little smoother, a little swifter. Soon, the Gate hums with power, and the way to Yu-Shan is open once more. Ramar steps through, disappearing into the mists. On the other side, he states his business to the Celestial Lions, and proceeds into Yu-Shan, making his way toward the Golden Barque's arrival and departure point once more...

En is waiting in his usual cabin, and greets Ramar formally once he receives permission to enter. "Well," he says, and with a gesture, a chair arrives, scooting across the floor again on its own.

Ramar bows his head before En. A folder of shimmering light is tucked under one arm. "As requested... I have brought the petition and the plans, and a petition, as well as documents of the notes we've taken so far... and there is one further thing." Ramar looks somewhat nervous, then he drops into a kneel, his body held humbly. "I have an apology for you. I feel I owe you one. When last I was here, I did not treat this matter seriously, and I feel I did not act as best as I could have. I was not respectful. For that, I apologize."

"Let me show you something," the architect says softly, and gestures to his bookshelf with his glass hand. A book flies easily into his grasp, and he lays it open, presenting it for inspection. Inside are not words, but pictures, and animated ones at that. "Behold," he directs.

Ramar stands up, and with his head tilted in that curious fashion, does as he is directed. The pictures as they move about capture his attention... "What..." he begins.

Through sparkling layers of light - thousands of them - pour a host of frightening shapes. They are monsters, it seems, and they are seething out of shimmering rectangular panes that all float in the air, forming an enormous circle around a beautiful crystalline city. The pictures of the book continue to move, and as Ramar watches, more and more of the portals - for they can be nothing else - can be seen opening. A million creatures out of nightmare are disgorged from their depths, and as they come, and come, and come, the eldritch defenses of the city slowly fall. Towers crumble, their delicate conical spires smashing into shards as they land on the city streets. People in panic run hither and yon, while the beleaguered defense forces of the city make half-hearted use of their Essence weapons and fire-blades to hold off the invaders.

"The city of Cel Sastraina, in the northwestern mountains," says En, softly. "Overthrown by Fair Folk shock troops, three thousand years before you were born. They made use of the city's own transport system, a centralized 'gate dispatch' device whose prototype was another two thousand years older. It could let people in and out of the city for hundreds of miles around, with proper authorization. It let the invaders past eight layers of finely-tuned defenses."

"I..." Ramar shakes his head. It will take him a moment or two to digest this information. He nods slowly as he makes his way out of the sheer horror the others in the city must surely have faced. "I understand... that is... that is something that must not be allowed to happen again..."

"You also understand why the gates to Yu-Shan are opened by sorcery," says En. "And why the Celestial Lions guard them. And why their locations are hidden." He waves his glass arm loosely, gesturing about him. "And why I am held here."

With a brevity that comes with a sudden, and unasked for enlightenment, Ramar replies as best as he can. "Yes." He tilts his head, regarding En once more... "What would you do, were things different?"

"I would not have built the damn things," is the quiet reply.

"So what will you do now?" Ramar turns his eyes to the pictures once more, then back to En, watching him. _He is trapped... perhaps in his own creations... most certainly by them._ "If I am permitted to ask."

"What will I do? I will continue to exist," the architect says. "And I will share my knowledge, at my discretion, with those who seek it."

"Thank you," the dreamer replies, "For sharing your knowledge with me." There is a brief pause as a silence settles. Although it is not an unwelcome one. After this has gone on for a few moments, Ramar will ask one thing further, "Would you be willing to share the ways to determine what special qualities an item has been imbued with?"

"Study it," suggests En. "Research it. You can no more get a menu of powers with trivial effort than you can learn what berries are safe to eat just by looking at them. It takes time and knowledge."

Ramar nods, "Of course. And trial, and error, and enough grit to survive the mistakes..." Ramar considers, "I shall have to make a habit of studying everything it seems." He'll take the folder, and offer it to En, "These are the plans so far... I hope that we have done well by them..."

The artificer receives the documents and begins leafing through them. "I will study these closely when I have time," he promises after a few pages, and sets the package down. A smile grows on his face. "But like every project, I trust the second version will have better success than the first." And as Ramar receives the silent social cue that the interview is over, he realizes that perhaps En is not speaking of successful projects, but successful people.

"Thank you," replies Ramar, bowing as he prepares to leave. "We shall see... I believe though, that you are correct." He smiles, bows once more, and then takes his leave of the architect, leaving him to his own devices. Ramar makes the last of his preparations in Yu-Shan, then once more leaves for Creation. _Let us hope that En is correct..._
