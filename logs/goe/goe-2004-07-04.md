# Gods of Eden 2004-07-04

Zetai Kalthazar, the patrician's son, and the Lady Arafein, depart the Imperial City at dawn. A sturdy horse-drawn carriage, its sides and interior decorated with the artistic motifs of the late fifth century, arrives at the front of the Zetai household to receive its passengers and four armsmen, and they are off in the hazy mist of morning. The curtain of thin fog parts as the carriage and those within and without pass beyond the city's boundaries and into the lush, richly green countryside of the Blessed Isle. Songbirds can be heard expressing their love of life, singing to the rising sun in exultant voices. The feather-light touch of wind through grass offers a subtle accompaniment for the aria of avian joy.

Kalthazar expects the trip to take no more than nine days; the horses are well-bred and well-fed, and the route is common enough that replacements are available in the major towns along the road. Along the way, the aristocrat introduces his guest to the wonders and the mysteries - and dangers - of his home.

On the second day, the road winds its way south past a great black obelisk, rising into the sky, surrounded on all sides by ruined black stone. In answer to inquiry, Kalthazar explains. "That is the Monument of the Twenty-Five," he explains. "Once it was used for astrology of some kind, but now it lies in ruins. Destroyed during the time before the Great Contagion." Every so often, the sight of stars can be seen flickering in the jet-black depths of the monument, despite the bright sunlight of day overhead.

The Lady Arafein studies all she sees with much interest, maintaining a pleasant conversation with Kalthazar as he drives. "Truly this is a place of peace and harmony," she says simply. "I don't think one can appreciate it without living outside how comfortable it is here." The monument draws her curiosity, of course. "It's safe to leave those ruins behind? Is it left like that for a reason?"

"They have posed no danger in seven centuries," smiles the patrician's son. "They are an object of study, certainly, and the masters of the Heptagram claim to understand their secrets. You, perhaps, would know about that better than I?" he adds, slyly referring to the source of the Lady's letter of recommendation. Such verbal fencing and mild efforts to draw out more details have been a reliable, if not constant, feature of the trip so far, and Gallius senses they are less deliberate than reflexive - the man is trained to seek out what is hidden; it is in his nature.

And the Lady Arafein is apparently more than able to deflect such inquiries. "I imagine I will hear far more from those studying it, then," she replies. "If my duties allow, at least. I will be quite busy with other tasks, I fear. I have little time for personal interests."

The fifth day is marred by the stains of violence. The carriage is intercepted on the road before noon, as Kalthazar and his guest are taking rice for their meal. Soldiers, stationed at the road, approach, present their credentials, and begin a short, quiet interaction with the coachman. At last word reaches the interior: a slave revolt, three miles to the east. The slaves are armed; a detachment of men from the Cathak legions is holding them off, but a detour is necessary.

"A pity, it seems there is trouble in paradise, as well," murmurs Arafein. "Are these common problems as of late? It seems the very social order of the world is turned on its ear."

"Unfortunately, yes," grumbles Kalthazar. "'When the heart is shackled by lawlessness, shackle the body by law' - Fruits of the Earth, XIV, 43," he says, quoting the Immaculate texts. "Men commit murder and rape, and so we enslave them for it as punishment. And then they rise up, and attack their guards and owners, and draw even peaceful slaves, who are treated well and slated for freedom, into their revolts. And those men commit murders and other crimes, and are turned over to masters far harsher than they deserved.." He shakes his head sadly. "If only those violent men knew what price they were forcing their more fortunate allies to pay.."

"Violent men shall be violent," replies Arafein. "And they may well delight in the fact that they are tormenting others in their madness." She frowns thoughtfully and shrugs, "So it seems that there is a darkness reaching even here. I wonder what shall come of it all."

"The Deliberative shall do nothing, as usual," grumbles Kalthazar, in a moment of political honesty. "I fear only the Great Houses are positioned to restore order. And even they fight. Though, to their credit," he adds, with a note of strong pride in his voice, "House Ragara has kept above the fray. And all must come to us eventually."

"But in the meantime.." Arafein sighs. "Strength is squandered on this bickering. Our enemies are hardly unaware of this. It would not surprise me if this forced delay is their doing. The enemies of Creation have grown very strong."

On the seventh day of the trip, as dusk falls, the carriage sits parked near a large tree whose bare and fire-blackened branches overhang the road. The horses are resting, the coachmen and armsmen are taking their own rice, and Kalthazar is showing Arafein the sight of the moon through a small, cylindrical telescope. "Watch how it rises over the top of the Imperial Mountain," he says, softly. "Watch along the slopes.. watch carefully. You might see movement."

The Lady looks, and as the moonlight contrasts the southern slope of the great mountain, she can see distant specks, tiny even with the aid of the telescope. They are as tiny as ants to her sight, if ants used beasts of burden and wagons scaled to their size. Kalthazar notes her attention, deducing that she has indeed seen the sight. "They are the Mountain Folk," he whispers. "Descendants of the Fair Folk who live within the Imperial Mountain. It is said that the Empress treated with them. But so few people ever see them working.. nobody really knows what they do there, aside from mining jade."

Arafein purses her lips and studies them carefully. "Most curious. I wonder how well they fulfill their duties now that the Empress is not looking over them." She watches for a few more moments and then hands the telescope back. "Another question for another time," she says simply. "So many little things can add up for serious trouble, I've found. And found the hard way."

The calm of the air is broken as the song of steel being drawn can be heard from all around the carriage. And without warning, a party of a dozen scruffy-looking men, some still with the steel manacles of slavery on their limbs, charge into the firelight of the carriage's camp. All are armed - some with the swords of the Cathak legions' soldiers, others with handmade or stolen spears. "Yer money and valuables!" bellows their apparent leader, speaking in the uncouth accents of a foreigner taught Low Realm at the end of a whip.

Odd as it may seem, the presence of bandits doesn't even ruffle the feathers of the Lady Arafein. She calmly notes, "Well, indeed paradise has fallen far these days. Apparently only the birds and trees remember." She looks at the leader of these bandits curiously, appearing for all the world as if she were waiting for them to impress her and expected to be disappointed.

One of the guards reaches for his blade; the bandits converge on him. And then, the sound of feet on bark can be heard, and a yell from overhead startles the carriage's people and the slave-bandits alike. A young man wearing jade bracers, one of which sports a sparkling oval Hearthstone of red-gold, leaps from the top of the tree hanging over the campsight. His clothes are of noble quality, though dirtied by hard travel. He lands in the midst of the bandits, and in a flash of limbs three fall over before they can complete the curses on their lips. The agile young man drops into a low fighting stance that Gallius recognizes - the Five Dragon Style, the least of the martial arts practiced by the Dragon-Blooded - and gestures insouciantly at the bandits, inviting them to attack.

The remaining nine raise their weapons - and the Caste Mark of the young Exalt flashes into life, putting the bright pit-fire to shame. As one the remaining men throw down their arms, turning and running with desperation. The Terrestrial vaults and rolls along the ground, flashing out a hand in mid-roll to seize a spear; as he comes up, righting himself on his feet, his momentum aids the spear in taking flight from his arm. He casts it easily, and in the distant dark, the gurgle of a dying bandit can be heard. Rising, he dusts himself off, turning to survey the travelers with a rakish grin. To Arafein his eyes immediately go, and he offers a low, sweeping bow, demonstrating precisely the degree of respect owed to the station Gallius has assumed. The bow is broken only as he lashes out with one foot behind him, to disable one of the bandits who thought to crawl toward his fallen sword. "I trust my lady will forgive these ruffians for interrupting her dinner," he says.

Lady Arafein nods politely to the man who has prevented her from wasting a lot of time explaining certain things. "I think we can just refer to it as entertainment," she says simply. She sets aside the food and rises to curtsey more properly, "My name is Lady Arafein, my Lord. Thank you for your timely assistance. Perhaps you might join us?"

"A moment, I beg you," the young man says with a bright smile. As the glow of his Caste Mark recedes, he collects the weapons thrown down by the fleeing men, placing them safely away from the three half-conscious bandits. "Be on your way!" he shouts at them. "You're free - if you don't fall in with the wrong sort of man again," he adds, gesturing out into the night, hinting at the fallen man he speared. The three manage to collect their wits, nodding their assent and gratitude and making a dash for it. Only then does the Terrestrial approach the camp. Kalthazar, performing his lifelong role, steps up, bowing low. "My lord," he says, formally. "May I present the Lady Arafein of Harborhead." And turning, he gestures, just as politely, to the young man. "Lady Arafein, I have the honor of presenting Mnemon Nepel." A strange ceremony, this, in the middle of a darkened road, but dignity must always have its place.

Lady Arafein nods to the formalities, though they are somewhat trying as of late. "Mnemon Nepel, it is a pleasure to make you acquaintance," she says with a smile. "It is a rather curious circumstance, but at least this journey has not been uneventful." Her words and expression make it clear she's actually been amused by this most recent display.

Taking a seat, Nepel makes himself comfortable on the bare earth near the fire. "And I should challenge a hundred bandits, or a thousand, for the beauty and charm presented to me," he says, offering the Lady a roguish smile. "Perhaps the Lady is in need of better sorts of events?"

The Lady is quiet for a time, a small smile on her lips as she considers this man. "I wouldn't mind a change in pace from the slave uprisings and wandering bandits," she replies casually. "The Isle is not exactly as I anticipated," she adds as an afterthought.

"Perhaps you need a guide better versed in the pleasures of the Isle," he suggests with a wink, and Kalthazar makes quiet choking sounds under his breath as he struggles to maintain his composure. Of course, the man can say nothing, but Nepel is nothing if not observant. "In any event, my lady," he says as he rises to his feet. "I may again hear the happy sighs of men smitten by your countenance, and follow the light of the moon itself that shines jealously on your beauty, and perhaps by these things we may meet again. But until then, my lady, master Zetai, I must take my leave." And with that he leaps upward, attaining a branch of the old tree, and from there he disappears into the night.

Lady Arafein arches an eyebrow as the martial artist leaps away. "Well, Master Kalthazar, I feel quite comfortable in your hands," she says simply. She has no plans on ruffling anyone's feathers unless they need ruffling. "This has been a pleasant adventure thus far, in any case. Soon I'll have nothing but work to do once more." Which is true enough.

The patrician just shakes his head. "I'd heard of that man," he grumbles. "My Lady, if you run into that man again, and do not have a husband already, my suggestion is that you get one."

Arafein laughs softly, "I imagine with such practiced lines he has wound a few ladies around his fingers." She seems untroubled, though. Comparing her beauty to Luna? Remarkably foolish, even here. "In any case, I hope these distractions have not added too much distance and time."

On the tenth day, the carriage arrives at the outskirts of the land owned by the Cloister of Wisdom. It is a hilly, wooded area, with a long river running through the valleys of the center, forking and re-joining in places. Soldiers come forward to inspect the carriage and its occupants. Kalthazar's presence is enough for them, and the carriage rattles on, slowly ascending the hill-road.

The Cloister of Wisdom is a set of buildings, spread across an entire valley. Without exception they are intricately crafted, equal to a Manse in beauty and form. Stone and wood and glass combine in these monumental works of architectural art. From the hilltop where the carriage parks a moment, Kalthazar indicates the function of each. The largest single building is the Convent, a great building at the center, where the students live. To the west, furthest from the river, is the Cathedral, where the Immaculate priests and their functionaries live and work and have their being. The Coliseum, where the fighting arts are taught and re-taught, is opposite it, nearly on the edge of the Sionin River that flows through this valley. Other, smaller buildings are present as well - a dining hall, separate buildings for each of the five elements in which classes are taught, and the Observation Tower, which is set apart and located on a nearby hilltop. Even now Arafein can see the light of the heliograph, as the Tower uses its signal-fire to announce the carriage's presence to watchmen below.

The carriage descends to park in front of one of the imposing buildings, and Kalthazar exits, escorting Arafein. They enter the carven double doors, and the patrician speaks to a robed woman who comes forward and bows politely. She leads the way, and the three soon find themselves in an office, delicately appointed with sculpture and paintings depicting pastoral scenes and plants.

The office is that of a woman, a handsome female of apparent middle age, who wears an elaborately-decorated robe, who sits reclining on a divan, studying a book. She rises langorously, smiling. "Zetai Kalthazar," she says, in a husky voice. The man steps forward, presenting himself with a low bow, and gestures behind him. "Directrix," he says. "May I present the Lady Arafein, of Harborhead." And stepping aside, he permits the Lady to speak for herself.

The Lady Arafein curtseys deeply. "It is an honor to meet you," she says formally. "And a joy to finally have arrived at last," she adds.

"You are a guest of our friend, and yet.." The Directrix tilts her head, then rises. She stands a mere five feet in height, but her presence is powerful - she is a woman accustomed to discipline, order, and leadership. It is not the self-assured fearlessness of a general; it is the calm, implacable strength of a teacher of Exalts, and Vanda, the black monk, possessed this same quality. "You are not from the Isle, nor from any of its families, I think.. How may I be of assistance to you, Arafein?"

"As you no doubt have learned, things in Harborhead have recently changed," begins Lady Arafein, and by her tone the change would seem to not be to her pleasure. "And now I have found my circumstances quite altered. I understand the Cloister might have a place for someone in a situation like mine."

"I see," murmurs the Directrix. Arafein senses that this is the moment for the letter of introduction from the master at the Heptagram, and she presents it. The school's matron accepts this gracefully, reading it with thoroughness and patience. She sets it aside once finished, and smiles again. "I see," she says, and this time the tone is different - where before, she implied, 'I realize your wish', now her voice carries the hidden subtext of 'I realize why I should help you'. "Arafein, one of our attendants will get you settled in. I would like you to come to my office again at the ringing of the morning bell, and we shall speak further." Another woman enters, a functionary of the Cloister, and makes silent offer to escort the Lady out. Kalthazar makes no move; it's obvious the Directrix will pump him for information about the new arrival once she's absent.

---

Three days have passed. The Directrix has appointed Arafein a small room in the Convent, and new clothes. Her plain robes are simple, homespun, and made at the Cloister itself. Girls and boys alike are punished for disobedience by duties such as weaving, spinning, chopping firewood and collecting and boiling river-water. The Lady herself must help with some of these duties as well, to support her position at the Cloister, and it is through talking with some of the disobedient students that she learns more about the secondary school.

Ragara Calel Chandra, the girl she is here to meet, is known to some. They describe her as cool, calm, analytical and very bright, though Gallius can sense that the students hold back from speaking with a somewhat older woman, even one who does the same lowly chores as they.

It is afternoon of the fourth day when she can finally locate Chandra. Out in the gardens, where the school grows its medicinal and recreational herbs, Gallius creeps quietly, for here is where rumor places Chandra after the lunch hour. Finally, the sound of a girl crying reaches her ears, and she rounds one of the high stone walls that separate the sections of the garden to prevent cross-seeding. A girl rests on a stone bench. Her pale hair is almost white, and her simple dress is stained with the fertile soil of the garden from the knees down. She rubs her red eyes, mopping tears from them, though uselessly.

Lady Arafein pauses at the sight of the weeping girl, but if what she has heard is correct, this must be the very one she seeks. Even as she moves closer she draws out a scarf, one of the few fine things she has from her former station and holds it out as an offering, "What has you in tears, my dear?" she asks softly.

The girl half jumps out of her skin, startled by the arrival. A few weepy moments pass as she sizes up the new arrival, then a trembling hand reaches for the scarf and accepts it. As she wets it down with newly-shed tears, she shakes her head and sniffs. "You're.. Lady Arafein.. of Harborhead," she manages in a weak voice, trying hard to regain some measure of dignity before the new arrival. "Ragara.. Calel...Chandra.. at your service," she manages, a sniffle punctuating every word. "Please forgive me.."

"There is nothing to forgive, my Lady," says Arafein. "Is there anything I can do to help you?" She looks about for a moment, to be certain that there is no one else to cause trouble.

The garden seems isolated but for these two. Chandra shakes her head quickly, wiping away her tears with the scarf. It seems the presence of an observer is enough to quell the stream, and she sighs, rubbing her eyes a moment and returning the scarf to its owner with a shaky hand. "I... I'm afraid I got something in my eye," she says lamely, and manages a smile. "Please don't be concerned. I was just working among the _yao cha_ herbs.." But she lacks the conviction of truth.

Lady Arafein gives the girl a most knowing look and arches an eyebrow.

"Have you ever heard of the phrase, baring to the blade?" asks Arafein softly. "When one says they are baring to the blade, the only way to insult them is to lie," she says casually. "Perhaps I might give you advice on how best to handle those herbs, so as to avoid future problems with your eyes, but I will of course need some further information to be of assistance," Arafein says, leaving her companion to waltz around the truth without making the entire encounter pointless.

"'The true treasure of the house is seen by six eyes'," quotes Chandra quietly, rallying herself somewhat - the eyes she speaks of are those of a man, his wife, and his best friend, as Gallius recalls the old texts from her own highborn education. "But the herbs here are no treasure, so I don't mind talking about them.." She smiles a little. "Thank you for your concern.. umm.. you've only recently arrived.. Can I show you the garden, Lady?"
