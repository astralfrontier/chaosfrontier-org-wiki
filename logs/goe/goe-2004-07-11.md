# Gods of Eden 2004-07-11

Chi-Yosh steps onto the elevator, drawing him up into the belly of Nane. It has been a month since the trip to the City of Dreams, and while the Circle has been preoccupied with its' exploits, the newest Solar has spent her time under the care of The Master. For a month now, unaswered questions have found the Dawn; what memories does Sun-and-Moon have of the first age? What is her plans now, as an Exalt? For that matter, who is she, beyond the daughter of a miner, and the barer of Lesell's spark? What of her Caste mark, changed from her Spark's original? The Fisher could possibly have found that answer, but he has been preoccupied with matters for the Nation more pressing than this simple thought. Chi-Yosh starts down the halls of Nane, seeking to find his own answers.

Sun-and-Moon is receiving instruction in the manners of the spirit world; the Master is teaching, quietly, reclining on a couch with his eyes closed. The faint smell of incense wafts down the corridors of his sanctum, drawing Chi-Yosh in to observe the proceedings. When the lesson stops, the Master rises, shaking off the drugged dream that held him for a time, and gestures to the doorway in which the Solar waits. "A visitor," he tells Sun-and-Moon, who turns to inspect her guest.

Chi-Yosh, when he is acknowledged, affords the Master and his pupil a bow of greeting. "I have a tale to tell you, Master, of Cademius. But it can wait for later." He smiles towards Sun-and-Moon. "Would you care to take a walk?"

The warm afternoon leaves the gardens filled with butterflies and the occasional bumbling of bees, but other than stray gardeners and children, walking paths within the fortress are left bare. "The Master is a good teacher," begins the Dawn as he regards the sun-bathed path before them. "But he is one who offers a map, but no destinations. This must be still fresh to you, but what lanes of Creation appeal to you yet?"

"I... I have never known anything but the mines," the young woman says. "Even to talk of another kingdom has been strange. But Creation? Everything that exists? I don't know."

"You do not need to know where you want to go," assures Chi-Yosh. "But, do you have an idea of what you want to do, when you arrive where you are going?"

"I.... " Again the girl shakes her head. "Ever since..all this happened, I've thought again and again about my friends in the mines, and the people there, and.. All I can think of is how they are doing. But now, here, I wonder, who else lived like that? Do most people exist like that? I want to find out. I want to stop it."

Chi-Yosh says, "Tell me of the mines. Of how your friends lived, why there was the revolt. Then we can see what became of the actions of your friends in need."

Sun-and-Moon thinks as she walks. "The mines were all that I and my people knew," she says. "The overseers were our priests. We were taught that the sun was a vile demon, and that Hell was up. We never dug in that direction. But the overseers were cruel, and unjust. My father was a seer and a wise man. He told us many stories. He told us of places far off, where the people were happy... My best friend was killed, before you found me, by the overseers, because she refused the advances of one of them. And so.. I'd had enough. I got the miners with me to rise up.." She draws a finger to her eye, wiping away a salty tear.

"There are places elsewhere like this. Strife and happiness, suffering and content living are layers over the lands. Even here in the Hundred Kingdoms, there are harsher territories than others. It is part of the Nation's cause to end this; our expansion was first to remove the cruelest of leaders." Tales of the Deathlords and the Fae are left out, for now - they are the wolves upon mankind, but even the Circle is not powerful enough to contest them yet.

"Then I want to aid in that effort," murmurs Sun-and-Moon, sounding for a moment like an older version of herself. She has matured, in some ways, and at some times

"Keep this in mind then. Mention it to the Master. He can give you the tools to begin this path. When he can not, we can." With that, Chi-Yosh lets the silence stretch, for a time. Finally, "You can only remember the mines in this life. Do you remember anything of others?"

Sun-and-Moon misinterprets the question. "Other mines? No, but we thought that others must be out there, like underground cities.." Then she realizes what is actually meant, and touches her forehead experimentally. "You mean, other..lives, don't you. No, I'm afraid I don't really, though I have had strange dreams."

The Su'Katan tilts his head. "Would you share them?"

"I dream of a great tree," she half-whispers. "It is a mile high. It holds dreams, and it makes them real. I dream that its leaves have a face, and every one of those faces is mine.."

Chi-Yosh stares off across the small field. It is possibly unhealthy for him to try and mine the links to Lesell from Sun-and-Moon, but that does not mean he cannot introduce her to the spoils of her past. Prowler... is for far in the future, for the fledgling Solar need not worry about it. But, there are other places to go. "Sometimes, dreams may come true."

"The tree has plagued my dreams since the City," she continues. "It means something. But I do not know what.." Shaking her head, Sun-and-Moon turns away. "You all have treated me like something special, ever since I met you," she says at last.

"You are our sister. You are the daughter of Helios, who binds us together under his light. Each member of a family is special, and as time come closer, we will need eachother all the more."

"Then what is it you hide from me?" the girl asks, turning, her eyes flashing with the impatient perceptiveness of another existence.

Chi-Yosh smiles to himself. The trick to talking with the Eclipse. "There are things your past self has done, that I don't wish to bother you with yet. You have seen the worst of it - the City is the crown jewel of horror. But the one who's hand put her down still lives, and he has never recovered from it."

"Who do you speak of?" the voice asks again. Behind Sun-and-Moon's eyes lurks something else, a sign of dangerous intelligence and questing curiosity.

Chi-Yosh watches the depths of those eyes, hunting for recognition from the cunning beneath. "Erisus."

The woman behind Sun-and-Moon's eyes seems to fade; the girl frowns. "This is.. the man who murdered me in a ... past life?" she asks, sounding confused and isolated.

"An act of mercy; you saw what she had wrot with the fallen power. He has never recovered from the loss of Lesell, and his actions that brought them." Looking back over the flowers. "I hoped introducing you to him would help him."

"Now you speak truth," says the girl's voice, sounding older again. "Take me to him." The voice does not brook disobedience, nor suffer idleness.

"Very well. But first, I have something else to show you."

---

For the third time, the villagers of the Su'Katan marvel at the wonders that are the flying machines. This time, it is an alabaster bird-man with great wings. And for the third time, Chi-Yosh has returned with visitors. But for the first time through those eyes, Sun-and-Moon beholds the great tree that rises from the heart of the people, from their very being.

"A tree here, too," murmurs the girl, spying the village's most notable feature. "To think that something I'd only heard stories of should mean so much.." She smiles faintly. "Your people live here?"

"Yes. There was a cult that followed Lesell faithfully. They were joined by travelers from the north, that created this village. But the tree... it is something powerful, something that links all of us to it."

The girl nods slowly. "The faithful," she whispers. She walks ahead, then puts a small hand on the bark of the tree. "Its roots watered by their blood, its leaves carrying their souls, just as the old tree did.."

Chi-Yosh stands just behind, following the great trunk into its' mighty limbs. "The soil rich with their bones. It is the most sacred thing to us still. Details fade, but the beliefs..." His words trail off. It feels odd, being of the village that worships the tomb before him, speaking to the incarnate of the one entombed within.

The hand on the tree withdraws. "No, it's different. This tree is just a pale shadow," whispers the Solar girl. "The ghosts slumber. The tree has almost no power at all. Its spirit is weak.." She turns. "I remember something of what happened here," she says at last, in a hushed voice.

Chi-Yosh's alarmed. Weak? Almost no power? But the souls, the linked souls within? "How do you ..." The demand for understanding, the glimmer to revitalize the tree vanishes at her words. Leaning forward, he's entranced with the prospect of knowledge once lost.

Sun-and-Moon witnesses her companion's face. "Compared to the old tree? This one grew out of Lesell's desire alone. It has none of the power her wisdom could impart.." She shakes her head. "A fitting monument. May the old soul rest in peace, content with the icon of its reign.." Her voice is the 'old' one.

The girl turns, walking east, away from the village. "There is something else here, something near," she says over her shoulder.

Chi-Yosh is at the woman's side, keeping close. His heart picks up. Since his Exaltation, so much of the village has come into perspective. Some of it opens his eyes to the terrible time that brought the Usurption, while more merely shines light on the myth and mystery, a light that could only be granted by the sun.

Three hours later, the two Solars are deep in the woods. "Here," Sun-and-Moon says suddenly, pausing at the edge of a cliff. She points downward, into the forested bowl. Then upward, at the sky, where clouds do not gather - but only over this place. "Here is where the Wyld was brought down, and here--"

"-- here is where Lesell met her end," adds another voice. It is Erisus, called Weeping Prowler by some, and he approaches from within the woods. The Lunar is wearing his human form, dressed in his blue robe, and he makes a perfunctory nod of introduction. "Hail, Prince of the Earth," he says to Chi-Yosh.

Chi-Yosh stills at the sound of Erisus's voice, initial surprise melting into understanding. It's no coincidence the two would be drawn, for Fate is ever a web that binds. He returns the nod, civily returning "Well met, No Moon." Though the Su'Katan steps back, well aware that he is merely a spectator for what shall commense, that which he has been hoping for hanging just in sight. Now, it is a matter of seeing if the fire will burn, or go out, when it is offered such precious wood.

Sun-and-Moon, and the Lunar, look at each other for long seconds, silently probing the other - but for what? Weakness? Identity? The Solar warrior studies the wordless exchange of information, and remembers to draw breath as Sun-and-Moon speaks. She bows low, following some half-glimpsed instinct. "We come in peace to what must be your territory, sir," she says, and Erisus raises an eyebrow. "I am Sun-and-Moon, Chosen of Helios, of the.." She hesitates, and Chi-Yosh can read the recollection of the underground experience at the tree on her face. "Of the Eclipse Caste." To which Erisus simply nods, then glances at Chi-Yosh, his eyes hunting for explanation.

Chi-Yosh does not have the answers. The Dawn's speculation is as good as the Lunar's own. This is written plain on his face, though there is a promise in his eyes, one that a teacher would recognize in the gaze of a student who is determined to understand the _why_ of the lesson, just as much as the _what_.

The Lunar glances from face to face, then a faint smile crosses his face. "Well," he says. "While you are both here, let me tell you a story." And he steps closer to the cliff, sitting and letting his legs dangle over the edge. "Come, sit," he invites.

While the others join him, Erisus continues. "Centuries ago, I fought with a Solar named Lesell. She was a good queen, and wise, but she eventually went mad. And when those who would strike her down had come, she escaped. And here..." He spreads out a hand, indicating the crater. "In this place, the Wyld raged. I brought it down, a counter for her sorcery, in the days when I still thought the powers of the Wyld could be shaped to my purposes. Sorcery and chaos were my weapons. And in the end, Lesell fell. But she was not yet beaten."

"We had discussed the nature of the Exaltation and the interactions between it and the spark," continued Erisus, "in the time before the Usurpation proper. We considered the Wyld itself as a weapon. We thought it would tend to diffuse the power of the Exaltation, and the power of an angry ghost, and we were right. We fled to the Wyld after, thinking it a refuge." He draws a hand to his own brow. "It corrupted our sparks. Made us Casteless at first. The same has been done to.. to you, Sun-and-Moon."

Chi-Yosh listens in silence, digesting this. It fits with what he understands of the Lunar's history, and the answer is possibly more apt than what could be found in Heaven. Though, as he watches Erisus's face, something occurs to him: the man is smiling. Genuine, and more than he had ever seen Weeping Prowler do. It is still too early to guess the effect of this meeting upon the Lunar's disposition, but in all things, there is always hope.

"Well," the Lunar says, in that way that signals departure. "I came because I perceived the arrival of an airship, and none have interest in that village but you, and those connected to it.." His eyes stray to the girl but he continues. "Come to my mansion, and you may both hear more stories of the old time, if you wish."

Chi-Yosh shares a glance with the Eclipse, before turning back to the elder Lunar. "We would be delighted to be your guest once more."
