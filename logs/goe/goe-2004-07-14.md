# Gods of Eden 2004-07-14

Since speaking with Chandra, Lady Arafein has spent most of her time working on a way to meet Linus. Bringing him here seems unlikely, but she does try to see if he has any relatives among the people living here. Getting to him will be difficult, but with work it might be possible to achieve it. The Lady's first attempt will involve getting in touch with the amusing man who helped her on the way to the Cloister. Nepel was useful, if a bit strange, and right now Lady Arafein has few friends of any use to her.

The Lady Arafein speaks to those at the school, asking around for one who could send a letter to Nepel. The letter is written with care. Nothing too straight-forward, just a sign of gratitude with a clearly written hope to see him soon. The spilling of perfume on the note is of course purely intentional. Every little hint to make him remember will help, the lady tells herself.

---

The girl who helped Arafein giggled and blushed when Nepel's name was mentioned, as though there was something about the man that set her heart beating fast - but Gallius also senses a wanting or yearning. Whatever this girl has done with Nepel, or rather not done, she senses that the young man has been a complete gentleman in his dealings.

A day later, as the fires of the sun flicker out behind the horizon, the Lady is met in the garden. Nepel is waiting for her, casually leaning up against one wall as he studies the blue-gold berries that grow from the _ha la natha_ vine. He pushes forward off it, coming fully to his feet and gives a low, gracious bow. "The moon rises as the sun sets, I see," he says with a rakish smile, eyeing the face of his companion in the twilight.

"So it sometimes happens," answers Lady Arafein. "You come swiftly, Master Nepel," she adds more quietly. "Perhaps you know of a more quiet place we might talk?" She smiles apologetically at her own haste, but she wants to make it quite clear that she isn't calling him here to waste his time with sighs and starry eyed looks. At least, she hopes he'd consider that a waste of his time.

The young man gestures with a smile. "This way," he suggests, and makes his way through the garden. Nepel leads the way, stopping at intervals and holding up a hand for silence, then continuing. He makes it safely to the storage-cellar of the Cathedral, and Gallius realizes what he's been doing: dodging the observers who act as unseen sentinels for the school. He must have their pattern memorized.

"My greatest secret," he whispers, conspiratorially, and moves to a large box in one corner. Prying the top off, he climbs inside, then puts his hand up over the edge and beckons Arafein to follow. The box is a front, leading into a low tunnel illuminated by "fire-stones": another product of Terrestrial alchemy and sorcery. "A secret escape route for the faculty here," he explains in a whisper as he moves. "With magical wards in place, designed to detect any unauthorized intruders... put in place by House Mnemon's greatest sorcerers, of course." And so saying, Mnemon Nepel gives a jaunty grin and sneaks down the tunnel. The other end is on the opposite side of the hill, where a carriage is waiting, and Nepel assists his companion in climbing in.

Lady Arafein laughs softly, nodding at the very, very elaborate escape route. "Does your House regularly steal people from the Cloister using this route, then?" she asks, unable to help but tease the man. "I am very grateful, of course. It solves a few problems and answers many questions of mine all at once." In fact, her biggest problem may already be handled right now.

"Steal people? Never," says Nepel, in faux-outrage. Then his smile softens. "Though I admit I have come here in the past, to visit a particularly lovely flower in the garden.. " One need not guess what flowers he speaks of. Nevertheless, there's a suggestion of hesitation, but not shame. "Many appreciate poetry readings," he says, and the smile is present again.

The Lady smiles and laughs once more, "I certainly do enjoy poetry, though I have rarely had the chance to indulge lately." She considers Nepel for a moment, weighing him with her eyes patiently. "For all your attempts, you are hardly a rogue," she asserts quite simply. "Perhaps you would like to help me write a love poem involving a sad child in the Cloister and a young man who as of yet is not yet known to me. Though in time he will be, if you are willing to help."

"I will do whatever I can to help," promises Nepel, and in that statement, Gallius can feel what underlies his rake's nature: a sense of honor. He woos girls because it is the pride of a gentleman to make a lady feel loved and wanted, not to gratify one or more desires he might possess.

---

The carriage makes it to Wine River in little more than four days, and Gallius learns why: Nepel's horses are wearing horseshoes of alloyed jade, giving them incomparable endurance and ground speed. The city is indeed built along a river that courses through the low mountains of the Blessed Isle. From a distance, it's a shining jewel nestled in the grassy highlands; closer up, it becomes many glittering jewels, for the wealth of the city is on prominent display everywhere.

Lady Arafein is quite impressed. Four days, so many miles covered. And never once an attempt by Nepel to place his hand anywhere it shouldn't be. The man's reputation hides a very good heart. As she imagined since she first met him. She will let him lead the way to Linus. After that.. it will likely be up to her once more.

Nellens Chenault Linus can be found at his father's house, a palatial mansion adjoining the harbor. Though it lacks some of the truly impressive architectural flourishes and occult barriers that declare the home of an Exalt, the family is obviously quite wealthy. Nepel presents himself at the door, the Lady in tow (after an hour's refreshment at a local inn, and a change of clothes for them both). The servant escorts the pair inside, but they don't get past the front room when Linus himself comes down the stairs, trying hard and succeeding - for the most part - in masking his excitement.

Gallius can see the makings of a fine man in him. His eyes, in particular, draw the attention, and they seem familiar somehow. Perhaps he has relatives she's met before. Nevertheless, she listens as Nepel begins to speak. "Nellens Chenault Linus, from House Mnemon I bring you greetings," he says with a smile, and Linus abases himself as a proper mortal ought. Once he's risen, the tension seems to fade; perhaps these two know each other? "I've come to offer you a bride," he says with a smile. Linus' only response is to turn and regard the Lady Arafein. "Is she well-bred?" he asks, his eyes studying her face.

Lady Arafein studies the young man as studiously in turn. She offers him a curtsey and can't help but grin to herself. "You can rest assured she is quite well-bred," the Lady replies, her tone rather wry. She will clarify, but only after a bit of a pause. "I am not the one, and she is not my sister or daughter, so you need not study me too closely. Though if you wish to continue.." She clearly finds it quite amusing.

"Come in, come in," offers Linus with a languid smile. He leads the way to a well-appointed study; drinks are already prepared. Linus sits last, playing the polite host, while Nepel takes a slow sip from the glass before him. "I am interested to hear your story," says Linus, eyes focused on Arafein.

Lady Arafein pauses for a moment, studying the eyes of her host before she begins to tell the tale of her arrival on the island and on meeting Lady Chandra. She explains that she was given a task to help arrange a marriage and that those suggested to her were Linus and Chandra. She cannot say just who sent her, though she does say they are the kind that usually trust such tasks to others who are more able than she is.

Arafein goes on to tell Linus that, as she told Chandra, she has her own goals. She wants her work to make the couple happy, and to make their lives better. She makes it clear through her bearing and words that she is likely far more than she seems, speaking of those she explained as superiors previously appear to only be temporarily in such a position. The calm command of a queen seems to be something Gallius will have no matter what name she puts on.

Linus listens carefully to all this, masking his feelings as any good highborn of the Realm does. He is still human, and so he still has emotions; he is un-Exalted, and so cannot hide them as well as the Chosen. There is interest, but is it that he wishes to marry, or that he's simply interested in a potential mate? Gallius' experience with the Dynasty suggests that a patrician would be eager for the chance to marry an Exalt; Linus possesses that trait, it seems.

At length the patrician folds his hands over his lap. "An interesting proposal indeed," he says with a smile. "I shall speak with my father about it at the first opportunity." But Gallius can again sense something on his part, a hesitation or reluctance. He wants to examine the situation personally, it seems.

"I see you are not going to leap into this without some thought," says Lady Arafein. "A wise decision, I would say. These things are serious and not to be taken lightly, and not on something as weak as the word of another, no matter their reputation. Perhaps you would like to meet the Lady and see her with your own eyes?" Since the Lady has no doubt already offended the Cloister once, she might as well do so again.

"I'll consider it," says Linus with a gentle smile. "Call upon me tomorrow, and I'll have an answer for you."

---

Over the course of the afternoon, Nepel and Arafein witness no less than four female callers to the Chenault household. "He's got it, he does," observes Nepel around a mouthful of steamed rice and beef, as he sits in his carriage with the Lady, and indicates who he means with a gesture of his chopsticks. "Look at that. Women love him. What's his secret?"

"He does have it," murmurs Lady Arafein, and her face is far from approving. "You know this man well, Nepel?" she asks. "I will not send Chandra to stand beside a man of flawed virtues," she says flatly. "And should the man I select fail to keep her happy and show her honor, his thread in the web will be painfully extracted."

"I know a little," the Terrestrial responds with a smile, taking another bite of his food. "I met him several times, when he was courting my sister." He pauses for a moment, performing a monumental mental geneological effort. "Sorry. My half-sister, once removed, on my first mother's side. He's honorable enough - he keeps his affections for mortal girls, but he won't dishonor an Exalted woman. Very keen on advancing himself."

The Lady frowns in thought, "Perhaps, but will he love her? Will she love him?" Lady Arafein mutters under her breath, "The fools would suggest two who probably won't work." More clearly, she inquires, "Are there others of his house at about the same age who might be available for this sort of arrangement, Nepel?"

"Hah!" laughs the Chosen. "Probably dozens. All of 'em carefully managed by their parents, if they're Exalted, and the rest hungry for a foot in the door. Now, what Linus there has, that they lack, is charm. An Exalted girl won't waste her time with a man who grovels at her feet by imperial decree. But Linus doesn't do that. At least, he never did while I was around."

"Nepel, there is something about Linus that seems.. odd to me," suggests Lady Arafein. "His eyes are somehow different, as if he were seeing things beyond what others possibly can. And yet you say he is no Exalt." She frowns in thought, "It is a strange puzzle. He has some ability, it seems. Perhaps he simply knows just what to say, and when to say it?" Could he truly be a Sidereal?

"I'm sure he's no Exalt. Give me a library and a little time and I can trace his family bloodline," Nepel says with a smile. "Though what a boring way to spend time. Perhaps I can learn more.. should I go meet those disappointed girls coming out of his house?" He actually does make a motion to open the carriage door and leave, but something checks him, and he settles back into his seat a moment later. "Ah, but that would be deserting my lovely companion," he says with a smile.

Lady Arafein laughs softly and shakes her head, "I do not think that would work for us. I wonder, though.. there are things other than the children of the Dragons with strange powers. Some are good, and some are evil. Perhaps I should simply go to him alone and find out for myself. It would settle matters quite well." It might also get her killed, she imagines.

After darkness falls, the Lady Arafein begins what is the culmination of a feverish day of work. In front of her is large brazier, burning with the heat of white coals. In either of her hands are fine bracelets, their jewels shining in the dim light of the coals like mirrors to the stars. The Lady herself kneels, her eyes closed and her face turned towards Jupiter. Her prayer for assistance begins in a soft song, and as the words unwind the need of the hour, Arafein offers up the gems, one by one to be seen by Jupiter. Each gem is then cast into the consuming coals.

The song grows in strength and clarity, until the Lady has made clear her prayers to the heavens, at which point both bracelets are cast to the coals in offering. Finally, as the wind grows still around the Solar, her voice turns to silence and she waits to be answered.

Across the waters of the lake that pools the Wine River, a bird stirs, flaps its wings, and takes off. And from out of the night, a slight cough can be heard. "What is it you need?" a voice says, in low tones.

Lady Arafein turns to consider just who has been sent before she speaks. "I have seen eyes like those on Linus before," she says simply. "But never on a mortal. Nor even on a Dragon-Blooded Exalt. Only Sidereals have had eyes like that," she explains. "Yet he reveals nothing, seems to know nothing, and the thought that he might be somehow unknown to that order is.. highly unlikely, don't you agree? But yet it surely seems he is, though it is impossible as far as I can tell."

"You're ..." The voice pauses, and a man steps into view. He is old, with almost-white hair: a sign of great age, among the Sidereals. How many centuries has he seen? "You are mistaken," he says at last, his starry eyes glittering in the fire of the prayer-fires as he draws near. "Chenault Linus is the mortal scion of a Great House, nothing more. We examined him ourselves."

"Then why does he have the eyes of a Sidereal?" asks Lady Arafein. "And how can I be positive? What if we are all being tricked? What if some other hand is at work here?" The Solar frowns in thought, "What could the possible gain be? Always I turn and see new enemies, as if the two I am made to face are not enough! Something strange is happening here, and considering that this is the very center of order in all of Creation, it troubles me all the more."

The elder spreads his hands. "Perhaps here, where you fear the Bronze Faction's hand the most, you are ready to see something that is not there in the eyes of a young man whom you are already inclined to dislike," he suggests. "But whatever the truth, you have told us your perception and we have told you ours. What do you wish to happen now?"

"I do not dislike this young man," answers Lady Arafein. "And I do not fear the Bronze Faction here. A pledge was made that they would never break. You can tell me nothing else of use? Hmm, perhaps you might yet. What was the last time the Sidereals were wrong? What was the last time your foresight failed to protect Creation in this long turning of years?"

The elder shakes his head. "Sidereal insight has failed, it is true. Creatures exist that are outside of Fate; their influence can corrupt unfolding history. The Exalted can re-weave the skein of destiny at times, endangering our foresights. But barring such interference, our predictions are under-informed, but not misinformed."

"And what of my presence here?" asks Lady Arafein. "Is that not a serious source of interference on its own?" She shakes her head slightly, knowing the question need not be answered. "So I have something that has the look of the Sidereals. A look that I've seen in no other place. And the Sidereals themselves don't know about it. How long does it usually take for your people to find one of the Chosen of the Maidens?"

"Days. Perhaps a few weeks," the elder replies, slowly. "This Linus, I assure you, is not _ronin_ - not a solitary Exalt."

"So if it had just happened," says Lady Arafein, "Would you be able to sense it? Or how do you learn of it, simply by reading the weave of fate itself?" Since she made the effort, she might as well learn something of use. "I could sense no deception about him. The only thing that might make sense is if he were exalting now. I suppose your Exaltation is less flamboyant than that of my people."

The man thinks carefully. "Yes, he could be a recent Exalt. We have stayed away from this business, trusting you to handle it. But there is another possibility..." He reflects, then speaks again. "You are aware of the God-blooded." To a dweller of the Threshold, this is not a question. All know of the amazing children of mortal man and spiritual being, when the essence of divinity is passed on to a child. "It is possible that he inherits some trait of the divine without being Exalted himself."

"Are you suggesting that it is possible for something of what we are can be passed-on like this and not surface save in small ways?" asks Lady Arafein. "I was not aware that anything of what we are could be handed-down like that. So sometime in his past, a Sidereal brushed with his line? That would be an interesting thing. And it would explain his ignorance of the matter."

"I consider it unlikely," the Sidereal replies. "Our investigator would have to be a great fool to have overlooked that trait. Nevertheless, any assertion of our infallibility is negated by your role in this matter, so I do not discount it out of hand."

"My presence of the Isle should be kept as short as possible," replies Arafein. "Your plans could all be destroyed if my hand touches too many events, and that could lead to the ruin of us all." She frowns and sighs. "I will move more swiftly in this manner. Tomorrow I will take the boy and his father to Chandra. Or just the boy, if he prefers. I cannot let this task put the entire world in danger."

"I think you rather overestimate the importance of this marriage," smiles the Sidereal. "But very well. What further do you need from me?"

"It is not I who put the value on this marriage, but the heavens, it seems. I do put value on the work your people do. Much of your weaving is based on this Island, of course. My presence can disrupt and destroy it. That is what endangers things here. I must leave this place swiftly." The Lady Arafein offers a proper curtsey, "I need nothing further. Thank you for your aid, Chosen of the Maidens."

The man inclines his head politely, turning and departing back into the darkness. "Fare well," he offers, quietly, as he leaves.

Lady Arafein spends the next day travelling with Nepel, Linus, and his attendant. The invitation to see Chandra was accepted with a fair amount of ease. Arafein can only hope that the boy's luck with the ladies works with Chandra. She imagines that they will do well together. Perhaps his luck will find new outlets to the benefit of both of them. As she rides, Arafein is still mulling over the odd concept of inherited quirks of Exalt forebears. And on just how she can make this next stage work smoothly. Perhaps with a bit of skill Nepel can get Chandra to the same tunnel she fled. He already has shown the skill.

The carriage ride is equally swift. During the trip, Linus and his serving girl, named Kital, speak much during the breaks. There seems to be something between them, some shared secret the patrician does not wish to be known. Nepel, in his usual fashion, flirts even with this girl and smiles with pride at each feminine blush or frustrated pout his teasing and charm elicit.

As the carriage comes down the road and stops, a mile from the Cloister of Wisdom, Gallius is sure: Kital, the girl from the West Ridge district, is no more a servant than she herself is. She is either a noblewoman or someone trained by an aristocrat. Is she a spy in Linus' household? Does Linus know? And does it matter, or is this just one more political game the Realm plays?
