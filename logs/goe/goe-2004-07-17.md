# Gods of Eden 2004-07-17

After spending so many days in hectic activity, the past couple have seemed rather restful. Restful, at least on the surface. Something is bothering Lady Arafein about this companion of Linus, but she cannot quite put her finger on it. Surely she isn't who she says, but that's not really enough to be worried over. Or wouldn't be, if the lady had a clearer idea who she really is. It cannot be helped, though. All that Lady Arafein can do is make this meeting happen and see that things go well for both Chandra and Linus. And then escape.

Nepel assures Linus that he will be welcomed in the Cloister, and through a series of evasive question-and-answers, makes it as clear as possible that he and the Lady Arafein will need to enter through a different route than the carriage. Accordingly, Linus and his attendant ride on, and Nepel leads the Lady back through the secret passage. "I can show this to someone such as yourself, without great standing on the Isle," he explains cheerfully.

Lady Arafein explains rather quietly and concisely to Nepel that she is not returning to the Cloister on any permenant basis. She doesn't want to be seen by anyone except Chandra. And she asks only that he help her get back out and, if he is willing, well away from here. The horses he uses would truly help her shorten her trip back to safety. She will let him draw his own conclusions from those requests. She has no time nor patience to face any pointless punishments for her leaving without permission.

Nepel goes his way; Arafein goes hers. She skirts the gardens, moving toward the Convent. She's stopped by a voice; the simple, elegant tones of the Directrix, as that woman steps out ahead of her on the garden path and smiles. "Lady Arafein, would you come with me, please?" she asks in a polite voice.

Lady Arafein pauses for a moment, considering her options. If she had a knife she could just slit the woman's throat and be on her way. But with luck this will not be that troublesome. With luck. She manages to not grind her teeth as she turns and bobs a curtsey. She says nothing, but follows with her eyes averted, though she does pay the other woman much attention.

The Directrix leads the way to her office. Shutting the door after her guest, she moves to one side of the room and begins pouring tea from an ever-heated pot of water. "Please, sit," she offers. A few moments later the aromatic herbal scent fills the room, and she presents a tea-cup. "Mnemon Nepel does not know we are aware of his comings and goings. We rely on the simple method of placing a hair in a precise position atop the crate that leads to the secret passage. The complicated magical alarms are nice, but.. the Cloister has always prided itself on embracing simplicity." And she smiles.

Lady Arafein remains quiet, simply listening. So Nepel is not unknown here. As long as this doesn't interfere with her mission and her escape, it does not matter. She waits for the woman to get to her point with feigned patience, wondering whether she'll have to earn the title Anathema this day.

"Whatever charms he has," continues the Directrix, "I urge you not to fall prey to them, nor to be tempted into foolishness. He is a very clever young man, perhaps too clever for his own good." She changes focus, then, smiling a little. "I want today's events to be useful to you, as well as us, and I have the feeling that someone like you would make a good instructor, in time. But we have rather specific needs. Would you like to hear what makes a good teacher here?"

Lady Arafein lets herself feel a little bit of relief at this. It seems she is not in too much trouble just yet. It seems. She is hardly relaxed, however. "I would like to hear it," she says. If nothing else, it might be slightly useful later. Though her academy will probably not really resemble this place, which sits here, trying to shut-out the world.

"A school for leaders will have some powerful students. Powerful in that their families have social or economic influence. Powerful in that they are willful and strong-minded. There are other types of power, such as magical ability and Essence-manipulation, or the ability to do physical violence, but it is the first two types we are most concerned with." The Directrix sips her tea quietly, sitting and getting comfortable. "A teacher of such students must be even more powerful - more strong-minded than the stubborn students, unconcerned with the political power of the families whose scion he punishes, and so forth. Such teachers would be leaders in their own right. But the first duty of every teacher here is to the school and its students. We cannot afford to have teachers who have their own agendas, or who play politics. They must have the power leaders have, but not do the things the powerful naturally do. Do you understand?"

"I suppose I do," replies Lady Arafein. She tries not to smirk. Perhaps the Directrix knows what she was up to. It doesn't matter, unless she interferes. That would be a bloody mess. The Bronze Faction would probably be very upset with Gallius for her actions. She still waits for the woman to get to her point, however.

"Whatever you do with your life, here or elsewhere, do not let the power you have interfere in doing what you must do," the woman says. "You have an obligation to your House. Do not embarrass them, or us, by indulging in what power permits, such as running away to be flattered in some summer-house by the likes of Mnemon Nepel." She nods her head slowly. "Please return to your business. I expect to see you attending to your duties again from now on."

"Yes, Directrix," says Lady Arafein. She rises to bob another curtsey and will depart as swiftly as possible. To find Nepel and Linus and Chandra. Well, so much for avoiding notice. If the rest doesn't end in disaster it doesn't matter, anyway. Arafein is beginning to think this might actually work smoothly. Even here, where the Solars are hated, fortune seems to be rolling with her. No doubt the Bronze Faction is doing their best to make it work out that way, too.

---

The carriage is parked by the river-side, and already retainers from the school have brought out refreshments for Linus and the girl called Kital; even here, the aristocracy is respected and honored. The site is far enough from the school buildings proper to avoid notice beyond that, and once the retainers have left, Nepel and Arafein approach. With them comes Chandra, dressed appropriately and looking concerned.

Lady Arafein, feeling much less ruffled now, arranges the introductions with all the propriety she can. Sadly she's far from the Nation and cannot get a proper gown. It's not like they'd appreciate her official title much, anyway. When the two are drawn together, Arafein's clear voice intones, "Nells Chenault Linus, I present to you Lady Ragara Calel Chandra." She herself offers a respectful curtsey and watches very closely how the two react. Much has gone into this meeting. She hopes she is not trying to milk a stone.

In the time she's been here, Gallius has gotten to know Chandra well enough. She is indeed analytical, and sometimes even cold, with a facade behind which she hides tears - Gallius has heard them twice since that first time in the garden, and still the secret of them remains hidden. Now, as Linus speaks with Chandra politely, and the Solar (and Nepel) stay tactfully out of sight but not quite out of earshot, Gallius can hear the line of questions Linus uses. Though his outward concern seems to be with Chandra herself, there is always an undercurrent: a hunt for breeding, or family station. The patrician is probing the young woman's life for prospects for his own. And Chandra answers, in that voice Arafein has heard, the quietly polite one that many find charmingly innocent, and that usually precedes her running off into the garden to cry again.

Lady Arafein frowns to herself and hrms. She sighs and looks to Nepel. Well, he's surely as useless in this as can be. Not that she's mad at him for that. The man has been a wonder and a marvel for her ever since she arrived. She has something to do, though, and she's not sure just how. She has to find out what is happening with Chandra and figure out what the cure is. For the first time the Lioness considers that this effort may be her first serious failure since her Exaltation. She will not allow herself another day at the Cloister. She can only wait for a break to draw Chandra away and do her best. And then she must start her flight.

When things slow down for a spell, Lady Arafein interrupts to draw Chandra away. She instructs Nepel to do likewise with Linus. She hopes that the rogue can dig out something of what Linus thinks of Chandra in the course of things. If not, it doesn't matter. He's not her main concern yet. Once Chandra is drawn away, Arafein turns to inspect the girl carefully. "I haven't helped you," she announces. "I am sorry. I thought I had found you someone who could make you happy, and yet I know that even now you hold back tears. I do not know why, and I fear my time is not what it was. I do not know how much help I can be in a short time, but if you wish for my aid, you have it while I am still here."

"It's .. it's okay," the girl half-whispers. "But he's just like everyone else, and.. I want something different. Even if it's not what my family wants, it's what I want." She stares out, away from the Cloister, and toward the distant hills of green grass. "I'm just a tool to get at the wealth of House Ragara. I'm not a woman at all. That's what I feel from him, and from everyone around me. I'm Chandra, the girl carven from ice." She wipes at her eyes uselessly again. "Just someone to use.. someone to be a statue or trophy.."

Lady Arafein sighs softly and offers a hand. "I will not use you, Chandra. This is not going to make you happy." She frowns in thought. "Then it must not be. I promised to help you. If you could leave this place and live a new life, would you? I can offer you that much. It will not be as easy, perhaps, but you will make your own way, and you will not be a trophy wife for anyone."

The girl shakes her head quickly. "No, I can't run away," she says. "I... I need to stay." She lets out a sigh. "I may as well tell you."

"When I was eight, my grandmother - Calel - attended a poetry recital at our family home. My mother was there, she had organized it. There were nine other children there, and each of us was reading a composition.." Chandra wipes her eyes, gaining strength. "I.. failed, completely. And not just that. I bawled, up in front of everyone. I cried my heart out. And my mother slapped me, in front of everyone.. So, I ran away. And Grandmother Calel was outside, by the gate. And she caught me as I ran for it, and picked me up, and hugged me so tightly, and carried me back into the house.. and she made me promise, never to run away."

"I never gave recitals after that," continues the girl. "I never.. was there for anything I had created. But I could paint, and compose music, and it would be displayed, or performed, by someone.. When I went out after that, I never talked to anyone, and so.. I got used to being quiet." She looks up, and sighs a bit. "I can't run away, and betray Grandma. But once, just once, I want to be.. more than something to be used for show. I want people to see me, and hear me, and really just listen. Like.. like you are doing now."

"They cannot hear or see you, dear, if you do not give them a chance," says Lady Arafein. "I think Linus is a good man. He has a destiny beyond his expectations, and he will need someone strong at his side, someone who is not afraid to share herself with him. We all fail, Chandra. We all feel fear from time to time. We cannot let the fear of failure keep us from even trying. That is worse than failure could ever be. Let him see the real you, find the real him. Forgive him his faults. He has had parents pushing him towards a 'worthy marriage' his entire life. No doubt you have felt the same. Love can be found even in such places as this, Chandra. I would not have arranged this meeting if I thought it would not go well for you."

Chandra's eyes grow dry again, and she regains some of her accustomed poise. "I don't know," she half-whispers. "But.. I will continue to speak to him, if you think he is a good person.."

"Give him a chance, Chandra. That is all you need do," says Lady Arafein. "If he does not seem right for you, I will not be sad. I just want to help you smile, dear." And so far, the Lioness feels like she's failing spectacularly. But the day is not yet over. Almost. But not yet.

Lady Arafein leaves Chandra a short time for herself, then slips off to see if Nepel has achieved anything of use while talking with Linus. Hopefully the man understands at least the general nature of the problem. He's not witless, after all, and anyone can see Linus was showing no interest in Chandra outside of her titles and estates. If that bunk continues, Arafein may have to put a permenant kink in his fate.

Nepel steps out to speak with Arafein, leaving Linus alone with the girl Kital. "Well, I've discovered two things," he says with a weak smile as the two gain their distance. "First of all, that serving-girl, Kital? She's a member of one of the Great Houses. I'll bet my best bottle of wine on it. Second of all, that man has no heart." The normally pleasant young rogue's voice turns a little hostile. "He'll make a good husband to a shark. But he has no real respect for people, unless they earn it from him. He seems very nice, and he probably is nice, but not unless he thinks you merit it."

Lady Arafein sighs. "What a wasted trip this has been, then," she laments. "But what do you mean. One on hand, you say he is vermin, on the other, you seem to think he might be nice. Which is it, Nepel? I want to know if I should waste any more time or find the first boat off this rock." She wrinkles her nose and snorts. "If I must, I'll put the fear of fire into his bones, but if he's a useless man we're done. I refuse to waste time on a young man who should be mucking stables."

The Exalt thinks carefully. "I would say that I cannot support you trying to marry this man off to that girl Chandra," he concludes. "For her honor and happiness, I'd oppose you and him both. Does it have to be her? Or him? I can certainly find that young patrician someone more to his liking in Mnemon."

"Then let us find them both proper pairings," says Lady Arafein. Mentally she gnashes her teeth, of course. "This will be difficult to achieve swiftly, I imagine. Do you know two wothy candidates, Nepel? Honestly I'd rather leave Linus in a sack for the ravens to feast on, but I have my duties to see to, and he must find a wife."

Nepel scratches his head a moment. "Well, it seems like anyone with good prospects will work well as far as Linus is concerned. He's not unkind, but he is..." He thinks for awhile, then crystallizes his observations into a coherent explanation. "He's short-sighted in matters of the heart. He is good, and he has empathy, but it can only stretch a short distance." He thinks again. "Yes, there's a Mnemon girl I might introduce him to. But what will you do about Chandra?"

"I don't know," admits Lady Arafein. "I must find someone who is not so stupid, for starters," she mutters. She considers for a bit, then a small smile forms on her lips. It grows more and more knowing. "I need someone who is very charming, yet who is not such a fool over station. Someone.. different. Someone who can see into the heart of a lady. Who will calm her and bring her joy. Who will show her how much he values her. Who will wake at her side and want nothing else." With each statement her eyes focus more and more on Nepel. She reaches out to dust off his sleeves and straighten his coat needlessly. "Nepel, you are a good man," she says simply.

"Well thank you," says Nepel with a smile. "So where do you intend to find this Prince Charming?"

"But not very bright," she murmurs, laughing softly. "I think you can make Chandra very happy," Lady Arafein says calmly. "And she surely is more than lovely enough to capture your interest. To think the solution to all these problems is so near at hand." And the Directrix will likely be over-joyed to have the man properly settled, at that.

"Wha..? Waitaminute," protests Nepel, uselessly, holding up his hands. "Me? Get married? Settle down?" His voice almost croaks at this last phrase, as his throat grows dry and lumpy. "Are.. are you sure there's nobody else?" he adds, weakly. "I mean, to make her happy, I.... uh...." He struggles, trying to muster an argument that will make him less of a candidate.

"Nepel," begins Lady Arafein, her voice more serious, "You are a good man. A wonderful man. I am very fond of Chandra. I have a daughter already, but this child I have taken under my wing as well, and I am certain you are the right person for this. The only question is, can you love and treasure her as she deserves?" The lady puts her fists on her hips and surveys Nepel for a moment and adds, "Besides, every hero deserves to eventually find his princess. Well, I'm thinking you have."

Nepel's face is painted in a rainbow of emotions, as he struggles to figure out what just happened to him. At last he gives up, consigning his doubts to the back of his mind, and gives a weak shrug. "Well, if it'll make her happy," he mumbles. The reluctant tone in his voice isn't disappointment. It's the prospect of a new kind of living, one he's unused to but secretly works toward, and in betraying his rakish nature, his sense of duty gains the upper hand at last. Resolve reveals itself on his face. "Alright. If it's what's best for her," he says.

Lady Arafein moves to take Nepel by the arm and begins casually listing all the best points of Lady Chandra as she leads him back. She also casually leaves Chandra and Nepel alone as she goes off to tell Linus that a better candidate has been found for him, and that she will be brought, if he is patient. The fool will no doubt feel relieved by that. Somehow it's a pity that he'll probably end up happy in this arrangement, but ah well. Chandra was the only real concern.

Linus takes the news well. "I appreciate the effort you are making on my behalf," he says at last, smiling. "The Exalted are born to privileged station, but some of us have to fight hard to achieve the same. It's rare to find friends who seem interested in helping."

Once Linus is settled decently, Lady Arafein returns to have a peep at how things are going with Nepel and Chandra. Nepel has a way, and unlike many the Lioness has seen, he is actually kind and gentle under that rogue facade. She imagines this is good practice for the future, too. A Queen must have a good eye for arranging happy marriages.

What she finds is what she more or less expected. Nepel is regaling Chandra with stories of his exploits, and commenting on his bravery and prowess. For her part, Chandra is listening quietly, even attentively to his boasting. It takes a minute for Gallius to recognize what he's doing. Nepel is deliberately phrasing his tales in a way that evokes old stories, paintings, songs, culture. He's discovered the girl's artist nature and is deliberately playing off it to make her feel part of the production, even if she isn't - yet - saying anything substantial. She'll open up in time, and Nepel is giving her every possible hook to begin conversation with.

---

One of the directors of the Heptagram himself arrives two days later. With the Lady Arafein present, the Directrix receives a formal letter from him, thanking the Cloister of Wisdom for its attentive diligence in keeping the Lady safe and secure. There is room in the carriage for her, and the sorcerer-teacher leads the way out. Nepel, Linus, and Kital are waiting in Nepel's own carriage outside the Cloister grounds, and everyone assembles to discuss future direction.

"I'm to take the Lady Arafein with me," the Heptagram's instructor explains, and both Linus and Nepel bow low in deference to this senior man's orders. "Chenault Linus, allow me to congratulate you. I received word of your impending wedding to Mnemon Fon Sisela from the Lady Arafein. And Nepel, congratulations as well." The young man blushes faintly and smiles. "Please let me be the first to wish you a pleasant and safe journey, sir," he offers to the director, then smiles at Arafein. Nothing need be said.

The Lady Arafein smiles, though part of her imagines she is about to step into the very arms of the enemy. She turns to those gathered and curtseys, saying, "It was an honor to serve you, and to come to know each of you. I hope that all of you find the joy you desire. Farewell, my friends." And with such simple words, the Lady departs.

---

In the carriage, the director of the Heptagram ceases to be a director, and starts being the Fisher. The Sidereal calmly opens his robe and withdraws a letter, presenting it to Gallius. "Unexpected, but the outcome is what matters," he says.

"For a while I feared that failure was the best outcome," admits the Lioness. "But it seems joy won the day. The Maidens have smiled upon these children. I think they will all find happiness and strength to face whatever may come." And the Lady Gallius Leom fears much may be coming. "I trust things have gone much as they were in my absence, Fisher? I would hate to have abandoned my people when they were in need."

"Things are things," replies the Sidereal, enigmatically. "Your Circle has begun questing for something - the Book of Three Circles, I assume. Your other Solar associates - the negotiator, the assassin and the spy - have remained busy."

"Well, we do what we are made to do, I suppose," says Gallius. "So they are searching for the Book of Three Circles. I do not know whether to hope that they find it, or to hope instead that it was destroyed."

"Hope instead that they know what to do with it - or not - once they discover it," counsels the Fisher. "I'll take you to them shortly. But first, you are bound for Heaven."

Gallius nods to the Fisher. "Let's go settle matters in Yu-Shan first. I just hope this act did not cause the Bronze Faction any more headaches than it was destined to." An ironic thing to say, she imagines.

---

In the vast metropolis of Yu-Shan, Great City of the Gods, Gallius stands on a high balcony with a gold rail running around its length. She looks over the expanse of the city, then back as footfalls herald the arrival of her host. Venus, Maiden of Serenity smiles. "I am to understand you, a Solar, fulfilled an obligation for the Sidereals," she says. "How did you fare?" Her voice is lovely, and soft, the sensual breeze of a warm summer afternoon.

Gallius offers a deep curtsey to Venus and smiles at the sound of her voice. "I hope I have fared well," she answers softly. "I tried to bring joy to Lady Chandra and Nepel, and, in his own way, Linus too should find happiness in what has been arranged, if destiny wills it."

"I am told that you learned what happened," the Maiden continues gently. "This Linus inherited some fraction of a Sidereal progenitor's power, and used it all unknowing to make his dream of highborn marriage a reality. My Chosen were surprised by this, and I'm told that Jupiter's Chosen are even now trying to discover the truth of his parentage. But you succeeded where they did not, and for that I thank you. Linus will be happier, I think, when the Sidereals discover how to seal away that manipulative power working through him. He will be his own man again."

"I'm sure he will find a fitting destiny," agrees Gallius. "It surprised me, to find that something of our sparks might pass on to our children. I had always thought that was impossible. Are all the children of the Chosen in such danger? Or is danger even the right word for it?" The Solar smiles and studies Venus for a moment, then looks away. She had forgotten how beautiful Venus was. "Your presence flatters me, Lady Venus," she confesses. She has never quite come to grips with being able to meet the Gods.

"I don't know the truth of that matter," smiles the Maiden of Serenity. "But the great Autochthon made the Terrestrial sparks capable of passing on their full power through the blood. The Celestial sparks could not be inherited so, but perhaps they still contain something of the same quality..." She steps to the railing, setting her perfect hands on it, and looking out over the city. "I think it's wonderful that parents can give their children something of themselves, don't you?"

Gallius nods and smiles warmly, "It is. Part of the beauty of being Chosen is that you have more parents than you were born with," says the Solar. "If it does no harm, then I am not worried over it. I am content to let things be as they are. And you know I am rarely content with anything." She laughs softly, "But.. right now I am somehow at peace." Gallius imagines to be anything but calm next to Venus would be something of an insult.

"Remember that feeling well, Gallius," suggests Venus. "You have the power to claim anything in the world as your own, in time, except for peace of mind. Treasure it when it is given to you. And when you have had your fill of it here, come to me again. As promised, I will free more of your memories, and you will find power... and perhaps lose some of the peace you enjoy now. Decide when you are ready for it."

"Time here does not stop, does it Lady Venus?" asks Gallius softly. Her voice remains steady and calm, though her questions sound odd in such a tone, "While I rest here, people need me, and by accepting this spark, I gave myself wholly to them. I was Chosen because I am me. Lord Helios knows I am who and what I am. Even in peace I will think of those whom I might have saved. I love humans, and I wish to protect them. What you return to me.. is it dangerous? If it is part of my past self, does it mean that I am fated to be what I was?"

"Anything can be dangerous," replies the goddess with a hint of sadness. "But time and fate are a strange mirror. Hold up your left hand and your reflection raises its right, yet it is still you. Different in some ways, the same in others. The memories you will gain were once true experiences, but as time passed, their nature changed." Venus reflects a moment in stillness. "They will be dangerous if they mirror your thoughts of today."

"Or they might save me from the same path, if I am too much like the past," says Gallius. "I know from tales what happened, at least. And yet against what is coming, I will need whatever strength those memories can provide. I will use one day, Lady Venus, and then I will depart. I wish to offer my song to Yu-Shan once more. Perhaps you will listen when I play, and something of the joy the gift of music has brought to me can be repaid in song."

"I will," promises the goddess.
