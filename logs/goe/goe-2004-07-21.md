The homecoming of a hero is supposed to be dramatic, with parades and people waving and shouting, and lots of treasure. Gallius doesn't have any such greeting. Then again, she doesn't feel that heroic. Mostly just worn from travel and glad to have finished her task. The saddle-sore Solar arrives in Bridal Veil in the very earliest hours of morning, and having to show her caste symbol to her own guards is her reward for travelling at odd times. At least they recognize Wingfoot easily enough, and in short order the Queen is settled in her quarters. Word of her arrival will no doubt prevent her from getting much rest just yet. She's been away for some time, and there are so many things that wait on her.

The first thing the Queen of the Nation of the Sun does is bother her head maid and has a copper tub brought to her room and filled with steaming water. Grateful for the help of her maid, Gallius slips out of her riding clothes and into the tub, letting out a deep sigh. The newest noble trend is bubbles in the baths, and thus concealed, Gallius instructs her maid to allow official business into her chambers, should anyone arrive claiming it. The woman considers her Queen for a moment, saying off-hand, "When I've been on long journeys the first thing I would do is have a good soak and a long nap. I will let them know you are here, my Queen." The woman politely curtseys and steps out into the hall, leaving Gallius alone and about as comfortable as she can be.

"Of course I'm here on official business," declares Ramar, as he is led inside the chamber. The woman curtseys once more, and heads off, mumbling about something or another. Ramar peers through the thin haze that's beginning to form, "Lady Gallius... you're back! I... er... you know, we seem to keep meeting in this manner..."

Chi-Yosh's hand falls onto Ramar's shoulder in a reassuring pat, while the Dawn cannot help but chuckle. "The Queen is always willing to make herself accessable to her subjects at all times, hear any audience when need be." Peering past the curtain with Ramar, "Gallious, how much longer before you will be taking meetings in your dreams?"

Gallius by this time has most of her body under the water, luckily. Leaving only what has to be out of the pleasant heat above the surface. She has to sit up a bit to get her mouth back above the soap bubbles. "Yes, I'm back," she says, sounding tired, but quite relaxed. "I see you are all still in one piece. Meetings in my dreams? If I can figure out how, I'll start doing it immediately." She shifts in the water, stretching out a bit. "I have heard a little about what has been going on. The Fisher told me you might be seeking a certain book that is of much interest."

"Then you have the advantage of us, my Lady Gallius. You know what it is we are doing... and likely as not what we've done, but we know nothing of what you've been doing." Ramar has a small, secret sort of smile on his face at the mention of meetings in dreams. "You know... I believe that there's something to be said for meetings in dreams..." it's almost wistful really. "How were things on the Blessed Isle?"

Davron chuckles wryly. "A book that, among other things, _would_ indeed allow you to have meetings in your dreams, Lady Gallius. At least amongst the handful of us."

"I was given a task," says Gallius. "In the end, I learned that I was working for Lady Venus herself. A most remarkable discovery." She muses silently for a moment before turning her mind back to things, "I was arranging a couple marriages. And I learned a few things of interest. Did you know that portions of what makes Exalt's special can rub off and make our children more capable? One of those I arranged a marriage for was the child of a Sidereal, it seems, and fate favored him with women." She grins impishly. "But fear not, he had no luck with me."

Chi-Yosh can only smile wryly, recalling his own grim correspondence with Weeping Prowler through the sleeping realm. "And who would that be fortunate for? Him or us?"

Ramar nods to Davron, "You'd be surprised at what is already possible my friend." He turns to Gallius once more, "I did not know that..." Ramar raises his eyebrows, "Heh. No luck. I wonder, what else have you learned? Or... perhaps you'd rather take this time to sleep, and enjoy your bath."

"I do not wish to sleep yet," says Gallius. "I'm not so frail as that. Wingfoot did all the work, and got me here in quite good time. And Jin-nu was kind enough to carry me all the way to my room. She must have done a great deal of work on the head maid, she doesn't even complain when Jin-nu enters my chambers." She waves a hand and grins, "But tell me what you have done."

Ramar's cheeks tint, "We... have not done too terribly much since we've parted ways. Aside from beginning our investigations into the location of the book, we have also discovered a few means of travelling here and there... not so active as you, I'm afraid."

Chi-Yosh sideglances to Ramar, before stepping inside a little more. "We did accomplish a few things. You will be glad to know that we have earned more enemies of the Nation, and then exercised our power with the assistance of Lookshy. The good news is, _Pride of the Nation_ works well." An all too knowing smile kindles on the Su'Katan's features.

"Ah yes. We did... the business with the Fair Folk... although I believe that was settled when we left the City of Dreams?" Ramar sounds rather curious. "Er, the _Pride of the Nation_? What's that?"

Davron grins. "The royal warstrider has a name now, Ramar. And it earned that name very well indeed, when the behemoth Cademius threatened the lands of the East." He sobers somewhat. "A warstrider in the hands of a powerful Solar warrior is a truly fearsome thing," he says, nodding in Chi-Yosh's direction.

Chi-Yosh merely nods in acknowledgement. Even if the smile he affords the Circle is less than humble.

Gallius looks to Chi-Yosh, arching an eyebrow. "Happy over making an enemy? I trust it was for good reason, anyway. I am pleased that you did well with the strider. If you don't mind, I'd like to have a banquet in your honor, and in the name of the others who fought, of course. Royalty does not just exist to command, but to reward those who defend their nation." She adds more seriously, "Many royals create orders for those who show virtue. I would like to create the Order of the Vigilant Dawn, for those who battle against the forces of darkness and the madness of the Wyld. If you are not offended by it, Chi-Yosh, I would like you to be the first in that order." She grins, "I know, it may sound foolish to you, but trust me. It is important. People need things to believe in."

Chi-Yosh is surprised. The idea of a banquet in his honor does not immediately bother him; invitations, naturally, would be sent to Lookshy, as well as be made for anyone welcome to come to the capital; a banquet open to all those who are hungry and wish to celebrate. Yet, the next decoration sets the Solar on his heels. "...no, not offended. Surprised. Warmed. But not offended." He bows deeply. "I accept the honor of this decoration, Queen Gallius."

Ramar turns to his friend and grins. _I wonder if he can find a way to keep mostly modest about this._ "A grand idea. Congratulations Chi-Yosh... you've done well... I imagine you'll have a fair bit to boast to the Lunars about now." He turns to Davron then, "And I'm sure you had some part to play in it as well... unless Chi-Yosh faced down a behemoth all on his own..."

Davron nods. "The Lookshy team allowed me to ride one of their warstriders against the creature, and I did put my mark upon it. But in truth, my greatest role was to put a powerful weapon in Chi-Yosh's hands." He grins. "Of course, if I were to construct a bow to fit the _Pride's_ hand, things might be rather different."

Gallius laughs softly and suggests, "When we tell the story of how you were told of the honor we'll leave out the part about me being in my bath." She stretches and bobs herself under the water for a moment, only to pop up again with a gasp. "That's very nice and warm! You have done very well my friends. I'm so glad to be back with you. And since you are interested in Solar magic, I have another story to tell you. Venus rewarded me with more of my old memories, and some of my old strength." She abruptly says, "I'm coming out of the water now." She waits for a heartbeat, then starts to rise, her laughter coming softly again. "Now, where was that towel." Before the words even get out of her mouth her maid is in the room, drying her Queen off in haste and helping her into a warm robe and slippers. Another deep curtsey and the maid is gone once more.

Ramar raises an eyebrow cautiously, "Some of your old strength and memories? Ahh... that is something to be cautious of, lest you lose yourself to who you were before... but I believe you're more than strong enough. What is it you have learned." Ramar chuckles to himself as Gally begins to rise, only to be saved by her maid and the towel. _Alas._

Davron is, for his part, a gentleman - though in truth as much by habit as by inclination - and takes his cue to contemplate the ceiling at the appropriate moment. "We cannot save Creation from the dangers that lie beyond it if we do not have our full strength. We can only hope that we can retain the humility to use that strength justly." As the maid passes, he nods to Gallius. "May we hear this story?" he asks, smiling.

Ramar considers this though, "Would it be our full strength though, if we recover this lost Magic? I do not believe that Solar Magic is the final piece of our strength... although I believe it may be a good starting point..."

Gallius beams at her departing maid and notes, "The robe was warmed. She's such a wonder." The Queen settles herself in a comfortable chair and gestures for her friends to sit with her. "I have a memory of solar sorcery," she says simply. "It is.. beyond dreams, and it is encouraging. I do not know if we are ready for it yet, but we may not have the luxury of preparation. In any case, I will tell the tale as well as I can."

The Lady does not rely just on words, of course. She calls upon essence to give images to her word, so that her memories can be shared. "The land was not yet formed then," she begins, and visions of chaos are brought to the eye. Those who have seen the Wyld, or even heard much of it, will recognize it immediately. "There were ten of us gathered. Each great sorcerors, but also great workers of music. We were not alone," she adds. The visions of the Solars are blurred, faces imprecise, lost in the weight of time. The others with them are 330 in number, all of them beautiful or handsome, all proud and strong. Clearly they are not mortals, but Terrestrial Exalts.

"We had many people and a need for new lands, new wonders to give to our mortal followers," says Gallius softly. She hums quietly, and the images shift, showing the ten solars dividing, so that nine of them form a circle far from the tenth, a woman who stands in the center. With each of the solars who moved away are 30 of the dragon-blooded, leaving 60 to be at the center. They settle onto the chaotic ground, drawing out instruments here and there, all their eyes on the nearest solar, and the solars focus on the center, where the hands of a female solar are raised.

"They could weave music into being. They played Creation for days," says Gallius. Her humming grows slightly stronger, and the exalts lift their music, and the solars begin to move around the center. Directors of their individual symphonies, directed in turn from the central sorceror. Slowly chaos is formed and moulded, sweet air floods the barren land, then a large hill forms to the north, and to the south a lake is delved and filled with clear waters, rich with fish. The skies come alive with the wings of exotic birds.

A forest springs up in the east, providing material for men to use. The song shifts, and roads form themselves, rolling into the distance. The west is cleared carefully, a huge expanse of land flattened for what will be a city. Spires lift up, houses form one by one, unique as snowflakes. Another Solar's work flares up, and fields are made rich. Another works to send trees climbing ever higher, so that the homes of Exalts here may be in the trees, away from the clamor of the city below.

Gallius finally stops her soft, lilting hum and smiles. "There is more, but as you can see, the Third Circle was capable of great things. To think that so many of our people had its power at their fingertips.. I wish I could call upon such power. I could make a beautiful city very quickly. A safe place for the people even against our enemies."

Ramar smiles softly, and stirs from the idle thoughts her tale had inspired in him. His eyes turn to regard her, "Perhaps that can be done. Although... I do not know how well it will work. We shall see what happens..." Ramar does his best to hide the worry in his voice.

Chi-Yosh's eyes see past the spent essence of Gallius's shared vision. It peers beyond the room, into the past. The First Age. So long ago. He finally clears his throat, and smiles to those present. "I think... I can return with a story. It is nothing so grand, but of the Third Circle's might none the less."

The tusk had pierced her back. Blood ran in thick rivlets from under her armor, staining saffron robes into an ugly crimson mess and leaving a pool where she had been flung. Fearing magical retribution from the Solar's death throes, the demon hunkered back, its' great mass crouched with anticipation to leap away. The creature was Galdagun the Blight, summoned of the Second Circle, and its' path across the lands had left a wake of destraught land, infertile beast and man alike. Galdagun's brothers, two scores deep, surrounded the Solar and Lunar pair. Countless others born of Malfeas littered the great cathedral like garbage.

It hurt. The pain of a gored stomach was something you do not forget. To move ment to scream. Morning Glory did a lot of screaming. Steading the staff beneath her, the roar wrenched from her as she found her feet matched that of Luna's Chosen tearing into the infernal ranks, but they were both wounded. The Terrestrial Garrison was not aware of their plight. There was one course of action.

Blood from the wound began to burn an iridescent purple. It flared and sizzled as Essence roared from her body, down into the standing pool. Runes, great bars and stripes glared through cloth and armor like brands. They swept out from her, glaring upon every surface: ceiling, wall and floor alike. The pain was merely a fuel, every pulse of it sending the flares ever brighter. The demons stood wary, the Lunar stopped to catch breath, shaking his beastial head to fling sweat and gore. It slung from his features, and poised in the air, as all breath stopped.

The world began again, the sands of time flowing once more for the cathedral. Yet this time, surrounding the couple were jade-garbed legions of loyal Terrestrials, their animas glowing with hungry essence, heralding their hard work. And that work was grim, for the hall was spattered with Galdagun's brothers, piled aside. The magic was spent, its' ceremonies once burned into the flesh of Morning Glory, held for a time, now spent. The Solar saluted her garrison, and fell backwards into the waiting arms of a knight.

"The powers of our former selves were very great, and could do things both wondrous and terrible," says Gallius softly. "We always think of the power in our hands. But what if an enemy has this power at their fingertips? We must gain the knowledge of this sorcery. It is the only way to protect our own people against it, it seems."

"Or at least the knowledge of how to counteract it. Although again, I do not believe this to be the only path to protect our people. It will help, yes, but it is not all we must focus on." Ramar considers this carefully, "Davron? Have you had such a dream, I wonder?"

Ramar coninues, "In any case... we should perhaps think on this for a time. Things have been going smoothly in the nation during your absence. I have undertaken the task of compliling a list of our assets... would you like to hear them?"

Davron shakes his head. "I have not had any dreams of my past life. I... think I am afraid of it. The former bearer of my spark was a deadly warrior in his time. Though..." he smiles. "I have seen much war myself, since my Exaltation. Perhaps in time I will dare to face my past."

Gallius stands up to set a hand on Davron's right shoulder. "It will be alright," she assures softly. Her eyes shift to Ramar, "A list of assets, hmm? I wouldn't mind hearing what your opinion is in that area." She heads back to her seat, but only after stripping a blanket from her bed to wrap-up in.

And so, Ramar begins recounting the list of things he has considered as assets that the Circle has access to, if nothing else, as well as those nations who could be potential allies or that still have ties to members of the Circle. He states this concisely enough, then asks, "Have I overlooked anything? Is anyone still awake after that?"

Gallius is comfortably bundled in her seat, but is not yet sleeping, though she looks like she ought to be. "I think that is a fair list of what we have. I will have to ask Marina for some precision on our border situation. The western sweep should begin soon. We have the river in our grasp already, so we will move west and bulge north, as well, until we swell all around the Lesser Rock and can start claiming the Rock River, as well."

Ramar blinks, "Are you sure we're ready to expand like that? I mean... it may be some time before we can find the Book, and then after that we'll need time to prepare... I suppose..." Ramar sighs, "We'll just have to devote more time to conquest. For the next long while anyway."

Gallius actually laughs softly at this, "Ramar, how much effort have you put in to the conquest?" she asks. "It is not as if we will be doing it ourselves. I'm a Queen, Dace is a general, Yana is a.. scout, and Marina is my minister. They do most of the day to day work. Even my presence is rarely needed, and then it is hardly all that dangerous. Not nearly so dangerous as what Chi-Yosh and Davron dealt with."

"Assuming nothing horrible happens," Notes Chi-Yosh, "Like what resulted when we went to Harborhead, we can simply leave the Nation to conquest for itself while searching for the Book."

Ramar considers, "Well... I fought alongside our forces when we attacked Harborhead, and when we were against Greyfalls... I have aided Marina with getting things running smoothly... I suppose that is not too much time though. It just seems that way you know."

Ramar says, "I suppose I'm more worried about how the other nations would use our fledgling nation to their own ends..."

Davron chuckles. "With Marina as our minister, Ramar, I don't think you need fear too many of the local regimes putting one over on us. The only danger is if they have the backing of a powerful personage themselves." He cracks his knuckles. "And _that_ might be a challenge we might have to deal with personally. Though it is to be hoped that one of our... more secretive allies could give us advance warning if we face such a danger."

Ramar smiles, "Yes, there is that. It does put my mind at ease." He laughs softly, "Although, I have to admit, it leaves me feeling rather useless. No wonder I feel so lazy."

"I have already set our mysterious eyes and ears into motion," says Gallius. "He will do well, and I have no fears. They have tried our strength once and were sent reeling for their efforts. The Guild now realizes that resisting us is highly unprofitable. In time we can guide them and change their ways, I think. Without a war." The Queen smiles and lets out a contented sigh, "If there were no Fair Folk or Abyssals my entire life would be ideal."

Davron grins. "Think of it this way, Ramar. We are now free to deal with far more challenging problems. Like the quest for the Book."

Ramar nods, "Well that makes sense then. I will most certainly enjoy going out into the world once more... although really, it shouldn't be all that hard to find some missing book..." He grins wryly, "Right?"

Davron simply bursts into joyous laughter.

Chi-Yosh joins Davron with a chuckle. "Certainly. And it should be easy enough to end the Great Curse. The Deathlords are merely a simple problem to be handled in an afternoon."

Gallius arches an eyebrow and shakes her head. "Some things do not change," she comments idly. "Is there anything else that I should know of? You mentioned enemies you made, but were not very specific about them."

Davron gasps for breath, grinning, then subsides, quickly sobering at the memory. "The City of Dreams. Which we inadvertently destroyed while attempting to learn more about Lesell." The nature of the inhabitants of the City of Dreams, of course, is something Gallius can quickly deduce.

"You destroyed the City of Dreams by accident?" asks Gallius. She laughs softly and comments, "Perhaps you can do the same to a shadowland. That would be a very helpful trick."

Chi-Yosh sideglances at Davron with a wry smile. "Yes. Trip and knock over its' dark light source."

Ramar points out, "We released the souls that had been trapped and totured there by some strange and twisted Magics, and their released served to release the city as well."

"At least those enemies are weakened by the loss of their city," says Gallius. She yawns and covers her mouth, sighing. "I fear my maid will soon be coming in and fretting over how tired I am. And she will be quite right to do so."

Ramar bows his head, "Then... I suppose we should leave you for the time being? If, after all you'd wish to have your rest..."

Davron nods. "I... should probably turn in as well," he says, rising to his feet. For some reason he seems a little unsettled, as if the discussion of the First Age has stirred something inside him.

Gallius nods to Davron and wears a tired smile. "I will lie down to rest, then. My daughter should be here soon, I hope. I sent word right away for her. She will know enough to wake me. Here we are, in the early morning, going to sleep. Travelling makes for odd schedules. Soon I hope to get back on a more normal routine, though."

"Indeed it does... although..." Ramar smiles almost shyly, "Your return is a most welcome one, Lady Gallius. I hope that we did not disturb your bath too much... it is... well, very nice to have you back with us once more..."
