# Gods of Eden 2004-08-01

The Fisher, peculiar man that he is, can just as often be found at his small, unassuming residence in the Nation as he can anywhere else. Given that he's demonstrated the ability to anticipate visitor arrivals, the Solars have slowly come to realize that when he is not there to greet them, it is for a reason. Nevertheless he's polite enough to leave notes, and in the wake of the return from Icehome, Ramar can find the enigmatic Chosen polishing a small rock in a grassy field, a few miles west of Bridal Veil.

"Good day," greets Ramar as he walks along the field. Theres a peculiar look on his face once he spots what the Fisher is up to. "I... well, if you are not too busy, I would like to have a moment of your time. I uhm, I would like your council, your advice. This whole... well, I am troubled these days." The Solar gives a small chuckle, "I suppose we all must be though."

"How can I help?" the Fisher asks, politely, as he turns to regard his 'guest'. His hands continue their work of polishing, without a need for his attention.

"I was hoping to ask your advice on the matter of the Book. It is no small quest we have begun, and the consequences, well... they could change the world. To hear the Lady Gallius speak, it seems that once we succeed the whole world is ready to go up in arms to reclaim the Book." Ramar chuckles, its more for relief than for humor though. "I just dont know. I believe its exaggeration to think the world will be after it, but, it is not too difficult to imagine that the book will cause quite a stir. I cant speak for the rest of the Circle, but I for one would rather not see the delicate balance things hang in upset just yet. Id rather bring people together. I dont think the world is ready for another war. I know Im not. So... I suppose what I would like to know is... well, do you think its all worth it? How do we keep from straying from our path and taking the world on a turn for the worse?"

"Whether it is worth it or not is not a question I can answer," the Sidereal states with a smile. "I do not know your values, hence I cannot tell you what is or is not a worthwhile pursuit. As to avoiding war arising from your control of the Book, that is simple enough. Leave no one alive who knows you have it, tell no one that you have it, and do not use it."

"Yes. That is a simple solution. Although, I am sure we are not the only ones who know what exactly our Circle is after." Ramar nods slowly, "And the simple solution becomes more difficult. As for not using it, that is a temptation that can be resisted, though there may come a time when we must use it. Is there... well, is there a way to keep the Chosen of the Maidens from knowing we have it?"

"Not while I am around," says the Fisher. "It is my duty to report things of importance to my fellows. And I may not be the only resource they have gathering information on your activities."

"I understand." Ramar bows his head in contemplation, stroking his chin thoughtfully. "And I would not prevent you from doing your duty. After all, they are your faction, your Circle. It is your place to do so. It is very honorable. And I imagine that you would be more than capable of being their only resource, but I do not believe you are." Again, he chuckles, "I know I would rather leave you alive, and I hope you would rather leave me alive. So then... is it possible for our respective factions-such as they are-to cooperate?"

The Fisher smiles again, turning the rock over in his hands to continue his work while he speaks. "We are cooperating now, are we not?"

Ramar laughs, "Yes, yes we are." The Solar relaxes. "I suppose then it will be inevitable that should we find the Book, people will know. And that many of them will be alive even after we have it. So, what course of action would you suggest?"

Ramar says, "And what are your thoughts on this matter. What do you think about the possibility of the book being recovered once more?"

The Fisher, having completed the meticulous cleaning of the rock in his hands, turns it over, inspecting its smooth and dirt-free surface. He's apparently put some effort into the task. Now he draws back, throwing it as far across the field as he can muster. In a moment, the time he put into cleaning the rock is gone, as it returns to its native soil to once again become dirty and forgotten. "I suggest that pursuing the Book is a waste if you do not intend to use it," he says.

"As to finding it, I don't know," he adds. "Your chances are beyond my ability to discern."

"Just like that rock..." murmurs Ramar, as he watches the stone sink into the soil. "I see what you mean. Thank you," the Solar nods, "That is a lesson well worth learning."

"If you wish to act efficiently, I would point out that conflict is inevitable. Whether or not you have the Book, you will be attacked." The Fisher's voice is grave despite his humble smile. "Avoiding war when another wishes it will never work to your advantage."

"I see. Then I shall do my best to see that we are prepared." Ramar nods, his voice is similarly grave concerning these serious matters. "If war is inevitable, then we must take steps to minimize all casualties. And to strengthen our ties, rather than let the lure of the Book weaken them." He sighs. "Someday, things must change for the better." Ramar looks around carefully, as though expecting to see something that is not there. "What of those who lurk in shadows and death... I would imagine they at least are watching... perhaps more. Do you know?"

"You speak of ghosts, and the dead, and the spirits that serve them," says the Sidereal. "They can be found in the wild places, when the Sun fades from the sky, but your cities are warded against them. I think the Deathlords would have a great interest in the Book, and whoever holds it."

"I imagine they would. I know they are old. As old as death perhaps... but, is there some way they might be connected to the book? I know their knights have their own mockery of Sorcery... but..." Ramar lets his voice trail off, the unspoken question of whether or not the Deathlords could have the book, or know who holds it hangs in the air. "I do not wish to see more of them."

"Nevertheless, you may anyway. The Deathlords are powerful sorcerers," the Fisher advises. "But they will be only one of your adversaries."

"I have seen the power of their Sorcery. I have seen the power their demonic allies can unleash..." Ramar shudders at an unasked for memory. "If only in memories not my own." He glances around again, "I will learn to counter their power. Someone must. But... who else is among our adversaries? I imagine the Fair ones might be... and if the Realm should catch wind of this...then..."

The Sidereal nods. "And any other great power that desires magical knowledge or the wisdom of the First Age for itself."

Ramar sighs. "Which is most great powers..." He considers this information carefully. "Well need to be careful. While we may not be able to avoid conflict, we can at least take control of how the conflict happens, yes?"

"That is what power is for. The book represents power." The Fisher smiles carefully.

"Yes..." Ramar pauses a moment, studying the Fisher... "And when the great powers that man the Celestial Bureaucracy decide on this power... what then?"

"Decide?" asks the Sidereal.

Ramar considers, "Decide whether or not we can be trusted with it is perhaps the best way to phrase it." Ramar inclines his head, "It is a dangerous thing we go to recover, and I imagine there are quite a few who would not want their hard work undone..."

"You assume the Celestial Bureaucracy is potent enough to stop you at its pleasure, which is not the case," the man chides. "What remains of it is not even coherent enough to pursue a unified course of action."

"Oh. I... I misunderstood then." Ramar apologizes, "That should change. Although I do not know the best way to do so."

After a moment's thought, Ramar asks, "How... what would be the best way to discover the resources our adversaires... and our allies are using to find out information on our activities?"

"Acquire spies," suggests the Fisher. "Use sorcery to ferret out the spies in your own domains. Send your own spies to the houses of your allies and enemies. It is basically the same in all places of power, such as a kingdom, church or merchant concern."

"Further, you can disseminate false information, and set traps where that information leads, to see which channels are safe, and which are not."

"And to find those who will know ahead of time which information is a false lead and which is not?" Ramar shakes his head, "I suppose it's asking too much to hope to catch every spy. All I can do is accept that they are there, it would seem."

The Sidereal nods slowly. "That is wise. Every fortress must have a weak point. Better to know that it exists. Best to control it, if you can."

"I see what you mean. Thank you for your counsel in these matters." Ramar listens attentively, then asks, "Are there ways around the wards that are around our cities... I shudder to think of what might happen if... well... certain foes especially should acquire the book from us..."

"Certainly. Any sorcerer can invoke a countermagic spell on the wards, and they will fall like rice paper before fire," says the Fisher. "Against a determined adversary, they are more of an alarm than a barrier. This has been true since the First Age, and before: static defenses are weaker. One must always have active forces, such as troops."

"I see. Something that... yes, that makes sense. Troops that can respond to the alarm quickly enough." Ramar notes, "Though a set of feints could bring down the wards, triggering responses and a sneak attack, and so on. It gets more and more complicated the deeper one gets." He pauses a moment, "What can keep the Wyld at bay? What can keep it from swallowing something whole..."

"Stability. It is said among our Convention that the Lunars understand the secrets of barricading the Wyld. The Solars of the First Age certainly did." The Fisher paces across the grass, his hands folded behind his back. "The interplay of people and existence itself will do it, even without overt magical assistance."

Ramar considers this carefully. "Stability. Hmmm..." After a moment, he asks, "Do you know much about the Lunars?"

The Sidereal shakes his head. "Those of them that know of us do not trust us, for the most part."

"I see. I can understand why they might not. Although I believe that is a shame. Together, the Chosen seem to work at their finest." Ramar raises an eyebrow, "Perhaps someday we shall find a way to combine our talents once more."

"That will not happen without power or purpose," says the other. "People do not work together simply because it is more efficient to do so. People do so because they share common goals, or because they have no other choice."

"Oh. You are right..." Ramar nods, "And it would seem that at this time, we do not have enough common goals, as a whole, to all work together. Not yet." He considers the Fisher, "What are your goals, your dreams?"

"They are mine alone," he replies with a cryptic smile.

Ramar nods, "Of course. Thank you for your counsel..." He stoops down, and picks up a shiny stone from in the dirt. He spends a few moments cleaning it, studying it. He nods to the Fisher, then pockets the rock, saving it for later use. "Good day."
