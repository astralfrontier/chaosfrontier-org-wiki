The gift of returning memories has opened many doors for Gallius. Each, she has found, is more terrifying and wondrous than the last. It is such a memory that wakes her in the dead of night, a cold sweat sending chills to the bone. Without even knowing the words she starts to sing a soft song in a tongue that hasn't been spoken in over a thousand years. The words remind her of something, but she can't force them to surrender their meaning, even as she continues to sing.

Her mind drifts to the thoughts of the dream, and it is this that she shares with her circle, letting the song create images for them, bolstered by the power of essence. They see a woman lying in a field, they can sense her pain, for three arrows are run through her, and they see a vague form, looking down at her, full of worry and frustration and wrath. They can see her gaze shift to a flower half crumpled under her arm. Her song is Gallius' song, and with it the flower suddenly bursts into a vibrant life, beautiful and full and blossoming. And then, all is dark once more, the song falters, then fails.

When the song ends, Gallius is quiet for a time. She finally explains, "This is another memory of the past. I know what it was that allowed me to heal plants with song, now. The stone's name, translated as well as modern tongues allow, is the Song of Life Stone. With it, I can raise plants and heal them with my voice alone."

"I see..." Ramar tilts his head curiously. "It is an interesting dream. Words can be quite powerful. There are hidden secrets to the world, hidden truths, I believe you have learned one..."

Chi-Yosh digests this tale for a time. The recollection of a past life's fall is a startling thing. Though, rather than dwell, the Dawn pushes forward with the information given. "With such a power, you could cure blight, and possibly bolster existing plants. It may depend on the power of the stone itself."

"If it works," says Gallius, "I can heal failing crops, I can drive back famine, and I can destroy small shadowlands without risking the lives of others. Just with song!" The Queen actually looks excited in a way she's not been for a very long time, "It'd be everything to me, honestly. I need to find that stone and help my people with its power. I could do so many good things with it."

Ramar says, "It sounds as though it is some sorcerous feat, to be certain. Perhaps we should try the great machine?" Ramar regards Gallius curiously. "Presuming that no one holds the stone currently... perhaps the Book will help us find it, should we find the Book?"

Davron chuckles. "The Machine should be all we need to find it, Ramar." He taps his chin. "Having found it, of course, _then_ the issue becomes whether we can... convince its current owners that it would be better in Gallius' hands. Of course, if the Manse is unheld, so much the better."

Chi-Yosh glances aside to Davron. "Would the Great Machine be able to decipher who the Manse belongs to, if it were occupied? Or do we merely knock and wait for an answer from the Exalt's network of defenses?"

Ramar shakes his head, "I do not know. There is a way to find out, and we will need to use the machine just the same. If we are lucky, it will be near the location of a Mental Health retoring stone."

"I don't believe it can tell us _who_ owns the Manse, Chi-Yosh," says Davron. "It can tell us _whether_ it is attuned, but beyond that, the only way to find out is to check for ourselves."

"It will be in the east," says Gallius. "It is a healing stone of plants. Oaken Claw made it clear that such a thing would tap into the aspect of wood." She taps her lip, nodding. "Yes, the machine is what we must use."

Ramar nods, "Then we shall travel to the Machine." He regards Gallius, "We were going to anyway. I hope you're all ready?"

---

The Solars rise from their accommodations. The people of the village that floats on the lake have been friendly, welcoming them back. For the last day or two, the Circle has plotted its direction here, only scant miles from the Great Machine. Now, with the onset of Gallius' dream, it seems they have a reason to revisit it before departing in their airship. Once again, preparations are made to penetrate into the goblin-infested forest.

"Very well then... and while we are there, perhaps all of you should track down Manses. This way we can all be more mobile, should we require it." Ramar leads the way through the Forest. The journey, while long, is not terribly dangerous. He's become accustomed to the telltale signs of goblin-ambushes and other such dangers. The scenery is lovely. The colors grow brighter, more lively as they approach the humming Essence that the Machine uses... "We're getting closer."

Surprisingly, the number of hobgoblins and other dream-spawn that infest the woods hasn't really gone down from last time. Are there simply uncounted numbers of the creatures that can overpower Gallius' and Chi-Yosh's purges through simple numbers, or is it that there are more goblins because people still believe that the wood is goblin-haunted?

"It would be wise for everyone to find one, preferably something on the way," says Gallius. "I'm guessing that other useful manses may lie nearby one of our two destinations."

It is just a matter of time before the Solars have made their way into the depths of the Great Machine. Ramar's anima glitters softly as Essence from the machine brings up the map of the Manses. With the guidance of the Circle, it is a matter of time before the dot concerning the Song of Life Stone is hovering above the others. "There it is..."

A few more stones can be found, left waiting for the Circle to come and claim them. It doesn't take much to note their locations, and keep them in mind. Ramar steps free of the Machine, "Now then. It looks like we have a bit of a journey. Into warmer woods..." He smiles, "To the airship, everyone?" And then it's back through the forest and to the village on the lake's surface, where the Pyramid floats, waiting for them.

There is nothing quite like flight. The world passes by, people walking about underneath, unaware as you soar above them. It's as though all of Creation is just there, waiting to be discovered anew. At least, this is how Ramar explains his love for the ship. The pyramid sails effortlessly through the cloudy sea of the skies above the Eastern forest. Green leaves, dotted here and there with flatlands... clearings, villages. Day becomes night, and the world changes. Now small fires pass beneath, and the distant glow of cities beckon to the airborne travellers... promising adventure and danger alike. Yet Ramar sticks to their course, and as the Sun sets once more, the pyramid touches down, out of sight, out of mind.

When the ship settles into the cover of the wood, a camp is struck by the Solars. Gallius has little to really do but allow the more wood crafty members of the party to handle things. She is fortunately patient enough to hold her enthusiasm in check, though the manse is so near.

The camp is a quiet one, the ship well-screened due its cunning placement in the thick tangle of the wood. When morning at last comes, the circle begins to make their way down into a bowl-shaped depression in the land, the decline a steady one at first, then growing more sharply as they go. It is not long before they find something of a path, though no sign of what might have made it can be found.

The Manse of the Eternal Song is a mingling of colors, all framed in a light halo of green. All manner of plantlife can be seen here, peeking out among the small gaps in a huge dome of vines. Here and there, the points of black barbs can be seen among the green shoots, showing just how formidible the barrier truly is.

As one moves along the pathway, stranger sights can be seen. Here a dozen flowers of radiant gold glow brightly. As a breeze moves through, the petals seem to flit into the air like butterflies, only to settle back into the proper places when stillness returns.

Other plantlife draws the eye, much of it new, so alien one might wonder if it is even a plant to begin with. Perhaps the most curious are large, more or less amorphous vine clusters that alter their forms when one draws close, providing something akin to a mirror as they alter their shapes to reflect those who stand nearby.

The path that leads deeper into the manse rises from the ground, made of some ancient tree's limb ensorcelled to change it's normal pattern of growth. The path winds about the dome as it climbs, never quite touching it, but coming close until at last, some hundred feet above the ground below and directly above the center of the dome, the path ends abruptly. The center of the dome is raised like a small tower, but as it is in all other places, there is no opening, no sign of a way to get past this barring. It is a solid wall of bramble and thorn that faces those who stand at the end of this path, and all below is still more of this. A fall would not be far, but on a bed of spikes like that which lies below, it may very well prove fatal.

A brief circuit of the Manse reveals nothing but life: primal, sometimes alien, life. A growing sense of strangeness, or perhaps wrongness, also impinges upon the supernatural senses of the Circle. There is something about the Essence flow of the place. All its power may not be tapped by the Manse, or perhaps someone is doing something special with the power here.

With no other avenue to travel, the Circle takes to the only availible path. Chi-Yosh leads the expedition that winds around the great dome, three yards ahead. His steps across the great limb are careful, guided by Essence to evade any slip or burr. Each movement is underlayed with tension and fate's preperation, in case the defenses prove aggressive. The Solars survey the Manse as they climb, looking for potential weaknesses in the green dome.

On the wind there is the faintest smell of green and growing things, but to Ramar's heightened awareness, they are moving with intent. They radiate purpose, where no normal plant ought to. He cannot tell how many.

"Something's down here with us. Something's moving... almost alive in ways plants should not be." Ramar looks around carefully, his gaze a little more purposeful. His voice falls, "We should be very careful..."

Cresting the top of the 'path', the Circle finds their earlier observations verified. It is as though a barrier stands between them and whatever must be inside.

"So how do you suppose we're going to get in?" Ramar studies the vines in the path curiously. "I do not believe we can get in just by not watering these things..."

"Do you think it is drawn by us?" asks Gallius. She imagines that can only be true. "If this place once served my spark, great magic may have been worked to defend it, and that magic will not care that we are solars, I imagine. I cannot recall this very well." The Queen frowns, then decides that it must be risked, and activates her protective charms. "Do you think it would be foolish of me to call upon my powers of terror at this point?" she asks.

Vines, thorns and other unpleasant aspects of the Manse's fauna bar the way. Something is compelling them to do so; Ramar and Chi-Yosh both look up, almost at once, and discover something. These plants cannot see the Sun. A cloud rests over the entire area, and the pair can feel a thin spindle of Essence rising up from the Manse. Perhaps this energy keeps the cloud in place. But why? For the rain that must result, or to obscure the Sun?

Gallius listens to Chi-Yosh and Ramar speak, then nods as they provide an idea. "Well, since this is for my own wish, I will take the risk," she says. With a sudden rush the Queen glows, her anima banner bursting to life above her, the lion again roaring as its silver glow shatters the gloom.

The twisty growths that block the way stir as Solar radiance pours down upon them. They do indeed begin to move, slowly, but it is still a feeble effort. Perhaps they demand more?

Gallius' banner roars to an even greater glow as she calls upon the essence and sets the terrible, brilliant light about herself, the blinding glare that has set fear in so many who dared face her.

Chi-Yosh, seeing that the force of Gallius's anima is not enough, steps beside her and lets the ambient glow surround him like the brilliant rays of the creeping morning. It melds with the radiance of her mid-day sunlight and warming across the snaking vines.

In contrast to Chi-Yosh's lambent glare of the rising sun, Davron's anima flares with the vivid reds and purples of sunset - though no less bright, for its part, its radiance wraps around Davron protectively, the coruscating glow shimmering on the leaves, daring the thorns to dash themselves against him in vain.

The terrifying glow of Gallius' anima, the dawning glow of Chi-Yosh's and the settling flare of Davron's are now joined by the filmy, fluctuating light of the Eclipsed sun. It flows through the room, bathing it in the light of the Solar's Circle, bringing their light together in this place deprived of the Sun. Beautiful wings of light and Essence spread out, feathered tips reaching towards the cloud that obscures the room, and the glowing halo of his Caste Mark is almost blinding. _**Let this be enough. Let the way be open.**_

At last the vines fully stir themselves, rising upward at the alien touch of sunlight as brought to them through the demigods. And yet something else lies behind them, whispering to them that they should twist around and capture this source of precious light. The vines struggle, twitching and quivering as they rise upward, torn between engulfing the four and stretching Heavenward in joyous response.

The light pouring out is not alone either. Behind it are the whispers of each Solar soul, urging the vines to obey their wishes, compelling obedience even from the living, magic-saturated fauna of this enchanted place. And so the vines obey, spreading wide to admit their source of nourishment.

Beyond is a woody pathway winding its way into the Manse's interior. On either side of it is flowing water - its source is unclear. It sings softly, babbling over stones and outcroppings in its bed as it disappears through gaps in the "floor", near the entrance, bound for unknown depths below.

On that path are two great cats. They resemble the desert-stalking lions of the south, though they are entirely green. They are not animals at all, but animated plants. Some sort of magic has touched the growing life here and uprooted it. Moss hangs about their heads and shoulders like a mane; a twitching vine forms the tail; and razor-sharp thorns substitute with deadly efficiency for claws.

"Lions," Gallius says softly. She looks up at her banner. "I am the Lioness," she says to them, though she doesn't expect them to acknowledge it. "I guess I was always the Lioness, wasn't I?" She studies the strange forms closely, and bends her thought upon them, willing them to not bar her path.

"They obey another master now," calls a voice, whose source seems to be the flowing water here. It is soft and delicate and utterly beautiful. "They will not heed your call now, I'm afraid."

"And who are you, to claim their loyalty?" asks Gallius, turning to face the water. "Who are you to challenge the birthright of the Lioness?"

At the sound of this voice, coming from the flowing water, Ramar's senses snap to their utmost focus. The trickling of water as it rushes against plants, the leaves as they twist and grow with the light, even their roots speak to him. The Solar concentrates, seeking the voice... "Perhaps you might make yourself present then, and we can parley?"

In the waters can be seen a face, as though someone invisible stared down and was reflected back, visibly. It is a beautiful face, that of an elf or goddess. Its flawless lines mark it as one of the Fair Folk, and no other. "I am she who claims this place for her own," the voice replies gently. "Do you contest my right?"

"There is Essence yet tapped by the Manse." Chi-Yosh announces this obvious fact, letting it sit in the ear for a moment. "You are the guardian of this place, and likely feed from the surplus of power. You can continue that, with the Lioness's attunement."

"You speak ignorance with such confidence," marvels the heavenly voice, and the face in the waters smiles.

"I would allow such a thing, with some spirits. Perhaps. But this is my birthright, returning to me through the depths of time," says Gallius. Her voice takes on a strong, more confident tone. "You can leave her now, and I will not trouble you. If you dare to resist my claim, I will not let you survive. The choice is yours, for the moment. Decide."

"Then perhaps you should grace us with your presence. For though my companion may speak hostile words, we mean you no harm, so long as you mean us no harm as well." The Circle of the Eclipse Caste is present on his forehead. "It is possible that we can come to a peaceful arrangement, if you BOTH will be willing to listen to reason."

"You and your companion seem at odds," says the voice. "Do you wish to deal fairly with me, or do you wish to challenge me in my own domain? Decide, then ask what you wish again." And laughter sounds through the Manse, like the sprinkling of a waterfall across rocks.

Davron allows his actions to speak for him - he takes a step toward Gallius' side, pulling an arrow from his quiver. The meaning is plain - he supports Gallius' claim against all comers, and feels no need to embellish that support with any words.

"If we wish to deal fairly with her, I believe we may. I do not think that we need to be overtly hostile here my friends. If we discover why she has taken residence here, then we may be able to work with her. Perhaps this Manse could have another guardian, or resident..." Ramar considers this carefully. "I wish to avoid this fight. It is not necessary."

"You may try your hands at negotiation if you must, Ramar," says Gallius simply. "But make no mistake, I cannot have my sworn enemy pretend to defend my property. Think carefully what you are proposing. Do we now treat with the Abyssals, as well?"

"We are decided... for the time being at least." Ramar calls to the water. "Now then, come forth so that we might talk. Perhaps there is an agreement we can come to..."

"We can talk from here, can we not?" asks the voice, sounding very reasonable, and the face smiles from the waters again. "Speak."

"Alright then. You are here for a reason yes... yet you say my friend speaks from ignorance. Why is it you are here, why is it you have claimed this place, of all other places as your own?" Ramar asks.

"I am here because it suits me," replies the voice. "I found this place and made it my home, when none other occupied it. I found its defenses nonexistent. You ask why here, I ask why not?"

"I see." Ramar turns to his companions, then back towards the waters, "And what will you do now? What will you do with this place? You must realize that we are not the only ones who will come... there are those who will come seeking to bing life, as we have... perhaps you can help us find the stone of an old song?"

"The stone is at the heart of the Manse," replies the voice. "There is no need to seek for it. But you will not claim it while I am here."

"Now it is my turn to ask why not?" Ramar speaks, "It is surely a trifle compared to your own Magics..."

Another face appears in the water. It is also beautiful, in its way, but pale, and cold, and death-tainted. It is the face of an Abyssal Exalt, a deathknight, and his stern and implacable voice joins the beautiful bells of the Fae. "They will not listen to reason. They seek only to claim."

"We are perfectly willing to listen to reason. When the statement 'you will not claim it while I am here' is one that begs further reasoning, further introspection. Only savages listen and speak without thinking. That is why I have asked, and now await my answer." Ramar regards the deathknight in the water, and it takes some effort to hide the rising fear.

"I stay because it is my wish, even as it is your wish to come here and take possession of this place," the Fair Folk noblewoman's voice says quietly. "Is that not true?"

"This place was mine for years uncounted. It was given to me by the highest of authorities in the first age," says Gallius. "It was my right. When I rose to enter the Solar Deliberative, they gave me this Manse. At that time, things were far different, of course. There are many here, then, and there was order. Things did not end well, but the right is still mine."

"That is an oversimplification of things," counters Ramar, as the noblewoman's voice lays its quiet trap. "We are here for many reasons. More than because 'it is our wish'. I had hoped we might reach a peaceful arrangement that would allow us to benefit one another... are you not willing to do so?"

The voices fade; the faces in the water vanish. The streams that flow past the walkway gather together, flooding over the woody surface and rising up into the watery outline of a person. A girl, small and lithe, with an everpresent smile on her face that shines even the aquatic form she wears. "Gallius, you feel hatred, loathing, disgust. I can see into your heart. You burned with a need to destroy when you saw those faces, didn't you."

"You.." Gallius studies the form, looking confused, and more wary. "Yes, I saw an enemy, here where my past and future both come together. Two of my most dangerous enemies, the forces of darkness and chaos who would kill or corrupt all men. What else could I feel towards such as those?"

"I am the last defense of the Manse," the girl says in a soft, watery voice. "I am that which keeps the stone safe from hate. The power of the stone is not to uproot the corrupted plant, but to purify it. If you use its power with hate in your heart, it will betray you." The girl from the streams steps forward, then, and leaves damp footprints behind on the wood. Her thin arm stretches up and strokes Gallius' cheek admiringly, leaving it damp as well, and her translucent eyes study her 'inheritor'. "Will you destroy, or will you heal? That is the choice the stone compels."

"Lady..." Ramar turns to regard the girl as she manifests before them. He offers, "I thank you for showing yourself to us." He then turns to regard Gallius, then the girl. "It makes so much sense..." _Such hatred... a dangerous thing._ There is a half-forgotten murmur, "Dangerous indeed." He speaks up then, "I believe we would use it to heal. It is why we have come here to begin with. To bring the Song back to Creation, to gift it with life where none had flourished before."

Gallius pauses for a time, considering. "I will heal," she answers. "But the world is full of conflict, the future demands battle, as did the past. The ages have not changed this. There are many wars to fight, and will fight them. I will destroy those who would destroy the people I love. Perhaps this makes me unfit to return. Perhaps this means I, too, and about to fall to the power that led the Solars to their destruction so long ago."

"Do you question yourself?" smiles the guardian, sadly. "Then you are wiser than I was. But the heart is a complex thing. In it can be hatred, and love, together. Will you reveal your love to me?"

"I love my friends, I love my people, I love life," says Gallius gently. "And you, too, I love, no matter what happened. I remember you. I will not forget." Her smile is sad, "Love is what the world needs most, now. I want to give that love to my people, so they will be courageous and save themselves from the despair that our enemies will use against us."

Gallius is not yet done, though. "There is one more challenge for you, then," says the guardian. "You will again face that vision, and this time, I will be with you. If you feel the same hate you did, you will perish. The choice is yours."

Gallius considers the guardian carefully, then nods. By impulse, or perhaps by memory, she steps forward, moving in-time with the guardian, the two leaning towards each other, and then kissing. Only the kiss draws in the guardian, who flows like water into Gallius. As was promised, the image of the deathknight returns to the water, and the test begins.

The test is perhaps the most unique of the Solar's life. And perhaps the greatest test of character. She considers this face, this enemy, and remembers what she knows. They, too, are solar sparks, after all. They too feel a sense of compassion, twisted and ruined by those who have tormented them. The Deathlords. The liars and cheaters of creation. For a time, Gallius hangs in the balance, between hatred and loathing and something else. Something that blooms in her suddenly and strongly. Pity and compassion. The Lioness falls to her knees by the water, her head bowing and tears flowing down her cheeks. She whispers faintly, "I'm sorry. I will save you. I will heal you, even those who lie in the hands of death, will I heal."

Ramar speaks without hesitation, "If there is a way to heal those who lie in the hands of death, then I will help you find it." The Solar, thus moved, remains still in quiet contemplation. A contrast. He regards the Manse curiously. "And to think... I would've relied on negotiation to save us... I, I am sorry." He draws in a breath, or two. "I suppose it's on to the center then... where the Song awaits your voice, Lady Gallius."

Davron slowly returns the arrow to its quiver, and kneels beside the water. "We all walk a narrow line over the darkness," he whispers. "The abyss awaits us on either side, whether we stray too far on one side and give in, or too far on the other and lose our soul in the struggle against destruction." He closes his eyes.

Gallius doesn't push herself up, staring into the waters and weeping silently. For sadness and shame, both, it would seem. She makes no move to wipe her eyes, nor even to rise. Only after many long, quiet minutes have passed does she finally push herself up. Half blinded by tears, she pushes on, seeking the hearthstone chamber, following footsteps by memory more clear than vision.

Chi-Yosh stands to the side, watching the tide sift back and forth, heavy and powerful. Now, it would seem that the Chosen of Death are not to be stamped and mauled beneath the claws of the Nation, it will at least bestow the kindness of offered redemption, rather than the simple savagry of war. The dawn steps before the water, and stares back into his reflection among the falling liquid. It is as it always was, the two forces at odds, able to stay seperate until the two will meet: sink or swim. But for now, the Solar, the Circle, can keep themselves at arm's length, and meet with an occasional diving foray.

Ramar walks beside Gallius, offering her silent support as she pushes on. "Lead the way, Lady Gallius. You know this place better than we do..."

In the Hearthstone chamber Gallius finds the stone, and another vision. "Weapons are only tools; the stone cares most about the heart that uses them," whispers the guardian's voice to her alone, and in her mind she can see, in the jungles of the Southeast, a Solar wearing the stone, beckoning sharp-looking plants from the ground. They grow, and grow, seeding themselves, and instead of fruit or flowers, upon their branches grow swords made of wood, with thorny cutting edges. "Even today such plants may still be found," whispers the voice again. "If you make use of them, remember what I have said."

The Manse is attuned in time; Gallius takes possession of it, claiming the stone again. With little effort, she severs the chord of Essence binding the cloud overhead. Other defenses are awake now and the Manse need no longer open solely with the Solar passkey. The lion-guardians may be grown in quantity and will replenish themselves, and they are fearsome fighters.

An exhausted Solar Circle makes its way out of the Manse again, returning to their camp and then to their airship. Other Manses may be found nearby, but one in particular demands their attention. It is the Manse that will heal Harmony of Thought, and the Circle departs with new resolve in their hearts. They have faced a powerful guardian, and triumphed somehow; this is an auspicious omen for another imminent act of healing.
