# Gods of Eden 2004-08-11

On the return trip home, the Su'Katan is hard at training. Chi-Yosh exercises more of the Art of the Mantis, first putting the Circle in hard-to-break pins and grapples, until he has fully developed the holding maneuver. By the time this is accomplished, they have returned to the nation. The next few days are spent developing a devastating attack. Much like the Hungry Tiger strike, a quick, brutal attack designed to do the most damage.

With simple meditation, the Dawn blossoms inward, his self-control and Essence-power increases slightly. This small exercise leads into the next few days of creating a second combination of charms, leaping with the raw power of Essence, and delivering the harsh attack, finally honed and brought to bare against a dilapidated barn.

Davron seeks out Ramar on their return to the Nation, and requests his assistance - he had observed how readily he and Chi-Yosh had avoided the blows of the Wyld Hunt, even when it was certain that they would strike. Ramar quickly assents, and the next day, the arena is theirs, with Ramar demonstrating the _kata_ of Seven Shadow Evasion. Unfortunately, Davron can't keep up with Ramar at all - try as he might, Ramar's motions are simply too quick to imitate.

That night, Davron falls asleep swiftly, exhausted to the bone from the grueling and frustrating workout - but even in his dreams he has little rest, finding himself re-enacting the day's training. Oddly enough, in his dreams he fares much better... and yet his dream-limbs feel peculiar, almost as if they are not his own, and he hears a strange, slightly sinister, and yet familiar voice whispering in his ear. And the next day in the arena, the lightness of limbs stays with him, and he performs the _kata_ with ease. When pressed on the difference, Davron only shrugs with a slightly worried smile.

Four days later, as Davron struggles back into his golden plate armor after the final training session with Ramar, he spots Dace passing through the halls, wearing his own very similar armor as if it were light as a linen tunic. Davron soon discovers that this too is the result of a Charm, and arranges an appointment with Dace to teach this charm as well. Once again, Davron practices the moves of his _katas_, only this time he wears the heavy armor, learning to channel Essence through the orichalcum-alloy plates, using Solar magic to lighten the load.

The Queen of the Nation of the Sun spends her time as she always does when she returns to her throne. She wakes at the dawn, working for hours at a time in practice, finding new ways to bend essence to her will and strengthen the force of her blows. After this, she attends to the needs of the growing nation, a task which takes her time until the evening shadows fall. In these late hours, Gallius wanders out of doors, away from guards, singing life into many areas that lacked it.

On long walks such as these, some not ending until past midnight, Gallius finds herself hunted. It seems that her lands are far from safe, and so even while she is bringing life, she is finding battle not far away. These events spark her to seek the aid of Ramar, from whom she learns how to avoid even attacks that she does not see.

The rest of the Queen's free time is spent preparing Dace for his role as her general, helping him become an even greater leader of men. In the course of this, Gallius begins to think of new ways to use the gifts she has been given. The technique is not mastered, but she begins to grasp the way of directing her will to the troops about her.

The Wandering Solar has been busy over the past three weeks. Although he has seldom been seen. It is as though it is only when he is really needed that he is present. For Davron, the stance of Seven Shadows is a difficult task to teach. "It is not simply a matter of using Essence, you must condition your muscles to respond to them. You must bring together your prana musculature and your _qi_ motions. The way your personal energy flows is influenced by the attacks. You must not only learn to evade them, but to recognize them, to see where it is their path will take them." And so Ramar teaches Davron to evade attacks with the ease of mere shadows.

When again Ramar appears, he has acquired a new Hearthstone. When asked, he merely smiles, and explains, "Oh, I've been here and there." He is sought out by Gallius for further training. At several points during the next three days, Ramar will launch an attack on the Lady, testing her readiness. "You must learn to listen to the whims of Essence. To become aware of your surroundings, and your instincts. When your body learns to recognize the whispers of Essence as an attack happens, your body will then learn to evade. Stand thusly." Ramar demonstrates, "And then, when I attack, move with the blow. But do not watch me." And so, Ramar trains the lady Gallius to defend from attacks unseen and unanticipated.

Outside the circle, activity moves at a rapid pace. It seems that something has caused things to move at a buzz. Cloudburst's collections are growing at an incredible pace, aided by spirits of air and earth, both holders of much lore that has long been left untended. Marina's negotiations take off, aided by the stone that was won for her by the circle. There is a sense of renewed purpose in the nation, and it is contagious, so that even the common man starts to believe that something new, something truly worthwhile is taking place, and their efforts can really help make their lot in life better. The center of power starts to pump energy like a heart, and all about the effects happen. It is something not quite magical, but not so far shy of it.

The power behind all this cannot come from inside Creation, but only from heaven itself, and Gallius puts aside her armor and sets her feet on an altar recently made for prayers to Helios himself. A span of gold that glitters in his light, and it is there that she burns offerings of the finest of the crops, calling upon the Unconquered Sun to send his noble will into the hearts of the people who live under her crown, so that they may have hope in the face of all darkness, and live courageously, knowing that a new day is rising.

Dace, too, has received an education. Between his own acts of self-discovery with the Master and his time with Gallius, he too has mastered some of his own Essence, and the skill of transforming mortal men and women into Tiger-Warriors. Once the armies of Man were filled with such soldiers; their ranks do not swell in the Second Age as they once did, but hundreds of them already fill the ranks of the Nation, and Dace will be able to inspire more.

Around the region known as the Hundred Kingdoms, those sovereign states or held territories having membership in the Confederation of Rivers have banded together in a show of solidarity. To meet the simultaneous threat and promise the Nation offers, the Confederation seems to have found a new purpose for itself beyond military alliance. Its representatives seem determined to resist the expansion of the Nation's alliance-building and exclusive trade contracts beyond certain borders. Yet as a consequence of this, trade can now flow more freely than ever. Prices for individual merchants are down; profits are up. And few of the wealthiest men and women doing business in this fertile region pass up a chance to re-invest these savings in further expansion.

The Circle returns, at the appointed time, to the Manse which they worked so hard to alter. The stone is ready; the spirit guardians they appointed bow obediently, then fade away into oblivion. Formally, Davron takes the stone, setting Harmony of Thought before him on a padded mat. At the center of the Manse, whose deep magics are bent to the restoration of the mind, the scholar exerts the Hearthstone's powers. Ninety and nine heartbeats pass before the glint of madness passes from Harmony of Thought's eyes, and the man looks up with a clarity and intelligence unseen before.

Davron wipes the sweat from his brow and nods to the man sitting opposite him. "How do you feel, Harmony of Thought?" he says, exhilarated by the sensation of bringing a man back into the light of reason.

"I.... feel strange," the man confesses, smiling and rubbing his head experimentally. "A great weight has been lifted from my soul, and I thank you."

"Welcome back." Ramar smiles softly, and addresses Harmony of Thought. "Do you understand what has happened to you, that time has passed since last you were... well, able to collect your thoughts as so?" The Solar's voice is gentle, soothing to the ears. It is also in a way clinical, particularly with the concern for the man's well being.

"I.. I remember traveling across the ice," the man recounts, thinking carefully. "I remember being thrown into a dark cave. I remember the demons that haunted me, though they no longer hold power over me.." He shivers just a little in remembrance. "I was in the north."

Ramar's eyes are wary, or perhaps weary at the mention of demons that have haunted the man. "Yes. I believe... I can understand what it is you speak of. And yes, you were in the North. We have brought you to the South, and to the East. You spoke of demons... are you feeling up to discussing those demons? If not, this is fine. It is not something we are going to force you to discuss, but, it may help us, if you can."

"The last thing I remember is.. going into the caves beneath Diamond Hearth," confesses Harmony of Thought. "Then my memory is broken. I fear nothing past that will be reliable or complete."

"Why were you going into the caves beneath Diamond Hearth?" Ramar phrases this question almost casually, though within it he lays the seeds for the question to come. Best to take care when sowing the seeds of conversation, that the harvest will be much more worthwhile.

"I was... a savant, working with the miners," the man says. "I had much wisdom. I had studied in the great cities. I'm afraid much of that is gone now.." He sighs, as the conversation that draws out his past begins to reveal to the man just what he has been deprived of by his madness and its cure.

"There is still much left," says Gallius softly. "There are many things to do, and much to learn. And relearn, perhaps. What has happened is sorrowful, yes, but there is much to live for, Harmony of Thought."

"We will work then, towards unbreaking your memory. If indeed such a thing can be done. But that will come in time. You say you were a savant, that you had studied in great cities? Can you remember any of your studies particularly well?" Ramar continues his questioning, keeping his voice careful and calm as he does.

"I remember some of it," he confesses.

Davron breaks in, quietly. "You emerged from the caves with a notebook, Harmony - a notebook containing knowledge of magic. What, if anything, can you remember about how you found the way to that book - and what happened to you afterward?"

After seeing the book itself, and thumbing through its pages several times, a glimmer of remembrance strikes Harmony of Thought. "Ah!" he says. "This... this was... " He thinks, struggling to rein in his own wayward recollection. "This.. this was part of a collection. It came in a wooden crate.. from... from..... Aurgh!" He clutches his head a moment.

"Yes!" Despite his attack, the man speaks again, swiftly. "A sorcerer. A dead one. It was part of his collection. Sent to Diamond Hearth! I never knew his name, but the rest of the collection would still be in the hands of the miner near Diamond Hearth who received it!"

The outpost is a low-roofed wooden building, short and squat. The sloped roof is blanketed in snow; behind it, the ice-covered hills of the North rise up into the forbidding sky. On the left and right sides, icicles hang from the slight overhang of the roof. Around the jutting porch, snowbanks gather. The impression is that of the face of a mountain-gnome sitting in repose, its eyes the windows of the place surmounted by icy eyebrows, its beard the snowdrifts. The image would be complete if the thin curl of smoke above rose from a long-stemmed pipe rather than a stone chimney.

Inside, even the tepid warmth of the fire is an inadequate ward against cold and desolation. The weight of the snow above, and the solitude of the North, hang on everything. Shadows seem longer, stretching their dark fingers possessively across the walls to clutch away light and hope; gloom reigns as king even in this poor hearth.

Aside from the chairs and the fireplace, there are planks of wood supported by rotting wine-casks and rudely carved stone slabs that serve as table and shelves. And occupying its own corner of the room is a trap door. Its most notable features are the heavy chains that criss-cross it and terminate in thick and formidable locks. A few moments later, the stillness of the room is disturbed by a heavy thumping sound, coming from below the trapdoor.

A few men and women can be found here. All are dressed in fur; the men are universally bearded. They sit before the fireplace in their wood and whalebone chairs, trying vainly to soak up a measure of heat. One man, the owner of this abode if his fur-covered seat is any indication, is rotund, with oily skin and a balding, disease-spotted head. The sacks of skin that have accumulated on his cheeks and under his eyes give him the aspect of an uncouth walrus. "Y'are alright here, if y'do not fight," he speaks, in a voice that is more throaty croak than man's speech.

"Aye. We're not after a fight," replies Ramar. He walks in, spending a moment or two getting somewhat warmer. Although in this place it will take more than a hearthfire to provide warmth. "We're looking for Rot. I don't suppose you'd happen to know where we can find 'em?"

"Me gran's down in there," the walrus-man explains, pointing at the trap-door. "Died fourteen years ago spring. We puts him in'a ground but he come back. Shouldn't be movin' about still. He know it, we know it, so's we keeps him down i' there. But y'can talk t'him if you want. Just don't let him out."

"Thanks for th' warning." Ramar nods to the man, then makes for the trapdoor. "We'll keep 'im down there. Thanks." He makes his way down inside carefully, but not before inviting his Circle to, "Come along then?"

The man rises with a grunt, shambling over to the trap-door and opening the locks with a black iron key kept around his neck on a chain of hair. "Y'be nice to me gran," he advises.

"Certainly." Ramar nods, "Thanks."

With Gallius waiting above, three other Solars descend the rickety ladder leading into the chamber beneath the shack, feeling the earth engulfing them, feeling the air nipping at their skin in order to steal the heat from their very flesh. And here they find the man called Rot.

The old man's skin is a cadaverous, icy blue. His body is half-encrusted with ice. He lies pinioned to the wall of the cellar with a barbed spear thrust through his chest. Other shackles hold his limbs, and terminate with crude bolts in the frozen stone. His eyes are nearly blank orbs; his hair has long since frozen stiff. _Strangers,_ he mumbles, his voice hollow and windy as his lips creak open to move. _Day's greetin's.._

"Day's greetings to you as well... Rot, is it?" Ramar bows his head. "I'm Wandered. Pleased to meet you." He peers curiously at the cadaverous man. He shudders just a little. "We've come to ask you a few things, if you don't mind giving us some answers. About a set of books you had? Books that were shipped to Diamond Hearth not too terribly long ago..."

_The ... yes, I remember..._ Rot coughs and chokes, exuding a small cloud of ice particles and dust from his dead throat. _So long.. Korash, the White Wizard. He died in Crystal during the excavations.. He... his belongings, shipped across the ice to Diamond Hearth, in a crate.. books, manuscripts, curious things of all sorts.._ The risen dead-man writhes a little against his restraints. _Said he knew the secrets of Bagrash Kol's flying fortress.. said he knew about many things, when he was alive. Sent his things to me because of the services I did.. Korash.. old friend..._

"Korash, the White Wizard? I see. What... did he evere mention where it was he found these secrets, these books or manuscripts?" Ramar asks, respectfully. "Or... do you know if he's er... still able to be spoken with?"

Davron quietly adds, "And when did you last see the books? Are they still nearby, or were they taken away?"

_Sold... all gone,_ the undead miner murmurs. _In good hands.. if Korash's soul still wanders, seek him among the lands of the dead.._

Davron nods. "Good hands? Would you speak willingly of whose hands they were?"

_Merchants.. trustworthy men.. scholars... sages I knew..._ Rot coughs again, and the Solars realize how Harmony of Thought came upon the book. _Wouldn't squander.. Korash's legacy so lightly.._

"Is there anyone who'd know where he got the books to begin with? Besides old Korash himself..." Ramar then considers, "Would you be willing to tell us where to find the other sages and scholars the books were sent off to?"

_Names.. names are hard now,_ the restless spirit confesses. _But only Korash knew where it all came from..._

Chi-Yosh, so far silent, has been concerned. What caused Rot to deny Gaia's offer? What has left him solid on this world? Could it be that the agents of Death have beaten them to this lead? Stepping beside Ramar and Davron, the asks the chill-enshrouded corpse, "What is it that has caused you to stay among the living?"

Davron nods. "We thank you, sir. Is there anything we can do to ease your rest?" He asks the question delicately, pitching his voice to ensure that the grandson can hear.

_What makes a man live?_ asks Rot, sounding almost philosophical for a moment. _Whatever it is, I had more of it than death reckoned on.._

Upstairs, Gallius is speaking with those who dwell here. She asks them of their trades and culture, while explaining something of why her circle has come here. She does not use a false name, but calls herself Queen Gallius Leom, which at first earns a doubtful glance, but as she speaks her bearing and charisma make the title seem obvious. She asks if they would wish for Rot to be allowed to escape his current bonds and be free, and explains how she can grant this to him, without pain.

There ensues a short, animated discussion among the living upstairs, and dubious glances from the dead below, but nobody has any great objection to what Gallius proposes. "S'long as he dun hurt," is the conclusion Rot's grandson expresses.

Ramar chuckles, "Indeed. Er..." Ramar then asks, curiously, "What's it like, staying on after you've uh..." Ramar searches for the right word, and decides on, "Died?"

_Pretty much like wading in shit,_ croaks Rot.

"You know, she can help you find peace, if you want." Explains Ramar, making sure that what he means is quite clear. "Get your feet dry again."

"He will not hurt," assures Gallius. "I will pass him into the gentle hands of Gaia, and her mercy will ease away all the sadness that comes with a long life." She moves to the trapdoor, considering it for a moment. With a smile she calls upon the strength of essence and sets about herself the majesty and brilliance of the Unconquered Sun. Thus prepared, she begins her slow descent, allowing her own radiance to light the way.

Gallius pauses to consider Rot slowly. She moves forward, then, embracing him and starting to sing a soft lullaby. As her words bring warmth into the lifeless, icy place, her hands begin to glow, and the form of Rot simply gives way to the light, until Gallius is holding nothing at all in her arms. For a time, she simply stands there, smiling sadly. Eventually she says, "May the embrace of Gaia draw you home, Rot, guardian of wisdom. You have done more than any could have asked you to."

Nothing remains but the shackles and the spear. By the time the process is over, those upstairs are standing, and their hats are held in their hands.

Ramar kneels at the presence of the soft song of the Lady Gallius. His head is bowed low, and he whispers a prayer for the departing soul as it passes into Gaia's embrace. He stands then, and nods to Gallius, then looks at the empty spot where Rot once was. "Be at peace," he whispers.

Gallius turns from the shackles, making her way back above ground with careful steps. Her voice is calm and touched with awe as she says to her friends, "He clung to life past death for this very moment. Our meeting was bound by a fate stronger than even the gentle coils of mortality. This is meant to be." When her eyes turn to the relatives of Rot, they are filled with pity, and her words are kind, "Be at peace. He is free now. It is not a time for sadness, but for joy. His sacrifice will bring all the world a new sunrise. Our greatest hopes are about to be realized." And as she speaks the radiance around her surges, growing stronger as the faith within her is kindled more strongly than ever before.

The simple folk here are unprepared for such displays and unaware of how to act properly. Despite this they are exceedingly cordial to the Solars as they leave for the snowy wastes outside the cabin. As the airship darts through the windswept sky, the Circle decides its next move. One way or another, they will have to seek out a departed soul.
