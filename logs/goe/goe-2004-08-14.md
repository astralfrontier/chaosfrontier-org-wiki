# Gods of Eden 2004-08-14

It was a sensation that brought Chi-Yosh here. Flying over the lands to the North, the scenery had strummed a cord inside of him. Maybe he had read a story of the place, and could not recall. Perhaps it was something imprinted on the remnants of a former spark. Whatever it was, it drew him to this spot. Taking a break from the exercising of new powers, the Dawn climbed into a Volo and parked it nearby. Now, climbing up a hill, he surveys the field.

Long ago, rivers ran down from the mountains, carving furrows through the native granite. While the waters have dried up, the ravines remain, great curved walls that shield the pyramid. Marble of the richest green, shot through with veins of gold that pulse with Essence from deep within. The Solar climbs down one of the granite cliffs to stand at the base of the layered marble monolith, and begins to climb.

The pyramid's top is a glyphed patchwork. At the center is a circular disk, patterned with the description of the Art of the Hawk. It had long since disappeared, left only in the long memories of the Sidereal. Looking at the corners of the platform, there are circular disks. On the outside rim, parts of a symbol is, while the other half is on the inside. After two hours, the four disks have been turned to detail the four Arts of Ka\`, an ancient master of martial arts, rumored to have spawned techniques the Sidereals still use today. At the final click of the fourth disk, the central disk stirs. As he stands upon it, the circular platform begins to sink into the pyramid.

The first chamber is a great cylinder. Its walls are of stone; the floor is rocky and uneven, littered with pits and spiked protrusions that could spell doom for the unwary. The atmosphere is heavy and regular. The Essence of Earth pervades this place.

Four more chambers are adjacent, as the four doorways in the cardinal directions attest. Each door is sealed shut with a glowing rune at its center. To the north, the door is of ice. To the south, a radiantly hot sheet of lava. To the east, wood. To the west, the door itself is water, moving calmly in place.

And kneeling in lotus on a spur of rock, rapt in meditation, is a pale figure. It seems to be a young man, though he bears the marks of death. A long black braid hangs from his head, where his black hair is drawn back into it. His face is painted. It takes a moment for Chi-Yosh to recognize the pattern, and its significance. In the jungles of the southeast, there are feral hunters and barbarian tribes who sport painted masks of stylized skulls as an omen of death to put fear into their enemies. This man's painted face is an artistic mockery of a living man's face, a ghastly reverse of life and death. He opens his eyes after a moment and stares at the new arrival with those blood-red orbs.

Chi-Yosh surveys the harbringer of death while he remains still. Similar hair is just one of the similiarities and differences in this dark reflection played out between locked eyes. After several still moments, the Dawn bows. The same motion swells Essence, sweeping it through his form and weight light and sure. This does not bode well, but rather than step on the wrong twig, Chi-Yosh allows the Deathknight set the tone.

"I have been waiting for your arrival," says the Abyssal, rising from his lotus and turning his head this way and that; cracking sounds from his neck can be heard. "The Green Lady foretold your arrival." He curls his fingers into fists, cracking bones there as well. "I am your opponent."

Carefully the Abyssal dons a pair of wickedly-barbed Tiger's Claws, strapping them around his pale hands as he awaits his lately-arrived rival.

"If I am going to be your opponent," replies the Dawn as he eases into a defensive stance. "Then I shall make myself a worthy one." Essence draws through the inlay of defenses, as the golden bars of his staff angle in preperation. The ghost of a smile hints across his lips. "The Green Lady didn't happen to foretell the outcome, did she?"

A thin line purses the Abyssals lips. "If she had, I would not be here," he says. The combatants survey each other for several seconds, invoking their stores of Essence, endowing themselves with hidden supernatural might.

Racing towards the edge of the chasm, Chi-Yosh's whirl of the golden links hides the draw of a kama. A snap of the weapon wraps it about his arm just as the kama whirls towards the skull-faced knight.

The Abyssal vaults backward in a skillful flip, planting his clawed hands in the stone behind him to let the kama pass harmlessly overhead. The move is marred only by a miscalculation, and a thin spray of blood follows the acrobatic arc as the Exalt regains his feet. Without hesitation he launches a rough kick at the stone beneath him, dislodging a rock the size of a small man's fist from the ground and propelling it into the air. He leaps to follow it, executing a violent spinning kick against the rock with the sole of his feet to send it on a dizzying course almost directly for Chi-Yosh's forehead.

Surprise is the Abyssal's advantage. With the speed it's going, even the Essence marionetting the Solar's evasion may not move in time. In an eye's bat of decisiveness, Chi-Yosh charges the on-rushing stone. Mirroring the Knight's tactic with a twist, his run melts into a crouch, before at the last moment Chi-Yosh leaps forward, arcing over the jagged stone to land on his hands.

The death-touched warrior leaps forward, reversing his earlier backflip and crossing the chasm in a single cartwheeling flip. He lands on the rough stone only a few yards away, moving his arms rapidly as he adopts the defensive posture of his style.

Chi-Yosh watches his opponent closely. There's a certain brutality, first from the kick, and then the simple way with which he leaps. The raw power given grace is clear as the Abyssal readies himself: the Tiger. Powerful, to say the least. Still testing the waters, the Dawn darts forward over the craggy terrain, sliding down an outcropping to crouch. Mid-motion, the staff sweeps around in a rake towards the Abyssal's knees. More a practice shot, his reflexes prepared to snap into a deflection.

Smirking, the warrior brings his hands together, batting away the oncoming golden weapon with a sharp ringing sound as it clashes against the deadly blades on his hands. He immediately retaliates: a flurry of blows, each sheathed in the wickedly edged steel he wears.

Immediately legs straighten, the Dawn hopping while the Orichalcum whip lashes up. It cups the Knight's forearm, jerking to the side to take the bite from his lash. The second is not prepared for, finding a chink when Chi-Yosh's arms are left out to the side. Rather than jerk away, he leans into the blow, curling around it, growing light, letting the force throw him off his feet. Over the jagged floor he artfully bounces, before falling into one of the open pits.

A few hits make their way past the Solar's defenses, and the Abyssal martial artist lets a smile pass his lips as his opponent shares in the experience of being blooded.

Arms and legs lash out, as Chi-Yosh falls past the lip of the pit. He was aiming for it, for the hole was big enough to span his torso and half that. Essence sings through his anima, even though it dims to nothingness, leaving the Solar hanging, invisible. The trap is set, if the Bone Tiger takes the bait.

The pale fighter leaps with a cat's grace into the pit, glancing about and taking stock. His eyes are narrow as he scans the place where his opponent disappeared to and should be, ever alert for trickery.

Chi-Yosh's muscles draw taut like bowstrings, then release him in a corkscrew turn. The same motion winds his staff tight, before it's snapped outwards, curling around him and falling into the opposite hand. At the last moment the Dawn unfurls, momentum packed into the downward angled handle as it lashes downwards upon the Abyssal from behind.

The death-touched Exalt is struck from behind, spinning with a savage growl as his Tiger Claws reap their fill of revenge. He wobbles a little, stunned momentarily by the force put into the surprise attack, but recovers quickly. A cloud of Essence, black as the grave, gathers around his body...

The Essence explodes into the aura of a great cat, flickering and ghostly, its red eyes gleaming in the black cloud. The Abyssal lurches forward, still offbalance a bit by the impact of the blow, but nevertheless determined to drive the deadly Essence-charged claws he bears into the very heart of his enemy. "Vengeful Tiger's Ghost!" he shouts, as the massed haze of Essence coalesces in its bid for Chi-Yosh's life.

Chi-Yosh evades - barely. He feels a cut opening itself on his cheek; he feels a light trickle of blood beginning to stream down his face. The force of the Vengeful Tiger's Ghost attack is spent, but its memory lives in the red stain.

Chi-Yosh is shaken by the whispery kiss. But, in a moment of bravado, or solidness coated in brass, the Solar breaks his defensive posture for a moment. Gesturing to his opponent, "You have been struck." Propping a foot against the narrow pit's wall, he takes up a casual pose. "Let me know when you are stable once more."

The Exalt backs off, then begins drawing Essence to himself again. With a sudden burst of unnatural speed he lurches forward, his bladed hands a cloud of deadly steel as they rake toward Chi-Yosh. "Four Paw Swat!" he shouts, his voice amplified by the blackly coruscant aura surrounding his body as he seems to be in four places at once.

The roar of Death-tinged Essence tanning Chi-Yosh's skin lights the fire of urgency beneath him. Leaning into the propped foot, he kicks off, only to about-face and kick off the stone wall. It sends him arcing over the Abyssal, palms slapping the pit's face to push him back. With each land of feet and hands, the snag of a crag or crevice, dust and stone stir up like a gritty mist. Cracks are beginning to leave their mark on the stone beneath each touch as he shrinks from raking, power fueled barbs.

Each dart costs him an opening somewhere. An over-extended leg, an exposed arch of his flank. And every chink that bares itself becomes a home for the barbs, digging in. The final evasion sends him to the ground, rather than to freedom, a crumpled, bloody heap at the bone tiger's feet.

A great voice resonates through the Manse. **You have conquered. Choose your next challenge!** The Abyssal raises his bloodstained tiger claws to the sky in a triumphant pose, shouting to the sky in a throaty tiger's roar. "I choose Fire!" he bellows in response, and the ground shifts. A radiant blue light engulfs both combatants; Chi-Yosh can feel his mortal wounds healing themselves as the magics that enforce the sanctity of the duel repair his body..

The earth beneath heaves and rocks, and several stones detach themselves from the ground - including two boulders on which the combatants stand. Both manage to retain their balance, feeling themselves flung along with the rocks. The south door unseals itself; the magma flows aside as the warding rune vanishes.

Chi-Yosh doesn't take the time to be surprised. Quickly accessing his surroundings. THe boulders are close enough together that a long-reaching strike might hit. Good enough. Rather than lashing at the Abyssal, Chi-Yosh takes two running strides and leaps high, only to slam down upon the edge of the Abyssal's boulder. Immediately he begins to run in place, thighs bunching tight and pumping downward to roll the stone forward quickly, attempting to toss his adversary into the grinding vice between the stones.

The quick-witted Abyssal counters, body-blocking and moving deftly across the surface of the rapidly-moving rock to maintain his balance. The stone crashes with a resounding echo into the ground, and Chi-Yosh can immediately feel the radiant heat washing over his skin as the battle moves to the Arena of Fire, to the north.

Rather than a cylinder of broken earth, this chamber is triangular, but still large. It's a maze of lava flows, magma, and half-cooled volcanic stone. The footing is treacherous and twisting. The only places to stand are the stones cast from the Arena of Earth, and those are already moving slowly and bobbing as they float across the scalding magma here.

There is no time to play, not in the melting room, not with a powerful adversary. But as Chi-Yosh takes up a readied stance, and slowly begins to rock back and forth, there is all the time. Adopting the stance of Patient Mantis, he watches the attack go through, the parry. With each forward and backward rock, Essence becomes a crescendo, sending the stone into a bob, rippling the thick molten soup around them. He blazes forwards, all the momentum melting from his hop, into the unfurling of his fist and foot. It blossoms, the power rocking the platform, sending a curtain of magma up, as the Solar's momentum grounds itself, and continues on in the eruption of an uppercut, pinpointed with an orichalcum handle.

Deftly the deathlike martial artist dances across the face of the stone slab as it bobs uncertainly in the lava. To the Tiger, the Mantis is little more than a noisy hindrance, and he wastes no time in swatting at it.

Again the twin claws rake across Chi-Yosh, watering the field of his skin with the red warmth of his blood. His eyes alight, the Abyssal draws back, gloating. His weapons are streaked with more blood, and he anticipates reaping a harvest of pain.

Chi-Yosh is driven back by the strike, and his eyes grow narrow. He needs an edge in this fight, a tip of the scale. A survey of the smoldering boulder finds something; a small peninsula of stone near to the Abyssal. The inspecting glance finds something else, too: thrusting up from a melting stone is the Su'Katan's thrown kama. While watching the deathknight, his staff whirls once, twice, before slashing out and shattering the stone, sending his kama in the air. It lands in his fist, the blade glowing from the proximity to surging magma. The curved blade joins its' twin in his hands, and then the Dawn is upon the dark one.

A pounce is cut short, the Dawn coming into a crouch to slash wide at the knee, flowing into a diagonal rake over the Abyssal's chest with the reclaiming of the Solar's feet. The third is a vicious jab with a point, married by a savage sideways gash. Each shot made with a full body twist behind it to herd his opponent left, or face the grizzly consequences, each part of the crescendo gleaming brighter with the Solar's temper, mirrored only in the room's raging heat. Success. Chi-Yosh lurches his body downward, slamming the blade into the stone with a shriek of steel and granite, Essence alone sundering stone. Smoke, ash and spatter of liquid fire rises with the jagged edge of the kama, braced against the forearm to rise in a molten-stained uppercut as the Solar vaults to his feet.

Chi-Yosh's opponent is far more apt than expected. As the Dawn rose with blades in motion, an out-swept claw's might shattered the heat-weakened weapon in one blow, and continued to knock the second into the molten flow. On the disarming defense's heels comes a surging thrust, which Chi-Yosh ducks, stealing the might from his blows. While the stone beneath the Abyssal's feet cracks, it's far from shattered, but his uppercut, stained in soot, leaves its' mark on the bone tiger's jaw.

Chi-Yosh slips a foot underneath the staff and kicks it into his hands, before making a defensive stance. The fight is not going well for him. Taking a pure offense has gained him nothing. One more chance, before the game will become a matter of defense. The Abyssal pounces, and Solar moves to meet him. As the striking hand plummets close, Chi-Yosh's staff lassos the forearm with a tight side-snap, before the Exalt turns into the pounce, thrusting with a palm, and with all his might thrusts the Abyssal out into the sea of fire.

Skillfully the death-touched stylist angles his arm, withdrawing it from the grapple in a graceful pirouette of motion, and his body swiftly pivots to the side as Chi-Yosh's palm pushes forward. Attending to his balance for a moment costs him, but his attacks press forward, and the tiger claws gleam wickedly as they lunge in, hungry for blood.

Chi-Yosh snatches the offending fist from the air. Essence rages up the Solar's arm, aiding as a pincing hand drives into the elbow's crook, biting the punch's power, and guiding it behind the deathknight, where Chi-Yosh traps it. Free claws thrash, but the Dawn thrusts his arm into the crook of the Abyssal's, jerking it behind and pinning the arm by its' twin.

Restraining a tiger is a death wish. Thrashing, muscles bulging in contest, the gripping claws of the Mantis still hold true to the powerful prey. In the struggle, the Abyssal has been angled towards the shorter side of the rock, and the Solar's hands have drifted closer together. Suddenly, an iron tension becomes rubber. The lack of resistance is a moment of surprise exploited, the Dawn's shoulders crushing as palms go flat, waist wrenching with the brutal thrust of the Abyssal towards the bubbling lake of fire.

With a scream, the Abyssal finds himself engulfed in the burning lava. He manages to leap out, superheated magma flinging itself from his body as he flips end over end to land on a bobbing chunk of stone. Much of his skin is burned and he's panting heavily.

Chi-Yosh, knowing they will be healed after this fight, reserves no mercy for the Abyssal's wounds, moving before the man even rises from the fire. Nimble as a spider, the Dawn races across black, cooling lava, leaping off before it crumbles into the burning muck. His aim brings him to a floating stone just before the Abyssal's resting place, aiming body down to deliver a small wave of scorcing liquid lapping at the man's resting place, delivering two golden lashes on the lava's heels.

The tiger, when close to death, will lash out at anything, even rend the very dirt. Like the four-legged beast, out slashes the blood-hungry barbs, even as the haft connects to the Abyssal's jaw. It finds no purchase, the Solar rolling over the strike to slam down his own across his adversary's back. With that, the deathknight falls limp. Chi-Yosh rises, weapon raised into the air. "I choose Wood!"

The Arena of Fire has three doors leading away from it - one south to the Arena of Earth, now conquered, and more to the southwest and southeast. The southeastern door's rune flickers and fades, and the wooden barrier removes itself. The lava flows move rapidly toward it, pitching the two combatants out into a thick forest. They land on tree branches, and again their wounds are healed by the power of the Manse.

Below, the floor is a mass of tangled vines and wood spikes; the only viable place to fight is the treetops. Unlike the Arena of Fire, falling does not mean instant death, only certain discomfort. And unlike it, there is room to move up and down here.

Chi-Yosh has no time to waste. While the forest is his domain, the jungles no doubt belong to the Tiger. Once his boots met the familiar touch of the treetops, the Su-Katan is darting down one limb to leap onto the next, calling into the magic of his hearthstone. The forest comes alive, for him; the creak of limbs become a whisper, the leaves reach out to hug him. Sliding around a trunk, the Solar drops like a feather into a backdrop of leaves that curl around him like a familiar lover.

Chi-Yosh crouches from behind his hiding place, peering through the leaves. His opponent has been left looking through the shadows, prowling the branches in search of him. Claiming the branch adjacent to his perch, the Solar begins his charge. Essence bleeds through every step into the sturdy wood beneath, speeding his step and silencing the bobbing leaves. Arms pump before he pounces from the springboard, arcing high as curling knees. Kinetic power mounts as the drop begins, bringing him closer to the quarry. A branch just before the Abyssal provides an anchor; fingers dig deep enough to score the bark while his body swings, the air rent with an iridescent cascade just before the power erupts in a two-legged lance.

With a look of surprise on his face, the Abyssal swings his tiger-claws to defend the sudden attack exploding out of the woody maze. He staggers back, his feet unsteadily finding purchase on the branch.

Chi-Yosh's sent backwards by the force of his adversary's block, but the momentum is stolen, sending him swinging backwards and up onto the gripped branch. He loses no time in getting a purchase before diving elbow first into the death Exalt.

The Abyssal smiles confidently, blocking the attack. "Your surprise attacks and tricks won't serve you here," he proclaims with a sneer.

Chi-Yosh steps back with a bow. "You are right. The cat is to clever for this cage." Straightening back up, he holds the staff at arm's length. "Bring on your tricks."

Chuckling, the Tiger stylist advances, launching a series of blows with his claws out, his arms flickering rapidly as he attempts to drive the lethally-edged blades into the Solar's abdomen.

As the bone tiger's shoulder reels back, Chi-Yosh whips in the golden length and figure-eights it before him. When the first rake is unleashed, the Solar releases the radiant bolt, its' bars figure-eighting in limbo. With its' arch, the weapon proves a perfect, but brief bridge for the Exalt to rapidly scale. Up the whirling staff before he drops over the Abyssal's back into a crouch, and yanks the seven section through the Tiger's legs before it touches the limb.

Chi-Yosh vaults from his crouch into a backwards summersault. On either side of him the serpent's sting streaks slices through the air. Feet plant on the branch, but the weight and motion of his leap arcs straight down, the staff's cracking the branch's underside. Tremors ripple through the foothold as an ugly crack races across the underside. The Solar rises, hip swiveling out, up, then down in an axe-kick that hammers atop the crack, marrying the two fissures and sends the limb bowing beneath its' unfortunate weight.

With a snap the branch gives way; Solar and Orichalcum together make a mockery of mere wood. The Abyssal can already see the attack coming. He doesn't have time to interfere with it, but he at least manages to tuck and roll off the falling branch, landing squarely on his feet some eight yards below.

Angrily the Abyssal bounds upward again, propelled by his muscles and the springy response of the limb on which he landed. As he rises through the air, reaching the zenith of his journey, he comes almost face to face with Chi-Yosh, and the Solar can see the dark radiance of Essence gathering around him again. Already his anima banner is seething, but now he gathers ever more Essence to himself in preparation for.. "Four Paw Swat!" he cries, unleashing his devastating final attack.

"You even land on your-" The observation is cut short with the upward-bound Exalt. The last time such power was unleashed upon him, the Dawn was mowed down; if any slash is struck, the wounds would lead to another loss. Fury is met in kind; the first claw slash is greeted with a crack of Orchalcum across the dark steel, while he slides back. Jabbing the end of a bar into an elbow, Chi-Yosh ducks beneath the second, and attempst to out-duck the third, back crashing into the tree's back. The thought can't register, for the fourth is coming; hands snap out, catching claws between the chain and bars. Muscles stress, boots begin to grate up bark beneath the power. The two Exalts lock eyes, weapons at a tug-of-war.

Chi-Yosh's staff takes the brutal brunt, though its' golden sheen is merely marred. Where the staff had only claimed the bite, a quick jerk out of the way let the tree behind him absorb the raking gouges. The tide continues to go back and forth, until Chi-Yosh suddenly yields, ducking down, leaving the bark to disappear where the Solar's head had been.

The Abyssal balances his foot on the sheared branch, letting himself fall backward and down again - but he uses gravity to his advantage, kicking off from the branch-tip and throwing his foot violently at the Solar's face. It's paried easily, and the Tiger stylist plummets again to the branch yards below, catching it with both hands and swinging gracefully around it once before righting himself in a crouch.

Chi-Yosh spies something from the corner of his eye. A thin branch, heavy laiden with a canopy of leaves. Out snakes the serpent's sting, cracking around the little limb and sending it arcing towards the death Exalt. And arching over the green curtain is the Solar, whirling to deal a whip's crack the moment the limb's job is through.

The falling flood of leaves masks the Solar's approach; his rival is hit before he can really react, though his tiger claws dash out in a futile gesture to catch Chi-Yosh in a moment of vulnerability. He moves to attack a moment later - and is struck on the head as the branch itself falls after the leaves. Frustrated, he lets out a guttural roar.

While the Tiger is graceful, he is not nimble. Up leaps the Mantis, kicking off a branch as his shimmers, almost becoming one with the greenery as he bounds higher, scaling one trunk like a soma-drunk monkey before bounding off the trunk and lassoing one tall limb with his staff to swing up. He's found a spot where the trees are closer together, higher, brittle limbs like a patchwork. This better work.

The Abyssal watches the fast Solar rapidly ascend the tree. With a slight smirk on his face, he vanishes among the foliage of the lower branches.

Chi-Yosh watches the trees as he creeps through the brush and the vines. While he travels lower, the Abyssal crawls higher. There has to be an advantage with the low ground. Sitting under the drapery of the leaves, the Solar thinks, while he scans the room, and spies the open fire door. Intuition strikes. It's risky, but so far the forest has proved an equal footing, something must be done to tip the scale. The fire aided him before, perhaps it can again. Sliding further down the tree, Chi-Yosh slinks across the field and ducks into the fire door.He scoops up two rocks red-hot and molten, holding them only long enough to hurl them as far as he can into the trees. There they begin to smolter, before wood and leaf burst into flames. This is continued four more times, arcing the smoking rubble as far as he can in either direction, as far up the trees as his aim can go.

Chi-Yosh watches the tongues of flame begin to climb up the trees, smoke hissing into an artifical sky. It's not enough to create an inferno, but judging by what he spots, the Abyssal's moving downward. Or that could be an illusion of the leaves. Whatever the case, the stand must be made, and now. Slithering up the trunk of a tree yet claimed by the dawning flames, Chi-Yosh finds the perfect spot for the ambush, and waits, watching the skies. It's completely possible the Abyssal will have the jump on him.

The Solar and Abyssal leap out at each other at almost the same time, each stunned by the appearance of the other. Their defenses are ready, and both men are wary, but the mutual surprise of the ambush distracts them for scant seconds.

Chi-Yosh's surprise is cast aside like a cloak. Essence like a tide roars to live, twisting his Anima into a roaring wave, crashing into a downward's slam of adjacent bars twisted into a V. The momentum stolen, the Solar flips and runs across the top of the Abyssal, kicking off a tree and flipping back, Essence a crescent before slashing down upon the death Exalt. Feet find a limb, and slip, but the lasso of the staff swings him in for another, brutal jab at the face. Still air-borne, it's a scramble. Let the Abyssal fall before they hit the ground. The wheeling figure eight comes, each crash hidden behind the wheeling pinwheel of Essence-drenched Orichalcum.

The furious eruption of blows that results - attack, counter-attack, and counter-counter-attack - shake the tree, dislodging leaves hither and yon. The Abyssal comes out of the exchange much worse for wear, panting heavily and nearly losing his balance on the branch. He looks to be very near the end of his power, though he defiantly resumes his combat stance.

Chi-Yosh catches eyes with the Abyssal, before peering over his shoulder at the fire raging up some branches. The faintest of smiles perks the warrior's lips, before he's charging down the limb, and leaps in a summersault towards, and over the deathknight. The serpent-staff does not follow, its' center caught beneath the Tiger's chin. Feet plant behind his opponent, shoulders slam into middle, as arns wrench in a quick back, up and forward hurl.

The Abyssal takes flight with a choking howl, protesting the abuse with a downward snapping boot that scrapes the Mantis's forehead. He arcs messily, limbs flailing out, claws scoring across the bark to slow his momentum. Landing feet first upon the branch is only bitter sweet, for his fall is broken against the cracked stump of a branch. The impact earns the tree to sway, then slowly begin its' fall.

**You have conquered,** proclaims the Manse. But weakly the Abyssal calls out. "I concede!" he yells from the depths of the wood, as both men's wounds are healed.

Chi-Yosh has not celebrated either victory, sans a grim smile. Because he knew each one came with more ahead. This was to be a long, grueling battle, and chest-thumping early can prove a shallow gloat. But the Abyssal's decloration releases a tense knot in the Solar's gut, and his Anima flares out like a bonfire among the slowly climbing inferno. Finally, a triumphant smile breaks his face, as he makes his way to the forest floor. The Bronze Tiger has struck down the Bone Tiger, but there is no prideful strut in his walk towards his adversary.

The Abyssal has regained a position on the branch. "The Green Lady did indeed foretell the outcome," he says. "Because I doubted her, I came anyway. Your name?"

Chi-Yosh bows. "I am Chi-Yosh." There is an internal conflict. Give the Abyssal the name of his birthplace, a sign of respect? Or offer a weakness for the deathknight to exploit? Is he trustworthy, or knows no place in honor? The Solar remains silent, caution of worth winning over respect of an opponent.

"I'll remember it." And with that, the black-souled martial artist leaps from branch to branch, moving toward the door to the Arena of Earth, and toward the exit of the Manse.

Chi-Yosh is closer to the Earth door, and with a leap puts him before it. The mask he wears is neutral, but there is nothing but respect in the out-thrust of a hand towards the Abyssal. "You are a worthy opponent, the most challenging I have met. I would be honored with your name."

The man disregards the hand, but not out of unfriendliness. He is deferring to the victor and internalizing his own defeat. "I am One Breath Left," he says, in a flat tone of voice. "The Tiger's Shade of Mourning Fields, in the service of Walker in Darkness."

Chi-Yosh digests this. "I will remember that." The next few moments are hesitant, before the Dawn steps aside, offering the door to One Breath Left. In the same moment, he offers, "I am only familiar with the art of the Tiger in passing, and I have never seen the ... other powers with which you display. They meld into your style well. I would like to learn of it, sometime, in a less dangerous way." There's no mocking in his eyes, but curiousity. Perhaps too much, for the Abyssal seems a humble one when accepting defeat. He intends not to rub this in.

One Breath Left is silent, considering this. "Present yourself at the fortress of Walker in Darkness, if you wish," he says at last. "If my master approves, I will teach what I can."

Chi-Yosh bows once more to the Abyssal. The prospect of visiting Walker's realm does not sit well with him. But the potential to learn the principles of this dark style to find its' strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunity to see into a Deathlord's realm, and likewise size up its' powers, is a great one. Unless Stormclouds at Dusk and his sorceres companion call Walker in Darkness master. In which case, the viper's nest is deep.
