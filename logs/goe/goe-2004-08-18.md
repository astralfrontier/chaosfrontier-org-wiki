Gallius' schedule is as hectic as ever. She travels swiftly to Mount Metagalapa, aiding Marina in hammering out the last details of a treaty that binds the Hawkriders to the Nation. Not long after the ink dries Gallius is once again travelling, this time to Nane.

In this former home away from home, Gallius arranges for yet another deal. The King's role in his land is assured, with certain laws and limitations added to prevent tyranny. Guarantees of protection and prosperity are made that will profit the entire region. Within a few days of intense negotiation and supernatural charisma, Nane, too, enters the Nation of the Sun, creating a powerful presence on the easter side of the Rock River.

Before the Queen leaves this new land, she offers a prayer for the health of Nane's people. The Lady also speaks to the Master, asking his aid in finding a skilled Solar Sage and a Solar Architect, two critical people in her hope of a real capital.

Only after the feast is ended does Gallius at last return to her temporary seat of power in Bridal Veil, where Dace awaits the last stages of his most critical training.

The morning is quite beautiful. The trees are still green, though their leaves are showing the first hints of changing their color. The airship is primed and ready, and when at last the Circle of Solars is gathered up, Ramar provides a brief description of where they're travelling. "It's like the desert, but much much colder. There are legends of two settlers out that far who once had an argument... their words froze in the air, so they each collected the others words, took them home, and thawed them out by the hearthfire to continue the argument. Although this is probably exaggerated... you will want your warmest of clothes, just be thankful we're not going there during the winter seasons."

And so the airship, laden down with supplies and warm clothing leaves the Scavenger Lands. The ship glides as smoothly as ever, little evidence as to their motion, save for the rushing of wind, and the way the ground passes by far beneath the skyship. Slowly, green fades to white... and the ice begins to hang off of the sides of the ship. It is cold. Very cold. All those who must not be atop the decks remain below, where there is warmth. Ramar though, has an odd, faraway look in his eyes, as though searching for something, something none but he can see. He's yet to don any of the warmer clothes he's brought with him... curiously enough. On the third day of travel: "Brace yourselves. There's a snowstorm up ahead. Looks to be large, hard to get around. We're almost there. We'll be pushing through it. We'll be testing the storm." His voice is rather determined.

Chi-Yosh, mentally preparing for the task ahead, stares up into the sky to guage the sun's progression, "We will have to wait until nightfall. The Underworld is not welcome beneath Helios's gaze, its' strength resolved when he has passed."

The storm passes. Ice, snow, and turbulent winds give way to vast fields of grey clouds that stretch as far as the eye can see. Here and there, patches of light breaking through the cloud cover can be found. Beneath the Solars, is little more than a sea of glimmering white. There is no questioning it... they have reached the North.

The city called Crystal is buried under glaciers and great sheets of packed snow and ice. Even if the little of it that's visible lies in ruins for the most part, the sight is still magnificent. It's this sight that has brought hundreds of miners, excavators, sorcerers, sages and treasure-hunters to the area. The dig, for the most part, is a well-organized affair. The Realm itself has even sent a few loremasters, though the Terrestrial Exalted represented are principally outcastes.

This organization, and the awareness of history and the camaraderie of the workers who seek to uncover the secrets locked in ice, allow the Circle to quickly and readily learn more about Korash, the White Wizard. By his own request he was buried in the "null zone", one of Crystal's many anomalies, and a magical area he was studying and reputedly had halfway mastered. At first, there is suspicion of the strangers asking questions about this knowledgeable sorcerer, but after learning a little more, the Circle takes a new approach. They describe in detail a Terrestrial outcaste sorcerer named Ice, who shares many of the same physical traits as his father. Korash and his son had a falling out, and Ice went his own way; nevertheless, even a mention of the young man among those who knew Korash is enough to secure help. The Circle is led into the null zone on the third day, and there they are left alone before the grave of Korash.

Summoning the dead can be dangerous, be it the spirit of a loved one or an exorcism. Mortal sorcerers for centuries have drawn up the departed at their own risks. For the Chosen of Helios, it is merely swimming upstream. Inside a circle of powdered tombstone simmers a small fire, heat nearly visible as it claws into the chill air. Within the orange tongue cracks the consecrated bones of crows, messengers into the dark realm. Ringing the fire are the four Solars, hands held, chanting in a haunting dirge.

As the calling intensifies, the fold between Creation and the Underworld ripples like sun on an oil-spill. Winds howl, fueled not by the North's presence, but the tomb's icy grip. Their summons is mirrored by the otherworldly moans, lost souls in the frozen north nearby beating at the diluted fringe. "From last gasp to grave," speaks the Circle at the height of their beckons, "Speak to us beyond breath. We seek you, Korash, heed our call!"

The summons goes unheeded for many minutes. Nevertheless, this isn't unusual. At length, the Solars can see, hovering beyond the faint fire, a black shade that seems to evaporate into nothingness when one stares directly at it. And so, glancing from the corners of their eyes, they watch as it draws nearer. _He whom you seek cannot be found in this fashion. But if you wish to learn more, you will come with me to my master,_ its dead voice intones.

Davron sighs softly - it is as he had feared. The death of Korash did not escape the lords of the Underworld, of course, as no death does; but worse, it seems that his significance did not entirely escape their attention either. He nods in the shade's direction. "I see," he says softly. "May we know by what name we might know your master?"

_She is the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears,_ the shade announces. _I will escort you._

Gallius nods to the shade, then looks to her circle with a grim expression. "We can only move forward," she says flatly. She does not appear precisely eager, but she is not going to suggest they back down, either. There's too much to gain.

Bowing, the shade approaches the grave. It presses its oily, half-seen fingers down into the frozen soil. The ground collapses under its touch as though nothing existed under the gravesite than a yawning black void. It slinks down into the deep pit thus exposed, passing through the ground where Korash's grave ought to be, and in the failing light the Circle can see a crude set of stone stairs carved into the depths of the Earth. They seem to descend forever, and yet the Solars set foot on them. They follow the shade downward, and at last the faint light above them vanishes.

Through the cold and horrid earth the Circle moves, seemingly descending forever into darkness. Hope is leeched from their hearts just as surely as warmth is sucked from their bones. The stone stairs have no end, and the shade is invisible before them as it descends. How long can this go on?

_We walk the Labyrinth,_ explains the shade, before them. _The Lover awaits._ And as though its words were a magic talisman of arrival, the Circle can hear the creaking of a stone door on ancient hinges, and each brings a hand to cover their face as alien light streams through the opening. They have entered another chamber, carved from stone, and the air is thickly aromatic with perfumes and herbs of all descriptions. Beneath these familiar hints is another odor, a malign scent whose redolent and disgusting nature bides its time beneath the pleasantry of mortal scents.

Davron's nose wrinkles as the air's scent washes over him, but he takes great pains to show no other reaction. He is in the realm of the Deathlords, and he has no surety that he or his Circle will be able to find their way out again, except at their sufferance. However he may feel about the Underworld or its denizens, discourtesy is almost surely death.

Chi-Yosh regards the world around them, darkness and death like an all consuming blanket smothering the glow of the Sun even inside of him. A weak candle in the wind. Hugging himself briefly, a gesture not for the cold. The scents of decadence is an anchor, drawing him back to a world more recognizable. An illusion, yes, but one that he can cling to.

For the Zenith, this trip is perhaps most interesting. If interesting is the right word. Gallius is a priestess queen, and here she is, descending into the depths of gloom that awaits all those sad souls that turn away from the greatness of Helios and fall into shadow. Here even hopes are muted and dreams lost in a growing numbness that only her faith can hold at bay. She offers her hands to her Circle, hoping to share the strength of her convictions with a simple gesture.

_And into the Lover's den we go._ Ramar is careful here. Most of what he displays is nervousness. Or a morbid sort of curiosity. "Here we are then..." He nods to his Circlemates, sticking close to them. _May we see the light of day again._ Although, as Gallius offers her hands, he takes hold of one for a moment, and his resolve strengthens. _With my friends at my side, we will see the light once more._

The shade passes through another door leading out of this chamber, and guides the group through torchlit corridors. The floor here and there is slick with blood, sometimes still steaming in the cool air, and there is no other sign of its source. _The Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears,_ the shade announces at last, stopping by great double doors that swing open of their own accord. It vanishes with a soft exhalation, and the Circle continues inside.

The Lover's throne room is more of a debauch frozen in time. Bodies, both warm and cold, intermingle under the gauziest of coverings, their motions growing more suggestive because of the concealment. Watching all this, from an ornate throne that sparkles with diamonds and other precious gems, is the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears. Her body is completely veiled with silks and garments woven of gold or other beautiful things. And as she rises from her throne to step forward, the Solars watch as her movements reveal parts of her body and face. The merest hints flash by, suggesting the carnality of a temptress, the frail beauty of a highborn princess, or the warm and womanly flesh of a loving wife. These and other aspects of female existence burrow like worms into the awareness of the Solars, and in some of them, a hunger begins to grow to cast off the veils and revel in the fullness of her.

_A mockery of beauty and love and life... of course._ Ramar looks around, then turns towards the Lover as she strides towards the Circle. "Good evening," he says, while bowing politely. "We are told we can learn more of a shade we seek, and that to learn more we would need to come here..."

Davron grits his teeth as the vision of the Lover tears at his psyche, knowing that it would be wildly unwise to succumb. His mind casts about for a focus, something to remind himself of the world of the living, and it settles upon Rumika. Rumika, who turned her back on the realm of Death to embrace Life. He begins to understand how hard a choice this was for her; and now he must do the same.

Gallius watches the Lover move from her throne, an eyebrow arching as her motions bring her closer. The priestess cannot help but reflect how nice it would be to learn how to move in that way, to be so many things to the eye in the space of heartbeats. Gallius idly notes that there's something exciting to it, even for her. She is thankful not for the first time that Helios granted great strength of virtue, as well, to those he has Chosen. Still, some decorum is to be shone a queen in her throne room. Gallius offers a polite bow, though for the moment she says nothing further.

"'From what little we know of the Deathlords, it would seem they wish for the death of all creation. Due to our current status, any actions which would draw their attention should be avoided whenever possible.'" The Lover's voice is sweet, warm as a spring day, wise as the owls and the stars in the sky. "Is that not what you said, my dear?" she asks in a silky tone, smiling at Gallius. "And yet you come to me now.. There must be something of great importance astir." She addresses herself to Ramar, smiling behind her maddeningly-concealing veils.

"It would seem a little late to avoid your notice," replies Gallius, smiling back at the Lover. Oddly enough, it's a friendly smile, and amused, as well. "We come, and you surely know what has brought us here." For a moment Gallius wonders at herself, for there is something in this that seems right, somehow. In another setting, this would seem completely right. She cannot say why or how that could be. "The real question then is why you have allowed us to speak to you, and that I cannot answer. I do not believe it was just to reward us with the beauty of your presence."

"Flattery, child, is like honey," murmurs the Lover, smiling. "It is sweet and desirable to the taste, but do not expect to live on it alone."

"Of course," replies Ramar. "Yet she makes a good point. I would be surprised to find that you do not know precisely why we are here... but, in case you don't, we are looking for the White Wizard... Korash. We have reason to believe he has er... taken residence here? I think..." Ramar smiles. "And thank you for receiving us."

"He did not become a ghost," the Lover smiles. "I will tell you of his fate, if you wish," she says, and gestures to the covered bodies that lay about in the throne room. "But perhaps you wish to indulge in more pleasant matters first?"

"I fear that for the living time is always such a pressing matter," says Gallius, sounding apologetic. "I fear it will be business for us. As you no doubt know, we are always rushing about."

"I can think of nothing more pleasant than to learn more at this point. Though the courtesy is appreciated. Please, tell us of the fate of this wizard." Ramar smiles politely, and not once does he turn towards the covered bodies. He awaits the information with a somewhat curious expression on his face.

"I know, my dear. The secrets of Bagrash Kol have kept for long enough," the Lover says, showing hints of a dazzling smile behind the veil that conceals her face. "And other secrets, I think. But, very well." She turns, walking to her throne with a feminine swing to her hips. She settles in, crossing one leg over the other, exposing a glistening, flawlessly formed patch of her thigh in the process. "Korash accepted Gaia's offer. He was reborn in her realm, and there he lives even now. But Gaia will not help you."

"It is not her place to do so." Ramar comments. "Then, if the secrets have kept for long enough, I would wish to apologize for taking more time of yours than is necessary." He considers, "Although, if Korash has been reborn within her realm, there is little anyone can do now. Thank you for the information. I suppose we shall be on our way then."

"We cannot leave just yet," says Gallius. "I suspect there is more to say, isn't there? And besides, where I come from it is the gravest insult to come to the hearth of another and offer no gift to match the hospitality offered."

"Then let me offer you true hospitality," says the Lover huskily, with a carnal smile behind her veil. "Or, I can teach you one more secret before you leave."

Davron cannot hide the coloring of his cheeks, for that is a reaction of his body rather than his mind, a reaction he knows no way to master. But Gallius' words are just, and he cannot hide a faint sheepish smile in return as he bows to acknowledge the Lover's. "And what secret would you share with us, milady?"

"Why," says she, feigning surprise. "The secret to following Korash. The secret way into Gaia. You need not die, after all."

"Some things are not meant to be known. I believe that perhaps this knowledge is too great a secret to be passed on." Ramar bows his head respectfully, "It is too great a gift to be presented with. I cannot accept it."

"For some knowledge, much must be risked," says Gallius. She clears her throat and presses a finger to the middle of her forehead, thinking for a time. "Very well. What must be, must be. If you will show us a way into Gaia that does not require death, it would seem we must take it. After all, we have come this far to find Korash, haven't we?"

"And the great artifact whose location he alone commands," agrees Lover, amicably, smiling behind her all-concealing veil.

"We have come this far, yet there are other paths to find." Replies Ramar towards Gallius. "There are other ways, and I will not go down this one. It is not something that must be." To the Lover, he replies, "I am sorry, your offer is most generous, and very tempting, but I cannot accept it. I do not presume to speak for my Circle, but I do not wish to know it, and would advise seeking another path."

Gallius considers everything she's seen and heard thus far with care. "We should at least hear something more about this secret way." Another apologetic smile is offered to the Lover, "As you know doubt could imagine, trust between us will be difficult."

The Lover smiles, and the slightest hint of her finger emerges from a swishing swatch of silk. The throne room is gone. The Lover, and her guests, lounge on comfortable divans in a smokey, incense-filled room. "Here we may have more privacy," she explains softly. "The secret way is in the care of one of my peers. It suits me to discomfit my esteemed peer with your presence. You will need to battle your way through her lands, but she will welcome you hospitably once you arrive."

"Well, I for one find this proposal reasonable enough," decides Gallius. For some reason, part of her wants to trust the Lover. She cannot understand why. Mercy. She remembers what happened there all too well. It is not as simple a thing anymore. "I once hated you with all my heart. You know that well. Mercy rules my mind, now. I will accept your offer, if you will accept a small gift in return? It is perhaps just a trifle, but I give the work of my own hands and voice."

The Lover inclines her head, smiling softly behind her concealment.

"Very well..." replies Ramar. _This is such a gift though... are such journeys even allowed? It would certainly explain why the Sidereals have not found such knowledge..._ He smiles, and it is a weary smile. "Thank you for your gift," and the Solar bows, then turns to wait for Gally to present her gift.

Gallius draws from a small bag what seems to be nothing but a handful of soil. "White seems a fitting color for you," Gallius whispers. And then her voice lifts into a song of simple things. Clouds and wind, rain and sunlight, the sensation of mud pressing between toes on some hot summer's day. Her words bring out the joy of each feeling, trying to bring the memory of all that is good in life to this dark realm.

As Gallius sings, the soil in her hand slowly is parted, and slender shoots of green grow with a will. Their stems bear sharp thorns, but each is crowned with a flawless, white rose, each almost glowing with life.

The Lover accepts the gift, smiling warmly. And then she reaches forth, squeezing her hand tightly around the stem, allowing the thorns to impale her flawless flesh. Amber drops of blood flow in a steady rivulet down the stem of the rose and into the soil. As she bleeds herself out, the flower begins to wilt, dying before the Circle's very eyes. She draws away, concealing her bloodied hand in her veils again, and smiles. This time, the flashed hint is that of a wild rose, beautiful and natural, artfully sequestered in long and flowing locks of hair. "I wish to be a reflection of all beauty," the Lover murmurs. "Many come to admire my beauty. Few indeed come to increase it. I thank you."

The Lover rises from her divan and gestures. "The Well of Udr is what you seek," she says. "Seek the Dowager of the Irreverent Vulgate in Unrent Veils. Her domain is near your home, I believe," she adds, nodding to Chi-Yosh.

Chi-Yosh has remained silent for the meeting. To keep himself in check, aware of the proceedings but to be in control of the self. The internal monologue reverberates his Circle, a silent buttress for their decision. Yet, at the Lover's final words, the stillness is shattered. While the place is known to him, a place of fearful legend, the knowledge now of _what_ it is, and _who_ controls it strums a cord of terror in his heart. A Deathlord lives within the backyard of his village. To travel there and fight the Dowager's minions may set the Deathlord upon the Solar's people, and that he cannot have. It is the best of his ability to bow for the Lover. "We thank you for your audience and courtesy." His words are short, moreso than normal: he desires to be free of this place, and nothing more.

---

A shade is summoned by the Lover's command, and again, the oily black creature, half-visible in the gloom, leads the Circle to the door through which it entered the domain of the Lover. The stairs, curiously, go down rather than up, and again the fearful, claustrophobic descent engulfs them. Down, and down, and down forever they move, finally stopping at a wall of dirt. Pushing through this, they find themselves emerging from a cliff face very near the grave of Korash. The shade evaporates slowly into nothingness, and the Circle wastes no time at all in establishing distance from the noxious hole that leads only to blackness.

Even with the sky Helios blesses half a day above them, the Dawn is still shaken. When the Circle turns to him, feeling the palpable tension, Chi-Yosh merely gestures for them to follow. Inside the ship, the Dawn leads down into the ship's meeting room. Upon the wall are various maps, and for a long time, the Su'Katan stares at a particular portion, fingers brushing over his village, then southward. He begins to speak.

"There is a story of a great place that once stood. A place of purity, where planted seeds would bear the best plants, tall and huge. There, wholesome people harvested and sheperded. Here, the wealth of the East blossomed and spread, like a beautiful flower's petals blooming wide. But deep in the roots of this blessed place, something grew sour, rotted the ground and grew like a cancer. There, the world began to decay and die, the curse spawned from the blessing. Now, birds and animals fly there to die, and simply approaching the cursed lands will bring omens and spirits of plague to reckon the defiler." He taps it again. "This is a stone's throw from my homeland." Turning to the Circle, "This is where we must go."

Chi-Yosh says, finally, "We will go there, and no doubt slight the Deathlord. The Dowager may spread those lands wider, as vengance. I cannot allow that."

"She will try," says Gallius. "But this time, when she sends her legions forth, they will not find mortals, cowering and weak. The Nation of the Sun shall ride against her. We will wrest what she holds away, inch by inch, forcing life into the very jaws of death." The Zenith's words drip with the passion of her convictions, and she smiles, "The Unconquered Sun has sent his light into the world, and that light will destroy the shadows. Your people will not fall."

---

The elders of Chi-Yosh's village, and Weeping Prowler, are both informed of the Circle's intentions. Prowler in particular sends word to his Jaguar-men to be wary of incursions from the terrifying hybrid zombies the Dowager is fond of employing. He also permits the Circle a few minutes with Sun-and-Moon, who is recovering from another in a long series of experiments in sorcery. The Lunar sorcerer seems intent on curing the Wyld-rooted damage he himself inflicted on her Exalted spark. Nevertheless he assures the Circle that the Dowager will not find matters easy should she decide to extend her hand.

And finally, the airship is forced to set down - Ramar noted a fluctuation in engine power the further it penetrated into the shadowland, and the craft must land at the outskirts lest the Circle crash unexpectedly. And so on foot they begin marching into the dead lands and haunted forests of the Dowager of the Irreverent Vulgate in Unrent Veils.

Chi-Yosh had expected death's henchmen, but not patchwork horrors from a leather worker's nightmares. It is all the Dawn can do to evade an ambush of the mockery of a spider - human arms stitched to a torso sporting the heads of wolves - grappling as best he can before Gallius' spear can save him. Then the Bronze tiger takes to the trees, hunting down the skulking beasts, trees falling and the howls haunting the day.

Frog-crotch arrows. An innovation in the art of war that has long made Davron uncomfortable - the wounds produced by the forked arrowhead are gruesome and painful, and against living targets he has been reluctant to use them. But here the Circle faces foes that feel no pain, and that must be torn to shreds before they can be persuaded to stop moving. The grotesque shapes, too, fill Davron with loathing, and for once he feels no regret as the hitherto unused arrows fly through the air, ripping gobbets of rotting flesh from the Circle's assailants.

And even against fleshless horrors they are of use. When Chi-Yosh and Ramar are beset by five skeletal monstrosities at once, each with four bony arms and a longer ribcage than any natural creature should have, the wide arrowheads are more effective in catching on the slender ribs, chipping and shattering them, giving his companions the distraction they need to scatter the unliving bones to the five winds.

In the depths of a land of decay, death wears many faces. As the circle presses onward, they come to an expanse of fouled plain, where the ground is something like mud. Like it, but not exactly mud. As the steps continue, the Solars find themselves striding through what looks like a very slick puddle of some black fluid.

Gallius hastens her steps, wanting to get away from this dark lake, but her eagerness gains the attention of some strange forms of unlife, and soon the black reflections of the Solars rise from the water, and each finds themselves locked in combat. The Solars tighten into a circle, setting their weapons against the dark reflections that rose from the shadows. Gallius loses count of how many blows are just barely turned from her by her friends, nor does she rightly know how much damage is dealt to the reflective foes before they finally relinquish their forms and fade into steam, taking the black pool with them and leaving rotted turf behind.

At last, in the deadened and hushed forest, under a grey-cloaked sky with its ominous clouds, the Circle approaches the cyclopean stone fortress the Dowager calls home. Those trees around her citadel that still live show an unhealthy degree of development, taking some unmentionable nourishment from the soil beneath their roots, and more than once the Circle remarks upon graves or other headstones that litter the forest. The air has a curious muffled quality to it. Sound does not travel far, and when it does it echoes in unexpected and disturbing ways. Rustling sounds, as of things moving, often can be heard where no sign of movement is otherwise given; and more than once, one of the Solars sees movement shadowed by the trees where there is no sound. Twice, Davron could swear that he felt the hot and fetid breath of some creature warming the back of his neck, and yet there was nothing there when he whirled to confront it.

The monumental stone citadel, attained at last, is a blasphemy against all reason. It towers over the trees, its bulk settled with incalculable age. There is something deeply troublesome about the way it's put together, and none of those witnessing it could imagine human hands sliding brick over oddly-shaped brick. Nevertheless there is a great double-door of black steel, and steps leading to it. They are indeed large, and must almost be jumped rather than ascended in the usual fashion. The doors themselves open without a single sound, silently responding to the presence of the Solars as they attain the top of the steps. Looking at each other for a moment, all enter, and just as silently, the doors close behind them again. The corridor they follow is forbiddingly dark. Walking, they strain to hear even their own footfalls or the sound of their breathing; neither can be detected. The dark passage ends only at a second set of doors, and these too open.

The Dowager's throne room is the very essence of Spartan horror. Great black slabs of stone are the only building material; spider-webs the only decoration. The architecture is prehuman, wrong in some indescribable fashion. The stone fits together to appease some long-dead alien aesthetic, and to the eyes of mortal man, it shrieks madness. The throne of the Deathlord is too large by half for a human being, and yet she occupies it comfortably. Her eyes are yellow and slitted, like a cat's, shimmering in the dim light from the passage. What the Solars take to be long-fingered gloves adorn her hands; it takes a hissing sound and the sight of wriggling to reveal that her fingers themselves are snakes. Her head is surmounted by ram's horns and an elegant soulsteel tiara. Politely, as the most regal of queens might, she inclines her head, waiting for her visitors to do respect to her.

Try as he might to avoid using his magic, the long and violent journey has set the golden half-circle of Twilight aglow on Davron's brow. In his view, this is identification enough of his identity for now. But courtesy demands an explanation of his purpose as well. He offers a bow. "Greetings, Dowager of the Irreverent Vulgate in Unrent Veils. We seek the Well of Udr."

The walls are lined with shadows, cast by some obscure action of the poor light that suffuses the chamber. And after a moment, these begin to move, and slowly shapes emerge; two-dimensional shadows become three-dimensional bodies, populating the once-empty throne room. Their natures are soon revealed - Nemessaries wearing their long robes and expressionless silver masks, haughty Abyssal Exalted, draped in their rotting finery and softly-moaning soulsteel armor, half-mortal attendants who serve their betters. "Then we welcome you, one and all," the Dowager intones. "You have slain many of my hunting parties. Bold indeed are you." Her lips curl into a cruel smile, exposing rotting and discolored fangs. "Boldness is something I respect, to a point." This earns sniggers from a pair of Abyssals, who are instantly silenced by a single gesture from one of her serpentine hands.

Gallius considers the Abyssals with more than her usual interest and she offers a polite bow. She feels sadness for them, but rather doubts she can save them now. Not here in the very hands of a Deathlord. "We were told to come to you by one of your peers, who seemed confident that the Well of Udr was in your keeping, and that we might make use of it should we come this far."

"If it is the Well you wish, then I will tell you the tale of this place," the Dowager intones. "Long ago, the race of Dragon Kings committed their mass suicide here. This was an ancient temple, where they poured out their souls in pleas for understanding to the heartless god you worship. Their deaths spawned this shadowland, around the treasure they most feared and had sworn to guard. The Well of Udr." The Deathlord stirs on her throne, then gestures at the stone floor. "The Well is just below this chamber."

Davron lets the slander of Helios pass for now, if indeed slander it be - the tragedy of the Dragon Kings is something he would learn more about before he dares to comment on it. For now, he focuses upon the pursuit of the present quest. "And by their deaths you inherited it," he says without heat. "Will you show us the way, then?"

---

The Well of Udr is a great black void, a hole in existence seemingly cut into the stone floor, and surrounded by rings of ancient stones arranged in patterns of fiendishly cunning occult geometry. The Dowager, showing her four-yard height, stands beside the gaping maw of seeming oblivion. "The Well," she intones solemnly. "You wish to use it. You are welcome to do so. Simply step in and focus on your destination."

Gallius looks to her circle, than to the Dowager. "One must pass through great darkness to breathe in the light of day," she says gently. She steps first out onto the void, flanked by Jin-nu, both minds focusing on the world of Gaia.

Davron glances at the remainder of his circle, and then at the Dowager. "We thank you for your courtesy," he says calmly, bowing, and, turning his mind toward Gaia and Gallius, he turns away and jumps lightly into the nothingness.

Chi-Yosh watches the Queen disappear, and steels himself. This pit will lead to Gaia, one way or the other. Simply giving a nod to the Dowager, he takes a leap a leap into the void, mind honed on the path ahead.

Ramar watches them go, and with a moment of wariness turns and asks one question: "How do we return?" The Dowager only smiles, and recites a verse:

'Once, there was a maiden, who learned that the faster she ran, the faster she could run. Thus, running consumed her; until, one day, she flew beyond the ending of her life. "And here I thought it'd last forever," she said. "But-" "There's always an ending," said the run.'

And so saying, she smiles and pushes him forward into the Well.
