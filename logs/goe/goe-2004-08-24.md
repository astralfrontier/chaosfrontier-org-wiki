# Gods of Eden 2004-08-24

There is nothing but darkness here, and dead, fouled air. The stench of the grave, of something best left buried and unnamed, clouds the air. But the atmosphere is dead in another way. As the Solars take wary breaths, they feel an absence of something they have been accustomed to since their Exaltation, and each is still mortal enough to remember the sensations of that prior time: there is no feeling of Essence here. No power flows into their anima banners upon every breath; the tidal waves of Essence that once restored their spent strength are not here. Whatever magical power they have brought with them is all that they can rely on.

Gallius lets out a sigh, and then says, "Well, I think we're there. Though.." And this is when she notices she has no spear, no stone, and no armor. And nothing else but her hair, either. "I think the first order of business is finding out where we are. Or rather get clothes. This place feels.. hollow."

"I do not believe it feels hollow... so much as it feels... empty. Bereft of Essence," replies Ramar. He is rather thankful for the darkness. "Is everyone... okay? Is there a door or something around here?"

Davron stretches out his hands until he feels a wall, then edges along it with a slow shuffling noise, searching for anything resembling a door. "I think we find out where we are first. We're not gonna find any clothes until we can figure out where to start looking for them." He taps a wall lightly. "And we aren't going to find where we are until we find a way _out_ of... wherever this is."

Two minutes pass, and Davron's probing fingers detect no door. He can feel raised and depressed areas of the wall, suggesting an engraving of art or some system of writing. The stone is thick; nary a tremor runs through it. There's no indication of light, and no breeze. Whatever this room is, it can very quickly become a tomb.

"Perhaps a little illumination then..." suggests Ramar, "Although, I believe here we should be careful. Conserve our energies. But for now, I shall provide our light." The Solar touches the tip of his brow, and there is a brief flicker of light that slowly forms the golden white circle of his Caste. The filmy, fluctuating glow of the Eclipse's light grows.

The room they stand in is a vaulted room, claustrophobically small on four sides, outlandishly high above. Almost everything is made of Southern stone: the walls, the high peaking roof overhead, the floor below. The walls are lined with cartouches: engraved stone tablets containing alien characters of writing, and pigmented images. The art is almost decadent in its details.

Chi-Yosh blinks as the void is pierced by Helios' blessing. It sparks in the air, drawing the warm glow across skin bronzed under a lifetime of filtered sunlight, yet leaving shadows to well at perhaps the most appropriate of places. With his topknot peaking over six feet, Chi-Yosh is like some tall willow, stripped to remain only in the bark. Lips purse, deep brown pools look about to his Circle - to faces - with a frown. Feeling awkward, having no where to put his hands, powerful arms cross over the toned pectorals. "Davron. Does the lettering look like anything you've seen in your studies?"

Davron is a man of medium height, with lanky but wiry build, long limbs wrapped with well-defined muscles built by a childhood and early adulthood before the forge. His hair is a sandy blonde, largely unkempt and untamed, the color contrasting somewhat with the light brownish color of his skin. His facial features are well-formed but largely not distinctive, with the exception of his long narrow chin, dusted with a short but well-kept beard along the jawline right up to his sideburns. His hands are work-roughened but not callused, with the exception of the index and middle fingers of his right hand. He shakes his head, though to cover his embarrassment he turns toward the walls as if studying. "Nothing I've ever seen."

Bereft of clothing, Queen Gallius Leom still stands with confidence and strength. Her posture is as steady as ever, and her sea grey eyes calm. Where once she wore a helm of steel the gold of her hair drifts freely, the locks nearly glowing with health.

The Queen is a tall woman, reaching a height of just over six feet. Her body, thus revealed, proves to be lithe and well-muscled. Here and there some old scar can be seen, and yet the marks do not seem to mar the beauty of her, but rather accentuate it.

In the fitful light of this place, Gallius looks around, not bothering to cover herself. She is beyond that concern, at least. She is only concerned about getting out.

Average. That is a good way to describe Ramar's physical qualities. He's neither overly muscular nor terribly striking in a physical sense, but he's not unttractive or a weakling... just another face in the crowds, as it were. A life of Wandering has left him with the tanned skin of the Southern deserts, and a well-used body that hangs on a somewhat lithe and graceful frame. Hair as deep blue as the Western sea speaks of his origins. He's got grey eyes. The lack of clothing doesn't seem to affect him much.

The Solars look at each other in surprise. And they look at the other occupant of the chamber. Jin-nu, or some being once answering that description, is now a well-proportioned human girl. Her hair is a long luxuriant blonde. Her fingernails and toenails are distinctive, colored a deep pink hue, and even her skin shimmers with radiant health. Her eyes remain the violet shade they bore, but in every other respect, she is an unclad mortal girl.

Here and there, inscriptions are visible in the golden light. Davron inspects the faded lettering and imagery. Though he does not know the words these strange symbols denote, he recognizes a few things. The phoenix, the rays of the sun, the blurred darkness of the Underworld. Whoever left these cartouches seemed to have some basic knowledge of the truths of life and death in Creation, though much of the imagery carries a distinctly death-haunted air. Perhaps this is unsurprising, if the Deathlord-controlled Well of Udr leads to this place. Yet even so, the Solars receive the impression that the users of this place sought the Sun as protector and savior.

Barely visible in the high roof overhead is a niche. It could lead up to a passageway, if the Circle is lucky; whatever is there is cloaked in shadows that have lain undisturbed for uncounted years in this dreary, sepulchral place. It would require the cooperation of two people to reach, and jagged, dust-coated edges promise to draw blood from the unwary climber.

"Alright then. Anyone care to clamber up on me, or shall I do the climbing," asks Ramar when he notices the niche in the roof. "It seems that it will take two of us..."

Chi-Yosh surveys the climb. While feeling more naked without the warm reassurance of Essence, the Exalt is still confident in his abilities. "I will make the climb." His words are as much an affirmation as information, reassuring in one's abilities now that the supernatural has been disrobed.

The niche leads into a narrow passageway running at almost a forty-five degree ascent. It will be very difficult to escape through, but the rock can at least be used to brace oneself. The passage disappears up into darkness; it's not clear where it ends, or how.

Gallius smiles suddenly as she realizes Jin-nu is still with her. Noticing her friend's shaky stance, she moves closer, helping her stay on her feet. "Of all the things I thought we would ride into together," confesses the wylding, "I did not think that my greatest terror would be to have only two feet to stand on." Gallius nods a little, "You'll get the hang of it. Besides, we hopefully won't be here too long."

About four yards up, Chi-Yosh finds an outcropping of stone. Bracing himself, and testing it out, he realizes that he could probably support the weight of the others. Everybody can escape the little room, if everyone is careful.

Gallius looks up as Chi-Yosh starts his ascent. She teasingly says to Jin-nu, "Looks like this time I repay all those comfortable journeys you gave me. Just cling to my back tightly and we'll make it." The last is delivered far more soberly. Something about this is.. well, pleasant, despite the danger she's in.

"I'll help you two up then. Davron, help me give them a boost." Ramar moves under the ledge, and kneels before Gallius and Jin-nu, cupping his hands into a foothold. _Not quite what I'd pictured... but there may be more to this Realm._

The passageway reverberates with echoes and coughs, minor sounds of pain as another jagged piece of stone slices open a mark on a cheek or arm, and the organic sounds of skin roughly crossing rock. Even with Ramar's Caste Mark, the narrow tube is dim as anything. Everybody made it safely into the tunnel upward, and even when one person or another nearly slips, the rest of the Circle saves them. The trip feels like hours as time and pain sink into the Solars' bones.

Finally, Chi-Yosh comes to a 'plug' of rock, apparently cut to mesh well with the surrounding stone. It seems to bar the passageway the Solars are attempting, and in frustration he realizes that this is the only way out. Bracing his bare feet against the stone walls, and using his arms to aid in the effort, he contorts his body to press against the rock and begins to push. His grunting and frustrated panting fills the passageway, but inch by inch he feels the 'plug' giving way. The sound of rock toppling outside mingles with a sudden blast of sand-laden winds, hot as fire, and the passageway is filled with the gritty, abrasive gale. There is light above, but it's strange.

The passageway opens nearly twenty yards up the side of a pyramidal stone structure surrounded on all visible sides by desert. The high winds take a terrible toll on the eyes, and sand burns its way into the cuts and scrapes each of the Circle bears from their climb. And hanging in the sky, half-hidden by the desert storm, is a total eclipse of the sun by the moon. Sometimes a good omen, sometimes not.

Gallius holds Jin-nu protectively, even though in this place she has no special strength of her own. "This reminds me of my Lunar Trial," she says softly, coughing at the whirling sand that manages to get into her mouth.

"Ahhh..." Ramar breathes in the arid desert air. He casts his gaze around, narrowing desert-trained eyes, while raising a hand to shield his eyes. "Like being at home again. We'll need shelter. We can either explore this... tomb further, if you like, or we can fashion a sand-cave for ourselves..." There's a pause, "I don't know where we are though. Perhaps seeking a source of water may be of more importance."

In time, the eclipse above fades; once again, the sun shines as it normally ought to. But it is merely warm and bright, not comforting or strong or reassuring. There is no life in the light they witness in the heavens. The sandstorm still rages, but it only blows as sand ought to. There is no feeling of rage, no spirit of the desert howling his madness and exhilaration into the void behind it. Even the stone underneath their hands and feet is merely solid and motionless. It lacks the reliability or permanency of stone. This whole world seems bereft of the spiritual power the Exalted are so accustomed to.

The Circle slowly retreats back into the tunnel, pulling the stone back just a little to provide additional shielding from the biting desert winds. The storm howls on, battering uncaringly at the storm. When it's apparent it will last for a while, Ramar speaks, "Well, while we wait... has anyone else noticed the strangeness of this realm? There's no... well... there's something just off about it all. Empty. Bereft of life... or at least presence. What do you think?"

Davron nods a little. "Yes. This world is just... here. It exists, without knowing how or why, if you will." He furrows his brow, grunting as he shifts position to keep the blood flowing through tired limbs. "Almost... Maybe this isn't a good way of thinking of it, but like the corpse of a world. But that can't be right, can it? Without Essence to maintain it, Creation would dissolve into Wyld..."

Leaning against the cool stone wall, Chi-Yosh flexes his fingers. He can feel the beginning symptoms of dehydration setting in. Pushing the stone plug had drained him more than expected. Still, he peers back to Davron. "Perhaps this world has no Wyld, thus no Essence to need it. If Gaia constructed it, then this world is just simpler, with less conflicts of power."

"We are in Gaia," says Gallius. "Gaia maintains the existance here, I think." She shivers a little, though her eyes show no fear, "But.. I don't know. What we knew is simply not here. That's the easiest way to put it. But there must be real life here somewhere."

Davron nods to Gallius. "Whatever principle maintains this world, it's beyond our ken. In the meantime... enough remains the same, or at least familiar. We must seek some way to protect ourselves from the elements, when this storm abates."

Ramar nods, "We'll need a source of food and water... and warmth. The desert gets cold when the Sun no longer warms the sands. Nothing traps the heat." He chuckles, "But then we're stuck in a dusty old tomb, who knows where... we could be miles from any civilization, if such a thing exists."

"But we can't move in the heat of day, can we?" asks Jin-nu softly. She still relies on Gallius to keep herself upright, far from accustomed to her human body. "The night may be cold, but the heat of day will kill us far faster, if this is a normal desert."

Ramar says, "Aye. If we travel, we do it at twilight, and the early hours of the night. If it gets to be too cold, we'll need to make shelter. The big worry is water."

---

Hours pass, and the wan glow of twilight suffuses the western face of the pyramid. Now that the sandstorm has faded away, the Solars and their companion can see that the surface of it is not truly smooth. It has distinct 'steps', all showing evidence of weathering and age. A descent should be fairly safe, and so the bruised, bloodied and battered travelers make their weary way to the base in slow progressions. There is nothing to be seen but desert, in any direction, as far as the eye can see.

With this new perspective, the Circle can also see that the chamber they must have appeared in is well under the level of the sand here. This structure, if it was resting on a firm foundation of stone at the time it was constructed, must be almost halfway buried in sand now.

Lacking any obvious destination beyond the pyramid, Davron takes advantage of light of the setting... well, call it the sun... to explore the rest of the pyramid itself. After a time, though, he gives up. "There's nothing else to be found here, at least that we have the time and resources to find. No shelter or anything we can use."

"Then we'll have to leave. We'll need to find water first and foremost. Once we've done that... then we can begin to worry about civilization and the rest." Ramar pauses, then asks thoughtfully, "What happens if one dies in the realm of the dead?"

"Let's not find out," says Davron simply.

"We aren't in the realm of the dead," says Gallius. "We are in Gaia, and we are not dead. Death here is likely no different than death in Creation." She frowns thoughtfully, "Perhaps we should just try a direction and hope?"
