In her throne room, the great and terrible being known as the Dowager of the Irreverent Vulgate in Unrent Veils smiles to herself, revealing sharp and blood-flecked fangs. She raises a hand to her mouth; one of the animated snakes that serves her for fingers lashes out, sweeping away a speck of half-digested flesh in a sharp motion. Before her throne are two of her Abyssal servants, both bowed down on one knee, their heads inclined respectfully. "Locate their airship and bring it here," she commands. "Bring alive anyone who interferes, and bring everything aboard it." Both death-haunted Exalts breathe their assent, then disappear into the shadows of her throne room.

The Dowager rises and passes out of her throne room and into a private chamber, spending no more than an eyeblink of time. A bookshelf, its supports carved from human bones and its shelves made of ribs and covered with cured skin, stands between two torches whose green flames gutter and growl in the choking air. And on the center shelf, a great black volume rests. The Dowager's serpentine fingers grasp it and tug it free. As she opens its pages, caressing each one with a measure of twisted love, she croons softly. "I'll keep you safe, my darling..." And under her hissing fingers, the pages writhe and bulge, as though something struggled within them to be free.

The sun is setting, and for a moment the dunes are painted with eerie, almost lifeless colors that linger in the West. Sands travel slowly across the desert, coming to the base of a large pyramid. Ascending this stone tomb, now some sixty feet up, is Ramar. The Solar makes the arduous climb to the peak of the stone monument, scrabbling over sand and rocks. When at last he reaches the tip he stands for a moment, silhouetted by the sun.

_Still yourself. Quiet the beating heart, and the biting winds... shade the glaring light from your mind._ When the Solar opens his eyes once more, this time letting what little Essence he has to command guide his senses, he surveys the world anew. In the wave of sand carried by the winds from dunetop to dunetop, he can see the path of the desert. He can watch its roads, see long past the higher dunes that obscure secrets from mortal eyes. _The desert can hide no secrets from one who has learned well the lore of the sands..._

For miles in every direction, Ramar can see flat stretches of desert sand and black rock. In the cool twilight he can see the textured green of sparse vegetation growing in the interstices of rock that stretch like blood-crusted wounds cut through the sand-dunes. Here and there, a distant cry in the air sounds. Predatory birds or nocturnal animals rising from slumber, perhaps, though they are few and far between, and come from every compass direction. Slightly more common are the nearby squeaking sounds of some kind of flying insect. From the east, carried on the occasional wind, is the tang of fresh water mingled with other scents. There is a river somewhere, though not close by, and with it come the smells of civilization: soil, sweat and mud.

_Even here, in this lifeless place, the sands remain the same._ There is a small, homesick smile lurking at the corners of Ramar's mouth. And a bit of moisture around the edges of the eyes. "We'll travel as the sun sets, and we do not stop until it rises. Speak as little as possible while we travel, and when you can do not open your mouth. We find shelter before dawn." For a moment, Ramar is someplace else. His eyes focus on the distant sands. The sun-scorched sands of the South. He is much smaller and the desert is different. Ramar, much younger, is staring up into the eyes of Golan, the one who first taught him the Ways of the Sand. As he speaks, so speaks Ramar. "If we cannot find shelter we make it. The sand can be used. But walk lightly upon it. A duneslide is deadly, and I do not want to have to dig you out. Be careful." The faraway look in Ramar's eyes fades. He is back in Gaia. "We must go now," and then he leaves the shelter of the pyramid. The sands are beginning to cool, and the light o

"We must go now," speaks Ramar. When he leaves the shelter of the pyramid, the sands are beginning to cool and the light of the sun has not yet gone out. Although there is no longer a lifeless glare in the sky above them. Now the stars begin to creep out under the thin veil of the twilight sky. He gestures to the East, and the river, before setting off across the sea of sand.

Gallius follows, saying nothing in return. She leads Jin-nu by the hand, her mind drifting to thoughts of the times before her exaltation, when stories of the Marukani riders filled her mind. She smiles remembering an amusing tale of a bold man whose boast was carrying his horse across the southern wastes and living by chewing the spined plants that he came across. These she seeks out as they move, hoping to find the truth of the matter. Since Jin-nu stumbles so much, Gallius winds up making the rest of the tale complete by carrying her when her legs grow weary. She laughs for a moment, though she doesn't explain just what she finds so funny.

As the Circle sets out, Davron wraps his arms around him and shivers as the night drains away the heat of the sun from the sands... and how strange it is, that here, that thought is but a metaphor. But better to travel in the night, keep our bodies burning energy to stave off the evening chill. Morning will come all too soon, and instead of his father Helios there will only be a blazing furnace in the sky, its radiance striving to leach precious water from his pores.

Davron's own youth in the rivers and forests of the Hundred Kingdoms is little preparation for this arid wasteland, but it does teach him an important thing: what he does not know. In the forest, he knows how to pick the ground he walks on, how to find shelter or sustenance, whether wildlife or plants are dangerous, all the hundred and one things little things that spell the difference between survival and death. He knows none of these things for a desert.

However, Davron _does_ know that Ramar, who grew up nearer the Pole of Fire, does know those things - or at least some of them. And so Davron follows Ramar's lead as if he were an automaton of flesh and bone, setting his bare feet only where Ramar's had been, taking careful note of what Ramar heads for and what he avoids - and learning as much as he can. It is not, perhaps, as good as knowing these things himself, but it will suffice. He hopes.

Five sets of footprints are left behind in the unforgiving sand as the travelers complete their third night of travel. Chi-Yosh has stayed quiet, studying the bleak landscape in his reflective way. Jin-nu has been learning - slowly - the intricacies of bipedal locomotion, and some of her accustomed grace is returning. The others have fared equally well, although the stinging, bitter taste of insect and wild root still taunts the taste-buds. It is poor fare, but it is better than starvation. Water, too, has been a rare and precious commodity. It can be eked out of the desert with effort, and some of the secrets Ramar tries work here. Others, to his frustration, do not.

Off in the distance, the roar of some beast can be heard, as the Circle prepares to make its camp in the pre-dawn light. Loping over the dunes, they can see the distinctive form of a lion. It seems to be injured, for it moves with a slight limp. Nevertheless it is approaching, and there are few ways at hand to fend it off.

Chi-Yosh holds up a hand, as Ramar moves forward, and Gallius reaches down for a rock. "I've been no help here in the desert," he says, by way of explanation, as he begins walking forward to confront the thing.

For the next minute, the Circle watches, stunned, as a naked man strides up to the hungry and cagey beast. It leaps for him, but the Bronze Tiger is ready. He grapples the beast, using precious motes of Essence to wrap it in a grapple, and a battle of titans ensues. On the one hand, nature's predator, strong and fast and ferocious, armed with formidable weapons and superhuman strength. And on the other, one of the Chosen of Helios, with all the determination and power that makes him Exalted. The two wrestle furiously, rolling about on the sand, the lion clawing furiously but futilely, Chi-Yosh using the Mantis style's distinctive joint-breaking attacks and extraordinary defensive power.

The battle is finished in under a minute, as the lion takes one last leap at Chi-Yosh and he wrangles its neck in both arms. With monumental effort he executes a throw, snapping the beast's neck and sending its bulk crashing into the sand. The stone underneath the Circle's feet shudders slightly, and the gleam of rage fades from the beast's eyes. Chi-Yosh has triumphed.

Scrape. Scrape. One rock drags against another, guided under careful hands until its edge has become as sharp as sun-cooked glass. It pierces through the lion's flesh, peeling it away from the carcass. "Ugh," mutters Ramar. The blood drains away, after Gallius has had her fill. "Now... we cook." Ramar breathes in softly, and with his exhalation there's a spark on the desert sands. The spark becomes a fire. Soon the smell of cooking meat is prevalent as the lion's meat cooks over the open flames. The bones are set aside for later use, and the skin and furs are cooked clean over the fire... in case they too are needed later.

Another three days, and comparatively good eating, put the Circle primarily on rock. The sand is starting to recede, and tall hills are visible to the far north and south. Along the way, the Solars encounter a strange thing. It's a man-made personal fortification of some kind, with sand packed into bags of an unknown substance. At the center of the ring of stacked bags is a series of metal tubes connected to some mechanical apparatus. Brass fittings of an unknown shape lie about on the ground. It superficially resembles a Nexan rifle, but one with several barrels. The ground nearby is wet with water, and a brief experimental taste suggests that the dead lion drank from this water, or water like it. It's contaminated with something foul and to drink it would be unwise.

Gallius lets out a deep sigh as the desert is finally left behind. Her feet, torn and bloodied by sharp stones and merciless sand are more than happy to find the steadiness of more solid earth beneath them. The queen hardly looks the part, her lithe form now rail thin, bones and muscle standing out all over her body. "It would seem we have survived the desert."

Davron is in many ways a different man, as the Circle makes its way free of the parched sands. He too is marked by starvation and dehydration, just as Gallius is - even though he was reasonably fit before, the lion-skin loincloth he wears is at least a size smaller than what he would have worn in Creation. As he hefts the sandbag over his shoulder, he nods to Gallius. "Not out of danger yet, but at least soon we'll be spending less time worrying about merely surviving from one day to the next. And so soon it'll be time to start thinking again about the reason we came here in the first place." He grins sheepishly.

Jin-nu staggers and lets out a sigh. "I never imagined that having two legs less would be such a problem," she whispers. "And not having hooves.." She shakes her head and looks ahead, "But enough of that. We have much to do. And we still don't know exactly where we'll be going." She stares off into the distance, raising a hand to her brow, showing the habit that the briliance of the desert has formed.

"Of course." Ramar turns, and faces the stretch of rocky ground that leads back towards the barren desert where they first emerged. He kneels, "We thank you for guiding us safely through, and protecting our passage." He spits, giving the desert a gift of water. "As you have given us water, we give it back." Ramar stands up, "You are right Jin-Nu. We have not found where we shall head next, but now, we can find water, and civilization. The river should be nearby..."

Two more nights of walking pass. And on the third night, across the distant dunes, the Circle can make out hints of white canvas. A large collection of tents have been pitched in a hollow depression, anchored in packed soil rather than shifting sand. Coming closer, the Solars hear voices. They speak in unknown tongues, a guttural sing-song that bears no resemblance to any of Creation's spoken languages. Silhouetted figures move between the tents to conduct the evening's business.

A cry goes up. Dozens of robed men and women rush out of the tents, almost all of them bearing rifles, and most carry curvy-bladed swords. They quickly dash out, taking up a defensive position in a crescent around the newcomers. Many aim their weapons at the gaunt travelers, and one man - apparently the leader - steps up and barks some sort of interrogative in an unknown tongue. Those who aren't armed are free to gawk, and their principal interest seems to be in Jin-nu (generally) and Ramar (or his hair).

Ramar holds his arms out to the sides, away from the bone-club that rests in the side-hem of his loin-cloth. He bows his head to display that he means no harm. He shall look at the others questioningly, and address the apparent leader, putting a soothing, peaceful inflection in his voice. "We mean you no harm. Although I do not understand what you are saying... are you able to understand me?" He will speak this again, trying every language he knows how to speak... _I hope they do not try and attack us... I hope that they understand us..._

The leader shakes his head, his black beard wagging, and speaks again, angrily, this time in a different - though still foreign - language.

After tense seconds, the apparent leader barks a command, and the riflemen lower their weapons. Sternly he walks forward, approaching Chi-Yosh, and begins to jabber at him, pointing at the three blonde travelers repeatedly as he does. He reserves an especially confused tirade for Ramar, gesticulating at the man wildly, particularly his hair. After Chi-Yosh's stunned silence lasts for several seconds, the man shakes his head in a gesture recognized even across worlds: _who are these fools or demons I've been cursed to encounter?_ And he beckons with a hand. The crescent of villagers parts, permitting free passage, and the man guides the way back to a large tent.

Once inside the tent, the man rattles off a string of commands, and a handful of young women waiting inside scurry off to execute them. He settles down on a woven mat, putting his back against a thick bundle of furs and blankets, and gestures for the Circle and Jin-nu to join him.

Gallius sits with the others and decides to at least try the most basic of communications. She points to herself, "Gallius." She then points to Jin-nu, "Jin-nu." And this she does for the rest of her companions, then turning her calm eyes back to the strangers from this land. Surely they can grasp that much.

The man nods quickly; this much he understands very well. "Siamun," he says, apparently introducing himself. He jabbers briefly, waving his hand about to encompass the tent and what's outside it.

Ramar settles slowly onto the woven mat, sitting across from the black bearded man. He looks at him curiously, an eyebrow raised... _We do not speak the same language, though perhaps it can be learned. We must communicate enough to survive though._ Ramar spends a few moments studying this man, then tries to communicate. First he points at himself. "Ramar." Then... he speaks. "We were lost... uhm..." He gestures West, towards the desert. He traces a triangle in the sand. And then points at it, then points West. He walks his fingers along the sand, "We were in a pyramid... we wandered through the desert uh... looking, uhm," he shades his eyes, as though he were looking in the desert's sun... "And we found you..." He then draws many little tents. And then gestures at the surroundings. "We mean you no harm."

Siamun nods slowly, listening to all this. He talks a little more, then seems to again realize that his audience cannot understand him. Shaking his head and showing hints of disgust at this business, he reaches down with two fingers and draws parallel lines in the sand at his feet. "Det?" he asks, pointing at the lines.

Watching the faces of his guests, Siamun tries another tack. Pointing to the pyramid and then tracing a path east with his finger before stabbing it down onto the sand, he nods quickly - _I understand you traveled from the pyramid_. He points back to the pyramid, then begins gesturing in a wavy spiral outward from it, going in all directions at random before shrugging and extending both hands in a hopeful gesture. _But how did you get there?_

At first, Ramar shrugs. "We don't know..." He gestures back at the pyramid. He traces a line on the sand, then a figure... at least he hopes it's a figure, sitting on the line. He draws the figure then sitting up. "We were... uhm, how to put this. We were asleep. Yes. And when we woke up, we were in the pyramid... we..." He points at the sleeping man, then the sitting man, then the pyramid. "Woke up here."

Siamun recoils in dread at this demonstration, and his hand clasps the hilt of his sword. He points at Ramar specifically, babbling a confused litany of words.

Davron raises a hand, palm toward Siamun. "Hold on..." he says, calmly - though the words won't be understood, the intent should be clear. He then kneels down to draw another stick figure over the sleeping figure, holding a stick... he does his best to make it look like a club... then draws a stick figure carrying another, with an arrow pointing toward the pyramid.

At this demonstration, Siamun nods quickly, relaxing visibly and sitting down again. "Terx," he says, sounding confident, then explaining something else in his unknown language. From his hand gestures, it can be understood that this Terx is some great wave that sweeps over the land - an army, perhaps. He waves his hands again, pointing at one of the young girls who's returned with camel-hide waterskins and gesturing in such a way as to make it clear what 'Terx' do with female captives. It seems clear that he believes them responsible for the Circle's plight. Among the words he adds, something sounds familiar to Gallius - the word 'British', last heard almost a year ago from her dead sister's lips at the Carnival of Masks.

Davron makes one last gesture toward the sand. A finger points over the route by which the abductor - the 'Terx' - had carried the party, and waves erratically as it traces across it. With that motion, he catches Siamun's eye and shrugs, shaking his head. _We don't know the route they took us by - we don't know where 'home' is from here._ And that much is unquestionably true.

Gallius listens to the words of Siamun, catching only one that makes sense to her. "British," she repeats, stumbling over the word. She looks to the others, than back to Siamun. She makes a decision, then. She looks at the makeshift map, then says, "London." Perhaps he can give her a clue of just where she is in relation to the only location she's heard of.

Siamun nods sympathetically, gesturing at the girl, who presents the travelers each with water before backing away quickly. He points to the east, then outside, says one word ("Cairo") and makes a polite gesture, as a servant might to a master. But with this made, he also withdraws a shiny golden coin from a small pouch on his robe's belt, and holds it up for inspection. _I can help you, but it'll cost you._ And showing that he understands the Circle's current lack of wealth, he holds up his hands and smiles in a polite fashion. _Pay me when you arrive._

Davron bows gratefully from his sitting position. "Thank you," he says, hoping once more that the tone and attitude will convey what the words do not.

---

Siamun, and three of his fellows, have camels. And more are provided, enough for everyone in the Circle to ride. Each of the villagers is carrying a rifle and a sword, and though everyone is smiling, they ride in formation around the group. It seems that the desert-dweller intends to be paid for his trouble, and he has no interest in watching them run off. Robes, too, have been provided for the Circle, and the lion-skin can be safely discarded. Siamun, of course, is not particularly interested in distributing weapons.

For days and nights the group rides, passing by other encampments at time. And at last they come to a great and dirty-looking river. Siamun gestures proudly. "Nile!" he announces, with a smile, and speaks to his fellows in that unknown language. He points upriver a ways, indicating a distant barge that will carry the group across. The transit takes the better part of the afternoon, and once across, Siamun again leads the way north. Day after day the Circle rides, periodically stopping to refresh itself, and always Siamun and his men are there, negotiating with villagers and travelers and traders, but always keeping a wary eye on their guests.

At last the travelers crest a hill, and can look out over an expanse of white domes, minarets, and other works of desert architecture. This city must be Cairo, for Siamun and his men are urging their guests to ride forward into it. Through an arched gate they pass, and through busy streets teeming with people of all walks of life. As in Creation, there are beggars, merchants, and men of dubious income to be found everywhere. At least five distinct ethnicities are represented here, and each wears its own unique costume. There are the natives of this place, with their swarthy skin and robes; there are the lighter-skinned foreigners, who seem surprised at the sight of the Circle riding past; there are those who closely resemble Chi-Yosh, and dress in exotic and alien finery; and others. The air is thick with the scent of spices and herbs, although as with much else in Gaia, the tangy odors do not carry the truth of the seasoning with them.

At the iron gates of a marble edifice, Siamun stops. He points at the building, says "British", and adds a few other words. It apparently took him asking directions to reach this place, for he stopped often, and he smiles proudly and happily now, basking in his achievement. He dismounts, urging the Circle to do the same, and points at the doors.

As the Circle makes to obey his directive, he taps Chi-Yosh and Jin-nu on the shoulders, then points to the ground next to him. His intention is clear: _I will be paid, and I can't have everyone running off._

The inside of the building is comparatively cool and comfortable. Uniformed men and women are everywhere, many with lighter hair colors than those outside, and almost universally with lighter skin tones. They seem clean, happy, and comparatively organized. And instinctively the Circle can feel that they aren't native to this region. The desert would reject them if they weren't barricaded here. A well-dressed young woman steps up, seeing the three Solars enter, and cheerfully chirps a greeting in yet another strange tongue.

"Hello," tries Ramar. He is sure to keep his voice, and his facial expression cordial... _Perhaps they can gain some semblance of understanding, and vice versa._ He tries, in as many languages as he knows. "Hello." He remembers Gallius' trick from before, and points at himself. "Ramar..."

The girl achieves a most remarkable feat: her face demonstrates confusion, friendliness and fear simultaneously. She tries again, speaking more slowly this time, and nodding her head as though encouraging a child, with her friendly smile still in evidence.

Ramar tries again. He sighs, looking a little frustrated. He shakes his head to indicate that he's not meaning any harm, then he tries the universal language, that is to say, he starts speaking loudly and slowly. "We are looking for someone named London, who may know someone named Kirchin or British. Do you know these people?"

The woman, biting her lip, nods slowly, gesturing around. She speaks again, mentioning "British" in her explanation, and a related word, "Britain". She thinks again, then beckons for the group to follow her to one wall, on which is a large and ornate map. It is a map of the world, it seems, and she indicates a spot at the northeastern tip of one of the southern land-masses. "Cairo," she says, then stretches up to indicate a small island on the far aside of another land-area. "London," she says, with some elaboration.

"Yes." Ramar nods. "Britain." He points at the island. He looks. Then considers. He points at one of the larger land masses. "Gaia?"

The woman's confused expression deepens and she shakes her head. Meanwhile, two other men have been approaching from one side, and one of them steps up next to her. She and he begin a quick conversation, after which the other man begins addressing the circle. He seems to be a translator, for he cycles through six or seven distinct tongues, apparently trying to elicit a usable response.

Gallius will look to the map and point at London. "Kirchin in London," she says. "Kirri is British." She looks back at the translator, tempted to wave him off, but there's a remote chance that something he says will be useful.

The translator turns to the other man, and shrugs. The man pats the woman on the shoulder, and gratefully she runs off. He himself seems to have taken charge of the situation. He speaks again, pointing at the robes the Solars wear, then pointing outside. It seems he's aware of the others waiting there.

Ramar shakes his head. "We don't know how to speak that language either..." Ramar sighs, then, makes as though he's talking with a hand, then shrugs. _I don't know_.

Gallius finally makes a decision. She gestures to her friends outside, then points to the men around them, making a gesture as if holding a gun. She then holds up a rubbing her fingers together. Reaching down, she pats her hip, indicating as clearly as possible that she has no purse, and therefore, no money.

The head-man ahhs and nods slowly, then turns to the translator, whispers something, and gestures for the front door. That man heads off, apparently to conduct some sort of exchange, and within three minutes, Chi-Yosh and Jin-nu are escorted back in. Through one of the windows, the party can see Siamun and his band re-mounting their horses, smiles on their faces.

Meanwhile, the head-man gestures toward a door in one wall, then approaches and opens it to lead the way.

Gallius looks curiously at the head-man, but sees nothing to do but to follow him wherever he might be leading. It occurs to her that even if she finds Kirri, they won't even speak the same language anymore.

Behind the door is a hall, and the head-man leads the group into one large room with a table and several chairs, all of ornately crafted wood. He gestures at them all to sit, then walks out of the room - apparently to find someone or something more helpful.

Gallius doesn't sit, but looks out the windows, trying to think. She's no sorceror, but she has a feeling that only sorcery can be of assistance, now. "We need to find out where Korash is. Gaia is far too large to search in this way. Going to London may be a foolish move, as well. I rather doubt Kirri will know him. I rather doubt Kirri will understand a word I say, even if she does recognize me."

Ramar takes a seat. He looks around with a rather confused expression on his face. "I see. Well, I suppose none of you have any bright ideas... I don't know where we're to go next, or even how we should find Korash. We should've waited before we left for the Well of Udr. Or not come to Gaia at all." He considers, "But she is your sister, and she has visited Yu-Shan, if only in her dreams... perhaps that is the key?"

Davron spreads his hands. "I don't know any magic that will help. At least I don't think I do." He scratches his head. "It's a puzzle. And here, we don't even have anything of his that we could use to track Korash... though I'm not sure even that would work here, without the full power of sorcery behind it."

Ramar says, "If his name is still Korash that is. It could be changed here. Everything seems to be..."

When the head-man returns, Gallius begins to communicate as best she can. She gestures outside, then holds a hand over her eyes, as if searching. She says then, "Korash." She pauses for a time, then begins to pantomime works of magic, making hand gestures and strange noises in the way of sorcerors.

The head-man shakes his head. He seems to understand the nature of the request, and he speaks some comforting words that no doubt amount to "I'll do my best", but he has no answer.

Gallius nods to the head-man, then stretches, letting out a yawn. She gestures around her friends and then makes a makes a motion as if sleeping, politely indicating that he should let them rest. To her friends she says, "I want to try and communicate with Gaia herself. We probably should have started with her in the first place. Foresight has never quite been our strength, though."

Davron nods to Gallius, and smiles with a show of weariness to the departing man from Britain. Once the room is clear, Davron begins his prayer. The room is rather lacking in such things as candles or incense or any of the other accoutrements that normally accompany a prayer to a powerful god, but Davron senses that such things would not help here anyway, since occult paraphernalia depends on their own internal Essence to form the pattern that alerts the spirit of its call.

Instead, Davron has only his own magic to amplify his occult voice, and he uses it, intoning, "O Gaia, we beseech you - denizens of Creation who are strangers lost in your realm - we respectfully request your audience, and seek your guidance." A faint golden shimmer passes over his forehead, almost invisible even to those who might be looking for it, as his Essence leaks out into the universe.

Several seconds pass... but Davron senses that something is wrong. Sighing, he gets up from his supplicative posture and slumps into a chair. "We can't reach Gaia quite that way," he explains, as he describes the experience. "In Creation, all of reality is permeated with Essence, and when you send out magic, it can transmit from one Pole to the other. Here... that's not happening. I got no sense that my call was going out into this universe at all."

"Then we are rather lost," says Gallius. She sighs, shaking her head. "And we have no idea how to get out of this place, either, do we?" She frowns in thought, "No matter. Our only hope is that this place called London is not very large. We must find my sister and see if she can help us. How she can I don't know. But at this point, we seek her or give up and seek a way home."

Davron shakes his head, shrugging. "We should still keep thinking of other ways. Every possibility we try is another possibility that might work. We may find a hundred ways to fail to find Korash, and it won't matter if we also found the one way that did work."

"And we should also seek a way home anyway," adds Davron. "We will have need of that regardless of whether our mission here succeeds or fails - and I would not be surprised if neither Kirri nor Korash has any way to help us with that."

"Well, it appears Kirri's a very far ways off, so you'll have time to think of those 101 reasons," replies Gallius. "I just don't want to waste time sitting here when we could be moving towards another possible source of help."

"Indeed. You make a doubly good point. We will need to return. Although I can't say how. The only place I can think of..." Ramar considers, "Is that tomb back in the desert. It had markings of the sun, if misunderstood. Perhaps they were a community of what passes for Solars in this realm?"

Davron nods. "And we do have one other clue - the sutra that the Dowager told you. Though it remains obscure to me, which was no doubt her design."

"I don't know what she could have meant by that. Perhaps we are to run then? Run until we can run no more? It will be a ways, but I do not think we can run from Cairo to London." Ramar sighs. "I'm sorry. Getting us through the desert was one thing... I am lost."

"Then let's go to London," says Gallius. "There's nothing better to do."

---

It seems that the man in charge here believes his strange visitors to be from his native island, perhaps suffering from sunstroke or something similar. With sympathy in his voice he explains nonsense in his native language, gesturing periodically at the map. His intention is made clearer when a member of his staff, another attractive young woman, is assigned to lead the Circle to a strange vehicle. It seems to be steam-powered, although the engine is far more compact than anyone has ever seen, and with a sputtering the strange machine and its pilot carry the puzzled party away from Cairo.

They come to a harbor-town on the Nile River, and the woman makes arrangements for passage. She seems wary of the Circle, but solicitous of them nevertheless, and soon they find themselves aboard a steam-powered ironclad ship. It seems that they are bound for London after all.

Over the next month and a half, the steamship sails around a continent and a half. Through the tropical waters of a great sea, then out into a cooler and more hostile ocean. The Solars find their robes gone one morning, replaced by strange and somewhat uncomfortable garments - shirts, pants, over-jackets and other things, all of a scratchy cotton weave. At least it feels like cotton. Gallius and Jin-nu find white dresses awaiting them, and for the rest of the voyage they attire themselves appropriately. The cotton serves a purpose after all, it seems, for the winds on deck blow colder and colder as the ship travels north. Again, certain things seem comfortingly familiar - north is cold.

The city of London is much as Gallius recalls her sister describing it. A river runs through the city, and its wooden buildings, stately towers and aged architecture reveal centuries of existence. The people, too, bear the weight of history on their shoulders, and lurking behind their eyes, the Solars can see the hearts of barbarians and kings. Now on more familiar ground, Gallius is able to prevail upon the party's guide, for her memories of conversation with Kirri lends her a faint remembrance of streets and avenues.

The house is a large wooden affair, with three stories and a picturesque yard. It's in the same place Gallius remembered, but the building itself is a new experience to her. At the door the group is greeted by a sunny old woman dressed in servant's garb, and their British escort briefly explains what the Solars take to be the odd tale of their arrival. The woman looks uncertain but escorts the group into a drawing-room. Their Cairo escort moves to a table and pours drinks from a crystal decanter, offering them around, as the servant-woman leaves.

Gallius looks around with renewed interest. She figures she better start paying more attention, since this trip is going to take a while. Since this trip has already taken a very long while. "I just hope time here moves a lot faster than in Creation. And that Kirri will remember."

Davron rubs his chin, thankful that these courteous strangers had provided him a razor with which to trim the scraggly beard he'd grown over a fortnight in the desert. "I hope so too. If she doesn't remember you... well, I hope she won't be too alarmed by the fact that you somehow managed to figure out where she lives." He chuckles slightly, but he is worried.

Ramar nods. "Well, we shall see." He yawns, and is rather pleased at finally having arrived. He's rather comfortable in the drawing-room, even after all the travelling. "I share the same hopes as you... perhaps we can help her to remember her life in Creation?"

It's at this point that an attractive girl - perhaps sixteen years old - appears at the door of the room. Her chestnut hair is long and wavy, and she wears a beautiful dress of blue and white. She greets the escort from Cairo politely, inviting her out of the room for a moment and holding a whispered conversation. And when she comes in again, she is alone. "G-good day," she says, in halting, thickly accented Riverspeak.
