# Gods of Eden 2004-09-04

In the city of Nexus, there is a man called 'The Black Talon'. He is said to rule the criminal empire that stretches from the Nexus docks to the smithies of Nighthammer, and his name was whispered by a dying man discovered on the docks during Wind's pursuit of his foe. What the Black Talon may know of Wind's father is uncertain, but it is one more stop on the long and weary road of the young Exalt's life.

The boarding-house is small, and tucked out of the way of prying eyes. A warm glow spills out into the street from underneath the heavy wooden door. Wind is talking with the landlord. "I will need lodging for the next few nights. I can pay. Do you have rooms available?"

The seedy-looking man scratches his profound girth and eyes the young newcomer warily. "L'see yer silver first," he belches.

"Very well." Wind reaches into his sleeve and withdraws a small pouch. There are a few silver coins visible at the opening. "I hope this shall be enough."

The man holds out his hand, and sufficient coinage is poured out into the greasy palm to satisfy his greed. Wind is shown to an unkept room with a 'bed' that is only slightly softer than the wooden floor.

Once at his room, and out of earshot of those who might take an untoward interest in the conversation, Wind whispers in softer tones to the man. "I will have more coins for you, if you can arrange a meeting for me. I need to learn more about the goings on in the city. Can you help me?"

The man's eyes narrow in shrewd calculation. "What kinda meeting? Need a lady friend for the night?" he asks, in a carefully neutral voice

"No. I need to learn more about who is who in this place. Who to avoid, who to go to to sell things, where to go to buy things that might not be readily available in shops..." Wind continues, keeping his voice neutral. "I hope this clarifies things."

"Sure.. We'll talk in the morning," grunts the ponderous landlord with an evil chuckle. "Get y'self some sleep now."

"Very well. Good night." Wind regards the landlord as he chuckles. "Sleep well." With that, he closes the door to his room, settles onto the bed, and passes into an uneasy sleep.

In the dark of the night, a hatch in the floor opens slowly and a pair of eyes peek out. With remarkably little noise, a slender form pushes its way up into the room.

Wind tenses, barely. After a moment he forces his body to relax. Without opening his eyes, he listens for the intruder. He remains silent save for the slow rythmic rising and falling of his breath.

The thief watches Wind for a time, then turns their attention elsewhere. The first course of action is to look for a coin purse. Most guests are pretty careful and inventive in how they hide their valuables. Obviously a good search isn't going to be quick.

Creative is an accurate word. There is no sign of Wind's coin purse in sight. He lays there, breathing in and out. Once or twice, his legs twitch, and he turns slightly... but he does not seem to stir.

The thief raises an eyebrow, noticing a tell-tale bulge in Wind's sleeve. How.. quaint. The shadow moves slowly closer, reaching out with a hand and a length of bared steel.

Wind's arms are relaxed. Every now and then he'll move and the sound of coins clinking against one another can be heard. He remains sleeping... it would seem.

The thief moves with a fair amount of skill. This isn't their first time doing this. The cloth of Wind's sleeve is barely moved as two fingers pluck it and the knife is moved closer, readying to cut the fabric away.

Wind waits until the knife is moved to cut fabric. It is then that he strikes, his fist moving as swift as a striking serpent to clutch the thief's knife hand and wrench the bared steel away, while keeping the hand locked in his grip. "Who are you?"

There isn't an answer, just a lot of struggling as the theif first lets go of the knife, then tries to break free. Finally, when this fails, the thief lets out a frustrated squeal and squirms about to try and bite Wind's hand.

Wind strikes the thief three times along the arm, and once on the forehead, each time hitting a pressure point. He shakes his head, "That will get you nowhere," he informs, as he tries to get a better glimpse of the now caught intruder.

The sound of a young girl's sobs of pain answer Wind's attack. Her attempts to escape come to a halt, as well. In the dim light, the tanned face of a poorly fed girl can be seen.

Wind's expression softens. A little. "You've done this before. Do you work for someone, or are you working to feed yourself?" He does not however release the thief.

The face crumples in fear and she answers, "Do whatever you want, it doesn't matter. And I never work for anyone but myself!" She tries a few more times to pull away from Wind, to bite at his hand, anything.

"What I do depends on how you act. I have caught an intruder breaking into my room. However," Wind pauses now. "You may be of more use than you think. Someone like you, probably knows what's going on around the docks, has her eyes and ears in tune with the underworld."

Her words are full of frustration, and her struggling continues, no matter how futile. "Why would I want to help you! You'll just use me up and leave me for dead like all the others, I bet you-"

"You'll help me because I'm offering you a choice." He motions for her to be silent. This particular motion entails clamping a hand over her mouth. His voice falls to a whisper, "Not a sound, and perhaps we both shall live through the night." At that, he listens for the telltale signs of those lurking near his door.

"Kill all those inside!" whispers the greedy landlord, through the door, addressing some unknown troops. Perhaps he suspects the presence of the nocturnal visitor. Outside, the soft song of blades being drawn from sheaths can be heard.

Wind whispers, "They're going to kill us both. Show me how you came in here Hurry. We do not have much time." He keeps a wary eye on the door, ready to burst into action at a moment's notice.

The thief nods and moves quickly, tugging open the trapdoor and moving down it right away. It's clear from the way she's going that she doesn't care much about waiting for Wind.

At that moment the door bursts open, kicked to flinders by the meaty foot of one of the city's numerous mercenaries. This man, joined by seven companions, is wearing armor and bearing a naked blade, which he levels at Wind and his 'companion'. "Die!" he shouts, rushing into the room, and his fellows rush in behind him.

There's a rustling of cloth against cloth as Wind dives down the trapdoor after the thief. He pulls the door shut behind him, and spins to see where it is he's gone.

The thief knows this place fairly well, and so she swiftly works her way to a storeroom. She doesn't just jump down, though. She carefully inches the trapdoor open to take a look and see what she might be getting herself into. If it's clear, she drops. If not, she doesn't.

"Block this way! Fan out! Downstairs, block the exit!" comes a series of calls through the opened trapdoor behind the pair. Meanwhile, they find themselves in a dusty storeroom with a single exit out to the common room.

"We're going to have to fight them," mutters Wind as he drops down into the room behind the thief. "Can you fight?"

The thief looks at Wind for a moment, then thinks of what she saw. She shakes her head and frowns. "If I could fight, I wouldn't have to cut purses for a living, now would I?" she answers in a quiet, angry tone, as if the very question were insulting.

"Then get back. Quickly." Wind tosses the girl back towards one of the crates. He leaps up to kick the trapdoor in the roof closed, while spinning into the Snake Stance, ready to strike the first person to come into the room.

Outside the storeroom, the sound of mailed feet running past can be heard. Apparently the man ordered to the front door is doing his duty.

The thief isn't going to just sit there. She first takes the box of nails and with a grunt heaves it to, scattering the sharp objects under the opening in the ceiling. She then casts about to throw a thin sheet over it. She considers for a moment, then hears the mailed feet. Well, it was a good idea, anyway.

"Alright. We'll need to get out of here. If we move fast they can't all take us on at once. Come with me, I'll protect you." says Wind, as he kicks the door open and steps out into the main room, ready to strike the back of the mailed man as he runs past.

The girl widens her eyes at Wind, but nods and follows quickly. She draws her blade, knowing that it's hardly going to scare anyone in good armor. Her slender stature and hunger-hollowed face aren't likely to intimidate, either.

Wind strikes quickly at the man in mail as he runs for the door. The faster he can be dispatched, the faster they will be able to leave the boarding-house. "There are bound to be more... keep your eyes open..."

Wind moves to the base of the stairs, ready to trip the first few who rush down the stairs, laying in wait for them. "Get his weapon," he hisses to the thief, as he sweeps out with his foot at the heels of the onrushing mercenaries.

The thief needs little encouragement. Before Wind mentions it she's tugging the blade away from the man. One gets the feeling that if the circumstances weren't serious, she'd be taking his belt next. And probably all his clothes. They look to be worth something. She isn't sure running is smart yet, so she'll linger, waiting for Wind to lead the way.

Before the bodies have even hit the floor, Wind is rushing for the door. He takes the thief with him, grabbing her by the hand. As they run out of the door and into the streets of Nexus, he asks, "Do you have someplace safe we can stay?"

The thief looks doubtful for a moment, but doesn't think she's going to slip away. "C'mon!" she says, sounding angry again. She tries to conceal the sword in ratty cloak while moving quickly away. The path is a winding one. Or maybe she's trying to make it hard to follow her. Or hard for Wind to even know where he is. In the end, though, her 'home' is a large drain pipe. At least it doesn't smell, though there is a rat. "Ahh, here it is," she announces. She leans down to the rat, "Hello Prince. Did you have a good day? I got something for you." She holds out a hand, offering some food she stole to the creature, which it takes greedily.

"Huh." Wind surveys his new surroundings curiously. "So, do you know why those men wanted to kill us?"

"You are the one with the money," answers the thief. "What did you do, rob some rich merchanct or something? I didn't think your purse sounded that heavy. Why are you even here?"

"I did not. I asked if I could find out more about the shadier side of town. I need to find the Black Talon," explains Wind.

"Well, if you are a stranger, the first thing to learn is to not ask questions," answers the thief. "Are you nuts, or what? You can't just prance in and throw your money around. People want to stay alive here, and blabbing like a drunk only gets your throat slit."

"I was hoping the landlord would have known. I was wrong." Wind settles back, although he keeps an eye out for unwanted company. "How would you suggest finding the Black Talon then?"

"You don't listen too hot, do you?" answers the thief. "You know, throat slit, blabbing, that thing? I don't do that. I'm a nobody, and anybody can cut me down at the drop of a hat. I don't have much, but I don't talk. Besides, it's not like I know anything worth saying."

"Here's some silver. Find yourself some food, and a place to lay low for a while." Wind looks around, withdraws some coins from his purse. "It may not be safe here."

The thief considers the silver for a moment and frowns. "I don't want to leave Prince alone," she replies sullenly. "Besides, where am I supposed to go? It's not like I'm gonna be hard to find for anyone who wants to."

"Take Prince with you then." Wing sighs, and it's an exasperated sigh at that. "You have no place to lay low? No place you use to hide if you should get caught, or if someone is after you?"

"In case you didn't notice, I'm poor," the thief answers. "Prince is my only friend, and he's the only one I've met who hasn't abandoned me or stabbed me in the back," she adds, sounding more than just a bit angry. "What kinda place is going to take in a pair of rats like us?"

"Then the coins I've given you are going to pay for your disguise and our room and board. You'll stay with me. I shall keep the two of you safe, and in return you will help me find the Black Talon," speaks Wind, with a determined tone to his voice.

"I'm going to help you?" asks the thief. "I imagine I don't have much choice, now do I?" She frowns, her mind imagining that Wind will kill her for anything else. "So where do you think we can hide? I'm going to need to make a lot of changes.."

"I'll find a place. And I will help disguise you." Wind considers. "We will need to hide someplace outside of the Nighthammer district. We will be spending time learning who works for the Black Talon... but then we will be nobodies, and few people pay any attention to nobodies."

"Apparently someone paid enough attention tonight to want me killed on the side," the thief points out. She reaches down to pluck up her friend. The rat seems oddly calm about the whole situation, just turning its head to sniff at Wind. She looks to the rat, which breaks off its inquisitive stare to look back at her. "Okay, okay, fine. We'll follow you."

The trio leave the large drain pipe after Wind has applied a rudimentary disguise. A pinch of grime and soot does wonders for those who would try and identify you at a glance. Wind leads them on a winding, twisting path out of the Nighthammer district. He spends several moments getting the feel for their new surroundings, and after a moment, decides on a run-down inn. "We can stay there for a while... lay low..." he explains. The Night caste procures a room, and checks for passages within. "This should do."
