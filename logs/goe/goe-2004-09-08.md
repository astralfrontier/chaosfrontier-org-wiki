# Gods of Eden 2004-09-08

The girl in the dress smiles and curtseys with moderate grace. "My.. name.. is .. Haley. You .. you know my speech?" It seems that Riverspeak is not a familiar tongue by any means, and her struggles with it are evident, but it is nevertheless surprising to all those in the study to hear their native world's tongue spoken at all.

Gallius offers a curtsey in turn, smiling. "I am Gallius, and yes, we can understand you, Haley," she replies. The real important question is, though, "How is it you are able to speak our language?" She speaks slowly, trying to give the girl every chance to understand.

After a momentary confused expression during which she digests this, the girl speaks again. "Mother name is Agatha. Mother's mother is Ada. Ada dreamed of.. of other place." The girl struggles again to put her thoughts into a language no Gaian has had to use before. "She .. she knew dreams after dreaming. She talked to wise people, asked questions. Told sons and daughters. They told sons and daughters too."

"Does the name Kirri mean anything to you?" asks Gallius. "She was my sister, and she came here," she murmurs. "I don't know when that would be," she adds. "I had thought you might be her, but I am not so sure, now." In fact, she's very confused now.

"Kirri.. what Ada called in life before," says Haley, blushing vividly at her own ignorance of the language. She looks nervous, uncertain of whether she's properly answered.

Gallius smiles suddenly, "Kirri.. she was your mother's mother?" The Zenith smiles widely. "Then in a way, you are my great niece," she says. "Can you take me to my sister? Does she live near this place?"

Haley shakes her head slowly. "Ada.. not living now," she confesses. "House given to children. Lived poor, became rich... died smiling. Like salamanders in autumn." She stops, considering what she said, and shakes her head quickly as she realizes her error. "Leaves gold in autumn." The Eastern idiom is a simple one: things brighten before they pass away.

Gallius nods, "You speak very well, Haley, I am glad to hear she did well." And part of Gallius aches again, as if she were again feeling the loss of her sister. She sighs softly and wipes the back of her hand against her eyes. "In any case, we finally have met someone we can speak to. Would you be willing to let us stay here for a time? We can perhaps find a way to repay your hospitality, but we are very lost."

Haley herself looks more than a little lost, as she works to parse what Gallius just said. At last she nods her head, hoping she got it right. "Stay here if you want."

Chi-Yosh glances to Gallius, before looking back to Haley. He has been mulling over their situation. "Give us a few days, and we can afford our the stay here."

Ramar considers this for a moment or so. After a while, the Solar asks a question... he keeps his voice soft, and speaks slowly, so as to give Haley a chance to comprehend. "You said Ada talked with wise people... is... is there a way we can find these wise people, or their sons and daughters?"

"Some, yes," the girl says. "They .. they.. " She speaks her native language for a moment, trying to convey something. "They come here to learn sometimes."

Gallius curtseys deeply to Haley. "We are very grateful," she replies. "Though we did not come here for pleasure, I hope we have time to talk. If you have time, I wish to hear everything about Kir.. about Ada." She falls silent then, her mind turning inward.

"What... what do they come here to learn?" Ramar asks his question, then turns towards Gallius, offering her at the very least a soft smile. "I am sure your sister lived a beautiful life in this realm, as she did in Creation."

Haley looks totally lost at what Ramar added, but the first part she seems to grasp well enough. "To learn about place you come from," she says.

"Where are these other people from, Haley?" asks Gallius, finally coming out of her shell again. "Is there a map here? So we can see where things are?" She figures it might be a good start.

Ramar asks Haley, "Do the wise people have dreams of the place before?"

The girl nods, finally on firmer ground - knowledge of her own world. She shakes her head no to Ramar's question as she calls for the aged serving-woman, and the servant retrieves a collection of maps and other papers. These are brought into the study and spread out over a table for inspection. "World." says Haley, indicating a map of blue water surrounding a number of land-masses. Much of the map is indicated in keyed colors, and Haley explains what these mean: "British Empire".

Gallius watches with interest, trying to understand as much as she can. The main problem being that the maps dimensions don't really mean anything to her. "So we are in London, which is controlled by the British Empire."

Haley nods. "You come from.. here." She points down on the map, indicating a region south and east.

"And where are those who want to know more about us?" asks Gallius, trying to get back to the other point. "I think we may need to talk to them. They might be able to help us, and we might be able to help them, as well."

"From here, in London," says Haley. "Also here.." She points out places, reciting names to go with them. "Paris. Zurich. New York."

Chi-Yosh observes the map, seeing the vast difference between Creation and Gaia. Although... He reviews the Eastern side of the map, tracing the lines of some islands in the upper right hand area. Some of the islands look like the West's geography, but not quite.

Chi-Yosh then turns to Haley. "How did these people know Ada?" If they didn't, perhaps they found her through some connection. "Were they friends, or..."

"Hmm..." Ramar considers the map. He traces his finger along the edge of it, then asks, "What lies beyond the edge of the world?"

Haley just looks at Ramar as if he's crazy, then devotes her responses to Chi-Yosh. ".. Thinkers," she says at last, trying to come up with the word she wants. "People who write and speak. Students, teachers. Learned through other men from London. They write... each other."

Gallius wonders at this. "They write each other from such distant places as this map shows?" she asks. She remembers the journey here well, and it was quite long. Such a correspondance would surely take weeks or months, at that speed.

Haley nods to Gallius. "Write, and also.. " She traces a line with her fingers, then makes a tapping motion, and says a word in her own language.

Gallius repeats the word in Haley's language. Or at least comes close. "I don't understand that word. What does it do?" Obviously it's some kind of communication. Perhaps there is some sorcerous device that has been made here? "Can you show me?"

Ramar tries to pronounce the word. "Telluhgiraff." He shakes his head. "What strange language... but perhaps you can help us to understand the ones who come to learn? Do they speak this language? How do they learn of the place before?"

Haley nods. "I show.. but later. We travel the city, later," she says. "Eat now, rest."

Gallius nods to Haley, "That does sound like the smartest thing. And maybe we can take a bath and get the dust of our journey off of ourselves." She looks to the others, "It seems we are just getting started."

---

Over the next week, Gallius spends almost every waking moment studying this new, curious language. She has a few reasons. One is that her sister spoke it, and even left a few things written in her own hand behind. Another is that it is immediately useful. The last is that it will serve as a useful tool in Creation. Firstly as a way to send secret messages past mundane spies. When the wars are over, it will serve as a way to help prepare souls for Gaia.

It is the Eclipse who foster communication in Creation. Language is one of the chief means of this. Ramar understands this. He also understands the subtle nuances of the different languages... this... English is something new. It is unlike anything he's seen before. It fascinates the Solar, who spends several days learning it. Before too long, the Eclipse is able to converse in English. _Such a language has many uses, and now, at least in Gaia, I can help my Circle to communicate with others._

The Solars learn more. The year, as the Gaians know it, is 1937 A.D. - almost two millennia after the birth of a prophecied god in the East. Several decades have elapsed since Kirri's Gaian advent. Questioning Haley about the things said during the last Carnival of Masks, the Solars learn one other thing: an overheard phrase, "Primus Pilum", does not refer to anything in the modern world. It was a rank used by the soldiers of a long-ago empire, centuries in the past. It seems that not all the 'shades' drawn by Gaia to Carnival were from the same era.

The modern world has been shaped in large by a war of two decades ago, and even now there is a civil war being waged in the kingdom of Spain, to the south. And the rumor of war has been spreading across the globe. That in itself is an oddity - a round world, where if you go East far enough you arrive in the West, adn vice versa. There is no Wyld boundary in this place.

Gallius doesn't limit herself to staying in Haley's house, but instead takes every opportunity to do some exploring. She doesn't go far, but even a short trip reveals the wonders of Gaia. On most trips she encounters the curious moving hulks that the terrans call automobiles. She thinks they are loud and, from what she can tell, horribly unreliable. There are other wonders, though. The broad streets and tall buildings catch her eye. In particular the cathedrals of London leave her in awe at what these people have done with little but their own hands.

Chi-Yosh decides that despite the lack of the Essence that embues Creation, the people are still the same; wars are happening, strife and pain, the steady hard work and exploitation that happens; urban sprawl, crime, bars and merriment and music; faith, surprisingly even when there is no presence of a God to prove their worth and existance. All that has changed is the scenery. This does not bother the Su'Katan, but reassures that Creation, with its' magics and blessings, has not spoiled man, or corrupted him, and that no matter where man is, and what his people have, he will be man.

"This world is fascinating..." Ramar has said those words several times since arriving in London. Once he's understood the language... he takes to the outside world a lot mroe often, observing the wondrous things that happen herein. People take to their daily lives thundering in metallic beasts of burden, or they ride about on wheeled steeds, spurred on by pedals... "So intiguing... and yet very efficient." For his part, he has tried to speak with some of the beasts of burden, which garners an unusual, though not always unwelcome reaction from some of the creatures. "And the cuisine!" Suffice it to say, Ramar has thrown himself into the swing of things. He sees fit to learn as much about this new world as he can. From visiting the tombs that contain knowledge of times before, to observing illusions of one form or another dance about on a screen... "Fascinating..."

Chi-Yosh still does not ignore the city and its' wonders. Like he had in Nexus, the Dawn is overwhelmed by the impressive urban world, but this one is just more sophisticated than Nexus. He spends time wandering the great Museums, letting Ramar translate what's on display. The moving pictures are interesting, to say the least, though he is disturbed that something can be imprinted with his image. However, for a time, the Su'Katan stands outside this Buckingham Palace, matching stares with the tall-hatted guard. Not out of disrespect, but deciding the British know something of meditation, and thus joins in it across from the man.

Through it all the Solars have become accustomed to the bland, lifeless nature of things. In the first three days, they caused Haley a great deal of distress by over-seasoning their food. Even after triple the amount, it still seemed to be missing something, and the overseasoning didn't help a great deal in the end. They discover they can do something nobody else can do here, which is to stare at the sun for many seconds or even minutes without incident.

Normally, Davron would be just as entranced as the others - in his own way, of course; studying these 'automobiles', learning about the 'telegraph', and all the other marvels that the Gaians have created. And indeed it still does fascinate him, how these people, in the absence of magic, have instead devoted themselves to learning about their mundane world, to the extent that they can almost rival lesser sorceries. But Davron cannot stop thinking about the task that brought the Circle here, and even after several days that goal seems as distant as ever.

As the days pass, Davron becomes more withdrawn, taking to brooding in quiet rooms and drawing occult diagrams, then carefully burning them in the fireplace lest they alarm their hostess. It is soon plain to the rest of the Circle that something is on Davron's mind, that he is reluctant to talk about.

Eventually the wonder of the city wears off, and the task at hand must be considered. She returns only after showing a few soldiers the real way to handle their swords. Which caused a lot of raised eyebrows and confusion. It's clear the lessons about the proper place for a woman haven't quite stuck with Gallius. It reminds her that this is not home. It reminds her that somewhere an entire kingdom waits for her return. She can only turn to Davron, hoping that the mystic will have the answers she needs, and so she goes to his door, only to find Chi-Yosh already there, knocking. "It seems we have the same idea," she murmurs.

Chi-Yosh nods solemnly. "Our Circle is perceptive and supportive. Let us be the pillar for our sagging comrade." He waits patiently, listening for sounds beyond the door. The Dawn has a few suspicions as to what may be troubling Davron, but no diagnosis can be made without reviewing the patient.

Soon after, Ramar arrives. "Well... what are we waiting for," he asks. "We've all had the same idea it seems, so, let's go inside." He looks around carefully. "I only hope that there's something we can do to help him... he looks so troubled you know..."

Haley's servant admits the trio and escorts them into the study. Haley herself is out for the day, seeing to some of her own business matters with her solicitor.

Davron is surrounded by sketches as the Circle enters, and his dour face brightens a little at the entrance of his friends. "Hello again," he says. "We've been learning and exploring this strange world for some time now. And a fascinating world it is, but... have we come any closer to finding what we came here to seek?"

"That is why I came here," says Gallius. "And perhaps why the others have, as well. I haven't any idea exactly how to get what we need, nor how to get back home. This sutra you described doesn't seem too easy to decipher, either."

"Well, I'm not sure as to the sutra... I hope it is relevant. Though it is merely what the Dowager had told me just before she pushed me into the Well." Ramar considers, "Perhaps it has something to do with the constellations..." He shrugs. "You have been thinking of Sorcery though, Davron?"

Chi-Yosh crosses to sit across from Davron. He doesn't quite say anything just yet, because the conversation has moved to the Circle's goal, but he watches Davron, to see if their neglect of the search is what has been drawing the Solar into seclusion, or if something else gnaws at his core.

Davron nods. "We already know that the souls who come to Gaia may have different names than they did in Creation, so the name 'Korash' will avail little, if he does not use it. No, I do not think we will find Korash by mundane means. Which leaves, as Ramar said, only sorcery." He looks at Gallius grimly. "I told you before, in Cairo, that I knew no sorcery to find a man. This is true, but it is not the complete truth. I cannot find something directly by magic. But... I may be able to summon something that can help."

"Summon something?" asks Gallius. "And what would that be?" she asks quietly. She notices Davron's expression and considers. "Whatever it is, it doesn't seem to be something you are very eager to speak of."

"I do not relish the idea of summoning a demon into Gaia," says Davron. "The inhabitants of Malfeas do not belong here any more than we do. But we have no other choice." He rubs his brow. "The problem is... even _with_ a demon, I cannot yet figure out what we have about Korash that would lead us to him. His past life is not enough - even aside from the fact that we have no token of it."

"Perhaps then there is something we can learn from the 'wise people' that Haley spoke of. They may know something of Korash, or of his life. We may be able to track him down without needing to resort to a demon... or at least find a place to start from." Ramar considers, "If they are to arrive at any time that is."

"Actually, it's unlikely they'd know anything," says Davron. He's studied the issue thoroughly, and has talked to Gallius and Hayley about their experiences. "The situation is this.."

---

A young woman, Ada Kensington, lived in the city of London. She had lived an unexciting life in the Victorian era of her homeland's history. In all respects she was no different from any of the other millions of girls alive in her day and age. But one night she awoke from a dream that had no parallel, one that sparked in her the absolute conviction that she had lived once before.

She sought out some of the spiritualists and mesmerists of her day, paying them what little money she could afford. And through the art of hypnosis and past-life regression, a popular topic among the students of the occult at the time, she eventually regained a great deal of knowledge about another existence. This lore she passed on to her children, and they to theirs.

She made a considerable fortune speaking and consulting on the nature of past lives and reincarnation. Her experiences were some of the most credible and well-understood that any of her audience had heard. As the years passed, Ada grew old, and her stories became unfashionable - not because they lacked in great detail, but because they were of little use to the inhabitants of this "Earth". Such dreams or experiences could not be unlocked in anyone, it seems. Those who continued to work with her and her children became less uniformly serious, and Agatha and Haley after her were obliged to fend off any number of cranks or con-men.

A number of scholars of the occult have continued an interest in the family, and Haley has cooperated with them as fully as possible. She has continued to elude the advances of the unscrupulous, and she can afford to live a relatively comfortable life with the money bequeathed to her by her ancestor.

---

It has been decided that Davron will consider the matter more thoroughly. In the meanwhile, the others will need to meet with some of the spiritists and students of the occult. There is a man called Randolph Derby, a writer of travel books of some reputation. He has traveled extensively around the globe and has been one of the most reliable men Haley has dealt with. She has offered to introduce the Solars to him and a few of his fellows.

Gallius is more than happy to be of use, and she knows her talents are the key to making these occultists more willing to lend assistance. With some help from Haley, Gallius is even properly dressed for the part. A formal ball is called for, to 'introduce her to society'. Gallius is introduced as a distant relation, new to London (which helps explain her occasional drifting into strange accents.)

Mr. Derby is encountered in due course, and a charming and fascinating conversation ensues. Gallius has fenced before, verbally and otherwise, but never before has she had to dance around her topic so delicately. In the end, though, Mr. Derby agrees to re-visit the house. This takes no convincing at all, but at the end of the encounter, Gallius has learned little more than she started. In a world with no Essence, it seems that occultists are little more than hopeful dreamers.
