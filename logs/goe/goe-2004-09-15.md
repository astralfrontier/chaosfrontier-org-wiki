Gallius is quick to adopt local fashions, including a parasol. The color isn't precisely what she'd select, but she is a stranger here, and honestly, after a while, the color pink starts to grow on her. Her one point of resistance involves hats. A truce was made and instead she wears ribbons in her hair. She learns quickly the proper carriage of a lady, as well as the proper place of one. The latter is the most difficult for her to grasph, coming from a background where men and women are equal in all things. Clearly in this world that is very different.

With her free week, Gallius does her best to learn what she can of the poetry and music used in this curious world. She is disappointed by the dances they use here, only impressed when she sneaks a peak at the more vigorous dances of commoners. She does not join them, but makes a not of their joyful motions and raucous songs. Haley naturally directs most of Gallius' energy at more refined society, introducing her to the lords of the land. After all, this great aunt of hers might need to have a real place in this world.

For his part, Ramar is doing his best to adapt to the... local color. It's not as difficult as he first supposed it would be. The outfits are similar, trousers and a shirt. A very comfortable shirt, or so he claims. His hair though is... well, it's blue. It's chalked up as an eccentricity of someone who's not from around here. He does cap it off with an intriguing little hat. It's round, and black... "I believe they call it a bowler..."

For the first time in a long while, Ramar relaxes. He sleeps in a little late, and enjoys a week of having little to worry about. _This new world is strange... but it is at least somewhat peaceful._ He has enjoyed learning of the Automobiles and the Bicycles... and seeing how the people travel the streets of their city. The movies, and the stage have also been spots he's visited. He tends to make sure to see the more lighthearted performances. When he returns, he shares the news of the outside world with his companions. Tales of flying machines and ships larger than any Ramar has seen... "They made such horrendous noise! You'd think they were run by demons..."

Chi-Yosh, despite the feeling of awkwardness, dresses in cheap but modern clothing. Trousers of a drab grey, material that has a slight itch to it. Tucked into this is a white "Oxford" hugging the defined muscles beneath. Above this is a simple, brown jacket that fights the chill and wetness of London. Worn loafers were abandoned for workmans boots, and with Haley's suggestion, the Su'Katan tucks his long topknot into a bowler. The ensemble does not offer the range of flexibility he would like, but utility is not the prime function. It leaves him looking like a half-swelled sore thumb, but in a city where foreigners are a small minority, he is not as out of place as he could be.

At first, the Dawn had decided to work on building himself for the return to Creation, honing his reflexes to their peak. It occured to him on the second day the selfishness of this; being in Gaia for an unguessable amount of time, and gifted with a schedule free of the normal Solar duties, Chi-Yosh has the opportunity to touch many lives, improve them, help them with the personal touch that running a nation and having a full schedule just does not allow. He goes out into the city, first into the common, poorer sections, and sees that his hands can do great work here. The scream of sirens and a great, wheeled steed drives past. Following close behind, the Dawn discovers the hospital. While knowing just a few key words in English, inside the hospital's walls, it isn't long before he is at least accepted as an assistant due to skill displayed in the hospital's waiting room.

The rest of the week is split between the slums and the hospital, where the language gap proves difficult, but the Dawn makes some leeway.

After a few days of this, Ramar returns with some interesting news. "There's a concert of sorts... a tale of gods and monsters, if these messages are correct... I don't suppose any of you would care to accompany me?"

Gallius looks up from her reading as Ramar enters. "A concert?" she murmurs, looking a bit doubtful at first. "Well, I suppose I should get used to enjoying this place, shouldn't I? I will go with you, Ramar," she says. "It might help take my mind off other things." She looks over to Jin-nu and the girl shakes her head, "I think I'd just as soon stay here, Gallius. Things are so noisy out there."

Chi-Yosh, taking time to rest after a long day, looks up to Ramar in consideration. "Gods and Monsters. We can't escape them." Smiling wryly, "I will come. A shame Davron cannot join us; he's been pacing for days now."

"Good, it's settled then. We'll go." Ramar considers things a while... "You've all been so terribly productive... perhaps I should follow your examples instead..." He shrugs. "Well, in any case, we should go. Perhaps when we return, Davron will have finished his pacing, and we can be of use." They leave the estate, riding in one of the mechanical steeds towards the city's lights.

The show is... well nothing they're quite as used to. The music is beautiful, though as is everything in Gaia, it is also empty. There's a sense of longing to the music, of longing for life, for that almost intangible thing that is missing. With a dramatic theme... the curtain goes up.

The story is left to the musicians. There are a few performers who help to illustrate the musicians' work, though they sing in a language that is not English. They rely on one another to convey the mood of the performance, to convey the tale of gods who are at war with well, many things it would seem. Who fall prey to pride and hubris and and betray one another... ultimately it is this which brings them low. Though there is much more to be told.

Gallius pays attention to the singing, but finds something lacking in it. Perhaps it is the location itself, but it doesn't seem that way. Her distractions make it harder to enjoy the concert in the normal sense, but in her own way she's quite pleased finding just what is missing as she listens. She does want to know all she can about Gaia.

Chi-Yosh enjoys the fact that likely most of the audience doesn't understand the words, so it is an interpretive art rather than an explanation. Not having the ear for music that Gallius does, he merely lets the orchestra set the tone, while paying attention to the interplay of the gods. While not perfect, there are some similarities between the Celestial Bureaucracy and the gods in the play. It must have been like this at the Usurption, where when Solars were removed from power, the system of spirits broke down.

The show winds down, coming to a conclusion at long last. The world is crumbling it would seem, but even so, the orchestra manages to suggest hope still remains. The audience claps when all is said and done. Ramar nods to his companions, "Well... that was... interesting I think. Curious, wouldn't you say?"

Gallius hmmss? She starts out of her musings and nods, "They were a bit flat during the first movement, and there were many measure that were rather overdone and pompous. I must say the whole thing bore a heavy curtain of arrogance to it," she says, shaking her head. "Not to mention that two of the.. what do they call them? Violins, I think. They were just enough out of tune to distract my ear."

"Or ominous," the Dawn, as he eases to his feet. "But, my head is in Creation too much. It does offer hope to hold, in the end." He chuckles at Gallius, patting her shoulder. "We have to deal with this world."

The Solars depart before everyone else... after all, there's no real interest in milling about to discuss what might pass for an adequate piece of performance in this realm... they've heard better. The carriage awaits them, and putters and sputters on the way back to Haley's estate. "Well then," says Ramar when they arrive, "Lets see if Davron's worn a groove in the ground yet or not..."

When the Circle returns, they find a change in Davron's attitude. Where he had been brooding before, he now displays the intense concentration that is his wont when pondering a challenging problem. Obviously, he has had a breakthrough, and when they can rouse him from his work, he explains what it is.

"Cecelyne the Endless Desert touches all shores," explains Davron. "This is how a demon can be summoned from Malfeas at all. It only requires the will of a sorcerer to invoke the pact that allows the demon to cross Cecelyne and enter Gaia... or Creation."

Davron folds his arms, smiling. "So when I summon the demon, I will not set it directly to the task of finding Korash. Instead... I will send it into Creation, and to Nane, where it will seek out the Master. If anyone knows what magic we can use to find Korash here, he will know... or he will be able to find someone who does." He turns to his papers again. "Now all I need to do is decide what manner of demon is best suited to that purpose - and also is weak enough physically that we can dispatch it if the summoning goes awry. I've got a few candidates here..."

Gallius nods to Davron, then, "I will have to ask Haley to borrow a weapon for me, and then I can put whatever demon you summon in its place," she says confidently. The statement to some might seem absurd, considering the elegance of the lady's dress, but the strength in her eyes would swiftly banish their amusement. "It is good to see you have finally found something to help us. And perhaps the Master will know a way to get us out, as well."

"I... I've been thinking as of late Davron... perhaps there's a way now-since we can send a message back and forth-do you suppose we can determine what sort of relationship, if any, time passing here has, with time passing in Creation?" Ramar looks around, "At least, I think that's what I mean to say."

Davron nods to Ramar. "That's a good question, and we should be able to find out the answer when the demon returns." He taps a sheet. "An Oaunromina, perhaps. They can shift their form, so it will find it easier to seek an audience without panicking the citizens of Nane. It lacks the mental focus to memorize our message to the Master, but it will be able to deliver a note to him, and bring one back. The Ouanromina also enjoy traveling - that'll be useful on this errand, I think."

"Alright..." Ramar looks a little uneasy, perhaps it's the prospect of summoning demons... "I... I trust you to know about these things Davron. If that is what you think would be best, then let us try it. Is there anything I can do? I feel so... so helpless."

Gallius has little to add. Well, except this. "You think that demon could bring us better equipment? Do you think that orichalcum would even work?" She'd be happier with that material in her hands.

"It will already be carrying a note from the Master, and possibly some object that is linked to Korash," says Davron. "If it can carry anything else, we can always try. However, I advise against asking it to bring orichalcum - I suspect that it would be nothing more than gold here, just as Jin-nu is a human and you have no tail."

"I wonder..." Ramar pauses for a moment, "Do you suppose the others are alright in our absence? If... I mean, what would Cloudburst do after we have been gone for so long..."

"Cloudburst can take care of herself," says Gallius. "It is my people that I worry about most, and our kindred, as well. I simply trust that Dace and Yana are keeping the nation safe." She actually sounds rather confident of that, as well.

---

Gallius and the rest of the circle, as well as a very grateful Jin-nu, head out of London on train. The voyage is rather comfortable, despite the noise of the lumbering machine. Their destination is a small country village, a place where they can easily find an area from anyone's sight. And far from risking a lot of lives. Gallius remains well-dressed, passing off the group as a family touring the countryside for a fine vacation. The ruse seems to work well, as the only source of gossip is speculation on whether or not the Lady Gallius might need a proper husband. And of course the expected questions concerning some of her more strange friends.

The circle makes there way past what few eyes would be interested in their actions. It takes very little time for them to find an old shack that hasn't been used in months. Perhaps it is someone's seasonal home. If so, it's empty now, and there is plenty of room outside and in for this work to be done. Gallius considers things and decides the empty barn is the best place. "It wouldn't do to damage someone's house. At least a barn shouldn't be wrecked too badly in this." She turns to Davron, then, "It's time."

Davron nods to Gallius, and unpacks the kit of supplies he'd purchased in London from an assortment of 'occult' shops. Its contents are sparser than he would have liked, thanks to both a limited budget and a lack of truly exotic ingredients, but it will suffice. The most important part of the ritual is the Essence he himself will expend in the call to Cecelyne - and the Essence with which he will charge the ritual components. Though they have no Essence of their own, their very nature should still shape his Essence into the patterns that will weaken the demon's will.

For the rest of the day until sundown, Davron is busily making preparations - marking the summoning circle with a tiny amount of powdered silver but mainly with chalk and caked salt, placing candles and incense burners in auspicious locations, and drawing warding sigils in the strange calligraphy of the Old Realm. Any Gaian who were to see this circle would surely fear and dread it - it's clear to Davron that the memories of demon-summoning in Creation still echo here. Cleanup will be essential, when the ritual is complete.

As the sun crosses the horizon, Davron directs his companions to their places outside the circle, ready to set upon the Ouanromina if it defies Davron's will, and then, one by one, lights the candles and incense. As the night wears on, hour after strenuous hour, Davron's anima flares brighter and brighter, wavering in unison with his sonorous chanting, invoking the ancient pact between the Yozis and calling forth one of their spawn to this strange world.

At the center of the improvised circle, a black shape begins to form. Bound by brightly glowing runes on the ground, a thing begins to crawl its way up from the ground. It does not break the floor so much as pass through it materially. At first it seems to have two clawed arms, and what might pass for a head, but as it surfaces Davron and the others can see more clearly its true nature. The thing is made up of tiny shelled creatures, like miniature cockroaches, that squirm about and scuttle to form its repugnantly humanoid outline. An entire shape, complete with legs, a torso, and a swishing tail, finally rises from the circle. In a rasping chorus of chittering, the thing 'speaks', and Davron struggles to make out its words: _Hated one, I serve you._

Davron suppresses a shudder as the living swarm manifests itself, and is only grateful that the monstrosity will not spend long in Gaia - it clearly belongs here even less than he himself does. He pulls a sealed letter from a shirt pocket. "You will go into Creation and deliver this to the one known as the Master..." he begins, explaining its mission.

The note reads: "Master, I am in need of your assistance once more. My Circle and I have arrived in Gaia in search of the sorcerer Korash, who had some knowledge of the Book of Three Circles and is said to have been reborn here - but I lack any magic to find a man, and in any case I have nothing here that has an arcane link to him.

"If you know of a way to find a man in Gaia by way of his past life in Creation, one that I will be able to execute from here, I will be deeply grateful. One thing that may help you: his son, Ice, is one of the members of the Wyld Hunt that now resides in the Nation.

"Also, we seek a way to return to Creation. The only clue we have is the sutra: 'Once, there was a maiden, who learned that the faster she ran, the faster she could run. Thus, running consumed her; until, one day, she flew beyond the ending of her life. "And here I thought it'd last forever," she said. "But-" "There's always an ending," said the run.' I know it is Sidereal in nature, but I do not understand its meaning clearly enough.

"I thank you once again for all the help you've given us in the past. If we cannot return home, know that we will always remember you fondly. Signed, Davron."

The Oaunromina staggers about, quivering like a muddy jelly, and the Solars can see what is happening: each of the miniscule creatures that composes its "body" is extending its wings. The wings are a bright multicolored rainbow, and as the creatures rearrange themselves, the combined shades "paint" an image. In moments the thing has adopted the form of a swarthy, bearded man wearing dusky traveler's robes common in the deserts of the South. _I will do as you command,_ the chittering echo comes, and the thing extends a hand as real-seeming as any man's to accept the letter. And outside the barn, the Circle can clearly discern the barking of a dog. It is very close.

Gallius turns away to step outside the barn. She's already composing a lie. She thinks it might even work. But first, she has to see who her audience is. And how much trouble they are all in for intruding in someone's barn. Thankfully she has silver and gold to handle most transgressions.

The dog is a burly beast, with a shaggy gray coat, of a type nobody has seen. It somewhat resembles the Northern 'mammoth-dogs', but its ears are shorter, and its fur isn't white. It wears a collar, and the end of its leash is held in the brawny grip of an old man whose salt-and-pepper beard bristles alarmingly as he speaks. He has a long rifle-like weapon under one arm and seems prepared to go for it if necessary. "Whatchoo doing here, strangers?" he demands, speaking English in the thick rural accents of the country folk of this kingdom.

"We were sheltering for the night," answers Gallius. "I'm terribly sorry. Is this your barn?" she asks. "I didn't wish to have us impose on anyone, but it did not seem like anyone was home. I apologize, and I am prepared to offer fair compensation if you will just let us stay the night. In the morning we will be back on our way." Into this little performance she puts all of her efforts, her presence and charisma unbridled now, though she is smart enough not to use charms. Yet.

"This's the Sutter barn," the man responds gruffly. "Y're trespassin'. Now.." He reaches down for his gun, waving it about for emphasis as he continues. "Put that light out, take y'r things, 'n be on y'r way."

Gallius looks offender, her back stiffening and her demeaner suddenly very much that of a noblewoman. "Surely you would not turn away a woman in the middle of the night, sir," she says, sounding breathless and frightened. "Why the night air will do terrible things to me! Surely you wouldn't? I will pay you, if that is what you wish, but please let us stay here. My feet are weary and I can't walk all the way back again." Here she moves closer to the farmer, reaching for his sleeve, "Sure you wouldn't turn me out, would you?" she asks, turning a sad, vulnerable expression on the man.

The country man's demeanor softens. "If y'need a place to stay for the night, me 'n the missus will put you up," he offers at last. "We've aught but a few beds since the boys left, but you are welcome." The weapon is lowered, and he waits patiently for his offer to be accepted.

Meanwhile, in the barn, Davron has noticed something unexpected. While he was actively expending power, his anima banner burned with the starfire of his Essence. Now that the spell is complete, the extraneous Essence is being sucked greedily into the air and wood of the barn itself. Gaia's mundane existence seems content to leech every mote of power it can from him, and within a minute his anima banner has flickered and died.

Gallius lets out a relieved sigh, moving to take the man's arm. "Oh thank you!" she says warmly. She says then to her friends outside, "Chi-Yosh, Ramar, would you please pick up the things and follow us?" It's about this time Jin-nu peeks outside and then moves to join Gallius. "Come, cousin, this fine man is going to let us have a safe place to stay for the night!" says Gallius. Jin-nu offers a most grateful smile to the man, and a rather wary glance at his large dog.

Davron blinks in the sudden and unexpected darkness, and then sets about to meticulously clean away the remnants of the ritual, dousing the candles one at a time and stuffing them in the bag. Once again, the strangeness of Gaia fascinates him, and once again pressing concerns prevent him from dwelling on it at length.

Ramar looks around strangely, watching the Essence beomce drained away... watching how now the barn seems to change... seems more... real. He whistles, and picks up the bags as requested. "Yes, ma'am." _Interesting. I wonder if the demon will be able to return..._

"'Chi-Yosh?' 'Ramar?'" The old man whistles through thick lips. "Y'got furrin' soundin' names, there, you lads," he says. "See that y'don't misbehave around me missus." And so saying, he turns, leading the Solar party off into the night with his dog in tow.
