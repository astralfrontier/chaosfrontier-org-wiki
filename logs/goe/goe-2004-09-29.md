While restless, Chi-Yosh sits on the curb before the hospital, mulling over his situation. While before, the Hospital had accepted the extra assistance due to a rash of accidents; a broken leg by several riding students during a botched jaunt, a violent row between police and an overly aggressive rugby team, and so on. Yet now, a stranger who doesn't speak the language, and is not up to snuff on the most recent of medical technology, may be useful but not acceptable. So now he must find a different venue to ply his skills for money to aid in the Book's search. However, with limited time to learn it while Davron learns the spell, Chi-Yosh must hunt down Ramar, his liaison to London.

"Yes?" Ramar is found among the gardens of Haley's estate. He's pondering the flowers, while poised delicately atop an unmoving post. His eyes seem focused on some place that isn't quite here, though after a moment he returns to reality. "What is it you need, Chi-Yosh?"

"To find work." The Dawn is aware of the situation. He has avoided the unnecessary trappings of money for the longest time, but now he needs it, without an easy means of obtaining it. "You know my skills, and how to speak to the natives. Would you help me?"

"Of course," replies Ramar, after he finishes a rather healthy chuckle. The Eclipse hops down, "So... you're wanting to offer your skills as a healer? Or do you mean as a bodyguard? Or perhaps a survivalist... there are many skills you have, Chi-Yosh. Which are you hoping to use?"

Chi-Yosh says, "I had not considered a bodyguard." It's a last resort, if nothing else. "You're the better woodsman than I, but I was thinking of the healing arts. There are sick and wounded the hospital does not attend to; those away from the city, the people's poor. Maybe... accidents from Scotland Yard training?" He touts the word picked up from the overheard conversation with an angry officer suffering a fractured radius. "You know the culture a little more; have you any ideas?"

"Ahhh... yes, they call it a _clinic_ I think. Although it is... difficult to get the English to accept one who is an outsider. Perhaps we can present you as a form of alternative to the hospital, if they cannot provide what is needed... but what will happen after we leave my friend? Hmm. Perhaps you might share knowledge with a fellow healer while the two of you healed others. You might learn by doing. I should be glad to translate back and forth if you'd like to..." Ramar replies.

"They use medicines I'm not familiar with," admits Chi-Yosh. "Without my hands on herbs, it would take some getting used to foreign plants. But nothing is accomplished in not doing." Patting Ramar on the shoulder, "Let's go see what we can find."

A few hours are spent walking about the streets of London. A private house call doctor of the aristocracy merely shakes his head, and directs the pair towards a shelter ran by a group representing the Church of England. Unfortunately, they only treat the sick, and while short staffed, have little money to spare, and the disease most common among the children and poor is an ailment the Dawn has no experience with. However, their reference turns up a midwife who points to a neighborhood in the lower reaches of the city, comprised entirely of foreigners, giving the tale of a man from the East using balms, elixirs and a bit of chanting that disturbed her. This sounding more like home, the Solars make haste, and travel through the streets in marvel at the designs in windows and on signs. While duller, they bear some resemblance to family crests of the Dragon Blooded.

After wandering for several minutes, Ramar spots a sign proclaiming "Doctor". Weaving around a cart and a trio of playing children, they push inside, exposing a cluttered front room. It smells of candles and must and far away ingredients, open and in baskets lining shelves. Chi-Yosh inspects one of the baskets, finding the leaves of a plant he recognizes - barely. While not the same species, it's likely related.

From the back of the shop, a creaking can be heard, as of wood on wood, followed by a coughing sound. The thump-thump-thump of something hard striking the floor comes next, and out of the gloom from the back an old man, hunched over with age and supporting himself with a cane, approaches the pair. His hair is white, and his face is cracked and lined with the ravages of mortality. Nevertheless his facial features have more in kin with Chi-Yosh's than Ramar's, and his voice is a cracked shadow as he speaks in English. "Welcome, gentlemen."

Chi-Yosh offers a nod of the head to the old man. Bowing is a less common greeting in London, and for the sake of blending in, the Dawn has resisted. If Gallius must wear a dress and act unlike herself, he can make some adjustments.

"We are honored, sir," speaks Ramar. He watches the old man curiously, then indicates Chi-Yosh as he begins to explain their tale. "So you see... my friend here would like to learn more, and perhaps demonstrate what he can, if you need such assistance..."

The old man considers this for a moment. He leans forward, supporting himself on his gnarled cane, and begins speaking in a rapid gibberish at Chi-Yosh, a smile on his face. This fades after a few seconds, as he sees the look of blank incomprehension. "I see," he says, sounding a little disappointed. "Well, come in, come in, and tell me about yourselves.. I'll make some tea."

There's a moment of Ramar speaking gibberish, or at least Riverspeak, with Chi-Yosh as the two of them discuss what is to be told to the old man. Eventually Ramar explains their tale... that they've come from the desert, and found themselves in England, looking for work and ways to help others. He explains Chi-Yosh's knack for the more holistic side of healing... "And you see I was hoping to teach my friend about the herbs here... and maybe he could teach you something in return..."

The elderly man bobs his head slowly. "Wellll now," he mumbles, and reaches up to scratch at his thinly-bearded chin with dirty fingernails. "That will be difficult without language. You are his interpreter?"

Ramar nods, "That I am."

The old man mulls this offer over for a time, as he works to prepare tea for his guests. Finally three cups are set out, and hot tea is poured, and only after one drink from everyone does he speak again. "Very well, I accept."

Chi-Yosh sets to work with the old man, who introduces himself as Xu Lee, as soon as the tea is done. Using Ramar as the middle man, the two set to work first cataloging the various plants, items, a few charms and even rarer things that Lee has on hand. The Su'Katan is not surprised to discover the preserved parts of a few animals, not native to the British Isles. While Gaia has many unique specimens, they still are similar, and it all comes down to identical uses. Coughs, headaches, upset stomachs. When the discussion of herbalism, accupuncture and pressure points turn to Xu's home culture, and the ideas he rarely brings up to the English, mainly Yin Yang and other things, the doctor and his new assistant find an understanding. Xu seems more enthusiastic as the day toils on. The real excitement comes when the three are dispatched to the sick bed of a fevered boy, and like old partners the two set to work. While not as smooth as can be, the pair have done all they can within half an hour, and sit down to pray with t

While not as smooth as can be, the pair have done all they can within half an hour, and sit down to pray with the mother.

The Haung family are on pins and needles while they wait. Ramar and Xu keeps the parents partially distracted with conversation; a respected stableman at a country club, the Mr Haung works his son very hard at the stable as a cleaner and groomer, but with the boy sick, he may lose pay due to a riding show soon. Past midnight, the fever breaks much to all's relief, and the pair set to work rubbing ointment on the boy Fu's chest, letting the vapors keep him from relapsing. Mr Haung assures Xu that if Fu can make it to work within two days, he will deliver compensation. Receiving thanks, the trio leave the Haung house, and Xu shares a bit of rice liqour with the Solars before they retreat. "We will have to find the recipe for this sake before we go home," comments the Dawn on the way home.

When Chi-Yosh and Ramar return to Haley's estate, Davron is standing and walking around his study room, rubbing his eyes. "Had to take a break," he explains. "Once you've read the same paragraph three times, you need to think about something else. And I've got just the thing - the question of how we're going to get home."

Davron says, "Remember the pyramid at which we arrived? I couldn't _read_ the pictograms, but there were some common themes to them. Death and dying - as if the pyramid were a tomb, perhaps. But other symbols suggested to me that its builders also worshipped the sun. And I got to thinking..." Davron goes on. "The Well is currently controlled by the Dowager, but she also told us that in ages past it was in the hands of the Dragon Kings. And they were devoted to the Unconquered Sun as the source of their reason."

Davron rubs his chin. "We're not the first to use the Well to travel here from Creation, and the other visitors have left their mark. Were they stranded here like ourselves? Or did they find a way back?"

Briefly, Chi-Yosh outlines the aspects of Xu's culture that had come up, about Yin Yang, and other elements, hungry ghosts, and so on. "He even mentioned of Kami - local spirits over areas, from an Island nation not far from his birthplace. It's possible that if those who didn't just come over through the well remembered Creation like Ada, and were seen as prophets in old times."

"Perhaps. Although there's no way of knowing, at least not as of yet, why or when we were deposited here. I mean, does the bridge always lead to that place? To that time?" Ramar asks, then nods at Chi-Yosh, "Very interesting..."

Davron nods to Chi-Yosh. "That's true. But the pictographs at the pyramid were more specific. Whoever made them had a much _fresher_ understanding of the realities of death and life in Creation than fragmentary memories from past lives." He turns to Ramar. "We don't _know_, that's true. But I don't think it's a coincidence that the pyramid bears the marks of the cultures in Creation that have held the Well. Now that some among us can read some English," he says, smiling at Ramar, "it might be worthwhile to visit the places of learning in this land, and study the history of this Cairo, and the pyramids. The visitors from Creation may have left other clues."

"Perhaps. It is at the very least worth checking out... I shall visit the _university_ if you like..." Ramar considers for a moment, "But I imagine that you have more to share..."

Davron shakes his head. "Not much. I didn't exactly have a piece of parchment and charcoal to take rubbings of the inscriptions when we arrived," he says, grinning. "And... I wish I could visit this _university_ with you, but for the time being my own studies take precedence."

Ramar nods, "Of course." He bows, "Then, I shall leave you to your studies and return to share with you when I've found something worth mentioning." The Solar pauses for a moment, before turning to leave, "I shall see you shortly. Take care..."

"Before you go.." Davron holds up a hand, then passes over the notes written by the Master, folded open to the section on the sutra Ramar was told. The Sidereal explains that this is the sutra of the College of the Rising Smoke, one of the twenty-five astrological colleges, associated with transitions, endings, and athletics.

The College of the Rising Smoke represents the end of journeys, both literally and metaphorically. It is the college of the young man, the journeyman, the corpse on its way to burial, the pubescent Dynast who has not yet Exalted, and those brought up on charges or entangled in lawsuits.

In its ascending aspect, the paths end in transformation to a new state. In its descending aspect, it is the college of bootless errands and death by accident, heart attack, stroke and murder.

As Ramar is finishing his examination of the Master's notes, Davron adds his own thoughts. "We all arrived here without our clothes, but that's not all. Gallius arrived without her tail, and Jin-nu arrived as a human. I think we weren't simply moved here - we were _transformed_ into bodies appropriate for Gaia. All of us had human souls - Gallius' and Jin-nu's Wyld mutations were just added to that."

"And since the effects of the Wyld were not truly part of who their _true_ selves were, they did not arrive with them," Davron adds.

And so after spending time studying the Master's notes on the Sutra of the Rising Smoke, Ramar heads out. He visits the univeristy, the libraries, and other places of learning, looking through historical texts, as well as more metaphysical ones... anything in which clues from those who have visited Gaia before might be hidden... anything in which ideas from Creation might have seeped in. He's careful to focus on the ideas of reincarnation, transitions from one state to another... and the like. _If they are associated with the Rising Smoke in Creation, perhaps there is a key to our return there, or in such similar things here..._

Interestingly enough, Ramar begins his search in the same place he began his journey in Gaia... Egypt. He's especially curious as to the pyramids... _Perhaps they may hold some higher meaning..._

The pyramids of Egypt were burial places - tombs for the Pharaohs, or rulers of Egypt. They were built to exacting specifications, often constructed with a specific Pharaoh in mind, and used extensive slave labor. Often they were trapped or otherwise arranged to foil intruders, and Ramar is reminded strongly of the rules of Manse construction as he reads about the evolution of the pyramid.

In general, the tomb of a Pharaoh was meant to ensure that Pharaoh's successful entry into the afterlife. Several steps had to be taken, including mummification of the body, and great importance was put on the _manner_ in which the spirit entered the afterlife.

The Egyptians worshipped a number of gods, including the Sun-god Ra (and/or Aton), and Osiris, judge of the dead and also associated with the sun in many myths.

The Circle gathers later that day, and Ramar recounts his findings. It is generally agreed that the matter of the pyramids has turned out to be a promising line of inquiry after all. As they return to their duties the next day - Davron and Ramar to their studies, Gallius and Chi-Yosh to their employment - there is a growing optimism that, at last, they are on the right track. But they still have a long way to travel yet before they can reach either Korash or Creation.
