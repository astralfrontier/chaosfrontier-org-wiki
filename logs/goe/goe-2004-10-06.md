# Gods of Eden 2004-10-06

It takes money to get anywhere in Gaia, which isn't so different from Creation. Gallius doesn't know the right people herself, but Haley certainly does. A party of sorts is suggested, targetting those most likely to find occult knowledge profitable or at least interesting. Gallius imagines that even the opportunity to see a little 'magic' worked in a small group might be enough to arrange for a voyage. Fortunately she has the essential skills to do this without risking a great deal.

In the way of 20th century occultism, there is first a rather standard party, with talking, eating, and dancing. It is only after the night wears on that things grow more tense. Lights are put out and everyone is gathered about a table in a shadowy room. Conversation falls to a whisper, and then Gallius begins to chant softly, and with her words figures come to be in the air, and she tells them of Creation, of the world that is outside of Gaia. Pictures of deserts, plains, and to the people of Gaia, fantastic and terrible places where anything is possible. Nightmares walk there, in the Wyld and in the Shadowlands, with creatures of death and madness. These are the enemies that Gallius reveals, and it is against such forces that she requires help. Not in strength of arms, but in assistance to find something. A weapon that in Creation will tip the scales of this massive war.

In this world, the so-called "Great War" happened within the lifetimes of many of those assembled here. The specter of conflict is not a stranger, and further, many believe that a phenomenon called the 'astral world' mirrors the real world. When the forces on the astral plane come into conflict, that conflict is mirrored in reality. With this in mind, and with the undeniable evidence their own senses deliver, it is not hard to convince any of the men and women here that whatever conflict they witnessed will have a profound influence on them.

Gallius goes further than that, however. She warns that should her people fail Gaia may also be threatened. The terrors that would rend the fabric of Creation may carry much of their potency into this world. She feels for a moment the weight upon the shoulders of the Solars. Now a whole other world is also to be protected by them. A world that doesn't even know of its danger. She is hardly uncertain, however. She simply says, "With your help, we will not fail."

Gallius has a few provisions she needs. She isn't a gunner, not an archer, nothing of that sort. She's a melee specialist, and so one of the strange things she requires is a worthy sword. In the pursuit of this, she goes with one of the men whom she revealed her powers to and together they seek a fine blade. This draws some attention, naturally enough. Especially when Gallius demonstrates her abilities with the blade.

From there, Gallius, in a respectable and well-to-do dress, walks out over the air field with the director of Queen's Skies. They stand before a grand plane, painted red, whit eand blue of the English flag and her crown. Having just been washed and buffed like the brand new boots of a lord, the plane shines in the surrounding mid-day glow. "I've never known someone to charter a flight but not know the destination," observes the director, who is more concerned with just where those heavy pounds are going to, as soon as the woman at his side relieves herself of the money. "Adventure knows no definition, Mr Chance, and we seek to find ourselves a grand one."

There are a few things that Ramar needs to pick up in preparation for the trip. Namely, weapons. While he is neither gunner nor melee-ist, the others in the group are. So to that end, he has gone in search of an arsenal of sorts. As far as the clerk in the shop knows, Ramar is to be going hunting later this week. There's a bit of a back and forth about the pros and cons of the various guns, and Ramar learns much more than he might have cared to by the time the purchase is finalized. He returns with a few choice bits of weaponry. Two rifles, with enough emmunition to go for a nice long hunt. In addition there's a host of side-arms. Enough to equip everyone with the deadly weaponry, should they desire them. "Well... these are the ones they recommended at the shop... I think they said something about having the stopping power of a lorry."

Gallius works her magic on the pilot, whom she refers to as the 'nice boy from Devenshire.' The Lady has apparently taken to the customs here well enough, taking the arm of the pilot and asking him all sorts of questions about his aircraft. She doesn't understand much of it, but is impressed by it anyway. As for her journey, she says simply, "As a Lady of standing I will require some discretion on this vacation of mine. It wouldn't do to upset my relatives with wild stories, now would it? I'm sure you understand, and to make up for any problems that might arise, I am prepared to offer you any necessary compensation." And here she seems not to be learning from England, but from Rumika, judging by the way Gallius presses herself against the man's arm, turning to look into his eyes with a shy smile. "Oh please tell me you understand!"

In short order the nice boy from Devenshire is nodding his head so much it's a wonder it doesn't roll off. Or his eyes fall out! With things all neatly handled, the passengers board the plane and prepare to journey from the jolly island of England to destination unknown. Wherever they go, it's likely to rain a lot less! Gallius settles into her seat, allows the pilot to fasten her belt (which he does quite gladly for her and Jin-nu) and then she goes through the odd sensation of being lifted in the air by an aircraft.

"All right folks... this is it," Davron says. For a moment, the roar of the DC3's engines is the only sound... soon joined by the sorcerer's sonorous chanting. The blue-purple light of his anima flickers around him, weakly at first, then with increasing strength, as he slowly, carefully recites the syllables he had so painstakingly memorized, his hands passing through the air trailing tendrils of blue fire. Soon, to the astonishment of the pilot (which Gallius quickly moves to assuage), the cabin is filled with the light of sunset, as Davron spins Essence into the fabric of a reality unused to such things.

The hours, the days of careful study, and Davron's intense concentration, pay off. The blue fire wraps itself into a ball, as Davron's Essence weaves itself into the shape of a fiery bird, whose wings flutter expectantly. His anima still swirling around him for the moment, Davron draws forth the vial of Ice's blood, beckoning the spirit-bird close.

"Find for me a man," intones Davron, "a man who once bore the blood of the Dragons, which he passed on to his son - and you will find him by this, the Dragon's-blood of that son." With that he opens the vial, allowing the Servant to capture Ice's fleeting Essence before Gaia can draw it away.

Davron studies the fluttering of the bird, and speaks a few words in Riverspeak to Gallius, who asks the nice young boy from Devenshire what destination lies to the east-southeast (after reassuring him that the thing isn't going to set fire to his airplane). "Calais, ma'am," he says with a nervous grin. "That's where we're headed?" Gallius glances at Davron, who shrugs, and she smiles sunnily back at the young pilot. "At first," she says, winking. "But I expect we'll be going a lot further."

On the way to Calais, Davron realizes that simply playing follow-the-bird may not be the most effective course of action. He explains his intentions to Gallius, and upon landing, he takes very careful note of the direction the bird is pointing, using the airplane's compass to gain the precision he needs.

With the aid of the pilot's charts, he picks a new destination - Brest, quite some distance to the southwest. After another, rather longer air journey, he notes the bird's direction again, hoping that the difference in bearing will be enough for him to get a reasonably precise triangulation of the bird's target.

The 'Gooney Bird' stays in the air for close to five hours, during which time Davron puts the resources of his considerable intellect to the task of identifying the direction the spell indicates. What he discovers is a line leading through the heart of Europe, to the northern end of Italy and past into Asia. Unfortunately, he isn't sure how far the trail actually leads. Of small comfort is the idea that on a spherical world, it can't be too far away or the spell would simply point in the other direction.

Continuing along the trajectory, the nice young man from Devenshire informs that the plane needs another load of fuel. Despite their technology, these planes just can't compare to Creation's First Age airships. The course is steered to Paris, while Davron takes careful note of the bird's movements, making notations when necessary. The pilot suggests a few hours of stretching the legs in the city of love for his passengers, which the Circle readily accepts.
