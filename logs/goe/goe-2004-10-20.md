Ian, the pilot of the Circle's peculiar new air-ship, follows a strict charter policy: do what the customer asks. He and his co-pilot have stayed quiet, not wanting to embroil themselves further in whatever strange goings-on have possessed their passengers. Hence little is said by either man when the order comes: time to fly again. With another several hours of flight made possible by the intoxicating, faintly foul-smelling liquid that fuels the thirsty bird they fly in, the DC-3 lifts off and begins flying through the heart of the European land-mass.

Gallius will spend her time reading. After a few heart-to-hearts with Haley, she suddenly gained a reading list of classics that range from Marx to Socrates. The current tome she's wrestling through is 'The Republic'. Political philosophy in this world is fascinating to her, and few things can distract her from reading for even a moment.

Chi-Yosh stares out the window, the bird's eye view showing the landscape melting away. On the air ships, one has to climb into the chilly rigging or cling to the railing to enjoy this sight. But with that glass seperating, the view is comfortable. Undisturbed. As the minutes tick by, the Dawn thinks about the Order Gallius has dedicated to him. What, how will he engineer it? After a time, he turns to Davron, asking about the usefulness of Mortals against the monsters of Creation. The hungry ghosts, the Fae, and other dangerous foes.

Travel by air is not new to Davron - but he is missing the familiar thrum of Essence through the engine, and the loud but mundane roar of these very different engines does not comfort him. To distract himself, he gazes at the fluttering blue flame before him - sorcery is, strangely, a comforting reminder of home. ...And even more strangely, so is Chi-Yosh's question, even if it involves such a disquieting subject.

"There are ways other than sheer physical force available to them," says Davron, sticking to Riverspeak so as not to disturb the Gaian pilots with matters they should never have to face. "Even a mortal thaumaturge can draw an unbroken line of salt to stop a hungry ghost, and cold iron will wound the fae whether or not the hands that hold it are Exalted. But..." He shrugs. "The monsters of the world still wield terrible powers that mortals have no defense against, unless we the Chosen can grant it to them."

About midway through the flight, Gallius decides to bother the pilots. She goes over some of the odd things she's heard lately, asking them about Germany in particular, why the old treaties from the Great War aren't being kept strong, and about any opinions they have on the Spanish Civil War. She knows a great deal about current events. They are just all so interesting. War always catches her ear. It always has a painful lesson to teach.

For his part, Ramar is enjoying the chance to be a passenger within an airship... for so often he is at the helm. Although there's something about being separated from the world by a few panes of glass that is almost unsettling. He chuckles quietly, watching his companions query one another, or their pilots... leaving him to quiet thoughts. His gaze is ever on the sky, watching the shifting clouds roll by, even in this lifeless place, such a sight captures his imagination.

Chi-Yosh finishes off the thought, though glancing to check anything further from Davron. "Then, those not Chosen will comprise the intelligence, hunting down and observing the creatures, evacuating the area of people, and containing the area as best as they can with their thaumaturgical toolkit. The Chosen must be those to dispense force upon anything greater than a rampaging elemental, with the archery assistance of men with iron arrows, in the smaller of Fae skirmishes."

Davron nods. "And other considerations. Fair Folk can warp the minds of mortals, for example, and we will need to grant them some protection against that, lest they be routed, or worse, turned against their fellows." Davron tilts his head. "We cannot always prepare for _every_ eventuality, of course. But when we know the foe in advance, and can prepare..."

The bird of flame that guides Davron has been agitated, wavering sometimes as it struggles between its sorcerous bindings and the inexorable pull of Destiny. The plane makes another refueling stop at Osio Sotto, near Bergamo and Milan, and continues along the "boot" of Italy. As the plane passes by Roman airspace, Davron notices something - the bird veers downward and to the side. It seems that the Circle's quarry is to be found in Rome, "the Eternal City".

---

It is near to twilight by the time the plane settles down on the runway at Ciampino. There is no charter office here, and so the pilots will stay at a hotel. Ian hints at an expense-account for himself and his co-pilot in trade for their sufferance of extraordinary circumstances, allowing that they will not go too far in their enjoyment of the city of Rome.

It's not too difficult to arrange for a carriage. Ramar's used to very curious accents wrapping themselves around the English language. This one takes a little more getting used to, but in time, the Circle will find themselves with a carriage and driver willing to take them up to the city. "After that, we'll have to find another way... perhaps something like an automobile, one covered might do the trick? We will need to learn about the city beforehand though."

Davron nods to Ramar. "Either you or Gallius will need to go into town and get the most accurate map you can find. I plan to circle around the city sometime after midnight tonight, to try to narrow down his position when he's asleep - the map will help us get to the right neighborhood as fast as possible."

"We will go in late at night as well," says Davron, "with Chi-Yosh scouting ahead. The only people abroad at that hour, I'm hoping, will be drunkards whose stories of birds of blue flame will be counted as reliable as their stories of pink elephants. Though the watch will be abroad at that hour too, and them we must avoid at all costs, until I can dismiss the Servant."

"It has its risks," says Gallius. "And the ruler of Italy is hardly a weakling, if I've heard correctly. We must be very cautious about drawing attention to ourselves." She frowns and adds, "I think at first we should pretend to be tourists. Many people visit this city, it seems."

Davron grins. "You can pretend to be tourists. I'll be hiding away during the day. Though perhaps I should start hiking around the city? Korash probably moves around during the day, but at least I might have some suitable guesses for where to go when night falls."

Gallius' first order of business is to enter the city and act like a tourist. Which is to say, like a worldly idiot. This is achieved by studying anything that looks historic in nature and finding a guide that can tell her something about it that sounds somewhat plausible who speaks good English. Or at least passable English. In Rome, this probably won't take long. She tells her helpful guide and translator how she would like a map on which she can document this pilgrimage, as well. Preferably one that captures the details as well as can be managed, of course. She managed to learn enough about Rome from the pilots to fake the religious interest required to sell her story.

Girding himself up with survival gear from the airplane, Davron sets off on his hike around the city, taking care at all times to stay at least half a mile away from any populated areas to avoid the patrols that guard the city from... well, from suspicious individuals like himself. He looks for all the world like a backpacker enjoying a hike, except for the bird following him - and for that reason he avoids any existing trails, for fear of finding another hiker. Though the flora and fauna are subtly different, Davron finds himself quite at home in these woods, and the instincts he developed in his childhood serve him well in making sure he can find his way back.

At regular intervals, Davron pauses, carefully observing the Servant's direction, then noting the bearing and the time of day in a notebook. Finally, around midday, he reverses course, hoping to return to his starting point at nightfall to meet his companions and compare notes.

After a great deal of study, the Circle agrees: the course of their target has been highly erratic. One thing is clear, though - all the lines of intersection they have traced fall along major museums, libraries or other sources of history and culture.

Chi-Yosh's own casual inspection of the defenses of Rome suggest the presence of peacekeepers rather than military men. They will go where a disturbance is made; while there are regular patrols, they can be defeated with good timing and careful use of the innate powers of the Chosen. The rooftops in particular are considered difficult to navigate, but this is by mortal standards. Entering at night and using the city's buildings as stepping-stones will suffice to avoid detection. Barring a bout of ill fortune, of course, but that is universally true.

As the moon continues to drop a few hours after its peak, the Circle moves in at the edge of the city with the highest buildings. Like spiders, Ramar and Chi-Yosh scurry up a wall and perch on the edge of a roof, dropping down a rope to assist the rest of their Circle. Davron, noting the place of the bird, send the group moving swift and as quiet as they can be over the narrow, angular roofs after keeping eyes peeled for potential detection.

Davron's own aerial maneuvering lacks the graceful technique of either Chi-Yosh or Ramar, but he makes up for it with innate skill and strength, as he clears the gap from one rooftop to another with carefully judged leaps, or climbs up the side of a facade, the calluses formed from long archery practice protecting his hands from the jagged edges of stone and brick. Every so often he pauses, glancing at the Servant to determine which way to go next, and gesturing instructions to his companions as the Circle sets off in a new direction.

A brick building, showing the rainbow of architectural history that characterizes all of Rome, lies amidst a sea of similar constructions. The Tiber River in the distance glitters with the pale light of the dead moon, bereft of Luna's cunning presence and otherworldly glow. The Many-Faced Goddess will not give shelter to the night-stalker who seeks to travel here, but nor will any barking dogs sing their songs of ancient friendship with man as they seek to warn human masters of approaching danger. A few barks can be heard as the Solars assemble on the rooftop of the building, but the sounds are ignored entirely. Sometimes it is better that people are deaf and blind to the magic around them.

A trap-door in the roof, used for maintenance, allows access to the uppermost hallway. The Solars find themselves in a sort of dormitory or apartment complex. It lies on the outskirts of one of Rome's universities; perhaps it houses students, visitors, and even employees of the university. Gallius is reminded of the Cloister of Wisdom, on the Blessed Isle, and the spartan purity of its furnishings. The Solars arrive at a door, through which the Servant-bird very definitely seeks to go.

"Alright then," says Ramar, somewhat quietly. "There's just one. Like as not a man. So then," He takes a breath, _I hope this is the right thing to do_ and knocks on the door. Loud enough to be heard.

Davron looks alarmed as Ramar knocks, glancing at the fiery bird, then subsides. "Well, he'll have to know sooner or later, I suppose. Just don't wake anyone else up, okay?" he hisses. After several seconds, he smiles faintly. "Looks like you didn't wake him either. You sure you want to disturb him now?"

Ramar considers, "Well... perhaps. Although we might do better to sneak in and infuse his dreams with Essence. Admittedly I'm not too sure on how we'd do this, but we must do... something. While we have the time, and while the night is on our side."

A sleepy voice from down the hall can be heard yelling, "Mantenga il rumore giu!" In the room, Ramar can finally hear a stirring sound, the sound of a lock being opened. The door opens, revealing the bleary-eyed countenance of a man in his late forties, or perhaps older. His brown beard is spotted with gray, as is his hair. He reaches up with a wrinkled knuckle to rub at one eye. "Chi sono voi la gente? Che cosa desiderate a questo periodo della notte?"

"I'm afraid I don't speak your language. Do you understand English?" Ramar asks, doing his best to look nonplussed by the glowing bird flitting near Davron. "If so, then we must speak..."

"Yes, yes, I do," the man assents, though tiredly. "What is your business with me?" He still seems asleep enough not to notice Davron's 'companion'; it's likely that he is accustomed to such interruptions to the point that his conscious mind need not be fully engaged.

Gallius takes this as her time to do some work. "I'm terribly sorry to disturb you sir, but we believe we may be able to offer some information that is very valuable to you. It will not require a great deal of time, and it may give you new insight into everything in this world. We have come from a very long way to find you." She speaks confidently as ever, using subtle gestures and her posture to make it clear that she believes what she is saying. "If we waste your time, we can find ways to compensate you, but I think we will both learn a great deal."

"Oh?" The man regains a measure of awareness, and starts as he becomes aware of the supernatural bird-thing hovering close to Davron. "Wha-wha-what is that?" he asks in a shaken voice, extending a trembling finger to point at the offending fragment of sorcery.

"Magic. Of a sort. Not the hoaxes that men on the street demonstrate, but true magic. Reality, if you will. This helped us to find you. It led us to you and is capable of doing little more than that. You need not fear it. It is... difficult to explain, but you were once capable of feats such as this. We have traveled a long way, from another realm in fact, to learn from you, though it seems we must help you remember that which you have forgotten," informs Ramar. "May we?"

The man, stunned, steps aside from the door to welcome his visitors into the little room of the dormitory. There is a bed and a small desk, used apparently for writing, and there are boxes full of books and paperwork that have been left open and pushed against the outer wall.

"I am.. Dr. GianCarlo Altieri, a scholar," the Italian explains, still shaky and uncertain given his brush with the supernatural. "You are uh, welcome here.." His words betray a doubt, but nevertheless he seems civil enough.

As he steps into the room, Davron says in Riverspeak, "Do you think our friend will be more comfortable if I send it away? He looks nervous. We've proven what we are - no need to discomfit him further."

Chi-Yosh replies to Davron, while taking a comfortable spot against a wall, "He is uncomfortable with surprise, but perhaps when he adjusts, he would like to marvel at it?"

Gallius says in English, "I think the Doctor may be much more at ease if you ask him yourself, Davron." She enters the room with a smile and looks around. "I suppose we should answer whatever questions he might ask."

Having regained a degree of composure, Dr. Altieri lights an oil lamp on his desk and gestures. "Now, ah.. I don't have much in the way of hospitality for you.. but what is it you have come for?"

Ramar bows humbly. "We do not mean to harm you. This is no doubt an unnerving experience, to put it mildly... but it is a new thing to learn, a new thing to study... or perhaps an old one." Ramar nods, allowing Essence to escape into the room, hoping that it too will change as the barn once did. "We have come to help you reclaim this knowledge, and to learn from you. To help you realize what other truths lay hidden behind this... world."

Despite the startled cry of the scholar, or perhaps in conjunction with it, the room begins to change. The small room is alive, the walls almost sing the secrets of wood and stone, the boxes and books recite their silent oath to present knowledge when asked... and the very air changes. Ramar speaks, "Please, do not be too afraid..."

"Who ARE you people?" demands Dr. Altieri, now startled sufficiently out of his half-awake politeness. "What is it you want?"

Gallius decides to answer that one herself. "We're visitors from a place you once lived," she explains. "To say more would only confuse things. We are going to try and help you remember that other place. It will not harm you, but will give you a wider perspective of the world."

The Italian shakes his head. "What are you talking about?" he asks, warily.

"Some would refer to it as a past life," says Gallius. "If we are wrong, nothing happens and we'll make up for wasting your time. If we are right, you will learn a great deal. We need your help, though. Only the memories of your past life can lead us to a book we desperately require."

Dr. Altieri blinks a few times. "I'm a linguist, not a librarian," he says firmly. "But..perhaps in the morning? Come to meet me here. I will perhaps have more time to think about this."

---

Morning in Rome is made considerably easier with the dismissal of the Servant of Infallible Location; its task has been performed. Dr. Altieri, true to his word, is waiting for his guests at his dormitory room. He is conservatively attired in the English fashion, and wears spectacles. He shows all the marks of a man of breeding and sophistication. After a few minutes of negotiation, he shows his guests to an open-air bistro in the city, and indeed confirms knowledge of Ada Kensington. As a student of languages, such a story couldn't wholly escape his attention, and he shows a keen interest in hearing actual spoken examples of it.

The Circle enjoys a brief breakfast at the bistro, before returning to the scholar's room. "Now, take a deep breath, then release. Again." Ramar's voice is soft and rhythmic. "Listen to the sound of my voice, and feel your mind travelling. Listen to the whispers of a far off wind..." Slowly, Ramar helps the anxious scholar back into a state of waking dreams. He walks him through Creation, helping him to recall his life within that glorious realm.

As the Solar guides the scholar back beyond the boundaries of life and death, Essence is exchanged. It is this which helps GianCarlo to understand his memories, to make sense of the jumble of conflicting sensations and spirits and beings that make up Creation. "Now then... recall who you were, Korash the White Wizard."

At the end of the rite, Dr. Altieri sits back, rubbing his head somewhat as though relieving a pain or pressure. "... Hah! I see now," he says, mumbling to himself in the fashion of all brilliant men who perceive truth. ".. Yes.. yes... But he was wrong. How wrong he was! Korash, you fool..." He looks up, glancing from face to face. "I remember..... I remember bits and pieces now. It must take time."

The investors at Gallius' meeting could hardly wait to share with their most trusted colleagues the news of the encounter. And of course, their trusted colleagues could not pass up the opportunity to gloat to their peers in turn. And so in Berlin, a man reclines on a divan, sipping coffee from an ornate mug as he examines, then crumples, a telegram in one hand. "Klaus," he calls to his manservant. "Assemble the Ahnenerbe. We have found something very interesting. I have some phone calls to make."
