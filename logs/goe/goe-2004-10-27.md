# Gods of Eden 2004-10-27

Davron breathes a sigh of relief as Ramar nods. He'd been worried. Even though the bird guided the way, and surely he would've known back in England if... but here and now, they have found the man they sought. Once Korash's first words have been translated, he asks a question in return, his curiosity piqued: "Out of curiosity, who was wrong? And about what?"

Dr. Altieri gives no hint of comprehension when Davron speaks in his native tongue, but the linguist's halting reply comes courtesy of Gallius' quickly-acquired English acumen. "I... I knew for a moment. It's still faint. But.. I think he came here, to find Bagrash Kol, the way you tried to find me. Only he thought his next incarnation would remember, and it didn't. Or rather, I didn't, until now."

Altieri explains further. "I think he used sorcery, in an attempt to make himself remember past his former life. When Korash died, he hoped his next incarnation would remember, because of the sorcery."

Chi-Yosh is pleased that the first step towards their goal has been found. But, first, to check their facts. He nods to Gallius, who translates him. "In Creation, we found a book of notes that we think are yours, and the notes had pages from the Book of Three Circles. Did you write those notes, and were those pages from the Book?"

"I'm afraid I don't remember," says the doctor, apologetically. "But give me time. I may remember more. It's like a dream I'm slowly re-experiencing."

Davron nods. "Of course," he says. "Now, if I may ask a question of Dr. Altieri, rather than of Korash... what is it that you study, here in Gaia?" It may not even be relevant to the Solar Circle's quest, but yesterday's itinerary of places of learning is intriguing to Davron in its own right.

"I'm a linguist," he replies via translation. "A student of languages, and the cultures behind them. Ancient and modern... I've even done translations for the Vatican." Even Davron can discern the note of pride in this name, despite the feeling's expression in a foreign tongue. "I teach Greek and Latin part-time."

"Doctor, I have heard many things about the leader of Italy. Do you think it is safe for us to remain here?" Gallius hasn't heard many good things about Mussolini, that's for sure.

Altieri chuckles a bit. "Mussolini is like every Italian leader," he proclaims confidently. "He is a powerful man with three dozen powerful rivals. He fears the Church, and the Church fears him. So it has always been."

"Perhaps," says Gallius. But, she notes, "That doesn't precisely answer my question, since both church and Italian leader may not appreciate the ramifications of our presence here."

Again the doctor shakes his head. "For as long as you have nothing they want, you will be left alone."

Davron rubs his chin contemplatively, as Gallius discusses politics with the good Doctor. "Ancient languages and cultures..." he muses to himself. Finally, aloud, he poses a question to Altieri via Gallius. "Do you know much of the culture of ancient Egypt? It is there that we arrived in Gaia, inside one of the pyramids, and some of what we saw suggested to us that this was no accident."

It takes another exchange for GianCarlo to understand what 'Gaia' is, but finally he explains what he knows about Egyptian culture. It is an ancient civilization, one of the oldest continuing cultures in the world, and home to a number of beliefs about death, magic and the afterlife. It doesn't surprise him at all that the Solar Circle would emerge in such a place, although he can't shed any specific light on why.

"So..." Asks Ramar, "Do you remember how Korash planned on returning to Creation after he'd tracked down Bagrash Kol?"

The doctor shrugs. "I have no idea. Presumably he would enact the same sorcery here, to carry his knowledge back again. If it didn't work in coming, though, it certainly wouldn't going back."

"Well alright then." Ramar chuckles, "At least we know we're not the only ones who've come here ill-prepared..." He shrugs, "I'm afraid I'm not really certain what to do now, aside from give you more time to recall your memories. Is there anything we can do to help?"

Altieri nods, and considers for awhile. "Well.... You could help me with my researches, yes?" he says at last.

Ramar says, "I suppose we might be able to. Yes. Unless you'd rather not," Ramar turns and asks this of the Circle. "I don't mind helping though, where I can do so."

Chi-Yosh spreads his hands. "If nothing exciting happens, there is little else for us to do idling for the echos of the past to return."

Davron nods. "I will help if I can - however little that may be, given that I know little English and Italian, let alone whatever else he may study. And though he might have an academic interest in Riverspeak, I doubt it'll be of use to him here." He grins. "Unless, of course, he wishes to present it as an invented language in a work of fiction."

The Abyssal knelt before the throne of his master, the Dowager of the Irreverent Vulgate in Unrent Veils. The mighty Deathlord stretched out her hand, watching the serpents that answered for fingers wriggle aimlessly, and smiled in her haughty fashion. "You, my most faithful servant, have been chosen for this mission," she said. The Abyssal merely stayed silent. His one eye was downcast; where the other orb had once rested now sparkled a black jewel of disturbing beauty. "You shall be my emissary to the other worlds. Now, go. The Well awaits."

The Abyssal rose, his pale beauty marred only by the bejeweled socket. He turned and walked, to begin his last rite of corruption before he went to serve his mistress' will. He walked outside, over the ancient battlements of cyclopean stone, and as he strode through the moonbeams of midnight piercing the clouds overhead, his face became a charred skull. Once out of the moon's revealing light, his attractive, bloodless face would return to its former seeming. Every step was a dance of abandonment, a revelry in the powers of darkness that suffused his soul, a giving up of things once cherished. He was abandoning his place among the Dowager's servants, giving up his existence in Creation, all for the sake of the Dowager's wish. And should it come to pass that he could return, well, he would continue to serve her. But privately it was Oblivion that he expected to find.

At last he returned, feeling his dark spirit rekindled from the act of throwing away his attachments to Creation and all its truths. The reassuring black void of the Well stood before him, and those of his comrades who were present in the fortress had come to bid him farewell. None spoke. Rather, each filed past him on their way out of the room, and each laid a hand on his shoulder in mute encouragement. Even with his soul purified of the taint of existence, he could still feel the fires of kinship burn with every touch of their hand. As the last of his fellows departed, a wave of revulsion swept through him as the camaraderie of his fellow Deathknights warred with his hope of transcendent Oblivion beyond the Well. Before either side could fully dominate, he stepped forward, and entered it, and vanished.

"... And so Mithras, or Mithra, was a sort of demigod." Altieri is explaining his latest work in the library, his voice hushed as he speaks to the Solars in tones quiet enough not to disturb the other patrons. "A crow carried the message to Mithra that he must find and slay this sacred bull. And in doing so, the sacrifice would bring about prosperity and blessings to the earth, while the spirit of the bull ascended to Heaven to claim a reward. So the dual nature of the sacrifice led to..."

Studying with Altieri is an interesting exercise. The scholar is learned in cultures ancient and modern, and even otherworldly; he has picked up a few phrases of Riverspeak, although his accent is atrocious. He seems particularly interested in pumping his new assistants for knowledge of their culture and mythology, and he is increasingly convinced that Creation has had far more of a hand in shaping Earth's beliefs than it might seem.

Ramar is intrigued that someone could be so fascinated by a culture so different... yet there's something oddly comforting about this. _After all, if these people originally came from Creation, then perhaps it's simply their old memories, swirling about within the depths of their minds, as we dream of those who have departed. Hmm. Then perhaps in Egypt, the builders of the Pyramids arrived in Gaia without dying. Maybe it was the work of the Unconquered Sun and Gaia, to strive to build a place where these souls might rest, but in order to do so, well, some sort of civilization needed to exist. Or perhaps their memories simply had not yet faded. Who knows._ He manages to throw many similar sentiments in a rather eloquent, "Huh."

It is late evening of the sixth day after arriving in Rome. Dr. Altieri has remembered more of Korash's existence; he has some vague recollection of the research his former incarnation performed, but nothing quite like what the Solars need yet. The Circle, along with Jin-nu, stand outside the doctor's dorm room to bid him good night. However, something seems amiss.

From both ends of the hallway, men in dark suits appear from around the corner. There are four on each end; their hair is dark and slicked back, and their eyes are dark and cold. They stalk forward menacingly, hands emerging from pockets and flexing.

As Dr. Altieri reveals surprise and confusion at the intimidating eight, Ramar challenges them for identification. In response they draw sleek, nameless pistols from their jackets and aim them at the Circle. "Come with us," commands one, gruffly, speaking accented English.

Gallius steps forward as the men draw their weapons. "You would bar me? You will take me prisoner?" she calls out, her voice rising in wrath, and about her the glory of Helios bursts into being, banishing the darkness. "Fly for your lives, or I will tear out your hearts with my bare hands! The wrath of the gods is upon you!"

Two of the men actively turn tail and run, dropping their pistols behind in fright. Almost all of the rest are paralyzed with fear; only two men, to the left of Dr. Altieri's door, have the presence of mind to try and open fire.

Ramar steps forwards rather rapidly. With a sweep of the cane against the floor, he vaults off of the edge of the wall, and launches himself at the two men stepping forward. With a sudden rush of air, he strikes the hand of one of the men, then twirls the stick behind him, only to strike out at the other man's weapon, fast as lightning. "Back off."

The men seem to have combat training; perhaps they are, or were, soldiers. Nevertheless, the need to avoid the sudden strike has ruined their aim, and stray shots tear furrows into the ceiling. Both raise their free arms to their eyes to shield their eyes from the supernatural glow.

Immediately Chi-Yosh thinks of going into a side room, using a bottle neck, but, when Gallius erupts in power, the opportunity is at hand to be siezed. He charges down the hall, and leaps up, kicking off the wall, limbs tight to build a spinning momentum that ends with a knee into the face if one stunned gunman. Up snapsh the Dawn's hands to grab hold of an overhead pipe. While weak from position and lack of momentum, an outward kick to two of the gunmen is still strong enough to offer pain, before the move ends with a scissoring snap of the Su'Katan's legs around the fourth, in an attempt to drag him down.

While still awe struck by Gallius' display, the four gunmen are not stunned into inaction. The incoming knee is successfully blocked by an upraised gun. Another makes the smart decision of ducking under a kick - a move his comrad didn't think of, earning him a cracked jaw. The final man is moving back before Chi-Yosh's legs can get a good hold, and gives his assailant a hard shove away from him, putting Chi-Yosh on the floor, with only one downed man to show for it.

Whoever these men are, if gunplay they want, gunplay they'll get. As his companions spring into action, and the corridor fills with the blazing light of Creation's sun, Davron leaps forward and sideways as his hand dives into his vest, the light glinting off the barrel of his own sidearm. Two loud reports echoes in the narrow corridor, as the lead slugs go flying, aiming to make short work of the men as they try to deal with the deadly Su'katan in their midst.

Red blood blossoms on the dark suits, the men collapsing to the floor as Davron's shots find their mark. The archer/gunman himself rolls forward with the momentum of his leap, then springs up on one knee, gun held out in front of him as he turns around to deal with the foes still standing behind him.

The battle-rage is on Davron now, and he hesitates for nary a moment before squeezing the trigger twice more, unleashing the terrible deadliness of his Gaian firearm against the suited men across the hall. When he has time to think, he may regret his bloodlust - but for now, the primal part of him expresses the understanding that his higher soul is loath to admit: in battle, kill or be killed.

Once again, Davron proves brutally effective, the men jerking backward and then collapsing as the slugs slam into them. The gun seems to have a life of its own as the barrel tilts toward the remaining man - if he's lucky, Davron's companions will grant him a more merciful end before the trigger can be pulled once more.

Chi-Yosh crouches, surveying the results of Davron's efficient aim, while the man he downed is clutching his jaw and rolling around on the floor. Picking up one of the discarded pistols, the Dawn rises and rushes to the center of the room, where the Doctor and Jin-nu have ducked down to the floor. There's no need to fire through the cluster of the Circle at the lone man, it's well taken care of. "We should probably go, now. Someone likely heard shots, and are going for authorities."

After spending a moment or two assessing the situation outside, Ramar reports back, "The two scared by the er... display are headed for a car. Unless I am mistaken."

Seeing the last man break and run, Gallius' raises her voice, cutting the air with it more harshly than even the bullets. "Stop if you wish to live! I have a purpose for you. Stop and listen! If you move a hair's breadth before I am done you will die." She holds her gun at the ready. She is ready to kill. But not when her enemy might still prove a useful tool. Above her the white lion roars, the deadly glittering of its eyes bouncing off every window as it glares pitilessly at the last foe left standing.

Seeing the man skid to a halt, Gallius continues speaking, "You will draw away attention from this place. You will fire your weapon to make noise and scream and shout and lead the police away. Go now! Lead them to the southeast!"

Frightened already by the supernatural display, and unable to bring even a shred of willpower to bear against the show of half-remembered Solar authority, the man complies immediately.

Outside, the sound of a car engine roaring can be heard, and a squeal of tires follows.

Gallius leaves little time for thought or consideration. It is obvious that this city is unsafe. Which she had argued earlier. Now her gut instincts look more accurate than even she had imagined. Foot is too slow, and so a car is borrowed, allowing the circle to rush swiftly away from the scene of their recent battle and towards the one place that can get them out of here: the airport.

En route, Dr. Altieri regains his voice. Exposure to Essence, and even fragments of memory, may have been one thing. Now he has seen the might of the Solar Exalted for himself. "I remember more now," he manages. "I think.. I think I can help you."

At the airport, the Circle's 'borrowed' vehicle stops short. A police cordon around their DC-3 has been established. At least twenty-five men with automatic weapons are on patrol; there is no sign of their pilot, Ian, or the copilot. Without a full-scale frontal assault, it seems that there is no way to board the plane.
