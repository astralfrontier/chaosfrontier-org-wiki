# Gods of Eden 2004-11-10

The sand is hot underneath the Solars' feet; the unthinking sun above does nothing more or less than shine harshly on the travelers. Jin-nu labors to keep up with her Exalted companions. After five thousand years of silent slumber, Ra is unsteady on his feet even with the life-giving transfusion of Essence. As the group walks the unforgiving desert, Ra explains to them what they must do once they cross into Cecelyne.

"She will ask for the life's memories of one traveler," the ancient ex-Abyssal warns. "This is why I could not go alone - once she took that, I would not know the final path needed to escape." And this final path he teaches. It is a pattern of walking and breathing that will bring the travelers safely through the boundaries of Cecelyne and Creation, a sort of ritual invocation of the border itself.

"And who among us shall grant her those memories?" asks Gallius quietly. "Are you going to surrender them now?" She is glad to have found this man, at least, and avoid having to wander the endless paths. "And is there anything else we need to know, except the path?"

"I will forget my life on Gaia," answers Ra, immediately. "All you need know is the path out. Once Cecelyne appears to us, then follow it as I have instructed. But.. I will gladly give up my time on that dead world, and all my memories of what came before."

"And I shall hold true to the words I have spoken," answers Gallius. "The you that is to be will be freed from slavery." She knows it must be possible. She simply does not know how.

"It is only dead to such as us," says Davron, mostly to himself. "But then, our kind do not belong there. It is a place for mortals, and they seem content enough there."

---

Weeks have gone by. The group feels the pressure of their armor, the weight of their weapons. Those things that have passed from them during their transition through the Well have returned, and none could say precisely when it returned. The time spent in the desert has blurred together into a nebulous eternity of their past.

Jin-nu has had to be carried more than once. Curiously she still retains her human shape, but she is adapting to it well. Ra has grown stronger; his time of sleep has passed, and his old strength has returned. He has spoken to his companions much of his times both on Gaia and in the service of the Dowager. He gives these memories as gifts, before they are taken completely from him by the Endless Desert through which they now walk. He is still the bronze-skinned, regal king the Solars met. He could pass for a tall, powerful Southerner in any hub city.

As a sorcerer and summoner of demons, Davron is by turns fascinated and repelled by the black desert itself through which they pass. Ever mindful of the danger of knowing too much about the Yozis, he nevertheless tries to understand what his Creation-borne mind can cope with - though the fact that he can't remember when his armor returned is an emphatic reminder that he should not consider his knowledge to be especially reliable.

Chi-Yosh feels the weight of his equipment, the latent Essence of weaponry and hearthstones. It feels like the touch of a long ago lover, or a fish finally returned to water. The desert feels different, but things are slowly melting back to Creation. They are almost there, a world that needs them, and their quest to come to its next step.

Gallius helps carry Jin-nu whenever it is needed, and all the while she speaks to Ra, asking questions of the Dowager. Asking of the numbers of the Abyssals and any plans he might know. She desires to learn all she can to save her twisted cousins, starting with this man.

---

Ra remembers a time before, when Bagrash Kol almost conquered the world. The legendary sorcerer may have been a reborn Solar, or he may have been an Outcaste Terrestrial who somehow acquired monumental sorcerous power. Nobody is quite certain. He remembers other things, like a secret convocation of the Deathlords in Nexus in the year before the Contagion.

In that time of the Shogunate and its downfall, many things were different. The powers that had filled the void of the Solars' passing still jockeyed for control. The Realm had not yet grown into its power, and the Empress gained the throne but sat fitfully upon it. In that era, the Deathlords were different too. Their Abyssal servants were new, and more trusted. However, the Deathlords have always been canny planners. Ra admits that fully half of what he knows is likely deception on the Dowager's part to confuse even he, her once-loyal vassal.

The alliance of the Deathlords, at least, seems to have ended with the Great Contagion. Following it, they became fractious and isolated from each other. Perhaps it is a benefit to the world that it marked the downfall of a period of cooperation between them.

As for other Abyssals, Ra isn't sure. Times have much changed since he existed in Creation. If it is possible, he suggests attacking the Monstrance of Celestial Portion - the "Essence cage" in which the Deathlords keep the sparks of their corrupted Solar slaves - or somehow enacting great magic on an Abyssal who wishes atonement.

The Dragon-Kings, Ra has no knowledge of directly. He does know that the Dowager studied them intently, and perhaps even communed with a few of their souls that hovered somewhere about Rathess and the temple she called home. She would never share the details of her searches; all he is confident of is that their souls somehow gave her access to the knowledge of the Well she now possesses.

On the topic of shadowlands, Ra knows that they have been around as long as the underworld has. Wherever there has been death, a shadowland would grow if nourished by it. The Deathlords have used necromancy to enhance or create shadowlands of their own, and some such zones of black fate are supported by the intrinsic power of a Deathlord or some sorcery enacted by one.

---

On the fifth day of travel over Cecelyne - for the Solars can now remember the general time of their entrance - the group comes to a dune. Ra walks up it first, while Jin-nu lies exhausted against Gallius. The party's water is almost gone, and all are hungry. Ra returns, pointing over the dune. "We have reached the end," he says. "Beyond, there is nothing more. I... do not encourage you to look."

Gallius considers for a moment, then nods. She carefully settles Jin-nu onto the black sands and pushes forward. She will stand beside Ra, and stare into the greater emptiness. "Here at last, the run ends," she says softly, only raising her eyes to see when she stands at the side of Ra.

Beyond the dune is nothing. At first Gallius' mind reels, struggling and grasping for something to compare it to. It is not darkness, because that would be something identifiable. It is not light, for that would also be something. It is not grey. It is not even 'it'; there is the dune, and then there is nothing else. The Zenith feels her stomach moving in faint nausea as she beholds the absence of anything that is Oblivion.

"So here is where it is kept," Gallius says, her voice mirroring the nothingness, absent of all feeling. She reaches down mechanically, at first touching the sands to remind herself that something exists. What she does next she cannot justify or explain, for she casts the sand out against the nothingness that expands before her, perhaps seeking anything at all that might fill it.

HERE AND EVERYWHERE, a voice echoes across the desert, a cold and lonely wind that sings of pain. OBLIVION IS NOT PUT INTO A BOX. OBLIVION IS WHEREVER NOTHING IS.

Gallius cringes, putting her hands to her ears and shuddering. She isn't certain when she turns away. She doesn't recall that she turned away. She is just one moment staring off into absence, and the next she has thrown herself blindly into Davron, her face pressed to his shoulder, sobs racking her body. The Solar's courage has finally met its match, and it seems her feet still want to keep flying away from this place, judging from their uneven, wild kicking at the sand.

YOU STARE AT THAT BEYOND THE PROVINCE OF HOPE, BEYOND THE BENISONS OF MERCY, BEYOND THE POWER OF DREAMS. YOU CANNOT FIGHT IT OR DEFEAT IT, ONLY ACCEPT IT. Again the wind blows, and a chill runs through the Solars. IT DEMANDS A PRICE FOR PASSAGE. THE MEMORIES OF YOUR LIFE, FROM ONE OF YOU.

Davron holds Gallius firmly. "Stand fast," he whispers, though his own voice is none too steady. "We meet now what we expected to meet when we set out five days ago. Now is the time to go forward." He looks up at Ra, and nods slightly. "Go in peace," he says softly.

Gallius at least can recover from this quickly, now that she has something to hold onto. Something that is solid. Something so very real. With a sigh she manages to push herself away. She has something to do yet. She cannot find strength for herself, but seeing Jin-nu look at her in fear rekindles the fire of the Solar, and she moves to help her friend once more. Jin-nu looks at her in concern, but Gallius shakes her head, "I have.. seen nothing, but it is past," she explains quietly.

Ra smiles faintly, turning to look at the others in turn. "Oblivion is what gives life meaning," he says. "Because there is nothing, you'll find the value of everything. In my sleep I had time to think about this." He turns back to the dune, holding up his hands. "Take my life in payment!" he shouts to the distant wind and the nonexistence it worships. A shuddering gale blows across the desert sands; Ra is engulfed in the storm for a few seconds. When it disappears, he falls to the sand and lies still.

After Gaia's only God on Earth has fallen, Chi-Yosh climbs the dune to kneel aside the crumpled man. Avoiding with all his might from looking into the yawning nothingness, Ra is picked up and carried down the dune. He sacrificed the memories of Gaia; to help through the passage of Cecelyne and beyond is a fair enough exchange. Let the help begin here.

Davron allows Gallius to stand on her own two feet and moves likewise to help Chi-Yosh. As the man who was once Ra raises his head in confusion, he speaks with firm assurance, determined to help the man as Ra himself had helped them. "We will explain later," he says. "We are in a place we do not belong, and we must leave here. Walk as we do and breathe as we do, for that is the pathway home." Once everyone appears to be ready, Davron straightens up, steadies his breathing into the pattern that Ra had taught, and puts out his foot...

---

The Solars find themselves on a grassy field, somewhere in the East by the lush look of everything. In the distance they can make out a towering glass and crystal monolith - a mansion, temple, or Manse, or perhaps all at once. Between this pastoral field and the monolith are thin groves of trees and a sweetly babbling stream.

Ra is still unsteady, and says nothing. Jin-nu, it seems, is still a human being. There are no others around, and no sign of habitation except the tower.

Gallius looks around, glad to be somewhere that seems so normal. Seems normal. She feels the world as it is meant to be and lets out a sigh. And she realizes that she is holding Jin-nu's hand. She looks to her friend in confusion. "We're.. home.." she murmurs, her certainty far from what it was.

Jin-nu shakes her head slowly and smiles. "Watch," she murmurs, and is surrounded by a shimmering aura. When it fades a moment later, she has become the equine creature she once was.

Davron closes his eyes for a moment, just savoring the light and warmth of his patron the Unconquered Sun, whose gaze he had missed these many months. "We belong here," he whispers softly. It is not long, though, before his mind returns to more practical concerns. "Though where we _are_ in home is a matter open to question..."

Gallius studies her surroundings with care. "We are back in Creation," she says more certainly. She also smiles at her friend, "And it seems all is back as it should be." Hearing Davron, she nods agreement, but adds, "The other matter is how much time has passed since we entered the Well." She looks to the monolith, then, "Do you think someone might be living nearby?"

Davron smiles at Gallius. "That is a question that is easy enough to answer now. What do you think you need, that we might find our way back to the Nation by the shortest route?"

Chi-Yosh turns towards the monolith in turn, head tilted. "We must be somewhere," says the Su'Katan as he finds comfort emersed among Essence. "Let us find out where. And when." With that, he steps towards the glass tower to investigate.

Gallius nods to Chi-Yosh and follows him, diverting herself first to take a very long drink from that stream, joined by Jin-nu. When she's had her fill, she laughs softly. "It's water! It's real water!" For a time she just sits there, basking in the taste, and then she dunks her head into it, heedless of its temperature, only aching to feel and banish the last thoughts of Oblivion.

Davron steps up beside Chi-Yosh. "It is not necessary to investigate that monolith to go home," he says... and then grins. "But it is necessary to do so to find out what it is."

---

The tower is like a holy cathedral; its architecture is clearly beyond anything the Second Age is capable of. Davron's stirring memories put it at the height of the First Age, or perhaps even earlier.

The Solars find a large set of transparent double doors that open to a touch, and enter the place after finding it safe to do so. Within, a babble of voices can be made out; voices speaking in Old Realm. They come upon a main hall, where two men and a third creature all stand and converse. The men are young, handsome and strong-looking, clearly Exalted just by their appearance. The third is an ugly, scaly beast, like a dragon or great bipedal lizard of some kind. It wears a rough cloak woven of leaves, and on its scaled claws are rings or jewels.

Gallius does not know Old Realm. She does, however, recognize it when she hears it. She also has this sinking, strange feeling. How much time could have passed? Is this even the right Creation at all? She murmurs softly to her companions, "Cecelyne borders all things that are and are not.. does she also border all things that were and will be?"

The men and the lizard-thing - a Dragon King, the Solars realize after a moment - are discussing a river. But the way they describe it, it's as though the river does not exist but will soon. When they speak of its course, they are not describing what they know but outlining what they would prefer. And after a moment, the Solars become aware of a fourth presence, a dematerialized spirit that hovers close. The trio seem intent on assigning the spirit as god of the river.

"It would seem so," Davron whispers softly. "What they discuss is beyond us in our time. We are either in the First Age, or in a time when the wonders of the First Age are restored." A faint smile flickers across his face. "I wonder what they intend to call the river?"

Finally, discussions cease. The Dragon King and one of the Solars both bow politely to the other, then turn, making their way directly for the group of lost travelers. Neither seems to notice the strangers in the hall, and both walk right through them like they were ghosts.

Now that is disturbing. Gallius must try something. "You there! Stop!" she calls, turning to face the Solars. It's worth a try, right?

Despite the imperative command, the two men and the reptile-man give no indication of hearing.

Davron rubs his chin. "Well, we might as well have not whispered after all," he says contemplatively. "It seems that we aren't exactly home just yet." He pauses, and looks at his hand. _Yang, it's good to have you back again,_ he thinks, feeling bashful that he didn't greet the soulbound Sidereal earlier. _What do you make of this?_

Gallius recalls the door. That seemed to obey her commands. She rushes ahead to go use it, hoping that the odd behavior will be noticed. Surely these wise Solars will find some way to sense her.

_The Loom of Fate knows you are not in the proper time and place,_ Yang's silent reply answers. _It will 'walk' you through the threads of Destiny until it has found the right spot for you, as it was designed to do. You will see things of great interest to you, but you will not be able to interact with them until you are once again in your right time and place._

Davron conveys this to his friends. "It looks like we've still got a long walk home ahead of us. But this time, at least, reality conspires in our favor, rather than against us."

"And all we can do is tag along," says Gallius. "I would like to see more of this place. If we could see a city of the First Age, we might learn a great deal to help us build our future. Even so.." She frowns in thought, "A pity we can't fly about. We might walk a long ways only to shift to whatever the loom decides to try next. Is it not true that in this age we might see the Book we so eagerly seek before it was ever lost?"

Davron scratches his head. "Well, with nothing but our own two feet to walk on, we won't get to such places anytime soon. Shall we follow our three river-engineers and see where _their_ path leads?"

"It seems we have nothing else to do," says Gallius. "We can't really help the Loom anyway. At least I don't know how. We may learn something of interest if we follow them."

And so saying, the Solars head outside. For the time being, Ra is riding Jin-nu; he lapses between periods of consciousness and sleep unpredictably, and the Wyldling is doing her best to tend him. The Solar and the Dragon-King stand outside, quietly chanting syllables together. Then out of the ground erupts a column of light. "I will consult the Book," explains the human to his scaly counterpart, and at the mention of 'the Book', the Solars feel a jarring sense of dislocation...

---

The group stands in an enormous hemisphere. It seems to be an ampitheater whose roof is composed of four of the Magical Materials. Jade struts and framework; starmetal lamps; and two shining discs that provide illumination, made out of orichalcum and moonsilver. And assembled here are five hundred and one seats, all opulent beyond imagination. And sitting in those seats, or in some cases standing, are five hundred and one beings. All wear the glowing robes and decorative circlets the Solars remember from Yu-Shan. In most cases there are six to nine gems in the circlets.

At the center of the assembled throng is a dais on which stand three figures, similarly robed. And on three pedestals, spaced equally around the dais, are three books: one gold, one silver, and one of a softer mixture of colors.

Gallius needs a moment to get her bearings, and then to marvel at the structure itself, followed by far more gaping at those who are gathered here. This can be only one thing. "The Deliberative," she murmurs, saying one of the few things she knows of in Old Realm.

Chi-Yosh soaks in the faces of the Solars of Old, drinking them in, seeking any who might trip the memories of old. A spark barer? An associate? So many potentials. While none speak to him, he can feel nothing but the depth of time and comfort in the presence of so many brethren.

Gallius sees her reflection here, smiling at the sight of Jyamis. For a time she just admires this place, thrilled by the glory of the past. At first she feels that way. Then something entirely different starts to grow on her shoulders, like a terrible weight. This is the past. This is what she must live up to. They are so many.. how can she possibly not just match them, but do far better than they ever did? The thought sags her shoulders, and now, standing utterly outside of fate, worn from the sight of Oblivion, Gallius is more exhausted than she has ever imagined being.

"The Great Work is going forward!" bellows one of the speakers, laying his hand on the starlight book. Beside him, the second of the three on the dais, a young Chejop Kejak stands quietly, listening in awe to his mentor. "The Prototype Looms are functioning as described, and five Dreamers have already converted forty-two thousand square miles of Wyld into usable land." There is a wash of applause from the audience at this; good news, clearly. "Now, there are those of you who questioned the wisdom of this proposal. We have studied the fate of this project as best we could, and our findings are recorded. Book of the Stars!" His hand withdraws, and the volume underneath it opens of its own accord. "Your analysis."

The voice that answers is monotone, inflectionless; it is an automatic voice of a magical construct. "Success is assured to ninety-nine percent," the dispassionate voice replies. "Sorcery constructs necessary to sustain the reclaimed Wyld will persist in excess of four hundred eighty three years beyond specification." And again a burst of applause sounds.

The Deliberative discusses other matters, all as weighty. For several hours, Gallius, Davron, Chi-Yosh, Ramar, Ra and Jin-nu are treated to the political, economic and magical minutae of the early First Age. Some of those gathered in the hall are recognizably their earlier incarnations. Yang also draws attention to his prior self, gathered among the elder Sidereal contingent.

The Book of Three Circles - for that is the three books on the pedestals, it seems - is apparently intelligent enough to answer questions, and even work magic of its own to a limited extent. Several times a specific member of the Deliberative is called upon to get an answer from the Book. Perhaps there are more stringent locks on its knowledge than simply being one of the Celestial Exalted.

At one point, a map of the Eastern Threshold is brought out as part of a presentation, and upon mention of the coastline of the Inner Sea and the East, the Solars and their friends again feel the sudden shift of reality.

---

The group now finds itself on a beach in the East. Chi-Yosh immediately recognizes the place; this is where Cademius, the Behemoth he and Davron faced, found his final peace.

Davron blinks, and rubs his chin. "Why here? Are we to see what tied Cademius to his fate? Or are we just here because the Loom found a place where we belonged once?"

"We are simply being bounced along," says Gallius softly. "The Loom is doing the best it can. I do not know how it works, of course, but it seems that every step is bringing us closer to home." She turns a curious look to Ra. But what of him? Will his fate now trace that of the circle?

Chi-Yosh regards the site solemnly, paying a thought to the behemoth, or rather its soul passing to Gaia. "There is nothing here to move us along our path. No scene for us to see yet that might give the Loom another clue. Could it be that we are home, or must we find the next piece for Fate to be reminded?"

Davron nods. "This is a place where Chi-Yosh and I have been; I would guess that the Loom must be getting closer to finding where we belong. If there is anything more to learn, we must pay attention, for we may not see much more."

"I think we have learned a great deal already. I believe that what we have seen indicates that we will find what we seek. Though now that we come nearer to our home, I will not speak out loud of what that is." Gallius goes on, "I would not have those who would stand in our way to know what our aim is any sooner than they must. In fact, if they were to assume we were dead for a time it would suit me quite well."

Davron directs his thought to the ring once more. _Yang, is there anything we can do to help the Loom find our proper place in reality? Travel closer to where we belong in space, perhaps?_

_Yes - find things around you that relate to your lives and existence,_ replies Yang.

"So if we head to the Nation of the Sun we might find our way back," suggests Gallius. "We have many ties there, after all. Assuming it is there by now." It's the best thing she can come up with, anyway.

Davron nods. "Roleyn is closer, though. A long walk, but quite a bit shorter than the ones we've been on already. Childhood ties can sometimes seem stronger than ones in adulthood."

Gallius nods, "And it will give us a chance to get our bearings," she adds. "I should be able to get something of an idea of how far away from ourselves we are." Assuming that Roleyn is there, of course.

---

The Solars find their way in a wooded area on the outskirts of Roleyn. They can also make out signs of a distant camp, and after two days of travel - for they still have not eaten since crossing Cecelyne - the odor of food is irresistable. Approaching, the group discovers that there is a cluster of beastmen encamped in the woods. And with them is a familiar figure - Ma-Ha-Suchi.

"... Fool!" Ma-Ha-Suchi is saying to a subordinate. "We'll have plenty of time for that. The farmers of the East must remember their courage. Their Confederation is weak. I will make them strong." His beast-man lieutenant says something else, and the Lunar speaks again. "Of course I am doing this for my own reasons. And you are a fool to question me. I am not some regent, subject to your whims. I do as I wish, and you will either follow me or flee like a coward. If I see fit to do this, I will do it."

Gallius frowns at the sight of Ma-Ha-Suchi and his forces. "Well, this may be rather ironic," she says simply. "We've run into my distant ex-husband and attempted murderer. Not to mention he'll have to break my arms for interfering with his war against the Realm."

Davron nods. "Well, perhaps today is the day he intends to 'strengthen our Confederation' by slaying a princess of Roleyn to send a message to her father - and ends up succeeding in a way he does not intend," he says, grinning at Gallius. "Shall we find out?"

The big Lunar turns, fingering the moonsilver weapon at his side. "This princess has a foretold destiny. If I wish to take a day to awaken whatever strength she's prophecied to have, then I will. We will attend to the other matter later.." And at another unheard question, Ma-Ha-Suchi seems to think for a moment. "Her name was Gallius.." And again the Solars feel the jolt of disconnection...

---

Even before reality coalesces around them again, Davron murmurs in wonder, "By Helios. It seems Ma-Ha-Suchi knew what he was doing that day after all. I wonder how he found out..." And then he blinks, to see what the Loom has found for them next...

The group finds themselves in darkness. There is a spot of light in the distance, and the air is thick and filled with echoes off stone - the group is in a cave of some kind.

As Davron's Caste Mark shines on his head, the Solars find themselves in a long, fairly straight stone passageway. Ra is still slumped over Jin-nu, whose hooves ring on the stone of the floor. Although not curved or crooked, the walls are irregular and have not been worked. This is a natural cavern of some kind, with the outlet of it visible.

Gallius is still reacting to the revelation from before. "He.. knew," she murmurs quietly. "I must go to him when we return, no matter what risk it may have." She looks around as Davron lights the place, then begins making her way out of the cave. Or trying to.

After many steps, the Solars emerge - and freeze. Around them, all around them, are demons. A million variations on the horrors of the Yozis are present here, on the streets of this town, peering through its windows, holding weapons or carrying other things. And they all turn and look at the six people who emerge from a cavern at the center of a large town-square.

In the distance is a great black gate, and walls of a similar color and texture. Overhead, the sun is concealed by clouds, but the dry air of the Southern lands is heavy and oppressive.

Gallius doesn't care where this is, exactly. It's pretty clear that she doesn't want to be here. And it's crystal clear that the demons see her. She cries out, "Run!" and breaks for the gate. It seems a logical enough place to flee to. Jin-nu does not falter, letting Ramar spring on her back before she rushes at the gate. At her side, Gallius likewise charges, calling upon her essence and turning her head this way and that, ready to block any strike that might come her way. She hopes her friends are feeling fleet of foot.

Davron falls into formation behind Gallius, drawing an arrow from the quiver and preparing to loose it at the first demon to block the Circle's path. The Loom has found a place for the Circle at last... and it is not a comfortable one. But no one ever said Fate was nice.

Chi-Yosh's moving as Gallius calls for the charge. As swift as the winged Wyldling, the Solar breaks ahead, radiant staff whirling as he makes headway for the Circle. While Gallius may protect from blows, and Davron to blow those who threaten to bar them, let their path be as wide as the Dawn's swing.

A thousand demons, like a tidal wave of nightmare, rise up and are chasing after the Solars - and moving to block their path. Gallius and her weapon swing and swing again, carving swaths of inhuman flesh out of the wall of evil threatening to bar them from their only salvation. Chi-Yosh stays busy as well, fighting off those demons who seek to follow the group and tear Gallius and Ra from their mount. Ramar's golden blade flashes hither and yon on each flank, and Davron's keen archery disposes of the apparent leaders of the attack, who are shouting commands to the other demons from the rooftops of this place.

They reach the gate, which is already opening in anticipation of their arrival, and see two bearded human faces beyond it. One of the men there is beckoning urgently - "Come on! Come on!" he shouts in Flametongue, and the Solars need no urging. Through the Gate and into a wide, open street they burst, with the massed demons slamming against the gate as it shuts behind them.

Gallius turns, defiant just past the gate, glaring back at the masses of demons, and above her, roaring fearlessly is her banner, the lion seeming brighter and more formidible than ever in her eyes. After the gate is shut, it hits her, and she studies her companions. Seeing them all alive and well, she raises her voice to Helios, singing for pure joy at being again where she belongs, singing heedless of those about her.

Chi-Yosh's anima claws at the air, his brow lit with the seal of Helios' Guard. He looks over the street, of the surprised, fearful or excited faces. The feel of the sun beating down upon them like a welcoming kiss from a father reunited with his children, spirits somewhere, everywhere, demanding acknowledgement, worship, Essence surging and whirling in the glory of their gifts. They are home. The Dawn raises his staff in the air, and joins Gallius in song.

Davron falls to his knees, panting but smiling, still feeling the exhilaration of Solar essence flowing through him, like it has not in longer than he can remember quickly. "_Now_ we're home..." he says, wiping his glowing brow. And facing the problems of Creation... but right now he feels able to take on the world.

The guardsmen at the gate step back, and across the street a man in a long robe is approaching, flanked by other men wielding long naginatas. They are the Scholar-Knights and Summoner Knights of Kish, the Southern city, the "hidden demon-city" Davron remembers from his readings.

The man in the robes bows politely. "You are the Exalted," he says, speaking something which is obvious to observers. Rather, it is the prelude to what follows. "By law you must declare yourselves to the Guard. Why have you not done this?"

Gallius looks at the man strangely, considering for a time. "We just did when we passed your guards," she answers. She gestures to the mark burning upon her brow, "We have not hidden ourselves, nor did we as we passed your gate."

After a moment, the man's face registers surprise. "You came from Cecelyne," he concludes. "You didn't simply sneak into the Demon Half. Very well, come with me." Whirling, and flanked by his guards, he leads the way into the city.
