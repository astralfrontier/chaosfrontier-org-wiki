# Gods of Eden 2004-11-19

The homecoming of a queen would usually call for celebrations and banquets. Usually. When Gallius returns to her nation, however, she forestalls any such attempts. Firstly she must learn what she may of how things have turned since she was away. Much of this news is as she feared it must be. Events have turned against her, and the Confederation of Rivers no longer smiles upon the Nation of the Sun. The reason for this Gallius finds troubling. As if she would truly work with the Fair Folk! It cannot be fixed now, though. Fortune has smiled upon Gallius' people and it seems the banner of the Nation of the Sun now holds sway over the Hundred Kingdoms. This will open up options she will consider in time.

As important as the workings of the nation itself is the condition of Gallius' daughter, Sanith. She does not send for the girl, but instead goes to her, eager to see how she has fared while her mother was away. The stories of dancing for diplomats make Gallius laugh. She can't help but feel proud of the child for doing so well.

The next thing Gallius seeks to do is renew herself. It takes a few days, but finally she comes to understand just what she must do to regain her faith. She must take back what belongs to her Circle. The airships that were lost are too valuable to leave in the hands of others, hostile or otherwise.

The key to this recovery is learning where the lost engine is and where the other ship wound up after it was essentially abandoned by the Well of Udr. Gallius has a good enough idea already for the first, but she seeks to make use of the Spy to learn of the second. As usual, to reach him she takes a series of long walks alone through the forests near Bridal Veil. It is not long before she has the unique sensation that she is not alone. Turning slowly she finds in her own tracks a white stone. She reads the brief message left bound to it and answers aloud. "I have been seeking something that is lost. But in doing so we have lost much. Two airships we had that are now in other hands. One is nothing but a wreck, but I know well enough where its engine lies. The other has likely fallen into foul hands. I wish to know where that one is. If you find it, please reach me in one of your usual ways. By then I should have us prepared to take it back."

Naturally there are many things for a queen to see to, and many people have the right to call upon Gallius. Cloudburst is one who always has that freedom. The Scavenger Lord is truly an impressive repository of wisdom, and at times this has proven critical. The talk between Gallius and the Mistress of Lost Visions (another new title) focuses on Rathess and the Well of Udr. Though much has been written at one time or another about these things, Gallius' information concerning the Well is certainly enlightening and Cloudburst racks her with questions for an entire morning. Only after a hasty lunch does Gallius turn the conversation back to Rathess.

Cloudburst has little to say of the Dragon Kings that Gallius hasn't already heard or guessed. Some of the other information is most fascinating, however. The existance of a High Temple of Helios somewhere in Rathess definitely catches the interest of the Zenith, as does the Great Observatory, a machine built by the Dragon Kings that harnesses the essence of numerous manses to create a replica of the stars and heavens that enabled those with the knowledge to peer somewhat into the future. The dome Gallius describes is not one that Cloudburst knows of, though the Mistress of Lost Visions will do what she can to learn about it. That is a trait Gallius finds most admirable in the woman. Give her a puzzle and she will not rest until she's pried out an answer.

The notion of channeling essence between manses tickles Gallius' mind, and she stores this away. Davron will later be given an idea she has. If manses can be alligned, could they perhaps augment the potency of a Hearthstone? And if so, how might this be done? The reason for such questions is simply explained. Gallius bears a stone that allows her to restore life to plants and thus greatly combat Shadowlands. If that power were to be augmented, say doubled or tripled in potency would any Shadowland be able to long withstand it? If the Deathlords even had a suspicion that she was making such a thing, though, it would likely spark war. A war she knows her people do not yet have the power to survive, much less win.

A wind chime sings inside of the crystaline palace that is Erisus's home. Distracted from his work, the ancient Lunar steps to a vein of the wall and presses his forehead to it. Through the water pumping through the wall, falling out at the entrance of the palace, he can spy the figure drawing towards his home. Coming to the door to stop is a swirling cloud of dust and fireflies, a scroll case held in the the whirling mass.

The message is brief. "Erisus. We are on the move against Abyssals, assistance needed. Gather those of Luna's Chosen who will listen. Also, someone we hope you might be able to help and tutor." Crumpling up the scroll, Erisus grudgingly sends his own message. Curt, simple. "Very well."

---

Two days later, the Volo lands down river from the ancient Lunar's home. Chi-Yosh and Gallius, Ra between them, make the short trek up and are greeted by Erisus, flanked by Sun-and-Moon and a third, un-known figure. Choosing to explain Ra's presence later, the exchange of pleasantries is brief; there are all ready guests inside, impatiently waiting.

Gallius bows to Erisus and his companions. "It is good of you to receive us so swiftly. We bring with us a friend whom we met in a rather strange place. We have brought him from Gaia. On the path back, he lost all that he was. In the life he lost, he bore the name Ra. As you can see, he is purified of all mind and spirit. I fear we have not yet had much success restoring his abilities, thus he will be a rather quiet companion, until he gets hungry." Gallius sighs softly, saddened by the situation. "I wish to see him restored, for he helped us return and has already survived an illness far worse than any I've ever seen before."

"Another Solar?" murmurs the No Moon, his voice flat. "And you wish me to make him into... what?"

"Into whatever he wishes to be," says Gallius. "Right now he is little more than a child, but I think his destiny is to become a great sorceror. I ask you because I trust you more than any other. This man may be a blank slate, but for his service and for what he is, he is dear to me. Though he may be aged far more than I, he is lost, and I ask you to care for him and make him into the man he deserves to be. Will you do this?"

The Lunar looks from face to face. At his side is Sun-and-Moon. And for a moment she presses close to him, squeezing his arm and looking up at him intently, her face conveying a fleeting but important message. Erisus sighs. "Very well," he says at last. "I will educate him, and test him. If he survives our initiation and becomes a No Moon, I will even teach him sorcery."

Gallius bows deeply, "Thank you," is all she has to say. She turns to the man that was once Ra and smiles reassuringly, earning an uncertain smile in return.

As Sun-and-Moon takes Ra further into the palace, Chi-Yosh turns to Erisus. "Thank you for giving Ra a chance. But, there is more at stake than simply his well being." Erisus holds up a hand, and leads the two Solars into the room with an audience of the assembled. Taking a seat, he allows Chi-Yosh the floor. "The Dowager perches like a buzzard, looking over Erisus's territory hungrily. Her servants have stolen our airship. We seek to reclaim it, and in the process sever the dark hand of her knights from her. Soon, we will also try and drive her from here. We do not have the capability yet, but we will soon."

The No Moon nods slowly. "Then good fortune to you," he says.

Chi-Yosh smiles ruefully. "It is not just about reclaiming what is ours, but removing some of her powerful servants. The Children of Luna have great strength, strength that would aid us in this. We..." He stills off, and glances sideways at Gallius, before back at Erisus. "How selective are the ears to dangerous secrets, here?"

Erisus' look at Chi-Yosh is heavy with warning. "She is the queen of sorcerers indeed, who can make her way into my home unremarked," he half-growls. The unspoken version is as strongly heard: do you question my ability to safeguard my own home?

"We ask meaning no offense," says Gallius. "Perhaps more out of ignorance. We wish to bar those from our lands, but it seems we have failed. This, too, we must learn, for we bring news to you of something that we have not spoken of even in my own home. We have passed through Gaia, Erisus. We reached that place by falling through the Well of Udr. We returned by walking the endless desert of Cecelyne. We did this all seeking word of a tome of lore that would change our fortunes in the wars that are to come. You know of the tome I speak of."

This news makes the Lunar pause in consideration. Sun-and-Moon seems ready to speak, but without even seeing her move toward him from the side, Erisus' hand rises to silence her. After several moments more, he finds words. "You know of the Book," he says. "Very well. To pursue it, you want to escape from prying eyes. I will teach you what I know."

"The Book does not belong to Solars alone," says Gallius softly. "We wish for Lunars to join us. I want to build a friendship and respect among us. The Deathlord has taken property from my Circle, and we wish you to fight beside us. I wish to show the entire world that the Celestials will once again fight side by side to restore the world."

"I have accepted one obligation from you. Now you ask another, which may interfere with the first if I am killed," the Lunar answers. "But I will consider it. Valon and Sunrise Seer may be enough.. I will give you an answer in due course."

"Your aid to us is already clear," agrees Gallius. "And I would not have you risk yourself and put Ra and Sun-and-Moon at risk. There are other ways you have shown favor to our cause in the past, however. This time, it would enter battle with another warstrider of great history at its side. But I trust your wisdom. I also give this promise. Whenever we do drive the shadow from the Well of Udr, none of mine will interfere in any claims the Lunars might wish to make. I can think of no better guardians for that dangerous place."

Now Erisus' eyes narrow, in shrewd calculation. "You must know what is there.. And you have no designs on it? Curious indeed. ... Very well, I accept. I will do whatever you require."

"I know what it is.. but I fear it," Gallius says quietly. "While I was in Cecelyne I stared into Oblivion, Erisus. As I stared out into that nothingness the universe vanished and all I had was my mind, crying and struggling as it was slowly torn away, until only the part of me that is really me was left. That part I understand is the wisest part of me. It knows that there are some things that I am simply not ready for. Perhaps you can one day teach me the full purpose of the Well of Udr."

With all the goals achieved, Gallius and Chi-Yosh say their farewells. It seems that the Circle shall have the favor and friendship of Erisus and some Lunars, even if Gallius has caused such trouble for them with Ma-Ha-Suchi. At least that can be more quickly fixed than most things! For now, though, there are still more things to do.

---

After securing the assistance of the Lunars, Gallius and Chi-Yosh do not return to the Nation, but instead make for Great Forks. Gallius has spoken with the Dragon Princes, those fifty mercenary Dragon-Bloods who dwell in her borders and wish to increase their abilities by mingling their blood with gods and spirits and decided that Great Forks might be interested in making a deal of sorts. After discussing this with Marina and Cloudburst, as well as the rest of her Circle, the Queen decides it is a worthy pursuit that is likely to profit everyone.

This leads her to take to the air with Chi-Yosh, going from Prowler's Lair to the city of Great Forks, a city of scholars that might appreciate the aid of Dragon Princes and could repay them in ways they appreciate. For brokering such a deal, Gallius has certain prices of her own, naturally. Great Forks is the only nation she knows of to successfully drive-off a Deathlord. It is also one of the most magically gifted places in Creation. The Dragon Princes, she hopes, will become more tightly-bound to her Nation. She has need of their loyalty beyond that which coin gains her.

The city of Great Forks again shows its beauty and grandeur. From the air, the streets and rivers and bridges sparkle with white stone; nearer the ground, the buzz of a million eager voices fills the air with a novel background hum. The city's gates are guarded by stern-looking ifrits, their flaming horns and unforgiving countenances an implied threat against all those coming to break the peace of the city. And beyond them, the majestic palace of the Three themselves brings silence to even the gayest and most thoughtless of speakers. From it shines the evident architecture of the First Age, though to the Solars' traveled eyes it is more of a pale echo than a true reproduction.

As delegates of a foreign power in the region, the Solars are welcomed into the palace and escorted through a monumental hall. They enter a circular chamber wherein are three thrones, and a dais at the center of them. Upon the thrones sit three strange beings, all beautiful and enigmatic in their own way. These are the fabled Three, the spirit patrons of the city.

Gallius has not worn her most ornate clothing, but is well-dressed. The goal is to appear in a state that is respectul as possible. One can hardly pack a gown on the back of a flying horse and wear armor at the same time. She bows to the Three and begins her introduction modestly, "I am Gallius Leom of the Nation of the Sun." She turns then gesturing to Chi-Yosh and saying, "And this is our Champion, Chi-Yosh, of the Order of the Vigilant Dawn. We have come to treat with the leaders of Great Forks."

The male, Spinner of Glorious Tales (or Talespinner when one must be brief), rises from his throne and introduces himself. "With me are Weaver of Dreams of Victory," and this enigmatically-cloaked figure bows from its throne, "and Shield of a Different Day." The martial-seeming woman who occupies the third rises and bows stiffly. They are less formally known as Dreamweaver and Dayshield, and are known to the two Solars already. With a mere motion of his eyes Talespinner signals the guards, and the mortals take their leave of this chamber as their master (and if truth be known, personal comfort) dictates.

Gallius nods politely to the departing mortals. She can imagine they are happy to be away from the anathema. It is far from likely that they haven't heard of the Solars here by now. She waits for some further sign that she should speak on.

Talespinner remains on his feet. Now Dreamweaver rises, gesturing. "Tell us the tale you have brought," a soft feminine voice instructs.

"The tale we bring is one of hope, hope and light that will drive back the shadows that even now linger not so far from this beautiful city," says Gallius. "Through your great skill and power Princess Magnificent with Lips of Coral and Robes of Black Feathers was driven away from your lands. But in her place another lives. Walker will not hold back forever, and so we have come to offer you assistance. Among our people are those who are greatly skilled in battle and they would aid you, if you will provide them aid in turn."

The third, Dayshield, now rises. "Continue," her strong and clear voice commands.

"Those I speak of call themselves the Dragon Princes. They are fifty Terrestrial Exalts who wish to have ties with gods and great spirits. If such aid was granted them, they could prepare for you an army that would be better able to defend Great Forks from your adversaries." Gallius looks to Dayshield and adds, "For our part in helping this come about, we ask for some aid as well, and we will make a promise that is for the ears of the Three alone."

Talespinner opens his hands invitingly. "This road seems good to walk, if you speak truly. Will you permit me the surrogation?"

Gallius nods to Talespinner. "I will permit it."

From Gallius, a glowing phantom of light steps forward. And from Chi-Yosh, a similar apparition appears. Together, the two glowing poltergeists radiate quietly on the dais. Slowly, echoes of questions begin to faintly register on the ears of the two Solars. It sounds like the voices of the Three, putting questions to them, and yet it is their surrogates - the bodies of light - that are answering, in their voices. The rising volume of questions quickly becomes a tumult, the fluctuating answers, questions and counter-questions rising almost to an unbearable loudness. The Solars are forced to cover their ears at last, until - "It is done," says Talespinner. The glowing bodies are gone, as are the sounds.

Gallius looks to Chi-Yosh, wondering what has happened. She can guess. It seems that copies of her will always be answering questions. Still, if it gains trust, so much the better. "I hope you have learned what you require," answers the queen in what she hopes is a calm voice.

Chi-Yosh shares that look with Gallius. After having met their simulacra in Kish, it's not that great a surprise to determine what it might be. Their true intentions stepping out to answer questions for them.

"You have seen this technique before," observes Dreamweaver. "I thought the secrets of this magic were now ours alone, but.. there are many strange things in our world, and we are not privy to all of them." Talespinner chuckles softly at this, then continues. "Your offer is fascinating, but the knowledge we offer you is dangerous."

"Danger is something we have no choice but to face," answers Gallius softly. There is no pride in her voice, just resolve. "We have seen much, and have no choice but to accept that we shall see far more terrible things in the future." And here she thinks of the Oblivion and for a moment falters before she wrestles her mind from the memory. "You know well what we are. I believe you likely know what the Abyssals are, as well. If that is true, you can see why it is the duty of the Solars to see that the Abyssals are taken care of. And whenever possible saved. Until not a one of them remains in the darkness."

"Such things are not our duty," replies Dayshield firmly. "This city, and its people, are our purview." "But we are not unmoved by your goals, and you offer a fair trade which benefits all," adds a man's voice, from the cloak that Dreamweaver hides behind. "Your very existence necessitates a war by the powers that hold the world. We wish to defend ourselves in that war, and you offer us a way. Very well. We will teach you the secret you desire."

"Thank you," says Gallius. "We will do what we may to steer the war to come far from your borders. And hopefully our battle will bring your people a lasting peace." She bows to the Three, then. "We will inform the Dragon Princes that they are expected, if that is your wish."

The Three raise their arms in unison, and a network of glowing runes appears on the walls of the chamber. The air becomes thick with sparkling Essence, and the Solars can feel each breath pulling power into their lungs. It takes their every measure of control not to shiver and jump as the lifeblood of existence seeps into their bones, and the guarding runes grow brighter still.

"Each Deathlord has a name," they say in unison, creating an inhuman harmony of voice that no mortal trio could achieve. It is a single, unified voice coming from no earthly throat, and the Solars feel the hair of their neck rising as they hear it. "Each name is bound to a history. If the Deathlords are ghosts, they must have once lived. What they fear is their name, and a reminder of who they once were."

Gallius does not feel herself tremble. Such sensations seem lost to her. She can feel her body, but it is as if she were hearing about it in some tale rather than being inside it. "So if we find their names and their stories, they will flee from us," she murmurs softly. "Why would they fear such a thing?" she thinks aloud, not even aware she has spoken at first.

"Because they cannot bear to remember what they have lost," the three-in-one voice replies.

"Seek the one known as the Emissary of Nexus, for it is from that being that we learned their weakness," the voice continues. "For though we could tell a tale of the spreading of the name, that power is beyond you, and no Deathlord must ever know that it is now beyond us as well."

Gallius nods numbly, her mind feeling more and more dazed. "What they have lost," she murmurs softly. "Where.. where did they come from? What were they? Who did this to them?" Her mind races now, eager to learn all she can. If they fear that name, perhaps it might be able to destroy them. Or far more importantly, it might be able to save even the Deathlords.

"Only the Emissary knows.." the voices reply.

"We will seek him," answers Gallius.

---

Armed with this information, Chi-Yosh and Gallius head back to the Nation to resupply and regroup. A journey to Nexus is not a trip to be wasted and merits an invitation to others in the circle who would wish to join, and so Gallius, Chi-Yosh, and Davron find themselves having things gathered in preparation for a trip to Nexus. Gallius holds a rather long list of rare and rather expensive items that Cloudburst would like her to see acquired. "I think the woman believes I'm a packmule," the queen murmurs quietly. She can't help but laugh, "Perhaps, Davron, you can arrange for us to have more storage on our way back? I think I need take only what silver we can carry. If they do not wish to accept things on credit, though.. it cannot be helped. We will have to see."

Davron chuckles, touching his ring. "If we have that much to carry, then arrange a river barge and let us get a few miles down the Yanaze, and I'll see what I can do." He rubs his chin. "And if our budget can extend to a bow large enough for Pride to bear, then we may well need that option. But let us see if there are more pressing needs for our silver first."

Chi-Yosh has his own list of things to do. While it is not crucial to their quest, some personal curiousities. The origin of his orichalcum staff, and the mystery of aquiring masks for the Carnival. "Let us hope that the price for the Emissary will not detour us too much."

"If it would, we shall have to see to it later," says Gallius. "The.. other thing of interest is far too valuable." Even though the knowledge of Weeping Prowler is going to be shared, the wards are not yet ready. "But we shall at least meet the Emissary and see what we may. Is everyone ready?"

And so the Circle gathers what they can carry, each holding as much silver as possible, and makes their way to Nexus. Gallius makes use of a volo, though she does not fly far from her steed, making certain its burdens do not shift on the way.

The incredible bustle of Nexus is as daunting as ever to Davron, but at least there are some places he knows well enough, and finds comforting in his way. Carefully threading his way through the raucous crowds, he finds his way to a familiar nook and knocks on the hatch. "Pai Tao? It's Davron again," he calls.

The Scavenger Lord and merchant is in, and he remembers Davron well enough. "Come in, come in. Now, let's discuss business," he says, all bustle.

The matter of Pai Tao's latest commissions is quickly dealt with - Davron accepts the parchments and nods. "These seem straightforward enough," he says, putting them away in a scroll case. "I shall complete them as soon as I can. Now, before I go, I do have a question - do you have any idea what it'd take to find strider-sized weaponry in this town?"

The merchant nearly falls out of his cushioned seat at this. "I ah... I have no idea," he stammers.

Davron pauses, biting his lip. "I apologize," he says. "I... did not mean to astonish you." Silently, Davron curses his social ineptitude; somewhere out there, Marina is surely laughing at him.

Pai Tao shakes his head, smiling wanly. "No, no..." he says. "That sort of thing is, ah, simply out of my line. You understand. You'd want to cast about in, ah, more _military_ quarters." By which he means Lookshy and its fabled armory of weapons.

Davron nods. "That sounds reasonable enough," he says, resolving to talk to Gallius - belatedly he realizes that large-scale military hardware has political implications to which he has paid scant attention. "Thank you. As always, a pleasure doing business with you, Pai Tao."

Rabbit's roost is a little nest of luxury; a balcany that can't be reached without scaling a wall, no doubt putting whoever's looking for her at the disadvantage. Reaching the top, Chi-Yosh has a brief discussion with the lounging buck-toothed broker. He doesn't have enough money to cure her amnesia. Or rather, he doesn't feel like putting enough down, just yet; while there may be secrets to his staff he may not know of, and its history may lead to greater things, it is just not crucial right now. Besides, no telling how much silver may be needed. "I will give you time to think about it, and I will bring enough worth to refresh your recall upon my return." Rather than climb back down, a running jump puts him on the opposite roof, and steps below.
