# Gods of Eden 2004-11-20

Once Chi-Yosh and Davron have returned from their tasks, Gallius takes her leave to handle the things she needs to see to. The silver is left behind, save for an easy amount for her to handle. While she was standing guard, she tried to send messengers to the Guild, letting them gather those who have high enough standing to arrange for a large caravan and to discuss very serious matters of trade with her Nation. Assuming her messages did not go astray, she should be able to meet them without too great a delay. She naturally gets directions on the way, using some of her silver to find the right path to the Guild house where the Directors would normally stay. If any are going to be able to meet her is a question that Gallius will soon know the answer to. At the worst, she imagines she can make a future appointment.

When Gallius arrives, the greeting is not warm or generous. Considering things, she is just glad that it is not a hostile meeting. She introduces herself honestly, "I am Gallius Leom, Queen of the Nation of the Sun, and I have come seeking an audience to discuss a caravan and a relationship between my people and your organization," she explains. There is some balking at the thought of a queen coming alone. The man meeting her changes his opinion when she casts off her cloak to reveal herself wrapped in orichalcum, her naginata at her side, and then she sets a fire to her caste mark, revealing her nature to this man. "Not all queens need a host of retainers," she says simply. "You know doubt have heard of strangers coming to the city from the sky. That is how I have come."

It is not within the authority of this man to really authorize a more official meeting, nor can he treat with Gallius, and so he bows apologetically and departs for a time to speak with his superiors. The time is surprisingly short before Gallius is invited to join her contact, who finally introduces himself as Crying Moon. His level of courtesy increases considerably at this point, as well, and as he leads the queen he bows and scrapes in such a way that Gallius swiftly grows sick of it. She will certainly not have to put up with such boot-licking when she meets the Directors, she thinks. If she did, she'd have to change her opinion about the Guild.

The Directors of the Guild are vaguely shaped silhouettes hiding behind thin silk veils, arranged in a semicircle around the meeting room. This is an encounter between equals, but as the usher explains as he holds Gallius outside for a moment, encounters with magical beings follow strict protocols - for the Guild's own safety. Following this, he announces Gallius and lead her to a well-padded chair and table at the center of the room before departing. _Welcome, Queen,_ a voice echoes. Its direction is clear - the second of the seven veiled chambers - but all its distinguishing characteristics are strange. Behind the other veils, the shadows move faintly.

Gallius bows politely to those gathered here. "Thank you for receiving me. I had planned on making a grander entrance once, but I would rather we meet more quietly and avoid disrupting Nexus any more than is required. As you likely know by now, I have come in an attemp to establish relations with the Guild."

There's a sound of rustling from behind the veils. Papers shuffling? Or simply movement. _It seems your idea of relations with the Guild has not always been commercial in nature,_ another voice - the fifth over - adds. _We are listening._

"Not always," says Gallius. "Certain trades that you are involved in are things I find repellant. There are some things I wish to make clear, should you decide that coming to the Nation would be profitable. We do not tolerate slavery in our borders, nor do I wish for the drug trade to make dirty the streets of my cities. I believe that leaves many forms of trade that can be mutually profitable."

_I understand your Nation has already grown profitable off the trade of food and mineral resources with the Guild,_ the fourth veiled figure notes. _I show here sixty-three thousand bails of wheat capacity, fifty-eight barley, ... thirteen hundred tons of iron ore.. You're quite the achievers, as the Hundred Kingdoms have always been._ The second voice stirs again. _Which brings us to the question of, what more have you come for?_

"I am concerned by your dealings with the Fair Folk," says Gallius. "And I wish to help the Guild see that slavery and drug dealing in the current manner is not profitable. That will take time, though. A more immediate desire I have is for you to send a caravan to the Nation. I would like you to set up new chapter houses so that my people may learn trades and produce new, better goods. I also wish to avoid open conflict with the Guild in the future. I think we both know how costly that would prove at this point."

_The only way you will help the Guild see that is to make it unprofitable, which brings into question your wish to avoid conflict,_ the third voice answers. The fifth speaks. _A caravan can be sent. A chapter-house can be established. These things will take only three months. However, my colleague's point bears answering._

"If I destroy the Fair Folk where I find them," says Gallius, "Slavery shall prove far less profitable. I need not do damage to you to make the trade pointless. And I understand House Cynis has dealt much in flesh, as well. So much that I think they had hoped not to have to pay for it in the end. Dangerous to count on such things. In any case, yes, I do hope to change your minds. Slaving is unpopular with far less merciful forces than the Nation, however. And those forces are growing extremely powerful. To get back to the point, however, I am eager to see what the Guild and the Nation can achieve together. You will find us a good bastion against any Realm interference. Certainly their power has diminished, but we are prepared to give you far more safety from them and other unpleasant outsiders."

_Destroying our customers is materially little different from obstructing our own trade,_ points out the third voice. _You must acknowledge this. Do you intend to compensate us for the shortfall?_

"Absolutely," says Gallius. "Firstly, preventing the utter destruction of Creation by Fair Folk has value. But that is hard to quantify, and we both know that such aid is elusive to certify. I understand the Guild has a good standing with many spirits and ensures rather swift travel. What you currently lack that I can provide you is higher level sorcerous aid. I am interested in having your chapter in my lands prepare itself for the organized construction of airships. Only the Guild will be allowed to make use of these for trade. The trade in our borders and the skies above will be limited as I have explained, but you may trade with others as you always have. I ask only that you promise to not sell these vessels to our enemies. That will still leave you a great deal of clients if you would desire to sell the ships. I imagine you will find much profit in that."

There's another minute or two of sound, and a strange clacking noise, followed by a chittering. _Submit us a written proposal, at your leisure,_ the second voice suggests. _Specify number of craft, cargo capacity, speed, and durability. Our answer will come with our caravan._

"I will have this done by those in my Nation who are most competent to communicate with you with the details you desire," says Gallius. "There is still more than ships that we can offer. I am aware at how efficient the Guild has proven to be, but I believe that the aid of Solars may improve this, making you still more profitable, allowing you to catch those who would cheat you, and in our Nation we will assure your safe passage. This should reduce losses when you are within our borders. We are also training our forces and could provide extra security for your goods as they return to Nexus for fair prices. Some of the things I foresee us dealing in are going to be of interest to powerful enemies, and if they should fail to come to you safely it would be unfortunate for both of us. The details we can arrange later. It seems I at least have shown you that the Nation and the Guild both can profit together."

_Your offer is exceptionally interesting, and once we compute the value of the necessary concessions, we can provide an answer,_ the seventh voice intones. The third chimes in. _If you are faithful in keeping your part of the bargain, we will be as well. Your history suggests little love for the Guild, but even such as you acknowledge that we hold to a contract._

"I have learned a great deal since we last fought," says Gallius. "The Guild is a collection of people of different views, organized to protect themselves and acquire wealth and comforts for themselves. If I continue attacking the Guild, thinking only of the trade with the Fair Folk and the use of drugs and slaves, what service am I doing the world? It is far better for me to make the Guild find more profitable avenues. For instance, some of the drugs you sell that leave people in a stupor also find use in other forms in the hands of leeches." Gallius shifts gears to more immediate needs, recalling the list. "My loremaster has left me a list of things she wishes the caravan to include in addition to what else you require. I have a little silver on my person now and much back where my steed is. I wish to pay this in advance, and when you arrive, I will pay for the cost of your caravan as well, so that your expedition will at worst not be a loss to you. I wish to make this gesture to help establ

"I wish to make this gesture to help establish a friendship, and I trust this is not offensive to the Directorate."

_Payment at the end of the caravan's journey would be expected. We will not refuse an advance payment,_ says the seventh voice. _Leave the list with our attendant at whatever time you are ready, and he will see to it._

Gallius bows to the Directors and says, "Then I believe I have said and heard all that I have come to hear and say." The statement marks her identity, to those who are familiar with Roleyn's Royal Family. "If you have any questions, please direct them to Bridal Veil. I am often away, but there are those who are quite able to treat fairly in my name and to reach me in need. I will leave thorough instructions with them so they do not create difficulties for the Guild."

_We anticipate dealing with you, Queen,_ the left-most figure behind the veil says.
