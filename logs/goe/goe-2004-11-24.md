# Gods of Eden 2004-11-24

An emissary of Heaven is not to be taken lightly, nor are his words to be discarded out of hand. And so, during Ramar's time of relaxation from the ordeals of Gaia, it is with politeness that he admits a winged cherub-messenger to his quarters. The others of his Circle are presently seeing to their own respective business. The messenger brought with it a simple summons: "return to the Celestial City, and come to the Golden Barque of the Heavens."

With random guilt and trepidation filling his mind, Ramar answers the summons. After a short Volo ride, he approaches the Gate, willing it to open through the spell he'd learned a lifetime ago. _What did I do now?_ He passes through the Gate and into Yu-Shan, greeting the Lions cordially, with only a faint trace of worry in his voice. Was that a grin? No, best not to think about it. An egg-shaped device carries him to the Golden Barque of the Heavens handily enough, and Ramar approaches. It didn't seem quite so long a distance last time...

En route, a cool voice calls. "Hello again, Wanderer," it murmurs. Ramar's mind flashes back to the Carnival of Masks, months ago, and a similar encounter. The same invisible spirit seems to be here now, and looking around, the Solar finds himself in the same place as he encountered the god before. "It seems you fulfilled a promise I made only half in jest."

"I did?" A pause, while Relief floods Ramar's face. "Er... oh... I did, I suppose, didn't I?" The Solar glances around, as though making sure he still is where he ought to have been.

"You went to a place no living being has gone to and returned. You visited Gaia, Mother's World." The spirit's voice blows about Ramar like a wind, and he feels his ocean-kissed hair waving faintly as the breezes of the sea are conjured by the tone of it. "I am impressed."

"It was no easy task, as I remember it." Ramar continues, describing the world to the spirit. "All her life seems to have drifted here... I cannot help but wonder what happens when one of you is called home, where Essence seems bare. Though this is neither here nor there."

"Only you mortals go there; spirits do not," whispers the god, blowing hither and yon. "And now..." There's a sudden gust of air, and Ramar can feel the spirit surging for him. The winds of its being flow into his mouth and nose, filling his lungs, transmuting themselves into rawest Essence and seeping into his very bones. A few moments are all that's required. And with the infusion of the creature, Ramar can feel memories of an earlier time awakening in some unexplored part of his mind. He feels roads laid out into the darkened times of before, and the first glimmerings of light to illuminate those roads. **There is more exploration to do, Wanderer,** the spirit's voice says from within his head. **Walk the roads of your soul as you have those of Creation, and learn who you once were.**

Ramar wanders. The road through the past that is both his and one he has never experienced before is a tricky road to walk. One can get confused and forget themselves, yet Ramar is careful. Scenes of an earlier Age drift past, memories of games he'd never played, of battles he'd never fought. Essence locked away within the hidden reaches of his past now flows freely. He remembers... a young boy, barely in his teens, defeating a demon that had ravaged the lands... a man, studying in some hidden room books that were forbidden, he'd show them... a woman, laying low a beast his mind has not the strength to perceive... older now, passing wisdom of the Ages on... he remembers living, he remembers loving, and dying.

The roads each come to their own end, and there are more left to be walked. But not at this time. There's something else that needs tending to, ah yes, a life back in Creation, his own. And there the danger, of losing the self to the myriad of the Spark. Yet instead of reforging the body, perhaps the soul itself can be reforged... it has been done before. It will be done again. Ramar wakes, eyes uncertain, yet full of things long forgotten-power, hopes, dreams-and someday, his will pass with the Spark, the Spark that becomes Ramar.

---

Gallius, Davron, and Chi-Yosh return to Bridal Veil after a rather eventful set of trips. Before they even land they can see a familiar form standing in front of the fortress, however. Gallius can only smile to herself. She lands, slides off of Wingfoot, and hands the Master the message she had just finished writing before the journey back from Nexus began.

The Master takes the note, inspects the seal for a moment, then breaks it and starts to read. He makes a thoughtful noise, then nods. The circle seems destined to have little rest this night, for the Master leads them to a gateway to Yu-Shan, and once again they find themselves confronted by the Celestial Lions. Perhaps this time, however, the usual awe of those beasts is lessened. Or perhaps the glory of the Solars and the knowledge of the world they have gained has shifted this balance. To Gallius, at least, it is a noticable shifting in fate. And fate is what has brought her here. The first course will lead her to the very throne of Helios. She has questions that need answering, and a promise to keep.

The path to Helios is not one to tread with only part of the circle, however. Gallius will have Ramar sent for and wait for him before going to Helios. As is usual, she shows little will to waste time. Even the order of tasks in Yu-Shan must be efficient.

It doesn't take much time for Ramar to appear. Or perhaps he'd been waiting on a summons beforehand. Nonetheless, he is there shortly, and grateful to once again be in the presence of his Circle. "Well then... where are we going?"

"To Lord Helios," answers Gallius. "And hopefully Gaia shall be there, as well. Only they can answer our questions, now."

"Oh." Ramar states this plainly. After a moment, "Er... what exactly are our questions?"

---

"We know now that the grinding of ages in Gaia can wear away the taint from an Abyssal," says Gallius. "But we cannot risk Gaia by casting in dozens of powerful exalts. Is there some way to bring about this healing of Gaia in less than dozens of generations of men? Is there some way we can save our brothers and sisters from the shadow?"

The Solars have gathered in the tent in which Helios is taking council with his Chosen. Now the great god leans back, clasping two of his four hands together in a meditative pose and opening the other two as though expecting something. "Gaia's world does nothing more and nothing less than dissipate and distribute Essence," he booms, "as you must have felt. Much like the heat of a fireplace leaks into cold night air. If you reflect on this, your next question will be, 'why did the Abyssal taint leave, but the Solar nature remain?'"

"Yes, that is critical to know," agrees Gallius. "It seems that Ra lost what was added to him. Like removing oil from the top of water, only what was foul was swept away. It's as if Gaia were a filter of that taint."

Davron nods slowly. "The Solar nature remained because it was bound to his spark, which in turn was bound to his life..." he says, thinking aloud. "I suppose... that binding is stronger than whatever bound the death-taint to the spark. A... distillation?"

"Gaia does not purify of her own accord," says the god. "She will only absorb whatever an Exalt allows to seep away." He sits back, waiting for his Chosen to consider the implications.

"So it was a matter of his will?" asks Gallius. "He had to willingly surrender his taint to lose it?"

Davron scratches his head. "Or perhaps he did not _desire_ the death-taint. On a less portentous scale, the tail you bore, Gallius, was not part of what _you_ saw yourself to be, so it slipped away... but your Exaltation was part of who you were, and it remained."

"But the tail is every bit a part of what I am," says Gallius. And her tail flicks with her amusement. "I may not have liked it at first, but I am the Lioness. My sister is right on that account. Whether I will fulfill the prophecies of my people remains to be seen. But it seems that they were not such tall tales as I had thought."

Davron chuckles ruefully. "All right. It seems I need to think harder, then."

The Unconquered Sun nods gravely. "Your choices dictate your nature. Without the taint forced upon him, my guess is that Ra rejected death and embraced life, in the fullness of his time on Gaia."

"So there is no swift way to heal them after all," says Gallius, letting out a sigh. She shuts her eyes and shakes her head. "Is there nothing that can be done, then? To cast them all through the Well of Udr is madness. But I will not forsake them. My Lord, please.. they are your children. What can be done?"

"What can be done? Help them choose to reject their present natures." Helios' voice is firm. "You cannot force them to see light, but you can do much to help it happen. I want you to understand..." He leans forward, all four hands resting on his knees. "What they are now was not forced upon them."

Gallius opens her eyes with a start and considers. "It is as it was with our own selection, isn't it? They have one moment to make that decision. In their case, to live as a mockery or to die. And they chose in fear of death and now are dead forever."

Davron straightens at that. "They... chose to accept Death, then," he says. "And so the ones we can save are those who come to regret that choice..." He rubs his chin. "But Ra feared that it _would_ be forced on him, if he died in Gaia and returned... Was he simply wrong?"

"Fear of death, or a hatred of life," responds Helios quietly. "I do not know the whole truth, but it seems from your memories that what Ra's outlook had changed in his time on Gaia. The spark of Exaltation can be confined. It can be altered, even. That is what he feared."

"Perhaps it is that Ra feared the control that his taint offered the Dowager," Says Chi-Yosh. "The Solars bow to one and one only, and the Abyssals serve their lords less freely.

"We know now what we must do," says Gallius. "It is a harder path, and I can't see how we shall save more than a few, but perhaps when we find that which we have sought we will find a way. I will not give up on them. If we can even steal a few away every decade we will eventually draw all of our kind back to the light." Gallius considers this answer complete. She bows to Helios, having no more questions. The time to ask in Yu-Shan is done for her. The time to restore order comes next..

Davron blinks. "The Spark can be altered..." he muses, his brow furrowing. For a moment, his mind is drawn away from the Abyssals, drawn inward, to the unsettling dreams of martial cruelty that have plagued him since his Exaltation. "But... if it can be altered to be marked with Death, then a tainted Spark can be cleansed." His jaw sets. "But that does not make it right to alter someone's Spark against their will. We are not the Dowager - nor even what Ra feared the Dowager to be."

"Perhaps." Ramar considers this for a while, and his statement carries with it the weight of his thoughts on the matter. "They can be freed though... I wonder..." Ramar looks thoughtful, brows furrowed. "Is Oblivion a Primordial? Is it even permitted to ask about such things..."

"Oblivion is what it is," the god explains. "It is one of the basic truths of existence."

"Thank you." A breath, and then, "Is there a way to change the basic truths of existence?" Ramar looks fearful almost, for having posed the question, then studies the floor in front of him.

Helios shakes his head. "No. But you can use them to your own ends, if you can." He holds out a hand, and a sparkle of light encompasses his fingers. "Essence is another truth. It itself cannot be changed, but it was used in the forging of you, my soldiers."

Davron nods. "And... indeed I guess that Oblivion is the opposite to Essence. For that which has no Essence at all is that which does not exist."

---

When the circle emerges from their meeting with Helios, Gallius is already preparing herself for what she imagines will be the greatest challenge of her life. She turns to the Master and studies his eyes for a moment. "You know what I am going to say," she declares. The Master nods in return. "But I shall still say it. Take me to Chejop Kejak, the most knowledgeable of all exalts." She hopes that he still hungers for lore beyond that which he can achieve. If so, the circle has much to offer.

The Forbidding Manse of Ivy, which acts as the Division of Secrets for the Sidereal bureaucracy in Heaven, is the Solars' next destination. The Solars pass through a pair of brass-bound doors, noting the creeping ivy on the shining celestial walls that give the Division's offices its name. Within, unexpectedly, is a blank room. There is only a single other door set into one wall, and beyond it an equally featureless hallway. And at the end of that hall, another door.

Through that door is a featureless desk of mahogany, and sitting at it is an elder Exalt. The Circle recognizes the aged features of he whom they once witnessed in attendance at the Deliberative, during their return from Gaia. Gallius has seen him before, as well. And standing beside him, or perhaps hovering, is a shapeless cloak that billows out in the vaguest suggestions of a humanoid outline.

Chejop Kejak's hands are folded neatly atop the desk. All he does is look at the Circle, now assembling in the empty office. He seems expectant.

It is the eyes of Chejop Kejak that Gallius studies. For a moment, she is lost in the flecks of gold that shimmer like stars in his emerald eyes. She offers a deep bow to him, then speaks. "Thank you for seeing us," says Gallius. "We have learned much that concerns you. For many lives of men you have guided the world, preventing disaster, doing what is right based upon the Prophecy formed by the Sidereals so long ago. A Prophecy that you thought at the time you alone had anticipated and that you alone were acting upon. It has come to our attention that others have acted to stave disaster. They were Solars and they have made the ultimate sacrifice. Today they are known as the Deathlords."

"The Deathlords have taken upon themselves the taint of the Yozis," says Gallius. "A taint that stands outside Fate itself. At the very moment the Great Contagion was unleashed, you felt your plans nearly shatter, did you not? All those plans and plots were nearly destroyed. Or so you indeed would have thought. After all, who would expect that the very source of so much terror could be used against the coming doom of Creation? Who would suspect that Solars would themselves see a dark fate coming and do, as you have, the ugly but necessary task required of them. Creation has been altered by those who stand outside of Fate. The Prophecy therefore is also altered."

The Sidereal listens to this patiently, showing no sign or reaction. And at the end of the recitation, he makes only one reply. "Is that what you believe?"

"I do," says Gallius. "It is said that all the knowledge stored in every library in Creation is outmatched by what you know, Steersman. And yet you did not see the Contagion coming until it was upon you. Unless you wish for us to believe that you had planned that, as well?" She rather doubts he would try to weave that weak a web. "The question is then what will you do. If our paths continue, Chejop Kejak, it will be open war. Solars shall kill Sidereals and Sidereals shall kill Solars. But it will be worse still, for your own kind shall be divided, for the future will tear your truces apart. The Prophecy you have seen is thwarted and warped. Your own actions may well lead to the destruction you have fought so long to prevent."

The ancient Sidereal listens to this. "Who told you this," he asks curiously.

"A wise friend who knows many things that are hidden," answers Gallius. "Who is less important than the fact that I believe him. It is less important than the fact that his knowledge of Deathlords is enough to send them flying in terror for even a rumor that he has shared what he knows."

"And who would never lie, and who freely gives out such portentious news as this, I suppose?" Chejop asks, sounding reasonable.

"If you wish to forever cast in doubt what news you are brought, so be it," says Gallius. "Have you anything else to say? I would suggest you be cautious. This is a war you will not survive. The tide of Fate roars against the old ways of the Bronze Faction. The will of Helios is clear. His children shall rise and claim Creation once more. Chejop Kejak is wise and powerful. But even he is no match for the Unconquered Sun."

"Your words may as well have been written for you by the Emissary," the Sidereal answers, gravely. "Put aside your passion for a moment, and _think_. What does he stand to gain?"

"Much," replies Ramar, simply enough. He asks, "Despite this, is there a chance the Prophecy could be in error? Is there a chance to avoid darkness and stagnation?"

"All prophecy can change over time," Chejop answers, sounding more weary, less patient. "What have you come for? To spit in my face, and flaunt your own superiority? I have no time for that. To tell me some rumor of the Deathlords, which we have already heard?" He glances at the robed figure hovering next to him, and continues. "The leader of Nexus. Who is he the Emissary _of_? Think. Think, before you come to me with an explanation that flatters your egos."

"I came to suggest you check fate once more," replies Gallius. "Work a prophecy as you did before and find out if things have changed. I suspect they have. Do you really think Helios would choose this time for us if it would destroy Creation?"

"Withdraw your threat of war against us, cease meddling in affairs that destroy the hard work we have engaged in, do not anger the Realm into starting a war we must do whatever we can to avert, and we will have time for such things," replies Chejop, tiredly. "Are you willing to do that?"

"A war between Exalts benefits none who would serve Creation." Ramar considers Chejop and Gallius, sighing inwardly, though his face remains as calm as can be. "We should be working together, learning from each other, changing the world, leading it away from darkness. Not fighting. Not like this."

Davron simply remains quiet, in his turn. If his opinion were followed, this confrontation would have been postponed, until arguments could be marshaled, evidence collected, until the truth of the Deathlords and their plan for Fate would be plain to anyone willing to consider it, no matter how wise, proud, or skeptical. But then, he was never driven to be the voice crying in the wilderness.

"I am but one Solar," answers Gallius, "Not the entire Deliberative personified in one person. How can I cease meddling in affairs when I do not even know what those might be? If those affairs involve the killing of my kind, there will be war in the end. I did not invite your Wyld Hunters to come and try to kill me, but if they come again, I will destroy them." She frowns and thinks for a moment. "Now, how much time do you need? If we can hammer into shape something of a truce, I will do what I can to see it done. I have no idea how we will hold the Lunars in check, but we do have one wild card to play. They are reluctant to trust the Sidereals, since you tried to kill every one of them, as you did with the Solars, but there is hope we may still hold them in check, as we have in the past."

"Such a prophecy would require ninety-nine days to complete, and must end the moment Calibration begins," answers Chejop. "I do not assume you speak for all Solars, but nor have all Solars come to meet me and threatened war against Heaven's Chosen," he adds dryly. "This arrangement is between us."

"It is not a threat," says Gallius. "If things do not change, it is nothing more than an observation of what absolutely will occur. You must kill us to save Creation in your view. We must live to save Creation in our view. They are not compatible." Gallius nods to Chejop, "You will have your ninety-nine days. My circle will not raise its hand against to enrage the Realm. We will expand eastward and southward, away from the Realm, and avoid open conflict with Realm allies around Harborhead. I think the efforts of the Lunars may also slow down, but we will see."

---

Outside the House of Ivory, Chi-Yosh turns to the Circle. "I am soon to finish my Art. But its completion is only the first step, and the next I can reach requires the assistance of a Sidereal master." For a few moments, he lets this sit, glancing at the Master. "And, on the same discussion of help from the Sidereals, what further help can we gain from the Gold?"

"Whatever those of the Gold Faction choose to give," is the Master's answer. "They are no more bound by regulation than you of the 'Lunar Friends Faction' of Solars are."

Chi-Yosh can't hide his chuckle. "That is a fair enough answer." Parting from the Circle, he makes his way down the avenue. Not far from the Division of Secrets is the Crimson Panoply of Victory, the Division of Battles. Past doors which are nothing but great draping banners held by statues of Celestial Warriors is a hexagonial room. At each wall is a door, and each corner is made a shelf with tomes. In the center rests a stone pillar, upon which a checkered board rests. On one side of the board, parchment and scrollwork with characters of many languages has been wrapped around some frame, giving it an all to humanoid shape. Where a face would be are letters that resemble eyes, nose and mouth, while individual characters and punctuations create lines and features of a face. On the other side, a woman who's complexion matches her opponent; weathered, dry, and baring the signs of wisdom through the ages.

They play a game, one of carved figurines of crystal, their faucets too numerous to count.. And as Chi-Yosh stands patiently beside the board, he takes to scrutinizing one of the pieces. Each faucet leads to a different scene, of men in armor or animal skins, or the Fae in their wondrous lies, battling away. As one of the players touches a piece, their head tilts, time seeming to drain away in their stillness, before a calculated move sets a whole pattern of moves from each of the players.

It does seem like time loses meaning as the game continues, for Chi-Yosh cannot recall how long he stands watching the game unfold, until the woman places a crystal piece with a trident into the same space as her opponent's scepter wielder. After a time of analyzing the placement, his head nods, the paper crinkling to give an expression to his written mouth. "Good game," says the woman as her opponent rises, and she turns to Chi-Yosh.

Chi-Yosh gives a bow to the match's winner. "Here in the house of victory, I seek one who is apt in the ancient arts of the Battle Maiden. Tales tell of those who's power dwarfs that of any celestial form of body discipline and weaponry. Where might I find one knowledgable in such?"

"You seek the Spider," the other replies.

Chi-Yosh says, "Thank you. Where does my search for Spider begin?"

"With me," says a voice. Chi-Yosh turns, to see its owner. The man he beholds is dressed simply, in the robes of any itinerant monk. His feet are bare; his head is as well. He could be a man of forty in Creation. He could, in fact, be anyone on the road.

Chi-Yosh turns to the speaker, and acknowledges him with the tilt of a head. Stepping closer to the monk, "I am Chi-Yosh of the Su'Katan. What is the name of he that is the first step in my search?"

"I am the Spider," the simple monk replies with a faint smile.

Chi-Yosh glances from Spider to the woman. "Short search," he observes to her, before returning his attention to the monk. "I seek the next level of training. To reach into the stars and seek to begin understanding the complexities of the Arts. Are you one who would be willing to show me?"

"Attack me," suggests the monk, sounding rather casual about it. "Don't hold back."

Chi-Yosh pauses for a moment. Perhaps this is in itself a test. He does not know the specifics to Heaven's laws. To asault one is illegal, but what if it is requested? This in itself may be a lesson, to see if he is rational or not, disciplined or not. Or it may simply be a request.

Seeing this, the Spider clicks his tongue. "For the sake of the art, you must obey your master in all things," he commands crisply. "If your master commands you to walk to Malfeas, you must do that. If he commands that you strike the Maidens themselves, you must do that. Have you come seeking a _sifu_ or not?"

"Indeed," replies Chi-Yosh. "And I will do so as my master requests." Taking this to mean that the Sidereal has agreed, but well aware that this could also be a ploy to illicit a response, the Dawnr reacts to the former. A simple motion of snapping his left arm crosswise towards his shoulder. The motion is harmless, an eye-catching maneuver as well as an impromptu guard. The real threat comes from the right hand, which unfurls like coiled lightning, the heel of the palm lancing in an arch towards Spider's sternum.

In a moment the Sidereal is everywhere at once, and Chi-Yosh can see five or six after-images of him. He can feel eight fists strike his sternum at once, and has he doubles over, coughing blood, the voice of the Spider is behind him. The Sidereal is stern and reproving. "I said don't hold back."

Chi-Yosh's air has returned, but still he rests on the floor, gaining his strength. One knee raises to begin planting foot to the floor, but the motion is in an instant aided by the rush of Essence. It bursts through him, into the ground as the foot slams, power radiating outward as he pushes up and pivots in a tight corkscrew. Rather than upper cut, the Dawn's body bows backwards, his spine snapping back to deny a target, as up comes the free knee into the path of Spider's stomach.

The monk's hands are a flash of lightning in a darkened sky. As Chi-Yosh moves, he can see what the man is doing: actually drawing out glowing filaments of Essence from the bonfire erupting from the Solar's body, and snapping them as they extend. He is literally counterattacking the energies of Chi-Yosh's Combo. All that's left is the merely physical moves, which he parries effectively if not effortlessly.

"Good," says the Spider, drawing back and holding up a hand to forestall further attacks. "Mantis Style. Taught by a spirit of the East."

Chi-Yosh sways a little. The force exerted by his attack had been stolen, despite his brace for it; it leaves teh dawn a little off balance. "Yes. You can tell the signature of the teachers? Or do you know those who can teach it?"

"You will learn that, if I accept you," the Spider responds calmly. "Now. Why should I?"

"Because weither you are of the Gold, the Bronze, or no fanction at all, you know like all of your brothers and sisters what the Solars had done in the past, and you do not wish to see it happen again," replies Chi-Yosh. "While the forebarers of my Spark may have known the Arts you perform, I believe that there is knowledge in its discipline which would help stop my Fate from winding down thier path. Perhaps it is that I know where their history ended, or that I will discover something in humble consideration that they had over looked. Or that they did not have the Spider as their teacher."

The Spider considers this for a moment, then reaches out with a hand. "Seek me out again when you are sure," he says, almost gently, and the look in his star-filled eyes conveys that he means what he says. "When you really know why you are looking for what you ask from me."

Chi-Yosh accepts the hand in a simple shake. "Yes, Spider," is the Dawn's only reply. He is left to contimplate that request. For he spoke mistruth; the Solar knows little of Sidereal Martial Arts. It's possible there may be the knowledge somewhere, a discipline and understanding beyond the Exalt that may help hold back the dark reoccurrence of his forebarers. Or maybe not. With a farewell nod to the monk, Chi-Yosh turns, and draws through the banner doors.

---

Gallius has still more to do after her visit to Yu-Shan, and must make her way to the land of Harborhead. She does not come to speak to Ma-Ha-Suchi, however. That affair will simply have to wait a little longer. She has no time to heal wounds. The exalt she seeks is Koriko, a fellow Solar of the Zenith Caste and leader of the Brides of Ahlat.

The meeting is stiffly formal. At least at the start. Koriko's resentment of Gallius is all too clear. The Nation's Queen is here to remedy that, however. She tells Koriko of her plans for the Nation of the Sun and cautiously feels-out the other woman's reaction. The fiercely proud woman of Harborhead makes it quite clear that while she appreciates the efforts being made, she is going to take no part.

Still, Gallius has a duty to uphold, whether Koriko sees her as friend or not. She also has an apology of sorts to be made. In the Kingdom of Roleyn, when one man harms another accidentally and wishes to bring some peaceful resolution to the matter, he will give a gift that is dear to him to prevent further problems and in the hope that instead of an enemy, he will have made a friend. Though similar things are done elsewhere in Creation, in Roleyn and among the Marukan, this is a very serious and formal matter.

No matter how far her throne may be from Roleyn, Gallius will always be the daughter of that land, even if the Unconquered Sun adopted her. She understands the wrath of Koriko and has not come to her with empty hands. And so Gallius gives her fellow Zenith a gift of great value. Indeed, it is among the most precious of things she owes. Friends of beasts that the Roleyn people are, the first horse they are given as adults is of tremendous value, both in terms of cost and in terms of emotional ties. When Gallius presents Koriko with Wingfoot, it is with a smile and more than a bit of an ache. Little things come to her mind, misadventures and long walks beside her friend. Shared rides with Casus, as well. Still, Koriko is a worthy owner, and Gallius wishes to lay the foundation for the future.

The impact of the gift is fitting. It seems that Koriko is not unaware of the custom, and she even seems to grasp in a way how much the gift means to the one giving it. Gallius tells Koriko to take care of her steed, and also gives a few pointers on the somewhat curious tending of a winged horse. After some brief instruction, Koriko takes to the sky for the first time on Wingfoot and proves quite skilled in the air. It is with a heart both saddened and pleased that Gallius turns her mind to the north, where she must go to see another Solar. She wonders what Yurgen has achieved in the time she's been away.

---

The final force that Gallius seeks to contact is that of Yurgen Kaneko, leader of the only other Solar Circle she has encountered. Going with those who are willing, the Queen of the Nation of the sun makes her way to the north. Hopefully she will find Yurgen has done well since their last meeting. Even if his ways are different than her own, it is a comfort to the Zenith that her circle is not the only one in Creation.

The City of Bone and Brass is bustling with activity. Yurgen has expanded himself since the Solars were last here, and the irrascible old man comes stumping out of his long-house himself, accompanied by an attractive woman in a dingy cloak, and two others: a young woman with sandy brown hair and a blue dress, and a tall and powerful-looking fellow with distinctive tattoos over his body and impossibly bulging muscles.

The others are notable in their own ways. The first is a young woman Gallius remembers seeing in a vision granted to her by Helios. The second is a Lunar Exalt, or at least someone who can convincingly portray one. "Ho! You soft southerly types!" hails Yurgen. The cloaked woman manages a faint smile unseen by the brash chieftain. "Come to make war on me, eh? Pillage my settlement, rout my mammoths, and make off with my treasures?" He opens his lips, showing teeth, apparently vastly amused by the notion. "Come share my hospitality before all that."

Davron laughs. "Perhaps we're just here to pillage your drink," he says, grinning. After the formal and intricate and stuffy dealings in Yu-Shan, it's a positive relief to be in company like this.

Gallius smiles at Yurgen's words, bowing to him. She is still considering the events of Yu-Shan. Failures, in her mind, as anything less than a full success is. "Thank you for your hospitality," she says. "It seems you have done well here in the middle of nowhere. Tell me, is it ever comfortable in the north?" She can't help but poke a little fun back at the man.

"Well, come in, come in," Yurgen invites, and the Solars join him and his allies in filing into the long-house he uses as his drinking-hall and planning area. "We hear things about your Nation, even up here," he adds, once inside. "Now, let me show you comfort!" A serving-girl approaches the table bearing a dozen steins of a richly brown-gold liquid, all balanced on a platter. Yurgen passes these around, announces them to be "Mammoth piss!" and eagerly begins to chug down his drink.

"Mammoth piss, hmm?" Gallius muses. She sniffs at the drink, "Well, it smells better than you, anyway," she says, then starts to drink. "Oh, so the notorious Anathema Nation is whispered of even this far north, hmm? I imagine they probably say we're twelve feet tall and we drink the blood of children."

"Eleven," quips Yurgen over the rim of his stein. His fellows smile at each other, and the cloaked woman waves a hand gently at herself and the others, in turn. "I am Samea the Sorceress," she says. "This is Kahime, of the Northwest" -- the girl in the blue dress -- "and Hellspike of the Sons of Sin tribe, northeast of here."

Davron stares dubiously at his drink, then shrugs. "Well, it's gotta beat the yeddim piss we get out East," he says, before chugging a mouthful - then coughing and wiping his mouth with his sleeve. He never was a big boozer, and he looks rather silly trying.

Chi-Yosh takes a healthy drink from the mug, well aware of Yurgen's humor. "Funny. We don't hear much of the City of Bone and Brass. If you are strong and steady, maybe we'll hear something soon, hey?"

There's something to be said for the effect words can have on a person. Ramar studies his drink, curiously, smelling it as though he's afraid it might in fact bite him. "Mm. Yes, well, there may be some truth to that." He considers, "Though I've never really imbibed urine."

Having finished his drink, Yurgen lets out a belch. "You haven't heard of us because we are still preparing, you young whelp," he slurs. "Our name will be known when we are ready!"

Gallius nods to those who are introduced. She turns back to Yurgen, though her attention is also very much on Samea. "Is this place protected against prying ears?" she asks. "I have some news you may be interested in, but I don't wish our enemies to hear of it."

Gallius notes Yurgen's eyes flashing to Samea automatically. It seems he is wise enough to defer to Samea in such matters. And in answer she looks earthward, then makes eye contact with him again. "Well, we've had something to show off to you lazy southern folk for awhile," he grins, then jerks a thumb at the door. "And we can talk about whatever you have down there, eh?"

---

The subterranean chamber was reached via a well-hidden tunnel in the back of one of the outlying long-houses. The Solars can see nothing, for the chamber is pitch-black. "Light," orders Yurgen's voice, and Samea can be heard incanting a series of syllables. A burst of flame sparkles from her hands, leaping from outstretched fingers to take up residence on a bracketed torch on one wall. And now the Circle can see what Yurgen has hidden away.

"You people don't know that ships won't float on lakes when they're broken, do you," Yurgen says, sounding full of pride. "I had to make a proper ship for you, just so you could go sailing properly in our beautiful land here." And before them, at the center of the room, is a massive construct of wood, brass, ivory and glass. Whalebone struts and mammoth tusks; brass railings and steel-armored hull; a tanned hide sail and intricate portholes made from a sea-dragon's hemispherical eye-shield.

"The airship engine is inside," adds the woman called Kahime, perhaps unnecessarily. "It's fully functional."

Gallius raises her eyebrows. "You made this for us?" she asks. "And here I had come to offer to have our people build a ship for you using that lost engine.." She laughs softly and shakes her head, "Not that I'll be upset to have an airship again. In fact, another airship is part of the reason we have come here."

Davron folds his arms, nodding appreciatively - and not without jealousy. "Very nice. _Very_ nice..." he says. "It reminds me how long it's been since I've had a chance to work in my own workshop..."

"Well, I couldn't trust you lot to do it right," says Yurgen, still in that haughty, teasing tone. But Gallius can feel the undercurrent of the man's words, like a silent whisper in her ear: _We are neither rustics nor fools, and our pride is important to us._

"Now, observe," says Samea, murmuring again in Old Realm. She whispers a harsh incantation, and a black shadow begins to emerge from the ground. The light flickers and dims. "Rizikuvion, the Silent Shadow, wards this place. You may speak of the other matter."

"Wow..." Ramar can find no other words just yet. He approaches the airship, holding a hand out to it. He spends a silent moment or two studying it, unable to draw his eyes away, until the ward is enacted, then he turns to listen.

Gallius laughs. "Well, if you think we are fools, the rest of my tale may well have you saying worse things yet." And here Gallius tells Yurgen about the trip to the Well of Udr. About coming face to face with a Deathlord and entering the Well of Udr. She speaks of the journey there in brief. Finally, in the end, she can see the unspoken question in the eyes of Yurgen and his circle. "You want to know why we have gone through so much and strove so hard, I imagine." Here Gallius meets each of their eyes in turn, holding their gaze before she finally turns her full attention back to Yurgen. "We are going to find the Book of Three Circles. When we succeed, we will want to have as many as are able to make use of the Third Circle to study it."

Samea's glassy gaze reveals that she understands the full import of this message. The Lunar, Hellspike, even betrays a sign of fear. Kahime and Yurgen seem less impressed - or less informed. "Well," the Icewalker says, after digesting this news, "that must be one big, special book."

Davron says dryly, "It's so big and special, they had to split it into three volumes."

Davron then blinks, and sighs. "It's been a long few months," he says. "Journeying in strange lands where the Exalted do not belong, to learn how we might find the Book... but that's no excuse for being flippant."

Samea shakes her head, resting a hand on her Circlemate's shoulder, and for a few minutes they exchange quiet words, occasionally including Kahime in the discussion. She is conveying the importance of this work to Yurgen, and he is certainly not slow in understanding that a source of considerable power is at stake.

"Alright then," grunts Yurgen. "I don't suppose you're just offering us access to this thing for free."

"Actually," says Gallius, "That is essentially what I'm offering. One circle of Solars can't possibly survive very long on their own. We need each other, Yurgen." She smiles and repeats, "I believe we will need each other for a very long time yet. And besides, the book is of little use if its knowledge is not put in the hand of able sorcerors."

The man smiles, and sticks out a hand. "Well then, let's talk about what we can do for each other to get that Book," he says with a sharklike grin.

Gallius clasps Yurgen's hand, hoping he doesn't plan on squeezing with all his strength. The man likely thinks she's made of jade. "As you might guess from our story, the airship we left by the Well of Udr is missing. We think it may be in the hands of Abyssals. We are going to get it back, and then continue seeking the Book. It seems you have an airship here already, which would make it quite easy to launch an attack on our old ship. I am not comfortable with the thought of having it in Deathlord hands." The Lady grins, "You feel like putting down a few thieves?"
