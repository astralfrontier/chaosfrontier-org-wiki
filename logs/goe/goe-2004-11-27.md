# Gods of Eden 2004-11-27

After the circle returns from Yu-Shan, the usual day to day is restored. Only in the back of everyone's mind the task to come remains. The pursuit of the Book must continue, the plan to face down the Abyssals and retake the lost airship, and what must follow. There's a feeling of anticipation even among those who don't really know what is happening. Soldiers drill harder, merchants stay open later, the hammers of smiths drag on into the night, tapping out the late seconds when the only light that remains comes from candles, the moon, and the harsh glow of heated metal. It is in this night hour that Gallius walks about the new wall that is taking shape about Bridal Veil, admiring the skillful work of her people.

It is at this late hour that Ramar is perched not too far from the new wall. His eyes are fixated skyward, as though reading the heavens themselves. Or perhaps he's focused on some distant, far away land that only his eyes can discern. It takes him a moment to realize that someone else is present, a moment more to notice it's Gallius. He chuckles, "Lady Gallius... I... hello there. I didn't notice you walking along, er."

"You were dreaming again, hmm?" replies Gallius. For once, she has let her hair flow loose, the braids undone so the wind can catch her locks and the light of Luna above can turn them silver. "It is a night for dreams, though, isn't it? There's something in the air that is relaxing, as of late."

"Mmhmm. Dreaming again, of things to come." Ramar smiles at Gallius, turning his gaze to the stars once more, perhaps a little more hurried than is necessary. "I believe that it is the calm before the storm. Much to be done you know, and yet, it's nice to take some time to dream, to let the mind wander and troubles wane. You know?"

"I suppose it is," answers Gallius. "Dreams have their purpose. But what dream were you having tonight, Ramar?" she asks. She turns her eyes to the moon, studying the seemingly perfect disc as a cloud begins to stretch over it like an extending claw.

Ramar watches the cloud cover the moon, pausing as the sky grows darker. "Many a dream I was having tonight. Of places that I've not yet been to, of things that must be done... of finding a quiet place with a river that bubbles over stones and a warm hearth and snow outside the window." He chuckles "And of marriage." A pause. Almost too long. "Er. That is to say," almost too fast, "Marriage between spirits. Er."

Gallius arches an eyebrow and turns to face Ramar, smiling at him. "Marriage is a fine thing. Something that is precious to everyone." She laughs softly and adds, "Even to such things as.. spirits. But you seem rather nervous about bringing this up. Is someone getting married?"

"I didn't me... oh wait... ahem. Nevermind." A bit of relief is in Ramar's eyes. He draws in a breath, and then another. He smiles back at Gallius, "Quite precious, I should think, I should hope. Yes. Er, I'm not all that nervous really," and by this time, he doesn't seem to be all that nervous. After all, what's to be nervous about when talking about spirits being married? Certainly he wasn't thinking about anything else. "No one is being married... yet. Although I have been thinking of finding a mate. For my sword. A marriage of spirits to share power, such as it is, and perhaps enable me to be of more, or even any use in the battles to come."

"So you are looking for a likely candidate," says Gallius. "Well, what kind of spirit does your blade wish for?" she asks seriously. She won't comment on how odd it seems to try to marry a sword off. Still, she's arranged marriages in harder conditions than this!

"I'm not sure. I ought to ask the spirit of the blade what it thinks... although it seems a rather odd thing to do, you know?" Ramar shrugs, "Or perhaps it's just me."

"Everything is lonely, Ramar. Even a sword, I imagine, longs for some kind of companionship," suggests Gallius. "And you ought to ask the blade for its opinion, don't you think?"

"I suppose I ought to." Ramar considers, "Would you accompany me in doing so? It might help to have a Zenith along, especially if there's a ceremony to be performed. And er... as I understand it, you've had some experience in arranging marriages before."

Gallius laughs softly and nods, "I have. And if there is a marriage ceremony to be performed, I can carry it out for those involved, if they are willing to make their pledge before me."

Ramar smiles with relief. "Good. Then, I believe the first step is calling up Swift South Wind." He stands, and strolls along lazily towards his room.

Gallius follows, humming softly as she goes, and in her steps the grass grows where it was brown before as the power of hearthstone draws life to it once more. She only stops when the keep is back in view. Here everything is already quite alive.

A space is cleared within Ramar's room, and the sword placed in the center. The Solar pauses a moment, tracing lines along the ground rather methodically with the tip of the Daiklave. While calling to the spirit, Swift South Wind, he removes the Hearthstone from his neck, and places it atop the sword. The windows blow open then, and the sword balances on it's point, hovering straight up. The Spirit comes into being moments later. "Yes?"

Gallius watches Ramar's occult workings in silence. When the windows blow open she spares a glance just to make sure there are no ugly surprises before looking back to the blade and Ramar. She'll let him do the introductions, she thinks.

The spirit that rises from the weapon looks like a sand-blasted image of a soldier wearing a black iron helmet and red turban, and red robes beneath a black chainmail hauberk. Its beard is the dusky grey of twilight, forming a sharply-tipped goatee, and its eyes are blue oases on a face that's pale and parched like the sands of the South. It lowers itself respectfully to one knee, for the sword is the subordinate of its wielder and obeys his commands as any loyal soldier would.

"Swift South Wind, rise." Ramar regards the spirit of his weapon curiously, almost as a craftsman would inspect his finest work, or a general his finest warrior. He turns to Gallius, "This is Lady Gallius, chosen of the Unconquered Sun." He then nods, "And this is Swift South Wind." He explains the situation to the Spirit, ending with his decision that it should be married to another spirit, and the reasons for doing so. "What say you?"

"If it is your command, my lord," the weapon-spirit responds promptly, inclining his head in respect. "I will honor whatever arrangement you set for me." And from this Ramar recalls how common arranged marriages were in the times he now remembers more clearly. In the past, marriages were made from necessity, and love was something that grew between the married partners at its own pace. In the modern age, it seems, people are so eager to rush into the consummation of their feelings that they have forgotten what real love is. The spirit of this blade, it seems, has traditionalist tastes.

Gallius bows to the spirit as she is introduced, then allows Ramar to explain his desires to the blade. It's answer reminds her of the union with Ma-Ha-Suchi. A traditional arrangment in which there was never anything she would recognize as love. She considers Ramar for a time, then, "Well, it seems that all we will need to do is find a fitting bride."

Ramar nods, "Indeed." He looks towards Gallius, then towards Swift South Wind. "But how do we determine what would make a fitting bride?"

The spirit continues to abase itself, as it replies. "If you seek power, my lord, seek a spirit of power. An elemental, for example."

"It seems that it's a matter of bringing benefits to each," suggests Gallius. "And one that will share interests, you might say. It would hardly do to find a spirit of healing."

"I see." Ramar is lost in thought for a moment, "Thank you, Swift South Wind, Lady Gallius. We'll need to find an Elemental then."

Gallius nods, "Whatever we find, it must be interested in war. It wouldn't hurt if it had some anger to work out on any foes you might find." She grins a little at this notion. "You need an elemental with a bone to pick, I guess."

And so the Great Search begins. The Volos bear Ramar and Gallius swiftly through the air, over Creation until they come to a towering mountain at the edge of the Desert. Here the wind blows strongly as they dive downwards, and are warmed by a tiny red dot that grows as they descend, into the mouth of a volcano. The fire roils inside, almost as though it's sensing the Exalted's approach.

Gallius follows Ramar on his search, letting him lead the way as her mind drifts, considering and reconsidering things again and again. What is coming and what has passed. The questions she's faced since being Exalted never seem to have any answers.

They land at the edge of the volcano, standing on the stone ledge that rings the white-hot lava within. Sweat, which before had beaded on Ramar's head now streams down his face, and he calls out to the volcano itself, his voice rising high above the roiling fire, echoing off the stone and resonating with the power of the Exalted. His Caste Mark burns brighter than the lava itself, suffusing his body with Essence, warding away the harm of the fire... then there's a sudden swell and he falls, sinking down, down, down within the firey depths.

The lava threatens to burn away the Solar, to crush him, to smother him, but Ramar does not heed such threats. He sinks down, travelling through ancient tunnels made when the world was new, until he reaches the heart of the volcano, a platform of stone surrounded by the white-hot lava that threatens to erupt outwards at a moment's notice.

The Lava coalesces then, pulling away from Ramar when he cannot be burned. Instead, the Heart of the Volcano twists itself into a different shape, fire burning and flowing and shaping into a room that surrounds the stone. "Greetings, Prince of Earth," calls a voice. A voice the sound of rocks burning into liquid, a voice the sound of ashes and heat.

The Solar calls to the spirit, his Caste Mark now leaking through his Anima, causing a slow flicker of Essence to burn around his body, a Lava all his own. "Greetings," Ramar says, "I have come bearing a proposal for you..." He explains his situation, "If you wish, I offer you the chance to move beyond this firey realm, the chance to turn towards the outside world, to grow into something more than you have yet become. I offer you the chance to reforge yourself with steel and gold." His voice grows more resonant as he speaks, his words accented by his voice, almost a hammer on a blade. He tells of the Abyssals, and the upcoming battle, and the great and heroic deeds that will await, of the destiny that may lie ahead.

The voice of the volcano's inhabitant resonates softly through the tumult of lava that swirls and gurgles in this, one of the furnaces of Creation itself. "I am Nalya, the Erupting Torrent," it says. "For long years have I waited to pour forth my heart. I will marry this warrior of yours, and come forth in all my power at long last."

And so Ramar emerges from the lava with a companion: a red-skinned woman with flaming locks, clad in a molten dress. She's surrounded by a shimmering wave of heat, and her eyes are glowing orbs of white-hot intensity. Gallius watches as the elemental sheds some of its fiery aura in order not to harm those around it. Now all that remains is the ceremony.

---

The Zenith caste considers the 'bride' and nods her satisfaction. She leads the way in silence to a place that suits the purpose. It is, fittingly enough, the highest in a series of pyramids that she noticed on the way to the volcano. Once this would have served as an altar to Helios, and one gets the feeling that only recently was it unburied, the dune that held it dispersed by the mighty winds of the desert.

Once this place is reached, Gallius turns to face Ramar and the elemental Nalya, and her voice rises in a thundering boom. "WHO COMES BEFORE THE EYES OF HELIOS?" Upon her brow the sign of the Zenith glows, and even as she raises her voice the sky begins to light with the first rays of the rising sun.

"I am Ramar," states the Solar, whose Caste Mark still burns brightly, especially in this altar to the Sun. The spirit then speaks, "I am Swift South Wind," and then the elemental, "I am Nalya, the Erupting Torrent." Then Ramar stands forward, "We have come before the Unconquered Sun to wed Swift South Wind and Nalya the Erupting Torrent, joining fire and blade together..."

The Priestess then looks at the two who would be wed. "You would join the fire of the earth and the fire of the sun into one? Such a thing cannot be forged by words alone." And here the Zenith raises the naginata Midmorning Sakura. "The binding must be come in battle." As the sun swells over the horizon the Unconquered Sun's Priestess attacks, lashing out at those who have come to her. Swift South Wind meets her thrusts in desperate parries carried-out with the skill of Ramar, and Nalya blocks each strike, a shower of sparks erupting from every blow. "Those who would bind for strength must bind in strength," says Gallius, whose voice has turned harsh as the glaring light of Helios.

As the battle goes on, the strength of the Zenith is telling, and the would-be wedding party finds itself more and more harried. "If it be your will to be one," says Gallius, "Than the time of joining is upon you!" And the very ground groans and the temple shakes under her feet. The Zenith glitters with a brilliant light as she draws her essence into an incredible burst of power, one which neither force could by itself withstand.

For a moment, the very fate of things hangs in the balance, but the ticking of the clock suddenly ceases, and words flow from both the spirit and the elemental. "We have come as two," they say calmly. "But by the Eye of Helios we are now one." And the elemental that was Nelya and the sword that was Swift South Wind are no more. What remains is a greater weapon that is far more than the sum of its parts, and when that moment finally ends, the potent attack of the Sun God's Warrior Priestess is met in a potent block. "The will of Helios is done," says Gallius, and she steps slowly back, raising her hands to the Sun God.

The Solar stands then, holding his blade up, catching the light of the Unconquered Sun with it, neither hands or blade faltering as he brings it down, saluting the Priestess. Blood marks his face where wounds were gifted, though the injuries have been burned away, and he stands now, holding the Daiklave in his hand. He speaks, and when he speaks his voice is not the only one that can be heard in the air. "We are joined, by the will of the Sun and the Chosen, Princess of Earth."

"You are joined," answers Gallius, and the voice now is her own once more. "A new dawn is rising, and in your hands the Wedded shall help bring it to pass." Above her the lion of her anima glows, but it only basks in the sun, eyes seemingly half-lidded. "It will be a time of adjustment for them. Only in doing what they are meant to do can their true strength be revealed. There shall be no lack of opportunities."

"Together," the three-as-one voice sounds throughout the top of the pyramid, "We shall discover our strength, we shall do great things. You honor us, Pillar of Heaven."

"Walk now through the desert and return to me when the sun has risen to its zenith. Then we shall go back to the Nation of the Sun," says Gallius. "And heed what you see in the sands as you go, for not all sand visions are mere flights of fancy. Go now. I shall wait for you to return."
