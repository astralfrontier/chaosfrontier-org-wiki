# Gods of Eden 2004-11-28

With the assistance of his companions, most notably Chi-Yosh who has visited here once before, Davron makes his way through the mind-boggling bustle that is Yu-Shan to the ornate offices of the Shogun of Exaltation. The nightmares have only become more pressing since his return to Creation, and Davron feels that, sooner or later, he will find himself acting on them in his waking life - unless he can resolve the conflict within him by other means.

Davron addresses the spirits guarding the entrance with the appropriate pleasantries, then conveys his business: "I am Davron, Exalted of the Unconquered Sun, and I seek guidance from the Shogun on the relationship between myself and my Spark, which grows increasingly troublesome of late." Lytek is a busy god, as Davron knows well, but perhaps this request will pique his curiosity.

The office of Lytek, the god of the Exaltation itself, is always a quiet one. Gold-tufted birds preen themselves in ornately-crafted cages. Multicolored plumage and the occasional squawking come from other, slightly smaller cages nearby. The office is expansive and artistically appointed, and off in one corner is the desk at which the god sometimes works. "Welcome, welcome," the shining spirit says in pleasant tones. With a wave of bejeweled fingers he indicates a plush chair. "Sit, and be comfortable."

Davron cannot help but appreciate the decor with his artist's eye, but even doing so reminds him of his errand, and he takes the offered seat. "Ever since my Exaltation," Davron explains, "I have been plagued with dreams - nightmares, in my opinion. Always they involve a powerful presence waging war, not out of grim necessity but in exultation at the destructive power he commands. And in my dreams, that presence is me." The Exalt rubs his forehead, his expression troubled.

Lytek sits forward, folding his fingers together and looking more interested. "Past memories, eh?" he suggests with a smile. "Yes, tell me - are they vivid? Like life?"

"Extraordinarily vivid," Davron agrees. "But I don't think all of them are past memories. Some certainly are, as when I command sorceries I don't recall, or engines of war I have never seen. But other times they are memories from _this_ life - only accompanied by that delight in killing, and not the grief I recall feeling at the time."

"Interesting," the god muses. "A bleed-over of past attitudes to current memories?" He drums his fingers on the desk, humming. "So.. the partition wall is weaker in your case."

Davron's brow furrows. "Partition wall?" he asks, both troubled and curious.

From a drawer, Lytek removes a long scroll-case and uncaps it, then unfurls its contents across the desk's surface. What he demonstrates might well be the map of a continent or island: it has lines, boundaries, notations, and ultimately a border separating the whole thing from whatever is beyond the map. Davron, however, recognizes the magical significance of the sub-diagrams and writing. What he is looking at is a magical system of enormous complexity, something beyond anything he has ever thought to design. "Here, you see.." Lytek's long fingertip stabs down, indicating the barrier between two of the 'cells'. "The partition wall. One spark, many lives.. the wall divides one life from another while allowing them all to share in the power."

Davron nods. "Ahh," he says. "So one of the lives that bore my Spark is in one cell, but his desires and attitudes are... seeping through the barrier and into my own mind." Davron frowns. "And what will happen if the partition weakens further? Will his personality take me over?"

"Of course," replies Lytek, sounding as though this was the most natural thing in the world.

Davron grimaces at this diagnosis. "Can anything be done about this? Can the partition wall be repaired? Or can that cell be somehow... excised?"

This takes the god aback rather visibly. "You want to... if I understand you, you want to meddle with your Exaltation?" His hurt and fearful tone carries with it the same qualities of an Immaculate monk discussing a heretic. "Only the Great Artificer himself is capable of that."

Davron subsides in his chair, rubbing his forehead. "I don't _want_ to, my lord. But if I do not... I already have some idea of what awaits me, if I allow nature to take its course. The man I know myself to be would be gone forever, to be replaced by the sort of mind I've strove against all my life..." He sighs. "I suppose you don't view that prospect the way I do, of course."

"Of course not," says Lytek reprovingly. "You should let these things run their course. This is your fate, young man. Face it with dignity. Don't go meddling in such dangerous things."

Davron nods slowly... then shakes his head. "If it were only for my own sake, Lytek, I might be able to take your advice. But should my former self take over my mind, he will also reclaim the power of the Exaltation. And... I fear it is because of people like _him_ that the Usurpation occurred. The Bronze Faction slew Solars like him once before - if I cannot be rid of him, I'd as soon save them the bother of doing it again."

"But.. " The god raises a hand, then lowers it again. "Well, if you insist on such foolishness, you must have already realized where you must go to accomplish it. But I think you will be wiser than that."

Davron nods. "I don't know how to get there, of course, but..." Davron's voice trails off. "And in any case, I should learn more of what would await me there, ere I embark on that journey. Perhaps when I have done so, I will see the wisdom you speak of." He rises and bows to Lytek. "I thank you for your help, sir. And I hope, for your sake, for mine, and for that of Creation, that I will eventually choose the wisest course. Whatever it may be."

The Solar is already on his feet, and polite farewells are exchanged as is proper. As the door closes, Lytek reclines in his chair, folding his fingers together. "His development will be interesting to observe indeed," he murmurs, then notes a presence to his left, and turns his head to regard it. In answer to some silent voice, he nods. "Yes, master, I believe you may be receiving him shortly."

Davron's journey takes him to other quarters: gardens, and occupied Celestial apartments, off in distant precints of Yu-Shan. And in one such garden he finds a woman whose rumor reached his ears during his search of the magnificent city. She is sitting quietly, assembling a sort of clockwork bird with her hands, when Davron approaches. As she looks up, he sees the infinite depths of her gaze, and feels an aura of wisdom wrapped about her. "It's rare to find the living so far afield," she murmurs.

Davron grins wryly. "Far afield it may be, ma'am, but my course may lead me in far stranger directions yet," he says, admiring the avian construction briefly - and his curiosity gets the better of him for the moment. "What is this?" he asks, fascinated.

"This," the woman says, holding up her work in progress, "is more like those there." And nodding to the trees around the garden, she draws Davron's attention. Here and there he can hear faint chirping, and when he sees the source, he recognizes more clockwork mechanisms in the shape of songbirds. He can even see nests of wire in higher branches.

Davron looks out upon the garden, nodding. "Indeed..." he breathes. "A wonder of complexity..." After a moment of admiration, he goes on. "What I am seeking is the artisan of something unimaginably more complex: the Solar Sparks themselves."

The woman puts aside her work, and a minute passes before she replies. In the interim, it seems that she's been seeking her own memory for such things. "It has never been done," she replies at last. "Only Autochthon himself would have the knowledge necessary. If you wish to understand your Exaltation, he is the only teacher possible."

Davron nods. "I know. But one does not seek out the Primordials lightly... especially to do a thing that has never been done. And I would rather be as prepared as I can be for such an encounter." He smiles. "Lytek was not pleased with the idea that I might meddle with my own Spark - how, then, would its designer react? Would he be willing, or even eager to help? Or would he strike me down for my presumption?"

"Would his wrath be any worse than the price of failure you would pay for attempting what I now see you wish?" the woman asks with a smile, her eyes narrowing in contemplation. "Yes, your wish is written in the anguish of your eyes, your affliction betrayed by the tremor of your hands. So, I ask - this thing you think to do, would you risk the unspeakable to do it?"

Davron looks out into the garden, making no effort whatsoever to hide the distress that accompanies his cogitation. At length, he says, "If you know what I wish to do, then you know what fate I seek to avert by doing so. But I do not know so clearly what should happen if I fail. Do I merely risk hastening the fate I seek to avoid? Or could the results be even worse yet?"

In response the woman extends her hand, crushing it around the clockwork bird. There's a cracking sound. When she opens it again, there's nothing but springs, cracked struts, and shattered gear-work. These parts she extends for inspection, wordlessly.

Davron winces, the sound of craftwork being destroyed grating against his very soul. Nevertheless, he forces himself to gaze at the wreckage, to imagine what would happen if he were to do this thing to his own spark. At length, he sighs and nods. "I understand better, now, what displeased Lytek so." He rubs his chin. "For myself, I am willing to accept the risk. But there are others who would be affected. I cannot ignore them entirely."

After hearing a more in-depth explanation, the woman nods slowly. "I see... And it does not surprise me," she murmurs. "As to the other matter on your mind.. who owns your spark?"

"Who owns my life?" Davron asks. "No one owns themselves wholly, unless they cut themselves off from the world. My Circle, and Gallius' Nation, depend on me in _this_ life, of course. But as to the spark itself - if anyone owns it but myself, it is Helios."

The ancient ghost clears her throat. "A certain king had no heirs of his own, but for three sons given to him by his grateful people. Though commoners, they were given a noble inheritance. Each prince was further invested with a sum of money and told, 'this is thine, invest as thy heart wishes, that the land which is thine shall be enriched'. The first prince, not trusting his wisdom, kept his treasure safe and returned it to his lord in due course. The second prince trusted his wisdom, but foolishly, and spent his wealth on things of little consequence and grand deeds easily forgotten. The third prince trusted his wisdom, and bought fields far from the kingdom, in lush land. He commanded his subjects that would travel to tend to these fields, and so brought forth a rich harvest." And her penetrating eyes look up to meet the living Exalt's.

"There is no right answer," she says at length. "You alone choose how you will use what you've been given. It is not for I or even Helios to dictate wisdom to you."

Davron meets the ghost's gaze levelly, and eventually nods. "Then I will proceed, if I can," he says, simply.

"Then you will find Autochthon through the Doorway of Endless Devising," the ghost counsels. "Ask for it by that name in any of the Bureaus."
