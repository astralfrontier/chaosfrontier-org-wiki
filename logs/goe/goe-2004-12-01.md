As Gallius explains to the Circle her intentions of assaulting the Deathlord on her own turf, and what will be necessary for a successful operation, Davron realizes that they will need better defenses against ghosts than they had in the City of Dreams. Casting his memory back to that day, he studies and refines the roughly-formed technique he had employed: that of pouring Essence into a weapon so that it casts a "shadow" capable of touching, indeed wounding, immaterial foes.

Even as he polishes the technique, though, he realizes that it needs to be supplemented even further; just as in Harborhead, there will be the need to silence those who could raise the alarm. And so Davron immerses himself even deeper in the instinctive shaping of Essence, learning how to mingle the patterns of more than one Charm at once. The result: Inevitable Ghost-Piercing Shot, a technique to imbue an arrow with Essence such that, not only _can_ it strike an insubstantial target, but it _will_ strike it.

Inspired by this success, Davron goes further, mingling his talent with the bow with his nimbleness and agility and forging them into a new whole, which he calls Blinding Evasion of the Archer. He demonstrates the technique to his Circle: a whirling nimbus of Essence wraps around his limbs and his bow, giving him preternatural lightness of foot and of hand as well as igniting his arrows with searing white fire.

And somehow, even with all that, Davron finds the time to learn the basic techniques of countermagic; for the Abyssals practice sorcery as any other Exalt, and the Circle shall require some defense against it. Though the wound in his neck is long-healed, and the battle seems a lifetime ago, Davron still remembers how close the sorcerer Ice came to sending his head and body along their separate ways.

The final order of business, done even as the circle begins it's voyage to pick up its allies, is for Gallius to make one final stop, and this in the city of Nane. She comes to visit a friend who always seems to know when she is coming. And so she finds the Master waiting for her outside the city, in a place where he many time's lectured her on what she must do to ensure a safe future for all of Creation. He is not alone however, for at his side is a short man of a frame that could only be described as wiry. Strapped to his back in a travel-stained, leather hilt is a sword of starmetal, and in its pommel rests a pair of glimmering jewels.

"I see my message was well recieved," says Gallius as she bows to the Master and to his guest. "I am Gallius Leom, Zenith Caste. I pray that my impression is correct, and that the Sidereals will aid us against the servants of the Deathlords this day?" The Master smiles, but the man at his side grunts, and his eyes narrow, their scarlet irises glimmering, and in his pupils dance specks of the same color, making them appear like pools reflecting a night sky. "The plans of the Deathlords are best thwarted," the Master says smoothly. To this the other says, "I am Crying Blade, and I will help you thwart them this day. Tomorrow the fates may demand I thwart you."

Gallius considers the red-eyed Sidereal and nods to him, "If that is what fate demands, I shall smile upon this day, and hope that the tomorrow you speak of is no longer a necessity."

Yet even as Gallius is making her polite farewells to the Master and Crying Blade is boarding the airship, another two people step into the clearing. This time, it is the Master's turn to be surprised, though he is far too much the proper Sidereal to let it show as more than a raised eyebrow. "Well, if it is not Lady Cloudburst again. Are you here to ransack the libraries of Nane once more?" asks the Master.

But there is something different, this time. As Cloudburst draws near, something about her shifts subtly, as if a mask that was not quite a mask was lifting away, revealing a different woman, though one finds it hard to explain just how it can be. She reaches up to loose the clasps of her outer cloak and falling away it reveals robes of violet beneath and when she raises a hand to the Master, it bears the small tatoo of a blade upon it. "My name is Coranna, Chosen of the Maiden of Endings," she says, and then she bows and gestures to the strong man at her side, "And this is Wolf Brother, my companion through many difficult journeys. A time of endings is upon us. The Exalted are allied once more. Saturn's will is clear to me. I will aid you, Queen Gallius Leom, and your circle, if you will it."

To say Gallius is surprised is to say the sun on the desert sands is warm. "Cloudburst? All along?" she murmurs. The Sidereal nods to her, wearing a small, pleased smile. Gallius collects herself in a few moments, thankfully and speaks in a warm tone, "I will it. I know my circle would be honored to have you both fight at our sides." She bows deeply to both Coranna and Wolf Brother.

Coranna turns to consider the sky a moment, then says seriously, "It is time to go. The time for looking back is over, Queen Gallius. There is no going back now. What was has Ended. What will be is now born. Let us see it through." And the Sidereal strides at Gallius' side, with Wolf Brother standing behind them as if to guard them both, and judging from his grim expression and powerful form, he may well intend to do just that.

Coranna bows to the circle and offers what amounts to an apology, "I fear you may have been mislead as to my precise identity, but I assure you it was for a worthy purpose. But the time for hiding in your library has ended, though don't think for a moment this means I will no longer expect to see more books brought to me. Nor do I leave that task. It has been quite enlightening." She turns away then, staring to the west. Whatever she sees, she seems pleased by it. "Everything is going exactly as it is destined to," she explains to those who would ask.

Shadowlands are no place to be. Even as the sun is shining, still the ground looks ugly and barren, there are no sounds of animals, even the magnificent ship given by Yurgen looks drab, its color and brilliance sapped by death around it. Still the land is dangerous, as other Exalts begin ot merge; the Wyld Hunt arriving in Volos, perching on the ship's deck. Valon appears, gleaming in his jade strider, less shiny in the blasted land. A trio of demons, forced to stand outside the ship, seem almost at home, one even drinking in the air. The Solars themselves meet below deck, while the Lunars and Sidereal aid linger above. All are anxious, for as the sun sets, even this crew feels uncomfortable after dark in the land of death.

Once darkness has stained all the sky like a bled-out ink well, the confederation of Exalts move outwards in silence. The edge of the Shadowland they had entered is no more, for it stretches onwards over the horizon, over the dark, scrubby plains. And far off, spied by Ramar's keen sight, is the speck of their destination. He shifts the ship a fraction, and it continues undaunted, much like the dual steps of the striders below. Now if only nothing stands in their way; this much power strolling through the Underworld is powerful, but the home advantage is lost.

Davron and his team form the vanguard, climbing laboriously over the lip of the precipice south of the river. Their responsibility is to ensure that the heavy assault forces can get as close as possible to the dark fortress before they are spotted. Yana and Davron take point together, Yana silently fuming at her opinion that Davron sounds like a herd of yeddim as he moves - but without him, she would have no warning of any ghosts as they drift invisibly along the plateau.

As they creep forward, Davron rests a hand on Yana's shoulder, and nods ahead as he spots the insubstantial sweep of a bird's wings. They creep a little closer and then duck behind a grey boulder and wait there for a time, and Davron spots several more animal ghosts - raitons, birds, and others, all following a fixed pattern. Eventually, he is satisfied, and rests his bronze arm against the stone to steady his aim as he fires upon the sentinels, two at a time, bolstering each arrow with an insubstantial "shadow" that will pierce the birds' fleshless flesh.

For these sentries, Davron doesn't wish to take any chances. He touches the arrow to his brow, tendrils of Essence wrapping around it from where the Caste mark would be, and he draws a quiet breath in the dead air to steady himself... draws back the bow... and as he does so, another tendril snakes invisibly through the air, connecting with the ghostly raiton. He draws back his bow and fires, the arrow whistling unerringly along its appointed course to grant the raiton its permanent rest.

Davron nods to Yana and gives her a thumbs-up, and she moves ahead, more confident in Davron's second sight. The next sentry is a flesh-and-blood raven which falls prey to Yana's own preternaturally adept archery with nary a squawk. And so in this fashion the two make their way within arrow-shot of the fortress, the rest of the skirmishers following in their wake.

As they approach the tower, their keen eyes spot four sentries, in human shape this time, nearly motionless in their vigilance atop the patrol tower. After a quickly gesticulated conference, Davron, Yana, Oaken Claw, and Zephyr drop into firing positions, each taking aim at a different soldier - Oaken Claw to the east, Zephyr the north, Yana the west, and Davron the south. Coranna, designated as the signaller, steps between them, holding out three fingers, then two, then one - and as she holds out a clenched fist, four arrows fly as one, darting forward with the uncanny precision of the Chosen to blind the fortress's eyes.

Nodding in satisfaction as the humanoid shapes drop from visibility atop the tower, the team spreads out, each finding a hidden spot closer in to the fortress. Before Davron parts with the group, he looks questioningly at Coranna, wondering how their companions will decide when to follow - but she simply smiles at him and mouths, "Crying Blade will know."

Hulking Orichalcum and Jade shine in the light at the base of the cliffs, waiting. The two war stridingrs are accompanied by Crying Blade, Yurgen, Mountainheart, the Dragon-Blooded knight, and Hellspike, who jumps from low ledge to ledge, pacing anxiously. Crying Blade stares into the reflection of the Underworld's sun off of the starmetal weapon. A tilt here, then there, then... He stands, sheathing it. "Go." Hellspike, nimble as a spider, scales the wall with elated anticipation as Chi-Yosh and Valon, their magical, mechanical muscles wrenching, begin the quick, fierce climb up the cliff face, the others riding on the shoulders of giants.

Once at the top, the crew skirts the keep's edge until they come to a specific part of the wall. Mountainheart spies the masonry, tapping various spots with the hilt of his sword. Finally he rears back, and drives the grand daiklave's tip into the detected weak spots, leaving great gaps. Hellspike, now a mouse, scurries through one hole, and into the building beyond. One heartbeat. Two. The Lunar, looking back from the storage cell's exit, cannot miss a gleaming foot explode through the wall, ancient stone disintegrating in a wide swath as the Warstrider shoulders through, shedding light over barrels and crates, and beyond to corners never before gifted with the light of day.

From every corner, a sonorous clanging begins to toll in the dead air of the Underworld. Shouts of alarm are raised, and from every door and entrance, men and other less savory creatures pour out, already clad in armor.

Once inside the storage room, the striders lurch forward, stomping, shoving or throwing anything in their way free, or simply leaping over the most inconvenient obsticles. Hellspike keeps the door clear for the striders as they break through the entrance to the storage cell, and find the ground below broken and jagged, walkways lacing over the ground. Valon and Chi-Yosh plow forward first, herding the defenses out of the way as the rest flow in their wake, cutting as they run. One well placed leap off of one walkway sets them in line towards the Central Tower, and find themselves half way into a mad dash to reach the wall.

The colossal cargo door on the western side of the central tower opens, and out pour three Warstriders - Noble-sized, from the look of them. They turn, seeing Chi-Yosh and Valon in their own suits, and from their mechanical arms spring wickedly-sharp blades that crackle with electricity. Meanwhile, the walkways are alive with soldiers of the dead, preparing their bows and blades to repel the invaders on foot.

As the Abyssal warstriders draw their terrible weapons, the crackling makes it hard for them to hear the Solar and Dragon-Blooded archers advancing on their flank. But they may well _feel_ the arrows, perhaps, as they find their way through gaps in the soulsteel armor.

Meanwhile, Coranna raises her arms and begins to weave the patterns of sorcery around her - Wolf Brother, Spring, and the demon Shalan forming a wall around her to dissuade any who would seek to disrupt her casting.

And finally, Davron straps into his volo, the silvery wings carrying him to the top of the dungeon, giving him an excellent vantage of the wall. His practiced eye studies the masonry of the central tower's wall - for just as a martial artist knows the way that _ki_ flows through the human body, an architect knows the way forces flow through a building.

Nodding to himself, Davron picks out several weak points high on the tower, near the roof, and drawing his golden bow, launches flaming arrows at those spots, signaling to Chi-Yosh where the Pride of the Nation's mighty blows should land.

At the sight of the noble striders, Chi-Yosh pauses, and throws out an arm to stop Valon. He then points further up the wall, above the walkway they stand on. "Breech here! Everyone not Crying Blade, go in!" Heeding the suggestion, Valon rushes forwards, lopping like the ape he is to gain momentum for the leap, which takes him high. The pound of fists mid-air crash through, giving him something to grip, as legs draw up to slam repeatedly into the tower until it rumbles inwards. Both legs sweep, clearing the walkways beyond before the Lunar falls to the platform below, and arches, letting the others climb up his body.

Chi-Yosh starts into a run after Valon, but it is slanted wrong. Essence builds like a tidel wave, shimmering over the alabaster armor like gossamer set aflame over a candle. It builds with each thunderous, agile step, the power flowing starting to send ripples through the walkway, before it bows downwards as the Solar pounces forward towards the strider at the side . Angry radiance arcs with him, a meteor coming down upon the walkway. It ripples outwards, even the fortified walkway rebounding beneath, bucking under the striders. But the power had forked, the second tongue redirected upwards, as Chi-Yosh's hulking fist crashes up into the noble vehicle in a flash.

Trailing behind the Strider's headfirst lunge is Crying Blade. Leaping over the walkway, takes the rightmost Strider, a starmetal-armed wasp, weaving side to side before striking. Motes of Essence glitter around him like constellations, lines of power streaking as his weapon weaves a line of eldrich geometry. At the peak of the gesture, he lunges, blade and body corkscrewing into a reign of blows singing off the vehicle's carapace.

A shadow within a shadow. A pale green star and a brief flurry of movement. The preclude to the airship's triumphant charge is not nearly as dramatic as the precise moment, when like the first light of Dawn, the ship of the North crests the cliffside. Arrows and Knives fly from the decks, and under Ramar's guidance, the ship swings elegantly through the Underworld's sky. There's a grimace as the outpouring of the undead and their servants becomes plainly aware... the ship charges in, clearing a small path for the Lady Gallius and her team to disembark. "GO!" Ramar shouts, Burning Brand seems to glow even in its strap on his back. "We'll cover you from on high!"

Even as the airship rushes on towards its target Gallius bursts into the very flames of the sun, her visage becoming horrifying to look upon, and on the back of her golden steed she looks every bit the wrathful servant of the Unconquered Sun. She sets upon the middle of the deck, waiting for some sign to start her charge.

The signal comes with the gathering of essence by Samea, the Solar sorceror set into motion at the urgings of Ramar. Her deft hands aligning the strands into first a web, and then beginning to give them form, twisting, twisting them until the final effect begins to take shape. And at her side stands one of her demons, glowering and moving to block any darts that might try to strike its master. It is Ralamaris, He Who Slakes His Thirst on Bleeding Stones and Widow's Tears, who shall serve his purpose in this way.

Gallius spurs Jin-nu into motion, and horse and rider blur, becoming one force. With Kihime clinging for dear life, Gallius and Jin-nu plunge from the ship to the walkway below, their glittering star turning it's vengeful light upon the warstriders that would bar their path. There is no break in stride, but only a full-on strike as the Nation of the Sun's Queen rallies to the aid of her allies and friends.
