# Gods of Eden 2004-12-08

Following the successful raid against the Abyssals, Gallius and her circle find themselves once again resting in Bridal Veil. The world as they know it has changed in ways that few can easily quantify. The most obvious is a new addition. Coranna sits with them at the table, the doors shut away and spirits put in place to ward the room from prying ears by the Sidereal sorceress.

"Er." Ramar's eloquence speaks volumes. "Where... do we go from here?" He looks to the others, curiously, "I mean... we've shaken up the hive, what of the hornets?"

Chi-Yosh allows his dinged up spine to relax in the high cushion of the chair he relaxes in. "If we do not have to deal with the Dowager's retaliation, then next we are to seek the first place Korash sent us?"

Davron nods. "We surely will do that, Chi-Yosh, as soon as possible. If we are to survive the battles that are to come, we _must_ do that. The Labyrinth of Lies, forbidding as the name may sound, is our next destination as a Circle."

Ramar agrees, "To the Labyrinth of Lies. What do we know about that place? Anything?"

Coranna looks from the cat in her lap to Davron, and then to Chi-Yosh. "From what little I can see of the actions of the Deathlords, it seems that revenge is not of any great interest to them. Logically, such an act would cause the situation to grow still more serious. It seems She has no interest in such a conflict at the moment."

Davron looks through Dr. Altieri's notes. "What we know is what is in here. Korash found what he could, but he wasn't able to enter the Labyrinth itself. What we will find there is... uncertain."

"Who named it the Labyrinth of Lies anyway?" Ramar settles back in his chair, fingers steepled together. "Perhaps She has an even greater interest... perhaps she knows what we are after."

Chi-Yosh turns to Davron. "What do the notes say about him trying to enter? What barred him? It could be that something unique in the Celestial Exalted, possibly the Solars themselves, allow only them entry."

"Whether she knows or not hardly changes things," says Gallius. "Our path was a desperate one, and we survived. That may be enough to intimidate even a Deathlord. Let us not forget, though, that they are likely to have all the knowledge that lies in those books already at their finger tips."

Ramar raises his brow, "Indeed... let us hope they do not. For such a foe would be terrible to behold. If even half of what is said of some of those spells are true..." Silence speaks volumes, it's said, and here, it's a particularly articulate volume. "But then, we shall learn, and protect ourselves."

Coranna offers calmly, "Against all things good preparation can provid amply security." She frowns in thought, trying perhaps to dig up some scrap of useful lore for the occasion. What she says is not what she expects, "I did not think I would ever reveal myself to Solars."

Davron can think of little to respond to that, at first. Then: "The world has feared us for centuries - and rightly so. It is a blessing indeed when anyone is willing to trust us." He smiles gratefully to Coranna.

Coranna pretends to gripe, "Well, it's not as if _she_ gave me much choice," she says, turning a bit of a glare on Gallius. The Solar smiles back at her, earning a snort. "That is hardly fair, really. You all have twisted my destiny around your fingers as if I were some sort of toy. In the end, I had to accept that the only control I could ever gain on my own fate would require that I reveal myself."

"Er. Uh huh." Ramar has a decidedly puzzled expression on his face. A maze of confusion from which he might never emerge. Or, rather, he goes crosseyed for a second. "I'm sure we didn't mean to. You might have said something from the start.""

Chi-Yosh glances over to Coranna. "The Sidereal is complaining that we have twisted her fate." He gives the woman a sly little smile.

"Or she is trying to use humor to deflect any further suspicion," replies Ramar, with a wry grin. "In either case..." The grin fades, "Why didn't you tell us something? Are we that dangerous?"

Coranna steeples her fingers and rests her chin on them, looking over at Ramar. "Since you have never seem the loom of fate spin out its tale you can't possibly appreciate the impact you have in the same way a Sidereal does. However.. think of what Bridal Veil is now. Then think of what it was a year ago. Two years ago. Ten years ago. A hundred."

Ramar nods, "Yes yes, I know, we've changed the fate of the world. But. Why is it that you must always know well... how everything is to turn out? Why must you know who is scheduled to die, or thrive, and when?"

"Why is it you must lead the world?" asks Coranna. "If it my purpose. My duty. The Maidens guide us to do what is meant to happen. If you ask too many questions, you eventually reach the point where there are no answers. It is the way it is because that is the way it is."

Davron shakes his head. "I do what I feel is right - what I believe that I must, to the best of my ability. If my abilities are far greater than they I had ever imagined in my youth... then so be it. Even if I risk my own life, or even more than my life..." His brows knit as he ponders once again the perilous course he faces in his personal destiny.

Ramar has to chuckle, "Who says I must lead the world? Or even that I will?" There's a very amused expression on his face, "I can scarcely open my mouth without putting my foot in it... and that's merely the surface of things... I'm not fit to lead the world. I've no intention of doing so. I don't want that. I will do what I feel is right, yes, and I will gladly risk my live to help another, or serve some higher purpose... but... lead the world? That is another matter entirely."

Chi-Yosh turns to Ramar. "It is not thatyou do what you feel is right, but what it is you feel is right, that you do. It is that you risk your life to help, for a greater purpose, these things make you a leader. Helios would not have Chosen you had he not determined what you are is what makes a leader in some sense, and that you will be one, in your capacity."

"The purpose of the Solars is to rule Creation," says Coranna. "While I had my doubts, recent events make me believe that it is indeed true. After all, how many other beings have the courage to face the Steersman when they are barely old enough to handle themselves?" She laughs softly, turning her attention back to her cat, whose ears she scritches with care. "At the very least, I will be able to write such a story of history as the world has never seen."

"Er. Yes. Well... uhm..." Ramar looks a bit relieved as he finds a way out of this one, "Er... Davron, what is it you're speaking of... what more do you have to risk than your life?" After a pause, he turns to Chi-Yosh, "And... thank you. That's... comforting. I think I needed to hear that." He nods to Coranna, "Very well then. At the very least we can give you a good story. Er. Just leave out the bits where I talk, mm? Strong and silent. Mysterious. Yeah... that's the trick."

Davron looks up at Ramar, looking pensive. "I can't remember if I've spoken to you about my nightmares... my dreams of cruelty and menace? Well... in our recent expedition to Yu-Shan, I have learned something about them. And they will only grow worse... unless I find some way to alter my very Exaltation."

Ramar considers Davron, "You hadn't mentioned those before no..." A pause. "Altering your very Exaltation? Altering how? Do you mean becoming more like the bearers of old? Do you mean to reshape your spark to meld with who it is you are? Or..." Ramar studies Davron thoughtfully, an odd glint to his eyes for a second, "Do you mean something else..."

Now this draws Coranna's attention like a moth to flame. Alter Exaltation? "Now that is something that has never been done so far as I know," she murmurs. And everything done that has never been done before is of keen interest to the Chosen of Saturn.

Davron shakes his head at Ramar. "Becoming more like my bearer of old is precisely what I _fear_, Ramar. If the dreams speak truly, he is everything I do not want to be. And no, it has not been done before," he replies to Coranna, with a slight smile. "I'm afraid I rather horrified poor Lytek with the very suggestion."

Ramar nods then, "I see... then... is there some way that I can help you do this Davron? I mean... I imagine that you'd rather not wait to reforge your soul... what... what can I do to help?"

Davron shakes his head at Ramar. "I'm still learning the full scope of it. But... it may be perilous even to help." He smiles. "But if you will still help when you know what it entails... I will be grateful."

Gallius listens with interest, though this is far from her area of expertise. "I imagine the cost of failure in your attempt would be considerable," she says quietly. "And who can possibly guide you in such a task?"

Ramar nods, "Very well then. When you learn what it entails, let me know." He looks to Gallius, "Very considerable... I imagine." He pauses, smiling thoughtfully, "If it is in my power to help you, in any way, know that I will, regardless of the risk. Even if that help means telling you to find another way to do what you'd like."

"None other than Autochthon himself, Gallius," says Davron. "And seeking him alone may be nearly as perilous as the task itself."

Chi-Yosh says, "As was finding Leviathan, or Chejop. But these things were not done without support from the Circle."

Coranna nods thoughtfully, though the words make Gallius start. "Leviathan was hardly dangerous in the way this is. Will he even allow you to come to him? And if you did and he offered aid, what would be the price?" Gallius asks seriously. "This is a desperate course."

"A very desparate course." Ramar turns to regard Davron, "Are you sure that this is the only way?"

"Desperate indeed. But... if I do not, the memories of my former self will grow stronger and stronger until they subsume me utterly." Davron looks grim. "And they are memories of a cruel man, who delights in war and killing for their own sake. If the tales of Anathema have any truth to them, he was among them."

"There is truth in those tales," says Coranna. "No lie can long last without a seed of truth to grow in." She laughs suddenly, "Yes, it is a lie, I suppose. I have seen no signs of the madness in you yet, but I fear in time it may come again. Only some great event outside the vision of the Sidereals can change that, I believe."

Ramar nods, thoughtfully. _Or perhaps an event none have yet thought of... perhaps they are not as all-seeing as we would think..._ Ramar shakes aside hese thoughs, then asks Davron, "How do you know?"

Chi-Yosh says, "Could these answers be in the Book of Three Circles? Of how to prevent the madness, or change the very nature of ourselves?" He hesitates. "Or perhaps in the depths of Demandsor?"

"It seems unlikely that this knowledge will be found in the Book of Three Circles," says Coranna. "But little can be said for certain. Those who have seen the Book do not share such lore." She grins impishly and asides to Chi-Yosh, "I hope you find the Book. If you do, it will relieve me of a certainty I've been eager to shake since I was exalted."

"Lytek explained to me that the spark of Exaltation normally separates one incarnation from another - the 'partition walls', as he describes them," Davron explains. "In my case, the partition wall is weaker than normal. So far I retain control - and I may yet do so for months, even years." He shakes his head at Chi-Yosh. "Coranna says this has not been done before - so even the Book itself will not speak of it, nor will the Empty City hold any tools that will free me of the dreams. Or if it does, none but Autochthon will know how they may be employed."

Ramar listens intently. "Ah. Then, if this is the only way, I shall walk with you to Autochthon, though I do not know the way. You should not have to face this alone."

Coranna muffles a cough and says, "There has been no such attempt that I know of. I am not like most Sidereals you have met. I make no claims to know everything. What I do know, I know with as much certainty as can be had. The things I do not, I will reveal in that way. As far as I've learned, none have ever changed the sparks. I am not certain they can be changed, though that is not to say there is no way to achieve what you wish."

Ramar informs, "I believe they can be changed. I believe we have it within ourselves to change. To define. Not only our sparks, but who we ARE... it is this that makes us great. It is this that makes anyone great." He sighs. "Or, I am mistaken."

"The one thing I would caution you to avoid," says Coranna, "Is to believe without fact. Ground yourselves and remember your faith alone was not enough to protect you against failure and madness. Remember that the destruction of the Solars in the first age was a just act. My greatest service to you will be to ward you away from the madness that consumed your kind before. You are needed to protect the world, but you must be kept whole or things will be even worse."

Chi-Yosh gazes across to Coranna. "This service you provide us is greatly needed, and appreciated. Yet I only wish such a guardian would come for the other Solars out there, those without our power, or our guidance."

"Every life changes a spark, Ramar," says Davron. "My former life must have done so, or else he would not haunt me now. What I propose is more direct. And more dangerous, since it was never designed to be tampered with in such a fashion. If I fail..." He sighs. "The madness may consume me in an instant, instead of over decades. Or I may destroy him and myself both, and every other life my spark has ever lived - or will live."

"I see..." Ramar nods, thoughtfully. "I shall help you fight this madness then. I will help you to remain who you are and banish this madness back where it belongs."

"But first we must get the book," says Gallius. "We need a full circle to achieve that, and even if it does not have the answers you seek, it may provide other clues that mean the difference between life and death."

"The Nation is progressing quite well," says Gallius, taken advantage of the conversation slump to change directions towards something she does know about. "Marina has done very well. I understand she's even satisfied a book-hungry critic along the way.."

Coranna lifts her chin and sniffs, "I was never less than satisfied with her work. She has a very good head on her shoulders and knows what is most important. I have done nothing at all to disrupt her." Gallius arches an eyebrow, "Well, I suppose that is likely. I imagine supplying her with several very rare treatises on diplomacy was simply out of generosity.."

"Book-hungry critic?" Ramar considers, "Ohhh..." He leans back, curiously, "So what do you plan to do then with the Nation? I mean... what... next? It's all kind of scary you know?"

"What's so scary about it?" asks Gallius. "It's not as if the people are disappointed thus far. We've made their lives better, and that was the whole point. What comes next may well be terrifying, though. We're going to eventually have to face some very unpleasant adversaries. At least we will not go it alone. Samea and Yurgen's circle will give us a fine way to break into Fair Folk warfare."

"And that's what's scary about it." Ramar nods, "That we have to face such foes... but..." He nods, "I suppose, as long as we are making their lives better, then... well... it's worth it."

"It is what we exist for," says Gallius. "At least what I think I exist for. I love having people to protect," she explains. "They are like.. like children. It's as if I had an enormous family to take care of."

Chi-Yosh says, "But that is what we are searching for such grand resources for." He spreads his hands around the room. "We are seeking preperation for the battles ahead, along side improvements and expansions for what we have now."

"Which is why the Nation will continue expanding," says Gallius. "Though there are some limits we'll have to accept. I will not offend the Lunars. Surely not Weeping Prowler to the east. And to the north Yurgen shall be growing. We will help him as we can. To the west we have the Confederation of Rivers. I'm still uncertain what to make of them as of late. At least Lookshy I believe is a reliable friend."

Ramar considers. "It looks as though Creation is finding a way to see to itself..." He chuckles, "And we are there to help it along. Or perhaps it is because of us. Well, we have much to do still, much to do."

"What is happening is happening because it is the right time to happen," replies Coranna. "Or so we must hope." Her strange, purple eyes lock on Ramar, considering him carefully. "And what of you. I have heard you called the Dreamer more than once. What visions do you see for the future?"

Ramar raises his brows, "Me? Oh..." There's a bit of a pause. "Nothing anyone else would care to hear I'm sure. And you?"

Coranna laughs softly, "The fly does not so easily escape the spider," she replies. "Now tell me of your dreams. My visions will be revealed to you in time. What little of them can survive the swirl you put in all matters, that is. The more power you gain, the more skilled I will have to become to see just what changes your actions will inspire. I believe my kind shall prove up to the challenge. We were once."

Ramar nods, "Much was lost. Much remains to be learned. New things to create. That's what I see. A world changing, and us moving with it. Everything changes."

Gallius hmms. "Everything does change, I suppose," she murmurs. Though it seems her mind is far from the topic at hand. "Do you remember the day we first met?" she asks, looking to her friends. "Things were so much simpler then."

Davron chuckles. "I remember it well, though I should hardly call Ma-Ha-Suchi preparing to remove your head 'simple'."

Chi-Yosh adds, "Our goals, our plans, our responsibilites were much simpler then. Before Gallius, the Nation was not but a dream."

"I wonder," murmurs Gallius, "What would have happened had we not met that day. Had Ma-Ha-Suchi not chased me so far away." She stares off for a time, not sure what she is feeling. "What did he know?" she mutters.

"I don't know." Ramar gives a bit of a sigh, "I suppose it is too much to expect that sometimes, things are simply meant to be... and that they happen for no other reason than 'we were meant to be together'. But, there may likely be some other reason... none I can guess just yet, but, perhaps our new friend can say more?"

Coranna answers in the way one might expect. "Solars, as I understand it, are the children of Helios, You are selected not for what you were born to be. You were not selected necessarily for what you were. But you were chosen because the path you were on would lead you to become exactly what he desired. There is little more I can say. Do not despair. You are the right people, this is the right time, and together, there is even hope we will find the right way for a great future."
