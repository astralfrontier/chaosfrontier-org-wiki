# Gods of Eden 2004-12-15a

At present, Ramar and his team are aloft, keeping an eye on the situation below. Where it looks like his allies need help, he'll bring the ship near so that those aboard the ship can lend their abilities.

The fortress is in chaos. The magma kraken and supernatural fire burning at the high sentry tower are bad enough; isolated pockets of soldiers are rushing to escape the plateau via the intact walkways, and sometimes being torn down by the ghosts of their fellows. The Dragon-Blooded, spirit-hunters all, have returned to the outside to do battle with the spectral remains of the once-mortal soldiers that now haunt the walkways, and they too must occasionally dodge the powerful tentacles of the kraken.

"Why do they tear down their fellows?" Ramar wonders, a look of horror on his face as he surveys the scene below. As the Magma Kraken's tentacles reach out and rend flesh and stone, and the fire burns the sentry tower down, he brings the ship down. Those Dragon-Blooded on his ship who are able, will join in the fight with the ghosts, putting an end to their existence with Essence, and blades sharp enough to cut the soul.

The Solar sailor's attention is drawn to the man-sized hatch atop the central tower, which must have opened again. There stands the masked and robed man, bearing his iron-heeled staff, and again he raises it. A stroke of lightning bursts from the cloudy skies overhead, striking very near the point Coranna is. She's saved by the intervention of her quick-moving Lunar ally, but in the time it takes, the masked man is already weaving his own magical powers.

In an instant, Ramar repositions the ship. The Kraken is to fall, but perhaps he can save the others. "The Kraken is going to fall," he shouts, though his voice is quickly lost to the din of swirling chaos that has engulfed the area. The sounds of battle are more than a match for Ramar's voice alone. He turns the ship towards the tower then, _If I cannot halt his counter this turn, then perhaps I can keep him from doing so again..._

The masked figure shouts and gestures, in a way Ramar recognizes as the invocation of Sapphire Countermagic. He explodes in an obsidian inferno of Essence, a pyre that reaches to the cloudy heavens of the Underworld and sends out streamers of magic that seek to destroy the magma kraken below. For a moment the world is silent, and then a burst of noise and lightning sends the airship rocking. The kraken has been destroyed, and a flood of undirected power sweeps away from its center point, causing chaos wherever it goes.

The keel of the airship barely grazes the top of the central tower, but the sound of a pained cry from below tells Ramar that his goal is at least partially met: the Abyssal necromancer has doubtlessly suffered a bad injury. If he survived, he will be retreating - for now.

As the airship grazes the top of the tower, Ramar circles back, moving towards Corrana. "Hey! Get in, it's not so safe out here anymore..." he manages a grin as he says this, though he turns back towards the central tower. "We'll have to be ready for him when he shows up again. Can you call the Kraken back?"

Wolf Brother makes a prodigious leap, carrying his Sidereal ward aboard the airship in one bound, and she descends to the deck easily. "We're past the need for it," growls the Lunar, gesturing downward. And indeed, the mortal forces of the Abyssal command have scattered or died; those that have not fled have been transformed into ghosts, and the Dragon-Blooded are putting paid to them. "Another would interfere with the monks."

Ramar nods, "Right then... what do we do?" Ramar scans the tower once more, "He's likely going to be back. If nothing else than to deal with the fire."

The ship returns to the tower, hovering near the hatch. "He'll likely be wary then... be ready to grab the necromancer when he pops out of the hatch," instructs Ramar as Wolf Brother hops off.

The Solar's attention is now drawn to the laboratories, for something is coming out of the large cargo-doors on the southeastern corner. These doors are connected by the wide walk-way to the central tower, from which issued the three soulsteel Striders. Now, the laboratory disgorges something perhaps less powerful, but more imposing. They seem like giants, but not singular beings. Instead, they are horrible amalgams of flesh, stitched-together collections of corpses given a semblance of life by the unholy necromancy practiced within the laboratories. There are four of these detestable creatures, and their attention goes immediately to the airship hovering overhead - for there is no other significant threat close by.

Ramar turns to Corrana, "Perhaps now might be the time to call the Kraken again." Ramar turns his gaze then to the Dragon-Bloods fighting the spirits on the walkways. "Maybe we should gather the troops, and send them after the true threats..."

The Sidereal points downward, as the necro-golems begin to lope along the walkways. "Your monks will not survive against those creatures," she says, sadly. "What else can be done?"

"Call the Kraken. Have it tear down the walkways," says Ramar, hurriedly. "I'll do my best to keep them distracted until you can."

The Sidereal nods, finding a safe point to begin casting from. Ramar calls out to Wolf-Brother, "Be ready! I suspect he'll make an appearance soon." Ramar then turns towards the Golems. The ship slides steadily through the air, drawing near, temptingly near, almost near enough to hit, only to dart back, over, and around the abominations.

The necro-golems wobble, making half-hearted evasions as the airship draws near. But these are merely the instincts given to them by their creators; the creatures do not know fear. And so it is that four ungainly hands snatch hold of the airship as it passes, and two of the things are drawn up into the air along with it. The ship tilts slightly from their weight, and Ramar hears the sound of their clumsy fingers attempting to find purchase on the railing and pull themselves up onto the deck.

Ramar swings the ship about almost wildly. It moves swiftly, almost too swiftly towards the side of the rocky wall, bearing dangling golems with it as it moves. "Be ready to have the Kraken seize these abominations when you're done..." _Just a few more seconds... perhaps we'll live after all..._

The sudden jerk of the airship is too much, and Coranna's shaping escapes her. With a sigh she slumps to the deck, still radiant with Essence. "I... lost it..." she wheezes. "Lost the spell.."

A gash is torn in the side of the rock wall where the golem scrapes against it. Corpses are torn from the fell creature's body, and in a shower of rocks and dirt one of the golems falls from the ship entirely. Ramar turns the ship, "Tell Samea then, have her bring something to fight these..."

The airship tilts, wavers, then sinks against the wall, if only briefly. The weight of the golem makes it all the easier to slam the ship against the cliff, causing the earth around it to shudder with the force of the corpses impact. Arms slam into the walls, and when the airship pulls back, the golem is not hanging on. Ramar turns to find the others, nodding to Corrana, "Brace yourself. We're charging them." With that, the ship turns in the air, aiming once more at the golems.

On the ground below, Coranna notices something odd - and disturbing. The golems that fell to earth, knocked free by the impacts, are slowly knitting themselves back together. She quickly draws Ramar's attention to this with a cry and a gesture.

The bow of the ship plows straight through one of the corpse-creatures, sending the stitched monster over the edge of the walkway and onto the rocks below. As the ship wheels round for another pass, Ramar glances towards the tower, then his attention is directed below. "Then we are defeated. If such a foe can rebuild itself... how can we possibly hope to win? Here. I'll drop you on the tower and keep these things from finding their way out of the shadows once again."

"All things have a weakness, Solar," counsels Coranna. "Use wisdom to find theirs. Fly me to the laboratory, and I will seek theirs within."

"We'll both go," considers Ramar, "The two of us can work faster than just the one. We still have some time..." He pauses, bringing the ship down atop the last of the golems as he moves through the air, full-tilt towards the labs.

The cargo door of the laboratories is still open, and attended by zombies. These shambling wretches are quickly and easily disposed of, and the Solar and Sidereal rush into the stench-clogged lair of necromancy. Within are dozens of vats. In some, Ramar witnesses men and women of evident Terrestrial heritage - if their elementally-flavored hair and skin tones are any indication - in various stages of decomposition or reconfiguration. Most horrifyingly, it seems to him that they are still alive.

In other, larger vats, he can see the beginnings of more of the necro-golems. In each case, there is a great green jewel in the breast of each creature. The gems throb with power, boiling the arcane liquids the golems' components are bathed in and seemingly imparting some power to the disparate limbs that will create the creatures.

"Back to the ship," shouts Ramar as he turns, running as fast as he can towards the parked ship. "After the golems are dealt with we shall return, but our priority is the beasts attacking at present..." He clambers into the airship, ready to take to the skies once again.

The ship hovers above the ground, and Ramar pushes off from the edge, leaving Corrana at the helm. As the dessicated flesh pulls itself back together, Ramar brings his Daiklave to bear on the creatures, marking the point of their gems with his keen senses, he does his best to pierce it with the tip of his sword.

Landing, Ramar's fiery blade pierces unnaturally animated flesh and finds its mark in the first fallen golem. There is a crackling sound and an electric flash, as of lightning, and the limbs and appendages of the thing quiver ecstatically in its death-throes.

The second creature is harder, and Ramar tries twice to strike at its weak spot with his weapon. Both come close, but the fast-knitting healing of the thing is too quick, and in a moment the Solar finds himself standing next to a fully-regenerated golem.

Ramar turns then, and runs as rapidly as he can towards the ship. Essence lightens his body, strengthens his legs, helps him to move well beyond the speed of any mortal. With a leap, he tries to get back aboard the ship, "We'll need to lift off then, and ram it again!"

The ship lifts off of the ground then, and as the Golem moves towards the ship, the ship moves towards the golem. Force is on the side of the ship, which slaps into the meaty carcasses, sending the creature flying through the air. It follows, and where the corpses begin to knit together, Ramar hops off, plunging his sword, guided this time by Essence, into the gem-heart, severing it's deathless energy from it's body.

The ship lifts off then, and the other golems are tracked down. It does not take much to find them, the imposing figures are large, lumbering brutes after all. The ship slams into them summarily, and Ramar once again leaves the ship, his firey sword finding their heart-stones, and shattering them. He turns back towards the ship then, "I suppose... we should go to the labs then."

There's a moment's pause as the strider is fastened into the attaching points on the airship. Ramar glances around, seeing to the safety and health of those who fight atop the walkways. After that brief moment, he pilots towards the land, setting down gently and leaving the helm in Corrana's capable hands. The daiklave is in his hadns as he strides inside... peering about cautiously.

Within the stench-clogged necromantic lair, Ramar is especially wary. He starts towards the larger vats... the necro-golems birthing chambers. With several swings of his daiklave, he shatters the glass, letting the liquid spill onto the ground. He shatters each of the gems in turn, then turns to the vats containing the Terrestrials... wretching at the sight, he walks towards them, fire still clinging to his sword. He sets about releasing them from their imprisonment, and burning away the foul, necromantic fluids. "Be released!"

"Poor souls... may you find peace in the death you have been denied for so long." The Solar makes a sign of warding near the corpses now freed from their prison. "May you not return as the living dead..." With a stroke of the sword he shall set them ablaze, shattering whatever grip the dark powers might have left upon them. Ramar turns towards the supplies, the vats of flesh harvested from living creatures barely known to Creation. These fall to his blade. Teardrops gathered from an innocent whose lover struck her down are released. A vial of a greenish liquid best left undiscovered spills into one of the myriad drains. As Ramar walks, he upturns the fell instruments.

Upon a bed rests a creature that was once four, perhaps five Terrestrials. Their faces can be seen in it's stitched visage, and the varied tints of elements now stretch out over the body. The manual next it records the progress, what stimulants it responds to, what things seem to harm it. Nothing mroe than a failed experiment, it is concluded. Ramar's sword sinks within, letting the sickly necromantic fluids leak out. He ensures that no one further shall attempt these experiments, then turns to regard the battle outside. With a few more slashes of his sword, he leaves the necromantic-labs in ruins, a fire still consuming the last of the fell energies, he rushes back towards the ship, and to his comrades. Perhaps this time the nightmares will keep him up much longer.
