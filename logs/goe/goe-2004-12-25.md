# Gods of Eden 2004-12-25

The wings of the volo catch the sun's rays quite handily as Ramar finishes strapping himself in. Once he's secure, he takes a few deep breaths, attuning his Anima with the Machine. Once the Essence is harmonized, he spends a moment surveying the twisting Chaos ahead of him. "I will try to come out in the same place," he says, as he gathers Essence and shapes it into a pattern to repel the essence of Chaos itself. He seems to become irrefutably real, as permanent as stone, as unchangeable as the deeps. "I cannot guarantee it though."

Ramar is of course standing aboard the airship, which is hovering at present in the East, overlooking the Wyld area that Ramar and Gallius have come across. It is to her he speaks, "All I need now is a lock of your hair, Lady Gallius..." He leans in close, and cuts a lock of the Queen of the Sun's hair. He stows it, then takes to the skies in the Volo.

Out past the trees the volo flies, a winged angel bearing its passenger and several coils of stout rope. Over trees, and trees, and more trees, and still more trees, while the endless Sun shines down overhead. And in time it becomes an ocean of trees in truth: Ramar can spot the green tops waving and bobbing like the surface of a great sea, in a weird reminder of his own homeland's waters. Every so often a gust of wind will blow swirls into the verdant dance of color and life, and here and there the Solar can at last spot islands - mountains of rock with beaches, onto which pinecones and leaves wash like the surf.

In the blue skies above, a cirrus cloud unfolds dragon's wings and rises to meet its mate, swirling around it in a ritual dance of courtship. From clouds to mist, then, as the sky changes. Ramar flies on. Through the dense fog, out of which echo men's voices as they cry for release. He hears the voices of sailors, tugging at ropes; he hears drowning men begging for their ship to return to them; he hears a strange splashing and crackling sound that might be the creaking of a ship's keel, were it made out of ice. The fog thins.

Ramar feels the pull of 'down' tugging where it ought to, but what he sees coming out of the fog belies that sense. If he ignored his sense of balance, he would think himself flying straight down toward a rocky plain. If he were still flying straight, then what he sees now would be an infinitely high, infinitely wide expanse of stone stretching out in all directions to the limit of vision.

Before he impacts with the stone wall/ground, Ramar tugs his Volo left and pilots it parallel to the imposing monolith. And so he flies, mist on his left, the rock wall on his right, watching in amusement after a time as he spies the faint shadows of dolphins and other marine creatures - as though the rock wall were actually water, and they were swimming to pace him. The mist to his left clears in time, and he looks out to behold an enormous cave of translucent gemstone and fire seemingly frozen in time.

Through the cave the Volo flies, and through it Ramar marvels. Beings of the same crystal-and-fire substance seem to inhabit these caverns, and hew with their rocky hands at the surface of it. From this raw material they seem bent on constructing more of their kind, which from his passing inspection seems only to require that the cavern's stuff be shaped into a humanoid outline. More than once he sees a just-completed statue of gemstone and flame spring immediately to life, then rush out and join in the same work as its fellows/creators.

A fork in the caverns presents itself, and Ramar elects to go right this time. The volo swoops through the self-illuminating caves, skimming about the ceiling and expertly dodging stalagmites - as well as more of the crystalline golems who seem to cling to the ceiling without difficulty. As he streaks through the caverns, he feels a sudden weight - two of the creatures have suddenly thrown themselves onto the back of his volo. They brandish talons of lustrous sapphire growing from their hands, seemingly ready to attack.

With not even a moment's consideration, Ramar turns in the volo, sending it spinning rapidly as the two gemstone creatures reach for him. The volo skims nearer to some of the stalagmites, as the pilot attempts to loose his passengers upon them.

The two creatures go falling, soundlessly, to the cavern below. Ramar can hear a crash of splintering crystal as they land. Noting their aggressiveness, he resolves to fly more warily. And so doing, he escapes the caverns without further incident. He finds an upward-leading passage branching away from the tube he's been navigating, for to continue would lead him in circles. Beyond this branching-tube is darkness, and nothing but. Nevertheless he feels certain that there is something ahead.

It seems hours since he left the caverns, and Ramar's Volo still continues to serve as aerial steed for its master. In a moment of curiosity the Solar looks "down", to where the caverns must have dwindled far from sight. What he sees astounds him. The crystal-and-fire of the cave walls is still discernible even at this distance, but its pattern is what truly deserves attention. He must be several hundred miles away now, and yet he can make out that the luminous caverns seem to surround a black zone with a silver ring, and beyond them are long extensions that must represent huge towers of iron thousands of yards high and bent at improbable angles. But overall the far-distant towers, the circular ring of the caverns and the strange whirlpool of darkness form nothing less than a human eye, complete with eyelashes. And when he sees the entire miles-wide form disappear with impossible suddenness, and realize that it is blinking, he thinks he might scream.

Beyond the darkness is light, and more light, and then something that is neither light nor darkness. Ramar reaches out to touch a shaft of sunlight that dances away from him, and finds that it sticks to his fingers like honey might. Here and there he can discern singing, and when he turns and moves, the song brushes across the skin of his cheek and stays there as well. The faint scent of blue wends its way into his nose, mellow and calming. Here, perhaps, a shaping can be attempted.

A drop of honeyed sunlight falls from the outstretched fingers on Ramar's hand. As it falls, the droplet of light reflects the world around it. Reflects the roiling mass of Essence that flares through Ramar's Anima and out into the clinging song. Reflects the way sound of blue changing to green coalesces into crystal and is captured in a net of sound. Then, as the sunlight hits the floor, it explodes into a lake of light, snared within mirrors of worlds within worlds... there's a sharp sound as reality asserts itself, brought on by the Essence, and Ramar's hands squeeze into fists. _Jade is heavier than air. Jade's scent is not a color. It can be many colors, though it is not colored like sound. Jade's weight drags the ropes down now, as I tie them to the talent. The ropes remain ropes, creaking at the strain, but they can bear it. The volo must dip now, slightly, as the Jade is real._

The volo hangs amid nothingness. Two talents of jade weigh it down, the ropes for the third hang down. Darkness and light are at war with each other, snakes coiling, striking at each other, or perhaps rivers flowing into one another, each trying to drown the other. The sound of their turmoil clatters to the ground, shattering into creatures that feel like pinewood smells, only to be swallowed up as light and dark grow in size. Ramar opens his eyes, piercing color and sound, pinning scent and touch until they are separated into what they must be. The light no longer swims, nor does the darkness swallow up the shadows cast. They are locked together, each devouring the other, until at last they fade away into nothingness, leaving only reality, only the truth of Jade behind. Jade that gleams within the light of Ramar's winged Anima, whose shadow stretches out in the distance.

His task complete at last, Ramar breathes. His sigh is heavy, leaden almost. It is time to return, but how? Perhaps he has ventured too deep, the directions becoming confused, twisting back within themselves. _I can only return now._ The jade swings heavily against the volo as he turns back, seeking hints of reality here and there, trying to find his way back to Creation, wherever that may be. The final talent of jade rests within the Wyld, waiting to return to the endless possibilities it was conjured from, when the last of Ramar's interactions with it passes.

Swimming through a sea of sound and color that wash over the Volo and rock the jade that hangs from it, there is at last a faint hint of a direction in which to travel. There. For a moment, on an island of scent, words become just that, audible. The volo sweeps through the ocean of sensation, and as it does, the island grows larger, until at last it encompasses... no, becomes the world. An endless field of glittering grains made from spun glass, and silk as light as moonshine. Yet... here colors are colors, and sounds are sounds. Even where the landscape rises, and a mouth of crystalline trees that form teeth and a firey mechanical serpent for a tongue speaks words of ancient dooms and long-forgotten blessings, it is becoming more and more rooted. More permanent.

The volo plunges through the mouth, devoured, now traveling through a passage of lava. Plants spring up, their rocky blossoms spreading, as creatures made from volcanic rocks crawl onto beaches, uttering sounds best left undescribed. The passage widens, and Ramar pulls the volo left, leaving behind the warmth and heading into a plane of ice. Hot ice. Ice that burns. Ice that melts the firey lava, turning it to water. A cloud of steam hisses up, and Ramar disappears within it.

When the steam clears at last, after what feels like days or perhaps only a second, the Volo flies above terrain that grows steadily more reassuring. That the glacier is composed entirely of trees that take root, and plant themselves down as the glacier plods along is comforting. Especially when at last, the trees become simply trees once more, and the Volo is free of the Wyld's grasp.

The volo touches down. The ground is reassuringly firm, neither parting as the Solar approaches, nor suddenly behaving in an uncharacteristic manner. To be certain though, Ramar digs his hands in the ground, and cries with delight upon finding merely soil. He slumps to his knees, and spends several moments basking in what he knows to be reality. The lock of hair is remembered then. And the Lady Gallius who awaits. The circle must be drawn properly first, to carefully direct the flows of Essence around such things, to placate any wayward spirits that might deign to frown on such a ritual. The runes come next, and the Lady Gallius' name is spoken with admiration as Ramar traces the lock of hair over the pattern, over the burning incense kindled by his touch alone. Scented smoke surrounds the Lady's hair, then dissipates into glyphs of sending carried away on the breeze. Ramar is calling to her. The kingdom of Halta, east of it, is where he waits.

---

The coming of Gallius is not a loud thing. This operation is one to be done as quietly as possible. Gallius directs the pilot with certainty to the place of the ritual, and as soon she draws near, she signals to Ramar to join her onboard the ship. She has no desire to stay so near the Wyld. It has left a mark on her once. She's not sure what it might do should she wander into its grasp once again.

Ramar reassures, "Perhaps you might get ears to match your tail... it might look nice..." He laughs, and finishes securing the jade within the hold of the ship. "Although you always look nice regardless of the state of your ears, Lady Gallius. What happens now? We have enough wealth to buy one of the Realm's kingdoms out from under them... but I understand you have something different in mind?"

"There are a few things we can use jade for," says Gallius. "But the goal I would like to pursue most at this time is bringing the Guild around. It is a large ship, so the turning shall take a great deal of time, but at least we have a clear direction. The misuse of drugs and the trafficking of slaves is going to end. Money can see that it is done."

"Indeed. Then I shall help however I can. Whatever it is you need me to do Lady Gallius, I shall do. It is a very noble goal." Ramar grins, and then looks thoughtful for a moment. "I wonder though. if the Guild did not need reforming, and the world was secure enough that this money could be spent on whatever you liked... how would you spend it?"

Gallius finds that question awkward. Her answer is perhaps a sign of her heart, "I would give it away, I suppose. But.. if all those things were true, would I have any purpose left?" She shakes her head, "It does not matter. It will be a very long time before I have to worry about that. I never really have wanted money for anything except for things of war, or building cities.. or things like that."

Ramar considers this, "Never wanted to drape yourself in the finest of fineries, or have a bed of jewels?" the Solar chuckles, "Although, I always thought that would be rather uncomfortable." He shrugs, "As to your purpose, I believe it is within us to make our own purposes, when one is complete, we will find another. Even if that purpose is not quite so grand. So... on that note, let's go and put this money to good use!"

The Mediator is a man chosen by the Guild when even carefully-controlled contact between a trading partner and a Guild representative is either undesirable or infeasible. He has no plenipotentiary power, in either direction. He is simply a living conduit of information, a man chosen to be a buffer and a messenger. His words are not binding contracts on the Guild. His first duty when meeting someone on business is to inform them of this. And so he does, and concludes with: "You may call me Kin. I have come to answer questions and talk terms." His clothes are well-tailored and decorated, as befits his station; his face is veiled, unreadable. The meeting place is one of Nexus' many high-class tea-houses, in which private rooms are always available for the affluent to discuss business away from prying ears.

Gallius nods to Kin, rather used to these kind of dealings. "As I have made clear in the past, I have a desire to make the Guild cease its traffic of slaves. I wish to make this mutually profitable. I have many resources at my fingertips, including a nearly limitless supply of wealth. How much does the current slave trade profit the Guild?"

"To answer that, I must first explain the nature of what you confront," the man says. "Picture an ice-covered lake in the North. You wish to move the lake south of where it lies. You reach through the ice to get a hand-hold. What you discover is not more ice, but water. You cannot simply lift water out by gripping it. Nor can you lift the ice-sheet itself. It will calve and break when you do." Kin pauses, letting this image sink in. "This is the Guild. To outsiders, it presents an orderly front. But beneath are thousands upon thousands of concerns, companies, merchants. They work together because it is profitable, but they are not subjects in the Guild's empire. The Guild does not rule. It administrates."

"Thus, I cannot tell you even roughly how much business is done. If you wish to understand the scope of the trade, thousands of talents per annum is likely."

"Yes, but it also has some measure of control," says Gallius. "And through its control, I can change those who thrive under its umbrella. For instance, if I were to waive all tarriffs on Guild sponsored caravans and the Guild no longer acknowledged those who deal with slaves, things might start to change."

Kin nods. "The Guild would count that amount into the balance sheets when computing costs of emancipation."

"Perhaps there is some way to get the Guild to function more orderly? To take the sheet of ice and solidify the water beneath it." Ramar muses idly, "Although I am not sure how that would help with tallying the costs of emancipation. It may make things easier."

Kin shakes his head. "You think in the manner of a ruler - order your subjects and they must obey or be punished. The Guild is not a kingdom. Its members cannot be ordered. What the Directors control is the connections between member companies, and access to the assets of the Guild by those companies. They cannot order their members to discard profit because it displeases you. Their function is to make it desirable to the member companies to pursue your program of emancipation."

"There are of course other things to consider. Other expenses," says Gallius. "As I have said, the doorway to endless wealth is in my hands. After all, what is silver but essence given form? And in certain places essence is willing to be whatever one of skill wills it to become. Those who trade under the Guild seem to use silver, do they not? It is a strange choice. Unlike jade, silver has little inherent use, would you not agree?"

"Silver has many uses," says Kin, smiling. "The wealthy value its appearance in the shape of jewelry, and pay highly for such things. I am told silver is also a component in some of Lookshy's weapons systems. It is much valued by the Dragon-God of the Khyris Pass and the spirits of the nearby kingdoms, near here, for use in replacing the god's scales. There are other uses, but part of the point of the silver standard is that it is _not_ coveted by many gods or powerful magical beings."

Ramar bows his head, "You speak wisely, honored Kin, and I understand things a little better for your words. Thank you. As for the use of Silver, it is perhaps a means of control. A means of discerning between the companies of the guild, of keeping prices where they ought to be, rather than letting things spiral out of control due to the hoarding of the coveted jade by those who would put it to use for things that will not serve commerce, or indeed many other purposes, all that well."

"Indeed," says Gallius. "Most of these uses rely on its rarity, of course," she adds. "If there were, say, several hundred thousand talents more, suddenly released into the market in exchange for jade, it would have a rather curious impact, wouldn't you think? It would be regrettable and cause a great deal of trouble."

Kin nods slowly. "Regrettable enough, in fact, to damage the program of emancipation the Directors might now be amenable to engaging in, yes?" he asks.

"Of course, there is still the matter of what currency my own people shall use," says Gallius. "It's a matter my advisor has been considering for some time now. Many have suggested the use of gold, for religious purposes, but I think that is a rather abrupt choice. Silver or jade seem far more likely. Due to my own plans for the future, however, I would rather gather up all the jade in my Nation and put it to a better use than as a currency."

Again the mediator nods. "And of course we are willing to take any material of value in trade."

"Of course," replies Gallius. She frowns in thought. "The question is simple enough. What might we do to make the actions of the Directors more effective in the handling of Emancipation? I would prefer not having to send my own hunters out to put an end to slavers directly, but I will not sit by forever. I cannot be so patient when thousands are sent to feed the hunger of Fair Folk. Such terrible acts are an affront to Creation itself. For such crimes even death is a small penalty."

"As is to be expected. After all, the Guild is exceptional at what it does." Ramar speaks softly, his voice hovering between respect and curiosity, "I wonder, in what ways would the prospect of emancipation be made less... taxing, more amenable to the directors who would be tallying such a cost, if I may be so bold as to ask, honored Kin?"

"Show them that you act in good faith," advises Kin, immediately. "Purchase slaves in the market and free them as you wish. Show them an immediate profit. 'The mouth moves but the hand speaks', I believe the saying goes."

"That seems a wise enough act in the very short term," says Gallius. "But I must think beyond the touch of the finger on the water. The ripples from such an act may disturb things still more. If I pay them money for slaves, have I discouraged them from claiming still more?"

"Of course." Ramar cannot help but smile inwardly at that. After all, what better suggestion than to purchase from the Guild. "But then what steps can be taken to show that such a profit is due more to the slaves being freed than merely another purchase of slaves from one who sells such things. Forgive me for asking, honored Kin, but you must understand things I cannot begin to, and would wish to know how to manage such a delicate task..."

"There are forces in Nexus that wish to abolish the city's slave trade," says Kin. "I do not speak for the Council of Entities. My experience with them suggests they will not encourage a larger market for slaves if it disrupts the balance between the abolitionist faction and the Guild. You must speak to one of their representatives for a clear picture of their intentions. I am not as familiar with conditions elsewhere."

"So encouraging a relationship between the abolitionists and the Guild, if the slave trade were to be abolished within Nexus may be a humble beginning. The rock which changes the river's course..." suggests Ramar, helpfully, "Though I do not mean to speak for anyone not present. It is merely an observation."

"I have more to think of then the borders of Nexus," says Gallius. "Most of the slave trade that occurs near here is not of the worst kind. It is the feeding of Fair Folk that I most hate, though the owning of humans itself is despisable. The destroying of a soul is unforgivable. Someday, judgement will demand its payment, and I shall not hinder it. I am willing to help the Guild clean its hands, but if you do not tell us a wise way to do so, there is little I can do."

Kin shrugs slightly. "I can only advise you how to make business go smoothly," he says. "If that is all you wish, return in three days' time. We will have a contract you may present to the caravan-masters. They will sell you their slaves, rather than deal with the Fair Folk. Men do not care to deal with the Wyld-spawn. You will find this a far easier and more affordable deal to strike, I think."

Gallius wrinkles her nose, "So be it," she says. "There is an adage from my people that says you can judge a person by those they do business with..." She sighs. "I will consider your terms. And I will consider other options."

"Nothing we have said here is binding," reminds Kin. "Nor would our contract adjure you from taking other steps. However, I think you will find doing business better than .. more military alternatives."

"I think we will go the economic route, in that case," says Gallius. "I trust you won't be setting the prices. But you need only bring one slave. Pick the finest slave you have. Young and healthy, and we shall pay.." She considers for a moment. "We shall pay three talents of jade for her.. or him." She looks to Ramar, "That sounds fair, does it not? After all, the stuff slows us down so."

Kin smiles the sort of smile only the top-drawer diplomat can achieve. "As you know, I have no authority over such things, and Nexus does not condone slaves within its boundaries. I suggest visiting a market upriver on the Yanaze or somewhere. You can travel there and back in the time it'd take to finalize the contracts I mentioned, if you like."

"We would not dream of engaging in such a transaction within these boundaries. My apologies if we seem hasty, honored Kin. Thank you very much for the contracts, and for the advice. It merely stems from a desire to use our wealth for something that we believe might change the world for the better you know. A very passionate things... and, well, my apologies for any misspoken words on my end of things. Indeed, your advice shall aid us greatly." Ramar bows his head in thanks once more, "Perhaps we shall need to go for a stroll?"

Kin rises and bows. "My security will see you to your ship - or wagons?" he suggests. "And thank you for your time."

---

Three Directors are gathered in one of the Guild's secure chambers. Kin, and two other men, are with them. There is a reverent silence on their part; this is a formal inquiry. Careers are on the line. Possibly lives.

"So they spent three talents on one slave? Big production?" asks the first Director, a green-haired woman who follows her question with a long drag on a marijuana cigarette. Kin stays silent; one of the men behind him nods. "Report on the transaction."

The man speaks. "The subjects approached the stage and bid for a slave - Barimus by name. Their other actions are documented in my report. They traded three talents of jade - three physical talents, the sheets of the stuff, not a paper record. Two of our operatives attempted to tail them, unsuccessfully. I myself showed my credentials to the auction-master. Between myself and Ked, the jade never left our sight from the moment of the transaction's conclusion. I broke off a chip of it for study." He reaches into a pocket, and presents a fragment of the rock for inspection. "My men will contact me if something happens. Odd, in that the stuff has no maker's mark, no foundry marks, or any other evidence of its source. All it had was this.."

And so saying, the man withdraws a piece of paper from his robe. "I copied this mark down from the jade sheets themselves," he explains, unfurling the paper and handing it to a Director. This man examines it, then passes it mutely to his colleagues for a group examination. Three pairs of eyes stare down at the starburst insignia of the Unconquered Sun.
