# Gods of Eden 2005-01-01

Beyond the Grasp was not pleased. It could not be seen, but by the corner of the eye, could not be heard but almost out of earshot, and desired things most secret to be that: those most secret. And here, in Bridal Veil, some Solars have achieved an arcane library, another threat to things unknown. Keeping the power of knowledge out of manipulating hands was the spirit's purpose. And so it came, to barter for certain things to not be accessable. And by chance ended up in a bargain; for things untold, it must escort those very Solars to Heaven's door, and be paraded through the streets, and seen. Definitely not pleased.

As the whispy, unpreceivable thing encourages the Celestial Lions to part the gate, allowing the spirit's companions passage beyond into the streets of Heaven, Chi-Yosh and Davron speak. The trip to Heaven was impromptu; Davron having business to attend, and while the Dawn has a lot of little objectives to accomplish, with Ramar gone, the opportunity to see Spider soon was hard to come by. "Where is it you are headed," asks the rickshaw driver to its paritioners, turning its glassy head back, and allowing the passangers a chance to see through the driver's head at the avenue beyond.

Davron raises his head from communion with Yang - speaking of his errand with the old Sidereal's ghost is reassuring to the would-be reshaper of his own Spark. "I wish to speak with the Department on Abstract Matters, for myself," he says, nodding to Chi-Yosh. "Though I think my companion's destination for the time being...?" The sentence is phrased as a question - he has not inquired of Spider, except briefly.

"The Bureau of Battles," Chi-Yosh tosses towards the driver, before leaning back in the seat. Turning back to Davron, taking this pause in his inner dialog to offer, "I should bring Spider to the Nation at some time, and let him meet the Circle. Even as my Sifu, he is still an assett to the Circle, as a Sidereal, and an associate."

Davron nods slowly. "I think we would all benefit from that... if he is willing to..." he begins, then trails off, glancing down at the ring on his hand. It seems that something about the conversation at hand is of interest to Yang. "What is it?" Davron asks, subvocalizing.

_The Spider?_ asks Yang. _Is it the same one?_ The mental voice of the bound soul goes on to describe a man to Davron, whose description almost exactly fits the sifu Chi-Yosh has found for himself.

Upon hearing confirmation (as Davron repeats this news), Yang continues, his voice excited in Davron's thoughts. _If he's mastered the Spider's gift, which he must have by now, maybe he's also learned the Unweaving Walk. He may be able to help me.. Davron, you assented once to help me find my atonement. I feel that Chi-Yosh's sifu - and Chi-Yosh himself - can help me best now. Will you entrust me to your Circlemate for a time?_

"The Unweaving Walk?" Davron asks softly, puzzled and curious - then removes the ring from his finger and offers it to Chi-Yosh. "It would seem that Yang's pathway to redemption follows your footsteps for a while, rather than mine. Will you bear him?"

Chi-Yosh accepts the ring, palming it for a moment. "I will do what I may to lead him down that road." With that, the Solar rolls the ring down his finger, and snaps it up, so the golden band slides around his digit. Peering at his hand once more, "How ... do I speak to Yang?"

_Like this,_ the Sidereal's voice answers, ringing through Chi-Yosh's thoughts. He sounds like a pleasant enough fellow, unassuming, almost casual - very unlike the few Sidereals the Solar has grown to know.

Chi-Yosh closes his eyes a moment, letting the words, and the feeling they envoke, echo through him. _What might I help you in regards to Spider? You have shown interest in my Sifu._

_The martial arts he studies may provide a way to excuse the crime that led to my ah, current state,_ explains Yang. _Are you willing to ask him to help me? And will you help me as well?_

_If my Sifu will help you, then I will follow., returns Chi-Yosh. _If not, we have two other Sidereal allies, but they may not have the skills you seek.__

_Once dropped off before the Bureau of Battles, Chi-Yosh proceeds down the lane to the gardens that Spider often frequents. Climbing up the stairwell of flowering vines, up to a partail roof of the Bureau, before pushing past the petal gates._

_Beyond, the garden is as the Solar remembers it. He takes a step inside, and his step is halted by a small bamboo stalk which snaps into place against his sole. The Dawn peers down, finding Spider, crouched down, on the other end of the bamboo shaft. A iridescent butterfly continues its flight, passing out from under Chi-Yosh's foot to land on a small, blossoming bulb. "That flower is so hard to breed," says the monk._

_Chi-Yosh isn't sure how to react to that. Except by stepping off the bamboo rod, and carefully places his foot somewhere safe. "Sifu," says the Dawn, "I have come seeking your help, in addition to yearning for your teachings. I am not sure what aid is needed, but..." A wry smile. "Do you know a man named Yang?"_

_The Sidereal thinks about that for a moment. "Yang.. Yang... " A look of recognition, and horror, crosses his face for a moment. "Yes, I do." Another moment is all it takes for his eyes to glance down at the Solar's hands, and see the ring on one finger. Chi-Yosh can even watch the ripples of recognition that flow over his features. "I see," he says at last._

_Chi-Yosh allows this recollection occur without interruption. At least, the student offers a nod. "You also know that he is inside this ring until he has atoned, and one branch to be pruned from this warped bush is found with you and I, he believes. What it is, I do not know." A questioning look is given to the monk._

_"It is for him to speak of, not me," says the Spider, gravely. "But if you wish my help in this, I will assist however I can."_

_Chi-Yosh takes the moment to listen to the voice within his ring, before turning his attention back to Spider. "We must travel to the West. To see what, I do not know, but it is closer to the South west."_

_Spider leads the trip across Heaven, through the streets, then back alleys and loopholes, lanes known only to the Sidereals. The final destination is a Gate made into the street itself that opens to a great stairway. Down the steps to pay homage to the lions before they close the doors, Chi-Yosh and his Sifu are left atop the platform of the clouds, peering down at the tiny cluster of islands._

_Once alone on the platform, Spider steps out of his sandles. Picking one up, the bamboo rod is slipped through the ties, and mildly attached. The process is repeated, before a sandle dangles off of each end. The contraption is dropped off the edge, and moments later, Spider walks off. Down drops the monk, every few eye bats shifting his arm or leg this way or that, diverting his plummet, sending him into a twirl._

_The sandle-and-rod hits the water, sending up an enormous circular splash of water, sinking down low, before Spider lands, a foot on either sandle, as the water 'rebounds' upwards, sending a second shockwave of water upwards. The Sidereal simply looks up, to see Chi-Yosh falling down, to hit the highest tongue of the first ring. He dances down it before dropping to the second ring, sliding down the water before hopping towards the center of the rippling eruption. Spider shifts to stand on one sandle, while Chi-Yosh lands on the other. The two bob up and down, before settling to float on the waves._

_As the ocean settles back to normal, the two Exalts on their tiny raft are claimed by the lap of the tides, and after a few quiet hours, are washed up onto the beach of one of the clustered islands. Spider kicks up his rod, and takes the time to re-fascen the sandals to his feet once more, as Chi-Yosh looks the island._

_The two travel into the night, over land across the island of Gisha, towards the tip to a small town of fishers, traders, and natives. After a rest in hammocs of woven, wild straw, the two move into the gathering of native fishers talking before the sunrise-sail. Spider eases into conversation with the natives, while Yang translates weakly to Chi-Yosh. The monk asks about fish first, the best biting in the area, and tells an anecdote about a little stratta puffer that he tried to catch with his bare hands. After receiving a good laugh all around, the Sidereal procures a dual-canoe, two single-man boats, connected together with stretchable canvas, ropes, and poles, a utility for tables, sails, or hammocs. With enough supplies for a few weeks, the two set out with the early morning fishers._

_The seas are calm, the pair's collective knowledge steering them away from any bad water. _You will travel into the Wyld. Do you have protection?_ Yang chimes in, having been silent for most of the trip. "We must stop." Some string and twine is taken from one of the poaches, and Chi-Yosh weaves it into a circle, interrupted by the twine, which forms symbols. It is cast into the ocean, and soon, the water breaks over the back of a turtle. "I, Chi-Yosh, Uf-ya, seek to know who's territory I tred upon."_

_An hour passes. Then two hours. As the third draws near, the waves break near the little boat the two Celestials call their home. A dolphin has broken the surface, and in moments it takes human shape. A lithe girl's body climbs aboard over the side of the boat, and a green-haired Lunar with feral eyes and intricate tattoos over her naked body squats. She stares from face to face, murmuring words that can barely be heard. ".. .Come... you?"_

_Chi-Yosh bows his head and shoulders, the best gesture he can offer in the small canoe. "Your territory is beautiful." He glances over the flat water. It's likely nicer beneath the waves. "I seek aid. We're going into the Wyld, and need safety from it. A shielding spirit?"_

_The girl mumbles a bit more, then tries with visible effort to speak up and start over. "Only Eos and Ossissa. You .. breathe under water?"_

_Chi-Yosh opens his mouth, then closes it. He is certain there are gifts and hearthstones which permit such a thing, a trick he does not know. Something which he should learn before the trip to Azel. Finally, he shakes his head, before shooting a questioning look to Spider._

_The Sidereal shrugs a bit. The Lunar girl shakes her head. "Honored senior, you will need to deal with the pirates Eos and Ossissa. They only travel to the Wyld. I could hold to their keel and ride under the surface, but you will need to board their ship."_

_Chi-Yosh frowns. Pirates. And those who ride into the Chaos. "Please, show us the way to the ship of Eos and Ossissa. You will be appreciated." He will find a way to thank the possible Nain-ya, if in nothing than something to boast of. Almost as an afterthought, "Who is it that leads us?"_

_"I am Seawind, but I.. I was once a girl on the nearby islands," she replies, finding herself more confident with above-surface language. "I have no territory yet, I only felt compelled to come here."_

_Chi-Yosh gives the Lunar a smile. "I see. Thank you, Seawind. Please, lead us to the pirates you speak of." Now, what can they offer these pirates to take them into the Wyld?_

After some discussion with Seawind about Eos and Ossissa, she leads Chi-Yosh and his Sifu out into the trading lanes of the Guild. They wait for the cargo ship that Seawind assures is a half-day away. As soon as they are alerted to the boat's approach, Chi-Yosh begins to break the boat, shattering it here and there, and tearing various segments off. The cargo finds them in tattered remains of their vessel. He sends a distress signal, waving a tattered bit of canvas, and flags the boat down long enough for Spider to yell a quick explanation: Fishers, attacked by a sea monster, will offer guard duty in exchange for a ride.

The Guild ship is wary. Clever, or dangerous pirates have pulled such tricks. The men are allowed on deck, under guard and wary eye. However, as the ship is pulling off, a triangular fin knifes through the water, and someone on the starboard bow sees the dark, taletell shape of the man-eating fish. It goes so far as to surface, thrashing its head back and forth, a knife stuck in its snout.

The sight of the shark is rather convenient, but hard to argue with. The pair are given a pair of spears, and put on watch at the front of the boat. It's a safe enough place in case they do prove to be bothersome - there's someone in the crow's nest with a bow after all - but otherwise, they are left alone. Hours pass. When meal time arrives, they, like the rest of the general crew, aren't allowed into the galley. Instead, the food is brought up in bowls, and passed around. Here, the pair learn from picking up little bits of conversation that there's several influential Southern passangers aboard, who are under guard. From the sounds of it, the cargo isn't a grand affair, except for some gems rumored to be birthed by a spirit at the Pole of Fire.
