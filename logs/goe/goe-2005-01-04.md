As "guards", the two Exalts are the equivalent of armed crew. What little Chi-Yosh knows about sailing has come from Ramar, and often dealt with the air ship. However, with Spider at his side, the Solar fakes it enough to make the nearby crew suspicious of his seamanship, but they're payed to run the boat, not keep an eye on hired arms. Creatures and wyld-twisted pirates alike can come from below, boring through the hull, or climbing up the side. Thus when not tieing rope and other duties, the guards circle the deck, watching the waterline suspiciously, and every few hours trading with men below watching the hull and cargo bay. The men up top are armed with a harpoon and trusty cleaving axe, while those below keep thin, sharp prods and tools to deal with any bores.

More action occurs below; the guards have to keep watch not just for outside threats, but those from within. It is not unheard of that a pirate sneaks one of their comrads aboard as a passanger, to investigate the ship's procedures, weaknesses, and so on, only to strike at the critical areas when attacked, or try to sabotage the ship. And there is still the potential of lone wolves booking passage and stealing what they may.

The merchanter sails through the midnight-drenched waters of the Outer Sea, floating gently and shining like a gaily-decorated tea house. Numerous lanterns scattered around the vessel and affixed to the hull illuminate the surrounding ocean. Beyond the reach of this comforting light, sea and sky are equally devoid of anything. Only the gentle creaking of wood and the murmurs of men seem to keep the ship from being swallowed up by nothingness.

On deck, the Solar is playing a game of bones with the sailor next to him, though only half paying attention to the fortune-telling game. Partially hanging in the rigging, he is watching over the waterline, finding himself thinking of the Nation. Spider has been placed on a different shift then he, at the moment below in the crew's quarters, sleeping. The move had came on the second day, a simple rotation and the Dawn suspects a security measure, but who knows. It is the Guild.

Off the port side, the soothing sound of waves lapping becomes stronger. Other sounds become audible; first, they resemble seagulls cawing and circling, but gradually these come more to resemble some impossibly beautiful song, coming from the very throat of a siren. The music swells like a tidal wave approaching shore. To port, it seems as though the strains of song are becoming visible in the air, like trails of some fatally enticing faery light. The lines draw themselves into trails; the trails become shapes. The song becomes mighty indeed, enough to wake every man-jack aboard, and as the lookout rings an alarm, the glowing lights off port resolve themselves into the lines of a fellow seafarer. The new arrival flies pirate colors - it is none other than a ship of the fleet of Eos and Ossissa!

Chi-Yosh is on guard the moment he hears the music. There is one entertainer aboard the Guild ship, and the dancer sounds nothing like that. Taking up the harpoon dangled in the net, he watches the sorcery of the song unfold itself into something more tangible. Upon spotting the pirate ship, the plan is a success, to this point. Now the Dawn must find Spider, and keep him alive, and at the same time not draw enough attention and wrath from the pirates to have him executed. A feat for an Exalt, indeed.

Chi-Yosh moves towards port, and moving in a slow diagnial towards the hatch leading below deck. As the pirate ship grows closer, he pushes towards the edge, but slowly works his way around the men, looking edgy, shifting his harpoon back and forth. Simply a guard looking for a perfect opening, waiting uneasily for the battle to start. A cursory glance of the deck is given, looking for Spider, before he steps back, flanking the hatch that leads below deck.

Coming in close, the pirate ship has its sides turned to the cargo, and the air is filled with thunder and lightning no spirit would like, sails and rigging exploding like spiderweb beneath a broom. A volley of arrows leap the distance between the ships, bringing a score of cargo men. Chi-Yosh cannot be found among the ready at the rail. In fact, he can't be found anywhere the eye might peer; crouched down on the starboard side of the hatch downwards is the Dawn, hidden Essence keeping him out of sight and danger, having taken refuge in the confusion. He watches, waiting for either the Sidereal master, whom he suspects will not emerge until forced, or the Terrestrials themselves.

The cargo's deck bucks beneath a roar that rends the air, followed suit by a flash that displays the skeletons inside their bodies. Wood shrieks in protest as a crescent blade of brilliance sends the mast cracking, one of the outward limbs destroyed, canvas dropping like a tent over men in its wake. As sailors adjust to the Gods' fury, a warning is thrown up on the other ship; their massive, cylindrical beast twisting, parts spinning and tilting, as the man behind its protective glass canopy swivels the barrel. A second crescent tears throough the air, this time washing the deck in a nova's fire, carving a messy circle and sprinkling the waters beyond.

In the wake of the blast, a wave of lined hooks pepper the cargo's railing. The shriek of winches fill the air, while other ropes are pulled by simple muscle. By the time the defenders are aware, an alarming cry goes up before the side-arm axes begin to thunk heavily across the rail, hacking at thick, brine-soaked rope threaded through with iron wire, bringing shrieks and sparks from the axes' fall. A volley of harpoons nail across the deck, peppering men and wood, to stick up like a forest of hafts. Another, deadlier volley of arrows weed through the cargo's deck, before heavy, wooden planks drop between the two ships, and roaring men charge across.

Spider is aware of his weakness in this battle. However, one of the Guild lieutenants, having had to shuffle on his armor, finds the sailor below deck. Being put at swordpoint makes a man less arguable, and so the Sidereal is up the hatch, and on the deck, the clank of armor behind him, and past him. Jerking to the side as something slaps his foot, a look back finds Chi-Yosh, standing up. "Go, over the rail." Without question, the monk moves back, and as the boat bucks and pitches when the ships crash together, he falls backwards. Below, the dark waters are lit by a caste mark, before it is snuffed out. Within moments, an arm has his waist, dragging him yards from the ship, and then up for air.

Scanning the pirates' deck, Chi-Yosh spots no sign of the daring, bold moves the stories tell of Eos and Ossissa, nor sign of jade or Charm flarings. And so the Dawn moves into the fray, keeping his guard, staying on the defensive, and hacking away at choice pirates, and those who assail him. He could save more of the defenders, but considering the fate of hostages, they are better off killed in battle than the meal of a Fae, or tortured by the Wyld.

After less than a minute of fighting, the Guild's mercenaries are gone. The initial vollies took down half, and the chaotic melee did not take long. The remaining sailors are not warriors, and either fall or, the weakest and newest to the sea, drop their arms. After only a few choice moments of Chi-Yosh in battle, he draws back to starboard, and waves his axe in the air, before moving forward, to become surrounded by swordsmen, and he too loses his axe. As the pirates surround Chi-Yosh, several of them startle as a hand slaps over the railing, followed by a second. Two of the raiders rush over, grabbing hold of the man to haul him onto the deck, and sieze him at swordpoint. "I think we caught ourselves a big one," comments one to the other.

Two lines of captives are marched onto the pirate vessel, where long rows of shackles await. Up from the depths of the ship stir several people in finery, with complections of the South, and the Center. They put up a bit of a fuss, but soon become complient with a few rogues on either side. After all the captives are wearing heavy iron, and being sorted out, climbing down into the raider's vessel, the cargo is dragged up, sorted, cataloged, and brought aboard, as tow-lines are binded to the merchanter.

Traveling through the edge of the Wyld is calm, if not odd. Flocks of birds take to the skies, their feathers rising off the back like sails to catch the wind. Amorphous shadows lurk below the surface, before a spout rises above the waves and spits something ugly, which sticks to the birds and weighs them down till they are drawn underwater.

As night falls, the sea becomes choppy. First it roils and pitches, the waves gliding and parting, taking the forms of lovers' limbs and bodies contorting across the water's surface. But then the sea grows angry, becoming serpents that coil and slash outwards, rearing open to bare white-foamed splashes across each other. The crew battens down below deck, or tethered to the deck above. As the rage goes on, tunnels of water that arch high overhead form as ocean currents themselves dredge upwards, drawing the ship past the horrid spots, or allowing the wooden vessel to bank off of them.

Rather than daybreak drawing near on the horizon, it comes from above like a spotlight that sweeps outwards, hitting the lapping water and piercing below, turning the water near white. As the morning spreads like a ripple outwards, fish can be seen swimming within the glassy water, until, as the light passes over the boat and onwards, the whole ocean seems to be translucent, right to the bottom. Creatures and anamolies of all colors fill the many layers, some so far down they appear only as specks of spice. Far, far in the distance below is the slate of the ocean floor, which ripples and rolls like something deeper is stirred from slumber.

Pinkish red clusters of coral, like lumpy, brittle cages bob in the water. Growing inside the clusters themselve are slimy greenish black plants, their tendrils and leaves fanning outwards. In some places the tendrils have wrapped around eachother, drawing coral bergs together. As the ship steers between the bergs, lines of kelp drag over the boat, before rising to stick to across sea-soaked wood. Tendrils of the seaweed lance forth, while the bergs themselves draw closer. All across the ship, men begin to hack at the highest lines of weed, while sharp bowmen pick off the lower ones.

However, the weeds are growing too thick, and slowing the ship increasingly. Then the Essence cannon roars to life, obliterating the coral clusters clinging to the ship, causing the seaweed's tentacles to relent, allowing the ship to escape.

In one of the cavities of the ship, behind a hatch guarded by Wyld-strengthened guards, are chains anchored to the walls. These chains hold their captives onto benches, providing a tether in case the ship gets tossed around. Luminescent fish swim around in glass jugs anchored to the walls, providing enough light for the captured to see one another. A bucket of minced garlic sits at the door, offering some relief from the stench of the room.

Initially, the talk in the ships bowels was frantic; the haughtiness rantings of the Guild's privilaged passengers, the angry boasts of the surviving guards, or the worried, hsuh rumors traded about Eos and Ossissa, and highly speculating assumptions. But as the trip progresses, silence and discussion comes in waves. Occasionally, to keep spirits up, one sailor will start a drinking song and get everyone gets in, or a discussion will pop up over there, or here.

Opting to avoid any topics of suspicion, Chi-Yosh and Spider for the most part are silent, sans discussion of their origins quietly. For his part, the Dawn ponders what he will do when the ship reaches its destination. From what he can tell by the stories, the terrestrials are daring and prideful. He has access to resources they would find useful. However, the key is finding a proper pitch to offer that potential. Greed has its potential, offered as an interesting wager. Now, to get there, and make his presence known.

The island hideout of Sesus Ossissa and Eos Atitha is a temperate paradise. The sky overhead twists with clouds formed into swordsmen and sorcerers and sailors who wage some kind of perpetual, slow-motion war. The winds are peaceful, calm, and just soothingly cool enough to moderate the heat of the Sun. As Gemela Windrose's vessel sails into its accustomed berth, her men come down the ladders and into the brig area. A great deal of shouting and herding follows; Chi-Yosh and the Spider, along with others aboard the doomed merchanter, are escorted onto the deck.

"Yer puttin' ashore on the Obsidian Hands!" one of the senior mates bellows at the captives. "You lot'll never see the true light o' day again, I reckon!" And he lets out a hearty, unpleasant laugh as the captives are roughly jerked along by their chains to trot down the gangplank of the _Declaration_.

As the captives are lead further into the tropical lair, they are taunted by the riches surrounding them. A palm-tree off to the side is peppered with jeweled daggers stabbed into the trunk, each baring a necklace, rich bangle, or other incrusted finery. A forest of artwork provides a boasting ground for lounging sailors served drinks from casks mounted on their chairs. It's all held just out of touch by iron shackles and cutlass armed thugs.

All this finery is marched past, to a sunken, man-made valley, where cages made for two suspend above the ground. The captives are shuffled inside the tight packed rows of pins, and cranked up, in perfect view of the bow armed guards on either side of the "valley", and just out of reach of the growling, angry dogs released once the last man is shuffled into his cell.

Chi-Yosh waits until five minutes have passed before he turns to his "cell" mate. There's not a lot of room inside the tiny bamboo cage to maneuver. "When I ask you to dangle your feet out of the bottom of the cage, do so. When I say pull your legs up, you do so. Understand?" The man, a young sailor, replies, "Think I'm going to help you? You're crazy." Essence gathers through Chi-Yosh, to the point o fmaking his caste mark glimmer faintly at his brow. Squatting down, the Dawn simply stands up quickly and rams both palms into the ceiling of the tiny cage, shattering it. The sailor stares at his cellmate. "Okay, I'm crazy too."

Chi-Yosh leaps out and atop the swaying cell. Arrows meet him there, but the Dawn catches them, waving their tips tauntingly at the archers. "Dangle your legs," he calls down. The sailor squats, stuffing his feet through the slots in the bamboo floor. As if on cue, the dogs circling the cell begin to jump and snap at the exposed feet. "Raise them up," comes the Dawn's request, before he swiftly kicks the top of the pole. With a crunch, it crumbles, sending the cage plummeting onto the snarling canines. Chi-Yosh is running across the other cages in his row, before diving off, and right into the face of an archer, clapping his hands viciously around the bow and breaking it in two. The Caste mark blazes atop his brow. "Tell your friend behind me to hold his arrows; I do not think he wants to eat them. Then, I'd like to have a talk with your bosses."

Instead, the guard reaches for his sword. Chi-Yosh is faster, snatching it out of the sheath and wheeling around to slice the on-coming arrow in half. He shifts and kicks the guard in the stomach, before falling into a crouch to wag his blade at three men who heard the commotion. They end up chasing the Dawn as he runs, only to snag hold of a palm tree, whirling around to introduce the lead man to his foot. The ring of swords rise as his sword meets the two men in a parry, before backing up and waiting. One makes a lunge, only to be scooped up by the escape, his hand gripped at the wrist and used to fight off his comrad, only to be caste aside, and kiss the Solar's pummel, before a similar fate befalls the other.

A problem arises; for every man he drops, two seem to notice the escaped captive, and are sounding the alarm. Several close on his tail as he slices open the side of a lunch tent, and dives inside. One of the guards steps in front of the impromptu door, only to be dragged through, and thrown into a table, sending food and utensiles into the air. A hard-shelled fruit is tossed up, which Chi-Yosh keeps in the air by smacking it with the flat of his sword, only to kick it into the chin of the first guard inside the tent. It bounces high, only to be batted into the air again, and sent at the second, a woman who cleaves the fruit in half. The same fate befalls a plate coming her way, as does the roast boar, except her blade catches in the thick meat. She glances down, shaking the pork off of her sword, and unable to bring the blade up against a foot.

Outside the tent, a small militia has gathered, a fence of steel that barely holds back as the glowing man bursts out. He pauses, before standing up straight. "Now that I have your attention, I'd like to talk to-" A spear-barer rushes him, only to lose his spear, have it snapped in half, and is soundly cracked across the back of the knee with it. Stepping back, spearpoint in one hand, makeshift cudgel in the other, Chi-Yosh glowers. "Eos and Ossissa. Now."

Several of the higher-ranking pirates (distinguished by the adornments of jade they wear) have come running down the road that leads to the top of the mountain behind the Obsidian Hands, and the pagoda that sits atop that mountain. They draw weapons of steel and jade, and point them at the would-be escapee. "Announce yourself and your business!" a hard-edged woman, seemingly their captain, calls out.

Anima and Caste mark blaring, Chi-Yosh casts aside his weapons, and crosses his arms. "I am Sundering Fists of the East, and I come to offer great bounty to those known as Eos and Ossissa."

"You will march with us. You will be blindfolded and gagged," the woman says, sounding cold and mistrustful. She gestures, and the Exalted soldiers with her trot forward to take up wary stances around Chi-Yosh.

---

The pagoda of Sesus Ossissa and Eos Atitha rests at the pinnacle of the great mountain that this island paradise is shaped out of. The road to it is winding and steep, and only Chi-Yosh's able footing keeps him from tripping over the rough-hewn path. At every point he can feel the lethal caress of the pirates' weapons at the vital points of his body.

Within the pagoda itself, an opulence that could rival the palaces of the Guild itself awaits - and perhaps that is the point. Waiting casually is a handsome, almost beautiful man dressed in the finery of the Realm mixed in equal proportion with the splendid barbarism of Western fashion. And with him is a stern, fire-eyed woman in a long and lovely dress. Both are openly armed.

Stepping forward, a lieutenant delivers a sharp salute with his spear, before giving it a sweep. "We have brought you the Solar, Sundering Fists, who demands your ears." A snap of his boots, before he steps back, making room for the Exalt to step forward. "I have come a long way to find the best travelers of the Chaos Sea," says Sundering Fists, as he prowls forward, "And I hear all around the tales of your deeds. Further into the wyld waters is something I seek, something which I will repay once I have returned beyond the twisting veil with. Something I would reward by having anything requested carved from the chaos, that can be taken anywhere in Creation without coming apart. Or the Guild, served any way pleased. There are many things that can be. And those things could be free, without anything on your part."

The captain of the _Declaration_, the ship Chi-Yosh arrived on, is Gemella Windrose. Now Chi-Yosh perceives her presence, as she steps from behind a veiled curtain with an anguished look upon her face. She glances at Eos and Ossissa for just a moment, then withdraws. The two Exalted pirates glance at each other; the silent message has been received. "Brave words for a common traveler," sneers Ossissa. "Especially one on a Guild vessel."

The Solar simply smiles. "If you want to catch a fish, do you dive in and look for one to grab, or do you bait a hook? Were I care about any on the Guild vessel, or any aboard, the _Declaration_ would have limped home."

Eos Atitha draws her wavecleaver daiklave - a weapon unique to the West - and adopts a combat stance almost immediately. "You'll regret those words, slave!" she spits. "Nobody insults Eos and Ossissa, much less in their own home!" She moves to step forward, but the man with her - Sesus Ossissa, Realm-born and Realm-bred with all of the Realm's gifts - holds out a restraining hand. "An insult, but not necessarily an empty boast," he suggests. "What is it you suggest, Easterner?"

Only until after Ossissa has spoken does Sundering Fists turn his attention to the Realm-born pirate. "A duel. I against the both of you. The first side to three hits wins." A glance to the inpassioned woman. "If I lose, you can have what I offer, and I will leave with my tail between my legs, bested by the greatest pirates the West may provide. If I win, you shall have what I offer, in exchange for safe passage of me and mine to and from the destination I seek."

"If you lose, you will not leave this island with your soul intact," warns Eos, darkly.
