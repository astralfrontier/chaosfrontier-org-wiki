# Gods of Eden 2005-01-08

Waves crash and lap at the salt-stained bow of the boat as it plows through the water, before swerving broadly to the side. Below, the water is gone like a great bowl, exposing reefs and the wreckage of one ship to the open air. Crabs scuttle about the ocean floor, wearing shattered chests and debris upon their backs.

Eos Atitha straightens the sheath of her daiklave and dives over the ship's edge, swimming like a seal down, only to slide out of the veil of water into open air, landing in a crouch on the sea floor. Sesus Ossissa and the Solar are next, the Terrestrial's motions almost graceful, through the water, and into the air once his soaking form breaks the surface. His counterpart is more swift, however, and begins surveying the field as he lands. The fourth to come is a rough-edged man with half a beard, the agreed-upon judge of this competition.

Throwing a knife at random, the Judge's blade sticks into a crag in the hard rock floor. The combatants make a triangle as they move around the blade, before moving back three yards. Counting begins to come from the impartial; to fifteen, a long enough time to draw up any charms. If not, it's your hide.

As Essence gathers, drawing him into a ready stance and priming his agility, the Solar looks over his opponents. The woman is only as agile as a sailor needs to be, her strong and quick, a true swordswoman. Her companion's fingers brush over the glittering jade and glass bow, as one would soothe a hunting dog before the horn. He's a threat at range, but the two 'klaves at his waist prove that up close is no less dangerous.

"Fifteen." The Solar explodes into motion, charging towards Eos in a circular path, rather than full on. The Realmsman leaps back, onto the front of the ship's carcass, nimble steps drawing him up the skewed prow, plucking two arrows from a sea-snake skin quiver and letting fly. Stopping mid-run, the Dawn jumps up, over the incoming arrow and kicks it to the ground, only to turn, catching the second as he falls into a crouch. The first is scooped up, and Ossissa's arrows become heavy darts, the hurled threat batted away easily by the stout daiklave which Eos smirks above.

Scuttling like a crab, Eos darts in and begins to lash her sword in a jagged upward diagnel, but the Solar grabs the back of the blade as it rises, letting the momentum guide it out, and leave her open. A burning flare rips through the air, herding the Dawn into a ducking weave that chases him from Eos's blade, even though the arrow strikes water in a geyzering burst. However he's up again, sliding almost up against her body for a headbutt which connects with her crossguard in a savage punch.

"Point to Eos," yells the judge.

Before the two Terrestrials can prepare, the Dawn erupts into the air, sailing backwards, wheeling around to pounce upon the prow. His foot comes down in a vicious kick, shattering the rotted wood, and sending pole and Exalt down. A stone below meets the middle of the prow, Ossissa one end, and Sundering fists the other as he slams down upon it. The sawing motion pitches the pirate into the air, over the boat's front. Snatching some rotted rigging, which tears away, Ossissa swings around, and in the same moment drops his bow and unleashes the dual daiklaves, his swing descending upon the Dawn, who at the pirate's last moments of descent snatch up the prow, and thrust it like an oversized spear.

As the Realmsman falls onto his back, dazed, Eos explodes off of an outcropping of rock, her dive sending the stone into rubble as her blade leads like a molten comet. It shears through the prow brought to parry, and as the Solar scurries away, she simply reverses the original strike, rolling the momentum in a sweep that follows the pitiful dodge, only to stop at the flat of Ossissa's stolen sword. Essence boils outwards as the two lock swords, glaring at one another over the weapons. "Point to the Solar," calls the judge over the grid-lock.

Ossissa rises, collecting his remaining blade as the two square off. The Dawn soon abandons the battle of strength, jumping up onto the ship. "My blade," calls the pirate with a wry grin as he nimbly runs up the ship's face. Sundering Fists tosses it to Ossissa, who brings both 'klaves to bare in a crashing hurricane of slashes, stabs, and feints. They are evaded with ease, the Solar darting this way and that. But his dodges are a herding maneuver. As the last feint of Ossissa sweeps in, the Solar grabs beneath the guard, and yanks the pirate into him for a clinching hug, even as the pair twirl, to meet Mulberry, the stout blade of Eos, all ready in motion, only to have it rake across the pirate's back. Once more the Dawn matches eyes with the firey Eos.

Discarding the Realmsman, Sundering Fists backs Eos up the broken mast with his own series of fast attacks, the woman offered no room to return. It continues until her feet brush the edge of the shattered pole. In a brief moment, she lunges in with an overhead chop, the Solar grabbing her wrist. Only she drops the sword, catching it with her other hand and to sweep it across his gut. Naturally the Solar dives back, and into a quartet of arrows.

Weaving through the first two are easy, but the third clips into a thigh, and as the fourth evasion is overstretched, Sundering Fists plummets to the deck, and bursts through it to the ocean floor below. Rolling over on the rough rock seabed, the Solar snaps his hands up and claps them over Mulberry's blade as it nearly plants into him, Eos landing in a squat above. But Sundering Fists jerks his shoulders to the side and lets go, the tip burying into earth as he snaps up, forehead meeting the firey woman's nose with a crunch.

"Hold! Enough," announces Ossissa, sharply. Eos staggers backward, holding her nose tightly with one hand, eyes filled with pain and rage. Her partner approaches her, and lays a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Only a duel, _abou_, only a duel. I think we'll profit well," he murmurs to her. Then, more loudly: "We are the greatest sailors in the world, and you fight like the demonspawn that old tales call you. You've shown your ability in battle. Now it's time for you to acknowledge us in return! We sail to the Wyld!"

---

The _Unveiling_ is the ship of Sesus Ossissa, and with its silksteel sails and cunningly contrived barriers of sorcery, it is the ideal ship to sail into the mysteries of the Wyld. Eos will remain on the Obsidian Hands, as one half of the partnership must be present to continue the gruesome business of piracy. Of the pair's captains, Gemela Windrose expresses interest in sailing as well. Chi-Yosh, the Spider, and Ossissa's hand-picked crew of sailors board the worthy vessel, and in short order it sets sail.

With some convincing, Chi-Yosh brings Seawind aboard. He does not know where he is going, but the Lunar witch will know. Feeding her what cryptic information Yang provides, it is a reasonable enough ploy; with the general mistrust of the Lunars from the crew, she is perceived not as the lowest of Lunar rank, but of a dangerous, mysterious threat, whose powers are only legends.

Most of the trip for Chi-Yosh and his is spent below deck. Seawind is glad to be doing more than following close to the bottom of the boat, and after getting more familiar with the surface tongue, tells of beneath the sea. When left alone, Spider and his pupil begin discussing the nature of the first lesson in the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation, the understanding of Orichaclum's nature, the link of the Four Magical Materials.

Course changing by the chaotic winds, the _Unveiling_ pursues onwards, avoiding an isle no larger than it, where a one-eyed giant waves his angry fist and calls for conversation. Further on, where stalks of eyes rise above the water to watch the ship trail by, spouts of hissing steam herald golden whales, and the morning mists solidify like gravy, slowing the ship to a crawl through the waves.

Storms in the deeper Wyld are much more dangerous; the choppy seas on the trek to the island are nothing compared to storms of screaming raindrops, waves and wind of hands that toss the ship like a child's toy, and lightning that plays out illuminated patterns across the sky, lighting up the snarling faces of the clouds as they shriek down the power. But the sorcerers placed upon the boat keep it together, and most importantly, moving.

Each crew member was picked for a reason; the best to handle under pressure, evading the worst of the storm and keeping the lines working. A helmsman that can steer through anything, as the ship draws towards rocky outcroppings that shift and stir, closing around the _Unveiling_ like the dense forest beneath a malevolent elemental. The best climbers and shots, as birds of flaming sticks shriek and try to land upon the vessel, only to be snuffed out by buckets of wet sand and arrows soaked in sap.

Through it all, Yang guides Chi-Yosh and Seawind, giving them obscure hints and strange portents that would sound like a drug-addled dreamer's ravings if it weren't for the very sights he describes appearing before the Solar. More than once it would seem to the uninitiated observer that the ship was bound for a certain, if nameless, doom. But Ossissa knows his crew and his vessel, and his men have placed their lives in his hands before. Despite waterfalls of acid and onrushing tsunami waves that explode into flocks of doves that take to the air, the _Unveiling_ follows the dead Sidereal's course faithfully.

---

Emerging from a haze of mist, the battered but seaworthy vessel finds itself almost floating across clearer water. From the mizzenmast, a lookout hails the deck with an urgent, "Calm ho!" All hands rush to the sides to see what prodigy the Wyld has left for them this day.

And at first it seems like just another Wyld prodigy - the _Unveiling_ sails out of the fog bank toward towering columns of shimmering water supported by nothing but their own weight. But as the Wyld fog parts completely, it becomes clear that the construction - for such it clearly is - could not have maintained its order and stability against the buffeting of the Wyld (or even the more normal laws that govern water) without some sort of deliberate magical working.

The columns glitter in the sunlight from a suddenly clear sky, and arches and spans connect them with each other and to buildings with walls of sparkling white. In fact, the entire edifice is nothing less than an entire _city_, constructed of solid water.

Time has taken its toll here and there, of course, just as it would the ruins of any old city - although where there would be fallen towers and crumbling masonry in a mundane ruin, there are simply _gaps_, where the ancient sorcery that maintained the shape of the waves has failed and released the water back to the ocean. But the grandeur and majesty of First Age architecture is unmistakable in what remains - perhaps, overbearingly so.

The city and columns are not merely eaten by the passing of time. There is something else here that gnaws and chews through the power that binds them. It is not one plague, but an army of poxes working in concert.

Nearest the ship it manifests as a flatness on the sea, a slick that appears gray at first, but as one looks closer, reveals itself as almost a void. Where it draws near a column talons of nothingness have attached themselves. The wounds they have dug into the water scream as if stabbed with steel just taken off forge coals.

To the left and right are still more variations. The most dramatic are strands of light that creep up into the sky, waving slightly in an unseen breeze like glowing kelp. Where they draw near to a wall far above, they lean towards it, dividing into filaments so fine that the naked eye cannot clearly make them out. Their work is unmistakable, however. They pluck at essence itself, tearing at the solid forms of creation and consuming what is left behind. A particularly violent burst causes a flash of essence energy followed by a scream louder than thunder as the essence forming the wall is forcibly twisted into a shout of every word for wall in every tongue that has ever been.

Climbing into a small boat attached to the ship, Chi-Yosh and his sifu begin to lower it down. Seawind, much to the crew's unease, had opted to stay in the ship after witnessing the Pox upon the liquid construction, not trusting evil that blatantly lurks on the water. "I am accompaning you," calls Ossissa from the rail, and with a gesture from the Solar, he jumps down into the boat. From there, it is a cautious navigation from the ship, towards one of the many docks ringing the city itself. Eyes are kept open, wary of the creeping, consuming sickness, and anything beneath the depths. Finally, the docks are reached, a rope tossed over and tied to a translucent pillar.

As the boat reaches the dock, three giant tendrils of some dripping oil erupt from the waters around the small boat, arching up into the sky like a dome over the people onboard. They linger there for a moment, and then along the entire length of the strange limbs eyes of all manner of beasts open, staring at those below. They stay there only for a few moments, and then simply fall apart, their spattered remains somehow never reaching the boat nor its occupants and once again the water is quiet.

As the _Unveiling_'s launch sails near to one of the piers at last, the walls of the buildings, and the city walls and gate beyond the landing, prove to be made of something like solidified sea foam, which grants opacity to the normally clear substance of which it is constructed. And strength, as well - the nearly-invisible bubbles act like a honeycomb, redistributing forces throughout the structure.

Now uncomfortable and wary, the team of three slide out of the boat, testing the strength of the liquid platform and taking stock of their surroundings. Now is likely a wise time to initiate long-lasting charms, wary of the defenses and the encounters of things taking up residence in the ruins. As they proceed up the pier toward the gates, Chi-Yosh mentally nuddges Yang. _Some idea of what we're walking into would be appreciated._

_This was the capital city of the region called Alacian,_ replies Yang softly. _Erected by the Solars principally for themselves, their aquatic Lunar mates, and a host of Water-Aspected Terrestrials. Whole stretches of living area used to exist under the sea here, warmed by volcanic vents. Now they are gone.. But the city itself was alive. And perhaps still is._

The gates are four times the height of a man and would allow two war chariots to pass abreast, and their foam is patterned in a bas-relief depiction of figures in heroic poses, including one with a Twilight caste mark on his brow raising a hand toward a fountain of water - probably a representation of the founding of the city.

In the citadel's prime, the gates would have been open during the day, to allow for commerce. Now it is sealed solidly shut, and the watchtowers on either side show no sign of habitation.

Inspecting the gate, Chi-Yosh wisely opts to not touch, just yet. _Is there a way to open the gates without force? A word of power?_

_The authority I once held is gone. But reveal your Caste Mark,_ counsels Yang.

Chi-Yosh should have thought of that himself. The sunburst upon his brow bursts into light, the glowing mark shining over the foam-crafted doors, shedding new light upon the delicate architecture of its carving.

The gates tremble, then slide outward as the glow of Sunrise warms them. Where once they might have opened silently, they now make a whispering sound - not the grinding of stone on stone, but more like the trickle of a babbling brook, or light surf against a shoreline. But open they do, revealing a broad street lined with majestic edifices, some open, some closed, all deserted.

Half a block ahead on the right, there is a gaping pit in the side of a building where its spell failed, but most are still standing, with the ornate columns and cyclopean architecture that marked the late First Age, the height of the pride of the Solar Realm.

The opening of the gate draws an instant response from the poxes, and from the air above comes two fleets of some manner of flying things, shaped like glowing serpents with wings formed of barbed quills. Their target is past those seeking entry. They hunger for what lies beyond. Their charge is ended as abruptly as it began, however. The moment they penetrate the gates they simply fall, bereft of whatever power gave them existance to begin with. Should they be inspected now, their forms shall appear to be made entirely out of marble.

Beyond the gates proceeds the trio, who peer down alleys, into gaps torn by the ravages of time and sickness, and in between drink in the First Age wonder. Chi-Yosh is reminded of the Fae city, with its beautiful statues and marvels that were carved out of dreams, that fleetingly melt through the grasp of reality. _What is it we seek? A central building or tower?_

_It is the Alacian Manse, sometimes called the Soul of the Sea-City,_ replies Yang in Chi-Yosh's thoughts. _It, and several subsidiary Manses, do nothing but energize the structure here._

As the Dawn pauses, seeming to pay less attention to his surroundings, Ossissa turns to regard their exit, an arrow nooked. While the threats of the strange citadel worry it like a dog to a bone, there is likely the promise of things most precious, stored away in the depths. However, one cannot claim them and not claim life. Meanwhile, the Spider patiently scans the skies, feeling all around him. The monk waits for specific query; despite the Wyld all around, the city is touched by fate, sans the rot that eats at it. Even so, such a creation is something to not take lightly, warped so by ages and unknown factors.

The surface of the street suddenly bursts into a boil before them, and three fountains of water erupt from the bubbles and coalesce into solidified humanoid form, rainbows refracting through their crystalline structure. Perceiving the three Exalts, glittering swords extrude from their hands, and they rush the party, calling **St-st-stop the, the, thief!** in stuttering, wobbly Old Realm, as if their speech centers had become corrupted by time.

As the watery defenders rush forward, they are intercepted by a pair of arrows. One is discarded by the flat of a blade. The motion is slow, time and tampering with their purpose having worn away strength; the second bolt hits a sword, but simply tears through it, into the liquid body beyond, breaking the surface and sending the solider spilling out like a broken bottle. One is still coming strong, which meets Chi-Yosh head on, the Solar launching a swift bombardment of blows that leaves it shattered. He turns, to see the final one baring down on Spider. Hastily he dives into the creature itself, filling its frame for a moment before flexing outwards, simply exploding it in a shockwave of wetness.

The remains and shards of the automata remain for a moment, then dissolve into puddles of water, rippling and glistening as they spread along the street before being subsumed once more by solidity.

Spider gives his pupil a look, as though the Solar should be more aware of the danger to him. Giving an apologetic nod, Chi-Yosh continues onward, leading through the broad, main avenue. For the first time, he starts looking with an Occultist's eye, picking up the signs of things beyond his understanding. First Age sorceries have been lost beyond the ages, only splinters of their true power remaining, and becoming what has lasted. The ancestors of signs that draw power seem like a vein that transmits life. This could be the proper path towards the Manses.

While the trio proceed, the potential of First Age wonders does surge up. Not the search, so much as a street-side inspection for where they may be housed. While the city's manse and subsequent others are a proper place for a magical storehouse or armory, grand homes and even shops may have some remnant as nothing more than a book or craft from the Age before. The Solar especially keeps his eye open for actual rubble, or aquatic pieces of masonry. While the likelihood is low, a sample of opportunity would be good to bring back to Davron would be useful.

The search for likely places has two likely destinations. The most accessible is a grand construction of glinting columns. The books of the city's library can be seen through many windows, but it seems that they are only for looking. The library is besieged, with wave upon wave of automata guards rising from the waters, battling no less than thirteen poxes. The conflict is far from silent. Here waters boil away as the defenders of the city are torn down by a burning cloud, gouts of liquid fire spouting from it constantly, but as fast as it destroys those in its way, it makes no ground.

Further away a human form with green flesh throws itself against the tide of automata. The skin of the pox is covered with spines of light, and where they touch the essence of the automata is torn away, leaving little more than a puddle. Each touch causes the vestiges of creation itself to groan here as their power is consumed.

Cities are often structured with the most important buildings often on the hill, or in the center, the hub of life and purpose, where all streets convene. While Manse architecture is not his forte, the Solar has an idea that the placement of a necessary manse is likely similar. His searching leads him to a smaller place of power, though smaller. In the distance, he sees the Alacian Manse. As Yang had said, he knows it; it could be nothing else.

As Chi-Yosh draws close to the spires of the Alacian Manse, his path eventually ends abruptly in a dead-end, with a high wall blocking the way to the inner city. A chiseled archway is against the wall, but appears to be filled with blank water-stone.

Chi-Yosh touches the stone, and he can feel it. The signs are all around him, the knowledge always there, but he hadn't _thought_. The city is alive, and sickened by this contagin, worn down in all ways; the defenses, the structure, malfunctions of purpose. While this wall may not understand he is an Exalt, and wants passage, infected places may not be so strong to resist such demands. He feels the patient, and the Essence beyond, seeking where these defenses are clouded, feeling like a doctor probes the stomach of his patient for pain. As soon as the Caste Mark's light causes the walls to ripple, he stands before it. "Open, that I might enter."

At Chi-Yosh's touch, ripples appear in the surface of the wall as if in a vertical pond. Then a crack appears along the inner side of the archway... and with a mighty splash, a tunnel of suddenly liquid water falls down, forming a passageway through the wall. The new floor ripples like a pond for a few seconds, then settles into a perfect calm, becoming indistinguishable from the roadway leading up to it - including solidity; it is quite safe to walk upon.

Safe in the belief the walls will hold, the trio persists, the Solar, then Spider, and Ossissa guarding behind. Chi-Yosh moves quickly through the small tunnel, and emerges with a cursory survey, before stepping aside.

The sound of rushing water can be heard behind Chi-Yosh as Spider clears the doorway. As he turns, he sees the water rise again, frothing and bubbling as if in a vat with invisible walls, until it has filled up the corridor once more. The clear water then begins to fizz, a little at first, then a profusion of bubbles until it is as opaque as the wall around it, at which point it settles into solidity once more.

There is indeed no mistaking the Soul of the Sea-City beyond. Unlike the rest of the city, it appears to have been constructed of mundane stone - finest blue-veined marble, obsidian, limestone, and even accents of black jade. Many of the building stones are clearly not native to the area, or even to the West. And of course, if the architecture of the city proper had been ornate or baroque, the Manse's architecture is downright rococo - with the occult measurements forming a seamless whole with the architectural flourishes.

After a moment's marveling, a wary dash is made for the Soul. There is a certain feeling of urgency; any moment longer exposing the city, the world to the infection is too much, not to mention the _Unveiling_ parked just beyond the city itself.

_Come with me to the heart of the Manse,_ directs Yang urgently, speaking in Chi-Yosh's mind. _The Spider must ascend to the roof and attack the contagion. We have other business._

---

The Hearthstone room of the Alacian Manse, like the Hearthstone room of any manse, is devoid of furniture, but its walls are decorated with freizes of abstract patterns in azure and alabaster - those who gaze at the freizes are reminded of the sea, and the longer they stare, the stronger the impression becomes, to the point of hearing the rush of ocean waves and smelling sea-salt, and one could believe that they would be wet to the touch.

In the center of the room, on the pedestal which would normally bear a Hearthstone, is a miniature replica of the city made of heavy crystal, perfect in every detail and glittering with Essence. Certain parts of the model appear to be dark, such as the missing building near the dock where Chi-Yosh entered; the light glimmers and flickers in places such as the library.

From somewhere beyond the potent defenses of the city the scream of rushing steam can be heard. There is a clap of thunder and the very ground shudders. The source appears as a black smear on the sky that grows larger and larger as it draws near. It is the heart of the pox, and where it passes near its own spawn they are smudged like a wet painting towards the core of the pox where they are absorbed.

The coming danger is noticed by Spider, who ascends the Manse with the agility of a climbing insect. Atop the Manse Spider settles like his namesake, with hands and legs outstretched, elbows bent as if they were the legs of an arachnid, his weight settled on his toes and fingertips. The Spider waits, eyes studying the heart of the pox as it draws near, growing more powerful still.

The Spider is watched by eyes the hawkish eyes of a predator. But those opticals are focused not on taking down the artist, but of warding off any further threats the city might impose, or dealing any number of points into the Pox. He runs across the rooftops and over the walls, the city's web his perch to deliver a needed bow-strum.

Within the central chamber of the Manse, Yang advises Chi-Yosh. _The Spider will destroy the pox. But if he cannot succeed - if it is too much for him - it may be necessary for you to aid as well. Not in fighting out there, but in here. It may be dangerous. Are you willing?_

_I did not venture all this way only to yield in the face a threat. If nothing else, he is my Sifu, and I must do what I may to protect him from that which he cannot defeat._ Chi-YHosh steps up to the crystal likeness of the city. _How can I assist?_

---

Heart of the Pox draws near with a thousand hissing noises. Out from the mass of darkness spring gigantic wings, stretching hundreds of feet over the city befow. A head resolves itself, then another, and another, still more, until the Spider faces a ten headed dragon formed entirely of swarming beetles, snakes, and scorpions.

The Spider remains still as death, watching his enemy closely. As the Heart of the Pox suddenly strikes with three heads the Spider simply throws himself into the air, twisting in the air to kick at the first head to strike, launching off with the force of the essence-flooded blow to hurl himself at the next, both hands curling together and stabbing like a stinger. Without anything to brace himself upon, Spider crawls over the web of existance itself, first taking a few hasty steps, then simply vanishing.

The largest head of Heart of the Pox explodes around Spider, who bursts back into reality there, his fingers and feet bracing themselves on the glinting strands of fate itself. At his back, the Heart of the Pox reels in agony, screaming in wrath as it is battered back from its prize.

Heart of the Pox divides itself now, it's massive body suddenly dropping its core below. From that terrible mass four legs burst, and in its center whipping tendrils rise, their lengths crowned with stingers, biting teeth, and the horns of great beetles. The dragon, much reduced, does not move around Spider, it simply flows, so that for a moment there is a flowing smear of darkness as it disassembles itself only to reform behind its target, trapping him between its two selves.

Spider does not wait on his opponent's leisure. The foe still does not know his measure. The Spider shimmers and Creation bulges as if it were a pond disturbed by the dropping of a stone. Along the entire length of his massive foes come his strikes as he tears, crushes, and shatters teeth, bone, and exoskeletons, so that the dragon crumbles under its own weight, falling in ruin upon the city below. The bulging core collapses upon its side. As it strikes, the city beneath it roils, boiling as the broken pox eats it, drawing strength to itself desperately.

Sensing a real danger, the Pox lashes out in what ways it can. It does not attack Spider, but slams itself against a building nearby. The purpose becomes clear quickly as the city's defender arise. Heart of the Pox rushes away from them, it's cunning mind using its enemies against each other.

The Pox Core below moves in concert with the Heart, it's ooze form bubbling and boiling, frothing itself every higher and even blasting some of its bubbles into the air. Wherever they burst, essence breaks down, Creation being torn asunder ruthlessly, giving way quickly to the madness of the Wyld, rather than granting sustenance to the disease itself.

While rifts in the Wyld Ossissa can do nothing about, the watery infantry and gargoyles is something the Terrestrial can handle. He races across a roof, leaping off as one of the winged gargoyles race by. He crouches, picking off a trio before leaping off his ride, firing a slaying shot upwards as he plummets. Hitting a fountain, the force of the water slows his decent, allowing the terrestrial to spray aquatic archers with shots.. Boots splash down in the fountain proper, and he's across the courtyard, and into the thick of automa bowmen.

Spider remains still even as the automata surround him. The first attack against him finds him no longer there, leaving the automata for others to handle. In that moment he is above the Core of the Pox and dives at it like like a raptor. Whereas before he was fast, now he does not participate in the flow of time at all. From writhing tentacle to writhing tentacle, to the very core and throughout every strand of being that forms the Core of the Pox the Spider's attack is felt, the venom of his sting more potent than any force the Pox has ever faced.

There is no burst of light. There is no roar of rushing waves of screaming pain. The core is simply gone, and where the bulk of the core once sadded Spider remains, held up by a single finger, one leg extended forward and the other back, both perfectly parallel to the ground. There he lingers, and above him the Heart of the Pox stares with malice, diving at him with talons outstretched.

Spider does not dodge. He accepts the attack and the entire weight of the Pox falls upon him, crushing him in its flow. It pulses into his body, his skin boiling, black, distorted. His eyes bulge and blood pours from his ears as the contagion tries to consume him utterly. For a moment, all hangs in the balance, as Spider stands at the edge of being and unbeing. He blinks once, and the moment passes.

What follows is hard to describe. The Poxed Spider staggers back and around it four other Spiders stand. Their feet and hands all move with the potency of his arts, and essence is sheared away, blocked, twisted, and banished in strike after strike. Every blow causes all that is Real to shudder as the surging essence forced into Creation ripples through it. One of the Spiders falls under the strength of the Poxed Spider, then another, and another, until finally only two Spiders remain. They face each other unmoving, their conflict happening beyond sight and vision. Indeed, the only hints that a battle is happening at all are the surges, as if veins of essence were pumping through everything for miles. Finally no more can be handled, and the Pox, bloated, filled beyond any hunger, erupts, letting fly a lance of energy straight into the sky. The air explodes in a thunderclap that cracks walls and rocks the ground below.

Wounded but still at peace, Spider sets upon the ground. He says only, "It is done."

Even as Spider sets, utterly bereft of essence, the road behind him trembles, then bursts as the Pox reveals that it is not done. Its writhing form moves past Spider, ignoring him now that he is no threat. The Sifu shuts his eyes and says, "The Student's work now begins."

---

As the Manse is the heart of the city, flooding it with Essence, enabling every function, an Exalt's spark is the heart of the internal Essence, the very fundamental aspect of one who manipulates Essence. Finding the Core Stream that feeds and sends out the power of the Soul is easy, but re-directing and harnessing it far more a challenge. Like changing the course of a river, the Solar steps inside and forces his very being into the path of immense power.

Like coals put beneath a water fall, power and pain radiate outwards as the two collide, filling Chi-Yosh to the brim with raw power, that threatens to sunder him at the very seams. Shrieking, arms flung wide, he rides the power, before thrusting it down, down into his gut like air, before flexing the Essence like a muscle beneath the power of a Chosen to the Unconquered Sun.

Once the pain and surges of new, unfamiliar power settles, he can feel It. The life of everything around him, an extension of his own consciousness and feeling. This he has known before, when he first attuned to his Manse, first became Exalted and knew the presence of Helios. Feeling every sensation, from each building, nook and cranny is not a comfort; the contagion burns and nauseates, drawing disjointedness and degenerating pain. It feels like an illness inside Himself, for He is the Mind that controls the Soul.

As a doctor, he knows poxes Diseases, while never so visible, mutated and alien, are still that: disease. As an Artist, he knows the ways of meditation, of changing the body to create mystical effects. Such dual understanding guides him, to seek inward, then outward, to each place of infection. The flow of Essence here is forced like a great eruption, only to settle, and patch, like one would re-break and set a wounded leg. There, power is forced in, then out one spot, only to pull back, as one would lance a boil. Other places are far too gone, blinding him with their presence. These are simply blocked of Essence, removed and discarded like an amputated limb.

Not only the places of weakness need recovery, but the internal systems of purification and defense. Focusing inward, the rot and malfunction to the immunities are slowly stripped away, filtered, and fixed. Some destroyed, others reborn, until the defenders of the city are no longer torn from time and illness. As one they rise, and go out, seeking the individual invaders of disease that gnaw at the now healthier city, that can no longer draw on the sickness for strength.

Focusing in every direction of this internal medication is tiring and trying, for the Solar works at every angle for the sake of speed. And as health flows outwards, removing the distraction of weakness, the Solar who is the City becomes aware of the lurking threat. It's crawling through his gut like a parasite, seeking to spread to the very core once more, and rot from within again.

On the rooftop, a sheen of corruption withdraws like the receding tide. Behind it, still covered in the Essence-charged filth of the contagion, is Ossissa. Blood trickles from his mouth and his eyes. He lays insensate on the hole-pitted roof of the Manse. Near him, the Spider cradles one broken arm in his robe's sleeve as he surveys the destruction.

Carefully the two men attain their feet, finding themselves wobbly but functional. They slide down the roof of the Manse; Ossissa winces carefully once he's sure the Spider can no longer see him. And together they enter the central structure of the now-quiet city.

Part of Chi-Yosh lies on the floor of the Manse. It is properly "part of" because the left side of his body seems to be composed more of water than flesh, with the same qualities of liquidity. His anima banner burns with an eye-searing fire, and even the Spider must raise his hand to his eyes to protect them from the sight.

Shielding their eyes, the two Exalts press forward. "We will have to remove him from the stream," says the Spider. "Can we even touch him?" Asks the pirate, who receives no response from the Sidereal. Using his well arm, Spider reaches out, taking hold of Chi-Yosh's arm. The surge of Essence is enormous, the feel of it roiling beneath the surface of his pupil like bottled fire. The sensation runs up his arm like lightning. Gritting his teeth, he sharply pulls, dislodging the Solar from the Manse's power. For a moment there's a Flash as the stream is broken, and reunited once more, a shockwave of power surging outwards, before Chi-Yosh falls to the floor.

Between the two injured Exalts, they manage to limply half-carry, half drag the Solar out, through the devestated city. Chunks of buildings have simply melted away like ice cubes losing their luster, while segments of the street have succumbed to the sea. By the time the trio travel down the broad avenue before the gates, their clothes have been bleached white.

In the midst of a large intersection, a small bundle draws the eye of those who wander the purified and decimated city. The wind that flows down the road marks something as wrong. The blanket does not move with the wind, but rather as if it were moved by some other flow.

Moving closer, the form of a child can be seen, pale and ghostly, its form beyond death. Sandy blonde hair shifts still in the wind, and sea green eyes stare lifelessly from the face of a girl no more than four years old. Around the child, the city is deeply scared, revealing it as one of the most heavily poxed areas.

Ossissa is struck, staring down at the lifeless body. Seeing enough cruelty upon the waves, the fate of children at his own actions is still not something the Terrestrial is accustomed to. Spider remains solemn. "She deserves some sort of buriel. A hungry ghost out here is something to be fearful." The Sidereal merely nods, before they turn, and move back towards the gate. Nothing can be done until their load is lightened. As they pass through the gates, the Solar's head tilts back, sucking in a swift breath. Back arching, he shivers strongly, as the liquidity of his watery half drains away, leaving the man behind.

Dragging the Solar to the small boat on the pier, Ossissa returns inside to recover the girl's corpse, wrapping it tight in the blanket, that he not have to stare into her eyes. She is moved back to the boat, where the trio manage to row back to the ship. The crew takes over, hauling them up. On Chi-Yosh's request, the boat does not set sail. Not yet.

For as much pain as Chi-Yosh feels, someone else present suffers perhaps far more, and in a way that cannot be so easily healed. Yang's voice laments, _Little Sumiko!_ For some time the pain in his voice buries all words, until they rise again. _I did not know. I never wished for her to come here, but she was ever eager to see what her father was doing. I have paid enough, why must she suffer as well?_

Chi-Yosh sees tot he wounds of Ossissa and his sifu, but stopping to listen to the woes of the captured man. _I shall see that she suffers no more._

_She had her mother's eyes, and her smile was like starlight!_ Yang cries. _I was so blind. Can any punishment ever wash away what I have done? So long she has waited here to be saved, and now she is dead. I have killed that which I loved most. Please. Please let me see my child one last time._

Upon the deck, the funeral for Sumiko is a mournful, yet grand affair. The crew sings songs known to all sailors, the praise of the sea, the loss of a fellow crewman. While usually the respect is given with beer in hand, in a lighter tone, this calls for a somberness. Chi-Yosh performs the rites over the girl, while Yang can peer back into the sea green eyes. Once the ritual is over, Seawind bundles the girl up, and slips overboard, to the volcanic vents below.

From there, Chi-Yosh collapses into a bed, and does not rise for a day and a half. The crew has grown restless, but Ossissa respectfully waits for word, still recovering himself. Sailing the Wyld while weak is unwise, to say the least. As soon as the Solar rises, he requests the best container of metal or glass aboard, and some ingredients from the gally. A crude "jar" of containment is fashioned, and still not feeling at all 'himself', the Solar sets out for the watery city once more.

Once again on the docks, and past the gates, Chi-Yosh looks for the best architecture to chip away. Armed with a dagger and hammer, he takes to a brick in the road, and chips away at the masonry, drawing out a small chunk and dropping it inside. The process is repeated upon the foam of the gate, and the hand of a statue. The jar is placed into a sack. From there, he travels further into the city, remembering the two potential sites of artifacts. He does not wish to stay too long, instead running to the library, and past the broken doors, to collect a book at random. From there, he's out and moving towards the columns once viewed, though some are now missing.

After an hour, Chi-Yosh and Seawind have retrieved several items worthy of further consideration. The Lunar girl has come as his new 'guardian'; Ossissa is back on the ship preparing for departure, while the Spider is nearly devoid of fighting power. In due course they return and Ossissa lays down his conditions.

"I want control of this place," he says firmly. "One of my sub-captains has a great desire to learn more about shaping the Wyld. In return, you can have whatever tools of the Anathema are here. Whatever we have no use for is yours. We'll take the risks." And the gleam in the pirate's eye shows that risking exploring this city - and whatever lies beyond it - is something he has little fear for.

Chi-Yosh considers the options, before laying his own conditions. "I will return in one month, with what you have requested as payment for this trip. By that time, have that which is ours on your island. Once all is payed, our debts are settled." After a pause, "But, I have a further offer for you."

"Soon, I will be in service to Azel, Keeper of the Antiquities of the Sea. Whatever it is she has me do, your services may come in handy. If it is a mission which would have gain for you, I would offer you a place in it. If her wrath falls upon you, I will be lenient. However, to do such a thing, I ask you to not give Guild hostages to the Fae." A hand is raised, to still any protest. "I realize that Eos is ... impassioned over the Guild, but that is not a fate deserved to any. I am associated with those who are working to change the Guild's ways. Whatever she has against them, we might be able to calm the waters, or help settle debts."

"I may sail with you again, but you will not tell us how to live our lives," says Ossissa firmly. "For now, let us set sail."

_The second Sutra, the Two Hearts As One Lesson, allowed me to save your life,_ Yang explains. The travelers are bound back through the Wyld, and Chi-Yosh is bed-ridden while Gemela Windrose studies his condition intently. For now he can simply rest quietly as she works her magics, and converse with Yang. _You attempted to bridge yourself and the city. So that you could live, I had to make your body more like that of the city's. If it hadn't happened, I think you would have failed. So aside from the city's purification, I am truly a step closer to redemption as well. For that I thank you._

Chi-Yosh remains silent for a time. He can tell that something has changed inside his body; the rush of power has left him more at home inside his body, even though some strangers seem to be inside as well. The memories of the past are easier to reach. To Yang, he offers _Thank you for sustaining me. Despite your loss, you are closer to redemption once more. It is not true consolation, but I am glad to have offered you the chance to be closer to redemption. And, I hope we can see you through all of the marks upon you. In due time._
