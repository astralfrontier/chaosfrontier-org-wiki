# Gods of Eden 2005-01-15

It is said all great journeys begin with a single step. While this is technically true, it's more accurate that many small, single steps, begin every journey. The one being undertaken is no different. The airship takes many steps to clamber aboard, and many steps still to get properly activated. Yet when all is said and done, it's but one single, if dramatic 'step' that sends the ship into the sky, borne aloft on currents of air and Essence. The small meadow stretches, then shrinks away from the Solars, becoming one of many variations of green in the patchwork quilt of Creation beneath them.

Bagrash Kol's hidden fortress is the ultimate destination. Those aboard the ship do not take much time in setting their course, though it's a roundabout way of getting there, so as to dissuade, or at least mislead any would-be pursuers. With more than a few turns, the ship continues. Its pace leisurely, but ultimately inevitable. The ship will reach it's destination, and Time and Distance will only mark it's passage, not hinder it.

Far to the northeast, beyond all known settlements and past many unknown settlements, is the legendary fallen fortress of a long-dead sorcerer. The man known as Bagrash Kol once made a bid for the world, with the Eye of Autochthon and his fantastic floating fortress as his trump cards. Its location has never been certain. The one man who must have known it - Manosque Viridian, the inheritor of the Eye by right of salvage - was killed centuries back, and left no records.

Nevertheless, stories of the legendary master magician have been passed down through the intervening years, and many have grown in the telling. Whether the feats he performed were true or simply exaggerations meant to lend excitement to the tale, it is certainly true that he could have rewritten History with his actions. And in the end, he was brought low by the consequences of his hubris.

Only one man knew the location of the fortress - Korash, the White Wizard, whose soul is now gone from the world. Now a mountain-sized cenotaph to the ancient wizard is all that remains of the legacy of Bagrash Kol. And as the airship sails steadily toward where the dead Korash's notes say it should be, the Solars feel the weight of history bearing down on their shoulders.

Gallius spends the entire trip preparing herself. Her role is a simply one in this quest, and she holds true to it. Her days are spent until darkness falls moving about the airship in dance with wind and rain and blade, shivering gusts with steady swings and shattering rain drops with stabs of her blade. This is not just a honing of body, but of mind, until she can concentrate so greatly on her weapon that all the world plays out behind it, like a vibration carried down the orichalcum shaft that she need not see. She simply knows it as Midmorning Sakura knows it.

---

In the elder lands where barbarians still hunt animals that speak, and men still converse openly with the spirits and bear their blessings and children equally, the primal energies that seethe under the veneer of Creation's civilized lands are more discernible. The wind blows in a true song, not the mere hint of one. When rain falls, the pounding hammers of the sky-gods are more clearly audible in the clouds above. And when the rain flees, the clouds are burned away by the holy fire of the Sun itself. This corner of existence still remembers the old ways. It is not tame.

The airship lands a distance away from the vast black slab of rock that dominates every surrounding feature of the wild landscape. They can see ancient fissures and cracks in it. The beautiful and intricate frescoes detailing Bagrash Kol's triumphs are still somewhat visible on the outer ring of the fortress, but many have simply caved or crumbled in the passing of the years. The dead hulk slumbers before them. They have arrived at the fortress.

The fortress itself is divided into two parts. The 'lower deck', cylindrical in shape, serves as the base. Much of it is now half-buried in the Earth, and the rough landing the craft was forced into gave the whole thing a slight tilt to the southeast. And above this base is the 'upper deck', from which many towers of stone extend upward like the fingers of some gigantic buried corpse. A number of gates ring the lower deck - used, perhaps, when the fortress was still ground-bound.

Approaching one of the lower deck's gates that remains unburied, the Solars force it open after much effort. Beyond is stone and darkness, but this is easily cured with Essence. Caste Marks alight, the Solars propose to enter a fortress that has seen no dwellers for ages. It is a tomb in truth.

Gallius strides into the fortress at the side of Jin-nu, pushing her way past the wreckage of an almost forgotten age as she goes. "If only this were the difficult part of this search," she says softly. "I imagine that much awaits us deeper in."

Each crevice yawning wide could have something threatening beneath, each jutting stone may fall over, or sink beneath the surface, drawing everything with it. These are the only concerns Chi-Yosh could have, moving through the rubble with an understanding of everything 'level' with him. Which is fortunate; he still feels uneasy, distracted with his own self, a perpetual sense of nausea of a different kind distracts. But he can still watch his back, and that of the Circle's. "A dead mask to hide the activity behind," he comments to Gallius.

Davron levers a larger boulder aside to open a passage. "Indeed," he says quietly, hardly breathing heavily. "But we face only the mundane out here, and that would not dissuade even a determined mortal, much less a powerful Dragon-Blooded sorcerer like Korash. We must go where he could not tread."

"Of course. We'll need to go where even the Exalted could not tread," clarifies Ramar, as he clambers along craggy, old, broken stones. "I wonder... will we overcome that which... well, which no one else has been able to so far?"

"None who tried so far were Solars," Davron says simply.

---

As they pass from the outer passageways, the geometry of corridors and courtyards subtly shifts from the merely auspicious arrangements associated with any architecture to something which serves a specific occult purpose. Davron the craftsman is the first to identify it. "Earth magic," he explains. "Distorted by the crash, no doubt, so there will be leakages. This way," he says, directing the Circle down a hallway that looks just like its mates to either side.

Not a hundred yards along the corridor, a river of red-hot lava cuts across the path - but hardly two yards wide at this point. A rumbling to the left suggests the location of its reservoir, which presumably would've made that corridor all but impassable. The Circle leaps across the gap with ease, and continues on.

Other signs of the damaged pattern of the fortress become apparent: the depredations of long-passed elementals of Earth can be found here and there, along with rooms and tapestries that have somehow been transmuted into stone. Without the wise guidance Davron provides, the Circle may have suffered a similar fate in their own journey.

---

Now the Solars stand before the final challenge: the Labyrinth of Lies. The great door has a warning affixed to it in the tongue of the Old Realm, and its starkly carved runes offer little comfort: TRUTH AND LIES ARE BEYOND. TREAD WITH WISDOM.

A bit of examination during the trip has proven that the Labyrinth forms a ring around whatever central chamber the Solars are searching for. Whatever lies at the heart of this silent hulk of rock, the mysteries behind this door are the only path to it.

The door cracks open, and the Circle sees a sight that draws their breath. Beyond are the walls of a maze, in truth - but they are made out of solid yellow jade, the element of Earth. There is enough wealth here, if it could be extracted safely, to rule major portions of the Threshold like god-kings for decades. But at that, the Solars also sense a throbbing pulse of Essence that pervades the walls. They walk in some kind of grand artifact, and cavalierly prying it apart would certainly be dangerous.

"Attack only the lies," mutters Davron, and taking a deep breath and pausing for a moment to steel himself, he steps over the threshold into whatever awaits beyond.

"...Where fools fear to tread..." mutters Ramar. He enters the Labyrinth of Lies, managing to not look terribly apprehensive. "Let's try to stay together... and remember that what our minds tell us is real might not necessarily be so..."

Gallius looks to Jin-nu for a moment, then nods. She moves on, taking her friend by the hand as she goes. What lies beyond is a matter of destiny, but first a price must be paid. There is always a price.

Chi-Yosh passes through the portal, fingers drawing tight his staff. "We must feel what is within us before we act." This is more an affirmation to the self, rather than others. The maze will likely test them all. They have faced many threats against them, now beyond is the threat inside of them.

The Labyrinth twists and turns. The yellow jade of the walls changes in composition as they walk the claustrophobic corridors, at first seeking blindly for the way through. As with all mazes, there are tricks that the wise can employ, and those in the group who recall them remind the others. Here, though, the Essence flows that power the unknown magics of this place overwhelm whatever sense of place they have. It becomes very easy to get lost.

Again under Davron's leadership, the Solars thread their way through the twisty passages. The craftsman feels guided by some preternatural instinct of memory, or perhaps a calling of the fortress itself, and with inhuman confidence he urges his fellows to join him.

The twisty maze opens out into a beautiful garden, shrouded in mist. Shrubs and flowers are artfully arranged in ways that permit visitors on foot to most appreciate them. There is no sky overhead, only the omnipresent mist, and from it the sound of footsteps can be heard.

Chi-Yosh allows Davron's deft direction lead, until the air opens up into the directionless fog. While he would be inclined to appreciate the garden, is wary. A place such as this relies on the illusion. Anything can be merely a pretty veil, or a spectre of misdirection. Must like the Fae. Still, as the sound of footsteps draw near, the Solar is attentive, keeping his eyes in the direction they seem to come from, and the exact opposite. "Forward," he says at last, "And keep together. We may be swallowed in this fog."

Beyond is a peculiar scene, and one that stirs strong feelings in at least one of its observers. It seems less real somehow, more like a stage setting. The costumes are true to their source, but they still seem like costumes. The voices of the actors, and the expressions they give, are clearly those of the stage. What a strange thing to find in this place.

**ACT the FIRST**

_Exterior, Sunset. KIRRI lies on a long divan in the Garden. She is dressed in the gown of a convalescent woman. Entering from the left is GALLIUS, the very picture of a concerned sister. In one hand she carries a bowl of soup. But secreted in her other hand is a vial of deadly poison. She approaches the divan and speaks._

GALLIUS: My sister, I have your soup for you. Please, drink hearty, for every day you suffer in body, I suffer in my heart.

KIRRI: Thank you, sweet sister. Even your compassion gives me strength.

Gallius stiffens at the grey reflection of memory being portrayed before her eyes as some dark play. She frowns in thought, holding back any words as she simply watches things unfold before her.

_KIRRI accepts the soup that GALLIUS has brought, sipping on it carefully. GALLIUS watches, the poison artfully concealed in her hand. As KIRRI finally drifts to sleep, GALLIUS turns away from her sister and looks down at the poison._

GALLIUS: Far be it from me to slay my sister, who would have sat upon the throne. But my prideful heart compels me, and I'd do anything to make't my own.

And with these words, the mists begin to cover the scene again, but ever so slowly, like a curtain descending.

"Right then. Let's keep moving," replies Ramar, shattering the silence. "We have a chamber to find."

Davron is silent for a long moment, and does not follow. Instead, he turns to Gallius and whispers, "Is that how it really happened?" His face betrays no emotion - or rather, it is overwritten by so many that it is impossible to gauge which is ascendant.

"So the lies hide in the nest of truth," says Gallius simply. "A thing held tight to my heart plays out before me, but it's purpose is twisted. I would trade all the thrones of this world if I could have my sister back at my side." She turns to her circle, "Be cautious. I.. I will try to explain what we have seen later. I fear it is not all a lie."

Davron swallows, and nods. Though his heart is darkened by the thought that even some of that may have been true, he fears to judge Gallius too harshly, lest rash action come back to haunt him as they progress.

Chi-Yosh regards Gallius with a solemn, featureless face. The ways of this lair is tricky, even if every possible lie may hold some seed of reality. Better to understand later from the source, than to have it distorted. What lies further may be his own secrets, and thus he tries to hold his judgement, and his tongue.

"It was raining," says Gallius, walking towards her shade. "Three days had passed since a barbarian had slipped past our guards and put a blade in the back of my sister." The lady shuts her eyes tightly and her voice quakes, her face crumpling with sadness. "There is no cure in Roleyn for marrow acid," she says softly. "It takes little to start the process. The blade was bathed in it. She started screaming when she was stabbed, and started again, every time she regained herself." The Queen of the Nation of the Sun does not wipe away the tears that escape her eyes. "So much pain. Like a fire in every bone. That is why it the poison was named that way. So much pain. I.. I was her big sister. I could not save her."

The mists part again, and to Gallius, it seems that her other self has become more hollow and transparent. Less like a person, more like a costume that one might slip on and discard.

"Save but by one way," whispers Davron, his own tears flowing. "Only one way to end her pain... Would I have had the courage, if something like that had happened to..." He shakes his head as if to clear it. "But the pride... _that_ was a lie, then?"

Ramar steps forward and places an arm on Gallius' shoulder. "Lady Gallius..." he begins, and does his best to hide the tears welling in his eyes, blinking them away. He starts to speak, though his voice catches in his throat "I... I am sorry to hear that, Lady Gallius. To know that such a thing was necessary. But what you did, you did for your sister. To save her from a fate that none should have to bear. None of us... well... you wouldn't... well, not to take the throne. I know this. I'm sure we all know this. But... sometimes, it doesn't hurt to know we know this." He looks down, finding a spot on the floor to stare at in silent contemplation. He removes his hand.

Gallius turns to the shadow, moving towards it slowly. "She spoke softly at the end. She knew what I was to become, what prophecy I would fulfill. I could not let her suffer any longer. When she was little she used to run through the meadows and hide from the men sent to look after her. But she could never hide from me. I saw in her eyes what she wished of me. What she wished but could not ask." Gallius steps into her shade, then, "I gave her a blackroot poison. It brings a deep sleep to those who drink it, and they wake never again." She sighs deeply, "No one knew. Who could I tell? Who would have understood? I loved my sister. I never wished to be on any throne, but destiny has made me what I am. I ended her life because that is what I would have wished her to do for me."

_The bottle drops from shaking fingers; the princess weeps as she hears the slowing pace of her sister's breath behind her._

GALLIUS: I thought such thoughs of pride had flown, and felt no lust for father's throne. And now I cry these bitter tears, looking down through coming years. I weep because I'll be alone.

Chi-Yosh looks onto the set, before returning his gaze to Gallius. It is something he would have done, given the contexts - it is something he has done. Simply dispensing mercy to those who cannot be saved, who will only suffer. As a field medic, or a warrior, or any number of roles, when one simply cannot crawl over the threshold of death's door, assistance must be given. He steps beside his other Circlemates, and watches Gallius with understanding, mournful eyes.

The mists once again clear. The scene fades; the garden is replaced by a hellish inferno, and the Solars realize that they are back in the Labryinth, standing in the midst of rocky caverns. Over a river of lava hundreds of feet below is a narrow bridge of rock. The way ahead has been opened.

---

Over the bridge of rock are canyons carved into the fortress's unyielding granite. And in the walls of these canyons, as the Solars pass them, are murals - carved pictures. The Circle stops at a dead end in the canyon. It seems that the story has continued in frozen tableaus of stone. Chiseled above many of the pictures is the continuing title: ACT the FIRST. The pictures themselves show the skilled hands of a great artist.

The painted stone carvings depict a young man working in an armory in a small village, and Davron recognizes himself. In one picture he is shown working on numerous arrows, while his father looks on sternly. In another, he is receiving a beating from the older man. And in still another, he is shown leaning over a forge while his father seems to administer a harsh rebuke on the youth. And in this picture, as the paternal countenance of his father seems particularly wrathful, the younger Davron is pictured secretly wrapping his hands around the hilt of a sword that lies near the forge, as though he were ready to raise it and strike down his tormentor.

Davron gasps, and tears run down his face, and he shakes his head slowly, his expression twisted into a grimace of anger - no, rage and frustration. He takes a step forward, and traces the outline of the sword-hilt in the carving with trembling fingers. At first, he is unable to speak, his shoulders quaking as he tries to suppress his emotions.

There is space on the canyon wall for one more picture, but none has been started yet. And on the ground, a hammer and chisel await.

Davron turns to one side, and winces at what he sees. But it is obvious now what he must do. He steps forward to take the sculptor's tools, and faces the blank wall. His reluctance to step up to the task at hand is revealed by the fact that the first elements of the final scene are the background - the flaming forge-fire behind Davron, the texture of the walls of the armory, but not yet himself or his father.

Gallius watches silently, frowning at the seeming excesses of the father. Her attention shifts to the real Davron, watching him quietly and waiting for him to tell the true story of this reflection.

Chi-Yosh recalls the meeting of Davron and his father at the Carnival of Masks. The love and the confusion and raw emotion between them forbode no real hate or anger between the pair. He finds the story hard to believe, given their reunion, but he waits for Davron's crafted explanation.

"Dav... Davron?" Ramar watches the Twilight take up the tools and set them to the stone. He glances back at the other paintings, wincing. He knows those feelings. Being beaten, but... he cannot comprehend this from one's own father. _What that must feel like._ Ramar's voice is soft, "I didn't know. What... well, I know that you will find a way to bring the Truth to light amidst the lies. You are skilled at this my friend. We are here for you. As you have been here for us. If we can help..."

Chi-Yosh places a hand on Ramar's shoulder, drawing him back, towards Gallius and the Dawn. "Wait. For now, his heart must spill across the stone."

"This is my own story," whispers Davron. "None of you can carve this for me." He steels his resolve, and sets to work carving the central figures at last - in profile, so that the expressions of two men can be seen. First Davron's father is carved into the rock, one foot backward, his expression one of shock and dismay - Davron takes the time to carve the face almost to a smooth polish, as if to suggest a pallor of expression.

At last, the final figure takes shape - and now Davron works even more slowly, his deeply ingrained craftsman's instincts urging him to take the time to compensate for his shaking hands, that the final work be as flawless as possible. At first it is only the figure of a young man, holding in both hands the hilt of a sword whose blade is embedded deep into the anvil.

Finally, Davron carves his own features as he remembers them that day - eyes tightly shut, his mouth drawn back in a grimace of rage, helplessness, and... guilt. The tracks of the young Davron's tears are carved so artfully as to almost seem liquid, as they gleam in the distant light of the lava behind them.

At the final stroke of Davron's chisel, the entire canyon wall collapses inward, broken by the weight of truth. The magnificent art Davron executed crumbles into fragments, but in doing so it exposes a cave - the way ahead.

Davron replaces the tools beside the corner of the doorway, drawing deep breaths - clearly still deeply affected by the memory he has been forced to relive. He does not step through right away, though, as if his mind's eye is still seeing the frieze that has fallen to dust in the here-and-now.

Gallius watches Davron face a similar nightmare and steps to him, crying as well. She slips her arms around him and draws him into a caring embrace. She says nothing at first, just holding her friend warmly and somehow managing to smile despite her tears. Finally, after a few moments, she whispers, "You are not alone."

"I... I understand now Davron. I understand why you need to... well..." Ramar trails off, glancing into the cavern. His thoughts dwell on Davron's words about his Spark, about the one who threatens to take him, about the dangers of what must be done. A determined look settles on his face, and a warm, sympathetic look follows. "Know that you always have friends, and for what it's worth... we will help you."

Chi-Yosh steps in behind his Circle, and once Gallius has released Davron, offers the man a comforting hand on the shoulder. There is not much he can say. But he can simply show that his friends are there, and understand. That can be stronger than any words.

Davron trembles in Gallius' arms, almost as if afraid to react at first... then returns the hug softly. "Never a kind word, always demanding more... even when I exceeded his own skill. I thought he was just being cruel. It wasn't until after he died that I realized that he _did_ know how good I was. He was only trying to help me be the best that I could be."

---

Inside the cave that Davron's chisel opened is more darkness; only the Caste Marks of the Solars can illuminate it. And waiting within, on a mat of straw, is an old crone. She bears the facial features of a woman from Chi-Yosh's village, and her age is impossible to determine. But she is nobody the Easterner has seen before. "Welcome, visitors," she croaks. "I have a tale to tell you, called 'the Tragedy of the Exalted', and mine is the third part."

She gestures for the Solars and Jin-nu to join her, and begins speaking as they squat down. "Once upon a time," she begins, in her ancient and cracked voice, "there was a young man from my village. He was good and kind, a friend to those around him, an inspiration to the children of his neighbors, and loyal to his friends."

"But he became Exalted - chosen by the Gods." The old crone chuckles softly. "A great power overtook him, and he was elevated above the stature of such trifles as friendship and honor. No longer would he fear the retributions of men, nor fear the justice of the town's elders. Nor would he want for food or drink or companionship, for these things he could take for himself. Once as mortal as we, he became something else. And one day, he left the village, and told none what he sought. Perhaps he is now a king somewhere, or a god." She stops, and draws a withered hand to her wrinkly cheeks. "Perhaps this tale ends here, as a warning not to trust the gods."

Chi-Yosh sits in silence for several moments, mulling this over, a frown overtaking him. Does his home village feel this way of him? The wise pupil to replace their medicine woman, leaving because of something greater? Or is it about becoming not himself, too overburdened with his own power. It is hard to answer to this tale, to chase the lie away because it hasn't happened yet. Or has it?

But after a time, something does nag at Chi-Yosh. "I returned," he finally says to the crone. "I returned to see the friends I had left by, the companions I had trusted, to seek out the truth of our village. I saw my mother, my people, whom I care for - I've battled the Dowager, who's land creeps towards theirs. I have yet to leave you behind. I still need you."

"Then perhaps this story has more to be heard," croaks the old woman with a half-toothed smile. And so saying, she gestures behind her. The tunnel that led into this cave now has streamers of mist curling into it. "Seek it out, and tell me the tale."

As the Solars move to rise and leave, the old crone reaches out and seizes Chi-Yosh by the arm. "Is it you, youth?" she asks, wheezing a bit from the effort. "Do you not remember me? Have you truly forgotten who I was to you?"

Chi-Yosh rises, to further understand this story. It is less forward than the others, requires more perception upon his part. He's confused. Until her fingers sieze hold of him, the Dawn staring back into her weathered face. "I... cannot remember who I have not met. I've never seen you before. If you are the generation born after I, who were to depend on I, I am sorry that I could not have known you; responsibility has kept me from you."

The crone's fingers release Chi-Yosh, to draw back to her cheek and wipe away a forming tear. "Find the story, and tell it to me," she begs softly, as the Solars take their leave.

---

The Circle scales an impossibly steep cliff, with jagged handholds their only means of ascent. More than once, Davron must be rescued from a lethal fall by the more able hands of his companions, and even the strong and capable Gallius finds herself a little challenged by the climb. And at the top of the cliff, the mists swirl most strongly. While the party regains its breath, the mists part again to reveal a stylized throne room.

_GALLIUS stands before the throne of her father THE KING. She is downcast; her father is stern._

THE KING: You have slain your beloved sister. No claim to innocence can possibly be accepted.

GALLIUS: Though my sister's last meal was sweet, in my mouth there is naught but bitterness.

THE KING: Then you have drank sparingly from the cup which I have drained to its dregs. I will see you begone from my court and from my lands. For claiming yourself as my heir I banish you for all time.

GALLIUS: I will go, but one promise ere I do. The king my father, for your pride and for your sake, I say this now before Heaven, my own kingdom will I make.

_GALLIUS leaves, and as she takes her leave from her father's court, a shaft of sunlight appears to strike her. HELIOS appears, reaching out a hand, as she bows low to greet him._

HELIOS: Thou shalt have no kingdom of thine own, for by Heaven you have sworn. Now this guilt has stained thy heart, and forevermore be borne. No kingdom wilt thou raise in thine own name, but mine instead. This be penance for your shame.

"This never happened," says Gallius quietly. She looks confused by what she sees. "Ever I have doubted this," she says, reaching up to indicate her caste mark. "I.. I think I understand." She steps forward and lets out a soft sigh, "I am just a woman, and even would the world lay at my feet, begging me to be its queen, I would never believe that I am the right one. Here my uncertain spirit lies as plain as a shattered crown. I.. I am sorry, my friends."

"It is understandable," says Chi-Yosh, at last. He steps over to Gallius. "You are too humble to claim the kingdom for yourself. But as Helios' speaker, you have done great works to spread his promise to his Chosen, to the world outwards. This is nothing to be ashamed of. He has given you strength. Do not feel his absence as weakness, for you are still Gallius."

Gallius steps into herself once more, looking from Helios to her father. "Two thrones are cast upon me, both seemingly by a choice, and yet were I to refuse either, darkness would have come." She turns to face her father, "My sister's death was sealed. I could not let her suffer, whom I loved more than myself. When she passed on the part of myself that remembers my needs fell with her. I fear I shall never be the queen that Kirri would have been, but there was no one else." She turns away from him, to face Helios. "And you gave to me a choice, to die and abandon my people, or to live and accept a second crown that I would not believe in my right to hold. That day again so much of me died."

Gallius shivers there, weeping openly, "But now there are people around me who remind me that I still live, and that I am more than two crowns. And yet the crowns remain. You stand there, my second father, and though you cast your warmth upon the world, the night that falls upon me every day leaves me cold. I will do what I was chosen to do, but as for what lies in here?" She places her hand upon her heart before continuing, "That lies in a deep frost still."

Ramar is silent for several moments. After a time, he walks beside Gallius. "And yet not all is lost. You say parts of you died long ago... yet long ago you were reborn. Life and death, even that of the spirit," he places a hand on his heart, "Are the same. Lady Gallius, you warm the world where you walk, even in the darkest night. You warm the hearts and souls of your friends... for what it's worth, Lady Gallius, you bring hope where there is none. Even the deepest frost cannot conceal you. Cannot contain you. I would share your burden. We all would." A look of uncertainty crosses his face, he reaches out to her and falls silent.

Davron looks astonished. "Of all the people to be plagued by self-doubt...?" he murmurs. For a long time, he can say nothing. Gallius may not bear the burden alone, but the lion's share, as it were, does rest on her shoulders. Were she to let that burden go, would he feel able to take it up?

As Ramar speaks, Davron adds what little he can. "You were chosen to bear the crown because you _are_ fit to do so, Gallius. The Nation of the Sun grows, most of all, because it is healthy and vibrant - and it is your leadership that has made it so. Do not abandon your self-doubt entirely, for it is a mighty bulwark against hubris, but let it cause you to consider carefully what you should do as Queen, not to set down the crown entirely."

Gallius sighs softly, turning to take Ramar's hand. "I will try to remember that I am not alone," she says quietly. "But these things take time, my friends. What has been lost cannot be easily regained." She shakes it off, standing strong once more, "We must go now. This maze is not done with us."

---

The Labyrinth worms its way through the heart of the colossal fortress, and the Solars have long ago lost any sense of orientation. The sole confidence they have that they aren't simply traveling dream-lost in the Wyld is the pervading feeling of Earth-aspected Essence. Even a blind man can feel the warmth of the Unconquered Sun on his face; and even the rawest Exalt couldn't help but sense this feeling of power.

Now the corridors are made of black jade, and the distant tumble of water can be heard. The Solars emerge into what appears to be the cabin of a sailing ship, and find it littered with all manner of things - a traveler's chart, maps and courses, and even a log book. Nearby is parchment paper on which someone's penned a sea-song.

As Ramar approaches, he discovers that the logbook bears his own name: captain of this vessel, it seems. Curious, he opens it and peruses the contents for a few minutes. The sea-song, too, bears a brief look-over.

"'This is the logbook of Ramar Galadon, sailor,'" recites Ramar from the book in his hands. "There are some entries... 'I sail now into the Wyld, hoping to be lost in dreams. I desert Creation as she has deserted me. I do not act for the Gods, because they have given me no action to take.'"

Somewhere outside, a sailor begins to play a song - the same one whose lyrics are noted on the sheet of paper that rests on the captain's table. The voice is sad, and the six strings of his instrument quaver like half-suppressed tears.

_Chosen I was, a child of the Sun, sail fore'er and a day, Given the might of a thousand waves, sail fore'er and away, Left all alone, seeing no one, sail fore'er and a day, but it's not for power I restlessly crave, sail fore'er and away..._

The song continues, and its melancholy melody tells the tail of the ship's captain who dared to come ashore after being granted divine power while at sea. A sailing man, he knew courses and reckonings, and he waited for the wind to blow him in the proper direction. But no wind came.

He met a new queen upon the shore where he finally landed, for he and his crew were hungry. And she too knew the touch of the Sun. She spoke with he who had endowed her with the same power the captain received. But no voice spoke to the captain. None guided him, and he was on new waters. In his heart he grew envious of this queen. How was it that they had been granted the same gift, and yet she knew her way while he did not?

"Put that way..." muses Ramar, softly, to himself, "It is no wonder." He listens to the song, "Do I know no guidance, no direction save for the courses my friends chart?" He shakes his head, "Have I been so blind, wasting, waiting for a wind that never comes? I perhaps dwell too much on... on other things..."

Gallius listens to this closely and looks to Ramar, uncertain what to say. "What other things do you dwell on?" she finally asks. She looks to the rest of the circle, wondering if they, too, hide uncertainties like her own.

Ramar speaks, "On why for all the things I know, I can't find what I am meant to do. I look to you, all of you, and I see it. You know what to do. At least... that is what I believe. You've found your way through life, and I cannot seem to find mine." Ramar laughs, though it is not a mirthful one, not at first. "Although, to hear it put this way, perhaps it is because I choose to wait. I am ashore now. It is time to make my own wind. My own song. But..."

"We may seem to know what to do, but at least in some cases we are acting," says Gallius. "You know my case very clearly, now. We are not so different. You do not know your own way, so you remain still. I do not know my own way, so I run desperately in the direction that chance has given me. Who can say which is more honest?"

"None can say, but at least you move. I think it is time for me to change the song." Ramar considers this, and takes up a pen. He does not write much more to the sea-song, just another verse. This verse tells of the captain, of how he learned to create the wind he needed. The divine power that took him ashore, gave him the means to move across the world. He had but to wish it.

More of the Labyrinth awaits. The Solars continue forward through the mazes and dangerous crossings, well aware that the secrets so far exposed would have driven a group of lesser men to mutual slaughter by now. Perhaps even worse things await them from here on.
