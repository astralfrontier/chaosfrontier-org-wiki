# Gods of Eden 2005-01-16

Upon returning from a most trying voyage, Gallius wastes little time in setting out once more. The Key of Sa is put to use and a message is sent to Ma-Ha-Suchi. Gallius means to come and pay her price. The Zenith steps into the throne room where the King of Harborhead and his family was held, ready to die, at the hands of Abyssals. The soft song Gallius weaves of that day fades into the gathering darkness and she moves outside the castle, seeking Ma-Ha-Suchi.

The throne room Gallius finds has been systematically destroyed. Every work of art, every precious painting, every impressive marble column has been smashed. What is left is a darkened and roughly-surfaced ruin. Here and there, wild desert weeds are already beginning to sprout. This is the mark of Ma-Ha-Suchi's conquest.

Gallius walks through the remnants, looking here and there and reaching out, to see if she feels that purity she sensed while flying to the Fortress of Bagrash Kol. The ideal of the Lunars was never clear to her before she stood upon the deck, one with her naginata and feeling every motion of the air, tasting every drop of water in the clouds. And here it is far from achieved. She treads her way onward, seeking Ma-Ha-Suchi. Even as she goes she prepares herself. The price must be paid.

From the shadows of one doorway, a horrid nightmare silhouette emerges. Ma-Ha-Suchi has come. "Prepare yourself!" is all he shouts, before leaping forward, his shape transforming into something new as he leaps.

The last preparation comes even as Ma-Ha-Suchi leaps at Gallius. The Zenith bursts into the flames of the sun, shattering the darkness utterly. The Lady flies to meet her attacker head-on, running up the side of a half-broken wall, and launching herself upwards, the bitter point of her spear glittering.

What leaps at Gallius, evading the spear-thrust, is a great dire wolf, with slavering fangs dripping with corrosive saliva. The beast is a wild inhabitant of the North, at least four yards in length, and a terrible predator. It is the sublimation and ultimate expression of the fear that all men in the North have of their world. And now its wickedly sharp fangs are bent on rending Gallius' flesh from her bones.

And its bite breaks past the orichalcum armor that has thus far never failed. Gallius makes no sign as teeth like swords tear flesh from her side. She lets the force of the blow send her spinning, burying her spear into the wall behind her. She holds fast to the haft of the weapon for a moment, and then kicks off once more, arcing through the air as she brings the fierce blade of Midmorning Sakura to bear against the back of the wolf.

The wolf-thing howls, leaving behind a spray of blood on the castle walls as it leaps away from the blow. It lands, and Ma-Ha-Suchi grows almost instantly out of that shape and into his war-form again. Already the cut on his hip is healing as he strides forward with claws out.

Gallius does not wait upon her foe, but instead is in motion once more, her spear moving like a thing alive, turning into a blur of glinting gold that would rend flesh and drive her foe back even as she strides forward.

The length of the weapon catches Ma-Ha-Suchi along the forearm. Ignoring the bright red flash of his own blood, he twists his wrist to a degree impossible for a mortal being, and his powerful paw seizes the shaft of the weapon. Planting his feet, he makes a grab with his other paw. Lifting the spear entirely, along with its wielder, he uses it as a lever to slam Gallius hard into the wall of the castle. The protesting stone cracks and crumbles, and the Solar crashes into the far room - a royal bedroom. Dust kicks up around the opening.

Gallius rolls with the force of the blow, saved partially from the massive impact by the strength of orichalcum. She rises less smoothly this time, but the fire in her eyes has not changed. She holds her spear steadily behind her and rises on the ball of her left foot, her right leg bent, ready to drive her into motion. Her left arm is stretched before her, stained with the dust of the shattered wall and streaked with her blood, and yet she beckons Ma-Ha-Suchi to come to her once more. All about the lady, essence dances, racing into her as she prepares for one great strike.

Never one to back down from a challenge, Ma-Ha-Suchi leaps effortlessly through the opening, and a cloud of dust billows rapidly before him, heralding the legendary Lunar's coming. Like a lightning bolt with claws, he comes.

The Zenith does not move until the towering Lunar is upon her, and then she spins towards her opponent. Her spear first slashes at the waist of the nightmare charging upon her. She maintains this movement, and with a growl of effort turns her next spin into a murderous stabbing motion, aiming up towards the chest of Ma-Ha-Suchi.

The Lunar's abdomen is torn apart by the deadly swing, and a red torrent begins to stain his thighs. Nevertheless the pain isn't enough to distract him, and both hands come together as he traps the blade of the naginata between his palms. As his arms quake, and Gallius struggles to free her weapon, she can see the cut again beginning to heal itself. "This is your best?" grunts Ma-Ha-Suchi, revealing a shortness of breath in his boast. "Perhaps.. you were expecting.. a card game instead."

"The Great Ma-Ha-Suchi breathes hard," says Gallius. "Perhaps he should save his breath," she replies, straining along the length of her spear. She seeks to use the strength of the Lunar against him, pulling first towards herself, and then both twisting the spear and driving it with his opposing force towards his chest.

A canny warrior is Ma-Ha-Suchi, and not for the first time has someone reckoned on outwitting him. His position is not an easy one, and he rejects the tug-of-war when he feels Gallius' power growing. Her spear bites air, but he also is driven back, performing two acrobatic backflips and landing in a crouch with his back almost to the wall of the bedroom.

The Zenith does not charge to meet her foe, but instead makes use of the time she has. With a swing of her arm and a sudden rush of essence her spear flies from her hands, carving through the ceiling above. She flips back through the hole her body formed, catching her returning weapon in mid air and twirling back just in time to watch the maimed roof give way.

Through the gloom of the palatial bedroom, Gallius can see Ma-Ha-Suchi's eyes flicker upward, and she sees that he understands what she's done. With a swift movement he whirls, moving to leap back through the hole she made. He won't be caught in the fall, but it seems that he doesn't want to risk it either.

Gallius sees the troubling speed of Ma-Ha-Suchi ruin yet another of her attempts and has precious little time to avoid being trampled. She drives her spear into the ground and climbs up it, leaping from it to smash her left fist into the ceiling above, digging her essence-bolstered hand into the masonry above.

Gallius falls back towards the floor below, turning to descend head first, catching herself with her left hand on the long handle of Midmorning Sakura. She looks around slowly, then lets out a sigh, no longer relying just on vision, but on what she can hear and feel.

The consummate predator knows when to be patient, and when to pounce. He is stealthy when he must be, and fast when he strikes. And so it is that Ma-Ha-Suchi bursts through one of the other walls, nearest to Gallius. As soon as he comes through the wall, he dodges left, sprinting in a quick semicircle to evade the inevitable counter-strike against his point of entry. And then he swings into a low, half-crouching run-up. This will be his final attack, and Gallius can feel the throb of power as he builds up.

The counter is more of a feint than potent attack, buying Gallius the time to ready herself. The very walls throb as essence is drawn to Ma-Ha-Suchi like a raging torrent. Her's is not the strength of stone or steel, which must bear the attack or shatter. She calls to her mind instead the lithe motions of the willow, recalling the poems of Oaken Claw in the back of her mind, the words mingling with the thoughts of past lives to the extent that the Zenith is not sure if she is part of that mass of thought or all of it. Both spear and body of the Lioness prepare to give way to the storm, but not to break under its fury.

---

Outside the palace that once housed the king of Harborhead and his family and servants, two men are patrolling the city walls. This was once their home, and in spite of the devastation that was brought to the city, they are loyal to it still. One man, walking atop the wall itself, is raising a drink to his lips from his gourd; the other, his friend, is below.

A tremendous blast shakes the ground, and the man atop the wall nearly loses his balance. The drinking-gourd falls from his hands, but his friend below manages to catch it. Both look at each other, then look at the palace. Sections of the roof are caving in, and clouds of dust and steam are rising in their place. Without a word both break away from their assigned guard posts and begin running to investigate what great calamity could have done this.

---

For his part, Ma-Ha-Suchi is alright. He's missing a lot of his forearm, but that much is slowly regrowing. With the other hand, he's busy scratching marks into the stone. Moonsilver-like claws scrape through the merely mundane stone of the castle walls; his message will be unmistakeable. THE SOUTH IS OPEN TO YOU, it reads.

Gallius lies staring at the sky. The pain is somehow less than she thought. She has felt worse pains. She does not move, watching the stars wheel their way across the sky above. A sharp intake of breath, ragged and punctuated with a groan, floods her with greater pain. She knows little of medicine, but her mind knows this pain. Broken ribs are nothing new to one who has dealt long with spooked horses.

After taking the time to regain something of herself, Gallius grits her teeth and pushes herself up with her spear. She finds it doesn't hurt quite so much if she moves carefully. She also finds that her left wrist is broken. She sees the message, but does not waste time here. Instead she makes her way to a door and begins to shakingly whisper a poem of Greyfalls, of the gate before which the great battle took place. She steps through and holds herself upright at the gate for a moment before the darkness claims her once more. Hopefully Halvah and the people of Greyfalls have not forgotten her.

When Gallius wakes, she feels as if she was rising from a dream. She wears a pale white nightgown and is bundled safely in a warm bed. For a moment her heart races, only settling when she realizes that it is not her bed in Roleyn that she wakes in, but one very far away from that place. She hears a soft song drifting through the air and rises from her bed, looking out the open window. Outside, she sees the form of Oaken Claw sitting with her back to one of Halvah's saplings. The singing stops as another friendly voice chides her from behind.

"You should not have risen yet, Gallius," says Spring. "Just because you have run off and found yourself a crown does not mean your flesh is any stronger than mine." The Immaculate even wags a finger at Gallius as if she were scolding a child. "But enough of this. You are up, and you will not listen to me, so you might as well go speak to Oaken Claw. I think you should at least tell her how it is you appeared from nowhere at our gate, on the brink of death."

Gallius quickly dresses herself, marvelling over her left wrist and taking many deep breaths, then bursting into song. When she has prepared herself completely she goes out to speak with Oaken Claw.

The Immaculate of Wood regards the Zenith with an arched eyebrow, a small smirk forming on her lips. She says nothing, leaving to Gallius the telling of that battle. The details are naturally somewhat hazed due to the severity of the damage the Solar sustained, but in the end what is important to convey is grasped. "Honor has a high price," says Oaken Claw softly, "But remember humility, lest you fall as those before you have." Oaken Claw sighs and shakes her head, "But you must be leaving. I can sense it in you. Perhaps when next you come you shall stay and tell me more of what you have seen and done. And perhaps I shall teach you patience."

Gallius kisses the palms of her friend and teacher, bowing deeply to her. "I hope that I shall have the time to learn that lesson," she replies. "I will remember what you have taught me, Oaken Claw. But you are right. I must be going." She suits her words, as well, politely refusing the offer of aid in returning to her nation. Instead she seeks a door away from others and again puts the key to use, singing calmly the story of Bridal Veil's deliverance from the tyrant king. She draws open the door and steps into her own lands once more.

---

The Fisher is waiting when Gallius steps through and closes the door. He's sitting in Lotus, meditating with his legs folded beneath him. Without even opening his eyes, he nods in polite greeting. "You are going to Rathess next," he says calmly.

"I am," says Gallius. "What do I need to know to survive this trip and restore the Dragon Kings?" she asks then. Though the Fisher is not the same as the Master was, he is still a Sidereal, and though he constantly surprises her, she has learned to accept it as naturally as one possibly can.

"Survive Rathess itself," he replies, just as calmly, as he rises to stand. His eyes open, revealing his supernatural heritage again. "Survive the beasts the Dragon Kings have become. Survive the dangers of their metropolis. It has become a breeding ground for strange beasts."

"I imagine there is much there I will not expect," says Gallius. "But this is important. If Creation is to survive the strength of the Dragon Kings must be restored." She sighs softly and adds, "I cannot let them live like this any longer. They deserve better than this. I can remember them as they once were. I will not abandon those who stood at our sides for so very long."

"I do not know the story much more than I have learned in my time here," replies the Fisher. "But let me offer you something." And so saying, he produces a pebble of rock. He approaches and extends his hand, offering it as a gift. "This will aid you in Rathess."

Gallius reaches out to take the pebble. She examines it closely, wondering just what it is. "How will it help me?" she asks curiously. She can't imagine the Fisher making a joke, but this seems a strange thing to be given.

"When you learn that, I look forward to hearing," replies the Sidereal evenly. There is no trace of mockery or deception in his tone; he is as confident of this as he can be of anything, it seems.

Gallius laughs softly, but keeps the pebble clutched in her hand. "It is refreshing to hear that even a Sidereal doesn't have all the answers. Yet it seems strange that you know something that you do not know, does it not?" For some reason it pleases her, "I wonder who shall wish to travel to Rathess with me. The Dragon Kings were great masters of things that grow. I believe at least Chi-Yosh would be interested."

The Fisher shrugs a bit. "It is not given to anyone to know everything, or even to know enough."

Gallius nods to the Fisher. "It would be horribly boring to know everything," she says simply. "I shall tell you what use this pebble has, though, so you will know more." She bows to the Sidereal and then steps out of her door, seeking the Dawn.

---

In one of the gardens in and around Bridal Veil's palace, Chi-Yosh has pinned a scribe down to dictate. The Solar paces around the woman who writes in precise, perfect lettering. From the sound of it, he's rattling off several plant varieties. "Now, get that to Coronna." The scribe rolls the scroll up, stuffing it into a mail bag. "Yes sir."

Gallius waits a ways from Chi-Yosh, listening to his recitation. She smiles and softly starts to the sing the names of the plants, and about her the living green grows more vibrant, flowers straightening and turning their heads to the sun as the Song of Life rushes through them. As is her way, the Lady walks barefoot in her gardens, letting the soft lawn press up about her toes as she moves slowly closer to Chi-Yosh. "You have kept yourself very busy," she says warmly.

Chi-Yosh stops and simply listens. Even if he cannot benefit from the Song, its energy stil flows over and tugs at his heart in other ways. He watches as Gallius draws across the emerald grass, before giving a respectful nod to her in return. "There is much to do, still, to make the Nation better. I have put it upon myself - and by proxy, Coronna - to craft the Nation's hospitals."

Gallius nods slowly, "It is a worthy task." She has not heard the name Coranna before, but there are so many skilled people in the Nation that it is little surprise that one should escape her notice. She turns to look towards the south. As is her way, she wastes little time, "Ma-Ha-Suchi has opened the south to me once more." She turns back to Chi-Yosh, "I am going to go to Rathess. I have learned the song of a door there that should allow us to reach that place swiftly."

Chi-Yosh's expression finds confusion as Gallius does not recognize the woman's name. Then he realizes he has been pronouncing the Sidereal's name incorrectly... and it jogs his memory that he has been using her name, and not the mortal alias. This lances through his mind as he listens to Gallius. "I will go with you. After I hunt down the courier."

Gallius turns to give Chi-Yosh a strange look. "Did you forget to tell her something, then? Well, I shall wait for you by back entrance of the palace. I would rather not have so many see us step into Rathess. I only hope the song does not land us in a difficult place. We must be cautious."

"I will return with supplies, and we will be gone then," assures the Dawn, before he rushes out of the garden, the way the courier had exited. It is a third of an hour before he finds Gallius, a small pack slung over a shoulder. "Are we looking for anything in particular, on this trip?"

"I seek the last remnants of the Dragon Kings," says Gallius. "Any writings there are of use, as well. I would like to awaken them with the words of their own tongue. I warn you, though, that the Dragon Kings as they are now have fallen. It is said they are cunning beasts that rove their old homes in deadly packs."

Chi-Yosh says, "Then we must evade these packs. If you seek to wake them from their primal stupor, fighting them will be a danger to both us, and your cause."

Gallius nods, "From what I know of them, it would be best to avoid them entirely. If it comes to fighting, we must obviously stand our ground. Even beasts will flee when they are overpowered." She turns to the door and asks, "Are you ready to go to a long dead city?"

Chi-Yosh squares his shoulders. "Queen Gallius, I do not know where I am not ready to go, with you at the lead."

That answer catches the Zenith by surprise. She remembers herself though, turning to smile gratefully at Chi-Yosh, and then she begins to sing softly of the lost city of Rathess. Feeling the key catch her song, she casts open the door and leads the way far, far to the south, all done with a single step.

The pair of Solars stride from the comforts of home into a place utterly swallowed by the land. Before them stand the remnants of an airship, held still in the hangar where they first saw it in from afar long ago. The Zenith paushes to look around, studying the ship and nodding, "This is the place. It.. feels right, too, doesn't it?"

The air is strange here, with a faint odor that suggests unpleasant, if unclear, things in the nostrils of the pair. The sounds of exotic jungle birds floats on the wind from some distant perch.

Gazing out over the ruins, with it's southern vines choking the hangar, and humidity enough to soak one's hair, Chi-Yosh can only nod in agreement. "Sa's offer was not simple temptation." His attention turns to the airship, looking it over to see how much must be done to restore it.

"Indeed," says Gallius. "Perhaps in time it can be restored. But that is not our current aim. I think our best move is to ascend and see what we might see. I doubt we can out-climb a dragon king, but perhaps we avoid their notice if we look where we are not expected."

After climbing up the roof of the hangar, the two Solars can see out across the rich jungle lands, and find themselves at the top level of a small pyramid. Beyond are greater buildings, rising higher, obscured by dense vegetation that has drawn over the ruined kingdom like dust on a forgotten forge. The pair half-slide, half run down the pyramid, and after a time of Chi-Yosh trying to detect the approach of any predators, they take to the trees, moving above the thick flora.

Moving through trees is not something Gallius is used to. She adapts well enough, though, finding in the limbs a soft song. The song has harsher movements as well, however. It seems the home of the Dragon Kings is also home to fierce beasts of scale and fang. Crafty and remorseless though they be, they are no match for the strength of Solars. Still, they slow the journey down and worse yet, leave a trail which greater predators might follow.

Chi-Yosh doubles back, making sure to erase some of the most obvious tracks. With the magic of his stone, the Dawn leaves no trace, allowing him to focus on Gallius' evidence. This slows the pair down further, but it is not too long before the pair reach another building. Soon, the pair are scaling some of the ruins, searching for a way in, or around.

Gallius does her best to give Chi-Yosh little to do, but she is no master of stealth, and she would never claim to be. She can climb well enough, at least, and her strength and dexterity both are tested in climbing overgrown and mossy stones. Up and up the Solars climb, hoping that this pinnacle will reveal to them the places of interest that still stand in Rathess.

After trying to avoid an angry mother bird over the nest they stumble across, the Solar duo finally reach the top of the building. This offers a better view of other Rathess buildings. Viewing a map and other information offered by Cloudburst, and accessing the placement of the sun and their direction, they can determine their placement in the city. Three buildings likely seem possible, the closest of which they detect is a building known as the Dust Watch. They then carefully start making their way.

Gallius moves swiftly, her strength growing as she senses the justice of her cause. The difficulties thus far have only been enough to steel her to this task. She begins to grow more confident that she will find something of use here, something that will help redeem the Dragon Kings.

Clearing away the jungle, the two draw up onto the Dusk Watch temple. The courtyard's stones, weared away by time and grass pushing up beneath, are a view of the jungle lands from above, smothered by twilight. The building itself is domed at its top, even as almost all of the building is missing at a specific level. When the stairs are mounted, and the two push past the rotten doors, they can see the ancient lattice of mirrors leveled in the direction of the setting sun, allowing the view to be spied all around the lounge-designed upper deck. Above, the dome is painted in the brilliance of the sunset.

"Even with the passage of a mountain's weight of time, this place still remembers the beauty it once held," says Gallius. She considers the area slowly, letting out a sigh, "I suppose it was foolish to hope that some written word might survive this. Even the stone has been all but consumed by the jungle." She frowns and considers for some time, finally just shaking her head, "Perhaps we might try calling upon a spirit?"

Using dirt of the jungle, Chi-Yosh draws out symbols of spirit calling. As one, animas erupt, capturing the light of the mirrors and radiating it upwards as they wait for a Spirit of Rathess to come to the Solar's call.

In due course, the Solars feel an unseen presence. A faint flickering registers on one of the enigmatic globes of glass the Solars spied upon entering the Dusk Watch, and from it they hear a strangely modulated voice, similar to that of the 'recordings' that some artificers have produced in Nexus. **The Guardian of Rathess is here. Speak.**

Gallius bows to the spirit and thinks carefully of what words she would say. The truth seems to always serve her best, and so she will say nothing that is not true. "Thank you for greeting us, Guardian of Rathess," she begins. "We are Chosen of Helios who have come to your city seeking knowledge of the past. We wish to know the truth behind the fall of this City. We hope that it might rise again. If this is your wish as well, perhaps you can help us understand better what has led to this day."

**Others have come as well, asking as well. It was the wish of my masters to take leave of this place. It was further their command that I protect it from intruders. This I have told them; this I tell you.**

"So you served the Dragon Kings?" asks Gallius. "I wish to show them the world that is now and give them the freedom to make their choice once more. When they turned away from this place before, they were abandoned and alone. I do not think they were able to make their choice with clear minds."

**I serve them still,** the voice replies.

"If you do, perhaps you should consider that their last command to you was not meant to stand against the passage of so many years," says Gallius. "You have watched them for all these years. Do you truly believe that this is what they wished to pass? That the world they fought and died for should slowly be swallowed by the Wyld and torn down by the Deathlords while they lie here, idle?"

**My oath to them is for obedience,** the god replies, implacably. **For your nature, I will tolerate your presence while you are here. I will answer what questions I can. But do not exceed the boundaries of my forgiveness.**

"Is it not true that once many of your masters served the Chosen of Helios?" asks Gallius. "Did they not give oaths as well?"

**My masters were the mentors of you Chosen,** the spirit replies, with a hint of pride in its unearthly voice. **They advised your Deliberative. Some may have served some of your kind, but it would not have been a desirable state of affairs.**

"But our power eclipsed their own," says Gallius. "And when the Solars were betrayed, the Dragon Kings gave up, giving their very hearts to Helios and forsaking the difficulties of the world." The Zenith frowns and considers for a time, "I wish to learn the tongue of the Dragon Kings and seek out their true spirit for myself, as it is recorded by their own hand. What in this city has not been destroyed by thieves? Where can I learn what I desire?"

**That language is something I can teach you. But there is a price.**

Gallius nods, "There is always a price," she murmurs, but it is more to herself than to anyone else. "Name your price, Guardian of Rathess. If it is a reasonable one, I will pay it. If not, my search goes on."

**In fact, I shall tell you why. My masters believed that you could overplant any soil, and that plants were best served by growing as widely as possible. I will give you the memory of their language. In turn, you must give me a memory. It can be of anything, as long as it is of use.**

**In this way an old seed will be planted in new ground, and the seed of your thought will find new ground as well.**

"I have heard of a price like this before," says Gallius. "Will this memory I give be lost to me forever?"

**It will become faded, but you will not lose it. I am not commanded to uproot, but to encourage the spread of all growing things.**

Gallius nods to the Guardian, then. "I will give to you the seed I think you need to understand," she says. She considers the spirit carefully, "I have more questions, however. I have heard the Dragon Kings revered the Unconquered Sun most highly of all Gods. Is this not accurate?"

**It is. Thus my tolerance for your presence. Otherwise I would have exterminated you for your temerity, as I have done with others.**

Gallius looks around for a moment, silently noting how the place has been utterly looted. "And were there any other Gods they revered? Some who might tell me more of the Dragon Kings."

**Nature was their passion. Your human gods they cared little for. Those gods having domain over the growth of life, and of the earth, were their most revered.**

"And where might a temple to such a god be?" asks Gallius calmly. "I wish to contact one of them. If the Dragon Kings shall remain lost for all time, I would at least know their story so their lesson is not forgotten."

**An earthly temple would be an impediment. You are best served visiting Heaven itself.**

Gallius turns to Chi-Yosh, the nods. "I suppose we shall have to go to Yu-Shan, then." A pity the key cannot take her directly to that place. "We will have to return to our home very swiftly, it seems."

"The key can get us home the swiftest," replies the Dawn, as he glances towards the stair of the Dusk watch, looking for a potential place for the Silver Key to find its place, rather than traveling back the way they had came. "We will have to hunt down Ramar, or a potential spirit."

Gallius takes her time, thinking of what memory is best to offer to the Guardian of Rathess. She keeps returning to one terrifying memory that best reflects exactly what is likely to pass should the Solars fail. "I have chosen," she says simply. "But you should not consume the entire length of this memory. Just a moment of it should suffice. Some should be left for myself, else I may have to go back once more and look again."

**Very well.**

Gallius calls to mind just a second's worth of memory, but in it is buried a hundred lifetimes of despair and emptiness. The sands of Cecelyne shift beneath her feet as she stares off, but is not even that dark place that is the source of such distress. Gallius shares instead a brief glimpse into the Maw of Oblivion with the Guardian of Rathess, the terror that the Deathlords would bring to all of Creation, if they are left unchecked in their black service.

And in return, Gallius feels a seed growing in her own mind. In the darkness that she summoned, a tiny mote of light appears. It swirls outward, growing, nourished by the Essence of the Guardian God. In it are thoughts, wishes, and ideals foreign to all human experience. They are the alien consciousness of the Primordials, given life and form in the shape of the Dragon Kings. The reptilian creatures understood mankind only with difficulty, and as Gallius comprehends their language, she understands something about them as well. She can understand why they might have chosen suicide, as well: a plant thinks more of its seeds on the wind than itself, and a weed that grows wild is not welcome in a cultivated garden.

This understanding does not compel action; it does not shake her wish to give the souls of the forerunners of man a second chance. But for the first time she can formulate in foreign words the alien feelings that must have driven them to die.

Gallius opens her eyes and lets out a sigh. "Thank you, Guardian of Rathess." She bows to the city god and says, "We must now be going. In time, we will come here again. I fear that meeting may not be so peaceful, but we shall see."

Gallius stops when she turns away, remembering something that she has brought here. "There is something else," she says, turning back to the spirit. "I was given this, and told it might have some purpose. Perhaps you can explain?" And she holds out the pebble to the spirit, letting it see what she holds.

**It appears to be a rock,** is the god's droll reply.

Gallius shrugs and puts the pebble away. "It seems that this answer is not yours to give." She turns to Chi-Yosh, "We should get back. There is nothing else we can do here yet."
