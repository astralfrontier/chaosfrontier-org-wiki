# Gods of Eden 2005-01-22

Gallius strides grimly through the Labyrinth, her face a mask over the turmoil she feels inside. What lies behind was just the beginning. She can only imagine that things will not grow easier. Still, there is no wavering in her. There is a price to be paid for all things.

Davron is still in the lead, though the events since entering the Labyrinth have shaken him. A small part of him is still fascinated by the enormous magical artifact the Labyrinth represents, and wants to know how to build such a thing himself, but that will have to wait until later - if the Circle can emerge with their sanity and unity intact, that is.

Chi-Yosh keeps in line with his Circle, attention drifting between the meaning of his own encounter with the inner-mirror of the Labyrinth and the challenges his companions have faced. Gallius has been dug into, the dark truth having boared into her. It bothers him that there is nothing the Dawn can do to support her, except to continue with her, comforting in his presence. He can only imagine what might happen if only one had come into the depths of the Soul's Mirror.

---

The only way forward is to dive into a pool of murky water, and the Solars do so after making sure the stuff is free of most obvious dangers. Under the surface, nothing can be seen further than four yards away, but an underwater canyon guides them through this strange passageway. They emerge dripping, but warm enough.

The cave that forms the end-point for the pool they swam through is a comfortable temperature, and filled with a familiar mist. Passing through it, the group feels as though their bodies are being drained of something - the water soaking their clothes certainly is drawn out, but something else seems to be siphoned away from them too. It does not feel dangerous, merely unnerving.

**ACT the SECOND**

Again the mists draw about them before pulling apart like curtains, and the group can behold another theatrical set.

_GALLIUS sits upon the throne of a new kingdom. With her are CHI-YOSH, a fighter and healer; RAMAR, a ship's captain; and DAVRON, a craftsman._

GALLIUS: My friends and advisors, I must ask that you take leave of me for a time. There are things I must dwell upon alone.

_The three depart, leaving behind only the Queen. Another figure appears and enters left; this is KIRRI'S SHADE, the departed soul of her slain sister._

KIRRI'S SHADE: For how long will you condemn me to walk the earth as a restless spirit, sister?

GALLIUS: It is not my doing. The hand of Helios holds me, and I am as damn'd as thou. I cannot renounce my crown, tho' it torments you that I bear it. In truth it torments me likewise.

KIRRI'S SHADE: Well it should. Behold your people anon.

_GALLIUS turns and approaches the balcony, to address her people. But outside, the crowd's back is turned away - the citizens will not face their queen. GALLIUS' face displays a sudden anguish, and she lifts the crown from her head. It has become white-hot, and her forehead is branded by it._

GALLIUS: What evil work is this?

KIRRI'S SHADE: The brand on thy brow is the mark of thy crime. The Solars of old committed greater sins still. What once was a badge of honor has become a stain that thy people shun out of fear, and so it will be until thy redemption, or thy death.

Gallius watches, clearly unsure of how to react to this. "But Kirri is no wandering spirit," she says simply. "She was buried properly and her spirit was selected by Lady Gaia. She lived a long, happy life in that other world." The reluctant queen sighs, "And yet here, too, there is some truth, but.. I do not understand the branding."

Davron looks at Gallius strangely. "And I thought the people of the Nation love you, and welcome your rule," he says, "so I can't understand why they should turn their backs to you. But... I suppose I haven't been listening very closely to the people myself, so I don't know."

"While they are pleased that their lives are better," says Chi-Yosh, watching the players on stage, "But still there is that fear that hangs like a ghost in the air, that their rulers are Anathema, and they may be the first to suffer the Second Fall." He stares down at the players, remaining silent in his own contemplation of this worrying idea, and the fear that nestles and stirs inside of him from it.

Gallius thinks for some time, staring downward. She steps forward into herself once more, "I never sent my sister forward as a ghost. Helios chose me, and when he did the Gallius that was perished. My life was forfeit and all I do has value only if it pleases my Lord." She examines the crown slowly, "Once I asked to be given a symbol of that confidence, only to find that there would be no more than what I already have. At times, that sign has proven inadequate, I fear. The people are not the ones who doubt me. I am."

"The people are defended, because I believe that is my purpose," explains Gallius. "I do not believe they will ever truly accept me with the same love I felt among my subjects in Roleyn. There I was trusted and admired. The symbol of my second birthright is not nearly so comforting. I have tried to pretend it does not matter to me, but it always will."

Chi-Yosh says, "Such a trust and admiration can only come with time." The Dawn's smile is weak and rueful. Stepping closer to the Queen so uncomfortable with her mantle, "Time is what we have, but the weight of its promise is no comfort to our hearts. Perhaps you will become accustomed to your second subjects, and with a decade, a century of good deeds and unfailing support given from our work, they will forget the sins of the past for the fruits of the present and the promise of the future." He grows quiet, a look as though he holds his tongue finds him.

Davron looks doubtful still. "If it were merely that the people fear you too much to love you... would they not simply refuse to look you in the eye? Turn their heads, avert their gaze? But perhaps I read too much into the Labyrinth's shadow play..."

"I do not know," says Gallius sadly. "But I do not know what else to do, but continue as I have. When Kirri died, my fate was sealed. I was never meant to rule. I thought if we freed the Hundred Kingdoms and made the lives of the people better, I would feel more certain of myself, but things have never gone as I had hoped."

---

The next scene of this act seems to follow immediately, but its nature changes as the scene progresses.

_GALLIUS is once again with her three advisors and friends._

GALLIUS: Davron, my faithful friend and companion. You have ever been the friend of the helpless, the protector of the meek, the benison of those in need. The fire of your compassionate heart has illuminated this kingdom.

DAVRON: I thank you, Queen.

GALLIUS: But, your heart has become too great. Your deeds too noble. There is now talk of deposing me and placing you on the throne instead. I know that you would never countenance this act, but I fear that it would destroy our great land if a struggle for the crown arose.

DAVRON: What say you then? That I should be a monster? That I should not succor the people who cry out for mercy?

GALLIUS: Nay. Only that if you wish to be the protector of the people, you must find your own people to protect. I will not share this crown.

DAVRON: Foul fate! That my most cherished work shall always be scorned. Will it always be thus?

_DAVRON takes his leave. CHI-YOSH and RAMAR remain._

GALLIUS: For you both, I have a mission to a far distant land. I trust none but you to complete this. It will take you some time to complete, but you will go with my faith. Prepare yourselves tonight.

_The two advisors nod, and depart. GALLIUS turns to regard the setting Sun, an omen of the growing night that surrounds her reign._

"This.. this is madness," Gallius says softly. She looks to her friends sadly, "I would never send you away. I would rather leave myself if such a thing came to pass. This trial is a bitter one. The price is higher than I had thought it would be, but it must be paid."

Davron gazes at Gallius intently. "And if you left... where would you go? Would you found another Nation, and bring the truth of the Unconquered Sun to them? Even if-" He breaks off, as if uncertain how he wished to complete the sentence - or perhaps, whether he wished to complete it at all.

Gallius considers for a time, then answers, "If the Nation no longer needed me? I do not know. I would likely wander the wilds and again try to find the guidance of Helios. I imagine I would still have some purpose. But I do not know what it might be."

As the players depart the stage, what is left is the prop of the castle itself. And the Solars approach, for there is nowhere else to go - and something about the walls seems strange. Coming closer, they recognize what it is.

Tapestries adorn this part of the stage, but they are not merely theatrical props, but truly beautiful works of consummate craftsmanship. In their fashion, each tells a story, and there are so many of them.

One shows Davron setting out from a distant castle already enshrouded in clouds. The expression on his face is one of anger, but there are tears depicted in his eyes as he walks. Another shows him hard at work over his forge, a light of happiness surrounding him as he struggles with the manufacture of some complex object whose parts lie scattered across the back of his workshop.

Still more art shows the young man's creation: an automata in the shape of a man, a sort of animated suit of armor and weapon. He's shown enraptured by the clockwork thing, and the diagrams and open books on his workbench suggest the reason: the automata will never fall prey to self-importance or myopic self-interest. It will never shout, never find fault because of one's own uncertainties, never doubt truth. It will never hurt people only because it itself was hurt. It is obedient and loyal beyond all mortal measure.

Other tapestries, contrasting themselves against this one by their positioning on the wall, suggest Davron's feelings for the mortals he surrounds himself with: a new and tyrannical kingdom he discovered cried out for aid, and he developed a secret workshop there, built his automatic knights, and tested them against a group of bandits. Later in the depicted story, an army of such clockwork beings marches on the tyrant king and slays his soldiers. And the picture-Davron watches with a satisfied - and if truth be told, vengeful - expression on his face. Reason has triumphed over fickle emotion.

There is a final tapestry. Davron, now crowned king, sits on a throne of brass. To the left, his subjects enter his court, take a length of knotted cord from a clockwork machine, and feed in other such cords into a larger machine labeled JUSTICE. Guards stand by to ensure orderliness in the line. And to the right of the throne, some are shown being hauled off to the dungeons because of the results the machine tabulated. Others are shown leaving the court through the opposite door, faces alight with joy. It seems that absolutely measured justice has found this kingdom after all.

"I rather doubt that shall ever be possible," says Gallius. "At least I surely would hope not. Justice left to itself would consume the world if mercy were not there to hold it's wrath at bay." She looks to Davron, wondering what corner of his being is now being tested. She still has not shaken the latest twisting of the dagger the labyrinth used against her.

Davron's brow furrows and nods skeptically. "Indeed - surely justice _cannot_ be measured with a machine like that," he says incredulously - it seems so counterintuitive to everything he'd ever learned. And yet his tone of voice does not include Gallius' disdain, but rather curiosity. So many things he has seen since his Exaltation, he would have dismissed as impossibility.

Chi-Yosh's attention turns to Davron, watching his reaction to the artistically patterned pictures, before looking back at them.. "The machines are absent the flaws of the heart, of jealousy and weakness by emotion. But by that same nature, they cannot love, exercise compassion or mercy, the intentional use of their invention."

"For one," says Gallius, "To cast judgement upon humans while never being human, without ever loving a person or hating one, is a most terrible thought." She frowns deeply, "Justice is a tool that has spared the helpless and condemned them. Like many things, in the hands of the wicked it can be used for great evils."

Davron grimaces at Chi-Yosh, looking at the tapestries anew. "That's true," he says, seeming chagrined, as if he had not thought of that. Turning to Gallius, he raises an eyebrow. "So... only humans are fit to judge humans?" he asks, sounding puzzled - knowing that that isn't quite what Gallius means, but...

"Only one who knows what it is like to be mortal should judge a human," says Gallius softly. "Someone who lives among them, knows what they face. It would be easy for me to say that all thieves must be punished, but if I see a child stealing bread in the streets, I will raise no hand against him in the name of justice, but instead seek to comfort and save him and those like him. One must be wary of justice, for at its heart is vengeance."

Davron nods slowly. "If mercy could be built in a machine, though... but... even if I could, even if I could instill _everything_ that makes us human in a machine, all I'd have done is make humans out of metal and clockwork instead of flesh. And therefore they'd make all the mistakes that people do, so what have I gained?" But it doesn't seem that he's abandoned the idea entirely - merely set it aside.

Davron steps back and looks over the tableau once more... then strides forward, tugging at the final tapestry with all his might. "I said to you just now, Gallius," he says, as he tears at the fabric, "that I was not a ruler of men, and now I know why. I might build that machine of justice for a ruler, but I would never sit on the throne before it. There is too much for a ruler to consider beyond justice, and that's more than I can handle." He pulls an arrow from his quiver to help him cut the tapestry away. "And you're right - a machine cannot rule on its own."

The tapestry falls free, exposing a hole in the wall - and the route ahead.

---

In a forested glade well past the throne room of the Second Act, the group again encounters the old woman who once told Chi-Yosh a tale that sounded like himself in some ways, and unlike in others. She is drinking from a fountain at the heart of the wood, and rises unsteadily to hail the band as it draws near. "Young man," she wheezes, "how fortunate that we fall in together again. I have heard more of the tale I once spoke about. And perhaps so have you."

"The fellow who left the village fell in with a Queen, and others like him. Other demigods, powerful beings who were destined to rule - or to destroy. The old tales did not say which. And he saw this, watching those around him falling to their dark hearts. He saw, too, others of the god's kindred, but not like himself. The animals, the shapeshifters, had their own clans and their own ambitions, but they were not the dark doom of mankind that he was. He saw too the star-eyed prophets and soothsayers that cloaked themselves in secrecy, who wove fate but were not themselves fated to end life. Even the dragon's get, the children of the world, could not corrupt the wellspring of all life that his own kind could." She gestures to the pool from which she drank.

"For a time he thought of abandoning his dark heritage, of discarding the power offered him, or transforming it into something else, perhaps - all these things he could have done, had he a mind to it. And for a time he plotted against his fellows in secret, laying traps with long vision for the day that they turned into the monsters he feared."

"Tell me, young man," the crone asks softly. "Is a monster who slays his fellow monsters, a monster still?"

Chi-Yosh listens to the old talespinner, and his uncertainty grows as the story sinks in. Turning to the pool beside her, the reflection which stares back is just as silent and deep as he. "Destroying the monsters does not change what one is. But there are so many horrors that can take place. Falling yourself, yes, but worse, being able to change, and still have those around you fall into oblivion. Or worse yet," replies the Dawn as he looks up, hesitant to meet the eyes of his fellows, "Uncertainty that you could even destroy the shells that your friends have become, because somewhere inside they are still those you know."

Gallius steps closer to Chi-Yosh, reaching out to take his hand. "We must face the future together," she says calmly. "I do not truly believe we shall fail. We know what the dangers are, and we shall face them. They are deadly to be sure, but already we are on the path to save ourselves and Creation. For what it is worth, I believe in you, Chi-Yosh."

Davron nods, stepping forward to join them. "It is not unworthy of a friend to watch those he cares about, and stand ready to deal with them should they fall to darkness. You recall Sa O Ket of Kish, and their parting words - the three were once four, and they did that service for their companion in his time."

"We will get the Book," says Chi-Yosh, "But the First Solars had such power at their hands, had the Sidereals to forsee what would happen. How is it they did not have the power to change before it was too late, but we will succeed?" A firm squeeze of her hand. "The biggest comfort is that Helios has accepted and is aware of the Solars' mistakes, and now offers us the choice to change. If he can believe that we can succeed where the others did not, then surely that means something."

Chi-Yosh looks back to Davron, only nodding and remaining quiet. Though, before everyone turns to go, he finally says, "It is not that it is not a right thing to do, that worries me. It is that moment of weakness that causes me to hold back. The hesitation."

---

In a deserted cave, with the distant sound of water the only distraction, the Solar party finds the next scene in this twisted performance. They also find the bones and ancient equipment of a prior expedition into the Labyrinth, and after a few minutes of examination, everyone agrees that the three men who died here are not part of the scene meant for them. They saw their own dark reflections in the Labyrinth of Lies, and death came for them. Was it from their comrades, or did they do the deed themselves? The answer is lost to the centuries.

Beyond the bones is a table of rock, apparently high enough that the tide which washes through this cave periodically will not damage the books that rest there. The captain's logbook is there, along with a bloodied dagger, and again it bears Ramar's name.

As before, Ramar steps forward and picks up the log. He leafs through it slowly, reading aloud for his comrades' benefit.

"'I thought I had found a new destiny on land. I joined the court of a Queen, whom I admired because she made her own way. But her methods were fierce, and the people trembled. And yet she herself was not the monster they depicted. I was of two minds about the matter - should I stay, and arbitrate some peace between the frightful queen and cowering people, or should I set sail again? Something compelled me to remain.'"

"'Finally the matter was decided for me - the wind arose, and blew me where it wished, as before. I decided to approach the Queen and tell her the last truth I knew, the only one I thought could sway her from her present course. I approached her and said..'"

The sailor's voice wavers but does not halt. "'I love you, my queen, and I have loved you since the day I met you'." His reading continues. "'For my insolence, she struck me, and banished me from the kingdom. I thought it strange that there were tears in her eyes when I left, but thereafter she issued a proclamation that she alone was queen, and that none other should share in her rule and her burden. And so I sailed away....'"

Ramar stares at the book, mouth opening and closing. Whatever words he might have said die in his throat. Unsteady hands close the book, and the Solar's gaze lifts. He draws in a deep breath, and turns towards Gallius. For the longest time, he watches her through tear-moistened eyes. "I love you, my queen," again his voice wavers, but as he speaks the truth behind the words lends the Solar strength, "I have loved you since the day I met you."

Gallius stands there, uncertain how to react. She at first shies her eyes away, wondering silently how she has so many times faced death with complete confidence and now finds herself terrified of love. Finally she looks back, her voice far from its usual calm, "Ramar, I.. I never realized. I never thought.." She struggles on, "I haven't understood my feelings since this came," she says, reaching up to indicate her caste mark.

The Lioness has never looked more unsure of herself. She shuts her eyes, draws in a deep breath, then lets it out in a ragged sigh, trying to understand the storm that rages inside. What she says surprises her. "A queen is lonely on her throne. I have long run away from feeling, thinking I could hide from it. I thought there was no place for it, now. I believed I had no purpose now, except to do what Helios wished. But it's not true." She agonizes for a while longer and finally says the hardest part of all, "I love you, Ramar, but I am afraid."

"I am afraid too, Gallius." Ramar walks towards Gallius, taking a moment to try and calm the emotions roiling within. "I've been afraid for far too long. Too afraid to say even that. Until now." He embraces her gently, eyes shut tight. "I love you," he manages once more, in a voice scarcely more than a whisper.

Davron watches in respectful silence. This is something he would never have imagined in his wildest dreams. But now... he has nothing to say, indeed, feels it would be wrong to speak, lest he interrupt the moment. For now, he will wait - only when Ramar and Gallius are ready will they all move on.

Gallius simply stands there at first, as if she has not the slightest idea what she is supposed to do. Finally she reacts, her arms slipping about Ramar. She answers more surely, "I love you, Ramar." She lets her eyes slip shut, knowing that this cannot last long enough, but hoping to accept and enjoy it while it does. After some time she finally whispers, "Still we must go on." Remembering that Davron and Chi-Yosh are both there makes her step from the embrace with a bright blush. Still, her nervous smile makes it clear she does not regret what just happened.

---

Through the surf and across a mist-shrouded beach the Solars move, all walking silently. The thoughts of each are similar, but moving in directions unique to the thinker. And so it is that the group encounter another set of monuments. These are paintings, executed boldly across the cliff walls that adjoin the beach, in the style of the Western artists.

On them, Davron sits upon a bloodied throne, with a sword in one hand and a key in the other, dispensing justice to all comers via his peculiar machine. It seems that there are more sorrowful faces as citizens are led to the dungeon, and fewer men go free. It is further noted that many of those being escorted away are craftsmen themselves - they wear the aprons and smocks and tool-belts of their chosen professions. Mechanists, engineers, and other thinkers are being methodically taken away to some nameless fate. Near them on the painting, a clerk reads mechanically from a scroll he holds in both hands - and on the scroll is the legend 'All Those That Call Exception To The Craft Of The King Shall Be Put To Death'.

And in a twisted version of the moment of hesitant romance, it seems that Davron has gained a queen for himself. The face is clear enough, and though she retains the elegant attire of someone her station, the face of Davron's cousin Willow has lost its attractive innocence as her grief is bared in the painting. And here too, expertly executed, are the very slaver's chains and collar around her pretty throat that Davron recalls from his rescue. The chains attach to the throne.

Davron looks shocked as he passes along the frescoes. "N-no... I'd never do that..." he begins, speaking of the cruel craftsman-king's edict, but bites his lip, remembering the very first carving at the head of the labyrinth. He came very close to doing that very thing to his father, did he not? He struggles with that thought... until his eye falls upon Willow. And now he is simply horrified - but a lot less uncertain. "No," he says firmly. "That I _would_ not do. Not that way."

Gallius frowns at the unsettling image before her. "This is a lie," she says simply. "It might have happened, once upon a time. Were things greatly changed, but not now. Davron, you would not do that." She turns to the craftsman, nodding again, "I know you will not, because you will always have friends to help you remember who you are."

This time there are no convenient tools, no chisel and hammer. There is only the bald assertion of domination, executed in paints and on rock, shaped by the magics of a long-dead sorcerer.

"Davron, I know you. You have become more than this. You have risen above this," speaks Ramar after a time. He walks towards his friend, "Perhaps you will hold others to as high a standard as you hold yourself... but you are kind. One of the kindest souls I know."

Chi-Yosh steps up beside Ramar. "Yes." Everything he feels has been said, but the Dawn looks over the painting, wondering just what it is that is hidden here. But this is the third Act, the most harsh, and possibly the most deceptive of the levels - could the truth be watered down here?

Davron does not respond right away, but instead studies the rock intently, the initial shock giving way first to understanding, and then to resolve. Finally, he acts. Tying a rope to an arrow, he fires it at the peak of the cliff, where it lodges in an unseen crevice - or perhaps right into the rock itself, driven by the righteous anger of a man slandered.

First he climbs up to the clerk beside the throne, and draws the war hammer from his belt. Channeling his knowledge of stone and workmanship, he systematically smashes the title of the scroll. "Doubt my craft though I may," he yells, over the crash and tinkle of shattering stone, "I will never again take it out on others. I will face the faults in my work squarely - correct them if I am able - but I will not hide from them."

And at last, climbing up to the portrait of Willow, the depictions of the chains and collar are likewise erased. "And never - never - NEVER would I hold my cousin where she did not want to be!" Davron's hammer raises again, as if preparing to eradicate the picture of Willow as well... but he hesitates, and lowers his hand again. "If she would freely be mine... I dare not call it false that I would be with her," he says with a sigh, in a much softer voice.

He looks down, again, at the painting, and sees that the last link of the chain, the one that bound her to the throne, remains untouched. His voice rises again in wrath. "But whether she would or would not be mine..." Launching himself from the cliff with both feet, he lets himself fall down the rope by just enough, drawing back his hammer. "SHE WOULD BE FREE!" And with that, the hammer smashes with all of Davron's might, obliterating the last vestige of the chain utterly.

And with that blow, cracks spread from the impact point in a growing web, enveloping the entire cliff face. There is a rumbling, and the portrait begins to crumble, large slabs of stone slipping from the portrain to fall in ruin on the ground below. The arrow far above pulls loose, sending Davron plummeting, and with a great effort he manages to land safely, then scramble away as the entire cliff falls forward in a clatter of boulders.

---

The final three scenes of the Third Act - for this can be nothing else - are less of a production and more of a shared experience, the crescendo of madness that is the Labyrinth's final attack against its victims.

They are witnessed by the Solars, who feel themselves drawing very near the end of their tortuous journey. In the first, Ramar watches himself sailing back to Creation and attempting negotiation. The sailor has at last found his own wind, and in a final display of futile love strives to assuage the angry Tyrant Queen and the mindless justice of her now-rival, the Clockwork King.

Between them he stands, and between their approaching armies he sails his ship up the rivers of Creation. And on the deck of that ship he lays out a plan for peace - to take the best from each kingdom and make two glorious realms from the sin-stained powers that even now offend the gods with their blasphemies.

On some evening, some force - it is not clear whose - destroys the ship, and Ramar barely escapes with his life. Peace is not to be.

For his part, the traveler from the Su'katan village, whose tale Chi-Yosh has heard from the old crone, has decided that assassinating the two rival tyrants is what will do the world the most good. He has prepared his plans; he has laid his traps against such a day. The allies he gathered from the Lunars and Sidereals have come to distract the King and Queen from their imminent war, while he brings a razor-sharp knife named The Final Instrument of Peace and attempts to infiltrate the paranoid security of both tyrants.

Despite his wisdom, despite his preparations, he remembers them as friends - and he cannot carry through with the act. And in the dark, as he turns the knife upon himself in impotent frustration, the two rulers dispatch their strike forces against his home village. From it no more young men will come; from it no more dreams of peaceful habitation will spring. All that remains of it come dawn is ash, and silence.

And at the end of time, the Tyrant Queen and the Clockwork King wage their war. For his part, Davron cannot abide the mad caprices of his rival; for her part, Gallius refuses to share any part of the world with a rival, even one she created herself. And so their armies fall upon each other, and Creation runs red with blood. The Sun is snuffed out; the Moon falls; the Stars themselves fade, as all hope is lost. All is dark.

"Where there is darkness," speaks Ramar, his voice filled with an almost grim determination, one fueled by a mix of emotions. Everything from fear and anger at what might have happened, to joy that it has not yet happend, and finally, resolve, resolve to keep it from happening, are present in his voice. "We shall bring light." His Caste Mark begins to glow, Essence flowing through his anima. "This is what the Sidereals fear. What we might harbor in our own hearts. I, I begin to understand why. But what can we do? What must be done to avoid this, to keep darkness from swallowing everything? I do not know. Not yet."

As the light of Ramar's Caste Mark grows, the Solars see four figures standing distant - their other selves, as the narrative depicted them.

Gallius, the Tyrant Queen, now revealed as little more than a sapling who would not bend in the strong wind and instead broke.

Davron, the Clockwork King, who was tortured by the whimsy of the human heart and fled from its domination.

Ramar, the Wanderer, who tried to protect his friends and hoped to find the strength around him, forgetting the strength within.

The shade of Chi-Yosh, in whose hands life and death was found, who was so balanced between the poles of his life that he moved in no direction at all.

Ramar walks to his shade, his Caste Mark grows brighter, the circle within a circle almost engulfing him for a moment, repelling the shadows that linger around him. When he speaks, his voice flows with the strength of the Unconquered Sun, who now burns brightly upon his forehead, illuminating the without from within. _**Ramar. You have the strength and direction you so desperately search for. Do not overlook yourself. Do not forget that a single stone can alter the course of a river forever.**_ He turns to his friends, once more, _**Thank you my friends.**_ and his voice slowly glides down, "It is you who have helped me to realize this."

"You are the fear. You are the doubt. You are the weakness that I once was doomed to be," says Gallius as she approaches this mirror of herself. "You are the lies and cowardice that would wrest the crown from my head," she growls. In a rising voice she continues, "I am the justice, I am the mercy, I am the Chosen of Helios, and I have come from the edge of despair and death to tell you that I am NOT AFRAID!" And with a surge of power Midmorning Sakura strikes in an arc like a glowing sunrise, shattering the counterfeit.

Davron looks at his alter-ego wonderingly. How alike, and how very different, than meeting the simulacrum of himself at Kish. "You are what I could become..." he says quietly. "You feared - I fear human suffering, for others as much as for myself... and so you fled from humanity and buried yourself in your work, hoping to eradicate suffering entirely. But you cannot flee from humanity entirely without denying the humanity in yourself." He falls silent and gazes into the Clockwork King's eyes.

"Embrace humanity, Clockwork King!" Davron exhorts. "Embrace the fear and the pain, for it is part and parcel with love and happiness and all that we hold dear!" He steps forward and hugs his alter-ego tightly, just as he had held the shade of his father, back at the Carnival that seems a lifetime ago. In a hoarse whisper, tears running down his eyes as if trying to absorb the Clockwork King's grief at what he had become, he adds, "For it is true, what they say. Pain shared is halved, joy shared is doubled."

Chi-Yosh is struck with the potential of their destruction. While the prophecy of the Second Age is well known, and the memories of the First Age are remembered, the prophecy is general, and memories are dull and faded. What has transpired is the personal details of destruction, at the cause of the self. He walks to his shade in the deep, circling one possibility of the future, steadily running its meaning over in his mind. He has always stood on self-purification and perfection, honing the self to a fine edge. Doubt is the flaw that can dull any such blade. But what he realizes is that failure will happen, weakness and hesitation can occur. They are necessary to know you are alive, aware of one's real limitations. And they will be overcome. The diciplined one cannot exist without them, and yet cannot be stopped by them, for one confident and self-aware will see the true answer to any problem. He stares into the face of his shade, the assured gaze seeing into every dark corner, until it is too clear and translucent

He stares into the face of his shade, the assured gaze seeing into every dark corner, until it is too clear and translucent to be seen, fading away.

Beyond the darkness is a door of orichalcum, and beyond the door is an enormous chamber. It is cylindrical in shape, with numerous shelves for books and other assorted things gathered here. There is a great table at the center of the room, with a niche wherein a single throne is placed - the head of the table. Around it are chairs.

The shelves are crammed with books, gems, rods and nicknacks of all descriptions. This is truly a treasure-trove worthy of a legendary sorcerer.

Upon the table is a particularly large volume, closed and sealed. It is simply marked THE GREAT BOOK OF KOL, in ancient letters.

Davron steps forward to the table. All the other books in the room are temporarily forgotten - after all, the one on the table is clearly the primary object of their search. "I suppose it's not surprising," he says, with a half smile. "Bagrash Kol held great power _and_ great arrogance, if the stories are true. Naturally, even his book must be Great."

"I imagine it's also protected in unpleasant ways," suggests Gallius. She looks over the wonders slowly, obviously not in her element. "We should try and take this library back with us, if we can. Cloudburst would be rather upset with me if I left behind such a treasure trove."

Davron nods, turning to look around the room. "And the key to Kol's Book must be present somewhere - though it may not be in this room." He looks at the entry door. "More importantly, though, I suspect there's another way in and out of this chamber. Surely Bagrash Kol did not brave the Labyrinth every time he wanted to enter this room - much less whoever else would come to sit in these other chairs."

"Davron.. we need not ever brave it, either," says Gallius. She laughs softly, noting, "I think we can likely find a fitting verse to describe a door of pure orichalcum that lies beyond a maze full of terrible lies. Let us not forget the great gift of Sa."

Chi-Yosh says, "But let us not be too hasty." Glancing about at the many shelves, "If the great sorcerer decided putting the key to his book in the same room was too simple, we will need to search beyond."

Two hours of productive searching yield several useful items and hordes of interesting books, all from a period of about three hundred to four hundred years. Some are from the Shogunate; others are from Threshold libraries or even stranger sources. A few bear the imprint of the nascent Realm of the time.

The throne itself seems to be a magical transportation system, now un-powered, and explains how the sorcerer was able to bypass his own protections.

Finally, the key to the Great Book is discovered. The Book's seal unlocks, and the intricate, almost Autochthonian craftsmanship of the thing releases pages which haven't seen human eyes in five hundred years.

**Your command?** The voice rings suddenly through the air as the book is opened, and the Solars immediately discern that its source is the book itself. It sounds strangely like the voice of the Book of Three Circles, encountered in the past during their return from Gaia. It seems that the master sorcerer attempted to make something like that legend for himself.

Davron exchanges glances with his companions, and then addresses the book. "I seek the the Book of Three Circles, which is said to be in a sand-fortress in the south. Tell me where the fortress resides, and what you know of both the fortress and the Book."

**Your information is incorrect. The Book of Three Circles is located in the city of Sperimin,** the book's voice resonates. **You are possibly referring to Realm Outpost 4332, at which point my master discovered the way to remove the Book from that city.**

And so saying, the book's pages flip of their own accord. They open to a new page, on which is a barbarian song-line, apparently inscribed by hand. **Follow this route to reach the Outpost.**

Davron nods, and addresses the book again. "You say that your master discovered how to remove the Book. Did he attempt to do so, and if so, what happened?"

**He did not make the attempt.**

Chi-Yosh peers at the book. If it, and thus Kol, knew where the Book of Three Circles is, he that had actual notes from the Book itself, the sorcerer may have then found some traces of the Solar Circle. "Do you have any pieces of Solar Sorcery within your pages?"

**I do. You are required to provide proof of your authority in order to gain access to Solar Circle magic.**

Davron's Caste Mark illuminates the book with golden light. "I claim the authority of the Solar Exalted."

**I acknowledge that authority,** the Book replies. **You have access to three spells and twenty-two procedures.**

"Provide a list of the spells and procedures," Davron says, instinctively adopting the book's stilted and formal mode of address, rather than the pleasantries and courteous decorations of normal human speech.

**Solar Circle spells: City Seed. Mirage of Protective Shelter. Solar Sanctuary. Procedures: Homunculus engineering Phase 3. Simulacrum creation, Phases 1 through 5. Soul conduit engineering, Phases 1 through 4. Autochthonian metamorphosis. Soul integration, Phases 1 through 3. Notes on Soul integration provided by D'gar'k'krak. Seven incomplete texts.**

Gallius is naturally not sure what that all means. Still, the sorcery sounds useful. But there is one question that is on her mind, though she's not sure which answer would be best for the world. "Do you know where the Eye of Autochthon lies?" she asks.

**Its current location is unknown.**

"I pray it remains that way," says Gallius, smiling. "So it seems that the world at least has one less danger. At least until it is revealed again. Should that happen, we must find some way to safely lose it for all time."

"I shall ask a question as well," speaks Ramar. He spends a moment recalling the throne, "How is the throne within the fortress operated, if it is still functional?"

**The throne requires that the Essence transmission system function again. This is not possible without the Eye of Autochthon installed, although modifications to the system are possible. To operate the throne requires 50 motes of Essence through the conduits.**

A few more minutes of questioning reveal the basic idea - 50 motes will get one person to wherever the throne leads to. They themselves must also have enough power to draw people through the system, and they must be skilled and equipped enough to modify a complex arrangement of magical components to receive that energy.

Soon Davron is making use of the various artifacts and tools at hand in the throne room, re-carving Essence flow lines away from the tap (clearly once driven by the Eye of Autochthon) to a jury-rigged sphere beside the throne, with frequent questions to the Book of Kol. "It will take most of one of our Essence to operate this," he says, tapping the sphere. "And we don't know what I might be facing at the other end, so I may need all the resources at my disposal. Will someone volunteer to energize the Throne in my stead?"

Ramar steps up to the task, and as Davron seats himself in the chair, carrying the Essence-manipulating artifacts and the Book itself. "Harmonize your anima with this sphere, Ramar," Davron instructs, "and will it to activate. Chi-Yosh, Gallius - stand by to catch him afterward, just in case. Ready whenever you are..." He braces himself.

In the guts of the ancient fortress, Davron works like a madman to restore the power systems. He is aided by a simple fact: before the structure became capable of flight, there was already an extensive distribution system that powered such things as the Labyrinth and the Throne. The Eye allowed Bagrash Kol to simplify considerably, but he never did remove the older components. And so, drawing on the seething tides of geomancy hundreds of yards below him, the craftsman labors.

More than once he is called upon to destroy a wandering elemental corrupted and drunk from the power. And during one particularly troublesome rearrangement of jade and other elements, he narrowly escapes having much of his hand transmuted into stone as well. But within two hours, the work is complete. In the secret chamber, the other Solars see the Throne growing radiant with light. And through it comes Davron, ready to show them the way out.

Making use of Davron's work, the circle methodically cleans out the hidden chamber below, leaving little behind save the furniture itself, for everything might have some worth. The path home is one full of strange silences and uncertainty over the revelations the Labyrinth's challenges brought to the light. But for good or ill, everyone who made that journey has changed forever.

And so when the city of Bridal Veil is reached, Gallius explains that she must go for a short time back to Roleyn, to finish some business. Whatever it is she seeks to do, she does not explain, save to say, "I am not afraid. I am of the Chosen of Helios."
