# Gods of Eden 2005-01-29

There is a songline, roughly transcribed in a book by Bagrash Kol's own hand, that tells the way to a place in the south. It is this place that Korash's future incarnation described as the resting place to "the key of the Book of Three Circles".

... First day in Hollow, smelled the soil.

... Chased the Grey River, always on the right.

... Skipped stones at sunrise when Luna recalled

... the first light of the journey.

...

... Failed, waded across

... and left the river

... on the left.

...

... Caught snails at Sweet Star,

... kept the river in sight.

...

... Harmed no tree and started a fire

... with gleaming black stones

... under the crossed blades of two

... sycamore saplings.

...

... Faced the rising sun and danced

... naked,

... feet wet in the river,

... under the branches

... over the hot ash.

...

... South.

...

... South.

...

... The river behind, Silver Lake

... ahead,

... with full-moon-shine-reflecting-waters

... rippling.

...

... Snared five fish on three nights,

... no hooks or nets.

... Fed each a coin of silver,

... set it free.

...

... Cool water, pale skin,

... breathed water right up

... to the wood webbed mud clay grounds

... and a carpet of green things that grow.

...

... Found the first fruit of a young

... Cobune. Then back to find

... three berries on a wilting branch.

...

... Ran east.

...

... Broke the Cobune, planted the berries

... at the foot of a clustered fern in the shell.

... Ate the fern heart and took the Path

... of Leopards south.

...

... Slipped through the gullet of Sandwall

... Caves slippery under feet. Chased

... bats on hands and knees in the dark.

... Brought no light.

...

... Four days of darkness, emptied skins

... and left food, walked

... like a man again.

...

... Tightly shut eyes, felt the desert.

... Heard the sand-mice claws scratch the

... yellow lime and followed them.

...

... Opened lids and saw Luna

... first.

...

... Spilled blood at Blue Nectar Pool,

... sung in a sandstorm near Flat Top,

... south at the Nest of Mice.

...

... Saw five days come

... smiled and laughed and rested

... until next time.

The songline details the trip of travelers moving south from old Hollow - now the city of Nexus - and through the jungles and under the mountains dividing the East from the South. In addition to mere directions it includes notes on hazards to be expected, things that travelers must do, spirits to placate, and similar important details of any expedition.

And it is this route that the Solars must follow to locate the key to the salvation of their world.

---

Promising "some idea" to deal with Raksi, Ramar has temporarily taken his leave from his Circlemates and has gone on a journey of his own. And so Gallius, Davron and Chi-Yosh remain to walk - or fly - along the prescribed path. Equipped with volos, their weapons and armor, the three make their start in Nexus.

The colors of autumn are nowhere more vivid than in the East, where the element of Wood predominates. The Month of Ascending Fire is particularly beautiful in the southern portions of the Eastern Threshold, at least until the forests give way to jungles. There, of course, the brilliant manifold of jungle colors hold sway year round.

Obeying the strictures of the songline, the Solars remain on the east side of the Grey River even as they fly south. They skip stones across the waters under moonlight, and sometimes catch glimpses of strange, frog-like creatures called _kappa_ that dart out of the water to catch their rocks before submerging again.

At the proper time they cross over, taking the west bank and traveling south. And at the proper time, they discover that the _kappa_ have returned their skipping stones to them. These stones break open the shells of the Sweet Star snail, and the Solars share this unsavory feast with their amphibious fellow-travelers. In doing so they learn that the creatures are the servants of Ogime, the Frog Queen, a legendary elemental. The Frog Queen now shows them favor for their kindness, and the journey south will be much safer.

The Sword Gate looks nothing of the kind - merely a pair of sycamore trees bent across each other. Nevertheless, the Solars remember to start a fire with no living wood. There is ample dead timber, and over the fire they are hailed by the spirit of this place, who approaches and converses.

This being knows much of the doings of the East and the Southeast, and from it they learn many things about Raksi and her fellow Lunars that are hidden. The spirit whispers about the strange men and less-than-men who prowl the distant jungles. It teaches them a secret way to take an egg from any nest, no matter how well-guarded. In the morning the Solars rise to find their host departed.

---

In the Silver Lake, the Solars find fish enough. They catch them with their own hands, then feed them silver coins as the song demands before releasing them. And on the third night, they see an apparition on the water. A woman, pale and evanescent, walks on the surface of the water clad in silver raiment that shows only hints of the rotting of age. She is a ghost, and the three Solars can feel the terrible power that she holds in check. Nevertheless she does nothing more than appear in the moonlight, then vanish again just as wordlessly.

Through the jungles of the south they move, nourishing themselves on the berries and fruits of the place. Sometimes they plant seeds in appreciation to the gods of the forest; sometimes they run from, or chase away, spirits who have been angered. More than once they meet with tribes who live in the fens and marshes closer to the Inner Sea, but the mark of the Frog Queen's gratitude protects them from those who venerate her.

Finally the Solars come to the entrance to a maze of tunnels that bore through the southeastern mountains - the Sandwall Caves. From the songline, the volos may be too large to fit into these cramped confines, and a decision must be made about what to do with them.

After having lost their ships twice, the Circle had all ready given some thought to the matter. While they are out in the wilderness, the potential still demands precaution. Digging a hole, the Circle sit crosslegged, their animas flooding the hole around them. After a time, veins of mineral weave together into a face upon the hole's wall. Shoulders That Hold the Earth agrees to watch over their buried volos - in exchange, the Solars remain beneath the dirt in their vehicles for half a day, their presence drawn into the rock and soil. Once the time is up, they crawl up, dusty and plunging yet again into cramped, dark spaces.

Through the confines of the Caves the Solars travel; sometimes they are on their feet, but more often than not they must be on their knees. The caves are full of bloodthirsty vampire bats and worse dangers, and the Solars find themselves almost instinctively using their power to close bleeding wounds by force of will.

Four dark days pass in this fashion, or rather four endless nights. At the end of it, nobody is without some measure of spite for the merciless caves. And yet the sight they emerge to makes it all worthwhile.

Through the caves the Solars have felt a flow of Essence surrounding them, and now they understand it. Formerly they suspected it to be merely proximity to the Earth, but as they emerge they realize the truth. At the sound of distant animals scratching, they realize they are nearly out - but outside the sand is a glimmering, opalescent mass of unearthly beauty. There is no mundane desert like this in the South; the Exalted have passed through the mortal plane and now dwell in the world of unmaterialized spirits, the echo of Creation wherein the gods live.

Here and there the Solars can see strange creatures, burrowing and nesting, as they move across this strange desert. At the Blue Nectar Pool, their blood transforms the water from blue to red, and they are greeted by the voice of the god of the pool: "Find the Sandstorm God and beg him for passage."

This being proves to be a mighty whirlwind that blows across the deserts, calling up storms in his wake that are seen in the mortal world. For an hour the Solars ride within him, buffeted by the high-speed winds and emerging with bruises and breaks.

Finding a nest of strange, sand-swimming creatures near the ending point of their wild journey, the Solars obey the final stanzas of the songline and obtain rides on them. The beasts are friendly enough, and their migratory patterns carry the group for five days through the abode of the gods. Near evening of the fifth day, the Solars notice a distant spire jutting out of the sand and leap from the backs of their steeds to investigate. They may have found what they seek.

---

The spire is only a few feet of jade that projects above the sand. In their dematerialized state, however, the Solars pass down through the forgiving sands, through the dirt below, and into the cathedral-like stillness of an ancient outpost of the First Age's Realm.

Gallius projects her attention about her, feeling as if she were wandering in a dream. "So this is what it is like to be a spirit, then?" she murmurs, looking towards her companions, wondering just how they view this strange state. And this even stranger destination. "Still, something about this feels right, somehow."

"It is," says Chi-Yosh, having seen the beauty of the alien spirit world. The lands of Syllum and Korad are joined by a particular pool, where he has spent a few nights delving into. "But it feels different here. I don't know how."

Diaphanous fingers brush along the surface of a wall not touched by human hands for untold ages - a situation that, thanks to Davron's immaterial state, does not change now. "A long pilgrimage - not the hardest one yet to come, but worthwhile for the journey alone. I needed this." Davron smiles. "Come. Let us find what we seek."

The fortress has the architectural niceties of the old Realm, the attention to aesthetic that divorces it from the merely military structures the Solars are more familiar with seeing. Nevertheless its artistic vision doesn't detract from the simplicity of its design, and the Solars find it easy enough to navigate. In the planning rooms, the Solars find that they cannot touch any of the books or documents, and for a time they doubt that they can locate the fabled key to the Book.

In due time, however, they find the officer's quarters. And here, perhaps, simply laying on a man's desk, is the imperishable paper used for recording official documents at one point in the history of the First Age. And on it, it describes some of the procedures taken to secure the Realm's most treasured assets against treachery. And in this list, the eyes of the three light up as they discover something: "Per Order 927 of the Solar Deliberative, the Book of Three Circles must remain within the confines of the City of Sperimin. It may not be withdrawn without a countermanding order revoking 927."

"Davron, please try to recall what you see here for me, would you? It's so beautiful, don't you think?" Gallius admires the way the architects made something as simple as a straight line and an arc so very beautiful. She is little help in reading things, not knowing Old Realm. She looks over the papers, then to Davron and Chi-Yosh, "Is there anything here of use?"

"So we must find a way to revoke that order," says Gallius. She considers for a moment, thinking back. "Do you remember when we saw the Deliberative?" she asks softly. "They were all Exalts, but there were marks of rank, beyond simply that which we wear upon our brows."

Davron nods. "Yang also showed me a vision of the Deliberative once," he adds, directing his next question to Yang. _It seems that for us to claim the Book, we must first claim the authority of the Deliberative to rescind this prior order. Do you have any ideas on what might enforce the Deliberative's will in this case, and what they might recognize as authority?_

_The Book itself is quite capable of acting to enforce any order the Deliberative gave regarding it,_ replies Yang.

_As to what they recognize as authority, all I know is that the Book was obedient to the will of the Solar Deliberative,_ the Sidereal soul adds after a moment of thought.

Gallius frowns in thought, "I don't think it will simply be a matter of our current leadership position. I have a feeling we will need some proof. The book is able to defend itself, but will it be eager to be used once more, even by lesser masters than it once had? Or must be have some sign, instead. Perhaps Yang could tell us more of how the Deliberative actually worked? Who was at its head? Was it a council, or just one person?"

This line of questioning leads to more productive information from Yang. The Solar Deliberative was the organized body of the Solars, Lunars and Sidereals: a body of five hundred and one entities. There were of course more Exalted alive at any time than this number, but it was recognized that not all of the Chosen wished to sit in Meru and play politics. And so five hundred Exalted would form the Deliberative itself, and from the number of the Chosen a Heirophant would emerge to guide this body in its decision-making.

The selection of these was principally left to the men and women themselves; all had a place on this august body, but by mutual agreement no more than five hundred would sit at a time. The Solars held the supreme authority; below them, and assisting them, were the Lunars. And below them were the Sidereals, who acted as advisors and guides.

It was agreed by all that the Sidereals, being the thinkers and planners, should not lead. Their way was to explore many paths at once; the way of the Solars and Lunars was to choose only one path to walk, and suffer the consequences if they chose wrongly. There are many stars in the sky, but there is only one sun and one moon.

The Celestial Bureaucracy worked in tandem with the Deliberative and its subordinates. The gods would perform their duties, while the human Exalted would govern the mortal world. The head of the Celestial Bureaucracy was the pantheon itself, but the rulers of living Creation were the Exalted, for it was their prize for winning the Primordial War.

Gallius listens to the recounting of the Deliberative and the governing of Creation. "So who was the last Heirophant? Perhaps if we had some symbol of his or her authority, it might prove we are indeed worthy of the legacy of the Deliberative? I simply think the Book will desire something to back-up the claims of any who come to it. Then again, perhaps simply the order number itself is enough after so long?"

Yang's response is proxied through Davron. _The Last Heirophant was beyond my time, so I do not know. By tradition the Heirophant would wear the Ring of the Deliberative, which functioned much like a king's crown or scepter - a token of his station, with additional magical power that facilitated the business of the Heirophant. Other members of the Deliberative often fashioned similar tokens or trappings for themselves, to make their duties lighter or more convenient._

"So perhaps we might find that ring and have some sign of our station," says Gallius softly. "But finding that might be almost as difficult as finding the Book has been. And unless there is something here to help us, we have no where to begin."

"I do not think a mere ring alone will make one of us the Hierophant, and I wonder if the Book would be so easily fooled - if it is not true," Davron says. "We learned in the Labyrinth that all of us are uncertain about our authority, about whether we, personally, are fit to rule. If we are to claim the Book, that uncertainty must end. At a bare minimum, whoever would claim authority to countermand 927 must believe that they _should_ hold the power of the Deliberative, and that their present lack of actual power is but a temporary deficiency to be corrected.

Gallius considers for a time, quite lost in thought. Whatever comes to her mind causes her to bring a sound to this place that echoes off the walls dully, as if they were hungry for the sound of joy as she laughs softly. "I wonder now, if this is how the Solars felt back then? Still, someone must be willing to accept the duty." She looks at her friends, then, and says, "I will not hesitate again. I will restore the authority of the Heirophant. I only hope you shall serve as part of the Deliberative as well. We are starting rather small, of course, but with the Book of Three Circles, I believe we shall grow far more swiftly."

"And when we grow," picks up Chi-Yosh, "We will have enemies who seek the book. Our goals are just, and if our actions remain so, I will defend the book and all that its powers hold to us."

"Is there anything else written here of use?" asks Gallius. "I have a feeling we aren't likely to come this way for some time." She studies the room once more, wanting to remember this place. "Take a good look. I can't read a word of what is here, unfortunately, so it is up to you to make sure we know everything we can."

Much of what is written concerns places and things that the Solars can confirm were destroyed, or are now held by the Realm, or are otherwise accounted for - for example, some of the now-ruined aerial fortresses that Lookshy commands.

A few resemble things that are now held in the fortress of Bagrash Kol, and the Solars remember that the man had knowledge of this place and the route to it. Of particular interest is the hint that Kol may have actually held the fabled Mantle of Brigid, although no sign of any such thing was found in the fallen fortress.

It could be nothing, but Davron and Gallius in particular remember that during the era in which Kol lived, the Empress was also reputed to have held the Mantle of Brigid.

Gallius listens to her friends recount what they find. The most interesting of course is the reference to the legacy of Brigid. In a very real way, they are pursuing it already. "Then we have but one thing to do. We will go put an end to that order and claim what is the right of the Deliberative to possess."
