# Gods of Eden 2005-01-30

As the Sun rises in the east, with Luna still drifting above the horizon, and the jewel that is Gaia glinting equidistant from both, Gallius for the first time ascends the Temple of One Thousand Steps in Calibas. The small town has profited greatly from the construction of the large temple. Soil from all over the Nation of the Sun was brought here and blessed by Gallius before it was made part of this construct. Stones as well were brought, and from every city one item that serves as some symbol of its identity was also delivered here and blessed by the Queen. Once prepared, these things were all placed on the immense pinnacle of the structure.

The caste mark of Gallius bursts into golden brilliance and she kneels first to Gaia, then to Luna, and then to the Sun. About her the shamans stand in a wide arch, each positioned near those city symbols they work closest to with their heads bowed and their offerings held out in front of them.

The Solar rises smoothly, drawing from her vestments a fine dagger of orichalcum. She sends her voice out into the sky, calling out, "We of the Nation of the Sun turn our faces to the heavens, making these offerings in gratitude to the God of Our Land, wishing only that he will smile upon his people."

The offerings then are brought to the priestess one at a time, each coming in the order they became part of the Nation of the Sun, an order she needs no lists to recall. For those shamans representing many small villages, each is still named, and the prayers are given at length by the shamans. The first is Sweet Melody of Bridal Veil, whose prayer is sung, asking only for continual prosperity and warm rains. Many prayers are much the same as this, for few places exist in the Nation where serious troubles are not being remedied already. The first offering is of the finest wines from the vineyards as well as the sweetest corn. These things are both held to the sky, then set in an enormous offering bowl that stands next to the altar.

The last prayer is from Creisol, who comes on behalf of the youngest of cities in the Nation. He fits well his roll, a young man barely old enough to be an apprentice priest, but his words are calm and proud. He brings the finest calf from his uncle's farm, and from his cousin's horses the finest foal. Both of these Gallius accepts, using the orichalcum knife to cut the bindings of the livestock and setting them, too, into the great bowl, the animals standing and watching the proceedings with a strange calm. The same calm radiates from Gallius as holds her hands over the offerings, singing a soft prayer.

When Gallius has sanctified the offerings, she steps back, reaching out to take the hands of the newest of shamans and the first, so that Bridal Veil will neve be forgotten for providing the beginning of the Nation. Then all voices are raised in song, singing in a tongue that many gathered, including Gallius herself, do not truly know. The words come from something ancient in her, so that even before Cloudburst translated for her, she knew the prayer of offering one of her sparks once used. Now the strength of that song, so long lying in ashes, has been rekindled here, and they are not missed by the Nation's God.

Directly above the offerings a ribbon of light unfurls, stretching out to extend across the full diameter of that bowl. A blast of crisp air, cool and fresh, flows over the priests and priestesses, and the ribbon glows more brightly, starting to spin more and more swiftly until it resolves itself into a form both familiar and alien to the eyes of men.

The figure has the long hair of a woman, formed of countless green stems, flowers bursting with color throughout the locks, and here and there are scattered decorations formed of growing things. Corn, wheat, and grapes and still more of the food the Nation relies upon for its survival can be found there. The face of the god is a vibrant green, with shining eyes of gold.

The God wears a robe of green, with fine silver strands drawn across it like a web. Strands that follow the very energy lines that make up the Nation, each pulsing with strength. "I am the Nation of the Sun," says the god in a deep, rich voice. The apple red lips of the god curve into a fond smile as she looks from face to face, meeting the eyes of every shaman, from the newest to the oldest, and finally she turns to Gallius.

Gallius bows deeply to the god of her Nation, and the great spirit smiles, bowing in turn. "I come to assure you of my favor, and to accept the gifts you have brought. I have heard the prayers of the people and smile upon their offerings. What was delivered to me today shall come back to you tenfold. There will be warm rains, and gentle winds, and the harvest shall be warded against the chill of winter and the greed of insects."

"The livestock shall be born whole and healthy, and your children will be able to swim in berries and cream," says the Nation of the Sun. "And to you my ear shall always be ready," she says, raising her arms to the sky. A soft light flows from her fingertips and she lowers her hands, palm-up, and from them sprout many small vines, fine as thread. Each vine draws to one of the shamans, and even as they stand gathered there cloaks of living green are woven upon them, marking their station so that all of their people will know them.

Gallius watches the ceremony with a pleased smile. She hoped the Nation of the Sun would be a warm and kind God, and it certainly seems to be true. Seeing the glow of faith and confidence grow brighter in the eyes of so many brings the queen great comfort. The Nation of the Sun finishes her work, turning her attentions back to the Zenith. "For you, High Priestess, there is no higher symbol I can give than that which is upon your brow. Our fates are bound, and I look to you and your circle to continue inspiring all of my children to greatness. Know that part of me goes with you always, Lioness." The Goddess smiles turning her face to the heavens once more. "Farewell, my people!" she cries clearly. About her an aura of gentle light comes into being, surrounding the offerings as well. In another burst of cool air both are gone.
