"Come back in five days," says Gallius, and those still on the airship nod in agreement and take to the sky. The circle has landed just outside the reaches of Denandsor's curse, the wind moving over the plains like a stroking hand. There's nothing but it's sound for miles.

Before the Solars, the city of Denandsor sparkles in the morning light. "It's like a city of crystal and diamonds," murmurs Gallius thoughtfully. "And yet in that place a dread unlike any other dwells. I hope we can find what we need. I hope there's something worth finding here." She frowns in thought, looking to Davron, "Are you ready to begin? We can attend you for a part of the way, but eventually we will be forced to leave."

Davron nods, brushing his fingers along the glowing gemstone in its socket. "If it's going to go wrong, hopefully it'll do so right away and you can drag me out. Other than that... I'm on my own." He looks out across the plains to the abandoned buildings. "Not that it'll go wrong, of course." Only his companions from the ordeal of the Labyrinth detect the note of uncertainty in that last sentence.

Chi-Yosh stares across the miles of plain to the tiny buildings of the city. They cannot draw too close to the city, for the powers reach beyond the walls. Soon, it will be the Dawn in those streets, alone in all but spirit. He wishes to see the wonders, but not under such pressure. Even if he can not go inside, when Davron returns, a rough map can be made, for understanding the city's layout would be a boon for the Solar's survival.

Davron grins at Chi-Yosh. "Look on the bright side. If... _when_ I come out again, at least we'll know that you'll only have one thing to worry about when it's your turn." Mind you, since that one thing is Raksi, one of the most dangerous Celestial Exalted now alive, it is quite a worry indeed. He looks into the stone again - to reassure himself, he recalls to his mind the process that produced the Hearthstone he now bears, trying to remember if there's anything he missed...

---

"Repel the curse of the Empty City? Are you crazy?" exclaimed Davron to Gallius several weeks ago, as she explained the plan to him. "That'd take... hmm... well, let's see, we've got the Stone of Mental Health we can tweak, but that won't have enough power on its own to last more than a few hours. Maybe if we can harness the nearby dragon lines and feed more power through them... but that'd take..."

Davron's formidable mind rises to the challenge, and eventually, he has come up with a plan. It starts with modifying the Manse of the Tranquil Forest so that its stone will reinforce the will of its bearer against fear, rather than clearing the mind of another - a relatively simple task, as it is closely akin to the original design of the Manse as the Solars first found it.

Channeling enough power into the stone to endure the awesome power of a Solar artifact run amok, though, requires more. The Great Machine's map indicates several nearby Manses along the dragon lines that feed into the Tranquil Forest. Under Davron's direction, as authorized by Gallius, the Nation's team of thaumaturges fans out to those sites of power and undertakes to alter those Manses as well, each subteam with a Dragon Prince to supervise the geomantic alterataions.

Their errands accomplished, the Dragon Princes converge on the Manse of the Tranquil Forest, each bearing a newly formed Hearthstone, where they find Davron putting the finishing touches of what looks like a relief map of the nearby area, with jade Hearthstone sockets where the other Manses would be. The new Hearthstones are installed in their appropriate locations, and Davron, Chi-Yosh, and the Dragon Princes meditate together to attune themselves to Tranquil Forest - the latter so that the arcane bond between the foreign Hearthstones and this Manse is cemented.

Finally, several days later, a new Hearthstone has formed in the remaining empty socket, a gemstone glowing and throbbing with energy in a way that makes an ordinary Hearthstone look like a rock.

While Davron prepares the magic, Gallius and Dace prepare the muscle. There are a few things to prepare for, and unfortunately, Raksi is just one of them. The Solars can't be sure of her limits, but when Davron suggests that if it can be imagined, it should be expected of a millenia old occultist, all bases must be covered. And the weakest point of all is the manse upon which this entire plan rests.

From the armies of the Nation of the Sun, the finest men are drawn and readied for a defensive battle. No less than a thousand of the best that can be found. They are outfitted completely and trained in the kind of warfare that will be most effective. With the potency of essence-bolstered teachers, the best of the best are turned into even more deadly weapons.

There are more than just men in this force, however. There are others who have a vested interest in the weakening of any of the anathema. That definition has faced some refinement since the Wyld Hunters faced their Solar prey, but in this case, it applies very well. The thousand finest soldiers will not be without the finest of commanders.

The forces of those who use occult is rarely limited to a few beastmen, however, and Gallius and Dace have bent their minds to this, as well. With Denandsor as a partial prize in this and the Book of Three Circles as the ultimate goal, the aid of Yurgen's circle is not hard to gain. Samea and her usual entourage of second circle demons will provide the last bricks in the great wall that shall defend the Manse of the Tranquil Forest.

Yet even the best laid plans occasionally are disrupted by surprises. Generally, those surprises are not pleasant ones, however. There are two odd additions to those hunting the book. Rumika has returned, and with her have come a pair of young girls, whose form blends that of human and bird into something that is, quite simply, gorgeous.

---

Even without the additional uneasiness generated by Denandsor's defenses, there is something eerie about a city that is totally empty of human life. Breezes whistle down empty streets, and at least here on the outskirts of the city, the occasional door hangs open where especially bold looters managed to grab a few handfuls of First Age trinkets before being driven away.

Further in, Davron is astonished by a skeleton at the foot of a tower, curled up in a fetal position. Surely no skeleton would have survived the centuries since the abandonment of the city? A moment's thought, and the shattered leg-bones of the skeleton, reveals the answer: the bones are hardly a decade old, and belong to a nameless Scavenger Lord who leapt from the tower when overcome by fear, and being thus crippled was unable to crawl much further before succumbing to catatonia and then starvation.

Shuddering, Davron moves on, thankful for the stone that will spare him from such a fate - if he can accomplish his task in time. For despite his painstaking handiwork, Davron knows that the modified Stone of Mental Health will eventually be no match for the defense system, and will last no more than a day before it will shatter under the strain as surely as that unfortunate man's legs.

It's an unfamiliar city, and any maps that might once have charted the city streets are lost to time - at least, no amount of preparatory research was able to find one. So Davron is without any guide to the control station for the city's automata. No guide, that is, except the automata themselves. After all, the whole point of this expedition is to be able to control the automata. And for that to work, the automata must have some occult link to their control station. And an occult link can be followed - if you can get hold of one end first.

After an hour or so of searching, Davron loctes a short and narrow tower that looks unstable. Perfect. Merely a block away is an automaton, inert and lifeless... until Davron makes an ostentatious effort to break into a nearby building.

_Halt!_ cries a metallic voice, and Davron sprints away, the thundering footsteps of the automaton at his heels. As he turns a corner, he stops by the tower, and directs a powerful blow with his hammer to just the right points at the base of the edifice. The automaton comes around the corner behind Davron - just in time for the entire tower to collapse atop it.

A mere falling tower is not enough to disable the work of the First Age, of course. But it is enough to slow it down and weaken it, allowing Davron to dodge the missiles from its dart-thrower with ease while he peppers it with his own arrows. Soon enough, the thing falls - and Davron pries apart the wreckage until he finds an orichalcum globe carved with runes of communication. With this as a focus, Davron summons a Servant of Infallible Location, and a sparrow of flame is Davron's guide through the Empty City.

Traveling further into the heart of the city, Davron is startled by life. The song of birds chirping, situated in nests nestled inbetween glass beads and crystals frozen in mid-air artwork. One of the birds, drawn curious by Davron's presence, flies closer - and is snatched out of the air by something that darts into existance and right out again. Immediately, he bestows essence to see beyond into the realm of Spirits, and spies Elemental worms sliding through the city. Unintelligent, the creatures have been drawn to the Essence of still-working artifacts, and the magic still remaining within the city for all these years.

From a nearby rooftop, Davron carefully studies the entrance to the building that the Servant is focused upon. As he'd suspected, two guardians stand to attention on either side of the door, and others are scattered around the perimeter. He can find no place to jump across without being detected - and although it's possible that they won't activate for someone trying to jump onto the roof of their own control building, he doesn't want to risk it.

Furthermore, he can see the markings carved along the eaves of the building, runes of protection and exclusion inlaid with precious metals, clearly wards against magical transportation. But wards that are a thousand years old and faded with time. No ward produced in the Second Age would endure at all after all this time - but even a First Age ward is, by now, weak enough to be broken with a little effort.

The automata awake to the _chunk_ of a grapple-arrow embedding itself in the wall above. Calling out warnings and threats, they fire their dart launchers at the Solar high above as he swings his body nimbly along the rope until he reaches the side of the building, but they are unable to prevent him from smashing a key section of the ward and retreating once more.

Davron flees across the rooftops until the automata cease in their pursuit and return to their vigil beside the doorway... their mechanical intelligence not comprehending that in allowing Davron to break the wards, their vigil has already failed. Once left alone, Davron's spell of transportation deposits him neatly inside the front door.

Finding the control room itself is a little harder without the spirit of flame left behind by Travel Without Distance, but still a fairly straightforward search for an accomplished occultist. And it is also not difficult for Davron to know when he has reached his destination.

A map of the city fills the center of the room, picked out in ivory, and with an extremely delicate filigree of Magical Materials along its surface. Scraping it all up wouldn't give you enough material to make even a Hearthstone amulet, but it is enough for the mesh to glow at a thousand points in the city. To Davron's mild disappointment, the map is unlabeled, but even an unlabeled map is eminently worth copying onto parchment.

Once this is done, Davron faces the final challenge. According to lore, the automata were loyal to the natives of Denandsor; Davron now wishes to convince the city's automata that Chi-Yosh and himself are natives. He begins to try to trace out the Essence conduits leading from the map, and finds various control panels which must've been intended to direct particular automata, or control the power system, but these do not help him - he does not intend to control automata one at a time, and certainly doesn't intend to turn them off.

Finally, after hours of painstaking study and false leads, he finds a room containing row after row of empty vials, each carved with familiar occult symbols of preservation. According to his occult analysis, the racks seem to be intended to convey occult signatures into the control system, and picking up one of the vials, he finds a tiny wisp of powdery red dust on the bottom - old dried blood. Davron carefully cleans four of the vials, and then fills them with blood samples from himself and the rest of the Circle. As he replaces them, they begin to glow with a faint light.

"Well! I hope this was the rack for citizens and not convicted criminals," Davron says wryly, and he makes his way back out to the front door. "Here goes nothing..." he says, and opens the door. The two automata that had shot at him before turn to face him, and before Davron can act, they lay hands on him... and simply lift him out of the doorway and close it behind him. _This area is restricted, citizen,_ one of them explains, in Old Realm. _Please move along._

The guardians of this city do not all operate on limited minds controlled by the center. And not all of the automata here take the addition of the first new citizen in centuries as a minor event. In fact, it draws one of those automata to rise to her feet and move on a course to intercept. She, if such a construct could be called a she, sends her instructions out to the wandering guards to find citizen A2546L and bring him to a civil service building not far from the outskirts of the city.

Davron is nonplused by the guards' polite requests to accompany them, but complies, at least at first. "Where are you taking me?" he asks, assuming that a friendly escort would be willing to answer straightforwardly.

"The Guide," answers the guard in it is emotionless, metallic voice. In the hands of guardians, Davron's trip is greatly sped-up as they are free to use the transit systems of the city, which were modelled after those in Yu-Shan. Davron finds himself sped along on a moving platform made of what appears to be silver lace, cut as thing as an egg shell but remains, even after so much time, harder than steel.

Davron is eventually escorted to a building built of pure, straight lines. The building simply has no curves in its construction. It's also remarkably plain compared to the rest of the city. Still, it has held up very well, showing fewer signs of wear than other structures. The great door swings wide without a squeak and Davron is then led to a room full of chairs, with several low desks positioned in an orderly way between them. Here and there old tomes lie. Without much protection, the paper has largely been devoured by the passing of time, but a few of the books have survived due to particularly skilled crafting. "The Guide will call you in," is all Davron is left with. The door is closed, and the Solar finds himself in a room that one was constantly crowded by those seeking permission to visit. And slowly time passes. It is a full five minutes before an adjoining door opens and a tinny voice calls out, "You may enter, citizen."

Puzzled, Davron walks through the door. "You wanted to see me, Guide?" he asks, addressing the owner of the tinny voice as he takes in the room he's just entered. Why does this Guide want to see him? It's obvious that the loremasters' knowledge of Denandsor is incomplete, since it said nothing about this Guide - but then, that's not surprising. What other secrets does this city hold?

"You are citizen A2546L, you were just entered into the central core, but you have no filled-out the proper paperwork," says the Guide. The automaton in this case is made of silver and brass, her appearance carefully crafted to make her seem as human as possible. A start contrast to her perfectly gleaming form are the rags that she wears. Once, she was apparently dressed in the livery of the bureaucracy of Denandsor. What remains is just moth eaten cloth. "You need to fill out a Citizenship Acceptance Form. From where do you hail?" she asks.

Davron pauses... then decides to play along. "I hail from the Sea-City in Alacian," he says, recalling Chi-Yosh's recent expedition to the West. "While I'm working on my own form, can you provide three more copies? Three of my companions are moving here later this week, and they will need the proper paperwork as well."

"Ah yes, that will do," says the Guide. She apparently knows the world well enough. "So a western immigration. All that salty air must have become rather corrosive, I imagine," says the Guide. A strange noise comes from her, which Davron might guess is a laugh. The automaton opens the desk. Or tries to. She frowns in thought, and the desk screeches horribly as she forces a drawer open. It's clear that whatever great talent went into the building itself, it was not extended to everything here. When the drawer is finally forced open, the Guide frowns. She reaches in and draws out a hand of ruined paper.

"These forms are inadequate. It seems that maintenance and stocking are both rather lax. I must apologize, citizen. I cannot process the paperwork. I will have to give you a guest's badge while I investigate the issues with supply." She at least seems to have those. The badge is made of brass, and nearly glows with polish as the guide offers it to Davron. "Please state your name and accept the badge, citizen."

Davron nods politely and states, "Davron," as he takes the badge. "Shall my companions need to apply for guest badges when they arrive?" he asks. If so, Chi-Yosh should probably come and get his before the hunt with Raksi, lest the Guide innocently give away Davron's little trick too soon.

The Guide considers for a moment. "It would be best if they did. By then your citizenship paperwork may be handled, as well. I will go see to it personally. You may give that badge to your friends when they arrive. Just be sure they are processed beforehand. Any special permissions will have to be applied for through the Securities Building, of course. Any of the guards will guide you when you bear that badge."

Davron nods. "I understand," he says. "Thank you." The Guide must clearly be specialized for its purpose, and is not likely to have much imagination outside its narrow duties, or else it would have been driven from the city a millenium ago. "I hope I will enjoy living here." That much, at least, is true - it just isn't true _yet_.

"You will be most welcome, Davron of Alacian," says the Guide. "Welcome to Denandsor. Remember, we exist to help make our citizens feel safe and at home. If you have need of assitance, make use of the guardians. They exist to protect the citizens of our fair city."

Davron bows. "Again, thank you," he says, as he takes his leave again. It's been a long day, dodging and dealing with the city's automata and puzzling over ancient defense mechanisms without a manual. And the Hearthstone on his breast is growing warm to the touch - best not to test its limits any further. And so he hurries along the silent streets of Denandsor in as direct a line as he may manage, thankful that he may now pass the giant guardians in peace.

As he jogs along, Davron contemplates that of all the stories to escape from Denandsor, his may be one of the strangest yet. Perhaps it was because he entered the city without simple looting in mind. And yet, his story is but a prologue to the much longer story of Denandsor that will come, as he and his Circle strive to gain the knowledge that will some day re-fill the Empty City.

The City Nexus of Sperimin was long ago conquered by vines and the wild growth of the jungle that now surrounds the city. Even the name of the city has been overthrown, and a new one - Mahalanka - been put in its place. And on the throne of skulls at the center of the City Nexus, another conquerer sits. Raksi, Queen of Fangs, the barbarian ruler of the southern jungles, is surrounded by the trappings of life, death, and conquest. This is as she wishes.

Today she welcomes into her court a particularly ugly and ungainly man, for such are the messengers that her barbarian underlings now send. Once they thought to send their most attractive, in order to win favor with their mistress and god. When their chosen emissaries did not return, they learned wisdom. This homely and simple man brings a simple message: "The Solars of the Hundred Kingdoms are moving many forces into the east."

Raksi laughs at this. With the eyes of a hawk one of her spies brought her the tale of the assault on the Underworld, and the capture of two Abyssal Exalted - an unprecedented feat, and one sure to awake the wrath of the Dowager. With borrowed ears her spies reported also on the Dowager's wrath, and on the quest the Solars have engaged in since reappearing suddenly after a month's absence.

Rising from her throne, she strides through the ruins of Mahalanka, through corridors and secret ways unknown to any but her. And in a deep room beneat the palace that once received ambassadors from all five poles, she attends to three books upon pedestals.

She speaks for a time, telling the Books of what she has heard, and finishes with a question. "Book of the Stars, tell me what these Sun-children plan." An ancient voice resonates through the room, one unheard by any ears but hers in millennia. "Proposal to overthrow the Dowager of the Irreverant Vulgate in Unrent Veils, 80%. Proposal to regain the Book of Three Circles, 79%."

Again Raksi laughs, with her beautiful and melodic voice. "Let them come," she whispers. "This will be delicious sport."
