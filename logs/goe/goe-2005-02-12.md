# Gods of Eden 2005-02-12

Through the works of Yu-Shan does Davron pass, and through a great and magnificent gallery of inventions housed in the Bureau of Humanity. Hither and yon he beholds assemblies of the spirits of this place, and even once or twice an emissary of the elementals of faraway Creation. He catches some rumor of their heated meetings and their hot exchanges as they debate the ownership of some of the wonders that have swept the land in recent decades: the clock which tells its own time rather than relying on the sun and moon, the rifle which slays with fire, earth and wood together, and the steam engine, that bastard product of every element together. And presently he discovers the Doorway of Endless Devising.

Past the enchanted doorway, and beyond it, where there is naught but darkness and cold, and for a time his thoughts return to the Endless Desert and the nothingness he almost glimpsed at the end of that journey. For a time, he even fears a fall into that ultimate void. But there is a rushing sensation, and a light makes itself known to his eyes. He falls.

A moment's disorientation sweeps over him, and Davron rises unsteadily. Around him he can hear something like music. There's a beat, and a steadily evolving syncopation of sounds. After a moment recognition dawns: this is the sound of gears and machinery at work. There is little light, but he discerns that he's in some sort of factory where machines are used. Or, perhaps, he is within a great machine himself. Ahead, he sees a light, and the archway of a door.

Davron walks toward the door, gazing in fascination at the indistinct shadows of whirling gears and thrumming belts. Had you shown him a picture of this when he was in Creation, he would have told you it looked like home; now that he is inside, though, the lack of organic life is slightly unsettling. Too, the memories of the "Clockwork King" he could become weigh on him. Nevertheless, what he seeks right now lies beyond the doorway he now passes through.

Several figures are clustered around a flowing, glowing dance of lights in the center of the chamber. Each of their faces is lit in the bright, saturated colors emanating from the image; a panoply of races in a gamut of colors. Some faces are old, some are young, some male, some female. Each murmurs to the others in a different voice, gesturing at features of the nebulous mass; tracing paths between the glowing nodes with fingers, eyeglasses, and exotic instruments of metal and crystal.

One of the figures looks up as Davron approaches. He is an older man; what hair he has left is thick and frizzy. He wears a set of spectacles with thick, dark frames and a woolen suit with a long, skewed cravat of an odd print. "Ah. So you've come, then. Come here, lad. You will find this of interest."

Davron has almost ceased to be surprised at the way he always seems to be expected when he arrives unannounced. Nodding, he joins the old man in his observations.

The older man leads Davron forward to the glowing mass of lights. Davron's eyes are drawn into the endless shifting patterns of the diagram; if this were the map of a city, it would be a city of billions. Or perhaps all the creeks, streams, rivers, and ocean currents of the world, or all the blood vessels in the body of an ocean leviathan, or a plan of the workings of a vast machine... except that this map is moving like a living thing. Davron swears that any part he concentrates on is steady as stone, but as his eyes move along each branch and tributary, he can realizes that no particular section looks the same way twice.

Davron has seen a pale shadow of this complexity before, when he gazed at the map of his own soul in Lytek's office on parchment paper. Now he recognizes the living truth from which that mere document was inadequately transcribed.

"Isn't it remarkable," the old man continutes. "When we observe the pattern at a coarse scale, it appears static and orderly, but in the details, at a precise scale, there are these odd projections. Even for very complicated devices, a simple set of rules can be sufficient to reconstruct the whole, even from chaotic material."

"If the rules interact with one another, yes," Davron says distantly, as he gazes at the construction. Is this a representation of his own Spark, or is it someone else's - or is it the model, the prototype from which Autochthon crafted them all? "And there are specific machines you couldn't build that way - but I suspect that it would suffice to build a machine to suit any _purpose_ you'd care to name."

Another of the massed figures steps back from examining the diagram, folding a flanged instrument of metal and glass as he does. He wears colorful silks with imprinted with complex designs and long, baggy sleeves. His long grey hair and wispy beard hangs almost to his waist. "Purpose implies predictability. The soul, composed of so many pieces, can find its own order even when perturbed - but that order is not always apparent beforehand."

The next speaker is a feminine figure whose body appears to be made of onyx, lit by traces of liquid light, similar to the soul-map itself. The fine skin of her face and long, red hair appear human enough, though here eyes are glowing blue orbs. "Predictability need not be the only goal. Some things may be inevitable, but is not the response of the device also of significance? Without the chaotic source, there would be no order."

Davron nods. "Indeed... a device this complex would surely serve multiple purposes. And what of the user who finds that it serves a purpose he does not intend, indeed a purpose that runs counter to his intentions?" If his presence here was expected, then his aims are surely also known. He will not disturb the lesson - for such it surely is - by impertinent, direct demands to 'get to the point', but he is willing to ask questions as a student would, and how his instructors choose to answer it is up to them.

Yet another speaker steps away from the soul-map. He is a middle-aged man of medium height, with a wiry build, dressed in an austere suit of some odd matte grey material that exposes little of his brownish skin. His long, straight, sandy blonde hair held in check by a tight band silk similar to his clothes, imprinted with an interlocking pattern of gears. His face is unremarkable, save that it looks a bit drawn, and ends in long, narrow chin that is dusted with a short and well-kept beard. "Should you not also ask of the creator? The consequences for the craftsman who builds a thing run amok?" He grins, exposing too-perfect, pearly teeth, a gesture that carries all the menace of a snarling tiger.

"Surely the consequences for the craftsman are worse than for the poor user of the device," he continues. "What is the penalty for complicating the world with such chaos, such imperfection? Such a thing as this, there would be no order, no predictability - no means to measure and dispence justice!"

Davron gives a slight, but respectful, bow to the newcomer. "I am here to ask that very question, sir." A suspicion is forming in his mind, which he does not express yet. "I know too well what ill may come from thoughtless tinkering with a device beyond one's comprehension - the Second Age of Man is littered with the smoking debris of such examples." His eyes narrow, as the man continues - those words are too close to his heart. "However, justice without mercy treats every man as no more than a means to an end - destroying imperfection for the sin of being imperfect. And though a thousand touches of chaos may be nothing but harm to order, there may be one which improves the whole - if it is recognized and built on, rather than discarded."

The old man in the wool suit puts his arm around Davron, and leads him back to the glowing soul-map. "You see part of it, then. But do you see how to select the one touch of chaos that will bring higher order from the thousands that will only bring ruin? To change the pattern, you must also change the rules that bring the order to the chaos. But the rules affect the whole system, and the consequences may be very subtle."

The austere man comments, "Perhaps it is better to not invite disaster, then, to disturb the careful craft of fate. What benefit can be worth the risk of final ruin?"

Davron opens his mouth to speak... then hesitates, gazing at the diagram, trying to see the underlying principles of order - the whole still seems chaotic to his gaze, and he _knows_ that this is because he has not grasped the patterns yet. At length, though, he speaks nevertheless. "What if I believe with all my heart that the machine, as it stands, will bring ruin to all around it? It, and machines like it, have nearly been the ruin of everything once before already, and that was prevented only by halting their action. And I can see that this one _will_ run amok again, if nothing is done."

Davron sighs. "And if the Artificer cannot or will not help me to reshape it to prevent that end, then sooner or later..." He draws a finger across his own neck. "It will need to be deactivated again. And we will have to hope that the error will not recur a third time."

The old man withdraws his arm from around Davron's shoulder, and warmly harrumphs. "Move not too hastily, lad. There is no need to consider extreme measures this day. But you do remind me of a most curious paradox." The austere man continues, "The paradox is that I am both machine, and maker of machines." The glowing woman follows, "May I, then, also make myself?" And finally the bearded man in silk finishes, "And if I make myself, then how may I know who I am?" There is a long, pregnant pause, filled with a murmuring as from hundreds of voices beyond the edge of the lit area, just out of sight. Then, as one, all of the assembled exotic beings turn and look directly at Davron. With a hint of a sneer, the austere man asks, "And what is your opinion, my guest? For this is the root of the question."

Davron nods to himself, as he attains a glimpse of understanding of who he is speaking to. But that is less important, for now, than the question he is posed. He pauses in thought, before the assembled multitude, and then answers as if to himself at first: "A machine _is_ its purpose. A mere rock is not the same as another rock - but though every part of a machine be replaced, it is still the same machine, if the replacement parts are of exactly the same shape and design as the original."

Davron turns then to address the Clockwork King. "But if the machine is altered, so that its purpose is changed - then no, it is not the same machine. I know this, and I fear it. I am a machine and maker of machines - and a maker of war, and a maker of peace, and many other things besides. How then will I know myself, you ask, if I alter my own purpose? I answer that not all purposes are equal. The lesser functions serve the higher - and I know myself, most of all, by the purpose I deem the most important."

Davron addresses the old man. "I see myself, first and foremost, as a protector - a protector of life and hope. As a creator second - to create that which protects. And a destroyer last of all - a destroyer of that which would destroy what I hold dear." He smiles wryly at the woman of light. "It is ironic, then, that this third purpose is directed inward - and I do risk impairing that purpose, if it is directed against itself. And I risk that the higher purposes will be impaired, if the lesser is weakened. But I will take that risk, if I may. For that is better, in my view, than if the lesser purpose were to override the greater."

The strange people that Davron speaks to, do not speak or move for several moments. Then, one by one, they identify themselves. The old man in wool says, "I am Autocthon, the Mathemetician." The glowing woman follows, "I am Autocthon, the Mother. Then the bearded man, "I am Autochton, the Astrologer"; and the austere man, "I am Autocthon, the Clockwork King." Whispers of lesser voices from throats in the area beyond sight reach Davron's ears. The Mathemetician speaks again: "You are Davron, little cog. You have come far to learn of changing the parts for the good of the whole. I will instruct you."

Davron takes a deep breath, only now realizing that he had been holding it, realizing how tense he had been. He bows to all, as best he can. "I thank you... Autochthon," he says, addressing the whole as it truly is - one whole, many parts.

Fissures of light creak through Davron's skin until his Anima crawls into the room. Atop his brow, the Cast Mark gleams, then becomes a star of intensity. A fluttering stirs in Davron's chest, like a bird trying to escape its cage. The purples and soft oranges of the light fade as the Mark's illumination joins the blaze, merging with the Anima itself like some brilliant ghost, and out pours the star, drifting out of the Twilight's personal flame and into the room itself - a pulsing, radiant sun that emanates more than just heat, but emotion and power alike where ever its rays touch.

"This," says the Mathematician calmly, "is your spark. This is what unites with your soul and gives you the power of your patron god. And now.."

"Let us see if you can convince it of your plan as you have convinced me."

While the Spark has no features, Davron can feel it linked to him, beating like a phantom heart. After a moment of silence, the voice that follows flows not to the ears, but seeps in through the skin where ever its magnificent light bathes. _You, a facet of I, wish to alter that which is part of He, made by They. Do you hold greater wisdom then They, understand the power and tie to He, and know the truth of I?_

Davron speaks aloud to his divine self. "They have enough wisdom for all of Creation, and I do not claim to match that - but I do claim enough to direct the reshaping of You." A pause. "And though I do not yet know the details of the connection with Him, I do know Him well enough that I do not fear he will frown on what I propose to do - and the rest is a matter of artifice, on which They can advise me."

One more pause, and Davron continues. "As for You - I know the truth of part of You, for he haunts my dreams. Though he is wise and knowledgeable in the ways of devising, he revels in cruelty, he enjoys destruction, and he does not hear the pleas of his victims. You were a ruler for millenia, before the end, and not all of You were of this sort. Am I wrong? Then show me!"

_A piece of the whole must understand the place of the whole. A change you make will not only affect you, but those that may come after you. You wish to purify the heart and soul deeper than you. Then understand all that I have inhabited._ For a moment the star dims, before its light is a bitter harshness, drowning Davron in the light, before inside of it, a picture begins to form, fading into reality.

It is not Davron that appears, exactly. It is a man, bedecked in the finery of the latter First Age, linen gown with intricate and arcane designs in orichalcum thread, and his skin is a pale white, and his features are different. But to look into his eyes, for Davron, is like looking in a mirror. The man smiles unpleasantly. "So it is you who thinks yourself great enough to destroy me?" He laughs mockingly. "You, who cries bitter tears at slaying a demon, just because it wears the face of a loved one?"

The man draws himself up to his full height and looks down his nose at Davron. "Know that I am Arandor the Ingenious! I slew armies of the Fair Folk with naught but the work of my hands and my soul, and demons as great as your Nomolous bowed to my will. I ruled over orichalcum and steel for many centuries, and it took the foul treachery of all the Sidereals and their Dragon-Blooded puppets to bring me down. And a sniveling whelp like you thinks he can cut me off from my Solar heritage?"

For a moment, Arandor grows still, before fading away. As though viewed distantly through thick glass, Davron watches the procession of the barers of the Spark. The first Incarnation of the line, each facet that makes him what he is passes by, from rise to ultimate fall. It continues, the next holder's life an equal show - each time a trend of the lives that have held their divine heart, the fatal mistakes, and the things that make them whole. The viewing ends with Arandor's prideful, destructive fall.

It all fades away, dieing away until the light is finally gone, and blinking it away, Davron is once more within the chamber of clanking gears, in audience with those many wondrous figures. _Know what I, you are, and that which makes us we, and Arandor he._

Davron nods, slightly shaken - even in his dreams the voice of Arandor was never so clear as now - and yet firmer in resolve, at the vision of the entirety of his Spark's history, muted though it may be. "I understand You better now - and I am all the more certain of what I will do."

"You will struggle with that soul again very soon," says Autochthon the Mathematician. "In a workshop yonder you will find tools and components. Here you behold the map of the spark. If you wish to test your fate, I see no better time than now to start. I will provide you a selection of soul-vessels of Essence, for storage. Despite your ability to see them, they will still be linked to you - do not casually destroy them unless the consequences of doing so seem desirable to you."

Davron passes into the next chamber - and witnesses a selection of devices beyond his wildest dreams. Even without personal memories of them, he _knows_ that the finest Twilight factory-cathedrals in the First Age were only a shadow of this. Literally, perhaps. For if Autochthon is the very definition of Artificer, then this room is the ideal, the distilled essence of Occult Workship.

Wrenches and screwdrivers and hammers made of pure colored light - and they look positively mundane next to the set made out of nothing, only visible by the play of light along their nonexistent edges and the more mundane grips that allow a hand to manipulate them. Arrays of tubing of all manner of materials, both Magical and mundane, in spirals and knots that defy mere three-dimensionional shape - Davron is certain that some of them actually turn inside out along their course. Gears that look as if they could never mesh with one another, but turn with mathematical precision when assembled, so that one steadily turning shaft could drive another in all sorts of rotations - even backwards, if need be.

No mortal could even comprehend most of the implements here - and Davron finds himself learning new principles of the occult just observing them. And Davron will need every principle he can learn. Once he overcomes the awe, he sets to work, attaching pieces to one another with glues of unimaginable potency, welding joins with pure Fire Essence, occasionally stymied when the logic of a gearworks requires two shafts to pass through one another, until he remembers that he has the option of welding a chunk of nothingness into the middle of one shaft.

Every so often, he returns to the map of the Spark, writing sketches of what he sees with paper and ink of no material he can identify, and taking separate notes as he imbues the paper with Essence, that the sketches move of their own accord. As he gains the knowledge to do so, he asks questions of Autochthon's many incarnations, clarifying principles of mathematics or reality engineering or other more obscure concepts as he needs them.

The working is finally complete, and stands on the center of the Workshop's floor. At its center is something partly like a throne and partly like a warstrider harness, with straps and gauntlets and boots designed to be attached to a wearer - Davron, in this case. The whole is attached by threads and belts to an eye-defying assemblage of gearing above, and then to the gnomic bulk of a larger Machine.

Covering panels are a luxury which Davron felt little need to add, and so an observer can see into the latticed framework to Essence conduits attached to camshafts attached to valves that will shunt bubbling colored liquids through reservoirs and boiling chambers and manifolds which drive even more shafts - all of it leading to one insulated tube that runs back up through the Machine and down to a helmet that would cover the top of Davron's head. A glittering orichalcum medallion is clearly designed to be clamped over the top of Davron's caste mark, just above a wraparound visor with eyepieces of crystalline ruby.

Davron takes a deep breath. "If this doesn't work," he says to the Mathematician, "there won't be enough left of me to send back in a box. Unless you were to make one especially for the occasion," he adds, grinning. And with that, he climbs up into the seat, and begins buckling himself in, his glowing anima attuning to the orichalcum - and with a whir and a rumble, the Machine begins to come to life. At last, he says, "Here goes nothing" - and with that, he lowers the visor, a _click_ accompanying the sound as the motion lowers one tiny gear into its proper place.

In broad, the technical details of the machine are correct. In fine, Davron realizes with a sick feeling in his gut that he has tremendously underestimated the complexity of the task. The feeling of exhilaration that sustained him earlier collapses in a heartbeat, and he feels himself plunging into an abyss of darkness. And in the background he hears a hideous laughter beating at his mind like a drum.

He feels his memories washing away. Desperately he clings to the vision of Willow that he had, only to experience a sickening distortion, after which he no longer realizes what he lost. The others of his Circle appear before him, then disappear, and slowly he feels their presence gone. And soon after he forgets that he might have ever known such people. Rumika, with her enigmatic smile, washes herself out of his history like a ghost.

His father is left, the man whose paternal care became sadistic cruelty in another possible life. His family, the people around him, disappear one by one. Who is he? What does he care about? These things, too, begin to slide away. And in the void that the missing memories create, other things start to appear.

Davron gapes in outrage and frustration at first, as his life slides away, and then is left bewildered and alone and wondering what horrified him so. "Hello?" he calls into the darkness, his voice uncertain - for what, indeed, has he to be certain of?

What answers Davron is a bitter silence. Silence nearly as empty as the depths of Oblivion. When a sound finally comes, it is hard to perceive. Finally, it resolves itself in a laughing voice. The voice of Arandor. The image of Davron's former self resolves itself in the darkness, as well, glittering with bitter brightness. "You fool!" taunts the Ingenius. "You wish to kill me? And you dare claim the position of protector? Hah! Hypocrite! You fear me, you know you can never match me, and so you would do.. this. And now you will lose all you once treasured."

Davron reaches to his side, but there is nothing there. Something he had to do, something that would strengthen him here in this place... but he has forgotten. One thing he has not forgotten, though - that mocking, cruel voice must be silenced, prevented from doing what it wishes. "Whatever I have lost..." he says, uncertainly at first, "I have lost to protect it from _you_, and the likes of you." His voice strengthens. "And here, there is just you and me. If I can stop you, here and now, then no matter how much I have lost, I have still succeeded!" And with that, he launches himself at the gleaming figure.

The struggle Davron launches himself into is not one of body. It is not one of essence. This is a war of focused will, and Arandor, for all his other failings, is far from easy to defeat in such a contest. Davron's rushed assault is met by something. It is nothing to be seen, nor even felt in the normal sense. It is merely a dim understanding that he is being attacked, his soul and will being grasped by another and flexed swiftly close to the breaking point while his own attempts to destroy his adversary are thwarted -- for the moment.

Davron grits his teeth - or rather, would do so if this were a bodily struggle - but here, it is an immaterial sense of tension, as he struggles against the attack that has turned against him. "You..." The word 'Anathema' escapes his mind, but the concept remains - a perversion of all that is good and holy, and Davron knows that Arandor can 'hear' that thought. "There... _must_ be some way to stop you... I did not come here... just to be defeated..."

Arandor shakes his head, letting out a sigh. "You are a child. Did you really think that you could simply do this without facing me? Do you think I'll step aside so some whelp can erase me?" The tension against Davron's spirit grows more intense yet, stretching and straining. Still, there is a sense of.. something. A feeling of location suddenly, like one learning for the first time how to control a muscle and what that area 'feels' like. With that, Davron's struggles suddenly find expression, and Arandor staggers, but he quickly gathers himself for yet another attack.

Davron takes advantage of the breather to recover what wits he has left. "Step aside? Fool I may be, but not that kind of fool... wait. Erase you? Did I really wish to erase you?" He shakes his head. "No, that can't be right. I only wanted you not to destroy me, and everything I cared about." He looks at Arandor. "Do you know what that's like? Have you never lost anything you cared about, beyond your own life?" And with that, Davron goes forward again... this time not trying to crush Arandor's will, but to understand it - to learn what drives Arandor, why he sought to take Davron over. It is no less an attack, but it is a different one.

An attack that catches Arandor off-guard. His iron will, all his power, all his certainty of the only way someone could possibly defeat him leaves him utterly unprepared. The will is not broken, the spirit is not seared. Instead of the hate he was so eager to deal in, he is met by weapons that have ended many conflicts in their own right--compassion and empathy. Davron can feel something, like a bar that is utterly resistant to breaking. Yet his will can feel it soften slightly with each moment. There is a weakening there, even as Arandor focuses on attacking Davron with all his strength.

And at the center of that will, and that pride, and that power, Davron feels a memory - one he recognizes somehow as his own, and one that his rival incorporated greedily and selfishly. It is a simple statement, made by the ghost in a garden in some faraway place. "'It has never been done'," she says, in response to some question.

Arandor senses Davron's hesitation and distraction, and seeks to build upon it. "You see things, do you? Perhaps that pathetic little band of friends you call a circle, with the weed-picker, the idle clown who would be sorceror, and some witch that thinks she holds a crown." He snorts derisively, "All fools, and you are the greatest of all. You think you can build wonders! Hah! Perhaps the dancing trollop.. or your cousin is who you wish to impress? Well, soon I shall have it all, and they will all cower before me!" The Ingenius attacks again, this time even more wrecklessly, lashes out with all his power, battering and crushing against Davron's will like some titanic beast.

Davron seems puzzled by the one memory that he reclaimed on his own, even as he flinches as the other's hostile will batters him with memories of Arandor's choosing. Why _this_ memory, of an entire lifetime? Then he realizes. Turning on Arandor, he says, "You think I _can't_ build wonders? You would not _be_ here, in this position, if it weren't for a wonder I built! Oh, I'm sure you created an awesome trinket or two in _your_ life... and yet you never _dared_ to look within, to reshape your own spirit. Did it simply not occur to you to try? Or did you imagine it, and shy away, thinking you couldn't handle the challenge?"

That simply enrages the Ingenius. His attacks simultaneously gain power and lose finesse as he is reduced to a raving madman. The full insanity of the Fallen Solar is revealed to Davron in this moment, the face of Arandor reduced to a snarling rictus, his eyes wide, glaring, unseeing. The words he would say come out as gutteral sounds, as hideous as the man himself has become.

As Arandor's self-control slips, so does his hold on the memories he's stolen, and the young Solar staggers with realization and recollection. There are gaps - some knowledge was strained and bent in the struggle - but in the main, he is Davron once more. And... being Davron, he is struck with pity for the man that once held his Spark, even as he avoids and deflects Arandor's incoherent thrashing. "I did _not_ intend to erase you," he says, with certain knowledge now.

But that seems to do little good. At least little in stopping the attacks. They grow less focused. And then Davron can sense something. He feels something slip into him now. Something that he knows is not his. It is the memory of the Ingenius, lolling about on a tree limb with a woman of striking beauty and pale hair, and he knows her as a Lunar. A Lunar who once loved Arandor. There is no rage or hate in that memory he draws to himself, just warmth and joy. And a thought: I was happy then. And the whole while the Ingenius grows more full of rage, more hateful still.

"Fear not, Arandor - I will not steal from you in turn," says Davron, releasing his hold on that memory of happiness. A giant dreamcatcher materializes in the darkness - a threaded web of intricate and orderly pattern, constrained in a man-sized circle of orichalcum - and yet, just a metaphor for the function Davron designed into his Machine, a net to capture a chunk of Essence and preserve it whole. "But I can't leave you here like this. Come out, Arandor," he says, gesturing to the hoop - not certain whether Arandor's heart can be reached, but he must try. "You will not die, or forget, unless you choose to do so. And you will be able to use your talents once more, and learn of yourself even as you help to build new things..."

The hatred of Arandor grows only stronger, and when Davron tries to restore the memory, it is repelled as if struck by a hammer. More join it. A child, a soft song sung while looking over a river. The smile of a father at his son's first attempt at making an arrow. "I was so happy then. What is becoming of me?" echoes Arandor's voice softly through Davron's mind. The attacks continue, and with each memory the countenance of Davron's foe grows ever more bestial, the caste mark upon his brow distorting into a grimacing face with wrathful eyes.

Davron begins to understand at last - the hatred that burns in Arandor is rejecting everything that Arandor took pleasure in. He addresses the voice in his mind now, rather than the hateful visage of Arandor's embodiment. "I will save what I can, Arandor," he whispers. He puts one hand into the dreamcatcher's web, and braces himself against its pull - and every pleasant memory that Arandor throws at Davron, Davron in turn allows it to pass through him into the waiting Essence-container.

The more Davron draws away from the hate, the more swiftly it flows. More and more is taken, bits and pieces. One likely nearly knocks the Solar utterly off-kilter. A vision of the Ingenius kneeling and saying simply, "If it be your will, then yes," and a brilliant light is suddenly shining from the brow of Arandor. The attacks grow steadily more violent and simultaneously less effective, as what is done creates an ever growing distance between Davron and the taint More and more the taint lashes out, and with each strike it shifts farther away from anything Davron can recall. Farther still, until he begins to sense something familiar. A whisper of something in his mind, like the scent of a familiar filth drifting off a rotting corpse.

"What _are_ you?" Davron says to the no-longer-human monstrosity that confronts him, even as the last of Arandor slips away. "Does something like you dwell in every man?" The dreamcatcher vanishes as Davron pulls his hand away - this _thing_ cannot be allowed to follow the memories it once held in its cruel grip. "And more importantly - what do I do with you now?" Davron puts forth his will, pinioning the hateful creature.

The creature has no answer. It is, and that is all. Davron is essentially asking water why it is wet. The answer is more rage, mindless and pure. Now the distance between Davron and the thing have grown to the point where he barely need even heed it, but it does not stop. It seems to be untiring, purified wrath and hate for everything. Davron can sense it even now turning in on itself, shredding its existance in futile wrath.

Davron shakes his head. "Even something like this should not be destroyed without understanding it first," he says, remembering that even the gods did not destroy the Primordials after their victory. A gesture of will summons another dreamcatcher - this one's strands gleam red, presumably an aid to Davron to distinguish one from another. "In you go," he says, directing his will to force the taint into a separate Essence bottle.

With a final howl of rage, the thing spirals into the web and is sucked in. The second dreamcatcher vanishes, leaving Davron alone in the dark, his mind still spinning from the enormity of what has just happened. He does not fully understand what has just happened here - but he knows he has done what he set out to do. And the password, the mental cue for the Machine to deactivate and return him to himself, seems all the more appropriate: "Ye shall be as gods... but ye must remember that ye are still men."

Davron comes out of his Machine-driven trance with blood seeping out of his mouth. He raises a hand to his brow and finds blood there as well. "You are dying," comments one of the Autochthon-surrogates. "Your spark is damaged, and your body is deteriorating. But it is not too late."

"It seems your work on the machine wasn't complete. You have weeks to finish it before the damage slays you. Perhaps days. You will need help. May I suggest building some?"

Davron nods. "And I know just the man to help," he says, unstrapping the restraints and stumbling with a weakness he was not prepared for, walking with unsteady legs to the side of the machine, where he brushes his fingers against the first Essence bottle. "I had not planned to awaken you this soon, Arandor," he murmurs, coughing, "but it seems I need you once more..."

The question of powering Davron's idea is answered after a few minutes of inquiry; Autochthon's workshop itself has more than adequate supplies of Essence for driving such things, as was expected. If the Solar wishes to make use of such innovations elsewhere in existence, he will need to address this issue himself.

With the immediate question answered, Davron begins to implement his new idea. The construction, or rather the constructions, that he now seeks to make are at once simpler and far more complex than the soul-machine he had already built.

What he is building is not one automaton, but many - an assemblage of small machines, each no more than six inches high, but all of them posssessing both the implements and the knowledge of occult craftsmanship.

Each one is unique in its way. One is a spheroid resembling an overgrown timepiece, but with hand-like and foot-like manipulators that extrude from its surface. Another resembles some sort of drill with legs, and another is basically a clockwork spider - for such creatures are inescapably associated with artifice, and the practical value of eight assemblages and a multitude of tiny mouth-parts is undeniable.

As Davron finishes, blinking blood from his eyes, he puts all the little automata together on a single platform, which is connected by a soul-linkage to Arandor's Essence-bottle. Davron inserts the borrowed power-sources into each one, and then throws the switch. "Live again, Arandor," he murmurs, "and build again."

As Arandor's Essence is poured into the clockwork savants, their gears begin to whir... and shutters open, revealing crystalline eyes. The creations awake, climb to their various feet or foot-equivalents, and turn to Davron, awaiting their orders.

Davron's elation is cut off by a racking cough that reminds him of how little time he has left, and with a word, the automata follow him to the soul-machine and begin the repairs and enhancements. Davron finds that in his weakened state, it's not as easy for him to even keep his hands steady, but the little machines step in where he cannot, and prove their worth over and over - crawling into spaces Davron cannot reach, and even showing some initiative, pointing out little misdesigns that Davron had missed before.

Finally, all is done, and Davron nods to the clockwork creations. "Wish me luck..." he says to them, then crawls back into the machine. This time, he is too weak to tighten all the straps, requiring the automata to provide one last bit assistance. "Thanks again," he says, smiling at them, and switches it on.

It is Chi-Yosh who receives notification from a minor spirit that it has brought back one of his companions, who recently exited the Bureau of Heaven and collapsed. The Celestial Bureaucracy saw to every necessary detail - that is, they made sure he wasn't dead out of their own actions, then deposited him at the doorstep. Traveling via airship to the spirit's sanctum in the Myan Forest, Chi-Yosh enters the dwelling of the little god and is surprised by the sight awaiting him.

Davron is laying in a bed, and being serviced by... something. Or some things. Tiny mechanical creatures are brewing coffee and preparing food, while others are attending to bandaging and similar medical care. The Solar's eyes flutter open.

"I... I know you. You're a friend..." murmurs Davron, smiling weakly. He looks not so much like the victim of a fight as much as some wasting disease - but it's clear that he's on the mend. His brow furrows. "Chi... Chi-Yosh?"

Chi-Yosh is at Davron's bedside, looking him over. It's no contagion that he's ever seen before, nothing with obvious symptoms. Though, that slow recognition makes the Dawn nervous. No sign of head trauma. No sunken eyes, suggesting The Wasting Grave. Finally, he settles on Davron's bedside, and smiles reassuringly. "Yes. Chi-Yosh. Part of your Circle. Do you know who you are?"

Davron grins broadly at this. "Like I never did before," he says. "I am Davron, protector and craftsman. And the dreams are gone." He coughs harshly. "I'll be okay, Chi-Yosh. These things happen when you use yourself as a test subject..." His eyes flutter half-closed. "Take me home, please. And don't forget the automata..."
