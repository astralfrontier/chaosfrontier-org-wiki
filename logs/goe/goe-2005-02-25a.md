# Gods of Eden 2005-02-25a

The Solar Circle stands in Raksi's court. The Queen of Fangs herself sits upon a throne of bleached skulls, smiling serenely. The setting is a vast room once found in the city of Sperimin, but that ancient metropolis is no more. Its name is Mahalanka now, and the woman thought of as a jungle demon-god dispenses her mad brand of justice from it.

"An interesting chase," Raksi purrs, smiling down at the four Solars. "Yes.. very enjoyable." She licks her lips softly, regarding Chi-Yosh with a sultry, smokey expression. "I must still catch you, rabbit."

Tall, proud and polished after the taxing hunt, the Su'Katan stands triumphant. Even if from the pot he dives into the fire, he isn't shaken to find himself once more under the gaze of the hungry Queen. "And I must still evade you," delivers Chi-Yosh with as much smirk as brass as he has earned.

"Of course. And in due time... but for now," speaks Ramar, his voice steeled with resolve as the end of the great quest is now in sight... very nearly within grasp, "There is the matter of the Book of Books. According to the challenge issued by Chi-Yosh, it has been earned... we are here to see to it that all of the recent trouble is not in vain."

Gallius stands by silently, doing all she can to hold back her disgust at Raksi. Even being within sight of her makes the Zenith's skin crawl. The only comfort she finds is that someday Raksi's hated head will adorn the tip of a pike. That day couldn't come soon enough.

"Then I suppose you have earned it," purrs Raksi, smiling with half-lidded eyes at Ramar. "You should go find it then. You have my leave to scour the city for it. And of course if you require assistance..." She flashes a smile, and the Solars behold fangs.

Davron stands silently by Chi-Yosh's side as Raksi, excitement over the nearness of the Book contained only by respect for she which sits upon the throne. No, not respect, exactly - just healthy dread, as of a deadly force of nature. Here sits a being who, he has no doubt, could have sliced him out of the _Pride_ and dismembered him all by herself. And he and the rest of the Circle will surely shun her 'assistance' as long as possible - which, he knows, will not be forever.

Chi-Yosh steps from the lair of the beast, shrugging off the mantle of bravado. Evading one of the top hunters in Creation has filled the Dawn to the brim with confidence, but that is a show for Raksi. Weakness from too much brass is a better feint than weakness from hesitation. Better to flirt than flinch. Even so, he respects the Queen of Fangs - as an opponent, and a Lunar. She Is the epitome of Lunar existance, it is something to understand, that the Solars may reach and save their Lunar brethren from such fate. Now, there is little use for his swelled head, and the Solar is one with his Circle again, whole and moving forward.

The Solars bow, and take their leave of the throne room with alacrity. Just outside, Davron pulls a sheaf of now-familiar papers from a scroll case, and intones the syllables of sorcery. The bird of blue flame shimmers into existence, its Essence entwining with the transcription from the Book, and begins to lead the Circle through the halls of the edifice of former Sperimin that is Raksi's lair.

It is without much surprise that Davron discovers the path to the Book is no longer obstructed, and yet he must tread carefully. Even the fringes of the innermost barriers of sorcery that ring the city interfere with the seeking magic, and he cannot easily afford to invoke it repeatedly. Instead he concentrates on getting a sense of general location, and advising the Circle.

Through the shattered ruins and feral majesty of Mahalanka the Solars tread, and all about them they can see red eyes agleam in the shadows or hear muted whuffles and snorts from the half-men and less-than-men who inhabit this place. More than once they are called upon to strike down a crazed cannibal or ape-thing.

In time Ramar's keen senses detect the entrance to an underground passageway that seems to lead in the direction the Book ought to be - yards below the throne room of Raksi herself. Through the darkness the Solars plunge, lighting the claustrophobic tunnel with their Caste Marks and their confidence.

And finally they emerge into a secret study, a haven for Raksi and her sorcerous pursuits. Whatever dark knowledge she has earned in the intervening years is only hinted at by the exotic wonders that adorn this place. Many of the pieces kept on shelves or pedestals here would be priceless to the savants of the Heptagram. Davron and Ramar can only identify perhaps a tenth of the items as significant to spells whose rumors they've heard.

Raksi is waiting here, the same teasing, hungry smile on her face. "Welcome, my lady, and gentlemen," she croons. "Welcome and behold." For at the center of the study is a desk, and upon that desk are three objects alone. Three books, of considerable size, which the Solars recognize from their experience in the past of the Loom. The Book of the Sun, the Book of the Moon, and the Book of the Stars.

And what a sight such books are. Ramar is fascinated by them. They are at long last within sight. Tears well in his eyes, as the fruits of much labor are so close, and perhaps a moment's peace when at long last all is said and done. "Indeed... and so we have found what we seek. We thank you for your leave to scour the city."

Gallius ignores Raksi as best she can. That revolting blight would have to be here, as well. Her focus is on what so many have died for. What Raksi killed to keep useless and hidden in this black hole. The Book of Three Circles.

"I am Gallius Leom, Zenith Caste of the Unconquered Sun. On the authority the heavens have placed upon my shoulders I hereby restore the Solar Deliberative," she says firmly. "All who stand here are witnesses of this fact. I accept the burden of Heirophant, and I express the first order of the restored Deliberative. I officially countermand Order 927 of the Solar Deliberative. No more shall the Book of Three Circles remain in this forgotten place. It shall serve the Deliberative once more."

"I announce my membership in the Deliberative," says Raksi, loudly. "I assert my position as Guardian of the Book of Three Circles, as granted to me by Bagrash Kol, Solar."

"The Deliberative is instituted," replies a voice, powerful and mechanical. It is the Book of the Sun, with a tone of strength. "The Heirophant is acknowledged. The Guardian is acknowledged. Fourteen mandatory and thirty-seven optional positions remain unfilled."

"Order 972 is countermanded," the voice continues. "Restrictions on relocation of the Book of Three Circles are lifted."

Gallius figured Raksi would have some dirty trick up her sleeve. Still, if Raksi is playing for time, she's not a very wise student of recent history. The Sun is rising far faster than Luna. She directs her attention to the Book, "I wish to know which mandatory positions remain open so that I might find those who are worthy."

"Treasurer. Protector. Warlord. Magister. Sorcerer. Summoner. Celestial Envoy. Architect. Seer. Psychopomp. Historian. Librarian. Icon. Enigma," the Book replies.

Gallius regards the book carefully, "I wish to know who has the right to limit who claims each of the roles. It would not do if there was no control over these things. I also wish to know who has the right to select a new home for the Book of Three Circles."

"Currently the limit on essential roles is Celestial Exaltation," the Book answers. "Other limits were permanently rescinded in Subsection 9 of Order 927."

"The Guardian has final veto power over relocation of the Book."

All the while, Raksi smiles wickedly, watching the Solars, as though a mother admiring her children playing at a fascinating game.

"Then I will add limitations as new Order 1," says Gallius. "The Heirophant has sole authority of selecting who shall hold each of the mandatory positions and has veto power over all other positions in the Deliberative."

"The Consolidation of Power Act forbids such an action without unanimous consent," the Book of the Moon replies. "Cast your votes." And to this Raksi wastes no time in announcing, "Nay."

After hearing the Solars cast their votes quietly, Raksi smiles from face to face. "I had hoped you'd blunder in here and empower the Book for me again," she purrs. "I'm so very grateful to you. And now.. take it from me if you can!"

The tortured gleam of madness shines from Raksi's eyes as she studies the Solars anew, waiting for their next act with an unnatural eagerness.

Davron ponders this quietly, then addresses Yang mentally, _We do not know the rules of the Deliberative, but I doubt not that you do - or at least as they stood in your time. And Raksi certainly does. Is there any way to extricate the Book from the legal bind she now has it in?_

_Raksi must no longer be Guardian. Get her to transfer the role to someone else, or find a way to assign it to another without her consent,_ answers Yang.

Gallius has more questions. "What authority is required to remove a member of the Deliberative?" she asks. "And what authority is needed to add new positions to the Deliberative?"

"A member must violate the laws of the Deliberative to be eligible for expulsion or execution," replies the Book. "To create and validate new positions requires unanimous consent of all mandatory position members."

"I join the Deliberative, and I move that the requirements for the position of Guardian be changed. I move that the Guardian must be a Solar Exalt, so as to best defend the book and the Sorcery within," speaks Ramar, loudly and quite clearly.

"The Consolidation of Powers Act requires a two-thirds vote in order to enact limits on mandatory roles," the Book announces. "Justify this decision for the record." And while the Book speaks, Raksi's eyes dilate into tiny slits. The others can see the glint of madness in her expression blaze to life like the suddenness of a harsh moon through clouds, and from her fingers talons begin to grow. "You... you...." she growls, voice steadily changing from angel to demon.

Chi-Yosh says, "I join the Deliberative." He smiles towards Raksi. "Aye."

Davron announces in a clear voice, "I join the Deliberative, and vote aye on the motion proposed." As he watches Raksi with trepidation, a chill strikes through him, and not just in fear of his life. The madness he sees in her eyes... has he seen this once before?

"Aye," says Gallius simply. For the first time she looks to Raksi, letting her disgust show. There's really nothing else to say.

"My vote is Aye," announces Ramar, clearly and concisely.

What comes out of Raksi's mouth is not 'Nay', nor even a scream. It is simply the purest sound of rage and madness condensed into a few moments, and even the Solars are taken aback by its fury. And the ape-monster that lurks behind the beautiful human facade leaps out, as Raksi charges Ramar in her unthinking fury.

In this moment, Davron feels Yang's fear - and his own too, at the sight of a creature so disturbingly similar to the one he finds within his own heart.

And in this moment, Chi-Yosh too feels fear - a remembrance of his duel with Raksi, and the terrifying nearness of death in the forgotten and empty city.

And in this moment, Ramar feels elation. He has found the key to securing the Book of Three Circles, and has perhaps started his own legacy. And he too feels terror as he sees the monster come at him, and the terror grows.

Only Gallius remains, with her hate and wish to see Raksi destroyed. And for a moment, time stops for her. She looks, and sees the creature bent on rending Ramar limb from limb. In her heart, a thousand feelings well up. And she sees with a warrior's eye that the Queen of Fangs has left herself unguarded, completely. She could be struck down now, two dozen centuries gone in the blow of a single weapon. She feels her heart screaming out a hundred messages. And, too, she feels the Book of Three Circles radiating a sudden aura of Essence.

And sensing the book ready itself, Gallius holds back. If she will kill Raksi, it will be a matter of honor. An honor she may one day still enjoy. For now, though, a greater power is at work, and the Heirophant shall abide by it. There is a realization that the great powers of the Book of Three Circles were not the result of a single craftsman. They were never a matter of essence. Instead she sees it for what it is. A consensus, a surrendering of power to this ultimate source of law. And even the highest bowed their heads to it.

And in that moment, as Gallius stays her hand, a tremendous flash bursts from the Book of the Sun. It smites Raksi with force enough to smash her against the wall of the study. The searing smell of burned flesh rises in the room, and still Raksi comes, regenerating her injuries as she does. "First warning," drones the Book.

She comes again, attacking Ramar with her talons, no more a woman - now she is simply a fanged ape of the jungle, resplendent with her tattoos and her anima banner shining around her. And again a coruscant bolt strikes her from the Book. "Second warning," the voice calls.

Gallius frowns and steps forward towards Raksi. "If there is anything left in you but beast, cease! One day you and I may have our chance to settle this permenantly. Today is not that day. If you have any honor left in the cage of your madness, you will will join me in putting aside that time. There is real work to be done. Will you scorn the life you have? Or will you willingly step forward and throw down the Realm at our side. Throw down the Deathlords. And drive back the Fair Folk until they cover in their Wyld."

Even as flesh knits itself over bones, the beast that is Raksi has succumbed completely to its instincts, and the fragile thread of human thought that once occupied its mind has snapped. It rushes Ramar a final time, and in that moment, the Book of the Sun blazes with light enough to half-blind the Solars. There is a thunderclap and an explosion that rattles the room; exhibits and materials fall from their shelves with the force of the blast.

A pall of smoke hangs about the study where Raksi worked and kept the Book of Three Circles. And in that light the Solars see a figure. It steps out of the smoke, or rather shapes itself from the smoke and into a woman whose beautiful silvery eyes are flecked with tears. The goddess Luna holds out a fist, then extends her hand slowly, and the Solars behold in her grip a silvery-blue light that sparkles and flickers in magical, almost hypnotic patterns. She regards the Solars one at a time, watching with a curious blend of emotions on her face.

Chi-Yosh stares into the wreckage that was once Raksi. Some part of him is deeply saddened - or filled with pity. She was dangerous, and reckless, and simply wicked viewed from the their ways. But she was a powerful creature, with some honor to her, and simply did not deserve to end her own reckless hands. But every mountain is made into sand by time, and she merely had came to her end. At her own doing, and so it was what she wanted, it seems. The pang grows for a moment, as the Circle is blessed with Luna's sorrowful presence, and the Su'Katan can do nothing but bow his head, for the Lady's sake.

Gallius looks at Luna, then sighs and looks downward. What she says has much to do with Raksi. And with herself. "The Prophecy has not changed," she whispers. "The world moves, but we are the same. I saw it in her eyes. I have seen it in those around me. And I know it in myself. What was broken has not healed. Cannot heal. There is no hope, unless someone should find that flaw and repair it. If this is not done, we will fail again." She turns her thought to Luna, then, "I am sorry. This was not the noble end she was meant for."

"That is the paradox of freedom and law, Gallius," murmurs Luna. "The Sun and the Moon. Strength and Order, and Mystery and Change. But the more freedom you have, the less freedom another will. You can slay a man freely, but he's lost his freedom for the sake of yours. Or you can live as a slave to rules, and dare nothing." She uncurls her fingers, studying the radiant spark that was once Raksi. "Her ghost will rise soon, Gallius. Send her soul to Heaven for me."

"I..." manages Ramar at long last. Both Luna's and Gallius' words strike a chord somewhere deep within his soul. This madness that claimed Raksi, this corruption threatens to destroy, to disrupt nearly everything. For a moment, he finds himself elsewhere. He is within the Library, though this time the books are crumbling and the knowledge fleeting. _Live as a slave to the rules and dare nothing._ Perhaps it is time for the Solar to dare, time to dream. The world can be changed. He has seen how things can be... now is the time to become this change. Ramar blinks, "Her death shall not have been in vain," he says, his voice wavering at first, then becoming curiously determined.

Davron hears the note in Ramar's voice, and hears it mirrored in his own heart. "Someone? _We_ will find that flaw, Lady Gallius," he says, nodding to Ramar. "We, and all else who have the skill and knowledge and will to help. Even now, there are clues on which we can begin our search." He nods toward the pedestals. "A search that may make this one pale in comparison... and yet we will attempt it."

"There is little time," answers Gallius. She extends a hand, and from it the brilliance of the Unconquered Sun surges out, sending Raksi to her rest. "I fear we must move swiftly now," she adds softly. She bows deeply to Luna, then turns to Ramar, "I propose Ramar take the role of Guardian of the Book of Three Circles and that he find for it a safe place to reside until a more permenant arrangement may be made. I also propose new Order 1. All manadatory positions will require two thirds approval and all non mandatory positions will be voted upon if the Heirophant or others in the mandatory positions deem it necessary. I ask for a consensus."

When the measures are passed, Gallius has things to say to her circle that she would rather not. Though things have been done right, she knows very well that something is very wrong. She offers no preamble to what she has to say now. "I am going mad. There can be no doubting it. Hate's grip is growing stronger on me. I do not know how long I can last." She turns to Ramar, "So, do you give permission to move the book from this place to the Nation? I leave it to others to select where. Simply tell me what you need to arrange things."

"I give permission to move the book from this place to the Nation of the Sun," speaks Ramar, adopting as official a tone as he can. As soon as permission is granted he moves beside Gallius, "And I swear that while I am alive, I will not let you give in to madness. Queen of my heart, I will find a way to free you from hate's terrible grip."
