Much effort has gone into the hunt long before the sun rises on Denandsor. Weeks before, a Korad artisan of the tribal tattoos was asked to travel long and far to this land known as the Nation. Bestowed upon him is the honor of transcribing upon the Korad-respected hero Chi-Yosh a mural inked with distilled Yurei, the fruit of a thousand hours by the sorceror Ice. The patterns are minute and sweeping, resembling the diamond scales of the Wood Dragon, and the overlaid layers of triangular armor custom of the Water dragon. Emerald and azure blend together interweave in a tapestry over the Su'Katan. When it is done, Essence flows through the finished work, turning aside the arrows of a dozen prized archers. Scales of the Soul's Blossom is finished.

Two weeks are devoted to the Sidereal Art. Hard labor of the mind, spirit and body forge out the path of the Four Magical Materials, their form spun out into the Dawn. When all is ready, he begins a new pattern, learning the ways of Gods and Spirits, mimicing the Essence signatures of other living things. It takes Chi-Yosh long to finish such a task, but he becomes accustomed to it, and finally with satisfaction he nods. The student is ready to meet Raksi. But one last piece remains unfinished.

Finally, he visits the Court of the Chase. There, seated upon a throne of bone and hoof woven with pelts, under a crown of antlers, the Huntsmen, lord of all the cycles of predation and survival, bears witness to the Solar. He bows before the god. "I am to commence a great game of survival, Lord of the Hunt. I wish to make it a grand experience, an enjoyment for all. I ask only for you to help make it a spectacular event in your honor. Anything less would not be acceptable."

The Sun rises in the East, and the Moon rises opposite it, while the Magic Moon dances lazily between them through day and night. Accordingly, Chi-Yosh has entered Denandsor from the eastern side. And at the same time, Raksi passes through the western gates of the city. She has come alone, apparently. No demonic servitors, no dragons, and no beast-man allies accompany her. She wears only a long and feather-laden cloak, and carries a curvy-bladed dagger whose edge glints wickedly in the pre-dawn light. Her eyes are agleam with bloodlust. She is already in the hunt.

Chi-Yosh has arrived wearing little else - a loincloth, and a mantle of deer hide, beneath which is sewn his many hearthstones. Around his waist is attached a glittering seven-section staff, water and orichalcum blended with a spider's precision. He begins the patterns of Charms, but that preperation is brief, just one or two for now. For the hunt has began, and he does not wish to stand idle, easy pickings for the Queen of Fangs. Rather than dart into the heart of the city, his movements glide across the perimiter, heading northwest. It has began.

Chi-Yosh slides through the hollowed glass of a building, perching on a ledge overlooking a neighborhood of the city. A few days prior, Davron had brought a wagonload of supplies, working like mad to prepare the city for today. He mentally reviews the map of each location, the triggers, what will be needed, and how to get Raksi inside. Outfoxing the fox is no small trick. Darting across a lampost spanning the width of the street, Chi-Yosh slides down a spiralling gutter. Even if he knows where they are on the map, he wants to find a few necessary areas first - the tunnels beneath the city, a few key buildings. These he hunts through the winding streets and over glittering roofs, always stopping and reviewing his surroundings for the ever vigilant Raksi.

Never stay in one place, but find a territory to stalk. The Bronze Tiger keeps this in mind, passing over the paved streets that glitter in the morning light, passing weather-veins that shift and chime the wind's direction, temperature and strength, over signs of characters crafted into the sky. Escape routes are devised and traversed, one such through a honey-combed building of spherical rooms made with furniture on every surface, past through polished alleys that steal the rainwater into polished drainage tunnels that filter it into drinkable pools. Out a tunnel and into the street again, where for a moment, the Dawn is exposed. Then up the layered hexagonial glass bricks of one building to the rooftop again. Restless. The beautiful mirror sheen and beauty does not set him at ease, for underneath the shine of the city hides something dangerous and primal.

It takes a mere two hours for Chi-Yosh to hear the snarling growl of the Queen of Fangs. She is perched high atop a building whose shadow he took refuge in, and he watches as she leaps heedlessly into the air, intent on crashing bodily into him.

Chi-Yosh leans back, on the defensive. The motion sends Essence boiling over him, tightening his form, then relaxing it into a fluidity of graceful evasion. There's no time to run, and not enough fight to defend, just yet - he must avoid a strike before he can land one himself. Even as the Essence surges, the tiger scurries, diving behind a fountain.

Chi-Yosh dives and rolls, Essence guiding his body. He comes up in his stance behind the fountain, finding a sudden slickness about his ribs, and from past experience he knows it is his own blood. Raksi still crouches where she landed, holding out her crimson-stained blade. Carefully she brings it to her mouth, licking at the hot blood like a child tasting her favorite dessert.

Pouncing from her perch, the blood-stained blade licks in like steel lightning, seeking to taste Chosen blood once more. Chi-Yosh flickers, drawing to the left, before dipping and curling to the right, arms weaving to cradle Raksi's wrist. Like savage dancers, the pair twirl as the Solar sweeps the wicked talon from the Queen of Fangs, tucking it against his body, crouching down.

Wounded and unable to channel a Charm into the attack, Chi-Yosh is left with a purely mortal move. But there is nothing mundane about having stolen the chosen weapon of Raksi, and wielding it against her. Gribbing it tight to his ribs, and cupping the pummel with the other hand, the Bronze tiger bares his claws in a low, forward lunge, wrenching his whole body upwards in one jagged slice for the belly of the beast.

Mighty, tempered flesh parts across Raksi's stomach, a long ugly line that will last only in the Queen's memory. No pain, no anguish over the wound, but one low, threatening growl, and a determined glare that sets Chi-Yosh on his heels. Now, instincts scream to run.

The Solar has no time to run, not yet. As he moves back, Raksi is there, her fist collapsing him and sending him rolling across the stones of the plaza. He hasn't stopped sliding before she's atop him again, feet fist, landing on only a braid and nearly scalping the Dawn as he finds purchase once more, fleeing from a wind-breaking thrust of her nails. He is off, through an alley, and headed for a building of glittery metal and crystaline craft. He must get there before her, he must get out before her.

Raksi paces Chi-Yosh easily, her inhuman power and grace sending her bounding over obstacles that would fluster any mortal huntsman. Nevertheless Chi-Yosh can discern the limits of her human form - she is better than he, but not superlatively. Superior, but not unbeatably so. And again she attacks him with flying fists, one punch a second. She laughs as she comes, a mocking madwoman having sport in this dead place.

Flow Like Blood will evade without thought, moving the body away from an offense. This is often a boon for the Solar, but when running high speed through a tight alley, it is less so - Raksi is atop him and swinging, sending him pitching to the side, and almost into the adjacent wall. Time in Gaia honed his reflexes to their max, allowing him to go up rather than into the masonry. Free hand dropping to his makeshift belt, he whips it upwards, the staff wrapping around a gutter and clinging tight. The Solar twists and swings out wide, spinning in a tight circle on the impromptu line.

Once more the blows come, striking him in ways that only send the Dawn swinging higher. And as the backswing comes, he kicks the wall to stir a vicious spin, bringing him right back to Raksi knife-point first, baring down on her heart. The staff receives a two-handed grip suddenly, jerking Chi-Yosh up, and up comes his legs, coiling tight to unfold in a kick upon the pummel of Raksi's knife. The strike sends him wheeling backwards to land on his feet, staff dislodged from above, and now in hand.

The knife opens a fair gash in Raksi's flawless skin, and the staff lands with a sickening thud against it. But these injuries don't seem to faze the Queen of Fangs. She laughs in her mad fashion, seemingly excited and aroused by the presence of her own blood mingling with the Solar's on the blade.

Sensing a momentary pose from Raksi, the Solar is moving once more. He is simply no match for her without the necessary charms up. He needs time. And thus he runs, diving through the low, empty window of the steel and crystal spire. The pre-laid trick Davron has fashioned may be too slow, too obvious for the clever Queen. But perhaps her madness will slow her percetions of his game.

The breath of the stalker is on the Su'Katan's neck. She's near by, then nearly on top of him, prowling through the halls and rooms with a patient speed. Around her, the supports of the tower are weathered and cracked in places, cracks that if the time were taken, look too new, too artificial to come from the wear of weight upon time. Then she spots him darting down a hall, and the chase is at its final heart pounding stage, the Queen turning into the passage to find him, waiting. His coiled staff unleashes itself upon a mark along a cracked central pillar, and the beam begins to fissure, crumbling, before simply shattering. The building shrieks in protest. And the Dawn is moving - down a hall, up the rupturing stairs, punching through a wall, then through a window, in time for the structure to sunder itself to the ground.

---

Perched in a deep nook carved into the side of a watch tower, the prey hunkers, breathing, watching, waiting. The deep gash in his belly burns, a sign the salve smeared inside is fighting infection, helping bring the body back together and keep Essence from leaking further. His first encounter with Raksi is not encouraging - she's fast, too fast, and he is little more than a rabbit with teeth without the needed defenses raised. But this time, he has more up his sleeve than an old building and reckless attacks.

Pacing the watch tower, taking the time to evade the sensors of the guards, Chi-Yosh prowls uncomfortably. Hearthstone reaching out to the floor around him, listening to the floors below, and watching out the windows, he feels safe but tortured. Inside, he will be given enough time to put on the cloak of defense, by Raksi's hesitation or the guards' defensive actions. In addition, he has two viable escape plans, each reachable by the time Raksi might reach him. Yet, one of the most cruel parts of the duel is not the moments of stomach-wrenching batttle, but waiting for it. Hours spent looking over the shoulder, expecting her to come. One can either sit and wait, or be up, mobile.

Proving that the watch tower is no safe place, the wall erupts beside the window Chi-Yosh peers past, the Lunar landing atop her prey, knife poised. The building goes on high alert, siren blaring as the battle rages in short, vicious seconds. The stomp of guards metallic boots on stairs are synched with the blow by blow of the rabid melee. By the time the automata burst inside, the room is bloody, the Solar is gone, and Raksi is laughing, hugging the knife as she falls backwards through the gaping hole. Though as she stalks once more, there's no sight of Dawn, the only motion from a roving wagon, collecting a garbage can before it moves onwards.

Torches burning with ever-burning Essence peel the darkness away, creating shadows of light that creep over the bowels of the Empty City. They cast an eerie, full glow upon the entrance to the Denandsor crypts. While the Zenith of the age clensed the dead, the momentos of the fallen were still buried, and heros were entombed within. Thus, the threat of the dead rising was still a caution even in the early days - and looters will always exist, and thus defense is necessary from the inside out and the outside in. Curtains of crystalin salt hang like tapestries of beads hang throughout the entrance to the catacombs, just beyond doors of lime and saltstone. Flanking every door are the solid guardians, the Companions of the Fallen - great bird-like creations of sheening black metal, fashioned in the likeness of crows and ravens, the messangers and watchers of the dead.

Dust has coated the halls leading to the tombs of the fallen, collected like quilts over the Companions. Not a speck is disturbed as a deafening eruption rings through the tight tunnels, one after another, bits of shattered rock skittering out of tunnels into the chamber they branch from. However, when flesh and blood walk before the doors, both Companions stir, sending the cloak of idle ages spraying the air. "Halt, citizen," says one, lifting a great talon. The command is accepted, before the guardians defenses rise: a charm is used. They immediately move into flanking, before the threat merely disappears into the immaterial realm. The threat still exists, the Companions senses wise, but in moments the incorporal threat is gone as well. They pause, halting in a moment's hesitation, before returning to their posts, all but one out of sync with the others. Inside the great machine, Chi-Yosh waits. If she is to come for him, then he shall choose where, and how, she is to strike.

The charm has merged the Solar's Essence with that of the automata, allowing him to possess it, exercise it, and as the nature of Solars, push it far beyond the expected limitations. For now, he explores all those capabilities, for the Bronze Tiger must wait in its self-made cage. It is both a relief and a discomfort, for he knows how the Queen of Fangs will arrive, but he does not know how he will exit the collapsed catacombs. And stuck deep beneath the stone, away from the Unconquered Sun, he does not know how long this hunt will go - a few motes are spent, simply checking the progression of the Sun in the sky. The hunt could take a solid day, but with this drastic move, Chi-Yosh hopes to force Raksi's hand, spend the precious power that will make her stay within the Empty City shorter.

In time, Chi-Yosh becomes aware of a distant presence, drawing closer. He can feel it more clearly for the solitude of the city around him; life here is a forgotten memory, and there is no mistaking the only other being who would have business in the city.

Essence swells through the possessed Companion, its heavy body for a moment becoming agile and inlayed with evasive instinct. It will not hold that power for long - the huntress is approaching, and her quarry will not stay long in his protective shell. Heart racing, he prepares himself for the true test of cunning and power against the top of the Chosen food chain.

Moments pass. Then minutes. Chi-Yosh can hear the scraping sound of a dagger running along a metal wall, and the faint breathing of Raksi as she draws near. He also hears the slight sounds of something else - a bird, sounding very much like the magical guide Davron called up in Gaia.

As one the Companions of the Companions of the Fallen straighten, and spread their stance, ebon wings veined with Essence flare out, while talons crackle with power unharnessed in centuries, long overdue for use. They step forth into a V formation before the tomb doors, waiting for the source to come into sight. Days earlier, the guardians received a new purpose - be on alert for non-citizen intruders. Not the most smooth of transitions, but an effective temporary change, one that comes alive in full. Except for one in the back, which turns, and through the passcode gifted only to the guardians, it opens the tomb doors, letting them swing wide.

The dagger and bird sounds fade. The guardians stand ready. And what leaps through is more than shadow, less than animal. It is most assuredly Raksi, from the glimpses Chi-Yosh catches, but her dagger severs metal with ease time and again as the automata move - all too slowly.

Slow yes, but the craftsmen of the First Age were no meager smiths hammering meak ornaments. The Companions shift together, and begin to circle the agile threat. Their feathers spread like threatening snap of a raptor's wings, before talons reach, an angry forest of metalic trees screeching with definite intent. There is no warning, no threat, just their purpose unleashed, talons and cracking power rising like the orchestra of haunting shrieks echoing from the guards, a final alarm to those around. Finally, the last Companion joins the fray, leaving a lone figure behind.

Standing for a moment, the Solar is truelly the Bronze Tiger - flesh cleaming with likeness of distilled sunlight, the lethal talons of the Stars pointed edge, with the raw temper of the Poles churning through his Anima like aether blood. The flicker of the torches are on him, then not - their touch only glimpsing the lightning stalk. Twisting through the powerful limbs and dense bodies comes those claws, a sharp snapping around the body of the madness called Raksi.

Like a fly caught in a moonsilver web, Raksi's body wrenches and writhes, bucking under the grip wound tight about her arms. The Solar is there with her, keeping her yoked with every ounce of might. A second test of strength and wills continues, before the Queen of Fangs is bent in the hold, exposed to the defenders of the dead.

Designed to defend until a threat is terminated, a command issued, or destruction, the funeral of Companions do not hesitate in the weakness of their foe. Like scavangers on carrion they flock and flood, unmerciful at rending and snapping crystaline beaks into unprotected, bare flesh, the searing of essence-crackling wings adding a counterpoint to the bloodletting. A citizen is in the way, and while they are meant to be professional until provoked by the people of Denandsor, they are not careful here. Thus a moment Chi-Yosh's grip waivers, his skin carved where the ravaging became frenzied.

Almost at the end of her life, Raksi is showing a clear amount of injury. Even Chi-Yosh can see the desperation in her eyes as she shouts the words of an invocation - but not a regular shaping of sorcery. Her anima explodes in light and fury as he hears her utter "Spell Matrix!" in Old Realm. And with a whirling hurricane of Essence around her, the Lunar sorceress vanishes.

Sagging amid the towering guardians, Chi-Yosh stares down at his scraped, empty arms. She was forced to flee, forced to spend some of her power, forced to waste time. The duel will be a greater threat now. One of the guardians stares down at the Solar. "Citizen, you do not belong here. Come with me." A talon wraps around the Solar's wrist, and he is forcibly lifted, and pulled down a tunnel.

---

Once the Companion finished its befuddlement over the cave in, and burrowed through the rubble, Chi-Yosh easily slipped past and into the tunnels beyond, and into the barron passages of the underground transportation system. Now the Solar is left to wonder where he will go next. The day has all ready worn on him, and even if he's suffered only minorly, it has taxed his resiliance and strength. And for the first moment, he now misses his Circle, their support, their presence and guidance. The trials ahead shall be harsher, and true rest and support would be a blessing. A blessing that shall not come until the Empty City banishes them with fear.

Beneath the streets of Denandsor are a gridwork of tunnels. Once a magnificent transportation system, drawing one throughout the city within minutes. Now, the passageways are tombs of dust, yawning in silence thick enough to touch. Yet now something has come into them, something that breathes, the sound echoing and distorting in the thirsty air. A man crouches, clinging like a spider in a niche along a tunnel's ceiling. While not far from a platform that opens up into the city, the Solar's perch still allows for two ways to his location. The tunnel itself has gone under some rough renovation - small mirrors face either tunnel entrance, obscured from ground level but viewable from above. New piping runs up the center of the tunnel, half obscured by a rail and worn stone.

Silence reigns in the city, as it has for centuries. Yet in the distance, Chi-Yosh's keen hearing begins to detect a rumbling sound. It seems to come from all around him at first, before becoming more localized - in fact, it's emanating from one of the tunnels.

It seems to resemble an earthquake at first, or perhaps the pounding of a thousand elephants across a southeastern veldt. But Chi-Yosh hears a scream from the tunnel, a shout of insane fury that warns him that his hunter is at hand.

Finally it appears - coming down the tunnel in the distance, Chi-Yosh can see Raksi. But she is not walking, or even running. She is standing. And what she stands atop, with arms outstretched in exhortation of more speed, is a vast terraserpent - a conjured elemental of enormous size. The beast is tearing through the tunnels, damaging even the nigh-invulnerable walls of the First Age city with its elemental might.

Action, movement. At the glimps of the onrushing power, the Solar cannot afford hesitation. He drops from the ceiling as the elemental draws close, landing feet first onto a large set of bellows. Holes punched through the piping burst, their flimsy wax coating no match for the eruption of air. Glittering red powder fogs the air. Never stopping, the Su'Katan leaps, bounding through the cloud and off a wall. His wrist snaps, flicking the stick in hand and throwing it in the same motion. Chemicals inside rush together, and in a moment, the stick bursts into flames. Then the firedust ignites.

Fire roars through the tunnel in either direction like a tidal wave of boiling air and the licking tendrils of a volcano. Chi-Yosh soars through the initial blast, the watery consistency of his staff whirling around him quick enough to carve a hole through the blaze, before he bursts out onto the underground platform. Fire still ripples and clings to his body like a swarm of angry red hornets, but he brushes it aside, and charges up the steps to the surface.

The inferno parts, and Raksi and her elemental steed explode through it, more or less intact despite the mass of magical fire around them. Chi-Yosh can hear the tunnel crumbling behind him as he runs, and the platform buckles like splintering wood under an Easterner's axe as the terraserpent crosses over it. Raksi is almost directly behind him now.

With an avalanche on his heels, Chi-Yosh has the proper inspiration to reach the top of the stairs. Once surfaced, he wheels around and takes off in the opposite direction of the stairs, seeking to buy precious seconds. Essence spills through him, and for a moment he's a blur, spearing through an alley. The true threat is not the crushing mammoth behind him, but time - crucial seconds he simply does not have yet.

The entrance is destroyed; it explodes outward in a shower of stone chunks as the terraserpent breaks through. It turns, and Raksi has already caught sight of her prey. She gives voice to a wordless screech, and the elemental responds to her primal fury by twisting its bulk about, to the degree that it can.

Breaking the alley, the Dawn turns sharply, in time to evade the eruption of bricks as the serpent slides over the stones and curls around, never losing its pace. Up and over a cart, demolished before his feet touch the side of a building, Chi-Yosh makes it to an overhanging walkway, only to have the stone thing rear up, tearing it from the very walls. Standing on the platform long enough to steal its momentum, the Solar's staff whips out, coiling around a side-street's lamp post to swing to land with a diving roll on a parralel lane, moments before the wall behind him bursts with the terraserpent's head.

HIgher. He must reach higher. Off a food stand with materials long ago rotted away, springing against the statue of some great hero, and off a balcony, the Solar fights his way seconds before the wave of destruction eats his footholds. He has made a great circle, returning to the neighborhood the elemental had first crushed through. Diving between two sagging buildings, he kicks off one wall and arches, landing upon the roof the other. Below, the first floor is reduced to powder with the serpent's second coming, and the buliding teeters, falling to crash into a neighbor, which follows suit. And Chi-Yosh is there, running over the dipping roof, then up and over the second, to hurl himself upon a third. At his high vantage point, the Dawn is harder to spot, but soon he makes himself clear, making a mad dash towards the center of the city.

As he races over the roofs of the Empty City, the terraserpent rises, bursting through level after level until it breaches a roof behind him, bringing the howling Raksi with it, before the mammoth head dives inside another building like some great whale playing in the waters. As the Bronze Tiger jumps across the street, it blasts over the avenue right behind, sliding without pause right behind, leaving a wake of rubble behind. He stops at the edge of a roof, glancing back, allowing that which pierces mountains to draw closer. He leaps one last time.

Once magnificent, the Palace of Eternal Health has been marred. Its alabaster dome has been wounded, the remains of a flying ship littering the gaping gash in the Manse's side. The Essence engine of the ship mingles with the now cracked, free power flooding the Manse, bottled up, having no real path to travel. Once more something falls upon the dome, a mere few steps. The barer wrenches around, diving back the way he came, through a window in the opposite building. Too fast for the earthen hound at his heels, the serpent blasting through the Palace's wall, into the guts, before it can start to turn around.

Rolling to his feet, Chi-Yosh turns looks out through the enormous hole the terraserpent left, just in time to spot the wicked blade coming for him, the firey light of a madwoman's eyes right behind the blade's point. He dives out of the way, rising across from the landing Queen of Fangs. They both share a look as iridescent light floods from the windows, the building rocking with an eruption that shatters glass and the half-standing buildings around.

A pillar of heatless silver light erupts from Raksi as she charges, face agleam with instinct and menace. Essence swirls about her in a pattern Chi-Yosh recognizes but has never before seen - a Lunar Combo of some sort. Talons erupt from Raksi's hands, preparing to rend the flesh from his bones.

The room was once a sanctuary, statues of heros long turned to dust, curtains with barely noticable runes in the patchwork guarding from eavesdropping ears, nooks for musicians to play unnoticed, and all necessary for quiet contemplation and advisement. That was before the room was ravaged, and now yet more rages inside. The destroyer of the serenity is held at bay only by her target vaulting behind a statue, the marble only slowing the talons seeking his flesh. But then he siezes the curtains, yanking them downwards. Claws shred through, and become tangled in the occult-strengthened sheets, the Queen of Fangs momentarily blinded in a simple wall cloth. Some of the occult power remains, dampening the sounds of her victim skittering out from under the sheets, and falling through the hole in the wall.

The simple diversion is shredded in an instant by the furious Lunar, and Chi-Yosh can feel the radiant heat and hatred broiling from her anima banner even from where he is. She leaps after him in a headlong dive, intent now on claiming his life.

Falling down to the ground level, Chi-Yosh is almost paniced. He cannot stand against the Lunar. He turns and takes two running steps to the doorway, and rams into the heavy body of an automata guard. Behind him are a cluster of others, and likely more surrounding the building. Great paths of destruction awakened the protectors, and the channeling of Essence in the area of attack has grabbed their attention.

"Fool. You are not the only one who knows how to control them," growls Raksi from behind Chi-Yosh. And indeed, he can now see that the magically-animated sentinels are targeting not her, but him.

Surrounded. While he could try to flee, the huntress is right there on his back. With the guards after him, the chance to escape drops even lower. And soon his blood would find her bare body. In those slow moments of realization, Chi-Yosh turns to Raksi. He makes a slow prowl to her, each motion flexing the muscles over his lean, powerful frame, making a show of every bit not covered by his meager cloth. Blood, dirt and sweat make the display all that more gritty and raw. "There are countless tales that you often mate with your food. What better a morsel than I, who's given you a challenging hunt?" The Bronze Tiger halts before her, tilting his head back and to the side, baring the long line of his throat, as if exposing his weakness openly, and in that same motion offering more.

Raksi pauses, the madness slowly fading from her eyes. But in that glance, Chi-Yosh detects something else: a sense of urgency. The Queen of Fangs is fighting off the pressure of the city's curse even now, and even he can detect her passions and phobias swirling in an aroused, confused mixture. "You offer yourself to die," she murmurs, savorig the words that escape her throat. "Unexpected."

Drawing closer, he reaches out, the backs of dirty fingers dragging over bare flesh, taunting the supple skin of the Lunar's belly. "I do not offer myself to die," he retorts, words slow, careful, almost breathy, "But instead, to live more then I have ever before. One last time. If I will fall to you, it will not be in fear at the end of a bloody crawl, but of breathless passion and, of my willingness." He raises a brow, leaning closer. "Shall I run? Or get closer?"

Raksi's emotional intensity grows visibly on her face. Chi-Yosh can watch her savoring the thrill of the chase again, and watch her struggles as she wrestles between indulging herself and satisfying her other needs - to protect her honor as the Queen of Fangs and secret holder of the Book of Three Circles.

And Chi-Yosh watches, as Raksi exerts the force of her will against the whirlpool of her feelings. And he watches a look of sudden horror break over her face. For Raksi can no longer resist the power of the city's curse.

It starts as a tremor of fear that courses through her, that reaches down into the base of all living things to that decision of fight or flight, and squeeze the latter until nearly cripples the Queen of Fangs. Then it moves to a shudder of the body, of muscles screaming for escape, and then the mind is drenched with the terror of fears of children in the darkness, of things more primal and unexplained - something mindless. There is no where else but escape, and with a shriek of horror and anger, the realization she must leave, and its consequences still on her mind, the Queen of Fangs erupts into motion, shoving the Solar aside. Her cloak of feathers is a cloud of destruction as the Elder Lunar claws her way through guards, and out into the city, the sound of defiant defeat echoing from her with every draw of breath. The Queen of Fangs is not quiet about her loss.

As Raksi draws out of sight, Chi-Yosh staggers from the sundered building. Hours of exhaustion, pain, stress and anxiety hit him like a barbarian's club. Two blocks from the rubble is a small courtyard, with a fountain still bubbling with water kept fresh by a tiny bit of Essence still rolling around inside. He drapes himself over the edge, and allows for a moment of true rest. No threats lurking around the corner, no need to pay attention to his surroundings, no need to do anything but simply savor the fact he survived the Queen of Fangs, that the Circle now has the Book of Three Circles, and simply that he is alive.
