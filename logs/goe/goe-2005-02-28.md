# Gods of Eden 2005-02-28

Dark. There is nothing but darkness in all directions. In the midst of this, floats a young woman, of perhaps 19 summers. Her hair moves in a wind and bobs as if she were floating on the ocean. For a time she sets there, her eyes closed, sleeping, a look of utter peace on her face. How long she is there is impossible to say. A few minutes, hours, a thousand lives of men.. here nothing changes.

But here where nothing changes, something finally does change, and the woman floating feels a strange sensation. Her eyes open. Light. There is light. She turns. Left. There is a left. She knows this somehow. Looking down, she sees in this place where there is no one else, there is someone else. A young girl of perhaps five summers is standing there, pulling at the sleeve of the sleeping woman. The little girl smiles warmly and says, "I thought you would never wake."

The young woman smiles back at her, remembering how. "Did I oversleep?" she asks. The young girl laughs cheerfully and nods quickly. She takes the woman by the hand then, tugging her again. "Get up, sleepyhead! It's so early and I want to play!"

The woman laughs, following the girl with a grin. "Let's go play," she agrees. She wants to play. For some reason she feels so tired. For some reason she feels so sad that she can barely hold back the tears.

The little girl draws the young woman on, taking her through the darkness into a brightly lit park, with ladders and slides and swings and warm grass. The girl hops on a swing and says, "Push me, push me!" She smiles widely, looking back at the young woman with bright, joyful eyes.

The young woman nods to the girl, but as she steps behind her, she looks around, seeing what lies beyond the park. In all directions around the park, there is a strange scene, its horrible noise somehow dimmed. Battle. Thousands of men strive against far more hideous things of bone and rot. Things that fear nothing for they have long since lost everything. The young woman hesitates a moment, lost in the horror of what rages about her.

"Silly, quit wasting time! Push me!" chides the young girl, who kicks her feet and turns a playful pout at the young woman.

The young woman turns away from the battle slowly, as if she were being forced to watch. She reaches out to take hold of the chains of the swing, drawing back the young girl and letting her go.

"Yaaaaay!" The young girl laughs happily, kicking her feet to swing higher, though for the most part she's relying on the pushing of the young woman to keep her aloft.

The young woman finally smiles again, able to ignore the war for the joy of the young girl. She loses herself for a time in the pushing of the swing, in the happy laughter of the child, and the sound of the chain moving. Suddenly she hears a scream to her right and just a few feet from her a man falls, reaching out towards her, his hand desperately reaching out before a beastial shape throws itself upon him, stabbing down with a crude spear and twisting it cruelly in the ribs of the fallen man. The young woman stops her pushing, letting out a horrible scream and scrambling backwards, trying to escape.

Dark. Everything is dark again. The young woman's eyes are closed, here where there is nothing. Her hair moves to the rythm of a wind and bobs as if carried on some updraft of warm air. She sleeps.

Here where there is nothing, the young woman feels a strange pulling sensation, her eyes opening. Light. She remembers light. Her left hand is being pulled by a young girl, here where there is nothing. "I thought you'd never wake up!" the young girl says teasingly, a warm smile on her face.

"Have I overslept?" asks the young woman. "I'm sorry." She reaches out to take the hand of the young girl. "Would you like to go play now?" she asks softly.

The little girl wrinkles her nose and giggles, taking the offered hand and leading the way through the dark. The dark. It ends suddenly on a playground with swings, slides, ladders, and soft, warm grass. "I want to go on the slide! Catch me!"

The young woman laughs softly and nods, moving to the bottom of the slide. "Be careful," she warns. "I don't want you to fall and get a scrape." She looks around then, seeing that beyond the park it is quiet, but a strange man is out there, tall, with a noble bearing, and a brilliant glow about him.

"Catch me! Catch me!" calls out the little girl, hopping onto the slide and gliding down it quickly.

The young woman dries her eyes away from the strange man with four arms, catching the little girl with a smile. "Do you want to go again?" 'Uh-huh!' The little girl giggles loudly, quickly climbing back up the slide once more. Again and again she slips down the slide, giggling in delight and encouraging the young woman to try it just once.

The little girl finally draws the young woman to the ladder of the slide, pushing her up. The young woman laughs as she climbs, standing atop the slide. She looks down, and there is the man with four arms, waiting for her and watching closely. "Catch me!" calls out the young woman before she rides the slide downward.

The young woman is set on her feet after being caught by the strange man. "Thank you," she says gently. The man smiles at her, making sure the young woman is planted on her feet. He asks, "Have you decided yet?"

The question makes the young woman uncomfortable. She turns to the slide, just in time to catch the young girl. The little girl looks up at the four armed man and ducks behind the young woman, clinging to her skirts, half-hiding from the strange man. "I don't understand," the young woman says, reaching down to set a hand upon the young girl's head.

"I asked you if you were going to keep this," says the man, holding out a shimmering, dancing light. "I told you I would hold onto it until you made up your mind. So! Have you decided yet?"

The young woman frowns, obviously unsure. "I.. I do not know. I haven't had enough time yet." She looks down at the little girl, stroking her hair, "I'm so happy here. Why can't I just stay forever?"

"You must find that answer yourself," says the strange man. "I will come when you are ready." He turns to go, but stops a moment. His rather gruff expression remains stern as he leans down to look at the little girl. With a sudden grin a powerful arm extends, deft fingers slipping behind her ear and drawing out a small piece of candy. The little girl claps her hands and laughs in delight, seizing the gift with a wide grin. Patting the head of the child, the four armed man turns away and is simply gone.

Dark. Here where there is nothing, it is dark. And yet here a young woman and a little girl curl up on a large bed, facing each other. "It's nice here," says the young woman. The little girl nods, smiling. "It's very nice. We can play whenever we want." The young woman yawns and nods a little bit again, "Do you want to go swimming in the pond tomorrow?" The little girl nods quickly, letting her eyes drift shut.

Dark. here where there is nothing, it is dark. And yet here is a young woman, her hair moving in an unseen wind. Here a young girl is at her side, pulling at the left hand of the young woman, waking her from slumber.

"I thought you would never wake up!" says the young girl. She laughs and takes the hand of the young woman, drawing her after her. "Come on, there is something you have to see!"

The young woman laughs softly, following quickly. "Where are we going?" she asks.

"Shhhh!" The young girl puts a finger to her lips, leading the way more quietly, now. The place she takes the young woman to is dark, the sky cast in the dark of night. The little girl seems confused, stopping suddenly. "It's day. How can it be so dark?" she asks quietly. She moves to the side of the young woman. "We should go. I'm scared."

The young woman frowns thoughtfully. She looks around, seeing things beyond. Things moving, like blobs of a deeper blackness. She draws the young girl close, trying to keep her warm. "This is familiar," she murmurs.

The little girl trembles, clinging to the young woman. "You've been here before?" she asks curiously.

The young woman looks uncertain. "No. I don't think I have. But it is familiar. We should go away now."

The young girl nods quickly, leading the way once more, her path winding away from those darker patches, the two flowing slower now that they draw close, finally merging like pools of ink. Or blood.

The young woman follows closely, and the two eventually reach a higher spot, where they can watch the churning masses of black surge and flow below them. Abruptly there is a plunging light from above, a dragon of fire bearing upon it was seems to be a star. It is answered by a far greater, more terrifying light below. From the dragon the star falls, arching towards the growing light below. For a moment, all seems still and quiet.

And then, in a flash of red and blue the darkness is done. In a flash of red and blue both the falling star and the other light are gone. In a flash of light, the surging mass is suddenly still. So very still.

"What was that?" whispers the young girl nervously. "What happened?"

The young woman shivers and feels the hairs on the back of her neck stirred by something other than the wind. "I.."

---

"Men are dying down there," says the young woman. She stands in full armor, with a spear in her right hand. "We have to do something." At her side, the little girl bites her lip, half-hiding at her side. "What can we do?" she asks softly.

The young woman looks to the young girl, smiling at her fondly. "You have to wait. You are a healer. I have to move, though." The young woman steps forward, quickly climbing onto the back of a great, burning dragon. With a hot wind it bears her aloft, the very air screaming from the heat as the dragon begins its desperate flight towards the darkness below.

The young woman bursts into a greater light, pitting her fragile light against the hateful glow of sorcery below. Down there, an army of men struggles wildly against an ocean of death and madness, the undead biting, clawing, and tearing the defender's flesh. And behind wall upon wall of living corpses She can be found, glowing with dark energies and hurling death, heedless of how many of her own die, so long as the living are scourged.

It is there that the young woman throws herself, letting her body fall towards the glow of sorcery. Towards the one who is the source of all this blackness.

As she falls, the glow of sorcery grows brighter and brighter. Finally, the young woman can fall no more, and with a crash of orichalcum upon soulsteel, she strikes out.

---

Dark. Here where there is nothing, it is dark. And yet here there is a young girl, trembling and covering her eyes with both hands. Over her a young woman stoops, reaching out to gather the child in her warm arms. "Do not cry," says the young woman softly. "Dear one, do not cry."

The little girl sniffles, raising her head. "I had a bad dream," she says, wiping at her eyes. The young woman smiles calmly, running her fingers through the little girl's hair. "Shhh! It's okay now. You are awake, and I will never let anyone harm you."

The little girl bites her lip, asking in her a very soft voice, "But how can you stop them?"

---

The crashing of the young woman and the sorceror results in a surge of light that destroys the darkness above. The light sears and destroys, turning walking corpses to ash and slaying men where they stand, melting skin to armor and burning out the lungs of those who try to scream.

The young girl cries out in anguish from above, rushing down towards the heat, down towards the place where no man can live.

"You have to wait. You are a healer."

The little girl rushes on, stopping only when she feels a twinge in her chest. Her next breath explodes with pain and she finds herself on her knees. She looks down, because her chest feels wet.

"You are awake, and I will never let anyone harm you."

The little girl sees the feathers of an arrow sprouting from her chest. She sees the spreading inky darkness of blood on the cloth of her shirt. She looks ahead, seeing the men dying before her, and she collapses forward, trying to pull herself along the ground to them. Trying so hard. Her mouth grows dry, and each breath fills her vision with stars.

---

Dark. Here where there is nothing, it is dark. Here where there is nothing, a young woman speaks softly as she stares down at her hands. "I was there."

And as she speaks, a finger glows, then fades, turning more solid. Here where there is nothing, the faint outline of the young woman finds greater stability in a single finger.

The young girl peeks over the shoulder of the young woman, looking at her finger with wide eyes. "What did you do?" she asks softly. She rushes around to take the hand of the young woman, then, looking at it closely.

"I died," says the young woman. She looks the little girl.

The little girl studies that finger and shakes her head. She turns her smile up at the young woman, "Is that what you want to do?"

The young woman sighs, looking uncomfortable and confused. "Why can't I just stay here?" she asks. "It's so peaceful. I'm happy here."

"Only you can answer that question," answers the young girl. "Let's go play. I want you to show me a new place today. We can go to the park some other day."

The young woman nods quickly, taking the young girl by the hand and leading the way. "I have something very nice to show you," she says. The pair moves through the dark, coming out into a bright day and a warm, rolling wind touching high grass. On they walk, going past empty farmhouses and finally coming to a city. Oddly, it is empty of people. There is no traffic on the road.

The young woman leads the way further still, opening the door of a much larger building that appears to have been built out many times recently. She winds through halls until finally a greater chamber is reached.

In that chamber people talk in nervous voices. A strong woman sits on a throne, and about her are set many other people, all with worry in their faces. Their words are ignored by the young woman and the little girl, though.

"Who are these people?" asks the little girl. "They sure do talk a lot," she observes. She walks around, staring at each of those gathered here. She pauses before a woman with pink hair, "She's very pretty, isn't she?"

"Her name is Jin-nu," says the young woman. "She is very pretty, and gentle, as well." The young woman turns about, "I know all these people," she says, sounding very confused.

"Were they all gentle and nice?" asks the little girl. She looks to the woman on the throne. "She is scary."

The young woman looks at the queen on her throne and nods, "She scares me, too." She frowns, shaking her head. "I don't know her name."

"Maybe she is a visitor from somewhere else," suggests the little girl.

"I don't know," answers the young woman. "I've never seen her before."

"Can we go away now?" asks the little girl. She moves over to the side of the young woman, gripping her skirt tightly and looking up at her hopefully. "I'm scared."

The young woman bends down, picking up the little girl and laughing softly. "We can go," she says. "But there's no need to be scared. I'm here and I will never let anyone harm you."
