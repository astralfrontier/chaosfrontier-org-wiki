# Gods of Eden 2005-03-01

Light. Here where there are soft fields of green grass and rolling winds of warm air, it is light. Here a young woman rests, her eyes turned up at the sky, admiring the brilliant glow of the sun. She has a long strand of grass dangling from her lips, the sweet end of it caught between her teeth.

At her side a young girl is sprawled on her belly, basking the sun. "Can we go play at the river today? There's something down there I'd like to show you," she says.

"Alright. Just as long as we're back before dark," answers the young woman. She rises, helping the little girl to her feet. The two stride over the grass, wearing nothing but the warm wind, making their way towards the river.

The little girl steps along the soft mud by the river, leading the young woman beyond. "Right around this bush," she says softly.

Stepping through the branches of the tall bush, the little girl and the young woman step out onto a balcony that looks down over a huge square. Filling it, packed as tight as they could safely be, are people. Old, young, men, women, even the ill are to be found below, looking up towards the young woman, their eyes practically glowing with hope and expectation.

"Where are we?" asks the young woman of the little girl. She looks back out over the throng, growing rather nervous with so many eyes upon her.

"Where you need to be," answers the little girl. "Don't you see how they need you?"

"They are looking so strangely at me. I don't understand. What could I give them that they would ever need?"

"Why don't you ask them?"

The young woman turns to the little girl, thinking it over. Finally, she nods and steps towards the railing. For a moment she stands there, then she flinches and turns away. "I cannot. I'm so scared!"

The little girl smiles warmly, moving to take the young woman by the hand. "You can. There is nothing to be afraid of. We're together and no one can harm us. They need you, and you love them."

The young woman nods, stepping back towards the balcony rail. She feels more flustered as the hope grows brighter in the eyes of the people below. She calls out in a timid, soft voice, "What can I do for you?"

She is answered by an eerie stillness. The disappiontment on all those faces tears at her heart, and looking around, seeing that same expression in woman and children, even in the sick, crushes her and she feels her heart break. "Please! I will do anything! I don't understand! What is it I have to do?"

"You really don't know?" asks another voice. The young woman looks to her left, and where there was noone, a strange man stands, his four arms calmly folded, save for one, which holds out a glowing, dancing light. "They want you to take this."

The young woman looks at the light, and the man who holds it, in a mixture of wonder and fear. "Why do they want me to take that? It only leads to madness."

"Does it?" asks the man. "Are you sure?"

The young woman steps away, "I.. I do not know. It scares me. If I take it, who will save them when it turns me to evil?"

Light. Here where there are soft fields of rolling, green grass stroked by warm winds, there is always light. Here a young woman lays out over the grass on her right side, her cheek resting in the safety of the little girl's lap.

The little girl's fingers stroke through the young woman's hair slowly, trying to bring comfort to her. "Do you want to play today?" asks the little girl quietly.

"Not today. I don't want to play."

"Why not?" asks the little girl.

"I wanted to help those people. But how can I help them if the only way will make me hurt them?"

"Do you really believe that?" asks the little girl, brushing the young woman's cheek with her fingertips.

"Yes."

"Then there is no way you can help them," answers the little girl.

"What are you going to do then?" asks the little girl.

"If I cannot help them, I cannot do anything," answers the young woman. She sighs softly, tightly shutting her eyes. "I cannot do anything."

"Do you really believe that?" asks the little girl. She smiles down at the young woman, continuing to brush her cheek gently.

"Yes."

"Then you really cannot do anything," answers the little girl.

"Do you understand?" asks the little girl.

"I do not understand," answers the young woman softly. "I do not understand why I am so powerless."

"Do you understand?" asks the young woman quietly. "Can you help me?"

"I understand," answers the little girl. "But I cannot help you." She combs her fingers through the young woman's hair and, bringing them back, cups the cheek of the young woman, just resting her hand there.

"Why can't you help me?" asks the young woman softly. "I can't do this alone."

"I cannot help you because I am already dead," answers the little girl softly. "And because you say those things and believe them, you cannot do them. But I am dead, and cannot help you."

The young womans sighs and shivers, moving to more tightly cuddle her cheek against the little gir's lap. "I'm afraid."

"You should never be afraid here," answers the little girl. "Here it is only light. Here is where we wait for the next sunrise. Why are you afraid?"

"I failed," answers the young woman. "I could not help those people that needed me. And I cannot help them still." She frowns and stares out over the grass. "Something is broken inside me."

"You are broken inside you," answers the little girl. "If you ever want to help them, you will have to remember why you are afraid. And you will have to stop being afraid."

"I do not know what you mean. I do not know why I was afraid."

"If you do not remember who you were, you will never know," answers the little girl. "If you do not remember why you did not believe in yourself, you can never have faith." She sighs deeply, then, just breathing for many long minutes.

"But most of all, you must remember that to love anyone else, one must first love themself." The little girl looks down at the young woman, smiling at her fondly. "Do you want to love others?" she asks.

"I do want to love others. I want to help them. I want to drive away their fears and give them comfort from the sadness of their lives," answers the young woman.

"How can you do this when there is no comfort inside you?"

"How can you drive away fears when you are afraid of yourself?"

"How you do these things when you are afraid to live?"

"You are right," says the young woman. "My desires are impossible."

"Only because you let them remain so."
