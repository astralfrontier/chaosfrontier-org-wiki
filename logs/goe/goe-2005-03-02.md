# Gods of Eden 2005-03-02

Sinking. That is the feeling one has when they are slipping off into the places between life and death. Here where everything is on the edge of a blade, there is a plane of warm grass, lit despite the perfectly black sky above.

In the midst of this plane of warm grass. In the middle of its infinite expanse, sits a bench. On this bench sits a young woman. She is not alone. Behind her stands another young woman, her head turned down, her expression one of exhaustion. Between the two young women are strings of glinting silver, looking like the dew-covered strands of a spider's web, connecting flesh to flesh. Connecting soul to soul.

Ramar falls. He falls between life and death, through the soft spaces in reality. He moves from known to unknown, tenuously remembering that he is alive, and that he must find his way back from this place. He sinks to the edge of reality, the border between consciousness and the hereafter. Just as all seems lost in an infinite plane of grey... there is a bench, and a grassy field, and two women. _There._

Silver light is the only prelude to the sudden arrival of a young man. A bright flash, almost too swift to see, and then he is there, on the bench. The young man is illuminated by a silvery outline. Here, he represents a bastion of one world, and in his presence things seem more stable, more real in their own way. The young man speaks, his voice strong, despite carrying exhaustion and worry, "Hello? There you are... I was worried I wouldn't find you."

The young woman on the bench looks up at the sound of a voice. She studies the young man for a time. "I know your face," she says calmly. "But you are not here. You aren't like the rest of us." The young girl behind her continues her solemn vigil, unmoving. She does not seem to even notice that anything has changed.

The young man regards the young girl carefully, then turns his full attention to the young woman on the bench. He smiles, finding joy in the sight of the young woman even here beyond light and shadow. "I know your face too," he says, "I... I've missed it terribly." That said, he spends an eternity just gazing, as though it was his first time seeing her... as though it was his last.

The young woman looks confused and uncomfortable. "I'm sorry," she says gently. She looks back at the one behind the bench for a time. That solemn figure nods her head and the young woman looks over to you. "You knew me." She sighs, looking like a child struggling with a particularly difficult question. "I knew your name. You were..." She sighs sadly, looking off as she thinks. "I'll get it. You don't have to tell me."

"Don't be sad, don't be sorry. You've done nothing wrong at all," speaks the young man. His voice is strong, stronger than most things here and reassuring, as though he might hold back the world with as much effort as it takes to breathe. "And my name is not important... not right now. You are more important." He turns away for a moment, teardrops sinking slowly through air that is not air, and landing upon the ground. Flowers will grow there, life has blessed it. When he turns back, "How do you feel?"

"Lonely," answers the young woman. "I feel like I've been here a very long time," she explains. "And everyone I see makes me feel so confused and sad." She stares down at her hands, both of them set in her lap, motionless. One of her fingers is different than the rest of her. It appears more solid, tangible, while the rest of her is almost ghostlike in comparison.

"You are not alone," states the young man. "You are never alone. I am here now, and when you need me, I will be here for you. I promise." He reaches out to take hold of one of her hands, they seem slightly more solid in the glow of the silver light. "Take my hand," he says gently, "You don't need to be sad."

The young woman takes hold of his hands. They feel different. She is cool to the touch, save for that one finger. "I don't need to be sad," she chants softly. Above, the darkness wheels suddenly, and lights appear, their brilliance waxing and waning. The largest can be seen as images from Gallius' life. Sad things, mostly, though a few of the smaller lights show images of joy. As those lights ebb and flow, the strands between the young woman shimmer, the dew on them flowing away from the young woman on the bench and towards the other woman. And yet the woman who stands shudders, clearly struggling, as if she were trying to move a load far too heavy for her to bear alone.

The young man squeezes her hands gently. "Please, be happy. Remember what has come before... remember me, Gallius." The name almost resonates in the air, especially around the young woman. The young man shudders, and his attention shifts to the strands of dew sliding down the silvery webbing. "This burden is not yours alone to bear," he says, "I will help you bear it, for as long as I can."

The young woman frowns thoughtfully. "Gallius," she whispers softly. "That is who I was," she murmurs. It seems to make her feel more sad. "I don't want to be Gallius." The lights swirl madly above, replaced by one larger vision, of a woman with hatred burning in her eyes, her fist glowing like the sun as her fingers squeeze slowly inwards. In her palm, slowly being rent asunder, is all of Creation.

"That is not all you were." The young man's eyes are moist with tears. He reaches out to grasp Creation in her palm. "This isn't you. Do not worry about who you were... worry more about who you are." Creation slowly begins to heal itself in her palm, and in the silvery eyes of the young man is another Gallius. The vision is not as large as the lights in the sky, but it is strong. It is real. In his eyes is Gallius as he knew her. Gallius the young woman beneath the armor, the woman he loves.

"I'm afraid," says the young woman softly. "How can I ever keep her away? Does no one else see it? She's so powerful." The young woman rises and stares at the image, "But she is dead. She was shorn away and fractured. And now I am here, between what is and what must be." The other young woman lets out a sigh, and her straining grows, the dew gliding closer still. "If she is one again, what will keep her from destroying the world?"

"I'm afraid too," says the young man. He smiles sadly, "But I am not afraid of her. I see her, but I know what she does not. For all her power, for all her hate, for all the terrible things you see in her... I know what can be done." The young man leans in close, resting his head on the young woman's shoulder. Grass stretches out slowly beneath his feet, shadows dancing in the lights up above. "I know that there is love in there." He reaches out, placing a hand over her heart. Silvery radiance streams back and forth as he does this, "That there is good in here." His voice is whisper-soft, "That is what will keep her from destroying the world."

"That love was not enough before," says the young woman. "Are you truly prepared to face that hate? Do you think you can defeat it?" She shakes her head, "It lies dead now, thankfully. But if she is whole again as some wish, what then? I know you have strong feelings for her, but is the risk of all Creation worth it for the love of two people?"

"What has happened before is not as important as what is happening now," speaks the young man. He sighs, and spends a moment just breathing. Here, beyond all things, it is relaxing, and almost easy to lose the self. "Hatred, love... these things cannot be defeated. They are as much a part of life as death itself is." He reaches a hand out towards the webbing, watching the dew warily. The young man knows more than he might let on, but he presses onwards, "But I believe that balance can be found. That hate can be restrained by love. That not all is lost to darkness. My feelings notwithstanding... I believe that anything is worth the risk for the love of two people." There is no small amount of truth to that. The young man's silvery outline flickers briefly. Perhaps he too is undertaking a risk of his own that he dare not speak of.

The young woman sighs sadly again. "You love her that much," she says. "You love him that much, as well," says the same voice. On the bench, another young woman appears. As she rises, her knees wobble and she starts to fall.

The young man reaches out with an arm to grab hold of the falling young woman. The movement is easy here, where it is not so much a matter of muscles, but a matter of will instead. Where the young woman is concerned, the young man would move heaven and earth. "Are you okay?"

The young woman smiles and nods at the young man. "I am now." He can feel how tenuous she is, as if she were a thing about to fade any moment. She looks to the silver strands, sighing. They do not reach her, and when she reaches out towards them, the other young woman exerts her will, creating a barrier. "Not for you! I thought you left with her! Both of you would strangle all that is, if I were not in your way."

"And yet, without her, you would not be who you are," observes the young man. He now holds hands with both young women, eyes looking as though he is straining, resisting something, some pull. Not yet. No. "The two of you must work with each other. You are parts of a whole, together the two of you can be stronger... you need not fade..."

"Why would I work with her?" asks the young woman so strongly resisting the silver strands. "She wants to return and risk everything. I am the only sane one left. She thinks the whole world is her child." The weak young woman sighs, relying very much on the young man for support. How she can even appear at all is questionable, her weakness making her appear as little more than a ghosting of form.

"Because if you risk nothing, you stand to gain nothing. If you risk everything, you have everything to gain." The young man shakes his head sadly, while he considers the strongly resisting woman. "You need each other. Without you, she will fall prey to excess, but without her, you will never know the joy of caring for another. You are the balance. You ensure that no one thing becomes stronger than the others... but perhaps here, you are overpowering all others."

"The others are all going mad," replies the young woman sternly. "Look at her? She's barely got the strength to take shape here. She's already letting go. How long can she hold against the madness? Why should I do all the work?" She clenches a fist, shaking her head angrily. "All I have to do is cut her off a little longer, then she'll be gone, as well."

"And if I were not in your way," replies the young man, lending his strength to the fading woman, and his heart to the strong woman, "You would strangle the world. Perhaps you too are going mad, separated from the others... please," the young man's voice is urgent, "Hear me out, indulge me for just a moment..."

"You are one of them, too," answers the young woman. "How can a madman give me advice?" She glares at the weaker girl. With her clenched fist she reaches behind her, taking hold of one of the silver strands. "You want her back. You are mad enough to risk the whole world for her."

"Perhaps. But without them, you cannot do anything. And without you, they will do too much. If you work together, you will be stronger than before. You know this. Don't be afraid. Here," the young man blinks away the tears, now he almost gasps for his breath. His knees wobble, but he does not falter. "Let me be your strength. Let me help you. If you like, you can keep me from going mad."

The young woman hesitates and considers the young man. "You are dying," she observes. She turns away for a moment. Finally she turns back, looking far from happy, "If I do as you ask, will you stop this rash action?" She turns to the woman she is connected to by the strands, "I could not stop her."

"I only ask that you let me help you. That is why I am here. I would die for you, if that is what I must do... but if you will do as I ask... I may not have to." The young man drops to one knee, and the silvery nimbus begins to grow brighter. Bright enough to give the ghost-woman a stronger shape here, where shape is more than shape, and thought and emotion hold sway over the physical. Sweat drips from his brow, and at his feet, flowers begin to grow. The buds are red as droplets of blood. "Please do not let her actions be in vain," he says to the other young woman, "You must have the strength to aid yourself, to aid her. She cannot do this alone, nor can you. That is why I am here."

"I could stop resisting her," says the young woman. "But what she is doing is going to change me to my core." Her eyes shift to Ramar, "The one you love is going to be changed. She wants to come in here." The young woman gestures to her heart. "How can I allow that? You ask me to shatter myself."

"You could. And it will. But I believe in you." The young man's voice grows a little weaker, even as the bright light begins to catch in the dewdrops on the web. It mingles with them, slowing them for a time. "I believe that no matter what the change may entail, you will still be in there. That I will still love you. That you can pull yourself back togetehr. Gallius, I love you. I love you with all my hear, all my soul. Nothing can change that, not her, not me, not even you. I ask you to allow your other voices to be heard, to maintain your balance, your life." His voice breaks, and tears stream down his face at the thought... "I ask you to remember me when all is said and done."

And with each word, there is a shift in the balance. The weak young woman whom Ramar holds grows more tangible, gathering somehow. And as she grows, the other shimmers, light in her failing as the shift continues. The weak woman stands stronger, and she is not idle. Her hand darts out like a serpent, burying itself in the chest of the resistant young woman. Out it comes with a terrible ripping sound, dragging out yet another young woman, who gasps for breath as she emerges. She staggers against the one who has drawn her out, relying on her for support.

As the balance shifts, the light grows stronger. It is gathered on the webs and coalesces around the young man once more. He remembers. He is Ramar. He knows once again where he is, and why the bloodflowers at his feet have bloomed. Ramar stands taller, stronger. He walks to the other young woman, offering her his hand, his support. No one should have to bear this burden themselves. "Now then, she cares enough to save herself from death, and is fighting to free you." There is a glow now, one of gold and silver upon his brow. "She cannot do this by herself though. Her strength is not enough to endure. Will you lend her yours?"

The young woman who was just drawn from the resistance accepts the help of both her rescuer and Ramar. "I believe I am Gallius," she says, looking to her rescuer. "I believe in the power of love," she says firmly. She grows brighter still, turning to face the resistant. She reaches out, clamping her hands over the hands of the resistant, "I believe you will not stop me, now." The rescuer strides forward, reaching out with a trembling hand for the silver strands. She plucks one free, settling it in her flesh. For a moment, it trembles, fragile, and then it glows brilliantly, flooding with light. The solemn woman lets out a gasp, and she grows more faint still. The rescuer seizes more strands, settling them in herself and in the one who was rescued, until all three have an equal number of them.

Ramar smiles... he nearly collapses, catching himself on the bench. It takes him a few moments, but the sight of Gallius becoming stronger, the sight of the three women sharing the strands rather than fighting each other, of her soul becoming stronger lessens his burden. No longer does he strain under an unseen weight. "I know you are Gallius," he says, walking forward, embracing the three of them, silvery light traveling along the strands, easing the burden of the young woman who has struggled with this for so long. "You are not alone. I am here. When you need me, I will be here for you. I love you Gallius."

The resistant is not joining this. Not without more of a fight. She glares at the strands that stil are buried in her, fighting them still. The solemn woman shudders at the backlash, still struggling against that strength. "You are always controlling," says the resistant. "Always cowing me. I wanted to protect the world from you. I wanted us to leave together. You have left me no choice but to call upon her." And the resistant warps in shape, her skin warping, bulging as boils and lacerations shatter and scar her flesh. Large clumps of her hair fall out, taking with them bits of flesh from her head as they fall. "Only I can stop her!" says the resistant, her words punctuated with a shriek of agony as her limbs shift, the bones of her fingers somehow growing longer until their ends shatter her tormented flesh.

"No!" Ramar cries out as the resistant girl begins to shatter. "You are not the only one who can stop her..." Silver radiance slides down the strands, until the young woman who has been struggling this whole time is outlined as well. Here beyond all things, where Essence is at the very core, Ramar walks between shadow and light. He is by the young woman's side in an instant. "You need not do this alone. Let me help you... your greatest task is now at hand. This battle must be won. Your courage must shine through. Let me help you as well."

Rumika's daughter looks up at Ramar. "I will not fail," she says softly. "I must enter the matrix now." She touches Ramar gently, and his perception widens. There are more than silver strands. Now what was hidden is open to him. Golden strands, far finer than any weave of essence Ramar has likely seen before, twine about the hideous resistant, tightly coupling it with both of the young women who stand against it. But there are still more golden strands, drawing out from Rumika's daughter and standing ready, on the very brink of chopping away at the resistant. And yet she herself is bound in golden strands, and in Ramar's vision it is clear that they must be cut.

"And I know what I must do." Ramar nods slowly. Never before has he been so assured of his purpose, of what it is he must do, is meant to do. It is all at once terrifying and relieving. And here, where life and death hang in the balance of every word, such sensations are heightened. He must endure. He must overcome. The Solar seems to grow. Here, Essence is everything, and Ramar's will begins to take a fiercer shape. Above the sky lights dance and swirl, and there is an image of Ramar as he is, surrounded in the light of his anima. There's something strange about it though, something that fluctuates. It's as though he's changing everything. Below, on the field of grass, the earth rises around the resistant, shimmering as Ramar stretches his hands out. With a shout, rocks and grass and dirt shatter, and they hang in the air, energy arcing through them.

Suddenly they explode with fiery radiance. Gold and Silver light mingle with each other, and they are shot through with a brilliant red and purple that begins to burn away at the strands that the resistant, that the aberrant creates. Ramar walks forward, unhindered by such threads. Twice the resistant tries to ensnare him with her strands, to bind his soul up in this process... yet the strands burn away with light and fire. He gathers reality around him, and his wil is focused on rebirth. On renewal... on Gallius. His hands cut through golden strings, and the shattered Essence now unwoven he gathers around him, focusing it, using it to bolster Rumika's daughter, to bolster those who do not resist.

Courage. Restraint. These are foremost in Ramar's mind as he concentrates on shattering the resistance. "Your darkness has no hold here... what must be done will be done." Around him, severd strands of Essence swirl... their purpose is reshaped according to Ramar's direction. Now they lash out, slicing through the ground, isolating the resistant from the others. "Now..." The strands disperse, becoming a glowing cloud of light that envelops Rumika's daughter. Ramar holds out one hand, tracing a slow pattern through the air. "BEGONE!" The air around Ramar shimmers, becoming a sphere of water with Ramar at its center. Through it, all energy in the universe is channeled, through it, through Ramar. The stuff of life and dreams, of death and darkness... and though the strain is great, Ramar endures. The water evaporates, taking the resistant with it, freeing her from this tortured existence.

Then his attention turns toward Rumika's daughter. She too is bound up tightly in the golden strands, and must be unbound. He reaches out, severing her ties, and though it pains him to do this to someone as loving as she... he knows why it must be done. When at last he finishes, he grasps gold and silver threads, tying them together, foerver linking the two souls... courage and restraint, compassion and strength. When at last he finishes, he sinks to the ground, barely able to move.

And slowly the weave tightens, the old bonds carried away by a soft breeze. Two parts of Rumika's daughter fall into the darkness, but what remains bonds true, and love, courage, reserve, and faith step slowly closer, until there are not four there, but just one that is all of them. The young woman curls up on the warm grass, flowers blooming about her, and drifts into a deep sleep. There is much healing to do yet, but the greatest danger of all is passed.

With one last effort, Ramar stands, and moves beside Gallius. He collapses beside her, resting on the warm grass, amid flowers... "Gallius my love... you're safe," he says with no small amount of relief. Exhaustion overcomes him then, he can fight it no more, and the Solar falls asleep beside Gallius, holding her tightly for he knows he will be gone before she truly is awake again.
