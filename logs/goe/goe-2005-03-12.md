# Gods of Eden 2005-03-12

Days have crawled by lazily around the little house near the Singing Mountain of Dancing Fires. Days during which the young woman known now as Egress has become almost fully aware of herself now. Only a few things remain to be taught. The young man, Ramar, is here as always. Though this time he seems to be almost giddy about something. "So, do you know what today is, Egress?"

Egress is calm. She looks up at Ramar, smiling a little at his excitement. "I imagine you would be terribly disappointed if I guessed correctly," she murmurs. "So you ought to just tell me."

Ramar laughs softly, "No, I don't think I would be disappointed at all... but, today, at last, we shall go out into the world." He pauses a moment, gauging her reaction carefully, "If you're ready for it, that is."

Egress hmms. "Well, where out into the world would you like to go?" she asks curiously. "I am ready to go a ways, but it's a very long walk to a village. Mother made sure to keep us as remote as possible."

"Anywhere you like. For though it is a long walk to a village... we won't be walking." Ramar's smile broadens, "I know that you can walk, Egress, and I have greatly enjoyed our walks together, but it's time to fly!"

"I may have feathers, Ramar, but I cannot fly," says Egress. She laughs softly and pokes Ramar in the chest, "Or do you mean to carry me on some strange ship of yours? You know, I haven't flown at all since I came here."

"Ah. Well then that is something that we shall have to fix." Ramar staggers back once he's poked though, doing his best to look winded. "I have brought a Volo, and I thought that we might try it. I uhm, well, it's been some time since I've flown myself...not since y...Gallius' last flight."

"So you are going to carry me on this volo of yours?" asks Egress. "You had best not pinch me, or I'll have to do something about it." She giggles a bit and takes Ramar by the hand, "Let's go!"

"The thought hadn't crossed my mind," replies Ramar, as he makes for the volo. "Until now that is." The alabaster bird is hidden just out of sight, in a hatch underneath the little house. He spends a moment attuning himself to the statue, and it folds around him as he speaks to it. He embraces Egress tightly, for safety of course, and pinches her just as the Volo soars into the air, headed for the clouds above. "So where shall we go?"

Egress yips and laughs. "I don't know. I want to see people today." She smiles and looks to the south, "Let's just fly high and see what we can see. I don't want to go into the cities yet, though. Not until I'm completely ready."

"Then we shall see what we can see." The volo soars high abov the surrounding land, piercing through clouds as the two Solars take to the skies. Beneath them, the ground becomes a patchwork of green and brown and blue, with roads breaking up the pattern every now and then. In the distance, mountains loom, watching and waiting.

Egress looks down over the land with wide eyes. "So where are we now?" she asks quietly. She rests her head against Ramar, watching the ground move with a smile. "It's really pretty from up here, isn't it? Looks so quiet and peaceful."

"We are heading towards the Yellow River. It's a sight to see from above... the water just carves through the land..." As Ramar speaks, they cross over a smaller forest, the trees seem to sway beneath them. "And it's very pretty from up here... you can see everything for miles around. The horizon doesn't seem so distant, and whatever may be beyond it feels within reach."

Egress nods thoughtfully. She looks over the wide waters thoughtfully. "The Nation of the Sun is vast, isn't it? The maps don't really give you a clear picture of things. And the memories are a bit muddled. Things are foggy, I guess."

"It is vast, in its own way." The Volo soars over the wide wide river, which threatens to blot out the land on either side. Ramar guides the volo into a steep dive, zooming towards the water and then at the last moment skimming over its surface for a ways. As they rise once more, he adds, "I'll help you to make things not quite as muddled..."

"It's not so bad," says Egress. "I'll just make my own memories, now. They are very clear, I've found. Things have changed. This body somehow is more aware. I can't really explain it, though. I can see and feel so many things, Ramar."

Ramar asks, "What do you see, what do you feel?"

"Life," says Egress quietly. "And I feel so happy and relaxed. I could just float here and watch for hours. But I see things so much better. Everything has a greater clarity to me."

At last, they have passed the mighty river. The volo turns in the air, swooping back around, headed this time for the mountains-now a pale shadow barely peeking over the horizon. "I'm glad to hear that," says Ramar softly. "You deserve that, at the very least, and so much more. Thank you for coming with me."

"It's my pleasure," says Egress. She looks to the mountains, frowning in thought. "I assume there is no surprise of the unpleasant sort at the top of that mountain?" she asks. "I like what I am now. I don't wish to give the Wyld another chance."

"No... no unpleasant surprises at the top of that mountain." Here, the word unpleasant is emphasised. Ramar chuckles softly, "And I like what you are now as well. You're Wyld enough, I think."

Egress shuts her eyes, resting in Ramar's arms. "Just remember that I'm not supposed to climb mountains too much now. Rumika is still a little jittery about my condition. I'm afraid I've worn her nerves a great deal over the past month or two."

"Well, that's only to be expected." Ramar laughs, and the volo draws nearer and nearer to the mountain. By this time, the sun is beginning the last half of its journey through the sky. "I'll be surprised if she's any left by the time you're through."

"She'll be okay," says Egress softly. "She's recovering from a lot, as well. But at least she and I have figured things out for ourselves. I have a mother to scold me now and she has a daughter. It makes me feel good."
