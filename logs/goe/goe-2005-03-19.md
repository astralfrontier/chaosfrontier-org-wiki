# Gods of Eden 2005-03-19

It is a day like any other in much of the world, but for Egress, the 21st day of Descending Fire is a very important one. She awakens when the first rays of the sun climb into her room. Standing before her is a familiar face. A woman with eyes and hair like fire is settled against the plain dresser of the solar's room. "Good morning, Egress," she says softly. "I hope you have rested well."

Egress rubs at her eyes, then has to cover a yawn as she sits up in her bed. "I could barely sleep," she admits softly. "Today is such a big day. I'm a bit nervous. There are really all those people there?" asks the Zenith.

Rain of Fire-for that is the name of the woman with eyes like fire-nods her head. "Indeed, there are many people there, and they all will be very happy to see you. They have been on the brink of mourning for a long time. It is time to reward their hope, wouldn't you agree?"

Egress sighs softly. "I still do not know what I can do for them, but I will do all I can. I know I want them to be happy. I remember always wanting that, but there always seemed to be something in the way."

Rain of Fire just smiles at Egress, her eyes shifting to watch the doorway just before Rumika enters. "She isn't dressed yet?" Rumika asks. "Come on, girl! We've a long way to go and your bed isn't going to get you there! Up, up!"

The dressing is done in a whirlwind, as Rumika and Rain of Fire work together to dress Egress properly. She is given a fine, white blouse of linen, with a blue skirt cut for riding. After she is dressed, Egress eats a proper breakfast, prepared by a local woman named Six Smiles. A very kindly woman, at that, and her chatter helps Egress feel less troubled, bringing a smile to the Zenith's face.

Egress finds herself atop Rain of Fire, with Rumika at her back, the Night Caste holding her daughter a bit more tightly than is perhaps strictly necessary. The journey is not a long one on such a swift steed, and soon the trio are settled down outside of Bridal Veil. Rain of Fire cannot travel in stealth, so the landing draws the usual attention when she returns. The people cannot help but associate her with their heroic Solar leaders. The facts of recent history have neatly shifted, so that the Anathema who bring doom to their people become the Light Bringers who would gladly die so that their people may live safe and free from darkness.

Which is true and which is not is a matter of faith. A matter of how one perceives the facts. But more still, it is a matter of the feelings of those heroes towards their people. Seeing them call out in joy at Rain of Fire, Egress cannot help but feel love in her heart. The people outside the city tend to be pilgrims or farmers, and many of them gather around to cheer for Rumika, whom they call the Healing Grandmother (a name which she has some misgivings about at times) and Rain of Fire, who needs no other title. What does one need to say about a dragon who can cast yeddim aside and lay low squadrons of enemies with a whip of her tail?

But Egress they are unsure of. They have never seen a woman with hair of pink and gold. The mark upon her brow they have seen. Other Solars who have come to the Nation bear the mark of the Zenith, as well as their wounded queen. Yet none of those who came bore that mark and a tail. The tail of a lioness. It is perhaps the fact that they are faithful and even somewhat naive that these people can so swiftly come to just one conclusion. There's a sudden silence as the people stand there, stunned. Then almost as one they rush forward, the whole crowd dropping to their knees about the zenith and her friends.

Egress looks from Rain of Fire to Rumika, not sure what to do. "Please rise," she says softly. "There is no need for this. I think there is a mistake." As she looks around, she catches the eyes of a young man, surely no more than a dozen summers old. As she speaks, she is caught by those eyes, and by the strength of faith she encounters in them.

The young man rises, shaking his head. It is a woman near him that calls out, though. Her dress is dusty from much travel. Surely here is one of the Messengers, those inspired people who go from place to place spreading the word of the Solars. "We are not mistaken, my Queen. Your crown others may wear, but the tail of the Lioness marks you as the one who shall sit upon the throne. We have wished and prayed for this for so long." The young boy, having no clear idea what to add, just cries out, "Yeah!"

Egress faces this alone. Rumika cannot help her beyond what she has. Rain of Fire will always stand beside her, but this choice belongs to the Zenith. She said she wanted to help them. She has sworn so many times that she would care for these people. Now she finds that they are asking her to do the one thing she fears. But she is the merging of not one person, but two souls, both of whom had great strength. It is with all her virtues that she speaks. "I am no longer Gallius Leom," she calls out. She leaves little pause before saying, "I am simply Egress, and I have no spear, no shining armor. I have passed through fire and darkness, skirted the edges of Oblivion, and I swore to love and protect you. This I have not always done as well as I should have. I have not served my people as they deserved. I promise now to care for your as my children, if you wish. Do you wish for me to become Queen Egress?"

The crowd roars out far louder than their numbers would seem to allow. "YES!" The little boy laughs for joy, turning to hug the woman at his side. Egress turns to Rumika and Rain of Fire, then. "I must go into Bridal Veil. I hope Marina will meet me there." Rumika smiles a knowing smile and Rain of Fire just automatically moves to follow Egress, a full pace behind, on the left of the queen. Opposite her is Rumika. Followed by the people they march to Bridal Veil, and along the way still more people see the procession. Hearing from others what has happened, wonder and joy fills them. Forgetting the day's tasks, they too join and so with a growing following Egress enters the first city of the Nation of the Sun.

The city grinds to halt as the word spreads like wild fire. The Queen has returned! The palace of Bridal Veil is not caught off-guards, however. Dace has been summoned, and with him stands the Panther and Koriko. All have their weapons drawn and held at the ready. Opposite them stands Marina, flanked with several of the highest ranking officials in the land. Yet that is not all. Just past those two groups stands the Nation of the Sun herself, her expression neutral as she watches Egress approach.

Egress comes to a stop and the crowd behind her falls silent, watching with baited breath. What will come to pass now?

Those at the palace say nothing. For a time Egress just watches them. She steps forward alone. As one, the Solars on her right raise their drawn weapons, barring her path. "Who are you that we should let you pass?" they demand sternly.

Egress answers without breaking her stride, "I am Egress of the Nation of the Sun. I am the Chosen of Helios and the Chosen of the people." She meets the eyes of the warriors, "I ask for you to heed the will of the people." As one, the weapons are raised in a salute. Dace's strong voice answers, "Lady Egress of the Zenith Caste may pass."

The officials by Marina stir, but she silences them with a sharp gesture. "Lady Egress of the Zenith Caste may pass," she says solemnly. But she cannot help but smile, seeing her friend returning at last. The questions in her eyes will have to wait, though, for the Nation of the Sun awaits, still watching without expression.

The Nation of the Sun considers Egress calmly. "You are changed," she says calmly. "Once you and I were allies, but between us there was much distance. I hope that the gulf between us will be far less now," she says. With a smile she intones, "Egress is Queen of the Nation of the Sun."

Queen Egress embraces the Nation of the Sun, then, a gesture the god clearly did not expect. She returns it with a soft laugh, "I did not expect my Queen to close the gulf quite so swiftly," she says. Egress then draws away, turning back to her people. "Today is a day for joy," she calls out. "But there is much to be done! Let this warmth in our heart light a fire of renewal in us all!" And the Queen does not simply go to her throne. She instead walks out among her people, and for the rest of the day, lends her words and guidance to all those who need her.

From Bridal Veil the word spreads. Some say the queen has been reborn, others say she has returned. No, she rose from the dead. Others say her ghost came forward and was given flesh. But along all these stories, the most important truth is held: the Nation of the Sun's Queen has returned, and her name is Egress, and the people have chosen to call her the Ascending Lioness.
