# Gods of Eden 2005-03-20

The trio of Solars find themselves standing just inside the tendrils of mist. The heat from Rain of Fire can no longer be felt. The Solars feel themselves stretch out, no longer seeing or hearing in the way they would normally do, but instead relying on their sense of essence itself.

Even as Davron reaches out to touch his fellow circlemates the mist shifts ahead of the Solars and a glowing figure can be seen. It's voice is deep and strong and it asks, "Heart or Body?" Its sentence is punctuated by a flash of light and followed by the gloomy rumble of thunder.

Chi-Yosh turns to the others. With unruly spirits, might makes right. Lacking respect, feeling invulnerable, they have forgotten the natural place of the spirits in Creation's great web. While the Dawn would prefer to prove the Circle's power through the solidity of their character, it is more swift and lasting to resort to the physical. After looking at his fellows a moment, the Dawn turns back towards the voice. "Body."

Davron looks into the mist, and shivers. Normally, his response would be clear - but his mind and heart have been so consumed with works of artifice intended to save his Circlemate that he finds himself unable to face the challenge with his usual stout heart. He nods to Chi-Yosh in agreement, flexing his fingers.

"Body it is," agrees Ramar. He looks around the mist, tensing slightly with the anticipation of things to come. His mind is elsewhere, that much is certain. In his heart he's still beside Gallius, watching over her, tending her. Perhaps this choice is for the best.

"So be it," answers the spirit. Again, its words are punctuated with a flash of lightning and the jarring rumble of thunder as air is superheated. As the sound fades, so does the figure. The mist about the Solars rolls back, leaving what at first seems to be an empty darkness, but as it grows, the distant light of stars can be sensed in all directions.

Even for a challenge of the body, Davron relies greatly on his mind. His anima flares about him as he begins to shape the pattern of the Invulnerable Skin of Bronze; if his body is going to be in danger, he will protect it as best he can.

If the choice is the Body, Chi-Yosh will prepare for whatever may come. He pushes inwards, before the channeling power fans outwards throughout him, Essence boiling and spreading over the limbs. Fingers flex. He is strong for the challenge, whatever may come.

Essence rises behind Ramars eyes, sharpening the sight. The rest of the senses compete with each other to accomodate this heightened sense, each one in turn rising to a supernatural sharpness. The Solar focuses slowly on each sense, breathing slowly, preparing for what comes next.

As the Solars wait, little seems to change at first. Time seemingly passes, but here it's hard even for the Exalted to know just how much. Between one moment, which may or may not be a while later, and the next, which is certainly a short time later, three shapes rise from the darkness, standing against it as nearly amorphous shapes of flowing silver. They resolve themselves into slightly more normal forms, having appendages resembling arms and legs.

The three are set about the Solars, surrounding them. While at first each bore no weapon, the readiness of their foes seems to give their own forms more reality, and the silver forms shift, so that one bears kamas of silver, another a powerbow, and the last a blade. As one, they swiftly close the distance between themselves and their foes.

As the silver kama bearer strikes, it is immediately obvious to Chi-Yosh that he faces less than a mirror of himself. The foe is swift, though, even if it's use of the weapons is far less controlled than the Dawn as it lashes out wildly at his chest.

Chi-Yosh dives inside his opponent's reach, forearm driving upwards into the offending wrist to eat the brunt of the savage slice. Then he unfolds, twisting smoothly to scoop the arm up in an elbow, pivoting his weight.

With the senses now heightened, Ramar can track the motion of his opponent. He sees the patterns in the advance, in the heft of the muscles. He knows where his opponent may strike, and so in turn he concentrates on his body. His awareness raises to the point where he can feel the pull of every muscle inside of him, his body acquiring a supernatural fluidity. Now, mind and body will be in concert.

The silvery form that stalks Ramar raises it's blade. The attack comes in as a low sweep, but the dashing form is merely feigning, and midway it stabs upward at Ramar's chest.

Davron dare not stop the casting, but he does hasten it as much as the ancient ritual allows. A faint sigh of relief accompanies the final words of the spell, and with a ringing clang Davron's skin is transmuted, the better to withstand whatever attacks may come.

The silvery feint does not go unnoticed. As the blade rises for his chest, the force of the blow precedes it, announcing its presence. As the air pushed aside by this energy strikes Ramar in the chest, his body flows with it. He pinwheels his arms backward, planting them on nothingness as he turns his heels in the air, legs bending around the blade. When the blow has passed, Ramar is standing once more, sword turned towards his foe.

The form that attacks Davron seems to be the most primitive of all. Yet its speed and strength is incredible. The silver form swings the bow like a club, aiming its blow squarely at Davron's head.

Freed now from the concentration of the spell, Davron's feet move of their own accord, leaping backward, then sideways, his body ducking and weaving instinctively. He can't tell how sturdy that bow of mist might be, but whatever it is, he feels he will be the better for not being struck with it.

Chi-Yosh steps back, bleeding slightly from the successful score. He takes a moment to study the silvery opponents, noting their relative power. Rather than lash out insufficiently, without a defense, the Solar begins to flex metaphysical muscles as the steps through the Art of the Four Magical Metals begins. Each motion through draws him higher, in a tight spiral around his opponent, climbing higher through the nothingness until with the glitter off of the orichalcum sheen of his skin, the Solar crouches down, and beckons the silver thing with a hand.

As the essence flows out from the Solars, the keen senses of Ramar grasp something that is beyond easy sight. The normal way in which essence is dispersed and drawn-in is shifted here, so that the motion of energy draws power through the silver forms.

The silver swordsman pauses for a moment, almost as if it were studying its foe. It is a very fleeting study, however, as the form goes from watching to striking with a terrible suddenness.

_So they draw from our strength. Our Essence. Interesting._ Ramar shifts his stance just slightly as the silver swords man makes his lunge. He ducks one way, his body screaming out his intentions, his every movement putting him in line with his foe. With a cry at the last second, Ramar springs, his body turning in nothingness and his feet coming down atop the swordsman's blade.

Davron winces as the heavy blow bludgeons his innards, and narrows his eyes at the silvery form. Deciding to wait and gain the measure of his foe before committing himself further, he somersaults backward, and looses a single arrow at the strange enemy, then lowers himself into a defensive crouch, prepared to spring away from the counterattack.

The silver bow both moves and shifts inside itself to avoid the blow. It hurls itself backwards, flattening like a pool of water against the 'ground'. With a springing motion it flows up into the air, landing some five paces farther from Davron.

"They draw strength from our Essence! Don't give it to them!" As Ramar shouts this, he slides along his foe's blade, thrusting outward with the tip of his sword. He uses the momentum of this lunge to carry his body over the point of impact, somersaulting over his foe and planting his feet on the small of the silver being's back. His blade flashes as he pushes off with his feet, slicing behind him. The blade curves around in an elaborate arc, and as Ramar turns to face his foe the blade comes a mere inch in front of it, stopping briefly at chest height before the Solar stabs forward.

The silvery form meets the first two attacks with the incredible speed Ramar has come to expect of it, but it is not fast enough. The last blow of Ramar's slips just past the defenses of his foe and finds the hide of his foe. The silver form shimmers and where it was struck a golden light spills out.

The kama-bearer lashes out at Chi-Yosh in futile rage. Its blow strikes home against the unmoving Dawn, but for all the power behind them, the blow rings harmlessly off the strength of the defenses.

The silver swordsman continues to glow gold from that wound, but the light pouring from it gathers about its blade, and with even greater power than last time the blade lashes out. The swordsman leaps and twirls, the motion adding still more speed and force to the swings that sing as they chop through the air.

It all comes down to intersecting paths of Essence, of power and motion. The silver foe twirls through the lack of air, sword chopping, though Ramar can track the arc of the being's jump, and has moved to confound the first attack. It's made awkwardly, though that does little to detract from the strength. Still, Ramar moves his blade, swinging it upwards in a path just slightly unparallel with the path of his opponent's blade. Sparks ring out as orichalcum strikes silver, and the force of the attack is redirected along either blade. The Solar dodges back at this same moment, using the strength of his opponent to push him backwards and over his foe's second attack.

The silver bow seems to learn something from its foe. It raises its bow and draws back on the silver string, letting two arrows fly at Davron.

Davron's brow furrows. _What are these things?_ he asks himself as he ducks and rolls, wondering if the thing is going to learn his ways of evasiveness as well. Letting his instincts carry his body in a frantic attempt to avoid the things, he wonders if it would be worth it to expend Essence in an attempt to strike them down in one blow, before they can feed on it...

Despite Davron's evasiveness, the silvery arrows find their mark, piercing his orichalcum armor and even his magical skin. In desperation, the symbol of Twilight flares on his brow, and his anima hardens, forming one last barrier against the attack - and this one successful.

Chi-Yosh is there, reflecting light in the nothingness like a single star winking in the night. Copper wire snaps through the darkness as he leaps, and for a moment the star is there again before the orichalcum lightning blasts into the silver creature. Rebounding off his opponent, arching back through the air, to return with a second lash of the foot into the kama-wielding entity.

While solid as iron, fused with the magics of the master of the misty woods, the silver creature is turned mallable like hot butter by the precise fury of the Sidereal Arts. The first strike melts it with the heat of Essence boiling inside, turning the creature a glittering, amorphous blob. The second strike pops the construct like a bloated balloon, sending warm splatters of silver throughout the cosmos battlefield. A miasma of raw power is unleashed into the air, swirling like a Wyld-borne tornado before consuming Chi-Yosh. The Solar draws the Essence in, invigorated, blazing like Helios in the dead of night.

As Davron recovers from the attack and prepares to return fire, he calls out, "Everyone take the same one!" He takes in the tactical situation, admiring the style and grace with which Chi-Yosh dispatches his opponent, and adds, "Ramar's! It'll go down quicker!"

The destruction of one of the three does not appear to weaken the others. Instead, they swell, growing far larger, until they stand a good four paces tall. The bladesman attacks in a flurry, first with a collosal swing straight down, then with a lunge forward, trying first to chop into Ramar, and then to stab him.

As the silver swordsman grows in height, Ramar springs into action. As soon as his foe draws back for his first swing, the Solar dashes forward, running up the front of his foe and kicking off, his leap carrying him above the path of the first swing. His sword strikes into nothingness as he balances atop the hilt, vaulting up as the gigantic silver sword is thrust his way. He tries to land on the hilt of the sword, to gain some height on his foe...

The chop of the sword cuts through the air and impacts against Ramar, though his armor turns the worst of it aside. As he falls, he manages to gain footing on the hilt of his sword, just in time to avoid the second thrust.

Revigorated by the surge of returned Essence, Chi-Yosh turns his sights upon Ramar's giant with new confidence. He braces, and leaps through the emptiness. For a moment, he is there, then not - the Silver creation jars, a ripple coursing through the metallic bulk, before the Dawn settles into stillness behind the foe, his orichalcum skin coated with flecks of silver, leaving behind a boared hole in the metallic behemoth.

The blow of Chi-Yosh is not so fatal this time, sending the large silver blade backwards, it's parry fast, but far from fast enough, thwarted by the potency of the martial artist's attack. The blow fractures its shell, and all about it seams in the silver can be seen, golden light pouring from them all.

The weakening of the silver blade has no effect on the silver bow. It draws with its usual calm, firing a barrage of arrows at its likeness, only this time, it is clear that the silver form is actually using the essence it has absorbed.

Davron doesn't even have time to pull an arrow from his quiver before the enemy sends more silvery darts his way. "Damnation!" he calls, more out of emotional frustration than anything else - in his rational heart, he knows that keeping his foe busy, keeping it from attacking the Dawn martial artist so that he can practice his deadly art, is contribution enough. Calling out derisively to his own foe, he somersaults, does handstands in mid-air, and leaps back the way he'd come, his golden boots finding purchase on nothing. This time, he takes the risk of using his own magic to aid his actions, his erratic motions ensuring that the giant silvery statue must concentrate its utmost simply to pierce him, even if his magic does feed it somewhat.

Whatever the flaring of Davron's anima banner may mean for the foe's power, at least this time he escapes unscathed. Two of the arrows whistle harmlessly through the darkness, while the third glances off his armor, leaving a scratch but little more.

Red begins to pool on Ramar where the silver sword had struck home moments before. His blade almost glitters in the soft golden radiance spilling from the giant's wounds. A single ruby droplet falls towards the ground just as the Solar leaps toward the silver giant, kicking the hilt of his sword as he does. The blade spins fiercely through nothingness, the droplet of blood creases in there center, then splits mere moments before the sword slashes through it and the silver giant, sending the blood skyward as the hilt of the sword flies into Ramar's waiting hands. A second slash at the peak of Ramar's leap sets the droplets spinning towards nothingness. Nothingness becomes the golden surface of Ramar's sword. The drops fall on the flat of the blade, moving fluidly as its twirled into position for one final stab. Twin drops of red become gold as they streak along the blade's path, impacting against the silver giant. Ramar falls.

Another pinprick of gold opens up on the silver giant, just barely scratching next to one of the deep gouges. Ramar shouts, "Davron... uhm... I think it's up to you now..."

Chi-Yosh turns towards the still-towering giants. Up curls his arms, taking up the posture of the Mantis. He begins to sway slowly, like a wind-caught leaf, but after a few moments, the Solar begins to flicker in and out from the building speed. And in an instant, the body stops, and the limbs continue, unfolding in either direction like orichalcum threads threshing wheat blessed with Luna. Essence pulses down the lashing limbs, before flaring like violet flowers over the rended silver.

Both towering silver behemoths turn towards the Dawn as he begins, and they prepare to defend themselves. Chi-Yosh reaches out to touch them, the bladed giant's blade rises to strike the blow down - and half of the sword falls to the ground. It then parts, falling like felled trees to melt into the nothingness. The second is left sagging, a great swath melted throuhg its form and leaving the giant dripping like a top-heavy candle after a long night of burning. Once more the miasma of energy rushes up the path to Chi-Yosh.

The silver bow reels from the attack, knocked backwards by the force. Yet it is not a solid thing, and it simply reforms, taking aim against Davron. It's power is shaken, perhaps, but its aim is strong. It first three arrows, taking aim at each of its attackers, and every shot pulses with all the energy left in the air.

The arrow sears through the air, towards Ramar. The Solar's blade catches the reflection of the arrow as the Eclipse pushes off from it in mid-flight, sending it clattering harmlessly to the ground-for lack of a better word. The golden light leaping from the already horribly maimed giant now gathers around Ramar's sword. He strikes downward, hitting the hilt of his sword, sending it flying into the giant. As he falls past the silver creature, he grabs his sword, slices, then spins around once more with a wicked slash.

Davron is tired of running. He simply lets the arrow thud into him, and grits his teeth as the thing pierces through - but his indomitable armor still blunts most of the blow. Ignoring the blood seeping through his bronze skin, he draws two arrows, and looks up at the argent monstrosity. "You're going down..." he hisses, before drawing and firing in two lightning-swift motions.

And as those two last shots drive home, the silvery statue explodes in a burst of gleaming golden Essence, sending shivering globs of silver in all directions and bathing everyone in a soft warm light.

Far more happens then just that, though. The Solars suddenly find themselves back in the wood. The mist that clung all about them is retreating, drawing back into the earth as if the ground were drawing in a deep breath.

In the midst of the solars is a familiar sight. The onyx-eyed elemental is there, standing still as its element. "Wait wait," it says blandly, staring dully off into the center of the forest.

The waiting is apparently what is expected of the Solars. A voice calls out, though its source can't be detected even by Ramar's brilliant sight. "So you found my little prison, eh? Well, if you expect me to kneel for you, you are mad! I didn't bow to your kind before and I sure won't start now!"

"We are not asking you to kneel for us, to bow for us," says Ramar. "You must be Silent Wind Through Dry Leaves. We're here to ask you to not send elementals, or otherwise endanger those in our Nation."

Chi-Yosh settles upon the mossy grass, cross-legged. "And you would be mad, passing up the opportunity to escape your prison."

"You broke the prison. They are gone, now," answers the voice. It seems to come from another direction, now. "You can't stop me from getting out, this time! Silent Wind will stalk the world again!" The voice laughs loudly, then. "You did what nobody else could, however, and so perhaps I should give you each one thing that was lost."

"You have been lost to the world for some time," says Chi-Yosh to the forest. "The world has changed around you. You find yourself in the Nation of the Sun, the entire East is under the sway of our power. You will not be lost long to the eyes of the united Solars - we could contain you again. In a worse prison." The Solar picks up a fallen leaf, inspecting it. "We could do a lot of things - the Solar are a little bitter after being beaten down so long. But if you come out and talk to us, I'm sure a better bargain can be found."

The voice falls silent for a time, but the malice in the spirit can be felt. "A worse prison!?" is blurts out, and suddenly it can be seen. Silent Wind appears as a short woman with hair of blue that shifts endlessly in an unseen wind. "I have been here countless years, trapped by those three while all around me the world faded! Only one thing connected me to the world, and its mind was consumed by Them!" She gestures to the elemental, which just stands there, staring back. "Who are you to condemn me further? I demand to have my case heard!"

"Who are you to condemn yourself," retorts the Dawn. "You wish to go right back into Creation and go back to whatever it was that you were bottled up for, yes?" The Solar stands. "If you wish to truelly be heard, then please, speak your right. But," a gesture to Ramar, "Allow us to see your words as they are."

On cue, Ramar bows his head to the spirit, the Gold within Gold mark on his brow lighting up. The filmy light fluctuates on his brow, "Indeed. Perhaps we can find reason at the heart of this matter."

The spirit turns to face Ramar as one might expect a person to regard a particularly poisonous serpent that suddenly appears in their lap. "I might have known.. always coming with trouble." She looks about herself, appearing ready to run, even taking a few hurried steps that slam her into the form of Rain of Fire. The god of Renewal stumbles back, glaring angrily at the other spirit. Rain of Fire turns her attention elsewhere, however. She calls out to the Solars, "I noticed things change, and wanted to be sure you were alright. I didn't know you were.. occupied." Though Rain of Fire claimed to not know Silent Wind, there is certainly no shortage of disgust in her tone.

"We are alright," answers Ramar. He turns to the wayward spirit, "So... I believe you were thinking of the benefits of sitting down and talking things out with us, instead of running, as someone guilty of terrible crimes would do."

Davron pulls an arrow from his quiver in an ostentatiously too-casual. "Indeed. If you want your case heard, Silent Wind, why do you flee?" He shakes his head. "We _are_ willing to be merciful, though."

The spirit recoils from Rain of Fire. This just seems too much like a set-up. "Why did you come here? If you wanted to stop the elemental, you could have destroyed it. Why did you break my prison?" She turns her glare on Chi-Yosh again. "You! What do you want from me?"

Chi-Yosh regards the spirit for some time. "I want your service. Not from your knees, as a slave, but as an expert at what it is you do. You may use those skills that you possess, in assistance to me, at desired targets. Consider it a transition from prison to freedom, under a watchful eye of your personal officer. If you serve me well, I will set you free."

The spirit hesitates for a moment, looking first at the Solars, and then to Rain of Fire. She cannot help but put two and two together using the only mathematics she understands. "Fine, but you better not coup me up in some box. I have the right to move around a bit, you know. And I can't do my job if you bottle me up!"

She looks to the Eclipse warily. She knows a drill that the Solars apparently don't. She crosses her arms over her chest and bows, "I swear to serve.. what is your name?" Waiting for the answer, she goes on. "I swear to serve Chi-Yosh of the Dawn Caste." Rain of Fire bows with her, "I witness the oath of Silent Wind," she intones. The power of the Eclipse then shines forward. Rain of Fire looks at Chi-Yosh, silently prompting him to do his part.

"I accept Silent Wind's service, and swear to hold Silent Wind in honrable servitude for one century and a day." He extends his hand, to accept the shaking bond.

The spirit accepts the hand of Chi-Yosh. Thus bound, Silent Wind honors her promises from earlier. To each Solar she will give a gift.

To Davron she gives a pair of gauntlets that allow the skilled craftsman to restore the lost beauty of those damaged things he finds, and should he will it, go farther and find in them a deeper beauty still.

Ramar is given the lost name Sondok, She Who Stands in Doorways. A demon of some renown, Silent Wind explains that she might be persuaded to teach a battle form that has been lost for over a thousand years.

With the matter settled, Rain of Fire walks into a clearing. Her crimson hair fans out wide, bursting into the flames that whirl around the Spirit of Renewal, the dragon unfurls from the blaze. The Solars climb aboard Rain of Fire, and with a wary look, even Silent Wind climbs atop the grand steed. They take to the darkened sky, streaking through like a comet.

Back in the forest, the elemental sways. "Stay. Stay. Stay. Go. Go." It dives into the earth, and streaks through the turf, following the burning stream of the Solars.
