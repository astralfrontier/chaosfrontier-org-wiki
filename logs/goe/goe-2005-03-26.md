# Gods of Eden 2005-03-26

Ramar and Rabby spend their time securing the hexagonal room. Wards are placed to keep any unwanted spirits out, and the two make their way through the maze, and wait near the surface for the arrival of Rumika. They note the location of every trap they can find, every security measure they know... and they are careful to not come into contact with anything living, other than themselves, lest the Contagion spread.

Rumika's arrival is perhaps more dramatic than she would like. She did not wish to risk drawing too much attention to herself, but avoiding notice altogether is essentially impossible when one is in a hurry. The message was dire enough to make her positively hasty. Fortunately Oaken Claw was able to gain the assistance of the airship that the Circle gave to Greyfalls. The ship does not land, however. In fact, it remains flying very far above the ground, out of the range of all but essence weapons. The path down is assisted by the sorcery of Naro and the Demon She Who Cries Over Countless Burdens. Rumika and Oaken Claw are the only two who will enter Rathess, knowing well the dangers within. And knowing no others can do what must be done.

Ramar and Rabby are waiting when they arrive. They have secured the entrance to the labyrinth and lead Rumika and Oaken Claw through the twisting passages, where angles are unnatural and heat begins to rise, until they find the room where their friends are locked away in stone.

Along the way, Oaken Claw's presence as well as that of the Demon are more than enough to keep the spirit from trying another stunt. The power of Soul Mastery is sensed even here and for now, goes untested.

Once the room is reached, the plan to remove the stoned Exalts begins in earnest. Rumika first draws out a bolt of cloth, giving it to the demon. "Do not touch the surface there, but roll this out upon it," she instructs.

As the cloth is rolled out, it turns to stone, providing much more area where those trying to rescue allies made into statues may walk. "This shouldn't take long," says Rumika. In the meantime, she examines Ramar and Rabby carefully, frowning in thought. "You have time yet, but I will heal you as soon as we are clear of this place. I think I'll take you to the sickhouse." Which is to say, the place where Gallius right now still fights for her life.

With a mix of desperate haste and great care, the cloth of stone is used to cart the stoned exalts away from their trap. One at a time they are brought across by the demon. Davron is brought over last, and just as he reaches safer ground the cloth of stone fractures, leaving the rescuers to carry the three statues without its aid.

When the airship is finally reached, the rescue party is thoroughly exhausted by their efforts. Rumika allows Ramar to get the ship off the ground, but at that point Oaken Claw takes over, allowing the masterful Solar healer to banish the contagion that assails Ramar and Rabby. Both exalts are forced to lie down and rest, not allowed to lift even a finger to aid in their healing. "I have to have both of you fully healed before we get back," she says simply.

The contagion is banished easily, and Ramar spends the duration of the trip resting. Though the body is easy to heal, the reality of how close to certain death they came weighs in his mind. The pleasantness of the trip aids in the recovery though. For her part, Oaken Claw is quite the pilot, and the ship sails through the air serenely, until at last they reach the sickhouse.

Once the airship lands, Rumika's demon works swiftly to move the statues. It's haste is easily enough understood. As soon as the last statue is set in Rumika's lab, it is freed again to return to the eternal prison that is Malfeas. Rumika and Oaken Claw work together to help Ramar and Rabby from the ship. The Contagion is gone from them, to be sure, but some weakness might still remain. The healers are certainly going to approach their recovery with caution.

"I'm fine... I'm fine," says Ramar, though the strength of his voice and the way his knees sort of buckle when he puts his feet on solid ground are indications to the contrary. "I just need to... to get them back to normal." The Solar then asks, after catching his breath, "How is she?" Who the she is, is quite clear, given the concern in his voice.

Ramar is answers not by Rumika, but by a woman that Ramar has not seen in these parts before who is stepping from inside the healing house. "She is healing better today," says the strange woman.

"I'm glad. She's very important to me." The Solar watches as the strange woman walk out of the healing house. He cannot help but notice after a moment just what in fact she is. "I take it you have been summoned to aid in the task..."

The strange woman purses her lips. "I am here to serve until Gallius Leom recovers," she says flatly. She turns to Rumika, watching her closely. The solar arches an eyebrow at the demon, "I suggest you get back to your task, if you wish to be free again," Rumika says casually. "I will check her progress once our new guests are attended-to."

"I do not like it... but if that is the only way to see to her healing," says Ramar, "Then it must be done." He shakes his head, and turns his attention to the task at hand. Well, once he's had some time to rest. Working in conjunction with Rumika, the two are able to learn the means by which Chi-Yosh, Davron, and Kez were turned to stone. After careful tests, it is determined that the stone aspect has been increased to dangerously excessive amounts. It must be drained away somehow if they are to return to the land of the living.

Rumika always approaches problems from different ways. But in this, it seems pretty clear. "Obviously the easiest place to dispose of the excess is the ground itself. The question then is how to best do it. And of course knowing when to stop is critical as well."

"Right." Ramar furrows his brow in thought, "I suppose then, it falls on us to drain the excess earth. Although I would wonder about the effects of the excess essence on the surrounding terrain. If we can put the energy to good use... hmmm..." The Solar rises and begins to pace back and forth, muttering to himself in thought.

After thorough inspection, the Solars come to the conclusion that the only thing fine enough to purify their frozen friends are small ducts of essence. The weaving of such a complex work is far from easy. Working side by side the two sorcerors create web upon web of essence, forming what amounts to a matrix of pure energy. Each strand is given just enough strength to draw out the required amount of stone.

The fine ducts of Essence, once assembled in the matrix, begin their work. The process is a slow one, by all accounts. It takes a day to rebalance the different aspects of each person. Essence is reworked, shaped, and channeled through these small webs. First, Chi-Yosh's stone takes on a pink palor, becoming granite. The work continues, and slowly the web of energy woven around his body begins to emanate a smokey aura, as though stone were being ground rapidly. The rocky form begins to move, chest rising up and down, with every breath stone is expelled from within. The key here is to be certain that the stone is drawn out, to keep it from creating an imbalance in the air, in the wood.

Once the aspects of Chi-Yosh are rebalanced internally, Ramar retrieves a special pronged tuner. He uses this to strum the web of Essence that encompasses the rock-encased Solar. He strikes three times, sending out a resonance over the Essence web's air, wood, and water centers. These begin to fluctuate, and he channels his own Essence, his stable essence through the tuner as he strikes Chi-Yosh's brow. The body begins to resonate with the web. It is the principle of sympathy. Like attracts like. En's teachings are foremost in Ramar's mind. For a moment, the Chi-Yosh and the web are the same. Ramar strikes again, creating an imabalance. The stone in the web empties, leaves a vacuum to be filled. It will take the rest of the night, but gradually Chi-Yosh's stony form becomes more and more akin to flesh, until at long last, the rock has faded completely. A container made of fine glass and charged with mystic runes is used to contain the excess Essence, stored until it can be put to better use.

In his mind, Ramar can already see the energy invested in his golem, providing extra resources to draw upon. Day breaks. Chi-Yosh breathes steadily now. They begin working on Davron. While they work, Ramar notes the interesting properties of the Substantial and the Insubstantial, how a thing can flicker back and forth from one state to another almost seamlessly. _Perhaps there is some way to put this to use..._ And by dusk, Davron is once again flesh-and-blood. Kez is left for last... there is little difficulty in healing the Sidereal, though there is an oddness to the process as fate itself becomes reworked. No more will these three be stone. When at last the task is done, Ramar watches as Rumika removes the last traces of the Great Contagion. Now that his friends are safe, and he is healed... the Solar finds the exhaustion irresistible, and nearly collapses.

---

A few days have passed. Ramar is at last recovered from the trials of the Contagion and restoring his friends. He has the essence of stone trapped, and the growing stone of Rathess... a few more things remain before the construction of the golem can at last begin. To this end, Ramar is travelling for the battlefield on the Nation's doorstep. To the still-scarred lands where Gallius and the Dowager fought one another. There, perhaps, will be the final piece.

The battlefield is deathly silent. No amount of work has yet repaired the damage done in the midst of the horrible blast. The earth is charred and blackened, and though it has been combed through, it appears almost as though the blast has just occurred. That moment's impact is still felt. Ramar walks through the area cautiously, and what Essence is left unscarred in this land whispers to him, speaking of hidden things. With his enhanced senses, the Solar is able to notice the dull glint of metal deep within the blasted Earth. "Hmmm..."

It takes lots of digging, and even chipping with the tip of his sword to loosen the earth enough to actually dig through it. In some cases its even been fused into solid rock. After a while, the ground is chipped away enough to reveal what the metal is... a round shield, plain, unornate, has been sunk deep within the earth. Through some extraordinary miracle, it is unscathed, though wedged in the ground rather securely. Another hour's work has it worked loose enough for Ramar to retrieve it.

On the journey back to Rumika's makeshift laboratory, Ramar studies the shield, intrigued at how such a plain thing could have survived where two unstoppable forces met. When the ship lands, he disembarks, and rejoins the others, explaining the next part of his plan, the construction of the golem.

---

The ringing of steel and the heat of the forge are common throughout the next few days. Davron works his magic to help craft the body, while Ramar oversees the flows of Essence... guiding them carefully when it comes time to infuse the golem's body with the soul of stone.

Rumika enters during Ramar's workings, watching him in silence. During a moment when the Eclipse's attention need not be so focused, she finally speaks, "The healing is finally fully taken. I never doubted she would make it, but it's good to see such strong signs of improvement now." And yet it's clear that Rumika's been crying, and the healer's hands are dirty.

Ramar takes a deep breath. That news is unbearable at this moment. Tools clatter to the ground, and the Solar sways back and forth briefly. He turns towards Rumika, walks to her, "Thank you. Thank you for all you've done for her, for all of us, Rumika. You've given more than anyone." Tears begin to trace tracks down Ramar's soot-stained face. "I..."

Rumika smiles sadly and shakes her head, "It was the right thing. They knew what they were doing. I am so proud of them. It's just.." For a moment her strength wavers, and she has to wipe away tears, leaving mud on her cheeks where her dirty hands touch. "It's hard. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with my children."

Ramar hugs Rumika gently, "I can only imagine how you must feel." He steps back, "I know they wanted to be with you, to stay with you, but..." Ramar sighs sadly, shaking his head. "She'll need you when she's awake. I know it's not the same, but there is someone who will need you now more than ever..."

"I will be there for her," says Rumika. "I do not know what things will be like. The merging has changed her body. In a way, she's grown even more beautiful. I hope you have time to go look-in on her. She's so peaceful, and before she was always scared when I watched her. Just don't make too much noise. Her nurse is extremely protective today."

"For her, I have all the time in the world. I'll be there for her as much as I can," says Ramar. "I will do my best to keep quiet, to not disturb her... just seeing her alright will be enough." He smiles sadly, "I can almost remember it. What it was like when I touched the strands of their souls... it's almost like I can see it out of the corner of my mind's eye..."

"Part of me wishes I could have been there, but the wiser part knows it is better that I was not," says Rumika. She turns her mind to the golem, though, seeking a diversion for herself. "So how is your work going? It seems you are drawing closer, at least."

"I think I am. It's... well, it's coming along, in its own way. It will not be long now, but there are a few other complications... personalities, that sort of thing to sort out." Ramar shrugs his shoulders, gesturing behind him.

"Well, try to make it with a personality that is compatible with your own. If you aren't careful, you'll wind up with something as petulant as the demon I summoned. But we won't have to put up with her much longer." Rumika pauses, deciding now is a good time to turn to this subject. "So why is it that you hate them so much? They are just tools."

"I don't think they are just tools... they are the will of the Yozis, aren't they? I don't trust them to be controlled, to not have some ulterior motive." Ramar pauses a moment, "They are our enemies. I'm not sure it would do well to treat them as tools... let alone call them here. But these are my own thoughts, and have no bearing on anyone else."

"Oh, they might try," agrees Rumika. "But they'll do as they are told. You don't trust them far beyond that, and I wouldn't leave one alone too long. Still, they can be used. They are tools. Dangerous ones, but if you want to do serious work, they are often just the thing. Besides, it is our Right to control them. I have no doubt they'd corrupt us if they could, but once you break them their options are rather limited."

"How do you know you have broken one? That one is not just playing along, having answered your call and broken free of your will..." Ramar shakes his head, "It is much too dangerous."

"How do you know the sun will rise tomorrow?" asks Rumika. She laughs softly and shakes her head, letting out a sigh. "Some things you just have to know, Ramar. You have to have faith in yourself. In what you are doing. How do you know your magic doesn't all come from them? Isn't it true you went into Gaia and walked back through Cecelyne? How do you know any part of you is the same?"

"I don't know..." answers Ramar. "I have know way of ever truly knowing, I suppose..." the Solar begins to look worried, "Do I seem like a demon?"

Rumika actually laughs at this. "Do I? Does it worry you that a demon has helped keep Gallius alive? Without her I'm not sure things would have gone nearly so well. For one, I would have been unable to come retrieve you without risking your Zenith's life."

"I know. I understand it's what keeps her alive. It worries me, but no more than what she's been through so far. I know her. She's tougher than any demon." Ramar chuckles, "Stronger too... but, I know she is well. I know you are not a demon and that you are able to control them. So are others... I just, I don't think I can."

"You will promise me something, then," says Rumika. "You will never summon a demon until you _know_ you can break them. If you meddle with them and are anything shy of certain, your own destruction is the most likely outcome. And the ruin of those around you, as well. I will not tolerate that kind of foolish risk. I must admit I am surprised. Is it not true that you have learned from the Book? What is the summoning of a demon next to what powers the final circle holds?"

"I will not summon a demon, Rumika. Though I have been given a name as a gift, I will not do so. As for the final circle... that's different. The final circle is not a hostile will that must be bent or broken... it is... something else entirely." Ramar searches for the right words to describe the sheer magnificence that the final circle holds... "It is something I know that I can do, that I know I must do."

"Oh really?" asks Rumika. "So when you work the essence that screams in the eyes of Creation you don't feel the power? Have you ever seen a spell break, Ramar?" she asks. She considers, "I did not see what happened when Gallius was struck down, but I felt it. That is what it would probably be like if a third circle spell were to be broken."

"I do. I believe it might be worse, if the spell were to be broken roughly... if the most adamant of countermagics are used, then the damage might be lessened, but... you are right. I do not plan on having a spell like that broken though... it is much too soon to risk casting those spells near anyone else who has that potential," says Ramar.

"Just be sure to never be distracted, and when you do decide to make use of those spells, do not do so alone," says Rumika. "You dislike demons, but they are useful to keep people from meddling with you when you are casting a spell. But I think you have found an interesting way to be protected. I imagine you have some interesting way to make sure the golem can always be around?"

"Uhm," replies Ramar, looking less certain of himself all of a sudden. "I uhm, have not actually yet implemented that part of the design, or even, uhm... I had not thought about that, in all honesty."

"Well, finish the work at hand, then Davron can help you with that consideration," says Rumika. "But it seems you have more than enough flying devices to study. And I'm sure many other possibilities will come to mind."

"I will." Ramar considers, "Though I think it would be difficult to incorporate a volo into the design it might be possible. Hmm. Oh uhm, Rumika... do you know much about demons of the second circle?"

"I know about summoning them," says Rumika softly. "But there are many of them that I do not know of. I think the Book might be able to provide a lot more information for me, but for now I rely heavily on the correspondance of Samea. You know her, though. The Zenith of Yurgen Kaneko's Circle? She's a very wise young woman."

Ramar ahs, "Yes, indeed." Ramar considers this thoughtfully, then shrugs. "Well, I do not think much will come of it." He turns back to the golem, and rests the tools in their proper place, "I have much to do if I'm to make any sort of mark on this world. Much to learn."

"We all do," says Rumika. "But it's your time to rest," she says. "You look tired enough to sleep where you stand. You know I won't let my patients get themselves ill due to foolishness. Your golem will be here in the morning, young man."

"I am no-" begins Ramar, though the word not is drawn out into a rather powerful yawn, "-t. I just need to finish, then I'll... then I'll maybe get some rest."

"You need to finish, then view your Gallius, and then you should wash your face and get to sleep," says Rumika. "I'll have.." She frowns and sighs. "I mean I'll go ahead and heat some water for you myself."

"No, you're right... it can wait," admits Ramar. "Gallius can't." He makes one last adjustment to the golem, keeping the work in stasis, balanced carefully for a night. "And one more thing, I don't think I'm the only one who could do with washing their face..."

Rumika laughs a little, "Don't change the subject, Ramar! I'll be taking a bath before I go to bed, anyway. More than my face is dirty, and I think it might help me feel a bit better. Or at least relaxed." She will walk with Ramar back to the house. Even in the dim of night, Ramar can see that the tree near the house has had some earth overturned by it, and a marker placed near it. There can be little doubt as to what was placed in the hole dug there.

Rumika leaves Ramar to find the room of Gallius on his own. He knows the way well enough. Inside, the Eclipse finds the demon still on her vigil, watching over Gallius like a hawk. The demon looks over at Ramar, her eyes narrowing a bit, but she otherwise stays still, knowing he is safe. But it is not the demon that draws his eyes, but the peaceful face of the girl who sleeps in the bed. The troubled, pained expression she once wore has changed. A calm smile is on her face, now. When Ramar moves closer to brush a finger over her forehead, the caste mark of the zenith begins to glow like the ashes of a failing fire being stirred by a gentle gust of warm breath.
