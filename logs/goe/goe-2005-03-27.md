# Gods of Eden 2005-03-27

Though Egress has been back only a short time, she has some serious issues she wishes to handle. Fortunately Marina is able to make the wheels of diplomacy move very swiftly. A meeting is requested to assure peace between the Nation of the Sun and the Mask of Winters. Egress is not one for the precise details of treaties, but knows she wants time to build up her strength and improve her people's lives. And so three days before the beginning of Calibration, she goes with a proper entourage to meet the Mask of Winters in the city of Marita.

With Egress comes Marina and three mortals of importance. A shaman named Shining Stars, a merchant who calls himself Silver Ears, and a skillful farmer called Sharinka. Dace comes as the honor guard. Rain of Fire comes as a representative of the spirits of the Nation, as well.

The meeting has been agreed to. The Mask of Winters is waiting in the garden of an isolated mansion once used by a Guild director now since dead. The place has been put to such uses before, and navigating the hedge-labyrinth in the back of the vast marble building follows a well-known policy: follow the hedges which are dead, and you will be led to the proper place.

At the center of the hedge maze are five people. One is Stormclouds at Dusk, wearing his traditional hat and leather duster, and looking distinctly uncomfortable - or at least his body language suggests it, for his face is ever in shadow. Two are clearly Abyssal lords, unarmored but resplendent in silken courtiers' garb. One is a musician, who sits cross-legged and gently strums the strings of some wooden instrument across his lap.

The final figure is disconcerting at first, for he looks like nothing more than a young man in the flower of youth. He wears the mask of a tragedian, covering the face entirely, and dresses in the funerary robes of the city of Sijan's morticians.

He looks nothing like the undead horror that men have spoken of stalking the towers and battlefields in and around Thorns, and perhaps this is the disconcerting part. He removes the painted mask, revealing a smiling and handsome face, and gestures at the seats across from his own at the large garden table. "Sit and be welcomed," he says.

Nevertheless, there is an aura of dark power from him that those who've come can feel. The others show deference to him in every fidget and blink of the eye. He can be none other.

Egress has heard the tales, and has somewhat muddled memories of the Abyssals and Deathlords she had seen in the past. She bows deeply, then one by one draws the chairs of the mortals, then Rain of Fire, then Marina, then Dace, and last of all for herself. Introductions are made as calmly as they may be by Marina, and one by one those who have come with Egress nod respectfully to the Mask of Winters. Last of all Egress speaks, "I am pleased that you could find the time to meet with us on such short notice."

"Although frequently busy, I have a great deal of time," smiles the Mask of Winters, smiling at what to him is some sort of joke. "And of course I prioritize my business. Congratulations on your speedy recovery."

"Thank you," says Egress. "A great deal of people overcame a great deal so that I could survive." She can't help but smirk a bit at the joke. No doubt the deathless do have as long as they wish. "I think we can both find ways to profit from this meeting. It would be very wasteful for my people to be brought into another battle with a Deathlord. I would like to assure the Confederation of Rivers as well that my intent is not to forever be locked in battles."

"I'm sure they understand that," says the Mask, in a sort of reassuring and fatherly voice that's at odds with his youthful appearance. "We enjoy similar reputations in some quarters, you know. It has been difficult for me to prove my intentions as well."

"From the stories they tell of us, that is not so hard to believe," answers Egress. "But I have heard other rumors, and yet I think perhaps that now is not the time to speak of those things." She hints delicately that perhaps a second, more private meeting might change that in her body language. "I have spoken to my advisors, and I would like to sign a treaty. I am not aware of your goals, but I do not believe you seek war with us. I would like to make a treaty of non-agression, and if it works well between us, perhaps in the future we might consider other options, if you are interested."

"Present me with your terms and I will consider it," the Mask murmurs. "I have entered such agreements with.. some of my fellows. Even Lookshy acknowledges the debt they owe me, should anyone... attack." He coughs a little, exaggerating what would have been a subtle social nuance into another joke, and his Abyssals laugh. Even Stormclouds at Dusk forgets himself, and lets out a dusty chuckle. "You'll forgive me, but there are times when I find simple joy in being me." Leaning forward, he steeples his flawless fingers together on the table and stares across it at Egress, studying her reaction.

The terms are rather straight-forward and simple. The Nation of the Sun, including all those who dwell inside its borders, are pledged to make no attacks against the Mask of Winters. In return, he must agree to do the same. Couriers and diplomats acting under his banners will be allowed to enter the borders of the Nation to maintain cordial relations as needed, and the reverse is also to be allowed. The Mask of Winters will also be given favorable trading rights with the Nation. It is a curiously open and friendly treaty, and the changes from Gallius to Egress could not be made any more clear than by its terms.

With a flourish of his hand, the Mask of Winters summons quill and parchment in a splash of multicolored Essence. "Write the words you have heard," he commands it, and the quill begins to move of its own accord. Page after page is filled with the terms Egress outlined, written in a style compatible with the laws of the Confederation of Rivers. While it works, he returns his attention to the Solar representatives. "Well then.. you've been very generous to me. I would like to offer a token of my esteem. Will you accept, let us say, five hundred complete suits of jade armor, with daiklaives to match, for your Dragon Princes and other allies? You understand that my champions have little use for such things."

Egress smiles, "You are most generous," she says. "We certainly would accept such gifts, if you will accept a more humble gift." She turns to the three mortals, each of whom slide forward long, shallow boxes. They remove the lids as one, and inside can be seen the slivers of soulsteel that once formed the weapon of the Dowager of the Irreverent Vulgate in Unrent Veils. "This is not as it once was, but I feel there may be some power left in it yet, for one of skill to work upon," says Egress. Just seeing it like this has an effect on her, and she feels the ghost of a touch, as if thousands of needles were gliding over her skin, ready to drive their icy tips deep into her flesh.

"Oh ho," says the Mask, his eyes lighting up, and his Abyssals glance at each other. Only the musician who plays in the background is unaffected, and Egress perceives in that moment that he too is a ghost, brought to the lands of the living by the Deathlord. "I wonder how she would feel about me holding onto that. Might she come to my door as she did yours?"

"It is hard to say," says Egress. "I do not know much of her mind. But I paid dear enough for this, as did my people, and so it is no longer her's to give. We give it to you, if you wish for it. I certainly will be happier to have it out of the hands of those who might use it against me."

"Well, I will make such a case if she expresses interest. Still, better my door than yours, eh?" the youth chuckles sardonically. His unspoken thoughts are clear enough, as he wishes them to be - _the gift you give me brings trouble with it_.

"Is she does come to your door, she may offer you something of less peril for it," says Egress. "I do not think she will seek trouble so swiftly, however. Even against one she thought far weaker than her she did not walk away unscathed. In any case, I trust your wisdom to find profit from this gift."

The Mask smiles. "I do indeed. It will be a fascinating experience, I'm sure." He leans forward conspiratorially, and continues. "And if I may continue our conversation in the vein of fascinating experiences.. what did you think of death?"

Egress looks thoughtful for a time. "It was strange," she says quietly. "It was not exactly my first brush with it, but it was different. It seemed a place that was free of many of the limits of life. I remember feeling no great fear of it while I was on the very edge. Yet I have no desire to rush back to it."

The Mask hmmms. "Yes, well, death is like that.. it engenders no great feelings about itself, except among the living. Funny thing.. you stop wanting much after you get it. This is good, for those who can't have what they want. Bad, for those who can. This is why we have many more citizens who were poor while alive."

Egress nods slowly. "And yet for rich or poor, there is a time. And beyond that, for some, lies Gaia. A very strange place, but it lacks many of the terrors of Creation. Still, it is far from perfect. But wouldn't perfection itself be horribly boring?"

"Once you are perfect, 'boring' ceases to matter," smiles the Mask complacently. "But for now, shall we dine? I'm sure you are hungry."

The Solar Queen nods to this, "I think that sounds a fine idea," she agrees. She seems the most calm of her entourage, at this point. She is very curious about Stormclouds at Dusk. He pops up far too often to be nothing but a normal Abyssal.

Food and wine are taken in the failing light of dusk, and the music that plays begets a calming atmosphere over the proceedings. Were it not for the reputation and clearly death-haunted subordinates of the Mask of Winters, this could be any diplomatic function among mortal man.

Egress somehow manages to relax among the Abyssals and the Deathlord, as well. Knowing their is likely some kindred spirit in each of them helps her in this. She even goes so far as to share a song with the ghost, playing the modest wooden flute that Rumika had made to help her recovery.

When things grow more relaxed, Egress speaks more quietly with Mask of Winters, hoping that he might share some information with her. "You speak of alliances with the other Deathlords. Other than the rumors I have heard, I know almost nothing of them. I wish to know more of the others, so that I can act in ways that will keep my people safe. I also do not wish to accidentally offend your allies by stepping on their territory."

"Their territory, such as it is, lies generally in the Underworld. Where it stretches into the world of the living, you will invariably find shadowlands. That is the boundary of our territory. It is not a line on paper that kings may wage war over; it's a clear barrier." The Mask smiles indulgently. "As to where we draw the lines ourselves? Well... you could say we all want the same thing in the end, but we have our own ideas about how to go about it."

Egress pauses to consider this carefully. She asks then, "I have seen now a few Deathlords. I have heard there are conflicts amongst them. I do not know the details, but I would like to know what the effect will be. Are there battles coming?"

"There are usually several battles a century," muses the Mask, thinking it over a moment. "As to what's coming? Well... that would be telling. Let me reassure you that such things are our problems. Unless, of course, they aren't. If that turns out to be true, I'll notify the Confederation as I usually do."

"I see," says Egress. Mask of Winters is definitely not going to be forthcoming, she sees. Hardly surprising, considering things. "Well, as for my people, we shall not expand by conquest, but I have allies to the north who may be considering new territory. I do not think it will alter your plans, however."

"My plans? Not at all. I'm quite content with my holdings." The Mask settles back, chuckling at some further joke. "But.. diplomacy among us is very often a formality, Egress. I anticipated your coming before I learned of your interest. I anticipated the Dowager, and she anticipated me, and so my plan to capture some of her Abyssals was unsuccessful. But I did destroy three, for which I'm grateful. Oh yes, there's one other thing..."

With startling suddenness the Mask moves. He's gone from his seat at the table. The next thing Egress perceives is his hand, shoved through the chest of one of his Abyssals. The fine robe begins to show a spreading stain of blood, and the man utters a stunned gurgle. The Deathlord withdraws his deadly blow, hand closed around the Abyssal's heart. The Exalt collapses, shuddering and writhing like a beheaded snake. Finally he grows still.

"I uncovered a traitor too." The Mask says this as though nothing at all had gone amiss, and he returns to the table. The heart is gone, and with it the blood that was on his arm.

This move has shocked the remaining two Abyssals; Stormclouds at Dusk at least had the presence of mind to reach for his axes, but he never completed the maneuver. At length he grows less tense, returning to his former position.

Egress reacts to the movement, but by the time she's wrapped herself in the terror of pure essence, the foe is already dead. "A traitor..?" She frowns in thought. "Hmph! A very unwise one, it would seem." She reaches out for a moment, then pauses to ask, "I do not wish to find out if the body has any more tricks. Would you mind if I removed it?"

"All traitors are unwise. You may do as you wish," sniffs the Deathlord.

A lance of sunlight jets from the hand of Egress and the corpse is swiftly consumed by the light. "I imagine that some other Deathlord is very interested in what you are doing," Egress says. She releases the power of her charm, but still her anima banner remains above. She does not doubt that Mask of Winters has learned a great deal from the constant presence of her caste mark, as well as this little demonstration.

"Of course they are. And so I have spies, like that one, in their courts." He nods to Stormclouds at Dusk. "Of all my spies, and of all the spies I have encountered, only this one is honest about what he does. And so of all those who come to my court seeking my secrets, he is the only one I allow to learn them."

Egress laughs softly and looks to Stormclouds at Dusk. "He's popped-up a few times now. Always poking his nose into things where I've been active. Still, it seems that sneaking about has never been his style with me." If this were more casual, she'd joke that the man was pursuing her.

"It ain't," the dour Abyssal replies, and the Mask laughs. "Shall I tell you why I permit him, Egress? Telling you would amuse me, since it would be using the very thing I'm about to describe."

"Well, I think I can guess at least one reason," says Egress. "But I imagine it is more than just being able to know who the spy is and giving them information of your choosing. I was going to suggest that the treaty allow for some sort of assurances through spying, but I was strongly dissuaded."

"You are correct, on both counts. And I for one have no need to plant spies in your Nation. Your plans are clear as day to anyone who understands you." The Mask smiles a little wickedly.

"Perhaps, but our progress might not be," answers Egress. "But if you are content, I am." The solar sighs softly, "Still, it's disappointing that I'm so very boring and obvious."

"Nonsense," says the Mask. "We can't all be interesting bogeymen."

---

Dinner goes smoothly. Evening comes.

Egress feels out the ways of Mask of Winters over the night, and she has no doubt that he learns a great deal about her, as well. Still, she has more questions. "Being what I am, I often get visions of the past," she says to Mask of Winters. "Dreams of what was before. In many of them I see the power that was once the birthright of the Solars. What happened between the Dowager and myself makes me strongly suspect that the Third Circle is a secret known to the Deathlords."

"Oh? And why would we know anything about it?" asks the Deathlord, complacently. His adjutants have retired; Egress' associates are still close by, but have withdrawn for a discussion of a more private nature.

"Because you have been around a very long time," says Egress. "And because you are very powerful. It would be logical to think you have its power. I suspect the damage done in the battle with the Dowager was the result of a broken spell, but no Celestial spell has that much power."

"Hmm." The Mask chuckles a bit; the joke is on him now. "Well, I can't deny it, I suppose. Yes, we have the power granted to Brigid by the Yozis' own fetiches, the magic of the Adamant Circle."

"Could you be persuaded to restore some of that memory to us?" asks Egress. "I know it is a great gift, but I also thought so many suits of armor was a treasure beyond kings. If the Dowager comes again, I would like a way to stop her. Or better yet, to have the power that would dissuade her from returning at all."

"If all you want is to keep her away, don't provoke her," counsels the Mask of Winters, blandly.

Egress laughs softly. "You know the nature of my kind," she replies. "Do you think we'll find a way to provoke her again?"

The Mask shrugs. "I'm sure you'll do your best, as usual," he replies, deadpan.

The zenith laughs again. "So I guess you will not reveal the secrets then? And what will happen if we continue seeking blindly and find some scraps of them? It is said that the libraries of the Realm may hold things old enough to reveal what is required for the secret to be discovered again."

"Oh, I might consider it." The Mask shrugs a little, raising a wineglass to his lips and drinking deeply. "I know that you understand that I won't give you the weapon to destroy me. Nor will I give you the power to destroy my fellows unless it's my wish that they be destroyed. So I already know what sorts of magics you understand you can ask for." Leaning forward, then, his eyes begin to glow with lambent flame. "Shall we play a game for your Solar magic?"

"What kind of game?" asks Egress. "I generally have little time for such things, but if it will lighten the mood, it would be welcome. And of course I understand your limitations. I know little of what it can do. I cannot even use sorcery of the first circle yet."

"The game I speak of is the most ancient magic of all. Would you like to hear its name?"

"Certainly," says Egress. "You certainly have my attention. I have a great interest in ancient things. They have a tendency to be useful."

"It is called 'The Truth'. While we play, you can speak only truth. And so can I. Do you agree?"

"Very well," says Egress softly. "It sounds a very difficult game to play."

"It is the magic that wrought Creation from the Wyld," whispers the Mask. "It was the first power the Primordials ever tasted and the last they will ever know. It is the 'I am' of life against the 'no' of despair. We will see how well you play." The burning glow of his eyes becomes more radiant. "So. You may speak, or ask, whatever you wish. Only that it must be true. If it is not, you will die. The magic does not compel that you be honest, only that you do so if you wish to live."

Egress blinks her eyes. "It's rather frightening. But exciting, as well, isn't it?" She feels that strange power in her, and asks, "Is this also the Adamant Circle? It feels odd. The question that often I wonder is how much power the Deathlords would tolerate my people having before they decide that they must stop it."

"It is older than the Adamant Circle, but not much older." The Mask speaks quietly, levelly. "Each Deathlord has his or her - or its - own limits. I would destroy you if I learned that you possessed magic enough to stop me from my objectives, even if you didn't use it."

The Deathlord speaks again. "And now for me.. Do you, or your associates, seek to find the location of the Book of Three Circles?"

"I was going to ask if you had it," answers Egress, but she will say no more. She very much did plan on asking that, of course. As a ruse.

Egress considers for a time. "There are so many things I wish to ask you," she admits. "I'm not entirely sure where to begin. What kind of sorcery is it that would cause the Deathlords to think that my people were able to stop their objectives?"

"Large-scale attack spells. Spells that affect shadowlands. Anything operating on the _an_ or _so_ Essence scales above the seven-sigma threshold. In general, anything that opposed my ability to send my armies where they are needed. And there is another thing, but I prefer not to speak of it." This is true, undisputably so, and Egress learns something about the magic she is under.

"And if I may... Would you use such magics if I protected you from my fellows' wrath, provided I myself permitted a given casting?"

"I think it depends very much on the circumstance, but if it furthered my own goals and I believed it safe, I would almost certainly do so," says Egress. "I would say certainly, but my recent recovery makes me doubt that anything is completely destined."

Egress finds this game most interesting, thus far. She decides to try another angle. "Would restoring the Dragon Kings be seen as a provocation by the Deathlords?" she asks.

"No." The Mask's answer is simple and direct. "Our masters will have uses for them once humanity has died, after all." Egress can sense the voluntary nature of this admission, and wonders why the Mask of Winters would reveal this - surely he intends it to be used. "You play well. You draw your boundaries. You do not ask how to destroy me, because you know I could choose not to answer."

Egress answers his words softly, "I do not wish to destroy you." And those words hang in the air. The truth.

The Mask smiles. "Interesting. You may ask something else, if you wish."

"This one is probably a strange question," says Egress. "What is the Council of Entities? I have heard so much of them. I just wish to know what its members are."

"They are ghosts, mortals, and a _kush ya tet_," answers the Mask. "An agent of the Yozis."

"And so... because that is a question I have longed to answer for someone, I'll go easy on you. What is it they have told you that you keep secret?"

"They said that the Deathlords were once Solars who decided to serve the Yozis to try and alter Fate, so that the Great Prophecy would not be true," answers Egress. They said other things, as well, of course. "Since an Abyssal once revealed the likeness between Solars and Abyssals, it made a lot of sense. And it seemed like something a Solar would do, so at least it is plausible."

"So I guess the most obvious question is then, were you a Solar?" asks Egress. She is getting the hang of this game. She just doesn't understand the goal yet. For her, getting information is reward enough.

"Not that I remember," says the Mask with a smile. "My question in return is, if you are a Solar now, will you someday become something like me?"

Egress considers that question carefully. "I don't know. My heart tells me I would not, but the wisdom pain has taught me makes me think such a bold declaration hollow. If I was in a position where the future of Creation required me to make such a sacrafice, I think I would, unless my courage and conviction failed me. I guess I should say I would hope I am brave enough to pay such a price, if that is what is required of me."

"You may not be willing to answer this, but I have a feeling you know more than anyone else who would speak so openly with me," says Egress. "What happened to the Empress?"

The Mask actually bursts out laughing at this question. "Well, well," he manages, finally recovering after several moments. "I assume you refer to the woman styling herself the Scarlet Empress, who sat on the throne of the Realm for seven centuries?"

"Yes, that is the one I speak of," says Egress. "I didn't know it would be so funny to you."

"It's just.." The Mask chuckles more, finally regaining his composure a bit. "It's just that there's been SO MANY of them. But now you are asking me for something, not giving me a reason to entrust Solar magic in your hands. Well... the questions will get tougher, but I will answer this one."

"If you prefer, I can try another question," suggests Egress. "It just struck me as an interesting point to bring-up, since under her watch my kind were struck down so very efficiently. If she were to return, things would be very dangerous."

"The Empress died the day she entered the Imperial Manse," the Mask of Winters answers. "She became a vessel for one of our number." No need to ask who 'our' refers to. "Since then the vessel was discarded and replaced as needed. It happened quite frequently, I'm told."

The Deathlord leans forward, eyes still glowing. "And now, if you insist on being difficult.. what is the extent of your Nation's magical acquisitions?"

Egress needs some time to think that over. "Well, to start, we've begun to organize the spirits, gods, and elementals. We're improving a school to train mortals for what things they may learn. We've gathered assets and looked at finding certain artifacts. I'm guessing having the Eye would likely make the Deathlords come for us, though. We are trying to gather Solars and make our nation strong enough to give them free growth away from the Wyld Hunt and other threats. As you likely know we're trying to regain Creation in many ways."

"How do the Deathlords feel about the Fair Folk?" asks Egress. She turns the ship away from those rough waters for a while. She doesn't wish to go through that kind of question again.

"We're at cross-purposes, ultimately."

The Mask of Winter chuckles a bit. "You seem to be avoiding something. Instead of a question, shall I tell you a secret? My question to you, after you hear it, will be - what do you intend to do next?"

"I fear that it is difficult to reveal all your secrets, even to those you do not wish to destroy," says Egress. "I will answer your question, even if you do not wish to tell the secret."

"Very well. Let us say for the moment that you have the Book of Three Circles - which you do." The Mask of Winters continues after only a moment's pause. "Certainly the other Deathlords would descend on you en masse if they knew this. Do you agree? If so, then now is the time for the question I alluded to a moment ago."

Egress actually laughs softly. She lets out a sigh, seeming relieved of all things. "Well, it is pretty simple, isn't it? You can imagine how hard it is to find such a thing. Then you can also imagine the consternation of having what would seem to be the most powerful object ever to be totally useless. However, I think there are ways that such a thing could exist and not draw such a fate. If a truce of some kind could be put into place. The problem is finding a middle ground. Creation is not as vast as it was. I hope it's possible for the land to grow so that there is room for us to exist and not have to destroy each other. But now I wonder if it that is ever going to be possible. I wonder if, in the end, we must fight, no matter how I might seek to change it."

"I think it is time to end this game," says the Mask. "But before we do, I have one addition. Use the Book in ways that do not threaten me or my goals and I will keep your secret. You can negotiate for protection against more public displays at a later time. Do we understand each other?"

"I understand," says Egress. "The Mask of Winters is being curiously generous. We will do our best to make it worth his while."

"Excellent." The Deathlord flashes a charming smile. "Dinner was excellent. I'm sure you have a great deal to digest. Shall we see each other again?"

"Certainly," says Egress. "Perhaps you would like to visit the Nation? Or see the battlefield. It would be most interesting to stand there with a Deathlord and not be mortally wounded as a result."

"We will see," says the Mask of Winters, and that is that.
