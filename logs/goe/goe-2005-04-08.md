# Gods of Eden 2005-04-08

Chi-Yosh's tasks of the last few months, working towards a better health system in the Nation, and other tasks, while precious, have begun to shrink in eagerness to the coming challenges ahead. Last Calibration, a gift in advance had been bestowed upon Chi-Yosh. He had been rejuvenated and joined further to Creation by the goddess Azel, since then had used the increased power to further the Circle and its goals. Now, the payment is to be returned, task which has the Dawn excited. Except for the trip into the Wylds of the West, the Solar has not ventured further East than the Imperial Island. Now, the chance to serve, explore lands untouched by the Circle, and once more return to the streets of Yu-Shan a noticeable player in Creation's Exalted politics has left the Solar looking towards the calendar with the month drawing to a close.

The past year has seen the founding of the Nation of the Sun, a burgeoning empire which promises, in the fullness of time, to bring to fruition one of Davron's fondest wishes - the restoration of the peace which ruled Creation for thousands of years. But that promise will be long in coming - and this tumultuous first year of the Nation exacted a heavy toll upon the author of that vision. The woman who was once Gallius is soon to recover, but that recovery came at a terrible price - not just to herself, but to one whom Davron cares deeply about. Rumika is far from the cheerful woman he'd met at the last Calibration, having kept largely to herself after the loss of her two daughters. And so the triumphs of the past year, for Davron, have been tempered with concern for the woman that he loves - and a determination to help her somehow. Perhaps this second Calibration will offer an opportunity for Davron, in his awkward way, to help Rumika find solace.

For Egress, this Calibration will be a celebration of second chances. Her time has been spent frantically since her rebirth. The focus of Gallius is gone. There will be no glorious conquest of arms. Instead, the Ascending Lion will turn her mind to the growth of her people and then to those outside her borders. Not for conquest, but because it is the purpose of Solars. She realizes that her obligations are not just to humans, however, but also to the spirits and her kindred Exalts. For this reason, she must increase her efforts to reform the Deliberative and to find for herself the right role. In this respect, she has called upon the Book of Three Circles to teach her more about the Deliberative. There are more laws than can quickly be learned, of course, but her focus is swiftly narrowed. She wishes to prepare herself to claim the role of Icon. As in so many matters to come, to succeed she must have the assistance of the Chosen of the Maidens.

The turning of the year has been on Ramar's mind lately. The events of the past year weigh heavily as so much has happened, so much has changed. It has been a year of joy and sorrow. The Nation was born, at least two wars were fought, and the Book of Three Circles found. Yet none of these events can begin to compare with the events that led up to the finding of the Book. When at last he found love with Gallius, only to lose her not too long after... but, even that did not dampen his spirits in the end. With his help, they were able to save her, though the cost was dear. The coming year he anticipates with a heart full of hope. Many things must be done, especially if he is to follow the task set before him by the girl in his dreams. Now that he's come to understand Sorcery, he knows that it is not just in Essence that power lies, it is within the self that things must begin. He knows that it is up to him to take charge of his destiny. For now though, he shall relax.

Calibration brings with it the splendid Carnival of Masks, a celebration of all the gods and spirits that dwell in and outside of the city of Yu-Shan. For this time, there is no animosity or hostility; the dreadfully ancient power that makes Calibration what it is ensures this. It is said among the powers of the Celestial City that even the gods fear what lurks behind the five days of disjointedness that snake like cracks in the wall of history. And to cover this fear, it is whispered, they hold the carnival to put a bright mask over a face none of them wish to acknowledge. Perhaps this is why the Celestial Exalted are all welcomed into the city at this time - to prevent any of them from calling forth that which may only appear in this time.

This time the Solars are not at the mercy of their Sidereal patron to arrive in the great city. They arrive at the gates through the magic that the Circle's spirit allies hold, and enter with the authority that Ramar's Caste provides him. This time they are comfortable with the dazzling thoroughfares and magic-drenched sights. They make their way down boulevards comprised of liquid glass and solid light, past abandoned apartments that put to shame the palaces of mortal kings.

As before, the Carnival of Masks shows a festive, genial side to the great beings who sponsor it. For five days, the rulers of War on the mortal plane have put aside their blades and their bloodthirst, and any mortal armies who fail to do likewise will meet inauspicious ends. For five days, the lords of Commerce likewise put down their scales and money-bags, and their mortal adherents likewise. Creation is tempestuous, but man has laid down his burdens, less the chaos of the spirit world affect his mundane tasks as well. And in the Celestial City, music plays.

Egress looks about Yu-Shan with some trepidation. She remembers this place like a reflection off a foggy mirror. Fortunately she is not alone. It took nothing less than a monumental effort, but she (no doubt with much aid from Davron) even helped convince Rumika to come along. She walks hand-in-hand with her 'mother', unsure just what it is she is feeling. It's not fear, exactly. She speaks abruptly, "It's like.. expectation, I suppose."

"Speaking of expectations," comments Ramar, who has been walking near Egress for some time now, "Now that we have arrived, perhaps it would be a good idea to see about the fate of things to come. Or at the very least, learn what it is the Sidereals were able to determine." As soon as he finishes speaking, he'll head off in search of the Fisher. After all they know at least where his apartments here are, and it's likely there will be some clue as to his whereabouts there.

The Fisher has left little. His servant informs the visitor that its master will be attending the Carnival, along with the other Sidereals, and to expect him there. Thus edified, the Solars return to the gathering groups of people - spirits, divine beings, and enigmas, along with several of the Celestial Exalted.

Some of the arrivals are familiar faces - Lunars and Solars from the four corners of Creation. Some gathered here are Sidereals, without exception looking troubled in some fashion.

All bear the robes and crowns that signify their authority in the city. And in addition to them, the Circle witnesses other arrivals.

For example, there is a man wearing a resplendent blue ring upon his finger. His hair is reminiscent of Ramar's in its Western-tinted aspect, and his eyes are slitted like a cat's. He comes with a retinue of gods and assistants, many of whom seem to be Dragon-Blooded. Rumor gives his name as Gilthane of Coral, and he is a doughty Solar. Upon his brow sparkle five diamonds.

Egress uses her time, as always, with a frantic urgency. That much has not changed. She lacks the wrath of Gallius, but in no way is short of the drive to get things done. From the first moment she moves out among those gathered, introducing herself and Rumika as well as any of her Circle that goes with her. She does not use a false name for herself, and lets others invent names as they wish. Egress knows she will never be able to hide her identity now. Along among those present her caste mark shall never conceal itself again, nor shall she touch essence without it being quickly obvious. It does not matter, though. Here she has no need to hide. She is gathering information about any of the Solars she can find here, and feeling out their desires as best she can.

Ramar spends his time moving among the gathered crowd. He talks of hopes and dreams and things to come, and there's a curious look in his eyes regarding the worry that seems to plague the Sidereals. He does what he can to learn about this, but there will be time for such worries later. For now, it is time to simply relax and enjoy the carnival, and the company therein. Especially the company of one in particular. He's pleased to see Egress moving through the crowd as easily as she does.

For a time, Chi-Yosh hangs back. While partially he is seeking several specific individauls, namely Sea Wind, Spider, or Seven Devils Clever, the Solar for now is more comfortable to simply weave through the crowd, enjoying the simple gathering of so many Chosen and the wealth of different gods. It is comforting to be among the Exalted, with no enemy in sight. At least for five days, they all are at Peace, and the only threat are the intrigue interrupts they that are powerful from simply being themselves, with those about them. Family.

_Solars, gather,_ booms a deep voice through the crowd, and instinctively the Circle senses that this voice is only audible to them and their kind. It seems to come from a grand pavilion assembled near the center of the festivities.

Without hesitation, most of the Chosen of the Sun work their way through the crowd toward the pavilion. Those who don't show two or three diamonds at most, the mark of inexperience clear on their brow. These newly Chosen are shepherded by their more experienced fellows toward the abode of their patron.

---

This year, the four-armed Helios stands alone. The Maidens and Luna do not gather in the grand tent, although almost a hundred human souls do. Helios speaks, his orator's voice ringing clearly and loudly over the throng, and no mortal speaker feels compelled to speak while he does.

"It's been a busy year," the Unconquered Sun announces with a smile. "Gil. Yurgen. Egress. Koriko. Step up." One by one, the Circle sees those named approach.

Egress does not hesitate. She strides forward as she is instructed, not knowing just what is going to occur. She feels at least some comfort in having one close ally called with her, and another she hopes to at least count as a friend.

Chi-Yosh is honored. Each time he has stood before the Unconquered Sun, he has felt as though he were with an older, wiser brother. That connection that touched his presence during the moment of Exaltation, of understanding all and being kindred with the world. And now, he and his are acknowledged among their peers.

Ramar stands among his brethren, almost beaming when Egress' name is called out. He watches as those called to stand before the Unconquered Sun do so, and has something of a curious expression on his face, though he knows that whatever is to be done will certainly be grand.

"You lot!" Helios' voice carries clearly, and his smug smile is evident. "These four have worked hard on building strength in the North, South, East, and West. If you need a home, consider heading their way." He lets the obligatory murmurs of consideration ripple through the crowd, then continues. "And now, I want everyone to recognize a couple of really outstanding people... Davron. Ramar. Front and center."

Davron blinks in some surprise, and squeezes Rumika's hand, giving her a bashful smile as he strides forward with his companion Ramar. His cheeks color somewhat, being rather embarassed about being singled out among so many, even if it's for a good reason, but there is more than a little pride as well.

There's a 'who me' sort of look as Ramar hears his name called out. It catches him by surprise, to say the least. Nevertheless he walks forward, moving along with Davron. There's no hiding the somewhat puzzled, but delighted expression on his face as he steps forward. He looks out over the rest of the crowd of Solars, feeling almost pierced by their gaze. He stands beside Davron proudly.

"Tell these guys what you found," says Helios to the pair, speaking in low tones, and gesturing to the Solars. "This is important."

Davron's expression becomes more grave, as he realizes what the Unconquered Sun refers to, and he nods. Turning to the crowd, he speaks, hesitantly at first. "Some time back," he says, "I found myself plagued by dreams of proud cruelty. Fearing that I was under some form of mental attack, and believing I was about to succumb to them, I investigated further. Eventually, with the help of the Great Artificer, I found the source of those dreams... in my Spark itself." He pauses for a moment, looking out on the crowd.

Waves of disturbed murmurs move through the assembled heroes, but none speak yet.

Davron continues. "I encountered my previous incarnation - a man consumed by pride and arrogance. On that day, I learned first-hand that there is more to the tales of Anathema than Immaculate propaganda. But more importantly... I learned that the darkness that had consumed him was far too grim to be natural." He glances at Ramar. "Since then, we have learned that I was not alone. There is lore that speaks of outbursts of 'aberrant' behavior amongst our kind even in the height of the First Age." His voice lowers, becoming even more grim yet. "I believe that it is this which caused the downfall of the first Solar Realm. And if we cannot find a cure, then even if we succeed in restoring the old order of Creation - eventually it too shall fall."

"Oh yeah," murmurs Helios, but loud enough to be heard, and even the Sun himself cannot conceal the note of fatherly pride. "Tell 'em how you learned about that."

"I believe we _can_ find a cure though," adds Ramar, speaking with enough belief in this fact that it may as well be truth. "It has not been tried before, but then, we can succeed at this. Especially since we've manage to uncover the key to Solar Circle Sorcery. You see, we found the Book of Three Circles. It took quite a bit of doing just the same, we've very nearly died and come back from being dead in order to do such a thing..." Ramar adds in a few more hints of their exploits and what was involved in finding the book, "But we found it. And for all the trouble we've had because of it, I believe it's worth it."

At this, several startled exclamations ring through the Solar throng. Helios chuckles quietly. "You may have some rivals for that book, now," he observes to Davron and Ramar. "Be careful with it."

"Obviously there are people from whom that fact should be kept," booms the Unconquered Sun. "When you leave the pavilion here, that memory will be sealed away. If you speak to these people outside of this place, you'll be prompted to ask about a book. If they tell you, you'll get this memory back."

"Hold!" The voice is strong and resonant with authority, without sounding overly imperious. Its owner, a magnificently-built woman with five glittering diamonds on her brow, steps boldly through the Solar assembly. "I am Mai Bo, from An Teng in the Southwest. For those of us opposing the First and Forsaken Lion, this magic is of the utmost importance. You must share it. It is your duty!"

"Mai Bo, I understand that it is of the utmost importance that you deal with the Deathlord... however, there is something that must be pointed out. They who rule over the dead will not suffer Solar Sorcerers to exist." Ramar speaks, and his voice is carried easily, there is only truth to his words. "They know that those who are capable of commanding this magic must have learned it from someplace. They will not rest until the source of it is found. Consider what one Deathlord is capable of doing... now, imagine if all were united, if only for this lone purpose. Now is not the time for this magic to be used openly, now is the time for subtle strength, for slow power."

"We all understand slow power. All of us began lonely in our Exaltation, and ran in fear of the hounds of the more powerful." Chi-Yosh looks over the crowd, for the recollection among the eyes of his kindred. "We are entering a new phase. Our power bases are growing, but still we cannot face the challenges of the world at our state - they can still topple us. We must join together, and work. With the Book of Three Circles, once more the Solar Deliberative may form, but not without members, not without the dedication of restoration of the Solar to Creation."

Davron adds, "And there is more to the Book of Three Circles than the raw power of Solar sorcery, after all. There are secrets about the manipulation of Essence, about the creation of wonders, that have been long forgotten to living memory. And there are the records and the laws of the Solar Deliberative - which were crafted to minimize the effects of 'aberrant behavior'. While the laws did not save the Old Realm in the end, they preserved its integrity and justice for as long as possible, gave it breathing room. And we will need all the breathing room we can get."

"Ultimately, it is in our hands that our destinies lie. It is up to us to make use of what breathing room we can claw out for ourselves and grow. Moreover, we can rediscover that which was lost. We can learn about Essence, and then some, because we know that what was once discovered was not enough. Together, we can surpass the wonder of the first age... but there is much to be done beforehand. There may be a key in dealing with the Deathlords... a way to discover who it is they once were. For they have not always been around," adds Ramar, as he explains what he means. "Perhaps this knowledge would serve your cause, Mai Bo?"

The sorceress makes a soft "tch", but steps back. In her place, Gilthane, the prosperous and powerful Western Solar, again advances. "There's other knowledge that you may find useful - all of you. Your Circle seems knowledgeable about the Deathlords," he says, nodding to Davron and friends. "No doubt you have heard the same tale - that they are the ghosts of our predecessors." This news also lights off a wildfire of gossip, and the Unconquered Sun stands mutely by, arms folded.

Davron nods. "We have indeed heard that tale..." he says, and adds with a sheepish grin, "and when we told that tale to the Steersman, we were cautioned to be wary of where such tales come from." His expression returning to its more usual seriousness, he adds, "Of course, it may well be the truth - Kejak did not tell us it was _false_. But we should be very careful indeed before we assume that we know what such a thing would mean."

"It's true," Gilthane avers. "I have just one question for you - if they are the higher souls, or _hun_, then _where are their Sparks now?_"

Davron nods grimly. "A very good question indeed, Gilthane," he says. "We do not know... and if at all possible, we should endeavor to find out. If we can do so without antagonizing the Deathlords, that is."

"You can start your search with me," Gilthane replies calmly. "I've got one of 'em."

Needless to say this sets off another ripple of excited commentary from the throng, and even the Unconquered Sun raises an eyebrow.

Davron simply gapes in astonishment at Gilthane for a long moment. Eventually, he manates to stutter, "Er, well, then I guess we'll have to meet up with you later, then. Th... this could be very big," he manages, stating the blatantly obvious.

Chi-Yosh tries to put a better face on Davron's thought. "Each one of us has something inside of them that could help another Circle, a brother or sister. We are the greatest assett to each toher. Let us not mingle together for five days, and return to the world to only cross paths by fate's unique patterns on rare occasion. A Second Age with a Solar presence cannot continue as stray pins in a map, but as rings spanning far and wide with their connection."

Gilthane chuckles, withdrawing; Mai Bo looks intensely uneasy, but says nothing more. The gathered Solars are still murmuring amongst themselves. Finally, one more figure approaches the front, turning and raising both hands. He or she is masked, wearing a thespian's ceramic mask, but his/her robes clearly stand out as those of the Eclipse Caste. "Father, may I?" a woman's voice asks, and Helios chuckles and nods. "Call me Mirror Flag," she says by way of introduction. "Those of you pursuing the Deathlord issue, be aware that the Council of Entities in Nexus are tied intimately to them. Be also aware that the Realm is formulating a plan of battle against the Scavenger Lands, and will march soon. That is all." And she too steps aside.

Eventually the murmuring dies down. Ramar smiles, "It seems as though we have much work ahead of us. As has been said, together, we shall prevail... but when these days are done, we must go our separate ways. Thank you all for the information, and for hearing us out." He bows respectfully before the Unconquered Sun, "And thank you for honoring us so."
