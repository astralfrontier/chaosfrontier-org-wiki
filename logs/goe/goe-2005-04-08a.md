# Gods of Eden 2005-04-08a

With the war god now departed, the group gathers together to see to wounds and celebrate their victory. There is a look of concern on Ramar's face, however, which casts something of a shadow on the victory this day. "While I appreciate that you have learned that spell, and wish to make use of it, I am afraid we must use discretion in these matters. When that behemoth's spirit reaches the underworld, there is bound to be some... undue interest in what could snuff one out." The Solar glances around, looks somewhat relieved, "It can be dealt with however." He outlines the steps necessary to prevent this from happening. "We must work very swiftly, and in return I would ask you for a favor. For now though, ready one of the anti-entropy weapons. I make for the City of Dreams."

The City of Dreams was once a wondrous place. Now, little of that glory remains. Where once spires reached for the heavens, only rubble is left, scraping, struggling for the sky. Amidst the hollow shells of Dreams and Nightmares, Ramar wanders, searching for clues, for signs of where the Fair Folk that once dwelled here now reside.

The Fair Folk must play their roles. No matter where it is they have traveled, or what form they have taken, those who once dwelt here will still be as they were not long ago in their own way. To track down the displaced Fae is to find the story taking place once more. Ramar learns from those who scavenge the ruins, seeking out some shattered remnant or artifact of what came before. He is directed Southward, where the courts of the Wyld are rumored to be stirring with more activity than usual.

The Solar travels swiftly, stopping only to discern the subtle warping of Creation that every Wyld zone casts out in waves around it. When the flowers bloom in crystal and ice, he knows he is nearing his destination. Wrapping Essence around him like a cloak, the Solar walks into the Wyld, protected from its madness. His presence is made known very shortly and though he is set upon by the fair folks protectors, they hear him out. His request to meet with the displaced ones is granted after a lengthy exchange of pleasantries and diplomatic maneuvering.

The meeting is tense at first. There is no small degree of resentment and Ramar must explain precisely what happened when dealing with the tree of trapped souls. It takes time, the conversation eventually smooths out, and Ramar explains his desire to help the Fair Folk find a home once more, and that it would also aid the Solars. He does not quite specify how, though he is skilled enough to turn the topic of conversation to the exploits of the Fae. Their story, he explains, is quite interesting.

It takes a fair amount of talking, but eventually the agreement is reached. The Fair Folk will travel to the Plain of Screaming Winds when the preparations are made. They will harness the raw energies of the Wyld and shall create a new possibility, a new story for themselves. Ramar helps them to choose their roles, so to speak, and thanks them profusely for their agreement. They in turn thank him, and the Solar finishes his business with the court unmolested.

When once again the Solar stands on the Plain of Screaming Winds, there's something of an air of confidence about him. He has acted as diplomat to those out in the Wyld, and been successful. He has done that which he was Exalted for, and the feeling is almost exhilirating. Under the guidance of Ramar and Davron, the spot most conducive to their purposes can be selected. Here, Essence is more malleable, more susceptible to the whims of the Wyld. When at last the final preparations are made, and measures taken to prevent the Wyld zone from devouring reality without any kind of restraint whatsoever, to prevent the wide-spread expansion of this new domain... they detonate the weapon.

The winds howl unnaturally with the sudden impact that sends them scattering back from whence they came. Moments later, the winds are whipped into a fierce spiral that crackles with multicolored, spiraling, chaotic lights. There's a sound like a thunderclap, though halfway through it is no longer a sound. Now the thunder is given shape, given form. The winds become more tangible, and around the edges of the Wyld, reality shifts subtly, wavering as though ripples at the outermost edge of a pebble tossed into a calm pool.

Reality inside the Wyld zone begins to reorder itself. For a moment, directions cease to exist and things move in ways they have not before. Grass takes wings and wafts through the sky, the ground flows as though it were a river, the air becomes a solid mass, choking and crushing as in the very center a single perfect crystal comes into existence. From this crystal an eerie radiance erupts, the unnatural light hangs in the air, suspending the grass, rocks, dirt, and wind. With an almost violent motion, an unseen force issues forth, and in its wake are creatures of crystal that hang from a cavern of air and grass. Beneath the ceiling, a river of rock flows out of the mouth.

The mouth of the cave closes, and reveals itself to be part of a larger creature. It falls, and its body melds with the rippling ground, becoming the landscape. Where once the wind screamed, now it skitters along the ground. Chaos reigns for a few moments more, until the realm begins to stabilize. There's a soft sound as though wind through chimes, and the ground trembles, then relaxes. Standing at the edge now, are the Nobles of the City of Dreams, almost anxious to survey their new realm.

While the Fair Folk busy themselves with the creation of their palaces, their courts, and homes, the Solars quietly make their exit. While aboard the airship back, Ramar tracks Samea down to make his request. "I need a favor from you... when you have time, I would ask you to summon a demon, Sondok-who I will only name once-on my behalf." He explains the reasons why, and though he looks pained to ask, has resolved himself to do this.

Samea nods her agreement to this. Ramar returns, leaving her to contemplate the summoning. He returns to the Nation of the Sun, and studies the collected works of lore they have assembled to try and learn as much as he can about the demon in question. He'll even question the Book, if such records can be found there. Some time later, a messenger spirit arrives on Samea's behalf, informing Ramar that his request has been completed, and that the demon awaits him. The Solar draws a breath to steel himself, and leaves the security of his studies to meet with the demon. A room has been specially prepared for this meeting, and with one last breath, Ramar enters.

She Who Stands in Doorways is a powerful creature, a peerless combatant. The being that Ramar witnesses waiting seems a mixture of frailty and strength, and radiates not so much danger or menace as threat. Sondok stands only five feet tall; her hair is a fine billowing mass of black; and her face is attractive in its way, but striking rather than beautiful. Her eyes are red like blood, and her fingernails are talons crusted with the same color. Dried blood marks her cheeks.

Upon her head is a crown of gold and garnet, whose features give her face a wolfish cast. Upon her body is the Upaatishid armor forged for her by the black craftsmen of Malfeas, a crimson-black leather. Upon her back is a sword whose hilt is carved, it is said, from a human thighbone.

Her red eyes rise when Ramar approaches, and her cold voice blows like the harsh northern winds. "I have come to serve, you devil."

"Good." Ramar listens to the demon's cold voice, and shows no sign of fear. Here, he is to be master. He must, if he is to survive. He explains what it is he is after, what it is he seeks to learn, and in doing so tells Sondok that she is to teach him.

"What you want to learn are the Eighty-Seven Styles," the demon replies, in a chilly voice, after listening to the Exalt. "There are techniques of swordsmanship beyond them, but they must come first. Shall I tell you what the Styles are?"

"Yes," answers Ramar.

Sondok speaks, her cold and inhuman voice detailing the numerous ways in which men may die under the blades of a swordsman. There are styles of the five corners of creation; styles that flow like the fate spelled out in the starry night sky; styles that emulate the talons and fangs of animals; and more. Finally she pauses. "And there is the final technique of swordsmanship. I will speak of it, if you wish, but you cannot master it without knowing the others."

"If I am to learn the styles and the technique, you will teach me them. By all means, please speak of the final technique of swordsmanship." Ramar stands back, listening, but also watching the demon closely, searching for signs of untruth, of deception...

"The final technique of swordsmanship. Your patron god practices it," the demon says. "The sword is absent from both hand and heart. You need not defend yourself, because none would dare attack you. You have mastered the art of death to the degree that you need never use it. Do you understand?"

"I believe I begin to, but I do not understand completely. Not yet. That is why you are here," answers Ramar.

"Then let us begin," replies Sondok, drawing her jet-black sword from its sheath. "Think of a circle..."
